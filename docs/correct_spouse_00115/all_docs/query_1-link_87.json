        "text": "Britney Spears and Sam Asghari have finally married after a five-year courtship.\n\nOn June 9 the couple wed in an intimate ceremony in California. Asghari's representative Brandon Cohen confirmed the pair's nuptials to the Associated Press news agency on Thursday.\n\n'I am very ecstatic this day has come, and they are married. I know he wanted this for so long. He is so caring and supportive every step of the way,' he said.\n\nIn September 2021 the couple announced that they were engaged, with the singer taking to Instagram to show off her ring.\n\n‘I can't f-cking believe it, [sic]’ the mother-of-two captioned a series of videos on Instagram of her round-cut engagement ring, made with a four-carat diamond by Forever Diamonds NY.\n\nThe pair met on the set of the singer’s ‘Slumber Party’ music video in 2016 and have been in a relationship ever since.\n\nSpears’ marriage to Asghari is her third and the personal trainer’s first. Spears was previously married to dancer Kevin Federline, with whom she has two children. Following a three-year marriage the pair divorced in 2007. Prior to her marriage to Federline, the ‘Hit Me Baby, One More Time’ singer wed her childhood friend Jason Alexander in Las Vegas in 2004, but the marriage was annulled soon after.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about Britney Spears and Sam Asghari’s Wedding:\n\nWho attended Britney Spears' wedding?\n\nThe BBC reports Madonna, Paris Hilton, Selena Gomez, Ansel Elgort and Drew Barrymore attended the ceremony.\n\nVogue reports the couple didn't have a first dance, but that Gomez, Madonna and Spears danced to 'Toxic' together, and Hilton and Spears sang the former's single 'Stars Are Blind'.\n\nDuring a TV appearance in June 2022 Hilton revealed that she turned down an invitation to perform for President Joe Biden at a summit dinner with his fellow leaders in order to attend Spears' wedding.\n\n'They were like \"we'll send a helicopter and you can fly back and forth\" and I'm like \"I'm not going to be the one landing in and out of Britney's wedding, come on.'\n\nWhen asked by TV host Chelsea Handler whether she told the President it was an emergency, Hilton joked: 'It's Britney, b*tch, come on!'\n\nimage id='042977e1-f9ad-49d0-b26e-b01bc6d6df08' mediaId='24fb57ce-bdef-498b-b517-51ada6793815' align='center' size='medium' share='false' caption='' expand='' crop='original'][/image]\n\nSpears' parents, Jamie and Lynn, and sister, Jamie Lynn, are believed to have not been in attendance.\n\nWeeks after the wedding it appears Spears has now deactivated her Instagram account seemingly as a result of ongoing problems with her family, triggered by issues over their attendance at her wedding.\n\nMeanwhile, Spears' first husband Alexander allegedly gatecrashed the wedding. 'He streamed video on Instagram Live before the ceremony apparently from inside her home before being tackled,' the BBC reports.\n\nVentura County Sheriff's Department told the PA Media that an altercation had taken place with security officers. 'Mr Alexander had been charged with four misdemeanour offences of trespassing, battery and vandalism,' the Sheriff reportedly noted, per the BBC's reporting.\n\n'He was able to find his way onto the property and was confronted by security,' a police spokesman said. 'An altercation occurred with the security officers and that's where the battery occurred... and during the altercation an item was broken, so that's where the vandalism comes into play. And by being on private property, the trespass comes into play.'\n\nSpeaking about the aesthetic for the day, Spears told Vogue that she and event producer Jeffrey Best of Best Events wanted to create a 'small and beautiful moment with family and friends'. 'We wanted warm and feminine colours including blush, white, cream, and gold, and a lot of various shades of pinks, blush, and reds,' she noted.\n\nThe front of the couple's house was decorated in roses and a white horse with gold hooves and a carriage pulled up outside.\n\nWho designed Britney Spears' wedding dress?\n\nThe bride wore an off-the-shoulder custom Versace dress with a leg slit on one side, accessorised with a white satin-trimmed veil and sheer gloves.\n\nSpears later shared details about the intricate process that went into designing her dress.\n\nWeeks after the nuptials she took to Instagram to post a video from the fashion house and revealed that over 700 hand stitches went into tailoring and crafting of the design.\n\nShe signed off her post with: 'A huge thank you to @donatella_versace and the @versace team for making me a real-life princess [sic].'\n\nSpears styled the look with 62 carat jewellery from jeweller Stephanie Gottlieb, which consisted of round diamond and pear shaped drop earrings, a heart-shaped diamond tennis necklace in white gold, and an oval diamond tennis bracelet. 'We knew that Britney’s dress had a classic silhouette with an open neckline, so we designed timeless pieces that would complement the style,' Gottlieb told Vogue.\n\nThe bride later changed into three more looks: a black mini dress, a two-toned number and a red dress, all designed by Versace.\n\nMeanwhile her husband wore a black Versace tuxedo.\n\nAs for her make-up, Charlotte and Sofia Tilbury were the masterminds behind the natural look.\n\n'I was so thrilled and honoured to be asked to design Britney’s bridal beauty look!' Charlotte told Vogue. 'Britney is an icon of our time who has inspired and empowered us all with her joy and positive energy. She’s such a natural beauty and has the most mesmerising big, brown eyes.'\n\nMonths earlier Spears shared a series of Instagram slideshow posts wearing a pastel pink tulle ballgown, sending fans into a frenzy that the soon-to-be bride had chosen her wedding dress.\n\nHowever, Spears swiftly cleared up any rumours about whether the gown was in fact what she would be wearing on her wedding day, and sneakily let slip who is designing the singer's bridal outfit posting the caption:\n\n'No … this is not my wedding dress 👗 bahahah!!!!' Britney wrote, adding, 'Donatella Versace is making my dress as we speak 🤫 …. Have a good night folks 🌙💖✨ !!!!'\n\nIn May 2022 the bride-to-be also shared a photo of her wedding veil. 'Introducing Wendy 🐈 !!! And yes, this is the veil to my wedding dress 👰🏼‍♀️ !!! [sic]' she captioned the photo of her new cat sitting atop the wedding accessory.\n\nFor her wedding to Federline in 2004 the singer wore a strapless Monique Lhuillier dress accessorised with lace half-length gloves and a cathedral-veil. After the reception Spears changed into another Lhuillier design – a lace mini dress and a garter.\n\nWhere did Britney Spears and Sam Asghari get married?\n\nThe couple married in California at the pair's Thousand Oaks home.\n\nTo celebrate Spears' 40th birthday in December 2021, Asghari shared a series of photos ahead of their holiday.\n\n'I call you Lioness because I admire your relentless strength, I’m inspired by your beautiful heart, I celebrate your smile that lights up my world. Everyday is your birthday my queen. Happy 1st birthday to my wife, [sic]' he captioned the photos.\n\nThe last sentence sent their fans into a tailspin, with some speculating they'd already tied the knot.\n\n'Wife???? Omg, [sic]' commented one follower. Another added: 'Wife??? When??? Congratulations!!! [sic]'\n\nIn recent months the couple teased possible wedding locations with fans.\n\nIn October 2021, Spears took to Instagram to share a video of herself and Asghari on holiday in French Polynesia and admitted they were struggling to decide where to get married.\n\n'We have a predicament. I have no idea where we want to get married. We don't know if we want to get married in Italy, Greece, Australia or New York City,' she says in the clip.\n\n'Why don't you ask the fans?' he fiancé asks, before commenting on the post with US flag emojis.\n\nAsghari is originally from Tehran, Iran and immigrated to the US at the age of 12.\n\nIn an interview with Men’s Health he said of the move: ‘I had to leave my friends and family who I was very close with, and I knew I was moving away and never coming back.’ He later went on to play football for Los Angeles's Moorpark College.\n\nMeanwhile, Spears is originally from Mississippi.\n\nDid Britney Spears and Sam Asghari sign a prenup?\n\nBritney spears reportedly signed a prenuptial agreement with her now husband Sam Asghari.\n\nOn Monday June 13, 3022, TMZ reported that sources close to the singer claim she signed the document to ensure that Asghari will not be able to obtain any of her multi-million-dollar income if they divorce.\n\nSpears previously filed court papers which state that she doesn’t want her father to ‘impede’ a prenuptial agreement, which she is believed to be commissioning, prior to her marriage to Sam Asghari.\n\nWhile several well wishes shared congratulatory messages for the pair following their engagement, some fans were quick to mention the importance of a prenup in order to protect both of the stars’ finances.\n\nActor Octavia Spencer was among Spears’ followers who commented about a contract prior to the couple’s marriage, commented on the singer’s engagement post: ‘Make him sign a prenup.’\n\nWhile some fans found Spencer’s comment unsolicited, Asghari has since joked on his Instagram Stories that the pair would be getting an ‘iron clad prenup’.\n\n‘Of course we’re getting [an] iron clad prenup to protect my jeep and shoe collection in case [sic] she dumps me one day, [sic]’ he replied to one comment about a possible contract.\n\nWhat have Britney Spears and Sam Asghari said about their marriage?\n\nFollowing her and Asghari's wedding, Spears opened up about having had a 'panic attack' before her and the actor's nuptials.\n\nReflecting on the big day, the 'Womanizer' singer shared a series of wedding photos along with a video clip to her Instagram feed. The post was accompanied with a caption that addressed her pre-wedding nerves. She wrote that she had a 'panic attack' before adding: 'And then got it together.'\n\nIn 2021 Asghari, who remains relatively private about his relationship with Spears, told People: ‘I have always wanted nothing but the best for my better half, and will continue to support her following her dreams and creating the future she wants and deserves.\n\n‘I am thankful for all of the love and support she is receiving from her fans all over the world, and I am looking forward to a normal, amazing future together,’ he added, alluding to the #FreeBritneyMovement which he has shown support for in recent years on social media.\n\nIn an interview with Entertainment Tonight in 2019 Asghari suggested that marriage was on the cards for the pair.\n\n‘This is something that every couple should do,’ he said of marriage. ‘That's the whole point of a relationship—we are a family. ...
