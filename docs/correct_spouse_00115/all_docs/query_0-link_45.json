        "text": "Britney Spears’ ex-husband Kevin Federline has given the singer some words of encouragement following her break up from Sam Asghari after just over a year of marriage.\n\nThe former backup dancer Federline has spoken out via his lawyer Mark Vincent Kaplan about the split that was announced earlier this week.\n\nKaplan told ET in a statement: “He wishes them both the best.\n\n“If they reconcile, great, but hopefully it won't be a factor that makes her feel more alienated than she might otherwise be if she was still in an intact marriage.\n\n\"He wishes her the best and hopes that things work out for her for the best.”\n\nKaplan went on to share some words of encouragement the father-of-six wanted to give to Spears.\n\nHe said the Gimme More singer needed to “be strong, be focused, and get good advice from those around you before making important decisions.”\n\nSpears and Federline started dating in the early 2000s, having met at a nightclub, and got married in 2004.\n\nThey had sons Sean, now 17, and Jayden, 16, before going their separate ways in 2007.\n\nIn May, Spears gave her blessing for Federline to move to Hawaii with their songs and his wife Victoria Prince.\n\nKaplan stated that the teens were “very happy there”, despite the devastating wildfires in Maui.\n\nHe added: “I mean, everyone in Hawaii is grieving for the horrible tragedy that was visited upon the people of Maui, and in particular the people of the Lahaina area.\n\n“But aside from that, they're very happy. They're happy with the life they have there.”\n\nNews of Asghari filing for divorce from Spears came earlier this week, with TMZ reporting it came following the 29-year-old suspecting she had cheated on him.\n\nIn a statement, Asghari said: “After 6 years of love and commitment to each other my wife and I have decided to end our journey together.\n\n“We will hold onto the love and respect we have for each other and I wish her the best always. S**t happens.”"
