        "text": "Britney Spears and Sam Asghari’s relationship might be “Toxic,” according to TMZ.\n\nTMZ is producing a Spears doc that will air Monday, and multiple sources alleged to the outlet that the couple’s marriage is in “deep trouble” — and that the 41-year-old singer has reportedly gotten “physical” with her husband.\n\nSources claimed that Spears and Asghari, 29, often get into screaming arguments — and their fights have even gotten so explosive that security has had to intervene.\n\nAsghari allegedly does not stay at their home much anymore, according to TMZ, which is cause for concern, considering Spears has relied on him since her conservatorship ended.\n\nBut he recently went on his Instagram Stories to slam the TMZ doc and defend his “princess of pop” wife.\n\n“I found it absolutely disgusting that people that were in her life at the time, when she didn’t have a voice, they went and told her story like it was theirs. It was absolutely disgusting,” Asghari said in the video. “How are you gonna take the most influential person of our generation, the princess of pop, America’s sweetheart, and put her in prison where her father tells her what to do, what water to drink, who to see, and use her as a money-making machine?”\n\nHe continued, “Then, all the sudden, after 15 years when she’s free, after all those gaslighting and after all those things that went down, how are you gonna put her under a microscope and tell her story? No. That’s also disgusting.”\n\nThe Post has reached out to reps for Spears and Asghari for comment.\n\nTMZ previously reported that the pop star guzzles caffeinated drinks by the gallon — consuming so much that sometimes she stays awake for three consecutive days.\n\nSpears reportedly drinks Red Bull, Celsius, coffee and dandelion tea “almost nonstop.”\n\nExperts — including media personality and addiction medicine specialist Dr. Drew Pinsky — told TMZ that those who suffer from mental illness often crave the high they get from caffeine, although it’s not healthy or great for them.\n\nSpears responded to the caffeine claims on social media, claiming that she does “what makes me feel most alive and gives me interest.”\n\n“My mind gets busy and sometimes that can be an easy target to mess with,” she captioned the Instagram post. “Anyways, I’m sticking to watermelon juice, which is the weirdest thing ever but I was told for years I can’t have coffee and now that I can it’s my pride … I can’t even look at it !!!”\n\n“TMZ Investigates: Britney Spears, The Price of Freedom” takes a look at the “Baby One More Time” singer’s life since her conservatorship ended a year and a half ago.\n\nAfter her public meltdown in 2007, Spears was first put into conservatorship in 2008 by her now-estranged father, Jamie Spears, which lasted until it was lifted in November 2021.\n\nThe TV special touches on her relationships with her family and kids, her marriage to Asghari, a failed intervention and concerns that those closest to her have observed.\n\nSpears married Kevin Federline, 44, in 2004, and had a son, Sean Preston, now 17, then another, Jayden James, now 16. She divorced Federline two months after Jayden was born in 2007.\n\nHer relationship with her sons has been fraught since she entered a 13-year-long conservatorship in February 2008 and went through a custody battle, during which the couple shared their sons 50/50.\n\nSean and Jayden were noticeably absent from Spears’ wedding to Asghari, which Federline alleged was because they had chosen not to see her.\n\n“Britney Spears has had a year and a half of freedom since the conservatorship ended, but there are big problems,” narrator and TMZ executive producer Harvey Levin said at the beginning of the explosive trailer for the doc.\n\nThe hourlong doc also uncovers some of the advice those taking care of Spears offered during the conservatorship — including to “keep knives away from her.”\n\nThe “Baby One More Time” singer has been the subject of quite a few recent documentaries surrounding her conservatorship and the #FreeBritney movement — although she had no involvement in any of it.\n\n“With 4 documentaries released about me last year with people I adore speaking about my past !!” she wrote in a previously deleted Instagram post. “Unfortunately, the way my past was portrayed in those documentaries was extremely embarrassing !!! It felt semi-illegal !!!”\n\nSpears is also in the midst of working on an explosive autobiography — but it has reportedly been delayed over concerns among the A-listers mentioned in the book.\n\nSimon & Schuster has put the memoir, which was originally expected to be released this past February, on hold after receiving letters from two of Spears’ famous exes, according to the Sun.\n\n“Britney is brutally honest in the book — there are a lot of nervous A-listers,” a source told the outlet. “Strongly worded legal letters have been sent to the publishers by people who know Britney and who fear what she has written. There is no movement at the moment, and there are concerns over when it will eventually be able to come out.”"
