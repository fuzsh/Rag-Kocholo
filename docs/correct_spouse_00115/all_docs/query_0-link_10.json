        "text": "Britney Spears’ ex-husband Kevin Federline is sending positive thoughts to the pop superstar amid her divorce from Sam Asghari.\n\n“He just hopes that they work it out,” the DJ’s longtime attorney, Mark Vincent Kaplan, told NewsNation Wednesday, shortly after the split news first broke.\n\n“The media is a heavy focus on this one,” the family law lawyer pointed out before adding, “and he just hopes that everything works out for the best, whether that’s being together or not being together.”\n\nKaplan also said that Federline, 45, “just hopes” that Spears, 41, and Asghari, 29, “make good decisions and work out, either go their separate ways or get back together.”\n\nHe concluded, “Whatever is best for them. He wishes her the best.”\n\nKaplan also tells Page Six exclusively that his client is “sorry” that Spears and Asghari’s relationship didn’t work out, reiterating that his client wishes his ex well.\n\nThe high-powered lawyer also notes that the DJ has not spoken with the “Womanizer” singer about her recent breakup.\n\n“Obviously, if Britney reached out to [Federline], he wouldn’t avoid her call but I don’t see any reason why they would be speaking because of her divorce to Sam.”\n\nKaplan adds to Page Six that while Federline did not know Asghari well personally, the “Britney and Kevin: Chaotic” alum thought the Iranian American actor “seemed to make Britney happy and that was a good environment for Britney to be in.”\n\nFederline’s supportive attitude echoes similar sentiments he’s expressed in the past.\n\nWhen Spears and Asghari tied the knot in June 2022, the former backup dancer told Page Six via Kaplan, “He wants her to be happy and believes this will be a positive step for her in a post-conservatorship era, building a healthy, happy future going forward.”\n\nHowever, Federline, who shares sons Sean Preston, 17, and Jayden, 16, with the “Toxic” singer, also confirmed to us via his lawyer that the boys were not attending their mom’s wedding.\n\n“They think the focus of this day should be on Britney and Sam, and they are very happy for her moving forward,” Kaplan said at the time.\n\nNearly two months prior to the nuptials, Spears announced that she and Asghari were expecting their first child together.\n\nFederline again sent his congratulations, with Kaplan telling NBC News in April 2022 that his client wished the “Lucky” singer “the best for a happy, healthy pregnancy and congratulates her and Sam Asghari as they plan for the excitement of parenthood together.”\n\nSpears sadly announced shortly after that her pregnancy resulted in a miscarriage.\n\nDespite Federline publicly backing his ex-wife and her new husband’s relationship, the warm feelings weren’t always mutual.\n\nAfter the father of six revealed in a bombshell August 2022 interview that Preston and Jayden chose not to see their mom in part because of her racy pics, both Spears and Asghari lashed out over the comments.\n\n“It saddens me to hear that my ex-husband has decided to discuss the relationship between me and my children,” the Grammy winner said via social media at the time. “As we all know, raising teenage boys is never easy for anyone … It concerns me the fact that the reason is based on my Instagram.”\n\nAsghari, for his part, added, “There is no validity to his statement regarding the kids distancing themselves and it is irresponsible to make that statement publicly.\n\n“Kevin’s gravy train will end soon which probably explains the timing of these hurtful statements. I do not know him personally and have nothing against him aside him choosing to vilify my wife.”\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nThe “Family Business” actor’s comments now appear ironic given that he is reportedly seeking to contest the terms of his prenuptial agreement with Spears and allegedly threatening to release “extraordinarily embarrassing” information about his estranged wife if she doesn’t renegotiate.\n\nThis isn’t Spears’ first divorce rodeo, however. She and Federline parted ways in 2007 after three years of marriage.\n\nAt the time of their divorce, the “Gimme More” singer had to cut her ex a $1.3 million check and pay him spousal support for several years.\n\nSpears also paid Federline $20,000 a month in child support until he asked for that figure to be bumped up to $60,000 a month. A settlement was reached regarding that dispute for an undisclosed amount."
