        "text": "Britney Spears and husband Sam Asghari have split after 14 months of marriage, according to multiple reports.\n\nRepresentatives for Spears and Asghari did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.\n\nThe 41-year-old pop star and the 29-year-old actor tied the knot June 9, 2022, after five years of dating. It was the third marriage for Spears and the first for Asghari.\n\nSOPHIA BUSH, MILEY CYRUS, BRITNEY SPEARS AMONG HOLLYWOOD'S SHORTEST MARRIAGES FROM 55 HOURS TO 13 MONTHS\n\nThe two first met in October 2016 on the set of Spears' \"Slumber Party\" music video and went public with their romance in January 2017.\n\nAsghari proposed to the \"Toxic\" hitmaker in September 2021 with a four-carat diamond ring that was engraved with her nickname, \"Lioness.\" Spears announced her engagement on Instagram, writing at the time, \"I can't f---ing believe it.\"\n\nTheir wedding was a star-studded affair at her mansion in Thousand Oaks, California. Around 60 guests were in attendance, including Madonna, Selena Gomez, Drew Barrymore, Paris Hilton and Carter Reum, Kathy Hilton, Maria Menounos, Ansel Elgort and Donatella Versace.\n\n\"Wow !!! Holy holy crap !!! WE DID IT !!! WE GOT MARRIED,\" Spears wrote on Instagram at the time.\n\n\"It was the most spectacular day !!! I was so nervous all morning but then at 2:00 pm it really hit me … WE’RE GETTING MARRIED. I had a panic attack and then got it together. The crew who created our home into literally a dream castle were fantastic !!! The ceremony was a dream and the party was even better.\"\n\nSpears' sons, Sean Preston, 17, and Jayden James, 16, who she shares with her ex-husband Kevin Federline, 45, were not in attendance. The Grammy Award winner and Federline were married three years from 2004 to 2007.\n\nOne unwelcome guest was Spears' first husband, Jason Alexander, who was arrested after attempting to crash the wedding, police sources later confirmed to Fox News Digital. Alexander was convicted of trespassing and battery misdemeanor charges and sentenced to time served after spending 64 days in jail.\n\nSpears and Alexander tied the knot in January 2004 during an early morning ceremony at A Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas. However, their union was annulled 55 hours later with Alexander claiming the separation was forced by Spears' mother, Lynne Spears, and Britney’s management.\n\nLynne, Spears' father Jamie, sister Jamie-Lynn and brother Bryan were also not present at the nuptials, which came after the \"Gimme More\" hitmaker's lengthy legal battle to end her conservatorship. Following a series of highly-publicized mental health struggles, Spears was placed under the conservatorship of her father Jamie in 2008.\n\nAsghari publicly supported Spears' fight to end the conservatorship, which was terminated after 13 years in November 2021. During a court hearing in June 2021, Spears made several explosive allegations against her father and other conservators that included testimony that she had been denied the right to marry again or have another child.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nIn April 2022, Spears and Asghari announced they were expecting their first child. The following month, the pair revealed Spears had a miscarriage, with the singer telling her Instagram followers they had lost their \"miracle baby.\"\n\n\"Our love for each other is our strength. We will continue trying to expand our beautiful family,\" she wrote.\n\nIn a comment on Spears' post, Asghari wrote, \"We will have a miracle soon.\"\n\nSince tying the knot, Spears and Asghari's union has appeared strong. In March, Spears celebrated her husband's 29th birthday with a tribute on Instagram.\n\nAlongside a slideshow featuring photos of the couple, Spears wrote, \"Happy Birthday!!! I love you so much and hope you get all your birthday wishes and more!!!\"\n\nIn May, Spears posted a PDA-packed video of her with her spouse.\n\n\"I feel so blessed to be with such an incredible husband who inspires me everyday!!!\" she wrote in the caption.\n\nOn their wedding anniversary in June, Asghari shared a photo of the duo showing off their wedding rings, writing, \"Happy 1 Year to me & my better half.\" He also posted a video featuring previously unseen footage from their wedding day.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAt the time, Asghari's representative, Brandon Cohen, also denied rumors of marital trouble between the two after they were photographed separately without their wedding rings in March. Cohen told People magazine Asghari had removed his wedding band because he was filming a movie."
