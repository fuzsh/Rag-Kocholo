        "text": "Celebrities and personal drama took center stage before a gossip-hungry public this year, and perhaps none received more press than superstar rapper Kevin Federline. So when his wife of two years abruptly filed for divorce, the country took notice.\n\nAccording to Federline's publicist, Marilyn Chang, the spouse, a 24-year-old entertainer who worked as a singer and foreground dancer at Federline performances before wedding him in 2004, presented Federline with divorce papers on Nov. 7 citing irreconcilable differences.\n\n\"K-Fed gave it his best, but in the end it just wasn't meant to be,\" said Chang of the reportedly tumultuous relationship between Federline and his partner, whose vocal talents have been featured on several pop and dance albums. \"The good news is that this separation might afford Kevin the opportunity to finally move on and grow as an artist. This marriage was really slowing him down, and I think many will agree with me when I say we want the old Kevin back.\"\n\nFederline is seeking sole custody of his two sons, claiming his estranged wife, a struggling actress who has appeared in soft-drink commercials, is unfit to care for 1-year-old Sean Preston and 3-month-old Jayden James.\n\n\"Kevin is a family man,\" Chang said. \"He will do whatever is necessary to protect his kids, and he will not be undermined by this irresponsible hanger-on, who was only in the marriage to springboard her own career.\"\n\nFederline has two children from a previous relationship with Shar Jackson, costar of the mid-90s UPN sitcom Moesha and a featured player in the 1997 Nickelodeon feature Good Burger."
