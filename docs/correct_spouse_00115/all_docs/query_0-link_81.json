        "text": "Britney Spears and husband Sam Asghari responded to Kevin Federline's comments about the pop star.\n\nIn an exclusive with the Daily Mail, Spears' ex-husband spoke about her relationship with their sons.\n\nBritney Spears took to social media Saturday night to respond to ex-husband Kevin Federline's recent exclusive with the Daily Mail. In a series of interviews with Daphne Barak slated to air on ITV News later this week, Federline spoke out about the pop star and her relationship with their two sons.\n\nFederline claimed that their kids, 16-year-old Sean Preston and 15-year-old Jayden, \"have decided they are not seeing her right now.\" Federline also said the boys \"made the decision\" to skip Spears' wedding earlier this year to long-term boyfriend Sam Asghari.\n\nFederline and Spears were married in 2004 before filing for divorce in 2007.\n\nThe two were involved in a highly publicized custody battle for their children after Federline won full custody of both sons in 2008, according to The Guardian. Shortly after, Spears' controversial conservatorship began, lasting for 13 years.\n\nSpears was released from the legal arrangement last November after a judge ruled to suspend her father Jamie Spears as the conservator of her finances.\n\nAfter word of Federline's interview spread, both Spears and Asghari responded to his claims on Instagram.\n\nOn Saturday Spears wrote on her Instagram Story: \"It saddens me to hear that my ex husband has decided to discuss the relationship between me and my children ... As we all know, raising teenage boys is never easy for anyone.\"\n\nSpears swatted down Federline's claims that her sons are distancing themselves due to nude photos Spears shared on social media.\"\n\nShe added: \"I gave them everything ... Only one word: HURTFUL.\"\n\nSpears finished the post by claiming that her mother Lynne Spears encouraged her to give her kids over to Federline.\n\nSpears further expanded on Federline's interview on her Instagram feed.\n\n\"During my conservatorship I was controlled and monitored for nearly 15 years ... I needed permission just to take Tylenol !!!\" Spears wrote.\n\nAsghari, via Instagram Story, claimed that Federline's goal is to \"vilify\" Spears and criticized Federline for standing by while she was under a conservatorship.\n\n\"His character is revealed by approval of a 13 year CShip and his loyalty to Jaimie indicates his approval at time of its conception as well ... Anyone approving of it is wrong or benefiting from it somehow,\" Asghari wrote.\n\nAsghari followed up with another post, quoting Will Smith's infamous follow-up to the Oscars slap. \"I wish him the best and hope he has a more positive outlook in the future for benefit of all involved. But for now: Keep my wife's name ... out your mouth.\"\n\nIn the exclusive interview with the Daily Mail, Federline said that Spears' conservatorship \"saved\" her and claimed that he's \"apologized\" to his sons about the nude photos Spears has shared on social media following the end of her conservatorship.\n\n\"I try to explain to them, 'Look, maybe that's just another way she tries to express herself.' But that doesn't take away from the fact of what it does to them. It's tough. I can't imagine how it feels to be a teenager having to go to high school,\" Federline said.\n\nRepresentatives for Spears, Asghari, and Federline did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment."
