        "text": "Kevin Federline wants nothing more than for the mother of his children to be happy.\n\nFollowing Britney Spears' shocking testimony at her conservatorship hearing last week, the pop singer's ex-husband, 43, has spoken out through his divorce lawyer Mark Vincent Kaplan.\n\nREAD MORE: Read Britney Spears' full statement against conservatorship\n\n\"The best thing would be for their mom to be healthy and happy,\" Kaplan told People. \"And if either of those things aren't true, it doesn't provide for the best setting for custody to be exercised.\"\n\n\"[Kevin] certainly respects Britney and only hopes the best for her because when the best for her is achieved, it's the best for their kids. The kids love their mother and he wants there to be a healthy and strong relationship,\" he added.\n\nAcknowledging the claims Spears made in her testimony, Kaplan continued, \"Britney has not been served well by the conservatorship and it's not consistent with what she wants. I think that she should be able to challenge that. And if it's what's best for her, Kevin supports it.\"\n\nKaplan also explained he believes it's best for the 39-year-old 'Toxic' singer's \"voice to be heard\" and that the court will have to ensure if \"she's OK,\" regarding her mental health.\n\nREAD MORE: Britney Spears is far from the first to learn family and fame can be a fraught combination\n\n\"If it was necessary, we have to be concerned about whether she's OK,\" Kaplan said, referring to Spears revealing in court that she was forced to take lithium. \"And if it's no longer necessary, that's great too.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Everything we know about Britney Spears' past and present relationships\n\nIn February 2021, Kaplan told E! News that Federline has \"no involvement\" in the conservatorship battle, but said both he and Spears were successfully co-parenting their kids.\n\nThe estranged couple were married from 2004 until 2007 and share sons Sean Preston, 15, and Jayden James, 14.\n\nREAD MORE: Everything to know about #FreeBritney\n\nThe statement from Federline's lawyer comes following a slew of celebrities speaking out in favour of the #FreeBritney movement, including Spears' former Mickey Mouse Club co-star Christina Aguilera, ex-boyfriend Justin Timberlake, Mariah Carey, Cher, Brandy and more. Earlier on Monday, Spears' sister Jamie Lynn Spears also broke her silence on the situation.\n\n\"Maybe I didn't support her the way the public would like me to with a hashtag on a public platform, but I can assure you I've supported my sister long before there was a hashtag,\" Jamie Lynn said. \"And I'll support her long after.\"\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, sign up here to receive our top stories straight to your inbox"
