        "text": "Once upon a time, Britney Spears and Kevin Federline were Hollywood's biggest couple.\n\nThe pair, who laid eyes on each other for the first time inside a club back in 2004, were tabloid fodder from the moment they met.\n\n\"We just hit it off right away,\" Federline told People in 2008. \"I was madly in love with her. Everything just seemed so right. I didn’t see it as too fast or too slow.\"\n\nWatch: Zoe Saldana talks about Britney Spears announcing her pregnancy. Post continues after video.\n\nVideo via YouTube.\n\nFor almost three years, Federline and Spears were front page news. They weren't just a young couple in love; their every movement was monitored, scrutinised and reported on.\n\nHere's everything we know about their messy relationship – including K-Fed's new 'tell-all' interview – and where they are today.\n\nHow long were Britney Spears and Kevin Federline married for?\n\nWithin just three months of dating, Spears proposed to Federline. They married in their Studio City home on September 18, 2004.\n\nWhile the pair had plans to throw an extravagant ceremony and reception, they decided not to follow through and instead exchanged vows at their engagement party.\n\n\"I just thought it would be too much if we had done it when we were supposed to,\" the 'Toxic' singer told People at the time. \"It became this huge thing, and I was like, 'What are we waiting for? We know this is the real thing, why not just do it now?' That’s why I wanted to sneak and do it our little way.\"\n\nThe couple's relationship was unfortunately turbulent from the beginning – so much so that a reality TV miniseries was released just one year after they married, and it was called Britney and Kevin: Chaotic.\n\nThe show explored the ins and outs of Spears and Federline's time together, from their courtship to their impromptu marriage.\n\nDuring that time, Federline was vilified for his relationship with the singer as he'd allegedly left his ex-girlfriend, Shar Jackson, while she was pregnant with their second child.\n\nSpears would later tell The Telegraph in 2013 that the series \"was probably the worst thing I’ve done in my career\".\n\nIn September 2005, the couple welcomed their first son, Sean Preston who is now 16. Around a year later, in 2006, they had Jayden James, now 15.\n\nWhen did Britney Spears and Kevin Federline split up?\n\nIn November 2006, just eight weeks after Jayden James' arrival, Spears (then 24) filed for divorce. She cited irreconcilable differences.\n\n\"We’re an opposites-attract,\" Federline told People just days before the divorce announcement. \"If she gets mad, and she yells at me, it just turns me on more, ya know?\"\n\nA few months later, in March 2007, the pair had initially settled their divorce while still continuing joint legal and physical custody of their two children.\n\nBy June though, reports emerged that Federline had been refusing to sign the papers over growing concerns for Spears' erratic behaviour. At that time, the singer had just begun a rehab stint, where she stayed for four weeks.\n\nTheir divorce was finalised that July, and they agreed to share custody of their sons. Not too long after, Spears' financial assets were entered into an infamous court-ordered conservatorship.\n\nThe pair remained committed co-parents, with Federline telling People in 2008: \"Britney is an awesome [mum]. That’s one thing I never really have to worry about.\n\n\"It’s good for the kids to see that Daddy does care about [Mummy], and [Mummy] does care about Daddy.\"\n\nFederline went on to make many more comments in support of his ex-wife, before asking for more child support payments in 2018. At the time he was reportedly receiving US$20,000 a month. She was also supposedly paying for their son's school fees.\n\nAccording to the court documents, the former dancer claimed he made less than one per cent of what Spears does.\n\n\"We think the reasonable needs for the children while they would be in Kevin’s custody is probably three times what he’s currently receiving,\" Federline’s attorney Mark Vincent Kaplan told People at the time.\n\nAfter months of court discussions, Spears agreed to pay Federline \"thousands more a month in child support\".\n\nWhere are Britney Spears and Kevin Federline now?\n\nSince then, Spears has had her conservatorship dissolved, she's gotten married and she's made countless claims against her family after years of being silenced.\n\nFederline has found love again with Victoria Federline (they wed in 2013) and has had two more children; Jordan and Peyton.\n\nIn a recent interview, Federline made some major claims.\n\nHe told the Daily Mail that Spears hadn't seen her two sons in months.\n\n\"The boys have decided they are not seeing her right now,\" he told the publication. \"It's been a few months since they've seen her. They made the decision not to go to her wedding.\"\n\nHe also went on to say that Spears' father, Jamie, \"saved\" her life by controlling her financials.\n\n\"I saw this man that really cared, and really cares about his family and wanting everything to be OK,\" he explained. \"When Jamie took over, things got into order. He saved her life.\"\n\nFederline also explained that their two kids have struggled with the details of the conservatorship.\n\n\"They've had a lot of questions about it,\" he said. \"I don't know that I can answer all of them for them but I just tried to explain to them that your mom needed help, you know, and the people were in play to try to make that happen, to make it better.\"\n\nHe added: \"This whole thing has been hard to watch, harder to live through, harder to watch my boys go through than anything else. It's been tough. It's the most challenging thing I've ever had to do in my life.\"\n\nSpears' nude photos, claims Federline, has been an issue for their two sons.\n\nListen to The Spill, Mamamia's daily entertainment podcast. Post continues after audio.\n\n\"I try to explain to them, 'Look, maybe that's just another way she tries to express herself.' But that doesn't take away from the fact of what it does to them. It's tough.\"\n\nHe added: \"I can't imagine how it feels to be a teenager having to go to high school.\"\n\nSpears responded on Instagram and slammed her ex-husband for \"discussing\" her private relationship with her sons.\n\n\"It saddens me to hear that my ex-husband has decided to discuss the relationship between me and my children,\" she wrote. \"As we all know, raising teenage boys is never easy for anyone.\"\n\n\"It concerns me the fact that the reason is based on my Instagram,\" she continued. \"It was LONG before Instagram. I gave them everything. Only one word: HURTFUL.\"\n\nSpears' current husband, Sam Asghari, also jumped to his wife's defence, writing: \"To clarify, my wife has never posted a nude selfie except of her butt, which is quite modest these days. All other posts were implied nudity, which can been seen in any ad for lotion or soap.\n\n\"There is no validity to his statement regarding the kids distancing themselves, and it is irresponsible to make that statement publicly,\" he continued.\n\n\"The boys are very smart and will be 18 soon to make their own decisions and may eventually realise the ‘tough’ part was having a father who hasn’t worked much in over 15 years as a role model.\"\n\nFeature Image: Getty / Mamamia.\n\nLooking forward to a brighter future?
