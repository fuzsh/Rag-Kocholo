        "text": "Sam Asghari (2022 - 2023)\n\nBritney Spears was linked to Sam Asghari after he appeared in her music video for “Slumber Party.” The two became engaged since September 2021 after five years of dating. Britney announced the engagement in an Instagram post on Sunday, September 12, 2021, after five years of dating. “I can’t fucking believe it 💍💍💍💍💍💍❣️!!!!!!” she captioned a video of her showing her ring before kissing her fiancé.\n\nBritney Spears and Sam Asghari married on June 9, 2022, at their Los Angeles home, according to People. Sources told the magazine that the guest list included star-studded friends like Madonna, Paris Hilton, Drew Barrymore and Selena Gomez. Spear’s father, mother, sister, and children did not attend the popstar’s third wedding, as per TMZ. “Britney walked herself down the aisle. She looked absolutely stunning in her main dress,” an insider told People. “She cried happy tears at some moments.”\n\nA year after their marriage, the two reportedly split. According to TMZ, thei Sam confronted Britney over rumors she stepped out on him.Sam has also reportedly moved out of their house and is now living in a place of his own. As one source put it, “It’s only a matter of time before Sam files for divorce.”\n\nTMZ first reported that Britney and Sam were on the rocks in June 2023. The site reported that Britney got in a physical fight with Sam and screaming matches were frequent. The site also reported that it became so “volatile,” security has had to step in.\n\nTMZ also reported in June 2022 that Britney and Sam signed a prenup stating that Sam wouldn’t receive any money Britney made before their wedding date if they divorced in the future.\n\nSam confirmed in an Instagram Story in September 2021 that he and Britney had plans to sign an “iron-clad prenup” after their engagement that month. His post came after thousands of fans, including actress Octavia Spencer, told Britney to sign a prenup before she married Sam. “Make him sign a prenup,” Octavia commented at the time on Britney’s engagement post. In response to the comments, Sam took to his Instagram to joke about how he and Britney planned to sign a prenup to “protect his jeep and shoe collection.” He wrote, “Thank you everyone who is concerned about The Prenup! Of course we’re getting [an] iron clad prenup to protect my jeep and shoe collection in case she dumps me one day.” He accompanied his post with two laughing emojis.\n\nHours after their split was reported, Sam Asghari filed for divorce from Britney Spears. According to TMZ, Sam is asking for spousal support and attorneys fees. The divorce documents reveal “[Sam] has yet to determine the full nature and extent of the separate property assets and obligations of each party.” The doc continued, “There are various items of community and quasi-community assets and debts, the full nature and extent of which are unknown to [Sam] at this time.”\n\nKevin Federline (2004 - 2007)\n\nBritney Spears and Kevin Federline were married from 2004 to 2007. The two met after they laid eyes on each other at the club. I met her at a club in Hollywood, Joseph’s. Our eyes met and that was it. We just hit it off right away,” the dancer recalled in 2008. “I was madly in love with her. Everything just seemed so right. I didn’t see it as too fast or too slow.”\n\nThey became engaged in July 2004 after three months of dating. In November 2006, Britney filed for divorce from Federline, citing irreconcilable differences and asking for both physical and legal custody of their two sons, with visitation rights for Federline. Their divorce was finalized in July 2007, however, in October 2007, a court ruled to grant Federline sole physical custody of their sons Jayden James and Sean Preston due to Britney’s “habitual, frequent and continuous use of controlled substances and alcohol” at the time, according to the judge.\n\nAround this time, Spears was placed under a conservatorship led by her dad, Jamie Spears, and her lawyer, Andrew Wallet. As conservators over Spears’ person and estate, her father and her attorney had access to her doctors and medical records, could limit who visits her and had control over the financial decisions she makes. After her conservatorship was created, Spears and Federline were back to 50/50 custody over their kids. However, their agreement changed again in September 2019, when K-Fed was given 70 percent custody, while Spears was given 30 percent unsupervised custodial rights, according to Us Weekly. That change was confirmed to Us Weekly in March 2021 after a source told the magazine that Spears sees her sons “less” after Federline altered their custody agreement.\n\nIn 2022, it was reported that her sons were estranged. Jayden James told the Daily Mail that he and his brother had a falling out with Spears. Federline said her nude selfies on social media were “tough” for the boys to deal with publicly. “I try to explain to them, ‘Look, maybe that’s just another way she tries to express herself.’ But that doesn’t take away from the fact of what it does to them. It’s tough.” He added: “I can’t imagine how it feels to be a teenager having to go to high school.”\n\nOn not attending her wedding to Asghari, Jayden James said: “At the time it just wasn’t a good time to go. I’m not saying that I’m not happy for her,” Jayden said. “I’m really happy for them, but she didn’t invite the whole family, and then if it was just going to be me and Preston, I just don’t see how that situation would have ended on good terms.” He continued that their relationship can “100% … be fixed. It’s just going to take a lot of time and effort. I just want her to get better mentally. When she gets better I really want to see her again.”\n\nHours after the interview was published, Spears replied in a statement on her Instagram, where she sent her son “all the love in the world to you every day for the rest of my life !!!!” She continued: “My love for my children has no boundaries and it deeply saddens me to know his outcry of saying I wasn’t up to his expectations of a mother … and maybe one day we can meet face to face and talk about this openly !!!!”\n\nFederline and his sons live in Hawaii after his current partner Victoria Prince, landed a job there. Federline’s attorney Mark Vincent Kaplan confirmed to Page Six that Spears had contact with her kids before they left for their new home.\n\nJason Alexander (2004)\n\nBritney Spears was married briefly (and we mean VERY briefly) to Jason Alexander in 2004. He was a childhood sweetheart and the two were married for 55 hours. “It was me being silly, being rebellious, and not really taking the responsibility of what I was doing, you know?” the “Baby…One More TIme” singer later told E! News. “And after partying, you know, you really don’t think about what you’re doing. So it was one of those things that were really silly.”\n\nDuring Spears’ wedding with Sam Asghari, Alexander crashed the nuptials with a knife in his hand hours before she walked down the aisle.\n\nBritney’s lawyer Matthew Rosengart told Page Six on June 10, 2022, “Fortunately, Alexander is incarcerated and under an emergency protective order. I want to thank Sergeant Cyrus Zadeh, Detective Ken Michaelson and the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office for their prompt and good work and look forward to working with law enforcement to ensure Alexander is aggressively prosecuted and hopefully convicted, as he should be.”\n\nAlexander “continuously trespassed” on Britney’s Thousand Oaks, California home, according to the legal documents, and had been advised Thursday that he was “not welcomed.” He appeared outside her home on June 9, 2022, with a knife in his hand and was live streaming the break-in on his Instagram, but he was apprehended before the ceremony. In a report obtained by Page Six, Spears’ ex-husband is ordered to stay away 100 feet from Spears and her husband, Sam Asghari. He also was arrested with $2,500 bail, as he also had an open warrant out for grand theft embezzlement and possession of stolen property, according to the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office. Bail was set at an additional $20,000 for those charges. Her attorney added, “This was an outrageous security breach, which I am livid about, but fortunately Britney is safe, and she was a stunning and happy bride.”"
