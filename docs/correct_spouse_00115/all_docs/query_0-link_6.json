        "text": "She’s stronger than yesterday.\n\nBritney Spears is back on the market after splitting from her third husband, Sam Asghari — and ending her subsequent romance with Paul Richard Soliz.\n\nThe “Toxic” hitmaker rose to fame in the late ’90s and has had several high profile relationship throughout her decades-long career.\n\nStep back in time as we dive into Spears’ complete dating history, from Justin Timberlake to Kevin Federline.\n\nJustin Timberlake\n\nSpears’ first high-profile relationship was with her “Mickey Mouse Club” co-star Justin Timberlake.\n\nThe it-couple started dating in 1998 and their four-year relationship gave us several iconic moments, including their double denim red carpet looks at the 2001 American Music Awards.\n\nEven their eventual split in 2002 made headlines after the former *NSYNC star released his hit “Cry Me a River.”\n\nThe music video for the song, and Timberlake’s behavior after their break up, led to speculation that Spears cheated on him.\n\nWhile the rumors were never substantiated, Timberlake finally faced backlash following the release of the 2021 documentary “Framing Britney Spears.”\n\nThe “Mirrors” singer later issued an apology to his ex, owning up to his “ignorance” surrounding the media treatment she faced following their split.\n\n“I’ve seen the messages, tags, comments, and concerns and I want to respond,” he wrote on Instagram in February 2021.\n\n“I am deeply sorry for the times in my life where my actions contributed to the problem, where I spoke out of turn, or did not speak up for what was right. I understand that I fell short in these moments and in many others and benefited from a system that condones misogyny and racism.”\n\nTwo years later, Spears looked back on their romance in her memoir, “The Woman in Me.”\n\nThe bombshell book made headlines for many revelations about Timberlake, including the actor urging her to get an abortion.\n\nWhile he has yet to react to the memoir, Timberlake did seemingly take a swipe at his ex before singing “Cry Me a River” at a January 2024 concert, saying he’d “like to take this opportunity to apologize to absolutely f–king nobody.”\n\nWade Robson\n\nWade Robson directed Spears’ 1999 and 2000 world tours, along with her “Dream Within a Dream” tour in 2001.\n\nThe famed choreographer, who also appeared in her “(You Drive Me) Crazy” video, is rumored to have secretly hooked up with the pop star while she was still dating Timberlake.\n\nThe couple are believed to have dated for about a year, with Spears confirming in her memoir that she cheated on Timberlake with Robson.\n\nHe went on to accuse Michael Jackson of sexually abusing him when he was seven years old in the 2019 documentary “Leaving Neverland.”\n\nColin Farrell\n\nSpears is believed to have met Colin Farrell when she visited the set of “S.W.A.T.” in early 2003, and fans were shocked when the odd couple attended the premiere of his film “The Recruit” in February of that year.\n\nAlthough they were pictured getting cozy in front of the cameras, the Irish actor made it clear they weren’t officially dating.\n\n“She’s just a mate,” he told Entertainment Tonight at the time. “Seriously, we just met a week ago, [we’re] having a laugh.”\n\nSpears, for her part, dished to W Magazine about their time together, confessing, “Yes, I kissed him … He’s the cutest, hottest thing in the world — wooh! … But it was nothing serious.”\n\nColumbus Short\n\nLater that year, Spears allegedly hooked up with her backup dancer Columbus Short.\n\nThe “Scandal” alum claimed in his 2020 autobiography, “Short Stories,” that a “wild party” in 2003 led to the intimate moment.\n\n“[Britney] sent us a jet, and just like that, we were in New York having a wild party for my 21st birthday,” he alleged.\n\n“We ended up being intimate that one time. I never slept with her again after that, though. This was a dangerous sexual alliance for every reason under sun, and I think that the worst part of it was that I was making the rumors an actual reality.”\n\nSpears has never addressed Short’s claims about their alleged hookup.\n\nJason Alexander\n\nSpears was infamously married to her first husband, Jason Alexander, for just 55 hours in 2004.\n\nThe “Gimme More” singer wed her childhood friend at the Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas after a big night of partying.\n\nHowever, they annulled their union shortly afterward.\n\nAlexander has continued talking about his ex-wife on social media and startled fans when he livestreamed himself breaking into her home hours before her June 2022 wedding to her third husband, Sam Asghari.\n\nHe has since moved on with Rebecca Bell, whom he wed in March 2023.\n\nKevin Federline\n\nLater that year, she announced her engagement to backup dancer Kevin Federline.\n\nThe pair tied the knot in September 2004 and welcomed their sons, Sean Preston and Jayden, in September 2005 and 2006, respectively.\n\nThe duo got divorced after three years of marriage and spent several years locked in a contentious custody battle that was further complicated by her controversial conservatorship.\n\nIn 2023, Federline relocated to Hawaii with his sons and his new wife, Victoria Prince, after she landed a job on the island.\n\nJ.R. Rotem\n\nSpears began dating music producer J.R. Rotem shortly after her divorce from Federline in 2007.\n\nThe romance was brief and he later claimed he didn’t want “to be tied down,” per Hollywood.com.\n\nAdnan Ghalib\n\nSpears met Adnan Ghalib in late 2007, shortly after shaving her head and hitting a paparazzo’s car with an umbrella.\n\nBizarrely, the pair began dating in 2008 after he helped her at a gas station while she was being hounded by fellow photographers.\n\nIn the 2021 Netflix documentary “Britney vs Spears,” the British paparazzo recalled their year-long romance.\n\n“It was a very simple, very easy relationship, you know? But between her fans and everybody else, it was like I was the bad guy,” he said.\n\nThe couple split in 2008 after the pop star was allegedly shown proof that he planned to pull a pregnancy test-buying stunt for publicity.\n\nJason Trawick\n\nIn 2009, Spears began one of her most stable relationships to date with her former manager, Jason Trawick.\n\nThe pair started dating in April of that year and got engaged in December 2011.\n\nHowever, they never made it down the aisle, announcing in January 2013 that they had broken up and mutually called off their engagement.\n\nDuring their relationship, Trawick briefly had a role as a co-conservator of Britney, alongside her father, Jamie Spears, and attorney Andrew Wallet.\n\nDavid Lucado\n\nTwo months after she split from her ex-fiancé, Britney started dating lawyer David Lucado.\n\nThe relationship, which began in March 2013, lasted just over one year, until the “Stronger” singer discovered he allegedly cheated on her.\n\nAccording to TMZ, she learned of the existence of a video showing Lucado “making out with a woman and dancing with her.”\n\nBritney later confirmed the breakup on Twitter, writing in 2014, “Ahhhh the single life!”\n\nCharlie Ebersol\n\nIn October 2014, Britney began dating Charlie Ebersol, the son of “Saturday Night Live” co-creator Dick Ebersol.\n\n“I thought he was really adorable,” she told People in 2015.\n\n“There was something about him that made me feel really peaceful and at ease,” she went on.\n\n“And he was really hot, too.
