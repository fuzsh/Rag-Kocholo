        "text": "Britney Spears’ husband Sam Asghari has slammed her ex Kevin Federline as he waded into the ongoing feud with him and her kids.\n\nThe personal trainer accused the father of Britney’s teenage boys, Sean Preston, 16, and Jayden, 15, of being a “professional baby daddy”.\n\nHe hurled the insult after the pop star’s youngest son Jayden hit out at his mum in recent interviews.\n\nBoth boys have chosen to live with their father, former backup dancer Kevin, and his new wife Victoria Prince.\n\nIn an upcoming ITV interview Jayden will claim he hadn’t seen his mother in months, chose not to go to her wedding in July and accuse her of not loving her and Preston equally.\n\nHer boys have also said they are embarrassed by racy photos their mum often posts on Instagram for her 42 million followers to see.\n\nGet all the biggest showbiz news straight to your inbox. Sign up for the free Mirror Showbiz newsletter.\n\nTaking to the social media app, Britney posted a lengthy post saying she was “deeply saddened” by Jayden’s comments.\n\nAnd she hit out at ex Kevin, who she was married to from 2004 to 2007, accusing him of “smoking weed every day” and not having a job in the past 15 years.\n\nThe singer, who has just released a new song with Elton John, also touched upon Jayden's comments about her mental health after he said the pair can meet up \"when she gets better.\"\n\nShe responded by telling Jayden to “learn to pick up a book and read one” before discussing how she is and told him to tell his dad to \"at least mow the lawn\".\n\nThe comment prompted new hubby Sam to pop up in the comments section to say: \"Mowing the lawn> professional baby daddy.\"\n\nThe Toxic singer wrote: \"I've tried my best at being the best person I can be... to be basically held hostage in homes under nurses and bulls*** I hope my kids one day understand my reasoning of my play in water revealing myself as any woman would being held under blankets and supervision under the conservatorship!!!\n\n\"Finally at 40 without the restraints of what my family did to me ... I say to my son Jayden that I send all the love in the world to you every day for the rest of my life!!!\n\n“My love for my children has no boundaries and it deeply saddens me to know his outcry of saying I wasn't up to his expectations of a mother... and maybe one day we can meet face to face and talk about this openly!!”\n\nBritney continued: “Maybe dear child YOU can explain to me why our family would do that to anyone!!!\n\n“I helped your father who hasn’t had a job in 15 years... I assume it’s easier for you guys not to have someone check on you to make sure you’ve done your homework!!!\n\n“I’m sure the standards of your dad smoking weed every day benefits your daily life at 15 and 16 to partake in a VERY COOL GENERATION!!!”\n\nThe star explained: “I completely understand your need to live with your father as I had to play the perfect role for 15 years for absolutely nothing.\n\n“I’m so happy I was able to carry 4 tours, judge X Factor and WAAAY more... I did that for you....\n\n“It’s horrible to see your dad be a hypocrite and say the media is horrible yet he has you talking about personal matters to them!!!”\n\nAsking her sons to “pause for a second” she said they will always be her children and urged them to “look in the mirror and remember where you came from”.\n\nAddressing the comments about her mental health, she added: “My dear child understand you must learn to pick up a book and read before you resort to even thinking about my intellect sweetheart!!! Tell your father to go try and at least mow the lawn...\n\n“Psss if you can honestly sit back and say with your sensible brilliant mind that what memaw and paw paw did to me was fine and call them not bad people... then yes I have failed as a mother and hopefully that’s a chat for you and your father to sit face to face and try to learn WHAT’S GOOD.”"
