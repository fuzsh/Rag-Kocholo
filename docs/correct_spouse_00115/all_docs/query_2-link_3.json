        "text": "FORMER backup dancer, Kevin Federline, became a household name due to his whirlwind relationship with Britney Spears.\n\nFollowing their divorce in 2007, Federline remarried Victoria Prince.\n\nWho is Kevin Federline's wife?\n\nKevin Federline has been married to Victoria Prince since 2013.\n\nPrince, who was born on December 2, 1982, in Richland, Washington, is known for her volleyball career.\n\nAfter high school, she played collegially at Washington State University but ultimately transferred to the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where she obtained a bachelor of arts degree in speech, according to PEOPLE.\n\nOver the years, her skills have been well documented, and she even competed against Olympians Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh. Outside of volleyball, she is known for her career as a special education teacher.\n\nHow did Kevin and Victoria meet?\n\nFederline's previous relationships revolved around celebrities, causing many fans to wonder how he ended up with a small-town girl like Prince.\n\nWell, like Prince's origins, their dating history actually began at a small-town bowling league.\n\nAccording to PEOPLE, the two met in a bowling league back in 2008\n\nAt the time, a source told the media outlet that Federline “always pays” after their games and that they are \"definitely a couple.\"\n\n\"I have seen them kiss, but they both seem focused on the bowling,\" the source added.\n\nAfter that, the two were spotted on several dates that ranged from bowling to grabbing drinks from Starbucks and partying at nightclubs in Las Vegas.\n\nDo Kevin and Victoria have any children together?\n\nSince the couple started dating, Federline and Prince have welcomed two children together, Jordan Kay and Peyton Marie.\n\nAt this time, it is unclear if the pair have any plans to welcome more children.\n\nFederline, however, is also the father of four additional children.\n\nHe also shares sons, Kori Madison and Kaleb Michael, with actress and singer, Shar Jackson.\n\nDuring Federline's previous marriage to Spears, he welcomed Sean Preston, 17, and Jayden James, 16.\n\nOn May 16, 2023, TMZ reported that his two sons, whom he shares with Spears, want to move to Hawaii with him and leave Los Angeles behind.\n\nSources told the outlet, Federline's attorney, Mark Vincent Kaplan, has sent Britney's lawyer, Mathew Rosengart, a letter asking if the popstar would be open to having her Jayden and Sean relocate to Hawaii full-time by July.\n\nIt is unclear if Spears will go through with the move or what her reaction to the news has been."
