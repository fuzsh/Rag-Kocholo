        "text": "But what do we know about Federline’s second wife – and what happened to Spears’ and Federline’s kids?\n\nVictoria Prince is a former volleyball player ...\n\nThe Washington-born sportswoman played volleyball in high school before going on to compete during her university years, according to People.\n\nThe magazine also reported that she studied at Washington State University before transferring to the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The athlete has even competed against Olympians Kerri Walsh and Misty May-Treanor.\n\n... who is now a teacher\n\nHola reported that Prince is currently a special education teacher, who previously graduated with a bachelor’s degree in speech. She also co-founded the School Box Club, which supplies educational tools for kids by subscription, per the same source.\n\nOne big, blended family\n\nPrince and Federline share two children together, Jordan and Peyton. The former backup dancer’s wife is a stepmum to his other four children too: Kori and Kaleb, from his relationship with ex Shar Jackson; and Sean and Jayden, from his marriage to Spears.\n\nHow did Victoria Prince and Kevin Federline meet?\n\nFederline had an extremely high-profile romance with Spears, but his second marriage has been much more low-key, which is hardly surprising, as Prince isn’t a pop star or celebrity.\n\nSo how did they meet? According to People, the two met for the first time in 2008, at a bowling alley, a year after Federline and Spears’ divorce was finalised. They got married in 2013, with a surprise ceremony in Las Vegas, according to Hola.\n\nHas Britney Spears met Prince?\n\nAccording to Insider, Spears and Federline met in the summer of 2004 and married later that same year. The couple went on to have two children together, Sean Preston, now 17, and Jayden James, now 16.\n\nThe same source confirmed that Spears met her ex’s new romance in 2013, though it’s unclear what their relationship is like now.\n\nAccording to People, Spears approved Federline’s request to bring their kids with him to Hawaii, and TMZ previously reported that although Spears was already paying US$40,000 in child support, Federline was thinking of asking for more because he has the kids most the time.\n\nIn an interview with British media last year, Jayden spoke up in a rare interview about his mum: “I one hundred per cent think this can be fixed. It’s just going to take a lot of time and effort. I just want her to get better mentally,” he said. “When she gets better I really want to see her again.”"
