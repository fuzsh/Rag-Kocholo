        "text": "Britney Spears shades her ex-husband Kevin Federline’s failed attempt at making it as a rapper in her forthcoming memoir, “The Woman in Me.”\n\n“He was in the studio all the time. He really thought he was a rapper now. Bless his heart,” the “Toxic” singer savagely writes while reflecting on K-Fed taking his short-lived rap career “so seriously.”\n\nSpears, 41, also touches on the public “doubting” Federline’s musical talents during their marriage, adding, “I knew what that was like. It is scary to put yourself out there like that.”\n\nFederline, 45, notoriously debuted his first song, “Y’all Ain’t Ready,” in 2005 followed by the critically panned “Popozão.”\n\nHe then dropped his first — and only — album, “Playing with Fire,” in 2006.\n\nA Rolling Stone reviewer wrote that “Federline’s rhyme flow is the opposite of tight,” while a Slant Magazine critic opined that the album was “just as disposable and dumb as you’d expect.”\n\nMeanwhile, a Billboard writer jabbed, “In general, Federline enunciates well.”\n\nFederline’s music career was a far leap from Spears’ own success as a chart-topping pop superstar.\n\nThe Grammy winner and the former backup dancer married in October 2004.\n\nOver the course of their union, they welcomed two sons: Sean Preston, 18, and Jayden James, 17.\n\nThe pair announced their separation in November 2006 and finalized their divorce in July 2007.\n\nWhile the exes co-parented their children for years, Preston and Jayden lived with their father full-time during their mother’s fight to end her 13-year conservatorship in 2021.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nThe teens infamously did not attend Spears’ wedding to her now-estranged husband, Sam Asghari, in June 2022, as they were no longer on speaking terms.\n\nFederline moved to Hawaii with their kids this past August and subsequently demanded that Spears cough up more child support money.\n\nDespite her years-long estrangement from her boys, Page Six exclusively reported that the “Stronger” singer dedicated her memoir to them.\n\nK-Fed’s lawyer recently told us that Preston and Jayden began texting their mom again prior to moving to the Aloha State.\n\nFederline has been married to former volleyball player Victoria Prince since August 2013. They have two children of their own.\n\nSpears’ book, which hits stores on Oct. 24, promises to spill serious tea about her family drama and past relationships."
