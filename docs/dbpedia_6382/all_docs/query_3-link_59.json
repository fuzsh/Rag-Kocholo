        "text": "The first solo female author to win the Royal Society's prestigious Winton Prize says she hopes her victory is a \"sign of a more level playing field\" for all writers.\n\nGaia Vince, a journalist specialising in science, the environment and social issues, was awarded the prize for Adventures in Anthropocene: A Journey to the Heart of the Planet we Made, an exploration of the Earth in 'a new age' dominated by our species.\n\nThe prize, which celebrates science writing for a non-specialist audience, has also been awarded to big names like Stephen Hawking, Bill Bryson and Jared Diamond over its 28 year history, but had only featured one woman on its prizewinners list -- Pat Shipman, co-author of The Wisdom of the Bones.\n\nAdventures in Anthropocene follows Vince's two-year journey across the planet as she explores how human behaviour has shaped the living planet and how these forces have changed our relationship with the natural world.\n\nAnthropocene posits that the world is currently entering a new epoch in which geological processes are primarily affected by human activity rather than other natural causes.\n\nVince told WIRED she was \"shocked and delighted\" to be awarded the prize. \"This book tells the story of remarkable women and men from remote parts of the world who are living at the frontline of humanity's planetary changes and dealing with the consequences in ingenious, inspiring ways,\" she said via email.\n\nVince quit her job as editor of Nature to travel the world for the book, meeting people whose lives and homes have been disrupted by geological disasters such as biodiversity loss, erratic weather, glacial melt and forced migrations -- and at one point even catching malaria herself. \"I hope this prize allows their stories to reach a wider audience, and reminds everyone that human brilliance is not just the product of famous scientists in big universities, but can come from the most surprising places.\" \"Women have long lagged behind men in being awarded literary prizes, but I'm hopeful that wins by me and other women are sign of a more level playing field being established for all writers\".\n\nJudges praised the book for highlighting the \"important urgency\" it used to advocate solutions to the geographic crises.\n\nThis article was originally published by WIRED UK\n\nHere’s What the Inside of an Airbus Factory Looks Like\n\nIn Hamburg, aviation giant Airbus is transforming aircraft production with state-of-the-art robotics technology on its planes. We go on a behind-the-scenes visit for the delivery of an A321neo.\n\nThe Green Economy Is Hungry for Copper—and People Are Stealing, Fighting, and Dying to Feed It\n\nWith the possible exception of gold, no other metal has caused as much destruction as copper. In the coming years, we’ll need more of it than ever.\n\nPromising Mpox Drug Fails in Trials as Virus Spreads\n\nIn a trial in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the drug tecovirimat, also known as TPOXX, was found to be no better than placebo at clearing mpox lesions.\n\nStruggling to Unlock Your Phone? You Might Have Lost Your Fingerprints\n\nThe absence of these identifying marks—which can be the result of excessive typing, manual work, chemotherapy, or sports—is becoming more of an issue in the age of biometrics.\n\nThe Cure for Disposable Plastic Crap Is Here—and It’s Loony\n\nStretchy seaweed, reverse vending machines, QR-coded take-out boxes: They’re how we can break society’s absurd addiction to single-use plastics.\n\nWill the ‘Car-Free’ Los Angeles Olympics Work?\n\nOrganizers of the 2028 Summer Games will attempt to re-create the city’s public transport heyday of the early 20th century, but ousting the car—even for just a few weeks—will be costly.\n\nSo You’re Underwater: Why Do You See That Circle of Light Above You?\n\nSnell’s window is one of the coolest phenomena in the natural world. You’ve seen it, but do you know what causes it?\n\nShe’s the New Face of Climate Activism—and She’s Carrying a Pickax\n\nSabotage. Property destruction. For Léna Lazare and her cohort, radicalized by years of inaction on the environmental crisis, these aren’t dirty words. They’re acts of joy."
