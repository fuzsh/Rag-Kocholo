        "text": "Professor Liu Xiaogang from the NUS Department of Chemistry has been named winner of the Royal Society of Chemistry’s Centenary Prize in recognition of brilliance in research and innovation. Prof Liu won the prize for outstanding contributions to the understanding and optical manipulation of photon conversion in nanocrystals and their applications in X-ray and light-field imaging, and for excellence in communication. He is the only winner from Asia and Singapore among this year’s three recipients.\n\nThe Royal Society of Chemistry’s prizes have recognised excellence in the chemical sciences for more than 150 years. The Centenary Prize, first established in 1947, is an award granted annually to outstanding chemists, who are also exceptional communicators, from outside the United Kingdom and Ireland. Winners are given a £5000 cash prize and a medal. This year’s winners join a prestigious list of past winners in the Royal Society of Chemistry’s prize portfolio, 60 of whom have gone on to win Nobel Prizes for their work, including 2022 Nobel laureate Carolyn Bertozzi and 2019 Nobel laureate John B Goodenough.\n\nProf Liu said, “I was both surprised and thrilled to receive this award. It’s truly humbling and an immense honour to be associated with the many previous winners of this award, all of whom I hold in great respect.”\n\nProf Liu’s research focuses on luminescent nanomaterials: tiny particles that emit light under specific lighting conditions. These particles are so small that thousands of them could fit across the width of a single hair.\n\nOne of Prof Liu’s most notable contributions is the development of new nanomaterials that glow in visible colours when exposed to invisible near-infrared light. This has profound implications, especially in the medical field. For example, these materials serve as advanced molecular probes that can track cancer cells, offering a more selective, sensitive, and cost-effective alternative to traditional biomarkers for cancer diagnosis.\n\nIn medical imaging, his team has devised new and safer X-ray imaging techniques that significantly enhance diagnostic and treatment guidance. They have also developed a prototype interactive mouthguard embedded with pressure-sensitive optical nanomaterials. By integrating these sensors into a flexible mouthguard, they have created a user-controlled device that operates through simple biting actions. This is a valuable advancement in assistive technology, making it easier for people with a disability or impairment to operate a computer, smartphone, or wheelchair.\n\nDr Helen Pain, Chief Executive of the Royal Society of Chemistry, said, “Our prize winners come from a vast array of backgrounds, all contributing in different ways to our knowledge-base, and bringing fresh ideas and innovations. We recognise chemical scientists from every career stage and every role type, including those who contribute to the RSC’s work as volunteers. We celebrate winners from both industry and academia, as well as individuals, teams, and the science itself. Their passion, dedication and brilliance are an inspiration. I extend my warmest congratulations to them all.”"
