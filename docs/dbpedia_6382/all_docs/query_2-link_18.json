        "text": "Our impact\n\nEstablished in 1987, highlights of The Sainsbury Laboratory include:\n\ndiscovery of RNA interference in plants by Prof. Sir David Baulcombe FRS as recognised by the Lasker Award and the Wolf Prize in Agriculture,\n\ndiscovery of the first immune receptor in plants by Prof. Jonathan Jones FRS,\n\nthree Group Leaders are Fellows of the Royal Society,\n\nfour Group Leaders have won multiple, prestigious European Research Council grants,\n\nfive researchers have been on the Highly Cited Researchers list of top 1% scientists in the world since 2018.\n\nHow do we impact the world?\n\nThe Sainsbury Laboratory has made major contributions to the fundamental understanding of plant diseases through ground-breaking discoveries in molecular plant-microbe interactions. These discoveries are taken from the laboratory to the field with the aim of reducing worldwide losses to crop diseases. Through the discovery, engineering and deployment of novel immune receptors in crops, as well as genome editing tools, we can enable the generation of novel alleles for crop improvement.\n\nSome of our revolutionary discoveries\n\nSmall interfering RNA – a change in the landscape of biotechnology\n\nWork by Professor (now Sir) David Baulcombe and colleagues in The Sainsbury Laboratory was pivotal in discovering small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and understanding the phenomenon of RNA interference (RNAi). Genetically engineered plants are increasingly used to over-express foreign genes, including those for pharmaceutically valuable polypeptides. However, expression of transgenes is repressed via RNAi, a system that probably evolved to combat viral pathogens. In response, viruses themselves encode a “silencing suppressor protein” that counteracts this defence response.\n\nIncreasing the yield of medically important proteins in plants by suppression of RNA silencing\n\nWe were able to exploit this phenomenon by introducing the suppressor gene into plants and improving them as hosts for transgene expression. These contributions not only revolutionised understanding of fundamental processes, from cancer to viral infections, but have already underpinned significant economic impacts. RNAi Suppression Technology was patented worldwide and licensed for fees >£500k to several companies, including Medicago, that use it to generate plants that effectively produce pharmaceuticals.\n\nDiscovery and exploitation of Resistance (R) genes in agriculture\n\nThrough the development of novel approaches in genetics and immune receptor discovery, Prof Jonathan Jones and colleagues have developed late blight (Phytophthora infestans) resistant potato cultivars, tested these in UK fields, and developed commercial crops through partnership with SimPlot, a US-based potato breeding company.\n\nRead more about the project here.\n\nImproving global crop disease diagnosis to reduce economic loss and improve food security\n\nThe research from Professor Sophien Kamoun’s group resulted in novel genomics-based tools Field Pathogenomics (sequencing technology), and OpenWheatBlast (a web platform) that enabled the rapid and accurate diagnosis of a specific strain of devastating wheat blast, originating from wheat imported from South America. Field Pathogenomics has subsequently diagnosed further crop disease outbreaks. The impact of this research was:\n\nImmediate changes to farming practice in affected areas in Bangladesh preventing most severe crop losses and minimising the consequent humanitarian and societal disaster;\n\nRapidly improved biosecurity measures that included capacity building in Bangladesh and more globally (Australia, Ethiopia, Europe, India and the UK) to alleviate yield and associated economic losses, by preventing the further spread of emerging crop diseases, such as wheat blast.\n\nRead more about the project here."
