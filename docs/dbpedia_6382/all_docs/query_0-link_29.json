        "text": "£2 billion needed for science ’Grand Challenge’ to help feed the world\n\nThe Royal Society, the UK's national academy of science, is calling for a £2 billion \"Grand Challenge\" research programme on global food security. A report[1] published today (21 October 2009) says that the UK should lead international research efforts if we are to achieve the massive increase in food crop production (at least 50 percent) that will be required by 2050 to meet global food demands without damaging the environment.\n\nPredictions now put the world's population at 9 billion[2] people by 2050. The Royal Society emphasises the urgency of the challenge. Changing consumption patterns, the impacts of climate change and growing scarcity of water and land make the challenge of increasing agricultural yields worldwide even greater. Crop production methods will need to sustain the environment, preserve natural resources and support the livelihoods of farmers and rural populations around the world. The report examines the vital role that biological science, especially publicly-funded science, must play to intensify food crop production in a sustainable way.\n\nProfessor Sir David Baulcombe FRS, who chaired the Royal Society's study, said:\n\n\"We need to take action now to stave off food shortages. If we wait even five to ten years, it may be too late. Biological science has progressed in leaps and bounds in the last decade and UK scientists have been at the head of the pack when it comes to topics related to food crops. In the UK we have the potential to come up with viable scientific solutions for feeding a growing population and we have a responsibility to realise this potential. There's a very clear need for policy action and publicly-funded science to make sure this happens.\"\n\nThe Royal Society says that implementing a research programme that directs at least £200 million in funding annually for the next ten years to science that improves crops and sustainable crop management must be a Government priority. This would see the addition of at least £50 million to what is already spent on science for food-crops each year. The \"Grand Challenge\" programme should support areas of research that have been neglected in recent years including exploring new methods of crop management to increase yields and minimise environmental impact. It should also support the development of improved crop varieties by both conventional breeding and genetic modification.\n\nThe programme would be developed by Research Councils UK (RCUK) and bring together all research councils, the Technology Strategy Board, the Department for International Development (DFID) and the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA).\n\nThe report describes recent advances in research methods including the ability to determine the complete genome sequence of crop plants. It also assesses a wide range of science-based technologies and developments in biological science that are seen to have potential benefits for increasing crop yields. It also lays out the consequences and complications of innovation in food crops, taking into account environmental, social and economic perspectives. The range of possible solutions will be likely to make a difference across different timescales.\n\nExamples discussed in the report include:\n\n- Short-term (less than 8 years): New approaches to crop management including modified irrigation regimes, seed treatments to protect against pests and diseases and agroecological approaches which manage the interactions between plants, animals, microorganisms and the physical environment within agricultural systems. For example, the push-pull' system for pest management in maize crops. The maize field is surrounded by a border of Napier grass which is more attractive to moths than the maize for laying their eggs. In addition, rows of maize are intercropped with rows of the forage legume silverleaf which repels stemborer moths away from maize.\n\n- Medium-term (9-16 years): Breeding and GM of new varieties of crops that are resistant to disease, drought, salinity, heat and toxic heavy metals. In Australia, new varieties of wheat with high water use efficiency have shown yield increases of 10 15%.\n\n- Longer-term (more than 16 years) : The development of nitrogen fixing cereals which will need less fertiliser, perennial crops which won't need constant replanting and C4 rice which would boost the efficiency of photosynthesis and dramatically increase yield."
