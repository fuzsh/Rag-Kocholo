Download diversity data for our 2022 prizes.\n\nInclusion & diversity in the chemical sciences\n\nAs a professional and membership body, and a leading voice for the chemistry community, we have a responsibility to ensure that chemistry is for everyone.\n\nOur Inclusion and Diversity Strategy to 2025 is pushing us further than before to increase the diversity of people choosing the chemical sciences and fulfilling their potential for a truly inclusive community. This will – in time – be reflected in the diversity of our prize programme."
