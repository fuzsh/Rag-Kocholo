        "text": "DAVID BAULCOMBE SPEAKING ON\n\nDavid Baulcombe, currently Royal Society Research Professor and Regius Professor of Botany at the University of Cambridge, plant scientist and genetics. He earned his B.Sc. in botany from the University of Leeds and Ph.D. from the University of Edinburgh. He did his post-doctoral fellow in North America at McGill University and at the University of Georgia. After three years he came back to Cambridge (UK) to the Plant Breeding Institute where he held a position of Principal Scientific Officer. In 1988 David Baulcobme moved to Norwich and joined Sainsbury Laboratory. He discovered there the small interfering RNA with Andrew Hamilton. His labolatory proved that small interfering RNAs are the determining factor in the specificity of RNA-mediated gene silencing. He was a Head of Laboratory from 1990 till 1993 and from 1999 till 2003. In 2007 he became the Professor of Botany at Cambridge University as a Royal Society Research Professor.\n\nHe has been awarded the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences' M. W. Beijerinck Virology Prize (2004), the Royal Society's Royal Medal (2006). In 2009 he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II Birthday Honours List for services to plant science. He is a member of EMBO."
