        "text": "Ben Schumann, Group Leader of the Chemical Glycobiology Laboratory at the Crick and Senior Lecturer in the Department of Chemistry at Imperial College London, has been named winner of the Royal Society of Chemistry’s prestigious Norman Heatley Award in recognition of brilliance in research and innovation.\n\nBen's lab uses biorthogonal chemistry - synthetic 'precision tools' - to study how carbohydrates are incorporated into proteins inside a cell. Find out more about Ben's research here.\n\nBen was awarded the prize for the creative use of chemistry-centred tools to provide valuable insights into glycan biology.\n\nEvery living cell in our bodies is covered by a layer of sugars that is normally the first thing a virus, bacterium or neighbouring cell interacts with. The structure of these sugars changes when a cell alters its connections with the environment – for instance, when developing into a tumour.\n\nUnderstanding how these processes happen is essential to make better drugs and diagnostic markers for cancer. A technique called ‘bioorthogonal chemistry’ can be used to chemically modify the basic units of carbohydrates and track how they are incorporated into proteins, without disrupting the normal functions of a cell.\n\nBen and his team use biorthogonal chemistry to develop molecules that tell us exactly how sugar-binding enzymes work – what they do and which sugars they build. Since many of these enzymes are important in diseases such as neuronal disorders or cancer, the team’s chemical tools are a promising means of understanding what goes wrong in these conditions.\n\nBen said: “I am super excited – it is such an honour to receive the Heatley Award, and I would like to thank the Royal Society of Chemistry. Our work would not be possible without generations of great chemists and biologists who brought the glycosciences to where they are now. A lot of them are close friends, colleagues and mentors. It is also clear that we are only scratching the surface, and I am fortunate to be working with a great team to train the next generation!”\n\nThe Norman Heatley award, which includes £3000 and a medal, is part of a portfolio of prizes from the Royal Society of Chemistry.\n\nHelen Pain, Chief Executive of the Royal Society of Chemistry, said: “The chemical sciences cover a rich and diverse collection of disciplines, from fundamental understanding of materials and the living world to applications in medicine, sustainability, technology and more. By working together across borders and disciplines, chemists are finding solutions to some of the world’s most pressing challenges.\n\n“Our prize winners come from a vast array of backgrounds, all contributing in different ways to our knowledge-base and bringing fresh ideas and innovations. We recognise chemical scientists from every career stage and every role type, including those who contribute to the RSC’s work as volunteers. We celebrate winners from both industry and academia, as well as individuals, teams, and the science itself."
