Each year the Royal Society recognizes excellence in science and technology through its medals, awards and prize lectures and the election of new Fellows. Fellows are elected through a peer review process. The main criterion for election as a Fellow is scientific excellence. The following LMB scientists have been recognized by the Royal Society through election to the Fellowship and through various medals, awards and prize lectures. All the citations for awards, medals and prize lectures have been copied from the Royal Society website.\n\nFellows\n\nPresidents\n\nMedals\n\nPrize Lectures\n\nAwards\n\nSummer Science
