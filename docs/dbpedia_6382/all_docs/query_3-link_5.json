Each year the Royal Society recognizes excellence in science and technology through its medals, awards and prize lectures and the election of new Fellows. Fellows are elected through a peer review process. The main criterion for election as a Fellow is scientific excellence. The following LMB scientists have been recognized by the Royal Society through election to the Fellowship and through various medals, awards and prize lectures. All the citations for awards, medals and prize lectures have been copied from the Royal Society website.\n\nFellows\n\nPresidents\n\nMedals\n\nPrize Lectures\n\nAwards\n\nSummer Science

2015 – 2020\n\nAaron Klug\n\n1995 – 2000\n\nMedals\n\nCopley Medal Winners\n\n2020 – Alan Fersht for developing and applying the methods of protein engineering to provide descriptions of protein folding pathways at atomic resolution, revolutionising our understanding of these processes.\n\n2016 – Richard Henderson In recognition of his fundamental and revolutionary contributions to the development of electron microscopy of biological materials, enabling their atomic structures to be deduced.\n\n2012 – John Walker For his ground-breaking work on bioenergetics, discovering the mechanism of ATP synthesis in the mitochondrion.\n\n1997 – Hugh Huxley In recognition of his pioneering work on the structure of muscle and on the molecular mechanisms of muscle contraction, providing solutions to one of the great problems in physiology.\n\n1991 – Sydney Brenner In recognition of his many contributions to molecular genetics and developmental biology, and his recent role in the Human Genome mapping project.\n\n1989 – César Milstein In recognition of his outstanding contributions to immunology, in particular to the discovery of monoclonal antibodies and to the understanding of the role of somatic mutations in the maturation of the immune response.\n\n1985 – Aaron Klug In recognition of his outstanding contributions to our understanding of complex biological structures and the methods used for determining them.\n\n1979 – Max Perutz In recognition of his distinguished contributions to molecular biology through his own studies of the structure and biological activity of haemoglobin and his leadership in the development of the subject.\n\n1977 – Fred Sanger In recognition of his distinguished work on the chemical structure of proteins and his studies on the sequences of nucleic acids.\n\n1975 – Francis Crick In recognition of his elucidation of the structure of DNA and his continuing contribution to molecular biology.\n\nRoyal Medal\n\n2019 – Michel Goedert For his work on neurodegenerative diseases, especially for identifying and characterising key molecules that form the inclusions of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.\n\n2011 – Greg Winter
