        "text": "On Friday the 26th, the Spanish Royal Society of Chemistry (RSEQ) announced their accolades for the year, awarding Prof. Ruben Martín’s contributions and dedication to the field of chemistry. The RSEQ Medal serves as a testament to his impact to advancing scientific knowledge, specifically in the study of chemical reactions and catalysis.\n\nProf. Martín’s career has been marked by prolific publications in scientific journals, advancing the understanding and application of chemistry. His research primarily focuses on exploring novel methodologies for organic synthesis and catalysis, emphasizing the synthesis of complex molecules and sustainable chemical processes.\n\nIn this year’s edition, two ICIQ Alumni have been recognized with Postdoctoral Researcher – Young Researcher Award. Dr. Mauro Mato and Dr. Andreu Tortajada exemplify the exceptional training and mentorship provided by ICIQ.\n\nDr. Mauro Mato, formerly a Summer Fellow, Master’s student, and PhD student in the Prof. Echavarren’s Group, is now Postdoctoral Researcher at the Max-Planck-Institut für Kohlenforschung. Similarly, Andreu Tortajada, who began his journey as a Summer Fellow, continued as a Master’s student, and completed his PhD under the guidance of Prof. Ruben Martín, is currently contributing as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Universität Bern.\n\nTheir achievements reflect the excellence fostered at ICIQ, and we extend our warmest congratulations to Dr. Andreu Tortajada and Dr. Mauro Mato for their well-deserved recognition.\n\nThe RSEQ is a prestigious organization dedicated to promoting and advancing the field of chemistry in Spain, awards the Medal annually to individuals who have made lasting impacts through their research. For more information about the Spanish Royal Society of Chemistry, please visit their website at www.rseq.org.\n\nAbout Prof. Ruben Martín Romo\n\nRuben Martin was born in Barcelona in 1976. He received his Ph.D in 2003 at the Universitat de Barcelona with Prof. Antoni Riera, working on the total synthesis of glycosidases inhibitors.\n\nIn January 2004 he moved to the Max-Planck-Institut für Kohlenforschung as a Humboldt postdoctoral fellow with Prof. Alois Fürstner, where he worked on the application of novel iron catalysts for cross-coupling and Alder-ene type reactions.\n\nIn May 2005 he undertook further postdoctoral studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a MEC postdoctoral fellow with Prof. Stephen L. Buchwald where he developed new synthetic strategies for metal-catalyzed C-C and C-N bond-forming reactions.\n\nIn September 2008 he joined the ICIQ as a group leader. His current research interests concern the discovery and development of synthetically useful organometallic methodologies. Rubén Martín was promoted to Associate Professor in July 2013.In october 2013, he became ICREA (Catalan Institution of Research and Advanced Studies) Research Professor.\n\nDuring his time at ICIQ, he has received the 2010 RSEQ Young Investigator Award, 2011 Thieme Chemistry Journal Award, 2011 Eli Lilly Young Research Investigator Award, 2015 RSEQ Excellent Research Award, 2011 ERC Starting Grant, 2017 Marcial Moreno Lectureship Award, 2017 OMCOS Award, 2017 Liebig-Lectureship Award, 2018 Pharmaron Lectureship Award, 2018 Bristol-Myers-Squibb Lectureship Award, 2018 Genentech Lectureship Award, 2018 ChemSocRev Pioneering Investigator Award, 2018 Hirata Award, 2018 IOCF Lectureship Award, 2018 Banc Sabadell Award to Sciences and Engineering, 2019 ParazaPharma Lectureship Award, 2019 Boehringer Ingelheim Award, 2019 MIT/Merck Lectureship Award, 2019 Novartis Chemistry Lectureship Award and 2020 Arthur C. Cope Scholar Award."
