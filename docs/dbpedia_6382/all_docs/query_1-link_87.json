        "text": "1. INTRODUCTION\n\nRNA has gained prominence due to its versatile nature—RNA can possess enzymatic activity, adopt multiple structural conformations with impacts on function, and sense environmental factors such as heat or pH as well as metabolites. The advent of the first mRNA vaccines for COVID‐19 shows how invaluable RNA research can be to providing solutions for modern problems. The 23rd Penn State Symposium in Plant Biology was held May 18–20, 2022, at the University Park campus of The Pennsylvania State University. It gathered RNA aficionados to share their exciting, new discoveries in plant RNA biology. This conference featured over 100 participants, and research spanning 20 countries, as well as 24 states within the United States.\n\nIn this meeting report, we describe research that was presented on RNA processing that occurs within the cell, such as alternative splicing, noncanonical RNA caps and RNA editing, RNA turnover, and RNA‐directed regulation of transcription and translation. We delve into new insights regarding short and long noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in epigenetic reprograming. Finally, we discuss the RNA‐based tool CRISPR, RNA sensing of environmental responses via RNA modification and structure, and RNA interactions outside the cell through its role in trans‐kingdom communication utilizing small RNAs (sRNAs)."
