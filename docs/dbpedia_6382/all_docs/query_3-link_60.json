It exists to expand the frontiers of knowledge by championing the development and use of science, mathematics, engineering and medicine for the benefit of humanity and the good of the planet.\n\nThe Society promotes access to the best science internationally, seeks to reduce the scientific imbalance between rich and poor countries, and supports environmental research programmes throughout the world.\n\nAs a learned society, the Society publishes ten high-impact, peer-reviewed journals, including Philosophical Transactions, the world’s oldest scientific title, first published in 1665. Two of the journals are fully open access.\n\nThroughout its history, the Royal Society has promoted excellence in science through its Fellowship and Foreign Membership, which has included Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Ernest Rutherford, Albert Einstein, Dorothy Hodgkin, Francis Crick, James Watson and Stephen Hawking."
