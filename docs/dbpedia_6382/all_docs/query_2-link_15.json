        "text": "Bio-bibliography\n\nUK\n\nDavid Baulcombe\n\n2012 Balzan Prize for Epigenetics\n\nFor his fundamental contribution to the understanding of epigenetics and its role in cell and tissue development under normal and stressful conditions.\n\nDavid Charles Baulcombe, born in Solihull, Warwickshire on 7 April 1952, is a British citizen.\n\nRegius Professor of Botany, Royal Society Research Professor and Head of the Department of Plant Sciences, at the University of Cambridge.\n\nHe received his B.Sc. (Botany) from the University of Leeds in 1973 and his Ph.D. (Botany) from the University of Edinburgh in 1977. After 4 years as a post-doctoral fellow in North America, first at McGill University, Montreal, Canada (1977-1978) and then at the University of Georgia, USA (1978-1980) he joined the Plant Breeding Institute in Cambridge UK, in 1980, where he held initially the position of Higher Scientific Officer, and then (1986-1988) that of Principal Scientific Officer. He joined the Sainsbury Laboratory in Norwich as a Senior Research Scientist in 1988, and also served as Head of Laboratory between 1990-1993 and 1999-2003. He was appointed Honorary Professor at the University of East Anglia in 1998, and given a full professorship there in 2002. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2001 and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2009. He is also a Member of the Academia Europaea, Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and a Foreign Associate Member of the US National Academy of Sciences.\n\nHe took up his current position in the University of Cambridge in 2007.\n\nAmong his most important publications, we would mention:\n\n– Shivaprasad, P.V.; Dunn, R.M.; Santos B.A.; Bassett A.; Baulcombe D.C.
