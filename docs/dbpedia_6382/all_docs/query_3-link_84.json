        "text": "Professor Anna Slater, Royal Society University Research Fellow with the University’s Department of Chemistry, has been awarded the Royal Society of Chemistry’s Harrison-Mendola Memorial Prize in recognition of brilliance in research and innovation.\n\nProfessor Slater won the prize for the development of innovative tools, particularly flow chemistry processes, to control the formation of supramolecular materials.\n\nShe joins a prestigious list of past winners in the RSC’s prize portfolio, 60 of whom have gone on to win Nobel Prizes for their work.\n\nProfessor Slater said: “I am honoured to be awarded the Harrison-Meldola Memorial Prize. I am so proud of our team and all their efforts; this is a recognition of their work, especially given the challenges of the last few years. I am also very grateful to the many people who’ve supported us – interdisciplinary, collaborative, supportive teams are so important for science.”\n\nProfessor Slater’s research group develops techniques, such as flow chemistry, to make the discovery of new, sustainable materials more efficient and chemistry reaction processes more reliable, sustainable, and scalable. As a result, the time it takes to get materials out of the lab and into wider use is shortened. The group also works with industry to use these techniques for existing processes, aiming to reduce waste and energy usage, and improve efficiency.\n\nDr Helen Pain, Chief Executive of the Royal Society of Chemistry, said: “The chemical sciences are at the forefront of tackling a range of challenges facing our world. From fundamental chemistry to cutting-edge innovations, the work that chemical scientists do has an important role to play in building our future.\n\n“The RSC’s prizes programme enables us to reflect on and celebrate the incredible individuals and teams whose brilliance enriches our knowledge, advances our understanding, and brings new ideas and technologies that benefit society as a whole. We’re very proud to recognise the contributions of our winners today.”"
