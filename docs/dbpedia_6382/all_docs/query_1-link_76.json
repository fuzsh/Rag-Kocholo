        "text": "After considerable debate agreement was reached to found the ‘John Innes Horticultural Institution’, its purpose ‘to carry out investigation and research whether of a scientific or practical nature, into the growth of trees and plants generally.’ The new institute was designated the Board of Agriculture’s fruit breeding research station and Sir David Prain, Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, was appointed the first Chairman of the Advisory Council. The charitable scheme also provided for an educational endowment to Rutlish School at Merton which John Innes had been instrumental in establishing.\n\nThe Trustees purchased additional land, part to be used for commercial fruit variety trials. The first ‘John Innes’ variety, a blackberry, was released in 1930. Over the next 50 years 53 new fruit varieties were released, the early varieties all including the prefix ‘Merton’, and many received the RHS Award of Merit. Additionally, 28 new flower varieties and 15 vegetable varieties were produced. Fruit breeding was one of the main lines of research at John Innes until around 1970.\n\nBetween 1934 and 1938 Garden Curator William Lawrence conducted exhaustive trials on the best chemical and physical composition of soil for germinating seedlings and for potting on, perfecting methods of soil sterilisation and establishing optimum amounts of N, P and K fertilisers. These ‘John Innes’ composting formulae were published in 1938 but never patented and the Institute has never made or sold John Innes compost. As part of the war effort John Innes staff published a series of leaflets and gave radio broadcasts to inform the public of their improved methods for raising garden crops and new composts, making ‘John Innes’ a household name.\n\nA move from Merton, where urban air pollution was causing deteriorating soil and poor light quality, was first proposed in 1938 and in 1945 the Trustees purchased the 372 acre Bayfordbury estate, near Hertford. Progressively, the Georgian mansion, a former Dr Barnardo’s Home, was converted into laboratory space and offices. The increased land available enabled experimentation with glasshouse design, and furthered the fruit-breeding and horticultural programmes, including what became internationally recognised work on snapdragons (Antirrhinum majus).\n\nIn 1951 a series of woolly aphid-resistant apple root-stocks, raised jointly by JIHI and East Malling Research Station, were sent to research stations all over the Commonwealth and the United States. The root-stocks, the result of thirty years’ experimental breeding, were named the Malling-Merton series and to this day one remains a standard rootstock for garden and commercially grown apples.\n\nDan Lewis, head of the Genetics Department, was elected FRS in recognition of his pioneer work on the genetics of incompatibility, or ‘S’ gene’, in flowering plants. This contributed to the understanding of incompatibility relations and breeding systems in higher plants and provided a tool for the study of spontaneous mutations and the potential that had for inducing self-fertility in normally cross-pollinated species.\n\nTalks began with the new University of East Anglia’s founding Vice Chancellor Frank Thistlethwaite about relocating to Norwich. This was partly in response to the Zuckerman Report (1961) which argued for research institutes to be located in close proximity to universities. In the consultations the trustees stressed their determination that the John Innes Institute maintain its separate identity.\n\nThe Trustees acquired 29 acres at Colney to accommodate the Institute labs and offices. This was adjacent to the site of the new Food Research Institute with which institute had several shared research interests. The Trustees also bought 165 acres at Stanfield Farm, 20 miles north-west of Norwich, for a continuation of fruit breeding and from which the Institute produced new disease-resistant apples: the variety ‘Gavin’ resulting from this work. Apple research stopped around 1970, and fruit and flower research ceased in the early 1980s.\n\nRobin Holliday of the Genetics Department published a model of DNA-strand exchange to explain the major features of crossing-over, gene conversion, and post-meiotic segregation. His simple model incorporated the cross-stranded (or cruciform) DNA structure that later became known as the ‘Holliday Junction’ (a mobile junction between four strands of DNA), the cornerstone of recombination. The Holliday junction is still celebrated and investigated, the original model evolving to fit the present picture of DNA recombination and repair.\n\nIn 1964 Brian Harrison and John Fincham published the first of a series of papers on genetic instability in snapdragons (Antirrhinum majus) showing that the level of instability is extremely sensitive to the temperature at which the plants are grown. Their work helped to usher in the molecular era of snapdragon research.\n\nThe Trustees agreed to fund the appointment of three professors within the School of Biological Sciences (BIO) at the University of East Anglia: David Hopwood as John Innes Professor of Genetics, D. Roy Davies as JI Professor of Applied Genetics and Dr Roy Markham as JI Professor of Cell Biology. The three professors were also Departmental Heads at John Innes. The JIF Professorships ended with Markham’s death-in-service in 1979, and the retirements of Professor Davies and Professor Hopwood in 1994 and 1998.\n\nIn 1968 the Trustees bought Hill House with 19 further acres at Colney and later converted it to provide accommodation for visiting workers. Over the next few years the Trustees built a new library and a Recreation and Conference Centre with a lecture room to seat 150 people.\n\nStreptomyces genetics began at John Innes with the arrival of David Hopwood and four members of his group from Glasgow University. Streptomyces, the microscopic soil-dwelling bacteria are of interest today because many of the most important antibiotics used in medicine derive from them; they may also prove a source of new antibiotics and other medicines. In the 1980s Hopwood’s group, with partners, cloned a complete set of antibiotic genes from Streptomyces and engineering the first hybrid antibiotic.\n\nFollowing the scaling down of the Institute’s fruit-breeding research Stanfield farm was sold and the Trustees purchased 56 hectares close to Colney at Newfound Farm. This enabled experiments on new types of peas, in particular ‘leafless’ and ‘semi-leafless’ pea plant models. The semi-leafless form was to prove particularly significant and now represents the majority of new varieties being registered and grown.\n\nAppointment of Professor Harold Woolhouse as Director. Woolhouse introduced research on understanding the biochemistry of photosynthesis (C3-C4 metabolism). He played a pivotal role in making the John Innes a world centre for plant and microbial sciences, with strategic measures which included negotiating the founding of the Agricultural and Food Research Council’s (AFRC) new Institute of Plant Science Research at Norwich, facilitating the foundation of The Sainsbury Laboratory and initiating the transfer of the AFRC Nitrogen Fixation Laboratory from the University of Sussex. During his time as Director the staff on the John Innes site grew from just over 200 to over 800.\n\nCathie Martin and Enrico Coen publish two landmark papers. Their work represented one of the first examples of the use of transposon tagging to identify genes and had an important impact on the understanding of pigment biosynthetic pathways. It was partly responsible for the revival of Antirrhinum as a model system for plant genetics.\n\nIn 1987 the applied programmes and farm site of the Plant Breeding Institute in Cambridge were sold to Unilever. A new three-storey ‘IPSR Cambridge Laboratory’ was built at Colney to accommodate the non-privatised PBI staff and resources. The remainder of the proceeds of the Cambridge sale (the £38.8M) was used by the Trustees of the PBI to build a new library, laboratories, glasshouses, controlled environment chamber facilities for plant growth on land leased for a peppercorn from the John Innes Foundation. The Plant Breeding Institute had been founded in 1912 as a flagship national research institute under the leadership of wheat breeder Rowland Biffen and ended as an international research leader with its wheat varieties occupying 90% of the UK wheat acreage and with over 86% of UK cereal crops being PBI varieties (many recognizable by the prefix ‘Maris’). Since the move the financial and scientific legacy of PBI and the Cambridge Lab has been integral to the success of large, multidisciplinary teams working on Arabidopsis, wheat, and brassica genetics and developmental biology. https://www.jic.ac.uk/research/\n\nThe Agricultural and Food Research Council launched a support programme for plant molecular biology with a third of the funding allocated to work on Arabidopsis thaliana. This initiative boosted Arabidopsis work already underway in the Molecular Genetics Department of the Cambridge Laboratory led by Professor Mike Bevan. Research landmarks over the next decade included Nick Harberd’s team identifying and isolating the dwarfing gene that was central to the ‘Green Revolution’. Mike Bevan initiated the sequencing of the Arabidopsis genome in 1996 and coordinated international efforts until the genome was completed in 2000. In 2000 Caroline Dean’s team identified and isolated the plant gene FRIGIDA which controls whether or not a plant needs a winter period before it will flower.\n\nCathie Martin, Alison Smith and colleagues at John Innes published their landmark investigation into a pea mutant showing that the mutant pea carried a mistake in a crucial gene for starch formation. Today Professor Cathie Martin leads investigations into natural chemical compounds in plants with a view to improving the human diet, while Professor Alison Smith’s research is directed at understanding primary metabolism in plants, particularly the metabolism of sucrose and starch and how this affects growth and yield.\n\nThe Trustees of the John Innes Foundation, the Agricultural and Food Research Council, and the Trustees of the Cambridge Laboratory agreed to merge the John Innes Institute, the AFRC Unit of Nitrogen Fixation, originally founded under the directorship of leading inorganic chemist Professor Joseph Chatt, FRS, and the Cambridge Laboratory into a new institute – the John Innes Centre. Plans were agreed to relocate the AFRC Unit from Sussex and re-name it the ‘Nitrogen Fixation Laboratory’ with a new purpose-built laboratory. Among the team was Dr Ray Dixon, who created the first ‘engineered’ nitrogen-fixing microbe and was elected FRS in 1999.\n\nCreation of the John Innes Centre from the merger of the John Innes Institute, the Cambridge Laboratory and the Nitrogen Fixation Laboratory. As part of the arrangements for the merger the Trustees of the John Innes Foundation gifted the assets of the John Innes Institute to the John Innes Centre and leased the Norwich site to JIC for 50 years at an annual rental of one tree.\n\nGraham Moore in the Crop Genetics Department at JIC published his synteny concept in a landmark paper. Using genetic mapping data for a number of different crops, Moore and colleagues showed that the order of genes in regions of the wheat genome is the same as in other smaller cereal genomes. As a result researchers can use rice, which has a much smaller genome than wheat, to find the same genes in wheat, and make predictions from one crop to another.\n\nThe Graduate Studies Office (GSO), sponsored by the BBSRC, was founded as a ‘one-stop-shop’ to oversee all postgraduate student programmes and deliver JIC’s objectives of attracting, selecting and training the best students. On establishment there were 150 JIC PhD students and the office was also responsible for postgraduates at IFR and TSL. Since GSO was founded, John Innes Foundation has funded or part-funded over 100 PhD students.\n\nProfessor Chris Lamb was appointed Director of JIC. A leading plant biologist, he made seminal contributions to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underpin how plants defend themselves against attack by pathogens. He re-organised the existing departments and augmented and promoted Computational and Systems Biology, which became a department in its own right. He was elected FRS in 2008.\n\nOpening of £13 million Foundation-owned Genome Building to accommodate separate JIC and Syngenta and a top floor Norwich Bio-incubator. The new venture provided the most advanced research facility in the UK for plant and microbial genomics and post-genomics studies. The Bio-incubator was to encourage ‘spin-out’ companies to locate to JIC and was funded by the East of England Development Agency and John Innes Foundation. Although Syngenta’s alliance with JIC proved short-lived, the company withdrawing within less than a year following its decision to move its R&D to USA, the building today houses the Earlham institute.\n\nCaroline Dean was elected FRS (and awarded OBE) for her outstanding contributions in the study of developmental timing in plants. Her work on vernalization – the period of cold some plants need in order to flower – revealed the mechanism by which plants remember they have experienced winter and demonstrated novel RNA processing mechanisms controlling flowering. Dean’s Lab research, which includes how plants will adapt to climate change, is part of the Cell and Developmental Biology Department at John Innes.\n\nWith the aim of developing a more appropriate relationship between BBSRC and the institutes, new governance arrangements created three corporate members of the John Innes Council: UEA, JIF, and BBSRC, each with rights to appoint to the Board.\n\nThe John Innes Centre hosted a symposium ‘PBI 100’ to celebrate the centenary of the founding of the Plant Breeding Institute. The event brought together PBI alumni from around the world to celebrate PBI’s achievements and influence on plant science and legacy in the plant breeding sector.\n\nProfessor Dean’s Lab has focused on the timing of the transition to reproductive development of plants, yielding novel insights on epigenetic mechanisms and micro-evolution. Her team uses Arabidopsis as a reference to establish the regulatory hierarchy and then their findings are translated into other species. She was elected FRS in 2004 and in 2016 awarded the Royal Society’s Darwin Medal.\n\nFacilities at the JIC on a 50 acre (20 hectare) site today include over 8,000m2 of conventional and containment glasshouses, 187 m2 of controlled environment suites for plant growth, a germplasm storage unit (housing more than 40,000 accessions) and over 400 acres (160 hectare) for field trial sites. Over, 30,000 m2 of specialised laboratories cater for microbial, cell biological, biochemical and molecular biological research supported by a range of specialist research facilities which are part of the shared resources of Anglia Innovation Partners. There is also a modern conference centre, an extensive library and a collection of rare books and archive material. About 900 scientists and support staff work on the John Innes site (including JIC, TSL, Quadram, Earlham Institute and the shared administration function, the NBI Partnership).\n\nCopyright 2018, John Innes Foundation | John Innes Foundation (JIF) is an independent charity (registered Charity No. 1111527) and a company limited by guarantee (registered no. 5574485). |"
