        "text": "The winner of the RSL’s Encore award, Isabella Hammad, says that it’s in writing a second novel that ‘a writer really becomes a writer.’\n\nBy Porter Anderson, Editor-in-Chief | @Porter_Anderson\n\n‘The Political Is Always Human’\n\nA mighty book contest machine is the United Kingdom’s Royal Society of Literature. In a book publishing market bristling with awards, honors, and accolades, this charity produces:\n\nThe Encore Award\n\nThe RSL International Writers awards\n\nCompanions of Literature\n\nThe RSL Ondaatje Prize\n\nThe RSL Christopher Bland Prize,\n\nThe RSL Giles St Aubyn Awards for Nonfiction\n\nThe VS Pritchett Short Story Prize\n\nThe RSL Literature Matters Awards\n\nThe Sky Arts RSL Writers Awards\n\nThe Benson Medal\n\nThe growing plethora of British book and publishing honors, of course, means that our news medium and others must select and limit what to report. Having given you a look at the shortlist of the accolade called the Encore—for the writers of second novels—we’re now able to close the loop on that one with news of its winner.\n\nIndeed, Enter Ghost by Isabella Hammad (Penguin Random House / Vintage) was shortlisted by the UK’s Women’s Prize for Fiction as well as by the Royal Society. The book has enjoyed high regard this season.\n\nIn the jury’s statement of rationale for its choice at the Royal Society, we read an eloquent case for the jurors’ conviction that the book is “as profound as it is powerful.\n\n“Hammad tells the story of Sonia, a British Palestinian actress who flees a failed marriage and love affair in London to stay with her sister in the West Bank,” they write. “Family tensions, the haunting of lost love, and the impositions of the Israeli occupation build, quite literally, toward a dramatic conclusion: the denouement takes place during a production of Hamlet, staged in the presence of Israeli troops.\n\n“In a voice that’s always original, Hammad takes one of the most intractable and polarizing conflicts of our time and creates a story braided through with compassion and wisdom. The political, she reminds us, is always human.”\n\nAnd Hammad herself, in a comment on receiving this award, makes it clear what the concept of a “second novel” involves for a writer: “Second novels are, as I was repeatedly told,” she says, “notoriously difficult—not only to write, but also to sell.\n\n“Everyone loves a debut, but I think it may actually be in the tricky transition from the first book to the second that a writer really becomes a writer.\n\n“I’m happy to have made it to the other side, and really honored that my second novel has been recognized in this way.”\n\nThis time, the Encore award jury has comprised Fergal Keane, Malika Booker, and Maura Dooley.\n\nA Fine Purse, and a Need for Market Reports\n\nThe Encore’s purse is considerably solid, providing £15,000 (US$18,932) to Hammad for her win (that figure is up from £10,000), and £1,000 for each of her four fellow shortlistees (that figure is up from £500).\n\nThis can help those new to the idea of reporting on market activity understand why it’s important to demonstrate that prize attention shifts copies on the high street. If so many awards are competing for attention—inevitably confusing and finally indistinguishable to consumers—then authors and publishers, as well as book readers, need to be able to determine a marketplace value to so many accolades, most of them certainly well-deserved by writers but eye-glazing to the public.\n\nAnd that’s why, of course, many in book publishing would like to see the Royal Society join the Booker Prize Foundation, the British Academy Book Prize for Global Cultural Understanding, and the Baillie Gifford Prize for Nonfiction in reporting the effect its awards have on winning titles in the marketplace. Particularly since this charity operates 10 awards, this is a contest administration that could provide extensive sales data on a number of different sectors, both in fiction and nonfiction.\n\nWith so many contests battling each other for press and consumer attention, reporting on marketplace impact can relieve the industry of having to take on faith the notion that those “golden stickers” sell books.\n\nAnd the more prize regimes that commit to reporting over weeks and months how a winning title has done in sales increase their own value, both to the industry and to the book-reading public.\n\nPrevious Winners of the ‘Encore’ Contest\n\nAn asterisk indicates that the prize was split between multiple authors in the year referenced.\n\n2023 Daisy Hildyard Emergency\n\n2022 Francis Spufford Light Perpetual\n\n2021 Caoilinn Hughes The Wild Laughter\n\n2020 Patrick McGuinness Throw Me to the Wolves\n\n2019 Sally Rooney Normal People\n\n2018* Andrew Michael Hurley Devil’s Day\n\nLisa McInerney The Blood Miracles\n\n2017 Ian McGuire The North Water\n\n2015 Sunjeev Sahota The Year of the Runaways\n\n2014 Neel Mukherjee The Lives of Others\n\n2013 Evie Wyld All the Birds, Singing\n\n2012 Ned Beauman The Teleportation Accident\n\n2011 Joe Dunthorne Wild Abandon\n\n2010 Adam Foulds The Quickening Maze\n\n2009 Julia Leigh Disquiet\n\n2007 M.J.
