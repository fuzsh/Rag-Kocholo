His research has made contributions to the identification and cloning of the Arabidopsis disease resistance genes RPS2, RPM1 and RPS5, and the soybean disease resistance genes Rpg1b and Rpg1r, all of which belong to the nucleotide binding-leucine rich repeat (NLR) family. Work in his lab helped to show that most NLR proteins detect pathogen effector proteins indirectly, via detecting modification of effector targets. Due to challenges associated with purifying and crystalizing NLR proteins, which are both large and relatively insoluble, structural information on NLR proteins is lacking, especially in their activated state. The Innes lab is currently focused on filling this gap, developing methods for purifying soluble NLR protein from plant tissue and using state-of-the-art instruments for performing cryo-electron microscopy.

After completing his Ph.D. thesis at Stanford University on the biogenesis and function of primary cilia in mammalian cells, he transitioned to working on the expansion and biosynthesis of plant cell walls for his post-doctoral studies as part of the Energy Biosciences Institute at the University of California Berkeley. He accepted a position as an Assistant Professor of Biology at Penn State in December of 2011 and was promoted to Associate Professor in 2018. The Anderson group seeks to understand how the synthesis, trafficking, assembly, and remodeling of cell wall components influence cell wall structure and cell growth in plants, and to identify and characterize new genes that influence cell wall dynamics. This research will inform efforts to use plant cell walls—an abundant and renewable resource—to provide sustainable food, materials, and energy for human society. Recent projects include analyzing the functions of pectin-degrading enzymes in plant growth and development, investigating the function of cytosolic invertase in cellulose synthesis, probing the dynamic structure and biomechanics of cell walls in stomatal guard cells, and work with collaborators to build and test a new, multimodal microscope that will enable imaging the dynamics of cell wall degradation at the level of single molecules.\n\nEditorial experience\n\nReviewing Editor, Plant Cell (2018- ); Frontiers in Plant Science, Guest Editor (2018- ).\n\nHonors and awards include\n\nTombros Fellow of the Center for Excellence in Science Education (2015), National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (2002-2005), H.V.P.
