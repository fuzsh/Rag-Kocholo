It will be a privilege to help with its current exciting work,” said Sir David.\n\nThe Society’s chairman Steve Busby said: “His findings have opened new avenues in areas like HIV and cancer treatment and disease-resistant agriculture. It will be an honour to have someone of Sir David’s calibre at the helm of the Biochemical Society.”"
