Abstract:

‘El desconocido de sí mismo’ [A Stranger to Himself], the foreword that Octavio Paz wrote almost sixty years ago for his anthology of Fernando Pessoa, is still today one of the best introductions to Pessoa's poetry. The purpose of this article is to study the sources of the essay written by Paz, which was important not only because it introduced Pessoa's poetry to the Hispanic world, but also because it was a source for a broader understanding of the history of modern poetry for Paz himself, given that when he wrote El arco y la lira [The Bow and the Lyre] (1956) he had a limited knowledge of Portuguese literature and he did not yet know Pessoa. Outstanding among the sources of the essay is one in which Pessoa himself, answering the request of a friend, refers his literary influences between 1904 and 1913. The final considerations defend the need for a better understanding and knowledge of Portuguese literature — and other less read and studied literatures — to ‘decentralize’ our knowledge of some literary traditions.
