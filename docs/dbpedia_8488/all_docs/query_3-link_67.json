        "text": "We publish poets (as opposed to poems). We would like to spend time with your voice and see your range.\n\nWe welcome poets from all over the world.\n\nWe love prose poems, traditional forms (ghazals, villanelles, sestinas), love poems, sex poems, speculative poems, and experimental questionnaires, but we are not married to a style or genre. Send us your most exciting work. We want poems that make us go: “God, I wish I had written this!”\n\nSome poets we love are Kaveh Akbar, Agha Shahid Ali, Jorge Luis Borges, Anne Carson, Victoria Chang, Heather Christle, Tracy Fuad, Bob Hicok, Kim Hyesoon, Ilya Kaminsky, Luke Kennard, Li-Young Lee, Fran Lock, Bert Meyers, Kei Miller, Octavio Paz, Fernando Pessoa, Alejandra Pizarnik, Mary Ruefle, Tim Seibles, Tanya Shirley, Ocean Vuong, Jenny Xie, Yanyi, Jane Yeh…\n\nSend us up to 10 pages of poetry.\n\nWe only accept previously uncurated work. Please refer to this article for a more in-depth understanding of what that means.\n\nWe love cover letters and would prefer knowing whose work we are reading. We care about your identity. You are welcome to share your publication history, if any, though that would not influence our decision. Though please make sure that the document of your poems is stripped of any biographical information—use the cover note field for this.\n\nWe encourage simultaneous submissions. Feel free to submit your work to all the wonderful places you think will be a good home for your poems. You need not withdraw your poems if they get accepted elsewhere — if we like your work, we’ll find a way to work with you.\n\nWe like EB Garamond, 13 point font-size, and 1.15 line-spacing. If you are submitting prose poems (which, we repeat, we love) please justify your paragraphs. If you are unable to use our preferred formatting because of technical reasons, that is totally fine.\n\nIf we have previously declined your submission, you can submit again the following month.\n\nWe are open to translations as long as you have the rights from the author/publisher.\n\nWe generally respond within 6 weeks.\n\nWe offer $55 to all our poets. This is per contribution and not per piece. We are looking into various fundraising options so we can increase this amount. We are committed to putting poets first, so this is of utmost importance to us! If you want to help us in our efforts, please consider donating.\n\nWe nominate for the Pushcart Prize and Best of the Net."
