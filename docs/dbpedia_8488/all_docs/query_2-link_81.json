        "text": "Fernando Pessoa was born in Lisbon in 1888. He spent most of his life there but, after his father’s death, he lived in South Africa for nine years when his mother married the Portuguese consul in Durban. In those years he became fluent in English and developed a love for English writers such as Shakespeare and Milton. This influenced him to write his first collections of poems and journals in English, while his first book in Portuguese was published just two years before his death.\n\nOn leaving South Africa he returned to Lisbon, where he became involved in the modernist group ‘Orpheu’ and had a major role in the development of modernism in Portugal. During his life he was virtually unknown, avoiding society and the literary world, and although he wrote a vast amount, most of it was published posthumously. After his death in Lisbon in 1935, a trunk was found containing over 25,000 items – among them were collections of poems, letters and journals, from which The Book of Disquiet is a selection.\n\nPraise for The Book of Disquiet\n\n‘It could not have been written in England: there is too much thought racing hopelessly around. The elegance of the style, well conveyed in what seems to be a more than adequate translation, is an important component and a very ironic one. The diary disturbs from beginning to end… There is a distinguished mind at work beneath the totally acceptable dullness of clerking. The mind is that of Pessoa. We must be given the chance to learn more about him’ Anthony Burgess, Observer\n\n‘Pessoa’s near-novel is a complete masterpiece, the sort of book one makes friends with and cannot bear to be parted with. Boredom informs it, but not boringly. Pessoa loved the minutiae of what we care to deem the ordinary life, and that love enriches and deepens his art’ Paul Bailey, Independent\n\n‘The very book to read when you wake at 3am and can’t get back to sleep – mysteries, misgivings, fears and dreams and wonderment. Like nothing else’ Philip Pullman\n\n‘It was a real bonus when Serpent’s Tail published The Book of Disquiet, a meandering, melancholic series of reveries and meditations. Pessoa’s amazing personality is as beguiling and mysterious as his unique poetic output. We cannot learn too much about him’ William Boyd, TLS Books of the Year\n\n‘In a time that celebrates fame, success, stupidity, convenience and noise, here is the perfect antidote’ John Lanchester, Daily Telegraph\n\n‘[A] classic of existential literature’ Emma Tennant, Independent on Sunday\n\n‘Many British reviewers have pegged Pessoa as a great long-lost modernist, but he also calls up echoes of Beckett’s exquisite boredom; the dark imaginings of Baudelaire; Melville’s evasive confidence man; the dreamscapes of Borges; even the cranky hermeticism of Witold Gombrowicz’ Village Voice\n\n‘This is an astonishing novel, one which batters you, pierces you, awakens and numbs you’ Independent on Sunday\n\n‘This book has moved me more than anything I have read in years. I have rarely encountered such exhilarating lugubriousness’ Daily Telegraph\n\n‘Portugal’s greatest poet’ The Times\n\n‘A haunting mosaic of dreams, psychological notations, autobiographical vignettes, shards of literary theory and criticism and maxims’ George Steiner, Observer\n\nThe BOOK of DISQUIET\n\nFernando Pessoa\n\nEdited by Maria José de Lancastre\n\nTranslated by Margaret Jull Costa\n\nIntroduction by William Boyd\n\nA complete catalogue record for this book can be obtained from the British Library on request\n\nThe right of Fernando Pessoa to be identified as the author of this work has been asserted in accordance with the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988\n\nTranslation copyright © 1991 by Serpent’s Tail\n\nIntroduction copyright © William Boyd 2010\n\nAll rights reserved.

Pessoa was obsessed by the schism between our ‘concrete’ and our ‘abstract’ natures – summed up here in the concept of carne inteligente. Sometimes he wished he were a simple unreflecting animal, untroubled by self-consciousness, but he saw in our uniquely human ability to reflect on and analyse ourselves the source of all our pleasures in life (he described sunsets as ‘an intellectual experience’) – and its pain. Hence the wry rejoinder -‘although sometimes ill’ – a very Pessoa-esque note to strike. The comedic aspects of our short, troubled existences also entertained him. The hilarious absurdity of the human predicament was as obvious to him as its inherent, melancholy pointlessness.\n\nFernando Pessoa (1888–1935) is one of the great figures of 20th-century European modernism. The most exotic portion of his life occurred in his youth. At the age of seven he left Lisbon for Durban, South Africa, where he lived with his mother and stepfather until he was seventeen. This sojourn provoked in him an enduring anglophilia (his first poems were in English) and a sense of being a permanent outsider. It is perhaps helpful to see him as a Portuguese cross between Franz Kafka and TS Eliot – a maverick, unclassifiable spirit wrapped up in a carapace of petit-bourgeois conformity. Like Kafka (insurance) and Eliot (banking), Pessoa earned his living on his return from South Africa in a humdrum professional world. He became a commercial translator, writing business letters in English and French for Portuguese companies. In the many photographs we have of him in his adult life he looks the perfect dry functionary: moustachioed, dapper, always with a hat and a tie – I’homme moyen sensual – as if the rectitude and tedium of his daily job were in some way necessary to curb the teeming, abundant life of the mind within.\n\nIntriguingly, Pessoa’s literary fame is entirely posthumous. During his life he was a very minor figure on the fringes of the Lisbon artistic and intellectual scene, an obscure footnote in the annals of 20th-century Portuguese poetry. He published hardly anything and it was only the discovery of a vast trunk of manuscripts after his death that has provided us with the copious poetry and other prose writings – of which The Book of Disquiet is by far the major element.\n\nWhat makes Pessoa extraordinary in a modernist–literary sense is his invention of what he called ‘heteronyms’. Pessoa published poems under his own name but also under the names of other identities. Possessing a disguise far more complex than mere pseudonyms, these heteronym-poets had styles, biographies and personalities of their own, as if they really were distinct individuals who were born, lived and died apart from their creator. There are seventy-two distinct heteronyms in the Pessoa oeuvre but four predominate: the poets Alberto Caiero, Ricardo Reis, and Alvaro de Campos and the author of The Book of Disquiet, Bernardo Soares.\n\nPessoa regarded Soares as the closest to himself – a minor clerk whiling away his life in rented rooms – describing him as a ‘mutilation of my personality’. The Soares heteronym evolved earlier and lasted far longer than any of the others and his life’s work – the fragmented journal and collection of philosophical musings that make up The Book of Disquiet – was both incomplete and unorganised when Pessoa died in 1935 (of hepatitis, in fact: Pessoa was also a dedicated but discreet alcoholic). Indeed, the form that the published book takes is something of an estimation - so random and confused were Pessoa’s plans for the finished volume. But, fittingly, the mystery and disorder of the jottings and pages somehow suit the book’s tone and atmosphere. Pessoa has been described by Octavio Paz as a ‘solemn investigator of futile things’, the epitome of an empty man who, in his helplessness, creates a world in order to discover his true identity. It’s in this spirit that we should read The Book of Disquiet, not only to locate the echo of our own disquiet about our life and the world we occupy, but also to go on a mesmerizing journey with one of the most fascinating minds in European literature.\n\nTranslator’s note\n\nThe Book of Disquiet (Livro do desassossego) is the most extensive prose work written by Portugal’s greatest poet, Fernando Pessoa. He was engaged in writing it, always in fragmentary form, from 1912 until his death in 1935, although the first complete Portuguese edition only appeared in 1982. As well as writing under his own name, Pessoa created a number of ‘heteronyms’, imaginary authors to whom he gave complete biographies and who wrote in styles and expressed philosophies and attitudes different from his own. Pessoa attributed the authorship of The Book of Disquiet to Bernardo Soares, who was, he said only ‘a semi-heteronym because, although his personality is not mine, it is not different from but rather a simple mutilation of my personality. It’s me minus reason and affectivity.’\n\nVery little of this ‘intimate diary’ was published in his lifetime. The book itself was handwritten in notebooks or typed on frequently undated and undatable sheets of paper. The work of deciphering and collating all this material was carried out by Maria Aliete Galhoz, Teresa Sobral Cunha and Jacinto do Prado Coelho. This translation is based on the thematic selection edited by Maria José dc Lancastre, a leading Pessoa scholar. The numbers given in parentheses at the beginning of each text refer to the numbering of the original 1982 edition published in Lisbon by Ática. […] indicates that words or phrases in the original are either illegible or missing.\n\nThe translator would like to thank Pete Ayrton, Annella McDermott, Faye Carney and Martin Jenkins for all their help and advice.\n\nIntroduction\n\nBernardo Soares\n\nInstalled on the upper floors of certain respectable taverns in Lisbon can be found a small number of restaurants or eating places, which have the stolid, homely look of those restaurants you see in towns that lack even a train station. Amongst the clientele of such places, which are rarely busy except on Sundays, one is as likely to encounter the eccentric as the nondescript, to find people who are but a series of parentheses in the book of life.\n\nThere was a period in my life when a combination of economic necessity and a desire for peace and quiet led me to frequent just such a restaurant. I would dine at around seven each night and, as chance would have it, I was almost always there at the same time as one particular man. At first I took little notice of him but as time passed he came to interest me.\n\nHe was a man in his thirties, thin, fairly tall, very hunched when sitting though less so when standing, and dressed with a not entirely unselfconscious negligence. Not even the suffering apparent in his pale, unremarkable features added any interest to them nor was it easy to pinpoint the origin of that suffering. It could have been any number of things: hardship, grief or simply the suffering born of the indifference that comes from having suffered too much.\n\nHe always ate sparingly and afterwards would smoke a cigarette rolled from cheap tobacco. He would watch the other customers, not suspiciously, but as if genuinely interested in them. He did not scrutinize them as though wanting to fix their faces or any outward evidence of their personalities in his memory, rather he was simply intrigued by them. And it was this odd trait of his that first aroused my curiosity.\n\nI began to observe him more closely. I noticed that a certain hesitant intelligence illuminated his features, but his face was so often clouded by exhaustion, by the inertia of cold fear, that it was usually hard to see beyond this.\n\nI learned from a waiter at the restaurant that he worked as a clerk in a company that had its office nearby.\n\nOne day there was a scuffle in the street immediately outside the restaurant – a fight between two men. The customers all rushed to the windows, as did I and the man I’ve been describing. I made some banal comment to him and he replied in kind. His voice was dull and tremulous, the voice of one who hopes for nothing because all hope is vain. But perhaps it was foolish of me to attribute so much to my evening companion at the restaurant.\n\nI don’t quite know why but after that we always used to greet each other. And then one day; prompted perhaps by the foolish coincidence of us both turning up for supper later than usual, at half past nine, we struck up a casual conversation. At one point he asked me if I was a writer. I said I was. I mentioned the magazine Orpheu*, which had recently come out. To my surprise he praised it, indeed praised it highly. When I voiced my surprise, saying that the art of those who wrote for Orpheu tended to appeal only to a small minority, he replied that maybe he was one of that minority. Anyway, he added, he was not entirely unfamiliar with that art for, he remarked timidly, since he had nowhere to go and nothing to do, no friends to visit and no interest in reading books, after supper he usually returned to his rented room and passed the night writing.\n\nFernanda Pessoa\n\nThe BOOK of DISQUIET\n\n1 [90]\n\nSometimes I think I will never leave Rua dos Douradores. Once written down, that seems to me like eternity.\n\n2 [124]\n\nThe journey in my head\n\nIn the plausible intimacy of approaching evening, as I stand waiting for the stars to begin at the window of this fourth floor room that looks out on the infinite, my dreams move to the rhythm required by long journeys to countries as yet unknown, or to countries that are simply hypothetical or impossible.\n\n3 [81]\n\nToday, during one of those periods of daydreaming which, though devoid of either purpose or dignity, still constitute the greater part of the spiritual substance of my life, I imagined myself free forever of Rua dos Douradores, of my boss Vasques, of Moreira the book-keeper, of all the other employees, the errand boy, the post boy, even the cat. In dreams, that freedom felt to me as if the South Seas had proffered up a gift of marvellous islands as yet undiscovered. Freedom would mean rest, artistic achievement, the intellectual fulfilment of my being.\n\nBut suddenly, even as I imagined this (during the brief holiday afforded by my lunch break), a feeling of displeasure erupted into the dream: I would be sad. Yes, I say it quite seriously: I would be sad. For my boss Vasques, Moreira the book-keeper, Borges the cashier, all the lads, the cheery boy who takes the letters to the post office, the errand boy, the friendly cat - they have all become part of my life. I could never leave all that behind without weeping, without realizing, however displeasing the thought, that part of me would remain with them and that losing them would be akin to death.\n\nMoreover, if I left them all tomorrow and discarded this Rua dos Douradores suit of clothes I wear, what else would I do? Because I would have to do something. And what suit would I wear? Because I would have to wear another suit.\n\nWe all have a Senhor Vasques; sometimes he’s a tangible human being, sometimes not. In my case he really is called Vasques and he’s a pleasant, healthy chap, a bit brusque at times but he’s no doubledealer. He’s selfish but basically fair, much fairer than many of the great geniuses and many of the human marvels of civilization on both left and right. For many people Vasques takes the form of vanity, a desire for greater wealth, for glory or immortality … Personally I prefer to have Vasques as my real life boss since, in times of difficulty, he’s easier to deal with than any abstraction the world has to offer.\n\nThe other day a friend, who’s a partner in a prosperous company that does business throughout the country and who considers my salary to be distinctly on the low side, said to me: Tou’re being exploited, Soares.’ This made me realize that indeed I am; but since it’s the fate of everyone in this life to be exploited, my question would be: is it any worse being exploited by Senhor Vasques and his textile company than by vanity, glory, resentment, envy or the impossible?\n\nSome, the prophets and saints who walk this vacuous world, are exploited by God himself.\n\nAnd I return to an other’s house, to the spacious office in the Rua dos Douradores, the way some return to their homes. I approach my desk as if it were a bulwark against life. I feel such an overwhelming sense of tenderness that my eyes fill with tears for my books that are in reality the books of other people whose accounts I keep, for the inkwell I use, for Sergio’s stooped shoulders as, not far from me, he sits writing out bills of lading. I feel love for all this, perhaps because I have nothing else to love or perhaps too, because even though nothing truly merits the love of any soul, if, out of sentiment, we must give it, I might just as well lavish it on the smallness of an inkwell as on the grand indifference of the stars.\n\n4 [114]\n\nWith the soul’s equivalent of a wry smile, I calmly confront the prospect that my life will consist of nothing more than being shut up for ever in Rua dos Douradores, in this office, surrounded by these people. I have enough money to buy food and drink, I have somewhere to live and enough free time in which to dream, write - and sleep - what more can I ask of the gods or hope for from Fate?\n\nI had great ambitions and extravagant dreams, but so did the errand boy and the seamstress, for everyone has dreams; the only difference is whether or not we have the strength to fulfil them or a destiny that will fulfil them through us.\n\nWhen it comes to dreams, I’m no different from the errand boy and the seamstress. The only thing that distinguishes me from them is that I can write. Yes, that’s an activity, a real fact about myself that distinguishes me from them. But in my soul I’m just the same.\n\nI know that there are islands in the South and grand cosmopolitan passions and […]. I’m sure that even if I held the world in my hand, I’d exchange it all for a tram ticket back to Rua dos Douradores.\n\nPerhaps it’s my destiny to remain a book-keeper for ever and for poetry and literature to remain simply butterflies that alight on my head and merely underline my own ridiculousness by their very beauty.\n\nI’ll miss Moreira, but what does missing someone matter compared with a chance for real promotion?\n\nI know that the day I’m made chief book-keeper to Vasques & Co. will be one of the greatest days of my life. I know it with a prescient bitterness and irony but I know it with all the finality that certainty can bring.\n\n5 [91]\n\nSenhor Vasques. I often find myself mesmerized by Senhor Vasques. What does this man represent to me beyond the chance inconvenience of his being master of my time, of the daylight hours of my life? He treats me well, he always talks to me in a friendly enough manner except on the odd occasion when he’s been offhand because of some private worry, but then he was offhand with everyone. So why do I think about him so much? Is he a symbol? A motive force? What is he to me?\n\nSenhor Vasques. I remember him now as I will in the future with the nostalgia I know I will feel for him then. I’ll be living quietly in a little house somewhere in the suburbs, enjoying a peaceful existence not writing the book I’m not writing now and, so as to continue not doing so, I will come up with different excuses from the ones I use now to avoid actually confronting myself. Or else I’U be interned in a poorhouse, content with my utter failure, mingling with the riffraff who believed they were geniuses when in fact they were just beggars with dreams, mixing with the anonymous mass of people who had neither the strength to triumph nor the power to turn their defeats into victories. Wherever I am, I will think nostalgically of my boss Senhor Vasques and the office in Rua dos Douradores, and for me the monotony of my daily life will be like the memory of loves that never came my way and of triumphs that were never to be mine.\n\nSenhor Vasques. I see him from that future perspective as clearly as I see him here today: medium height, thickset, coarse, with his particular limitations and affections, frank and astute, brusque and affable. It isn’t only money that marks him out as a boss, you can see it in his slow, hairy hands marked by plump veins like coloured muscles, his neck, strong but not too thick, and his firm, rosy cheeks above the dark, neatly trimmed beard. I see him, see the deliberate but energetic gestures, his eyes reflecting from within his thoughts about the world without. I’m troubled if I displease him and my soul is gladdened by his smile, a broad, human smile, warm as the applause of a large crowd.\n\nPerhaps the reason the ordinary, almost vulgar figure of Senhor Vasques so often tangles with my intelligence and distracts me from myself is simply because there’s no one else in my life of greater stature. I think there’s some symbolism in all this. I believe, or almost believe, that somewhere in a distant life this man was something more to me than he is today.\n\n6 [155]\n\nAh, now I understand! Senhor Vasques is Life; Life, monotonous and necessary, commanding and unknowable. This banal man represents the banality of life. On the surface he is everything to me, just as, on the surface, Life is everything to me.\n\nAnd if the office in the Rua dos Douradores represents Life for me, the second floor room I live in on that same street represents Art. Yes, Art, living on the same street as Life but in a different room; Art, which offers relief from life without actually relieving one of living, and which is as monotonous as life itself but in a different way. Yes, for me Rua dos Douradores embraces the meaning of all things, the resolution of all mysteries, except the existence of mysteries themselves which is something beyond resolution.\n\n7 [63]\n\nI went into the barber’s as I usually do, experiencing the pleasure I always get from being able to enter places known to me without suffering the least distress. My sensitivity to all things new is a constant affliction to me; I only feel safe in places I have been in before.\n\nWhen I sat down in the chair and the young barber placed a clean, cold linen towel around my neck, it occurred to me to ask after his colleague, a vigorous, older man, who had been ill but who usually worked at the chair to my right. The question arose spontaneously, simply because the place reminded me of him. As fingers busied themselves tucking in the last bit of towel between my neck and my collar, the voice behind the towel and me answered flatly: ‘He died yesterday.’ My irrational good humour died as suddenly as the now eternally absent barber from the chair beside me. My every thought froze. I said nothing.\n\nNostalgia! I feel it even for someone who meant nothing to me, out of anxiety for the flight of time and a sickness bred of the mystery of life. If one of the faces I pass daily on the streets disappears, I feel sad; yet they meant nothing to me, other than being a symbol of all life.\n\nThe dull old man with dirty gaiters I often used to pass at half past nine in the morning. The lame lottery salesman who pestered me without success. The plump, rosy old gentleman with the cigar, who used to stand at the door of the tobacconist’s. The pale-cheeked tobacconist himself. What has become of those people who, just because I saw them day after day, became part of my life? Tomorrow I too will disappear from Rua da Prata, Rua dos Douradores, Rua dos Fanqueiros. Tomorrow I too - this feeling and thinking soul, the universe I am to myself - yes, tomorrow I too will be someone who no longer walks these streets, someone others will evoke with a vague: ‘I wonder what’s become of him?’ And everything I do, everything I feel, everything I experience, will be just one less passer-by on the daily streets of some city or other.\n\nThe sleeping partner of the company, a man much troubled by obscure ailments, was suddenly taken with the notion (a caprice that came on him, it seems, between afflictions) that he wanted to have a group photograph taken of the office staff. So, the day before yesterday, following the instructions of the jolly photographer, we all lined up against the grubby white partition that serves as a rickety wooden division between the general office and Senhor Vasques’s office. In the centre stood Vasques himself; on either side of him, according to a hierarchy that began logically enough but rapidly broke down, stood the other men who gather here each day, in body, to perform the small tasks, the ultimate aim of which is a secret known only to the gods.\n\nToday, when I arrived at the office, a little late and having in fact completely forgotten about the frozen moment captured twice by the photographer, I found Moreira, an unexpectedly early bird, and one of the clerks poring over some blackish objects that I recognized with a start as being the first prints of the photographs. They were, in fact, two copies of the same photograph, the one that had come out best.\n\nI experienced the pain of truth when I saw myself there, because, inevitably, it was my face I looked for first. I have never had a very high opinion of my physical appearance but never before have I felt such a nonentity as I did then, comparing myself with the other faces, so familiar to me, in that line-up of my daily companions. I look like a rather dull Jesuit. My thin, inexpressive face betrays no intelligence, no intensity, nothing whatever to make it stand out from the stagnant tide of the other faces. But they’re not a stagnant tide. There are some really expressive faces there. Senhor Vasques is exactly as he is in real life - the firm, likable face, the steady gaze, all set off by the stiff moustache. The energy and intelligence of the man - qualities which are after all utterly banal and to be found in thousands of other men all over the world - are stamped on that photograph as if it were a psychological passport. The two travelling salesmen look superb; the clerk has come out well but he’s half hidden behind Moreira. And Moreira! My immediate superior Moreira, the embodiment of monotony and routine, looks much more human than I do! Even the errand boy - I detect in myself, without being able to suppress it, a feeling"
