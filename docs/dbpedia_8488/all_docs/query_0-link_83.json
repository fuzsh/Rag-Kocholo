        "text": "ITS TERMS\n\nThere is a woodcut by Posada that shows a figure in a circus: a dwarf seen from the back, but with his face turned toward the spectator, and shown with another face down by his buttocks. Quevedo is no less explicit, and one of his juvenile works bears the title Gracias y Desgracias del Ojo del Culo [Graces and Disgraces of the Eye of the Ass]. It is a long comparison between an ass and a face. The superiority of the former lies in its having only one eye, as did the Cyclopes that descended from the gods of sight.\n\nPosada’s woodcut and Quevedo’s metaphor seem to say the same thing: that asses and faces are identical. There is a difference nonetheless: the woodcut shows that the ass is a face, whereas Quevedo affirms that the ass is like the face of the Cyclopes. We pass from the human world to the mythological world: if the face is bestial, as is the ass, the bestiality of both is divine or demoniacal. If we want to know what the face of the Cyclopes is like, the best thing is to ask Góngora. Let us listen to Polyphemus as he looks in the water and discovers his face:\n\nmiréme y lucir vi un sol en mi frente\n\ncuando en el cielo un ojo se veía\n\nneutra el agua dudaba a cual fe preste:\n\no al cielo humano o al cíclope celeste.\n\n[I looked at myself and saw a sun shining in my forehead\n\nwhile an eye was visible in the sky\n\nthe neutral water doubted which was real:\n\nthe human sky or the celestial Cyclops.]\n\nPolyphemus sees his deformed face as another firmament. Transformations: the eye of the ass—that of the Cyclops—that of the sky. The sun dissolves the face-ass, soul-body dualism in a single dazzling, total image. We regain our former unity, but this unity is neither animal nor human; it is Cyclopean, mythical.\n\nThere is not much purpose in repeating here everything that psychoanalysis has taught us about the conflict between the face and the ass, the (repressive) reality principle and the (explosive) pleasure principle. I will merely note here that the metaphor that I mentioned, both as it works upward and as it works downward—the ass as a face and the face as an ass—serves each of these principles alternately. At first, the metaphor uncovers a similarity; then, immediately afterward, it covers it up again, either because the first term absorbs the second, or vice versa. In any case, the similarity disappears and the opposition between ass and face reappears, in a form that is now even stronger than before. Here, too, the similarity at first seems unbearable to us—and therefore we either laugh or cry; in the second step, the opposition also becomes unbearable—and therefore we either laugh or cry. When we say that the ass is like another face, we deny the soul-body dualism; we laugh because we have resolved the discord that we are. But the victory of the pleasure principle does not last long; at the same time that our laughter celebrates the reconciliation of the soul and the body, it dissolves it and makes it laughable once again. As a matter of fact, the ass is sober-sided; the organs of laughter are the same as those of language: the tongue and the lips. When we laugh at our ass—that caricature of our face—we affirm our separation and bring about the total defeat of the pleasure principle. Our face laughs at our ass and thus retraces the dividing line between the body and the spirit.\n\nNeither the phallus nor the ass has a sense of humor. Being sullen, they are aggressive. Their aggressiveness is the result of the smiling repression of the face. As Baudelaire discovered, long before Freud: smiles, and the comic in general, are the stigmata of original sin, or, to put the matter another way, they are the attributes of our humanity, the result of and the witness to our violent separation from the natural world. The smile is the sign of our duality; if at times we make fun of our own selves with the same acrimony with which we laugh at others every day, it is because we are in fact always two: the I and the other. But the violent emissions of the phallus, the convulsions of the vulva, and the explosions of the ass wipe the smile off our face. Our principles totter, shaken by a psychic earthquake no less powerful than earthquakes in the ground beneath our feet. Deeply disturbed by the violence of our sensations and mental images, we pass from seriousness to hearty laughter. The I and the other become one, and what is more, the I is possessed by the other. Hearty laughter is similar to the physical and psychological spasm: we burst out laughing. This explosion is the contrary of the smile, and I am not certain that it can be called comic. The comic spirit implies two persons; the one who is watching and the one who is being watched, whereas when we laugh heartily the distinction is erased or at least diminished. A burst of laughter not only suppresses the duality, it also obliges us to become one with laughter in general, with the great physiological and cosmic turmoil of the ass and the phallus—the volcano and the monsoon.\n\nA burst of laughter is also a metaphor: the face becomes a phallus, a vulva, or an ass. On the psychological level a burst of laughter is the equivalent of what the expressions of poets and satirists are on the verbal level. Its explosion is an exaggeration that is no less extreme than Góngora’s poetic image and Quevedo’s wit. Both are the doubles of physiological and cosmic violence. The result is a transmutation: we leap from the world of duality, ruled by the reality principle, into that of the myth of original unity. A fit of laughter is not merely a response to the pleasure principle, nor its copy or reproduction (even though it is both these things): it is the metaphor of pleasure. Hearty laughter is a (provisional) synthesis between the soul and body, the I and the other. This synthesis is a transformation or symbolic translation: we are like the Cyclopes once again. Once again: hearty laughter is a regression to a former state; we return to the world of our own childhood, either individual or collective, to myth and play. We return to the primordial unity—before there was a you and an I—in the form of a we that embraces every living being and every element.\n\nThe other response to carnal violence is seriousness, impassivity. This is the philosophical response, as the burst of laughter is the mythical response. Seriousness is an attribute of ascetics and libertines. Hearty laughter is a relaxation, asceticism a rigidity: it hardens the body so as to preserve the soul. I couple the libertine with the ascetic because libertinage is also a hardening, of the spirit first of all, and then of the senses. An asceticism in reverse. With his usual acuity, Sade states that the libertine philosopher must be imperturbable and aspire to the insensibility of the ancient Stoics, to ataraxia. His erotic archetypes are stones, metals, cooled lava. Equivalences, equations: the phallus and the volcano, the vulva and the crater. Resembling an earthquake in his emotional ardor and fury, the libertine must be hard, as stony as the rocks and crags that cover the plain after an eruption. Freedom, the philosophic state par excellence, is synonymous with hardness.\n\nStrangely enough—or rather, not so strangely—this coincides with Vajrayana Buddhism, which conceives of the wise man and the saint, the adept who has simultaneously attained wisdom and liberation, as a being made in the image and likeness of the diamond. Vajrayana is the way or doctrine of the bolt of lightning and the diamond. Vajra refers to a lightning bolt and also to the invulnerable, indestructible diamondlike nature both of the doctrine and of the state of beatitude that the ascetic attains to. At the same time vajra also stands for the male sex organ in Tantric rites and language. The vulva is the \"house of vajra\" and also wisdom. Series of metaphors composed of terms that now belong to the corporeal world, now to the incorporeal world: the lightning bolt and the phallus, the vulva and wisdom, the diamond and the beatitude of the liberated yogi. The series of material terms culminates in a metaphor that identifies the discharge of celestial fire with the hardness of the diamond—a petrification of the flame; the series of psychic terms ends with another image in which the carnal embrace is indistinguishable from the indifference of the ascetic during meditation—a transfiguration of passion into essence. The two metaphors in the end become one: a fusion of the macrocosm and the microcosm.\n\nPairs of contrasting concepts such as those I have just mentioned appear in all cultures. What seems significant to me is that in Tantric Buddhism the duality is manifested in this very fire/diamond, eroticism/indifference polarity. The final resolution of this double opposition in terms of the paired concepts diamond/indifference is no less notable. The supreme Buddha is Vajrasattava, the adamantine essence in Sanskrit; the Tibetans call him the Lord of Stones. The surprising thing is that in its origin vajra (the lightning bolt) was the arm of Indra, the jolly, dissolute Vedic god. There is an arch that unites the two poles of the human spirit through the centuries. An arch which in this case goes from Indra, the god of storms and drunkenness, the god of the terrible burst of laughter that hurls all the elements into primordial confusion, to the impassible, imperturbable, adamantine Buddha, absorbed in the contemplation of his emptiness.\n\nFrom the Vedic hymn to the manual on meditation, from the bolt of lightning to the diamond, from laughter to philosophy. The path from fire to stone, from passion to hardness, is analogous in the religious tradition of India and in European libertine philosophy. The difference is that the former offers us a total, though dizzying, vision of man and the world while the latter ends in a blind alley. In short, we live between the earthquake and petrification, between myth and philosophy. At one extreme, convulsive laughter pulls down the edifice of our principles and we run the risk of perishing beneath the ruins; at the other extreme, philosophy threatens us with mummification in life, whatever the mask we choose, whether it be that of Calvin or that of Sade. These are ruminations in the shadow of Coatlicue:¹ destruction through movement or through immobility. A theme for an Aztec moralist.\n\n¹ An Aztec goddess represented with a girdle of skulls.\n\nINCARNATION AND DISSIPATION\n\nSince man has been man, he has been exposed to aggression, either that of others or that of his own instincts. The expression since man has been man means, first, since our birth, and second, since the species stood up on its feet and adopted the erect posture. In this sense our condition is not historical: the dialectic of the pleasure principle and the reality principle unfolds in a zone untouched by the social changes of the last eight thousand years. Nevertheless, there is a difference: ancient societies established institutions and used methods that absorbed and transformed the aggressive instincts more easily and with less danger to the species than those of today. On one hand, systems of transformation of obsessions, impulses, and instincts into myths and collective images; on the other hand, rites: the incarnation of these images in ceremonies and festivals. I hardly need add that I believe neither in the superiority of those cultures that have preceded us nor in the superiority of our own culture. I fear that a healthy society is a utopia; and, if it is not, it is situated neither in the historical past nor in the future, at least the future such as we see it from the point of view of the present.² Nonetheless it seems obvious to me that antiquity (or antiquities, for there are several of them) offered a gamut of possibilities for sublimation and incarnation that was richer and more effective than ours.\n\n² Claude Lévi-Strauss believes that if a golden age ever existed, it must have been in the villages of the Neolithic period. He may be right. The State was still in the embryonic stage, there was almost no division of labor, metals (arms) were unknown, as was writing (a bureaucracy of scribes/a mass of slaves), and religion had not yet produced an organized clergy. Kostas Papaioannou told me almost the same thing a number of years ago, showing me little female fertility figures: happiness personified, a perfect accord with the world.\n\nSo-called primitive cultures have created a system of metaphors"
