Translator: Margaret Jull Costa Imprint: Serpent's Tail Pages: 432 Subject: Fiction, World Literature https://serpentstail.com/the-book-of-disquiet-8029.html The Book of Disquiet is one of the great literary works of the twentieth century. Written over the course of Fernando Pessoa's life, it was first published in 1982, pieced together from the thousands of individual manuscript pages left behind by Pessoa after his death in 1935. Now this fragmentary modernist masterpiece appears in a major new edition that unites Margaret Jull Costa's celebrated translation with the most complete version of the text ever produced. It is presented here, for the first time in English, by order of original composition, and accompanied by facsimiles of the original manuscript. Narrated principally by an assistant bookkeeper named Bernardo Soares - an alias of sorts for Pessoa himself - The Book of Disquiet is 'the autobiobraphy of someone who never existed', a mosaic of dreams, of hope and despair; a hymn to the streets and cafés of 1930s Lisbon, and an extraordinary record of the inner life of one of the century's most important writers.

This new edition represents the most complete vision of Pessoa's genius. About the author Fernando Pessoa was born in Lisbon in 1888. He grew up in Durban, South Africa, where his stepfather was Portuguese consul. He returned to Lisbon in 1905 and worked as a clerk in an import-export company until his death in 1935. Most of Pessoa's writing was not published during his lifetime; The Book of Disquiet first came out in Portugal in 1982. Since its first publication, it has been hailed as a classic. The new edition was edited by Jerónimo Pizarro and translated by Margaret Jull Costa. Reviews The very book to read when you wake at 3am and can't get back to sleep - mysteries, misgivings, fears and dreams and wonderment. Like nothing else. - Philip Pullman In a time which celebrates fame, success, stupidity, convenience and noise, here is the perfect antidote - John Lanchester, Daily Telegraph A complete masterpiece, the sort of book one makes friends with and cannot bear to be parted with. Boredom informs it, but not boringly. Pessoa loved the minutiae of what we care to deem the ordinary life, and that love enriches and deepens his art - Paul Bailey, Independent A meandering, melancholic series of reveries and meditations ... beguiling and mysterious - William Boyd Disturbs from beginning to end... There is a distinguished mind at work beneath the totally acceptable dullness of clerking. The mind is that of Pessoa. We must be given the chance to learn more about him - Anthony Burgess, Observer\n\nJACKSON, Kenneth David, \"Pessoa's Voluptuous Skepticism\" (2016).

Search's reading of English poetry across time, his imitation of variable styles in English, and his search for an aesthetic ideal characterize a youthful period of voluptuous reading and skeptical despair that may be compared to FitzGerald's pursuit of classical translation through poetic imagination. RESUMO Fernando Pessoa estudou avidamente a literatura inglesa durante a sua formação na África do Sul, e o seu autor fictício Alexander Search escreveu cerca de 115 poemas, imitando o estilo de poetas ingleses-de Wyatt a Byron-, antes e depois da volta de Pessoa a Lisboa em 1905. A relação de Search com a poesia inglesa, a sua imitação de estilos variados e a busca do jovem Pessoa por um ideal estético caracterizam um período juvenil, de intensa leitura e de desespero cético, comparável à busca de FitzGerald por uma tradução clássica através da imaginação poética.

Fernando Pessoa House, Call number 8-­‐‑541].\n\nFernando Pessoa and all his heteronyms, these folding screens behind which the real human being known as Fernando Pessoa was hiding from view, was a great puppet master who was even able to puppeteer his own personal puppet that was, of course, nothing comparable to the isolated and probably slightly autistic and psychotic man he was. But we will never know, and do we want to know the real suffering of the man? The writings of these heteronyms, these personae the author assumed to protect himself are all that is important and all we should be looking at and considering. These books are haunted by the fear to be discovered and revealed, if not exposed in all his shortcomings, failings, but also beliefs he did not dare reveal to the world and the people close to him, though we seem to know there were not many people around him."
