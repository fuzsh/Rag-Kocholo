        "text": "Texas Border Business\n\nWASHINGTON— Congressman Henry Cuellar (TX-28) released the following statement today after the House passed the STOP School Violence Act of 2018:\n\n“We have a responsibility to ensure that every child can go to school feeling protected and safe. That is why I voted today in support of the STOP School Violence Act of 2018, which takes a comprehensive approach to help prevent a horrific school shooting before it takes place. This commonsense legislation combats senseless violence by including new violence prevention training for students and school personnel, anonymous reporting systems, improved local law enforcement coordination, and updated security technology.\n\n“Earlier this year, Representative John Culberson (TX-07) and I introduced a bipartisan bill, the Fix NICS Act, which will close dangerous loopholes in National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) that led to heartbreaking tragedies like the ones we witnessed in Sutherland Springs and in Florida.\n\n“I am pleased to say that Fix NICS Act passed the House of Representatives and I thank Senator John Cornyn for his steadfast leadership and success in obtaining 70 Senate co-sponsors. Now, more than ever, it is time that our colleagues in the Senate take action and vote on this crucial bill.”"
