        "text": "US Congressman Henry Cuellar, who has served as a Democratic representative of Texas for nearly two decades, was indicted on Friday with his wife on charges of bribery, unlawful foreign influence, and money laundering.\n\nIn announcing the indictment, the US Department of Justice stated the couple is accused of having accepted about $600,000 in bribes from an oil company fully owned and controlled by the government of Azerbaijan, and from a Mexico City bank.\n\nIn exchange for the funds, Cuellar is accused by US prosecutors of having agreed to use his congressional position to lobby for US foreign policy outcomes favorable to Azerbaijan, and to pressure US executive officials to endorse policies favorable to the Mexican bank.\n\nThe funds were allegedly funneled through various middlemen and front companies owned by Cuellar’s wife Imelda, who according to the DOJ, “performed little to no legitimate work under the contracts.”"
