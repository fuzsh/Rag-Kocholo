        "text": "Congressional Report\n\nDear Friend,\n\nCongress is back in session and I have heard many of your concerns recently. Please know that I am working hard in Washington, D.C. to bringing a voice the issues affecting Congressional District 28.\n\nI hope you were able to pause and reflect on the anniversary of 9/11 this week. We will never forget the bravery and heroism of the first responders and the men and women who tragically lost their lives. This week, our nation stands strong in remembrance and our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families.\n\nYou can find out what I'm doing by following me on Facebook and Twitter. Remember to sign up for my email list here to keep in touch if you have not already subscribed.\n\nMy Statement on the Threat of ISIL\n\nThis past week, the President announced that the United States will lead a broad coalition of our allies to defeat ISIL and deny them safe haven. Now is the time to rally behind the men and women of our armed forces and it is not a time to play politics. Confronting the threat of ISIL requires national unity and I urge the President and my colleagues in Congress to act swiftly and decisively on this plan to defeat ISIL. My thoughts and prayers continue to go out to the families of the two Americans who were brutally murdered by ISIL.\n\nA Back to School Message from Congressman\n\nCuellar (VIDEO)\n\nMeeting with Israeli Ambassador and\n\nHong Kong Commissioner\n\nIt was great meeting with Israeli Ambassador to the United States Ron Dermer and I met recently to discuss our shared commitment to security in the Middle East and around the world.\n\nSimilarly, Hong Kong’s new Commissioner to the United States, Clement Leung, and I discussed our shared commitment to trade. Hong Kong is America’s ninth largest trading partner and a major importer of American products.\n\nMeeting with UT Law students in D.C.\n\nMeeting with Constituents in Poth,\n\nTexas\n\nRoma ISD Opens New Veterans\n\nMemorial Elementary School\n\n​My Outreach Coordinator in Starr County, Narda Terrones, presented a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol to the newly opened Veterans Memorial Elementary School in Starr County. The facility will meet the needs of the growing communities of Escobares and Garceno. Congratulations, Roma ISD!\n\nHonoring New Hospital CEO and\n\nDistinguished Businessman in Laredo\n\nMy Outreach Coordinator for Webb, Zapata and La Salle Counties, Michael Buentello, presented Laredo Medical Center's new CEO, Enrique Gallegos, with my Congressional Certificate of Recognition at a welcome ceremony in Laredo on September 9th, 2014.\n\nOutreach Coordinator Michael Buentello attended the 2014 Distinguished Business Awards Ceremony honoring Mr. Gene S. Walker, Sr. held at the Laredo Country Club on August 28.\n\nNadia Quintero, Mission District Office\n\nIntern Spotlight\n\n​Pharr native Nadia Quintero interned in my Mission District Office, where she assisted in constituent services and local outreach.\n\nPharr native Nadia Quintero is finishing her internship with my Mission District Office.\n\nNadia is a freshman at University of Texas at Austin. She is double majoring in Economics and Political Science. She enjoys spending time with her family, listening to music, reading, shopping, playing volleyball and going to the movies.\n\nNadia decided to intern with my office because she is interested in politics and government and wanted to gain an inside view of what it is like to work at a congressional office. She plans to continue studying and obtain her doctoral degree.\n\nShe says she has enjoyed working on cases and has learned many new skills that will help her succeed. She says she has gained valuable leadership and communication skills and how to work in a team.\n\nNadia says, \"Being an intern for Congressman Cuellar has been a whole new experience that I will never forget. I gained and learned many skills that will help me achieve in the future. It has been a prestigious opportunity working with Congressman Cuellar’s office.\"\n\nThank you, Nadia, for you amazing contribution to our congressional office in Mission, Texas. I wish you the very best of luck in your studies and career.\n\nLatest Tweets from TX28\n\nSincerely,\n\nP.S.
