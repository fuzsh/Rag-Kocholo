        "text": "History\n\nFor over three decades, CHSA has served as a professional development catalyst, peer support system, and personal enrichment organization for numerous congressional staffers--Latino and non-Latino alike. As an official, non-partisan, bicameral congressional staff organization, recognized by the Committee on House Administration, CHSA's mission is to recruit, retain, and advance Hispanic Staffers in the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nCHSA continues to push for more diversity on Capitol Hill. Congressional staffers advise elected officials on issues affecting all Americans. From communicating with constituents to drafting legislation, staff plays a vital role in the operations, oversight, appropriations and policy decisions of the legislative branch. Because the duties of the legislative branch are so important to our nation, it is crucial to have all communities represented, so each have a voice in the process.\n\nIn an effort to promote career advancement, CHSA launched a new mentoring program that matches its members with senior staff and other experienced Hill professionals. In recent years, the organization has brought in distinguished speakers through the Trailblazers and Lideres initiative, which brings CHSA members face-to-face with decision-makers. It has also started a professional development series to help Hill members, and individuals wishing to get on Capitol Hill, improve their resumes, cover letters, and interview skills.\n\nâ€‹\n\nThrough programming, members have had the opportunity to build professional, one-on-one relationships that help them advance their careers on Capitol Hill, and outside the Hill, to achieve their aspirations. As we celebrate the milestone of having the most Members of Congress of Hispanic descent, we look to make equally historic gains in the number of staffers."
