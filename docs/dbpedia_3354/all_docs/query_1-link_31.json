        "text": "Herbert E. Carter Fellowship in Biochemistry\n\nThe Carter fellowship honors the late Herbert E. Carter, a University of Illinois alumnus (PhD, ’34, chemistry) and faculty member who was hailed as the “Father of Sphingolipids.” He served as head of the Department of Chemistry, director of the School of Chemical Sciences, and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs. Professor Carter’s pioneering work determined the structure of sphingosine, from which he coined the term “sphingolipids” to encompass the family of cerebrosides, sphingomyelins, and gangliosides that are associated with the brain and nervous system. He also made significant contributions to the structural knowledge of glycolipids and antibiotics. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1953.\n\n2023 Recipient:\n\nJunyao Zhu (Dr. David Shapiro)\n\n2022 Recipient:\n\nYanheng Chen (Dr. Lin-Feng Chen)\n\n2021 Recipient:\n\nDarjan Duraki (Dr. David Shapiro)\n\n2020 Recipient:\n\nUllas Valiya Chembazhi (Dr. Auinash Kalsotra)\n\nLowell P.
