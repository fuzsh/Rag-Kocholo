Congressman Henry Cuellar (TX-28) ranked 5th most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 115th Congress. The BPI is a non-partisan tool that measures the degree to which Senators and Representatives work across party lines on legislation. Congressman Cuellar stands on the list as the 2nd highest-ranked House Democrat.\n\n“I pride myself on my ability to work with both sides of the aisle to get things done for my constituents,” said Congressman Cuellar. “When Republicans and Democrats put politics aside, we are able to get things done and move our country forward. In the midst of a hyper-partisan era in Washington, I am glad to transcend party lines and pursue commonsense solutions for the American people. Congress is meant to function based on compromise, and I intend to continue to fulfill that promise.”\n\nAbout The Lugar Center:\n\nUnder the leadership of former U.S. Senator Richard Lugar, the non-profit Lugar Center is a platform for informed debate and analysis of global issues, including nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, global food security, foreign assistance effectiveness and global development, energy security, and enhancing bipartisan governance.\n\nAbout the McCourt School of Public Policy:"
