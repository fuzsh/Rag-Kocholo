        "text": "Last week, U.S. Congressman Henry Cuellar, Ph.D. (TX-28), a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, voted to pass an FY24 government funding bill that contains major wins for South Texas colleges and universities.\n\n“As a former college professor, I understand the important role that higher education plays in a young person’s career,” said Dr. Cuellar. “I am proud to have fought to increase funding for federal programs that expand access to educational and job opportunities for students – particularly those at Hispanic-serving institutions in South Texas. These investments will ensure that our students have the necessary resources to graduate, find a good-paying job, and lead meaningful lives.”\n\nSpecifically, Dr. Cuellar championed provisions that will provide:\n\n$228.9 million, an increase of $1.13 million for the Developing Hispanic-Serving Institutions Program, which provides federal education funding to primarily Hispanic colleges and universities, like Texas A&M International University, Laredo College, and the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley\n\n$27.45 million, an increase of $137,000 for the Promoting Postbaccalaureate Opportunities for Hispanic Americans Program, which provides federal education funding to expand postbaccalaureate opportunities for Hispanic students and Hispanic-serving institutions\n\n$7,395 for the maximum Pell Grant award, protecting the historic $900 increase to the maximum award secured in fiscal years 2022 and 2023\n\n$1.2 billion for Federal TRIO programs, which provide support, outreach, and motivation in higher education for students from disadvantaged communities\n\n$388 million for GEAR UP Grants, which provide federal education funding to states to encourage low-income students to enter and succeed in postsecondary education\n\n###"
