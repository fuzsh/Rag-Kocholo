        "text": "LAREDO, TX. (KGNS) - U.S. Representative Henry Cuellar has released a statement on Friday morning after reports of the Department of Justice possibly indicting him.\n\nCuellar calls these allegations a difficult time for him and he has sought out advice from the House Ethics Committee.\n\nBelow is Cuellar’s full statement:\n\n“I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations. Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas. Before I took any action, I proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm. The actions I took in Congress were consistent with the actions of many of my colleagues and in the interest of the American people. Furthermore, we requested a meeting with the Washington DC prosecutors to explain the facts and they refused to discuss the case with us or to hear our side. Imelda and I have been married for 32 years. On top of being an amazing wife and mother, she’s an accomplished businesswoman with two degrees. She spent her career working with banking, tax, and consulting. The allegation that she is anything but qualified and hard working is both wrong and offensive. These allegations have been difficult on my family. But, with your prayers, we will overcome. As the son of migrant workers, I was taught to wake up early and work hard. That’s exactly what I’ve always done for the people of South Texas. I’ve devoted my life’s work to creating jobs here, improving education, and securing our border. Let me be clear, I’m running for re-election and will win this November.”\n\nOn Friday morning, NBC News stated that two sources familiar with the matter informed the outlet of the expected formal charge against the Texas congressman.\n\nThis comes after Cuellar’s house and campaign officers were raided in Laredo back in January of 2022 as part of a federal investigation into Azerbaijan and a group of U.S. businessmen who have ties to the country, law enforcement said at the time.\n\nSince the raid, Cuellar’s office and the congressman have stated that they have been fully cooperating with the investigation.\n\nCuellar is a one-time co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus.\n\nAt this time, it’s not clear if the indictment is related to the 2022 raid. The Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nFor more headlines. click here."
