        "text": "LAREDO, Texas – U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar says his push to get Hispanic Serving Institutions equal footing with Historically Black Colleges and Universities has pulled in hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nCuellar, a senior member of the House appropriations committee, gave an exclusive interview to the Rio Grande Guardian International News Service about this push, along with news of the latest appropriations bill, which contains major wins for South Texas colleges and universities.\n\n“Higher Ed has always been very important. So, what I’ve been doing since I’ve been a member of the appropriations (committee, is) I’ve added literally hundreds of millions of dollars into developing Hispanic Serving Institutions, which serves UTRGV, South Texas College and so many universities and colleges in Texas and across the country,” Cuellar said.\n\n“So that is one thing I have focused on, (to) put money in there. But, on top of that, I went through the appropriations (process) and I did something that has not been done before – and I started this years ago – and that is making sure that every appropriation bill, if they do research, that they also include Hispanic Serving Institutions.”\n\nCuellar cited examples such as the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Defense.\n\n“I added language there to make sure that monies would go not only to Historically Black Colleges but also to Hispanic Serving Institutions. So that opened up the door for a lot of research dollars from agencies that might have not been there in the past.”\n\nAnother thing Cuellar is proud of is getting the National Science Foundation to change its policies.\n\n“There was a program that was set up for Historically Black Colleges. So, when I tried to add the language, the director called me up and said how we can do this? I said, why can’t we have the same type of funding (that goes to) Historically Black Colleges for Hispanic Serving Institutions?\n\n“And she basically told me, ‘No, we can’t do that because Hispanics are not monolithic. You’ve got Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans and Cubans.’ And I said, it doesn’t matter.\n\n“So, they resisted for a while, but we finally got it done. And so now, at the National Science Foundation, there’s a fund for Hispanic Serving Institutions. It took me a year or so to get it done, but I got it done.”\n\nHere is an audio version of the exclusive interview with Congressman Cuellar:\n\nFiscal Year 2024 Appropriations Bill\n\nCongressman Cuellar also provided the Guardian with information about the Fiscal Year 2024 government funding bill. He said it contains major wins for South Texas colleges and universities.\n\n“As a former college professor, I understand the importance that higher education can play in a young person’s career,” Cuellar said.\n\n“I am proud to have fought to increase funding for federal programs that expand access to educational and job opportunities for students – particularly those at Hispanic-serving institutions in South Texas. These investments will ensure that our students have the necessary resources to graduate, find a good-paying job, and lead meaningful lives.”\n\nSpecifically, Cuellar championed provisions that will provide:\n\n• $228.9 million, an increase of $1.13 million for the Developing Hispanic-Serving Institutions Program, which provides federal education funding to primarily Hispanic colleges and universities, like Texas A&M International University, Laredo College, and the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley\n\n• $27.45 million, an increase of $137,000 for the Promoting Post-Baccalaureate Opportunities for Hispanic Americans Program, which provides federal education funding to expand post-baccalaureate opportunities for Hispanic students and Hispanic-serving institutions• $7,395 for the maximum Pell Grant award, protecting the historic $900 increase to the maximum award secured in fiscal years 2022 and 2023\n\n• $1.2 billion for Federal TRIO programs, which provide support, outreach, and motivation in higher education for students from disadvantaged communities\n\n• $388 million for GEAR UP Grants, which provide federal education funding to states to encourage low-income students to enter and succeed in postsecondary education.\n\nCuellar said:\n\n“As a former college professor, I understand the importance that higher education can play in a young person’s career.\n\n“As the only Texas Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, I fought to increase funding for federal programs that expand access to educational and job opportunities for students – particularly those at Hispanic- serving institutions in South Texas.\n\n“These investments will ensure that our students have the necessary resources to graduate, find a good-paying job, and lead meaningful lives.\n\n“Specifically, we were able to secure $228.9 million, an increase of $1.13 million for the Developing Hispanic-Serving Institutions Program. This program provides federal education funding to primarily Hispanic colleges and universities, like Texas A&M International University, Laredo College, and the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley\n\nAdditionally, we were able to secure $27.45 million, an increase of $137,000 for the Promoting Post-Baccalaureate Opportunities for Hispanic Americans Program. This program provides federal education funding to expand post baccalaureate opportunities for Hispanic students and Hispanic-serving institutions. Universities in South Texas are recipients of grant funding from these programs.\n\n“Democrats were also able to sustain the amount for the maximum Pell Grant award at $7,395, which provides awards to undergraduate students who display exceptional financial need. This protects the historic $900 increase to the maximum award Democrats secured in fiscal years 2022 and 2023.\n\n“This year, we were also able to secure $1.2 billion for Federal TRIO programs, which provide support, outreach, and motivation in higher education for students from disadvantaged communities. Last year, in my district alone, 695 students benefited from over $1.37 million in funding for TRIO Programs.\n\n“Additionally, we secured $388 million for GEAR UP Grants, which provide federal education funding to states to encourage low-income students to enter and succeed in postsecondary education.”\n\nCuellar pointed to other higher education funding victories:\n\n• $52,123,000 for the High School Equivalency Program (HEP) and the College Assistance Migrant Program\n\n(CAMP) (Special Programs for Migrant Students). (Level Funding from FY23)\n\n• $75 million for the Child Care Access Means Parents in School, equal to fiscal year 2023.\n\n• $50 million for the HBCU, TCU, and MSI Research and Development Infrastructure Grants program, equal to fiscal year 2023.\n\n• $45 million for Postsecondary Student Success Grants, equal to fiscal year 2023.\n\n• $401 million for HBCUs, an increase of $5 million above fiscal year 2023\n\n• $910 million for the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant program, equal to fiscal year 2023.\n\n• $1.2 billion for Federal Work Study, equal to fiscal year 2023.\n\nBefore serving in Congress, Cuellar was a state representative. He said that during his time in the Texas House he secured various “wins” for students in higher education.\n\nHe cited the TEXAS (Toward EXcellence, Access and Success) Grant Program, for which he was the original author.\n\nHe said he also stablished the Towards Excellence, Access, and Success (TEXAS) Grant program.\n\n“This program assists students with financial needs, who are seeking to earn a college degree. It is now the largest grant program in the State of Texas, and it has been able to assist thousands of students in continuing into higher educational institutions,” Cuellar said, proudly."
