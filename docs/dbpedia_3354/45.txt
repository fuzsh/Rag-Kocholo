In an effort to connect Texas A&M International University (TAMIU) faculty and alumni in our nation’s capital, Congressman Henry Cuellar (D-TX-28) and Dr. Pablo Arenaz, newly-named president of TAMIU, on Tuesday evening hosted the first-ever TAMIU Alumni Meeting in D.C.

Congressman Cuellar received his Master of Business Administration in International Trade from TAMIU, formerly Laredo State University, in 1982.

“This meeting gave TAMIU officials and alumni who currently reside in D.C. an opportunity to learn how we can help each other out in Washington,” said Congressman Cuellar. “This gathering definitely opened up opportunities for TAMIU alumni in our nation’s capital. I thank Dr. Arenaz and TAMIU for helping to organize our first alumni meeting in Washington.”

In addition to the TAMIU officials and other alumni, three TAMIU alumni currently working in Congress attended the meeting. They include Carlos Sanchez, chief of staff for Rep. Joaquín Castro; Jorge Aguilar, press secretary at the Office of the Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi; and Juan Sanchez, legislative fellow for Congressman Henry Cuellar.
