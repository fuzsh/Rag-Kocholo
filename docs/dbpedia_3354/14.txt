Congressman Henry Cuellar credits education as the single most important tool in building a productive and successful life. He began his higher education by earning an associate’s degree from Laredo Community College. The skills and confidence he gained there enabled him to take the next step to Washington, D.C. While there, he washed dishes and held down other jobs as he earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Foreign Service from Georgetown University where he graduated cum laude.

Soon after graduation, Congressman Cuellar returned to Texas to earn degrees in International Trade at Texas A&M International University, a law degree from the University of Texas-Austin and a Ph.D. in Government from UT-Austin. Today, he is the most degreed Congressman serving in the House with five advanced degrees.

As Laredo’s former State Representative, Congressman Cuellar was a statewide influential legislator who served in leadership positions in the most powerful House committees – the House Appropriations, Higher Education and Calendars committees. Congressman Cuellar’s top priorities continue to include improving education, increasing access to affordable healthcare and prescription drugs, and bringing better jobs and wages to Texas.
