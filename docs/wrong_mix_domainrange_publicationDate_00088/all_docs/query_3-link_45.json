        "text": "Bonnefoy Créations in Les Villettes is a family story. A story that has been built since 1940 around textiles at the initiative of Jean-Marie Bonnefoy. At the time, the small company was focused on the manufacture of girdles and suspender belts. Then in the 70s, Marc Bonnefoy, his son, took over the family business and developed the creation of knitted accessories. A know-how that Chloé Bonnefoy still perpetuates today, the 3e generation of the family to take over the Altiliger company.\n\nScarves, stoles, hats, berets, gloves, mittens, ponchos... Since 1972, these autumn-winter accessories have always been the stars of the collections. Bonnefoy Creations, to which Chloé Bonnefoy has however given a new dynamism and a new breath since 2011 by joining her father at the head of the company. It thus gives rise to the Maison Bonnefoy brand in 2015, by offering a whole range of items created and manufactured in France, rich in unique and historical know-how.\n\nThe perfect blend of tradition and modernity at the service of quality\n\nHistoric, because Bonnefoy Creation it is 80 years of intense creation, 80 years of transmission an ancestral know-how in the mesh to each person who makes up the Bonnefoy company team. It is 80 years of trends and as many techniques, mastery and meticulousness, especially in the hand finishing that have earned the Bonnefoy company the Living Heritage Company (EPV) label, rewarding excellence in know-how.\n\n80 , it is also the age of rachel trades , here since 1940 make it possible to knit exceptional products. Following a complex process of computer programming, Bonnefoy Création has also made room for digital technology in their manufacture, thanks to their straight looms. A perfect marriage between tradition and modernity, at the service of French quality.\n\nA \"French touch\" which has been exported since 1997 all over the world, in all European countries, but also in Asia and America. In all, Bonnefoy Création exports its knits to around thirty countries around the world. Its fashion accessories, but not only… Because since 2021, the house has launched its very first collection home decor accessory.\n\nA collection of knitted throws big or small stitch, in wool and/or mohair, rich in colours, which makes you want to cocoon in the hollow of the sofa.\n\nSensitive to environmental issues, Bonnefoy Créations has been trying for several years to limit its carbon footprint by supporting French and local manufacturers. Their recycled packaging, labels and pouches are thus produced by neighboring manufacturers. This ecological commitment has also given rise to an ethical range of products made from organic and recycled materials: Justin (recycled cashmere), Claude and Patrice (recycled materials)."
