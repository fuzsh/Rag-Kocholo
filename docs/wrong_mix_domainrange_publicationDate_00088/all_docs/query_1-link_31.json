        "text": "I just read your link. ^\n\nPretty interesting and yes, the whole conversation required some focus and concentration from me, but still, I liked the gist of it. I like the idea of how these teeny things fuse and branch and mesh and interconnect and just...live on and among and within. Are they the truest of all survivors?\n\nI don’t think I’d ever read the book though, because it might be too hard for me, but I can see it being a very “Musket kind of book.” Also, lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about the weblike network of stuff over our muscles. What’s it called? Had to google and oh yeah...I’m thinking of fascia! This was actually in back of mind as I was reading your link and it made me wonder if, and how, fascia is similar to fungi.\n\nYep, that’s what I wondered.\n\nBut the fascia over my brain is way too shrunken, knotted, and dried up these days to figure it out.\n\nI suppose I’m a lesser human than fungi.\n\nI have a few of those so we have some of the same tastes after all. Lolita is a favorite of mine. Do you like Henry Miller? I like Carroll's Through the Looking Glass as well. I don't know if I still own those...I have to look.\n\nI've been reading poetry journals lately, looking for fresher stuff. It's hard to weed out the \"good\" from the bad and mediocre, but I've been enjoying it. I was recently selected to be published for a new anthology of fictional shorts about sex workers. I've been looking at their publications and their poets from the US and UK. They publish a lot of transgressive fiction and similar poetry.\n\nI read a lot of unknown writers, or writers who I personally know from small presses. One of the last great works I read was The Late Season by Stephen Hines on Tangerine Press, which is out of the UK. Best collection of short stories I've read in a really long time.\n\nI've been reading poetry journals lately, looking for fresher stuff. It's hard to weed out the \"good\" from the bad and mediocre, but I've been enjoying it.\n\nI think 5 to 7 years ago I was far more \"obsessed\" with seeking out more contemporary writers... and composers for that matter. Among the contemporary writers I admired most I'd include:\n\nCormac McCarthy\n\nThomas Pynchon\n\nDon DeLillo\n\nMargaret Atwood\n\nMilan Kundera\n\nPeter Ackroyd\n\nMario Vargas Llosa\n\nGünter Grass\n\nJosé de Sousa Saramago\n\nMcCarthy is probably best known for the novels The Road and No Country For Old Men thanks to the films but his \"Border Trilogy\" (All the Pretty Horses, The Crossing, and Cities of the Plain) and Blood Meridian are his masterpieces IMO. Harold Bloom compared Blood Meridian to Shakespeare and Melville's Moby Dick and I quite concur. The Judge is one of the greatest villains in literature and the passages describing the American West often verge on the visionary... yet the novel is also one of the most harrowing.\n\nAtwood's The Handmaid's Tale is almost essential reading against our current increasingly authoritarian politics.\n\nPeter Ackroyd is incredibly prolific... and fluid in fiction and non-fiction. He's written marvelous works of biography and history on subjects including William Blake, Thomas More, Chaucer, Shakespeare, J.M.W. Turner, Albion and English arts, London, ancient Egypt. His novels are often based upon non-fiction and frequently blur the line between the two.\n\nGünter Grass? Well, The Tin Drum is IMO one of the greatest novels of the later half of the 20th century... and one of the funniest. His observations on artists and art school are hilarious... and spot-on.\n\nAs I noted earlier, I tend to read far more poetry and short fiction than novels. Among the great contemporary poets I most admire I would include:\n\nYves Jean Bonnefoy\n\nAnne Carson\n\nCharles Simic\n\nRichard Howard\n\nRichard Wilbur\n\nAdam Zagajewski\n\nWisława Szymborska\n\nIzabella (Bella) Akhmadulina\n\nAndrei Voznesensky\n\nSeamus Heaney\n\nRichard Howard is a Cleveland-born poet who I discovered as THE translator of Baudelaire's Fleurs d mal the collection of poetry which became my \"Bible\" as an art student. It still remains among my favorite books and I have Howard's translation here with me in this hotel room. I was fascinated by Howard's marvelous sensuous epistolary poems.\n\nI also discovered Richard Wilbur first of all as a translator... of French poetry and drama (Molière, Corneille, Racine). Wilbur was a modern classicist... often employing historical poetic forms like the sonnet, ballad, etc... complete with the most fluid rhymes... yet dealing with contemporary themes. His poem, Piazza di Spagna, Early Morning which I posted here: Poem of the Day\n\n...in the thread on favorite poems remains one of my favorites.\n\nAnne Carson may be my favorite living poet. She's a masterful translator from the Greek and Latin. Her own poetic works employ quotes, false translations, drama, prose, and a wealth of poetic forms.\n\nI currently have a few different books of different types going.\n\nI'm reading The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson. It's a pretty thick fantasy novel that I'm crawling through. I've read some of his other stuff and enjoyed it a lot, but this series has a lot more depth to it.\n\nI'm also reading Domain Driven Design, which is a software programming design patterns book describing the DDD methodology. It's not the most interesting programming book I've read, but the methodology is massively important to understand for this current step in my career. I've also been reading some other design pattern books, which have been more interesting.\n\nFinally, I'm reading through A Guide To Drawing (7th Edition), which is one of the steps in my current strategy of tackling and relearning drawing fundamentals I haven't been exposed to since high school. I found it randomly in an old box when I was searching for some unrelated hobby materials, and don't actually recall how I came to own the thing. It's a very well paced book and I've been very happy with the drawing exercises the book has you work through. I'm hoping to continue working through each section to further grow my skills in drawing.\n\nI read Atwoods Handmaid's Tale in my early 30s after studying cults and mind control psychology. It was a good read, but I actually found her writing style a little flat for my liking in all honesty. I wouldn't consider her a \"fresh\" new writer, but maybe that is not what you meant.\n\nI read The Tin Drum in my teens and did not find it \"funny,\" but the writing style was good. I found it disturbing at the time, but it could have been over my head when I was just 16 or so. I thought it was kinda heavy and dark, but my tastes have changed since then.\n\nI had read a lot of T.S. Elliot and Tolstoy early on...oh and I have mentioned before Bastard Out of Carolina in the past by Dorothy Allison. That is a great novel based on a kind of memoir. I read that a long time ago too and thought she was a new voice at the time, but maybe she wasn't. Myla Goldberg I was reading from her first novels, well before they made Bee Season into a mediocre movie. I also am in love with Miranda July. Her first book of short stories is my favorite. I did find out about her from her first film though: You and Me and Everybody Else. Her style of writing is exactly up my alley, as well as John Fante. He's probably my favorite writer of all time.\n\nMost of the poets I listed died within the last decade with the exceptions of Anne Carson, Charles Simic, and Richard Howard. Simic is 83 and Howard is 92. Anne Carson is the \"youngest\" of the bunch at 71. Two \"giants\" I forgot to include are Geoffrey Hill and John Ashberry... who both died within the past 6 years. Prior to their deaths, both were cited as possibly the best poets writing in English.\n\nMaking judgments as to the merits of contemporary writers is every bit as challenging as making such judgments about contemporary artists... probably more difficult considering that reading a book is more time-consuming than looking at a work of art.\n\nI'll admit I haven't kept up as much with contemporary literature as I did in the past. Part of this may be due to the collapse of the literature forum that I followed for a good number of years where I was introduced to a good many writers. Part of it is also due to my delving more into non-English Language writers. I also suspect this owes something to my digging deeper into and spending more time with music.\n\nFante was most popular in the 1930s but made a \"comeback\" in the 80s right before he passed away, which was when I was introduced to him, thank goodness. I found out about him because of Charles Bukowski, who was a fan, and got his work republished with Black Sparrow Press (his longtime publisher). Luckily, his editor didn't butcher Fante's work as he did Bukowski's. Fante's work was made into a few bad films like Ask the Dust. I wasn't a fan of the movie because the novel is so damn good, which is usually the case of most books that become Hollywood movies.\n\nAlthough, I read a book a long time ago called Push, written in a similar vernacular to Alice Walker's The Color Purple (also made into a pretty good movie). Push was made into a movie called Precious (I believe was the name), and it was very good. It was cleaned up quite a bit because the book was one of the most intense and graphic novels I may have ever read. The film was very optimistic, which was a nice take on something horrible that had a happy ending. The novel had that too, but not before she went to hell and back.\n\nMusic has a sore/bittersweet spot for me, which is maybe why I don't participate in those music threads so much. It was once my life. I have feelings that it was taken away from me, which are probably just distorted beliefs really. Not being able to play anymore due to illness, and going through a lot of undue stress/pressure cooker trauma being on the road, etc. It all led to a bad situation that took me out of the game that I was thriving in. Then, I just couldn't work. It pummeled me completely. I couldn't even listen to music for years after that. Seriously. Maybe because it means so much to me.\n\nNow I listen to it sparingly, and when I do, I truly listen, and almost like a study. I was/am also a songwriter, so I can't help but to listen to composition and production, and all the little crazy details. I'm a huge Beatles fan (who isn't?), so I still listen to a lot of that. But while doing other things, I can't listen to anything except classical or my mind can't be in two places at once. My brain is too deep into the music, and I can't talk to other people, or read, or paint, etc. I'm greatly affected by it.\n\nI'm super picky with classical. I'm into Mozart mostly (all of it, because he was THE genius in my opinion), but I also love Chopin, Mendelssohn, Tchaikovsky, and some Beethoven (depending); I'm not so into his symphonies as I am his string quartets.\n\nWell, this was long! And not totally about books. Sorry.\n\nThe last thing I think I read was a Jenny Lawson book: Let's Pretend This Never Happened. Intense and very funny. She is an excellent writer and journalist."
