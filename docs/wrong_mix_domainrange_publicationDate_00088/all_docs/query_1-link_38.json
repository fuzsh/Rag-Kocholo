Contributor of numerous articles and essays to journals, including Journal of Beckett Studies, Review d'Histoire Litteraire de la France, L'Esprit Crèateur, Yale French Studies, Critical Inquiry, Nouvelle Revue Française, Critique, and New Literary History.\n\nSIDELIGHTS: Yves Bonnefoy has been associated with the tradition of nineteenth-century French poets Charles Baudelaire and Arthur Rimbaud, as well as with the postwar surrealists. A metaphysical poet, he is distinguished, according to Michael Hamburger in The Truth of Poetry, by the conviction that \"poetry has to do with truth and with salvation.\" In a review of Galway Kinnell's translation of Du mouvement et de l'immobilité de Douve in Poetry, Ralph J. Mills, Jr. pointed out that \"by general critical consensus Yves Bonnefoy is one of the finest poets to emerge in France since World War II.\"\n\nBonnefoy's first volume of poetry established his reputation. A sequence of short poems separated into several sections, Douve is a difficult work, described by Mills as \"reminiscent in part of the hermetic qualities of Mallarmé and Valéry and others whose technique involves obliquity, spiritual plenitude and vacancy.\" \"Douve\" is a female principle, which Bonnefoy himself defined as the relationship between consciousness and nothingness. She variously represents earth, woman, love, and poetry. The progress of the poem portrays changing moods and metaphysical transformations and sets up dialectics such as mind/spirit, hope/despair, and life/death.\n\nThe publication of In the Shadow's Light and Early Poems: 1947-1959 reinforced Bonnefoy's reputation as a great postwar poet, one dedicated to crafting verses that embrace and envelop human feelings and emotions. \"One cannot understand Bonnefoy,\" commented Stephen Romer in the Times Literary Supplement, \"without grasping the absolute nature of his commitment to poetry as a redemptive agent.\" As Craig Crist-Evans put it in Bloomsbury Review, \"Bonnefoy's is a poetry dedicated to the ways in which language, in all its fragmentation and metaphoric wonder, reflects the yearnings of modern man.\"\n\nThe difficulty of Bonnefoy's poetry arises in part from its remoteness from modern English and American poetry. Hamburger explained: \"Its language functions in a radically different way, its movement proceeds in a radically different direction; and above all it assumes an order of pure ideas, or of pure subjectivity, that can be evoked poetically with a minimum of sensuous substantiation.\" These distinctions are reinforced by what Bonnefoy calls the \"semitransparency\" of French words, as contrasted with the earthy opaqueness of English. The translation of Early Poems, for instance, was an enormous undertaking. A Stand reviewer suggested that translators Galway Kinnell and Richard Pevear did \"the best that could possibly be done in the face of these difficulties to give an account of Bonnefoy's journey of spiritual discovery and exploration.\"\n\nBonnefoy is a respected critic and scholar, as well as a poet, and has written essays on literature, art, and architecture. His translations of Shakespeare are considered to be among the best in French. Two non-poetic works from the early 1990s illustrate Bonnefoy's versatility. Alberto Giacometti: A Biography of His Work is a comprehensive study of the twentieth-century Italian artist (and friend of Bonnefoy). According to French Review contributor Adelia Williams, the author \"provides his reader with a highly complex portrait of one of the art world's most intriguing giants, whose lifelong drive was to represent the meaning of life.\" Mythologies, an enormous and far-reaching survey of mythological and religious traditions compiled by Bonnefoy, was published in 1991. The 1,250-page two-volume set focuses mainly on the myths of the ancient or traditional societies of Africa, the Middle and Far East, the Mediterranean, England, and the Americas—notably excluding coverage of Judaic and Christian religious traditions. \"Without claiming to be all-inclusive,\" noted Mark C. Taylor in the New York Times Book Review, \"Mythologies demonstrates the richness of a particular mode of analysis that can be used to interpret any cultural tradition.\"\n\nIn the late 1990s, Bonnefoy published Shakespeare et Yeats and Lieux et destins de l'image: Un cours de poétique au Collège de France, 1981-1993, among other books. Reviewing Lieux et destins de l'image in World Literature Today, Allen Thiher commented, \"Many would hold Bonnefoy to be the most important French poet alive today; so this collection is of no small attraction to all those interested in modern poetics.\" Richard Howard, reviewing The Lure and the Truth of Painting: Selected Essays on Art for Artforum, wrote, \"scattered through all of these lofty, aerial essays there are enough occasions of splendid and spectacular insight, clarifications and apprehensions so striking (and so immediately evident) that I believe it is worth exhorting ourselves to bestow the energy of patience in this work.\"\n\nThe 2001 collection Les Planches courbes \"brings home to us the affective and spiritual—in the largest sense of the word—urgency this writing continues to promote within and for all those who accede to it,\" stated Michael Bishop in World Literature Today. Shakespeare & the French Poet, a 2004 work, contains essays, critical interpretations, and an interview with Bonnefoy. \"The value of this text lies in Bonnefoy's unique perspective as he comments on his approach to Shakespeare,\" observed Library Journal contributor Shana C. Fair.\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nBOOKS\n\nCaws, Mary Anne, Yves Bonnefoy, Twayne (Boston, MA), 1984.\n\nContemporary Literary Criticism, Gale (Detroit, MI), Volume 9, 1978, Volume 15, 1980.\n\nDictionary of Literary Biography, Volume 258: Modern French Poets, Gale (Detroit, MI), 2002.\n\nFink, Michèle, Yves Bonnefoy, le simple et le sens, Corti (Paris, France), 1989.\n\nGavronsky, Serge, Poems and Texts, October House (Stonington, CT), 1969.\n\nHamburger, Michael, The Truth of Poetry, Harcourt (New York, NY), 1970.\n\nKostelanetz, Richard, editor, Yale French Studies 21, Avon (New York, NY), 1958.\n\nNaughton, John T., The Poetics of Yves Bonnefoy, University of Chicago Press (Chicago, IL), 1984.\n\nOn Contemporary Literature, Avon (New York, NY), 1964.\n\nRavaud, Jacques, editor, Yves Bonnefoy, Le Temps qu'il fait (Cognac, France), 1998.\n\nStamelman, Richard, Lost Beyond Telling: Representations of Death and Absence in Modern French Poetry, Cornell University Press (Ithaca, NY) 1990.\n\nTaylor, Jane, Double Vision: Studies in Literary Translation, University of Durham (Durham, England), 2002.\n\nThélot, Jérôme, Poètique d'Yves Bonnefoy, Droz (Geneva, Switzerland), 1983.\n\nThomas, Jean-Jacques, Concordance (Poems), Edwin Mellen Press (Lewiston, NY), 1989.\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nAmerican Book Review, October, 1991, p. 16.\n\nArtforum, summer, 1996, Richard Howard, review of The Lure and Truth of Painting: Selected Essays on Art, pp. S28-29.\n\nAsian Folklore Studies, October, 1994, Taryo Obayashi, \"Asian Mythologies,\" pp. 351-353.\n\nBloomsbury Review, September, 1991, p. 15.\n\nChoice, October, 1991, p. 287.\n\nDalhousie French Studies, fall, 2002, pp. 1-129.\n\nFrench Review, October, 1993, Adelia Williams, review of Alberto Giacometti: A Biography of His Work, p. 148.\n\nL'Esprit Créateur, winter, 1982, pp. 15-82; summer, 1990, pp. 38-46; summer, 1992, pp. 43-64; fall, 1994, pp. 14-21; fall, 1996, pp. 1-105.\n\nLibrary Journal, April 1, 1991, p. 124; September 15, 1991, p. 50; June 1, 2004, Shana C.
