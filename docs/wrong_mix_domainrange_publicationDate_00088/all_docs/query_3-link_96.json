        "text": "P-P-P-P-PART 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Woooooo! And i know its not in the correct week but.. um... yeahhhhh. Oh, and mods, the first part was in the correct week and was 3,496 words long. This part is 2,696 words!\n\nIvan felt warm. Warm and rested. And… sore? He shifted slightly, feeling that there was a large weight on his stomach. Slowly, he cracked open violet eyes, only to be met with piercing blue ones. He looked down slightly to find that a young boy, perhaps twelve or thirteen sat perched on his chest. The boy had hair that looked like gold and pale, almost translucent skin that spoke of someone who had never done a day’s work.\n\n“So you ARE a human!” The boy chirped, a wide grin lighting up his face.\n\nIvan couldn’t say anything for a few moments. He did not understand why this boy wasn’t scared of him, nor repulsed by him. “Yes,” he replied slowly, still staring blatantly at the adorable child in front of him.\n\n“Come on then!” the boy said, “daddy made breakfast! He wants you to meet my sisters!” the boy said, promptly jumping off of Ivan. “So what’s your name anyways? Or should I just call you bear man? I’m Alfred by the way,” the boy prattled, leading Ivan out of the room.\n\n“My name is Ivan,” he said, smiling. Listening to the boy talk was quite amusing. It was almost like the child was blind and could not see Ivan’s outwardly appearance.\n\n“Yvonne? Isn’t that a name for a woman? I think I might have an Aunt Yvonne, but she,” Alfred said, quickly being cut off.\n\n“Ivan. EE-von,” Ivan repeated.\n\n“OH! IVAN!” Alfred said nodding, “That makes more sense. But then again, under all that stuff you’re wearing, you may have been a girl. Who knows!” Alfred laughed, leading Ivan to the kitchen. “So...” Alfred said, as they descended the stairs. “You’re gonna marry one of my sisters?”\n\nIvan nodded, “That is what your father promised me in return for helping him out.”\n\n“Wow,” Alfred said as they rounded the corner to the kitchen, “You must have…” He started, but was cut off by a scream.\n\n“What is that!?” A woman said, yelling and thrusting a finger towards where Ivan and Alfred stood in the doorway. “Father!” the woman shrieked, turning to a stunned and embarrassed looking Francis. “You must be out of you mind if you want me to marry that… that… that thing!”\n\nIvan shrugged slightly. He had gotten used to this reaction. He felt a slight pull at his sleeve and looked down to see Alfred staring at him. “That my oldest sister…” Alfred trailed off, turning to look at the blonde woman who stood, fuming at the table, a disgusted look plastered across her pretty features.\n\n“And father, you really can’t expect me to marry him can you?” piped up another voice, belonging to the other woman who sat at the table. “I need a husband who will be a husband, not a beast who isn’t even close to being a man.”\n\n“And that,” Alfred said, tugging again on Ivan’s sleeve, “is my younger older sister…” Alfred said, nodding towards the other woman who wore a scandalously low cut dress and had a mess of auburn hair piled upon her head.\n\nIvan sighed. There was no way these woman would be able to accept him. He would much rather marry someone like Alfred.\n\n“Daughters please!” Francis pleaded, silent up until now, “This man has helped us out so very kindly and generously, and this is his reward for allowing us to have something on the table to eat and fine clothes for you to wear!”\n\n“I really don’t care father,” the elder daughter said. “That man is disgusting. He looks like he’s been cursed and he smells like he hasn’t bathed in years!”\n\n“And really father, how do you expect us to live and keep a man like that happy! He’s more beast than man, it looks like to me, and I so dislike a cold bed at night!” the younger daughter said with a sneer.\n\nIvan sighed again, moving to turn around. He didn’t need a wife. In three more years he would have all the company he would ever want. He would be rich, live in a grand mansion and most of all he would be clean.\n\n“I’ll marry Ivan!” came a loud voice to Ivan’s left.\n\nEveryone in the room seemed to hone in on Alfred as soon as the words left his mouth. “Dearest, you cannot do that!” Francis said, “Mr. Ivan needs a wife not a…” he started but was cut off by Ivan’s gruff growl.\n\n“I accept,” Ivan said, before leaving the family standing in the kitchen, completely dumbfounded.\n\n--\n\nIvan walked back to his room humming a cheerful tune. For the first time in months he felt happy. His burden felt light and the bear skin tied to his back felt like air. Everything had worked out better than planned. He would be able to marry Alfred instead of one of his bothersome sisters.\n\nHe turned slightly after hearing the soft pitter patter of feet behind him. He then felt a small hand tug at the bear skin on his back. “Uhhh… Ivan?” Alfred asked, “You’re not mad at me are you?”\n\nIvan smiled, crouching down to the boy’s height, “No, of course not, actually I’m very happy I get to wed someone like you!”\n\n“But I’m just a brat! That’s what my sisters always say and I don’t want to listen to them, but I can’t help it! I wanna be able to grow up big and strong so I can support my whole family especially my brother!” Alfred said.\n\n“Your brother?” Ivan asked. He had been under the impression that Alfred only had two sisters.\n\n“Yeah, his name is Matthew. Do you wanna meet him?” Alfred asked. “We have to be real quiet cause he’s always real sick and sleeps a lot.”\n\nIvan nodded and let the boy pull him towards a door at the end of the corridor. “Daddy is always sad that Mattie’s sick. He blames me and my momma,” Alfred began.\n\n“ But I don’t think it’s her fault. You see, me and Mattie are twins, but I’m the only one that came out healthy. Daddy says originally we was both gonna die, but momma made a deal with this strange man saying she’d trade her life for ours. Daddy didn’t want her to, but she did anyways. I came out okay but Mattie always looks like he’s gonna die. That’s why Daddy is always trying to spend money to make more money so that he can get medicine for Mattie,” Alfred said, looking downcast.\n\n“It’s cause Mattie looks just like momma,” Alfred said, finishing his story as the pair stood outside the door.\n\nIvan briefly wondered if the strange man Alfred’s mother had made a deal with was the same strange man he had made a deal with. He then slowly looped am arm around the boy’s shoulders and pulled the child close. “If you do not wish for me to see him, we can go somewhere else,” Ivan said, at seeing how uncomfortable the boy looked.\n\n“Do you mind?” Alfred said, still leaning against the older man. “We can go outside instead.”\n\nIvan smiled as he followed the boy outside. He sat down in the lush grass and watched as Alfred ran around for a few seconds and then laid out next to him. Ivan blushed at the proximity. It was amazing to him that a boy like Alfred had the courage to marry someone like him. “Why do you want to marry me?” Ivan asked, causing the blonde boy to roll over to stare at him.\n\n“Because….” Alfred began, pausing for a few seconds. Ivan just stared at him. That perfect golden hair, eyes the color of the sky, pale skin with a splash of freckles across the nose. He was too perfect. “Ummm… because,” Alfred finished.\n\n“Articulate,” Ivan said with a smirk.\n\n“Shut up!” Alfred whined, “It’s more than that really. I wanted to help… to be a hero. I’m such a burden, and I know my sisters didn’t want to marry you and I didn’t want them to go through with something they didn’t want to do. And I like you. Your… nice. Kinda weird, but nice. And you have pretty eyes!”\n\nIvan sighed. This boy, Alfred, was more amazing than he would have though. Overbearing, and too enthusiastic at times, but he had a good heart, even if he was an idiot. “You’re an idiot you know that?” Ivan said, “Are you really okay with marrying a complete stranger just because he had nice eyes?”\n\n“So tell me about yourself!” Alfred chirped.\n\nSo Ivan did.\n\nIvan’s stories carried on long into the day, the sun moving from high in the sky to hiding below the trees. They only stopped once, when Alfred brought them dinner. Ivan told the boy about his past, his sisters, the man in the green jacket and the curse he had been placed under. And when he finished telling Alfred about these things, he began telling the boy old stories his sister had told him. Tales of princesses and kings, curses and sorcerers. He spoke until the boy drifted off, and then he spoke no more, only moving to carry the boy to bed.\n\n--\n\nIvan spent the winter at Francis’s home. He worked, shoveled, cleaned. Anything that needed done he did. He watched as Alfred grew another inch. He watched as Alfred’s sisters shunned him for befriending Ivan. He watched as Francis would slip into Matthew’s room and then slip back out, leaving for days at a time. And for the first time, Ivan was not cold, even though the outside world was covered in ice.\n\nHowever, spring soon came and Ivan knew he had to make his way back to where he had first made his deal with the man in the green coat.\n\n--\n\nIvan stood in front of the door. He knew he had to leave, yet it was bittersweet. “Why must you go?” Alfred whined, clinging to Ivan’s side, ignoring the fact that he was making a scene in front of his sisters and his father.\n\n“Listen to me,” Ivan said. Bending down slightly to look Alfred in the eyes. “I will return in three years, to marry you, alright?”\n\n“S’not fair…” Alfred pouted, tears gathering in his eyes.\n\n“Come now Alfred, you say you always want to be the hero, so be the hero!” Ivan said, trying his best to sound reassuring.\n\n“M’kay,” Alfred mumbled.\n\n“I will see you in three years, Fredka. Do not forget,” Ivan said as he walked out of the house.\n\nAlfred watched with sad eyes as Ivan left the house.\n\n“I can’t believe you’re actually going to wait for him!” came a snide voice, a voice that could only belong to his older sister.\n\n“Really Alfred, why would you throw your life away and marry someone who doesn’t even want to stay with you hmmm?” his younger sister chimed in.\n\n“Shut up! The only reason he has to leave is so he can go see the man in the green coat!” Alfred shouted before dashing away.\n\nHis sisters only laughed, but his father immediately ripped the door open and ran after Ivan.\n\n--\n\n“Ivan! IVAN! WAIT!”\n\nIvan stopped and turned slightly at the sound of his name, surprised to find Francis running over to him.\n\n“You…ha….you said,” Francis panted, out of breath, “that you were going to see the man in the green coat right?!” he practically yelled, “if… ha…. So, I need you to give him this!”\n\nWith that, Francis pulled out a yellowed looking letter from his waistcoat. “I’ve been looking for this man for…ha… almost fourteen years now, so please… please make sure he gets it!”\n\nIvan nodded, taking the letter from Francis. He remembered the story Alfred had told him about him and his twin. He now knew that finding the spot he had almost died in all those years ago now bore more importance. He wasn’t the only one that had been cursed by the man in the green coat.\n\n--\n\nIvan returned to his old routine after leaving Francis’s home. He stayed away from villages and only traveled at night.\n\nHe thought of Alfred often. He dreamed of what their life would be like once he was normal. He thought endlessly about what if would be like to be accepted into society. He wondered what it would be like to stand at Alfred’s side, to touch him, to hold him, make sweet love to him. They would be able to move somewhere warm, live together without the bothers of his sisters. Perhaps he would even buy medicine to cure Matthew, if it would make his sunshine happy.\n\nFinally after many months of traveling, he arrived back at the spot where he had first met the man in the green coat.\n\n--\n\nIvan waited for many days until the man arrived. He seemed to just materialize out of the mist, or perhaps grow out of the frost covered ground. “Ah! So you did come!” the man said, sauntering over to where Ivan sat.\n\nIvan just nodded. All he wanted was for this to be over so that he could return to Alfred. “Yes. I am ready for you to fulfill your part of the bargain,” Ivan said, a menacing smile on his face.\n\n“Really now? So impatient? Do you have someone you need to get back to? But then again, who would ever want a disgusting monster like you?” the man in the green coat said, his eyes narrowing and a wicked pointed smile gracing his lips.\n\nIvan just smirked. He thought of clear blue eyes and blonde hair and how Alfred would look when he returned.\n\n“Ahhh…” the man said, “So even you have found someone! But I thinks that I could find you someone better!” he mused, “If so you would be willing to make another bet with me?”\n\n“I do not think so,” Ivan said, his voice rough, “However, I do have something for you,” he said pulling out the letter Francis had given him. “It’s from Francis Bonnefoy.”\n\nThe green eyed man just smiled wider than Ivan thought was physically possible, ripping the letter from Ivan’s hands, before savagely tearing it open. He smirked that began to read it out loud.\n\n“It was all a mistake and now I wish to correct it. My wife gave her soul to you for one son, so now I wish to give my soul to you for the other.”\n\n“Ha!” the man said, a wheezy, cruel sounding laughter coming out of his mouth, “Francis, Francis, Francis. You had to have known that you would be seeing me either way! But I suppose this does get your boy off the hook!” With a small flare of green light, the letter caught afire. Ivan could only watch as the man dropped the thing to the ground and pulled out a small leather bound volume and scratched something down.\n\n“November twelfth. Consider the exchange made Mr. Francois “Francis” Jean Bonnefoy!” he said with another laugh before snapping the book closed.\n\n“And now for you!,” the man muttered. “What had I promised you?”\n\n“No,” Ivan said, effectively cutting the man off. After what he had seen, he figured the only way to deal with this man was to match his cruelness “I will be making the rules now. First you will clean me. Second, I wish for God to know nothing of my dealings with the likes of you. Third, I wish to keep the purse and finally, you will deliver on your promise. All the riches I could desire.”\n\nThe man smirked, his cat like green eyes glinting. “Fair enough, a promise is a promise.”\n\n--\n\nThe first thing Ivan did was march straight into the nearest town. He marched down those streets like a man who had just been freed from years of slavery. He bought himself the finest clothes he could find, as well as a magnificent horse. After eating a good meal, he began to make his way towards the place he had left Alfred.\n\nHe traveled for many days, staying in tows along the way, always able to find accommodations. It shocked him slightly at first, how people were so receptive and welcoming to him. However, he could still flash them a cruel smile and they would scatter like cockroaches.\n\nThe days he traveled quickly turned into months and those months quickly turned into years. Before he knew it, the three years had passed, and then four, and then five and he still had yet to return to Alfred. He knew he was close, only a few more weeks of travel and then he would be in Alfred’s village and would be able to claim the man as his own.\n\nHowever, merciless thoughts plagued his head. What if Alfred had found another? What if he had gotten injured, or even killed in the time he had been away? What if he wasn’t the same person he left behind all those years ago? No. No! He had to stop thinking like that. Everything would be fine once he reached Alfred.\n\nI am delurking! Bwhahahahahaha!!!!!! I hope you enjoy this! holyshit its long....\n\nOnce upon a time in a far away land lived a man. This man was poor, naught but a peasant and was often avoided because of his intimidating size and poor relationship skills. The man had two sisters. An older one who cared for him, and a younger one, who was strange in more ways than one. The man lived for many years with his sisters, for they had no parents. However, when the man turned fifteen, his life began to change in a most horrible way.\n\n---\n\nIvan sighed, his fingers aching and his back hurting from the grave he had just filled in. He felt tears prickle his eyes as he placed a large stone at the head of the grave, making the place where his younger sister was now buried.\n\nHis elder sister did not even know of their younger sisters passing. She was instead away with her tyrant husband who did not let her see her siblings. Ivan hadn’t seen her in almost a year. The man she had wed had been of high status and very wealthy but was nothing but a greedy bastard with no respect for anyone but himself.\n\nIvan sighed as he picked up his shovel and walked further in the woods. He had nowhere to go now. His youngest sister was dead, his eldest was barred from seeing his to an extent that she might as well be dead too. He had no money, for he had sold their home in order to pay for treatment for his younger sister.\n\nHe sighed again, walking further down the dark path into the thick woods. Natalya had always been strange. She had grown up bitter and full of hatred. Ivan had did his best to show her kindness which only led to her becoming infatuated with him. She had gone completely crazy by the time she turned twelve, insisting that he marry her. She had thrown knives at him and their older sister Katyusha and had gone so far as to poison all the food in the house.\n\nNatalya only got worse when Katyusha left. She threw fits where one minute she would be screaming and sobbing and the next she would be laughing. One night when Ivan came home from his job he found Natalya sitting in the middle of the kitchen, covered in blood. Surrounding her were the heads of the three chickens and one pig that he had owned. Ivan had pleaded with her, asking her where the bodies were, for they were the only livestock that he had. She had only replied that the animals had to die because they were going to take Ivan away from her, just like they had taken Katyusha.\n\nIt was after that incident that Ivan had sought out the doctor. He sold their small house, needing the money to pay the man, and had walked into town, Natalya in tow. The doctor however proclaimed her to be mad, insisting that she accompany him to the insane asylum that was in one of the large cities. Upon hearing that, Natalya had went into a rage, throwing things, destroying the doctor’s office and screaming in panic, anger and fear.\n\nAfter Ivan had finally calmed her down, he managed to bring her back to their small house, but not after he had arranged for the asylum to pick her up the next morning. When the cart arrived, with the doctor standing next to it along with a few of the guards, Natalya had gone insane. She screamed at Ivan for not loving her anymore. Blamed him for Katyusha’s leaving. Blamed him for not having enough money to support all of them so they could be happy together. Ivan couldn’t help that work was almost impossible to find. He couldn’t help that Katyusha wanted a better life than the one she had shared with them. He couldn’t help that he only loved her as a sister. He had told Natalya this, which prompted her to grab one of the knives off the table and plunge it into her breast, all the while screaming, “Brother, brother, let’s get married, married, married!”\n\nIvan shuttered at the memory. He tried his hardest not to blame Natalya, but it was difficult. Because of her, he no longer had a home. He was shunned by the villagers and now only had the clothes on his back, the dirt in his pockets and the shovel on his shoulder.\n\nIvan glanced up at the sky. He needed to find a place to sleep for the night. He finally settled on a large overhang. He pulled his coat around him tighter. He was thankful he had the long, thick scarf Katyusha had made him. It was almost winter and the air was definitely getting much, much colder.\n\nWhen Ivan awoke, his face was caked in frost, his clothes were wet and his stomach was empty. Slowly he got up and began walking to the next town over in hopes of being able to find a meal. If worse came to worse, he could always sell his clothes and his shovel for something to eat.\n\n--\n\nWhen Ivan arrived in town people avoided him like the plague. He could understand why. He was large, over six feet tall and moved like a ghost. His skin and hair was pale. His strangely colored eyes were void of all emotion. Most people thought him to be some type of freak or perhaps a cursed man.\n\nHe wandered throughout the small market in the center of town, staring at the vegetables and breads. He missed the days when Natalya had been less ill and Katyusha had made them borscht. Ivan could feel himself reach for a particularly delicious loaf of rye bread when he felt something smack down hard on his hand.\n\n“Are you able to pay for that?” came a voice. Ivan looked up, peering into the face of the vendor.\n\n“Yes…” he trailed of, smiling sweetly.\n\nThe vendor cringed. “That’s 6 pieces of bronze for that bread boy,” he said, trying his best to stay cool under Ivan’s gaze.\n\n“That seems expensive,” Ivan said, still smiling, even though his eyes were burning holes in the man’s face. Ivan wanted that bread.\n\n“These are hard times you know….” The vendor replied, visibly shaken by Ivan’s presence and the dark aura that seemed to radiating off of him in waves.\n\n“I am aware, but surely you could make an exception,” Ivan said.\n\nThe vendor blinked. This man had to be cursed! “Yes, but only for you. I will give it to you for 4 pieces of bronze.”\n\nIvan shook his head slowly. “These times have been hitting me especially hard. Could you not make more of an exception?” Ivan asked, his eyes narrowing to almost slits, even though his smile remained in place.\n\n“I will give you two loaves of bread and a piece of cured meat in exchange for that shovel!” the vendor said quickly, praying that the man would just leave. Even though the man could not be older than sixteen, he had an evil, menacing presence of someone who had done something very, very bad.\n\nIvan pondered this. He did not want to sell his shovel. It was the only weapon he had. However it would be better to sell his shovel than his clothes and he needed the food. It also seemed like the man was offering him a good deal. Two loaves of bread and a hunk of meat could feed him until he was able to find some work.\n\n“That sounds like a good deal,” Ivan said, holding out his battered shovel.\n\nThe vendor nodded giving over the loaves of bread and the hunk of meat. He even tossed in a small chunk of honey comb, praying the pale haired boy would not curse him.\n\n--\n\nIvan sat in the woods, satisfied with the food he had purchased. He had even been able to find a little bit of work, moving chunks of stone, over at the church and had been paid 8 bronze pieces. A good start, but still nowhere near enough for any type of accommodation. That was okay though, because Ivan didn’t mind sleeping in the woods. It was peaceful and there were no people there to bother him.\n\nHalfway through the night, though, Ivan jolted awake, startled by a noise. If it was a wolf he would climb a tree. If it was a bear he would run. Anything else he could handle.\n\nIvan jumped slightly when he heard another noise. He wished he had not let his fire die out. Then he heard voices. Humans. He could deal with humans. He reached around, groggily searching for his shovel. He let out a low groan as he realized that he had sold it earlier that day. He glanced around, wishing he had something to fight with.\n\n“What do we have here?”\n\n“Looks like that brat who was in the market today, messing with father’s stand.”\n\n“I think we should teach him a lesson don’t you?”\n\n“I think that you’re right.”\n\n--\n\nIvan tried to open his eyes, the sun finally getting in a making him wish that he had just left them closed. Everything hurt. He was sure that one of his arms was broken, as well as his hand. He blindly felt his face with his good had, wincing when he made contact. It was puffy and bleeding. His ass hurt, as well as his lower back. He tried his best to ignore the pain and figure out where all of his stuff was. He looked around, noticing that his money and coat were both gone as well as his food. He let out a sharp cry as he saw his scarf, flung into the ashes of the fire.\n\nHe scrambled for the scarf, ignoring the symphony of pain. He had nothing now. He had no money, no food, no shelter and only his tattered and blood soaked pants and his ripped shirt to keep him warm. Slowly he got up and began walking into the forest.\n\n‘There is no way I would be able to afford a doctor,” he thought, ‘so I might as well die in peace.’\n\nAfter walking as far as he could for the day he slumped against a tree with a dull thud. He looked out upon the forest. He lay in a small circle of trees. All the leaves were almost gone and there was a light dusting of snow on the ground. It was not beautiful, but it was adequate. He would have preferred to die in a place that was warm, surrounded by flowers, to have his sisters there, singing songs of peace for him. To have a proper funeral, instead of dying in the forest like a dog.\n\nIvan slowly began to close his eyes. Soon the cold would take him. Perhaps when he met his sister again she would be healed and they could stay by each other for the rest of time.\n\n“Oi, you there? What do you think you’re doing?”\n\nIvan’s swollen eyes blinked open. In front of him stood a short man, probably no taller than five and a half feet. He had choppy blonde hair and large dark eyebrows that seemed out of place on his pointed, attractive face. The most curious thing about him however was his eyes. They glowed a bright green in the twilight and instead of pupils he had slits. Like a cat.\n\nHis dress was also particular. Even though it was snowing the man wore no hat or scarf, but instead a green and gray suit that nobles would wear. The arms however were slightly long and the pants were faded and baggy. Over these he wore a vivid, elaborately embroidered, expensive looking green coat.\n\nThe clothes looked like they had been stolen off a corpse.\n\nFloating around the man’s head were a few odd lights that seemed to flicker and spin. Ivan squinted, wondering if the man was just a figment of his imagination and injuries.\n\n“What do you want?” Ivan asked, “Can’t you just leave me here to die. Or are you here to collect me?”\n\n“NO I most certainly am not!” the man said, his face scrunching up like that of an old woman.\n\n“Then what do you want?” Ivan asked, noticing that the man had a strange sort of accent. It wasn’t like the accents he had heard from people from his country, or those of the few southern foreigners he had seen. The man’s accent seemed odd and forced, as if he were trying to sound more normal than he actually was.\n\n“The question isn’t what I want, it’s what you want,” the man said, his green eyes glinting silver.\n\n“I want to die,” Ivan said, “I have no money, no food, and cannot work in this state.”\n\n“Ah,” the man said, “but I can fix that, you see. I will give you all of that.”\n\nIvan stared. He knew this man, this thing, was not to be trusted. There was no way the man was to be trusted, and other worldly creatures in general liked to abuse and torture humans just for the fun of it. Just to show off their power. They were known for giving endless riches that turned to ash, or granting everlasting beauty and then taking away the sight of the one they loved.\n\n“What do you want in return?” Ivan asked. He had nothing to lose.\n\n“If you wish for me to only heal your wounds, it will cost you your left eye.” The man said.\n\nIvan frowned. He didn’t want to lose an eye. No one would hire a man who was half blind.\n\n“ However, I am interested in having some fun with you. I will heal you wounds and I will also give you a coin purse. This coin purse, once empty, will refill itself to the brim. As for your clothes, I will give you a dagger, which you will go into the woods with and kill a bear. Skin the bear and wear the pelt. However, you are not allowed to take the pelt off, nor cut your hair, bathe, or pray for seven years. When seven years are up, return to this place and I will give you all the riches you could want and you will be free from the pelt and will be able to bathe, pray and cut your hair again. But, if you die during that time, or try to take the pelt off, your soul will be stolen and will belong to me,” the man said, leaning close.\n\n“I…I…” Ivan stuttered. Seven years was such a long time, but he would have money. He could buy himself a house and live freely. The choice was easy.\n\n“I accept your offer. I will take the dagger and kill the bear and wear the pelt,” he said. “Now heal my wounds.”\n\nThe man smiled, a flash of green erupting from his palm. The final things Ivan noticed before he drifted into unconsciousness was that the man had pointed teeth and cloven feet.\n\n--\n\nWhen Ivan opened his eyes, he noticed he was no longer felt any pain. To the left of him lay a fine silver dagger, and to the right of him lay a fine velvet purse. He tied the purse around his waist and set out into the woods to slay a bear.\n\nAfter slaying the bear, which turned out to be a much easier task than expected, he donned the pelt. He wrapped the skin around himself, tying it in place with strips of his ruined shirt. He then decided to begin walking.\n\n--\n\nThe first year passed without any trouble. He was able to buy beautiful accommodations at the towns he stayed in and was also able to purchase lavish food and sometimes even scandalous company. He even paid priests and beggars alike to pray for him, since he could not do it for himself.\n\nThe second year found his life much harder. He would no longer venture into towns during the day, instead opting to go in only at night. His once handsome face was now caked with dirt and grime so thick, it looked as if he had no true skin. His hair had grown long and ratty and he had grown a beard. His finger nails now resembled claws and his bear pelt now looked like it was actually a part of him versus a garment.\n\nThe third year was harder still. He no longer went into town unless absolutely necessary. When he did venture into town, he had to pay outrageous prices for lodging and was forced to stay out of site. He contemplated killing himself many times but would then remember the deal he had made with the man in the woods.\n\nDuring Ivan’s fourth year of virtual imprisonment, he stumbled into a small town, late in the evening, drunk out of his mind. He paid the innkeeper handsomely for a room, under the conditions that he stay out of site and leave before first light. Ivan, too sloshed to do anything but agree, nodded.\n\nHe began to stumble up the stairs when he heard crying from a small table in the corner of the inn. Curious, he walked over. He found a man, sitting hunched over the table, nursing a bottle of vodka. At least this sobbing man had good taste.\n\nIvan sat down with a thud next to the man who still had yet to notice the bear-man was there. “Are you alright?” Ivan asked, trying his best to smile though the beard and dirt that caked his face.\n\nThe man looked over and jumped slightly. “What… what are you?” he asked, inching away from Ivan slowly.\n\n“I am a man who just wants to be helping you!” Ivan chirped, all of his common sense banished from the sheer amount of alcohol in his system.\n\n“Leave me alone you cursed man!” the man said, “I need no more misfortune in my life!”\n\nIvan just laughed, causing the man, along with the innkeeper to stare fearfully at him. “What is your name?” he asked, leaning close to the man.\n\n“Francis,” the man said, still inching away from Ivan.\n\n“And why are you so upset?” Ivan asked with a smile that could scare the devil himself.\n\n“I’ve lost all of my money. Had it taken away from me,” Francis said.\n\n“If you lost it I’m sure it can’t be that hard to fiiiiinnnnddddd…” Ivan sing-songed.\n\n“I made a bet with this group of swindlers and I lost!” Francis just about shouted, “And now I fear losing my home!”\n\n“I can help!” Ivan said, reaching into his purse and scooping out handful after handful of gold and giving it to the man.\n\nFrancis eyed Ivan, not knowing whether to trust him or not. He finally decided to take the money offered to him, but knew there had to be something he could do for the bear man in return. “Please,” he said, “come back to my estate with me. I have two beautiful daughters there and you may choose which one you wish to marry!” Francis said.\n\nIvan nodded, eager to be able to sleep in a real bed without knowing he would be kicked out early the next day. “I would be happy to!” he said with a gleeful giggle.\n\nFrancis nodded, trying his best to hide his cringe, as he continued shoveling the gold into his coat. He then made his way out of the inn, Ivan in tow.\n\n--\n\nIvan’s mouth dropped open when they reached the estate that belonged to the “broke” Francis. The mansion was on the outskirts of town, surrounded by sprawling gardens and large, stately trees. However, when Ivan looked closer, he saw some tell tale things that proved Francis was only feigning wealth. The gardens had not been weeded. The grass was untrimmed. The beautiful house had peeling paint and cracked windows. However, from far away, it still looked to be in perfect condition.\n\nThey entered the house quietly through the kitchen. Ivan was not surprised to see that there were no servants, nor was there any food out on the counters. Francis truly was broke. The pair made their way up the stairs, where Francis showed Ivan his room. He would meet Francis’s daughters in the morning.\n\nIvan went to sleep feeling giddy. He had so longed for the touch of another human being, yet it was something that was almost impossible for him to come by in his current state. He was slightly put off by the fact that he would be wed to a woman, but knew there was nothing he could do since his preference was sinful one.\n\nHe fell asleep dreaming of warm lands and a life without the outer appearance that bound him.\n\n--\n\nSo the original post was too long... so this is gonna be quite a few parts.\n\nIn the next chapter we meet Alfred!"
