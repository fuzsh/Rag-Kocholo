        "text": "What Emily McLaughlin's monograph does so well is make a compelling case: not only for reading this poet and this philosopher alongside one another, but also for reading the poet philosophically and the philosopher poetically. By this McLaughlin suggests, I think, not that one acts as an interpretative medium, tool, or analytic for the other, but that Yves Bonnefoy heeds a fundamentally ethical demand to enact an affirmative ontology through poetic action. Similarly, Jean-Luc Nancy's resonantly poetic philosophy allows us to better understand not only specific examples of poetry, but the way in which poetry allows—even insists—that we think differently, and specifically in ways that refuse or [End Page 571] resist the negativity and closure of linguistically derived representational schema through an emphasis on sense, relation, and exposure. The conclusion of the monograph begins by naming the 'ontological crisis' (p. 144) responded to by the works of the latter half of Bonnefoy's career, which are the sustained focus of McLaughlin's study. In her first chapter McLaughlin considers 'the most resolutely performative part of Dans le leurre du seuil', 'La Terre' (p. 24). She explores how Bonnefoy draws on the 'performative resources of language' (p. 23) through the use of various techniques (such as apostrophe or address), alongside images (above all the 'flamme', but also the cyclical nature of the seasons and its corollaries of birth, death, and regeneration), as well as the embodied experience of sexual intimacy, in order to affirm the 'essentially relational nature of all existence' (p. 59). Moreover, we are reminded, language is not 'other' than this relational ontology—it does not merely represent it, but rather 'participates in the dynamics of contact and exposure that are common to all material existence' (p. 23). Though we are explicitly urged to feel Nancy's presence in the first chapter on occasion, there is no doubt that readers already familiar with Nancy's work will identify the poet's and the philosopher's shared concerns more keenly early on. The second chapter, which orbits primarily around Bonnefoy's Début et fin de la neige, draws far more explicit parallels by teasing out their shared investment in touch as something that is both given and withdrawn, as well as their overlapping use of images and references (such as noli me tangere and ancient atomistic philosophy). Similarly, language is again shown to be sensuous and atmospheric, not merely significatory. If the first and second chapters are broadly concerned with the generative dynamics of touch to make the case for understanding human existence as fundamentally spacious, as opening or exposure, the third chapter moves from the (generally) haptic to the sonorous, considering the role of voice, sound, and resonance in Les Planches courbes (2001). Alongside reference to Nancy's À l'écoute (2002)—inevitably the primary intertext for this chapter—McLaughlin invites us to recognize the way in which Bonnefoy's poetic voice presents resonance 'not simply as a metaphor for the dynamics of subjectivity, but as the very dynamics that bring it into being' (p. 143). In short, as McLaughlin shows, Bonnefoy urges us to consider the role poetry might play in providing us with not only the occasion, but also the techniques, that invite us to explore new ways of perceiving ourselves and our existence in the world."
