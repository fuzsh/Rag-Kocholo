It examines the rise of financial technology and its growing impact on the wealth and asset management industry. Written by thought leaders in the global WealthTech space, this volume offers an analysis of the current tectonic shifts happening in wealth and asset management and aggregates diverse industry expertise into a single informative book.

As a primer on WealthTech it offers academics clear insight into the repercussions of profoundly changing business models. It furthermore highlights the concept of the ongoing democratization of wealth management towards a more efficient and client-centric advisory process, free of entry hurdles.\n\nThis book aggregates facts, expertise, insights and acumen from industry experts to provide answers on various questions including: Who are the key players in WealthTech? What is fueling its exponential growth? What are the key technologies behind WealthTech? How do regulators respond? What are the risks? What is the reaction of incumbent players?\n\nThis book not only seeks to answer these questions but also touches on a series of related topics:\n\n• Get up to speed on the latest industry developments\n\n• Understand the driving forces behind the rise of WealthTech\n\n• Realize the depth and breadth of WealthTech\n\n• Discover how investors react to the growth in WealthTech\n\n• Learn how regulators influence the evolution of WealthTech business models\n\n• Examine the market dynamics of the WealthTech revolution\n\n• Grasp the industry’s potential and its effects on connected sectors\n\n• Build acumen on investment and entrepreneurial opportunities\n\nA unique product for the market place\n\nDigital transformation is creating game-changing opportunities and disruptions across industries and businesses. One industry where these game-changing opportunities will have profound impacts is wealth and asset management. For generations, wealth and asset management was a privileged service provided to co-operations and wealthy individuals. The informational advantages that wealth managers held vis-a -vis their clients provided a key competitive differentiator. In the current digital transformation climate, this differentiator is vanishing and the setting is changing. A top priority on the agenda for any wealth and asset manager must therefore be how to respond and prepare for the ramifications of this fast changing business environment. This book (one of the first to be published in this area) will provide the reader with a head start in adapting to this new digital environment."
