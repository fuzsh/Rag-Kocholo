        "text": "Introduction\n\nEmpedocles of Acragas was a philosopher-poet of the first half of the 5th century BCE, one of the major Greek philosophers before Plato. For that background see the Oxford Bibliographies in Classics entry Presocratic Philosophy. Empedocles wrote in hexameter verse after Parmenides and responds to Parmenides’ challenges to the possibility of change. He is known to us mainly through fragments, that is, quotations from ancient authors. Two main titles are associated with his name, the On Nature and the Purifications. Their relation is debated; the older view is that they correspond to two separate works, but some think they are alternate titles for a single work. In philosophy, he is best known for his four-element theory (earth, air, fire, and water), taken over with modifications by Plato and Aristotle. But his system also includes two motive or psychological powers: Love, cause of elemental mixture and unification, and Strife, cause of separation. Their relative influence waxes and wanes, which produces a cyclical creation and destruction of the world, Empedocles’ cosmic cycle. In this respect, Empedocles continues the tradition of Ionian inquiry into nature. In other fragments, however, he discloses himself to be a god and offers teachings based on reincarnation lore, including a passionate denunciation of animal sacrifice and meat eating. This side of his thought relates him to Pythagoreanism. Because his work continued to be read as literature long after his theories had been surpassed, his text(s) survived throughout Antiquity and were lost only much later. Since 1999, the Strasbourg papyrus of Empedocles, from a book roll dating to the 1st century, has added a number of new passages, some of which overlap with fragments securely identified as from the On Nature. The passages are not quotations but the remains of an ancient edition, our first witness to the direct textual transmission of his work. Significantly, one of these passages includes a clear reference to reincarnation. Thus, while the debate on the number of works remains open, it now seems certain that the On Nature also contained material on reincarnation. The famous story of his death—that he leapt into the flames of Aetna to prove his divinity—was widespread in Antiquity but belongs to his reception rather than to his biography proper. For his influence in poetry and his position as a canonical Greek didactic author, see Poetry and Philosophy and Reception.\n\nTopics and Debates\n\nEmpedocles had an encyclopedic range yet managed to include the many subjects he discussed within a metaphysically economical grand theory of everything. The two first topics considered below relate to the unity of his thought, but many other aspects of his work can be studied more or less independently.\n\nNumber of Works\n\nTwo titles are associated with Empedocles’ main output, On Nature and the Purifications. The older (and still majority) view is that they correspond to two thematically separate works (see Diels 1898 and Primavesi 2007 and Primavesi 2008). A middle position has been advocated by Van der Ben 1975. Others argue that these are alternate titles for a single work. Osborne 1987 made a first case for the single work, while Inwood 2001 is the only edition based on the single work assumption (cited under Editions and Commentaries). Trépanier 2004 argues the case for the single work in light of the Strasbourg papyrus. For the general history of early ancient book titles, see Schmalzriedt 1970. The Strasbourg papyrus, section d, now includes a clear reference to reincarnation, so that the On Nature (if there were two works) must have discussed such material (see Martin and Primavesi 1999, cited under Editions and Commentaries) with further work on the text and structure of Book I by Janko 2004 and Primavesi 2008. The unity of Empedocles’ thought is now generally recognized in principle. The unity of his thought, however, need not imply that he wrote only one work.\n\nDiels, H. 1898.

Here is a key passage from Volume 1, p. 1005, where Zeller attacks the incompatibility between the transmigration of the soul and Empedocles’ elemental physics: “For if the life of the mind is but a consequence of the composition of bodily material, so that it is determined as something particular in terms of this precise composition, the soul can neither have come into existence before the construction of its body, nor can it outlast its body.” If the Strasbourg papyrus now shows the unity of Empedocles’ thought, there is no consensus on how that unity was articulated. For earlier attempts at reconciliation, see Kahn 1993, Guthrie 1965, pp. 256–265; Barnes 1982, pp. 495–501; and Kirk, et al. 1983, pp. 320–321, all cited under General Overviews. For stronger claims to unity, see Inwood 2001 (cited under Editions and Commentaries), pp. 55–68 and Osborne 1987 (cited under Number of Works), and Wright 1995, pp. 57–76, (cited under Editions and Commentaries). Babut 1976 and Long 1949 show that the question was never completely closed. Kingsley 1995 has offered a religious or mystical version of that unity, while O’Brien 2001 gives a forceful restatement of the difficulties. Primavesi 2008 enlists allegory as the key to unity, while Trépanier 2014 attempts to show that reincarnation can be found a place within Empedoclean physics and biology.

By and large, however, ancient authors were not concerned with historical precision. Careful control must be exerted over our sources, both by considering the context of individual citations and the intellectual assumptions of their authors. Empedocles’ allusive style was open to later creative reinterpretations and appropriations. Primavesi 2002 provides a full list of references to Empedocles by ancient authors. Burkert 1975 first identified the appropriation of Heraclitus and Empedocles by later Platonists, followed by the fuller analyses by Osborne 1987, Mansfeld 1992, O’Brien 1995, and O’Brien 2001 (cited under Unity of Empedocles’ Thought).

One consistent trait is that Empedocles gives his inherited epic forms new meanings. He was the Greek didactic model for Lucretius. On Empedoclean poetics in general see Bollack 1965–1969, Volume 1, pp. 277–327, cited under Editions and Commentaries, still unsurpassed as a comprehensive treatment. Wright 1998 debates the implications of verse over prose as a choice of medium. Obbink 1993 studies Empedocles’ modes of address within the tradition of early Greek poetry, didactic and beyond. Most 2007 investigates his borrowings from earlier poets, Hesiod in particular. Traglia 1952 studies Empedocles’ vocabulary closely, Gemelli Marciano 1990 studies Empedocles’ neologisms and his adaptations of his inherited poetic medium. Graham 1988 nicely illustrates the way poetic form informs the philosophical message. On Empedocles as rhetorician and practitioner of the proleptic style see Trépanier 2004, cited under Number of Works.

Later Presocratics sought to smooth the transition and ease the listener into unfamiliar material via a familiar verse format.\n\nFind this resource:\n\nPhysics and Metaphysics: The Reply to Parmenides\n\nThe reply to Parmenides forms the master narrative of many general accounts of Presocratic philosophy and is at the center of many of the works listed in General Overviews. The issue is complex. Some central questions include: How do the four elements relate to mixture? Are Love and Strife bodiless powers, or also stuffs of some kind? What is the difference between Empedocles’ concept of the elements and later element theories? One prominent approach, found in Curd 2002 and Graham 2006, argues that the plural elements inherit the stable attributes of Parmenidean being. Palmer 2009 criticizes this line and offers an alternative reading in which the elements change into one another. More widely, Mourelatos 1987 discusses how the Presocratics dealt with emergence, while Curd 2013 rejects the physicality of Love and Strife. McKirahan 2005 in turn looks at Empedocles’ use of argument and how far he attempts to “save the appearances.” Further complicating factors include the nature of the cosmic cycle itself, the philosophical reception of Empedocles (see Gemelli Marciano 1991 on ancient atomist readings of Empedocles) and, finally, the debated chronological relationship between Empedocles and Anaxagoras (see the section on Anaxagoras, Parmenides, and Empedocles in the Oxford Bibliographies entry in Classics Anaxagoras.\n\nCurd, P. 2002.

What is the nature of the cycle and its different stages? The dominant modern interpretation is the symmetrical cycle, see O’Brien 1969 followed by Trépanier 2003 on the papyrus. According to this interpretation, there is a regular cosmic pendulum swing between two extreme states: the Sphairos-god, when Love harmoniously fuses all of the four elements into “one,” and the reign of Strife, when the elements are separated and no mixtures or compounds survive. In between, we have two worlds like ours. In the first, Love builds the world up from separated elements, culminating in the Sphairos; in the other, Strife pulls them apart until there are no more compounds. According to Aristotle, we now live in the world (but not the reign) of Strife (De Gen. et Corr. 334a6). The main problem with this picture is the apparent redundancy of a double cosmogony and zoogony, and to a lesser extent the positive or constructive role it entails for Strife. For these criticisms, see Bollack 1965–1969, cited under Editions and Commentaries and, post-papyrus, Cerri 2004 and Sedley 2007. Now new evidence has come into play. First was the Strasbourg papyrus in 1999 and then in 2001 M. Rashed published new Byzantine scholia to Aristotle’s De Generatione et corruptione that offer chronological specifics on the cycle. On the contribution of the papyrus to the debate, see Trépanier 2003 and Sedley 2007. On the Byzantine scholia, see Rashed 2014, which reviews earlier studies. On the relation between the symmetrical cycle and its poetic depiction, see Graham 1988 (cited under Poetry and Philosophy) and Graham 2005 for an attempt to refine the position of all six principles throughout the cycle.

Cosmic phases are defined by the interaction of Love and Strife. Empedocles may have stressed Love over Strife for ease of exposition. Ends with a comparison to Philolaus’ metaphysics.\n\nFind this resource:\n\nScience, Similes, Biology and Sense-Perception\n\nOne of Empedocles’ central aims is to show how the four elements suffice to give an account of all things. For an idea of the range of these phenomena, see Rossetti 2004. Further, Empedocles seeks to explain how the world and its inhabitants acquired their current structures by calling upon Love and Strife as agentlike motivators of the elements, although chance also plays a part in his cosmology and biology. One striking feature of Empedocles’ poetic exposition is the adaptation of a traditional literary device, the epic simile, to the description of various natural phenomena. In the two best-preserved cases, B 84 on the eye and B 100 on the lungs, Empedocles describes the making or use of technology to account for Love’s work at crafting a similar structure in natural kinds, especially organs. This illustration of natural processes via analogies from technology appears to have been his standard mode. Other examples include painting (B 23), cheese making (B 33), baking or firing (B 73). On similes, see Garani 2007, cited under Poetry and Philosophy. Yet much remains unclear. Do the elements have a micro-structure? And if yes, could that determine or explain the different phenomenal properties of various mixtures? For discussion, see the papers in the section Physics and Metaphysics: The Reply to Parmenides. On a larger scale, the craftsmanship of Love seems to imply the notion of design, thus suggesting a nascent teleological outlook. However, it is not obvious how far this extends. At a minimum, the similes display interest in the internal structure of the body and the functioning of its organs. Lastly, although earlier scholarship sometimes describes B 100 (on the lungs, compared to a clepsydra) as an experiment, that notion is no longer generally credited. On Empedocles and early Greek biology, embryology especially, see Gemelli Marciano 2005 and Jouanna 2012. On the assembly of the limbs, see Sedley 2016.

The concept is also useful in attempting to make better sense of the Sphairos-god as a self-sufficient superorganism.\n\nFind this resource:\n\nReligion: Pythagoreanism, Orphism, and Mystery cult\n\nWhile his message is couched in a traditional poetic format, Empedocles proposes nothing less than a complete overhaul of traditional Greek religion: the elements inherit the traditional names of the Olympian gods, exceptional men can become (long-lived) gods and, on the level of cult practice, blood sacrifice is to be considered an abomination. Empedocles’ commitment to vegetarianism and reincarnation has usually been understood as influenced by Pythagoreanism, but other possible influences include Orphism or local mystery cults. Aristotle and later authors connect Empedocles to Pythagoreanism but also discuss him on his own terms since, unlike Pythagoras (who wrote nothing), they could read his work, and he was also clearly fashioning his own synthesis. For this background, see Oxford Bibliographies articles in Classics Orpheus and Orphism and Presocratic Philosophy (see section “Pythagoras of Samos and Pythagoreanism”). The fullest attempt to align Empedocles exclusively with Pythagoreanism (over Orphism) was made by Zuntz 1970 while Kingsley 1995 relates Empedocles to magical practices he terms “Pythagorean” (cited under Unity of Empedocles’ Thought). It has often been thought that Empedocles’ description of an anonymous hero who could perform feats of recollection describes Pythagoras, but for a recent case against it, see Macris and Scarsouli 2012–2013. New evidence (in the form of more Gold lamellae) has also changed our understanding of Orphism. The fullest case for Orphic influence over Empedocles is Riedweg 1995. On the relation of transmigration to Empedoclean physics (or lack thereof), see Osborne 2005 and Gregory 2014, while an even more detailed account of life and reincarnation is Therme 2010.

He was read, discussed, and alluded to by philosophers and poets until the medieval period, see Primavesi 2002, cited under Source Criticism. Even so, this section is selective. For later Platonist and Neoplatonist sources, see Source Criticism. Despite some overlap, the material can be divided between biographical content and Empedocles’ reception in later philosophy and literature.\n\nBiography\n\nThe sole extant account of Empedocles’ life is from Diogenes Laertius, Lives of the Philosophers 8.51–77. Diogenes, who probably lived in the first half of the 3rd century, is dependent on a medley of earlier sources and compilations. The earliest go back, on the more historical side, to Aristotle and Timaeus of Tauromenion, the historian of the Greek West, but Empedocles is also featured in fictional literary dialogues as early as Heraclides Ponticus, Aristotle’s contemporary in the Academy. Bidez 1973 is still the most comprehensive treatment but completely dated now; Goulet-Cazé 1999 and Goulet 2000 should be consulted first. For Heraclides, Gottschalk 1981 tries to reconstruct what can be known of his best-known dialogue, in which Empedocles featured. Empedocles’ self-disclosure as a god makes it harder than usual to distinguish inferences from the work (i.e., the usual mode of ancient biography) from literary elaboration. See Chitwood 2004 for such inferences. Of the more reliable reports, Aristotle tells us (fr. 71 Rose) that he was from an aristocratic family, his grandfather having won the chariot-race at the Olympics of 496 BCE. Timaeus in turn asserts that he was a democrat, adding that the fact is surprising given his arrogant posture in his work(s), referring to Empedocles’ claim to divinity in fragment B 112.4 (Timaeus FGrHist 566 F2). Mele 2007 and Horky 2013 investigate this background as it relates to the political activity of the Pythagoreans, while Rundin 1998 tries to assess the subversive impact of vegetarianism. The most fabulous tales concern his death, collected in a group by Diogenes at sections 8.66–74. Various versions are given, but the one that won out as canonical was the tale of his leap into the flaming cauldron of Aetna, to prove his divinity.\n\nBidez, J. 1973. La Biographie d’ Empédocle.

Finally, the Lamprias catalogue of Plutarch’s works records a ten-volume commentary on Empedocles, of which we have one fragment. The reception of Empedocles in Hellenistic poetry and later Greek literature is harder to assess. Glimpses can be had in passages of Apollonius of Rhodes and Oppian but no systematic treatment has been attempted. For a sampling of the ancient reception, see Bollack 2003 and Primavesi 2002, cited under Source Criticism. Plato’s reception of Empedocles is the object of O’Brien 1997 and O’Brien 2006.

The opposition of war and love/peace was central to all three elegiac authors, who use the Empedoclean motif to reflect on the creative and destructive forces in life.\n\nFind this resource:\n\nSedley, D. 1998.

Epicurus is the founder of his philosophy; Empedocles is the father of his genre.” (p. 34). In this study of Lucretius’ adaptation of his Epicurean sources, chapter 1, “The Empedoclean Opening” (pp. 1–34), and the final pages are devoted to Empedocles and his impact on the literary format of the De rerum natura.\n\nFind this resource:\n\nSedley, D. 2003.

This reinforces an earlier observation of the author, that multiple compound adjectives in a Lucretian passage constitute a “fingerprint test” of Empedoclean imitation. Applying this to 5.864–7 on zoogony, S. argues that it supports the notion of an Epicurean doctrinal debt to Empedocles.\n\nFind this resource:\n\nMedieval to Modern\n\nDirect access to Empedocles is hard to trace after Simplicius’ quotations of him in his Commentaries on Aristotle. At a minimum, the study of Aristotle as practiced in later Antiquity kept Empedocles’ name alive, including into the Arab world, see Primavesi 2013, pp. 675–685, cited under General Overviews. According to Byzantine correspondence of the 12th century, a copy of the Greek text resurfaced in that century, and copies were made which perhaps survived even later, see the texts in Primavesi 2002, cited under Source Criticism. After the Renaissance, the Empedocles from Diogenes Laertius and especially the leap into Aetna, reappears and serves as the inspiration for various mentions and attempted dramatizations in Milton, Hölderlin, Matthew Arnold, and even Nietzsche (see Kranz 1949, Kenny 2005, and Most 2005). The 1987 film Der Tod des Empedokles is based on Hölderlin.\n\nKenny, A. 2005. Life after Etna: The legend of Empedocles in literary tradition.

Arnold’s Empedocles is an “Aetna leaper” but otherwise fairly Lucretian and mostly Arnold. Arnold considered the work a failure and did not publish it under his own name with his other poetry in 1853.\n\nFind this resource:\n\nKranz, W. 1949.

In his earlier lecture notes on the Presocratics, Nietzsche finds in Empedocles a flattering picture of himself. But the most interesting connection comes from the notes for a planned opera or tragedy, probably inspired by Hölderlin. The first version was in three acts (for an opera, perhaps), the second in five, more likely for a stage drama.\n\nFind this resource:"
