        "text": "Kant proposes a moral system built on a categorical imperative instead of virtue.\n\nMarcus Aurelius was known as the last of the five good Roman emperors. Meditations is his private journal where he reflected on life, virtue, and ruling from a stoic perspective.\n\nAristotle’s Ethics lays out Aristotle’s virtue theory and his understanding of virtue, happiness, and the good life.\n\nIn this engaging biography of Cicero, Everitt brings to life the cutthroat politics, the upheaval of the dying Roman Republic, and the courageous political career of Cicero.\n\nThis historical document tells the story of Rome - its founding, its kings, and the establishment of the Republic."
