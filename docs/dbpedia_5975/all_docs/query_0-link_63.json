        "text": "IV\n\nThe new age of great empires beginning at the turn from the fourth to the third century opens with a setback to progressivism. At least in philosophical circles, no brief was held for the idea of progress during the first half of the Hellenistic period before the conquest of Greece by Rome.1 Cynicism and its primitivistic mode of thought gained in influence, and skepticism increased and found its first systematic expression in the doctrine of Pyrrho. An atmosphere hostile to confidence in man’s power to understand and shape his environment pervaded the teaching of Plato’s followers, the members of the so-called Middle Academy.2 Even when the significance of the progress made by the human race in the past was acknowledged, less value was attached to it in the final estimate of man’s position in the present.\n\nThe Peripatetics, for example, evinced a feeling of disillusion and a sentimental longing for an irretrievable past. To be sure, in analyzing the history of astronomy, mathematics, music, medicine, and philosophy, they gave due attention to “who invented what” and emphasized the continual improvement discernible in the course of scientific research; but Dicaearchus or Theophrastus, in whose work the historical studies of the Peripatos culminated, when dealing with the beginnings of mankind or the results achieved both speak in a rather pessimistic tone.3\n\nPrimeval man, says Dicaearchus, “akin to the gods,” a “golden race in comparison with the men of the present,” were best by nature and lived the best life. They were, in fact, that “golden race” in the age of Cronus of which the poets sing; at least, he adds cautiously: “if it is to be taken as having really existed and not as an idle tale, by eliminating the exaggerated mythical parts of the story one must give the whole a natural meaning by means of reason.” (Porphyry, De Abstinentia., IV, 1, 2 = Fr. 49 [Wehrli].) At that time, presumably, none of the arts was yet invented; but men lived an easy life “of leisure, of freedom from care about the satisfaction of their needs, of health and peace and friendship.” No wonder, if this be true, that the Golden Age “came to be longed for by men of later times who because of the manifoldness of their demands had become subject to many evils,” that is to say by men who had become civilized.4 Such a picture of the initial stages of human existence is utterly at variance with the tenets of Aristotle’s philosophy, and its unreserved embellishment of primitive men is also quite un-Platonic. Here for the first time, in fact, the dream of a Golden Age in the past is made part of an historical account, and that too by a philosopher and historian who with a keen eye for facts and unusual discernment about prehistoric problems traced out “the life of Hellas.”5\n\nDicaearchus’ position was probably determined by the fact that he had given the ideal of practical life precedence over that of contemplation. Life and true philosophy, he held, consist of deeds and not of words; and he seems to have called “the ancients” to witness against the moderns or at least against his fellow philosophers in the Peripatos, where dedication to the furtherance of knowledge reigned supreme.6 In the last analysis, he apparently meant, all the efforts made had not improved the human lot, and what really counts for men, a good and virtuous life, had become more and more difficult to achieve ever since the beginning of the world. Strangely enough, Theophrastus, a staunch defender of the theoretical life, was also inclined to regard primitive times in a eulogistic manner and betrayed some doubt at least about the moral improvement of mankind during the course of history. He did not deny that life under primitive conditions had been “full of sufferings”; but he nevertheless thought aboriginal men superior to posterity in goodness of heart and purity of habits. They had been truly pious, he believed, and their sacrifices had been simple, bloodless, and therefore more in conformity with the spirit of the divine than the religious customs of later ages. (Porphyry, De Abstinentia, II, 21 5 ff.)7\n\nThe founders of the two new schools, which were to play the dominant rôle in Hellenistic thought, though not detractors of progress, were also in favor of the practical life. Epicurus in his analysis of the development of civilization certainly followed the earlier progressivist view and even refashioned it boldly with additions of his own.8 He believed that Nature, the “stepmother” of man, had lavished her care on animals, while she had created the human being weak and unprepared for the hardships of life. (Lactantius, De Opificio Dei, 2, 10 = Fr. 372 [Usener].) Human nature “was taught and constrained to do many things of every kind merely by circumstance; and later on, reasoning elaborated what had been suggested by nature and made further inventions, in some matters quickly and in others slowly, at some epochs and time (making great advances) and lesser again at others.” (Epistula I, 75.)9 Epicurus, then, seems not to have believed in the steady advance of evolution. He stressed the chance occurrences that determined the course of events, alternately halting and speeding up the forward movement. He thought that nature guides man in a haphazard way and that action and reaction and individual and racial responses to the challenge presented account for what has been achieved.10 Physical factors, perceptions, and feelings peculiar to “men’s natures according to their different nationalities” were supposed to explain the origin of language (Epistula I, 75 ff.); and similarly knowledge was supposed to depend upon physical and ethnic qualities, as Taine was to contend much later. “Not every bodily constitution or every nationality would permit a man to become wise” (Diogenes Laertius, X, 117); the Greeks alone, for example, were able to philosophize. (Clement of Alexandria, Strom. I, 15 = Fr. 226 [Usener].) In the words of Lucretius, “it was a man of Greece” who first dared to combat the blinding power of superstition and who started mankind on the road that led to insight into the laws of the universe and thus to a true conception of man’s destiny.11\n\nWhat follows from this victory in the doctrine of Epicurus, however, is that the knowledge, once gained, is to be handed down in the same fixed and unalterable form and that further study or elaboration of science is not called for. (Fr. 227–30 [Usener].) The wise man, withdrawn from the world, is to live a life which, though not devoid of intellectual pleasure, is in its material aspects almost as simple as the existence of primitive people. (Fr. 459–82; especially 472 [Usener].)12 “Free yourselves from the prison of the liberal arts and political life” (Gnomologicum Vaticanum, 58) is the admonition of the new gospel.\n\nThe attitude of Epicurus’ principal rival, the founder of Stoicism, was not much different. In Zeno’s opinion mankind was born late in the process of divine creation, for the age of the human race, he held, must coincide with the age of the arts and crafts. Not only is man a rational being, by his very nature given to methodical investigations, but without the assistance of the arts and sciences human life would be impossible; and, if one scrutinizes the dates of the various inventions, disregarding the mythological stories adorned in the manner of tragic poetry, one sees that the arts and sciences were created rather recently. (Philo, De Incorr. Mundi, 24 = I, Fr. 106 [Arnim].)13 There had not been in the distant past a “Golden Age,” for according to Zeno man himself, born from the earth with the help of divine fire—i.e., divine providence (Censorinus, De Die Nat. IV, 10 = I, Fr. 124 [Arnim])—gradually built up an inhabitable world;14 but again the instrument of that construction is discarded after it has served its purpose. Zeno’s wise man is concerned not with the arts and sciences but with moral conduct and, though not unmindful of his social obligations, regards the things of this world as being without intrinsic value of their own, for they are at best “to be preferred.” Moral improvement, progress of the individual on the road to virtue, is his aim.15\n\nOn the whole, then, early Hellenistic philosophy expressed less enthusiasm for the ideal of progress than did its classical counterpart, but whether its attitude adequately reflected the temper of the time is quite a different question. In the poetry of the age can be found many passages that set the simple life of nature above the life lived in the large cities and at court, and even curses upon those who had made inventions.16 Aratus, not such a strict primitivist as Dicaearchus, sings the praises of a Golden Age in which men were farmers. Justice dwelt among them, and peace reigned supreme; but with the “silver race” justice was rarely to be seen, and it vanished from the earth with the “bronze race,” people still worse than their fathers. Continual moral decline was the inseparable companion of the growth and refinement of civilization. (Phaenomena 96–136.) Such at least is “the story current among men,” the poet says (100 ff.), thus bearing witness to the fact that cultural pessimism was widespread, although moral criticism and even despair do not imply that he rejected civilization himself or advocated withdrawal from it, for it must be remembered that his poem was meant to popularize the astronomical observations of Eudoxus and to teach how to watch the rising of the stars and the occurrence of weather signs important for navigation. (730, 765 ff.)17\n\nNevertheless, the historiography and the rational criticism of mythology elaborated at this time express definite approval of the world as it is. Philochorus in his history of Athens sets forth Athens’ merits in the development of civilization, eliminating what seem to him to be irrational stories. Hecataeus, presenting the history of Egypt, which in his opinion was the cradle of civilization, reads into it an account, largely drawn from Democritus, of the origin of man and of the most ancient forms of life. Experience and need, the human hand and human reason, are the teachers that led the race out of its animal-like existence and established communal life. (Diodorus, I, 8.)18 As to the gods, he distinguishes the celestial deities who represent the elements from those who were mortals and were deified after their death because they had benefitted their fellow men by inventing the arts. (I, 13.) The same kind of theology appears in the writings of Euhemerus and others. It interprets the history of religion largely as the history of civilization, which evolves gradually because of the “service to mankind” rendered by great individuals. Such Euhemerism, diametrically opposed to philosophical quietism and skepticism, may justifiably be regarded as the typical form of religious belief current among the educated.19\n\nWhat is more important still, the early Hellenistic period was in fact an age of great productivity and originality. In poetry it developed new forms and a new language, it created a new prose style and a new rhetoric, and it inaugurated a corresponding change in the fine arts. What Callimachus said of his own poetry is characteristic of all the work being done. Apollo advised him to “walk on the path where the carriages do not journey, not to drive his car in the tracks of others, and to travel not the highway but a road of his own, though it be a strait one.” (Aitia, Fr. I, 25–28 [Pfeiffer].)20 The new vitality was most obvious, however, in the natural sciences and in the humanities. In pure mathematics the theory of conic sections advanced from elementary beginnings to considerable perfection, and trigonometry was successfully begun and systematized. Upon the hypothesis that the earth rotates on its axis followed the planetary theory later proposed by Tycho Brahe, then the heliocentric hypothesis, and finally that form of the geocentric model of the cosmos that continued to be accepted until the Copernican revolution. In geography the calculation of the circumference of the earth first made by Dicaearchus was reduced by Eratosthenes to an estimate that was approximately correct, and latitudes and longitudes of cities were fixed by astronomical means. Distant countries that had hitherto been known only by hearsay were explored. Pytheas sailed to Britain and Norway and to the Arctic sea, and his voyage was important for the notions about the earth elaborated by Eratosthenes and Hipparchus. Anatomy based on the dissection of the human body opened an entirely new field of study and made medicine scientific in the modern sense. Philological and historical research were put on a solid basis, and work was begun in archives and on the collection of epigraphical material. Historiography extended its range and with Polybius became universal in its scope and undertook to delineate not only types of character but also the development of character. Last but not least, technical ingenuity performed such feats as to justify the boast: “vanquished by nature, we became masters by technique.” (Aristotle, Mechanics 847 a 20.) In fact, the Hellenistic period laid the foundation of all the research that was to be done in antiquity, and its achievement proved to be the starting-point of modern science in the Renaissance. During approximately a hundred and fifty years from the death of Theophrastus to the time when Hipparchus was writing there was, as has truly been said, a growth of true science such “as the world was not to see again for very many centuries; the supremacy of this period till quite modern times is unquestionable.”21\n\nIt is not surprising, then, that in the Hellenistic age even the great accomplishment of the fourth century was regarded as having been surpassed and even rendered obsolete. About the middle of the third century Eratosthenes in an epigram announcing his new method of finding the proportional between two given lines defied those who had preceded him in such investigations during the fourth century: “Do not seek the cumbersome procedure of Archytas’ cylinders or to make the three Menaechmian sections of the cone; seek not the type of curved lines described by god-fearing Eudoxus, for with these plates of mine you could readily construct ten thousand means beginning with a small base.” (Eutocius, Commentary on Archimedes’ Sphere and Cylinder, p. 96, 16–21 [Heiberg].)22 Early in the second century, when Philo of Byzantium described the success “recently achieved by the Alexandrian engineers” in the construction of artillery (Belopoeica [Mechanics IV], 3, 5 [Diels–Schramm]), he did not fail to add: “The ancients, directing their attention solely to the shape and arrangements [of the parts], had scarcely any success in securing an effective discharge of the missile because of their failure to employ the proper ratios; but their successors by making some parts smaller and other parts larger produced engines that were correctly proportioned and effective.” (Ibid., 30.) Polybius too, believing that “at the present day the progress of the arts and sciences had been so great that the love of learning had been provided as it were with a method for dealing with any contingency that may arise” (IX, 2, 5), decided to write his book because, written in a scientific way as was now possible, history could be more useful than ever.23\n\nConfident as these men were of their contributions and their success, they nevertheless had the firm belief that more could and should be done in the future. Thus Archimedes writes, “I am myself in the position of having first made the discovery of the theorem now to be published [by the method indicated before], and I deem it necessary to expound the method partly because I have already spoken of it [in another book] and I do not want to have been thought to have uttered vain words, but equally because I am persuaded that it will be of no little service to mathematicians, for I apprehend that some either of my contemporaries or of my successors will by means of the method, when once established, be able to discover other theorems in addition, which have not yet occurred to me.” (Method, Introduction, p. 430 [Heiberg].) Archimedes felt sure that his discoveries were only the beginning of further inquiry, and he published his results with a view to the cooperation of his successors as well as of his contemporaries.24\n\nPolybius, the historian, in the second century took the same attitude to the future in a more general way. What interested him in the sciences and their progress was not primarily how much had been accomplished already but how much remained to be done in the future if and when there would appear to be advantage in doing it. Certain military techniques were in his opinion still quite imperfect (X, 43, 1); and after explaining how they could be refined (43, chap. 47, 10) he adds: “we should not abandon anything useful owing to the difficulties that appear in the beginning, but we must call in the aid of practice through which all good things fall into the hands of man” (47, 11), for “in our time all arts and sciences have advanced so much that knowledge of most of them may be said to have reached a point where a kind of methodical approach to problems has become possible.” (47, 12.) Obviously, he wished and expected further efforts to be made; and, when elsewhere he states that certain regions are “up to now unknown and will remain so unless the curiosity of explorers should lead to some discoveries in the future” (III, 38, 2–3), it is implied that such curiosity will one day lead to such discoveries.\n\nThe work of Hipparchus, the younger contemporary of Polybius, testifies to the fact that belief in future progress determined even the way in which specific problems were approached, for, dissatisfied with the available maps of the earth and also with the data available for drawing new ones, he called for a combined research-project by means of which the necessary material could gradually be brought together. Outlining the approach to the task and laying the foundation for it, he advised the retention of the old maps without premature changes, “until we shall know something more reliable.” (Strabo, p. 69.)25 In the same spirit he prepared a list of the fixed stars observed in his own time in order that “future astronomers” might compare the stars seen by them with the stars known before, and thus perhaps decide whether the fixed stars themselves are variable, as he had been led to suspect by the rise of a constellation hitherto unknown (Pliny, II, 26, 95); and he recorded observations of the course of the planets which he trusted might later be of value for the formulation of a theory of planetary movements. (Ptolemy, Almagest, IX, 2.)26\n\nThese few statements are the only ones preserved among the scanty remnants of scientific literature, but two facts show that they indicate a general trend. First, the followers of Chrysippus, the Stoics of the second century B.C., seem to have been fond of invoking the law of scientific progress in their debate with the skeptic philosophers; and, when the latter countered the Stoic teleology with the objection that many animals and plants in this world have no usefulness whatever, the Stoics retorted that the usefulness of many of them had not yet been discovered but would surely be found “as time progressed,” just as necessity and experience had previously discovered many data unknown to earlier generations. (Lactantius, De Ira Dei, p. 13 = II, Fr. 1172 [Arnim].) In the same way apparently the Stoics met the general skeptic argument that dissension among philosophers precludes the possibility of the truth’s ever being known. What is not now agreed upon, the Stoics said, may one day come within the ken of human knowledge. In fact, this assumption that the truth will probably be discovered in the future was taken to be the mark distinguishing a Stoic from a Skeptic. (Galen, Adv. Iulianum 5 [XVIII A p. 260 K] = II, Fr. 120 [Arnim].)27\n\nNow, belief in future progress was professed by Xenophanes, who first formulated the idea of progress, and by many writers after him; but they usually asserted in a general way the probability or necessity of further advance, and their interest was concentrated on the past and present, their notions about the time to come remaining vague. Even Aristotle, when formulating the idea of scientific progress apart from all general historical considerations and though stressing the indissoluble unity of past and present, did not dwell upon the fact that future generations would carry the torch of learning still further. There is this difference in the evidence extant from the Hellenistic age. Archimedes, well aware how much one owes of one’s own discoveries, novel though they may be, to one’s predecessors (Method, p. 430 and Quadrature of the Parabola, Preface, pp. 262–64 [Heiberg]), and Hipparchus, who credited earlier investigators with “having labored as individuals for the common good” and expressed his gratitude to them on that account (Commentaria, p. 4, 21–23), were both fully conscious of doing their work for the future and keenly aware that the present is nothing but a moment in the forward movement and a preparation for better things to come.\n\nThis new feeling is epitomized in the new word used by Hellenistic authors to denote the advance of mankind. Instead of the “augmentation of knowledge” (ἐπίδοσις), the favorite term of the fourth century, the Hellenistic age preferred “cutting one’s way forward” (προκοπή), Zeno’s word for the unending striving for self-improvement (I, Fr. 234 [Arnim]) and the word which in its Latinized form (procedere, progredi, processus, progressus) became the archetype of the modern word “progress.”28 While the older metaphor emphasizes the additions made to science, an increase in magnitude produced by the efforts of past, present, and future, the new metaphor looks not to what has been achieved and its mere increase but to what lies ahead. Man, marching on from the place where he finds himself and laying out his own path, faces forward and not backward. He fixes his eye not on the distance already covered but on the ground still to be conquered. About three centuries after Xenophanes language itself thus gave expression to that aspect of the “advancement of learning” which has been prominent ever since in the minds of the “progressivists,” the notion that the advance is a continuing process, that today is followed by tomorrow as surely as it follows yesterday, that, as Leibniz said, the present is filled with the past and pregnant with the future.29\n\nThe available evidence does not reveal how these Hellenistic thinkers came to recognize the fact that the scholar labors for truth that he will never fully know, nor does it indicate whether they thought that this would always be the case. They seem to be expressing a pragmatic conviction rather than a theory, and it is unlikely that in this they were influenced by any philosophical system. Archimedes and the others were not without philosophical learning, for each of them “studied” or adhered to one or the other of the systems of the time; but they were not philosophers,30 and the differences of their backgrounds also makes a specific philosophical influence improbable. Both the resignation and the hope that they express are quite understandable as a pragmatic faith if one takes into consideration the scientific situation and the temper of the times.\n\nExpectation that the goal would soon be reached had been shaken even at the turn of the fourth century. Life is short and Art is long according to the skeptical wisdom of the opening sentence of the Hippocratic Aphorisms. Theophrastus, who was equally great and successful as a student of nature and of history, is said to have cursed nature when he was more than ninety years old because she gives animals a long life for which they have no use, while to men, to whom such long life would be of greatest value, she grants only a brief span of existence. Could men live longer, he complained, the arts and sciences might be brought to perfection and with them life itself; but, things being what they are, it would be his fate to die when he was just beginning to see the truth. (Cicero, Tuscul. Disput. III, 28, 69.)31\n\nIn the course of the third century it must have become increasingly clear that what remained to be done could be accomplished by no individual, even if he lived more than a hundred years. The very rapidity of the advance that was being made engendered humility. The work of the four or five generations to which Aristotle and Theophrastus looked back was still being corrected and supplemented by that of each successive day. The premature confidence of earlier generations that they were approaching the goal must have begun to be regarded as a warning against falling into a similar error. The closer and more direct contact with the Orient, where data had been collected for many centuries or even millennia, as Aristotle had already observed (292 a 7; cf. 270 b 14), must also have had an effect in intensifying the awareness of time and the importance of long protracted studies.32\n\nThere was, moreover, a growing awareness of the historicity of events. In literary criticism this still took a conventional form. Against the allegorizers of Homer Eratosthenes contended that the poet of old could not possibly have hidden in his fanciful stories all the knowledge that later generations had gained in the course of time, for conditions then had not yet been ripe for the insight that was available later and was merely projected back into the Homeric age (Strabo, VII, 3, 6; cf. I, 3, 3); and the school of Aristarchus took a similar position.33 In the debate as to whether the style and form of the Homeric epic could be imitated and should be, while Apollonius Rhodius and others took the affirmative, Callimachus (Fr. 74 a) and Theocritus (16, 20) maintained that Homer could not be surpassed and should not be imitated, because to be a poet in contemporary circumstances was to go another way entirely. Whether these men believed that this was true of other occupations too or only of the arts (as later centuries did exempt the arts from the general law of progress), they felt that their own age could not do everything and that the tasks men have to do are prescribed or circumscribed by the situation and the circumstances.34\n\nFinally, there was increased appreciation of the personal factor involved in the work done. Poetic theory instead of dealing exclusively or mainly with techniques began to distinguish the poem from the poet, the exigencies of the former from the gifts of the latter.35 In scientific and scholarly research the individual effort required was distinctly discerned and appreciated. Plato had spoken in a general way of man’s obligation to work like a slave for the truth (Republic V, 494 D); but Erasistratus, the great physician of the third century, said: “One who is accustomed to investigation, worming his way through and turning in all directions, is unrelenting in the search not only day and night but all his whole life long until he arrives at the solution of his problem.” (Apud Galen, Scripta Minora, II, 17 [Müller].) So, even as an individual, the scholar progresses.36\n\nAll these considerations must have led to recognition of the insignificance of any single life. A man who knows that he must labor incessantly to acquire whatever shred of knowledge it may be his lot to grasp, who knows that his work is prescribed for him by the situation in which he finds himself, and who knows that many before him have failed to reach perfection, he must be willing to admit that he is himself only a link in the chain of generations. The wonder is that despite this fact he can have the courage to go on in his search for knowledge, if it is not merely a game but the search for truth, a goal that he knows must forever recede before his advance into the future, when others will know more than he can ever know. The eighteenth century still understood this tragedy in the life of the scholar. Recalling what Hippocrates and Theophrastus had said, Kant admitted that they well express the instinctive and natural reaction of the man who is aware of being precluded from knowing all.37\n\nKant consoled himself by believing that, whereas in relation to the physical order the individual existence is everything, in relation to the intellectual realm the individual lives in the future. Such a notion would have been incomprehensible to Archimedes; but even the third century B.C. would have agreed with that other contention of the eighteenth century which is often regarded as a rationalization of the Christian message of an afterlife, the notion that in “the uses of posterity, in a better world to come,”38 the individual can find compensation for what is denied to him in the present. It is his solace that what he cannot accomplish himself others will accomplish with his help, help that they will gratefully acknowledge. To live on in the memory of future generations had always been a characteristically Greek wish. At the beginning of the Hellenistic era it was perhaps for the first time not a foolish fancy but a reasonable expectation that scholarly work would be continued and remembered.\n\nThe enterprise of science had begun as an adventure of a few, who worked in isolation or at best in a haphazard relation with one another; and, while even in the fourth century this had continued to be so, some steps, however halting, now began to be taken for the organization of science.39 Institutes for research were founded in a number of places; communication among individual workers was facilitated by cheaper and easier production of books, which were assembled in public libraries; and schools with a tradition of learning and teaching began to take shape. Despite the fact that to a large extent research still depended upon the individual’s resources and initiative, more of a common purpose in scientific matters was acknowledged. That scholars sought the collaboration of their fellows in the same field, as Archimedes or Apollonius (Preface to Book II, Treatise on Conic Sections) did in their theoretical investigations or Hipparchus did for his enterprises, is an indication of this sense of the common purpose that unites those interested in learning and the growth of which was not unconnected with the institutionalization of science.40 Conscious of being a member of the community of scholars and a contributor to an enterprise in which there were obviously many contemporary collaborators, the scholar or scientist now naturally assumed that posterity would carry on his work from the point at which he would leave it, for he could not imagine that there might no longer be scholars to take up the task. Scholarship was now a career and had a fixed place in society. The professor had gradually come to be a social type like the farmer or the soldier.41\n\nMoreover, the Hellenistic age learned to think in categories that transcended the individual life. The particularism and parochialism of the old city-states were shattered; and the subjects of the Hellenistic monarchies shared the common interests of a large society, while even the free cities sought the protection of leagues. A capitalistic system of trade linked the various parts of the world together. In Egypt, where for the first time scientific institutions were supported by the state, a planned economy was directed by the government. Thus the organization or rationalization of daily life begun in the fourth century rapidly became more extensive and more complicated. After the conquests of Alexander had unified the physical world as it had never been before, the poet Lycophron in his Alexandra spoke of future political events in the voice of a prophet with the conviction that there is a balance between past and future and that the two are mysteriously bound together, while Polybius attempted to interpret at least all the past “systematically” or “organically.” (I, 3, 41; cf. III, 32.)42\n\nIn every respect, then, the claim of the individual was merged into the claim made upon him by the greater unity of which he was only a part; and his thoughts were directed not to what was peculiarly his but to a common task. Practically it was not merely fanciful to expect the shortcomings of the present to be remedied by a future, which is as much a part of the life of men as is the past, and the natural brevity of individual life to be compensated in some degree by the life span of mankind, a mankind comprised of Greeks and barbarians, since in the words of Eratosthenes the true distinction between men lies not in race but in virtue and vice. (Strabo, I, 66.)43\n\nThis new science and its ethos may at first seem to have had little influence upon laymen or people in general. Science in the fourth century had still been the concern of a few. A change occurred in the Hellenistic era, however, when there were written for entertainment or practical purposes many didactic poems on geography, drugs, poisons, medicine, agriculture, history, chronography, and philosophy, of which Aratus’ Phaenomena and Lucretius’ On the Nature of Things are the most famous examples extant.44 Scholars now considered it their duty to keep the public informed and abreast of new discoveries. Hipparchus composed a commentary on Aratus’ poems with the express intention of driving out antiquated opinions and preventing all “lovers of learning” from being misled about heavenly phenomena by the mistaken notions of Eudoxus. The authors of universal histories felt that they were entitled to thanks “because at the cost of their own troubles they benefit common life.” (Diodorus, I, 1.)45 Even highly technical subjects were made available to the general public. So, whereas earlier authors had addressed themselves to “experts,” Hero composed a book on artillery for “all and sundry” (Belopoeica, I, 2), stressing throughout his account the common intention to make improvements (4; 8; 9) and leading up to the accomplishment of the present; and he introduced his enterprise in the following words: “The most important and necessary part of philosophy surely is that dealing with (the ideal of) calmness; this has been the subject of inquiry in the majority of philosophical treatises hitherto, and in my opinion the theoretical discussion of this problem will never come to an end. The theory of mechanics far surpasses the theory of ethics, however, for one small part of it is sufficient to teach men a love of calmness, I mean the doctrine concerning what is called ‘manufacture of missiles,’ for by means of this one is enabled in times of peace not to tremble at the thought of attack by adversaries and enemies and, if war has broken out, not to lose one’s calm, being in the possession of that wisdom and philosophy which the theory of mechanics provides by providing artillery.” (I, 1.)46\n\nBizarre and exaggerated as Hero’s statement may sound, it shows that scholars had become popularizers of science, taking over the rôle of the sophists and acting very much in the spirit of Fontenelle, in whose celebrated Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds the new astronomy is explained to a lady in the park of a country house.47 This would not have happened if the interest of laymen in the results of research had not been steadily growing. Obviously it was no longer enough to study rhetoric or philosophy, but one had to have at least a smattering of science and the humanities. Culture no longer meant simply rational wisdom as opposed to mythological fantasy, the free and unhampered enjoyment of the aesthetic experience as opposed to a life in conformity with traditional values, the rationalization of life, or a metaphysical orientation; it meant also an acquaintance with scientific facts gained through research, though the lack of such acquaintance did not yet disqualify a person for service in high positions. Polybius well illustrates the strongly anti-authoritarian and pragmatic temper of his time when, in discussing a problem of geography, he writes: “I must leave no point unelaborated and barely stated as is the habit of most writers but must rather give a description of the facts supported by proofs, in order that no doubt may be left in the reader’s mind, for this is the characteristic of the present age, in which all parts of the world are being made accessible by land or sea, that it is no longer proper to cite the testimony of poets and mythographers regarding matters of which we are ignorant, as those before us did in most cases, ‘offering,’ as Heraclitus says, ‘untrustworthy sureties for disputed facts,’ but we should aim at laying before our readers a narrative resting on its own credit.” (IV, 40, 1–3.)48\n\nIn the Hellenistic era the scientist became the expert to be consulted even by the philosopher. The mass of accumulated data had become too large and science too complicated to be mastered by an outsider;49 and both the philosopher and anyone else who aspired to a knowledge of scientific methods and particular results had to seek the advice of the scientist. It is not rash to maintain that, this being so, the belief in progress held by the scientist was accepted and cherished by many. Despite the philosophical and poetic praise of the simple life or the preoccupation with moral questions that is apparent in Stoicism as well as in Epicureanism and in the more popular literature of philosophical diatribes, a great number of intellectuals must have been imbued with the hope that the future would know more and more about this world.50\n\nIn the period after the Roman conquest a decline of intellectual life at least in Greece proper might have been expected, for the loss of independence, the devastation wrought by the wars, and the consequent deterioration of moral standards might well have broken men’s spirits and made all talk of progress sound empty; but this did not happen. Even in the motherland, work was continued. Athens remained the home of philosophical schools; and in Rhodes, the last free Greek city, a new center of research and of art developed which rivaled Alexandria. Polybius had tried to teach his contemporaries how the domination of Rome and the loss of political freedom might be borne with the aid of historical insight, “the most obvious help to the correction of life” (I, 1). He had tried to convince them that the time had come when, relieved of political cares, they could take on the duty of studying and learning (III, 59);51 and they and their successors acted as if they had heeded his words. The lovers of great deeds, who could no longer find satisfaction in military success or in political careers of international or even local importance, became lovers of learning, to use Hipparchus’ expression, amateurs in the original sense of the word, and especially teachers first of the Romans and through the Romans of the world. The movement that had begun in the fourth century had now reached its climax. A meaningful life was identified with a life for culture, and henceforward Greek history was not political but cultural history. Thus the idea of progress and progress itself were saved, and what might well have been the end proved to be a new beginning.52\n\nTo judge the value of the work that was now done is extremely difficult because of the literature of this period even less has survived than is extant from the period before it. Names of poets, littérateurs, artists, scientists, and scholars are known; but writings completely preserved are rare, and even fragments are extremely scarce. Poetic creativity and imagination seem to have been taken from the Greeks and given to the Romans, for the poets excepting the epigrammatists were probably inferior to their predecessors; but rhetoric and linguistic studies and history and the sciences still were provinces of the Greeks, and the claim of novelty was still made and still made good.\n\nEven among the poets there were followers of Callimachus who rejected Homer’s authority (Anthol. Palat. VII, 377), and a late didactic poem on philosophy seems to have inveighed against the mistakes of the ancients, Empedocles and Plato.53 Hermagoras’ rhetoric “goes its own way” (Quintilian, III, 1, 16; cf. Cicero, De invent., I, 6, 8); it was not Isocratean or Aristotelian or Stoic, as rhetorical art had been before. (III, 1, 15.) Didymus prided himself on his novel interpretation of the mythological aspect of poetry.54 In medicine Asclepiades attacked the dogma of the healing power of nature and stigmatized earlier medicine, especially that of Hippocrates, as mere “concern with death,” denying that it had brought any succor to its patients. Sextus Empiricus, arguing that in questions concerning truth no attention should be paid to age, cited Asclepiades as having said “that the old fall far short of the young in intelligence and mental acumen, although the opposite was supposed to be the fact owing to the false opinions held by most people.” (Adv. Math. VII, 323.)\n\nAsclepiades in this argument reported by Sextus did little more than expand the old maxim that it is not age or experience that teaches wisdom; but in his medical doctrine, which was based on atomism, he was revolutionary and laid the foundation for the teaching of the Methodists, the third great medical sect of antiquity, whose influence was almost as great in later ages down to the Renaissance as was that of Galenic Hippocratism.55 Didymus greatly advanced grammatical investigations in general, and the work of all later commentators draws on his; nor was it a slight achievement for Dionysius Thrax to have written the first Greek grammar. Much was being done in mathematics too, the debate about the foundation of which in reason or experience was renewed by the Epicurean Zeno.56 The greatest accomplishment, however, was that of the scientist and philosopher, Posidonius.\n\nThe work of Posidonius was Aristotelian in scope. Questions of meteorology, astronomy, geography, mathematics, history, and military science were of equal concern to him. About all these matters he pronounced his own opinion and recorded his own observations, sometimes made during years of travel that took him to the ends of the world then known. Critically evaluating older material (even Polybius, whose work he continued, did not escape strictures) he integrated the accumulated data into a system and thus gained a new insight into the subjects investigated. Explanation was his main concern in all that he studied: meteorological phenomena, the formation of clouds, the appearance of comets, the ocean surrounding the inhabited world, or the earth and its circumference, for which he gave a measurement more exact than that of his famous predecessor, Eratosthenes. In historical research physical factors that determine the course of events were taken into account as much as moral considerations and traits of character that determine man’s reactions to what happens.\n\nPosidonius did more than advance research in the various scientific fields, however. He investigated the relation of the sciences to philosophy and, following in the footsteps of Aristotle, denied their claim to independence. He clearly recognized the hypothetical character of scientific explanations and reserved to the philosopher the right to judge their value. Planetary motions, for example, had been investigated by astronomers on the assumption that the sun is at rest, but it is not their business according to Posidonius to decide whether this assumption is preferable to the assumption that the earth is at rest, for here insight of quite a different kind is needed. Thus he assigned the scattered scientific data their proper place in a total view of the world, which influenced all later writers down to the time of Galen, when largely because of the latter and of Ptolemy the scientific approach was radically altered.57\n\nIt must be remembered that in the time of Posidonius and the others mentioned the hope of obtaining new insight was challenged by some. The teaching of the empirical physicians, beginning at the end of the third century and perfected in the first half of the second, tended to stabilize medicine, for these physicians were satisfied for the most part with the knowledge transmitted by their predecessors and were content to suspend judgment in all questions of theory and of “hidden” causes. What is worth knowing, they believed, had mostly been explored. New diseases of which earlier physicians had not yet known could be mastered, they held, without new investigations by relying on analogies drawn from previous observations. Their medicine tended to be bookish, for books contain the experience of others; and like all merely empirical research of that period it acted as a barrier to scientific research rather than as an impetus to further investigation, and it was in principle antiprogressivist.58 More general criticism came from other quarters, however. Agatharchides, for example, a Peripatetic or perhaps a Pythagorean and a scholar himself who wrote a lengthy treatise on the Red Sea, was inclined to praise the primitives because among them could be found better morals than among highly cultured people in large cities. The aesthetic bias of this writer was classicistic. He condemned the new prose style and not only evinced little appreciation of progress but apparently believed that the future would bring more decay and that things were gradually getting worse.59\n\nDespite such reaction and romanticism scientific research and its fruitfulness were generally taken for granted, and the public apparently was as much interested in science as it had been before. Geminus in his Introduction to astronomy, composed early in the first century, included among “the ancients” Cleanthes, the Stoic philosopher of the third century (p. 172, 12 [Manitius]); and these “ancients” he mentions not infrequently to emphasize the mistakes that they had made (pp. 28, 26; 30, 17; 42, 13; 44, 19; 96, 5). His book, written mainly from the point of view of Hipparchus, reads as if its purpose was to initiate the educated into the current astronomy, just as Hipparchus had tried to keep them from accepting the mistakes of Eudoxus.60 The belief in progress must still have been prevalent, for the subject of progress was a main issue for all philosophers of the period, Epicureans, Skeptics, and Stoics alike.\n\nIn the Epicurean system as Lucretius presents it the ascent of the human race through the course of history is a central theme (On the Nature of Things, V, 925–1357); and yet progress is not given unqualified approbation, for primitive life despite all its shortcomings is represented as having been less troubled than life is now. Then people were not killed in warfare and did not perish in dangers which beset the traveller on “the stormy waters of the ocean” (1000) or by the sophisticated torments devised by civilization. Intellectual improvement and the organization of states have created ambition and greed (1120–23), and the advancement of life to its high plane has “stirred up from the lowest depths the great seething tide of war.” (1434 f.) On the other hand, the advantages of primitive life are said to have been outweighed by disadvantages, which only the rise of civilization has overcome; and, if despite the gains that have been made “the race of man toils fruitlessly and in vain forever,” it is “because, we may be sure, it has not learned what are the limits of possession nor at all how far true pleasure can increase.” (1430–33.) It is men’s own fault that they are unhappy and all the more their fault now that Epicurus had pointed out the true way of life. No longing for the distant past diminishes Lucretius’ admiration for the great individuals “who excelled in understanding and were strong in mind” (1107) and who by their efforts brought men to the point where they are now.61 Lucretius is on the side of progressivism too when he approves the forward strides taken recently and in his own time; and it is with a kind of jubilation that he announces: “Our whole world is in its youth and quite new is the nature of the firmament, nor long ago did it receive its first beginnings. Wherefore even now certain arts are being perfected, even now are growing; much now has been added to ships; but a while ago musicians gave birth to tuneful harmonies. This nature of things, this philosophy, is but lately discovered, and I myself was found the very first of all who could turn it into the speech of my country.” (V, 330–336.)62\n\nThe outlines of the story told by Lucretius are not new. He reproduced under the cloak of Epicurus’ doctrine the traditional picture that had been elaborated since the days of the Pre-Socratics;63 but Epicurus had dealt with the subject in passing and in general terms, and the loving care with which the poet of the first century describes in detail how man “step by step” has reached the level of civilization and the poet’s passionate sympathy with the accomplishment are hardly in keeping with the early dogma of the “life in seclusion” and are understandable only from the point of view of the Epicureanism of his time.\n\nFrom the second century B.C. onwards the Epicureans evinced a greater interest in the arts and sciences than had Epicurus himself or the first generation of his pupils. Mathematical investigation began to be cultivated, and historical research in the form of doxo graphical surveys began to be favored. In the circle around Philodemus, a contemporary of Cicero, the principles of empirical research were worked out in detail. Thus the master’s disdain for a life of learning was gradually toned down by his later followers. None of them was so eager as he had been to free himself from the prison of the liberal arts, and concessions were made even to the art of politics, the validity of which at least some of them were willing to acknowledge. All this happened, I believe, because progress was an accepted fact in their time.64\n\nPhilodemus and his pupils have left no written evidence of their opinion about the continuation of progress, and Lucretius in his poem never states explicitly that there will be progress in the future. He has been supposed to commit himself to it, however, by saying that some of the arts are even now growing and being perfected (332–34); and it has even been contended that he envisaged continuous progress and that in his opinion progress as it was in the past and is in the present “presumably will continue as long as man exists.”65 To me, the assumption that the poet is the champion of such doctrines appears to be in disagreement with his final verdict on the course of human civilization and with the whole tendency of the Epicureanism he professes.\n\nLucretius in summarizing his long account of man’s history says: “Ships and the tilling of the land, walls, laws, weapons, roads, dress (and) all things of this kind, all the prizes and luxuries of life, one and all, songs and pictures, and the quaintly wrought polished statues, practice and therewith the inventiveness of the eager mind taught them little by little, as they went forward step by step. So, little by little, time brings out each thing into view and reason raises it up into the coasts of light. For things must be brought to light one after another and in due order until they have reached their highest point.” (1448–57.) Whatever text or interpretation is adopted, the last sentence can mean only that all arts have a measure of perfection beyond which it is impossible to go;66 and so Lucretius cannot have believed in a general law of progress, in the continuous advance of the arts and sciences throughout the ages to come.\n\nMoreover, it is certain that in many fields in which especially the ancient progressivists would have expected further progress to be made Lucretius must have ruled it out, for as an Epicurean he believed that philosophy had been perfected by the founder of the school, who not only had designated the right way of life but also had revealed the truth concerning nature and had taught that any understanding of specific natural phenomena based on observation and mathematical analysis is out of the question. Even Philodemus and his associates did not abandon the opposition to astronomy and the other sciences, which follows from the epistemological principles of Epicurus.67 The method of inference worked out by this group was applicable in different degrees of certainty only to painting, music, poetry, grammar, and rhetoric, and to medicine, navigation, and mathematics. Thus the possibility of progress in research was strictly limited for Lucretius as for every Epicurean, and limited to only a few of the arts and sciences as generally understood in antiquity.68\n\nFinally, while Lucretius extols the strength of nature when praising his own time, he regards it as already exhausted when he speaks of the future in general terms. (II, 1150ff.) Here his view is pessimistic rather than optimistic: “All things waste away little by little,” he adds, “and pass to the grave foredone by age and the lapse of time.” (1173 f.) Constant change throughout time, a law of growth and decay, was one of the fundamental axioms of his cosmology as it was of that of Epicurus. One would suppose, therefore, that the arts and sciences too after having reached the height of their development must decline, and with them civilization itself.69\n\nThe evidence is not sufficient to permit an unequivocal conclusion and is in part contradictory. It can scarcely be denied that Lucretius must have expected some improvement still to be made after his time in “certain arts that are now being perfected and even now growing,” but all the indications are against his having cherished great hopes for the future. Perhaps he was himself unable to resolve the conflict between the two views of the world to which he and his teachers were equally devoted. The progressivist tendencies of the third and second centuries had forced the younger Epicureans to alter their doctrine, and Lucretius took their part against the master; but, when he or the circle whose views he echoes tried to reconcile the new idea of progress with the system of Epicurus, the inherited dogma proved to be refractory. Epicurus himself had believed in progress during the past, and this belief could be stretched to cover the concession that to a limited extent progress was still possible in the future; but full confidence in man’s ability to reach out beyond himself, to penetrate ever more deeply into the mystery of truth, to create ever new forms of human life, and to build a world of ever greater perfection was alien to Epicurus and remained alien to his followers.70\n\nUpon the Skeptics the impact of the idea of progress was so strong as to be disruptive. Carneades, the head of the school about the middle of the second century, like his predecessor Arcesilaus and probably like Pyrrho, persisted in maintaining that the dissension among philosophers left no choice but to suspend judgment on all questions, for experience seemed to prove that man is incapable of finding the truth and can at best calculate probabilities and choose what seems to be more reasonable in practice. This was still the position of the Academy at the beginning of the first century.71 It was challenged by Antiochus, a contemporary of Philodemus and his associates. Antiochus admitted that the first philosophers, dealing with problems then new and themselves being “newly born, as it were,” had probably failed to discover the truth; but “should we really assume,” he added scornfully, “that nothing has been discovered since, in the course of so many centuries, by men of great genius and their most earnest investigations?” (Cicero, Academica II, 16, 15.) Is not even the history of academic philosophy, he asked, a history of constant progress? (Ibid., 6, 16–18; cf. II, 5, 3.) Antiochus consequently felt it necessary to renounce the argument basic to Skepticism, that the dissension of philosophers proves the impossibility of discovering the truth, and to regard this divergence of opinion as a phenomenon to be understood historically. Regarded in this way, the complicated problems of philosophy cannot have been resolved by a single stroke; it takes time to solve them.72\n\nBy insisting that man must have come nearer and nearer to truth in the course of time Antiochus threatened the very foundation of Skepticism. Philo, the head of the school, and his followers tried desperately to show that the dissension among philosophers was as great as ever and that this was true of all branches of philosophical investigation. (II, 42, 129 ff.; 46, 142 ff.) Nevertheless, while they thought it still possible to maintain that certainty in these matters is not to be attained, they did not dare to deny that some progress had been made, at least in formulating problems more succinctly (24, 77; 29, 93); and they even went so far as to admit that natural studies, despite the dissension about the truth of their results, have a certain charm of their own and may lead to a theoretical insight that is at least probable. (41, 127.)\n\nThese concessions did not satisfy Antiochus. He adopted Zeno’s theory of cognition because he considered it superior to Plato’s and Aristotle’s (II, 1, 6 ff.), and, convinced of man’s ability to advance in knowledge, he worked out a system of his own. This to a great extent was taken from the doctrine of the old Academy, i.e., from the teaching of Plato and Aristotle and the first generation of Platonists and Aristotelians (Cicero, De Finibus IV), for Antiochus held that according to these philosophers “all things are small in their beginnings but increase as they gain the advantages of the stages of progress through which they pass.” (VI, 21, 58.) So mind too develops slowly; and it is the individual’s task and the task of art to “supplement those mere beginnings by searching out the further developments which were implicit in them until what we seek is fully developed” (21, 60), even as in man written large, i.e., in humanity, nature developed gradually “with the assistance of the arts,” as Xenocrates and Aristotle taught. (De Finibus IV, 6, 16; cf. 13, 34.) This theory is essentially the same as that professed by Cicero, the best known, though perhaps not the most original, of the Skeptics of the first century B.C. He assumes that in man “there is, as it were, hidden a certain divine fire of intelligence and reason” (De Rep. III, 1, 1), and he attributes the development of knowledge and of civilization to the power of human reason, thus putting an emphasis “lacking in Lucretius,” as has been rightly said, “upon the differentiation of man by a trait approximating what in the eighteenth century was to be called his ‘perfectibility.’”73\n\nIn the school of the Stoics the rigorous moralism of Zeno held sway for some time, and the followers of Chrysippus did not deviate significantly from Zeno and Cleanthes in their conception of the development of mankind;74 but in the so-called Middle Stoa the doctrine of progress became part and parcel of the Stoic teaching. Perhaps Panaetius, with whom the reform of the school began, was the first to consider the cultivation of the arts and sciences the truly humanizing force. Posidonius certainly regarded the elaboration of civilization as the main task of man; and he taught that under the leadership of philosophy, i.e., of reason, the highest and lowliest kinds of knowledge, technical skills no less than juridical rules and political institutions, had been discovered. (Seneca, Epistle, 90, 6–7.) The development was regarded as a gradual ascent, a kind of education of the human race.75\n\nCicero’s writings provide at least an impression of the tenor and the content of this doctrine. According to it, although nature has not lavished upon the human being the loving care that she has bestowed upon animals, she has provided him, her “highest offspring,” with reason, the divine spark within him; and by means of this he creates the arts and sciences and with their help and by his power and skill builds up a civilized world, “another nature, as it were, within the realm of nature.” (De natura deorum II, 60, 152.) To the inventions of the spirit, the perception of the senses, and the hands of the craftsman and artist man owes everything. He “moderates” the violence of the elements and “reigns” over all the goods of the earth. (Ibid.) His is truly an imperium in imperio, to use Spinoza’s phrase; he is, so to speak, the “caretaker of the earth,” beautifying the land and preventing it from becoming a desert. (39, 99.) By the employment of reason, societies are built up. (De officiis I, 4, 12.) Without the multitude of the arts which are gradually established man would remain a mere animal, for there would be no order or morality and no life worthy of a human being. (II, 42, 15.)76\n\nNone of the fragments surviving from the Middle Stoa expresses an opinion about the duration of progress in the future; but among later Stoics writing in the early first century after Christ and about the middle of that century and under the influence of Panaetius as well as Posidonius the law of endless advance is common property. Manilius appears to take it as a law that is self-evident. “Use is always finding the seeds of new things in old,” he says in his anti-primitivistic account of human prehistory. (Astronomica, I, 90.) Pliny the Elder, speaking of planetary motions, about which he had novel views, says in passing: “If in these matters we profess opinions different from those of earlier thinkers, we nevertheless acknowledge that they too have merit who as the first showed the way to further inquiry—only let no one lose hope that the ages will always progress in knowledge.” (Naturalis Historia II, 15, 62.) The same assertion of endless improvement in times to come is made by Seneca, who contends that every future generation will find some work to do. (Naturales Quaest. VI, 5, 31.) The agreement of these three writers, all of whom professed to be of the same school, can hardly be fortuitous but must reflect the common philosophy of the Middle Stoa.77\n\nBefore explaining how Panaetius and Posidonius came to accept the idea of endless progress and how it comports with their refashioning of Stoic teaching it will be well to put together occasional remarks of Seneca’s which reveal the doctrine as Posidonius formulated it and the examples by which he illustrated it. This will make it easier to appreciate the rôle of progressivism in Stoic thought and will also be illuminating in itself, for Seneca gives a clearer and more comprehensive picture of what the ancients meant by progress than does any other author.78\n\nSeneca takes it for granted that knowledge has not yet been perfected and is equally sure that what is still wanting will gradually be provided by those who live in later ages. “The time will come when mental acumen and prolonged study will bring to light what now is hidden … the time will come when our successors will wonder how we could have been ignorant of things so obvious.” (Naturales Quaestiones VII, 25, 4–5.) He is confident, moreover, that there will be no end to such progress. “Many things unknown to us will be understood by men of future centuries, many are reserved for ages yet to come, when our memory shall have perished. It is a petty world in which there would be no question worth asking for every generation.” (VII, 30, 5.) What is done by the past and the present must inevitably fall short of the goal and must forever be supplanted by the work of the future; and, as if he were replying across the gulf of time to the disillusionment that oppressed Theophrastus when he recognized that he could not live long enough to attain the truth, Seneca calmly asserts: “A single lifetime, though it were wholly devoted to the heavens, is not enough for the investigation of problems of such complexity … it must therefore require long successive ages to unfold all.” (VII, 25, 4.)79\n\nThese statements of Seneca’s concern the study of natural phenomena, but he is careful to observe that the law is valid not only for natural science but for everything. “Nothing is completed at its very beginning. This is true not only of the matter with which we are dealing, the greatest and most involved of all (i.e., natural philosophy), where, even though much may be accomplished, every succeeding generation will still find something to do” (VI, 5, 3); and in particular he shows how for philosophical studies past, present, and future are interconnected.80\n\nFrom the tradition inherited the philosopher chooses what seems right to him. Not bound by the dogma of one particular school or of one particular person, he judges for himself, and what his predecessors have left to him is not a “result” but a “problem.” (Epistula, 45, 4; cf. De Vita Beata, 3, 2.)81 Only those who “have never come of age” follow the ancients not only where nobody would differ with them, in matters for which they have provided the solution, but even where there are questions still unanswered. How would it be possible to discover more if one were content with what had already been found? He who simply treads in the footsteps of another cannot make any discoveries, for he does not even pose any questions. The right attitude is rather to “make use of the old road,” to continue along it, but, if one sights another more appropriate and more convenient, to make it passable and to extend it. The ancients are “not our masters but only our leaders and guides. The truth is open to all; it has not yet been usurped. Much of it will be left even to the future.” (Epistula, 33, 10–11.)82\n\nProgress in understanding, then, depends on reasoned freedom from authority as well as on reasoned acceptance of it. Only so does knowledge become the common possession of mankind, a treasure to which the succeeding generations make their contributions, changing and rechanging it ever anew, sharing in it and enriching it. “I marvel at wisdom,” Seneca exclaims, “as I marvel at the world itself which, no matter how often I contemplate it, seems always new. I revere the discoveries of wisdom and its discoverers. It pleases me to approach the subject as a legacy left to me by many men. For me they have gathered up, for me they have labored. May an even greater legacy be left by myself to posterity. Much remains to do; much will remain; and no one born after thousands of centuries will be deprived of the chance of adding something in addition.” (Epistula, 64, 7–8.) This is what was to be said by Dante in his De monarchia, in “a sentence that implied more perhaps than he would willingly have conceded, that implied in fact all that the eighteenth century had to say on the subject. ‘All men on whom the Higher Nature has stamped the love of truth should especially concern themselves in laboring for posterity, in order that future generations may be enriched by their efforts, as they themselves were made rich by the efforts of generations past.’”83\n\nEnvisaging the progress of knowledge in all future generations, Seneca remains undaunted by the evils which in his opinion do accompany the ascent of civilization. The inventions of ships spread war to all the far corners of the world. (V, 18, 6.) Luxury increases and moral decay appears to be inevitable. Man, born at the beginning of the world “under better auspices,” as it were, and “without knowledge of crimes,” will eventually become “like the beasts.” (III, 30, 7 f.; cf. 28, 7.) Yet, this is so because man misuses the “gifts of nature”; and “nothing can be found, useful as it may be, that human fault does not turn into its opposite” (V, 18, 1; 5 f.; cf. 13, 24), Seneca asserts in the spirit of Aristotle. The value of progress is not diminished by human shortcomings, however, any more than is that of all the other goods that god has given the human race.84 Seneca remains equally undisturbed by the prospect of the annihilation of the world and all the progress it has seen. This end, he believes, has been prepared from the beginning (Naturales Quaestiones, III, 30, 1) and cannot be far off (5); but with complete detachment he analyzes the events that will occur when that “fatal day” comes (27, 1) which will see “the burial of all mankind.” (Ibid.) “All that the long forbearance of fortune has produced, all that has been reared to eminence, all that is famous, and all that is beautiful, great thrones, great nations, all will descend into the one abyss and will be overthrown in one hour.” (29, 9.) Not after a period of decay but in its full flowering the world will be destroyed, and there will arise another destined to witness the same greatness and the same doom.85\n\nWhat, then, can be the meaning of progress beset by human evil in a world doomed to destruction? What use can rightly be made of it? There is, first of all, the advantage it has for the individual. Participating in the search for knowledge, he is rewarded by increasing understanding, “a reward than which there is none greater.” (VI, 4, 2.) He is also elevated above himself. “How contemptible a thing is a man if he does not reach beyond his human bonds” (I, Preface, 5), if he does no more than live a moral life, purging his soul of evil passions, of ambition and greed. Virtue’s greatness is that “it prepares man for insight and makes him worthy of entering into communion with god.” (Preface, 6.) Man finds the perfection of his nature in progress because the theoretical activity of the mind is the highest human activity.86\n\nSuch striving for individual perfection is not selfishness, however, for, although it does constitute the happiness of the individual, it is at the same time service to others in that it enables one to help guide others to their true goal. Man belongs to two cities or states, the one comprising gods and mankind and the other being that into which he happens to be born. By cultivating the theoretical virtues he serves the great and truly universal city (De otio, 4, 1–2), helping posterity (6, 4) and bestowing law and order upon future generations, not upon a few men only but upon all men of all races who are alive and who will live hereafter. (Ibid.) That is why wisdom lives on forever, why it receives more and more honors, and why the wise man “alone is absolved from the law that holds humankind in bondage; all centuries pay tribute to him as if he were god.” (De brevitate vitae, 15, 4–5.)87\n\nOf this wisdom, which is the virtue of man in so far as he belongs to the “heavenly city,” the most important consequence for the “earthly city” is that man becomes aware of his true place in this world. Through knowledge and progress in the understanding of the universe he begins to comprehend the truth that in the larger scheme of things the earth is only “an infinitesimally small point.” (Naturales Quaestiones I, Preface, 11.) So he looks upon human affairs in proper perspective and understands the insignificance of political events, of war and fighting; and, when he sees “armies marching forth with floating banners … as if some grand design were toward, [he will feel] like exclaiming ‘the ants are hurrying through the plains.’” (Ibid., 9.) Consequently he begins to take an interest not “in what is foreign to [his nature] but in what is [truly] his own.” (Ibid., 12.) Instead of misusing the gifts of nature for the purpose of destruction and devastation (Naturales Quaestiones V, 18, 14; cf. 4 f.) he learns to apply himself to the construction of a world of peaceful intercourse and civilization.88 He understands that he is born to explore the earth: “We would be unskilled animals and without great experience in things if we were imprisoned within the boundaries of our native soil.” (V, 18, 14.) He becomes capable of making the world what it is destined to be, a community of people who have “the resources of each particular region in common” (ibid.) and who share in the goods of culture and of knowledge, a task still far from being completed. (VII, 25, 3.)89\n\nFor Seneca, then, the ideal of progress was an expression of the highest aspirations of man and of mankind, and in explaining it and defining its scope he argued very much in the manner of the thinkers in the eighteenth century who were preoccupied with the same ideal. If Condorcet, whose manifesto inaugurated modern progressivism, “takes advance in knowledge as the clue to the march of the human race,” if for him “the history of civilization is the history of enlightenment,” the same is true of Seneca; and with slight changes in language one could say of the latter as has been said of the former that “he insists on the indissoluble union between intellectual progress and that of liberty, virtue, and the respect for natural rights, and on the effects of science on the destruction of prejudice.… All errors in politics and ethics have sprung … from false ideas which are closely connected with errors in physics and ignorance of the laws of nature.” Nor did Seneca fall far short of envisaging “equality among all the peoples of the earth, a uniform civilization throughout the world, and the obliteration of the distinction between advanced and retrograde races.”90 It is apparent also that in his exposition of the idea of progress the “illusion of finality” had been dispelled. He saw that, as Kant was to express it, while every other animal is fully realized in the individual, which therefore represents the whole species, this is not true of the human animal. All the characteristics of the human species are represented not by any one of its members but only by the species itself: “the human race struggles upward to its destination only by progressing in a series of infinitely many generations.” (Anthropologie, II, Charakteristik, E. Der Charakter der Gattung.)91 It may now be possible to see more clearly why Posidonius did accept the notion of endless progress which together with its interpretation Seneca took over from him. In part the reason must have been the same as for the Epicureans and Skeptics, that in the first century B.C. progressivism was a living force that could not easily be resisted by anyone who saw the world as it was. It would have been still more difficult for Posidonius to resist, because like Panaetius he was a scientist and scholar himself and with him had introduced into the teachings of their school the treatment of specific natural and historical problems and the concomitant concrete knowledge, the absence of which from the Old Stoa its critics had not failed to notice. (Cicero, De finibus IV, 5–12.)92 The decisive reason, however, was that Posidonius following Panaetius in this also abandoned the supremacy of moralism that the earlier Stoics had professed. He defined the aim of life as “living in contemplation of the truth and order of all things, and fashioning oneself as far as possible in accordance therewith.” (Clement, Strom. II, 129.) He thus gave equal status to theoretical reason and to practical reason or rather made the former dominant, for it is taken to provide the leadership which, as Seneca puts it, guides the whole development of civilization.93\n\nIt must also have been easier for Posidonius to incorporate the idea of progress into his philosophy than it was for Lucretius to graft it on to Epicureanism, for Stoicism by its very nature was rather more amenable to progressivism than was its rival. From the very beginning it looked at human phenomena and moral data from the point of view of progress and emphasized creativity and development even in the realm of nature, where like a craftsman god, the active principle, is supposed to fashion everything out of matter, the passive principle. (Diogenes Laertius, VII, 134 = I, Fr. 85 [Arnim].) The actual, the Stoics held, is to be understood as the realization of the possible, while the Epicureans almost reverted to the mechanistic factualism of the Pre-Socratics.94 Whether or not Posidonius succeeded in constructing a consistent system, it is certainly true that in his doctrine the belief in progress that looks forward to posterity and to the continuation of work past and present was made into a reasoned system. It was not a metaphysics like Platonism and Aristotelianism; but philosophy in its new rôle as “pilot of life,” inventor of all law, and teacher of all virtue, was established upon the results of the arts and sciences and their progress and was made a philosophy of life.95\n\nThe doctrine of Posidonius was only the culmination of the progressivism that characterized the main philosophical systems of the second half of the Hellenistic period. That it was so widely accepted proves for one thing that even in the first century B.C. “the ancients” were not yet regarded with such respect and awe as they were to be in later centuries. They had showed the way, and their example led men on to further studies; but all subsequent knowledge was not considered to be merely derivative from what they had possessed.96 It can be said with reasonable assurance that adherence to the idea of progress gained from the conviction that a general agreement on the truth is possible, a conviction that from the beginning of the Hellenistic era had grown stronger and stronger. In regard to theoretical and practical problems people believed in “common sense,” that is to say in the capacity of the human mind to reach results that no one can contradict. Truth, therefore, was considered to be within the reach of men;97 and even those for whom the pursuit of knowledge meant endless search did not despair of knowledge itself. It had been said that the modern idea of progress by “placing truth in a vague tomorrow” has proved to be a dulling opiate to humanity; truth is what is true now and not what remains to be discovered in an undetermined future.98 The Hellenistic thinkers like Plato and Aristotle assumed that it is truth itself that unfolds in time and that one can be farther from it or nearer to it but not wholly deprived of it, wherever one is situated in the historical process, for knowledge, as Seneca puts it, is a legacy inherited from one generation and enriched and handed on to the next.\n\nEpicureanism, Skepticism, and Stoicism, the three dominant philosophical schools, all embraced progressivism in some form or other; but there were still some people who dissented. Among these dissenters were Agatharchides, who has already been mentioned, and Nigidius Figulus, a contemporary of Cicero’s, who revived Pythagoreanism and for whom abstruse arithmological and astrological speculations probably had an attraction greater than did the sound scholarship in which he engaged.99 Mystery-religions exercised a strong hold on people and may have been gaining in strength during the first century, when bitter political strife ravaged the Roman state. Yet, on the whole, trust in reason and in the possibility of mastering one’s fate by free decision of the will had not yet been questioned. The turn to irrationalism had not yet occurred.100 The temper of the time was clearly expressed by its reinterpretation of the old saying, “Know thyself,” which the Greeks always treasured as the epitome of wisdom. This had hitherto been taken to mean that man should recognize the limitations of his humanity which, whatever he may accomplish, still ensure his inferiority to the divine; but a new meaning was read into the Delphic maxim by Hellenistic rationalists. They interpreted it to mean that man is akin to god, that this kinship allows him like the divine demiurge to fashion the world, and that the performance of this task is the truly human obligation.101"
