        "text": "This volume describes the meteorology of the Stoic philosopher Posidonius from the existing fragments, and discusses his relation to earlier thinkers on this subject, as well as the methods he used to obtain information about and to find explanations of meteorological phenomena.\n\nThe book examines ancient meteorology, an aspect of ancient thought largely neglected by scholars. Hall produces a detailed account of how Posidonius and other ancient thinkers approached and attempted to explain meteorological phenomena – phenomena familiar to everyone, which could not be ignored in attempts to understand the natural world, but were difficult to explain satisfactorily and convincingly despite the efforts of important ancient thinkers. The volume explores particular classes of phenomena, including climatic events and geological processes, providing a comprehensive overview of Posidonius’ ideas on these topics. Concluding chapters allow for an assessment of Posidonius’ particular contribution to the field and his influence on later writers working on this subject."
