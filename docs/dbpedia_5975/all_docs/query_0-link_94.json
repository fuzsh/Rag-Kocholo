        "text": "What do J.K. Rowling, LL Cool J, and George Washington have in common? Stoic philosophy. For generations, Stoicism has motivated scores of people to live well.\n\nIn The Daily Stoic, Ryan Holiday and translator Stephen Hanselman share insights from the ancient Stoic philosophers on how you too can live a good life. It was a bestseller in 2016 and has since been expanded into a thriving podcast and website.\n\nAt the core of Stoicism is the belief that the cardinal virtuesâself-control, courage, justice, and wisdomâare the source of internal stability and the measure of a good life.\n\nOur guide explores three categories of Stoic practices the authors cover in The Daily Stoic, including viewing life with self-control, responding to life with justice and courage, and managing our lives with wisdom. Within each category, we look at essential principles that support these Stoic practices. Our commentary explores other perspectives on these principles and offers more insights from Stoic philosophy and modern psychology."
