        "text": "Moderation and Consistency\n\n…....... …decies centena dedisses\n\nhuic parco, paucis contento, quinque diebus\n\nnil erat in loculis.\n\n7This alignment first becomes apparent when Horace moves on to discuss the subject of friendship at 25-53. In connection with the opening section on consistency, friendship is at first related to the inconsistent way in which men regard their friends’ faults as disproportionately greater than their own. This inconsistency is also immoderate, and in highlighting this point Horace alludes to Lucretius, comparing this tendency with that of lovers who go to the other extreme, by indulging or even praising their beloved’s shortcomings : 1.3.38-40 :\n\nilluc praevertamur, amatorem quod amicae\n\nturpia decipiunt caecum vitia, aut etiam ipsa haec\n\ndelectant, veluti Balbinum polypus Hagnae.\n\nLet’s turn our attention to this point, that the unsightly defects of a girlfriend escape her lover, in his blindness, or even actually delight him, as Hagna’s wen did Balbinus.\n\nat pater ut gnati, sic nos debemus amici\n\nsi quod sit vitium non fastidire : strabonem\n\nappellat paetum pater, et pullum, male parvus\n\nsi cui filius est, ut abortivus fuit olim\n\nSisyphus… (43-47)\n\nBut, supposing a friend has some defect, we ought, just like a father with his son, not to feel disgust at it ; a father talks of a cross-eyed son as ‘having a cast’, and calls him ‘wee chick’ if he’s woefully stunted like the midget Sisyphus…\n\n10Balance is thus apparent in Horace’s view that criticism of oneself should be consistent with criticism of one’s friends : i.e. do not be over-critical of friends and under-critical of oneself. To counteract such a tendency and so restore aequabilitas Horace suggests indulgence of friends’ faults. Horace’s advocacy of balance is in this respect ironically tempered by his use of philosophical material. Horace is using an Epicurean source (Lucretius) to back up the notion of aequabilitas (most identifiable with the Stoics) through the Epicurean view of moderate detachment in order to save oneself from an excessive tendency (one based on false/empty opinion), while in turn implicitly attacking Stoic inflexibility and extremism ; though the fact that the Stoics are the target of attack only becomes explicit from 96 with reference to the Stoic paradox, that all sins are equal.\n\n11The reasoning behind Horace’s views on balance as tolerance can be seen to derive in other ways from Epicurean moderation. Between 68 and 75 he concludes that one should aim at fairness in regarding the faults of one’s friends, which is suggestive of moderation. At 68, nam vitiis nemo sine nascitur ; ‘for no one is born without faults’, seems to complement the Epicurean view expressed at 76-7, that faults cannot be eradicated :\n\ndenique, quatenus excidi penitus vitium irae\n\ncetera item nequeunt stultis haerentia…\n\nAgain, since the fault of anger, and the others likewise which have a grip on the victims of folly, can’t be completely cut out….\n\n12As Lucretius DRN 3.307-322 : 310 :\n\n15So, in taking on the Stoic theme of consistency Horace aligns this with Epicurean moderation. And, as we will see, the ironic nature of this alignment of philosophical views, as well as his handling of the theme of consistency in other respects – in connection with friendship and tolerance, and in his subsequent use of philosophical sources – enhances this anti-Stoic position.\n\nFriendship : Consistency and Irony ; Tolerance and Criticism\n\n….......................... nunc aliquis dicat mihi “quid tu ?\n\nnullane habes vitia ? “immo alia et fortasse minora.\n\nAt this point someone may say to me “What about you ? Haven’t you any faults ?’ Yes, but others, and perhaps they’re smaller.\n\n19The irony here is that, after having said this Horace actually goes on to criticise men who regard their own faults as less serious than those of the friends they criticise (25-37). Indirectly Horace is thus criticising himself : Horace himself, it seems, is being somewhat inconsistent. Also, a source of irony lies in the subject matter – criticism of intolerance of others’ faults (coupled with a disregard for one’s own faults) – since this would appear to be an odd subject for a satirist to attack : a primary function of the satirist being to be critical of others’ faults. In deftly, and ironically, showing how easy it is to fall prey to inconsistency, Horace actually exemplifies the seriousness – the truth – of the philosophical subject that runs through the poem : a good example of quamquam ridentem dicere verum/ quid vetat.\n\n20It may also be noted that Horace’s satire is not particularly severe, and perhaps this pro-tolerance argument in 1.3 further suggests this. In Sat.1.4 too Horace maintains that his criticisms are reasonable : he is not writing satire simply to get cheap laughs (34-5), and will only criticise those who deserve it (65-70) – and this is further qualified by the fact that Horace rarely criticises contemporary individuals anyway. Indeed Horace’s argument for tolerance – however touched by irony – taken together with his proclaimed stance as a satirist in 1.4 suggests that he intends his satire to be regarded not so much as aggressive, outspoken (and funny) criticism, but as something gentler – his methods of persuasion, indeed, his irony, as more subtle. But Horace still sees himself as outspoken critic to some extent, as is shown by his wish to be seen in the literary tradition of Lucilius going back to Old Greek comedy.\n\n21In any case, Horace’s stance in 1.3 in particular seems, ironically, somewhat inconsistent ; and this is very much dependent on his use of philosophical dogma : he apparently recommends Stoic aequabilitas, while subtly presenting himself as a poor practitioner of this virtue, and this is largely why he goes on to recommend tolerance of faults (which, as we will see, can be regarded as essentially anti-Stoic) : human beings are not perfect : nam vitiis nemo sine nascitur…68. Or, to put it another way, Horace’s interpretation of aequabilitas leads him towards Epicurean moderation and tolerance, rather than to Stoic extremism and inflexibility. The irony in Horace’s position as tolerant satirist, his inconsistency, and his general non-seriousness seem to act as a foil against the inflexible seriousness of the Stoic ideal of consistency, referred to explicitly from 96 to the end. So Horace’s irony in fact serves to strengthen a philosophical position.\n\n22The thrust of the argument in favour of tolerance in friendship, indirectly introduced through the theme of aequabilitas, can be regarded as Epicurean. To begin with, it could be that such tolerance would in practice not be too demanding anyway, since perhaps for Horace friendships should only be formed with people of good character, as is suggested at Sat.1.6. 69-70 :\n\n….............................. purus et insons\n\n(ut me collaudem) si et vivo carus amicis…\n\nIf (to sing my own praises) I live a life which is pure and innocent and endears me to my friends…\n\nFriendship, they declare, exists only between the wise and good, by reason of their likeness to one another… (Diog. Laert. 7.124).\n\n28Horace’s view of friendship is probably not quite the purist Epicurean kind described by O’Connor, although in the perhaps less ideal Epicurean friendship practised in 1st Century B.C. Rome, a sort of fellowship of the wise is implied in the idea of there being an agreement – foedus – as mentioned by Torquatus in Cicero, Fin. 1.66ff : the friendship is on Epicurean terms. This idea of such an agreement – for which Epicurus felt no need because within an Epicurean community the implications of such a contract would already be understood – is also in keeping with the importance of pistis (trust), emphasised by Rist. This trust would be strengthened by such an agreement, and in turn strengthen the friendship against risks. This sense of loyalty, of pistis,seems also to be at the heart of Horace’s views on the importance of tolerance in friendship in Satire 1.3, particularly in its diametric opposition to Stoic perfectionism and intolerance. It is certainly in keeping with Horace’s readiness to forgive minor misdemeanours (83-95), and to indulge friends’ faults on the basis that one is a friend, and that one is obliged to such loyalty, as at 33-35 :\n\n….......at est bonus, ut melior vir\n\nnon alius quisquam, at tibi amicus…\n\nBut he’s a good man – there’s none better – he’s your friend…\n\n29Indeed, in effect the only instances where one would question the nature of a friendship are when this trust, this agreement in friendship, is brought into question :\n\n….....quid faciam si furtum fecerit, aut si\n\nprodiderit commissa fide sponsumve negarii ? (94-95)\n\nWhat am I to do if he commits theft, or betrays a trust or disowns his pledge ?\n\n31However, Horace’s essentially unequivocal position of favouring tolerance, which is most compatible with Epicureanism, is also not entirely without irony. At 63-67, when referring to his friendship with Maecenas, he depicts himself as being potentially subject to criticism :\n\nsimplicior quis et est, qualem me saepe libenter\n\nobtulerim tibi, Maecenas, ut forte legentem\n\naut tacitum impellat quovis sermone molestus :\n\n‘communi sensu plane caret’ inquimus. eheu,\n\nquam temere in nosmet legem sancimus iniquam !\n\nOr someone’s rather direct, which is how I may have often blithely shown myself to you, Maecenas – so as to interrupt a person who is reading or quietly reflecting, and to pester him with some chatter or other : ‘he’s quite devoid of consideration’ we pronounce. How blindly, alas, are we sanctioning an unkind precedent against ourselves !\n\ncomminxit lectum potus mensave catillum\n\nEvandri manibus tritum deiecit ; ob hanc rem,\n\naut positum ante mea quia pullum in parte catini\n\nsustulit esuriens, minus hoc iucundus amicus\n\nsit mihi ?\n\nHe’s wet the couch while drunk, or knocked a bowl worn thin by the hands of Evander off the table : is this, or his having, in his hunger, helped himself to a chicken served up on my side of the dish, any reason why I should find him a less agreeable friend ?\n\nThe Link between Friendship and Justice\n\nsed iustitiae primum munus est, ut ne cui quis noceat nisi lacessitus iniuria.\n\nOf Justice, the first office is that no man should harm another unless he has been provoked by injustice. (tr. Atkins, Griffin 1991)\n\ntunc et amicitiem coeperunt iungere aventes\n\nfinitimi inter se nec laedere nec violari.\n\nThen also neighbours began to join friendship amongst themselves in their eagerness to neither harm nor suffer violence.\n\n42But the fact that Horace is also likely to be aware of the connection between friendship and justice in Stoic, and more particularly Panaetian (as dictated by ratio) oikeiosis here is perhaps partly indicated by the fact that he begins this passage as an explicit attack against a Stoic position, as well as by the way in which Horace himself ironically uses ratio – as if from an Epicurean perspective – to make this attack. Horace’s critical response to the Stoic tenet that all sins are equal is that common sense is the best guide to justice, at 97-98 :\n\n….. ....... sensus moresque repugnant\n\natque ipsa utilitas, iusti prope mater et aequi.\n\nInstinct and tradition are ranged against them [i.e. the Stoics], and so is expediency, which is in essence the mother of justice and fairness.\n\nnec natura potest iusto secernere iniquum\n\ndividit ut bona diversis, fugienda petendis ;\n\nnature cannot tell the unjust from the just as she marks off good things from bad, what is to be sought and what avoided.\n\n44And this also lends weight to the thrust of Horace’s anti-Stoic, anti-inflexibility argument throughout the poem. That his position on friendship is anti-Stoic (i.e. before 96) is also suggested by the way in which the Stoic view that all faults are equal is initially brought in to conflict with his view on friendship : indeed this is effectively how Horace introduces the theme of justice. At any rate it would seem that a Stoic should regard a minor misdemeanour of a friend as tantamount to a serious offence, which is in keeping with the view that only the wise can enjoy true friendship and thus would not need to concern themselves with the business of forgiving or condemning a friend’s misdemeanours anyway. Thus, given the demonstrably anti-Stoic stance of his argument, it seems likely that Horace’s progression from friendship to justice shows an ironic awareness of the connection between friendship and justice found in Panaetius, through oikeiosis and the implementation of ratio, as rendered in Off. 1.11-20.\n\n45The connection between friendship and justice through the common theme of tolerance is made explicit in the poem’s conclusion (124b-142). In fact, the link between this last section and the preceding polemic is incidentally made at 123-4a (si tibi regnum/ permittant homines ; ‘if men were to grant you regal power’). This is then picked up by an attack on the Stoic paradoxes that the wise man alone is rich, handsome and king. Then, at 137-142, Horace asserts that the Stoic wise man, because of his inflexible views on justice (and therefore friendship), and indeed his views of himself (as at 124b-133), will in fact be quite friendless, whereas Horace, in his relative Epicurean tolerance, will never be short of friends :\n\nne longum faciam : dum tu quadrante lavatum\n\nrex ibis neque te quisquam stipator ineptum\n\npraeter Crispinum sectabitur, et mihi dulces\n\nignoscent, si quid peccaro stultus, amici,\n\ninque vicem illorum patiar delicta libenter,\n\nprivatusque magis vivam te rege beatus. (137-142)\n\nTo put it briefly : while you, king that you are, go to bathe for your farthing with no escort to attend you save the absurd Crispinus, my kindly friends will pardon me if I, in my folly, commit some transgression, and I in turn will gladly put up with their offences, and in my private station I shall live a happier life than Your Royal Highness.\n\nConclusion\n\n46Horace’s ironic use of philosophical material – his interpretation of a Stoic tenet, which he apparently upholds from an Epicurean perspective in order to attack Stoic inflexibility – detracts from any sense of the poet taking himself too seriously, in antithesis to the Stoic sage ; and supports a pro-tolerance, pro-moderation Epicurean view. This Epicurean interpretation of aequabilitas is at odds with the extreme Stoic view : to the Stoics, Horace’s application of aequabilitas would be illogical, since to them aequabilitas would in fact be compatible with intolerance : there is no room for human fallibility, for inconsistent behaviour.\n\n47But Horace wants to champion aequabilitas – as consistency, balance, moderation and tolerance – and in so doing he takes an aspect of Stoic doctrine to enrich his own essentially Epicurean views of moderation, tolerance and trust. Although this position would seem illogical to a Stoic, Horace shows how this Stoic view of aequabilitas is itself extreme and absurd. Through the marriage of Stoic aequabilitas and Epicurean tolerance and pistis, Horace steers a path which is most sympathetic to the Epicureans. In his discussion of tolerance there is still a touch of irony, though this does not detract from the unequivocal, Epicurean thrust of his argument. The explicit attack against Stoicism from 96 suggests that at a re-reading of the satire, his apparent upholding of the Stoic tenet of aequabilitas at the outset ought to be taken with a pinch of salt. And this anti-Stoicism, from 96 to the end, also suggests an ironic awareness of the Panaetian link between friendship and justice through oikeiosis, as dictated by ratio : again, in his argument, Horace sides with the link between friendship and justice as indicated in Lucretian, Epicurean terms, and ratio is used by Horace to undermine the unreasonable Stoic position that all sins are equal. Horace’s anti-Stoic agenda is founded on an ironic awareness – and use – of Stoic thought, which is in turn interpreted from an Epicurean perspective. He uses the tenet of aequabilitas to lend irony to his own position, but also to define it as a distinctly personal, anti-Stoic one."
