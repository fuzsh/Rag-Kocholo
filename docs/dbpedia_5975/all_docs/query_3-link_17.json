        "text": "Measuring the earth\n\nEratosthenes heard about a famous well in the Egyptian city of Swenet (Syene in Greek, and now known as Aswan), on the Nile River. At noon one day each year — the summer solstice (between June 20 and June 22) — the Sun’s rays shone straight down into the deep pit. They illuminated only the water at the bottom, not the sides of the well as on other days, proving that the Sun was directly overhead. (Syene was located very close to what we call the Tropic of Cancer, 23.5 degrees north, the northernmost latitude at which the Sun is ever directly overhead at noon.)\n\nEratosthenes erected a pole in Alexandria, and on the summer solstice he observed that it cast a shadow, proving that the Sun was not directly overhead but slightly south. Recognizing the curvature of the Earth and knowing the distance between the two cities enabled Eratosthenes to calculate the planet’s circumference.\n\nEratosthenes could measure the angle of the Sun’s rays off the vertical by dividing the length of the leg opposite the angle (the length of the shadow) by the leg adjacent to the angle (the height of the pole). This gave him an angle of 7.12 degrees. He knew that the circumference of Earth constituted a circle of 360 degrees, so 7.12 (or 7.2, to divide 360 evenly by 50) degrees would be about one-fiftieth of the circumference. He also knew the approximate distance between Alexandria and Syene, so he could set up this equation:\n\nEratosthenes estimated the distance from Alexandria to Syene as 5,000 stadia, or about 500 miles (800 kilometers). He made this estimation from the time it took walkers, who were trained to measure distances by taking regular strides, to trek between the cities. By solving the equation, he calculated a circumference of 250,000 stadia, or 25,000 miles (40,000 kilometers).\n\nSeveral sources of error crept into Eratosthenes’s calculations and our interpretation of them. For one thing, he was using as his unit of measure the Greek unit “stadion,” or the length of an athletic stadium. But not all stadiums were built the same length. In Greece a stadion equaled roughly 185 meters (607 feet), while in Egypt the stadion was about 157.5 meters (517 feet). We don’t know which unit Eratosthenes used. If he used the Greek measure, his calculation would have been off by about 16 percent. If he used the Egyptian one, his error would have been less than 2 percent off the actual Earth’s circumference of 24,860 miles (40,008 kilometers).\n\nA century after Eratosthenes, the Greek astronomer Posidonius of Rhodes (c. 135–51 BCE) calculated the Earth’s circumference. Posidonius used the star Canopus as frame of reference: when the star is visible at the horizon in Rhodes, it is 7.5 degrees above the horizon in Alexandria. His first calculations came out almost exactly correct, but he revised the distance between Rhodes and Alexandria, which resulted in a number comparable to about 18,000 miles (about 29,000 kilometers), some 28 percent smaller than the actual circumference. Ptolemy reported the calculations of Posidonius instead of those of Eratosthenes, and it was Ptolemy’s writings that found their way to Christopher Columbus. If Ptolemy had used Eratosthenes’s larger, more accurate figure for Earth’s circumference, Columbus might never have sailed west.\n\nEratosthenes lived to be about 82 years old, when he starved himself to death because he feared the onset of blindness."
