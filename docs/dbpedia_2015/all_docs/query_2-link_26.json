        "text": "CityBeat staff awarded CCM \"Best Musical Hat Trick\" for the combined accomplishments of last spring's production of Sunday in the Park with George and last fall's productions of She Loves Me and Something Rotten! \"The University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music’s musical theater department demonstrated the irreplaceable gift of live performance with three outstanding productions in 2022,\" CityBeat's staff declared in their writeup. \"It all was better than Broadway,\" they concluded, \"and at a fraction of the ticket price.\" Learn more about CCM's \"Best Musical Hat Trick\" award. CCM's 2022-23 series of musicals concludes April 13-16 with the award-winning rock musical Spring Awakening; all performances are sold out.\n\nCCM's Media Production Division also gained a coveted spot in this year's list of Cincinnati's best sports and recreations offerings, receiving the \"Best Student Program with Actual National Exposure\" award for the division's innovative Sports Media Production curriculum. Thanks to a unique partnership between CCM and UC Athletics, students have been able to put their education into action by producing live, multi-camera sports broadcasts for ESPN+ and ESPNU. \"It’s a unique opportunity—no other school in the American Athletic Conference uses student media teams linked to a curriculum to produce live feeds for the network,\" CityBeat's staff noted. They added, \"After just a couple of years, it already has generated jobs for program alums at ESPN, with the Bengals and at other big-name sports media entities.\" Learn more about CCM's \"Best Student Program with Actual National Exposiure\" award."
