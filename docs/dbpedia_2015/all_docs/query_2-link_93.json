Cincinnati and chili go together like oyster crackers and hot sauce (another Cincinnati delicacy). That makes it no surprise that there are a ton of restaurants in the Queen City with delicious chili on the menu, whether you want a good, old-fashioned Cincinnati-style chili heaped on top of spaghetti and drowned in cheddar or more traditional, BBQ-style chili. As for our readers, keep scrolling to see the places they enjoy frequenting for this savory goodness.",
