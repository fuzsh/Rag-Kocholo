        "text": "Metallica Concert Photography Published in Cincinnati\n\nFebruary 2, 1993, was my very first concert which was Metallica in the front row at E.J. Nutter Center. I had floor seats in the front row on the stage-right side. I spent the evening rocking out to my first heavy metal (or any genre) show, and my life was forever changed. On January 30, 2019, I was able to photograph Metallica for CityBeat. It was an honor, and it was amazing! I stood there thinking about where I had been 26 years before and where I was that day. I was about to create my own Metallica concert photography.\n\n“Metallica rocked U.S. Bank Arena and 16,000 heavy metal fans on Wednesday, Jan. 30, 2019. The sub-zero temperatures didn’t keep this band of 38 years from putting on a 2+ hour-long performance that mixed songs from their newest album, Hardwired… to Self-Destruct as well as favorites like …And Justice For All and Master Of Puppets. During “Moth Info Flame,” a song from the new album, dozens of small lighted drones took to the air and performed intricate maneuvers above the stage. The show opener was Jim Breuer, an American stand-up comedian, and self-professed Metallica fan.”\n\nMy first bucket list show to photograph was Dave Matthews Band. Since August 1998 DMB has been my favorite band. Metallica was number two on my list. I was so excited to get approved for the photo pass, and it lived up to every expectation. The show was in the round and I got to be on the floor for the show. Luckily one of my concert photographer friends recommended I take a stepstool to the arena. This gave me a two-foot advantage over the crowd and allowed me clear shots at the stage. This was also the first show I have ever photographed in the round which provided challenges, especially having only three songs to shoot."
