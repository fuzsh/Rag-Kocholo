        "text": "Campbell County Public Library’s Spotlight Series is back this August, featuring three local authors discussing unique history topics. All of these spotlights will take place at the Newport Branch. From an essay on Kentucky senators and an analysis of the song \"My Old Kentucky Home\" to a Cincinnati scavenger hunt guide, these niche history talks will be presented as an appreciation of the Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky area.\n\nOn Aug. 10, Kathy and John Witt, the author and photographer duo behind the Cincinnati Scavenger, will present a fun slideshow on their book encouraging readers to explore their Greater Cincinnati backyard. The couple discusses various Cincinnati neighborhoods, how to use their guide, the woman who invented scavenger hunts in the first place, the publishing process for the book and more.\n\nOn Aug. 17, Paul L. Whalen will discuss the 66 men who have represented the Commonwealth of Kentucky since 1792. Whalen explores each of these senators through his book of essays about the representatives. He will touch on a few of these essays during his talk.\n\nFinally, on Aug. 31, Emily Bingham will explain Kentucky’s state song, \"My Old Kentucky Home.\" She will analyze the song through her book My Old Kentucky Home: The Astonishing Life and Reckoning of an Iconic Song.\n\nAdmission is free but registration is required. Each presentation will begin each Thursday at 7 p.m. For more information, visit cc-pl.org."
