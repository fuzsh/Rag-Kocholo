        "text": "​\n\nI'm a writer with five years of experience writing and editing for magazines as an intern and freelancer. I interned at Cincinnati Magazine, Cincy Magazine and Cincinnati CityBeat Magazine, and worked as the student writer at the UC College of Arts & Sciences Marketing & Communications department and features reporter at the student-run UC newspaper, The News Record. These experiences have reinforced my passions of leading, learning from peers, writing compelling stories and editing at a high-level.\n\nCurrently, I work as the associate editor for Main Street United. I'm always on the lookout for writing opportunities, and I love writing about food, culture and all things internet.\n\n​\n\nSome of my hobbies include traveling, reading and going on long walks with my brother's dog, as I have a cat and she will not walk. I've tried.\n\n​"
