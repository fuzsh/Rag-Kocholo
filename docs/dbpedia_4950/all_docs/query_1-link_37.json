        "text": "A.I. (PG-13)\n\nDirector: Steven Spielberg. With Haley Joel Osment, Frances O'Connor, Jude Law, William Hurt. (140 min.)\n\nSterritt *** The time is the distant future, and 11-year-old David is a new kind of android whose \"artificial\" intelligence is programmed with \"authentic\" emotions. But what if David's human love proves incompatible with his robotic nature? Spielberg took over this fantasy from the late Stanley Kubrick, but his own approach favors the pure fantasy styles of \"E.T.\" and \"Pinocchio,\" bringing the results closer to a high-tech joyride than a thought-provoking parable. Be warned that the violence-prone Spielberg of \"Saving Private Ryan\" and \"Schindler's List\" is also on display.\n\nStaff ** Pointless, shallow characters, stale.\n\nVS/N: 1 scene of implied sex. VV: 20 scenes, one quite violent torture scene. VP: 1 expression, mild. VD: None.\n\nThe Affair of the Necklace (R)\n\nDirector: Charles Shyer. With Hilary Swank, Jonathan Pryce, Adrien Brody, Simon Baker, Christopher Walken, Brian Cox, Joely Richardson. (120 min.)\n\nSterritt ** Check off the ingredients for an old-fashioned historical melodrama: an orphan with noble blood, a secretly sinful churchman, an imperious queen, a mystic who may or may not know the future, and a piece of spectacular jewelry that becomes the center of an explosive 18th-century scandal. This sort of material goes back to D.W. Griffith and beyond, and Swank's persona seems too modern to compete with Lillian Gish on her own turf. The movie has almost enough corny appeal to offset its lack of originality, though, and Walken is fun as Cagliostro, the court's great prognosticator and all-around weirdo.\n\nVS/N: 10 scenes, half innuendo. VV: 8 scenes. VP: 10 mostly mild expressions. VD: 12 scenes with alcohol, 1 with drugs.\n\nA Love Divided (PG)\n\nDirector: Sydney McCartney. With Nicole Bohan, Melissa Bolger, Sarah Bolger, Orla Brady. (98 min.)\n\nStaff *** A Protestant woman marries into a Catholic family in a small Irish village, and consequently agrees to raise her daughter Catholic. But when the village priest insists that their eldest daughter attend a Catholic school, the woman flees with both her little girls. The family's strife soon seeps into the town and the undercurrent of tension between the two groups comes to the surface. While the plot is nothing new, the genuine acting in this true story brings a freshness to an old problem. By Lane Hartill\n\nStaff *** Nuanced, inspiring, overwrought.\n\nVS/N: 1 implied sex scene. VV: 6 mild scenes. VP: 16 mild and harsh expressions. VD: 3 scenes with cigarettes, 7 with alcohol.\n\nAbout Adam (R)\n\nDirector: Gerard Stembridge. With Kate Hudson, Stuart Townsend, Frances O'Connor. (105 min.)\n\nStaff **1/2 Adam (Townsend) doesn't mean any harm as he woos bookworm O'Connor and bored housewife Bradley - both of them sisters of his fiancee (Hudson). In a storytelling technique dating back to at least 'Citizen Kane' and 'Rashomon,' we see each sister's version of the tale. Writer-director Stembridge's light touch and his comedy ensemble work to keep things fresh. But what this movie says about infidelity will prove more than a little dismaying to viewers. By M.K. Terrell.\n\nVS/N: 6 sex scenes, brief nudity. VV: None. VP: 48 often-harsh expressions. VD: 13 scenes of drinking, 4 scenes with smoking.\n\nAll the Pretty Horses (PG-13)\n\nDirector: Billy Bob Thornton. With Matt Damon, Henry Thomas, Penélope Cruz, Rubén Blades, Robert Patrick, Sam Shepherd, Lucas Black. (116 min.)\n\nStaff **1/2 An all-but-orphaned Texan (Damon) who hungers for horses and a land without borders, flees to Mexico with his childhood pal where he finds lessons in love, death, and revenge. Or perhaps they find him, in this morally wrought drama. At times, the themes loom like Plato's absolutes, larger than the vast expanses. Occasional surprises in the camerawork and direction barely keep the adventure from slipping into tiresome epic formula. Lucas Black shines in his role as the young and pesty tagalong. By Samar Farah\n\nVS/N: 3 scenes, no nudity. VV: 10 scenes, including torture, stabbing, fights. VP: 42 expressions, mostly mild. VD: 3 scenes with drinking, 12 scenes with smoking.\n\nAlong Came A Spider (R)\n\nDirector: Lee Tamahori. With Morgan Freeman, Monica Potter, Michael Wincott, Jay O. Sanders, Dylan Baker, Raoul Ganeev. (104 min.)\n\nStaff **1/2 Morgan Freeman is back as Washington detective Dr. Alex Cross in this well-paced thriller, which is technically the prequel to \"Kiss the Girls.\" He's on the trail of an intelligent and cunning villain - Gary Soneji (Michael Wincott) - who has kidnapped the daughter of a US senator. \"Along Came a Spider\" is filled with surprising twists, which often evoke a smile. It contains scenes of fairly graphic violence, including one car crash and several shootings. By Steven Savides\n\nStaff * Stale dialogue, ridiculous twists, Morgan Freeman is about the only redeeming aspect of this film.\n\nVS/N: 1 reference to sex. VV: 9 instances, with mostly brief gun shots. VP: 9 harsh expressions. VD: 1 cigarette.\n\nAmélie (R)\n\nDirector: Jean-Pierre Jeunet. With Audrey Tautou, Mathieu Kassovitz, Rufus, Arthus de Penguern. (121 min.)\n\nSterritt *** Amélie is a waitress who anonymously helps a stranger, observes the happiness this brings him, and becomes an eager do-gooder for people who never asked her to barge into their lives. Jeunet is never happy with a scene until he's directed it half to death with manic camera work and editing. But the lighthearted plot of this romantic French comedy balances his overeager style, and Tautou's acting is amiable enough to shine through any amount of cinematic fuss. In French with English subtitles\n\nStaff ***1/2 Unconventional, delightful, mischievous, visually stunning.\n\nVS/N: 8 scenes with implied sex, innuendo and brief nudity. VV: 4 mild scenes of comic violence. VP: None. VD: 9 scenes with alcohol, 1 scene with a cigarette.\n\nAmerican Desi (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Piyush Dinker Pandya. With Deep Katdare, Purva Bedi, Ronobir Lahiri, Anil Kumar, Kal Penn. (100 min.)\n\nSterritt ** A loosely knit group of Indian-American students pursue learning, chase romance, and come to terms with their Indian heritage in this boisterous comedy set in an American university. The subject is likable and the story has possibilities, but why does every single performance sink into a self-indulgent mess of hammy overacting?\n\nAmerican Outlaws (PG-13)\n\nDirector: Les Mayfield. With Colin Farrell, Scott Caan, Ali Larter, Timothy Dalton, Kathy Bates. (90 min.)\n\nStaff DUD This depiction of the rise of notorious outlaw Jesse James wasn't meant to be overly serious, but Colin Farrell and his dastardly gang have all the screen presence of a bunch of frat boys playing cowboys and learning how to ride horses. Comparing the film to \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\" as Warner Brothers has done, is like comparing \"Rambo\" to \"Apocalypse Now.\" Except that \"Rambo\" actually made a splash. This dud will be forgotten by fall. By Matthew MacLean\n\nAmerican Pie 2 (R)\n\nDirector: J.B. Rogers. With Jason Biggs, Shannon Elizabeth, Chris Klein, Alyson Hannigan, Mena Suvari, Natasha Lyonne, Tara Reid, Seann William Scott. (104 min.)\n\nSterritt ** It's summer vacation, the \"American Pie\" alumni are now college kids, and all they can think of is still - you guessed it - sex, sex, sex. This energetic sequel moves from one gross-out set piece to another, with occasional moments of teenpic sentimentality to cleanse the palate. It delivers all the raunch and ribaldry its designated audience could hope for, but others may find it more deliberately disgusting than effervescently outrageous.\n\nVS/N: 19 scenes of graphic innuendo or implied sex, 1 sex scene with nudity. VV: 2 scenes of comic violence. VP: 124 very harsh expressions. VD: 20 scenes with alcohol, 1 with smoking.\n\nAmerica's Sweethearts (PG-13)\n\nDirector: Joe Roth. With Julia Roberts, John Cusack, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Billy Crystal, Christopher Walken, Alan Arkin, Hank Azaria, Stanley Tucci. (109 min.)\n\nSterritt * To build enthusiasm for an expensive production, a Hollywood publicist (Crystal) asks a feuding movie-star couple (Cusack and Zeta-Jones) to fake a reconciliation, helped by an assistant (Roberts) who has her own personal stakes in the situation. This story is complicated enough to look interesting on paper, but it falls flat on screen, weighed down by far-fetched plot twists and touches of needlessly crude comedy. Not even the stellar cast can sweeten this sour-hearted satire.\n\nStaff ** Formulaic, funny (at times), half-baked.\n\nVS/N: 6 scenes of innuendo, 1 scene of implied sex. VV: 3 scenes, including a fight. VP: 31 harsh expressions. VD: 1 scene with smoking, 9 scenes with drinking, 2 scenes with pilltaking.\n\nAmores Perros (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Alejandro González Iñárritu. With Gael Garcia Bernal, Goya Toledo. (153 min.)\n\nSterritt *** Dogs and a cataclysmic car accident play key roles in this sometimes enticing, frequently savage Mexican drama, which weaves three stories into a sustained look at the complicated lives of a canine named Cofi and his human companions. González Iñárritu is a highly promising new talent, although his depictions of animal travails will put this movie way off-limits for many viewers. In Spanish with English subtitles\n\nAn Everlasting Piece (R)\n\nDirector: Barry Levinson. With Barry McEvoy, Brian O'Byrne, Anna Friel, Billy Connolly, Ruth McCabe, Pauline McLynn. (103 min.)\n\nStaff *** Two barbers (McEvoy and O'Byrne) meet while cutting hair in an asylum and hatch a plan to sell hairpieces. Before they can get the exclusive franchise for Northern Ireland, however, they must get past their religious differences, a rival outfit (Toupee or Not Toupee), the Royal Constabulary, the IRA, a wig-hungry rottweiler, and a spunky girlfriend (Friel). McEvoy's understated screenplay is full of wit and subtle surprises. By M.K Terrell\n\nVS/N: 2 scenes, including male backside nudity. VV: 6 scenes including man biting an ear. VP: 126 mostly harsh expressions. VD: 4 scenes with drinking, 9 scenes with smoking.\n\nAngel Eyes (R)\n\nDirector: Luis Mandoki. With Jennifer Lopez, Jim Caviezel, Sonia Braga, Shirley Knight. (104 min.)\n\nStaff ** When a stranger (Caviezel) saves South Chicago cop (Lopez) from a dangerous situation, she thinks she may have met the perfect man until she tries to find out about his past. This unconventional love story captivates early on, but even Lopez's surprisingly good acting can't rescue this slow-paced yarn. By Joshua S. Burek\n\nStaff ** Contrived, emotional, sweet moments.\n\nVS/N: 1 mild sex scene. 3 instances of innuendo and several sexual references. VV: 7 scenes, including a fistfight. VP: 62 often- harsh expressions. VD: 3 scenes of smoking, 3 scenes of drinking.\n\nThe Animal (PG-13)\n\nDirector: Luke Greenfield. With Rob Schneider, Colleen Haskell, Edward Asner, Cloris Leachman. (77 min.)\n\nSterritt * After a car crash, a mad doctor patches up a bumbling young man with spare parts from animals, and the patient starts reacting to human situations with beastly behavior. This comic fantasy has amusing bits of social satire, but they're crowded out of the stable by lots of bathroom and barnyard humor.\n\nStaff * Lazy humor, featherweight, bananas, base.\n\nVS/N: 7 scenes of innuendo. VV: 13 scenes of comic violence. VP: 18 expressions. VD: 4 scenes with drinking, 2 with smoking.\n\nThe Anniversary Party (R)\n\nDirectors: Alan Cumming and Jennifer Jason-Leigh. With Alan Cumming, Jennifer Jason-Leigh, Jennifer Beals, Kevin Kline, Phoebe Cates. (115 min.)\n\nStaff ** A successful young novelist (Cummings) and his actress wife (Jason-Leigh) celebrate their sixth wedding anniversary by inviting a few select guests, welcome and unwelcome, to their home. Prodded by alcohol and drug-taking, they all reveal their hidden hopes and fears. Cumming and Jason-Leigh codirect themselves and a passel of stars in effective cameo roles. Contains brutally frank and sexually explicit talk, but also some worthwhile insights into the contemporary male-female dynamic. By Gregory M. Lamb\n\nStaff ** Drags a bit, baroque, actor's picnic.\n\nVS/N: 3 scenes of innuendo, 4 scenes with female nudity, 2 nongraphic sex scenes. VV: 2 scenes. VP: 85 mostly harsh expressions. VD: 1 scene with marijuana, 8 with drinking.\n\nAntitrust (PG-13)\n\nDirector: Peter Howitt. With Tim Robbins, Ryanne Phillippe, Claire Forlani, Rachael Leigh Cook. (120 min.)\n\nStaff **1/2Robbins (the man you love to mistrust) plays a Bill Gates-type computer magnate fending off the Federal Trade Commission while creating a new system to monopolize global communications. When his newly recruited programming whiz (Phillippe) realizes his boss is more sinister than even the government suspects, he sets out to expose him. Flashy editing and visuals make this a fun ride, but can't overcome the sheer unbelievability of it all. Still, it's refreshing to see young computer geniuses portrayed as something resembling normal people. By M.K. Terrell\n\nApocalypse Now Redux (R)\n\nDirector: Francis Ford Coppola. With Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Dennis Hopper, Harrison Ford, Laurence Fishburne, Christian Marquand. (196 min.)\n\nSterritt **** Coppola has restored 53 minutes of material trimmed from the original 1979 release of \"Apocalypse Now,\" his legendary drama about the Vietnam War, and reedited the movie as a whole. The story, based on Joseph Conrad's haunting 1898 novella \"Heart of Darkness,\" hasn't changed: A young soldier (Sheen) travels up a jungle river to find and assassinate a renegade military officer (Brando) who's gone insane and established a private kingdom ruled by terror. The film is episodic and uneven, but it has moments of great emotional power and stands as a key document for anyone hoping to understand American ambivalence toward the Vietnam War and its soul-searching aftermath.\n\nThe Art of Amaliâ (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Bruno de Almeida. With Amalia Rodrigues, David Byrne. (90 min.)\n\nSterritt *** Rock star Byrne introduces this tuneful look at the life of singer Rodrigues, an internationally renowned interpreter of Portugal's impassioned \"fado\" songs, so called because of their preoccupation with melancholy turns of fate. A wide range of concert and media clips lend vigor and variety to the documentary. In English and Portuguese with English subtitles\n\nAtlantis: The Lost Empire (PG)\n\nDirectors: Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise. With the voices of Michael J. Fox, James Garner. (96 min.)\n\nStaff **1/2 \"Atlantis\" is an attempt at an action-adventure tale set in the early 1900s - part \"Indiana Jones\" and part Jules Verne. Milo Thatch is a nerdish academic invited to join a submarine mission to find the lost city of Atlantis, but unforeseen dangers lurk. Fairly entertaining, but hardly a classic Disney cartoon. By Stephen Humphries\n\nStaff **1/2 Exciting, heartening, energetic.\n\nVS/N: None. VV: 7 scenes. VP: None. VD: 6 scenes with smoking.\n\nAudition (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Miike Takashi. With Ryo Ishibashi, Eihi Shiina, Jun Kunimura, Tetsu Sawaki. (115 min.)\n\nSterritt ** A middle-age widower takes a cue from the entertainment media and \"auditions\" women who might make good romantic partners. His selection turns out to be a very strange candidate, however, whose behavior grows more ominous the more he learns about her. The most startling aspect of this slow-building horror movie is how unexpectedly it morphs from a quietly romantic suspense yarn to a flat-out tale of terror that may have some viewers hiding under their seats. Stay far away unless you're in the mood for very violent surprises. In Japanese with English subtitles\n\nBaby Boy (R)\n\nDirector: John Singleton. With Tyrese Gibson, Ving Rhames, Taraji P. Henson, Omar Gooding, Snoop Dogg. (132 min.)\n\nSterritt *** This melodrama centers on a young African-American named Jody who lives with his 36-year-old mother and her new boyfriend. The movie begins on an intellectual note, stating a psychologist's theory that years of racism have made many black men see themselves as overgrown children. This gives us a clue to Jody's way of life, and kicks off the Oedipus theme that gallops through the story. Singleton still has a keen eye for harrowing details of urban life.\n\nStaff **1/2 Insightful, compassionate, grave.\n\nVS/N: 13 quite graphic instances. VV: 11 scenes including fights and shootings. VP: 451 very harsh expressions. VD: 20 scenes with smoking, 8 scenes with drinking, 5 scenes with marijuana.\n\nBand of Outsiders (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Jean-Luc Godard. With Anna Karina, Sami Frey, Claude Brasseur. (97 min.)\n\nSterritt **** \"All you need to make a movie is a girl and a gun,\" quipped French filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard, but in this mercurial crime-tragicomedy-romance he shows that exhilarating doses of style, imagination, and sheer energy also come in handy. Made in 1964, this isn't a legendary Godard masterpiece like \"Breathless\" and \"Contempt,\" which have also been successfully reissued. It offers 10 times more pleasures than the average picture, though. Originally titled \"Bande à parte.\" In French with English subtitles\n\nBandits (PG-13)\n\nDirector: Barry Levinson. With Bruce Willis, Cate Blanchett, Billy Bob Thornton, Troy Garity. (109 min.)\n\nStaff ** Mildly amusing is probably not what veteran director Barry Levinson was going for when he teamed macho-man Bruce Willis with chatterbox-hypochondriac Billy Bob Thornton as odd-couple bank robbers in this quirky caper. The talented Cate Blanchett adds spice to the proceedings in her role as a runaway wife who falls for both men at once. But the Billy Bob hypochondriac jokes and Willis's omnipresent wry grins wear thin pretty fast, and the film runs out of gas. Newcomer Troy Garity, who plays the getaway driver and master of pyrotechnics, is a delight, but ultimately it's an offbeat comedy that's a few beats off. By John Kehe\n\nBanoo (The Lady) (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Dariush Mehrjui. With Ezatollah Entezami, Gohar Kheirandish, Bita Farrahi, Ferdos Kaviani. (113 min.)\n\nSterritt *** After learning that her husband has taken a second wife, a young Iranian woman seeks spiritual comfort by helping a series of strangers with illnesses and other challenges in their lives. This well-produced Iranian drama has a poignant story and a fascinating theme, but it doesn't scale the emotional heights or plumb the psychological depths that Mehrjui reached in his earlier \"Leilah,\" a richer and more engrossing film. In Farsi with English subtitles\n\nBaran (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Majid Majidi. With Hossein Abedini, Mohammad Reza Naji, Zahra Bahrami, Hossein Rahimi. (105 min.)\n\nSterritt **** The unglamorous setting is an Iranian construction site, and the unlikely hero is a young Iranian man who falls in love with an Afghan woman after a string of misadventures with an illegal immigrant who works alongside him. Majidi became one of Iran's most internationally famed filmmakers with \"Children of Heaven\" and \"The Color of Paradise,\" but he far surpasses those sappy melodramas with this expressively filmed story of rivalry, romance, and cultural conflict. In Farsi with English subtitles\n\nBehind Enemy Lines (PG-13)\n\nDirector: John Moore. With Gene Hackman, Owen Wilson, David Keith, Joaquim de Almeida. (105 min.)\n\nStaff ** Comedian Owen Wilson in the role of a naval navigator whose plane is shot down over Bosnia? You'd be forgiven for thinking that there was a casting-agent strike going on in Hollywood. Fortunately Wilson's likeability goes a long way toward tempering the film's Rambo-like heroics as he evades Serbs on his way to a rendevouz with a rescue team. First-time director Moore does a sterling job with stylish camerawork, but cartoonish characterization and the score's unsubtle attempts to elicit a patriotic response from the audience are a liability. By Stephen Humphries\n\nStaff **1/2 \"The Fugitive\" goes to war, gripping, melodramatic end, well-acted.\n\nVS/N: None. VV: 6 gory scenes. VP: 18 mild expressions. VD: 7 scenes with smoking.\n\nBlack Knight (PG-13)\n\nDirector: Gil Junger. With Martin Lawrence, Tom Wilkinson, Marsha Thompson, Vincent Regan. (95 min.)\n\nStaff ** Jamal (Martin Lawrence), a dispirited worker at Medieval World, a run-down amusement park, reaches for a medallion in the park's moat and hurtles back in time to 14thcentury England. There, his street smarts and a previously hidden streak of courage mobilize a ragtag bunch of rebels to depose the corrupt king. The movie is a lot better than you think it's going to be, thanks to Lawrence's energy, witty lines, and a good-natured take on old clichés. By M.K. Terrell.\n\nVS/N: 9 scenes of innuendo, 1 with implied sex. VV: 8 scenes. VP: 42 harsh expressions. VD: 2 scenes with drinking.\n\nThe Blackout (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Abel Ferrara. With Matthew Modine, Claudia Schiffer, Dennis Hopper, Béatrice Dalle. (100 min.)\n\nSterritt ** A movie star relocates from Hollywood to Miami, develops contrasting relationships with two different women named Annie, and suffers the consequences of a night so dissolute that he retains no memory of what happened. This isn't a Ferrara classic like \"King of New York,\" but even his less- memorable pictures carry an eccentric kick no other director could duplicate.\n\nBlow (R)\n\nDirector: Ted Demme. With Johnny Depp, Penelope Cruz, Ray Liotta, Paul Reubens, Rachel Griffiths, Franka Potente. (119 min.)\n\nSterritt ** The fact-based story of George Jung, a small-time California crook who became a big-time associate of Pablo Escobar's notorious Colombia drug cartel. The story is inherently stale, especially since Martin Scorsese did it better in the 1990 hit \"GoodFellas,\" but Depp evokes surprising emotional depth with a characteristically subtle performance, and Demme elicits fine acting from the strong supporting cast.\n\nStaff *** Realistic, compelling, thought-provoking.\n\nVS/N: Brief nude shots in a photo collage, topless women in a pool, and backside shots of nude women. VV: Graphic fighting scenes with guns and 1 slap to a woman. VP: 134 harsh expressions. VD: 31 scenes with alcohol and 39 with drugs.\n\nBlow Dry (R)\n\nDirected by Paddy Breathnack. With Alan Rickman, Natasha Richardson, Rachael Leigh Cook, Josh Hartnett, Rachel Griffiths. (105 min.)\n\nStaff **1/2 In the quirky style of 'Strictly Ballroom,' Simon Beaufoy, writer of 'The Full Monty,' brings us 'Blow Dry,' the outrageous yet simple story of the competitively hair-obsessed. When the National Hairdressing Competition comes to a small town in England, a hair-styling family, long ago broken by a 'mom-gone-lesbian' relationship, must decide to come together to win back the championship. It's bizarre, but the use of odd-shock humor keeps it fun as the story of the never-ending relationship process unfolds. By Christy Ellington\n\nS/N: 4 scenes of implied sex; including 1 scene with nudity. V: None. P: 22 harsh and mild expressions. D: 5 instances of alcohol; 5 scenes with smoking.\n\nThe Blue Angel (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Josef von Sternberg. With Marlene Dietrich, Emil Jannings, Kurt Gerron, Hans Albers. (98 min.)\n\nSterritt **** A fussy old schoolteacher named Professor Unrath falls in love with a slinky nightclub singer named Lola Lola, whereupon his life falls apart in ways that are poignant as they are predictable. First released in 1930, this great masterpiece of German film is evocative and inventive from its first shot to its last, with brilliant use of sound and astonishing performances from two of Europe's most gifted stars. Dietrich's acting here is what made her a motion-picture legend. In German with English subtitles\n\nBob le Flambeur (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Jean-Pierre Melville. With Roger Duchesne, Isabelle Corey, Daniel Cauchy, Guy Decomble. (100 min.)\n\nSterritt **** Set in Montmartre's nightclub district, this 1955 comedy-drama follows the adventures of a high-rolling gambler who gets tired of losing money at the casino and decides to rob the place instead. This isn't one of the greatest French crime dramas, like Melville's own \"Le Doulos\" and \"Le Samuraï,\" both made in the '60s. But its dark-toned cinematography by Henri Decaë still packs a wallop, and the screenplay has a refreshing sense of humor, reflecting Melville's concept of the picture as less a straightforward cops-and-robbers story than a scruffy comedy of manners. In French with English subtitles.\n\nBoys to Men (Not rated)\n\nDirectors: Phillip Bartel, Duncan Tucker, Dan Castle, Carl Pfirman. With Ema A. Tuennerman, Brett Chukerman, John Sloan, Paul Dawson, Wayne Danner. (75 min.)\n\nSterritt **\n\nAn anthology of four short films about gay-related subjects. \"Crush\" is a gentle but ordinary coming-of-age story. Neither \"The Mountain King\" nor \"...lost\" has much of interest to say. By contrast, \"The Confession,\" about a man returning to religion late in his life, is extraordinarily sensitive and original, marking Pfirman as a highly promising talent.\n\nBread and Roses (R)\n\nDirector: Ken Loach. With Pilar Padilla, Adrien Brody, Elpidia Carrilo, George Lopez, Alonso Chavez.(110 min.)\n\nSterritt *** Pitting his moral ideals against hard realities, a young American social worker helps two Mexican immigrant sisters and their freinds with a strike they hope will improve their lives as economically exploited office-building janitors. This socially alert drama is Loach's first production shot in the United States and while it doesn't measure up to his best British movies, it continually strives to do the ethically right thing.\n\nStaff *** Inspiring, whimsical, impassioned.\n\nBread and Tulips (PG-13)\n\nDirector: Silvio Soldini. With Licia Maglietta, Bruno Ganz, Giuseppe Battiston, Antonio Catania. (104 min.)\n\nSterritt *** A new life blossoms for a 40-year-old Italian housewife when she misses a bus, gets separated from her husband and children, and decides she'd rather explore the wonders of Venice - and the friendship of offbeat new acquaintances - than return to her old routine of worn-out domesticity. Maglietta gives a magical performance in this lightweight but flavorsome comedy. In Italian with English subtitles.\n\nBridget Jones's Diary (R)\n\nDirector: Sharon Maguire. With Renée Zellweger, Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Jim Broadbent. (94 min.)\n\nSterritt ** A romantic Englishwoman searches for a man who won't mind her slightly bulky figure and slightly dissolute habits, and finds herself dallying with her cocky boss while dodging the company of a lawyer who'd be a duller but more dignified partner. This lightweight comedy evidently sees itself as a Jane Austen spinoff in the \"Clueless\" vein, and fans of the genre will enjoy it if they're not distracted by trite plot twists, Firth's one-note formality, or Zellweger's on-and-off English accent.\n\nStaff ***1/2 Exaggerated, v.g. (very good), very British.\n\nVS/N: 3 sex scenes, no nudity. 3 instances of innuendo and several sexual references. VV: 1 scene with a fistfight. VP: 35 including many harsh expressions. VD: 15 scenes of smoking and drinking.\n\nBrigham City (PG)\n\nDirector: Richard Dutcher. With Richard Dutcher, Matthew A. Brown, Carrie Morgan, Wilford Brimley. (118 min.)\n\nSterritt ** A brutal crime is investigated by a Utah sheriff who's also a Mormon bishop. He wants to solve the case, but he cares as much about protecting the psychological serenity of his flock as ferreting out the evildoer, and there are signs that naiveté may be blinding him to hard realities. Few movies have sought this particular blend of detective-story melodrama and religious sensitivity, but the result would be more impressive if its ideas matched its sincerity, and if Dutcher had cast a more compelling actor than himself as the crime-solving clergyman.\n\nBrother (R)\n\nDirector: Takeshi Kitano. With Beat Takeshi, Omar Epps, Claude Maki. (112 min.)\n\nSterritt ** On the run from murderous rivals, a Tokyo thug relocates to Los Angeles, takes over a relative's drug racket, and strikes up a complex relationship with a new African-American crony. As usual, Kitano's deadpan style serves him better as an actor than a director. Kitano stars in this melodrama under the name Beat Takeshi, which he uses in his popular Japanese television shows - but his first production made outside Japan has enough odd twists to be mildly interesting. Look out for a good deal of stinging violence, though. In Japanese with English subtitles\n\nThe Brothers (R)\n\nDirector: Gary Hardwick. With Bill Bellamy, Morris Chestnut, D.L. Hughley, Shemar Moore. (103 min.)\n\nStaff ** Commitment suddenly becomes an issue in the lives of four 30-ish African-American buddies when it dawns on them that they could be taking a more mature approach to relationships with women. The results for them and their loved ones are dramatic and sometimes hilarious. Despite predictable plotting, uneven acting and direction, and sexual banter more raunchy than necessary, positive values shine through. By M.K. Terrell\n\nVS/N: 11 scenes of innuendo and frank talk; 4 scenes of implied sex. VV: 5 scenes, including a fight and shooting. VP: 146 mostly harsh expressions. VD: 10 instances of drinking; 2 scenes with smoking.\n\nBridget Jones's Diary (R)\n\nDirector: Sharon Maguire. With Renée Zellweger, Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Jim Broadbent. (94 min.)\n\nSterritt ** A romantic Englishwoman searches for a man who won't mind her slightly bulky figure and slightly dissolute habits, and finds herself dallying with her cocky boss while dodging the company of a lawyer who'd be a duller but more dignified partner. This lightweight comedy evidently sees itself as a Jane Austen spinoff in the \"Clueless\" vein, and fans of the genre will enjoy it if they're not distracted by trite plot twists, Firth's one-note formality, or Zellweger's on-and-off English accent.\n\nStaff ***1/2 Exaggerated, v.g. (very good), very British.\n\nVS/N: 3 sex scenes, no nudity. 3 instances of innuendo and several sexual references. VV: 1 scene with a fistfight. VP: 35 including many harsh expressions. VD: 15 scenes of smoking and drinking.\n\nBubble Boy (PG-13)\n\nDirector: Blair Hayes. With Jake Gyllenhaal, Swoosie Kurtz, Marley Shelton, John Lynch. (84 min.)\n\nStaff * You've probably heard the controversy. Protesters say that \"Bubble Boy,\" a tale of an immunity deficient boy quarantined for life inside his home, makes fun of the disabled. They're wrong. The boy is portrayed as a resourceful role-model. It's racial minorities who ought to be offended by their portrayal. When the boy builds a hermetically sealed bubble so he can leave the home to find the girl of his dreams, everyone he encounters on his road trip is a freak. The story would have been more interesting if the main character had emerged into something approximating the real world. By Stephen Humphries\n\nVS/N: 6 instances of innuendo. VV: 10 scenes, including gory killing of a cow. VP: 29 occasionally harsh expressions. VD: 2 scenes with smoking, 2 scenes with drinking.\n\nBully (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Larry Clark. With Brad Renfro, Rachel Miner, Nick Stahl, Bijou Phillips, Michael Pitt, Kelli Garner. (106 min.)\n\nSterritt *** Beset by verbal and physical abuse from a relentlessly aggressive friend, a group of teenagers decide to solve their problem by taking the bully out of town and killing him. Based on a real-life incident, this grim drama follows in the footsteps of Clark's notorious \"Kids,\" combining information and titillation by showing a youthful cast enacting youth-culture behavior at its most destructive. The movie's somber message is worth heeding, and the acting is mostly excellent.\n\nCaptain Corelli's Mandolin (R)\n\nDirector: John Madden. With Nicolas Cage, Penélope Cruz, Christian Bale, Irene Papas, John Hurt. (125 min.)\n\nSterritt ** Cage plays a music-loving Italian officer who's garrisoned on a lovely Greek island during World War II, where he falls for a young woman (Cruz) who resists him at first, but eventually succumbs to his mischievous yet manly charm, dismaying the simple fisherman she's engaged to marry. While this romantic fantasy has a fair amount of shooting and killing, its heart is in the ill-starred love affair that dominates most of the plot. This would be fine, if the romance were well enough written, directed, and acted to capture our hearts as well. But the only aspect that emerges a winner is the gorgeous Mediterranean scenery.\n\nStaff ***1/2 Beautiful, miscast, heavy hearted, jerky, beautiful scenery.\n\nVS/N:4 scenes of nudity, 1 scene of implied sex. VV: 8 gory war scenes. VP: 5 harsh expressions. VD: 9 scenes with alcohol, 3 with cigarettes.\n\nCats & Dogs (PG)\n\nDirector: Lawrence Guterman. With Jeff Goldblum, Elizabeth Perkins, Alexander Pollock, voices of Tobey Maguire, Susan Sarandon, Alec Baldwin. (87 min.)\n\nSterritt * Goldblum plays a scientist working on an anti-allergy medicine, but the real action centers on wicked cats who want to take over the world and resourceful dogs who want to save us all. The plot pants so hard to please all conceivable tastes - touching every base from \"Babe: Pig in the City\" and \"101 Dalmatians\" to \"Chicken Run\" and the \"Austin Powers\" pictures - that it makes less sense than the average pet-food commercial.\n\nStaff **1/2 A casual joy, not quite purrfect, witty.\n\nVS/N: None. VV: 16 scenes of cartoon-like violence. VP: 4 very mild. VD: None.\n\nThe Caveman's Valentine (R)\n\nDirector: Kasi Lemmons. With Samuel L. Jackson, Aunjanue Ellis, Colm Feore, Ann Magnuson, Sean MacMahon, Tamara Tunie, Anthony Michael Hall. (103 min.)\n\nSterritt ** Jackson gives a lively and generally credible performance as the unlikely hero: a homeless man with a deranged mind, a talent for music, and enough clues to solve a murder if the world would just pay attention to him. More psychological realism and less showy cinema would have made this offbeat melodrama more memorable, though.\n\nCenter of the World (Not Rated)\n\nDirector: Wayne Wang. With Peter Sarsgaard, Molly Parker, Carla Gugino. (88 min.)\n\nStaff * A young millionaire pays a stripper to accompany him to Las Vegas for the weekend in this grim and ultimately flat attempt to dissect the difference between money, sex, emotions, and what's really real. Director Wayne Wang relies on a self-consciously arty digital film style and brutally direct sex scenes - some of which border on pornographic - to make his film appear groundbreaking, but it ultimately leaves its audience as cold as its lifeless characters. By Amanda Paulson\n\nStaff * Devoid of passion, pretentious, sophomoric script, hollow.\n\nVS/N: 14 scenes, often exceptionally graphic. VV: 1 instance of beating. VP: 48 harsh expressions. VD: 2 scenes with smoking; 8 scenes with alcohol.\n\nChunhyang (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Im Kwon Taek. With Lee Hyo Jung, Cho Seung Woo, Kim Sung Nyu. (120 min.)\n\nSterritt **** The mythic tale of a courtesan's daughter who falls in love with a ruler's son, then suffers a thousand torments when a selfish governor decides he wants her for himself. Told through an imaginative blend of ravishing camera work and chanted \"pansori\" storytelling, this astoundingly beautiful Korean production is poignant, original, and engrossing. In Korean with English subtitles\n\nLa Ciénaga (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Lucrecia Martel. With Mercedes Moran, Martin Adjemian, Graciela Borges, Leonora Balcarce. (103 min.)\n\nSterritt ** The lives of two dysfunctional households in a small Argentine town during the hottest, stickiest summer anyone can remember. Martel shows great promise as a visual stylist and a director of strong performances, vividly etching her characters and condensing the experiences of three generations into a single economical story. But her screenplay gives little of interest, once the novelty of meeting these people has worn off. The title means \"The Swamp,\" and you may feel you're in one after 103 minutes with such a generally unlikable gang. In Spanish with English subtitles\n\nThe Circle (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Jafir Panahi. With Fereshteh Sadr Orafai, Maryiam Parvin Almani. (91 min.)\n\nSterritt **** A pregnant woman in despair, two women running from a prison sentence, and a grandmother who dreads her family's reaction to the birth of a baby girl are among the main characters of this suspenseful and ingeniously directed drama about problems of women in Iran today. Banned in its own country, the film stands with the most compelling movies ever made about specifically female challenges and tribulations. In Farsi with English subtitles\n\nStaff *** Naturalistic, bare-bones acting, unsettling, not sentimental.\n\nVS/N: 5 mild inferences. VV: None. VP: 4 mild. VD: 1 instance of smoking.\n\nThe Claim (R)\n\nDirector: Michael Winterbottom. With Peter Mullan, Sarah Polley, Wes Bentley, Nastassja Kinski. (120 min.)\n\nSterritt ** An offbeat adaptation of Thomas Hardy's great novel, \"The Mayor of Casterbridge,\" about a self-made man whose privileged existence masks two secrets: a sordid episode in his past, and an unstable personality that threatens to reemerge when his protégé turns into a rival. It's not clear why Winterbottom has moved the story to California in 1869. In any case, his version seems more clever than heartfelt, and whether you enjoy it may depend on how much you like Robert Altman's eccentric western \"McCabe and Mrs. Miller,\" which it uncannily resembles.\n\nStaff **1/2 Atmospheric, epic, a snowed-in western.\n\nVS/N: 7 scenes of implied sex and partial or full nudity. VV: 9 scenes including a brawl, gunfights and a suicide. VP: 7 including many harsh expressions. VD: 9 scenes of smoking. 7 scenes of drinking.\n\nThe Closet (Not Rated)\n\nDirector: Francis Veber. With Gerard Depardieu, Daniel Auteuil, Michel Aumont, Jean Rochefort. (84 min.)\n\nStaff *** Brian Francois Pignon's life is falling apart. Not only has his wife left him, but he is about to lose his job in a condom factory. Desperate, he pretends he's gay to save his job. And thus begins his trajectory from superbly dull, utterly conventional bore to a man suddenly more interesting to his co-workers, his family, and himself. Daniel Auteuil and Gerard Depardieu star in this delightful farce, in the tradition of \"La Cage Aux Folles,\" which, at its best, is laugh-out-loud funny and incredibly warm-hearted. In French with English subtitles. By Amanda Paulson\n\nCode Unknown (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Michael Haneke. With Juliette Binoche, Alexandre Hamidi, Ona Lu Yenke, Luminita Gheorghiu, Thierry Neuvic. (117 min.)\n\nSterritt *** Two émigrés and a Frenchman have a streetside scuffle in Paris, and this fragmented drama traces the far-reaching ramifications of what might have seemed a fleeting, if unfortunate, encounter. Haneke brings his usual dark sensibility to bear on the multifaceted story, expressing the fractured quality of modern city life through scenes that wander through a labyrinth of missing links and lost connections. The overall effect is sometimes powerful, often puzzling, and generally less robust than single-minded Haneke films such as \"The Seventh Continent\" and the indelible \"Funny Games.\" Originally titled \"Code Inconnu.\" In French with English subtitles\n\ncrazy/beautiful (PG-13)\n\nDirector: John Stockwell. With Kirsten Dunst, Jay Hernandez, Bruce Davison. (95 min.)\n\nStaff ** Here's an antidote to the Freddie Prinze Jr. teen films. This tale is about a love affair between a rebellious rich girl and a Hispanic boy who travels four hours a day to attend her school. The film avoids overplaying their cultural differences and there's a pleasing naturalistic feel throughout. Dunst also impresses with the energy and the nuances she brings to a suprisingly sexually explicit role. It's a pity there isn't enough of a compelling plot to capitalize on a promising premise. By Stephen Humphries\n\nCrocodile Dundee in Los Angeles (PG)\n\nDirector: Simon Wincer. With Paul Hogan, Linda Kozlowski. (92 min.)\n\nStaff * You'll sooner find snow on Ayers Rock than you will laughs in this third outing of the Crocodile Dundee series. The flimsiest plot device sends Dundee, his girlfriend, and child from the Australian outback to Los Angeles. Dundee then wanders about L.A. from one flat episode to another. Stay home and watch the real crocodile hunter, Steve Irwin, on the cable's \"Animal Planet\" instead. By Stephen Humphries\n\nCupid's Mistake (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Young Man Kang. With Susan Petry, Everardo Gil, Toya Cho, Ken Yasuda, Young Man Kang. (70 min.)\n\nSterritt * Los Angeles lovers pair off with one another on the rebound in this contemporary version of the old \"La Ronde\" idea. The acting is uneven and most of the romancing seems so mismatched that it's not surprising when things fall apart time after time. But there are appealing moments along the way, and the director gets impressive mileage with a budget that can only be called minuscule.\n\nCure (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Kiyoshi Kurosawa. With Koji Yakusho, Masato Hagiwara, Anna Nakagawa, Tsuyoshi Ujiki. (115 min.)\n\nSterritt *** A police officer tries to figure out the mystery behind a series of savage murders perpetrated by a widely varying group of people who have no memory of the crimes they've committed. The story dawdles and meanders, but Kurosawa's visual imagination keeps it cinematically stimulating. Be warned that, like some other Japanese productions of the late '90s and early '00s, it contains quite a few grisly and ghastly images. In Japanese with English subtitles\n\nThe Curse of the Jade Scorpion (PG-13)\n\nDirector: Woody Allen. With Woody Allen, Helen Hunt, Dan Aykroyd, Charlize Theron, David Ogden Stiers, Brian Markinson, Elizabeth Berkley, Wallace Shawn. (93 min.)\n\nSterritt ** Allen falls back on fast-talking comedy and old-movie nostalgia in this parody of 1940s melodrama, with Woody as an insurance investigator trying to unravel a crime that he committed himself after a session with a sinister nightclub hypnotist. There are lots of plot twists and romantic angles. What's lacking is laughs.\n\nStaff *** Superb period detail, Slow start but great finish, good fun.\n\nVS/N: 11 instances of innuendo. VV: 1 comic scene. VP: 13 mild expressions. VD: 10 scenes with alcohol, 21 with cigarettes.\n\nThe Day I Became a Woman (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Marziyeh Meshkini. With Fatemeh Cheragh, Shabnam Toloui, Azizeh Seddighi. (75 min.)\n\nSterritt **** This exquisitely filmed Iranian drama tells three separate stories focusing on women's lives. One heroine is a nine-year-old girl deciding how to spend the last remaining hour before she officially becomes a woman by the standards of her culture; another is a wife who decides to assert her independence despite opposition from her husband, and the third is an elderly woman trying for a different kind of independence by making whimsical use of money that's fallen into her hands. Every episode is charged with humanity and compassion. In Farsi with English subtitles\n\nThe Deep End (R)\n\nDirectors: Scott McGehee, David Siegel. With Tilda Swinton, Goran Visnjic, Jonathan Tucker, Peter Donat. (99 min.)\n\nSterritt ** Trying to protect her teenage son from the sinister influence of an ill-chosen older friend, a woman finds herself covering up a death and negotiating with a tenacious blackmailer. Swinton has some affecting moments as the mom, but the rest of the acting is second-rate, and the directors (previously known for \"Suture,\" which also promised more than it delivered) give it little originality or oomph. The same story was told vastly better in the 1949 melodrama \"The Reckless Moment,\" directed by the Max Ophuls and starring James Mason in one of his most indelible roles.\n\nThe Devil's Backbone (R)\n\nDirector: Guillermo del Toro. With Eduardo Noriega, Marisa Paredes, Federico Luppi, Inigo Garces. (106 min.)\n\nSterritt *** Sent to a boarding school for orphans during the Spanish Civil War, a homeless boy deals with intrigues among students and teachers, and confronts two dark mysteries: Is there lurking danger in an undetonated bomb standing like a grim statue just outside the school's doors, and is there more menace in the ghost of a murdered pupil who haunts its rooms and corridors? This moody ghost story follows generally familiar lines despite its unusual historical setting, but it's imaginatively filmed and builds a sense of brooding emotional power.\n\nDiamond Men (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Daniel M. Cohen. With Robert Forster, Donnie Wahlberg, Bess Armstrong, Jasmine Guy. (100 min.)\n\nSterritt ** An aging diamond dealer (Forster) goes on the road with a protégé (Wahlberg), who insists on behaving like the hero of a sleazy traveling-salesman joke. This modest comedy-drama begins as a mildly engaging tale of two conflicting but basically decent personalities, then loses its way in a crime-movie subplot and a less-than-believable love affair. Forster is always a pleasure to watch, though.\n\nThe Dish (PG-13)\n\nDirector: Rob Sitch. With Sam Neill, Tom Long, Kevin Harrington, Patrick Warburton, Genevieve Mooy. (104 min.)\n\nSterritt ***\n\nFact-based comedy about the triumphs and tribulations of the men who ran the enormous Australian broadcast receiver that transmitted live pictures around the world when American astronaut Neil Armstrong became the first human being to set foot on the moon. The acting and screenplay are amusing, but director Sitch might have taken a more adventurous approach to a tale with such an adventurous subject.\n\nDivided We Fall (PG)\n\nDirector: Jan Hrebejk. With Bolek Polivka, Csongor Kassai, Jaroslav Duslek, Anna Siskovà. (123 min.)\n\nStaff ** \"You wouldn't believe what abnormal times can do to normal people,\" says one character in this film. Well maybe you can. There's no time for heroes in this small Czech town torn apart by Nazi occupation. This is a typical tale of an unexceptional couple, risking their lives for the Jew hiding out in the basement, while they desperately try to hold onto a sense of normalcy in unusually troubled times. With a tasteless combination of horror and humor, \"Divided We Fall\" is a semi-successful, but unoriginal, portrayal of the strength of human character. By Deborah Henderson\n\nVS/N: None. VV: 8 scenes, extremely violent. VP: 11 expressions. VD: None.\n\nDjomeh (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Hassan Yektapanah. With Rashid Akbari, Valiollah Beta, Mahbobeh Khalili. (94 min.)\n\nSterritt **** The title character is an Afghani immigrant who works at a small Iranian dairy farm, where he shares his memories and hopes with his sympathetic boss. Their relationship grows more complicated when Djomeh falls in love with an Iranian woman and needs help winning her affection - no easy matter, given the strictness of Iranian courtship customs and the fact that he doesn't fit the local profile for a desirable catch. The performances of this quiet Iranian drama are utterly genuine, and the story is a delicate blend of slice-of-life realism and soft-spoken social commentary. In short, it's as smart and entertaining as they come. In Farsi with English subtitles\n\nDon't Say a Word (R)\n\nDirector: Gary Fleder. With Michael Douglas, Brittany Murphy, Sean Bean, Famke Janssen. (110 min.)\n\nSterritt ** Douglas plays a New York psychiatrist treating a troubled teenager who's been faking most of her afflictions for years; then his daughter gets kidnapped by a twisted criminal who's after a crucial number buried in the teen's memory. The movie has promise as a psychological thriller, but the filmmakers show far more interest in chases and shoot-outs than characters and ideas.\n\nDouble Take (PG-13)\n\nDirector: George Gallo. With Orlando Jones, Eddie Griffin, Gary Grubbs, Daniel Roebuck. (88 min.)\n\nStaff **1/2 Hardly anything is what it seems in this Hitchcock spoof (call it \"South by Southwest\"). A New York banker (Jones) wrongly suspected of murder, trades identities with a crazy con artist from the streets (Griffin) and flees the city for Mexico, pursued by drug dealers, police, FBI, and a little dog with sharp teeth. Not a good picture, but the two leads often rise above the convoluted plot, sloppy continuity, ethnic stereotyping, and excessive violence to provide some genuinely funny moments. By M.K. Terrell\n\nDown to Earth (PG-13)\n\nDirectors: Chris Weitz, Paul Weitz. With Chris Rock, Chazz Palminteri, Greg Germann, Regina King. (95 min.)\n\nStaff ** Lance (Rock), a bike messenger and aspiring comedian, is hit and killed by a truck when on his route while ogling a beautiful woman at the cross-walk. When the angels in heaven discover that it wasn't \"his time\" yet, they offer him a temporary body (that of an old, wealthy white man), until they can find a more appropriate one for him. With this \"second chance,\" good-hearted Lance takes advantage of the opportunities this new body allows him, also proving that it's not what someone looks like, it's who they are that is important. There is a good moral message to this movie, but it's too crude for younger viewers and Rock's comedy is a little on the weak side. By Heidi Wilson\n\nVS/N: 4 scenes with innuendo. VV: 8 instances, including a suicide and attempted murder. VP: 75 expressions, mostly mild. VD: 7 scenes with alcohol, 1 scene with smoking.\n\nDowntown 81 (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Edo Bertoglio. With Jean Michel Basquiat, Deborah Harry, Walter Steding. (77 min.)\n\nSterritt ** A young artist looks for money, security, and affection during a long day when he almost gets evicted from his New York apartment. This scruffy, streetwise drama was shot in the early 1980s, but wasn't released for 20 years because of financial and technical problems. Its main value is the prolonged look it gives of the late artist Basquiat, who was 19 when he played the leading role, and looks uncannily like the actor Jeffrey Wright, who played him in the later bio-pic \"Basquiat.\"\n\nDr. Dolittle 2 (PG)\n\nDirector: Steve Carr. With Eddie Murphy, Kristen Wilson, and voices of Steve Zahn, Lisa Kudrow. (90 min.)\n\nStaff *1/2 The writers must have thought, \"Hey, if we can feature a mafia-type raccoon, a drinking monkey, and a Latino chameleon that can talk, this movie will write itself!\" They were so wrong. Murphy reprises his 1998 role as Dr. Dolittle who must help save a forest from money-hungry loggers. It delivers a few laughs with contemporary phrases such as \"whaazzzuuuup,\" \"Hasta la vista, baby,\" and \"Hello, Clarice,\" but that's about it. The writers rely on crude humor for cheap laughs. By Lisa Leigh Parney\n\nStaff *** Family fun, rapid-fire humor, upbeat.\n\nVS/N: None. VV: None. VP: 10 mild expressions. VD: 2 with alcohol.\n\nDriven (PG-13)\n\nDirector: Renny Harlin. With Sylvester Stallone, Burt Reynolds, Estelle Warren, Gina Gershon. (120 min.)\n\nSterritt **1/2 Actor, writer, and producer Sylvester Stallone and director Renny Harlin hope to re-create the success they had with \"Cliffhanger\" in this well-done, but flat, action-drama. The story of this racing-car tale is pure formula: A young rookie beats all odds to come out on top, and finds out what he's made of. But it's the racing scenes that take center stage, and the crashes are among the most realistic ever put on film. By Alex Kaloostian\n\nStaff DUD Predictable, insipid, hokey, overwrought, belongs on the scrap heap.\n\nVS/N: 4 instances of innuendo and numerous shots of scantily clad women. VV: 7 scenes of video game-like car crashes, no gore. VP: 11 mild expressions. VD: 3 scenes with alcohol.\n\nEnemy at the Gates (R)\n\nDirector: Jean-Jacques Annaud. With Ed Harris, Rachel Weisz, Jude Law, Eva Mattes, Joseph Fiennes, Bob Hoskins. (133 min.)\n\nSterritt * Rivalry flares between a Soviet sniper and his Nazi counterpart as they hone their skills, stalk their prey, and ultimately turn their sights on each other during World War II's cataclysmic Battle of Stalingrad. Annaud seems more interested in epic visual sweep than deep-rooted human emotion, though, and interesting troupers like Harris and Law just go through the motions. Add a megadose of bombastic James Horner music and a perfunctory love-affair subplot and you have a movie that's its own worst enemy.\n\nStaff ** Shallow, authentic-feeling, suspenseful.\n\nVS/N: 1 scenes with partial nudity. VV: 15 instances, including gory war scenes. VP: 6 mild expressions. VD: 11 scenes with smoking. 4 scenes with alcohol.\n\nEureka (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Shinji Aoyama. With Yakusho Koji, Miyazaki Aoi, Miyazaki Masaru, Saitoh Yohichiroh. (217 min.)\n\nSterritt **** After surviving a violent crime, two youngsters set off on a meandering odyssey through the Japanese countryside with an eccentric bus driver they've befriended, only to discover that ongoing eruptions of violence are traveling in their wake. Filmed in a style at once intimate and expansive, with understated acting and brilliant use of wide-screen black-and-white cinematography, Aoyama's celebrated movie is an ambitious psychological drama and a probing look at the intersections of kinship and friendship. In Japanese with English subtitles\n\nEverybody's Famous (R)\n\nDirector: Dominique Deruddere. With Josse de Pauw, Werner De Scmedt, Victor Low, Thekla Reuten. (97 min.)\n\nStaff *** Suddenly out of work when a factory closes down, a Belgian bottle inspector hatches a plan to launch his career as a songwriter and make his unprepossessing daughter a singing star. His scheme is to hold the country's top singer hostage until her manager gives him the backing he needs. This perfectly cast dig at fame and the entertainment industry, filled with misfits, look-alikes and wannabes, takes its potshots gently, with subtle delights and surprises at every fun. In Flemish with English subtitles. By M.K. Terrell\n\nVS/N: 4 scenes of implied sex, with nudity; 2 instances of innuendo. VV: 2 mild scenes. VP: 15 harsh expressions. VD: 4 scenes with smoking, 4 scenes with drinking, 1 scene with pilltaking.\n\nEverything Moves Alone (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Mike Aransky. With Philip Guerette, Thomas Edward Seymour, Mike Aransky. (100 min.)\n\nSterritt * A young man moves to a small town, makes a couple of unlikely friends, and finds himself involved in a bizarre quarrel between his new acquaintances. This comedy-drama means well, but it'll be a long time before you see more self-indulgent screenwriting and unpersuasive acting in a single movie.\n\nEvolution (PG-13)\n\nDirector: Ivan Reitman. With David Duchovny, Julianne Moore, Orlando Jones, Seann William Scott. (105 min.)\n\nSterritt *** Two scholars from a community college discover a microscopic horde of newly arrived aliens. They have to stop the menace once the cute little critters become ugly big critters. At its best, this unevenly paced comedy is an amusing parody of monster movies.\n\nStaff ** \"Ghostbusters\" redux, dumb, good video rental.\n\nVS/N: 3 scenes of innuendo, 1 with partial male nudity. VV: 7 scary scenes, but not too gory. VP: 40 mostly mild expressions. VD: 2 scenes with smoking, 2 with drinking.\n\nExit Wounds (R)\n\nDirector: Andrzej Bartkowiak. With Steven Seagal, DMX, Anthony Anderson, Jill Hennessey. (117 min.)\n\nStaff **\n\nPandemonium reigns in Seagal movies. Here he's a Detroit detective who saves the US vice president from a kidnapping plot. His extreme tactics don't amuse the department's top brass, however, and they reduce him to daytime traffic details and nighttime rage-management classes. But when he sniffs out a drug ring on his beat, he's right back to his old tricks. Plot twists (when plot intrudes on anarchy) and unusual casting (rapper DMX's compassionate drug dealer) keep this one from being a total cliché. Occasional flashes of humor offer respite from the havoc. By M.K. Terrell\n\nVS/N: 3 scenes of innuendo; 2 scenes with nudity. VV: 12 scenes. VP: 136 mostly harsh expressions. VD: 5 instances of drinking; 1 scene with smoking; 4 scenes with drug deals.\n\nFaat Kine (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Ousmane Sembene. With Venus Seye, Mame Ndumbe Diop, Ndiagne Dia, Mariame Balde. (118 min.)\n\nSterritt **** This gently told Senegalese comedy-drama centers on an ordinary woman who works in a service station and devotes her spare time to her college-age children and aging mother. The story touches on an enormously wide range of subjects - some personal, like the challenges of marriage in a society where men often have multiple wives, and others cultural or political, like the influence of Islamic traditions and the social uncertainties of a postcolonial African country. Sembene has opened up a whole new world of African cinema during his illustrious career, and this intelligent yet easy-going masterpiece ranks close to his best work. In French and Wolof with English subtitles\n\nFaithless (R)\n\nDirector: Liv Ullmann. With Erland Josephson, Lena Endre, Krister Henriksson, Thomas Hanzon, Michelle Gylemo, Johan Rabaeus, Stina Ekblad, Juni Dahr, Philip Zanden, Marie Richardson. (155 min.)\n\nSterritt *** An intense, claustrophobic drama of love and infidelity, as seen through the eyes of an actress whose seemingly contented life as a wife and mother is tragically tested by romantic temptations touched off by her husband's closest friend. The film's tone is so intimate that one of the characters is screenwriter Ingmar Bergman himself, who sets the story in motion by having a conversation with the female protagonist he's conceived in his imagination. On one level, \"Faithless\" is a probing look at love, marriage, loyalty, and other emotional issues. On other levels, it's about the complex relationships between bedrock human feelings and the process of exploring these through art.\n\nFallen Angels Paradise (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Ossama Fawzi. With Mahmoud Hemida, Lebleba, Caroline Khalil, Safwa. (79 min.)\n\nSterritt ** The death of a low-life drug dealer sets his accomplices scheming to profit from his demise, but then his family gets into the act, sparking unexpected revelations about his surprisingly respectable early life. It's rare for an Egyptian movie to look so closely and unflinchingly at class conflict and other forms of social disarray, but lively acting keeps the story engaging even when it wanders and meanders. In Arabic with English subtitles\n\nThe Family Man (PG-13)\n\nDirector: Brett Ratner. With Nicholas Cage, Téa Leoni, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Piven. (125 min.)\n\nStaff *** This film, about a high executive businessman (Cage) given the opportunity to catch a glimpse of what his life would be like had he married his college sweetheart (Leoni), is pure Christmas. Not one offbeat word, glance, or gesture falls from their charming performances. They remain two snowflakes among holiday performances, which can oftentimes be more Scrooge than Kringle. By Christy Ellington\n\nStaff **1/2 Slow, nice message, mushy.\n\nFast and the Furious (PG-13)\n\nDirector: Rob Cohen. With Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordanna Brewster, Michelle Rodriguez. (140 min.)\n\nStaff **1/2 Faster than \"Gone in 60 Seconds,\" flashier than \"Driven,\" and more supercharged race cars and actual driving than both put together. What has to go? Well, plot and characterization, but you'll be too busy tapping your feet and gripping your seat to notice. Here's the deal: Brian, a not-so-hot rookie detective goes undercover to get to the bottom of a rash of truck hijackings. But will Brian learn how to double-pump the clutch before he blows out another set of piston rings? And did I mention there are lots of neat car chases? By Alex Kaloostian\n\nVS/N: 3 instances of innuendo. VV: 11 scenes, including fighting. VP: 58 harsh expressions. VD: 3 scenes with smoking, 3 scenes with drinking.\n\nFat Girl (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Catherine Breillat. With Anais Reboux, Roxane Mesquida, Libero de Rienzo. (93 min.)\n\nSterritt *** During a family vacation, an attractive 15-year-old falls in love with a seductive older man, sparking complicated feelings in her younger sister, an overweight girl whose ability to cope with sibling rivalry may eventually reach its limits. Breillat has probed issues of youthful sexuality before, most notably in her excellent \"36 Fillette,\" and she's an expert at coaxing strong performances from actors with little experience. This disturbing drama has many telling moments, but it ends with an out-of-the-blue shock episode that raises more questions than it answers about the story's overall psychological perspective. Originally titled \"A Ma soeur!\" In French with English subtitles\n\nFellini Satyricon (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Federico Fellini. With Martin Potter, Hiram Keller, Max Born. (129 min.)\n\nSterritt **** One of Italy's greatest filmmakers dreamed up this flamboyantly uninhibited visit to ancient Rome, and the results of his whimsy have been startling, shocking, and engrossing moviegoers ever since its 1969 release. See it if your most outrageous dream is to see your most outrageous dreams made visible on the wide screen. Stay far away if that prospect seems too daring or daunting for comfort.\n\nFever (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Alex Winter. With Henry Thomas, David O'Hara, Bill Duke, Teri Hatcher, John Tracy. (93 min.)\n\nSterritt ** A murder in a rundown apartment building sparks a series of strange events in the life of a psychologically unsteady man. This offbeat drama has more atmosphere than logic, but a few sequences are strikingly well acted and filmed.\n\n15 Minutes (R)\n\nDirector: John Herzfeld. With Robert De Niro, Edward Burns, Kelsey Grammer, Karel Roden, Oleg Taktarov, Avery Brooks. (120 min.)\n\nSterritt ** A homicide cop and an arson investigator get into a New York tussle with two thugs from Eastern Europe who think their violent schemes will bring fame and fortune as long as the media play into their hands. The premise is promising, but Herzfeld cares more about sensationalism than substance, and portions of the picture are far nastier than they had to be.\n\nStaff ** Uneven tone, well edited, silly.\n\nVS/N: 1 scene of implied sex with nudity. VV: 17 often gruesome scenes. VP: 90 mostly harsh expressions. VD: 10 instances of alcohol; 14 scenes with smoking.\n\nFinal Fantasy (PG-13)\n\nDirector: Hironobu Sakaguchi. With the voices of Alec Baldwin, Ming Na, James Woods, Donald Sutherland, Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames. (106 min.)\n\nSterritt ** It's the distant future (yet again) and Earth has been decimated by aliens. The military wants to blast them into oblivion, but the brainy and beautiful Dr. Aki Ross thinks she can solve things with a more high-minded approach. The movie is noteworthy because it's the first major Hollywood release to feature an entire cast of human characters generated completely through computer animation. While this is a striking technical feat, it poses an artistic problem. On one hand, the movie abandons the anything-goes imaginativeness of animation by slavishly imitating real-life human traits. On the other, it abandons the expressive power of genuine human performances by artificially creating all its images. Skeptics may feel that in its own small way, this sort of cinema is as dehumanizing as the aliens who serve as its intergalactic bad guys.\n\nStaff ** Creative, pantheistic, Digitally sophisticated, intense.\n\nVS/N: None. VV: 14 instances, quite intense. VP: 18 harsh expressions. VD: 1 instance of drinking.\n\nFinding Forrester (PG-13)\n\nDirector: Gus Van Sant. With Sean Connery, Rob Brown, Anna Paquin, F. Murray Abraham. (136 min.)\n\nSterritt ** Unlikely friendship develops between a gifted black high school student and a curmudgeonly old author who won a youthful Pulitzer Prize and then slipped into sullen seclusion. The premise is more interesting than the movie, which takes several wrong turns on its way to an unconvincing conclusion. Brown gives a smartly understated performance, though, and Paquin's talent continues to blossom.\n\nStaff *** Gentle, predictable, inspiring.\n\nVS/N: 5 incidences of innuendo. VV: 2 scenes with youths tussling. VP: 54 expressions, both mild and harsh. VD: 8 scenes with drinking, 3 scenes with smoking.\n\nThe Fluffer (Not rated)\n\nDirectors: Richard Glatzer, Wash West. With Michael Cunio, Roxanne Day, Scott Gurney. (96 min.)\n\nSterritt ** A young man goes to work in the porn-movie business and gets more involved with his favorite star than he expected or intended. This satirical drama tries to be an updated \"Boogie Nights,\" but it would have more heft if the filmmakers had been supplied with talented stars, original ideas, and a barely adequate budget. A wry peek at the porn industry is all it has to offer.\n\nFocus (PG-13)\n\nDirector: Neal Slavin. With William H. Macy, Laura Dern, David Paymer, Meat Loaf Aday. (100 min.)\n\nSterritt *** Macy plays a 1940s businessman who doesn't worry much about anti-Semitism until some people get the idea that he looks sort of Jewish himself, sparking events that cause him to lose his job. Neighbors are also angry at a local Jewish shopkeeper, and he's tempted to regain their trust by joining in their attacks. Slavin treats the tale as a philosophical fable about the never-ending struggle between good and evil. The result would be an important drama if the screenplay (based on an early Arthur Miller novel) didn't lapse into preachiness and imprecision at times.\n\nFreaks, Glam Gods and Rockstars (Not rated)\n\nDirector: John T. Ryan. With Jackie Beat, Justin Bond, Michael Musto, Jayne County. (74 min.)\n\nSterritt * A survey and celebration of New York City's underground rock scene, interviewing small-time celebrities and providing brief glimpses of their often outrageous acts. Traditional music fans won't find much to enjoy here, but the movie has value as an anthropological visit to a strange and thriving milieu.\n\nFrom Hell (R)\n\nDirectors: The Hughes Brothers. With Johnny Depp, Heather Graham, Ian Holm, Robbie Coltrane. (137 min.)\n\nSterritt *** Depp plays a 19th-century police inspector whose hunt for Jack the Ripper smokes out an enormous number of complications. The movie works well as a straight-out horror yarn, proving that the Hughes Brothers are more versatile than their previous \"ghetto pictures\" suggest. But it lacks the near-cosmic resonance of the book it's based on, a \"graphic novel\" by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell that makes far more interesting speculations on mysteries of myth and history, space and time, good and evil, life and death.\n\nStaff *** Amazing ambience, gritty, gory.\n\nVS/N: 7 scenes including sex and nudity. VV: 26 highly gory scenes. VP: 24 harsh expressions. VD: 15 scenes with alcohol, 7 scenes with cigarettes, 5 scenes with drugs.\n\nGet Over It (PG-13)\n\nDirector: Tommy O'Haver. With Kirsten Dunst, Ed Begley Jr., Sisqo, Martin Short, Swoosie Kurtz. (90 min.)\n\nStaff *1/2 Berke tries out for the school play, \"A Midsummer Night's Dream,\" hoping to win his ex-girlfriend back from her new boyfriend/costar. His best friend's little sister (Dunst), also in the play, helps him with his acting, but secretly loves him too. Thus their on-stage roles oddly mirror their off-stage lives. Short's over the top drama teacher, Sisqo's stagehand dancing, and Begley and Kurtz as ultra-'70's parents lend their support, but this grab bag of dreams, fantasies, and musical numbers, though amusing at times, never really falls together. By M.K. Terrell\n\nVS/N: 7 scenes of innuendo. VV: 8 scenes, including car accident. VP: 46 expressions, mostly mild. VD: 4 instances of drinking; 1 scene with marijuana.\n\nGhost World (R)\n\nDirector: Terry Zwigoff. With Thora Birch, Steve Buscemi, Scarlett Johansson, Brad Renfro. (111 min.)\n\nSterritt *** Reluctant to enter the ordinary adult world, which they find shallow and tedious, two girls just out of high school strike up a smirky relationship with an older man who has antisocial tendencies of his own, leading to various emotional complications. Zwigoff's first fiction film recalls his 1994 documentary \"Crumb\" in the sympathy it shows for marginalia of American life that most people overlook and undervalue. While this isn't a showy or flashy movie, it has social, psychological, and ultimately mystical overtones that raise it leagues above most other teen-centered comedies.\n\nStaff **1/2 Realistic coming-of-age tale, engagingly cast, intelligent humor.\n\nVS/N: 1 scene of implied sex, 4 scenes of innuendo. VV: 2 scenes. VP: 89 harsh expressions. VD: 6 scenes with drinking.\n\nGhosts of Mars (R)\n\nDirector: John Carpenter. With Ice Cube, Natasha Henstridge, Jason Statham, Pam Grier, Clea Duvall, Joanna Cassidy. (98 min.)\n\nSterritt * Earthlings living in a Martian colony battle hostile forces who resent this alien invasion of their desolate red planet. Carpenter pulls out all the action-adventure stops, but he and coscripter Larry Sulkis forgot to write dialogue the audience could listen to without howling in disbelief. Henstridge is fun to watch as the Martian cop, though, and Ice Cube still has a powerful screen presence, even when he isn't bothering to act.\n\nVS/N: 4 instances of nudity. VV: 24 gory scenes. VP: 65 harsh expressions. VD: 2 scenes with cigarettes, 4 scenes with drugs.\n\nGinger Snaps (Not rated)\n\nDirector: John Fawcett. With Emily Perkins, Katharine Isabelle, Mimi Rogers, Kris Lemche. (108 min.)\n\nSterritt *** Ginger and Brigitte are sisters who pride themselves on being different, so when other teens head for the dating and party scenes, they sit around the house thinking up gory ways to die. Then a mysterious creature invades their neighborhood, biting Ginger and turning her into a budding werewolf. (Hence the title.) This sardonic thriller blends teen-pic satire with finely tuned fright and a dark-toned view of teenage sexuality. If you can take its explicit violence, it's a monsterfest that rarely loses it bite.\n\nThe Glass House (PG-13)\n\nDirector: Daniel Sackheim. With Leelee Sobieski, Diane Lane, Stellan Skarsgard, Trevor Morgan. (111 min.)\n\nStaff * When Ruby and Rhett Baker's parents die in a mysterious car accident, they are taken under the legal guardianship of Erin and Terry Glass, who happen to live in a home constructed of glass. It isn't long before Ruby - played by the ever-sullen Leelee Sobieski - begins to realize that there's something creepy about their adoptive parents. This is one of those thrillers where lightning flashes ominously in a dark house; where the girl drops the car keys just as the killer is approaching the vehicle; where there's a false ending because the killer has to be killed twice. 'The Glass House' is too transparent to be effective. By Stephen Humphries\n\nThe Gleaners and I (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Agnès Varda. With Agnès Varda. (82 min.)\n\nSterritt **** A fascinating nonfiction voyage into rural and urban France, focusing on idiosyncratic individuals who live off things the rest of us throw away, from food to furniture. Varda carries this concept a step further by recognizing that she herself has been a gleaner during her long filmmaking career, capturing images and situations that usually go unnoticed by people living busy lives. Originally called \"Les Glaneurs et la glaneuse.\" In French with English subtitles\n\nThe Golden Bowl (R)\n\nDirector: James Ivory. With Nick Nolte, Kate Beckinsale, Jeremy Northam, Uma Thurman, James Fox, Anjelica Huston. (130 min.)\n\nSterritt *** Henry James's psychologically dense novel inspired this introspective drama about an American businessman and his daughter, who discover that their new spouses share a hidden past. Written by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala and produced by Ismail Merchant, the film will be too staid and stolid for audiences on the hunt for easy entertainment. Ivory gives it a sumptuous visual style and an exquisitely crafted early-20th-century milieu, though, offering fine pleasures for the eye and the imagination.\n\nStaff ***\n\nElegantly opulent, self-consciously arty, more surface than subtlety.\n\nVS/N: 1 sex scene, no nudity. VV: None. VP: 2 mild. VD: 9 instances of smoking, 6 instances of drinking.\n\nThe Gospel According to Philip K. Dick (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Mark Steensland. With Robert Anton Wilson, Paul Williams, Miriam Lloyd, Ray Nelson. (80 min.)\n\nSterritt ***\n\nAdmirers of \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" and other Dick literature will enjoy this nonfiction look at the writer, his career, and his eccentricities, some of which were as bizarre as his fiction. Don't expect much depth in this brief portrait, though.\n\nGreenfingers (R)\n\nDirector: Joel Hershman. With Clive Owen, Helen Mirren, David Kelly. (91 min.)\n\nStaff *** Good conduct gets a British felon (Owen) into an experimental \"open\" prison, where he discovers a flair for gardening. When a horticultural maven (Mirren) sees what he and his buddies have wrought, she soon has them in a national competition. The pro-rehabilitation message may be a bit obvious and the story a little pat (wouldn't you know, the botanical guru has a pretty daughter?), but the characters are charming. By M.K. Terrell\n\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (PG)\n\nDirector: Chris Columbus. With Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Robbie Coltrane, Maggie Smith. (150 min.)\n\nSterritt *** This richly produced fantasy stays true to the letter and spirit of J.K. Rowling's lively novel about an 11-year-old boy who discovers he's a natural-born wizard, enrolls in a school to learn magic and enchantment, and finds himself battling the sinister sorcerer who killed his parents when he was a baby. Columbus fills the screen with colorful images that make a world of spells seem as solid as the one we travel every day. What you won't find are qualities a truly great movie adaptation might have offered - new layers of meaning, perspectives on the story that only film images could provide, and fresh insights into the tale's moral and ethical questions.\n\nStaff **1/2 Stirs childhood memories, a bit ordinary, enchanting, top-notch effects.\n\nVS/N: None. VV: 8 scenes, quite intense for small children. VP: 1 mild expression. VD: 1 scene with alcohol.\n\nHannibal (R)\n\nDirector: Ridley Scott. With Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore, Ray Liotta, Giancarlo Giannini, Frankie R. Faison, Francesca Neri. (131 min.)\n\nSterritt *** Hopkins returns as Hannibal Lector, the brilliant psychiatrist with a sadistic personality, a weakness for cannibalism, and an odd affection for FBI agent Clarice Starling, this time played by Moore in a performance as inventive as Jodie Foster's in \"The Silence of the Lambs\" a decade earlier. Scott has directed the picture with his usual heavy touch - even the boisterous \"Lambs\" seems subtle by comparison - and much of the action is as ponderous as it is predictable. Lector fans will get their fill, but be warned that the menu contains at least two scenes with over-the-top excesses that Hannibal himself might not want to swallow.\n\nStaff **1/2 Extremely gory, good sequel, intelligent dialogue, opulent sets.\n\nVS/N: 15 scenes with innuendo. VV: 15 exceptionally violent scenes including cannibalism. VP: 5 expressions, mostly mild. VD: 9 scenes with smoking; 8 scenes with alcohol.\n\nHappenstance (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Laurent Firode. With Audrey Tautou, Faudel, Eric Feldman, Irene Ismailoff, Eric Savin. (96 min.)\n\nSterritt ** A department-store clerk, an elderly woman, and a sidewalk philosopher are among the diverse characters of this French fantasy-romance about lives that intersect by chance, in keeping with the notion that a hurricane in the Pacific might be caused by a butterfly beating its wings on the Atlantic days before. The movie has magical moments, but it's too contrived to gather much comic or dramatic power. Originally titled \"Le battement d'aile du papillon.\" In French with English subtitles\n\nHardball (PG-13)\n\nDirector: Brian Robbins. With Keanu Reeves, Diane Lane, John Hawk, D.B. Sweeney. (90 min.)\n\nStaff **1/2 His life threatened by bookies, Connor O'Neill (Reeves) agrees in desperation to coach Little League. In a world where \"don't nobody's father come back,\" O'Neill earns the boys' trust by showing up. Initially, O'Neill's only reason for coaching is to collect his weekly check. But the harsh realities of life in the projects won't let him, or the viewer, remain callous for long. Meanwhile, the young cast of \"Hardball\" pitches laughs and tears, making sure both you and O'Neill think twice about how to live. By Nathan Smith\n\nHead Over Heels (PG-13)\n\nDirector: Mark Waters. With Monica Potter, Freddie Prinze Jr., Brendan Beiser, Sarah O'Hare, China Chow. (127 min.)\n\nStaff DUD An art-restoration expert (Potter), moves into an apartment with \"the last four models in New York who don't smoke.\" She soon develops a crush on Jim (Prinze) who lives in an adjacent building across the way, until, in a \"Rear Window\"-ish twist, she thinks she sees him commit a murder. This romantic comedy is so awfully misjudged and ineptly executed in every department that, while it isn't quite a contender for the \"so bad it's good\" category, this critic was nonetheless dabbing tears of laughter from his eyes. By Stephen Humphries\n\nVS/N: 3 scenes of implied sex; 5 incidences of innuendo. VV: 6 scenes, including fistfights. VP: 15 harsh expressions, 14 mild expressions. VD: 6 scenes with alcohol.\n\nHeartbreakers (R)\n\nDirector: David Mirkin. With Sigourney Weaver, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Gene Hackman, Ray Liotta, Jason Lee, Anne Bancroft. (124 min.)\n\nStaff ** A mother (Weaver) and daughter (Hewitt) use their looks and low-cut dresses to scam their way through life. The senior partner marries millionaires and then, before the marriage can be consummated, gets the daughter to tempt the groom to ensure a speedy divorce with a big payoff. The cast is better than the material, especially Gene Hackman as a chain-smoking tobacco company executive in constant self-denial about the dangers of cigarettes. At over two hours long, you may be left feeling a little bit conned by the end. By Stephen Humphries\n\nStaff ** Predictable, not funny, unoriginal, vapid\n\nVS/N: 11 scenes of mostly innuendo and frank talk. VV: 11 scenes of slapstick violence. VP: 53 expressions, some harsh. VD: 6 instances of drinking; 25 scenes with smoking.\n\nHearts in Atlantis (PG-13)\n\nDirector: Scott Hicks. With Anthony Hopkins, Hope Davis, Anton Yelchin, Mika Boorem, David Morse. (98 min.)\n\nSterritt *** A mysterious stranger (Hopkins) rents a room above the home of an 11-year-old boy and his self-absorbed mother, then asks the child to keep an eye out for menacing enemies who want to capture him. The movie takes on a lot of material, from the boy's problems with bullies and romance to the stranger's clairvoyant powers. Hicks doesn't always keep the story clear and compelling, but Hopkins is in top form.\n\nVS/N: 3 instances of innuendo, including implied rape. VV: 6 scenes including beatings. VP: 13 expressions. VD: 6 scenes with smoking, 2 scenes with drinking.\n\nHedwig and the Angry Inch (R)\n\nDirector: John Cameron Mitchell. With John Cameron Mitchell, Miriam Shor, Stephen Trask. (94 min.)\n\nSterritt *** The hero was named Hansel during his East Berlin childhood. But after changing his sex and moving to the United States, he's become Hedwig the transgendered rock singer, playing in small-time restaurants and dreaming of revenge against Tommy Gnosis, a protégé who stole his songs. Cameron's imaginative directing and screen-shaking performance give this rock musical plenty of oomph, although some may find it a coolly calculated effort at instant cult-film fame.\n\nHeist (R)\n\nDirector: David Mamet. With Gene Hackman, Rebecca Pidgeon, Delroy Lindo, Patti LuPone, Danny DeVito, Ricky Jay. (107 min.)\n\nSterritt *** An aging thief (Hackman) assembles his accomplices (Lindo, Jay) and wife (Pidgeon) for an unusually ambitious crime. Complicating the job is the cantankerous crook they work for (DeVito) and the sleazy young thug (Rockwell) he forces them to team up with. At once a purebred caper movie and a loving tribute to that popular genre, the picture has plenty of tried-and-true elements, from its \"one last job\" scenario to the untried youngster who messes up the scam. It's fun watching the master criminal turn his worst mistakes into crafty comebacks, just as Mamet turns the most familiar ingredients into unpredictable jolts and reverse-twist surprises.\n\nStaff **1/2 Inscrutable, crisply directed, tired plot.\n\nVS/N: 1 scene of implied sex. VV: 2 scenes. VP: 92 harsh expressions. VD: 15 scenes with cigarettes, 3 scenes with alcohol.\n\nHidden Wars of Desert Storm (Not rated)\n\nDirectors: Gerard Ungerman, Audrey Brohy. With John Hurt, Ramsey Clark, Norman Schwarzkopf. (64 min.)\n\nSterritt *** An informative look at the Persian Gulf conflict, with emphasis on its cost in human lives and suffering, its roots in prior American involvement with the Middle East, the effect of subsequent economic sanctions on Iraqi citizens, and the possibility that the enigmatic Persian Gulf syndrome might be linked to munitions made of depleted uranium. Made by two investigative journalists, this concise documentary is worth viewing by anyone concerned about world events.\n\nIce From the Sun (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Eric Stanze. With DJ Vivona, Ramona Midgett, Angela Zimmerly, Todd Tevlin. (117 min.)\n\nSterritt ** A young woman is recruited to battle a mysterious presence that threatens humanity with violence and malevolence. Imaginatively filmed on what was obviously a shoestring budget, this underground shocker has moments of real visual creativity, along with a surprisingly talky screenplay and a general disregard for anything resembling old-fashioned good taste.\n\nIf... (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Lindsay Anderson. With Malcolm McDowell, Richard Warwick, Christine Noonan. (111 min.)\n\nSterritt**** Revolution strikes a repressive school for boys in this 1968 classic, which both embodies and critiques the rebellious atmosphere of the '60s era. At once comic, surrealistic, and outrageous, the movie marks a high point in Anderson's filmmaking career.\n\nIn the Mood for Love (PG)\n\nDirector: Wong Kar-wai. With Maggie Cheung, Tony Leung-Chiu-wai, Rebecca Pan, Lai Chin, Siu Ping-lam, Chin Tsi-ang. (97 min.)\n\nSterritt *** A journalist and a receptionist spend inordinate amounts of time in their lonely apartments, maintaining a polite distance between themselves until the man begins to suspect their spouses are having an affair with each other. The story gains most of its dramatic impact from superbly understated acting and Christopher Doyle's atmospheric camera work. Kudos also go to Nat King Cole's haunting renditions of Spanish-language songs on the proudly multicultural soundtrack. In Cantonese and Shanghainese with English subtitles\n\nInnocence (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Paul Cox. With Julia Blake, Charles Tingwell. (95 min.)\n\nStaff ***1/2 Yearning for the Englishwoman he loved in his youth, an aging Belgian widower finds her in Australia 45 years later where she is enduring a comforable but thankless marriage. Director Cox draws remarkably low-key performances from his cast, suggesting the would-be lovers' mental state with deft flashback glimmers of romance and separation. By M.K. Terrell.\n\nVS/N: 4 scenes, including nudity. VV: 2 scenes, including a minor tussle. VP: 3 expressions. VD: 8 scenes of drinking.\n\nIntimacy (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Patrice Chereau. With Kerry Fox, Mark Rylance, Timothy Spall, Clare Wayland. (119 min.)\n\nSterritt ** A man and woman meet every Wednesday in London for quick sessions of impersonal sex, and this murky drama explores the effects these escapades have on their otherwise separate lives. Based on fiction by Hanif Kureishi, the movie plays like a warmed-over \"Last Tango in Paris,\" with more explicit sex but a lower level of originality and acting skill.\n\nInvisible Circus (R)\n\nDirector: Adam Brooks. With Cameron Diaz, Jordana Brewster, Christopher Eccleston, Blythe Danner, Patrik Bergin. (112 min.)\n\nStaff ** This lightweight look at '70's activism has 18-year old Phoebe (Brewster) traveling across Europe in 1976 trying to unravel the mystery of the suicide of older sister Faith (Diaz) 6 years earlier. In flashback we see Faith's progress from non-violent protest to terrorism to guilt, as Phoebe has a gratuitous affair with Faith's ex-boyfriend. Blythe Danner shines in a small part as the young women's widowed mother, but the postcard pretty settings and an earnest young cast fail to overcome the detached storytelling - we just don't care about these people. La guerre est l'ennui. (After the film, the woman behind this reviewer woke her companion out of a deep sleep. When he came to, he said, \"that was good.\" He must have meant his nap.) By M.K. Terrell\n\nVS/N: 6 instances including 4 brief scenes of sex, 2 of them with nudity. VV: 6 scenes including a suicide. VP: 20 mostly harsh expressions. VD: 9 scenes with smoking, 6 scenes with drinking and 2 scenes with drugs.\n\nThe Iron Ladies (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Yongyoot Thongongtoon. With Sahapap Virakamin, Pormasith Siticharoengkul, Jojo Mioxshi, Jessadaporn Pholdee. (104 min.)\n\nSterritt *** A team of gay volleyball players gets a chance at fame when a more macho team stages a walkout because they don't like their female coach, and flamboyant history is made on Thailand's athletic scene. The subject is certainly offbeat, and the movie has enough color and spirit to make lively viewing, aside from the interest of seeing one of the most popular movies ever produced by Thailand's modest film industry.\n\nJabberwocky (PG)\n\nDirector: Terry Gilliam. With Michael Palin, Annette Badland, Max Wall. (105 min.)\n\nSterritt *** Palin, one of the most gifted members of England's fabled Monty Python comedy troupe, plays a mud-spattered medieval peasant whose life turns adventurous when a monster starts stalking the countryside. Gilliam's first solo flight as a director is more notable for its inspired visual ideas than for the frequency of its laughs, but Python devotees will have fun. First released in 1977.\n\nJackpot (R)\n\nDirector: Michael Polish. With Jon Gries, Daryl Hannah, Garrett Morris, Adam Baldwin. (96 min.)\n\nSterritt *** The adventures of a would-be country singer who makes up in tenacity - and obliviousness to his own lack of talent - what he lacks in musical gifts and upward mobility in what he finds to be a very ungenerous business. Gries and Morris act up a storm as the optimistically named Sunny Holiday and his long-suffering manager. Kudos also go to director Polish and his co-writer Mark Polish, who give the comedy-drama a bittersweet quirkiness that recalls their earlier and even better feature, \"Twin Falls Idaho.\"\n\nJay and Silent Bob Strike Back (R)\n\nDirector: Kevin Smith. With Kevin Smith, Jason Mewes, Shannon Elizabeth, Ben Affleck, Chris Rock, Jason Lee, Matt Damon. (99 min.)\n\nSterritt * The title characters have appeared regularly in Smith comedies like \"Dogma\" and \"Chasing Amy,\" and they take over the story here, traveling to Hollywood to register their protest that Miramax is making a movie about them without giving them a cut of the profits. There are enough four-letter words and smarmy sex gags to stock a dozen ordinary movies, but even fans of Jay and Silent Bob may find the story too slender and the jokes too repetitive to be much fun.\n\nJeepers Creepers (R)\n\nDirector: Victor Salva. With Gina Philips, Justin Long, Jonathan Breck, Eileen Breenan.\n\nStaff * Trish (Philips) and her brother, Darry (Long) are heading home from college. But this is no ordinary road trip. Instead of taking a shortcut, the siblings opt for the scenic route - on a never-ending country road. The first half is pretty intense, as Darry and his sister investigate an abandoned church. But then it just turns silly. They soon encounter a hideous and evil creature that's part bird, who likes to sniff laundry, spread his huge wings, and eat people. There's also a psychic who sings \"Jeepers creepers, where'd you get those peepers?\" Many scenes caused this reviewer to laugh out loud. The filmmakers seem to be making fun of the horror genre itself. By Lisa Leigh Parney\n\nVS/N: 1 scene of naked dead bodies. VV: 10, including bloody scenes of eating flesh, bodies torn apart, and head decapitations. VP: 40 expressions, sometimes harsh. VD: None.\n\nJin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Hiroyuki Okiura. With voices of Michael Dobson, Moneca Stori, Doug Abrahams, Colin Murdock. (102 min.)\n\nSterritt ** What if World War II had pitted Japan against Germany, and the Nazis had won? This offbeat animation in Japan's colorful \"anime\" style takes place a decade after such a conflict, depicting the sometimes violent adventures of a policeman and a young woman in a Tokyo torn by fighting between cultlike terrorists and high-tech security forces. The story's emphasis is on action, but there are some sensitive moments and interesting ideas along the way.\n\nJosie and the Pussycats (PG-13)\n\nDirectors: Deborah Kaplan, Harry Elfont. With Rachael Leigh Cook, Rosario Dawson, Tara Reid. (98 min.)\n\nSterritt *** Our heroines are wannabe rock stars who stumble on a scheme for selling pop-culture products through subliminal messages. The action is perky, but it's ironic that this satire of commercialism sets a record for product-placement plugs.\n\nJourney to the Sun (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Yesim Ustaoglu. With Newroz Baz, Nazmi Quirix, Mizgin Kapazan. (104 min.)\n\nSterritt *** Friendship arises between a young Turkish man and a Kurdish rebel, but their lives darken when the law-abiding Turk is mistaken for his companion and placed under surveillance by the authoritarian police. This is only Ustaoglu's second film, but smart performances and expressive camera work mark her as a talent to watch in the future. In Turkish with English subtitles\n\nJoy Ride (R)\n\nDirector: John Dahl. With Steve Zahn, Leelee Sobieski, Paul Walker, Walt Goggins. (97 min.)\n\nStaff ** A stylish but ultimately cheap thrill, \"Joy Ride\" is a skillful production in the service of nothing better than your average teen fright- flick experience. Two brothers play a practical joke on a truck driver, who turns out to be Freddy Kreuger on 10 wheels as he pursues his revenge to its noisy, gory conclusion (and, of course, beyond). Fasten your seat belts if you must take this ride, but as every patron of the teen genre knows, you're better off if you don't get in the car. By Gloria Goodale\n\nJuliet of the Spirits (No Rated)\n\nDirector: Federico Fellini. With Giuletta Masina, Mario Pisu, Valentina Cortese, Sandra Milo. (148 min.)\n\nSterritt **** A woman must come to terms with moral, personal, and domestic challenges posed by her husband's infidelity. Masina gives one of her most expressive performances in the rerelease of this 1965 masterpiece, which explores psychological and cinematic ideas first unveiled in Fellini's classic \"8 1/2,\" an even greater excursion into the borderline area where fantasy and reality intertwine.\n\nJump Tomorrow (PG)\n\nDirector: Joel Hopkins. With Tunde Adebimpe, Hippolyte Girardot, Natalie Verbeke, James Wilby. (97 min.)\n\nStaff ** Strait-laced George (Adebimpe), a Manhattan office worker from Nigeria, hopes to honor his departed parents and please an overbearing uncle by going through with an arranged marriage. En route to the ceremony, he encounters a suicidal Frenchman (Girardot) and a free-spirited Latina (Verbeke), whose passionate family threatens to set George's buttoned-down lifestyle on a new path. This feature film debut by writer-director Hopkins suffers a bit from its low budget, but its witty script and multicultural cast never fail to delight. By M.K. Terrell\n\nVS/N: 2 instances of mild innuendo; 1 scene of implied sex. VV: None. VP: 20 harsh expressions. VD: 4 scenes with alcohol.\n\nJurassic Park III (PG-13)\n\nDirector: Joe Johnston. With Sam Neill, William H. Macy, Téa Leoni, Alessandro Nivola, Laura Dern. (90 min.)\n\nSterritt ** After their 14-year-old son disappears into an island jungle inhabited by Jurassic Park's prehistoric critters, an unhappy couple shanghais mild-mannered paleontologist Alan Grant into helping their rescue effort. The cast is solid, and the special effects are as impressive as executive producer Steven Spielberg's bottomless resources can make them. But the screenplay is so stale that even fans of the previous \"Jurassic\" installments might think this is one clone too many.\n\nStaff *1/2 Poorly paced, summer fun, empty theme park ride, blessedly short.\n\nVS/N: None. VV: 11 scenes of dinosaur attacks. VP: 5 mild instances. VD: 1 scene with drinking.\n\nJust Visiting (PG-13)\n\nDirector: Jean Marie-Poiré. With Jean Reno, Christian Clavier, Christina Applegate, Malcolm McDowell. (93 min.)\n\nStaff **1/2 A faulty potion sends a 13th-century French knight and his valet down \"the tunnels of time\" to wake up in a Chicago museum, touching off a romp through the city. The wizard (McDowell), realizing his mistake, comes after them, adding to the confusion. Director Poiré's English-language remake of his 1993 French hit brings back original stars Reno and Clavier. Not a great film, but high energy, good clean fun, and dumb humor keeps you laughing. By M.K. Terrell\n\nK-PAX (PG-13)\n\nDirector: Iain Softley. With Kevin Spacey, Jeff Bridges, Alfre Woodard, Mary McCormack. (120 min.)\n\nSterritt * Spacey plays Prot, an amiable oddball who claims to be from a planet called K-PAX and is promptly whisked off to a mental hospital. There, he helps other patients - he's the Patch Adams of the extraterrestrial set-until psychiatrist Bridges uses hypnosis and sleuthing to investigate his life and uncover his past. The story acknowledges suffering and grief, but the filmmakers soften every hard fact with slick camera work, silky-smooth editing, and syrupy music. The result is exactly the kind of starry-eyed escapist fantasy that Prot is suspected of having. There's a difference between movies that lift our thoughts and movies that put our heads in the clouds.\n\nStaff **1/22 Lacks courage, confused, puts a smile on your face, intriguing.\n\nVS/N: 1 scene with slight nudity. VV: 2 scenes, including a mugging. VP: 1 expression. VD: 3 scenes with alcohol, some scenes with prescription drugs.\n\nKeep Up Your Right (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Jean-Luc Godard. With Jean-Luc Godard, Jane Birkin, Jacques Villeret. (82 min.)\n\nSterritt *** This minor work by a major filmmaker tells three intertwined stories about a rock-music band, an eccentric worker, and a suicidal airplane pilot with a group of very worried passengers. Godard lends the comedy-drama an extra measure of offbeat charm with his own appearance as a sort of cinematic court jester, and the film's images grow more radiantly beautiful as it goes along. Everyday moviegoers may find its complicated structure more impenetrable than enticing, though. Made in 1987 and originally called \"Soigne ta droite.\" In French with English subtitles\n\nKill by Inches (Not rated)\n\nDirectors: Diane Doniol-Valcroze, Arthur Flam. With Emmanuel Salinger, Christopher Zach. (85 min.)\n\nSterritt * Fascinated by women and the art of measuring them for clothes, a troubled young tailor escalates from bizarre behavior to outright murder. This dark psychological story falls short in terms of filmmaking and acting, but it's original enough to stand out from the crowd.\n\nThe King Is Alive (R)\n\nDirector: Kristian Levring. With Jennifer Jason Leigh, Bruce Davison, Janet McTeer, Miles Anderson. (118 min.)\n\nSterritt ***\n\nStruggling with loneliness and anxiety while waiting to be rescued from the African desert where their bus has broken down, a group of very different people decide to while away the time with a bare-bones staging of \"King Lear,\" which stirs up more passions and apprehensions than expected. Levring was a founder of Denmark's innovative Dogma 95 movement, which tries to bring filmmaking back to its roots by forbidding artificial or extraneous effects. This unconventional character study is distinguished less by its elements of melodrama and psychodrama than by its intense acting and the vivid immediacy of Levring's powerful imagery.\n\nKiss of the Dragon (R)\n\nDirector: Chris Nahon. With Jet Li, Bridget Fonda, Tchéky Karyo, Burt Kwouk. (100 min.)\n\nStaff ** Don't go to this martial arts movie expecting \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.\" There's none of that movie's nuanced acting or genteel violence on display in this tale about a Chinese policeman (Li) framed for murder while on assignment in Paris. Stylish production values and inventive choreography fail to paper up the cavernous cracks in the story, but Li's karate chops are impressive as he somehow takes on more bad guys than Rambo did in three movies. By Stephen Humphries\n\nVS/N: 4 scenes of implied sex. VV: 79 scenes, extremely violent. VP: 48 harsh expressions. VD: 4 scenes with smoking, 4 scenes with drinking, 2 scenes with drugtaking of cocaine and heroin.\n\nA Knight's Tale (PG-13)\n\nDirector: Brian Helgeland. With Heath Ledger, Mark Addy, Alan Tudyk, Paul Bettany. (132 min.)\n\nStaff **1/2\n\n\"A Knight's Tale\" is a familiar story in which a kid from the wrong side of town (Ledger) makes his dream of becoming a knight a reality by posing as royalty. Trained as a child by the best knight in England, the only thing holding him back from rivaling the best competitors from Europe - and winning the heart of a beautiful princess - is his status in society. This quest for personal triumph is accompanied by a surprising array of classic rock-music favorites and other light-hearted comic relief. It's good family entertainment, but the jousting is bloody and violent. By Heidi Wilson\n\nStaff **1/2 Gorgeous costumes, Not quite Shakespeare, alarming at times.\n\nVS/N: 2 scenes of partial male nudity. VV: 28 scenes, but no blood or gore. VP: 14 mild expressions. VD: 2 scenes with drinking.\n\nThe Last Castle (R)\n\nDirector: Rod Lurie. With Robert Redford, James Gandolfini, Mark Ruffalo, Delroy Lindo. (120 min.)\n\nStaff ** In his follow-up to \"The Contender,\" former film critic-turned-director Rod Lurie seems to be trying to create a prison drama that recalls \"The Shawshank Redemption\" and \"The Great Escape.\" The prisoners this time are soldiers, including a legendary three-star general (Redford), serving a 10-year sentence. He soon finds himself rallying the men to oppose a ruthless colonel who runs the military prison. The film is often entertaining, but it's hampered by an unmerited sense of self-importance, too-obvious gestures, and ludicrous plot holes. By Stephen Humphries\n\nThe Last Wave (Not rated)\n\nDirector: Peter Weir. With Richard Chamberlain, David Gulpilil, Olivia\n\nHamnett. (106 min.)\n\nSterritt **** A corporate lawyer in Sydney, Australia, agrees to defend a group of Aboriginal men against a murder charge, only to find that his clients are reluctant to discuss some aspects of their lives. Probing deeper, he learns that tribal mysteries aren't as absent from the modern Australian city as he thought, and before long his findings take on increasingly apocalyptic implications. Weir had a truly magical touch in early films like this 1977 masterpiece, which offers a transfixing excursion into the \"dream time\" of Australian myth.\n\nLegally Blonde (PG-13)\n\nDirector: Robert Luketic. With Reese Witherspoon, Luke Wilson, Selma Blair, Victor Garber. (94 min.)\n\nSterritt ** When her boyfriend proposes breaking up instead of getting married, a ditsy sorority girl follows him to Harvard Law School and continues her courtship on his own turf. How does she get into such a prestigious institution? This doesn't make much sense, even by the movie's own sitcom logic, but part of the answer is a videotaped application essay featuring our heroine in a bikini - a good example of what the movie as a whole is like. Witherspoon fills the screen with bright-eyed bounce. The rest of the cast is as forgettable as the flimsy story.\n\nStaff **1/2 Light-hearted, perky, delightful.\n\nVS/N: None. VV: None. VP: 15 mild expressions. VD: 4 scenes with alcohol.\n\nL.I.E. (NC-17)\n\nDirector: Michael Cuesta. With Brian Cox, Paul Franklin Dano, Bruce Altman, Billy Kay. (100 min.)\n\nSterritt ** Living with his self-absorbed father after his mother's death on the Long Island Expressway, a 15-year-old boy gets involved with troublemaking friends and then becomes the prey of an aging pedophile who lives undetected in their town. The subject matter is deeply troubling, and the treatment "
