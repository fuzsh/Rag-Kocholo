        "text": "McCool takes the Falcones to Cuba on vacation. Jimmy hates it for being a 'Communist hell-hole', but cheers up when he discovers that killing Castro can get him 'Super-Made\" and land him back on top in New York. Jimmy, Cheech, and Gina try to assassinate Castro, while Cookie and Theresa try to find a mythical Blue Scorpion to cure Petey's dysentery.\n\nJimmy calls Cheech a 'Bum\", doing the worst thing one goodfella can do to another: telling him the truth about himself. Cheech decides to run for Mayor of Regina to prove he's not a bum. Meanwhile, Theresa becomes an anti-vaccination proponent and ends up teaching Gina's 3rd-grade class.\n\nWhen Cookie finds a photo album of Jimmy's gumars (girlfriends) from the old life (Cheech's fault), Jimmy takes her away for a romantic weekend and they wind up at a swinger's convention (again, Cheech's fault).\n\nThrough a misunderstanding, Cookie starts to think Petey is gay. She does her best to support him but is shocked when it turns out he's not gay, he's into LARP (Live Action Role Playing).\n\nJimmy convinces Regina Tourism to open a casino. He winds up being a big casino boss but gets into a rivalry with Cookie when she gets hired to run the native casino.\n\nJimmy and Petey go on a hunting trip and come home with a Sasquatch (Dave Foley). Jimmy learns how hard McCool's job is when he has to babysit the Bigfoot.\n\nWhen Cookie gets baby fever and wants another kid, Jimmy refuses to sleep with her. Problem is, he \"Feels the need\" but can't find a place to \"empty the tanks\".\n\nWhen Jimmy sees a seemingly compromising picture of McCool with Theresa (it's totally innocent), he ruins McCool's life and gets him kicked off the force.\n\nJimmy's new neighbor turns out to be a Quebec biker who's also in witness protection. Jimmy is banned from associating with him, but then realizes his new pal is about to commit a heist\n\nHorse gets Jimmy and Cheech's new racehorse pregnant so they sue McCool. In order to pay the boys back, McCool must track down his deadbeat dad, Staunch McCool.\n\nWhen Cookie discovers that Jimmy was engaged to someone else when he met her, but never mentioned it, she moves out."
