She then landed roles in \"Dr. T & the Women,\" \"Josie and the Pussycats\" and \"My Boss's Daughter,\" portrayed Danni Sullivan on \"Scrubs\" and starred on the MTV reality show \"Taradise.\" After that, she transitioned to primarily B-movies as her reputation as a party girl began to overshadow her career (there were also stints in rehab and botched experiences with plastic surgery). The former \"It\" girl, who ended her engagement to Carson Daly in 2001, has headlined the \"Sharknado\" franchise — but not much else — since 2013. (She's also reportedly had flings with Devon Sawa, Fred Durst, Tom Brady and many party boys of the aughts.) In 2011, she concocted a fake marriage to a Bulgarian financier, and in 2016, she faked a relationship with Dean May so that they could appear on VH1's \"Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars.\" In September 2017, the New York Post reported that Tara was casually dating tech entrepreneur Ted Dhanik.\n\nPhilip Seymour Hoffman portrayed Brandt, The Big Lebowski's uptight assistant.\n\nPhilip Seymour Hoffman went on to win an Emmy in 2005 for his work on the miniseries \"Empire Falls.\" The following year, he won an Oscar and a Golden Globe for his performance in \"Capote.\" He then earned Academy Award and Globe nominations for \"Charlie Wilson's War,\" \"Doubt\" and \"The Master.\" His other greatest hits include \"Patch Adams,\" \"Magnolia,\" \"The Talented Mr. Ripley,\" \"Almost Famous,\" \"Red Dragon,\" \"Cold Mountain,\" \"Mission: Impossible II,\" \"Moneyball\" and the \"Hunger Games\" franchise, which he was midway through filming when he died of an accidental drug overdose at the age of 46 in 2014.

(He also directed and starred in the 2010 movie \"Jack Goes Boating.\") He met costume designer Mimi O'Donnell while they were working together on a play he directed in 1999.

He's also been surprisingly active as an actor over the years, appearing in films like the 1998 \"Psycho\" remake, the 2014 Joe Albany biopic \"Low Down,\" which he also executive produced, and \"Baby Driver.\" Additionally, he voiced characters on \"The Wild Thornberrys\" from 1998 to 2004 and had a role as a voice actor in \"Inside Out.\" In 2005, Flea and model Frankie Rayder welcomed a daughter, Sunny. He also has an adult daughter, drummer-photographer Clara Balzary, from his first marriage.

Mark reportedly married actress-director Tracy Aziz Pellegrino in 2008. His \"The Big Lebowski\" cohort Philip Moon, who isn't active on social media and hasn't been photographed at a Hollywood event in more than a decade, has worked less frequently over the years. He's best known for a six-episode stint as Lee on \"Deadwood\" in 2005. He also popped up on a 2015 episode of \"True Detective.\""
