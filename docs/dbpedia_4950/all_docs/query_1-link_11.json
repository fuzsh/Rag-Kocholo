        "text": "(Photo by Paramount/courtesy Everett Collection)\n\nAll Michael Douglas Movies Ranked\n\nThree ways to start a movie star career: Have a famous actor father, produce a Best Picture winner, or be in a hit TV series for a while before making the leap. Uh, check, check, and check for Michael Douglas, son of Kirk, producer of One Flew Over a Cuckoo’s Nest, and star of early ’70s procedural The Streets of San Francisco.\n\nSo by the time San Francisco ended in ’77, Douglas was ready to get plastered all over the silver screen, starring in Michael Crichton’s Coma. He put out a few more like-minded high-stakes adult thrillers (The China Syndrome, The Star Chamber) before being made as an ’80s man with Romancing the Stone. The cheeky globe-trotting adventure film, directed by Robert Zemeckis and co-starring Kathleen Turner, turned him into a sex symbol, with all the women (Fatal Attraction), money (Wall Street, a Best Actor Oscar winner), and power (Black Rain) that implies.\n\nIt all came to a head in the ’90s with the supremely watchable sleaze that is Basic Instinct, which left mouths wide open, among other things. Other movies of the decade, like Falling Down and David Fincher’s The Game, are still watched today, especially for their exploration of broken-down masculinity and power.\n\nDouglas got another taste of Best Picture gold with 2000’s Traffic (nominated, but struck down by Gladiator). This marked Douglas’ first collaboration with director Steven Soderbergh: The two would reunite for Haywire and Behind the Candelabra. He was brought into the Marvel Cinematic Universe as the famous Dr. Hank Pym for Ant-Man, a role he reprised for the Wasp and Quantumania sequels. Now, we’re ranking all Michael Douglas movies by Tomatometer! —Alex Vo\n\n#1\n\nBehind the Candelabra (2013) 94%\n\n#1\n\nAdjusted Score: 98432%\n\nCritics Consensus: Affectionate without sacrificing honesty, Behind the Candelabra couples award-worthy performances from Michael Douglas and Matt Damon with some typically sharp direction from Steven Soderbergh.\n\nSynopsis: World-famous pianist Liberace (Michael Douglas) takes much-younger Scott Thorson (Matt Damon) as a lover, but the relationship deteriorates when Liberace... [More]\n\nDirected By: Steven Soderbergh\n\n#2\n\nTraffic (2000) 93%\n\n#2\n\nAdjusted Score: 102211%\n\nCritics Consensus: Soderbergh successfully pulls off the highly ambitious Traffic, a movie with three different stories and a very large cast. The issues of ethics are gray rather than black-and-white, with no clear-cut good guys. Terrific acting all around.\n\nSynopsis: A contemporary thriller set in the world of drug trafficking. Traffic evokes the high stakes and high risks of the...

[More]\n\nDirected By: Rob Reiner\n\n#4\n\nThe China Syndrome (1979) 88%\n\n#4\n\nAdjusted Score: 91526%\n\nCritics Consensus: With gripping themes and a stellar cast, The China Syndrome is the rare thriller that's as thought-provoking as it is tense.\n\nSynopsis: A news reporter (Jane Fonda) and her cameraman (Michael Douglas) are unintentional witnesses to a SCRAM incident, an emergency core... [More]\n\nDirected By: James Bridges\n\n#5\n\nAnt-Man and The Wasp (2018) 87%\n\n#5\n\nAdjusted Score: 112184%\n\nCritics Consensus: A lighter, brighter superhero movie powered by the effortless charisma of Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly, Ant-Man and The Wasp offers a much-needed MCU palate cleanser.\n\nSynopsis: Scott Lang is grappling with the consequences of his choices as both a superhero and a father. Approached by Hope... [More]\n\nDirected By: Peyton Reed\n\n#6\n\nRomancing the Stone (1984) 86%\n\n#6\n\nAdjusted Score: 90858%\n\nCritics Consensus: Romancing the Stone reaches back to the classic Saturday morning serials of old with an action-filled adventure enlivened by the sparkling chemistry between its well-matched leads.\n\nSynopsis: A dowdy romantic-adventure writer is hurled into a real-life adventure in the Colombian jungle in order to save her sister,... [More]\n\nDirected By: Robert Zemeckis\n\n#7\n\n#7\n\nAdjusted Score: 86268%\n\nCritics Consensus: The War of the Roses is a black comedy made even funnier by hanging onto its caustic convictions -- and further distinguished by Danny DeVito's stylish direction.\n\nSynopsis: After 17 years of marriage, Barbara (Kathleen Turner) and Oliver Rose (Michael Douglas) want out. The trouble is, neither one... [More]\n\nDirected By: Danny DeVito\n\n#8\n\nAnt-Man (2015) 83%\n\n#8\n\nAdjusted Score: 99818%\n\nCritics Consensus: Led by a charming performance from Paul Rudd, Ant-Man offers Marvel thrills on an appropriately smaller scale -- albeit not as smoothly as its most successful predecessors.\n\nSynopsis: Forced out of his own company by former protégé Darren Cross, Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) recruits the talents of... [More]\n\nDirected By: Peyton Reed\n\n#9\n\nJohn Grisham's The Rainmaker (1997) 81%\n\n#9\n\nAdjusted Score: 84571%\n\nCritics Consensus: Invigorated by its talented cast and Francis Ford Coppola's strong direction, The Rainmaker is a satisfying legal drama -- and arguably the best of Hollywood's many John Grisham adaptations.\n\nSynopsis: Struggling new attorney Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon) resorts to working for a shady lawyer (Mickey Rourke), where he meets paralegal... [More]\n\nDirected By: Francis Ford Coppola\n\n#10\n\nWonder Boys (2000) 81%\n\n#10\n\nAdjusted Score: 85841%\n\nCritics Consensus: Michael Douglas and Tobey Maguire do wonders in this clever dark comedy.\n\nSynopsis: Grady (Michael Douglas) is a 50-ish English professor who hasn't had a thing published in years -- not since he...
