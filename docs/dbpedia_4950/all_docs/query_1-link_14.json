        "text": "7A WF 83429\n\nAs the White House reels from the kidnapping of Zoey (recurring guest star Elisabeth Moss), the youngest daughter of Democratic U.S. President Josiah Edward Bartlet (series star Martin Sheen), the government is temporarily passed from the distraught Bartlet to the Republican party--specifically Speaker of the House Glenallen Walken (recurring guest star John Goodman - \"Roseanne,\" \"Barton Fink\")--due to the prior resignation of Bartlet's Vice President. First Lady Dr. Abigail \"Abbey\" Bartlet (series star Stockard Channing) staunchly supports her husband, but the trauma of potentially losing their child forces her to confront Bartlet with the harrowing notion that the crisis was the direct result of the assassination of a dangerous foreign official he ordered months ago. As always, professorial Chief of Staff Leo McGarry (series star John Spencer) serves as Bartlet's political and emotional buttress. Ever present is highly regarded Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Lyman (series star Bradley Whirford), whose capable assistant, Donna Moss (series star Janel Moloney), keeps him grounded. Press Secretary C.J. Cregg (series star Allison Janney) remains cool and competent in the media briefing room, and rumpled Communications Director Toby Ziegler (series star Richard Schiff), focuses on the emergency, even as he quietly celebrates the birth of his twins.\n\nThe Dogs of War\n\nThe international crisis concerning the terrorist abduction of Bartlet's daughter Zoey reaches a critical point as Speaker of the House Glenallen Walken (recurring guest star John Goodman), the acting President, orders the bombardment of Qumari terrorist camps. The kidnappers issue a 24-hour deadline for the removal of American troops from Qumar. Meanwhile, Josh fumes over his perceived notion that the Republicans will exploit and push forward their own legislative agenda. And Toby visits his newborn twins--even as he oversees the drafting of two presidential speeches that hinge on Zoey's fate.\n\nThe Stormy Present\n\nWhen a former President of the United States dies, the two remaining ex-Presidents fly on Air Force One with Bartlet to attend the funeral. Onboard, Bartlet's two historic guests partake in a lively debate about their administrations. Their past mistakes haunt the current administration including a recent event--protestors have surrounded a Saudi Oil headquarters, taking 200 hostages, including 50 Americans. Meanwhile, C.J. investigates government experiments on mind control. Leo discovers his ex-wife is engaged to be married. And Josh referees a debate concerning an original copy of the Bill of Rights. Acclaimed novelist John Sacret Young wrote the teleplay."
