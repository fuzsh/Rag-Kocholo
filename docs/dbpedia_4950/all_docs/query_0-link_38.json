        "text": "What kind of changes have you noticed over the last 20 years or so?\n\nWell, it's hard to remember, to think back. But when I was finishing \"China Syndrome\" in 1978, I remember me and this lawyer coming out, because there was this thing called video. And I know its hard to realize that video is only 20, 21, 22 years old. So the ancillary markets dramatically increases with the video. And then you had your television sales, your satellite, your pay-per-view, your airplanes. And then your foreign market dramatically has increased in the number of theaters. The world's opened up for films.\n\nIt was a very profitable business 20 years ago, and everybody loved it. Since that time, the escalations of the budgets of movies, the escalation of marketing costs, I think has been the most dramatic change, and the lack of any esprit de corps of an industry. There used to be, and still is, the Motion Picture Association of America, which is sort of like the studios' lobbyist group, which was all pretty tight.\n\nNow you've got a bunch of huge multinational corporations trying to cannibalize each other to a fair degree in the movie business. You know, you have to have your movie open on the opening weekend. A picture like \"Cuckoo's Nest,\" could play for week after week with only maybe a 7 percent drop, as opposed to some of the dramatic drops that are now. So it's much more a business.\n\nIt was always a struggle between art and commerce. And now, I think, commerce is winning out, big time. We're seeing a dramatic reduction in producers associated with studios. Just today there was in the papers a list, my company included, of the huge number of very prestigious production companies that are not associated with studios directly now. So you're seeing a quarterly profits mentality creeping in, more and more. There's talk of this vertical integration -- acquisitions of all different types of companies under one umbrella. It's a much riskier business now, and so big business is trying to make it much more cost-efficient. We'll see.\n\nSo it's riskier because of how expensive films have gotten?\n\nIt's riskier in how expensive films have gotten. Television is not an automatic buy. ... The number of films has increased to a fair degree. ... Marketing costs are staggering in terms of what you try for that opening weekend. And that sort of was initiated by, I think, Disney Studios maybe, maybe about ten years ago. ... They basically, almost overnight, tripled the size of their marketing budgets and had some success, and the other studios followed. ...\n\nAs a result, you're seeing many, many of the studios that are laying off their costs. The studios basically, besides developing some material, their strength is distribution. Distribution in any other business is a cost that you incur. You know, in a trucking business, you eat it. In a film business, distribution is a profit center. And so that's what they can control, so now the studios are laying more and more of their budgetary, the risky financial costs of making the movies, on outside sources. ...\n\nWhy do you think there's this big focus on the opening weekend?\n\nBecause there's no time now for a movie to breathe. Because by the next weekend, there are three, four, five other pictures coming in, each, maybe, who spent an average of maybe $25 million for their marketing alone. So you don't have a chance to find your legs. There used to be something called word of mouth, which would allow a picture to be discovered. And you'd go, \"Wow, I'm going to see that.\" There's so much now. And then you combine that with the incredible number of magazines that are out there. There's a large, large amount of media, all the way across the board, to divert our attentions from movies, whether it's cable, Internet, video games. So our attention span isn't that large anymore.\n\nMy mother knows when a film opens in the top five. Did being crazy about the numbers spread to the audience, too?\n\nWell, that's another phenomenon. I mean, I find it very bizarre. You look at most of these companies now, these multinational companies, be they Japanese, or French, Canadian, Australian, English, whatever they might be, some American. The motion picture business, in most cases, represents maybe 3 percent to 5 percent of the gross earnings of these companies. It's nothing. Nothing. Yet it's the locomotive for this whole company.\n\nAnd they take pride [in] these statistics that have come out, which is all part of the Top 50 lists. You know, every magazine's got the 10 most beautiful, the 10 richest -- it's become a popular device. And the top performing pictures has become an instrumental part and is crucial. They build their marketing campaigns off of it, and they build a lot of their financing for their future projects off their performance, that first week performance.\n\nIn your career, you've done a pretty good job of blending big splashy pictures with small and interesting pictures. How do you approach getting something special made?\n\nWell, I try to mix it up. I care about all the pictures I do. But I try to be aware when I think I'm getting a little too esoteric. After a while, I think maybe it might be time to find something a little more commercial. I'm aware of it. I am aware of my résumé. I'm aware of what I've done lately or what I want to mix up. And I take that into the equation with what really means a lot and is more difficult to be made.\n\nBut mind you, most of the movies that I've done -- and really I just got early confidence because after \"Cuckoo's Nest,\" which is my first producing picture, which was rejected by every studio, and then to go do \"The China Syndrome,\" which had a very tough time getting made. [I] joined forces with Jane Fonda on that. Then it was \"Romancing the Stone.\" And these are three successes where people have spit in your face and told you you're an idiot. And they [the movies] succeeded.\n\nSo that gave me the confidence to be able to fight back a little bit, or to take a punch, to take a hit when they rejected you and say, \"Oh, well, you know, I'm sure you know.\" And then pictures like \"Fatal Attraction,\" which they didn't want to make. That was a difficult picture to make. \"Falling Down,\" one of my favorites. So I've had a long list of pictures throughout my career that have still been very hard to get made.\n\nYou kind of raise a paradox -- a bunch of pictures that they didn't want to make that did well. Is there a danger of these big companies being so careful and depending so much on marketing to determine what they make?\n\nWell, I would like to say yes, but maybe it's the time now. I kind of feel like we're in the 1950s a little bit. It feels sometimes a little bit like after Eisenhower and Hula Hoops. ... I think you're seeing a younger generation who's got a good shit detector ... and likes not to think they're being fed by the Man. But in general, it's kind of a silly time. No one wants to think a whole lot. ...\n\nWithout sounding like an old curmudgeon, there's a few pictures I see out there. I look at the business they do, and I go look at the movie, and I shake my head and I say, \"Man, I feel out of it. I really feel out of it. I don't get this.\"... But we'll see. It's going to be an interesting time. I think it's a very exciting time, and I feel a little bit like you mentioned the 1970s, I think we're going to see a revolt in terms of independents, strong independent directors. This is not a time for producers. It's a very good time for directors. Studios are thinking they can bypass producers, for the most part. And I think you're going to see possibly a chance for the creation of what United Artists, for instance, used to be like, when it was all about some strong independent talent makers getting together, exclusively, who have their own financing available. Because there's a lot of people out there who would back some responsible filmmakers in creating another alternative, somewhat in the way that DreamWorks did, maybe in a smaller form.\n\nHaving the history that you do, what's the most distressing change you've seen in the studios?\n\nThe most distressing change? Well, the toughest thing I'm seeing is, which I hate, is coverage. I'm seeing less and less people being willing to step out. I see the responsibility of a producer being passed down to developments and readers. No one wants to assume the responsibility of developing the material like they did, somewhat, in the old days. And I see these readers' reports and material and it's like they've all been reading each other's reports. And it's a sort of homogenized version of -- God forbid you really step out and say something about the material, you might get slapped. It's been a little bit debilitating.\n\nIf you can just be an audience member for a minute... What do you think the takeover of these companies has meant for the kind of shows we see?\n\nI don't think we've seen the result yet. ... I hope we don't lose the passion, [that] the filmmakers keep their passion. And that scares me the most, in terms of testing and the marketing campaigns and scores -- that it just becomes so homogenized, that we lose our voices.\n\nBut saying that, I'm actually very optimistic about the independent world. Digital cameras have allowed an ability for so many more people to find out about their own filmmaking capabilities. And I think we're just less than a decade away from a digital world, which is going to open up a lot of opportunities, the least of which is going to be distribution, because there won't be all those big film cans being passed around.\n\nIf you were making this show, what do you think would be important for us to talk about?\n\nAh, very, very good question. Well, I guess the point is there's a reason why you're making this show. In other words, something is troublesome, or people aren't aware what's going on. And I think there's been a dramatic change in our industry in the last few years. It remains to be seen. Maybe this'll be the advent of a rebirth of European filmmaking. ... We'll see. But I think it's worth exploring that area.\n\nAnd basically, the globalization of entertainment in general... I mean, there's another company out there, who, if they have their way, will have a worldwide satellite network. And there's issues of anti-trust, I have to believe. And I think they're going to start popping up their ugly head pretty soon.\n\nHow is globalization affecting the way people approach making films?\n\nWe've become a much smaller world because of MTV, for one. You go around the world now, kids look the same. They all look the same, because they're looking at MTV, and whether we like it or not, our culture is our biggest export -- that being the entertainment business. It used to be the airline business, but now our largest export surplus is the entertainment business. And that is going into every nook and cranny, combining that with the Internet. So I don't know the end result. I didn't take any classes in economics. But it will be interesting to see how this all plays out. ...\n\nWhat keeps you excited?\n\nA good script, a good story. I've been in developmental hell for a couple of years now. And I think everybody just goes through it just trying to find good material. That's another area that is of some concern -- writers -- and the amount of assignments that they're taking on and overlapping. It's hard to know when they're really being honest with you, when they're really being passionate. They've become pretty good actors themselves. A lot of the salaries -- I'm not one to complain about my salaries -- but writers' salaries have dramatically increased. ...\n\nHas it changed your strategy as a producer at all, or are you still looking for what excites you the most?\n\nI have to trust my instincts -- they've gotten me this far. I work on projects that I like, because that's the only way to keep my energy going. If I try to satisfy somebody else, it won't last that long. That said, I've had a few curves thrown at me in the last few years, about marketing and marketing campaigns, and I'm nervous about it. I find this whole area a little more uncomfortable, because there is no time. If you like to make quirky pictures or a little off-center, like I do, there is no time for an audience to find a movie. And then if you make a quirky picture, they're not the easiest to market.\n\nSo I don't think I've changed, although I'm sort of going full circle back to independence and a more autonomous route. I'm looking for outside financing. I've decided, in my own philosophy, that I should be responsible for the development of the material. The material is still the soul of this business. It's the heart of this business. This is what brings everybody together, that piece of material, the director and everything else. And after that, then you go after trying to find your talent, be it director or actors.\n\nDid it seem that when you were starting and guys like DeNiro, Nicholson, those kind of guys, that they were supported by a bunch of small pictures that allowed them to grow as an actor? Do you worry about that?\n\nWell, a little bit. The big difference I remember is that the transition from television to feature films back then was very hard. You had a couple of... Clint Eastwood and Steve McQueen were a couple of people who had done television series and then came over. In my generation, there weren't many that were able to come over from television. Now, given this vertical integration, the sooner they can find anybody who's hot off a series, they're trying to get them in pictures.\n\nAnd the truth is we have yet, especially among the actors ... we have yet to have our new stars. There's a lot of promotion for a lot of people, but short of Tom Cruise, who now is 38, 39 years old, I don't know. There's a lot of names being bandied around, but there isn't anybody yet who's really kind of risen up, who's shown they've got the chops to carry a career for more than two, three, four years. So we'll see what happens.\n\nDo you think the opportunities are still there to develop your chops, or do you think it's a little harder?\n\nIt depends where your heart is. The whole thing is if you want to be a movie star, or you just want to be a better actor. I always say to people, if you want to be just a movie star, then the odds aren't good. If you love acting and sort of work at it and develop it, you at least have a good time along the way. And then maybe something really great will happen for you that'll surprise you.\n\nhome · introduction · what's wrong with this picture · indies are dead...\n\ndreaming in broadband · anatomy of a monster\n\ninterviews · links & readings · discussion · video excerpts\n\npress reaction · tapes & transcripts · privacy policy · credits\n\nfrontline · wgbh · pbs online"
