It had its good and its bad sides, it was definitely a challenge to get up every morning and feel confident enough to walk around in all the clothes but it was amazing for me to see that I could pull all that stuff out of myself because I am so different from that character but it was great fun to get to play that you know.\"\n\nEmbargoed: 3rd May 2001 13:00\n\nKeywords:\n\nLocation: LONDON, ENGLAND, UNITED KINGDOM\n\nCountry: United Kingdom\n\nTopics: General\n\nReuters ID: LVA55GPUBUHLPUSFDW0RW2W7TR4A\n\nStory Text: Liv Tyler - daughter of Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler attended the world premiere of her latest movie ' One Night at McCool's in London last night. ' One Night at McCool's sees the beautiful Liv as manipulative 'devil' breaking the hearts of no more than four men: Matt Dillon, Paul Reiser, John Goodman and Michael Douglas. Also attending the premiere were top model Kate Moss and Christina Ricci.\n\nIt all starts one night at Mc Cool's...three unsuspecting men and one woman with a dream are brought together by lust, mayhem, bingo, DVDs, and the finer points of home decorating.\n\n\"One night at McCool's\" is a sexy, rapid-fire black comedy produced by Michael Douglas.\n\nThe movie stars Douglas himself, Matt Dillon, John Goodman, and Paul Reiser, as four men hopelessly in love with one woman - Jewel, played by Liv Tyler.\n\nJewel's become all the men could think of...but her dream is bigger than that.\n\nTyler says \"She's a bit of a monster. her main goal is that she wants a house, she has this idea, this perfection and something that'll make her feel completely happy and she goes after that dream and she'll really do anything she can to get to that point and she's incredibly manipulative but I feel she believes her manipulation and the things she says, she believes them completely.\"\n\nMatt Dillon plays bartender Randy who finds Jewel move into his house and gets his share of the lovely lady's contribution of sex and violence to his otherwise fairly uneventful life.\n\n\"I play Randy who happens to meet this girl who turns his whole life around and he's basically not a very ambitious guy. A guy who's probably very happy go lucky in his life. He happens to meet who turns out to be the wrong girl\", says Dillon.\n\nWhen Randy realizes she is the wrong girl, he decides to get rid of her once and for all - and hires a very 'distinguished' looking Michael Douglas to do the job.\n\n\"It's character work which is a lot of fun so I got some teeth made up that create a slight difference and did some hairwork and wardrobe stuff and just to give me a chance to have some fun. Play something a little different and it turned out really well, I think it kind of made a few people close to me very uncomfortable\", says Douglas.\n\n\"One night at McCool's\" opens in cinemas across the UK on Friday, April 20.\n\nENDS\n\nCopyright Holder: REUTERS\n\nCopyright Notice: (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2014.
