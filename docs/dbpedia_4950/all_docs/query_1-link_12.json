I have this tidbit.\n\nFrom TOMORROW'S People, a small blurb concerning Liv Tyler's latest flick, 'One Night at McCool's'.\n\nFast Takes: The film editors of 'One Night at McCool's', a dark comedy starring Liv Tyler, got a laugh while looking at the dailies. At one point during a lust scene with Paul Reiser, Tyler, as a dominatrix, was supposed to hit a pillow with her whip. She missed the pillow but not Reiser, who yelped very believably.\n\nThat is hilarious, Paul, I hope you're feeling better. I remember Liv telling this tale to Leno when she was on last week.\n\nIf is obscure, and no one else has it? We certainly will! Do you have something about the confirmed cast? Send it to me! Xoanon@theonering.net\n\nThanks to Tinuviel for the tip!\n\nThere's Something about Viggo\n\n10/14/99, 4:57 pm EST - Xoanon\n\nOk, So we have a casting change. Big deal, I mean I liked Stuart, I really did. I remember when the GODS came from up on high and told me the name 'Stuart'. I was very excited. But these things happen.\n\nDo you remember the Emperor from 'The Empire Strikes Back'? It's a different dude than 'Return of the Jedi' and 'The Phantom Menace'.\n\nAnd Captain Janeway from 'Star Trek: Voyager'? A few weeks into filming there was another woman who was captain of Voyage (A montrealer, from my home town!) who was axed.\n\nThere many other examples of major cast changes in movies and television. These things happen. Think of it this way, Stuart was down there with the other Hobbit actors, and they didn't get on, or maybe it was PJ and Stuart, who knows? But in an 18 month long shoot, that's year and a half folks, do you think PJ would want someone who is causing stress to the rest of the cast or crew? or Himself? no way. Thus the descision was made.\n\nI'm not going to comment on Stuart vs. Viggo, but I do hope that this change was for the best. Good luck viggo, if you indeed do sign the dotted line.\n\nAs for Stewart, we all wish you the best. :)\n\nXoanon\n\nMore on Townsends Departure\n\n10/14/99, 2:24 pm EST - Xoanon\n\nFrom: Buzz\n\nBuzz is the Super Ringer Spy who brought me the news about Stuarts departure. Where is more of what he has to say:\n\nThis is from a *very* reliable source...Basically he was told on Wednesday morning, and was leaving the country by that afternoon.\n\nThe Ethan Hawke thing is total speculation though....the only hard fact is that Townsend was told thanks but no thanks. No details on payouts or how their relations stand though.\n\nGod...how terribly cloak and dagger...:-)\n\nAlan Lee back at work with broken arm.\n\n10/14/99, 2:18 pm EST - Tehanu\n\nOur alert reader Tiggy sent in the news from this morning's Dominion.\n\nApparently, conceptual artist Alan Lee broke his arm on Wednesday while on the set, according to some sources. The film company's publicist would not comment on how it happened. Luckily the broken arm was not the arm that Lee draws with, and he is able to continue working.\n\nMortensen: 'Cannot be confirmed right now'\n\n10/14/99, 1:53 pm EST - Xoanon\n\nAfter hearing all the hulabaloo, TheOneRing.net placed a call to Mortensen's agent, who had this to say:\n\n'This cannot be confirmed right now'\n\nObviously not a 'yes or no' answer I was looking for. But It seems that something is brewing.\n\nMore on Viggo\n\n10/14/99, 1:45 pm EST - Xoanon\n\nAICN Checks In\n\n10/14/99, 1:40 pm EST - Xoanon\n\nLORD OF THE RINGS casting change: Stuart out, Viggo in?\n\nHey folks, Harry here. For the past three days I've been attempting to confirm the story that Stuart Townsend has left LORD OF THE RINGS and the part of Aragorn. I tried my best contacts on the project and have never heard back from them. However, I have had over 14 different folks from New Zealand and New Line tell me that he has left. Why did he leave... well that I can not say for certain. Depending upon who you talk to, you can hear that he just didn't fit into the mix quite the way they wanted or Peter let him go due to studio pressure or what have ya. Ultimately, I don't believe that is the important part. What is important is that we get our Aragorn/Strider part filled.... and right now according to long time AICN spy, The Ref, Viggo Mortensen has the offer sitting in front of him.\n\nNow having seen Viggo in everything from GI JANE, A PERFECT MURDER, PORTRAIT OF A LADY and VANISHING POINT.... well... I like him. He's also quite a bit older than Stuart and a bit gruffier looking to my eye. I like this casting and think this all might work out for the best here.\n\nNow as far as I know, Viggo has not yet signed, but the offer is allegedly there. Keep your fingers crossed, I believe he'll make a great Aragorn.\n\nMore info from me comming soon.\n\np.s. Sorry Pypesmoke\n\nTownsend Leaving? - UPDATED\n\n10/14/99, 1:09 pm EST - Xoanon\n\nRecieved this today:\n\nPlease keep me anonymous here, but the actor who has been given his marching orders is Stuart Townsend. From the sound of it, they basically told him that he wasn't what they wanted. And he's been here for over 2 months!! I wouldn't be surprised if it was a political move due to perhaps getting a bigger name for the role...\n\nThis could be total bogus, but I thought you might like to know. TheOneRing.net is trying to confirm this, as well as the entire rumor about an actor leaving. More info coming soon UPDATE The Super Ringer Spy that sent me the report about someone leaving in the first place had this to say about the possibility of Townsend departing. Good Morning, I have seen your report that it is Stuart Townsend (supposedly - X). I still haven't seen any official news releases here though. But I think that would tie up with the shooting schedule, they must have pushed back the inside shooting of the Prancing Pony. More to come.\n\nBrain Bender Winners!\n\n10/14/99, 9:50 am EST - Quickbeam\n\nGreetingsQuickbeam here.\n\nWe want to thank all of you who participated in our premiere Brain Bender contest! It seems that my question was worth all the book-pounding and page- flipping it certainly caused... :-)\n\nCongratulations to our three winners (based on the timeliness of their submissions):\n\n1. Caroline Lauzon\n\n2. Ron Stewart\n\n3. Philippe Chabot\n\nYou can find the question and the winning solution in the Green Books Brain Bender Section.\n\nCool Tidbit\n\n10/14/99, 8:54 am EST - Xoanon\n\nMedia Watch: The Dominion\n\n10/13/99, 8:36 pm EST - Xoanon\n\nWellingtonÕs Dominion newspaper had an interview with producer Barrie Osborne.There he talked about the hobbits, saying that although the public might recognise stars like Elijah Wood (Frodo) or Ian Holm (Bilbo), they might wonder about some of the others. Osborne revealed that the film would employ hobbit ÔdoublesÕ in the form of a group of people with a rare hormonal growth deficiency different from dwarfism.\n\n\"The doubles are pretty special,\" said Osborne, \"There are four or five of them..two from India, two from England, from Thailand.\" They were not easy to find.\n\nHe went on to describe the hobbit ÔlookÕ Ð big ears, big feet, big smiles, curly hair Ð all helped by the prosthetics crews.\n\nEach hobbit double is matched to a main actor.\n\nMeanwhile, the ÔstarÕ hobbit actors can be shrunk using computer shrinking, high-rig filming and altered scale ratios.\n\nOctober the 11th marked the first day of filming, in the Mt. Victoria town belt in Wellington. Filming was scheduled to continue until Christmas next year.\n\nAt times work was interrupted by driving rain. Osborne took time to discuss Peter JacksonÕs intention to stick very closely to JRRTÕs story. He also revealed that the hobbits were on their way to film in Bree next. Their scenes at the Ômerry old pubÕ would be filmed in an exterior set in Wellington somewhere, and an interior set in the studio.\n\nA production crew of 400 was involved; travel would be necessary. For the extras, they were told to hold next week clear of commitments when they came for their first filming. Osborne let slip that there might be some orcs around in the coming week.\n\nBefore this project, Osborne was the producer for Face/Off and the Matrix, as well as being credited on films such as The Godfather II, All the PresidentÕs Men, The Big Chill, Apocalypse Now, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Good Morning Vietnam.\n\nThanks to Nanoo-x for the scoop!\n\nWhat's This?\n\n10/13/99, 4:45 pm EST - Xoanon\n\nNews has reached me from a very reliable source that PJ and crew have lost a MAJOR star. My contact tells me that some scheduled filming has been pushed up a week due to the loss of the said star, no word on who it is. I do not even know if it's one of the handful that are down in NZ. My contact also tells me that we should expect news from NZ concerning this shortly.\n\nLOTR American Publisher's New Look!\n\n10/13/99, 4:03 pm EST - Xoanon\n\nRecieved this from the Houghton guys:\n\nHoughton's New improved Tolkien websiteis now live on the web.

There's a photo which shows how amazingly close to the centre of the city the filming is taking place. In the photo you can see a few buildings below the people sitting in the park. Just past the city, in the right of the picture, is a dark forested hill. That is Mount Victoria, where the hobbits are currently.

We'll look at ways to post a video clip of the TV news on the website, but meanwhile, we have a juicy monster spy report describing what was seen.\n\nFilming began on Mt. Victoria, a wooded hill in the middle of Wellington. The reporters were not able to get as close as they...as YOU would have liked, but some joggers were interviewed after they'd charged blindly right through the set. And producer Tim Sanders was quite talkative by (LOTR film standards)when interviewed.\n\nCheck it all out in 'The Spy Reports'\n\nMedia Watch: 'The Evening Post'\n\n10/11/99, 12:25 am EST - Xoanon\n\nWellington's answer to the Universal lot.\n\n10/10/99, 8:46 pm EST - Tehanu\n\nScoop has kindly allowed to use this latest posting of theirs.\n\nArticle: Alastair Thompson\n\nDate: Monday, 11 October 1999\n\nTime: 11:11 am NZT Scoop visits Peter Jackson's Camperdown studios: Welcome To Camperdown\n\nAn Unlikely Looking HQ For A $300 Million Film?\n\nIn north Miramar hard up under Mt Crawford an old \"Mel-o-rich\" milkshake powder factory is home to New Zealand's largest ever cultural investment - the Lord of the Rings trilogy being filmed over the next 18 months under the direction of Peter Jackson. See also... \"The Lord Of The Rings\" To Begin Photography In NZ\n\nA couple of weeks ago, on a Sunday, Scoop scouted out Camperdown Studios - on the corner or Camperdown and Weka Sts - HQ to Peter Jackson's massive film project.\n\nCamperdown was not - yet anyway - the hive of activity one might expect it to be. No limousines nor anyone vaguely famous was spotted. Admittedly it was a Sunday.\n\nThe site appeared to be completely covered in low barracks like buildings with various industrial milk handling apparatus attached. There are also lots of signs referring those interested in talking to Weka digital to a relatively new looking office block at the rear of the site.\n\nOut front was a rusty bus, out rear a triumph sports convertible. The kids were kind of disappointed there were no milk-shakes.\n\nView the images and complete article at The Scoop website at http://www.scoop.co.nz/\n\nThis Story is at http://www.scoop.co.nz/frames/stories/HL9910/S00046.htm\n\nToday is the Day...\n\n10/10/99, 11:52 am EST - Xoanon\n\nAt least in NZ, it's 4:41 am, Monday October 11 Down there. As you all know filming is set to start today. And I'm filled with giddy childlike excitement along with the rest of you!\n\nWhat will happen in the course of these 18 months? Will there be problems on the set? Will the media turn its collective back and start calling this project 'ill fated'? Will production run over budget? Or hopefully, will production move along at an incredible pace? Will there be such harmony on the set that filming 'The Hobbit' will not only be an eventuality, but a reality?\n\nThis is now the time when all details move from LA, NY, and the UK to New Zealand. All sound bites, interviews, photos and news bits will eventualy be coming from there. That is why we added a little 'weather updater', for those of us who aren't from NZ, it'll at least make you have some sense of 'being' there.\n\nThis is now the time for our NZ friends to come into action. With production starting, the 'cat' will be out of the bag, so to speak, somewhere someone is going to see something, and we here at TheOneRing.net want to know about it. Send it along in an email, if you come up with the goods on a regular basis, we'll give you free access to post any of your news in our Spy Reports.\n\nSo here we go, 18 months of filming, almost the same amount of time editing. TheOneRing.net is in it for the long haul (I've got a comfy computer chair) I hope you all enjoy the expierence.\n\nXoanon & TheOneRing.net Team\n\nConway Pic!\n\n10/10/99, 11:39 am EST - Xoanon\n\nElijah News: Interview for 'Black and White'\n\n10/10/99, 12:35 am EST - Xoanon\n\nThis comes by way of our Russan Counterparts, it's an interview with EW done by none other that Brooke Shields for an upcoming film 'Black and White'.\n\nInterview With Elijah Wood\n\nby Brooke Shields\n\nBS: Let's talk about the movie we did together, Black and White. Had you done a totally improvisational film before?\n\nEW: No. And as interesting as the project seemed, I was really scared because it was so far away from anything I'd done. Then I came to the conclusion that if you're ever fearful of taking a step forward to a place that could be better for you, you should always take it, because that's the only way you'll ever grow. So despite how afraid I was, I made the decision to continue.\n\nBS: Well, fear is an incredible motivator. OK, now you can talk about kissing me. [laughs]\n\nEW: That was an absolutely lovely day! I came to the set thinking I was filming one thing, and one of the assistant directors came to my trailer and said, \"You've got to kiss Brooke Shields in the park today.\" I was like, \"I'm sorry. Run that by me again?\" [BS laughs] What a great experience! I already felt very close to you, and that brought us a bit closer.\n\nBS: The feeling was mutual. Still, I was thinking, I should be arrested for this! And you kept saying that it was legal in some states! [laughs] So I didn't fell so bad. So next you're doing \"The Lord of the Rings.\" Have you read the trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien?\n\nEW: No, but I read \"The Hobbit.\"\n\nBS: Did they suggest you read all three books?\n\nEW: It wasn't necessary, although I believe they're under the impression that I have read all three. But I don't think it really matters. The script are brilliant, and they've kept the tone of Tolkien's writing, which is wonderful.\n\nBS: How would you describe a hobbit?\n\nEW: A hobbit is a very short, amusing character. They don't wear shoes. They have hairy feet and pointy little ears. My character, Frodo Baggins, has a wry sense of humor.\n\nBS: You were perfectly typecast.\n\nEW: [laughs] How perceptive!\n\nBS: I did kiss you, remember? I was given these Tolkien stories when I was a child. They should be required reading at an older age, just because of the lessons in them.\n\nEW: Oh, definitely. The stories reveal the darkness of the human spirit, and where that can go, as well as extreme light.\n\nBS: You'll be shooting in New Zealand, right? Will you be there for a long time?\n\nEW: Fourteen months, because we're doing three movies. It's going to be an adventure, a real journey. And I think that I'll be different when I come back, as a person and an actor, and I look forward to that.\n\nMedia Watch: Bree Set on ONE News NZ\n\n10/08/99, 3:20 pm EST - Xoanon\n\nBlast from the Past\n\n10/08/99, 10:46 am EST - Xoanon\n\nSuper Spy J has sent me some rather cool stuff. Check out a photograph and an original cell from Bashki's '78 Cartoon movie. Check it out in The Spy Reports.\n\nMore Arwen Auditon Scripts!\n\n10/08/99, 10:35 am EST - Xoanon\n\nMy Contact has slipped me yet another bit 'o script from the Arwen auditions!\n\nYou hardcore Tolkien fans are certainly going to like this. The sequence follows the first meeting of Arwen and Aragorn. Aragorn mistakes her for Luthien, an immortal lady who chooses to become mortal for the love of a man.\n\nThe interesting bit is, this isn't really mentioned in the Trilogy, but in Appendix A part V, someone has done their homework!\n\nThe rest of the scene is a rather nice meeting of these two characters.\n\nThe meeting takes place in Rivendell, and Aragorn is surprised to learn she is a child of the Eldar.\n\nARWEN\n\nI've already lived in this world so long that to me, you're but a yearling shoot next to a tree of many summers.\n\nARAGORN\n\n(sighs)\n\nI know it. I am mortal, and you are Elf kind.\n\nMedia Watch: Liv on Leno\n\n10/08/99, 8:38 am EST - Xoanon\n\nLiv Tyler, better known as Arwen. Was on 'The Tonight Show With Jay Leno' last night, October 7th. Liv and Jay spoke of her latest film, Plunkett & McLaine as well as her next film.\n\nThe only LOTR mention was at the very end when Jay asked her where she was off to, he then answered the question himself, New Zealand.\n\nSigh, I just WISH he would have asked her something about LOTR, oh well.\n\nStilt Actors\n\n10/07/99, 11:01 pm EST - Xoanon\n\nI know we've covered this before, it's somewhere in the archives, but a VERY reliable source sent me this tonight:\n\nBy the way, there's been all this talk wondering about whether the Ents will be played by performers on stilts, and while I'm not sure what they are intended for (possibly just to provide a mobile reference point when shooting set-ups involving mixed-scale characters, such as the Hobbits alongside humans, etc.), the Ents will be realised primarily as fully digital characters, with partial full-scale props being utilized.\n\nVerrry interesting\n\nAndy Serkis' Voice!\n\n10/07/99, 10:20 pm EST - Xoanon\n\nWith a little digging, I managed to get a few sound bites of Andy Serkis' voice.\n\nThese are from the film 'Career Girls' where Serkis played Mr. Evans, a female obsessed pig who's trying to sell his house.\n\nSerkis will obviously 'play up' his voice to play the troubled Hobbit, but it's at least a treat to hear his voice!\n\nClip 1\n\nClip 2\n\nClip 3\n\nClip 4\n\nEnjoy\n\nThe 'Sean' Thing\n\n10/07/99, 4:51 pm EST - Xoanon\n\nMore on this Sean thing, Keef & Kaz is SURE that it's Sean, time will tell.\n\nI still reckon it was sean connery. I spoke some more with my (significant other) about the meeting on the set. he was here for 2 days..and as was said he has the part of narrator. in his words..\"an older hobbit that tells the story\"\n\nAn older Hobbit telling the tale? Could be a possibility :)\n\nThanks to Keef & Kaz for the tip!\n\nAdd Cate in There As Well\n\n10/07/99, 3:07 pm EST - Xoanon\n\nNew Line has sent me an addition to the Press Release, seems someone forgot to add Cate's little bio:\n\nCate Blanchett stars as the elf Galadriel, the wise and visionary queen of Lorien. For her performance in the title role of Elizabeth last year, the Australian actress won the Golden Globe and BAFTA awards as well as an Oscar® nomination. She has also been lauded for her performances in such films as An Ideal Husband, Thank God He Met Lizzie and Oscar and Lucinda.\n\nNEW LINE PRESS RELEASE\n\n10/07/99, 1:19 pm EST - Xoanon\n\nFrom NEW LINE CINEMA\n\nhello, from gordon paddison at new line cinema. i wanted to drop you a copy of the 'official press release' for the start of production on lord of the rings (i am sending it to you now 10:15am (pst) before it is being released to press outlets or newswires). this is a pc microsoft word 2000 document.\n\nplease keep my information in your files and i hope to be in contact throughout production and release of the film. new line is very interested in working with fan sites. i know that you are as dedicated to this film as we are.\n\nfyi, i wanted to let you know what is coming from the 'official website.' in the coming weeks we will have full content to support the start of production. production features and personal interview updates by peter jackson for the official website. also, the official website will offer the Lord of the Rings Internet web browser to support the energy and content currently existing for the film. the LOTR Web browser will include buddy lists, instant messaging and a club building capability.
