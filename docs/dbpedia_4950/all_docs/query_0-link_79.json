The linguistic dexterity of Appalachian speakers, their story-telling skills, and their purportedly archaic vocabulary and phrasing have long fascinated outsiders. Appalachians have been romanticized as surviving speakers of âElizabethanâ English yet simultaneously scorned as backward users of substandard English that reflects the regionâs isolation from the mainstream and whose very name bespeaks deeply entrenched socio-economic ills. Educator and social researcher John C. Campbell famously observed in 1921 that Appalachia was a land âabout which, perhaps, more things are known that are not true than of any part of our country.â This statement pertains particularly well to the English spoken there. Whether fostering positive stereotypes or negative ones, how Appalachians speak has often marked them as different, generating many attempts to explain still another aspect of the regionâs âotherness,â in the words of Henry Shapiro. One product of such perceptions is a belief that the regionâs population and their culture are largely uniform, a misconception that persists to the present day. The heterogeneity of the regionâs speech has increasingly led linguists to speak of âAppalachian Englishes.â\n\nNo one wayâhistorical, geographical, or any otherâperspective on the subject can adequately relate the complex roles that English has played in the life and history of Appalachia and its people. Though mountain speech is often believed to be the most distinctive regional variety in America, Appalachia is home to a spectrum of dialects. Research has shown that the ancestry of Appalachian speech is mixed and that in many ways it represents a microcosm of American English.\n\nA multi-lingual background. Prior to English having its sway, Europeans were relative latecomers to Appalachia, first engaging speakers of indigenous languages around 1540, when the Spanish under Hernando de Soto encountered the Cherokee in the hill country and mountains of the present-day Carolinas and the Yuchi in northeastern Tennessee. Within a century French traders had made contact with the Cherokeeâs Iroquoian-speaking cousins, including the Oneida and the Seneca, in the foothills of New York. Neither Spanish nor French took root as a community language, however, and it was not until the early eighteenth century, when Germans and English-speaking Scotch-Irish pressed westward into Pennsylvania and then southward into the Shenandoah Valley, that European languages were firmly planted in the region.\n\nDating from the late-seventeenth century, Scotch-Irish is the oldest name in the United States for emigrants from Ulster, the northernmost province of Ireland, and their descendants. Most of their earlier ancestors had come from Lowland Scotland, where for centuries people were known as Scotch (but now usually as Scots). This historical fact is preserved in Scotch-Irish, a name Americans have continued to employ. Also (but much less often) known as the Scots-Irish, most of the 150,000 or more Ulster emigrants who came in the American colonial period settled in the interior, where they and their culture and language became influential in much of Appalachia.\n\nAs previously mentioned, only English and German ever became community languages, with the latter declining precipitously in the nineteenth century), Appalachia has long been the destination of speakers of other European languages. In the nineteenth century, the region attracted small groups from Wales and France, as in the early-twentieth century it did Italians, Hungarians, Poles, among others to the coalfields of Central Appalachia. Among very recent arrivals are Mexicans, as in north Georgia. The image of Appalachia as being, or having ever been, monolingual does not match the patchwork of languages that could be heard.\n\nThe English heard in Appalachia has long attracted the interest of legions of journalists, travelers, and educators, and since the 1870s they have stressed one quality above all othersâits conservatism. Being struck by usages reminding them of writers studied in literature classes, they have consistently labeled mountain speech as âShakespearean,â âChaucerian,â and the like. However respectable the roots suggested, such ideas have largely been discredited (see xx), though, and in recent decades Appalachian speech has had to compete with notions that it differs from âstandard Englishâ and is an inferior type of English and therefore an impediment to social mobility and educational progress. These conflicting views have simultaneously romanticized mountain speech (and by implication its users) as quaint while stigmatizing it as deviant. The public, scholars included, appears to have no difficulty maintaining widely conflicting, if not contradictory, ideas about the English language spoken in Appalachia.\n\nInfluenced by early backwoods humoristsâ use in dialogue, nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century writers such as humorist George Washington Harris and novelist Mary Noailles Murfree sought to enhance the exoticness of their fictional characters through their heavy use of often-exaggerated dialect, using contorted spellings to suggest the illiteracy or comedy of these characters (making them unreadable today). âTharâs nun ove âem fasâ enuf tu ketch meâ is typical from one of Harrisâs mountaineers. Many its and other forms later made their way into the Barney Google comic strip after Snuffy Smith was introduced to it in 1934. Reinforcing this stereotypical image since that time have been countless books, movies, television programs, and tourist-shop caricatures conveying the popular but unfounded notion that people from the hills use plumb âcompletelyâ (âHe fell plumb to the bottomâ), right smart âa good deal (of)â (âThey lost a right smart in that tradeâ), among many others, are found only in the mountain and are used constantly. No matter how ludicrous, portrayals of mountain English in the media are often accepted as accurate outside Appalachia and consequently reinforce perceptions that mountain people are different and backward.\n\nHowever, many commentators have also pointed out the expressiveness and adaptability of mountain speech and the resourcefulness of its speakers. These positive qualities are seen in fresh metaphors like kick âreject in courtshipâ and can see to canât see âdawn to duskâ; vivid similes (meaner than a striped snake; as thick as fiddlers in hell); abundant use of proverbs; descriptive place names such as Hell for Certain, Kentucky; novel conversions of one part of speech to another (the noun manpower as a verb meaning âmove by brute effort,â (âWeâll have to manpower that log upâ); and in other ways.\n\nBecause the Appalachians cover a vast area from the Northeast to the Deep South, the region is too large to form a distinct or unified region in traditional culture or speech. Instead, linguists speak of the Midland dialect region, a smaller territory stretching westward and southwestward from its cultural and linguistic seed bed in central Pennsylvania, where English was first planted in the region, to northern Alabama. This region is divided into the North Midland (northern West Virginia, western Maryland, and most of Pennsylvania) and the South Midland (southern West Virginia, western Virginia, western North and South Carolina, eastern Kentucky, east Tennessee, north Georgia, and north Alabama). Other than sheer expanse, a diverse topography, and separation between local areas, several factors worked against Appalachiaâs forming a distinct or cohesive dialect area. Settlement by different groups or varying concentrations of groups produced local variations. From the beginning internal migration has mixed the language habits of the English, Scotch-Irish, Germans, and other settler groups in various ways, leveling differences, especially in pronunciation. A new landscape and new needs gave rise to innovations in vocabulary.\n\nResearch by the American Linguistic Atlas Project, a systematic national survey of traditional vocabulary and pronunciation initiated around 1930, found only seventeen words and phrases by and large distinctive to the Midland region. These include bawl âa calfâs cryâ, blinds âwindow shuttersâ, hull âto shell (beans or peas)â, and poke âpaper bagâ (âShe bought a poke of peanutsâ). Six others are common to the North Midland (jag âarmful of cornâ; run âcreekâ) and five (e.g. jacket âvestâ; fireboard âmantelâ (âLydia set her clock proudly on the fireboardâ) to the South Midland. However definitive in demarcating the region linguistically, few of these terms are commonly known or used today. Based on a national perspective and a much larger bank of evidence, the Dictionary of American Regional English has labeled 46 items and usages as âAppalachianâ (e.g. check âa light meal,â generation âan extended family,â rainbird âthe yellow-billed cuckooâ) and nearly 300 others as âsouthern Appalachianâ (e.g. hand-going âconsecutively,â leather britches âa green bean threaded and hung up to dry,â mountain boomer âa diminutive red squirrelâ) because their distribution appears to be confined to or concentrated in those regions.\n\nThis relative scarcity of evidence has led scholars to question whether âAppalachian Englishâ and âSouthern Appalachian Englishâ are geographical entities based on common usage or cultural ones more strongly linked to solidarity. Perhaps their strong sense of place, cohesive communities, and attachments to traditional lifestyles and values have made mountain people less willing to accommodate to mainstream culture. This resistance to change can be reflected in the tendency to retain speech habits even a generation or more after a person has moved to a metropolitan area such as Chicago, Detroit, or Cincinnati. Like people who stayed behind, migrants often consciously distinguish themselves from people outside their new communities, as in pronouncing Appalachia with the third syllable as lat rather than lay. The latter development has grown steadily since the 1960s, apparently in reaction to the pronunciation of the media and government officials.\n\nIn 1985 one Eastern Kentuckian wrote, âWhat I finally came to understand is that AppaLAYcha does not exist. At least, it doesnât exist in the real world. The AppaLATCHans exist; even AppaLATCHa exists. But AppaLAYcha is a fiction. It is an idea created by politicians and reporters. It has no more physical reality than Edgar Rice Burroughsâ Africa or Ray Bradburyâs Mars.â\n\nThe presence of many archaisms in mountain speech has prompted more study of its origins than that of any other region. Three sources of this element have most frequently been proposed: âElizabethanâ England, eighteenth-century colonial American English, or Ulster (by way of the Scotch-Irish). It is easy to oversimplify such an issue because no type of speech came to North America without mixing with others immediately after arrival, because retentions represent only part of the larger story of any type of American speech, and because no type of American English, no matter how separate from the mainstream, has remained static.\n\nThough more often than not been used loosely to mean âold-fashioned,â âElizabethanâ and âShakespeareanâ refer, strictly speaking, to the period around 1600. Connecting this period to mountain speech has the greatest popularity but the least historical and linguistic support. Settlers from the British Isles did not begin arriving in Appalachia for another century and a half. They brought vocabulary found in Britain in general or to a lesser extent northern England (galluses âsuspendersâ, palings âfence postsâ), western England (counterpane âbedspreadâ), and Scotland (chancy âdoubtfulâ, sop âgravyâ.)\n\nThe view of Elizabethan England as the source of mountain English was formulated and promoted by people from outside Appalachians who recognized some usages (afeared âafraidâ) familiar from the works of Shakespeare and his contemporaries. Some came to know mountain people firsthand and sought to counter negative stereotypes by highlighting positive qualities. Although this connection has little scholarly basis, it and similar ideas have flourished as cultural myths, possibly because the region retains immense value for Americans elsewhere as a repository of culture and tradition less affected by mass society and more closely tied to the past. Nonetheless, such a romantic notion has hardly saved Appalachia from neglect, marginalization, and exploitation.\n\nFor both pronunciations and grammatical patterns a better case can be made for roots from colonial American than for Elizabethan England. These include final -a pronounced as -y (opry âoperaâ, extry âextraâ, as in âThe soup needs an extry pinch of saltâ) and the addition of r to some words (tater âtomatoâ, holler âhollowâ. Blowed and knowed as the past tense and past participle of blow and know do not occur in Shakespeareâs writings but were fairly common for colonial arrivals to American shores. Such verb forms is still common in Appalachia, though they have long been considered nonstandard in the United States. Associated with the first two views is the alleged influence of geographic and cultural âisolationâ on Appalachian speech. This idea is largely a myth, based on false beliefs that Appalachia is culturally homogenous and that physical separation caused life to move slowly. Archaic speechways, along with traditional ballads, Jack Tales, and types of folk dancing and weaving supposedly show that Appalachian culture is static. Historians have argued that mountain communities typify rural America, however. While such traditions might seem to exemplify cultural preservations from centuries past, studies have found them to be ever-changing. Mountain people still write ballads to recount modern tragedies, disasters, and star-crossed love, but actually these are timeless themes, not archaic ones.\n\nThe third commonly cited source of Appalachian speech is from Ulster, the northernmost historical province of Ireland. Most of the 150,000 or more who left there in the eighteenth century settled in the American interior, becoming known as the Scotch-Irish. Many of them moved into the valleys and hills of Appalachia. Only traces of modern-day Appalachian pronunciation can be attributed to them, but their influence has been greater in vocabulary and grammar. Scotch-Irish vocabulary includes airish âchillyâ (âIt was an awful irish dayâ), brickle âbrittleâ (âThe dry leaves were brickle and crumbled easilyâ), discomfit âto inconvenienceâ (âI wouldnât want to discomfit youâj), and ill âbad-temperedâ (âThat dog is ill as a hornetâ) The Ulster contribution to regional grammar has been more significant, as evidenced in the formation of words (by combining âun âoneâ with adjectives and pronouns (youngâun, bigâun, youâuns), phrases (need followed by a verb past participle, as in âThat boy needs taught a lessonâ; compound helping verbs (âI wonder if you might could help meâ); and conjunctions, as with whenever for âat the time thatâ (âWhenever I was young, people didnât do such a thingâ). The English of Appalachia resembles the language of Shakespeareâs England not nearly so much as that of eighteenth-century Ulster. Even so, only perhaps twenty percent of terms and usages not shared by the rest of the country can be traced to the British Isles. While this percentage is higher than for most other American varieties, it still indicates that the foremost component of all American varieties is new vocabulary. Borrowings and inventions are continually needed as speakers face new challenges of environment and culture.\n\nMost terms identified as Appalachian by the Dictionary of American Regional English and other sources were actually born in America (bald âtreeless area on a mountaintopâ, flannel cake âpancakeâ). Of the seventeen Midland items identified by the American Linguistic Atlas Project, most are unambiguously American in origin and represent responses to the New World (lamp oil âkeroseneâ, sugar tree âsugar mapleâ). Six at most (piece âsnackâ, want in âwant to go/come inâ, as in âThat dog doesnât know whether he wants in or outâ) may have come from Ulster (though much of the English of Ulster is shared with northern England and Scotland and is, historically speaking, derived from those regions).\n\nContributions traceable to other languages have been few. In contrast to an abundance of surnames, there is little evidence for German outside Pennsylvania, where one finds such words as smearcase âcottage cheeseâ (from schmier âspreadâ + KÃ¤se âcheeseâ. Irish Gaelic/Scottish Gaelic inheritance is also scant and consists mainly of vocabulary. Terms such as brogan âheavy, homemade leather shoeâ, bonny clabber âcurdled sour milkâ, and muley âhornless cowâ, had already been absorbed by English-speaking Scotch-Irish before they left Ireland, and no evidence for a community of Gaelic speakers in Appalachia has ever been documented. Other European languages, such as Spanish (doney âsweetheartâ) and French, contributed even less to Appalachian speech. The lack of influence from Cherokee, even on the local English of western North Carolina, is both striking and puzzling. Because so much medicinal and other lore was absorbed by Europeans from the Cherokee, as well as the names of so many rivers, mountains, and other topographical features, there is no ready explanation for the absence of common vocabulary such as Cherokee names for plants (other than sochan for an edible wild green).\n\nMany features of Appalachian grammar are found elsewhere, especially in the Deep South, but occur with greater frequency in the hills. Examples include a- as a prefix on verb present participles (a-goin, a-cominâ) and possessive pronouns with the suffix -n (hern, hisn, yourn, as in âa book of yournâ), came from England. Emigrants from Ulster introduced others, such as personal pronouns hit âitâ and youâuns âyou (plural)â and all after pronouns to indicate inclusion: who all and what all (âWho all came and what all did they say?â) Verbs having the same form for the past tense and past participle as well as present tense (come, eat, run) and the addition of -est to form the superlative of adjectives ending in -ing (workingest âworking the hardest or the mostâ, as âthe workingest fellow in townâ; or singingest) exhibit a general ancestry from the British Isles, while the reversal of word elements (everwhat âwhateverâ, everwho âwhoeverâ, as in âEverwho hears that will be surprisedâ) and the use of prepositions in series (âThere was several houses on up around on Mill Creekâ) are apparently American developments.\n\nPronunciations that represent more recent developments but shared with the Deep South include prolonging and splitting vowels into two syllables (red as re-uhd or ray-uhd, rib as ree-uhb), a pattern sometimes known as the âsouthern drawlâ); shifting of accent to the first syllable of a word (IN-surance, PO-leece); modification of âlong Iâ to ah in certain contexts, so that my right side sounds like mah raht sahd, wire rhymes with either car or war, and tile rhymes with tall, and pronouncing the same vowel sound in word pairs such as pen/pin and gem/Jim.\n\nMountain speech has retained or created senses of words unfamiliar elsewhere in the United States that can result in miscommunication. In the Great Smoky Mountains someone might be heard to say, âA lot of mountain people are kind of backward, but I donât care to talk to nobody.â By this is meant that while other people are shy, the speaker does not mind (in fact, enjoys) conversing with strangers. People who says they are âhard to hearâ may mean, depending on the context, that they are soft-spoken or that they have difficulty hearing others. Other common words having variant meanings in the mountains include several âquite a fewâ (âWe picked several blackberries this summerâ), clever âhospitable,â (âYouâll find people very clever here in the mountains,â and ill âbad-temperedâ.\n\nMany social factors can influence an individualâs speech, such as the formality of a given situation, the respective ages, levels of education, and so on. Less educated speakers are more likely to use speech considered typically Appalachian, though some features of pronunciation are used at all social or educational levels (except in northern parts of Appalachia). Examples include modification of âlong Iâ to ah in words like time and my and the pronunciation of words like pen and gem as pin and Jim. These are completely âstandardâ in Appalachia and in much of the South.\n\nVocabulary varies mainly by subregion within Appalachia or by the age or âruralnessâ of the speaker. More modern, mainstream terms have been rapidly displacing older, rural counterparts, especially for younger inhabitants. A study of students at a small college in Western North Carolina found a dramatic loss of regional vocabulary; for instance, living room, gutters, mantel, and attic had completely replaced big house, eaves trough, fireboard, and loft.\n\nBecause it brings speakers into contact with national norms, formal education enables speakers, especially younger ones, to shift between varieties or styles of English according to the situation. But it can also produce self-consciousness or defensiveness about differences between oneâs âhome Englishâ and oneâs âschool English,â pitting the values of family and place against those of the larger world, which emphasize social mobility. Because of the pressure to conform to local norms in much of rural Appalachia, an individualâs level of education may not strongly influence the way he or she speaks.\n\nToo often one still finds the view that American dialects such as those found in Appalachia are only modifications of âStandard English incorrectly learnedâ due to backwardness or a lack of intelligence. Educators and linguists have disputed these views for a long time, but the association of mountain English with impoverished, low-status speakers has resisted arguments of its respectable heritage. Unfortunately, sometimes mountain people have also accepted the negative evaluation of their English.\n\nNo region, community, or person is homogeneous in speech, of course. Variation and change are natural and universal. The speech of Appalachia has been shaped in different ways at different places, as, for example, through contact with nearby lowlands, by migration into or from different areas, by the experience of cultures coming into contact, and perhaps above all, the constant adaptation by speakers to meet their changing needs. As elsewhere, varieties of English in Appalachia will continue to bend somewhat to the forces standardizing American culture. However, in the end, they will endure because of the cultural cohesion and the sense of community and regional identity it provides to its speakers, even in the face of persistent misconceptions and pressure to conform.\n\nReferences: Craig M.

As much as researchers have examined variation in the regionâs English, only recently have they begun to analyze the speech of African Americans there.\n\nFrom studies in NC and WV linguists have identified several characteristics of African American English in the region. As with all living varieties, the language of African Americans is changing. Speakers born in the last decade of the nineteenth century had speech patterns different from those of speakers at the end of the twentieth century. Even so, there are often discernible features used by African Americans in Appalachia.\n\nGenerally speaking, African Americans in Appalachia can be described as having three types of features: one type found only in African American English; a second type shared with lowland Southern varieties; and a third type shared by African American and European American Appalachian speakers. Even so, research has shown there to be local variation according to Communities of Practice, which can influence speech patterns at least as much if not more than ethnic or regional divisions.\n\nThe first type of feature includes absence of the copula verb is (e.g. she nice for she is nice). Another verb variation, third-person singular âs absence, as in the dog bark_, has been found for some African American Appalachians. Some African Americans also use be in the traditional fashion to indicate an event happening on a repeated or regular basis, as in âTown be full on Friday and Saturday nights.â\n\nThe second group includes features that reflect an affinity with many varieties in the Deep South. One such feature is making the final r sound more vowel-like (four becomes fo-uh), and an even more common feature is pronouncing the vowels in words like pin and pen the same. Throughout the South the two-part <i> vowel tends to become a single vowel in words such as mine (pronounced mahn), mile (mahl), and (bahd). In the past this sound pattern diverged in words such as like, light, and nice, which some European Americans pronounced lahk, laht, and nahs, while African Americans often did not use ah before the consonants k, t, or s. Researchers have found that some African American Appalachians have more recently adopted this pattern in all sound environments. Overall, it is in the combination of the first two types of dialect features that a discernible Appalachian African American English can be recognized.\n\nA third group of features can be found in most varieties of Appalachia from West Virginia down into southern parts of the region. Some of these features are vernacular, such as using was with plural subjects (e.g. we was there), where as others are fairly standard in the region, such as pronouncing l almost like a vowel (oh or uh) at the end of words such as ball and boil.\n\nEnglish varies regionally within Appalachia. For example, West Virginia since its formation in 1863 has been divided into northern and southern cultures as a result of alliances during the Civil War, and the state tends to have a sharp dialect boundary.\n\nAfrican American speech reflects this divide also, as in pronouncing the vowel in mine and bide as mahn and bahd is more frequent for African Americans in southern West Virginia. Cultural attitudes tend to follow these dialect divisions: African Americans in southern West Virginia view themselves as both Southerners and African American, while those in northern areas identify themselves as African American only.\n\nThe patterns and features of English spoken by African Americans in Appalachia provide evidence for the inherent richness and diversity of both African American English and Appalachian Englishes. They permit Appalachian Englishes to be defined more completely as a collection of varieties differing by subregion, generation, ethnicity, and local Community of Practice.\n\nReferences: Becky Childs and Christine Mallinson, âAfrican American English in Appalachia,â English World-Wide 25:27-50 (2004); Kirk Hazen, âThe Final Days of Appalachian Heritage Language,â in Language Variation and Change in the American Midland, ed. by Beth Simon and Thomas Murray, 129-50 (Philadelphia: Benjamins. 2006); Christine Mallinson and Becky Childs, âCommunities of Practice in Sociolinguistics,â Gender & Language 1:173-206 (2007); Walt Wolfram, âAfrican American Speech in Southern Appalachia,â in Talking Appalachian, ed. by Amy D.

Walls, Sonoma State University\n\nJust as the word Appalachia is generally pronounced Ap-pa-LATCH-a in the southern mountains, but more commonly ap-pa-LAY-cha in the rest of the country, so too is there some dispute over the origin of the name given to the region.\n\nLegend has it that Hernando de Soto or members of his 1539 expedition named the Appalachian Mountains. Surviving accounts of the de Soto expedition, however, offer no evidence that the conquistador or his companions intended to designate the eastern mountain chain for the Apalachee Indians, whom they encountered far to the south in what is now northern Florida. The first European contact with the Apalachee had been made by Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vacaâs expedition in 1528 in the vicinity of Tampa Bay, Florida. One derivation of the name argues that in the Muscogee language apala means âgreat sea,â and combined with the personal participle chi, apalache means âthose by the sea.â Apparently early mapmakers, confused by vague stories of locations and distances, transposed the territory of the Apalachee farther north.\n\nDiego Gutierrez was the first mapmaker to record a variation of Appalachian. On his map of America, published in 1562, the region âApalchenâ appears to the north of a mountain range, far from Florida. Jacques le Moyne de Morgues, an artist who accompanied the French Huguenot expedition to Florida in 1564, never actually traveled north to the mountains, but he painted a scene of Indians collecting gold from streams running from the âApalatcy Mountainsâ and also designated a village as âApalatchi.â Le Moyneâs map was published in 1591 and, despite its errors, influenced many subsequent maps, including Gerardus Mercatorâs 1606 map, a standard for the next fifty years.\n\nDuring the eighteenth century, the southern half of the eastern mountain chain was known as the Appalachians and the northern half the Alleghenies, with the overall designation alternating between the two. In a letter to the editor of the Knickerbocker in 1839, Washington Irving suggested that Appalachia or Alleghenia might be a more appropriate name for the United States, probably the first appearance in print of the term Appalachia. Geographer Arnold Henry Guyot established the scientific and popular usage for the entire mountain range with his article âOn the Appalachian Mountain systemâ in 1861.\n\nWith the geographic nomenclature firmly established, Appalachia began to be defined as a cultural region and a social and economic problem area. Before the Civil War, there was little to distinguish the way of life in the Appalachians from life generally on the American frontier. Local color writers discovered the region in the mid-1870s, and educators and missionaries sought to define the southern Appalachians as a social problem area deserving the attention of church home mission boards and private philanthropic foundations. Berea College President William Goodell Frost made influential delineations of the region in 1894, as did John C. Campbell in The Southern Highlander and His Homeland in 1921. The federal government issued a comprehensive survey in 1935 (Economic and Social Problems and Conditions of the Southern Appalachians) and the Ford Foundation supported an updated survey in 1962 (The Southern Appalachian Region: A Survey). Since 1965, official designations have followed the Appalachian Regional Development Act and its subsequent amendments. Political considerations have extended the definition from physiographic highlands to lower-lying areas with similar socioeconomic profiles, as in northeastern Mississippi.\n\nReferences: William P.

Williamson, 56-76 (Boone, NC: Appalachian Consortium, 1977).\n\nAppalachian English and Ozark English\n\nMichael Ellis, Missouri State University\n\nAlthough separated by several hundred miles, Appalachian English and Ozark English have long shared a close association in descriptions of language in the southern highlands. Writers have often assumed that the dialects of the two regions are similar because most of the original settlers of the ozarks came from the southern Appalachians. Although precise origins are difficult to determine, nineteenth-century census records indicate that natives of Tennessee and Kentucky were especially numerous among early residents of the Ozarks, and recent linguistic analyses have indeed confirmed that Ozark English and Appalachian English are very closely related varieties.\n\nEarly treatments of Ozark English, similar to those of Appalachian English, focused on the supposed archaic quality of the regionâs dialects. As early as the 1890s, writers linked the regions in articles about the survival of âShakespeareanâ or âElizabethanâ English.\n\nThe earliest systematic linguistic description of any part of the Ozark region appears in Rachel B. Fariesâs A Word Geography of Missouri (1967), which compares folk vocabulary collected in Missouri with that compiled in Hans Kurathâs Word Geography of the Eastern United States (1949). The study is limited to vocabulary, and the Ozark portion is confined to southwestern Missouri, but Fariesâs work suggests that the Ozarks are an extension of Kurathâs South Midland speech area, a dialect region strongly associated with Appalachian English. South Midland terms common in the Missouri Ozarks include red-worm âearthwormâ; brute and male brute âbullâ; salat âgreensâ; johnny house âprivyâ; turn âamount,â as in âa turn of cornâ is the amount you would take to a millâ; middlins and middlin meat âsalt pork (the side of bacon)â; tow sack âburlap bagâ; and fireboard âmantel.â\n\nIn his American Regional Dialects: A Word Geography (1987), Craig Carver suggests that a truly close relationship between Appalachian English and Ozark English folk vocabulary is limited to the Arkansas portion of the Ozarks. Some characteristic terms include brickle âbrittleâ; bull tongue âplowâ; the preposition fernent ânear to,â âagainst,â or âoppositeâ; goober pea âpeanutâ; jarfly âcicadaâ; and redeye gravy.\n\nMore comprehensive studies, the Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States (1986â92) and Variation and Change in Geographically Isolated Communities: Appalachian English and ozark English (1988), have disclosed overall similarities beyond vocabulary and indicate significant phonological and grammatical links between the two dialects. Ozark English seems to be closely related to dialects in the eastern half of Tennessee but not to the dialects of western Tennessee and eastern Arkansas.\n\nAppalachian English and Ozark English share features that set these dialects apart from other varieties of American English. Characteristic pronunciations include ghostes, thâowed, and potater, as well as oncet âonce,â idnât âisnât,â hit âit,â and far âfire.â Grammatical features include a-prefixing, as in âIâm a-goinâ homeâ; completive done, as in âHeâs done been hereâ; double modal helping verbs, as in âmight couldâ; liketa, as in âHe liketa diedâ; positive anymore, as in âHe works there anymoreâ; and present-tense agreement of plural noun subjects with is or verbs with the suffix -s, as in âpeople is,â âpeople likes,â âmy two brothers lives,â and âschools has.â There are indications that some features may be declining more rapidly in Ozark English than in Appalachian English.\n\nThe dialects in southern Appalachia and in the Ozarks are closely related; however, this does not indicate that there is one Southern Mountain dialect, with Ozark English a simple extension of Appalachian English. A more realistic view is that they are two relatively conservative descendants of a single dialect that was developing in the southern Appalachians during the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries and was carried by migrating settlers westward into the Ozarks, where it has developed independently since the nineteenth century.\n\nReferences: Donna Christian, Walt Wolfram, and Nanjo Dube, Variation and Change in Geographically Isolated Communities: Appalachian English and Ozark English, Publication of the American Dialect Society 74 (1988); Lee Pederson et al., eds., Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States (Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1986â92).\n\nAppalachian English in Literature\n\nMichael Ellis, Missouri State University\n\nSince the early nineteenth century, writers have portrayed spoken language in literature with Appalachian characters and settings. Many early literary dialects are of doubtful authenticity, and their overuse has helped create negative regional stereotypes. On the other hand, since evidence of earlier Appalachian English is limited, literary sources sometimes provide important clues to the development of dialects in the region. Insight into the linguistic or the social significance of Appalachian English in literature requires an understanding of literary dialects and their evolution over the last century and a half.\n\nBy the 1830s, American literary dialects had become fairly conventional. Writers employed an extensive common stock of words, phonetic spellings intended to represent words, and grammatical forms to represent rustic speech without any specific regional identification. James Fenimore Cooper was perhaps the single most influential American writer to represent the speech of frontier characters, beginning with The Pioneers (1823), the first of his Leatherstocking novels. Cooperâs novels, set mainly on the New York frontier, abound in spellings such as larn, sarmon, and sarpent, as well as skear âscare,â nater ânature,â idee âidea,â sitch âsuch,â afeard âafraid,â and wust âworst.â Nonstandard grammatical forms include verbs such as knowâd, catched, teached, seed âsaw,â fit âfought,â and druv âdrove.â Other grammatical forms include the pronoun yourn, the demonstrative them, as in âthem fellers,â and the prepositions afore, again âagainst,â atween, and betwixt.\n\nIn the 1830s and 1840s, authors drew from this?? common literary dialect in works with settings from New England to Arkansas. Other examples from this common stock include phonetic spellings such as swaller, tater, and yeller; Ihoss âhorseâ; bile, spile, and pizon âboil,â âspoil,â and âpoisonâ; verb forms such as hearn âheard,â rid ârode,â and writ âwroteâ; a-goinâ and other words formed with an a- prefix; the possessive pronouns hisn, hern, and ourn; and words such as chimbly âchimney,â yarb âherb,â and catamount and painter âpanther.â Most writers also employed a technique known as eye-dialectâspellings such as wuz, sez, licker, minnit, and wimmin that represent universal pronunciations and have no basis in phonological differences. Eye-dialect was often used for comic effect and served to emphasize the backwardness and illiteracy of characters.\n\nThe existence of a common stock of forms does not mean that all nineteenth-century authors employed exactly the same literary dialect, only that many writers borrowed rather than invented the features they used. Indeed, the primary purpose of a literary dialect was not to create an accurate record of regional speech but rather to define the social position, or perhaps the social divergence, of fictional characters. Contrasts between dialect speakers and non-dialect speakers delineated broad cultural differences: rural (or frontier) versus urban, uneducated versus educated, even irrational versus rational.\n\nBy the mid-nineteenth century, dialect had become a convenient method for revealing social status through the use of dialogue. Before the Civil War, examples of Appalachian English based on actual observation were rare and limited to scattered references in literature by northern travel writers such as Anne Newport Royall, James Kirke Paulding, and Frederick Law Olmsted. By the 1830s, however, a fictional version of Appalachian English began to appear. Paulding, for example, used literary dialect in The Lion of the West (1831), a comic drama partly inspired by the life of David Crockett. There is little difference between the dialect of Pauldingâs literary frontiersman, Nimrod Wildfire, and that of Cooperâs Leatherstocking.\n\nSlightly more accurate is William A. Caruthersâs The Kentuckian in New York (1834). Caruthers was a native Virginian and presumably had a more extensive knowledge than Paulding of the Appalachian region and its speech. He used at least one grammatical feature characteristic of present-day Appalachian English: present tense suffix -s on a verb with a plural noun subject, as in âBut Iâm told the yankees always sings a psalm before they go to battleâ and âOur gals and boys stands up before the parson a few minutes.â\n\nThe life of David Crockett also inspired the anonymous author or authors of various Crockett Almanacs, which began appearing soon after Crockettâs death in 1836 at the Alamo and remained popular through the 1850s. These authors, many of whom were unfamiliar with the region, borrowed their literary dialect from earlier works, including those of Cooper and Paulding, as well as James Hallâs Letters from the West (1828), which includes a character described as âhalf horse and half alligator,â and The Western Souvenir, a Christmas and New Yearâs Gift for 1829 (1828), which featured another frontiersman who could âwhip his weight in wild cats.â The literary dialect in the Crockett Almanacs is, however, generally undistinguished, with dozens of forms such as enuff, laffing, speek, throte, tale âtail,â and hare âhair.â Although the Crockett Almanacs may not represent an authentic version of Appalachian English, they were probably influential in setting the tone for much of what would follow.\n\nOf more linguistic interest are the literary dialects used in works by native southerners from the 1830s through the 1860s, including the border romances of William Gilmore simms and examples of the Old Southwestern humor genre by Augustus Baldwin Longstreet, Johnson J. Hooper, William Tappen Thompson, George Washington Harris, and Harden E. Taliaferro. Harris and Taliaferro are of particular interest since their works have specific Appalachian settings, making them among the earliest examples of Appalachian literature and certainly the earliest to contain extensive literary representations of Appalachian English. Taliaferroâs Fisherâs River (North Carolina) Scenes and Characters (1859) is set in northwestern North Carolina, while Harrisâs Sut Lovingood: Yarns Spun by a âNatâral Born Durnâd Foolâ (1867) is set in East Tennessee.\n\nGenerally speaking, native writers used at least some regionally distinctive features in their literary dialects, while northern authors portraying southern dialects did not. For example, most southern authors regularly employed present tense suffix -s on verbs with plural noun subjects (as in the examples above from Caruthers), a regionally distinctive feature absent from the work of northern authors.\n\nHarrisâs Sut Lovingood stories are especially interesting from a linguistic standpoint since he used so many nonstandard features that were original rather than borrowed. Harris began contributing comic stories to William T. Porterâs national weekly Spirit of the Times in the 1840s, and most of these stories later appeared in the 1867 Sut Lovingood volume. Judging Harrisâs authenticity presents challenges because his literary dialect is so dense and contains many features that are probably not authentic. Like the authors of the Crockett Almanacs, Harris made extensive use of eye-dialect, comic mispronunciations, and malapropisms (dogratipe âdaguerreotypeâ; Delicious Tremenjous âdelirium tremensâ; furnitur-takers âfornicatorsâ). A typical sentence, taken here from âSut Lovingoodâs Daddy, Acting Horse,â reveals a mixture of phonetic spellings and eye-dialect forms: âWhen we got the bridil fixâd ontu dad, donât yu bleve he sot in tu chompin hit jis like a rale hoss, anâ tried tu bite me on the arm (he allers wer a mosâ complikated durned ole fool, anâ mam sed so when he warnt aboutâ). In addition to the phonetic spellings bleve, chompin, jis, rale, anâ, mosâ, ole, and hoss, there are nearly as many examples of eye-dialect: bridil, fixâd, ontu, yu, tu, complikated, and sed.\n\nAlthough Harris probably borrowed much of his literary dialect (âhe . . . wer,â âhe warnt,â âsot,â and âallersâ in the passage above), other usages, such as hit âit,â are uncommon among his contemporaries. Some features used only by Harris, such as the plural forms ghostez and postez, are distinctive of Appalachian English. The most significant aspect of Harrisâs literary dialect is his use of folk vocabulary, since by comparison his contemporaries were fairly reticent about using distinctive regional expressions. Words such as chinkipin, cowcumbers, dulcimore, furnint, gallinipper, gouber peas, lightning bugs, mud dauber, muley cow, and roasin ear are among the dozens found in Harrisâs work. Indeed, his use of folk vocabulary was so extensive and often so obscure that one modern editor included a lengthy glossary at the end of his edition of Sut Lovingood.\n\nThe relative importance of Harrisâs work as a source of evidence about earlier Appalachian English is problematic. Following methods outlined by Sumner Ives in his 1950 article âA Theory of Literary Dialect,â writers have sometimes attempted to authenticate the works of individual authors by comparing selected features from a literary source with evidence from modern linguistic studies. These investigations generally focus on pronunciation rather than vocabulary or grammar, and they usually fail to recognize the conventional nature of literary dialects. While some of Harrisâs vocabulary compares well with regional forms described in the Dictionary of American Regional English and the Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States, others do not. Harris perhaps best represents the end of the first stage in the evolution of Appalachian English in literature: the comically exaggerated, first-person narrative intended primarily for a regional audience. His work is probably the last published fiction in the nineteenth century that provides a useful source of linguistic evidence.\n\nIn the same year that Sut Lovingood appeared, Sidney Lanier published Tiger Lilies, a novel set in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee and reminiscent of the border romances of Simms. Although Lanier was a native southerner, his literary version of Appalachian English is fairly conventional and derives from the previous generation of southern writers. Lanierâs work is, however, a good example of the tendency among nineteenth-century fiction writers to contrast the standard speech of educated outsiders with the dialect of Appalachian natives.\n\nLocal colorist Mary Noailles Murfree was probably the most influential author of the postbellum period to use a literary version of Appalachian English. Under the pseudonym âCharles Egbert Craddock,â Murfree began publishing short stories with Appalachian settings in the 1870s, although her real success came with the publication of In the Tennessee Mountains (1884), soon followed by The Prophet of the Great Smoky Mountains (1885). Though she made heavy use of literary dialect, like Lanier, she borrowed most of the features she used. She did not, however, reproduce the characteristic grammatical features that would have given her work authenticity. Instead, she relied upon frequent use of a fairly limited number of phonetic spellings and nonstandard grammatical forms.\n\nMurfree was not the only late-nineteenth-century American writer to employ literary dialect, but a comparison of her work with that of her contemporaries reveals more extensive use of it. Murfreeâs work also shows a basic discontinuity between genre and style. In subject matter and tone, her work is akin to that of Simms and Lanier; her frequent use of dialect, however, has much more in common with the Crockett Almanacs and Sut Lovingood. Moreover, her novels were aimed at a general rather than regional audience, and since her fiction was romantic rather than humorous, she relied much less on eye-dialect and much more on phonetic spellings.\n\nFor a northern audience unfamiliar with the actual dialect, Murfreeâs technique may have contributed to a mistaken impression that her representation of speech was more realistic than it actually was. In any given passage of dialogue, Murfree used two or three times as many nonstandard features as writers who portrayed other regional dialects such as James Whitcomb Riley, Hamlin Garland, or Sarah Orne Jewett. Murfree used four to five times as many nonstandard features as Mark Twain did in Huckleberry Finn, published the same year as In the Tennessee Mountains.\n\nA short passage from In the Tennessee Mountains illustrates the density of Murfreeâs technique: âVander war a good blacksmith fur the mountings, but they sot him ter lâarninâ thar. They âlowed, though, ez he war pearterân the peartest. He got ter be powerful popâlar with all the gyards anâ authorities, anâ sech.â In this passage nearly half the words have nonstandard forms. Her only contemporaries to use literary dialect so heavily were those who portrayed African American speech, such as Thomas Nelson Page and Joel Chandler Harris. Murfreeâs literary dialect helped exaggerate the supposed cultural and linguistic divergence of her Appalachian characters.\n\nJohn Fox Jr. adopted techniques used by Murfree in turn-of-the-century works such as The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come (1903) and The Trail of the Lonesome Pine (1908). In his use of literary dialect, Fox was somewhat more restrained than Murfree, although the nonstandard features contained in his representation of Appalachian English were still excessive in comparison to American writers in general. The importance of Foxâs literary dialect, however, goes beyond perpetuation of regional stereotypes through exaggeration. Fox was instrumental in establishing the notion that Appalachian English was a particularly archaic dialect as a consequence of extreme geographic isolation. For example, in his early novella A Mountain Europa (1892), Fox describes a moonshinerâs daughter, Easter Hicks, as one âupon whose lips lingered words and forms of speech that Shakespeare heard and used.â Fox also suggested an archaic Scotch-Irish influence in a 1901 Scribnerâs article in which he observed, âScotch ballads are said to be sung with a Scotch accent.â\n\nThe literary dialects used by Murfree and Fox are of little help in understanding earlier Appalachian English. Both borrowed extensively from earlier writers and are not particularly consistent with each other, but they are important because they influenced popular misconceptions about Appalachian English. Through their fiction, mountaineers and their language became inseparable.\n\nSince the 1930s the techniques used by authors to represent Appalachian English have shifted away from the exaggeration characteristic of nineteenth-century authors. More recent writers who have used Appalachian settings have tended toward restraint in their literary dialects. A partial list of works published from the 1940s to the 1960s includes James Stillâs River of Earth (1940), Jesse Stuartâs Men of the Mountains (1941), and Harriette Simpson Arnowâs The Dollmaker (1954), all set in eastern Kentucky; James Ageeâs A Death in the Family (1957), Wilma Dykemanâs The Tall Woman (1962), and Cormac McCarthyâs The Orchard Keeper (1965), all set in East Tennessee; and John Ehleâs The Land Breakers (1964), set in western North Carolina.\n\nThese authors all depicted dialect speakers but tended to suggest dialect through the occasional use of phonetic spellings or nonstandard grammatical features. This more subtle literary version of Appalachian English is apparent in a passage from Arnowâs The Dollmaker: âReuben warnât lyen. Heâs had a rifle since he was ten years old. Theyâs bear and deer clost to our place back home. Weâre right nigh the edge of a goverâment game preserve. One year the deer eat up my late corn.â\n\nThe reaction against regional stereotypes, including the overuse of literary dialect, is characteristic of most recent Appalachian literature, and since the 1970s the trend seems increasingly to be toward a very minimal use of literary dialect. A selective list of works that generally reflect this trend includes Lee Smithâs Black Mountain Breakdown (1980), set in southwestern Virginia; Denise Giardinaâs The Unquiet Earth (1992), set in West Virginia; Charles Frazierâs Cold Mountain (1997), set in western North Carolina; and Sharyn McCrumbâs The Ballad of Frankie Silver (1998), set along the TennesseeâNorth Carolina border.\n\nIt would be a mistake to overlook the stylistic diversity in the growing body of Appalachian literature, since writers continue to use a variety of techniques in portraying the regional speech of their characters. Ultimately, though, literary dialects are not the same as speech, and they are of very limited value as sources of linguistic evidence. Literary representations of Appalachian English are probably much more valuable in revealing how the work of nineteenth-century authors established common perceptions of the region and its speech.\n\nReferences: Paul Hull Bowdre, Jr., âEye Dialect as a Literary Device,â in A Various Language: Perspectives on American Dialects, ed.

With the advent of better roads and means of transport, significant numbers from Tennessee, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky began moving in the 1920s to closer destinations like Lexington and Cincinnati and then Midwestern cities like Detroit and Chicago. This migration peaked in the 1950s, when one million people left the region, especially for factory work, in a larger movement from the rural South called the Great Migration. Southern Appalachia registered a net loss of population for the first and only time in its history. Migration was a difficult choice because of the strong kinship ties and cultural cohesiveness of rural mountain communities, but remaining in the mountains often meant a life of unemployment or poverty. Economic survival and success came at the price of emotional pain, but many migrants and their descendants minimized this by taking the cultural and speech patterns with them and maintaining family and social connections with the mountains decades after they left.\n\nAppalachian English has common features wherever it is spoken, including in migrant communities in the Midwest. Initial unstressed syllables are often deleted, as in taters âpotatoesâ and maters âtomatoes.â Another important pronunciation is that of âlong iâ in words such as side. In most of the country, the vowel usually consists of two sounds: ah as in father and ee as in beet. In Appalachian English, the second sound is absent, meaning that pie and right sound like pah and raht. Words like tire and fire are pronounced tar and far. Words ending in the unstressed âlong oâ sound are pronounced in er, as in holler âhollowâ and tobaccer âtobacco.â Words ending in an unstressed final sound are pronounced with ee, as in extry âextraâ and Georgy âGeorgia.â The sound system of Appalachian English persists among migrant groups who have been in the Midwest for decades.\n\nThe grammar of Appalachian English also differs from most other varieties of English. For example, Appalachian migrants in Detroit, as well as speakers remaining in the mountains, sometimes add an uh sound to the beginning of words ending in -inâ, as in a-talkinâ and a-runninâ. Both groups make irregular verbs into regular ones, meaning that knowed and throwed or thâowed become the past tense and past participle of know and throw. Appalachian English speakers use some irregular verbs in only one or two forms as principal parts rather than three, as for (do, done, done instead of do, did, done) and give (give, give, give instead of give, gave, given). Appalachian English in the urban North and in the mountains employs double helping verbs, as in I might could go âI might be able to goâ and I might should go âMaybe I should go,â and two-word phrases that intensify an activity or a characteristic, as in Sheâs got a right smart temper âSheâs got a very bad temperâ and The old Griggs place burnt plumb down âThe old Griggs house burned all the way to the ground.â Another common feature is the use of multiple negatives, as in I ainât seen nobody fix nothinâ a-tall âI havenât seen anyone fix anything at allâ and Ainât nobody can get on there âNo one can get a job there.â Many Appalachian migrants in the Midwest also maintain the pronoun youâuns âyou (plural).â\n\nIn Midwestern cities people continue to use such features of pronunciation and grammar to indicate their ties to the mountains, but their Appalachian speech makes them stand out in the Midwest. Because many of these features are stigmatized outside the region, speakers of Appalachian English are frequently stereotyped in the Midwest, where both whites and African Americans often refer to them as hillbillies.\n\nReferences: James S.

Dannenberg, University of Alaska, Anchorage\n\nAppalachian English has long been a stigmatized language variety in American culture. Many non-Appalachians often view Appalachian English as a quaint, antiquated type of English akin to Elizabethan English, while maintaining that it is substandard and indicates a lack of proper education. For native Appalachians, however, attitudes toward their own language are considerably more complex.\n\nMainstream attitudes toward Appalachian English build on social stereotypes that have been ingrained into American society for more than a century and reinforced by modern mass media. Recent images include the 1960s television show The Beverly Hillbillies and the syndicated comic strip Liâl Abner, in which the characters are quite likeable and even possess a certain country wit, resourcefulness, and charm, yet invariably display an ignorance of the wider world and a lack of formal education. These stereotype-reinforcing images create a link to Appalachian (especially southern Appalachian) culture directly through the dialect of the characters. Once the language has gained negative associations, the very use of it can be exploited to convey further stereotypes of the culture. Thus, mainstream attitudes toward Appalachian English are deep-rooted social prejudices.\n\nEven the pronunciation of the regionâs name has been a distinguishing characteristic of Appalachian English, as this humorous poem dedicated to reminding non-natives how to produce it attests:\n\nâSnake,â said Eve,\n\nâIf you try to deceive,\n\nIâll throw this apple-atcha.â\n\nJust as for outsiders an Appalachian dialect conjures up stereotypes and cultural prejudices about the speaker, many native Appalachians decide from the pronunciation of the regionâs name whether or not the speaker is a community insider endowed with all of the defining and valued characteristics of Appalachian culture, including integrity and morality. Native attitudes toward Appalachian English are so indicative of group membership and positive community status within the region that Appalachian speakers often strive to maintain their dialect despite negative associations in mainstream culture, even when living outside the region. For example, a 1997 sociolinguistic study of Appalachian speakers transplanted to urban Ohio revealed that despite being surrounded by a more mainstream speech group with overt language prejudices, Appalachian speakers retained covert prestige language norms in line with non-relocated Appalachians.\n\nStrong symbolic ties between language and group membership, however, can create complex issues with respect to native attitudes toward Appalachian English. Native Appalachians are not always comfortable with their language. While some speakers of Appalachian English, such as those in the Ohio study, actively retain their dialect, others attempt to conform their language to the mainstream. College students from Appalachia enrolled at non-Appalachian universities often renegotiate their identities in order to become socially acceptable. As their identities shift, so do their dialects, creating âidentity ambivalenceâ for them and marking them as âelite outsidersâ to their home community. Their shift in attitude away from Appalachian culture and its speech habits puts them in line with the mainstream, despite the loss of community status.\n\nReferences: Rosina Lippi-Green, English with an Accent: Language, Ideology, and Discrimination in the United States, 1st ed.

When Europeans began moving into the southern Appalachians in the eighteenth century, the Cherokee nation occupied much of western North Carolina, eastern Tennessee, and northern Georgia and sometimes ranged as far north as Virginia and Kentucky. By the early 1800s a shift to Cherokee and English bilingualism had begun among the Cherokee, and since the early twentieth century a radical shift to English monolingualism has taken place.\n\nBy the beginning of the twenty-first century, less than 10 percent of North Carolina Cherokee, primarily middle-aged and older members, spoke the language, which is considered endangered. Major dialects are still found in areas of North Carolina reserved for the Cherokee by the federal government. There are about 1,000 speakers of the Kituwah (or Middle) dialect of the Qualla Cherokee of Swain and Jackson Counties, North Carolina, and close to 150 who speak the Overhill (or Western) dialect of the Snowbird Cherokee of Graham County. About 10,000 Cherokee speakers reside in Oklahoma, descendants of those forcibly marched west during the tragic Trail of Tears in 1838â39.\n\nMuch of this decline of the language is attributable to prejudices of the dominant American culture. Into the 1950s Cherokee children could be beaten or punished severely if they spoke their ancestral language in federally run boarding schools, which had active policies designed to eradicate Cherokee language and culture. This treatment discouraged many Cherokee people from teaching the language to their own children for fear that they too would be punished and humiliated.\n\nWritten Cherokee uses a syllabary that is remarkable among written languages in that it was apparently developed by a single person, Sequoyah. Also known as George Gist, Sequoyah was born in 1760 west of Chilhowee Mountain in Tennessee. Though illiterate himself, Sequoyah was inspired to devise a system for writing Cherokee through his fascination with the âtalking leavesâ used by white traders communicating in English. Using both invented and borrowed characters, he experimented for twelve years and by 1821 had assigned symbols to the eighty-five sounds and sound combinations still used in Cherokee.\n\nWithin a year the Cherokee Nation adopted the syllabary as its official writing system. According to nineteenth-century ethnologist James Mooney, a Cherokee speaker could learn to read and write the language in a few months, and thousands quickly became literate. By 1828 a Cherokee press had been established, publishing the Cherokee Phoenix (a weekly newspaper using the syllabary) and translations of the Bible and other books. Although a majority of Cherokee use the syllabary, Cherokee can also be written with English letters. The syllabary consists of six vowel sounds, the consonant s, and seventy-eight combinations of consonants and vowels. Every syllable ends with a vowel sound. Vowel pronunciations are as follows: a as in father, e as in day, o as in goat, i as in machine, u as in rule, and a nasally produced v as the vowel sound in tug. Each vowel can have either strong or weak stress and either long or short duration. Long vowels have about twice the duration of short vowels, as seen in short vowel of ama âsaltâ and the long vowel of aama âwater.â There are also pitch differences in the pronunciation of vowels, with the last vowel of each word nasalized.\n\nCherokee has consonants similar to English j, s, t d, k, g, m, n, l, y, w, and h, but it differs from English in having no sounds resembling p and b. Cherokee has a glottal sound, which resembles a catch in the throat (as the middle sound in English uh-oh); a voiceless l (sounded like English l preceded by h); tl (like English l but with the tip of the tongue in position to make a t sound); ts (as in the end of the English word eats); ch (as in English church); kw (as in English queen); and gw (as in English Gwen).\n\nCherokee grammar is highly complex. Nouns are similar to those of English in that they represent a person, place, or thing, but Cherokee nouns are divided into two classes: animate and inanimate. In Cherokee, prefixes or suffixes added to nouns are equivalent to articles and adjectives in English. Although Cherokee pronouns do not specify he, she or it, nouns are gender specific, and there are content words for mother, father, boy, girl, man, woman, and similar equivalents in English.\n\nVerbs are the most important part of every Cherokee sentence and are either active or stative. Active verbs refer to a action performed by someone, e.g., jiwoniha âI am talking.â Stative verbs refer to passive states or to actions performed on a recipient individual or group by someone other than the speaker. Each verb must have one or more prefixes followed by a root and at least one suffix. Additional prefixes and suffixes can alter the meanings further.\n\nVerbs in Cherokee show great attention to details of the physical world and reflect a way of seeing and interpreting the world that is different from English. For example, the Cherokee way of expressing âto hand something to someoneâ depends on the nature of the object being handed: gvnea means âI hand you something nondescriptâ (probably solid); gvdea, âI hand you something long and inflexibleâ; gvnvnea, âI hand you something floppy or flexibleâ (such as a cloth); and gvnevsi, âI hand you something liquid.â\n\nThe Cherokee are working to preserve and revitalize their rich and fascinating language, and it is recognized and taught in the schools within Cherokee communities. However, since many Cherokee still do not speak the language at home or on a regular basis, its future in North Carolina is by no means secure.\n\nReferences: Margaret Bender, Signs of Cherokee Culture: Sequoyahâs Syllabary in Eastern Cherokee Life (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2002); William Harlen Gilberrt, The Eastern Cherokees (Washington: G.P.O., 1942); James Mooney, History, Myths, and Sacred Formulas of the Cherokee (Washington, DC: Bureau of American Ethnology, 1891); Sharlotte Neely, Snowbird Cherokees: People of Persistence (Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1991).\n\nColonial Survivals in Appalachian Speech\n\nTed R. Ledford, Lees-McRae College\n\nContrary to the popular view that it is Shakespearean in character, Appalachian folk speech is much closer to the language of colonial America. It has preserved a record of colonial speech unequaled in any other American region, largely due to Appalachiaâs relative physical isolation during much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.\n\nDiffering agreement patterns between subject and verb (as in âWe went to hunt for the horses which was lostâ; âSnails is large and commonâ; and âTwo files was demanded by the Indiansâ), which were once standard usage in the north of England and in the Scottish Lowlands, were also common in the writings of colonial America. Such constructions appeared in the speech of Appalachian natives well after their disappearance from mainstream American English. In present-day Appalachia there are still survivals from colonial pronunciation. A final r in such mountain terms as winder âwindowâ and piller âpillowâ have their counterparts in colonial writings (vaniller âvanillaâ; holler âhollowâ; musquetters âmosquitoesâ), as does the intrusive r so frequent in Appalachian speech (corked âcaulkedâ; orning âawningâ). The Appalachian tendency for r to modify the pronunciation of the preceding vowel (tar âtireâ; har âhairâ; arish taters âIrish potatoesâ) resembles phonetic spellings found in colonial writings.\n\nOther language peculiar to mountain speech that appears in colonial-era writings include tushes âtusks,â pizen âpoison,â and dost âdose.â Appalachian speech still has expressions like bubbies âfemale breasts,â and residents still hold a ladder to study âsteadyâ it while another person climbs. Colonial writings by literate but not highly educated people contain these and a host of other expressions still used in Appalachia that the remainder of the country thinks are quaint. Seemingly Elizabethan English can occasionally be found in the mountains (Shakespeare wrote yers for âears,â for example), but southern Appalachia has much more in common with the eighteenth-century language of the nationâs founding fathers.\n\nReferences: Nicholas Biddle, ed., The Journals of the Expedition under the Command of Captains Lewis and Clark (1814); Frederic G.

While the emerging standard German (written German) was the language of newspapers, almanacs, educational materials, and religious sermons, German immigrants spoke a variety of German in their daily life regardless of religious affiliation. By contrast, the survival of the language in contemporary Appalachia is dependent on the survival of two conservative, separatist Anabaptist sects, the Old Order Amish and Old Order Mennonites.\n\nWilliam Pennâs promise of religious tolerance in the colony of Pennsylvania first enticed German-speaking Protestant groups that did not enjoy the protection or toleration of political authorities in Europe. Mennonites, Amish, Dunkers, Schwenckfelders, and Moravians started new lives in Pennsylvania. From the first settlement at Germantown, northwest of Philadelphia, in 1683, these colonists settled the counties of southeastern Pennsylvania (Lancaster, Lehigh, Berks, Northampton, Chester, York) and ultimately extended into more westerly counties (Mifflin, Somerset, Centre, etc.) Lutheran and Reformed Germans, motivated by escape from wars and poverty, soon followed earlier seekers of religious freedom. Within a few decades, these so-called non-sectarian Germans would vastly outnumber all other German church communities. By 1776, speakers of some form of German as their mother tongue made up one-third of the population of Pennsylvania, between 150,000 and 200,000 people.\n\nGerman-speaking colonists originated primarily in the southwestern part of the German language area. The majority stemmed from the Palatinate, though there were significant numbers from Switzerland, Wurttemberg, Alsace, Westphalia, and Hesse. Lively interaction between speakers of varying background resulted in leveling their dialects towards a relatively homogenous, new dialect of German made further distinct by borrowings (?? âscreen door; fenceâ) and adaptations (as am tshumbe âjumping,â shpell âspellâ) of lexical items from American English.\n\nWhile Pennsylvania German is commonly referred to as Pennsylvania Dutch, this designation is misleading, having been produced by English speakers who misinterpreted the German dialectal form Deitsch âGerman.â By the end of the nineteenth century, 600,000 speakers of Pennsylvania German lived in the state, most of them nonsectarian German Americans. At that time, conservative Anabaptists, who were religious separatists, represented only a fraction of German speakers (e.g., there were only 3,700 Old Order Amish in Pennsylvania in 1890). But at the close of the twentieth century, the Pennsylvania German language was nearly extinct among nonsectarian speakers, while the population of Anabaptist sects continued to increase. The latter groups have kept the German dialect alive by rigidly separating their world into two domains: inside the group, Pennsylvania German is the sole means of oral expression; outside the group, English serves as the medium of communication, and all forms of writing take place in English. Even as Pennsylvania German approaches extinction among nonsectarians, the dialect continues to grow among Old Order Anabaptists, an estimated 26,000 of whom were speaking it regularly at the beginning of the twenty-first century.\n\nA second large cluster of German dialect speakers was located in Virginiaâs Shenandoah Valley. The valley was settled almost exclusively by migration from southeastern and south-central Pennsylvania and from Maryland. The Adam Miller family, formerly of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, established the first permanent German settlement in 1726 near modern-day Elkton,Virginia. Many other families of various religious backgrounds followed. By the time of the American Revolution, German speakers from Pennsylvania inhabited large portions of Rockingham, Shenandoah, Frederick, Augusta, and Page Counties in northwestern Virginia, as well as and Hardy Counties in present-day West Virginia. At that time, they comprised more than 5 percent of the total population of Virginia, with most German colonists having settled in the Shenandoah Valley.\n\nDuring the eighteenth century, the German language was used in both public and private domains, in newspapers, churches, and schools. Even a comprehensive collection of Virginia laws was translated into Standard German. By the mid-nineteenth century, however, English had replaced German in nearly all public functions. While the spoken language, a variant of the Pennsylvania German dialect, continued its vitality much longer, only a few very elderly individuals in Virginia belonging to Lutheran and Reformed churches were able to speak and understand it at the outset of the twenty-first century. Most lived in the Bergton-Criders area of Rockingham county or the Jerome-Orkney sections of Shenandoah county. A few others remained in the Propst Gap and Brushy Fork sections of Pendleton County, West Virginia.\n\nIn the 1940s, a small group of Pennsylvania Germanâ speaking Old Order Amish settled in the StauntonâStuartâs Draft area of Virginia. But in the last forty years of the twentieth century, most of their young people left their conservative roots and lifestyle along with the German dialect. Exact numbers of German speakers in the Shenandoah Valley are difficult to determine, but migration into the valley was numerically small, making these migrants highly susceptible to cultural and linguistic assimilation. As the language disappeared from Lutheran communities, however, a few Old Older Amish families who still learned Pennsylvania German as their first language moved into the mountain regions of Bland, Giles, Tazewell, and Washington Counties, assuring that German would continue to be spoken in southwestern Virginia.\n\nBetween 1848 and 1885, German was the main language spoken in Wartburg in Morgan County, Tennessee, but marriages to English-only speakers and the replacement of German by English in church services signaled the demise of the German language there. By 1970, only a few of the oldest residents in Wartburg and adjacent areas spoke any German dialect at all.\n\nReferences: Christopher Dolmetsch, Deutsch als Muttersprache in den Vereinigten staaten (Wiesbaden: Steiner, 1985); C.

From the 1930s to the 1970s he observed and recorded traditional speech in the Smoky Mountains of East Tennessee and western North Carolina. In his first area of study, phonetics, he produced the most detailed description of the pronunciation of any variety of American English, but as he came to know mountain people, his interests expanded rapidly. His collections were diverse, encompassing terminology of all kinds, hunting tales and other anecdotes, proverbs, folklore, instrumental and vocal music, and many other types of material.\n\nWhen the federal government acquired the land that was to become the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, many older residents were allowed to remain on their property for the remainder of their lives. In 1937 Hall, who spent much of his academic career at Pasadena City College in California, was offered a summer job documenting the lives and lore of these mountain residents. Assisted by the Civilian Conservation Corps, he sought out and recorded mountain natives born as early as 1843 and documented the lives and speech of more than one hundred individuals in communities no longer on the map. Over half of his lifetime, he amassed a collection of material on mountain life unsurpassed in its richness, comprehensiveness, and detail.\n\nPrior to Hallâs work, scholars were often interested only in confirming romantic notions about the archaic or supposed Elizabethan character of mountain English and had written about mountaineers en masse, generalizing about them and their speech. Hall approached his subjects without preconceptions and always identified the communities and the individuals from which his material came. Where he found local or generational differences in speech, he noted these. Not surprisingly, he discounted the view that mountain people spoke âElizabethan English,â instead finding it much more varied and innovative than commonly thought. As the pioneer researcher of the speech and culture of the Great Smokies, Hall let people speak for themselves, setting a standard for scholarship in Appalachian English.\n\nReferences: Joseph S.

Hall, Dictionary of Smoky Mountain English (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2004).\n\nIroquoian Languages\n\nBruce L. Pearson, University of South Carolina\n\nA number of Northern Iroquoian languages were present in northern Appalachia during the 1700s. Best known are the languages of the Iroquois Five Nations of New York State located originally in the Mohawk Valley and consisting of the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga and Seneca tribesâall perched on the northernmost fringe of Appalachia. Whether these languages were spoken beyond the MohawkValley prior to European contact is unknown. In the 1720s, remnants of the Tuscarora, an Iroquoian tribe from eastern North Carolina, joined the Iroquois Confederacy.\n\nOf these tribes, the Seneca were present from time to time in what is now Pennsylvania and West Virginia. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, a band calling themselves Mingoes and claiming Seneca descent still lived in West Virginia. The Susquehannocks, a Northern Iroquoian tribe separate from the original Five Nations, lived along the Susquehanna River in central Pennsylvania and thus would have the strongest claim to Appalachia, but they had disappeared by the mid-1700s as a result of European diseases such as smallpox and conflicts with other natives and American vigilante groups.\n\nThe Onondaga, Oneida, and one branch of the Seneca tribe have held onto portions of their ancestral lands in New York State, while the Mohawk and Cayuga tribes are now divided between the United States and Canada. One branch of the Oneida tribe is now located in Wisconsin, and branches of the Seneca and Cayuga tribes are located in oklahoma. Mohawk has the most contemporary speakers, as many as two thousand, but all tribes continue efforts to preserve interest in the language by publishing traditional narratives in bilingual editions.\n\nThe Wyandots, another Northern Iroquoian group that originated in Canada and had settled in Ohio by the late 1700s, moved into and out of Appalachia along with other displaced tribes. The grammatical structure of Wyandot is similar to the other Northern Iroquoian languages, which in turn are related to the Southern Iroquoian branch represented today only by Cherokee.\n\nWyandot, like the other Northern Iroquoian languages, is built around verb roots compounded in various ways. Prefixes specify location, direction, or repetition of an action, while suffixes indicate whether an action occurred a single time, has been completed, and the like. Additional prefixes identify the individual(s) involved in the action and, in the case of transitive verbs, both the subject and object. Thus the root -yo- can mean âcomeâ or âgoâ depending on the prefix. With ta- âtowardâ and hi- âthe two,â the form ta-hi-yo-â means âthe two came here.â With ha- âawayâ and in- âwe two,â the form ha-in-yo-â means âwe two will go there.â The final apostrophe represents a glottal stop (the sound that occurs in the English expression uh-oh) and signifies a one-time event as opposed to a recurring event or a completed event. The personal prefixes in these examples specify two people, a category distinct from both singular (one) and plural (three or more).\n\nPersonal prefixes denoting both subject and object can be illustrated by the forms a-yom-ateduto-â âI ask of youâ and aâ-sk-ateduto-â âtell me,â in which the prefix yom- represents âIâ as subject and âyouâ as object, while sk- represents âyouâ as subject and âmeâ as object. The final apostrophe in both examples denotes a one-time event. The a- prefix indicates something desired, while the aâ- prefix suggests a demand.\n\nThe Wyandots were relocated to Kansas following the Indian Removal Act of 1830. One group, the Wyandot Nation of Kansas, remains in the Kansas City area, while the Wyandotte Nation of Oklahoma is based in northeastern Oklahoma. The language is known primarily from a compilation of forty narratives collected in 1911â12 by Canadian folklorist Marius Barbeau. The last speaker of Wyandot died in Oklahoma around 1950. In recent years the tribe has used the Barbeau collection and other materials in a continuing effort to learn more about the language of its ancestors.\n\nReferences: Floyd G.

Trigger (1978).\n\nKephart, Horace (1862â1931) Librarian, writer, and scholar\n\nKarl Nicholas, Western Carolina University\n\nHorace Kephartâs contribution to the understanding of Appalachian speech consists of two published works and a considerable body of notes. His magnum opus, Our Southern Highlanders, published by Outing in 1913 and augmented by Macmillan in 1922, contains a chapter devoted to âThe Mountain Dialect,â and his article âA Word-List from the Mountains of North Carolinaâ appeared in Dialect Notes in 1917. Unpublished notes are housed in the Kephart Collection in the archives of the Hunter Library at Western Carolina University in Cullowhee, North Carolina. A lexicon of Appalachian speech based on these materials and prepared by Harold Farwell and Karl Nicholas was published by the University Press of Kentucky as Smoky Mountain Voices in 1993.\n\nKephart lived and wrote in the Smoky Mountains of North Carolina during the first three decades of the twentieth centuryâa time when the distinctive dialect of the isolated mountaineers was still unsullied by mass communication or ease of travel. Trained as a librarian, Kephart compulsively recorded his daily observations of mountain life, first on note cards and then in notebooks. These notes were at first a restorative exercise for him, as he had come to the mountains in 1904 after suffering a nervous breakdownâvery likely the result of his arduous duties as head librarian at the St. Louis Mercantile Library, the position he had held since 1890. Eventually his observations turned into a new occupation, for he never returned to library work, supporting himself instead by writing, chiefly articles for outdoor magazines dealing with camping, hunting, and woodlore.\n\nKephart lived first in Dillsboro and then in Hazel Creek, North Carolina, until 1907. He left these locales briefly to travel throughout the southern Appalachians, comparing the lives and folkways of the mountaineers he encountered with those he had become familiar with in the Smokies. Returning to North Carolina in 1910, he took up residence in Bryson City, where he remained until his death in an auto accident in 1931. The last years of his life were spent actively lobbying for the establishment of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\n\nKephartâs painstaking scholarshipâas evidenced by his copious notes, extensive reading, and determination to check and compare his observations firsthandâsets him apart from the local color writers of the time. To be sure, he read the local colorists, but his observationsâparticularly those dealing with mountain dialectâconsistently exhibit a depth of analysis far beyond those of his contemporaries. His chapter in Our Southern Highlanders is the first serious treatment of Appalachian speech beyond a few desultory word lists. His fascination with relic forms (betwixt\n\nâbetweenâ; fernent ânear toâ) helped to promote the erroneous notion that mountain speech was largely Elizabethan, but his equal attention to such matters as learned terms in mountain speech (discern âseeâ; recollect ârememberâ) and linguistic innovations (antigadlin and slantdicular âout of plumbâ; hickey âunknown objectâ) clearly mark him as an uncommon and influential observer. Kephartâs detailed and dispassionate observations relied on recorded fact, not fancy or impressions, making his contribution to the study of Appalachian English a lasting one.\n\nReferences: Harold F.

Karl Nicholas, eds., Smoky Mountain Voices: A Lexicon of Southern Appalachian Speech Based on the Research of Horace Kephart (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 1993); Horace Kephart, Our Southern Highlanders (New York: Macmillan, 1913; revised 1922).\n\nLanguage and Gender\n\nAnita Puckett, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University\n\nScholars often view gender as a social category comparable to ethnicity and socioeconomic class1 rather than a biological description. In this context, traits of gender emerge from social interactions, with language playing a critical role. There has been little research in the area of language and gender relations in southern Appalachia, but existing studies suggest three areas in which language plays a significant roleârequests, literacy, and verbal lore.\n\nAs elsewhere, men and women in Appalachia differ subtly but significantly in the way they make requests of others. The genders construct the grammar and rhetoric of requests according to the status of the persons making and receiving a request and the nature of the item or service requested.\n\nRequests are usually phrased as a want or need. Want-requests are more self-focused and political, frequently asserting authority, power, or privilege. Need requests connote a social purpose in which compliance benefits a number of people. When someone says, âI want a truck,â he or she is expressing a different intent and purpose than when he or she says, âI need a truck.â Men tend to use want-requests more than women; young children use poorly formed want-requests extensively. Requests in much of the region are indirect rather than direct. Residents of close-knit communities assume they know each other well enough to provide wants and needs without being asked. The use of order-requesting imperative forms (as in âMove your truck!â) is highly restricted. They tend to occur when the right to make a want-request is clear or when a need-request is within the rights of the person demanding (for example, when a husband says to his wife, âFix me my supperâ). Otherwise, indirect verbal structures are used to make requests and may take the form of a narrative that parallels something the requestee can do or provide; a woman, for instance, may describe to another woman the way her mother cooked something in hopes the listener will cook the dish the same way. At other times a third party may make a need known to someone capable of meeting it. Direct requests using ask, beg, or other requesting verbs usually require the requestor to be in a close relationship with the requestee. The requestor then has the ârightâ to ask and is considered in her or his âplace.â Direct requests also occur when speakers have developed strong claims on each other and tend to take place among kin.\n\nWith few exceptions, research indicates that items or services women have the ârightâ to request fall into the following domains: the bearing of, caring for, and rearing of children; domestic spaces and activities; food preparation and related activities; healing and caring for the sick; literacy activities; and spiritual or moral matters involving church activities or the evaluation of peopleâs behavior. Women answer and make most telephone calls. Men tend to have authority and control over matters related to money, machinery, politics, land transactions, and outdoor activities. Many patterns in request usage are changing as more women find jobs outside the home in which they work together with men.\n\nIn many southern Appalachian communities, gender also plays a role in literacy activity. Traditionally, men have tended to avoid reading and writing activities beyond those related to practical use, such as instructions. Women are more apt to read novels, write invitations or letters, send cards, or make extensive use of e-mail, among other reading and writing activities. Although the rise in information technology jobs has encouraged men to use computer keyboards, many still strongly resist writing extended prose. Women may be much more likely to do so.\n\nThese culturally influenced variations in literacy contribute to a gender-based division of labor (for example, men repair computers or use them for finding information while women key in data). These patterns can negatively impact menâs access to high-paying professional positions that require extensive reading or writing, but women also have limited access to jobs that require authority over others, especially men, despite their greater mastery of literacy. Many women will not take such a job, or do not keep it, if the position requires that they violate their âplaceâ with respect to both men and women.\n\nStudies suggest gender differences in verbal lore traditions as well. Women tend to learn singing and storytelling traditions from their mothers, grandmothers, or aunts; men acquire traditions from fathers, grandfathers, or uncles. Women often tell their tales only to their children or close family members and typically feature women resisting the patriarchal dominance that characterizes the region. Appalachian storytellers such as North Carolinians Angelyn deBord and Bessie Eldreth and Kentuckian Octavia Sexton replace or usurp dominant male heroes or trickster figures with strong female leads. For example, one of Sextonâs female characters uses male strategies to get back at her lazy husband, while Eldreth asserts womenâs self-worth by telling of women who perform kind and valuable services to others. In contrast, renowned storytellers Ray and Orville Hicks presented tales in which the central male character exercises straightforward guile, wit, or authority over others in ways that reinforce male dominance. Genderization of storytelling therefore suggests that many women use this form of oral literature to covertly contest or resist patriarchal norms.\n\nReferences: Bill Ellis, âThe Gentry-Long Tradition and Roots of Revivalism: Maud Gentry Long,â in Jack in Two Worlds: Contemporary North America"
