        "text": "@ The Movies With Mark Hinson\n\nFriday-only times provided by theater websites and may have changed. Check www.fandango.com.\n\nNEW THIS WEEK: “Chef,” “Maleficent,” “A Million Ways To Die in the West,” “One Day Pina Asked”\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man 2\n\nPG-13, 141 minutes. Action violence, scary special effects, ending may disturb young viewers.\n\nAndrew Garfield, Emma Stone. Spidey, who just graduated from high school with his sweetheart, is in for a shock when a nerdy technician is bitten by angry electric eels (don’t ask) and is turned into Electro, a current-slurping supervillain with anger issues who must be hell on the monthly utility bill. Sure, this sequel is far too busy, too long and crowded with too many subplots but it has a loopy charm that keeps it from causing the dreaded Marvel-fatigue. With Jamie Foxx, Denis Leary, Martin Sheen, Sally Field, Jim Carrey, Chris Cooper, Stan Lee and Felicity Jones. Directed by Marc Webb (“(500) Days of Summer”), who was a guest at Seven Days of Opening Nights in 2009. (B-)\n\nGovernors Square: 12:20, 3:35, 6:50, 10:05\n\nTallahassee Mall: 10:30 a.m., 1:45, 5, 8:15, 11:30\n\nBelle\n\nPG, 104 minutes. Racial insults, mature themes.\n\nGugu Mbatha-Raw, Matthew Goode. Based on a true story, a racially mixed daughter of an English Royal Navy Admiral in the 18th century is raised by her reluctant, racist, aristocratic family in high society but the trouble really starts when she falls in love with a white man in this historical costume drama. With Emily Watson, Tom Wilkinson and Miranda Richardson. Directed by newcomer Amma Asante.\n\nTallahassee Mall: 10:30 a.m., 1, 3:30, 6, 8:30, 11\n\nBlended\n\nPG-13, 117 minutes. Profanity, violence, rude humor, sex jokes, insults to viewer intelligence.\n\nAdam Sandler, Drew Barrymore. A widower dad and a newly divorced mom, who went on one disastrous blind date, end up sharing the same luxurious resort with their kids in Africa in this romantic comedy. If you can get past the story’s sticky, lazy, cloying sentimental streak, there is another level of cliched, insulting humor about Africans and Africa — you know the place where an orchestra of live monkeys plays oldies for rich American tourist during dinner. With Kevin Nealon, Joel McHale and Shaquille O'Neal. Directed by Frank Coraci (“The Wedding Singer,” “Click,” “The Waterboy”), who seems more concerned with product placements for Hooter’s than scoring any laughs. Horrible stuff. (D-)\n\nGovernors Square: 1:20, 4:30, 7:50, 10:45\n\nTallahassee Mall: 12:15, 3, 5:45, 7:15, 8:30, 11:15\n\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier\n\nPG-13, 136 minutes. Intense violence, loud explosions.\n\nChris Evans, Scarlett Johansson. As superhero Captain America tries to adjust to modern-day life in Washington, D.C., a high-ranking official in the secretive SHIELD agency who has world domination on his mind stirs up a hornet’s nest of cabals, hired killers and double spies. The action-comic book genre gets a dose of ‘70s-style conspiracy movies. With Stan Lee, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Samuel L. Jackson and Robert Redford.\n\nIMAX: 7\n\nMovies 8: noon, 3, 6:45, 9:35\n\nTallahassee Mall: 10\n\nChef\n\nR, 115 minutes. Profanity, sexual content.\n\nJon Favreau, Emjay Anthony. After a celebrity chef in Los Angeles pitches a tirade over a food critic, and the rant goes viral on YouTube, he tries to put his life and family back together by going back to basics in a food truck. Written and directed by Favreau (“Elf,” “Iron Man”). With Dustin Hoffman, Oliver Platt, Bobby Cannavale, John Leguizamo, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson and Sofía Vergara. Opens today.\n\nTallahassee Mall: 11 a.m., 2, 4:45, 7:45, 10:45\n\nDivergent\n\nPG-13, 139 minutes. Violence, torture, sexual assault, scary special effects.\n\nShailene Woodley, Kate Winslet. Set in a dystopian future in a totalitarian Chicago, a teenager takes a required aptitude test that does not go as planned, so she joins the warrior class to undergo brutal boot-camp training. Based on the best-selling series of young adult novels by Veronica Roth. The social message about individualism and non-conformity is hammered home with Ayn Randian subtlety. With Theo James, Ashley Judd, Maggie Q and Mekhi Phifer. Directed by Neil Burger (“The Illusionist”). (C+)\n\nIMAX: 9:30\n\nTallahassee Mall: 4\n\nGodzilla\n\nPG-13, 123 minutes. Extreme action violence, scary special effects, angry monsters.\n\nBryan Cranston, Aaron Johnson. In this reboot of the Japanese classic from the ‘50s, an American engineer in a Japanese nuclear plant discovers that an earlier accident was actually caused by a giant monster and the government is trying to cover it up. Directed by Gareth Edwards (“Monsters”), who steals liberally from Steven Spielberg’s playbook. Sure, the plot has some serious holes and Johnson is wooden as the hero but the monster fights and special effects are top shelf. Ease up, it’s a summer popcorn spectacle starring a giant lizard. With Elizabeth Olsen, Ken Watanabe, Juliette Binoche, David Strathairn and Andy Serkis. (B)\n\nGovernors Square: 12:45, 4, 7:15, 10:15\n\nTallahassee Mall: 10:30 a.m., noon, 1:30, 3, 4:30, 6, 7:30, 9, 10:30, midnight\n\nIsland of Lemurs: Madagascar 3D\n\nG, 40 minutes. Destructive humans with matches.\n\nAcademy Award-winning actor Morgan Freeman narrates this story about the lemurs’ ancient past (they arrived on their island home more than 60 million years ago when the last of the dinosaurs were still around) and their uncertain future (the folks who live on Madagascar keep burning down the rain forests for farm land). But who can resist the wide-eyed, bouncy primates who look like they are dancing when they are running? Younger kids will eat it up. (B+)\n\nIMAX: 11 a.m., 1, 3, 5\n\nJerusalem\n\nG, 45 minutes. Nothing objectionable.\n\nThree teenage girls from different religions (Muslim, Christian, Jewish) offer a guided tour of their hometown neighborhoods and customs in the ancient city where Jesus and Muhammed once tread. This politics-free travelogue from the National Geographic has gaping holes (why show a remote monastery but not give its name?) but it does capture the claustrophobic vibrancy of one of the world's most fought-over cities. Recommended for younger audiences or pilgrims who don't like the heat or dust. (B)\n\nIMAX: 6\n\nThe LEGO Movie\n\nPG, 100 minutes. Violence, scary special effects.\n\nVoices of Chris Pratt, Will Ferrell. An everyday construction worker who lives in a corporate-run conformist society, where the favorite song is “Everything is Awesome,” has his world rocked when he discovers a secret prophecy that will overthrow the dictator. This computer-animated meta-action pic is downright giddy with its barrage of jokes and satire of Hollywood blockbusters. And it delivers much more of a thrill ride than those last three “Star Wars” movies (which are skewered with delight). A ton of fun, though it goes on a tad too long. With Morgan Freeman, Nick Offerman, Liam Neeson, Elizabeth Banks and Jonah Hill. (B+)\n\nMovies 8: 12:10, 2:20, 4:30, 7, 9:15\n\nMaleficent\n\nPG, 98 minutes. Violence, scary special effects, sharp needle.\n\nAngelina Jolie, Elle Fanning. An angry, powerful fairy — who sports a black-horned headpiece — places a curse on the king’s beautiful daughter that threatens to throw the kingdom into forever darkness in this live-action fairy tale from Disney. Think of it as a revisionist take on “Sleeping Beauty.” With Sam Riley, Lesley Manville, Imelda Staunton, Janet McTeer and Juno Temple. Directed by newcomer Robert Stromberg, the production designer for “Avatar” (2009). Opens today.\n\nGovernors Square: noon, 1, 1:50, 2:35, 4, 4:40, 7, 7:30, 8, 9:45, 10:10, 10:40\n\nTallahassee Mall: 10 a.m., 10:45 a.m., 11:30 a.m., noon, 12:30, 1:15, 2, 3, 3:45, 4:30, 5, 5:30, 6:15, 7, 7:30, 8, 8:45, 9:30, 10, 10:30, 11:15\n\nMillion Dollar Arm\n\nPG, 123 minutes. Mild sexual humor and innuendo.\n\nJon Hamm, Lake Bell. In an effort to save his career, an American sports agent stages a pitching contest and recruits cricket players from a small town in India to become baseball pitchers in the American Major Leagues. Culture-clashing sports comedy-drama directed by Craig Gillespie (“Lars and the Real Girl,” “Mr. Woodcock”). Yes, it’s schmaltzy and entirely predictable but it’s done with such feel-good, kind-hearted humor that you won’t mind being manipulated. With Aasif Mandvi, Suraj Sharma, Madhur Mittal, Bill Paxton (who is quite funny as a droll coach) and Alan Arkin. (B)\n\nGovernors Square: 1:05, 4:20, 7:35, 10:30\n\nTallahassee Mall: 11:15 a.m., 2:15, 5:15, 8:15, 11:15\n\nA Million Ways to Die in the West\n\nR, 116 minutes. Foul language, violence, lewd humor, strong sexual content, drug use.\n\nSeth MacFarlane, Charlize Theron. After a sheep farmer is publicly shamed for shunning a gun fight in the Wild West, he gets help from a beautiful sharpshooter until her outlaw husband shows up in this bawdy horse-opera spoof. Directed by MacFarlane (“Ted”). With Sarah Silverman, Liam Neeson, Neil Patrick Harris, Amanda Seyfried and Giovanni Ribisi. Opens today.\n\nGovernors Square: 12:50, 4:10, 7:20, 10:25\n\nTallahassee Mall: 10:15 a.m., 11:45, 1:15, 2:45, 4:15, 5:45, 7:15, 8:45, 9:30, 10:15, 11:45\n\nMister Peabody & Sherman\n\nPG, 92 minutes. Violence, scary action sequences.\n\nVoices of Ty Burrell, Max Charles. An intelligent, talking dog and his adopted human son hop into a time machine that whisks them off for adventures in the French Revolution, ancient Egypt, the Renaissance and the Trojan wars in this animated action-comedy. Based on the “Peabody’s Improbable History” shorts that were a part of the “The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show” in the early ’60s.\n\nMovies 8: 12:30, 2:40, 4:55, 7:15, 9:20\n\nThe Monuments Men\n\nPG-13, 118 minutes. Profanity, war violence.\n\nGeorge Clooney, Matt Damon. During World War II, an American art historian assembles a team of middle-aged experts to save European treasures before the Nazis can burn them or steal them to stock Hitler’s Fuhrer Museum in Austria. Based on a true story and directed by Clooney, who is not afraid to trot out plenty of war-movie cliches and predictable characters. The all-star cast includes Cate Blanchett, Bill Murray, John Goodman and Bob Balaban; but it’s a bit of a disappointing snooze. It feels like a classroom history lesson rather than a living, breathing war story. (B-)\n\nMovies 8: 12:45, 3:15, 6:50, 9:40\n\nMuppets Most Wanted\n\nPG, 112 minutes. Comic violence, bad Russian caricatures.\n\nTina Fey, Ricky Gervais. During a tour of the stages in Europe, a dastardly criminal who looks exactly like Kermit the Frog pulls off a series of daring heists in art museums while the real Kermit is locked up in a gulag in Siberia. The musical numbers are a witty hoot but most of the jokes fall flat. With Tony Bennett, Salma Hayek, Lady Gaga, Stanley Tucci, Christoph Waltz, Usher, Sean “Diddy” Combs and Zach Galifianakis as Hobo Joe. (B-)\n\nMovies 8: 11:50 a.m., 2:10, 4:50, 7:10, 9:30\n\nNeighbors\n\nR, 96 minutes. Foul language, crude humor, strong sexual content, nudity, constant drug use.\n\nSeth Rogen, Zac Efron. After a debauched, party-hearty fraternity moves in next door to a young family, the husband and wife decide to fight back in this crude, crotch-obsessed college comedy. If you can contract an STD through cinema, this may be the movie to do it. Most of the gross jokes fall flat or so far-fetched that they don’t connect; such as a breast-milk gag that is painful to watch. With Rose Byrne, Lisa Kudrow, Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Hannibal Buress. Directed by Nicholas Stoller (the passable lewd lark “Get Him to the Greek”). (D)\n\nGovernors Square: 12:05, 2:40, 8:05, 10:35\n\nTallahassee Mall: 11:15 a.m., 1:45, 4:15, 7, 10:15, 12:15 a.m.\n\nNon-Stop\n\nPG-13, 106 minutes. Profanity, violence, smoking.\n\nLiam Neeson, Julianne Moore. During a transatlantic flight from New York City to London, an armed, boozy Air Marshal is in a race against time against a clever terrorist who is threatening to kill a passenger every 20 minutes unless he is paid millions of dollars. The umpteen red herrings tossed in the air in this Hitchcock riff could beat the fish-flingers in Pike Place Market. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, who is best known for such horror flicks as \"Orphan\" (2009) and \"House of Wax\" (2005). Hey, at least you won't ever have to watch it as an in-flight movie. (C)\n\nMovies 8: 12:05, 2:25, 5, 7:30, 9:55\n\nOne Day Pina Asked (1983)\n\nNot rated, 57 minutes. Some nudity, copious smoking.\n\nBelgian filmmaker Chantal Akerman follows German dance icon Pina Bausch and her pack of rail-thin performers around Europe during a 1983 tour. Akerman‘s camera gets into close quarters, onstage and backstage, with the dancers and the results are almost unbearably intimate. This little-seen, visually acute documentary is a must for any serious dance fan. Subtitled. (B+)\n\nAll Saints Cinema: 6 (5 on Saturday and Sunday)\n\nThe Other Woman\n\nR, 109 minutes. Profanity, rude humor, sexual content, vomiting for laughs.\n\nLeslie Mann, Cameron Diaz. In this badly misfired sex farce, an annoying housewife teams up with her cheating husband’s girlfriend, a high-rolling attorney in Manhattan who resembles Hello Kitty, to discover the philandering dog’s new mistress (the acting-impaired Kate Upton). You know a movie is not working when pop-singer Nicki Minaj is the best actress onscreen. Mann (“This is 40”) tries to save this dud by throwing in lots of physical comedy but it just makes her look desperate. Directed by Nick Cassavetes (“She’s So Lovely”). (D)\n\nGovernors Square: 5:15\n\nTallahassee Mall: 4:45, 7:30\n\nThe Railway Man\n\nR, 116 minutes. Profanity, extreme violence, excruciating torture scenes.\n\nColin Firth, Nicole Kidman. During the ‘80s, a troubled Englishman, who was nearly tortured to death building a railway in Thailand and Burma during World War II, returns to Asia to confront his chief tormentor. Yes, it’s the same railway project featured in David Lean classic “The Bridge on the River Kwai” (1957). With Stellan Skarsgard, Hiroyuki Sanada and Jeremy Irvine.\n\nTallahassee Mall: 11:15 a.m., 2\n\nRio 2\n\nG, 95 minutes. Comic violence, mildly scary material.\n\nVoices of Anne Hathaway, Jesse Eisenberg. Two talking parrots, who are living the good life in captivity in South America, decide to show their young kids what life is like in the wilds of the Amazon River in this computer animated comedy sequel. Directed by Carlos Saldanha (“Rio,” “Ice Age,” “Robots”).\n\nTallahassee Mall: 11:45 a.m., 2:30, 5:15\n\n300: Rise of an Empire\n\nR, 102 minutes. Extreme violence, gore galore, nudity, rape, scary special effects, decapitations, lopped limbs, sexual content.\n\nEva Green, Rodrigo Santoro. It’s time for some ferocious, slow-mo payback when a female warrior named Artemisia pushes Xerxes for revenge and then leads Persia’s naval charge against Ancient Greece in the semi-sequel to the Spartan battle cry “300” (2006). Directed by Noam Murro (“Smart People”) instead of Zack Snyder this time around. Doesn’t matter, it still plays like a CGI-drunk video game with a ridiculously high body count. And did you know they had bikini waxing in Persia, circa 480 B.C.? (C)\n\nMovies 8: 12:20, 2:35, 4:55, 7:25, 9:50\n\nTranscendence\n\nPG-13, 119 minutes. Mild profanity, violence, surgery scene.\n\nJohnny Depp, Kate Mara. Anti-technology terrorists assassinate one of the world’s leading experts on artificial intelligence but the dying guy gets the last laugh when his wife uploads his mind online, where he starts all sorts of strange shenanigans. With Paul Bettany, Morgan Freeman, Cole Hauser and Rebecca Hall. Directed by Wally Pfister (“Side by Side”), who totally gives away the ending of movie in first five minutes. (C+)\n\nMovies 8: 12:40, 3:30, 6:55, 9:25\n\nX-Man: Days of Future Past\n\nPG-13, 131 minutes. Profanity, violence, scary special effects, sexual content.\n\nIan McKellen, Patrick Stewart. Super-powered mutants are being rounded up and destroyed by shape-shifting robots, so they send Wolverine back to 1973 to prevent an assassination that started the whole mutant-hating trend in the first place. With Halle Berry, Hugh Jackman, James McAvoy, Jennifer Lawrence, Michael Fassbender, Anna Paquin, Ellen Page, Rose Byrne and Peter Dinklage. Director Bryan Singer (“The Usual Suspects,” “X-Men”) is back at the helm. After a ridiculous and confusing start, the film settles into its ‘70s kitsch vibe with ease, if you don’t mind a few plot holes the size of kettle drums. (B)\n\nGovernors Square: 12:10, 12:40, 1:10, 3:20, 4:20, 6:40, 7:40, 9:50, 10:20, 10:50"
