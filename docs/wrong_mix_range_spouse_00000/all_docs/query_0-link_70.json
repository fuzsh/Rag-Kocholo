This lovely name is a Spanish form of Bethlehem, and quite common as a girl's name among Spanish speaking countries. Bethlehem comes from either the Hebrew beit lachem , meaning \"house of bread\", or bayt lahm , \"house of meat\". Bethlehem is the birth place of Jesus and David. In the Gospel of Luke it is said that Mary and Joseph live in Nazareth, and travel to Bethlehem. However the Gospel of Mark suggests that they already resided in Bethlehem, and then fled to Nazareth. In Bethlehem, Christmas is celebrated on three different occasions, December 25th, January 6th, and January 19th. January 6th is when Christmas is observed by Coptic, Greek, and Syrian Orthodox Christians, and January 19th is the traditional day for Armenian Orthodox Christians. We of course can't finish this po\n\nApartment Therapy (2)\n\nLily Rose's Room Continuing on with great names and style from Apartment Therapy.

Syrian Christians name them as Larvandad, Gushnapash, and Hormisdas, while those from Ethiopia call them Hor, Karsudan, and Basanater. Armenians have Kagpha, Badadakharida, and Badadlilma. Most of the time us Westerners cite them as Caspar, Balthazar, and Melchior. They are either scholars or Kings. Caspar is from India, Melchior from Persia, and Balthazar is Arabic. I've decided we will talk more in-depth about Balthazar, a favorite of mine. The name Balthazar comes from the Akkadian Bel-Sarra-Usur by way of the Hebrew Belshazzar, and means \"Ba'al protect the King\". For those of you unaware, Ba'al was a God from the Ancient Near East, and is usually referred to as a demon in Christian mythology. Beelzebub was originally called \"Ba'al\n\nTop Names in Québec, Canada\n\nCanadian stamp from 1864 These are the most popular names in Qu é bec from 2012. Girls: 1. Emma 2. Léa 3. Olivia 4.

The Agapanthus is a beautiful flower in the family Amaryilidaceae, and the only genus in the subfamily Agapanthoideae. They are sometimes referred to as the \"lily of the nile\", and in the UK they are African lilies, although they are not related to them. They are native to South Africa, and thrive in warm climates; most commonly bloom in the summer. The color can range from blue to purple to white, but most of the ones I've seen have been rather periwinkle in color. Agapanthus isn't affected by most pests, though the Noctuid Moth will be bothersome. The word Agapanthus comes from the Greek agape \"love\", and anthos, \"flower\". And where I first heard it? In \"The Land Girls\", a movie from 1998, Rachel Weisz plays a girl called Ag, full name Agapanthus.\n\nThe Children of Christian IX of Denmark\n\nChristian IX with Family by Laurits Tuxen Christian IX of Denmark was the son of Friedrich Wilhelm, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg- Glücksburg and Princess Louise Caroline of Hesse-Cassel, and is known as \"The Father-in-Law of Europe\", because each of his six children married into other royal houses. He married Louise of Hesse-Kassel , who was born Luise Wilhelmine Friederike Caroline Auguste Julie. Their six children were: Christian Frederick Vilhelm Carl, \" Frederick VIII of Denmark \" Alexandra Caroline Marie Charlotte Louise Julia, \" Princess Alexandra of Denmark \", or \"Alix\" Christian Wilhelm Ferdinand Adolf Georg, \" Prince William (or Vilhelm) of Denmark \", later \" George I of Greece \" Marie Sophie Frederikke Dagmar, \" Princess Dagmar of Denmark \" or \"Minnie\", later \" Maria Feodorovna \" Thyra Amalie Caroline Charlotte Anna, \" Princess Thyra of Denmark \" Val\n\nTop Names in Estonia\n\nEstonian stamp from 1996 These are the top names for Estonia in 2012.

Sander\n\nThe Children of Ferdinand I of Romania\n\nFerdinand I and Marie of Edinburgh with some of their children Ferdinand I was born Ferdinand Viktor Albert Meinrad, and was called \"Nando\". He was the son of Leopold, Prince Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen and Infanta Antónia of Portugal. He married Marie Alexandra Victoria, \" Princess Marie of Edinburgh \". Their children were: Carol Caraiman, \" Prince Carol \", later \" Carol II \" Elisabetha Charlotte Josephine Alexandra Victoria, \" Princess Elisabeth of Romania \", \"Lisabetha\", or \"Lizzy\" Maria, \" Princess Maria of Yugoslavia \", or \"Mignon\" Nicolae, \" Prince Nicholas of Romania \" Ileana, \" Princess Ileana of Romania \" Mircea, \" Prince Mircea of Romania \" (Died at age three)\n\nSweetly Swedish\n\nBritt Ekland I had such fun writing \" Fetchingly Finnish \", I thought I would continue it, and maybe make it a series.

In this version, the beauty if simply referred to as \"Belle\", which I find to a disappointment. There is so much naming potential there. Her sisters are called Adélaïde and Félicie, both lovely French names. What would you name the beauty? Something rosy perhaps? Or just extravagantly French? My choice is Rosemonde, which is both rosy and French.\n\nThe Children of Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia\n\nThe Grand Duke and Duchess with their children Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia was the daughter of Alexander III and Dagmar of Denmark.
