        "text": "All reviews by James Verniere, unless otherwise noted. Top rating: A+\n\nNew Releases\n\nCHARLOTTE'S WEB (B+)\n\nLeading ladies are usually beautiful, but in \"Charlotte's Web,\" the latest live-action adaptation of E.B. White's classic novel, the star is downright ugly. If it's possible to see beyond the surface of this eight-legged wonder (voiced by Julia Roberts), you will find that director Gary Winick's vision does justice to this timeless tale. The sensational swine is Wilbur (Dominic Scott Kay), the runt of the litter who is nurtured by Fern (Dakota Fanning). Wilbur's days are numbered, but a new friend offers him some help. Using her talents and expertise, Charlotte sets out to save Wilbur and prove he's special by weaving messages in her web, and the town becomes enthralled with this small miracle. (Rated G) CHELSEA BAIN\n\nCHILDREN OF MEN (A-)\n\n\"Children of Men\" is a terrific and haunting example of the end-of-the-world tales. It's 2027, and human beings have ceased to reproduce. In Britain, where the story is set, TV viewers mourn the news of the murder of \"Baby Diego,\" the youngest person on earth. Theodore Faron (Clive Owen), a Scotch-soaked journalist with connections in high places, gets involved with a resistance movement at the behest of the mysterious femme fatale Julian (Julianne Moore). In these bleak, war-torn times, \"Children of Men\" might be the most relevant film of the year outside of the several documentaries about the fighting in Iraq. (Rated R)\n\nTHE CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER (A)\n\nFor sheer, sumptuous spectacle, nothing you've seen all year is going to top Zhang Yimou's \"The Curse of the Golden Flower.\" It's a 10th century battle of wills, armies and psychology between the scheming, selfish, all-powerful Emperor of China (Chow Yun Fat) and his beautiful and perhaps doomed, unfaithful Empress (Gong Li). \"Curse\" exhibits enough martial arts fighting to satisfy any \"Matrix\" fan. There are armies of black ninjas, resourceful female fighters and a climactic battle of thousands that's a bit like the fearsome night siege in \"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.\" (Rated R) STEPHEN SCHAEFER\n\nTHE GOOD GERMAN (C)\n\nImagine \"Casablanca\" without Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, director Michael Curtiz or writers Julius J. and Philip G. Epstein, and you have \"The Good German.\" The film, a pastiche of 1940s postwar tropes, has an impressive pedigree. Featuring George Clooney and Cate Blanchett as \"Casablanca\"-like lovers in a black-and-white, post-World War II Berlin, the film is a beached cinematic whale. Clooney is hardboiled scribe Jack Geismer, a military journalist who returns to cover the Potsdam Conference, where Truman, Churchill and Stalin will divide the world among them. In the process, square-jawed, cock-hatted Jack gets involved in a murder investigation involving darkly sexy Lena Brandt (Blanchett), his onetime lover. \"You should never have come back to Berlin,\" someone says to Jack, echoing that famous \"Chinatown\" kicker. Putting it another way, I might suggest, \"Don't play it again, Sam.\" (Rated R)\n\nTHE HISTORY BOYS (A-)\n\nPaging \"Dead Poets Society\" members. How and why knowledge is transmitted is the subject of \"The History Boys,\" a film adaptation of Alan Bennett's acclaimed 2004 stage play featuring the original cast directed by Nicholas Hytner (\"The Madness of King George\"). The result should appeal equally to teachers, students, theater buffs and fans of fine, finely-acted films, which is to say as many people as are currently going ga-ga for penguins. \"The History Boys\" recalls such vintage, British school-days favorites as James Hilton's novel-turned-film \"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\" and Terence Rattigan's beloved play \"The Browning Version.\" Predictably, the film's most characteristic trait is its dialogue, which this cast virtually sings. (Rated R)\n\nTHE HOLIDAY (B-)\n\nWhat did we do to deserve this? Two Jack Black films for the holidays is an embarrassment of riches. In \"The Holiday,\" Black plays a romantic leading man and he pulls it off. Nancy Meyers' film begins so badly I thought I was in for a feature-length train wreck. Fortunately, Jude Law comes to the rescue. Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and Miles (Black) are co-workers living in Los Angeles, while Iris (Kate Winslet) works in London. When Amanda breaks up with her boyfriend, she meets Iris online, and the women agree to trade places in order to get through the Christmas holidays unattached. Subsequently, we flash back and forth between their adventures. Amanda, thank God, meets Iris' book editor brother Graham (Jude Law). Law takes this sad song and makes it better. In his presence, Diaz is energized, and he and two child actors are so sweetly charming together, it'll brighten your day. (Rated PG-13)\n\nOFF THE BLACK (B+)\n\n\"Off the Black\" is a modest, well-made and often compelling portrait of the father-son bond between a pitcher estranged from his real father and a grumpy, small-town umpire who hasn't seen his own son in years. The feature film debut of writer-director James Ponsoldt, \"Off the Black\" showcases a fine performance by Nick Nolte as the paternal Ray Cook. Ray lives alone in a modest suburban home, which in opening scenes is vandalized by angry high school pitcher Dave Tibbel (ruggedly handsome Trevor Morgan) and his buddies. Ray, who has a beer permanently in hand, catches Dave and forces him to clean up the mess. In the process, the two develop a relationship. A melancholy examination of the mysterious bonds between fathers and sons, \"Off the Black\" is a debut film that holds great promise for the future of its creator. (Rated R)\n\nWE ARE MARSHALL (B)\n\nIn 1970, 75 football players, coaches and boosters from Marshall University perished in a plane crash. They were only seconds from landing but instead slammed into a nearby hill. How does a small community recover from such a disaster? \"We Are Marshall\" centers on new head coach Jack Lengyel (Matthew McConaughey), an outlandish sort of guy with extended sideburns and a closet full of plaid. The film may be sappy, but you'll find yourself rooting for these guys to make it work. (Rated PG) CHELSEA BAIN\n\nOngoing\n\nAPOCALYPTO (A-)\n\nIn opening scenes of \"Apocalypto,\" Mel Gibson's latest, subtitled, gonzo-exotico effort, a young Mayan hunter chomps down on a tapir testicle, and you wonder: What is this, the pre-Columbian \"Jackass\"? No, it's \"Mad Max Beyond Yucatan.\" \"Apocalypto\" is grotesquely violent and seething with rage. The film is chockablock with evil portents, an end-of-times vibe and a \"Goddess of the Scaffold.\" In other words, it's vintage Mad Mel. A little girl's prophecy will remind some of Joseph Campbell's theory that Christ had mythic predecessors in pagan religions. But ontological Mel-isms aside, if you liked Michael Mann's great \"The Last of the Mohicans,\" you are going to grock this ultra-violent, National Geographic extravaganza bigtime. (Rated R)\n\nBABEL (B-)\n\nAnother weighty, portentous, relentlessly grim effort from Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (\"Amores Perros,\" \"21 Grams\"), \"Babel\" is, of course, being touted as Best Picture material. Afraid not. It tells several interweaving stories, involving, among others, a fabulous-looking American couple (Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett) having a marriage crisis in Morocco, the perilous adventures in Mexico of their two blond children, a mute Tokyo schoolgirl who behaves like a nymphomaniac and two Berber brothers herding sheep in the Atlas mountains. To some, Inarritu's work is genius. To others, it's just babble. Take your pick. In English, Spanish, Berber and Japanese with subtitles. (Rated R)\n\nBLOOD DIAMOND (B-)\n\nA Rambo movie for liberals, Edward Zwick's \"Blood Diamond\" might also be called \"Danny Archer, Soldier of Fortune.\" Handsome Danny (Leonardo DiCaprio) has been a bad boy. He smokes and drinks too much and makes a living smuggling \" conflict stones,\" also known as blood diamonds, out of 1990s Sierra Leone. The funds finance a rebel army that chops the arms off civilians and turns young boys into drug-addled zombies with AK-47s and such nicknames as \"Master of Disaster\"' and \"Babykiller.\" \"Blood Diamond\" is based on fact. But it is hardly a serious examination of the political and social realities of modern-day Africa. Zwick brings the same sensibility he brought to \"The Last Samurai\" to this film. \"Blood Diamond\" does not pass the reality sniff-test. (Rated R)\n\nBOBBY (A-)\n\nA \"Grand Hotel\" for these troubled times, \"Bobby\" catapults writer-director Emilio Estevez into the front ranks. Set in Los Angeles' Ambassador Hotel on that fateful day in 1968, the film tells interweaving stories involving nonhistorical figures leading up to the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, who would have almost surely been elected president and changed the course of our history. The film incorporates well-chosen period music and seamless archival footage. Estevez does an amazing job of moving the action along using compelling, individual narratives, deftly showcasing his predominantly fine, semi-all-star cast. (Rated R)\n\nBORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN (B)\n\nMeet the Jackass from Eurasia. Frequently uproarious, occasionally slack and sometimes just plain sophomoric, \"Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan\" has generated a \"Snakes on a Plane\"-like buzz but may not deliver enough laughs to sustain a mainstream hit. Anti-Semitic, homophobic, sex-fiend Borat Sagdiyev (British comic Sacha Baron Cohen) is a kind of cultural correspondent from Kazakhstan making a \"tourist film\" in America. The premise of the film is that Cohen does not tell the people he encounters that he is an entertainer until after he films their exchanges and has them sign a release. The film takes the comedy of inappropriateness to new levels of outrageousness and shock. (Rated R)\n\nCASINO ROYALE (A-)\n\nA James Bond for our times, Daniel Craig is a cold-hearted killer and screaming madman who wears his lacerations like a Marquis de Sade-approved badge of honor. Eva Green (\"The Dreamers,\" \"Kingdom of Heaven\"), this film's other trump card, is the best \"Bond girl\" in ages. See \"Casino Royale\" and see the Bond franchise jump-started in more ways than one. (Rated PG-13)\n\nTHE DEPARTED (A)\n\nA great Boston-set crime drama and a \"GoodFellas\"-like return to form for Martin Scorsese, \"The Departed\" is a wonderful example of genre filmmaking and another triumph for Jack Nicholson in the Whitey Bulger-like role of gang lord Francis Costello. Sent by Costello to the police academy to be his mole, Colin (Matt Damon) is promoted to Boston's elite anti-crime unit. At the same time, troubled Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) has chosen to become a policeman in spite of his family's many felons. What's great about \"The Departed\" is its riotously profane dialogue, fabulous cast and writer William Monahan's relevant references to the city's racist reputation and pedophile priest scandal. (Rated R)\n\nERAGON (B)\n\n\"Eragon,\" or \"Lord of the Wings,\" is to \"Lord of the Rings\" what tofu is to red meat. It's not the same by a long shot, but it's not bad and can be surprisingly tasty. Based on a 2003 novel by the now 23-year-old Christopher Paolini, the film boasts four screenwriters and is a weirdly Teutonic mix of Tolkien, \"Star Wars\" and \"The Wizard of Oz.\" The \"only hope\" for the future is Eragon (18-year-old, English-born posterboy Edward Speleers), an \"ordinary farmboy\" who is, unknown to himself, a Dragon Rider. A mysterious opalescent, ovoid \"stone\" Eragon finds in the woods turns out to be an egg, out of which comes the soon full-grown, blue dragon Saphira (voice of Rachel Weisz). Eragon must get himself and Saphira to the rebels and join them in their resistance. \"Eragon\" features spectacular Alpine scenery, impressive flying and battle sequences and generally looks fabulous. If you're in the mood for a heaping helping of \"Lord of the Rings\" hash, you could do a lot worse than \"Eragon.\" (Rated PG)\n\nFLUSHED AWAY (A-)\n\nThe worst title of the year, \"Flushed Away\" is the best animated film of the year, too, and if you didn't think slugs could be funny, think again. A James-Bond-meets-\"Alice-in-Wonderland\"-like adventure in a sewer, the film features a posh pet rat named Roddy (Hugh Jackman), a tough-sexy sailor rat named Rita (Kate Winslet) and a supporting cast that includes an inspired turn by Ian McKellen as The Toad. Think \"African Queen\" as a comedy with rats and frogs and singing maggots. (Rated PG)\n\nTHE GOOD SHEPHERD (B-)\n\nA preppie \"Godfather,\" \"The Good Shepherd\" takes us into the inner sanctums of political power in the United States, and guess what? it's a pinstriped mafia. Directed by Robert De Niro (\"A Bronx Tale\"), who also acts, and scripted by Eric Roth (\"Munich\"), it tells the story of Edward Wilson (Matt Damon), a bland young man born into pre-World War II wealth and privilege. The film shuttles between Edward's cloak-and-dagger adventures as a junior spy in Europe at the start of the Cold War and his later attempts in 1961 to uncover why the Bay of Pigs Invasion, a CIA operation he led, was such an abysmal failure. As Wilson's neurasthenic wife Clover, Angelina Jolie is too beautiful to be so ignored by everyone around her and too shockingly underused for someone with her talent. When she shouts, \"Who are you?\" at her flinching, bespectacled husband after 20 years of unhappy marriage, viewers can only sit there asking themselves the same question. (Rated R)\n\nA GOOD YEAR (B+)\n\nA variation of the yuppie-comeuppance fables of the '90s, the lighthearted romance \"A Good Year\" also attempts to rehabilitate the tarnished image of leading man Russell Crowe. The film, an adaptation of the fine 2004 novel by Peter Mayle directed by the great Ridley Scott, preserves the book's charm and Francophilic sentiments. Crowe plays a ruthless businessman who inherits his uncle's vineyard. The plot is a piffle involving a mysterious, mysteriously produced wine that sells for a fortune on the wine market. The priceless vintage is this parable's goose that lays the golden egg. If \"A Good Year\" were a wine, it would have a sprightly nose and the opposite of a lasting finish. But it is also delicious and has the desired intoxicating effect. (Rated PG-13)\n\nHAPPY FEET (B-)\n\nYou've heard of, if not seen, \"March of the Penguins.\" Welcome to \"Song and Dance of the Penguins.\" The film, inspired by the success of Luc Jacquet's 2005 documentary, is so sentimental and cutsie-wootsie, it recalls Dorothy Parker's line, \"It's enough to make you frow up.\" A musical adventure, it features a tone-deaf, tap-dancing protagonist (Elijah Wood), a Christina Aguillera-like heroine (Brittany Murphy), a group of Adelie penguins of Hispanic descent and Robin Williams as a guru Rockhopper penguin. What will they think of next? (Rated PG)\n\nTHE NATIVITY STORY (B-)\n\nAre you ready for \"The Passion of the Christ: The Prequel\"? The self-explanatory \"The Nativity Story\" is sweet, though the dialogue does not reveal much about the characters and the film's climax relies too heavily on canned, choral music. As Mary, Keisha Castle-Hughes is young, strong and vulnerable, but her performance is a bit of a blank slate. Joseph (Oscar Isaac), the industrious and handsome young carpenter, lives conveniently across the way from Mary. Back in Persia, the three magi Melchior (Nadim Sawalha), Balthasar (Eriq Ebouaney) and Shemp, I mean, Gaspar (Stefan Kalipha) seem more like the Three Stooges than wise men. The first of the expected offspring of \"The Passion,\" \"The Nativity Story\" is an After-Sunday-School Special. (Rated PG)\n\nTHE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS (B+)\n\nThe hard-luck drama \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" is a family affair in more ways than one. Will Smith delivers a wrenching performance as real-life Chris Gardner, a husband and father trying to raise himself out of homelessness and poverty. His son Jaden Smith, however, almost upstages him playing his screen son. Chris is a harried father, husband and salesman whose hair is beginning to gray. He sells medical bone-scanning devices, which he purchased in a get-rich-quick scheme. Redemption appears in the form of an unpaid internship at Dean Witter, where Chris dreams of striking it rich as a stockbroker. The film's arc is predictable; the payoff comes late, and the little-engine-that-could musical score grates. Smith's hard-charging Chris is a genuinely moving metaphor for the indomitable human spirit. When Smith finally weeps, you will, too. (Rated PG-13)\n\nROCKY BALBOA (C+)\n\n\"Rocky Balboa,\" the sixth and please last film in the Rocky saga, is almost pure kitsch. Maudlin and sentimental, the film presents Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) as a tormented, scarred, grief-stricken warrior who is estranged from his son (Milo Ventimiglia of NBC's \"Heroes\") and must exorcise \"the beast\" with one final fight. The screenplay is a series of speeches, some praising Rocky and others arguing against this potentially disastrous fight against a younger, faster opponent named ahem Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver). By the time Rocky begins pounding those beef slabs and Bill Conti's theme cues up, we know where we're headed. (Rated PG)\n\nSO MUCH SO FAST (A)\n\nDiagnosed with ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease) at age 29, Stephen Heywood clings to the sands of time. Filmmakers Steven Ascher and Jeanne Jordan filmed Heywood and his family over the course of five years. We watch as Stephen gets married and has a baby while his brother Jamie quits his job and establishes a fast-track foundation to find a cure. Even as Stephen deteriorates, Jamie's determination is wondrous. \"So Much So Fast\" is one of those films that puts everything in perspective. (Not rated) CHELSEA BAIN\n\nSTRANGER THAN FICTION (C+)\n\nIf you combined \"The Truman Show\" with one of those patented, reality-bending Charlie Kaufman screenplays, the result would resemble \"Stranger Than Fiction,\" a film that might also be described as Kafka for the illiterate. Meet Chicago IRS auditor Harold Crick (Will Ferrell in Everyman mode). Harold, who has a sentient wristwatch (not worth thinking about), lives in lonely singleton-hood, but one day finds himself auditing Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a sexy, nonconformist baker to whom he is powerfully attracted. Trouble is, Harold is literally a character in someone else's story, and if that metafictional idea appeals to you, you may have some fun here. One day, Harold hears the narration, \"Little did he know that would result in his death.\" Ferrell and Gyllenhaal are so sweet as this film's romantic couple, you wish they had jettisoned the whole metafiction thing and just made a straight romantic comedy. Clever gimmicks may be hot in films right now, but sometimes they bite you in the butt. (Rated PG-13)\n\n10 ITEMS OR LESS (B+)\n\nMorgan Freeman plays a veteran Hollywood movie star trying to kick-start a flagging career by appearing in an indie film in \"10 Items or Less,\" a surprisingly fun indie-film fable from writer-director Brad Silberling. In scenes set in a Los Angeles market, where Freeman's actor goes to do research for an indie role to which he has not yet committed, he meets a cashier (Paz Vega) at the \"10 items or less\" aisle and is struck by her. The actor and the cashier go on a series of banter-filled misadventures, leading up to her interview for a job she nervously yearns to land. It's not rocket science. But Vega is a deservedly rising star, and she and Freeman have chemistry and carry this off with aplomb. (Rated R)\n\nUNACCOMPANIED MINORS (C)\n\nIf only Macaulay Culkin were a kid again. Still, even the former megastar of \"Home Alone\" wouldn't be able to salvage \"Unaccompanied Minors\" When a bunch of kids are about to fly solo, an unexpected blizzard grounds their flights. Stranded, the tots are shuffled into a stuffy hangar to wait out the storm. But instead they run amok in the airport and these spunky tykes will get on your nerves. Ladies and gentlemen, please locate your nearest exits. Director Paul Feig has the right ideas, cute kids and a decent script, but there's turbulence when the story takes flight. The film wants to be a modern classic, but in the end it's just a bag of nuts. (Rated PG) CHELSEA BAIN\n\nVOLVER (A)\n\nAnother shrine to motherhood constructed by the great Pedro Almodovar, \"Volver\" (\"Return\") opens with an unforgettable image of Spanish women washing headstones in a cemetery. Even in death, our mothers care for us. In a career-capping performance, Penelope Cruz plays Raimunda, whose adolescent daughter has murdered her abusive stepfather. Raimunda hides the evidence, pretends she committed the murder, and what else? opens a restaurant. At the same Raimunda's Aunt Paula dies, and Raimunda's sister encounters the ghost of their mother in their aunt's home. If you can imagine a filmmaker whose vision is a prismatic blend of Alfred Hitchcock, George Cukor and Douglas Sirk, you have some sense of Almodovar's visual power and femme-centric emotionalism. \"Volver\" is the director's best film since his marvelous \"All About My Mother.\" (Rated R)"
