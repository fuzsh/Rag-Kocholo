GCFC was the driving force behind the Ohio Motion Picture Tax Credit (OMPTC) in 2009. Since then GCFC has attracted over 300 productions, most recently “Judas and the Black Messiah,” “Cherry” and Liam Neeson’s “The Marksman.” These projects have created 6,192 full-time equivalent jobs and brought over $1.1 billion into Ohio’s economy.\n\nGCFC connects cast and crew talent directly to production opportunities and invests in a strong local workforce by presenting workshops, seminars, FilmSkills training, and internships, designed to give local talent the education, experience, and professional connections to succeed in the film industry. GCFC works tirelessly to expand the film industry in Northeast Ohio, train and support a local workforce in order to generate real, sustainable opportunities that attract and retain talent.\n\nGCFC is firmly committed to supporting diverse representation; Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC), women, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer/questioning (LGBTQIA+), and other marginalized people groups. The organization’s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Initiative has led to the development of new programs that address equity (in the film industry and in general), from panel discussions to screenings, to lectures, and workshops by artists addressing the issue in their work.\n\nThe MIXED Premiere and Community Conversation events are part of the GCFC’s commitment to showcase diverse filmmakers and stories.\n\nThe Greater Cleveland Film Commission (GCFC) celebrated the 2021 NFL Draft in Cleveland with a very special event Behind the Story with the Filmmakers of “Draft Day”, presented by Sequoia Financial Group!\n\nOscar®-nominated director and producer Ivan Reitman – the creative force behind beloved films like Animal House, Ghostbusters, Twins, and the Cleveland film Draft Day – joined a panel of filmmakers at a virtual event on Thursday, April 22nd, 2021: Behind the Story with the Filmmakers of “Draft Day”.\n\nTony Rizzo from The Really Big Show on ESPN Cleveland moderated.\n\nIn addition to having the ability to submit questions to the panelists, virtual attendees heard stories from the Draft Day film set, learned why the production chose to film in Cleveland and discovered how the filmmakers decided to put the Cleveland Browns on the silver screen.\n\nFor the first half of the panel event, virtual attendees heard from Cleveland-native Rajiv Joseph (Draft Day Writer), Scott Rotham, (Draft Day Writer), Michael Beugg (Draft Day Executive Producer), Steven Altman (Draft Day Production Designer), and Gregory Alpert (Draft Day Location Manager). During the second hour, cult-classic director and producer Ivan Reitman joined the discussion.\n\nThis event was hosted by the GCFC and was presented by Sequoia Financial Group.\n\nThe GCFC worked very closely with the production to ensure Draft Day would be #FilmedInCLE in 2013. During its time in Cleveland, Draft Day:\n\nSpent over $16 million in Northeast Ohio\n\nHired over 70 local crew members\n\nEngaged with over 60 local small businesses\n\nBooked countless hotel room nights\n\nThank you to everyone who joined us for this event!\n\nABOUT THE FILMMAKERS\n\nIVAN REITMAN (Producer) has been the creative force behind films beloved by audiences around the world – from raucous comedies like “ANIMAL HOUSE,” “STRIPES,” and “GHOSTBUSTERS,” to more sophisticated delights like “DAVE,” “SIX DAYS SEVEN NIGHTS” and “TWINS.”\n\n2020 saw the release of “A Babysitter’s Guide to Monster Hunting” which Reitman produced for Netflix under The Montecito Picture Company banner. In addition to “A Babysitter’s Guide,” Ivan spent 2019 producing the much anticipated “Ghostbusters: Afterlife” for Sony Pictures with his son Jason Reitman continuing the family legacy in the director’s chair.\n\nIn 2017, he produced “Father Figures” for Alcon Entertainment and “Baywatch” starring Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron for Paramount Pictures. In 2016, he brought the Paul Feig reboot of “GHOSTBUSTERS” to life for Columbia Pictures.\n\nThe career that has brought so much laughter to us began in Canada, where his family emigrated from Czechoslovakia when he was four-years-old. Reitman studied music at McMaster University but soon turned his talents to film and theater.\n\nShortly after graduation, Reitman delved into film production – first with the extremely low-budget horror-comedy “CANNIBAL GIRLS,” starring Canada’s Eugene Levy and Andrea Martin, followed by the live television show “Greed” with Dan Aykroyd as its announcer. Reitman then headed to New York City and produced the Broadway hit “The Magic Show,” starring McMaster friend Doug Henning. He continued producing for the stage with the off-Broadway hit “The National Lampoon Show,” where he brought together for the first time the then-unknown John Belushi, Gilda Radner, Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, and Joe Flaherty.\n\nReitman returned to Broadway to produce and direct the musical “Merlin,” earning him Tony nominations for directing and producing. While in New York, Reitman reapplied his talents to filmmaking when he joined forces with the National Lampoon and brought us the groundbreaking sensation “ANIMAL HOUSE.” Following the success of that film, Reitman returned home to Canada to direct “MEATBALLS,” still considered one of the most successful films made in Canada.\n\nThe string of hits continued with “STRIPES” and the “GHOSTBUSTERS” series, which teamed Bill Murray with Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis; “DAVE,” starring Kevin Kline and Sigourney Weaver; “LEGAL EAGLES,” starring Robert Redford and Debra Winger; “SIX DAYS SEVEN NIGHTS,” with Harrison Ford and Anne Heche; “EVOLUTION,” starring David Duchovny and Julianne Moore; and a series of films that revealed an untapped comic persona for action hero Arnold Schwarzenegger: “TWINS,” “JUNIOR,” (both co-starring Danny DeVito) and “KINDERGARTEN COP.”\n\nReitman’s list of producing credits is equally extensive. He produced the family features “BEETHOVEN” and “BEETHOVEN’S 2ND,” as well as the HBO telefilm “The Late Shift,” which received seven Emmy nominations. Other producing endeavors include “HEAVY METAL,” “HOWARD STERN’S PRIVATE PARTS,” the animation/live-action film “SPACE JAM” (which teamed Michael Jordan with the Looney Toons characters), and the teen comedy hits “ROAD TRIP,” “EUROTRIP” and “OLD SCHOOL,” starring Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn, and Luke Wilson.\n\nIn 1984, Reitman was honored as Director of the Year by the National Association of Theater Owners and the next year received a Special Achievement Award at the Canadian Genie Awards. In 1979, and again in 1989, for the films “ANIMAL HOUSE” and “TWINS,” Reitman was honored with the People’s Choice Award. In November of 1994, Reitman became the third director honored by Variety magazine in a special “Billion Dollar Director” issue. At the end of 2000, Reitman’s films “ANIMAL HOUSE” and “GHOSTBUSTERS” were honored as two of this past century’s funniest movies by the American Film Institute. He currently heads The Montecito Picture Company, a film and television production company, with partner Tom Pollock.\n\nMore recently Reitman completed the family hit “HOTEL FOR DOGS,” “THE UNINVITED,” “I LOVE YOU, MAN,” “POST GRAD,” “CHLOE, and the Oscar®-nominated “UP IN THE AIR,” starring George Clooney and directed by his son, Jason Reitman. In 2011, he directed the comedy hit “NO STRINGS ATTACHED,” starring Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher. In 2012, he produced the wry “HITCHCOCK,” starring Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren and in 2014, Ivan directed the sports film, “DRAFT DAY” with Kevin Costner. Reitman has been married to former Quebec film actress Genevieve Robert for more than 40 years. Together, they have three children and live in Santa Barbara, California.\n\nCleveland native RAJIV JOSEPH attended Cleveland Heights High School (’92) and was inducted into the school’s Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\nHis play “BENGAL TIGER AT THE BAGHDAD ZOO” was a 2010 Pulitzer Prize finalist for Drama and also awarded a grant for Outstanding New American Play by the National Endowment for the Arts. It was produced on Broadway in 2011, starring Robin Williams.\n\nHe has twice won the Obie Award for Best New American Play, first in 2016 for “GUARDS AT THE TAJ”(also a 2016 Lortel Winner for Best Play) and in 2018, for “DESCRIBE THE NIGHT”.\n\nHis plays have been translated into several languages, with productions in recent years in Russia, Iran, South Korea, Japan, India, Singapore, Turkey, Romania, Italy, Portugal, the UK, Brazil, and Mexico.\n\nIn television, Rajiv wrote for seasons 4 and 5 of the Showtime series “NURSE JACKIE”. More recently, he scripted the pilot episode of “LITTLE AMERICA” for Apple TV.\n\nIn film, Rajiv has co-written with Scott Rothman the films “DRAFT DAY” (starring Kevin Costner and Jennifer Garner; directed by Ivan Reitman), which topped the Black List in 2012 and “ARMY OF ONE” (starring Nicolas Cage; directed by Larry Charles).\n\nHe received his Bachelor’s Degree from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, and his MFA from New York University’s Tisch School for the Arts.\n\nRajiv is a company member of the Steppenwolf Theatre in Chicago.

Not only is Cherry set in Cleveland, it was also shot here, and it is based on a semi-autobiographical novel by Cleveland author Nico Walker. The movie’s screenplay was co-written by Angela Russo-Otstot, the Russo brothers’ sister and another Clevelander. The film, which stars Tom Holland as an ex-Army medic who supports an opioid addiction by robbing Cleveland banks, is streaming on Apple TV+ starting on 3/12.\n\nAt our event, the three Russos answered questions about Cherry during a special live Zoom event organized by the Cleveland Institute of Art Cinematheque and the Greater Cleveland Film Commission. The virtual get-together opened with Cleveland Institute of Art President + CEO Grafton Nunes presenting honorary CIA doctorates to Angela, Anthony, and Joe.\n\nThank you to everyone who attended this event!\n\nABOUT THE FILMMAKERS:\n\nAnthony Russo and Joe Russo (Directors-Producers) have been absorbing classic movies since growing up in Cleveland in the 1970s. By high school, the brothers were immersing themselves in every genre, as well as catching every classic they could at their local arthouse theater. They each went on to study English and Film — Anthony at the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia, Joe at the University of Iowa and UCLA — and the result is a contribution to worldwide moviegoing that mixes storytelling craft, filmmaking skill, and a deep understanding of how great characters can connect us all.\n\nThrough a quartet of movies within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the Russos raised the bar for blockbuster filmmaking in artistry, scope, and box office: Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Captain America: Civil War (2016), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019), which in addition to concluding the “Avengers saga” racked up numerous industry records, including Biggest Single- Day Gross, Highest-Grossing Opening Weekend, and Highest-Grossing Film of All Time.\n\nWhile working on the Marvel films with screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, director of photography Trent Opalach, composers Henry Jackman and Alan Silvestri, amazing below-the-line and FX crews and the most extraordinary roster of actors ever assembled, the Russos have always stood by their belief that strong teamwork brings stratospheric results. Rejecting the label of “auteurs,” the Russos subscribe to the “collective theory,” noting that collaboration is crucial. It’s a philosophy that can be felt in their debut feature, Welcome to Collinwood (2002), and underscores their work on TV’s critically-acclaimed Arrested Development (for which they won an Emmy for Outstanding Directing of a Comedy Series), Community, and Happy Endings — for all of which the Russos directed the pilot episodes as well as numerous beloved signature episodes.\n\nSimilarly, the Russos are committed to helping young storytellers gain a foothold in the film industry. Just as their own careers received an early boost from producers including Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney, the Russos now lend their skills to producing films that spotlight fresh talent and ideas and are eager to help filmmakers they believe deserve membership in the Directors Guild of America. Beyond their sponsorship, the Russos try to personally mentor aspiring directors as they strive to grow as filmmakers, and they regularly host internships to help educate and guide them.\n\nIn addition to the film community, the Russo Brothers — whose family back home are longtime members of Cleveland’s Italian Sons and Daughters of America (ISDA) organization, which is defined by a strong belief in “Tradition, History, Family, and Philanthropy” — believe in giving back to the community they grew up in. Toward that end, they founded a forum with The National Italian-American Foundation (NIAF) that encourages and advises filmmakers who are eager to tell stories unique to the Italian-American experience.\n\nIn early 2018, the Russo Brothers were pleased to announce the formation of their studio, AGBO, an energetic, artist-led collective focusing on creating global content for film, television, and digital platforms.\n\nHeadquartered in downtown Los Angeles, AGBO aims to nurture talent and create best-in-class family and prestige content, with the goal of working in a wide gamut of genres and bringing original ideas to the screen. Among the company’s first films were Brian Kirk’s crime drama 21 Bridges, starring Chadwick Boseman; Sam Hargrave’s thriller Extraction, starring Chris Hemsworth, which broke records for Netflix as the biggest premiere in the platform’s history with over 100 million views during its first month of release; Natalie Erika James’ horror thriller Relic, starring Emily Mortimer, acquired out of Sundance and released by IFC Midnight; the fact-based Middle East-set drama Mosul, written and directed by Matthew Michael Carnahan and distributed by Netflix; and Cherry, from the best-selling novel, starring Tom Holland and Ciara Bravo — which is also the Russos’ first time behind the camera since Avengers: Endgame. Apple Original Films acquired Cherry for a debut early in 2021 on Apple TV+.\n\nTheir next directorial endeavor, The Gray Man, will star Ryan Gosling and Chris Evans in a film from Mark Greaney’s novel, which the Russos plan to turn into a franchise. Netflix has committed its largest budget to date on the project.\n\nIn addition to their film and television successes, the Russos are also co-founders — along with almost two-dozen fellow directors and artists — of BULLITT, a filmmaker’s collective and creative studio that is centered on the creation of brand-integrated entertainment and advertising content, and which utilizes state-of- the-art technology to break down barriers between advertisers and audiences.\n\nAngela Russo-Otstot is the co-screenwriter and producer on behalf of Cherry and President of Creative at AGBO, managing a team of executives who work collaboratively to develop innovative material and champion new creative voices. She leads creative development of all AGBO film and television content, as well as projects devoted to other forms of media (e.g.,. audio, gaming, etc.). Currently, Angela is a writer and producer on Amazon’s forthcoming international spy thriller series Citadel and recently served as Executive Producer on IFC’s Sundance hit Relic.\n\nAngela began her writing career when she sold a pilot to HBO at the age of 25, and went on to write for various television dramas that include FX’s The Shield and ABC’s V. With a desire to pass along her learning and experience, she taught screenwriting and playwriting at Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Institute of Art. Angela caught the film and theater bug early on, graduating from the theater program at Syracuse University and then\n\ncompleting a two-year intensive at The William Esper Studio in New York City studying the Meisner Acting Technique.\n\nABOUT THE MODERATOR:\n\nRuss Mitchell, former anchor of the CBS Evening News weekend editions and The Early Show on Saturday, and national correspondent for CBS News Sunday Morning, the CBS Evening News, and The Early Show joined the staff of 3News as Managing Editor Evening News and lead anchor of the 6pm and 11pm newscasts on January 16, 2012.\n\nMitchell was born in St. Louis and accepted his first television job at age 17 as a nighttime switchboard operator at KTVI-TV.

He received it for Distinguished Service in Journalism from The University of Missouri School of Journalism, his alma mater. He also returns there every summer to help with a journalism workshop for high school students, a workshop he attended in 1977.\n\nThe Greater Cleveland Film Commission was excited to present A Conversation with Steven Caple, Jr., American Film director, producer, and screenwriter, and native Clevelander.\n\nCaple’s feature film debut The Land (2016) was #FilmedInCLE and premiered at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival.
