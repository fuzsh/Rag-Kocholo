        "text": "Today’s Wiki-est Amazonian Googlies\n\nAcross\n\n1 Ketch pair : MASTS\n\nA ketch is a sailboat with two masts. The most forward mast is the mainmast, and is the taller of the two. The smaller mast is further aft, and is known as the mizzen mast.\n\n6 Pre-weekend letters : TGIF\n\n“Thank God It’s Friday” (TGIF)\n\n10 Damson or Mirabelle : PLUM\n\nThere are many plum tree cultivars that bear edible fruit. Examples are damsons, prune plums, greengages and mirabelles.\n\n15 Decimated sea : ARAL\n\nThe Aral Sea is a great example of how humankind can have a devastating effect on the environment. In the early sixties the Aral Sea covered 68,000 square miles of Central Asia. Soviet irrigation projects drained the lake to such an extent that today the total area is less than 7,000 square miles, with 90% of the lake now completely dry. Sad …\n\nTo decimate is to wipe out a large proportion of a population. The term arose from the ancient practice of punishing military units found guilty of mutiny. One in ten soldiers in the rebellious group would be executed, with the choice made in a lottery. The term comes from the Latin “decimare” meaning “to remove one-tenth”.\n\n18 Old comics character who said, “We have met the enemy and he is us.” : POGO\n\nAfter defeating and capturing several Royal Navy vessels in the Battle of Lake Erie, American Master Commandant Oliver Hazard Perry sent a famous message to Major General William Henry Harrison:\n\nWe have met the enemy and they are ours. Two ships, two brigs, one schooner and one sloop.\n\nStrangely enough, the quote is perhaps best known these days on the form of a parody penned by Walt Kelly in his comic strip “Pogo”:\n\nWe have met the enemy and he is us.\n\nKelly’s parody was used in a strip published on Earth Day in 1971, a strip bemoaning humankind’s pollution of the planet.\n\n19 Apple product : IPOD\n\nThe iPod is Apple’s signature line of portable media players. The iPod first hit the market in 2001 with a hard drive-based device, now known as the iPod Classic. Later models all use flash memory, allowing a smaller form factor. The smallest of the flash-based models is the iPod Shuffle, which was introduced in 2005.\n\n20 Naivete personified, literally : THE BABE WOODS (from “babe in the woods”)\n\n“Babes in the Wood” is a children’s tale, dating back to the late 1500s, that I think is quite morbid and scary. The basic story is that two children are abandoned in a wood, die, and are then covered in leaves by robins. It’s a morality tale that does describe the downfall of the uncle who has the children taken to the woods. However, today we think more of the “innocent babes”, as we describe someone who is naive as a “babe in the woods”.\n\n24 Many a Nora Ephron film : ROMCOM\n\nNora Ephron had many talents, including writing film scripts and novels. Many of the movies that she wrote, she also directed. These would include some of my favorite movies of all time like “Sleepless in Seattle”, “You’ve Got Mail” and most recently, the wonderful “Julie & Julia”. And, did you know that Nora Ephron’s second marriage was to journalist Carl Bernstein of Watergate fame? She wrote an autobiographical novel based on her life with Bernstein, which deals in particular with Bernstein’s affair with the daughter of British Prime Minister James Callaghan.\n\n28 Old speedster: Abbr. : SST\n\nThe first supersonic transport (SST) to fly was the Tupolev Tu-144, which was constructed in the Soviet Union. The Tu-144 first flew in 1968, but did not carry passengers until 1977. The aircraft was permanently grounded as a passenger craft in 1978 due to concerns about safety (there had been two Tu-144 crashes). The second SST to fly was the Anglo-French Concorde, which operated at a profit for over 27 years until it was withdrawn from service in 2003. There was one Concorde crash, in Paris in July 2000. Since then, there have been no commercial SST services.\n\n32 Co-founder of Artists Against Fracking : ONO\n\nArtists Against Fracking is an association formed by Yoko One and her son Sean Lennon. The list of members in the anti-fracking group includes Paul McCartney, Robert de Niro, Mark Ruffalo, Lady Gaga and Deepak Chopra.\n\n33 Abandoned, literally : THE LEFT LURCH (from “left in the lurch”)\n\nTo leave someone in the lurch is to abandon them in a difficult position. The phrase comes from an old French game called “lourche” or “lurch”, which was similar to backgammon. A player left “in the lurch” was in a hopeless position from which he or she could only lose the game.\n\n39 Doce meses : ANO\n\nIn Spanish, there are “doce meses” (twelve months) in an “año” (year).\n\n46 Medium power : ESP\n\nExtrasensory perception (ESP)\n\n49 Rte. finder : GPS\n\nA global positioning system (GPS) might point out a route (rte.).\n\n52 Presumes : POSITS\n\nTo “posit” is to assume as fact, to lay down as a “position”.\n\n54 Feature of some Birkenstocks : T-STRAP\n\nBirkenstock is a shoe manufacturer based in Germany.\n\n60 Modern diary : BLOG\n\nMany folks who visit this website regard it as just that, a website. That is true, but more specifically it is referred to as a blog, as I make regular posts (actually daily posts) that then occupy the “front page” of the site. The blog entries are in reverse chronological order, and one can just look back day-by-day, reading older and older posts. “Blog” is a contraction of the term “web log”.\n\n64 Accord creator : HONDA\n\nHonda started manufacturing the Accord model in Marysville, Ohio in 1982, making the Accord the first Japanese car to be produced in the US. The Accord was the best-selling Japanese car in America from 1982 to 1997, and 1989 was the first import to become the best-selling car in the US.\n\n65 Bridges of Los Angeles County : BEAU\n\nActor Beau Bridges is the son of actor Lloyd Bridges, and brother of actor Jeff Bridges. Beau’s best-known role is perhaps one of “The Fabulous Baker Boys” alongside brother Jeff.\n\n66 Fourth letter in a famous mnemonic : ERIE\n\nA well-known mnemonic for remembering the names of the Great Lakes is HOMES, an acronym standing for Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie and Superior.\n\n67 Like Barbara Bush, vis-à-vis Jenna : OLDER\n\nBarbara Bush is one of the twin daughters of President George W. Bush and First Lady Laura Bush. She is co-founder and president of Global Health Corps., a non-profit that promotes health equity around the world. Barbara and her sister Jenna wrote the 2017 memoir “Sisters First: Stories from Our Wild and Wonderful Life”.\n\nJenna Bush is one of the twin daughters of President George W. Bush. During her father’s 2004 presidential campaign, Jenna met and started dating Henry Hager who was a White House aide for deputy chief of staff Karl Rove. The couple were married in 2008.\n\n68 Lincoln or Jackson : CITY\n\nThe city of Lincoln is the second-largest in Nebraska, and is the state capital. In the days of the Nebraska Territory, the capital was the larger city of Omaha. When the territory was being considered for statehood, most of the population (which lived south of the River Platte) was in favor of annexation to Kansas. The pro-statehood legislature voted to move the capital nearer to that population in a move intended to appease those favoring annexation. As this conflict was taking place just after the Civil War, a special interest group in Omaha arranged for the new capital to be named Lincoln, in honor of the recently-assassinated president. The thought was that the populace south of the River Platte had been sympathetic to the Confederate cause and so would not pass the measure to move the capital if the Lincoln name was used. But the measure passed, the capital was moved, and Nebraska became the thirty-seventh State of the Union in 1867.\n\nJackson is the capital of the state of Mississippi. It was named for President Andrew Jackson, although the name was bestowed before he ran for electoral office. General Jackson was so honored in recognition of his victory at the Battle of New Orleans during the War of 1812.\n\n69 Twice-monthly tide : NEAP\n\nTides are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon on the oceans. At neap tide, the smaller gravitational effect of the sun cancels out some of the moon’s effect. At spring tide, the sun and the moon’s gravitational forces act in concert causing more extreme movement of the oceans.\n\nDown\n\n1 Rays that can live 50 years : MANTAS\n\nThe manta ray is the largest species of ray, with the biggest one recorded at over 25 feet across and weighing 5,100 pounds. It is sometimes referred to as the sea devil.\n\n2 Island exchanges : ALOHAS\n\nThe Hawaiian word “aloha” has many meanings in English: affection, love, peace, compassion and mercy. More recently, “aloha” has come to mean “hello” and “goodbye”, but only since the mid-1800s.\n\n4 “Survivor” group : TRIBE\n\nThe reality show “Survivor” is based on a Swedish television series created in 1997 called “Expedition Robinson”.\n\n8 Classic stage betrayer : IAGO\n\nIago is the schemer in Shakespeare’s “Othello”. He is a soldier who fought alongside Othello and feels hard done by, missing out on promotion. Iago hatches a plot designed to discredit his rival Cassio by insinuating that Cassio is having an affair with Desdemona, Othello’s wife.\n\n10 Light bender : PRISM\n\nWhen light passes through a prism, it splits up (disperses) into differing wavelengths. It then becomes clear that white light is actually a mixture of different colors, which show up as a beautiful spectrum.\n\n12 Gulf War support gp. : USO\n\nThe United Service Organization (USO) was founded in 1941 at the request of President Franklin D. Roosevelt “to handle the on-leave recreation of the men in the armed forces”. A USO tour is undertaken by a troupe of entertainers, many of whom are big-name celebrities. A USO tour usually includes troop locations in combat zones.\n\nMany of us tend to use “Operation Desert Storm” as the overall name for the conflict more correctly called the Persian Gulf War. Operation Desert Storm was in fact just the air and land battle that took place between January 17th and April 11th 1991. The buildup of forces was called Operation Desert Shield, and the withdrawal of forces after the liberation of Kuwait was known as Operation Desert Farewell.\n\n21 Word with collar or chip : BLUE …\n\nWe are perhaps most familiar with blue-collar and white-collar classifications for groups of workers. There are many more “collar colours” that have been coined:\n\nWhite collar – office worker\n\nBlue collar – manual worker\n\nPink collar – service industry worker\n\nGold collar – academic, scientific or hi-tech worker\n\nRed collar – government worker\n\nNo collar – artists and “free spirits”\n\nSteel collar – robots who have replaced blue-collar workers\n\nA blue chip is stock in a company that has a reputation for providing a solid return of investment in good times and in bad. The term “blue chip” comes from poker, as blue poker chips are traditionally those with the highest value.\n\n22 American Girl purchase : DOLL\n\nAmerican Girl is a line of dolls introduced in 1986. The dolls were originally young girls dressed in clothes that evoked various periods of American history.\n\n25 Abs are part of it : CORE\n\nThe abdominal muscles (abs) are more correctly referred to as the rectus abdominis muscles. They might be referred to as a “six-pack”, or even a “ten-pack”, in a person who has developed the muscles and who has low body fat. In my case, more like a keg …\n\n27 Comic Jay : MOHR\n\nJay Mohr is an American actor, one I most remember playing a supporting role in the wonderful HBO series “From the Earth to the Moon” (must-see-TV!). Mohr also created and hosted a reality show called “Last Comic Standing”.\n\n30 Lacking pizzazz : BLAND\n\nPizazz (also “pizzazz”) is energy, vitality. There’s a kind of cool thing about the “pizzazz” spelling, namely that it is the only 7-letter word in English that cannot be played in Scrabble. You can get close by using the Z-tile with the two blank tiles to get to three of the required four Zs, but there’s no way to get to the fourth Z.\n\n31 On the wrong side (of) : AFOUL\n\nTo be afoul of something is to be in conflict with it. The term “afoul” sounds nautical to me, and indeed it was originally used at sea in the sense of being in a state of entanglement or collision.\n\n33 Rocker Nugent : TED\n\nTed Nugent was the lead guitarist with the Amboy Dukes, and is now a successful solo artist. Off the stage, Nugent is noted for his conservative views, particularly when it comes to the Second Amendment. He serves on the board of directors of the National Rifle Association.\n\n34 One who may go deep : END\n\nThat would be football.\n\n36 Aerobic bit : STEP\n\nAerobic exercise is moderate activity designed to be at a low enough intensity that very little anaerobic activity takes place. In other words, the exercise is at a level where oxygen is taken in to burn fat and carbohydrate and to create energy. Anaerobic exercise is more intense and uses carbohydrate (glycogen) in the muscle to provide energy, without the need for oxygen. Aerobics are also called “cardio” as the exercises strengthen the cardiovascular system.\n\n38 Gym set : REPS\n\nOur word “gymnasium” comes from the Greek “gymnasion” meaning “public place where exercise is taken”. The Greek term comes from “gymnos” meaning “naked”, as that physical training was usually done unclothed in ancient Greece.\n\n43 Guys with gifts : WISE MEN\n\n“Magi” is the plural of the Latin word “magus”, a term applied to someone who was able to read the stars. Hence, “magi” is commonly used with reference to the “wise men from the East” who followed the star and visited Jesus soon after he was born. In Western Christianity, the three Biblical Magi are:\n\nMelchior: a scholar from Persia\n\nCaspar (also “Gaspar”): a scholar from India\n\nBalthazar: a scholar from Arabia\n\n44 Particle in a beam : MOTE\n\nA mote is a speck of dust.\n\n45 “Sesame Street,” e.g. : PBS SHOW\n\nThe Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) was founded in 1970, and is my favorite of the broadcast networks. I love PBS’s drama and science shows in particular, and always watch election results coming in with the NewsHour team.\n\nBack in 1966, the Carnegie Institute allocated money to study the use of television to help young children prepare for school. The institute gave a multimillion dollar grant to set up the Children’s Television Workshop with the task of creating an educational TV program for young people. The program began to come together, especially after Jim Henson (of Muppet fame) got involved. The name “Sesame Street” was chosen simply because it was the “least disliked” of all names proposed just before the program went on the air.\n\n49 About half of Trenta, at Starbucks : GRANDE\n\nStarbucks introduced us to coffee drinks in a whole range of volumes:\n\nDemi … 3 fl oz\n\nShort … 8 fl oz\n\nTall … 12 fl oz\n\nGrande … 16 fl oz (Italian for “large”)\n\nVenti … 20 fl oz (Italian for “twenty”)\n\nTrenta … 30 fl oz (Italian for “thirty”)\n\n51 “Femme Fatale” artist, 2011 : SPEARS\n\nBritney Spears was the best-selling female artist in the first decade of the 21st century. In recent years, Spears has attracted public attention for more than just her performances as a musician. Against her will, she was placed under the conservatorship of her father and an attorney in 2008, due to concerns about her mental wellbeing. Originally meant to last days, the conservatorship was extended to months, and was then made permanent. A social movement to “free” Britney from the conservatorship took off in 2019, and a court granted a termination of the arrangement in 2021.\n\n53 PC fixer : IT GUY\n\nInformation technology (IT)\n\n55 Oar fulcrum : THOLE\n\nIn a boat, a thole is a wooden peg or pin that acts as a fulcrum for an oar that it is used in rowing.

I haven’t seen this one yet, but I hear great things …\n\n58 Latin “others” : ALIA\n\n“Et alii” (et al.) is the equivalent of “et cetera” (etc.), with “et cetera” being used in place of a list of objects, and “et alii” used for a list of names. In fact, “et al.” can stand for “et alii” (a group of males, or males and females), “et aliae” (a group of women) and “et alia” (a group of neuter nouns, or a group of people where the intent is to retain gender-neutrality).\n\n60 “Doctor Who” airer : BBC\n\nThe iconic science-fiction television show “Doctor Who” first aired in 1963 on the BBC, and relaunched in 2005. The relaunched series is produced in-house by the BBC in Cardiff in Wales, the location that is the setting of the successful “Doctor Who” spin-off called “Torchwood”. The new show is about the Cardiff branch of the Torchwood Institute which investigates incidents involving extraterrestrials. Why “Torchwood”? Well, “Torchwood” is an anagram of “Doctor Who”.\n\n61 Island greeting : LEI\n\n“Lei” is a Hawaiian word meaning “garland, wreath”, although in more general terms a lei is any series of objects strung together as an adornment for the body."
