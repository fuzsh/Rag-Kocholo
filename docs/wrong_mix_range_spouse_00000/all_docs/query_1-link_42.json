        "text": "I had made my peace with never being able to propose to my girlfriend. We loved each other. We had lived together happily for years. We were planning our future. But YJ had made it clear that under no circumstances was I ever to ask her to marry me. “Don’t you dare,” she said.\n\nGrowing up as the daughter of a right-wing rabbi in an Orthodox Jewish community in Southern California, YJ (short for Yael Julie) had chafed at the expectation that a woman’s highest ambition should be to get married as soon as possible and immediately start having babies. When her high school friends found husbands at age seventeen and applied to small Jewish colleges, she charted a different path. Her resistance never faded. In her mid-30s, a fully secular Ivy League–educated lawyer and State Department diplomat, she still felt a fierce need to assert her independence. She even hated going to weddings. The idea of having her own was out of the question.\n\nYJ insisted that if we ever did get married, she’d like me to take her last name. It didn’t matter that we had no relationship with her father, who didn’t approve of our secular lifestyle, or that her forcing me to change my name was as absurd and unfair as me forcing her to change hers. She would explain that to make a crooked plant grow straight, you have to bend it back the opposite way. She wanted to do the same thing with our sexist society. It wasn’t enough for women to keep their own names. Men should have to change theirs for a few hundred years to make up for past injustice. Although I had made a career of learning from the wisdom of strong, opinionated women—I was Hillary Clinton’s chief speechwriter and book collaborator—I still wasn’t quite buying it. There were times when I wished YJ would change her mind, but I respected her choice.\n\nOne evening in late September 2017, we were strolling down a cobblestone street in Rome’s bohemian Trastevere neighborhood. We had just shared a branzino at one of her favorite restaurants, a cozy little trattoria near Piazza di San Calisto, and were looking for somewhere to go dancing.\n\nA few days earlier, on a sun-drenched Mediterranean afternoon in Amalfi, we had watched two of our closest friends get married. It was gorgeous, and they seemed so happy, but I didn’t even try to imagine us doing something similar. We were not going to have a storybook wedding, and that was just fine. I loved YJ not in spite of her unconventionality but because of it. She was passionate, iconoclastic, and insatiably adventurous, and even if she rejected the institution of marriage, I felt lucky that she wanted to spend her life with me.\n\nTaking my hand, she led me down a narrow side street. Then this woman who had surprised me so many times before did something that I would never have expected.\n\nAt first we were rivals. We met in the spring of 2005 in Virginia, two recent college grads going door-to-door trying to elect Tim Kaine governor. Each day we competed to see who could talk to more voters. With her long legs and boundless energy, YJ always won. We were living with a dozen other campaign workers in a two-bedroom condo in Virginia Beach. It was so crowded that one of our colleagues slept under the dining-room table. YJ and I were drawn together, but also repelled. She thought it was pretentious that I sometimes cooked what seemed at the time like gourmet meals in our tiny shared kitchen, making pesto from scratch and opening a bottle of decent red wine. I thought the same of the rabbi’s daughter with a Barnard College degree proclaiming her love for country music and pickup trucks.\n\nAfter the campaign was over, we went our separate ways. I moved to Washington, D.C., to work in Hillary’s Senate office. YJ eventually went back to New York and started law school at Columbia. We kept in touch, our old rivalry settling into a warm but not especially close friendship.\n\nA few years later, in 2009, I was in New York visiting my grandmother, who was in the hospital with a broken hip. That night, emotionally drained, I met YJ for a drink. I told her how it had felt to hear my grandmother, once such a force of nature, a vital writer and composer, tell me that she wanted to die. As I talked, I wondered: Why was I pouring my heart out to this woman I’d barely seen over the past three years? Why did I feel like such an open book around her?\n\nWe started dating that summer in D.C. Other than an evening at a riveting production of King Lear set in a garish post-Soviet kleptocracy (years later we still think of that night as one of our best dates), it did not go well. I had convinced myself that we needed to figure out if this could be a serious romantic relationship by the end of the summer, when she would go back to law school in New York. I wanted us to see each other all the time and act like a couple. YJ felt the same emotional connection I did, but she wasn’t ready to make any kind of commitment. And although I didn’t know it at the time, she kept seeing other people. Increasingly, she avoided my calls and the pressure that came with them. When her summer law-firm job neared its end, she declared that instead of spending August with me, she was moving to Afghanistan to work for a nonprofit. On YJ’s last night in town, when I showed up unannounced at her door on Capitol Hill to say goodbye, she didn’t answer. As I sat on the stoop, humiliated, it started to rain.\n\nEvery few months for the next year, compelled by something we couldn’t name, one of us would reach out and we’d start speaking again. But when we saw each other, it always ended in spectacular blowups. We argued about why our summer romance hadn’t succeeded, whether her taking a job at a big corporate law firm constituted selling out, and the way I projected my idealized vision onto her instead of engaging with the real woman she was. For two people who had barely dated, it was surprisingly emotional.\n\nWhen YJ wrote from New York to say she was coming to D.C. for Jon Stewart’s rally in the fall of 2010, I lied and said I wasn’t free. YJ is nothing if not persistent. She tried again the following week, and I reluctantly agreed to meet. Somehow this time was different. She had graduated from law school, spent a few months working on a farm in Tuscany, meditating in an ashram in Thailand, and surfing in Bali, and along the way had decided she was ready for a real relationship. I didn’t have to be told twice. We spent two years commuting between our respective cities, and then she got a job at the State Department and moved in with me.\n\nWe eventually found a third-floor walk-up one-bedroom in the Adams Morgan neighborhood, with a bay window and an open kitchen. I was helping Hillary write her State Department memoir and get ready to run for president, and YJ was organizing peace talks in Syria and negotiating with the Iranians on how to implement the controversial nuclear deal. At home, we never stopped talking, debating everything from the morality of drone warfare to the viability of a universal basic income to how the first woman nominee for president from a major U.S. party should make her case to the nation. YJ recited Shelley and Tennyson by heart, made me dance with her in the kitchen whenever Pitbull came on the radio, and taught me to love Kenny Chesney. But there never was any doubt: Marriage was out of the question.\n\nThere was one time we came close. We were on vacation with friends in France’s Dordogne Valley, and the two of us took a long bike ride through fields of sunflowers. When we stopped for a break, I went into my bag and came out with a baguette, some cheese, and a small jewelry box. A look of terror crossed YJ’s face. Was I about to ruin everything? Slowly she opened the box. Relief flooded over her when she saw a pair of silver earrings I had picked up on a work trip to Vietnam. Everything was right with the world again.\n\nThen came the heartbreak of November 2016. The outcome of the presidential election meant a lot of good people were going to be deported or lose their health care or suffer discrimination and abuse. YJ and I didn’t have to face anything like that. But the life we had anticipated disappeared in an instant. We had hoped to buy a house in Washington, get new jobs in Hillary’s White House, and do the most important work of our lives. YJ was just as crushed as I was. She had discovered a real passion for foreign policy. She loved the high stakes, the exotic travel, and the feeling of being part of something bigger than herself. Now she would have to say goodbye to all that and watch as the new administration retreated from the world, including the Iran nuclear deal she had worked so hard to implement.\n\nWe decided we had to get out of D.C. YJ found a job based in Los Angeles selling superfast “hyperloop” trains to foreign governments that let her put her diplomatic experience to use and allowed us to start over in a new city. I spent my time traveling back and forth from L.A. to Chappaqua, New York, so I could help Hillary write another memoir, this time about the 2016 campaign. We stayed up late around her kitchen table, trying to make sense of what had happened. It was wrenchingly painful but ultimately cathartic.\n\nSo was living in Southern California. YJ and I hiked in the canyons, lay on the beach, grew bougainvillea on our porch, and made pesto from scratch. We said to each other that living well was the best revenge.\n\nIn September, after Hillary’s book was published, YJ and I headed to our friends’ wedding in Italy. The beautiful little seaside town of Amalfi was full of former campaign colleagues and old D.C. friends. Like us, they were all trying to find new ways to be happy in a world that felt upside down.\n\nWhen it was over, YJ and I took the train to Rome for a few days alone. One morning she surprised me by saying that she wanted to arrange our day. (Normally I’m the one who makes the itineraries.) She planned a picnic in the Villa Borghese gardens and led me through the Berninis and Caravaggios in the Villa Borghese. In the evening, we went to a concert of Beethoven and Rossini at the old American-expat church St. Paul’s Within the Walls and dinner in Trastevere. In the trattoria, a boisterous Italian family that had just come from a wedding was holding court, with the bride still in her dress and the priest sitting at the head of the table and smoking.\n\nAfter dinner, YJ and I walked hand in hand through the ancient streets. This wasn’t the life we’d expected, but it felt right. Then she pulled me into the side-street and paused under a vine-covered trestle. When I turned around, it seemed as though she was tying her shoe. But YJ looked up and, from one knee, said very seriously, “Can I ask you something? Will you marry me?” Was this a joke? “Of course,” I said, laughing. She kissed me, and I realized it wasn’t a joke at all.\n\nHow did the woman who never wanted to get married decide to propose? Part of it was going through the upheaval of the election and learning that we could weather disappointment together—that being together was, in fact, the only way to do it. Part of it was moving to California and starting a new life. Paradoxically, it wasn’t until events upended our plans that she finally felt in control of her own destiny. And, she figured, maybe if we bent our lives back the other direction, back toward happiness, we’d grow up straight.\n\nOf course she also loved the theater of it. She relished the chance to invert convention. Why should men always be the ones to propose in heterosexual relationships? Most of us no longer think of marriage as a transaction between father and husband, in which the woman is handed from one form of servitude to another. Surveys have found that a majority of Americans are OK with the idea of women proposing, including, in one study, most men. Yet it happens in only about 5 percent of marriages. YJ believed this was an idea whose time had come. If society expects women to do everything that men do, then why not this?\n\nWhen I got over my surprise, I was thrilled. And while I still wasn’t going to change my last name, I offered to add hers as a new middle name. (The jury’s out on whether she’ll reciprocate.) After waiting so many years, we decided to move quickly. So just two months later, the day after Thanksgiving, we took our families on our favorite hike in Malibu, and on a bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean, we got married. It was a simple ceremony, but I loved every minute of it."
