        "text": "Oscar-winning actress Kate Winslet has teamed up with writer/director Todd Haynes for a HBO limited series adaptation of 'Trust'. Trust is based on a 2023 Pulitzer Prize book by Hernan Diaz. Jon Raymond will co-write the script along with Todd Haynes. They will also share the role as executive producers. The author herself and Winslet will also be executive producers along with Christine Vachon and Pamela Koffler.\n\n​\n\nSimilar Topic:Oscar-nominated Actor Barry Keoghan In Talks To Join In Adaptation Of Don Winslow’s ‘Crime 101’\n\nHere is the goodreads synopsis of Trust by Hernan Diaz:\n\nAn unparalleled novel about money, power, intimacy, and perception\n\nEven through the roar and effervescence of the 1920s, everyone in New York has heard of Benjamin and Helen Rask. He is a legendary Wall Street tycoon; she is the daughter of eccentric aristocrats. Together, they have risen to the very top of a world of seemingly endless wealth—all as a decade of excess and speculation draws to an end. But at what cost have they acquired their immense fortune? This is the mystery at the center of Bonds, a successful 1937 novel that all of New York seems to have read. Yet there are other versions of this tale of privilege and deceit.\n\nHernan Diaz’s TRUST elegantly puts these competing narratives into conversation with one another—and in tension with the perspective of one woman bent on disentangling fact from fiction. The result is a novel that spans over a century and becomes more exhilarating with each new revelation.\n\nAt once an immersive story and a brilliant literary puzzle, TRUST engages the reader in a quest for the truth while confronting the deceptions that often live at the heart of personal relationships, the reality-warping force of capital, and the ease with which power can manipulate facts.\n\nSource: Variety"
