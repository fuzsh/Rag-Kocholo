        "text": "SAVE ME\n\nUpdating the ‘Celebrities who have donated blood or supported blood donation’ post, prompted me to construct a similar list of celebrities who have promoted animal rights. As with the Alan Freeman playlists, this was something I wanted to create and expand on the forums, but which did not grow as hoped. Instead, my existing knowledge, Wikipedia and the blogs(1) have formed the bulk of the list – with brief comments. My hope is that I can add comments to more of the celebrities in time, but maintaining the flow of posts remains my priority.
