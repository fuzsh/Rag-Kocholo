        "text": "Tag: Notes on a Scandal\n\nCate Blanchett in ‘Pushing Tin’\n\nThis week we go back to almost the beginning of Cate Blanchett’s illustrious career with Pushing Tin (1999). To discuss Mike Newell’s film and the performances of Blanchett, Angelina Jolie, John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton, Murtada welcomes to the podcast Mitchell Beaupre, senior editor at Letterboxd.\n\nClick to Listen:\n\nSubscribe: Apple Podcasts / Stitcher / Spotify / iHeart\n\nWhat is the film about?\n\nFrom IMDB: A feud develops between two air traffic controllers: one cocky and determined while the other is restrained and laidback, which inevitably affects their lives.\n\nWho does Cate play?\n\nConnie Falzone, the New Jersey wife of an air traffic controller whos feuding with a co-worker.\n\nWhat year did it come out?\n\n1999.\n\nBox Office: US= $8.4 MM Outside US = unavailable\n\nCritical Response: Metacritic : 47 RT:48\n\nTopics Discussed:\n\nThis cast! Blanchett, Angelina Jolie, John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton. Where they were in 1999 and where they are now.\n\nThe Blanchett look – the fringe, the earrings, the makeup – very Jersey.\n\nUnforgivable that they had Blanchett and Jolie and did not give them at least one meaty scene together. Their only interaction is a brief one with the other “wives.”\n\nMike Newell from Four Weddings (19944) to Donnie Brasco (1997) to this. He was on a roll. Was this the film that derailed him? His follow-ups are all flops – Mona Lisa Smile (2203), Love in the Time of Cholera (2007) and Prince of Persia (2010).\n\nSometimes plays like an anthropological look at a certain frat bro culture. The one upmanship, the competitiveness, the explanation of what ”being a man” is,\n\n“He said attractive?” – Cate’s best moment.\n\nPre 9/11 – so much shenanigans that would never happen around planes these days.\n\nThe “big gesture” ending, perhaps of that “boombox serenade” from Say Anything (1989).\n\nWhen Bily Bob abd Angelina kiss with everyone’s mouths agape – the same reaction of the whole world to their antics at that time “we fucked in the car.”\n\nFilm within context of Cate’s career:\n\nReleased 4/23/1999, a month after the Oscar ceremony where Blanchett recieved her first nomination for Elizabeth. 1999 also saw the release of An Ideal Husband and The Talented Mr Ripley.\n\nSubscribe: Apple Podcasts / Stitcher / Spotify / iHeart\n\nLike?

To discuss Alejandro González Iñárritu’s film and Blanchett’s penchant to sometimes take on small supporting parts, Murtada welcomes to the podcast Zita Short, critic for InSession Film and Jumpcut Online and host of The 300 Passions Podcast.\n\nClick to Listen:\n\nSubscribe: Apple Podcasts / Stitcher / Spotify / iHeart\n\nWhat is the film about?\n\nFrom IMDB: Tragedy strikes a married couple on vacation in the Moroccan desert, touching off an interlocking story involving four different families.\n\nWho does Cate play?\n\nSusan Jones, an American tourist who gets injured during a trip to Morocco.\n\nWhat year did it come out?\n\n2006\n\nBox Office: US= $34MM Outside US = $101MM\n\nCritical Response: Metacritic : 69 RT:69\n\nTopics Discussed:\n\nThe films of Alejandro González Iñárritu which include Amores Perros, Biutiful, 21 Grams, Birdman and The Revenant.\n\nCate and Brad Pitt – made two films together in quick succession. See also The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008). What do we think of them as a screen couple?\n\nThe theme of globalization – how people are treated in “foreign lands,” the Americans in Morocco vs. the Mexicans in the US.\n\nLinking the separate stories together by the end is something Iñárritu loves to do. See also Amores Perros. It feels slightly overengineered.\n\nWeird role for Cate; she spends almost the entire movie on the floor of a hut in Morocco.\n\nBabel was an Oscar success with nominations for best film and best director (the year The Departed and Martin Scorses won). Also nominated were the performances from Adriana Barraza and Rinko Kikuchi.\n\nAre Cate and Brad playing “ugly Americans” abroad? The film does not shy away from presenting them as entitled despite the circumstances that they are in.\n\nLots of familiar faces in the cast. Harriett Walter, young Elle Fanning, Clifton Collins Jr and Michael Pena. Kōji Yakusho from Koreda’s The Third Murder.\n\nBabel vs. Crash – many reviews made the comparison perhaps because of the multiple story lines. Babel is weirder, less sentimental.\n\nFilm within context of Cate’s career:\n\n2006 was a busy year in film for Cate. She also had The Good German and Notes on a Scandal released within weeks of this film. In an interview with NPR she apologized for “being very present at the moment.”\n\nSubscribe: Apple Podcasts / Stitcher / Spotify / iHeart\n\nLike? Rate and Review. Have a question?

To discuss Joel Schumacher’s film, Murtada welcomes illustrator and designer Dash Silva to the podcast. This wide ranging conversation also covers Blue Jasmine, The Aviator, the accent work of Meryl Streep and a few of this year’s best actress awards contenders including Lady Gaga, Jessica Chastain and Kristen Stewart.\n\nClick to Listen:\n\nSubscribe: Apple Podcasts / Stitcher / Spotify / iHeart\n\nWhat is the film about?\n\nFrom Wikipedia: The film’s about Irish journalist Veronica Guerin, whose investigation into the drug trade in Dublin led to her murder in 1996, at the age of 37.\n\nWho does Cate play? Veronica Guerin – another one of her “titular” roles.\n\nHow is Cate introduced? 2 mins in court defending herself as a reckless driver. It’s an exciting prelude before the film goes back 2 years to tell the story.\n\nWhat year did it come out? 2003\n\nBox Office: US $1.5MM, rest of the world $ 7.8MM Critical Response: Metacritic: 55 RT: 53\n\nTopics Discussed:\n\nGuerin is a major figure in Ireland, the film came just a few years after her murder and tries to capture the legend.\n\nA clear good vs. evil narrative. Does it get at the complexity of the story?\n\nThe portrayal of Guerin as dogged, focused, intimidating and intimidated, brave and frightened. Many notes for Cate to play.\n\nAn odd choice for Joel Schumacher or is it? He seems to make many different genres of film. Best known for Batman Forever and Batman & Robin, he also directed a musical (The Phantom of the Opera), thrillers (8MM and Falling Down), melodramas (Dying Young and Flawless) and even a rom-com (Cousins). This is his Erin Brockovich.\n\nSince Cate does an Irish accent here let’s pit her against the Accent Queen; Meryl Streep. Irish (Dancing at Lughnasa), Italian (The Bridges of Madison County vs. Cate actual Italian in Heaven ), English (Plenty vs. Notes on a Scandal).\n\nBrief interlude about Cate’s performances in The Man Who Cried, The Aviator and Blue Jasmine.\n\nOscar winner Brenda Fricker (My Left Foot) and current Oscar hopeful Ciaran Hinds (Befast) are in the cast. Plus a Colin Farrell cameo ( a meta joke since they talk about Eric Cantana who’s in Elizabeth).\n\nBrief mentions of Cate’s two films out now in release; Nightmare Alley and Don’t Look Up.\n\nThis year’s best actress hopefuls; Lady Gaga in House of Gucci, Kristen Stewart in Spencer and Jessica Chastain in The Eyes of Tammy Faye.\n\nWhat critics said at the time:\n\nCate Blanchett plays Guerin in a way that fascinated me for reasons the movie probably did not intend. I have a sneaky suspicion that director Joel Schumacher and his writers (Carol Doyle and Mary Agnes Donoghue) think of this as a story of courage and determination, but what I came away with was a story of bone-headed egocentrism. There are moments when Guerin seems so wrapped up in her growing legend and giddy with the flush of the hunt that she barely notices her patient husband, who seems quite gentle, under the circumstances, in his suggestions that she consider the danger she’s in and think of their child. – Roger Ebert.\n\nFilm within context of Cate’s career:\n\n2003 was a busy year for Blanchett, see also The Missing, Coffee and Cigarettes and her 3rd time as Galadriel in LOTR:The Return of the King.\n\n2003 was the last year of her wilderness era post Elizabeth (1998) when her movies didn’t seem to connect. The year after she appears in The Aviator and for the next 4 years she’ll have a great run.\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nMurtada on Lady Gaga‘s performance in House of Gucci.\n\nMurtada on Jessica Chastain in The Eyes of Tammy Faye.\n\nNew Yorker 2006 profile of Blanchett that mentions the refrenced anecdote about her Notes on a Scandal accent.\n\nSubscribe: Apple Podcasts / Stitcher / Spotify / iHeart\n\nLike?

We visit with the Dame, Judi Dench. We discuss her film career, with deep dives into an early entry A Room With a View (1986) and the film that launched her film stardom Mrs. Brown (1997). Returning for this conversation with our host Murtada Elfadl is writer and critic Teo Bugbee.\n\nClick to listen:\n\nSubscribe: Apple Podcasts / Stitcher / Spotify / iHeart\n\nTopics Discussed:\n\nGeneral impression of the Dame, which performances do we enjoy, what does she bring to screen?\n\nOur first time watching Judi Dench at the movies – Shakespeare in Love (1998). She won an Oscar playing Elizabeth I the same year Cate did in Elizabeth.\n\nThe duet with another Dame, Maggie Smith in A Room with a View.\n\nMrs. Brown (1997) was her big breakout film. It was originally intended as a TV movie until a certain producer was impressed and bought it for theaters.\n\nOther notable screen roles include Iris, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, Philomena, Skyfall.\n\nWe play a game: Who said it, Cate or Judi?\n\nBriefly touch ob other career highlights from her early theater work – her Lady Macbeth (1976) is considered the standard, to the current iteration;tik tok sensation.\n\nSubscribe: Apple Podcasts / Stitcher / Spotify / iHeart\n\nLike?

Murtada Elfadl welcomes back Teo Bugbee to discuss the juicy and delicious Notes on a Scandal, its lineage to hagsploitation flicks like Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?, the trope of the predatory lesbian, and why this film remains highly rewatchable.\n\nClick to listen:\n\nSubscribe: Apple Podcasts / Stitcher / Spotify / iHeart\n\nFollow along, stream the film on Amazon prime.\n\nWhat is the film about?\n\nFrom imdb: A veteran high school teacher befriends a younger art teacher, who is having an affair with one of her fifteen-year-old students. However, her intentions with this new “friend” also go well beyond a platonic friendship. Adapted by Patrick Marber from Zoe heller’s novel, directed by Richard Eyre.\n\nWhat year did it come out?\n\n2006\n\nWho does Cate play?\n\nSheba Hart – a “bourgeoisie bohemia” teacher who embarks on a friendship with a fellow teacher and a disastrous affair with a student.\n\nHow is Cate introduced?\n\n3 minutes in. The outsider coming in as the new art teacher in school, a “hard to read wispy novice.” Flustered and a bit late.\n\nBox Office: Domestic = $17.5MM, Int’l = $32.3MM.\n\nMetacritic: 73 RT: 87\n\nTopics Discussed::\n\nJudi’s voice over is delicious, cuts like a sharp knife. I want to quote ALL of it. A gold star performance.\n\nSheba is unlike the characters that Cate usually plays. Many of those are “exceptional” people, Sheba is messy and foolish. The vagueness in the performance fits the character, she’d even described as someone without substance “a sort of absent person.”\n\nThe trope of the repressed predatory lesbian – does the film interogate it? And the differing reactions to it from the hosts; a gay man and a lesbian.\n\nThere a mineage to the the tradition of hagsploitation pictures like Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?\n\nBarbara Covett vs. Tom Ripley from The Talented Mr. Ripley. Why we identify with one as queer people and not the other?\n\nWe dissect three scenes:\n\nThe main confrontation later in the film “Do you want to fuck me Barbara?” – so many delicious lines as they go toe to toe. A scene I rewatch a lot.\n\nBy the car when Barbara’s cat dies.\n\nThe lunch visit which sets up the class conflict that the film is trying to depict, also sets up the vast difference between how Barbara (makes an effort, gets dressed up) and Sheba (no effort at all, casual, doesn’t think about it) see their friendship.\n\nOther scenes discussed:\n\n”Dordogne” post the big confrontation.\n\nBill Nighy wonderful when asking Sheba why she didn’t ask him for help after the affair’s reveal.\n\nFilm within context of Cate’s career:\n\nReleased the same year as The Good German and Babel.\n\nAwards: Cate was nominated for Oscar, Golden Globes, and SAG losing to Jennifer Hudson in Dreamgirls. So was Judi + Bafta losing to Helen Mirren in The Queen. The Oscars also nominated Patrick Marber’s script and Philip Glass’ score.\n\nPress:\n\nNew Yorker profile by John Lahr includes this two anecdotes about the making of Notes:\n\n“In a pre production discussion for last year’s “Notes on a Scandal,” Richard Eyre says he got off to “a slightly sticky start with Cate.” He told me, “She’d had one session with a dialect coach, and was she going to have another? I was worried about whether she’d be class-specific. Her character is kind of upper-middle bohemian. I wanted the distinction between her and Judi Dench’s character, who is petit bourgeois, to be clear.” Eyre continued, “I think she thought I was over concerned with the externals instead of the psychology.” “He was really worried about the issue of class,” Blanchett explained. “ ‘Richard,’ I said, ‘I need to work on it because I’m not a mimic. I need to sit down and work on it.’ So the accent became an issue, when I didn’t want to focus on the accent but on the meat of things.” No sooner were Eyre’s words out of his mouth than he realized that he’d made a mistake. “I was sitting in my kitchen and talking. She said, ‘Don’t you think I can do this?’ ‘ Eyre said. “She was upset. I must have been eroding her self-confidence. I felt as bad as I’ve ever felt. I apologized. She didn’t extract revenge.”\n\nMarber recalls, “I put this line in it, ‘Where did you get my hair? Did you pluck it from the bath with some special fucking tweezers?’ She said, ‘I don’t want to say that line. It’s too funny. It will corrupt the tone of where Sheba’s at.’ We hammer-and-tonged it for about ten minutes. Eventually, I said, ‘Oh, please, just please.’ I think she felt compelled to concede to the writer, even if he was a bloody idiot. I think that’s because she’s come from the theatre.”\n\nBlanchett / Dench lovefest in pictures:\n\nSubscribe: Apple Podcasts / Stitcher / Spotify / iHeart\n\nLike? Rate and Review. Have a question?
