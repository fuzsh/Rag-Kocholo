        "text": "The Other Woman: 1 ½ out of 5\n\nLydia: The best part about being pretty is that you don’t have to work hard.\n\nThree grown woman find out they are sharing the same guy and become friends with a mission to have their silly revenge. Admittedly I do not have a whole lot of tolerance for these kinds of movies. I am not talking about ‘chick flicks’, as there are plenty of ‘chick flicks’ that I enjoy and would recommend. I am talking about dumb movies that exist to provide some laughs, maybe, but are instantly forgotten and have only one real trick up their sleeve and that’s to convince movie goers to have spent their money on it to begin with. To be completely fair, The Other Woman has a big enough performance from Leslie Mann to likely elicit plenty of smiles and make it feel like harmless fun, but also keep in mind that this film that features three female leads that never stop talking about boys. There are also all the slow-mo boob shots and poop jokes too, which the movie definitely enjoys featuring.\n\nCameron Diaz stars as Carly, a professional lawyer in a new relationship with successful business man Mark (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau). As this relationship is shown to us while the title is displayed during the opening credits, it should come as no surprise to learn that Mark is a married man. Carly inadvertently reveals the affair to Mark’s wife, Kate (Leslie Mann), who is understandably upset and has her own way of dealing with it: befriending her husband’s mistress. Soon Kate and Carly are hanging out together, only to discover that Mark has another mistress, Amber (Kate Upton), which leads to a new plan. The three ladies become pals out to get back at the cheating man at the center of all of this.\n\nI want to get back to slow-mo boob shots and poop jokes, as this movie really seems to want to cash in on those aspects.The Other Woman was directed by Nick Cassavetes, who also brought audiences The Notebook and My Sister’s Keeper. The film was written by Melissa Stack who is basically a rookie in the film world. At some point, the two of them devised scenes that emphasize how attractive Kate Upton is, enough so that we have many scenes involving her ample endowments. At another point, these two found that the best way to create humor involved having a giant great dane take a dump on the floor of an apartment, only to be topped by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau having an explosive toilet scenario. Not every movie needs to be sophisticated and clever, but it also stands to reason that an opportunity was missed, when it comes to seeing one of the few movies being released in this time period to have a cast of female leads and have them do nothing more than approach scenes in a manner that suggests the direction of, “do what the boys do.”\n\nHere is the thing, I am happy to acknowledge that girls can be funny, gross, silly, or whatever and make that work in a film. It still needs to work though and my issue with The Other Woman is that it doesn’t work. Do these women have chemistry together? Kinda. Diaz does little beyond react to other actors in the film, Kate Upton brings up the energy, once she turns the group into a trifecta and adds her spin on ditziness to the equation, and Leslie Mann is easily the highlight, as she has always had a knack for comedic material. With all of that said, it does not add up to much. Save for some one-liners here and there and a committed physical performance by Mann, The Other Woman feels sloppily written, poorly directed, and compromised in places in order to achieve its PG-13, sacrificing any real edge it might have had. I guess this was needed though, as teenagers surely need a way to see three adult women deal with the harsh realities of adultery in the form of a farce. And did I mention slow-mo boob shots and poop jokes?\n\nIf this adds anything, I should note that Don Johnson and Nicki Minaj round out the cast. One is a womanizer and the other is a former man-eater/sassy black secretary. They don’t add much of anything to the film, but when else would I have been able to mention Johnson and Minaj in the same sentence (twice)? That statement was about as unnecessary as this movie is in its entirety.\n\nCarly: If we find any more mistresses I’m going to have to send her to rehab.\n\nAaron is a writer/reviewer for WhySoBlu.com. Follow him on Twitter @AaronsPS4.\n\nHe also co-hosts a podcast, Out Now with Aaron and Abe, available via iTunes or at HHWLOD.com.\n\nSex, Drugs, Car Chases – It’s Not High School, It’s ’21 Jump Street’\n\n21 Jump Street : 4 out of 5 Jenko: Always one strap it. Always So anyone that was hoping for the dark and gritty reboot of the 80s undercover cop drama 21 Jump Street in the same way that Michael Mann rebooted Miami Vice , they will be disappointed with what has actually been made. Instead, this is a delightfully funny and wild take on that material, which is like a crack-addicted blend between John Hughes and Lethal Weapon . This new take on 21 Jump Street maintains the same basic premise of assigning cops to undercover roles as high school kids, but ups the raunchy factor significantly. The film is at times crude, but also a lot cleverer and more self aware than one would expect. It is entertaining in a wonderfully over-the-top sort of way, with Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum making for a great comedic team.\n\nOut Now Bonus: Aaron And His Mom Discuss ‘The Babadook’\n\nThis bonus episode of Out Now with Aaron and Abe is a real treat. Aaron’s mother, Denise, returns to the podcast! She has recently seen the acclaimed Australian horror film The Babadook’ and really wanted to talk to Aaron about it, so here they are discussing the film in full. Keep in mind that this is a full-spoilers discussion of the film, so be sure to check out The Babadook , which is now available to rent or own and is currently streaming on Netflix.

Heather: Just the address. Starting this year out on the right foot, the latest entry in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise manages to put Hollywood in a position to go nowhere but up. I do enjoy my share of horror films and was happy to enter into this film with an open mind, but man is it terrible. Given my love for the original film and my general fondness for the second, the idea of a film billed as a direct continuation of the original entry written and directed by Tobe Hooper was slightly intriguing. Even in a post- Cabin in the Woods world, where horror movies can be boiled down to words on a dry erase board, I went for it. The results were not good. Texas Chainsaw 3D is not just a bad film, it is an idiotic one that literally cannot do basic math. Read on to find out why.\n\nThe Homesman Is Surreal, Grim Stuff (Movie Review)\n\nThe Homesman : 3 out of 5 Marry Bee Cuddy: Come on, girls. How grim is too grim and when does it just start becoming a little humorous? Earlier this year we had a novel idea for a film in the form of A Million Ways to Die in the West . That film did not work for me overall, but the idea of making a western film that put emphasis on how terrible a time it could really be was a funny one. Tommy Lee Jones’ second directorial effort, The Homesman , based on the novel by Glendon Swarthout, is a film that sits in grim territory, but pushes things so far that it becomes a strange sort of dark comedy. The film has a large cast of great actors, but they all provide merely decent to good performances. Hilary Swank stands out, but that makes sense, given that she does most of the heavy-lifting, with strong support from Jones to back her up. Really, the film seems confused by how sprawling it could be versus how effectively poignant it may be if the film felt a bit more consiste\n\nThe Evil Dead Drinking Game\n\nThe Evil Dead Drinking Game Groovy The Evil Dead trilogy is my favorite horror trilogy. It is a mix of classic genre tropes, over-the-top gore, comedy, and Three Stooges humor. Directed by Sam Raimi (the Spider-Man trilogy) and starring Bruce \"Don't Call Me Ash\" Campbell, the series has become a cult favorite for many, due to how entertaining it is. The following post is a set of rules for a drinking game that I have established, but beware - it's very easy to get trashed based on how often the rules come into play."
