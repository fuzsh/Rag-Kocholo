        "text": "Ms. Mackenzie Foy (The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn part 1&2, The Conjuring, and Interstellar) has been cast to play a teenaqer who befriend Black Beauty. Meanwhile Oscar-winner Ms. Kate Winslet will provide the voice of Black Beauty's inner thoughts. Mr. Jeremy Bolt and Mr. Robert Kulzer of Constantin Film will produce the project while Mr. Martin Moszkowicz will executive produce it.\n\nThe film adaptation of Black Beauty will be directed and written by Mrs. Ashley Avis. I'm pleased to inform you that I had an interview with this talented director/screenwriter on July 27, 2018 about this very movie so go ahead and read that interview by clicking the link: My interview with Mrs. Ashley Avis\n\nThe best-selling children's classic, published in 1877, has been adapted numerous times for television and film.Ms. Anna Sewell, the author, sadly died just five months after publication hence never seeing the popularity of her book.\n\nâ€‹source material: www.hollywoodreporter.com"
