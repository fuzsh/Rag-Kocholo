        "text": "Britain has produced many stars in Hollywood – we’ve had legendary actors like Roger Moore and Sean Connery famously portraying Bond. We also saw Henry Cavill and Robert Pattinson wow audiences worldwide with their hot looks and acting talent. Your ladies aren’t doing bad either. The likes of Kate Winslet and Kate Beckinsale have starred in some of the biggest blockbusters in history. Well, if there’s one Brit to follow in those famous footsteps, it’s Ben Lamb. Find out more about this rising star including his biography, age, wife or girlfriend here.\n\nBen Lamb Bio (Age)\n\nBen Lamb was born on the 24th day of January 1989 in Devon, Exeter. There isn’t much information about his family background, parents’ names, or any possible siblings he may have. However, if there’s one thing that’s obvious about Lamm, it’s that he’s well trained. He attended renowned institutions such as Eton and Oxford University. For those who may not know, Eton is one of the best secondary schools in England. It is considered a breeding ground for British politicians and has produced at least 18 Prime Ministers. Notable alumni include David Cameron, Prince Harry, Prince William and Eddie Redmayne.\n\nBen Lamb fell in love with acting at the age of 18. On a certain day he was singing and someone suggested using his singing talents in opera. He took the advice and took part in at least two operas. Lamb found that he preferred acting to singing and decided to explore further. He took part in several of his school’s plays and also joined a local youth theater.\n\nAfter graduating from university, Ben Lamb enrolled at the prestigious Royal Academy for Dramatic Arts, where he developed his talent. He received a Bachelor of Arts in acting from the institution, graduating in 2010. After graduating, Ben Lamb joined the National Youth Theater. He toured the UK with them for a year and took part in several productions.\n\nLeaving youth theater, Lamb landed roles in several Shakespearean plays such as Macbeth and The Merchant of Venice. Lamb made his way onto screens through several BBC dramas. One of them was The Silk , a legal drama centered on a series of criminal trial attorneys attempting to attain the prestigious QC rank."
