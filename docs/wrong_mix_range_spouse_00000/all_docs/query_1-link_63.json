        "text": "Downton Abbey scooped the biggest prize as Brits bashed the Yanks at Sunday’s Golden Globes.\n\nKate Winslet got in on the act by claiming Best Actress in a TV series for Mildred Pierce and Idris Elba took home Best Actor for BBC’s Luther.\n\nSeries creator Julian Fellowes joined Downton stars Hugh Bonneville and Elizabeth McGovern to accept the best drama mini series award, and said: “The whole Downton adventure has been a fabulous one.\n\n\"Like spotting a promising child and waking up to find they have won the Olympics. That’s what we’ve lived through.”\n\nRicky Gervais hosted the ceremony for the third year – but kept it relatively tame after being shocking in previous years.\n\nA-listers including Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, Madonna, Johnny Depp and George Clooney were braced for more controversy at LA’s Beverly Hilton Hotel.\n\nBut the 50-year-old comic steered clear of near-the-knuckle material, although he did quip: “The Golden Globes are to the Oscars what Kim Kardashian is to Kate Middleton. Bit louder. Bit trashier. Bit drunker. And more easily bought – allegedly.”\n\nHe also said that organisers, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, were threatening not to invite him back for a fourth time – if he offended any of the guests.\n\nHe went on: “They gave me a list of rules, and this is real. No profanity, that’s fine, I’ve got a huge vocabulary. No nudity. See, that’s a shame, because I’ve got a huge vocabulary, but a tiny penis. It works. I don’t care.\n\n“No smut or innuendo, and I’m not to libel anyone. And I mustn’t mention Mel Gibson. Not his private life, his politics, his films, and especially not Jodie Foster’s Beaver.”\n\nThe last gag was a reference to Gibson and Foster’s 2011 box office flop, The Beaver.\n\nOther big winners on the night included George Clooney’s movie The Descendants and Meryl Streep for her role as Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady.\n\nThe 62-year-old star almost upstaged Gervais by swearing as she accepted the award and said: “I’ve got to thank everybody in England that let me come and trample over their history.”\n\nAdmitting she did not have a positive view of the former Prime Minister before the film, she added: “I did what we all do to political figures we don’t agree with — turn them into something more than human and less than human at the same time.”\n\nMovies The Artist, Hugo and My Week With Marilyn were also well received, while Madonna picked up a gong for her original song to accompany her directorial debut in new film W.E.\n\n* Jessica Biel’s red carpet style – wedding dress or Leighton Meester copycat?\n\n* Angelina Jolie's silk thigh slit dress and sleek up ‘do is red carpet winner\n\n* Ricky Gervais jokes about Kim Kardashian\n\n* Sarah Michelle Gellar shocks in tie-dye gown\n\n* Kelly Osbourne debuts dramatic grey hair and spiked shoulder dress\n\n* Heidi Klum’s nude dress fitting\n\n* All black and white at awards tea party\n\n* Ricky Gervais promises more outrage as Golden Globes host\n\n* Top 10 Golden Globes best red carpet dresses\n\n* Top 10 Golden Globes fashion disasters\n\n* Ricky Gervais' funniest gags from the Golden Globes in 2011 and 2010\n\n* Top 10 embarrassing Golden Globes moments\n\nGOLDEN GLOBES FASHION\n\nGOLDEN GLOBES NOMINEES\n\nBest Motion Picture - Drama\n\nThe Descendants, The Help, Hugo, The Ides Of March, Moneyball, War Horse\n\nBest Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama\n\nGlenn Close – Albert Nobbs, Viola Davis – The Help, Rooney Mara – The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, Meryl Streep – Iron Lady, Tilda Swinton – We Need To Talk About Kevin\n\nBest Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Drama\n\nGeorge Clooney – The Descendants, Leonardo DiCaprio – J.
