As such, our greatest debt is to the conference director Pam Cook, who first came up with the idea of a multidisciplinary academic gathering on the topic of Titanic, and who had the intellectual and creative energy to make it happen. It is to a great extent due to her inspiration, and not least her hard work in preparing the event, that the conference became the stimulating, collegial, and pleasurable experience that it was, as surely everyone who was present will agree. Pam has remained throughout the genesis of this collection an important mentor, and has given her unfaltering support to it in many different ways, for which we are immensely grateful. We thus dedicate this book to Pam. Further thanks are due to the Conference Administrator Jo Wilcock, and the original Conference Organising Committee, which included Deniz Göktürk, Mike Hammond, and Lucy Mazdon, as well as many other colleagues in the School of Modern Languages and the Faculty of Arts at Southampton who helped with the event. From outside, Simon Brown, Ludo Craddock, Simon Mills, Jeffrey Richards, and Michael Wedel provided invaluable advice and support. Without the generous financial aid and sponsorship of The British Academy, the Faculty of Arts at the University of Southampton, the Goethe Institute London, Southern Arts, and W&G Baird Ltd., Belfast, the conference and the present book, would have been impossible. In the process of transforming a series of articles into the present collection, our thanks go to Philippa Brewster and Deborah Susman at I. B. Tauris, and to Peter Russell for designing and typesetting the manuscript. For their assistance with illustrations, we are grateful to our contributors, Sarah Hammond, Dimos Glynos, the British Film Institute, the Filmmuseum Berlin—Deutsche Kinemathek, and Marian Stefanowski.\n\nTitanicprels\n\n26.10.03\n\n8:04 pm\n\nPage x\n\nTitanicprels\n\n26.10.03\n\n8:04 pm\n\nPage xi\n\nNotes on Contributors T B is Senior Lecturer at the University of Southampton, where he teaches Film Studies.

The name of the ship itself has entered vernacular language to become a byword of both human hubris and heroism, and of misguided trust in the securities of modern technology. The Titanic’s sinking has been interpreted as signalling the end of the imperial, th century world order and as a premonition of World War One. Indeed, apart from the main dates associated with the two World Wars in the first half of the century, and the demise of the Eastern Bloc near the end of it, there have been few other historical caesura in the th century that have imposed such a marked distinction between ‘before’ and ‘after’ in the collective historical imagination of the West. In this respect the Titanic tragedy and its reception has found an eerie echo at the beginning of the st century in the way the attack on the World Trade Centre in  has been seen to mark a historical turning point, seemingly collapsing in a single catastrophic event previously held certainties, boundaries, and values, and raising doubts and anxieties over what may eventually distinguish the world after the catastrophe from what has come before. In the case of Titanic, which might well serve as both precedent and template for future interpretations of ‘/’, growing temporal distance has made it difficult to reconnect to the realities of the actual event, and to recapture the traumatic effect it had on the survivors, as well as on countless relatives of perished passengers and crew. Nevertheless, memories of this effect (as well as a diminishing constituency of those personally affected) still persist today, particularly in the cities of Belfast and Southampton, where respectively the Titanic was built and set sail for New York on its maiden voyage. Nearly a century on, the legacy of the Titanic still very much remains part of the psychological fabric, collective self-perception, and external promotion of these communities. On the other hand, it is precisely the passing of time, the receding of personal involvement, memory and grief, and thus the event’s abstraction from private and local histories, that have heightened Titanic’s status as a mythical object and as a symbolic event on a more international scale. Titanic has inspired a great wealth of representations across different art forms and media, and across a multitude of different national and cultural contexts. The tragedy has been appropriated to articulate and justify a wide spectrum of ideological positions on issues such as class, gender, national identity, capitalism and\n\nS\n\nTitanic00\n\n26.10.03\n\n\n\n8:12 pm\n\nPage 2\n\nTim Bergfelder and Sarah Street\n\nmedia manipulation, political propaganda, and collective mourning and remembrance. The history of the Titanic is thus a prism which facilitates an almost infinite range of different stories to be narrativised. Moreover, Titanic continues to engage and fascinate new generations, witnessed for example by the phenomenal box office success of James Cameron’s Hollywood fictionalisation Titanic (), the global industry and receptive market for Titanic memorabilia, which is as thriving as ever and shows no signs of abating, or the arguably morbid proposals to make the site of the sunken wreck a tourist destination for international thrill-seekers. Thus, while the Titanic is frequently perceived to relate to a closing door on th century values, it is also very much a symbol of th century experience, whose continuing fascination thrives on heritage tourism and consumerism, but, not least, also on a plethora of cultural meditations and representations which articulate different, and continuing, meanings of the tragedy. The aim of The Titanic in Myth and Memory is to provide an account of the variety, in terms of cultural medium, historical chronology, and national context, of perceptions and representations of the Titanic disaster. It is widely acknowledged that James Cameron’s film played a crucial role in re-energising and multiplying an interest in the Titanic from the late s onwards. This present anthology, however, aspires to a historically and culturally more inclusive perspective, which allows for Cameron’s film to be appreciated in its lineage from, and in comparison with, a variety of other representations. It is striking how quickly the Titanic became embedded within visual and literary culture from immediately after the disaster in the form of contemporary reportage, photographs of anxious relatives waiting for news at the White Star Line offices, the multitudes of illustrations depicting the ship’s collision with the iceberg, publication of the official inquiries and imaginative, filmic and literary meditations on the ship’s sinking. Indeed the Titanic was, as several authors in this collection demonstrate, in the popular imagination many years before the actual disaster occurred, in the form of articles and books about ships colliding with icebergs, providing eerie testament to the many premonitions people subsequently confessed to have experienced before the event. In this sense the Titanic is a cultural phenomenon whose many and varied facets can only be adequately grasped from a multidisciplinary perspective. With this perspective in mind, The Titanic in Myth and Memory draws on the expertise of scholars from different academic disciplines, including history, film and cultural studies, and literary studies. We hope that this approach facilitates the perception of similarities and connections as well as differences in the way subsequent generations of artists and audiences (which includes critics and academics as well as Titanic enthusiasts) have made sense of, and utilised, the Titanic tragedy. In this respect, the book differs in its approach and methodology from previous publications on the topic, which have fre-\n\nTitanic00\n\n26.10.03\n\n8:12 pm\n\nPage 3\n\nIntroduction\n\n\n\nquently concentrated more on historically or culturally focussed or mediumspecific aspects.1 By contrast, this anthology aims to show not only how the Titanic disaster has been represented in a range of different media, but also how it has been adapted and translated in a variety of cultural contexts into nationally specific and meaningful responses. While, as we have argued above, the Titanic’s sinking has reverberated far beyond its immediate local context, it is notable that this impact has not been distributed equally across the globe, nor has the reception of the event been the same in different cultures. First, despite its seemingly universal themes, Titanic is not necessarily a universal myth. It is a myth predominantly created and sustained over the decades by the West, extending beyond its transatlantic associations primarily where countries and individuals from outside have wished to partake in this particular Western heritage by proxy. A recent example of such cultural mimicry have been South African and Japanese initiatives in the s to build replicas of Titanic for themed tourist experiences.2 Meanwhile, the two countries which have seen the most prolific cultural responses to the disaster, and which continue to produce them, are unsurprisingly those that were originally most affected by it, Great Britain and the United States. The cultural responses from these two countries since , ranging from high literature (Thomas Hardy, Joseph Conrad, H. G. Wells, Virginia Woolf, Beryl Bainbridge, Julian Barnes, among many others) and experimental musical compositions (Gavin Bryars, Ronan Magill) to cartoons and popular songs of America’s hit music factory Tin-Pan Alley, have been comprehensively mapped by Steven Biel’s Down with the Old Canoe: A Cultural History of the Titanic Disaster (largely for the American context), and by John Wilson Foster’s The Titanic Complex (mainly on the British context).3 Given the vast number and diversity of cultural expressions and ideological positions charted in these two books (among a plethora of other collections, monographs, and journal articles), it would be too simplistic to define an easily classifiable American or British ‘take’ on Titanic. Nonetheless, if one wished to indicate at least some broad trends and tendencies, American appropriations and commentaries appear to have interpreted the event more often as an opportunity for the levelling of class boundaries and thus as a lesson in social progress, invariably embodied by the promise of the American dream (in this respect, then, James Cameron’s film constitutes only the latest in a long line of similar interpretations), whereas in British responses a more elegiac, commemorative, and melancholy tone has prevailed. Apart from Britain and America, the countries where Titanic has made a comparably profound cultural impact appear to have been especially those that share all or some of the following characteristics which connect them, or have connected them in the past, to a transatlantic axis – a significant heritage of ship building and maritime trade; a dominantly Protestant culture built on\n\nTitanic00\n\n26.10.03\n\n\n\n8:12 pm\n\nPage 4\n\nTim Bergfelder and Sarah Street\n\nthe moral privileging of self-denial and civil duty; a long history of sustained emigration to America; and present or past aspirations towards, or possession of, naval power. These criteria may provide at least a partial explanation for the proliferation of cultural responses to the Titanic in Scandinavia and Germany (which qualifies for all the characteristics above), as opposed to the relative paucity of representations in France or other Southern European countries. France may have competed in the first half of the th century with Britain and Germany in the transatlantic shipping trade, yet it could confidently rely on a national maritime counter-symbol to the Titanic, the ocean liner Normandie, which contrasted Titanic’s myth of lamentable but honourable class tragedy with an optimistic paean to French craftsmanship.4 German culture, by contrast, appears to have been drawn especially to the socially apocalyptic and elementally human dimensions of the Titanic myth, and has, in the process, contributed some of the artistically most ambitious expressions to the Titanic canon. As in Britain and America, the trope of the sinking transatlantic ocean liner as a metaphor of both cataclysmic social change (which would come true for Germany in the radical political overhaul following the end of World War One), and of the shifting cultural hierarchies between Europe and the United States, preceded the actual Titanic disaster by some time. The publication of Gerhart Hauptmann’s novel Atlantis (), in which the main protagonist survives the sinking of an ocean liner on his journey to America, for example, quite spectacularly coincided with the breaking news about Titanic (the book’s unexpected topicality led to a film adaptation the following year, by the Danish company Nordisk). In fact, the narrative had first been conceived by the author during a transatlantic passage dating back to , and articulated, as Deniz Göktürk has argued, the author’s deep ambivalences about the United States in general, and the prospect of a future dominated by American popular culture in particular.5 Transatlantic traffic by ship also features in Franz Kafka’s novel fragment Amerika, the uncharacteristic utopianism of which contrasts markedly with Hauptmann’s suspicions about American culture. Although the final text lacks any direct reference to the Titanic, Kafka was an avid reader of travelogues and thus undoubtedly familiar with the details of the tragedy, when he wrote the majority of the text in the year of the disaster, .6 In the same year, Thomas Mann, whose patrician Hanseatic family history is inextricably bound up with maritime trade, began work on his novel Der Zauberberg (The Magic Mountain). This novel not only features, as Alan Bance has pointed out, a main protagonist whose background is in ship engineering, but also the societal microcosm of an Alpine sanatorium which is compared with the doomed ocean liner. According to one of the novel’s characters, the ship’s trajectory charts in Freudian analogy ‘the precarious life-journey of the individual ego borne along above the unfathomable depths of the unconscious’.7\n\nTitanic00\n\n26.10.03\n\n8:12 pm\n\nPage 5\n\nIntroduction\n\n\n\nArguably the most significant representation of the Titanic in visual art, too, originates in Germany in , with Max Beckmann’s The Sinking of the Titanic. Beckmann’s painting interestingly emphasises not the ship (which sinks, barely noticed, in the distant background), but, in a knowing homage to Géricault’s famous The Raft of the Medusa, it concentrates on the chaos that emanates from the lifeboats in which the survivors are huddled together. Reviewing a recent retrospective of Beckmann’s work, Charles Darwent has pointed not only to some fundamental differences between the two paintings, but also to the debt that Beckmann’s representation owes to established traditions in German art. In doing so, Darwent identifies some of the characteristics of German Titanic representations more generally: Where the passengers on Géricault’s The Raft of the Medusa are lent a kind of dignity as actors in a political allegory, Beckmann’s are merely wet and scared. Heroism here doesn’t lie in power, but in the acceptance of powerlessness: a tendency in German art that can be traced back to medieval depictions of Christ as a Man of Sorrows, bloodied and bowed, in works like Grünewald’s Isenheim altarpiece.8\n\nAs in Britain and the United States, then, German artistic engagements with the Titanic disaster have covered not only a wide spectrum of cultural hierarchies and media (ranging from the distinctly high-brow examples referred to above to popular cartoons, and films), but also of political viewpoints, ranging from the left-wing scepticism of Hans Magnus Enzensberger, via Thomas Mann’s bourgeois humanism, to the Nazi propaganda of Herbert Selpin’s film version of the disaster in . It is precisely this diversity that this anthology aims to capture and analyse. The Titanic in Myth and Memory is subdivided into three major sections. Part One covers general historical issues as well as literary adaptations, and opens with two contributions on the local reception of the disaster in Belfast and Southampton, cities inextricably tied up with the ship in terms of labour, respectively shipbuilding, and providing crew. John Hill’s discussion of the links between the Titanic and Belfast (dubbed ‘Titanic Town’) shows how the memory of the ship can be related to specific issues of class, religion and national identification that are pertinent to Northern Ireland. Michael Hammond, meanwhile, not only addresses the impact the disaster had on the city of Southampton, the port of Titanic’s departure, but he also analyses the symbolism of memorial imagery (exemplified by the format of the newspaper cartoon, and of memorial sculpture), and memorial rhetoric (as in contemporary news reports), as well as their contribution to local attempts in coming to terms with the tragedy. Hammond frames these responses within and across the contrasting registers of modernism and melodrama. Hill’s and Hammond’s locally specific analyses are followed by a study by John Wilson Foster on how contemporary discourses on occultism and the supernatural (primarily centred on\n\nTitanic00\n\n26.10.03\n\n\n\n8:12 pm\n\nPage 6\n\nTim Bergfelder and Sarah Street\n\nthe British context) were employed in narratives about the disaster. Foster reminds us that the sinking of the Titanic coincided with a decline in Christianity and rise of spiritualism, providing many with an other-worldly imperative to interpret the event as a vector for anti-materialist sentiment. Foster’s chapter details in particular how journalist and spiritualist W. T. Stead, author of a story published in  in the Pall Mall Gazette, predicted the fate of the Titanic. After Stead drowned when the Titanic sank (ironically en route to a spiritualist convention) spiritualists claimed to have communicated with him from beyond the grave. The remaining contributions in this section engage with a number of literary responses to the Titanic, which amount, as the title of Peter Middleton and Tim Woods’ chapter suggests, to an archive of th century memory, seen through the prism of historical trauma. In terms of chronology the two popular Scandinavian novels, one Swedish, one Finnish, discussed by Peter Björkfors, constitute some of the earliest entries in this archive, since they were published soon after the tragedy. As Björkfors argues, by making their central protagonists respectively Swedish and Finnish, the novels allowed their nationally targeted readership a greater degree of identification with the disaster, while also channelling nationally distinctive contemporary attitudes and beliefs about issues ranging from national stereotypes and prejudices, emigration, and moral conventions. Peter Middleton and Tim Woods are particularly interested in the accumulative effect of successive literary engagements with the Titanic, and especially those which, as most prominently in Titanic lore Walter Lord’s A Night To Remember (), create and perpetuate in their blurring of fiction and fact what the chapter terms ‘textual memory’. As Middleton and Woods argue, a textual memory based on trauma, as in the case of the Titanic, can function both as a therapeutic and, in a negative sense, as a mind-numbing anaesthetic to displace and repress mentally the conditions of (post-)modernity: Theories of repression and trauma are compelling because they offer solutions to the detemporalisation and anachronisms of modern experiences of spacetime, bypassing or inverting causality in the Nachträglichkeit of hindsight, but these solutions also easily collude with or wholly give in to dominant narratives of history.\n\nKenneth Womack provides a more optimistic approach to the therapeutic use value of the Titanic myth as a kind of post-traumatic Bildungsroman (a frame of reference used in a later contribution by Susan Sydney-Smith), and he correlates the literary representation of the Titanic disaster with current diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in the area of ‘survival psychology’. Womack’s chapter opens with a useful summary of some of the many recent literary adaptations of the Titanic story (ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous), before analysing in greater depth three contemporary fictionalisations by Cynthia Bass, Robert Olen Butler, and Beryl Bainbridge. In all three texts\n\nTitanic00\n\n26.10.03\n\n8:12 pm\n\nPage 7\n\nIntroduction\n\n\n\nWomack identifies explicit attempts at ideologically repositioning and re-purposing the Titanic myth for a contemporary readership, attempts which also chart the myth’s transfer from being a quintessentially modern(ist) event to becoming a post-modern one. Alasdair King’s contribution discusses one of the formally most unusual literary responses to the Titanic, and moreover a text that looks as much backwards to the heyday of modernist euphoria and hope as forwards to the uncertainties of post-modernity, Hans-Magnus Enzensberger’s epic, booklength poem Der Untergang der Titanic (The Sinking of the Titanic, ). As King documents, Enzensberger employs the narrative of the sinking ocean liner as a metaphor for the failing utopian aspirations of the left-leaning West German intelligentsia in the s. Beyond this nationally and historically specific context, however, Enzensberger’s understanding of the Titanic disaster, and of the notion of social apocalypse more generally, appears to share the postmodernism of a Jean Baudrillard, when he argues that apocalypse is simultaneously ‘omnipresent’, yet ‘not real’. However, unlike Baudrillard who postulates a break between the past and an apocalyptic future, Enzensberger uses the Titanic disaster to demonstrate that the notion of apocalypse (the ‘catastrophe in our heads’) is, as King argues, a ‘transhistorical’ and ‘enduring’ phenomenon. In this respect, then, Enzensberger’s appropriation of the Titanic disaster simultaneously adopts postmodernist literary techniques (most notably the use of falsifications, fragments, and pastiches of historical authenticity), and at the same time provides a critique of postmodern historiography. Part Two introduces filmic adaptations made before Cameron’s landmark film in , including case studies from Britain, Germany, and the United States. As several authors argue in this section, the Titanic’s fate was rapidly taken up after the event by the burgeoning film industries in Europe and the United States.9 Moreover, the disaster and the earliest cinematic Titanic adaptations occurred precisely at the crucial historical moment at which film turned from being a technological novelty and fairground attraction towards becoming the most dominant form of mass entertainment and medium of news dissemination in the th century. In this respect, the history of the Titanic myth and the history of cinema, both as a narrative and representational medium, and as a public sphere, are closely intertwined, as Michael Hammond argues elsewhere in this collection. It is this historical conjuncture that is also the central theme of Michael Wedel’s discussion of the long believed lost, and only recently rediscovered German film In Night and Ice (), which, while not being the first ever Titanic film, was shot only months after the actual event. Wedel’s chapter thus illustrates how quickly global mythologisation and fictionalisation followed the tragedy. Subsequent adaptations, too, have coincided with significant moments not only in general, but also in film history. Thus, as discussed by Robert Peck\n\nTitanic00\n\n26.10.03\n\n\n\n8:12 pm\n\nPage 8\n\nTim Bergfelder and Sarah Street\n\nhere, the Anglo-German co-production Atlantic (, based on a well-known stage play and shot in three different language versions) was the first of many such multi-lingual films made after the introduction of sound, with which European film industries hoped to compete with Hollywood. In this economic and cultural dynamic, the Titanic myth provided a suitably spectacular as well as transnationally appealing subject. Paul M. Malone’s contribution, by contrast, concerns Titanic (), a film version produced during World War II by the Nazis as a vehicle for anti-British sentiment. The film’s extraordinary production history (which culminated in the director’s death in Gestapo custody) and its subsequent exhibition and reception, demonstrates on the one hand the topic’s susceptibility to tendentious propaganda, but on the other it documents the Titanic myth’s ability to transcend, or even resist, its functionalisation by ideology. Thus, although originally intended to represent and criticise British hubris and arrogance, Titanic ultimately reflected back on the hubris and political defeat of the regime that commissioned it. The s witnessed the release of the two best known film adaptations prior to Cameron, the Hollywood-produced Titanic (), and the British A Night To Remember (). Although released in the political climate of the Cold War, and coinciding with the gradual decline of film as a mass medium and the ascendancy of television, these two films reflect their historical context more obliquely, and instead primarily raise issues of gender and class. Sarah Street demonstrates, for example, that the ship’s spatial design was used in A Night to Remember as a geographic map of the class structures of Edwardian England. A detailed analysis of the film reveals the extent to which it deploys a striking use of realist conventions that are both spectacular and political. In its episodic structure, so typical of contemporary British films, A Night to Remember adhered closely to the details in Walter Lord’s book, notably resisting the temptation to develop a fictional narrative along the lines of Cameron’s focus on Jack and Rose. Yet, as Street’s chapter reveals, the film retains a sense of suspense and tragedy that has been difficult to follow. As this and other British films of the period developed themes of class identity and antagonism, Richard Taylor and Alan Finlayson show how the American Titanic provided a key register of contemporary discourses on gender, as well as demonstrating, in its antipathy towards Europe, the extent to which isolationist politics persisted in s America. However, one could argue that by assigning the film’s most acerbically intelligent, and self-reflective, dialogue to the snobbish pro-European sentiment articulated by the film’s most charismatic, if also most effeminate, character, leaves the film with a somewhat conflicting ideological message about both national identity and normative masculinity in the United States of the s. In sum, this section documents how filmic representations fast appropriated the disaster as entertainment and (not always unambiguous) propaganda, pro-\n\nTitanic00\n\n26.10.03\n\n8:12 pm\n\nPage 9\n\nIntroduction\n\n\n\nviding Cameron with a wealth of images, narrative conventions, and dramatic constellations, many of which he drew upon for his Hollywood blockbuster. A frame of comparative reference that is striking is filmic claims to ‘authenticity’, particularly in the use of various technologies to depict the giant ship. While early film representations drew on the scant amount of actual footage of the ship and on illustrations from the popular press, later ones embarked on a quest to depict the event as ‘accurately’ as possible. Charting the ship’s demise through celluloid therefore provides a fascinating register of film styles and technologies that are frequently invited to rise to the ‘realist’ challenge of depicting the monumental ship in a way that does justice to the popular imagination. This section shows how this mix, also influenced by generic and national traditions, produced intriguing and distinguished precursors to Cameron’s film. Part Three is about the blockbuster Titanic (), and addresses a number of theoretical issues, such as race, national identity, masculinity, genre, and technology. These essays complement the material produced on Cameron’s film in Gaylyn Studlar and Kevin S. Sandler’s book Anatomy of a Blockbuster, bringing into focus themes relating to ideological context, theoretical insights and the issue of technology which was at the heart of the film’s promotion. Above all, this film, with its fictional love-story and use of contemporary film stars, brought the th century popular fascination with the Titanic to the surface again. Inspired by Walter Lord’s book A Night to Remember, and the British film of the same name, as these contributors illustrate, Cameron’s film delivered an adaptation of the event in a manner which addressed contem-porary audiences. At the same time, as both Gaylyn Studlar’s and Peter Krämer’s contributions stress, the film is impossible to understand without acknowledging its deep roots in the conventions of classical Hollywood story-telling and marketing. Concerns with class, race and ‘otherness’, as well as with feminism and gender, were key elements of this film’s blockbuster status and box-office success. Different critical positions have resulted from analysing this film. For example, while in the accounts of Susan Sydney-Smith and Sean Redmond the character Rose appears as a proto-feminist ‘new woman’ of the th century, for Gerstner she is the result of masculine influence, ingenuity and power. SydneySmith and Redmond compare Titanic to British ‘heritage’ films, identifying a similar concern to depict the past in such a way that meets audiences’ expectations of a particular period, creating a myth of the past regardless of whether this is accurate or not. As well as via the aesthetic conventions of the heritage film, the Titanic phenomenon can also be linked to heritage tourism, with its generation of commodities (posters, the ‘Heart of the Ocean’ necklace’, CDs, key-rings, pens and models of the ship) that are seen, paradoxically, to relate to a by-gone era of safety and security. Cameron’s film therefore taps into this\n\nTitanic00\n\n26.10.03\n\n\n\n8:12 pm\n\nPage 10\n\nTim Bergfelder and Sarah Street\n\ntrend, resulting in a seductive mise-en-scène that has fuelled a desire to possess artefacts that have been created as ‘Past Times’ commodities. While the film is critical of class structures which are identified with Europe, at the same time it displays the possessions of the rich as desirable, feeding into a materialist culture. This contradictory address makes the film such an apt case-study of how the Titanic myth is ‘re-written’ by different generations. Another key theme in this section is the impact of new technology on the representation of the disaster, enabling, as Aylish Wood argues, narrative forms that showcase special effects as spectacular interventions in their own right. In their construction, however, Mark J. P. Wolf demonstrates that the special effects nevertheless underscore the film’s claims to emotional realism. From different perspectives both K. J. Donnelly and Peter Krämer discuss how the film’s musical soundtrack relates to genre, film history and to conceptions of ‘otherness’ in the film. The consumerist dimensions of the Titanic, in terms of creating an industry of memorabilia which taps into economic aspects of ‘heritage’, are further highlighted by Donnelly in his discussion of the commodification of ‘Irishness’. This process is most apparent in the film’s use of Irish music, emphasising an aspect of the disaster (the fate of the Irish passengers) that was not foregrounded in previous film accounts. Indeed, the public’s insatiable curiosity about aspects of the disaster that was first evident in  continues to dominate the reception of this film, a trend that is likely to increase in the build-up to the centenary of the disaster in . We hope that this book will therefore serve several useful purposes. Its stress on multidisciplinary work across visual and literary representations that have spanned more than a century illustrates a range of responses to what can be described, in Hayden White’s terms, as a ‘modernist event’.10 From the moment contemporary accounts proliferated, the disaster became mythologised by the numerous representations discussed in this collection, rendering the Titanic ‘visible’ through a plethora of books, films, illustrations and memories. Yet these accounts are not mere ‘fictions’, the most elaborate being Cameron’s film, with its tension between melodrama and quest for ‘realism’. Rather, they are indeed traces of popular fascinations, imaginations and identities, elements that are as much a part of history as more celebrated occurrences. In this sense, the myth and memory of the Titanic remain a strong force in contemporary culture.\n\nNotes 1\n\nFor example, Kevin S.

It was the serial number on the ship, they say that if you held it up to a mirror it read:   . . . So they were bound to have no luck of the ship. Ill-fated. Like the city itself.’  , Titanic Town2 ‘We believe that the vibrancy, optimism and commitment that made Titanic such a majestic ship in her time lives on and is reflected through the resurgence of Belfast today.

The Titanic was, of course, made at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast and, as a result, has held associations for people in Belfast, as well as Ireland more generally, that it has not possessed elsewhere. Thus, while the city from which the ship set sail, Southampton, has figured extensively in public imaginings of the disaster, the role of Belfast has achieved much less prominence. There are, of course, some obvious reasons for this. Following the completion of the Oceanic in , Harland and Wolff had a close relationship with the White Star Line shipping company and was responsible for the production of virtually all of its vessels. The sinking of the ship was a blow to the prestige of both companies which then had an economic interest in playing down their involvement. The damage to the pride of Harland and Wolff, however, also assumed a more political and ideological aspect within the Irish context. As a number of commentators have noted, the launch of the Titanic coincided with Unionist opposition to Home Rule (involving the repeal of the Act of Union and the establishment of a parliament in Dublin). Indeed, the ship set sail from Southampton only the day before the third Irish Home Rule Bill was introduced into the British House of Commons. Much of the hostility of Unionists\n\nTitanic01\n\n26.10.03\n\n\n\n8:13 pm\n\nPage 16\n\nJohn Hill\n\nto Home Rule derived from the industrial character of the north-east of Ireland and its close economic links with Britain and the British Empire. Along with linen and engineering, shipbuilding was central to the region’s prosperity and therefore an emblem of the Unionist cause. Inevitably, the sinking of the Titanic wounded Unionist pride in Belfast’s shipbuilding capacity and tempered some of the economic self-confidence associated with it. John Wilson Foster goes so far as to suggest that the loss of the ship became an unconscious symbol of ‘the thwarted nationhood of Ulster Protestants’.4 Given that Unionist opposition to Home Rule was aimed at preserving the union with Britain rather than giving voice to an Ulster nationalism, this is probably an interpretative step too far. However, it does successfully indicate something of the intimate relation that existed between Ulster Unionism and shipbuilding at this politically volatile time. This link is confirmed by the specific circumstances prevailing within the shipyard during the same period. Although the Harland and Wolff chairman, William James Pirrie, had expressed Home Rule sympathies, the complexion of the company was pre-eminently Unionist. The firm’s owners, Edward Harland and Gustav Wolff, had both served as Conservative MPs for Belfast constituencies with Protestant majorities. The workforce, moreover, was overwhelmingly Protestant and, during , there were sectarian assaults on Catholic workers, and expulsions from the shipyard, as a result of the political atmosphere. For many in Ireland, it was the religious and political character of the workforce that came to be held responsible for the fate of the ship. As Mary Costello’s semi-autobiographical novel Titanic Town suggests, this took the form of popular beliefs about the ship’s number enshrining anti-Catholic sentiments or Protestant workers ‘cursing the Pope’ when the ship was being built.5 While a conversation amongst workers in James Plunkett’s Dublin novel Strumpet City () suggests that these sentiments acquired rapid currency, they did not find formal expression in the nationalist press of the time and probably only achieved widespread circulation in the wake of the expulsion of Catholic workers from the shipyard in  and the establishment of a separate Unionist parliament in the North in .6 For while the sinking of the ship was open to interpretation in terms of Unionist hubris, it was a disaster with consequences that reverberated across the whole of Ireland. This was due to the substantial number of Irish passengers who had boarded the ship at Queenstown (now Cobh) in Co. Cork and the resulting loss of lives amongst the Irish on board. While, in one light, the deaths of so many Irish Catholics could be seen as compounding the offence of Ulster Unionism, the sheer scale of the humanitarian catastrophe weighed against the public articulation of such a view. Nevertheless, the circumstances surrounding the loss of the ship meant that the memorialisation of the Titanic remained problematic for both Harland\n\nTitanic01\n\n26.10.03\n\n8:13 pm\n\nPage 17\n\nThe Relaunching of Ulster Pride: The Titanic, Belfast and Film\n\n\n\nand Wolff, and Ulster Unionism more generally. A memorial statue was unveiled in Belfast in  but, following the partition of Ireland and the foundation of a semi-state in Northern Ireland under Unionist rule, there was little enthusiasm for preserving the memory of Belfast’s associations with the Titanic. Two incidents at the BBC in the s and s illustrate well the sensitivities involved. In , the White Star Line (which had been exercised by the negative impact upon British shipping of the  film Atlantic) had successfully put pressure on the BBC to abandon plans for a radio play dealing with the disaster. In , when the BBC in London announced plans for a talk on the sinking of the ship by the Titanic survivor, Charles Lightoller, the BBC in Northern Ireland also became involved. BBC NI enjoyed a close relationship with the Unionist establishment and the NI Programme Director, John Sutthery, wrote to the Director of Regional Relations in London, complaining that ‘[t]he “Titanic”, and everything to do with it’ was ‘an extremely sore point in Belfast history’. ‘[N]ot only’, he continued, ‘were some  Belfast people drowned—mostly rather important people—but also it was a very grave set-back to civic pride when this much-vaunted ship went out from Harland and Wolff’s yard to sink on its maiden voyage’.7 Although the BBC in London decided to proceed with the broadcast, they assured their Northern Irish colleagues that they were alert to ‘the risks involved’ and that the resulting talk would be ‘quite innocuous’.8 A similar incident also occurred in  when the BBC in London planned a programme on the Titanic as part of its ‘Sensation’ series. As before, Cunard (the owners of White Star since ) offered up objections to which the BBC responded by eliminating all ‘invented’ material and adopting a ‘purely documentary style’.9 Harland and Wolff was also drawn into the controversy and put pressure on both the Northern Ireland government and the BBC in Northern Ireland to cancel the programme. This matter was given added urgency by the fact that the programme was scheduled to be broadcast on the same day as the launch of the first Cunard-White Star liner to be built in Belfast since the war. As a result, the Northern Ireland Prime Minister, Sir Basil Brooke, telegrammed both the British Home Secretary and the Chairman of the BBC to request the programme’s cancellation. This led to a postponement of the programme’s transmission for a week and an assurance from the Home Office in London, which had also contacted the BBC, that the script was ‘quite harmless’.10 Despite the postponement, the Director of BBC Northern Ireland, George Marshall, remained keen for London to modify the programme. ‘[ I]n Northern Ireland, where a large number of relatives of the drowned are still alive’, Marshall wrote, ‘the “Titanic” disaster is still a very painful subject and we have always been careful to avoid any reference to it in our local programmes’. ‘Moreover’, he continued, ‘we have felt that a programme dealing with the “Titanic” disaster would undoubtedly damage the\n\nTitanic01\n\n26.10.03\n\n\n\n8:13 pm\n\nPage 18\n\nJohn Hill\n\nprestige of Messrs. Harland & Wolff, one of the main employers of labour in Northern Ireland, and jeopardise the BBC’s relationship with this firm’.11 The sensitivity of Harland and Wolff towards representations of the Titanic disaster continued into the s as William MacQuitty discovered when he sought the firm’s cooperation in the making of A Night to Remember (). The company’s chairman, Sir Frederick Rebbeck, who had previously sought to cancel the BBC’s ‘Sensation’ programme, now refused MacQuitty permission to film in the shipyards or make use of footage of the launch.12 Despite these obstacles, the film nevertheless constitutes an important milestone in the breaking of the silence towards the Titanic within the Northern Ireland public sphere. MacQuitty’s visits to Belfast during the preparations for the film were widely reported by the local press and, in the run-up to the film’s opening in Belfast, the Northern Whig serialised extracts from Walter Lord’s book of the same name (and the main source for the film). The premiere itself became something of a semi-official occasion and was attended by both the Governor of Northern Ireland, Lord Wakehurst, and the Lord Mayor of Belfast, Cecil McKee. The rekindling of civic pride in the ship that this represented was undoubtedly helped by the film’s Northern Irish credentials. For while the film may have been an expensive Rank production aimed at an international market, it was also something of a personal project for the film’s producer, MacQuitty, who was born in Belfast and had witnessed the ship’s launch as a child. As he recalls in his autobiography, this led to ‘a great lump’ in his throat and a feeling of ‘enormous pride in being an Ulsterman’.13 MacQuitty had begun his filmmaking career with an official production for the Northern Ireland government (Simple Silage) and he continued to enjoy cordial relations with senior politicians (providing, for example, the Unionist Prime Minister Sir Basil Brooke with a synopsis for a war effort film entitled ‘Ulster Goes To It’ in ).14 One of his first collaborators was the actor and singer, Richard Hayward, for whom he found a small part (as a victualler) in A Night to Remember. Hayward was himself a key figure in the development of filmmaking in Northern Ireland and had appeared in the first films to be shot there in the s. He too undertook official projects for the NI government and, for all his appreciation of Irish folk culture, was an enthusiastic advocate of the Unionist cause. Like MacQuitty, Hayward had witnessed the launch of the Titanic which he regarded as ‘a fabulous creation of Ulster brain and muscle’.15 Just as he had earlier sought to bring ‘Ulster’ to the screen, so he now felt ‘immense pride’ that a Belfast man should have had ‘the inspiration and courage’ to create ‘a Belfast picture, about a Belfast ship, created and fabricated by Belfast men’.16 Although Hayward’s claims were undoubtedly over-stated, the film does contain elements that support his view. Unlike its precursors, such as Titanic () which opens with passengers joining the ship at Cherbourg, the film\n\nTitanic01\n\n26.10.03\n\n8:13 pm\n\nPage 19\n\nThe Relaunching of Ulster Pride: The Titanic, Belfast and Film\n\n\n\nbegins with the launch of the ship at Belfast and shots of the shipyard workers. Although this is not footage of the actual launch, it does succeed in establishing the film’s links with Belfast (which is subsequently referred to on a number of occasions). It is worth noting too that despite the promotional claims concerning the film’s ‘accuracy’, the opening sequence also includes an entirely invented christening ceremony. In reality it was the policy of the White Star Line not to bless ships and this omission was later to enter popular mythology in Catholic Ireland as yet another factor contributing to the ship’s demise. While this piece of dramatic licence is commonly regarded as no more than a piece of scene-setting, it is also significant for the way in which it introduces Thomas Andrews (Michael Goodliffe) as a character of note. Andrews was both the managing director and chief designer at Harland and Wolff and was generally praised for the calm nobility of his actions once the Titanic had been struck. Despite this reputation, however, he does not appear in either of the earlier German or Hollywood versions of the disaster. In A Night to Remember, however, he becomes one of the film’s leading characters, shown providing advice to a variety of passengers and finally going down with the ship while sat at his desk. This emphasis upon Andrews extends well beyond the portrait of him contained in Walter Lord’s book and may partly be explained by the film’s ‘Ulster’ connections. For while Andrews symbolised the dignity with which many met their death, he was also a significant figure for Unionist Ulster, the ‘most important’, indeed, of the ‘rather important people’ from the North who lost their lives in the disaster (heading, for example, the list on Belfast’s memorial statue). Following the disaster, the Unionist writer Shan Bullock was commissioned to write a short biography of Andrews in which he is presented, according to the book’s preface, as a ‘plain, hard-working Ulster boy, growing into the exemplary and finally the heroic Ulster man that we know’.17 Unlike his uncle, Lord Pirrie, who had displayed nationalist sympathies, Andrews was a staunch Unionist and opponent of Home Rule (which he believed would be financially ruinous for Ireland). His elder brother, John Miller Andrews, was a Unionist politician, who became Prime Minister of Northern Ireland for a short period during the Second World War. At the time of A Night to Remember’s release, his nephew, John Lawson Andrews, had also become the local Minister of Health. The emphasis upon Andrews, and the sympathetic way in which he is portrayed, appears to have been a significant factor in helping to rehabilitate the memory of the Titanic in a way that was palatable to the Northern Ireland establishment. Thus, on the day of the film’s opening in Belfast, the local evening paper the Belfast Telegraph ran an article on Andrews by the Unionist MP for North Belfast Hugh Montgomery Hyde under the title of ‘Gallant shipbuilder who perished in the Titanic’.18 However, while the film did good business in Belfast and prompted a degree of local interest, this was not sustained. In , when\n\nTitanic01\n\n26.10.03\n\n\n\n8:13 pm\n\nPage 20\n\nJohn Hill\n\nthe Titanic memorial statue had to be moved due, ironically, to the number of motor accidents it had caused, there was barely a ripple of interest. Harland and Wolff also persevered with its policy of avoiding publicity and refused to help with the making of a television documentary in the s.19 By the time of Cameron’s Titanic, however, this had all changed. As elsewhere, the film assumed the status of a major cinematic event and encouraged a surge of cinema-going across Northern Ireland.20 The film, moreover, stirred immense interest in the ship’s Belfast connections and decisively ended local reticence concerning its origins. The Belfast Newsletter identified Belfast as the Titanic’s ‘spiritual home’ while the Belfast Telegraph described the ship as ‘the greatest . . . ever built’.21 This enthusiasm for the ship was accompanied by a concern to divest Belfast of the responsibility for its sinking. In the Belfast Telegraph it was argued that Harland and Wolff had little of which ‘to be ashamed’; the ship, it was claimed, was ‘the engineering triumph of that age’ which had fallen victim to ‘careless seamanship’ rather than flaws of design.22 Similar views were also in evidence in the local edition of the Sunday Times which ran an article under the headline, ‘Belfast told to stop feeling guilty and hold Titanic Day’.23 However, if the film helped encourage the rediscovery of local pride in the ship, it did so in a different way, and within a different context, from A Night to Remember. The film only mentions the city once and, although Andrews (Victor Garber) retains a key role (providing helpful advice and encouragement to the film’s leads), there is little sense (even in his accent) of his specifically Ulster origins. Cameron’s Titanic, in this regard, downplays the specific associations of the ship with Belfast and Northern Unionism in favour of a more generalised sense of ‘Irishness’. As previously noted, Irish passengers were among those in third-class or steerage. This was not, however, regarded as particularly significant in early film versions of the disaster. While Nazi cinema had exploited anti-English sentiment in two Irish-themed films, Der Fuchs von Glenarvon (The Fox of Glenarvon, ), and Mein Leben für Irland (My Life for Ireland, ), the German propaganda film Titanic () does not refer to the Irish on board the ship. In the Hollywood Titanic (), the Irish are also absent from the few scenes involving third-class passengers. A Night to Remember, therefore, was the first Titanic film to give prominence to the Irish aboard the ship, not only showing Irish villagers setting off for Queenstown but also maintaining an interest in their activities before and after the iceberg is hit. In Cameron’s film, this emphasis upon the Irish becomes even more pronounced. According to figures in Molony, the Irish accounted for less than a sixth of passengers in steerage ( out of ).24 In Cameron’s Titanic, however, it is the Irish characters who are by far the most visible and who are also central to the film’s elaboration of class and ethnic divisions. As McLoone argues, the Irish on board the ship, through the communal rituals of music, dancing and the drink-\n\nTitanic01\n\n26.10.03\n\n8:13 pm\n\nPage 21\n\nThe Relaunching of Ulster Pride: The Titanic, Belfast and Film\n\n\n\ning of ‘black beer’, provide the ‘cultural leadership’ of a new democratic and ethnically diverse America that stands in sharp contrast to the old order of WASP privilege (represented by the first-class passengers).25 In this respect, there is a significant departure from the treatment of the Irish in A Night to Remember. For while the earlier film also highlights the apparent proclivity of the Irish for singing and dancing, the portrait of the Irish characters is enveloped in more traditional images of Irish ‘backwardness’. In this respect, the scene of the Irish departing their village, under the benign eye of the local priest, contrasts with the opening sequence at the Belfast shipyards, suggesting a distinction between the rural ‘primitiveness’ of the South and the industrial ‘modernity’ of the North that was still being cultivated by Ulster Unionists during this period.26 What is also of note in the film is how the Titanic’s discourse of ‘Irishness’ extends to the ship’s manufacture as well. In A Night to Remember, there is a scene in a train involving Lightoller (Kenneth More) in which a rather pompous Englishman proclaims that ‘every Britisher is proud of the unsinkable Titanic’. This association of the ship with Britishness is, however, contested in Cameron’s film in which an Irish passenger, Tommy Ryan (Jason Barry), claims that the ship was actually built by the Irish. Such a reclaiming of the ‘Irishness’ of the Titanic is, nevertheless, problematic. As previously noted, the workforce that built the Titanic was overwhelmingly Protestant and Unionist and opposed to Irish Home Rule. The signifiers of ‘Irishness’ in the film (the music, the dancing), however, are clearly linked to a Catholic nationalist tradition and, as a result, make improbable markers of Northern Unionist culture. There is, then, something faintly absurd about Munich and Spiegel’s suggestion, following the lead of the film, that the ‘Irish wailing tones’ of the film’s theme song honours the ‘fifteen thousand Irishmen who built this ship’.27 From another perspective, however, the film’s amnesia concerning the ship’s origins may well have assisted the reception given to the film locally. What evidence there is suggests that the appeal of the film extended across the sectarian divide in Northern Ireland. In this respect, the film’s postmodern depthlessness helped to depoliticise the ship’s legacy and facilitate its exploitation within local heritage and tourist culture. Thus, while some doubts were expressed about the promotion of Titanic sites by Belfast City Council, there has been little resistance to the city’s continuing efforts to take advantage of its links with the ship. This led, in  (the ninetieth anniversary of the ship’s voyage), to the organisation of a Titanic week which now seems set to become an annual event. The Northern Ireland Tourist Board, which for many years had avoided reference to Belfast’s connections with the ship, also used the film’s success to encourage interest in the area. The ship was also seized upon as an emblem of Northern Irish enterprise and, as part of the city’s bid for economic regeneration, plans were announced for a -acre ‘Titanic Quarter’\n\nTitanic01\n\n26.10.03\n\n\n\n8:13 pm\n\nPage 22\n\nJohn Hill\n\nembracing a ‘science park, commercial premises, residential units, marina, social and leisure facilities, hotel(s) and a heritage museum’ on a site that included the dry dock in which the Titanic was built.28 There is, of course, a degree of irony in all of this. The Titanic, which was initially the emblem of a heavily industrialised north of Ireland, has now been mobilised in support of the construction of a new ‘post-industrial’ Northern Irish economy. This not only reflects the changing economic climate within Northern Ireland but also the change in political circumstances as well. For if the Titanic once suggested the economic and political strength of Ulster Unionism, such symbolism has largely lost its potency as a result of the declining fortunes of both Harland and Wolff and Unionism since the s. Although Northern Ireland shipbuilding may not have been the force it once was at the time of A Night to Remember’s release, Harland and Wolff was still one of the largest shipyards in the world. By the s, however, shipbuilding in Belfast was in a state of terminal crisis and the company was on the verge of closure. Far from resisting its association with the disaster, the shipyard was now eager to clutch at straws and obtain whatever commercial advantage it might secure from its historical legacy. Thus, in a striking reversal of previous attitudes, a local headline on Titanic’s Oscar nominations reported that ‘H&W hope for Titanic success’.29 The position of Ulster Unionism had also altered dramatically. At the time of A Night to Remember’s release, the Unionist government remained firmly in power (despite some advances by the Northern Ireland Labour Party). Following the outbreak of the ‘troubles’ in the late s, however, the Northern Ireland parliament, dominated by Ulster Unionists for fifty years, was thrown into crisis and eventually suspended by the British government in . Its return, under the Good Friday Agreement of , depended upon a power-sharing agreement whereby both nationalists and republicans would enter government. Under this new political dispensation, for all its ups and downs, it was clear that there could never be a return to single-party Unionist rule. The negotiations leading to this agreement were nearing conclusion at the time of the release of Cameron’s Titanic in Northern Ireland and represented a clear shift in the political dynamics of the region. Given the film’s appearance at this sensitive stage of the ‘peace process’, it was evident that the old associations which the ship carried would no longer hold sway in the same way as before. Thus, while it is unlikely that the ship will ever become a fully shared part of local Northern Irish culture, there is little doubt that the film contributed to the ending of local reticence regarding the ship’s origins and encouraged the proliferation of new local discourses (linked to the economy, heritage and tourism) around the film.\n\nTitanic01\n\n26.10.03\n\n8:13 pm\n\nPage 23\n\nThe Relaunching of Ulster Pride: The Titanic, Belfast and Film\n\n\n\nNotes 1\n\nI would like to thank Kelly Davidson for her help with the research for this article as well as John Wilson Foster, Michael McCaughan, Martin McLoone and Simon Mills for their assistance.

The most prominent is the memorial to the engineers who kept the generators running. The other memorial, less prominent, is to the ship’s musicians. Both have as their central emblem a female figure. The engineers’ monument is grandiose, measuring nineteen feet in height and thirty-two feet in length with a seven-foot figure of ‘Angel Glory’ holding a laurel wreath in each hand. The engineers are depicted at their posts in bronze bas-relief beneath the angel. The musicians’ monument is much smaller, measuring about four feet across and four feet high, and depicts in bas-relief ‘a [female] figure symbolising grief ’ carved from Sicilian marble.1 The figure is holding the back of the ship as if to attempt to keep it from sinking. Both monuments represent the public memory of the disaster and, in the style of memorial design prevalent at the time, they suspend the moment of tragedy. In their representations of the female figure, however, they suggest quite distinctive interpretations. The angel in the engineers’ monument offers absolution, arms spread out to encompass the lost in a heavenly embrace. The moment is eternal and the angel presides over it. By contrast the grief figure in the musicians’ monument hints at a kind of hysteria, a desire to break out of the moment, to stretch across the distance between home and shipwreck, and to wrest the ship, and the musicians, from their fate. The engineers’ monument elides such an earthbound and secular space in favour of a celestial haven with the undying memory of those who remain the only reference to the world of the living. In their references to time, space and gender, the memorials bear the traces of the origins of the local memory of the Titanic disaster. Those origins can be located in the reportage and the visual depictions of the suffering of Southampton during the week following the disaster, two examples of which I wish to explore in this chapter. Steven Biel begins his cultural history of the Titanic disaster by noting the importance of the role of technology in relaying a sense of ‘synchronicity’ to\n\nTitanic02\n\n26.10.03\n\n\n\n8:10 pm\n\nPage 26\n\nMichael Hammond\n\nthe event. He draws on Stephen Kern’s observation that the disaster ‘dramatized changing perceptions of time and space’.2 These perceptual shifts are associated with the advent of mechanisation, temporal regulation through timetables of trains, the regulation of work/leisure time brought about by mass industrialisation, and particularly with technologies such as the wireless telegraph. The wireless enabled the Titanic disaster to be experienced almost simultaneously across diverse realms from the news-reading public, and the terrible, helpless waiting of relatives and friends of those on the liner on two continents, to the victims of the disaster and their potential rescuers on the Carpathia. This simultaneity provides Biel with a metaphorical platform from which to launch his cultural study of the event’s impact and reception across the th century. The technologically induced simultaneity of the event highlights aesthetic continuities that were already apparent in tropes within theatre, cinema, visual and print culture at the time of the disaster. Film audiences of the day were becoming familiar with narrative codes that centred on the cinema’s ability to cross space and time in rapid succession. D. W. Griffith’s development of increasingly complex editing practices gave full rein to the powers of film to traverse not only external space and time, but also subjective, psychic, temporal and spatial registers.3 Theatre audiences were also familiar with the use of telephones and telegraphs as narrative devices. At one level of its retelling, the Titanic event does play itself out as a Griffithian rescue, for those who were saved. Or perhaps more darkly, in the fateful inaction of the Californian, as a failure in the combination of technology and human error, it resembles the emplotment of an Andre de Lorde sensation play. Further, the visual representation of thoughts and feelings within and across diverse temporal and spatial dimensions were central to the photo-postcard industry as well as theatrical stage mechanics and early cinema. Finally, the press reportage of the event at the time was the first re-telling of the sinking by virtue of two factors, the temporal gap between the event and its report on the wireless and then the process of story construction, inflected by varying degrees of hyperbolic suppositions, morally inflected rumours and stories that functioned to fill the gaps between the sporadic flow of confirmed information. Biel’s entire book effectively illustrates Titanic as an example of what Hayden White has called a ‘modernist event’.4 The Titanic’s circulating interpretations and retellings run a range of narrative possibilities from mythic tales of individual heroism to the tragic consequences of the irresponsibility of institutions. According to White, the modernist event is one ‘that can be neither closed and forgotten nor precisely remembered as merely an event of the past’.5 White points to the gap between the fact of an event and its meaning: ‘What is at issue here is not the facts regarding such events but the different possible meanings that such facts can be construed as bearing’.6 The catalysts\n\nTitanic02\n\n26.10.03\n\n8:10 pm\n\nPage 27\n\n‘My Poor Brave Men’ —Time, Space and Gender\n\n\n\nfor this phenomenon are the modern, technologically reproducible, forms of representation, which characterise the texture of experiencing events in the th century. Central to the modernist event, then, is its capacity, through media dissemination, for endless repetitions and re-tellings. This results in a cyclical, even hysterical, repetitiveness of narrative that ‘may provide a kind of “intellectual mastery” of the anxiety which memory of their occurrence may incite in an individual or a community . . . but insofar as the story is identifiable as a story, it can provide no lasting “psychic mastery” of such events’.7 For White psychic mastery requires the kind of anti-narrative strategies developed by literary modernism. Reflexive story telling offers ‘the possibility of representing such traumatic events as being produced by the monstrous growth and expansion of technological “modernity” (of which Nazism and the Holocaust are limit case manifestations) in a manner less fetishising than any traditional representation of them could ever be’.8 In that sense Biel’s adoption of a detached speaking position in his use of the stories of the sinking of the Titanic as stories works in part to unveil the ideological contradictions they suppress. In another discussion of the modernist event, Thomas Elsaesser suggests that the modernist aesthetic, one of ‘impersonality and understatement’ may not be wholly adequate in representing the dislocations and violences of modernity. ‘Emotions, one could argue, ought to belong to any engagement with matters of life and death on the part of both those whom history has given the role of spectators and those who are charged with passing on compassion and preserving memory’.9 Noting the mimetic and affective engagement strategies in the use made of technologies of reproduction (cinema and radio) by the Nazi regime in celebrating ‘folk’ cultures which in the process hid the ‘fanatic ruthlessness with which the regime repressed, destroyed and eradicated other cultures and crafts on an incalculable scale’, he points to German filmmaker Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s ‘black market melodramas’ and their use of melodramatic conventions to expose and relate the psychic consequences of these brutalities. Fassbinder’s strategy utilised a mimetic medium (film) in tandem with a mode of affective engagement (melodrama) to highlight ‘the dislocations caused . . . by capitalism’s modernisation as well as by the first society of the spectacle it gave rise to’.10 Melodrama’s potential in this regard has been theorised and documented to the extent that it stands as a central plank in academic understanding of literary, cinematic and theatre-based cultural production.11 For my purposes here I draw attention to these two strategies, modernist reflexivity and melodrama, in representing the unrepresentable to examine two contemporary manifestations of narration of the Titanic disaster, a local news report and a cartoon. I have a double purpose in invoking modernist and melodramatic registers here. The first is to underscore, and in the process adopt, a reflexive re-telling of an\n\nTitanic02\n\n26.10.03\n\n\n\n8:10 pm\n\nPage 28\n\nMichael Hammond\n\nearlier narration, to contribute to the kaleidoscopic history of the Titanic disaster. Secondly, in adopting that distance I wish to draw attention to the melodramatic mode at play in these retellings, not to unveil their ideological infrastructure, although that will be evident, but more precisely to mark the function of the melodramatic register in its own contribution to either thinly veiling or even exposing the inequities that were transparent to local residents directly affected by the disaster. My two objects of study here, a news report of the local populace of Southampton waiting for the news of the survivors outside the office of the White Star Line; and a cartoon, which features a woman representing grief, kneeling before a sea-wall with a thought bubble depicting the sinking, are both marked by their distinctive employment of temporality. The news reportage is clearly linear while the cartoon collapses time into an emotionally cyclical reverberation, between the envisioned moment of death and the resolution of grief, and offers a punctuating closure to the news story. My choice of these two items is prompted by the role Southampton played in the British national imagination soon after the disaster. A significant number of those lost on the Titanic were employed by the White Star Line and were drawn from a community that had grown up in the latter part of the th century around the shipping and liner industries. Local residents were employed in various functions on the ship, which represented the social and economic hierarchy that was representative of that of Southampton. Social and gender boundaries played a significant role in the news reportage as Southampton’s role in the national imagination gained prominence during the week following the sinking. Daily reports in the national press featured the story of the relatives waiting outside the offices of the White Star Line. On Tuesday, the day after news of the sinking had been received, the Southampton mayor, Henry Bowyer, set up a relief fund for widows and orphans of those who had perished. Soon after, the Lord Mayor of London, Sir Thomas Crosby, instigated a national relief fund. As early as  April the Southampton Daily Echo had reported that Bowyer, Crosby and Colonel Ivor Phillips, who represented a third fund being raised by the national newspaper The Daily Telegraph, had decided ‘that the sums received by the Mayor shall be appropriated to relieving immediate local distress, the balance of the three funds named being invested for the permanent benefit of the widows’.12 In general the press reports of the disaster during the first week identified Southampton as the centre of suffering relatives of perished Titanic crewmembers. The first reports of the disaster reached the press offices of the Southern Daily Echo, the local daily paper, in time to make the first edition on Monday. Each day until Saturday, there was a running side story concerning the queues outside the White Star Line offices. On  April, the Saturday weekly paper, The\n\nTitanic02\n\n26.10.03\n\n8:10 pm\n\nPage 29\n\n‘My Poor Brave Men’ —Time, Space and Gender\n\n\n\nHampshire Independent, reprinted a day-by-day account of the unbearable waiting and tension in a condensed version, along with the names of the crew who were lost under the heading ‘Nearly All Southamptonians’. The account begins with a quotation from ‘Dr. [Samuel] Johnson: ‘When any calamity has been suffered. The first thing to remember is, how much has been escaped’. This quotation at once places a closure on the event which, as the reader must have known, ushers the event into the realms of memory and also marks out the project of article, and the duty of the reader, to unveil or read into these events a purpose, or what Peter Brooks has called a ‘moral occult’.13 Behind these terrible events a divine hand enacts, and eventually reveals, the power of virtue. The equation of Titanic with Southampton continues as the article compares the size and variety of the crew ‘with that of a small town’. This attempt to imagine the disaster in terms of a geographic, land-based space seeks to give perspective to the loss and by implication that loss is measured by what is to follow; the impact of the disaster on the local community of Southampton. The article then structures the chronological events through its account of the waiting relatives. ‘We give full details…’ sets out the intent to mark out the significance of an event whose experience is characterised by temporal longuers inflected with the eventless occurrence of the ‘no names yet’ responses of the officials of the White Star Line. However, the retelling is already aware of its ending—a sense of foreboding permeates the sentence ‘Early in the morning there were rumours in Southampton that a mishap had occurred, but these were at first set aside as idle talk, but very soon there was a rude awakening, though the first news to hand was in no way the full measure of what really happened’. The balance between rumour and fact has its first articulation along a gendered axis that centres on the heroic sacrifice of the men and the objects of that sacrifice. ‘The women and children were reported to be taken off, and this proved to be fact . . . but all the earlier messages [of Titanic limping its way to Halifax or of all aboard rescued] proved to be false’. The ‘truth’ that women and children had been saved is counterbalanced by the dispelled rumour, which ensures the sacrifice. The ‘truth’ of the men’s sacrifice continues to inform the article’s construction of the objectivity of women and children, and, as the un-eventful time of waiting unfolds, it allows an equation of national mourning simultaneously with Southampton and the personification of the suffering of Southampton’s affected population with the feminine. As if to draw from the same lexicon of signs as the signification of female innocence and virtue in melodrama, the paper draws attention to the tradition of suffering from losses at sea; ‘Southampton, as has so often been the case with disasters at sea, is a great sufferer by this huge calamity’. The moral order played out along gender lines is confirmed; ‘There were hundreds of men in the ship who have wives and families in the port, and in the streets in\n\nTitanic02\n\n26.10.03\n\n\n\n8:10 pm\n\nPage 30\n\nMichael Hammond\n\nthe humbler parts of the town there is hardly a house which has not to mourn the loss of a breadwinner’. The loss of female employees on the Liner is completely suppressed by this rhetoric. Downplaying the role of women employed on the ship, the story maps the local geography of sorrow through reporting the impact of the disaster on the domestic, and therefore feminine, realm. It does so by listing the number of people lost and the number of affected households. This topography has since become entrenched in the local memory of the disaster—from the publication of photographs of the effected street of Southampton in The Deathless Story of the Titanic: Complete Narrative with many Illustrations by Lloyd’s Weekly News () to its most recent manifestation in the local reception of James Cameron’s Titanic ().14 Following its portentous opening, the news story then reports the events chronologically from Monday to Friday, the days immediately following the disaster. It begins with a flashback to the days leading to the departure of the ship, ‘under the bright sunshine the stately vessel moved down the river to the accompaniment of cheers and waving handkerchiefs from ship to shore’. The sinister presence of disaster is invoked by its apparent absence: ‘No hint of possible disaster, no premonition of mishap, marred a memorable send-off’. Under the heading ‘Reception of the News at Southampton’ the story of waiting begins: ‘Rarely if ever, in the history of the port have such scenes been witnessed as were seen outside the offices of The White Star Line on Canute Road on Monday’. A message that was put up reads ‘names will be posted as soon as received’. Continuing the masculinisation of the victims of the disaster the article refers to the ‘anxious crowd’, ‘grim and silent’ as ‘nearly entirely composed of men . . . Many of the crew have wives and large families, and almost everyone seemed to have a husband, father, brother, son or sweetheart on board the doomed vessel’. From a description of the scenes on Monday the account of Tuesday comes under the heading ‘Anxiety of the Relatives’. In the evening a cable from New York arrives and ‘the crowd pressed forward’. The cable provides information of five saved officers, but none of the crew. This event comes at the end of the account of Tuesday. On Wednesday the heading reads ‘More Pathetic Scenes’ but recounts a repetition of Tuesday’s events, the day being marked only by the erection of the notice board and an address by local councillor O’Dell advising them to go home and wait. ‘Thursday’s Agony’ is the title of the final section, which is divided into morning and afternoon. White Star Line officials announce that the names of the survivors will be posted as soon as they get them and the section and the article ends with the story of a preacher who tries to give a sermon but is met with ‘murmurs of dissent’. The end of the article is then followed by a full list of the crew of the Titanic who were ‘nearly all Southamptonians’. The article ends without closure, there is no news to be had, and a chron-\n\nTitanic02\n\n28.10.03\n\n8:05 pm\n\nPage 31\n\n‘My Poor Brave Men’ —Time, Space and Gender\n\n\n\nology of waiting is instead punctuated by stories. This psychic time, or timelessness, is expressed in melodramatic terms: ‘The infinite pathos of the catastrophe was borne down upon us hourly’. A contrast between light and dark punctuates the prose: ‘Another day of suspense dawned on Southampton on Thursday, and though the sun shone brightly from the genial April sky, the shadow of death and disaster hung over the port like a black thundercloud’. The function of the chronology also frames the binaries of public/private, work/domestic space in ways that articulate innocence in the face of loss. The time of day structures each visitor along gendered lines: ‘From time to time women with reluctant steps and backward glances detached themselves from the crowd, and went home to get tea for the children who were all too probably orphans’. This culminates in conjoining ideologically diverse spaces under the sign of communal grief: One o’clock—two o’clock—and still no news. The chimes of the clock of some distant church seemed to fall on the ears of the agonised listeners like a funeral knell. During the dinner hour when the dock gates disgorged their swarms of busy workmen, the waiting crowds swelled considerably, and after this, strangely enough, dwindled to small proportions. It seemed as if the sufferers were stunned, and had melted away to their homes, resigned to accept the worst. For a spell Canute Road was strangely quiet, and the shrill voices of the boys selling the papers with the latest news of the disaster, broke a tragic silence. No one spoke aloud near the fateful board. The looming shadow of death awed every body to a whisper. Little knots of men and women united in a community of sorrow still waited—still hoped.\n\nThis prose is arguably typical of the journalism of the day, a style that arose with the expansion in Victorian print culture, and mass readership, in the th century. A melodramatic language that in its literary reception was characterised as feminine fits with the rise of consumer culture, women readers as the assumed audience and consumption of newspapers in the domestic space.15 However, the attempt to fix the boundaries of gender and ideologies of class becomes occasionally unglued. This is apparent in the reference to ‘the several cases of . . . men who had previously been out of employment for some time, rendering the plight of those left behind even more desperate’. The reference here is to a coal strike that had been recently settled, but which had resulted in considerable unemployment among seamen based in Southampton. Many who had gained employment on the Titanic had done so because the vessels, on which they had normally been employed, were docked due to lack of coal. The understated reference may have meant to place blame on the striking coal workers for the deaths of the Titanic, while also drawing attention to the unstable nature of employment in the seafaring trade. Indeed, it became known later that the contracts of the White Star Line’s employees had been terminated at the time the ship went down. Resulting hardship was in part ameliorated by the Titanic Relief Fund, however, the attention given to the\n\nTitanic02\n\n26.10.03\n\n\n\n8:10 pm\n\nPage 32\n\nMichael Hammond\n\nemployment conditions of the seafarers remained one of the elements of pathos with which the Southampton story was inscribed at the time, and which has remained so within local memory. The article’s temporal structure concludes in an open ended, to-be-continued, fashion. The device of light and dark introduces the final paragraph: ‘Noon. The midday sun streams down on the waiting crowds that still linger around the fateful black board’. The waiting continues, although the creeping awareness of the fate of many is finally acknowledged, even if their identity is still in doubt: ‘The words that may be written on the boards during the coming hours will decide what wives will be widows, what children orphans, and what sweethearts forlorn’. The gender of the bereaved is clearly marked as female, in spite of the crowd being made up of as many men as women. But where women fainted and moaned, men ‘unable to bear the tension’ paced ‘aimlessly up and down the road always with a backward glance to see if anything fresh was being pinned up on the board’. The article leaves out Friday, the day when most of the names were ascertained. This is not intentional but by necessity of the deadline for the Saturday edition. This lacuna leaves exposed not the narrative or the closure but the affect; hence the introduction of time functions not as a marker of moments but as bearer of fate. Time signals the eventual pathetic conclusion and therefore leaves open the psychic, internal temporalities and introduces their cyclical nature, the capacity for retelling lies in this pathos and it is the narrative locus of the event in local memory. The second item I wish to explore is from the same newspaper, indeed following on the next page after the report discussed above—the weekly cartoon by Archibald Clements, the regular cartoonist for the Hampshire Independent. It depicts a woman kneeling at a sea wall, her head is in her hands and ‘Southampton’ is written across her dress. At her knees is a copy of the Daily Press and the headlines are discernible. They read: ‘Terrible Catastrophe— Sinking of ‘Titanic’—great loss of life. The column title on the right reads ‘Crew Nearly All Southampton Men’. Also at her feet lies a discarded officer’s hat. Above her head, superimposed over the sea is an image of the Titanic run aground on to the iceberg and the stern sinking into the water. The caption reads ‘My Poor Brave Men’. As in the news report of the waiting crowds, the emotional effect of the image centres on its gendered structure. The cartoon recalls a tradition of depicting women waiting for the return of their man’s ship"
