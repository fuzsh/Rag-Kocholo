        "text": "Compiled by Susan Eastman\n\nREVIEWS\n\n“American Made”: (adventure, R, 115 minutes, reviewed by Katie Walsh, Tribune News Service). This cocaine-smuggling adventure is a never-sits-still romp and a half, giving a breezy sunniness to the Iran-Contra Affair for Dummies. Tom Cruise is a morally elastic pilot, drug smuggler and informant in a based-on-reality film that has an undeniable shaggy-dog charm. **½\n\n\"Battle of the Sexes\": (sports biography, PG-13, 121 minutes, reviewed by Richard Roeper, Chicago Sun-Times). Instead of impersonating Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs, Emma Stone and Steve Carell create full-fledged, complex characters – flawed but endlessly fascinating. This finely tuned period piece about their 1973 tennis matchup works as a vibrant comedy, an effective character study and, yep, an inspirational sports movie. ***½\n\n\"Blade Runner 2019\": (sci-fi action, R, 164 minutes, reviewed by Roeper). The tight control of Ryan Gosling makes him the perfect choice to play a replicant cop that just might be human. This vibrant, gorgeous and occasionally incomprehensible hallucinatory epic stands with the likes of \"The Godfather Part II\" as a sequel worthy of the original classic. ****\n\n“Brad’s Status”: (drama, R, 101 minutes, reviewed by Walsh). Not attaining the status of his successful college friends obliterates all the good things in life from Brad’s (Ben Stiller) perspective. Mike White’s film explores this obsession and what’s really important as Brad takes his smart son on a college tour that becomes existential, spiritual journey. ** ½\n\n“The Foreigner” (action, R, 114 minutes, reviewed by Tim Miller, Cape Cod Times). Jackie Chan, as a man whose daughter is killed in a terrorist bombing, walks through this entire unfocused, downbeat action thriller with the same zombified, sad-sack expression. The IRA-related story of intrigue could have been much better if his character had been eliminated. **\n\n“Geostorm”: (disaster/action, PG-13, 109 minutes, reviewed by Rick Bentley, Tribune News Service). A series of satellites that can affect weather runs into a problem and its mastermind (Gerard Butler) has to be sent to space to fix it. A passable action film that uses weather as a weapon is burned under a tsunami of political muck. ** ½\n\n\"Goodbye Christopher Robin\": (biography, PG, 117 minutes, reviewed by Roeper). This film of rough edges and jagged twists tries to straddle the line between a whimsical origins story about the beloved Winnie the Pooh, and a harsh character study about the bear's creator, A.A. Milne (Domhnall Gleeson), and his wife (Margot Robbie), unlikable adults who are far better at exploiting a child than loving him. **\n\n“Happy Death Day”: (horror, PG-13, 93 minutes, reviewed by Rick Bentley, Tribune News Service). The story of a woman caught in an endless loop of her own death delivers the scares with more wit, wisdom and wonder than the typical horror movie. A sorority sister wakes up on her birthday and is killed, then keeps waking up and being killed in different ways, ultimately realizing she has to identify her killer – turning the film into a smart whodunit – before the repeats stop. ***\n\n“It”: (horror, R, 135 minutes, reviewed by Walsh). A wonderful group of teen actors play pubescent warriors who must face off against creepy killer clown Pennywise, a role that Bill Skarsgård totally nails. The movie, sometimes laugh-out-loud funny, ultimately works because of the characters, but there are too many special effects: The scares come fast, furious and digitally enhanced, when they could have been more effective paced out. ***\n\n“Kingsman: The Golden Circle”: (spy action, R, 141 minutes, reviewed by Walsh). This sequel ups the ante from the original cheeky riff on Bond-like gentleman spies vs. an entrepreneur villain and becomes a truly cynical, painfully retrograde pastiche of meaningless pop nostalgia. That’s wrapped around a nonsensical plot, sprinkled with a dusting of repulsive sexism. *\n\n“The Lego Ninjago Movie”: (animated, PG, 91 minutes, reviewed by Walsh). Inspired by 1970s kung fu and monster movies, and similar in fighting to “Power Rangers,” this sequel about a sensitive kid with daddy issues is a light, serviceable romp around the Legos. But it doesn’t come close to the high-key antics of the first two films, or their high joke density. **½\n\n\"Marshall\": (biography, PG-13, 118 minutes, reviewed by Roeper). As the young Thurgood Marshall, a brilliant and passionate civil rights attorney defending an accused rapist in 1940, Chadwick Boseman delivers perhaps his finest work to date — even when the material falters a bit and is more heavy-handed and pound-the-point-home than necessary. ***\n\n“The Mountain Between Us”: (survival romance, PG-13, 110 minutes, reviewed by Walsh). Strangers (Kate Winslet, Idris Elba) are bonded when they endure a harrowing ordeal after their charter plane crashes on a Utah mountain. The romantic fantasies, though, hijack this otherwise interesting unconventional love story. The performances are strong, but the film falls flat. **\n\n“My Little Pony: The Movie”: (animated, PG, 99 minutes, reviewed by Walsh). If part of the appeal of the My Little Pony renaissance is the nostalgic warm-fuzzies about childhood cartoons, then this 2-D animated film fully delivers. The story involves a fascist overload wanting to steal the ponies’ magic, with classic plot elements – parental figures in peril, a misfit group of pals, a hero’s journey. There are lots of songs to underscore the message and pad out the running time, but it still often drags. * ½\n\n“Only the Brave”: (adventure, PG-13, 133 minutes, reviewed by Walsh) The majesty of the images of firefighting in the wilderness is in service of a gripping story and the memorable people (led by Josh Brolin) in it. This is a true-life tale, based on a 2013 Arizona fire and the Granite Mountain hotshots crew, that will grasp onto your heart and hold on long after the credits roll. ****\n\n“Professor Marston and the Wonder Women” (historical drama, R, 108 minutes, reviewed by Walsh). This wonderfully sensitive and insightful superheroine origin story maps the psychology of Wonder Woman onto the life of creator Dr. William Moulton Marston, who leads an unconventional domestic and threesome sex life with two women (also psychological researchers) who together create the perfect woman. The film is beautiful and brilliantly made, and the script is aces, too. ****\n\n“The Snowman” (thriller, R, 119 minutes, reviewed by Walsh). There’s a star-studded cast, a blockbuster best-selling Scandinavian murder novel by Jo Nesbø, and three-time Oscar winning editor Thelma Schoonmaker, but this movies is a jumbled nonsensical mess. The film looks absolutely terrible and the screenplay makes very little sense. * 1/2\n\n“Suburbicon”: (satire, R, 104 minutes, reviewed by Walsh). Despite the award-winning talent behind (George Clooney) and in front of (Matt Damon, Julianne Moore) the camera, this 1950s satire, which inexplicably involves both a murder scam and racism, stinks. It is irritating, faux-edgy, tonally wack, strained, unfunny, and a colossally tone-deaf misfire. *\n\n“Thank You for Your Service” (drama, R, 108 minutes, reviewed by Walsh). Based on a book by a journalist embedded with soldiers in Iraq, this film explores the devastation of PTSD suffered by Americans returning home in 2007. Some parts are sensitive, moving and work well, but the storytelling is inconsistent. At its best, the film reveals a harrowing veteran experience when it focuses simply on the men themselves. ** ½\n\n“Victoria and Abdul” (historical drama, PG-13, 112 minutes, reviewed by Walsh). Judi Dench as Queen Victoria elevates the tale of a confined monarch who manages to reach out beyond the palace walls to a more regal level than the script alone would have done. While the acting is strong, the film stays at a superficial level, never fully examining the queen’s unique relationship with an Indian spiritual adviser and how it impacted the political, social and economic elements of the time. ***\n\n\"Wind River\": (western thriller, R, 111 minutes, reviewed by Roeper). An FBI investigator (Elizabeth Olsen) needs help from a wildlife agent (Jeremy Renner) to find a girl's killer in the snows of Wyoming. It's a stark and beautiful and haunting 21st-century thriller, filled with memorable visuals and poetic dialogue – and scenes of sudden, shocking, brutal violence. ****\n\nALSO SHOWING\n\nChatham Orpheum Theatre: 637 Main St.: \"Battle of the Sexes,\" \"Victoria and Abdul,\" \"The Paris Opera.\" Show times: 508-945-4900. www.chathamorpheum.org.\n\nCape Cinema: 35 Hope Lane, Dennis: \"Goodbye Christopher Robin,\" Friday through Thursday; \"Dracula (1931) with The Infra-Men,\" 9 p.m. Friday; www.capecinema.com.\n\nMartha's Vineyard Film Center: 79 Beach Road, Vineyard Haven: \"Brad's Status,\" 4 p.m. Friday, 7:30 p.m. Wednesday; \"Victoria and Abdul,\" 4 p.m. Saturday, 7:30 p.m. Sunday, 4 p.m. Wednesday; \"Columbus,\" 7:30 p.m. Friday, Saturday, 4 p.m. Sunday, Thursday; \"Walk With Me,\" 7:30 p.m. Thursday. www.mvfilmsociety.com.\n\nWater's Edge Cinema: 237 Commercial St., Provincetown: Friday through Thursday: \"Victoria & Abdul,\" 4:30 and 7 p.m. daily, 2 p.m. matinees Saturday and Sunday; \"It,\" 7:30 p.m. daily, 2:30 p.m. matinees Saturday and Sunday; \"Night of the Living Dead,\" 5:30 p.m. daily. 508-413-9369.\n\n“Containment of Nuclear Waste”: 7 p.m. Friday, Unitarian Church of Barnstable, 3330 Main St. Part of Cobbs Hill Community Series.
