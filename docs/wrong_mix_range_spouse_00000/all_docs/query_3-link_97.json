        "text": "I am not a fan of Tom Cruise. I used to like him in the Top Gun and the first Mission:Impossible era, but now his personal life and political/religious beliefs have loomed so large as to overshadow any character he might play. So whenever I see a preview of a movie starring Tom Cruise, I generally automatically dismiss it as unwatchable, no matter how interesting the rest of the story may be. However in this instance, I chose to watch this movie simply because I’m such a massive fan of Emily Blunt. Because she was starring, I felt the presence of Cruise would be an annoyance, but not an insurmountable one. Thus, I rented Edge of Tomorrow.\n\nIt wasn’t everything I thought it would be. It’s what you might get if you combined Groundhog Day with Starship Troopers. The script blatantly rips off the movie Mimic by calling the aliens Mimics, which I felt was a poor descriptive name for them. But then, the script had a lot of flaws. The beginning is very confusing, with Tom Cruise‘s character Cage waltzing about either impersonating a superior officer or actually being said superior officer. It’s never clear exactly who he is, but he winds up being shipped off to the front lines to die. No clue as to why. The attack on the aliens goes poorly and courtesy of being slimed by a special alien, Cage is doomed to repeat it over and over, constantly re-setting whenever he dies. Emily Blunt‘s character Rita observes him in action and discerns what is happening to him, as the same thing happened to her before. She fills him in on her experience, dropping the information bomb that the aliens can control time and thus always know what’s going to happen in advance. She never reported this to anyone else is because A) they’d think she was crazy and lock her up, or B) believe her and dissect her. Fair enough, I wouldn’t want to be dissected either. Rita begins training Cage (cue the montage) and together they set out to find and kill the ‘Omega’ alien that is responsible for time loop.\n\nThe opening sequence of the film makes you think somebody in the projector room must have accidentally done something to really mess things up, as the image skips all over the place with lots of static. The end of the film had a kind of Prince of Persia twist to it, but as a whole I felt it was lacking substance. Groundhog Day was a story of personal discovery and romance, but Edge of Tomorrow has no time for things like character development and instead relies heavily on CGI, special effects and action sequences. If that’s all that interests you, but you’ll probably love the movie, but after numerous iterations of the tagline Live, Die, Repeat, I grew quite bored with the proceedings. Every time things reset, you get to hear a rather pompous Master Sergeant expounding on the virtues of combat in a speech you come to absolutely despise. There’s a smattering of decent lines and the plot is as least nominally interesting, but in general I was disappointed. It’s not terrible, but not good enough to earn it more than an apathetic two stars. – BETHANY\n\nFor more on this curiously titled film, visit the Internet Movie Database\n\nEmily Blunt‘s Rita has literally become the poster child for the war effort. She also has the unfortunate and rather offensive nickname ‘Full Metal Bitch’. I do at least appreciate the nod to World War II era propaganda.\n\nMeet a Mimic. What they’re mimicking is unclear, but I’ve gotta say I’m getting really sick of movies that feel like video games. This is even a first person shooter shot!\n\nGet ready for lots and lots of scenes like this.\n\nReally. a lot of them.\n\nAnd now for something completely the same …\n\nMaster Sergeant Farrell (Bill Paxton): “Battle is the Great Redeemer. It is the fiery crucible in which true heroes are forged. The one place where all men truly share the same rank, regardless of what kind of parasitic scum they were going in.”\n\nFighting to get off a beach in France – hey, this sounds a lot like Saving Private Ryan.\n\nRita does yoga. (Emily Blunt).\n\nShe does it very well.\n\nLook out, it’s an irradiated octopus!\n\nCage shucking his fancy battle suit. At least they’re no longer on the beach.\n\nBy his own admission, Master Sergeant Farrell is not an American, he’s from Kentucky. This is pretty weak as jokes go, and a sad commentary on the American educational system. Evidently Farrell flunked Geography.\n\nThis guy is definitely toast. Repeatedly. (Tony Way)\n\n‘Let’s have coffee’. “And then I’m killing you.” “Fine.”\n\nWhy is it always tachyons?\n\nPhotos courtesy of Warner Bros.

It was never meant to die here.’ Overpopulation and a ferocious blight attacking crops is driving humanity ever closer to extinction. Matthew McConaughey plays Cooper, a farmer like everyone else, but also an ex-NASA pilot and engineer. Their world now resembles the 1930’s Depression era dust bowl, with drab clothing and utilitarian farmhouses. While society regresses technologically, there are a few who realize the salvation of mankind isn’t on Earth but out in the stars. Once again, it’s the ‘NASA saves the day’ cliché, but since I wholeheartedly support the space program, I don’t mind one bit. Interstellar is a rather magnificent combination of incredible cinematography and a lot of cool real scientific stuff, and a story of family and what makes us human. Like 2001: A Space Odyssey, with which there are a lot of parallels, you will most likely love it or hate it. I’m one of the few who fell right in the middle, able to appreciate all the good qualities in director Christopher Nolan‘s work, but still conscious of the stretches in logic and other faults.\n\nInterstellar has undeniably spectacular visual effects, but it is exceedingly long. With a run time of almost three hours, I did find myself checking the clock quite a bit. It’s highly appropriate that the space vessel is called The Endurance, because it’s a trait you will need to get through the overly long and dare I say it, bloated film. The most I can tell you about the plot is it involves a space mission to find other habitable worlds in order to save the human race. Pretty much anything else is a spoiler. Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, a walking Rubix cube wise-cracking robot and a few red shirt extras, including Seneca Crane from The Hunger Games (Wes Bentley, unfortunately minus the crazy beard), set out via a convenient wormhole on a quest designed to assault you with dumbed down but valid science, and copious quantities of stunning visual effects. The whole movie is a paradox with most everything eventually tied up in a neat bow, so be prepared for a lot of mind bending stuff as well as some rather ridiculous plot devices (the solution to everything is “solving gravity”? And what was up with that bit resembling that Doctor Who episode The Girl in the Fireplace?)\n\nDespite the annoying absurdities, there are quite a few marvelous things about Interstellar that I must acknowledge. The cast is beyond impressive with the aforementioned stars as well as Michael Caine, Jessica Chastain, Matt Damon, Ellen Burstyn, John Lithgow, Casey Affleck and Topher Grace. The soundtrack is wicked, with a nice use of pipe organ and I especially liked the subtle tick-tock motif used on the water planet to illustrate the urgency of time passing. I might actually forgive composer Hans Zimmer for the Gladiator incident, wherein he failed to give credit to Gustav Holst after blatantly ripping off Mars: The Bringer of War from the collection The Planets. With highly charged emotional content, many tangents regarding high-minded philosophy, quantum science, metaphysics and other conundrums, my personal favorite was a fascinating discussion about the nature of love. You won’t believe the number of plot twists and while the ending might not be the most satisfying, it certainly fits with the outré thematic comportment of the film as a whole. Undeniably idiosyncratic thematically with a lot of just plain weird stuff, but also including deeply personal character studies and some shrewd commentary on a number of subjects, including being good stewards of the Earth. Interstellar doesn’t quite live up to the hype, but definitely has enough going for it to merit a solid three stars. – BETHANY\n\nFor more on this slightly bizarre space drama, visit the Internet Movie Database\n\nMovie features lots of cool images like this one.\n\n“We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars. Now we just look down, and worry about our place in the dirt.” – Cooper\n\n“We’ve always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible. And we count these moments. These moments when we dare to aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the unknown known. We count these moments as our proudest achievements. But we lost all that. Or perhaps we’ve just forgotten that we are still pioneers. And we’ve barely begun. And that our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us, because our destiny lies above us.” – Cooper\n\nIt’s all about Cooper’s relationship with daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy). Evidently he couldn’t care two pins about his son Tom. (Timothée Chalamet and Casey Affleck, thanks to the dime differential.) “After you kids came along, your mom, she said something to me I never quite understood. She said, “Now, we’re just here to be memories for our kids.” I think now I understand what she meant. Once you’re a parent, you’re the ghost of your children’s future.”\n\nAs a book lover, it’s deeply satisfying to have a book shelf play such a lynch pin role in the movie.\n\n“When I was a kid, it seemed like they made something new every day. Some, gadget or idea, like every day was Christmas. But six billion people, just imagine that. And every last one of them trying to have it all. This world isn’t so bad.

This is dire, with absolutely no redeeming features, a mash-up of Cinderella, Rapunzel, Jack & the Beanstalk and Little Red Riding Hood, and is also, for some reason, a musical. I’m shocked that so many big Hollywood names got dragged into it. Now I don’t have anything against musicals in general, but I do like the songs to either move the story forward in some way, be clever, witty or at the very least, funny. Regrettably, these are boring, dissonant, completely stop the action (one of Cinderella’s inane songs actually stops time and you’ll feel the same while you wait for this to be over) and worse, don’t even have the nerve to get stuck in your head. They seem pointless except to show off how well the lyricist can rhyme and if you ask me, that’s a terrible reason for a musical. Outside of a specific song, is there any point to having characters sing their lines instead of speaking them like a normal person other than to annoy the audience?\n\nWith a run time of over two hours, it’s a huge overly bloated “story” that seems to exist for no other purpose than to show how you could theoretically attach all of the fairy tales to one another. If that had resulted in something even remotely interesting, I would have been OK with it, but all it did was make a big mess and ruin the Happily Ever Afters. Chris Pine even added insult to injury by infusing his performance as Prince Charming with his best William Shatner impression – maybe it was a delayed reaction to playing Captain Kirk. Because there were so many stories trying to be told, there is practically no character development and as a result, you care very little what happens to any of them. Anna Kendrick plays a Cinderella inspired by some of the older versions of the fairy tale, which could have been great but instead but comes across as a wishy-washy twit who keeps inexplicably running away from the Prince. Granted, the William Shatner Prince Charming would make me run away too, but that isn’t the point. Emily Blunt and James Corden play a village baker and his wife who make a deal with Meryl Streep‘s witch in order to have a child. Little Red Riding Hood is a petty thief and Johnny Depp flashes by as a bizarre wolf/human hybrid. Rapunzel (Mackenzie Mauzy) is a daft nitwit who lets down her hair for absolutely anyone and bratty Jack commits ecological terrorism, grand larceny and murder but is still somehow a hero (Sir Terry Pratchett would approve!). Christine Baranski was a brilliant casting choice for Cinderella’s evil stepmother and this is the fourth time Lucy Punch has played a stepsister (type cast much?). But both were gypped by too small roles and thus their comedic genius was utterly wasted.\n\nThis movie will make you want to shoot the very next person who sings the line ‘into the woods’, makes Prince Charming a philandering jerk, has a peculiar affinity for killing characters in abrupt ways and gives the impression that despite the Woods being purportedly enormous and dangerous, they are absolutely crawling with people who keep conveniently running into one another. There was an extreme deficiency of logic that I found infuriating and absolutely no satisfying conclusion to any of the story lines. I suffered through the entire thing thinking surely there must be some point to all of it, but alas, there was not. To quote my fabulous Aunt Denice, it was ‘absolutely ghawstly‘! Not even Frances de la Tour as the giantess or Tracey Ullman as Jack’s mother could save this atrocious time-sucking musical disaster. I can’t believe I’m going to say this, but Russell Crowe’s performance in Les Misérables looks like it should have won an Oscar in comparison to this stinker. Be careful what you wish for, sure, but also be careful what movie you watch and avoid this at all costs! – BETHANY\n\nFor more on this mess of a musical, consult the Internet Movie Database.\n\nThe whole kit and caboodle of them.

Nowhere near as salacious or erotic as it was made out to be, I am very glad I didn’t waste my money on a theater ticket. The books are excellent, but most of the charm of them is because of Ana’s thoughts and emotions. She’s an unreliable narrator, as her naïveté and personality color everything and the reader spends a great deal of time in her head. None of that is able to be translated into film, unless the whole movie was done in voice-overs. So take the book, subtract all the interesting psychological drama and internal thoughts, including the amusing subconscious and inner goddess, and then try to make a movie with what is left. The result is like the difference between a skeleton and a living, breathing creature. The bare bones of the story are there, the key plot points are accounted for, but there is a disappointing lack of soul.\n\nJamie Dornan is undeniably hot, but he’s not at all how I pictured Christian Grey. I think the women of the world all fell a little bit in love with him as the Huntsman on Once Upon A Time, and he’s a very fine actor. I just didn’t think the role suited him. Dakota Johnson was closer to the mark as Anastasia Steele, but there was little if any chemistry between the two leads. The book describes the attraction between Christian and Ana as charged and magnetic, but none of that made it into the movie. To be fair, not all of it was a let-down. The sets are fabulous, wardrobes are amazing, the ambiance is pitch perfect and some of the casting choices were inspired. Marcia Gay Harden as Dr. Grace Trevelyan-Grey was terrific, although she got precious little screen time, and Jennifer Ehle as Ana’s mother Carla was great.\n\nMy impression of the books is ultimately a story of love and redemption, how Christian and Ana change, influence and help each other for the better. Plus a lot of kinky sex. The latter is well represented in the movie, but sadly the characters I loved from the books are mere shadows of themselves. Rarely have I seen a movie based on a book do justice to the source material and this is no exception. It’s all right, but doesn’t hold a candle to the book.

Castaway was excellent and I hoped this one would be as good. Unfortunately I found it overly long and frankly boring. A little bit of narration or inner monologue would have helped a great deal because a lot of what went on made no sense to me. Anything to give Redford’s character a bit of context would have been an improvement. He’s so static he doesn’t even have a name, making it difficult for the audience to care about him. He also appears to be the most inept sailor on the planet and it seems almost Darwinian that he should be removed from the gene pool. I like Robert Redford as an actor, especially in The Sting, but after an hour of watching him bumble about doing one stupid thing after another, I started questioning my own opinion. I probably shouldn’t judge Redford too harshly as the poor guy had practically nothing to work with, script wise. At least Tom Hanks got to talk to a volleyball! There is supposedly an allegorical quality to the story, and the ambiguous ending might support that theory, but allegories shouldn’t be so dull they put the audience to sleep. I usually like minimalist understated movies but I just couldn’t connect with this one. My attention kept drifting (pardon the pun) and I was unable to suspend my awareness of time passing. I’m sure this film has much to recommend it but it just wasn’t for me. – BETHANY\n\nThis is the most excitement in the whole movie and it only lasts a few minutes.\n\nIf you remove the ‘ALL’ from this, you’d have it just about right.\n\nPhotos courtesy of Before the Door Pictures, Washington Square Films, Lionsgate and FilmNation Entertainment\n\nBefore I get to my review, it should it noted that I’ve had to re-post this on Netflix multiple times. Evidently, people take offense at my comments and check the box marked ‘inappropriate or objectionable content’, then Netflix pulls the review from the site. I find this exceedingly ironic, as the content in the movie itself is far beyond inappropriate and objectionable. I figure people get irritated at my honesty and feel I need to “lighten up”. But I have just as much of a right to voice my opinion as anyone else, which is why I think Netflix needs to actually read reviews before automatically removing them to make sure there really is objectionable content and not that someone just disagreed with what was said. OK, I’ll get down off my soapbox now.\n\nTo say this movie is raunchy in no way conveys the depths of depravity commonplace throughout this film. This utterly disgusting and cringe-inducing movie is what you get when Hollywood tries to make fun of itself, which accounts for the incredible cast of Tinseltown’s best. If you’re wondering why so many great actors signed on for this piece of, er, manure, my theory is that they got one or two big names first (possibly by means of blackmail or calling in huge favors), then the rest snowballed. I can just hear their thoughts after reading the script, trying to politely decline and then being told that So-and-So and What’s-His-Name had agreed to participate. “Well, if they’ve all signed, I don’t want to be the only one who said no …”. This is funny in a horrifying watch-from-behind-your-hands kind of way, but it is important to know it isn’t going to just push the envelope, it’s going to bulldoze it clear over to the neighboring galaxy. I think the first sketch featuring Kate Winslet and Hugh Jackman was my favorite, as it was only mildly gross and I only gagged once (as did Kate). The rest descend into a pubescent scatological festival of nastiness that breaks pretty much every taboo and social more in modern culture. There are no words for some of the things this movie does, but depraved, loathsome, abhorrent, prurient and revoltingly nauseating come close. It wallows in obscenity, rejoices in being offensive and celebrates pandering to the lowest common denominator. If that sounds appealing to you, then by all means, watch this. I gave it at least one star because I can appreciate some of the ludicrous humor and the performances really are good, so I didn’t absolutely hate it. But it’s definitely an approach-with-extreme-caution type of movie and I cannot give it a strong recommendation. – BETHANY\n\nFor more on the extensive cast of this, uh, thing, visit the Internet Movie Database\n\nFor the pictures below, I’m not going to bother giving you the characters’ names because frankly, who cares?\n\nKate Winslet on a blind date with a seemingly perfect guy.

Every single time.” The idea that the government knows best is not a new one, a.k.a. The Nanny State. This one’s bright idea of “fixing” humanity was to create a super-regimented, highly regulated, advanced technological and micro-managed community, devoid of diversity, color (a nifty trick!), emotion and things like adventure and genuine pleasure. Sameness becomes the goal but equality, taken to such extremes, becomes a great evil rather than a virtue. This might be the ultimate example of throwing out the baby with the bathwater in that by ridding people of the bad, they also strip them of the things that make life worth living. You know it’s bad when someone says something like “The Elders are never wrong.” Dum-duh-dum-dum! Brenton Thwaites stars as Jonas, who is chosen (in a ceremony a LOT like the ones in Harry Potter, Divergent and The Hunger Games) to become apprentice to The Receiver of Memory (Jeff Bridges). It is his lot to retain memories of the world as it was before. They can never be shared with anyone else except an apprentice, but he does offer advice based on his broader knowledge to the leaders of The Community. Since Jonas is to be the Receiver of Memory, the two of them decide to call the previous one “the Giver”. Taylor Swift plays the part of a previous apprentice, Rosemary, who mysteriously didn’t work out and subsequently disappeared. The trouble really begins when Jonas starts illicitly sharing what he’s learned with his friend Fiona (Odeya Rush), and generally starting to behave contrary to the rules of The Community.\n\nWhile I appreciate a lot about this movie, I’ve got to wonder if there’s an assembly line somewhere churning out scripts about future dystopian societies where one or two characters just don’t quite fit in, i.e. the Hunger Games, Divergent, The Maze Runner, The Island, etc., although this one puts a creepy Pleasantville spin on the theme. There are some great sequences illustrating the joys as well as the horrors of life, and it’s always a pleasure to see Alexander Skarsgård (Eric Northman!! from True Blood). But while I have a feeling the book is probably more interesting and quite profound, the movie left much to be desired. The prologue says there are no losers or winners, but one of the first lines is “I win,” regarding the competitive sport of baby weighing. “Some people have it, some people don’t.” Right from the beginning, the script violates its own basic tenet, with a character crying “That’s just not fair!”. I liked the subtle use of color shading throughout, but unfortunately an emotionless society makes for a boring movie. With no real resolution other than a nice montage encapsulating the full human experience, it was too oversimplified for my taste. I hear there are several other books by the same author set in this world, but if any of them get made into movies I can’t say I’m looking forward to it. – BETHANY\n\nFor more on this movie, visit the Internet Movie Database\n\nThis apple turns red just like the one in Pleasantville – poor Eve, she’ll never live it down …\n\nThe Community – anywhere else is known somewhat vapidly as “Elsewhere”.\n\nA ceremony in The Community.

Also, if you object to lots of particularly colorful language and blood splattering everywhere, you might want to look elsewhere for entertainment. The story itself is unfortunately believable, as it explores the dreadful things people will do for the sake of money or when they are pushed beyond the limits of their endurance. It’s a sad, but accurate commentary on humanity and the scene with the wood chipper will no doubt make frequent appearances in my nightmares. I’ve often wondered if being a cop necessarily gives a person a certain cynicism, but the character of the sheriff was quite refreshing. She just kept at it, unraveling things bit by bit and following the evidence wherever it led.\n\nI must admit, I was hooked with the dramatic opener, which read ‘This is a true story. The events depicted in this film took place in Minnesota in 1987. At the request of the survivors, the names have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occurred.’ However, I have since found out this is a flat out lie and felt annoyed at the filmmakers for being so deliberately dishonest and frankly disrespectful to other films that really are based on real events. Was it a good story? Yes, it was full of dark humor, lots of unexpected twists and turns and the characterizations were fascinating. I really never knew what was going to happen next, but in the end I felt vaguely unsatisfied, as though something was missing. Perhaps the reason for that is that reality doesn’t usually tie up every loose end in a neat bow with explanations for everything. The movie instead winds up being thought provoking and stays with you longer than if the ending had been more pat. I’m glad I watched it, as it allowed me to better appreciate the new TV show of the same name (which is excellent!), although I’m still grateful I do not live in Minnesota. – BETHANY\n\nFor more on this classic movie, visit the Internet Movie Database\n\nWell, doesn’t this look inviting.\n\nCarl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare), some very shady characters, and not just because you can hardly see them in this bar.\n\nPolice Chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand).

(Image found at mnprairieroots.com)\n\nPhotos courtesy of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, Working Title Films and MGM (unless otherwise noted)\n\nI was fully prepared to like this show, as I like the idea of parlaying the embarrassment of childhood into entertainment, not to mention I too grew up in Orlando, Florida. I thought it would be nice to see a show that didn’t feel the need to be politically correct but rather use stereotypes and conventions to achieve a unique flavor of humor. Unfortunately, although this does feature the inevitable culture clash of a Taiwanese family ruthlessly pursuing their idea of the American Dream, it’s far more likely to cause merely a modest titter here and there rather than a genuine belly laugh. I think perhaps it’s trying too hard, with all the “humor” defined in terms of racial epithets and sweeping generalizations, with the result being relentlessly negative. The mother is a bit of a shrew and killjoy, proud when her son turns out to be lactose intolerant because as she says, it means his body is rejecting white culture. The oldest boy tells her, “All you care about is money.”\n\nThe browbeaten father fares no better. How sad when a dad tells his son he loves him and these are the kid’s thoughts on the event. “We loved each other. We just didn’t say it. We showed our love through criticism and micromanagement. So if you said “love you”, you were probably hiding something.” The entire effect of the show is very wearing, with monotonously overt racism evidently meant to be funny but failing miserably. Such a concept is possible, as evidenced by the show Sullivan & Son (which I have also reviewed on this site), but the difference is at Sullivan’s bar, absolutely everyone is skewered, which equalizes the issue and is, for lack of a better word, fair in dishing out stereotype-based humor. Instead of the irreverent comedy this show promised to be, it’s fatiguing to watch and life is too short to waste time with TV shows that feel more like a chore than entertainment. The world needs less of a focus on race, not more. – BETHANY\n\nFor more on this disappointing show, visit the Internet Movie Database\n\nConstance Wu as mother Jessica Huang.\n\nThe décor in this restaurant is beyond atrocious!\n\nPhotos courtesy of Fierce Baby Productions, The Detective Agency, 20th Century Fox Television and ABC\n\nI guess there is a simple truth exemplified by this movie: Hollywood is totally incapable of creating a movie that accurately depicts its source material. I’ll be the first to acknowledge the picture of a totally benevolent Noah standing beatifically at the entrance of the ark as animals come two by two is probably not quite how it went down. As a Christian but also someone capable of rational thought and logic, the real story is probably a lot more complicated than what eventually got written down. The book of Genesis, if we’re being honest, is a little vague and sometimes self-contradictory, which leaves the door open to a lot of interpretation. The few passages describing the antediluvian world are very strange, full of references to things since lost to history and again, open to speculation and extrapolation. Therefore I can tolerate The Watchers and the idea that Cain’s descendants built a rather advanced civilization. But while the broad strokes of the Biblical story are present in this movie, there are quite a few things that directly contradict what is specifically stated in the Bible. There are a lot of overtones that seem to be transplanted directly from the story of Abraham and Isaac as well as deliberately choosing to gross out modern audiences with several presumptive cases of incest, in flagrant disregard of the Genesis account. I’ve got no problem with Noah perhaps not being the nicest guy and struggling to understand what God really wanted him to do. Go right ahead and fill out the story in any way you might imagine it, but don’t mangle the few pieces of it that do survive just for the sake of being dramatic. I think the biggest mistake this movie made was not portraying God as an active character. The Prince of Egypt was so much better in that respect. There are things to appreciate about this movie, such as the acting performances and special effects, but not enough to earn it more than a disappointing single star. – BETHANY\n\nFor more on this fiasco of Biblical proportions, visit the Internet Movie Database\n\nThe Classic Image of Noah (courtesy of gnosticteachings.org)\n\nAronofsky’s Noah (Russell Crowe).\n\nMethuselah in the Noah story?
