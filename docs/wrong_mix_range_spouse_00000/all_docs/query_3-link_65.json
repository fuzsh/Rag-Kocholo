        "text": "Bonnie Hammer\n\n\"E! is a guilty pleasure … and not necessarily one people like to admit they watch.\"\n\nThat was the hard-to-hear feedback newly appointed NBCUniversal cable entertainment chairman Bonnie Hammer received this summer when she commissioned a brand study among consumers on the latest addition to her portfolio, the E! network.\n\nPHOTOS: THR's 2011 Women in Entertainment Power 100\n\nWhat will come next is a brand makeover, which will see the E! logo as well as the programming tone and philosophy change to reflect what Hammer hopes will be a smarter and more aspirational destination. To hear her tell it, the network best known for Kardashian fare and Ryan Seacrest's staggering paycheck has the potential to be as popular and profitable as USA became under her watch. (E! currently garners 22 cents per subscriber a month, compared to USA's 60 cents, according to SNL Kagan.)\n\n\"E! needs to be and really wants to be the pulse of popular culture,\" the trim and immaculately dressed Hammer says of a network she claims has grown too Hollywood-centric to be relevant to a broader audience. The next several months with her recently reconfigured team, including a new hire to move the network into scripted programming, will redefine what the network stands for. \"We'll eventually get rid of the more Playboy trashy element, and elevate E! to a fun, exciting and aspirational network,\" she explains with her hallmark intensity, noting that a recent promo for Kourtney & Kim Take New York, which features the stars in a helicopter and black-tie attire, is evidence — albeit just a slice — of the coming class.\n\nOf course, changing the perception of E! in an era when the Kardashians' reality genre is often considered the scourge of society (by critics mostly, mind you) sounds like an impossible mission. But Hammer is cable TV's miracle worker, an executive who transformed once-dowdy USA and too-narrow Syfy into top?5 cable networks and presided over the prized possessions Comcast coveted in its $13.8 billion deal for NBCUniversal. These days, USA, which is coming off the most watched quarter in cable history, even out-rates broadcast sibling NBC on occasion. It's no wonder she earned a top position in the post-merger reorganization and a coveted spot at No. 2 on this magazine's list (tied with Sony's Amy Pascal). Hammer's portfolio, which includes G4, Chiller, Sleuth, Universal HD and Universal Cable Productions, is poised to deliver an estimated $2 billion in profit this year, and remains the biggest contributor to NBCUniversal's bottom line.\n\n\"She's one hell of a businesswoman. She has built the most powerful cable operation in the history of television. It's not by accident,\" says Law & Order creator Dick Wolf, whose Criminal Intent spinoff aired on USA.\n\nKnown as a skilled — but never sleazy — corporate player, the well-liked Hammer can be both a detail-oriented manager (she'll still weigh in on color choices on USA ads) and a big-picture thinker. USA co-president Chris McCumber marvels at the collaborative work environment she's able to foster. \"She has the best gut in the business,\" he says of a woman he considers both boss and mentor. Says NBCUniversal CEO Steve Burke, \"It's rare to find an executive who has both strong leadership and creative talents, but that is exactly what you get with Bonnie. She has built a terrific team and the success of her portfolio speaks for itself.\"\n\n*****\n\nThe fallout from Kim Kardashian's 72-day marriage to NBA player Kris Humphries is still the dominating theme at the newsstand and on the web when Hammer sits down to lunch at Rockefeller Center's The Sea Grill on a crisp Manhattan day in late November. In recent weeks, reporters from The New York Times to People magazine have questioned the validity of the union, which commenced with a multi-million-dollar wedding showcased in a two-hour special on E! in October.\n\nBut if Hammer, 61, fears her network's most valuable franchise is in danger of unraveling, she isn't letting on. \"This was not a stunt. In no way did people believe that this was going to happen,\" she says definitively, before adding: \"I think true Kardashian fans know that a bigger than life mistake can be made easily in their world. Everything they do is bigger than life … it's just part of their DNA.\" (The latest season opener of Kourtney & Kim Take New York, featuring a then-married Kardashian and Humphries drew the franchise's largest premiere viewership to date.)\n\nStill, Hammer is adamant that going forward the network not be as dependent on the Kardashians as it has been. Despite being a \"beautiful\" and \"interesting\" family, she believes the current strategy of living with only one or two franchises is \"too fragile,\" and has ambitions of adding several more over the next couple of years.\n\nNot that Hammer is interested in abandoning the kash kow family just yet. \"I think it will have its own life expectancy,\" she says of the lucrative brand that the family has built on and off screen, \"and we'll just go along with it and help hone what's right for E! and what's not right for E! as we develop a whole other world.\" Falling among the former are mom Kris Jenner's two youngest daughters — technically Jenners — and what Hammer says she hopes are \"two, three, even four new Kardashian [spinoffs].\"\n\nSuzanne Kolb, promoted to E! entertainment president in July, continues to be struck by how clear and focused Hammer is on what she believes can happen and her willingness to let the team make sure it does. \"She's a great mix of inspiration and empowerment for those who work for her,\" Kolb says of her new boss, with whom she communicates daily. \"She's a master at directing people and redirecting people. She's really good at saying, 'a little to the left,' and navigating a very large ship.\"\n\nIn addition to the entry of scripted programming — which Hammer seems confident will help elevate the brand — she has plans to reevaluate the network's daily news program and grow its stable of hosting talent. At September's Emmy Awards, Hammer opted to monitor the red carpet coverage operation from an E! News van rather than walk the carpet in a gown herself. \"The most important thing for E! to move forward is credibility, with immediacy being a close second,\" she adds, acknowledging the significance of being able to delve into smart news stories as well as to break news, something the current celebrity-themed news hour rarely does.\n\nAlso of appeal is broadening the network's purview so that it isn't so narrowly focused on Hollywood. It will still be about celebrity, but as Hammer sees it, her viewers will be drawn to people who have done extraordinary things, whether in Atlanta, Nashville or Paris, and her plan is to bring E!'s cameras to them. \"One of the first things we'll do,\" she says, \"is to expand beyond the confines of how Hollywood defines celebrity, trends and aspiration.\"\n\n*****\n\nHammer's own aspirations were formed in Queens, where she was raised the youngest of three children. While her late father, who started his own pen manufacturing company in the family's garage, remains Hammer's role model, it was her many summers at sleepaway camp in upstate New York that she says prepared her for the team-oriented environment she's been able to build at the office. Her father taught her not to take no for an answer, a quality she admits she employs not only in the workplace but also at hotels, restaurants and stores. \"As long as you do it classily and nicely, you can get anything you want,\" Hammer says with a light laugh.\n\nAfter toying with careers in law and psychology, Hammer graduated from Boston University with a degree in photojournalism. From there, she talked her way into a graduate program in media and technology, before landing her first industry gig working as a production assistant on Boston PBS station WGBH's Infinity Factory. As she recalls, the role included picking up after a sheepdog. \"We all had to look after a cast member,\" she says, \"and since I was the youngest and greenest PA they gave me the dog.\"\n\nBy 1986, she had gained experience on a handful of series and took an executive gig at Lifetime, where she focused primarily on socially conscious documentaries. Three years later, she was offered a programming position at USA, then jointly owned by Paramount and MCA/Universal, where a superior handed her the reins to what is now the World Wrestling Entertainment franchise. \"I remember sitting in one of the early video conferences when Rod Perth said to me, 'Bonnie, I need you to take over the WWF. There needs to be some story there; it's all just big blowups and fighting,' \" she recalls of a programming block she had little interest in. \"I looked at him and said, 'Rod, are you crazy?' I'm pretty sure I flipped him the bird in the middle of the meeting, and then went home to my husband and threatened to quit.\"\n\nOn her husband's advice, Hammer spent the next few weeks familiarizing herself with the brand before showing up at imposing wrestling chief Vince McMahon's office. As the petite executive remembers it, she dressed down in boots and blue jeans, walked in and said, \"Listen, up until two weeks ago, I never watched your show. I don't know what your business is, and I don't care what your business is. The only thing I know is how to make good TV.\"\n\nShe proved as much, working closely with McMahon and his team to find stories and characters that viewers could invest in. During the Monday live shows, she'd be on the phone with the crew telling them what they should show and, in the case of one character taking a machete to another's genitals, when they needed to cut to black. The following mornings she'd be on the phone with McMahon discussing notes and soaring ratings. Nearly two decades later, Hammer calls the experience one of the most enjoyable of her career.\n\nSoon after, larger-than-life mogul Barry Diller took over, and Hammer insists one of the only reasons he kept her in the job was because of her wrestling ties. \"I think he thought it was kind of funny that a girl could deal with Vince McMahon,\" she says. By 2001, Hammer was upped to president of Syfy (then Sci Fi Channel), and while she had spent much of her youth devouring science fiction books, she made it her mission to broaden the network beyond its core sci-fi audience. Hammer did so, bringing the network from a ranking in the high 20s to the top 10 on the back of such fare as her $40 million Steven Spielberg miniseries Taken, which debuted to Emmy acclaim in 2002. It was also that project, which cost another $10 million or so to market, that ultimately gave Hammer a career-altering boost from Diller, whom she counts among her mentors.\n\nWith the team around her doubting her instincts — and sniping at the show's harrowing price tag — Hammer sent an episode to Diller for review and reassurance. His response, in an e-mail with bright orange, 18 or 20 point type: \"Honey, if all your episodes are as gluely compelling, I think you have a hit on your hands. Ignore the world.\" So, she recalls, \"we held our nose and jumped. It was the highest-rated limited series not just for Syfy, but ever on cable.\" To this day, the e-mail remains in a special folder on Hammer's computer.\n\nIn 2004, she returned to USA as president, commissioning a brand audit that revealed what she had feared about the network. \"What we heard back was that USA was like an old, worn-out shoe, and I wanted it to be a Louboutin,\" she says, her personal style in keeping with the latter. In her attempt to revitalize the network, she honed in on character and an upbeat \"blue skies\" philosophy, green-lighting shows including Burn Notice, Royal Pains and recent effort Suits. The logo changed with it: no more American flag; no more capital letters. \"We made it more relatable and accessible,\" she explains, not to mention more popular and profitable. USA has now been the No. 1 cable network for five consecutive years and is also the most lucrative in NBCUniversal's stable.\n\nAmong the professional qualities USA's McCumber is most impressed by is Hammer's savvy management style, which doesn't allow for silos. \"If we're talking about developing a show, each one of us from marketing to programming to ad sales will read the scripts and talk about casting,\" he says of the unique approach where every member of the team is invested. \"This way, when we win, we win together; and when we lose, there's no pointing figures because we all made the decisions together.\"\n\nHammer's vision has garnered fans in the creative community. The Bourne Identity director Doug Liman, who has two shows on USA in Covert Affairs and Suits, likens Hammer to a modern-day Jack Warner. \"In the olden days, when a filmmaker went to work for a studio, they worked for a place that had a strong identity and a very powerful leader. The end result is these enduring movies that filmmakers like myself today are trying to figure out how to make,\" he says. \"At USA, Bonnie has created a version of that.\"\n\n*****\n\nThese days, the married mother of two — son Jesse, 18, and daughter Ki Mae, 31 — is getting used to her new status as a chairman and an empty nester. (Jesse is currently at Dartmouth, where Ki Mae and husband Dale are alumni.) Both have been major adjustments: the former because she's had to learn to be arms length after a lengthy career of being precisely the opposite; the latter because she's spent the last two decades living in tony Westport, Conn., where she's primarily known as \"Jesse's mom.\"\n\nLooking to the future, Hammer's goals are no longer about acquiring more networks to run, but rather about exploring new mediums. \"There's a bit of quiet wisdom that comes when you're not a newbie at this. You become a lot more comfortable with yourself and you're no longer climbing,\" says Hammer. As skaters whiz by at the nearby Rockefeller Center rink, she opens up about all of the other things that she's been quietly itching to do, including yoga, a fitting fitness routine for someone who historically has found activities to reflect her life state. (During her stint under Diller, she took up kick-boxing, where her six-foot bag had his name as a strike target.)\n\nThere's also a tongue-in-cheek book that she's been toying with writing for women coming up in the entertainment industry, along with a movie. \"I've not had any interest in running a movie studio, but I want to make one feature film,\" she declares as a plate of berries arrives for dessert. She hasn't come across the right property yet, but says she's thinking something \"upbeat and aspirational,\" a movie along the lines of Field of Dreams or Forrest Gump that leaves people feeling hope. She continues, \"Something that's fun, a little twisted and out there, and even a bit provocative but has humor and resonates.\"\n\nShe takes a beat, before adding, \"It's just something that I've always wanted to do.\" To know Hammer, who has made a career out of turning desire into reality, is to know she will.\n\nNina Tassler\n\nAsk Two Broke Girls creator Michael Patrick King to come up with a great anecdote about Nina Tassler, and he'll ask you to give him a moment as he gives it some thought. It's been only six months since the CBS entertainment president picked up his comedy, and he's still proving to her that it belongs on a schedule of long-running hits from the CSI shows to The Big Bang Theory. \"Let's see,\" the producer says, buying time by hurling adjectives you hear often about Tassler: \"smart,\" \"maternal,\" \"passionate.\"\n\nAnd then, bam — he has it: \"Nina had the balls to fire a horse.\"\n\nPHOTOS: THR's 2011 Women in Entertainment Power 100\n\nThe horse, in this case, is Chestnut, a vestige of the former life of one his \"broke girls,\" the now penniless daughter of a Bernie Madoff type. King had cast a blond buckskin, more fitting for Westerns, which was waiting for its scene when Tassler came to set for a run-though. The native New Yorker, who grew up riding, knew the equine actor had been miscast.\n\n\"That horse wasn't the kind they kept at the Central Park stables,\" says Tassler. So she saw to it that her promising freshman comedy recast the horse, hiring a more appropriate, chocolate-colored thoroughbred.\n\nTassler keeps a replica of the horse propped up in her office, as much a reminder of her past as it is indicative of her hands-on style that has helped make CBS the most-watched network for eight of the past nine seasons. Now, in a fall that was supposed to be upended by casting overhauls — Ashton Kutcher replacing Charlie Sheen on Two and a Half Men and Ted Danson in for Laurence Fishburne on CSI — CBS has managed to lure more viewers than any of its broadcast rivals, actually growing its audience in a shrinking network environment. Two months in, CBS can claim 12 of the top 15 scripted shows and is the first since 2002 to have the No. 1 comedy (Men), No. 1 drama (NCIS) and No. 1 new series (Two Broke Girls) among the prized 18-to-49 demo, putting to rest the perception of CBS as just a place for the senior set. New entries like Unforgettable were quickly granted full seasons, and Men became the first comedy in a decade to rank as the No. 1 program four weeks into the season.\n\nTassler, 54, credits Kutcher's social-media fan base along with creator Chuck Lorre's creative ingenuity for Men's renewed strength, preferring to leave the conversation there for fear of having to delve into the still uncomfortable, and tired, topic of Sheen. \"We turned disaster into success, and she had a lot to do with it,\" says her boss, Leslie Moonves. In fact, it was Tassler who had a longtime relationship with Kutcher's lawyer, Robert Offer, and put the deal in motion.\n\nIn recent months, Tassler's hands have been all over CSI, first as the show was recasting Fishburne's part and then as it was setting up Elisabeth Shue to step in for Marg Helgenberger later this season. \"Nina is in that trench with you making decisions if not in body, in spirit — though most of the time in body too,\" says CSI showrunner Carol Mendelsohn. \"If you come in with a great idea, there's nobody more passionate than she is.\"\n\nTassler loved the arts before she knew there was a business in show business. As the daughter of a Jewish father and a Catholic Puerto Rican mother raised in a quiet dairy farm community in upstate New York, where her parents ran a sleepaway camp, she was drawn to the theater. \"It felt like an environment where you didn't have to fit a mold,\" says Tassler, the oldest of three kids.\n\nUpon graduating with a theater major from Boston University, Tassler moved to Manhattan to become an actor. In between auditions, she got a taste for the business at the Roundabout Theater Company. She remained there until her husband, Jerry Levine, whom she has been with since she was 18, landed a part in the film Teen Wolf. The married couple soon moved to Los Angeles, where she struggled initially to find work. (Today, Tassler and Levine have a 23-year-old son, a 13-year-old daughter and a close-knit family who have followed them west.)\n\nIn the mid-'80s, a young Tassler scored an assistant gig at the Irv Schechter Agency, where she rose to become an agent before making the leap to the bigger Triad Artists. \"I had this crisis. 'What do I do? Oh, my God. I'll never be an actress. My career's over,' \" Tassler recalls. \"My husband said, 'Play the hand you're dealt. If you want to be in the business, take whatever job you can get.' \" She did, amassing a portfolio of clients that included Tony Curtis, Victoria Principal and Meredith Baxter, before deciding she wanted a job where she got to stay with the material.\n\nIn what would begin a two-plus decade creative partnership, Tassler put all of her effort into securing a position at Lorimar Television, now Warner Bros., where Moonves was in charge. \"I began a full-scale assault on Leslie and everybody at Lorimar to get me a job — everything short of someone having me arrested,\" Tassler says, chuckling at her own chutzpah.\n\nMoonves was struck by her persistence. \"I'd already decided she was someone I wanted to have on my team, but she had 50 people call me. Finally, I said, 'All right, I'm going to hire you, now please tell them to stop, I have a job to do,' \" he says. \"Hiring her was one of the best moves I ever made.\" Tassler remained there from 1990 to 1996, working on series like ER before following her boss and mentor to turn around a then ailing CBS.\n\nWhen the pair arrived at CBS, Moonves a year or two ahead of Tassler, the network had lost the NFL and its average viewer was well outside the 18-49 demo. But by 2001, Moonves, then entertainment president, had Survivor and the Tassler-developed CSI, which catapulted CBS to No. 1 on Thursday, TV's most lucrative night. From there, Moonves and Tassler, head of drama development at the time, continued to add series — Without a Trace, Cold Case, NCIS and a suite of CSI spinoffs — and viewers.\n\nToday, as the biz's longest-running network chief — the petite Tassler took the reins as entertainment president in 2004 — she presides over a pair of billion-dollar franchises, NCIS and CSI, and the kind of ratings consistency that makes her the envy of the industry. Even the knock on the CBS lineup as a somewhat formulaic schedule of broad-based comedies and down-the-middle procedurals is a backhanded compliment given the results it yields.\n\nStill, there are genres she'd love to try — or in some cases, try again. Among them: musicals, Westerns, performance-based reality shows and a drama with a young female voice. \"Science fiction is something I'd love to find a way to do so our audience could really embrace it … Oh, and I'd love to try a funny hourlong comedy,\" she says, overcome with enthusiasm.\n\nSitting beside the executive as her wheels spin with ideas, it's easy to imagine all of the trenches Tassler has yet to dive into. No matter what comes at her, she declares, \"I'm still standing. Like I always say, 'I'll stop when I'm dead.' \"\n\nMichele Ganeless\n\nIf there's anything to glean from the decor in michele ganeless' office, it's that, even after nearly two decades at Comedy Central, she's still its biggest fan.\n\nHer corner space at the company's headquarters in Lower Manhattan is a shrine to the brand. The assemblage of tchotchkes includes a bag of Cheesy Poofs, South Park snarkmeister Cartman's favorite snack, and a number of items related to her Northwestern University classmate Stephen Colbert, including a bobblehead and a blowup of Colbert and Jon Stewart on the cover of Rolling Stone in 2006.\n\nPHOTOS: THR's 2011 Women in Entertainment Power 100\n\nShe was at the National Mall in October with more than 200,000 others for Stewart and Colbert's Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear. She was among the guests at the Broadway opening of South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone's Tony-winning musical The Book of Mormon. And she has spent many an afternoon in the audience at The Daily Show and The Colbert Report — though with a 3½-year-old daughter at home, she has had to curtail that somewhat. \"I can't go as regularly now because they tape right around dinner and bath time,\" Ganeless admits.\n\nHer most important job, as she sees it, is to enable the subversive brilliance of her stars. \"We want people who have their finger on the zeitgeist,\" she says. \"And we give them the creative freedom that not a lot of places will give them.\"\n\nOnce a stepping stone (original Daily Show host Craig Kilborn left for The Late Late Show on CBS, and ABC poached Bill Maher and Politically Incorrect), Comedy Central is now a destination for comedians. Last year, the network signed contract extensions with Stewart and Colbert through June 2013. And on Nov. 16, Comedy Central renewed South Park for three more seasons, keeping the show that began in 1997 on the air until at least 2016.\n\n\"My job is to create the right environment so they want to come work here. And that is an open environment that rewards creativity and is very hands-off,\" she says. \"I do not manage Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert or Daniel Tosh. We identify talent that has a very singular point of view, and we give them a platform to do their thing.\"\n\nTheir thing, of course, includes lampooning sacred cows, which can mean alienating religious leaders, decency watchdogs and sometimes even Hollywood A-listers. \"I don't feel like they would ever hang us out to dry,\" says South Park executive producer Anne Garefino. \"We're good partners. And Michele is the point person for all of that. I feel like we're all on the same team.\"\n\nGaneless, 46, herself stands in contrast to the riot of sometimes-puerile guy humor that abounds at Comedy Central, which targets men ages 18 to 34. On this unseasonably warm early November afternoon, she wears a simple black V-neck sweater tucked into black slacks. Her only discernible jewelry is a modest diamond wedding band. It is a new item: She married Peter Land — the father of her daughter, Lucy, and a communications executive at PepsiCo — in October. Low-key and bookish, she approaches her job with a wonkiness honed in research, where her career originated when the Nyack, N.Y., native landed an entry-level job at a small Chicago research firm after graduating from college.\n\n\"I like numbers,\" she says. \"I loved research, and I still do. It's the basis of how I make all of my decisions to this day. It's all about the consumer, about our fans. And if you listen to them, they will tell you how to be successful.\"\n\nSays Doug Herzog, MTV Entertainment Networks Group president and her boss and mentor: \"Michele is a great strategic thinker. I'm kind of ADD and a little bit more improvisational. I think that's one of the reasons we work so well together.\"\n\nGaneless joined Viacom in 1990 as a research manager for Ha!, the precursor to Comedy Central, and moved up the ranks at MTV and Comedy Central in research and planning as well as programming. Except for a stint at USA Network from 2001-04, she has spent her entire career at the company and was a key member of the programming team that launched The Daily Show and South Park.\n\n\"Michele is one of the architects of the Comedy Central brand,\" says Herzog. \"She's really worked in almost every facet of this company. She has a true understanding of the brand because she really helped create it.\"\n\nThis year, the network ranks as the No. 1 entertainment brand in primetime among men 18-34 and is second only to ESPN across all of TV in that demo. The Daily Show and The Colbert Report have bested their late-night broadcast competition and rank Nos. 1 and 2, respectively, among viewers 18-24 and 18-34 in late-night. The network had the highest-rated week in its 20-year history in September during broadcast TV premiere week, thanks to a roast of Charlie Sheen (a booking coup that nabbed 7.6 million viewers), Tosh's College Campus Invasion special (4.2 million viewers), the second-season premiere of Workaholics (2.6 million viewers) and the premiere of Jeff Dunham's latest stand-up special (6.5 million viewers).\n\nGaneless admits that a record-breaking week can bring a new set of anxieties. \"I would be lying if I said I didn't worry about topping it,\" she says. But together with her development and programming teams, she is actively plotting the next frontier, including expanding original programming into the post-midnight hours after Colbert's show wraps and continuing to grow the network's ancillary business, which has become key in keeping top talent at Comedy Central.\n\nComedy Central takes a \"farm team\" approach to building talent, which then can get 360-degree deals that include websites, consumer products, national tours, one-hour specials and DVDs. \"The key is finding these people before they become the Jon Stewarts or the Daniel Toshs,\" says Ganeless. Tosh, who hosts Tosh.0 and has been with the network for more than 10 years, was discovered by the talent department that scours the comedy club and festival circuit for promising young comedians. He started out doing five-minute stand-up sets, then graduated to hosting stand-up specials and landed his own show in 2009. Buoyed by a robust social media presence (6.8 million Facebook fans, 4 million Twitter followers) and original web content that drives the highest traffic to the Tosh.0 site when the show is on hiatus, Tosh.0 is now the No. 1 program on the network, with more than 4 million viewers an episode this season. It is also TV's top-rated show Tuesdays at 10?p.m. among men 18-24 and 18-34.\n\n\"I think, truthfully, Tosh is our best example of development and programming and digital really working in absolute concert with one another,\" says Herzog. \"And it's Michele's job to bring that all together.\"\n\nGail Berman\n\nGail Berman and partner Lloyd Braun have relied on two primary mantras in running their company, which in less than five years has emerged as a player in developing TV series on broadcast and cable, creating websites that pull in millions of visitors and placing several feature films in development and production.\n\n\"Every day we have to have a couple laughs,\" says Berman. \"And no assholes allowed.\"\n\nPHOTOS: THR's 2011 Women in Entertainment Power 100\n\nBerman is buoyant as she talks about the privately held company's rapid growth. Wearing a pantsuit in her bright and airy west Los Angeles office, she laughs as she shows off some of the very personal art on her walls, such as a picture of Queen Elizabeth with Berman's head pasted on it that was a gift from comedian Steve Martin; a portrait of Alfred Hitchcock, her favorite filmmaker; and a mounted lightbulb that she says inspires her to have \"good ideas.\"\n\nIt's Berman's sense of humor, as well as her humanity and humility, that Braun says made him go after her as his partner to create a \"21st century media company.\"\n\n\"So often you begin to feel people are lying to you,\" says Braun, former chairman of the ABC Entertainment Group. \"There isn't any of that with Gail. She is first and foremost a wonderful human being. When you add on that she is a fantastic businesswoman, has fabulous creative skills and is trustworthy, you know why I feel fortunate to have found her as a partner.\"\n\nAdds Braun: \"She's also a hell of a lot of fun to be with. You're going to have bad days, shit happens. When you have somebody down the hall who you can sit with and laugh, it makes all the difference.\"\n\nUnder Berman's watch, BermanBraun has cultivated three thriving divisions: TV, digital and features. In scripted TV, they have Alphas on Syfy, just picked up for a second season; the Brad Meltzer unscripted Decoded for History Channel, entering its second season; Swords, in its third season on Discovery; Junk Gypsies in production for HGTV; and the Jenny Bicks pilot Modern Love, being developed for Lifetime. (They have a first-look deal at NBC, where they are developing both comedy and drama pilots.) On the features side, upcoming projects include Ben Stiller's Rent-a-Ghost with Fox and Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus for Summit.\n\nBut it's in new media that BermanBraun has scored with sites like Wonderwall, the primary celebrity destination on MSN, and Glo for women, created with MSN and Hachette Filipacchi Media, which draws more than 5 million unique visitors a month, according to ComScore. Braun says they expect to have 10 sites by the end of next year, which they divide according to their areas of expertise. On Glo, Braun defers to Berman. \"Gail knows that area better than I do,\" he explains. \"She spends far more time making sure the editorial voice remains true and consistent. I'm capable of doing it, but I know she's going to be better at it than I am.\"\n\nBefore the current phase of her professional life, Berman, 55, already had a stellar reputation. When Jennifer Salke, now president of NBC Entertainment, was at Fox Broadcasting, she watched as Berman took the network from fourth to first place during her five-year tenure. She recalls Berman as a \"great leader\" but not the typical executive.\n\n\"It was common to see her walking down the hall with no shoes on with a megaphone calling out to everyone, 'Come on, what's going on out here? What's everybody excited about? We should be celebrating this!' \" says Salke. \"She was just great about rallying the troops and getting people motivated and excited to work for her.\"\n\nNow Salke is enjoying working with Berman at NBC, where the two have partnered on such projects as the comedy Apocalipstick (being done with Universal TV) and the drama Masters and Apprentice.\n\n\"Talented people are incredibly loyal to her,\" Salke says. \"She has deep ties with the writing, producing and acting community because she really knows her stuff. She's also very strong and direct, but not a bitch. It's a rare combination.\"\n\nBerman began her career from a rare vantage point. The daughter of an insurance executive and a housewife, she graduated with a degree in theater from the University of Maryland in 1978 and got her start in show business producing a live stage version of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat in Baltimore (later taking it to Broadway, where she produced several other shows) before working for Comedy Central. She'd met her husband of 31 years, comedy writer and producer Bill Masters, in school, and when he got a movie deal a decade later (his credits include Seinfeld and Murphy Brown), they moved to Hollywood with their twin children, a boy and a girl, now in college.\n\nShe joined Sandollar Productions (owned by producer Sandy Gallin and Dolly Parton), which launched the Fox hit Buffy the Vampire Slayer, a series she went on to produce. That was where Peter Chernin recruited her to start a TV division for a joint venture of New Regency and Fox, where she created such hits as Fox's Malcolm in the Middle. That success led her to Fox, where as the network's first female president she launched juggernauts like American Idol and 24.\n\n\"She pushed people to get out of their comfort zones,\" says Salke. \"In that way she was very inspiring to a lot of young executives.\"\n\nNina Tassler, CBS president and her longtime friend, met Berman when they worked on a pilot for Regency in 2000. Tassler adds another layer to Berman's appeal: \"Gail has always listened to her inner voice,\" Tassler says. \"She has exquisite taste and great instincts.\"\n\nWhen Berman left Fox to become president of the movie division at Paramount in 2005, those instincts told her she wasn't in the right place. She never adjusted to the corporate life and was out as part of a studio restructuring after 18 months (with two years left on her contract). Her gut told her she wanted to be entrepreneurial without the pressure of a big corporation.\n\n\"You have to be self-motivated to do this,\" adds Berman. \"And Lloyd is a wonderful partner. I don't know that I would feel so great about it if I were doing this alone.\"\n\nAlso: \"I never wake up with that feeling in the pit in my stomach. That's a positive sign.\"\n\nLorrie Bartlett\n\n9Lorrie bartlett has a confession to make.\n\n\"I'm so obsessed with KDAY right now, you know, the old-school hip-hop station?\" says the ICM agent in a tone way too bubbly for this early hour on a Monday morning. \"On the way to work today I heard 'Sorry Miss Jackson,' and I was doing my dance in the car. By the time I got to the morning meeting, I felt like, 'Wow, there's nothing I can't do today!' \"\n\nSitting with Bartlett in a conference room overlooking Century City, one learns quickly that her eerie peppiness is just one quality that sets the 48-year-old apart from her peers. The first black agent — male or female — to lead a talent department at a major agency, Bartlett speaks about her work with passionate but frank warmth. It's a no-nonsense vibe that has allowed her to keep, woo, sign and cultivate such valuable talent as Zoe Saldana (Avatar), Eric Stonestreet (Modern Family), Emmy Rossum (Shameless) and Kelly Macdonald (Boardwalk Empire) while also expanding the resumes of established movie stars including Josh Duhamel, Mira Sorvino and Michael Keaton.\n\nWhether it's for a summer tentpole, indie film, miniseries or network comedy, Bartlett says she applies the same sensibility when counseling clients. \"We are here to elevate people's careers, not sell in volume,\" she says. \"With every decision, there has to be serious, careful consideration of why or why not to proceed with a certain project. Everything should add value. As a talent, you never want your agent feeling like a used car salesman.\"\n\nBartlett's instincts for quality control were first sparked when she was a kid, one of two, growing up in the small town of Monrovia, Calif., just east of Pasadena. As \"the kid with her nose in a book on family road trips,\" she was especially impressionable when it came to her father, Robert, who spent time away from his job at a trucking company to act as city mayor to the tune of $100 per month.\n\nShe recalls a colorful story that had Robert flying to Detroit to procure an unscheduled meeting with Lee Iacocca, then president and CEO of Chrysler, to request that the executive not pull his company's dealerships out of economically depressed Monrovia. \"He told him, 'Our city will be a disaster,' so Iacocca decided to keep them there a few more years,\" recalls Bartlett. \"I loved the drive he had, the idea that you can't take no for an answer. My dad was definitely my role model.\"\n\nBartlett also showed early leanings toward entertainment in the form of movie-soaked summers spent with her maternal grandparents. \"I loved to be entertained,\" she says. \"I think I had an early, very serious admiration for people who could create, who could act. I could never do that! When you see people who are such good actors or you read an amazing script … to this day, I'm constantly amazed. It makes me very happy that I actually still feel this way.\"\n\nPerhaps sensing she couldn't actually make a living based on how \"enamored with Hollywood\" she felt, Bartlett opted to study diplomacy and world affairs at Occidental College. She landed her first job at 20, while still in school, answering hotline calls for the Rape Prevention Education Program at UCLA. Despite loving the mission of her work there, Bartlett still had an itch for Hollywood, and after graduation, she decided to revisit her early admiration for artists — \"Working at an agency seemed the world's biggest playing field,\" she says — and won a coveted position at William Morris on the desk of literary agent Bobbi Thompson and, two months later, under talent agent Joan Hyler. Although she enjoyed watching her mentors cultivate talent such as Tim Burton and Gus Van Sant, Bartlett felt lost among the masses of would-be superagents. \"Those two women were great, but there were a lot of politics — I just didn't feel comfortable in my skin there,\" says Bartlett. \"It was like a lot of mini-agencies under one umbrella. There wasn't much solidarity.\"\n\nIt was around that time that Bob Gersh was looking to infuse new energy into his agency and in 1992 hired Bartlett, making her a full-fledged agent less than a year later. One of Bartlett's first clients at Gersh offered her the opportunity to test-drive her creative instincts: In the mid-1990s, Beastie Boy Adam Horovitz was seeking to branch out into movies and turned to Bartlett for counsel. After some film parts came and went (Paul Rudd's breakout role in the 1995 comedy Clueless was initially offered to Horovitz), Bartlett sensed her client wasn't fully invested emotionally. The two decided they would put movie work on hold. \"What surprised me about that first experience was how much he relied on me to discern the situation on his behalf,\" says Bartlett. \"You really do need a working knowledge of who they are, and what they want, as people. 'This will add value to your career because …' — you should always have an answer to that.\"\n\nBartlett spent 16 years at Gersh before landing at ICM in 2008. One of her star clients, Saldana, with whom Bartlett has worked for a decade, followed her to ICM (as did Megan Fox and Duhamel, among others). Saldana recalls her first meeting with Bartlett when she came to L.A. for the 2002 premiere of the Britney Spears movie Crossroads. \"I was with my mom and we met the entire Gersh team,\" says the actress, then 24. \"After, my mom said: 'I liked that lady with the glasses. She is very nice. You would be in good hands with her.' And I have been ever since.\" Saldana remembers one moment when Bartlett had to get tough with her. While promoting the 2004 film Haven at the Toronto International Film Festival, Saldana answered a news conference question, in her own words, \"quite rudely,\" and had to face an incensed Bartlett in the green room. \"She said, 'We do not do that. We're trying to sell a movie and you essentially told these people to f– off? No way,'?\" remembers Saldana. \"I respect her so much for never biting her tongue and always having my best interests at heart. We are definitely kindred spirits.\"\n\nBartlett says her long partnership with Saldana has taught her a lot about the business, including some of the inherent challenges of steering the career of a non-white actor, even one as bankable and beautiful as Saldana. \"You definitely hear 'no' a lot more,\" she says, laughing. \"I remember we were at the premiere of Avatar, and it was as if it were Zoe's first movie. I joked with her, 'How it does it feel to be a 10-year overnight sensation?' By then she'd already worked with Ashton Kutcher in Guess Who? She was directed by J.J. Abrams in Star Trek and starred with Tom Hanks in The Terminal. The business has such a short memory, but we look at it as a challenge.\"\n\nThis year, Bartlett was promoted by ICM agency head Chris Silbermann to her current post as co-head of the talent department alongside Dar Rollins and Adam Schweitzer. (She declines to comment on the recent report of possible shake-ups at the agency.) Her new post made more headlines than most corporate shuffles do as she became the first person of color to assume such a position in the business. It's a distinction that Bartlett approaches with a lighthearted reverence.\n\n\"It's funny … it never occurred to me that I couldn't do something because I'm black,\" says Bartlett. \"Though, that's not to say I'm not always reminded when I go out into the world, especially in Hollywood, that I'm not Caucasian. I do want some girl who's going to Crenshaw High School to think, 'She did it; why not me?' That's what most resonates. I've sacrificed a lot to be better at my job. But I did it because I love it. And I just happen to be African-American.\"\n\nTo Bartlett's marquee talent, she is simply a great agent. Before she was an Emmy nominee for Boardwalk Empire, Scottish film actress Macdonald was at a professional crossroads and calls signing with Bartlett in 2004 \"the best move\" she ever made. \"She really kick-started my career in the U.S.,\" says Macdonald. \"She got me in front of the Coen brothers' casting director before they'd even started casting No Country for Old Men. She is more proactive than anyone I've ever worked with before. It seems an obvious way to operate, but you'd be surprised.\"\n\nEmmy winner Stonestreet, whom Bartlett signed with a team of agents in 2009, says the agent \"knows who she is\" and never panders to the status quo. \"I respect her calm, confident demeanor,\" he says. \"And I love her out-of-the-box thinking and approach to my career and to show business in general. She has exquisite taste, in actors and otherwise.\"\n\nBartlett's tastes do every so often extend outside the realm of entertainment; luckily for her partner of more than eight years, Mike Clayborn, who works for the Los Angeles-based nonprofit food program PACE, they include football. \"I tell him every Sunday, 'You are so lucky,' \" says Bartlett of her weekend ritual at home in Laurel Canyon with Clayborn, with whom she has helped raise his 22-year-old daughter-and-son twins.\n\nThe couple also likes to escape to their family home in Orange County's Dana Point (\"I drive over the hill and just … exhale. It's such a cool, laid-back spot,\" she says) and to indulge in Bartlett's many music obsessions — most of the time together.\n\n\"We saw Mary J. Blige and Jay-Z together,\" she says, adding with a laugh, \"but I had to go see Dolly Parton alone. He wasn't into that.\""
