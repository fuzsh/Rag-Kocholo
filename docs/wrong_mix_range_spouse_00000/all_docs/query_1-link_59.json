        "text": "Rosalie’s Ham’s debut novel The Dressmaker was a bestseller and made into a film starring Kate Winslet so the sequel really needs no introduction. But since the frocks are so gorgeous, here’s a quick reminder anyway.\n\nLike its predecessor, the sequel, The Dressmaker’s Secret is a romcom-revenge-drama, but Tilly Dunnage is not a femme-fatale this time. When the story begins she is hiding out in Melbourne after the fire that destroyed Dungatar, and keeping a low profile in the second-rate dress Salon Mystique in Collins Street. The satire is barbed: Ham sets the scene during a Coronation frenzy, when every woman wants The Perfect Gown in which to attend the social events taking place to celebrate the ascension of Elizabeth to the faraway throne of England. Tilly, of course, is a fish out of water in a salon that shamelessly copies designs from Mrs Flock’s buying expeditions to Europe, and she chafes at the pretensions and dishonesty of the place.\n\nShe has a reason for sticking it out, and that’s Joe, her son by Teddy Watt who died in an accident in Book I, just as their romance was in bloom. Since there was no child-care in those unenlightened days, and Joe’s grandmother (like everyone else) blamed Tilly for the death, she has to place him in an orphanage until she has enough money to bring him home to a place of her own. This being the fifties, that implies respectability — necessitating a husband — but Tilly is still grieving for Teddy so the solution is a marriage of convenience…\n\nWhen the cross-dressing Sergeant Farrat tracks Tilly down, he (of course) wants her to make gorgeous outfits for him, but that leads the harridans from Dunagatar to her trail as well. They not only want stunning frocks, they also want vengeance, and the custody of little Joe is the way to get it. This scenario facilitates a hot-bed of malice, envy and blame, plus some very dark acts of vengeance and spite.\n\nThe novel seems to have an eye to possible film adaptation, with lots of very detailed descriptions of clothes, witty dialogue and short filmic scenes, which made it somewhat difficult to keep track of the numerous characters, especially if it’s been a while since reading the first book. It’s longer than The Dressmaker too, and might have benefitted from a bit of pruning, especially the too-frequent inarticulate dialogue from the two-year-old.\n\nThough Tilly has an epiphany about the values of the fashion industry, this is a not a novel of ideas, and its theme of accepting diversity seems to apply to some characters more than others. But as a bit of escapism with glamour thrown in for good measure, The Dressmaker’s Secret will please a lot of readers.\n\nAuthor: Rosalie Ham\n\nTitle: the Dressmaker’s Secret\n\nPublisher: Picador, (Pan Macmillan), 2020\n\nISBN: 9781760982027, pbk., 378 pages\n\nReview copy courtesy of Picador,"
