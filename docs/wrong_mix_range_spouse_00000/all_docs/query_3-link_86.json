        "text": "“Remember the Alamo!” It’s a quote familiar to any good Texan and a classic line from American history, but where did it originate?\n\nNo one knows for certain who first said, “Remember the Alamo.” The last stand of the Texian and Tejano soldiers at the Alamo mission - that is, American and Mexican settlers who fought together for an independent Texas - became the rallying cry for Texas independence. By the Battle of San Jacinto, only a month or so later, it was a common enough phrase that General Sam Houston -- who would become one of Texas’s first senators and after whom the city of Houston is named -- referenced it when he rallied his troops."
