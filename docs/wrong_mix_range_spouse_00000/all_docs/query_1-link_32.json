        "text": "However, Kate revealed she was “vilified” for her appearance in the film, and the negative media coverage that surrounded her at the time changed her for good.\n\nThe 47-year-old told British Vogue in a recent interview that she “absolutely learned how to look after myself the hard way” due to the backlash she received for having a perfectly normal body.\n\n“What I really remember vividly is that when I did Titanic and was so thrust into the public eye, I was shocked and horrified by how vilified I was by mainstream media,” Kate explained.\n\nShe said that while it “doesn’t happen” nowadays, she’s still upset by the “nasty sh*t” people say about celebrities on social media.\n\nHowever, Kate believes that the horrible articles about women’s bodies in the media have reduced enormously.\n\n“But mainstream media behaving in these really irresponsible damaging ways – I do think that has actually stopped,” she added.\n\nKate has been a champion of women in recent years and spoke out about the harmful effects social media was having on young women as she accepted a BAFTA for her role in I Am Ruth, in which she starred alongside her daughter Mia Threapleton, 22.\n\nDuring her chat with British Vogue, the Oscar-winning actress heaped praise on the “fearless” young generation of people heading into Hollywood.\n\n“They just don’t know fear when it comes to stepping out – they don’t know that bit. They just know, ‘Yes, let’s go’,” she said."
