        "text": "French actress (born 1975)\n\nMarion Cotillard (French: [maʁjɔ̃ kɔtijaʁ] ⓘ; born 30 September 1975) is a French actress. She has appeared in independent films and blockbusters in both European and Hollywood productions and her accolades include an Academy Award from two nominations, a British Academy Film Award from two nominations, two César Awards from eight nominations, a European Film Award from two nominations, a Golden Globe Award from four nominations, a Lumières Award from two nominations and a Chopard Trophy. She became a Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters in France in 2010 and was promoted to Officer in 2016, the same year she was named a Knight of the Legion of Honour. She has served as a spokeswoman for Greenpeace since 2001. Cotillard was the face of the Lady Dior handbag from 2008 to 2017, and since 2020, she has been the face of the fragrance Chanel No. 5.\n\nCotillard started acting as a child in theatre and TV films. At the age of 17, she had her first English-language role in the TV series Highlander (1993), and made her feature film debut in The Story of a Boy Who Wanted to Be Kissed (1994). Her breakthrough came in the successful French film Taxi (1998), which earned her a César Award nomination for Most Promising Actress. She made her Hollywood debut with a small role in Big Fish (2003); won her first César Award for Best Supporting Actress for A Very Long Engagement (2004), and had her first major English-language role in A Good Year (2006).\n\nFor her portrayal of French singer Édith Piaf in La Vie en Rose (2007), Cotillard won her second César Award, a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Lumières Award and the Academy Award for Best Actress, becoming the first and (as of 2024) only actor to win an Academy Award for a French-language performance, and also the second actress to have won this award for a non-English language performance. Cotillard earned several critics' awards for The Immigrant (2013) and Two Days, One Night (2014), three more Golden Globe nominations for Nine (2009), Rust and Bone (2012), and Annette (2021), and received a second Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for Two Days, One Night in 2015, her second nomination for a French-language film, becoming one of only seven actors to receive multiple Academy Award nominations for non-English language performances.

She has also narrated several documentaries and provided voice acting for the animated films Happy Feet (2006), The Little Prince (2015), April and the Extraordinary World (2015), Minions (2015), Charlotte (2021), and The Inventor (2023). Her other notable French, Belgian and Canadian films include La Belle Verte (1996), Pretty Things (2001), Love Me If You Dare (2003), Dikkenek (2006), Little White Lies (2010), It's Only the End of the World (2016), and Little Girl Blue (2023).\n\nCotillard was born on 30 September 1975 in Paris,[1] and grew up in Alfortville, in the southern suburbs of Paris, where she lived with her family in a flat on the 18th floor of a tower block[2] until she was 11 years old,[3] when her family moved to the small commune of Aulnay-la-Rivière in the Loiret department in north-central France.[3] She grew up in an artistically inclined household.[4] Her mother, Niseema Theillaud [fr], is an actress and drama teacher.[2][5] Her father, Jean-Claude Cotillard, is an actor, teacher, former mime, and theatre director, of Breton descent.[2] She has two younger twin brothers, Quentin and Guillaume, a writer and a sculptor.[2][6] The family later moved to La Beauce, a town near Orléans, where her father set up his own theatre company.[2]\n\nCotillard's father introduced her to cinema, and as a child she would mimic Louise Brooks and Greta Garbo in her own bedroom.[2] She began acting during her childhood, appearing in one of her father's plays.[7] At the age of 3, she appeared on stage for the first time opposite her mother.[8]\n\nAt the age of 15, Cotillard entered the Conservatoire d'art dramatique [fr] in Orléans.[9] She graduated in 1994 and then moved to Paris to pursue an acting career.[4]\n\nIn order to pay her bills in her teens, she started making key-chains in her own factory at home and sold them at candy stores.[10][11]\n\nCotillard speaks French and English fluently.[12] She learned English at the age of 11.[13] She started learning Spanish at school but then abandoned it.[14] Years later, she began studying the language again after watching Lovers of the Arctic Circle (1998) by Julio Medem, which is one of her favorite films.[14] She also started learning Danish because she wanted to work with director Thomas Vinterberg after watching his 1998 film The Celebration, but that did not work out.[15]\n\nIn 1982, at the age of 7, Cotillard made her on-screen debut in the short film Le monde des tout-petits,[16][17] directed by Claude Cailloux and broadcast by the French TV channel TF1.[18] The following year, she appeared in another short film for TF1, Lucie, also directed by Cailloux.[18] In 1991, she appeared in a TV spot against alcoholism titled \"Tu t'es vu quand t'as bu?\" (\"You've seen yourself when you're drunk?\"),[18] launched by the French Committee for Health Education.[19]\n\nAfter small appearances and performances in theatre, Cotillard had occasional, minor roles in television series such as Highlander in 1993,[20] where she had her first English-speaking role aged 17.[10] Her career as a film actress began in the mid-1990s, with minor roles in Philippe Harel's The Story of a Boy Who Wanted to Be Kissed (1994), which was her feature film debut at the age of 18,[12] and in Arnaud Desplechin's My Sex Life... or How I Got into an Argument, and Coline Serreau's La Belle Verte, both released in 1996.[21] Also in 1996, she had her first leading role in the television film Chloé,[22][23] directed by Dennis Berry and opposite Anna Karina, with Cotillard starring as a teenage runaway who is forced into prostitution.[24]\n\nIn 1998, she appeared in Gérard Pirès' action comedy Taxi, playing Lilly Bertineau, the girlfriend of delivery boy Daniel, played by Samy Naceri.[1] The film was a box office hit in France with over 6 millions tickets sold,[25] and Cotillard was nominated for a César Award for Most Promising Actress.[26] She reprised the role in Taxi 2 (2000) and Taxi 3 (2003).[1][27]\n\nIn 1999, Cotillard ventured into science fiction with Alexandre Aja's post-apocalyptic romantic drama Furia.[1] That same year, she also starred in Francis Reusser's Swiss war drama film War in the Highlands (La Guerre dans le Haut Pays),[1] for which she won the Best Actress Award at the 1999 Autrans Mountain Film Festival.[28]\n\nIn 2001, she appeared in Pierre Grimblat's romantic war drama film Lisa, playing the title role and younger version of Jeanne Moreau's character, alongside Benoît Magimel and Sagamore Stévenin.[29] She also starred in Gilles Paquet-Brenner's drama film Pretty Things (Les Jolies Choses), adapted from the work of feminist writer Virginie Despentes, portraying twins of completely opposite characters, Lucie and Marie,[1] for which she earned a second César Award nomination for Most Promising Actress.[30] In 2002, Cotillard starred in Guillaume Nicloux's thriller A Private Affair (Une Affaire Privée), in which she portrayed the mysterious Clarisse.[1]\n\nCotillard started the transition into Hollywood when she obtained a supporting role in Tim Burton's 2003 fantasy comedy-drama film Big Fish, in which she played Joséphine, the French wife of Billy Crudup's character, William Bloom.[1] The production, her first English-language film,[13] allowed her to work with well-established actors such as Helena Bonham Carter, Albert Finney, Ewan McGregor, Jessica Lange and Allison Lohman.[1] Big Fish was a critical and commercial success,[31] and marked a turn in Cotillard's career,[9][12] who was unhappy with her career in France at the time for not getting good roles,[9] and considered taking some time off until she got the role in Big Fish.[9] She next starred in Yann Samuell's 2003 French romantic comedy film Love Me If You Dare (Jeux d'enfants), as Sophie Kowalsky, the daughter of Polish immigrants who lives in France and begins playing a game of dares with her childhood friend, portrayed by Guillaume Canet.[32] The film was a box office hit in France with over 1 million tickets sold.[33]\n\nIn 2004, she won the Chopard Trophy of Female Revelation at the Cannes Film Festival,[34] narrated the children's audio book Cinq Contes Musicaux Pour les Petits (\"Five Musical Tales For the Little Ones\") by Isabelle Aboulker,[35] and had supporting roles in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's A Very Long Engagement (Un Long Dimanche de Fiançailles), as the vengeful prostitute Tina Lombardi, a femme fatale[32] who goes on a killing spree to avenge her lover's death,[37] for which she won a César Award for Best Supporting Actress,[38] and in Lucile Hadžihalilović's mystery thriller Innocence as the ballet teacher Mademoiselle Éva;[1] both films were acclaimed by critics.[39][40]\n\nIn 2005, Cotillard starred in six films: Steve Suissa's Cavalcade, Abel Ferrara's Mary,[1] Richard Berry's The Black Box (La Boîte Noire); Rémi Bezançon's Love Is in the Air (Ma vie en l'air), Fabienne Godet's Burnt Out (Sauf le respect que je vous dois), and Stéphan Guérin-Tillié's Edy.[21] In May 2005, Cotillard portrayed Joan of Arc for the first time in the Orléans Symphonic Orchestra's production of Arthur Honegger's oratorio Joan of Arc at the Stake at the Palais des Sports d'Orléans, in Orléans, France.[41] She reprised the role several times when performing the oratorio in different countries in the following years.[42][43]\n\nIn 2006, the actress took on significant roles in four feature films, including Ridley Scott's romantic dramedy A Good Year, in which she had her major English-language role up to that point, Fanny Chenal, a French café owner in a small Provençal town, opposite Russell Crowe as a Londoner who inherits a local property.[1][32] She played Nadine in the Belgian comedy Dikkenek, alongside Mélanie Laurent, and the role of Nicole in Fair Play. She also played Léna in the satirical coming-of-age film Toi et moi, directed by Julie Lopes-Curval,[44] for which she learned how to play the cello for her role.[5][45]\n\nCotillard was chosen by director Olivier Dahan to star as French singer Édith Piaf in his biographical film La Vie en Rose before he had even met the actress, after he noticed a similarity between Piaf's and Cotillard's eyes.[46] It was dubbed \"the most awaited film of 2007\" in France, where some critics said Cotillard had reincarnated Édith Piaf to sing one last time on stage.[47] During the film's premiere at the 2007 Berlin International Film Festival, Cotillard was in attendance and received a 15-minute standing ovation.[48] Hollywood talent agent Hylda Queally signed Cotillard shortly after the premiere at the festival.[49] La Vie en Rose was a box office hit in France, with more than 5 million admissions,[50] and made US$86 million worldwide on a US$25 million budget.[51] Cotillard became the first actress to win a Golden Globe for a non-English language performance since 1972 (when Liv Ullmann won for The Emigrants), and also the first person ever to win a Golden Globe for a (Comedy or Musical) non-English language performance.[52] On 10 February 2008, Cotillard became the first French actress since Stéphane Audran in 1973 to be awarded the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.[53] At the Academy Awards, she won Best Actress, becoming the first woman and second person (after Adrien Brody in The Pianist six years earlier) to win both a César and an Oscar for the same performance.[54] Cotillard is the second French actress to win this award,[55] and the third overall to win an Oscar, after Simone Signoret in 1960 and Juliette Binoche in 1997.[56] She is the first Best Actress Oscar winner for a non-English language performance since Sophia Loren in 1961.[57] She is also the first and (as of 2024) only winner of an Academy Award for a French-language performance.[58] On 23 June 2008, Cotillard was one of 105 individuals invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[59]\n\nFollowing her Oscar win, Cotillard continued her Hollywood career and starred alongside Johnny Depp and Christian Bale in the role of Billie Frechette in Michael Mann's Public Enemies, released in the United States on 1 July 2009.[9] Later that year, she appeared in Rob Marshall's film adaptation of Nine, the musical based on the 1963 Federico Fellini film 8½.[6] As Luisa Contini, the wife of Guido (Daniel Day-Lewis), Cotillard performed two musical numbers: \"My Husband Makes Movies\"[60] and \"Take It All.\"[61] Time magazine ranked her performance in Nine as the fifth best female performance of 2009, behind Mo'Nique, Carey Mulligan, Saoirse Ronan and Meryl Streep.[62] She won the Desert Palm Achievement Actress Award at the 2010 Palm Springs International Film Festival – her second prize from the festival[63] – and was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy for her work in Nine.[64] Cotillard appeared on the cover of the November 2009 issue of Vogue with her Nine co-stars, and on the magazine's July 2010 cover by herself.[65][66]\n\nCotillard was the Honorary President of the 35th César Awards ceremony, held on 27 February 2010.[67] She played Mal Cobb, a projection of Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio)'s deceased wife, in Christopher Nolan's film Inception, released on 16 July 2010. Nolan described Mal as \"the essence of the femme fatale\", and DiCaprio praised Cotillard, saying \"she can be strong and vulnerable and hopeful and heartbreaking all in the same moment, which was perfect for all the contradictions of her character.\"[68] The film made US$825 million in worldwide box-office receipts, and Cotillard and DiCaprio's pairing in Inception ranked eighth on the Forbes list of \"Hollywood's Top Earning On-Screen Couples.\"[69] That same year, she also starred as Marie, an environmentalist, in Guillaume Canet's drama Little White Lies (Les petits mouchoirs).[21]\n\nIn 2011, Cotillard co-starred in Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris as Pablo Picasso's fictionalized mistress, Adriana, with whom Owen Wilson's character, Gil, falls in love. The film grossed $151 million worldwide on a $17 million budget.[70] That same year, she also appeared alongside Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow and Matt Damon in Steven Soderbergh's thriller Contagion;[71] and had the top rank on Le Figaro's 2011 list of the highest-paid French actors of 2010, the first time in nine years that a female had topped the list.[72] She also tied with Kate Winslet as the highest-paid foreign actress in Hollywood.[73] In 2012, Cotillard was ranked ninth on the list of the highest-paid French actresses in 2011,[74] and portrayed Miranda Tate (alongside her Public Enemies co-star Christian Bale) in Christopher Nolan's Batman feature The Dark Knight Rises.[75][76]\n\nCotillard next portrayed an orca trainer who loses her legs after a work accident in Jacques Audiard's romantic drama Rust and Bone (De rouille et d'os), costarring Matthias Schoenaerts.[77][78] The film premiered in the main competition at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival and received a 10-minute standing ovation at the end of its screening.[78][79] Cotillard received rave reviews for her performance,[80] and Cate Blanchett wrote an op-ed for Variety describing the film as \"simply astonishing\" and stating that \"Marion has created a character of nobility and candour, seamlessly melding herself into a world we could not have known without her. Her performance is as unexpected and as unsentimental and raw as the film itself.\"[81] She earned a fifth César Award nomination, a fourth Screen Actors Guild Award nomination, a third Golden Globe nomination (her first for Best Actress – Drama), and her second Critics' Choice Award and Lumières Award nominations. James Kaelan of MovieMaker magazine wrote that it was a travesty that Cotillard was not nominated for an Academy Award for Rust and Bone.[82] Cotillard also received several other honors and career tributes in 2012, at the Telluride Film Festival,[83] Hollywood Film Festival,[84] AFI Fest,[85] Gotham Awards,[86] and Harper's Bazaar Awards.[87]\n\nIn 2013, Cotillard was named Woman of the Year by Harvard's student society Hasty Pudding Theatricals,[88] and Le Figaro also ranked her the second highest-paid actress in France in 2012[89] and the seventh highest-paid actor overall.[90] In May 2013, she appeared with Gary Oldman, her co-star in The Dark Knight Rises, in the controversial music video for \"The Next Day\" by David Bowie.[91] Cotillard had her first leading role in an American movie in James Gray's The Immigrant as Polish-born Ewa Cybulska, who emigrates hoping to experience the American dream in 1920s New York. James Gray wrote the script especially for Cotillard after meeting her at a French restaurant with her boyfriend.[92][93] Cotillard had to learn 20 pages of Polish dialogue for her role,[94] and Gray stated that she is the best actor he's ever worked with.[95] Her performance was widely acclaimed,[96] and she was awarded the New York Film Critics Circle Award,[97][98] the National Society of Film Critics Award,[99] the Toronto Film Critics Association Award[100] and was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for Best Actress in 2015.[101] She starred in Guillaume Canet's Blood Ties in 2013 with Clive Owen, Billy Crudup and her Rust and Bone co-star Matthias Schoenaerts;[102] and had a cameo in Adam McKay's comedy film Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues,[103] acting opposite Jim Carrey in the battle scene between rival news teams.[104] In December 2013, Cotillard was a member of the 13th Marrakech Film Festival jury presided by Martin Scorsese.[105]\n\nIn 2014, she starred in the Dardenne brothers drama Two Days, One Night (Deux jours, une nuit),[106] as Sandra, a Belgian factory worker who has just one weekend to convince her co-workers to give up their bonuses so that she can keep her job. The film premiered in the main competition at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival and earned a 15-minute standing ovation,[107] with Cotillard's performance praised as \"a career-high performance\",[108] and favored to win the festival's Best Actress prize,[109][110][111][112][113] which ended up going to Julianne Moore for Maps to the Stars.[113] Several critics' awards followed, as well as a European Film Award for Best Actress, a second Academy Award nomination, making Cotillard the first actor to be nominated for a Belgian film,[114] and a sixth César Award nomination.[115][116] Her performances in both The Immigrant and Two Days, One Night shared the fourth spot on Time's list of Best Movie Performances of 2014.[117] In November 2014, Cotillard participated on Comedy Central's All-Star Non-Denominational Christmas Special, in a duet with Nathan Fielder on the Elvis Presley song \"Can't Help Falling in Love\".[118]\n\nIn 2015, Cotillard took on the role of Lady Macbeth in a film adaptation of William Shakespeare's play, directed by Justin Kurzel and starring Michael Fassbender in the title role.[119] The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival[120] and Cotillard's performance earned her a nomination for the British Independent Film Award for Best Actress,[121] and high praise from critics, particularly for her \"Out, Damned Spot\" monologue. Variety critic Guy Lodge remarked: \"Her deathless sleepwalking scene, staged in minimalist fashion under a gauze of snowflakes in a bare chapel, is played with tender, desolate exhaustion; it deserves to be viewed as near-definitive.\"[122] That same year, she starred in the New York Philharmonic's production of Arthur Honegger's oratorio Joan of Arc at the Stake,[123][124] and voiced the roles of The Rose in both the English and French versions of Mark Osborne's The Little Prince,[125] Scarlet Overkill in the French version of Minions;[126] and April, the title character in the French-Canadian-Belgian 3D animated film April and the Extraordinary World (Avril et le Monde Truqué).[127]\n\nIn 2016, Cotillard played Gabrielle, a free-spirited woman in a convenience marriage in Nicole Garcia's romantic drama From the Land of the Moon (Mal de Pierres), an adaptation of the bestselling Italian novel Mal di Pietre by Milena Agus, which marked her return to French cinema after 2012's Rust and Bone,[128] and earned her a seventh César Award nomination.[129] She also played the role of Catherine, the sister-in-law of a gay playwright (portrayed by Gaspard Ulliel), who returns home to tell his family that he is dying in Xavier Dolan's Canadian-French co-production It's Only the End of the World (Juste la fin du Monde).[130] Both films premiered in main competition at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival,[131] to polarized reactions from critics.[132][133] It's Only the End of the World was a box office hit in France with over 1 million tickets sold.[134] Also in 2016, Cotillard starred opposite Brad Pitt in Robert Zemeckis's Allied, a spy film set in World War II in which she played Marianne Beausejour, a French Resistance fighter.[130][135][136] While critical reviews were mixed, Stephanie Zacharek of Time magazine wrote that \"Pitt and Cotillard give sturdy, coded performances that feel naturalistic, not phony: They understand clearly that their chief mission is to tap the tradition of melodrama, and they take it seriously. Somehow, almost incomprehensibly, it all works. Allied looks old but smells new, and the scent is heady.\"[137] The film grossed US$120 million worldwide.[138] That same year, Cotillard reteamed with Macbeth director Justin Kurzel and co-star Michael Fassbender in the film adaptation of the video game Assassin's Creed.[139]\n\nOn 30 January 2017, Cotillard was honored with a special award for her career at the 22nd Lumières Awards in France.[140][141] In 2017, she also starred in Guillaume Canet's satire comedy Rock'n Roll, and in Arnaud Desplechin's drama Ismael's Ghosts (Les Fantomes d'Ismaël), alongside Mathieu Amalric, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Louis Garrel.[142] The Hollywood Reporter, in its review for the former film, asserted that \"Cotillard offers up such a sincere performance that you can't help but laugh\".[143]\n\nIn the 2018 drama Angel Face (Gueule d'ange) by director Vanessa Filho, she portrayed Marlene, a woman who suddenly chooses to abandon her daughter for a man she has just met during yet another night of excess.

Today, I'm halfway there. Since becoming a mother, I have put boundaries to protect my children\", she said.\n\nAs of 2024, Cotillard has appeared on more than 300 magazine covers around the world,[233] such as Vogue, Elle, Marie Claire, Variety, Harper's Bazaar, Vanity Fair, Madame Figaro, Glamour, W, Porter, The Hollywood Reporter and Wall Street Journal Magazine.[233][263] She was the first actress on a Vogue Paris September cover in five years with her September 2010 cover,[264] and was named \"Woman of the Decade\" by Vogue Paris on their list of the \"40 Women of The Decade\" in 2010.[265] In August 2012, Cotillard was featured in three major magazine covers: the American Vogue, Vogue Paris and Marie Claire UK.[266] She was also featured on the cover of the first issue of Dior Magazine in September 2012.[267]\n\nCotillard was named \"The Most Beautiful Face of 2013\" by The Independent Critics List of the 100 Most Beautiful Famous Faces From Around the World,[268] and ranked as one of the most \"Beautiful Famous Faces\" for 16 consecutive years.
