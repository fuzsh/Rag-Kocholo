        "text": "Hello, my name's Peter Meineck.\n\nI'm Professor of Classics in the Modern World\n\nat New York University,\n\nand today we're gonna be breaking down\n\nGreek and Roman mythology in TV and film.\n\nThis is a scene from the movie 300.\n\nSpartan!\n\n[melancholy music]\n\nYes, milady.\n\n[melancholy music]\n\nCome back with your shield,\n\nor on it.\n\nYes, milady.\n\nAh, the 300. Where to start?\n\nA compelling movie,\n\nand also a deeply problematical movie as well.\n\nThe famous phrase, right, Come back carrying your shield\n\nor laying on it, which seems pretty harsh thing\n\nfor your wife to tell you when you're about to go\n\nand fight a battle and you know you're not coming home.\n\nI think it's Pausanias who actually documents this.\n\nHe said that Spartan mothers actually said it to their sons,\n\nwhich is perhaps even harsher.\n\nIt's not only a Spartan sentiment.\n\nThe Athenians had a term of insult called a shield dropper.\n\nAnybody who dropped their shield in battle\n\nmeant that they were retreating from the hoplite phalanx.\n\nThe hoplite phalanx was that you would deploy your infantry,\n\nmaybe 6 to 9,000 of them,\n\nand you would carry a large round shield called a hoplite,\n\nwe see it in the movie,\n\nand that would cover half of your body,\n\nbut it would also cover half of the body\n\nof the man to your left.\n\nSo you were totally dependent on each other in battle.\n\nIf you dropped your shield,\n\nit meant that not only were you a coward\n\nbecause you were running away,\n\nbut you're also letting the line down.\n\n[Narrator] He doesn't say it.\n\n[wistful music]\n\nThere's no room for selfness, not in Sparta.\n\nNo place for weakness.\n\nOnly the hard and strong may call themselves Spartans.\n\nOnly the hard, only the strong.\n\nI think what's so interesting about Spartan culture\n\nis we are fascinated with it, right,\n\nbecause it seems to promote this idea\n\nof kind of male toughness.\n\nBut actually that's a little bit of a very repressive state\n\nto live in where everything is about the army.\n\nAt the time this happens in Spartan history,\n\nthe 7th-6th century BC,\n\nall Spartan art stops, all Spartan poetry stops,\n\nand we just have this Spartan military.\n\nSpartan culture itself died out\n\n'cause they simply didn't produce enough children.\n\nEven though you were married, you stayed living in barracks\n\nuntil you were 30 years old.\n\nMen and women were pretty separate in that society.\n\nTheir marriage system just did not work.\n\nAnd also they were a very, very exclusive society.\n\nYou could only be a Spartan if you were born\n\nin the five villages of Sparta.\n\nBy the fourth century, Sparta was spent as a power.\n\nSo, you know, historically, Sparta's system\n\nwas not successful at all,\n\nso it's probably not something we should emulate.\n\nI mean, I was so shocked to see people on January the 6th\n\nattacking the Capitol dressing up as Spartans\n\nand running around.\n\nAnd, you know, you should think about, right,\n\nis that this was perhaps the greatest gay army\n\nthat's ever been on the planet.\n\nFamously bisexual, as many people were in Antiquity.\n\nThey had very different ideas about sexuality.\n\nThey lived together as men in messes,\n\nand Spartans were very much into each other.\n\nGreat bisexual army in many ways.\n\nThat's another way that they've been sort of misinterpreted\n\nthat somehow they convey this kind of idea\n\nof, you know, certain masculinity.\n\nThat is not attested at all in the ancient sources.\n\nBut having said that,\n\nI think they get certain things right, okay?\n\nThere's no doubt Spartan warriors or Greek warriors\n\nwere very interested in physical fitness.\n\nThey were very interested in the male body.\n\nThey were often depicted nude in Greek art.\n\nAnd the women too had to undergo physical exercise\n\nin order to give strong babies for the Spartan army.\n\nThey did wear red cloaks\n\nas a way to kind of soak up the blood on the battlefield,\n\nbut also to designate themselves that they were Spartans.\n\nAnd it was considered manly to have a very long beard.\n\nOne of the things I really don't like about this movie,\n\nthe 300, is the way that the Persians are presented.\n\nThey're almost non-human, twisted and as kind of vile,\n\nand to me it's really quite racist actually\n\nand it's kind of promoting white supremacy\n\nversus this horrible kind of invasion of brown people.\n\nAnd it's completely inaccurate.\n\nI mean, one of the things about the Persian Empire\n\nthat even the Greeks tell is how multiethnic it was\n\nand how it had people from all over the world in their army.\n\nAnd the battle tactics of the great king\n\nwas he would literally turn up with his million-man army\n\nand you just surrendered, right,\n\nbecause how could you possibly take an army like that on.\n\nBut you don't see these kind of racist\n\nand xenophobic attitudes in the Greek texts.\n\nIf Aeschylus who fought at the Battle of Marathon\n\nand lost a brother there, he was a playwright\n\nand he also served in the military,\n\nhe actually wrote a play called The Persians\n\nand we actually feel sympathy for the Persians\n\nin their defeat and we feel their pain\n\nand we feel the losses that's happened to them.\n\nAnd I think this is the thing\n\nthat really makes me uncomfortable about this film.\n\nThere is such a road, good king,\n\njust past that western ridge.\n\nIt's an old goat path.\n\nThe Persians could use it to outflank us.\n\nNot one step closer, monster.\n\nThere actually is accounts of a character like that\n\nand a kind of rejected Spartan character\n\nwho does actually go over to the enemy.\n\nHe's certainly nowhere near as deformed as this character.\n\nAnd again, that's also kind of very problematic, right?\n\nThere's a connection between physical perfection,\n\nbeauty, and loyalty and truth.\n\nBecause this character doesn't fit that ideal,\n\nhe has to be deceitful.\n\nThis is actually the opposite\n\nof what you find in Greek mythology.\n\nCharacters like that are often given a second sight.\n\nOne can think of Tiresias who has lived\n\nas both a man and a woman, and who is blind.\n\nCharacters like Oedipus who is depicted\n\nas having a leg deformity.\n\nCharacters who we would label perhaps as disabled\n\nwho actually are seen as having great high status\n\nin Greek society.\n\nSo again, this is something that the movie,\n\nI think, gets very wrong.\n\nThis next clip is from the Clash of the Titans.\n\n[dramatic music]\n\n[Draco grunting] [rock crashing]\n\n[Medusa screaming]\n\n[dramatic music]\n\n[Perseus grunting]\n\n[Medusa thudding]\n\n[snakes hissing]\n\nThis is a very powerful myth to the ancient Greeks,\n\nwhich is the myth of Medusa,\n\nthe Gorgon who could turn you to stone.\n\nAnd Perseus here, one of his kind of rights as passage,\n\nhis sort of step into manhood,\n\nis to go and bring back the head of Medusa\n\nand get rid of this horrible chthonic symbol.\n\nWhat I mean by chthonic is a symbol of the earth.\n\nSo the Greeks sort of divided up their universe\n\nin terms of Olympian, which was the sky\n\nwhich is predominantly controlled by Zeus and male gods,\n\nand the earth, which is predominantly female,\n\nGaia, Hera, Rhea.\n\nAnd one of the clues to that is whenever we see snakes\n\nwe're dealing with a chthonic image,\n\nand we see that in the hairstyle of Medusa, right,\n\nwho's got these chthonic images of the snake.\n\nAnd why did the Greeks regard the snakes as chthonic?\n\nBecause I think if you go to Greece and you see a snake,\n\nright, they seem to come out of the earth\n\nand disappeared back into the earth.\n\nThey're pretty scary snakes, as well,\n\nso that image is very much still with us today.\n\nIf any of you ever go into a medical facility\n\nor ride an ambulance,\n\nyou'll see a snake wrapped around a staff, right,\n\nand that is literally the chthonic symbol of death,\n\nthe snake being lifted up off the ground, off the earth.\n\nOften these are myths of gender wars\n\nbetween male and female figures.\n\nAnd so here's Perseus, right?\n\nHe's, you know, 17, 18 years old.\n\nIn becoming a man, he has to go and literally\n\nkind of sever himself off from the world of women.\n\nSo this is very much a story\n\nof a young warrior's rite of passage.\n\nThe lead-back mirror that we're used to seeing today\n\nwas not invented until maybe the 15th century in Europe,\n\nso they never saw true reflections of themselves.\n\nThey had to look at themselves in polished surfaces,\n\nbronze shields, maybe in the water.\n\nSo the shield, this culminating moment of him\n\nlooking in the mirror back at Medusa is also, I think,\n\na kind of musing on this idea of identity, right?\n\nDo you really know who you are?\n\nAnd that enables him to have the power\n\nto deliver the fatal blow and sever the head.\n\nWe get a lot of these stories of young men\n\nhaving to kind of conquer their sexuality.\n\nSo the idea that a beautiful woman can petrify you\n\nobviously has sexual connotations,\n\nand you've got to kind of defeat that\n\nby not actually looking at it\n\nand focusing on what your mission is\n\nin order to sort of conquer your sexuality\n\nand resist the charms of women.\n\nThat's definitely something that we find\n\nin a lot of Greek mythology,\n\nand that may be playing into the Medusa myth as well.\n\nThis scene is from the movie Black Panther.\n\n[N'Jobu] Millions of years ago,\n\na meteorite made of vibranium,\n\nthe strongest substance in the universe,\n\nstruck the continent of Africa,\n\naffecting the plant life around it.\n\nAnd when the time of men came, five tribes settled on it\n\nand called it Wakanda.\n\nThe first thing to say is that the Mediterranean world\n\ndoesn't exist in isolation,\n\nand one of the things that has happened is that Greek\n\nand Roman mythology has somehow been disconnected\n\nmainly in the 19th century by Europeans\n\nand, you know, to a certain extent whitewashed, right,\n\ntaken away from its Mediterranean roots.\n\nAnd, you know, half of the Mediterranean is Africa, right,\n\nand we forget that.\n\nAnd the Greeks had a very different attitude to Africa,\n\nand that was they saw Ethiopia, Egypt, Kush, Kerma\n\nas very ancient and very advanced cultures\n\nand civilizations, and we see this reflected\n\nhere in Black Panther.\n\nSo for example, in Book I of The Iliad,\n\nthe gods are not on Olympus.\n\nThey've actually gone to the only humans\n\nwho they deign worthy of their company to dine with,\n\nand that is the Ethiopians.\n\nAnd then secondly, a lot of what we call Greek mythology\n\nare heavily influenced by stories from Africa\n\nvia Egypt and Kush.\n\nI don't think there would be Greek and Roman mythology\n\nwithout these ancient African stories.\n\n[N'Jobu] The tribes lived in constant war\n\nwith each other until a warrior shaman received a vision\n\nfrom the panther goddess Bast\n\nwho led him to the heart-shaped herb,\n\na plant that granted him superhuman strength,\n\nspeed, and instincts.\n\nThe warrior became king and the first Black Panther,\n\nthe protector of Wakanda.\n\nSo the idea of the panther god and then having a mortal\n\nwho becomes the panther at certain moments\n\nto protect his community relates directly,\n\nif you think about it, to Heracles, right?\n\n'Cause Heracles is a lion warrior, I should say.\n\nAnd we call this therianthropy\n\nwhere a human transforms into an animal\n\nto do something superhuman,\n\nand you tap into the power of that animal\n\nin order to protect your community.\n\nSo we should place Heracles\n\nvery much in the same world as that.\n\n[N'Jobu] The Wakandans used vibranium\n\nto develop technology more advanced than any other nation.\n\nBut as Wakanda thrived,\n\nthe world around it descended further into chaos.\n\n[bombs exploding]\n\n[planes roaring]\n\nTo keep vibranium safe,\n\nthe Wakandans vowed to hide in plain sight,\n\nkeeping the truth of their power from the outside world.\n\nOne thing I love about this movie\n\nis this idea that Wakanda's hidden.\n\nYou've got this incredibly developed ancient culture,\n\nand a lot of people responded to that with this movie\n\nbecause that is the truth.\n\nJust like Wakanda is hidden, so much of African mythology\n\nand ancient history has been hidden to us.\n\nBecause what's happened is that through enslavement\n\nand colonization, we have a view of the continent of Africa\n\nthat is completely false,\n\nparticularly its history and its rich culture.\n\nWe can't just look at the Greeks and Romans in isolation.\n\nThey are people of the Mediterranean.\n\nThey trade, speak to, interrelate with the Africans,\n\nas the Africans do with them.\n\nSo we have to question why we even call this stuff\n\njust Greek and Roman mythology.\n\nIt's got much wider connotations\n\nacross the networks of that entire region.\n\n[earth whooshing]\n\n[serene music]\n\nIn the movie, there's this idea of the Astral Plane,\n\nwhich is that you can communicate with your ancestors.\n\nYour ancestors are gonna give you the wisdom you need\n\nto pursue through your life,\n\nparticularly at times of trouble.\n\n[T'Challa and T'Chaka chuckling]\n\nPapa.\n\nAnd, you know, ancestor worship is an enormous part\n\nof both Greek and Roman culture.\n\nThe old had very high status in ancient societies\n\nbecause they were the fount of knowledge.\n\nThe Romans actually would take death masks\n\nof their ancestors, clay versions of them,\n\nand then at certain festivals\n\nthey would wear the mask of their ancestors\n\nand they would parade through the streets in them.\n\nGood morning. How can I help you?\n\nI'm just checking out these artifacts.\n\nThey tell me you're the expert.\n\nAh, you could say that.\n\nWhere's this one from?\n\nThe Bobo Ashanti tribe, present day Ghana, 19th century.\n\nTo take that mask and put it in a glass case in a museum\n\nis the worst thing you can do to that mask.\n\nThat mask's supposed to be worn by a performer\n\nwho's been imbued in a whole culture of dancing\n\nand performing and telling those stories over centuries.\n\nAnd now it's become like an aesthetic object\n\nwith a price on it,\n\nand I think this movie actually shows that really well.\n\nNow, tell me about this one.\n\nAlso from Benin, seventh century, Fula tribe, I believe.\n\nNo.\n\nI beg your pardon.\n\nIt was taken by British soldiers in Benin,\n\nbut it's from Wakanda and it's made out of vibranium.\n\nDon't trip, I'm gonna take it off your hands for you.\n\nThese items aren't for sale.\n\nHow do you think your ancestors got these?\n\nYou think they paid a fair price?\n\nOr did they take it, like they took everything else?\n\nHere's a character from that culture\n\nwho's not really allowed to interface\n\nwith material from his own culture\n\nand is actually being schooled on it\n\nby somebody who's not from that culture.\n\nIt's about access, right?\n\nAnd I think one of the things this does\n\nis it shows us how if you remove an object\n\nfrom the stories that are told about it\n\nand the way it's performed,\n\nis that object still operating the same way?\n\nI love it that he takes a mask at the end,\n\nand that becomes his character.\n\nAnd even though he uses it in a negative way,\n\nfor him it empowers him\n\nand that's his connection with his ancestors.\n\nYou know, I think often we see these objects in museums,\n\nbut we don't think about them\n\nin their real cultural context.\n\nBlack Panther movie makes people think about that.\n\nThe next clip is from the movie O Brother, Where Art Thou?\n\n[leaves rustling] [water bubbling]\n\n♪ Go to sleep you little baby ♪\n\n♪ Go to sleep you little baby ♪\n\n♪ Your momma's gone away and your daddy's gone to stay ♪\n\n♪ Didn't leave nobody but the baby ♪\n\n♪ Go to sleep ♪\n\nHow'd you do, ladies?\n\nName of Pete.\n\nIn many ways, it's an American Odyssey,\n\nalthough I remember the Cohen brothers said\n\nthey never read The Odyssey and they weren't aware of it.\n\nYou know, maybe there's an argument\n\nthat some of these stories\n\nentered our collective unconsciousness.\n\nMany people who've never read The Odyssey\n\nknow the story of the sirens.\n\nIt's one of the tasks that Odysseus faces on his way home.\n\nHe's told not to listen to the sirens,\n\nand yet he's compelled to listen to them,\n\nso he tells his crew members to tie him to the mast,\n\nand they've all got to put wax in their ears.\n\nIn The Odyssey, the sirens' song\n\nis actually offering fame.\n\nYou know, we'll sing about you, will sing your stories.\n\nSo it's less sexual, I think, in The Odyssey\n\nand more about kind of the fame of the hero\n\nand the identity of the hero.\n\n♪ Go to sleep you little baby ♪\n\n♪ Your momma's gone away and your daddy's gone to stay ♪\n\nSo you get that story of the sirens,\n\nbut also the story of the lotus-eaters.\n\nThey're offered corn alcohol,\n\nand, you know, there's a sense\n\nthat they're gonna be given oblivion.\n\nAnd that's another story in The Odyssey.\n\nThe crew land on the land of the lotus-eaters,\n\nand if they eat the lotus, they forget.\n\nThis is often what a lot of returning warriors do\n\ncoming home from war is they want to obliterate\n\ntheir traumatic memories,\n\nany substance that could kind of blot out the pain.\n\nSo I think that there's the number of references\n\ngoing on here.\n\nAnd then finally the kind of sort of medieval trope\n\nof, you know, being turned into a toad.\n\nI think America of the Great Depression,\n\nit's hard for us now to understand\n\nwhat a cataclysmic event World War I was,\n\nthis idea of kind of total industrialized war\n\nas a global event,\n\nand then the knock-on effect that that war caused.\n\nThat is analogous to perhaps the Trojan War,\n\nwhich in Greek mythology is the biggest war\n\nthe Greeks ever fought.\n\nAnd you do get the sense in They Odyssey\n\nof a new society being rebuilt,\n\nthat Odysseus cannot come home\n\nand just be an aristocrat anymore.\n\nHis success is dependent on Eumaeus the swineherd,\n\nit is dependent on his wife, Penelope,\n\non his father, on his son.\n\nHe's no longer the singular aristocratic hero.\n\nSo yeah, you definitely get the sense\n\nof a changing, uncertain world in The Odyssey\n\nthat's reflected in this time period.\n\nI almost prefer to see myths pop up\n\nin something more contemporary\n\nbecause you're absorbed by the actual story\n\nthat's being told and by the actors,\n\nand then you go, Oh wow, that's the sirens, right?\n\nBut it doesn't kind of pull you away from the story.\n\nThis is how myth works,\n\nso I would argue that this is an example of mythic material\n\nactually working and being compelling\n\nand helping to tell a new story.\n\nThis scene is from the movie Wonder Woman.\n\n[Hippolyta] Long ago when time was new,\n\nthe gods ruled the earth, Zeus king among them.\n\n[dramatic music]\n\nZeus created beings over which the gods would rule,\n\nbeings born in his image.\n\nHe called his creation man.\n\nThere's some fun going on in this story.\n\nNowhere in Greek mythology does Zeus have anything to do\n\nwith the creation of humanity.\n\nIn fact, the gods really don't have anything to do\n\nwith the creation of humanity, only the first woman.\n\nWe hear that the titan Prometheus,\n\nwhose name means forward thinker,\n\ncreates Pandora, the first woman, out of clay.\n\nAnd the reason we're told Pandora is created\n\nis to basically be a distraction to mankind\n\nbecause Prometheus has just given them fire\n\nand this starts to make mankind godlike.\n\nSo we're told in these quite misogynistic myths\n\nthat in order to distract mankind,\n\nthey invent women to sort of take them\n\nin a different direction.\n\nBut that's the only myth we get about the origins\n\nof any kind of human.\n\n[Hippolyta] But Zeus's son grew envious of mankind\n\nand sought to corrupt his father's creation.\n\nThis was Ares, the god of war.\n\nAres in this is really kind of beefed up\n\nto be an equal with Zeus.\n\nThe Greeks actually didn't call Ares the god of war.\n\nThey called him the god of violence,\n\nwhich I think is quite a profound way\n\nto think about a god who's associated with warfare.\n\nThe Greeks saw Ares as a negative force,\n\nso they get that right.\n\nBut Ares is portrayed in Greek art\n\nand mythology as a coward.\n\nHe kind of gets beaten up by heroes on the battlefield.\n\nIn Homer, he goes running to his dad asking for help.\n\nSo the kind of idea that Ares could overthrow Zeus\n\nis certainly nothing that an ancient Greek would understand.\n\n[Hippolyta] The gods created us, the Amazons,\n\nto influence men's hearts with love\n\nand restore peace to the earth.\n\nI think this idea about Amazons bringing peace and harmony\n\ntowards men is quite a modern idea,\n\nand maybe it's more bound up\n\nwith modern ideas about gender, right,\n\nthat this is what women are supposed to provide\n\nin particular societies when men are the warriors.\n\nSo actually, it's the opposite.\n\nThey're very, very warlike.\n\nThey don't want men around.\n\nThey were certainly not about peace.\n\nYou know, there were women warriors,\n\nparticularly in the Steppes region\n\nand in what the Greeks called Thrace to the north.\n\nWe've definitely found graves with women warriors.\n\nThere was women warriors in the Celtic.\n\nIf anything like the Amazons actually existed,\n\nthey would have probably been nomadic tribes,\n\nhighly skilled, particularly with the bow and arrow.\n\nThe Amazons were viewed in antiquity\n\nof living around the Black Sea coast,\n\neither south of the Black Sea or north of the Black Sea,\n\nsometimes in Ethiopia, in Africa, sometimes in Libya.\n\nNever on an island.\n\nBut I actually think that there is some validity\n\nin doing that in terms of ancient mythology.\n\nThe idea of mystical islands\n\nand strange things happening on islands\n\nis something we encounter in The Odyssey in Homer.\n\nIt's a fun idea, and it's a good device for the movie.\n\nWe give thanks to the gods for giving us this paradise.\n\n[Diana] And the God Killer?\n\nThe God Killer?\n\nThe weapon that's strong enough to kill a god.\n\nThe thing that makes me laugh is the whole idea\n\nof the God Killer, 'cause you actually can't kill a god.\n\nThe whole purpose that Greek gods exists\n\nis that they are immortal.\n\nSo Wonder Woman, of course, you know,\n\nI think she's very much influenced\n\nby the Amazon queen Hippolyta\n\nwho are associated with Greek heroes\n\nlike Hercules and Theseus,\n\nand I think that they absolutely tapped in\n\nto that idea of the warrior woman.\n\nI think what's interesting about this particular scene\n\nis it kind of gets to the heart of what mythology is.\n\nYou know, the young Wonder Woman has her mother\n\ntelling her this origin story,\n\nand we as an audience also receive\n\nthat origin story performed.\n\nMyth is what we call an etiology.\n\nIt's there to explain why something is the way it is.\n\nAnd I think that's what makes myths so fascinating\n\nis we can actually analyze them and say,\n\nWell, why are these stories being told?\n\nAnd what are they communicating?\n\nThat story is really about us today.\n\nIt was less about the ancient Greeks\n\nand more about perhaps what's going on in our world,\n\nand I think that that's what made that first movie\n\nquite successful actually.\n\nThe next clip is from Hercules.\n\nHercules! [Hercules cooing]\n\n[chuckling] Behave yourself.\n\n[Hercules giggling]\n\nOh, look at this.\n\nLook how cute he is.\n\nHey! [ticking]\n\n[Hercules laughing]\n\nHa! The boy is strong, like his dad.\n\nThe movie is aiming at kids,\n\nand so it kind of elides over\n\nsome of the most interesting parts of the Heracles myth.\n\nThe Greek name for him, Heracles, means famous of Hera,\n\nand not in a good way,\n\nis Hera, the wife of Zeus, hates Heracles\n\nand is constantly trying to destroy him.\n\nDear, keep those away from the baby.\n\nOh, he won't hurt himself.\n\nAs a baby, that scene would never have happened.\n\nHeracles would never been welcomed to Olympus as a child.\n\nIn fact, Hera sent snakes to kill the infant Heracles,\n\nbut Heracles was already really strong\n\nand wrestled the snakes and killed them.\n\nWhat about our gift, dear?\n\nHmm, yes.\n\nA little cirrus and, hmm, a touch of nimbostratus.\n\n[Hercules cooing]\n\nHis name is Pegasus, and he's all yours, son.\n\nHeracles and Pegasus are not really connected\n\nin any of the Greek mythic material.\n\nPegasus appears in the Perseus myth\n\nand other myths related to the house of Perseus.\n\nAnd even though Heracles is from that region,\n\nwe don't see him associated with Pegasus.\n\nSo that's something that the movie brought in.\n\n[bell dinging]\n\nPain, Panic, got a little riddle for ya.\n\nHow do you kill a god?\n\nI do not know.\n\nYou can't. They're immortal.\n\nBingo, they're immortal.\n\nSo first you gotta turn the little sunspot mortal.\n\nThe other thing is that Hercules doesn't really have\n\nthis kind of hate relationship with Hades,\n\nexcept you could argue that the movie\n\nis riffing on this idea of,\n\ncan a mortal-born character become immortal?\n\nAnd Heracles is one of the only mortal characters\n\nwho becomes a god.\n\nNow Hades was actually called the unseen one,\n\nand we have very few depictions of him,\n\nso he was sort of seen as being somewhat invisible\n\nor somebody that you didn't want to see.\n\nBut we certainly don't associate Hades\n\nwith necessarily being a hot place.\n\nI mean, that's kind of an image of Hell.\n\nThe Greeks believed that there were certain entrance points\n\nto the underworld\n\nand there were these kind of underground rivers\n\nthat you had to have Charon the ferryman\n\ntransport you across.\n\nYou were buried with money so you could pay the ferryman\n\nfor that journey.\n\nIf you weren't buried, of course,\n\nyou wandered the shores of the river Styx\n\nnever getting across.\n\nI actually visited a number of these sites\n\nthat are associated with being the entrance\n\nto the underworld, and they're actually really compelling.\n\nPretty scary stuff.\n\nSo I think they did a pretty good job\n\nencapsulating that, actually.\n\nI resist something that we call the fidelity discourse\n\nthat there is an original version\n\nand that we must be true to that version.\n\nThat kills the life that's behind a myth.\n\nA myth is about performance, is about being spoken,\n\ntold, enacted, and received by an audience.\n\nThat's what it means to be human,\n\nto share our stories with each other.\n\nWe want novelty, we want something new.\n\nAnd also culture changes and culture gets influenced\n\nby different cultures, so the stories are changed too.\n\nSo to say that there's an original version of a story\n\nis actually to go against the very idea of mythos, right,\n\nwhich is a traditional story, a story that's handed down.\n\nI'm Peter Meineck, Professor of Classics in the Modern World\n\nat New York University.\n\nThanks for watching.\n\n[upbeat music]"
