The Fly Emirates sponsor remains, and is also colured redcurrant along with the Nike badge.\r\nTo launch the Gunners' new football shirt, Nike have produced some great imagery which reinforces their 'Write The Future' message through the stars of Arsenal. The imagery displays the passion, energy, drama and emotions endured by a player over the 90 minutes, highlighting how one moment in a players performance can change the game and 'Write The Future'. The reverse of the club badge on shirts reveals the motto  Victoria\r\nConcordia Crescit', which translates as  Victory Through Harmony',\r\nwhile redcurrant shorts and yellow socks complete the look.\r\nCombining traditional elements with new age technology, Nike have made every shirt entirely from recycled polyester, each crafted from up to eight\r\nplastic water bottles as part of Nike's  Considered Design' programme.\r\nThe improved Nike Dri-Fit fabric, now 13% lighter than previous kits,\r\nhelps to quickly evaporate moisture by drawing through the fabric to\r\nthe surface and keep players dry.Nike's  Considered Design' programme, aims to create performance\r\nproducts that minimise environmental impact by reducing waste during\r\nthe design and development process, use environmentally preferred\r\nmaterials, and eliminate toxics. To make the kits, Nike uses discarded\r\nwater bottles destined for landfill sites in Japan and Taiwan, where\r\nthey can take up to 500 years to decompose. The bottles are placed in a large washing machine to clean them and get\r\nrid of labels before they are chopped into tiny flakes and melted down\r\ninto a yarn that is ultimately spun to make the fabric for the jerseys\r\nand shorts. Use of recycled polyester across its new range of club kits\r\nmeans Nike has saved nearly 13 million plastic water bottles, a total\r\nof around 254,000 kg of polyester waste - enough to cover more than 29\r\nfootball pitches, and to stretch over 3,000 kilometres if laid out\r\nend-to-end!As football boot fans, it didn't escape the SoccerBible's attention that both Nike players Andrei Arshavin and Alexandre Song are wearing brand new colourways. An exciting glimpse into the Nike football boots we can expect to see, after the current World Cup and Elite colourways. And with green football boots proving popular with Nike fans, we can expect a strong response from Vapor and CTR360 fans, so stay tuned to the SoccerBible for more info and an exclusive look at the new Nike football boots.",
