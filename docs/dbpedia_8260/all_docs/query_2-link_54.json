        "text": "Ex-Barcelona Dani Alves has revealed the club his Nou Camp team-mates loved playing against - and if you're an Arsenal fan look away now.\n\nThe defender said they loved playing the Gunners, because they 'dominated' them whenever they faced each other.\n\nBarcelona have a rich history in the Champions League when it comes to playing Arsene Wenger's men, and the forth-right Alves told FourFourTwo: \"Well we definitely liked to face Arsenal.\n\n\"They had a similar style of football to ours, and this sometimes helped to facilitate our way of playing. We were drawn against them several times (2009/10, 2010/11 and 2015/16) with a positive outcome.\"\n\nHe added: \"They were a team we dominated and had control over. Every time we faced Arsenal in the Champions League, we'd have a good result or a good performance.\"\n\nThe run started when Barca beat the Gunners in the 2006 final in Paris thanks to late goals from Juliano Belletti and Samuel Eto'o.\n\nArsenal then went on to lose a tasty quarter final tie in the 2009-10 season when a 22-year-old Lionel Messi produced a masterclass at the Nou Camp, scoring four goals and leading Barca to a 6-3 (aggregate) triumph.\n\nArsenal faced the Catalan giants a year later but this time in the last 16, where the score was a little tighter over two legs but another wonderful Messi performance was enough to squeeze Barca through 4-3 on aggregate.\n\nThe North London side's Champions League woes against Barca continued in the 2015/16 season when they were matched up once again in the round-of-16 stage, but goals from Messi, Suarez and Neymar over two legs were enough to dispatch a disgruntled Arsenal side 5-1.\n\nAlves has since moved on from Catalonia, having played for Juventus for a season before joining PSG last summer for free on a two-year contract.\n\nThe Brazilian, along with Messi, Andres Iniesta, Gerard Pique, Xavi, Pedro and Sergio Busquets, won two historic trebles with Barcelona"
