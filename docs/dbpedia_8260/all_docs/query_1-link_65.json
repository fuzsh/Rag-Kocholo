        "text": "It's taken some time, but I finally feel comfortable enough with the latest game to start a save with my beloved Arsenal side. Last year my FM10 save ran up to the end of the 2029/30 season, and if I can emulate the success and longevity of that game I will be most pleased. Hopefully I'll be updating this fairly regularly, but as it's not the only save I have running I can't promise anything!\n\nOn to business then, and before the opening game at Anfield I've been a little busier in the transfer market than I had expected. Thanks to my spending and inability to shift the loanees immediately, the budget for the season has all but gone so we're stuck with what we have. I've picked out a few of the signings for you to have a closer look at:\n\nHugo Lloris: As any Arsenal fan knows, we have never really replaced David Seaman. Jens Lehmann did a good job for a couple of years, but neither Almunia nor Fabianksi have the consistency to hold down the starting spot between the posts. As such this was my priority signings, but a top class goalkeeper comes with a top price, and I had to fight to get my man. Fortunately, Lyon rejecting my offers did not go down well with the man I'd been praising since day one, and he demanded to leave! £11m, and we should have the number one spot held down for a decade.\n\nVaclav Kadlec: I was alerted to Vaclav's availability by his agent within days of taking the post, and I was amazed that nobody else challenged my bid. Quick, creative and with an eye for goal, he could probably do a job for many Premier League teams at the age of 18. I'll be taking it slowly, but I have little doubt that he'll become a big player for this club.\n\nThorgan Hazard: Older brother Eden may be the target of Europe's top teams, but young Thorgan has the potential to be as good if not better. With his creativity and eye for a pass he will make an excellent attacking midfielder, even if for now he will have to make do with a limited role from the bench and in the cups.\n\nThe other signings are all promising youngsters who will play predominantly in the Carling Cup, with loan moves a possibility in January. Leaving the club, the big name is Tomas Rosicky, whose contract was due to expire in a year and who plays in a position which is arguably our strongest, and the rest I am forced to loan out after failing to find a buyer. Only Squillaci goes with a buy-out clause which is disappointing, but hopefully the first team football will encourage other sides to make bids when the loans expire.\n\nOn the tactical front, I will be employing a 4-3-3 formation which is slightly different to my usual, narrower 4-2-3-1. The idea is to create chances with a quick passing game, Fabregas supplying the wings from the centre whilst Alex Song holds the fort, mopping up any loose balls in midfield and breaking up opposition attacks. Jack Wilshere is the man charged with the third, box-to-box midfield position, but this is the aspect of my tactic which I will experimenting with.\n\nThe aims for the season, which I'm hoping will lay the foundations for a long and successful career, and not too demanding this time round. The board expect European qualification in the league, a semi-final appearance in the FA Cup and a run to the last eight in the Champions League. With the Carling Cup not deemed important, I will be using that to blood the youngsters (opposition allowing), but the priority for this year is simple - without any silverware since the 2005 FA Cup, we need a trophy. Unless we can definitely afford to, there will be no resting of players or unnecessary squad rotation. Just the strongest team for every game, all-out for titles.\n\nOff we go!\n\nSeason 2010-11 - Midseason Update\n\nLeague: It's been going well so far, meeting the board's target of European qualification by sitting 2nd in the table at the halfway stage in the season. We actually topped the table for some time before suffering our first defeat of the season, and since then Chelsea have been untouchable at the top. It was the champions who dealt us one of our two defeats so far, a 3-2 reverse at Stamford Bridge, and the other one came at the hands of my all-time FM nemesis. Every year he scores against my teams, and yet in real life he can't get a game in a team with no strikers. See if you can guess who. On the other hand, our fans have enjoyed some great victories, including a great comeback against Manchester United at home, a comfortable 2-0 in the North London derby at White Hart Lane, and this utter domination of Stoke. That kind of control at home has been a regular occurence, with most of our points dropped on our travels.\n\nCups: In the Carling Cup I've been putting out a second team featuring most of my young signings, and although they were forced to extra time in the last two rounds they've played well. Bendtner in particular is playing for his future in the competition - with Chamakh fulfilling the role of the more physical striker, Kadlec showing potential and pre-arranged signing Wellington Silva on the way, he needs to impress. The FA Cup starts in January, and we will start away at League One Carlisle, which should provide another chance for the younger players to show what they can do.\n\nEurope: We also progressed comfortably in the Champions League, a 2-2 draw in the Olimpico the only blemish in a comfortable group win. Our 20 goals puts us through to the knockout rounds where we will have to deal with the harsh Russian winter as we face Zenit. I would have preferred Rangers, who we dealt with easily in a pre-season friendly, but considering we could have drawn Bayern or Real we'll take our chances.\n\nOn the playing front I've been particularly impressed with my tactic, as for the first time in an Arsenal save I've managed to get something like the best out of Cesc Fabregas. He's been superb, scoring and creating from his playmaking role in the centre of midfield. Marouane Chamakh has performed better than expected in the lone striker role, which has been essential to our performances given the occurence of the inevitable - a serious injury to Robin van Persie. However, the surprise of the season so far has been the performance of young Jay Emmanuel-Thomas. Not expected to feature before the start of the season, he has filled in capably in the holding role, the box-to-box role and even on the left wing, performing above his attributes and proving himself a capable backup.\n\nWith a healthy war chest available should the right player become available, we are in a strong position for the second half of the season - 2nd in the league and with a cup semi-final to come, that long awaited silverware could yet find itself in the Emirates trophy cabinet.\n\nThanks for reading and commenting Deisler\n\nCarling Cup Final Update\n\nWith the end of February comes the first major silverware of the season in England, and this season it could not have been a bigger game - following Arsenal's epic 6-4 aggregate win over Bolton and Chelsea's 5-2 defeat of Nottingham Forest in the semi finals, the top two in the country would face off at Wembley for more than local bragging rights. For Chelsea, this was an opportunity for them to justify their position at the top of the Barclays Premier League. For the Gunners, a chance to pick up their first silverware since 2005.\n\nWith Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti playing his first choice team throughout the competition, there was never any doubt about the strength of the Blues line-up. However, Arsenal boss Dillon had a decision to make - to stick with the youngsters that had made it this far, or send out the first team in the hope of sealing that all elusive trophy? In the end, the young manager stuck to his guns, making a number of changes and picking a young team featuring only three recognised first team players in Song, Wilshere and Walcott. For the young Gunners, it was time to prove their senior credentials.\n\nOn the field, the game sprung to life almost immediately. From the kick-off, Emmanuel-Thomas found Wilshere, and the young playmaker laid it back to French centre back Varane. Looking up, the summer signing launched a long ball down the Arsenal right for Walcott to chase. With Ashley Cole beaten by the England man's pace, the flying winger was able to burst into the penalty area, race past a static John Terry and lash a shot past Petr Cech at the near post. 1-0 to Arsenal, and just 14 seconds on the clock.\n\nIt would prove the only goal of the game, the young Arsenal side coping admirably with a strong Chelsea side whilst constantly looking dangerous on the break. With time running out for the Blues, Gunners substitute Kadlec was brought dwon by Rami when through on goal, and from then on the result was never in doubt. Varane's defensive performance and early assist saw him named man of the match, and the Gunners win their first trophy for six years, much to the joy of the fans!\n\n2010-11 - Season Review\n\nLeague: As you can see from the table in the previous post, things were close. The huge game against Chelsea saw us concede an injury time equaliser to keep the two sides level on points. However, the two sides reacted differently to the result - whilst we travelled to Eastlands and did this, our rivals suffered a big defeat against West Ham which started a run of poor form. A goalless draw at Bolton followed by a 3-1 defeat at Sunderland left us needing just a point in our penultimate game against Birmingham, and we produced the goods to claim our first title since the Invincibles season of 2003-4!\n\nCups: To add our Carling Cup win against Chelsea, we kicked off our FA Cup campaign with a thriller away at Carlisle, the youngsters eventually coming through in an epic encounter. The draw continued to be kind to us and Leicester, before Nottingham Forest put up a bit more resistance in the next round. Finally we came up against Chelsea again, and with international commitments robbing us of Fabregas, Vermaelen and Van Persie, we succumbed to defeat in a close replay. Chelsea would go on to win the cup, beating Spurs on penalties after a goalless final.\n\nEurope: The big story of the season was the Champions League, however, where we continued to upset the odds. After coming through the group comfortably we faced Zenit of Russia in the first knockout round, grabbing a late winner in St Petersburg before taking them apart in a 5-0 thrashing at the Emirates. Up next were Bayern Munich, fresh from knocking out Manchester United in their previous tie. We struggled in Germany but grabbed a crucial away goal in our 2-1 defeat, and at home the tables were turned and we secured a comfortable 1-0 win to send us through on away goals.\n\nThe semi-finals paired us with French side Lyon, and for the first time we played the home leg first. Michel Bastos put us behind after 20 minutes and we were lucky to be trailing by one, but the same player earned himself an early bath with a quarter of a hour to go, allowing Arshavin and Chamakh to give us a narrow lead to take to France. In the Stade de Gerland, Robin van Persie struck early to cancel their away goal, and a late consolation was irrelevant - we were in the final.\n\nLying in wait were Barcelona, reaching their third successive final on the back of a successful title defence in La Liga. The team sheets gave us hope - whilst we dropped Clichy to the bench for fitness reasons, the Catalans would had to play without star men Messi and Iniesta due to injury. After a dominant opening ten minutes for the Spaniards, captain Puyol was taken off injured, and we found a foothold in the game. By half time, we were on top. At the full time whistle however, neither side had broken through, and we headed to extra time. There, it was left to van Persie to make himself a hero, turning and firing in from the edge of the box to seal our first ever Champions League title and finish off our great run!.\n\n-----------------\n\nOverall, the squad was brilliant. I had not planned to make changes to the squad in January, but when Atletico Madrid approached me with a £10m bid for Eboue I couldn't say no, and in came young right back Serge Aurier as a replacement with bags of potential for less than half the price. With the board willing to back me, I also decided to splash out on Everton's young England midfielder Jack Rodwell, who slotted into our midfield immediately and will be a fixture in the first team next season.\n\nOf the existing players, there is much to be said - Captain Fabregas was incredible, and ably backed up by wonderkid Jack Wilshere in the creative role, the latter also helping out on the wings when needed. Robin van Persie recovered well from his long term injury to net some crucial goals, and Thomas Vermaelen was a rock in defence alonside Laurent Koscielny, picking up just two bookings and repelling many an opposition attack. But my player of the season has to be Theo Walcott, the youngster hitting over 20 goals from his right wing position including the winner in the Carling Cup final, and terrorising defences across Europe as we secured our treble.\n\nNext season? We have a young squad which has tasted success for the first time - my aim is to keep it together, add one or two promising youngsters to the mix and build on our position. The FA Cup would be great to complete our domestic success, but our priority will be defending our title. It won't be easy given the resources available to the likes of Chelsea and Manchester City, but we won't give it up without a fight!\n\nSeason 2011-12 - Preview\n\nWith the post-season holidays and pre-season friendlies but a memory, and the Community Shield secured in the most nerve-wracking fashion, the new season is just around the corner. Ahead of our opening day trip to Bolton, here's a quick overview of the changes that have taken place, and what the board expects of us this season.\n\nFirstly, the arrivals. Usually I'd post a link to my transfer history, but there's simply no point at this stage - it's just too big! After being given a budget of nearly £60m by the board, I sent out my scouts and spent just over half that amount, bringing in no fewer than 20 of the world's most talented young players. With some the English lads there was something of a scatter-gun approach, but I'm determined to develop an English core at the Emirates, and to do that I need to get them young! The best known of our signings is undoubtedly Martin Galvan, the Mexican playmaker who will spend a couple of years at feeder club Salamanca to earn himself a Spanish passport and develop his obvious talent. Elsewhere, we have particularly high hopes for Middlesbrough youth product Ashley Hughes, Italian midfielder Fabio Colombo and French striker Raymond Nana, who should turn into a top class player given the right coaching.\n\nTo offset our £32m spend, I managed to offload players to the tune of roughly the same amount. Fabianski heads to Newcastle for £5m, Diaby and Traore to Malaga and Zaragoza respectively for a combined £7m, and Squillaci to Valencia for £4m. The biggest deal however was undoubtedly that of Denilson, the Brazilian finding himself out in the cold at the Emirates and deciding to try his luck in the cold over in Russia, joining Zenit for a huge £15m. Almunia failed to find a buyer and has once again disappeared on loan, as have a large number of our promising youngsters, including much of last year's Carling Cup squad. First team experience in France, Spain and the Championship will hopefully enhance their abilities, and they should come back ready to try and claim a starting spot here at the Emirates.\n\nAs for expectations, they are understandably higher than last season. In the league we are expected to challenge for the title, and go two steps further than last season in the FA Cup by reaching the final. In Europe, we are not only expected to win the Super Cup, but put in a strong showing in our Champions League defence by getting to the final four. The squad showed last year that they are good enough, and with the trophy drought ended emphatically last year, anything less than a major trophy would be a huge disappointment. Only time will tell what we can achieve.\n\nThanks guys, I have to admit I wasn't expecting the CL in my first season - I've never managed that before with Arsenal!\n\nConsensio - I play Cesc as an Advanced Playmaker (Attack), between a Box-to-Box (Support) and a Ball-Winner (Defend). He is the only one of my players that I've changed the instructions too, but not a great deal - Roam From Position ticked, Run From Deep often and Long Shots toned down to sometimes. As you say, he's good enough to play well whatever role you put him in, but I think the key is not to play an AMC in front of him - I've done this before, and he effectively gets in Cesc's way, forcing him to play simpler passes to the AM and not giving him the room to break forward. You're right though, Arsenal do have an abundance of talent, especially in midfield, and that's part of the reason I'm going for the youth approach. If I make too many first team signings, there'll be too much competition!\n\nJones is someone my scouts have had a look at, and I can't decide whether I want him or not - on the one hand, he'll have a DC spot held down for a decade, and will help me on the way to my English core. On the other hand, he's quite expensive (money is no issue, but I don't like to splash out too often) and my current defense (Vermaelen, Koscielny, Djourou, Song if necessary) and immediate prospects (Jordan Spence, Darnel Situ, Raphael Varane) are performing well. Tempted to make a move at the end of the current season though\n\nSeason 2011-12 - Midseason Review\n\nLeague: On the home front it's been going very well so far, and after 19 games we are managing to lead the way in the league. Both Manchester clubs, Chelsea and to a lesser extent Liverpool and Spurs are all still in hunt, and as defending champions we are marked men, so it won't be easy. Our only defeat predictably came at Stamford Bridge, but at home against our title rivals we have been in good form - wins over Liverpool and United being particularly satisfying. Our finest result of the season came away at Fulham, Robin van Persie taking advantage of Fulham's fourth-choice goalkeeper and scoring half of his league goals in an injury-hit season so far. There's still a long way to go, but we're in the best possible position at the minute.\n\nCups: One thing we won't be doing is retaining our Carling Cup trophy. The second string dealt with West Ham comfortably in the 3rd Round before being drawn away at Bristol City in the next. Expecting an easy victory, we were dominated for 70 minutes before forcing extra time, taking the lead and finally succumbing to the defeat we deserved. Bolton, Chelsea, Sunderland and Liverpool make up the last four.\n\nElsewhere, the FA Cup draw sees us at home to Wigan, and we added a global title to our trophy cabinet. Complacent defending allowed Okayama FC to take our semi-final to penalties, but we progressed to a final against Raja Casablanca, the surprise package who had knocked out both Club America of Mexico and Brazilians Internacional on the way. Unsurprisingly we were too good, our second side scoring early and securing the Club World Cup.\n\nEurope: With the Super Cup secured early, we were placed in a Champions League group more well-rounded than last year, but still strong - Sporting, HSV and Dinamo Moscow our opponents. In the end only the Germans could score against us, but they did so 6 times (their only two wins!), leaving us needing a result against Lisbon in our final game. Thankfully we cruised past them to top the group, and we face another trip to Eastern Europe as we drew Shakhtar Donetsk in the knockout round. Given that Barcelona and Milan were potential opponents, I'm pretty happy with the draw.\n\nSo, with Fabregas playing even better than last year (he's already matched his league goal tally for last year), the team atop the league and money available should we need it, the rest of the season looks promising. All we have to do is keep winning!\n\n2011-12 - Season Review\n\nLeague: After leading a tight pack at halfway, we simply couldn't find a away to pull ahead of our rivals. They matched us point for point, but we suffered just a single defeat - crushingly, it came at the home of most hated rivals. Still, we never gave up fighting and were rewarded with moments like these at Old Trafford along with the odd thrashing of sides like Portsmouth, and despite three teams remaining in pursuit a win in our penultimate game against Villa would see us retain the title. With a little help from Richard Dunne we won a pulsating match, sealing our second successive title.\n\nCups: With our Carling Cup run ending in early disappointment and the World Club Cup sitting in the trophy cabinet, we turned our efforts to the FA Cup. The men down at FA Headquarters clearly had it in for us, but we managed to overcome the odds and take the trophy after one of the hardest cup runs I've ever seen, which saw us face Premier League opposition in every round and four of the league's top six. Wigan were easy enough, but City and Liverpool away followed by Villa at home and United at Wembley were all sizeable obstacles in our path to the final.\n\nThere we would face arch-rivals Spurs, and a Jack Wilshere goal in the first minute set us on our way. To their credit Tottenham came back strongly and got a deserved equaliser, but we were always the better team and van Persie's extra time goal avenged our league defeat and won us the trophy.\n\nEurope: To add to our Super Cup win, we had the tough task of trying to defend our Champions League title. After coming through the group stage we drew Shakhtar Donetsk, and a 3-0 win in Ukraine allowed me to play the seconds in the home leg. We gave up our three away goals but scored five of our own in a classic match, and progressed to play Porto in the last eight. A frustrating goalless draw at home added a bit of pressure going to Portugal, but we recorded a comfortable 3-0 victory to move to the semis.\n\nLying in wait were Real Madrid, and I soon realised how lucky we were last season. We may have dodged the Messi bullet in the final, but we were no match for Cristiano Ronaldo, the Portuguese winger tearing us apart in the first leg. We had to throw caution to the wind in Spain and were caught out on the counter on numerous occasions, crashing out 5-1 on aggregate and putting an end to European campaign.\n\n-----------------------\n\nAs the end of year awards suggest, the usual suspects were in good form once again. I shan't bore you with another screenshot of Fabregas, and instead show you his partners in crime - the age-defying Andrey Arshavin and lethal Theo Walcott, who has made the right wing position his own, and with his blistering pace is more than a match for any left back in the world. The inconsistency of his earlier years are now a memory.\n\nAs far as the youngsters go, it is still the players at the club when I arrived who are impressing. Aaron Ramsey did well as he was eased back into first team duties, but will have to work to cement a place given his proficiency in arguably our deepest position and the impressive cameo performances of Henri Lansbury. Further forward, Nacer Barazite, who also spent last season away on loan, is developing into a great young winger capable of performing when required.\n\nNext season then. With almost £150m in the club bank account there will no doubt be money to spend, but to be honest I can't see myself buying for the first team. The squad is young as it is, with only Sagna, Arshavin, van Persie and Chamakh above the age of 26, and the likes of Aurier, Barazite and Kadlec already coming through to replace them. Instead, we will focus on finding the world's most talented teenagers, honing their talents at the Emirates and turning them into the Gunners of the future - the plan seems to be working, as the Under 18s won their title without suffering defeat. Meanwhile, anything less than a third league title would be a disappointment - we have the chance to create a real legacy here.\n\nSeason 2012-13 - Preview\n\nAnother year, another set of friendlies, and another win in the Community Shield brings us to the start of a new season, so time for a look at the changes we've made over the summer.\n\nUnlike last season, we have made one addition to the first team squad, one which Consensio will no doubt be pleased with - Blackburn centre back Phil Jones joins us for £11m, and for reasons which will be explained later will slot into the first team as he develops his undoubted potential.\n\nElsewhere, we invested heavily in youth once again, spending around half of my £65m budget on the hottest young properties in football. This year our biggest hopes lies with left winger Dan Lovell from Birmingham, who could probably start in a lower Championship side already and could well be a long-term replacement for Arshavin and Nasri. There are also good things being said about Gambian/English centre back Sheikh Saho and Russian striker Ruslan Arkhipov, who looks to have great potential and will spend a year on loan at new feeder club Rangers.\n\nGoing out are a couple of big names - Almunia's loan spell at PSG seems to have ended in his retirement, Mannone goes to Sporting Lisbon for £2m, and Nicklas Bendtner will spend a term on loan with Newcastle with view to a £7.5m move in the future. However, the biggest departure is that of Laurent Koscielny on loan to Inter for a huge fee of £5.5m. The move arose from his disappointment in the signing of Jones and his falling out with youngster Situ, but with no future fee involved we find ourselves in a win-win situation - We get £5m for the deal, and after a year get a quality defender back who will hopefully have got over his worries. A great piece of business.\n\nOn to the new season then, and the expectation are the same as last year - challenge for the title, FA Cup finalists and last four in Europe. Personally I am aiming for a third league title, at least one domestic cup and the Champions League semis. The squad is certainly capable, and we will once again be the team to beat.\n\nThanks ada5tra, I'm glad you're enjoying the thread and best of luck with your own Arsenal save\n\nI think with regards to transfer policy, Arsenal are one of the few lucky clubs who can go both ways - the budget soon becomes big enough to sign one or two quality first team players every year, but on the other hand with the facilities and youth setup that Arsenal have, it makes sense for me to go that route. In the 3rd season I've only really bought Lloris, Rodwell and to a lesser extent Jones for a starting berth, whilst the likes of Wilshere, Ramsey, Gibbs, Lansbury, Emmanuel-Thomas and Barazite are already developing into viable options. Once a few more break through, it'll be hard to justify keeping the older players around on their bigger salaries!\n\nAs for tactics - this is the first save I've used this 4-3-3 as normally I use a very attacking narrow 4-2-3-1, but that just didn't wasn't making the most of the squad and Fabregas in particular. This current system seems to have struck the right balance, and at the start of this season I'm getting even more goals from the likes of Arshavin and Nasri, which is brilliant.\n\nAlso, I think I got lucky with Rosicky - offered him out in my first week and Villa came straight back - £2m up front, £8m over 24 months and the rest paid at £100k per game. Considering I couldn't find a spot for him, I was more than happy!\n\nThanks again you two, hope you continue to enjoy the thread\n\nSeason 2012-3 - Midseason Review\n\nLeague: Once again, we have not things entirely our own way. After twelve games were were cruising along at the top with a 10-2-0 record, but a sudden goal drought cut our lead dramatically, scoreless draws at home to United and Spurs sandwiched our only defeat so far at Villa Park. Results like this and impressive comebacks such as this at Anfield puts our offence at the top of the scoring charts, but in recent weeks we have struggled to break down our more defensive opponents. At the halfway point we are locked in a tight battle at the top of the league, but it will not be easy if we are to retain our title.\n\nCups: With the Community Shield under our belt we set off on our Carling Cup campaign, but once again it ended it disappointment. 3-0 and 2-0 home wins over Everton and Wolves put us into the quarter finals, but a trip to Big Sam's Blackburn put an end to our run, a deflected free kick early in the second half beating Smithies in goal and sealing a 2-1 win for our hosts.\n\nMeanwhile, the FA Cup has thrown up a winnable tie in the Third Round, at home to Wigan. After last year's successful run, I have high hopes for this competition.\n\nEurope: Valencia, Olympiakos and AZ were our Champions League opponents in arguably our toughest group so far but we got through fairly comfortably, a complacent 3-2 reverse in Alkmaar the only blip as we finished as group winners, thrashing Valencia 6-0 in the process. However, our reward was a spot in the highest profile tie of the round - Internazionale. The two legs will be a huge test of our young squad, with a couple of weaker tie at the bottom of the draw, victory could see us well positioned to make a run deep into the knockout rounds.\n\nOn the squad front it's the same old story - Fabregas controlling our play with probably his best campaign yet, and van Persie starting well before suffering another long term injury. Chamakh and Kadlec will have to step up to fill his goalscoring boots, but thankfully Samir Nasri has kindly offered to help them out. Walcott and Arshavin are in top form and once again weighing in with their fair share of the goals, and the defence is the tightest in the Premier League. At the moment, all the signs are positive."
