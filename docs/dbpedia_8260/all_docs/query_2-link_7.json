        "text": "It all seemed to be going so well. On Sunday February 27th Arsenal faced off with Birmingham in the Carling Cup final at Wembley, still contenders in the other three main competitions of the season. In the build-up to the game, ‘quadruple’ was whispered; just ever so quietly. The possibility of emphatically ending their barren spell of no trophies in five years with all four pieces of silverware was being considered.\n\nAnd then it happened. In the dying moments of normal time with the scores tied at 1-1, Wojciech Szczesny and Laurent Koscielny left the ball for each other. What should have been a routine clearance for the Frenchman or any easy pick-up for the Pole was instead allowed to bounce towards Birmingham’s Obafemi Martins. The Nigerian striker swept the ball into the goal and in that moment, a meltdown began. Within six weeks, Arsenal’s challenge in all competitions ended and the incredible work that had been put in to build up to that moment was seemingly wasted.\n\nArsenal end the season without any silverware once again but there were moments of enjoyment along the way. Over two ties with Barcelona, Arsenal were more than competitive until Robin van Persie was sent-off. Things could have ended very different had the full complement of Arsenal players stayed on the pitch.\n\nOn its own, fourth place in the league, last sixteen of the Champions League, Carling Cup runners-up and FA Cup quarter finalists isn’t a bad return from a season. The problem for Arsenal fans is that it had promised so much more.\n\nRegular Starting Eleven\n\nGame of the season Arsenal 2-1 Barcelona An incredible game and an incredible night saw Arsenal matching and then outplaying the apparent best team on the planet. Arsene Wenger’s side saved their best performance for the crucial leg and walked away with a well-deserved lead. They were disciplined in defence; keeping Barcelona at arm’s length and clinical in possession. The move for Andrei Arshavin’s winning goal was amongst the best football you’ll have enjoyed all season long. Sadly, it all went wrong in the second leg.\n\nPlayer of the season Jack Wilshere In the space of one season, Wilshere went from the ‘great English hope’ to the anchor of the England midfield for years to come. His natural comfort on the ball means he regularly finds space in a packed midfield. Even when he was expected to look out of his depth, in the clashes with Barcelona and the crunch games with the other teams of ‘The Big Four,’ Wilshere simply rose to the level of the game and flourished. He fronted up against Xavi and Andres Iniesta like he’d been doing it for years.\n\nSeason in a tweet\n\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/15yearoldgooner/status/73126694478807040\n\nBiggest disappointment Sebastien Squillaci He should have been the experienced head with previous of playing at the top of European competition that helped Arsene Wenger to shore up his troubled defence. But in truth, the Arsenal back-line looked more liable for a mistake every time that he played.\n\nChanges needed for next season? Depending on who you listen to and what you read, Arsenal’s summer could be vastly different. Szczesny has done enough to warrant a full season as the number one and in front of him, it could really depend on who Arsene loses in the close season. Denilson and Nicklas Bendtner have already expressed their desire to leave and if more follow, Wenger will need to replenish his numbers from further afield than his youth teams. Fabregas could finally be on his way to Barcelona which would leave a massive gap in the pivotal role of Arsenal’s system.\n\nA striker to shoulder some of Robin van Persie’s goalscoring duties, a central defender to play alongside Thomas Vermaelen and a creative spark in midfield would be a start but things could get very busy around the Emirates especially as Wenger has already indicated he is expecting to be more active than he has been for some time."
