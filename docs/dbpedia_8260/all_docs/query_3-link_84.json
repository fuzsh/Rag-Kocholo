        "text": "Rasmus Hojlund will hope the number nine shirt can serve him well at Manchester United going forward, though not every holder of the iconic number has been successful.\n\nHojlund wore 11 for United in his first season at Old Trafford after joining for Â£72million from Atalanta. He will now make the switch, though, after Anthony Martial's exit left the shirt vacant.\n\nThe Danish international scored 16 goals in 43 appearances during his debut season in Manchester while wearing the number 11. It was an underwhelming campaign for the club, though, with an early Champions League exit and eighth-place league finish, though victory in the FA Cup final ensured it ended on a high.\n\nThere had been suggestions new signing Joshua Zirkzee might become United's new number nine. Instead, though, that honour falls to Hojlund with Zirkzee expected to wear the same number 11 he donned for Bologna last term.\n\nHojlund has a chance to make the new number his own, but others have tried and failed to assert themselves in the past. Here, Mirror Football looks at the previous wearers of United's number nine and how they got on.\n\nBrian McClair\n\nWhen the Premier League introduced squad numbers for the 1993-94 season McClair was the first to wear nine for United. The Scottish forward had already been at Old Trafford for the best part of a decade, winning the inaugural Premier League the previous season, and wore the number for three years before ceding it to Andy Cole.\n\nHow would you rank Manchester United's number nines? Let us know in the comments section\n\nOne of McClair's most notable moments in the number nine shirt came at Wembley in the 1994 FA Cup final. He came off the bench to score United's fourth goal in their victory over Chelsea as they wrapped up their first domestic double under Alex Ferguson.\n\nAndy Cole\n\nCole joined United from Newcastle in a big-money move midway through the 1994-95 season, but wore 17 to begin with. He only switched to 9 for the 1997-98 campaign, when United lost out on the league title to Arsenal but the following season went rather better.\n\nThe England international bagged 24 goals in all competitions in 1998-99, including a title-winning strike against Spurs on the final day of the league season. He netted just once in the knockout rounds of the Champions League, but it was an important one, sealing a comeback victory over Juventus in the semi-finals before Ole Gunnar Solskjaer ended up as the match-winner in the final.\n\nLouis Saha\n\nThe number nine shirt was vacant for the 2002--03 season after Cole's departure, but Louis Saha took it midway through the following campaign after joining from Fulham. Injuries impacted the Frenchman's time at Old Trafford, though there were still some high points.\n\nSaha contributed during United's 2006-07 and 2007-08 title wins under Ferguson, and scored several times during the run to the Champions League semi-finals in 2007. However, he played no part in the 2008 final as United beat Chelsea on penalties in Moscow.\n\nDimitar Berbatov\n\nJust days after Saha's departure for Everton in August 2008, Berbatov made a deadline day move to Old Trafford from Tottenham. The Bulgarian was a natural fit to inherit the number nine shirt, and his spell brought highs and lows.\n\nThe clear highlight came in the 2010-11 season, when 20 goals - including a memorable hat-trick against Liverpool - ensured Berbatov top-scored in the Premier League. By the time he left in 2012, though, his star had fallen.\n\nRadamel Falcao\n\nUnited went without a number nine in Sir Alex Ferguson's final season in charge, and in David Moyes' sole campaign. Things changed under Louis van Gaal, though, with Falcao taking the shirt after joining on a season-long loan from Monaco.\n\nIt was a forgettable season for the Colombian, who couldn't get into much of a rhythm as he made his return following serious injury. He was similarly underwhelming while wearing nine for Chelsea in the following season, but a return to Monaco brought a return to form in 2016-17.\n\nAnthony Martial\n\nMartial made a flying start to life at Old Trafford after joining from Monaco in 2015. The number nine shirt appeared to suit him well as he curled home a memorable goal against Liverpool on his debut.\n\nHe scored 11 in the league that season, and a career-best 17 in 2019-20 after reclaiming the number nine shirt. More recently, though, injuries have stood in the way of anything more.\n\nZlatan Ibrahimovic\n\nMartial's spell without the shirt began in 2016-17 when Zlatan Ibrahimovic took the honours. The Swede wasn't at Old Trafford for very long, but he did make an impact.\n\nUnited won the EFL Cup and Europa League in his one season in the shirt, with Ibrahimovic scoring twice in the final of the former. After leaving and then agreeing new terms, though, he inherited Wayne Rooney's number 10 shirt in his second season at Old Trafford.\n\nRomelu Lukaku\n\nIbrahimovic's switch to 10 came after Lukaku, a big-money arrival from Everton, became United's new number nine. Like Martial, he looked a natural fit on his Premier League debut - in his case a 4-0 victory over West Ham.\n\nAfter a fast start, though, his form tailed off and he left for Inter Milan in 2019. Not before a memorable outing against Paris Saint-Germain, though, when he scored twice in a dramatic Champions League comeback."
