        "text": "Ahead of tomorrow night’s Carabao Cup Fourth Round tie at the London Stadium versus West Ham United, which will be refereed by Simon Hooper, I spoke to one of their supporters. Thank you to Rob (@robpatterson24) for answering the questions!\n\nHow long have you supported West Ham?\n\nI’ve been a West Ham fan since probably a toddler, having been born and grown up in Essex, perhaps swayed by the local paper at the time. 30 odd years on, I’m a season ticket holder and have finally seen us win a trophy. It’s never a dull day as a supporter of this club!\n\nWhat are your hopes and expectations for the 2023/24 season?\n\nHas to be winning the UEFA Europa League in Dublin! But if I’m honest having a better season in the Premier League and a decent domestic cup run has to be a must if we are to truly progress from the UEFA Europa Conference League win last season.\n\nWhat are your views on your manager?\n\nWhere to begin? It’s been a rollercoaster with David Moyes. Since he came back, he’s delivered some of the best memories I’ve ever had watching West Ham and he deserves credit for winning the Europa Conference League last season. But it’s not been plain sailing. Last season in the Premier League was awful and it wouldn’t have been a surprise to have seen him get sacked at the end of it. I expect that this might be his last season given his contract situation. Whilst Declan Rice has left for Arsenal, we’ve adequately replaced him with Edson Alvarez who’s slotted into the role generally well (minus the goals!) and he (with Tim Steidten’s guidance) has recruited well this season elsewhere – but something’s not clicking since the international break and once again, he’s well under pressure after 3 defeats in 3 in all competitions.\n\nStyle of play and tactics – direct/passing/hybrid?\n\nIt’s been one of those seasons where at times it’s very clear to see what we do and at others, it’s fairly surprising. David Moyes’ teams are generally defensive in nature and we are best on the counter-attack and at set pieces (even more so with the signing of James Ward-Prowse from Southampton this summer). For the most part, we play very well without the ball – especially against possession-based sides like Brighton. Yet, when we have the ball, we play some absolutely beautiful stuff but lately without the end product. I suspect we’ll revert to type for this one – although how it works will depend on who starts for Arsenal.\n\nOne(s) to watch now and in the future?\n\nWe’re 10 games into the PL season and there’s one recent standout. Mohammed Kudus has looked very bright. Against Newcastle, scored his first Premier League goal (and what a cracker it was) and has two in the Europa League so far. He creates opportunities from nothing and generally is our most exciting player when on the pitch. With a really important game on Saturday, I expect he’ll be benched for this one.\n\nHowever, Divin Mubama is the player to watch for the future. Made his European and Domestic debuts last season, scoring one goal in Europe and a bag full for the U21s. Won the FA Youth Cup with us also. He’s very much a rapid forward with a bundle of energy. West Ham fans I talk to regularly love what he brings to the club and it’s clear David Moyes thinks there’s a role for him this season as he’s not gone on loan. However, he’s allegedly rejected a new contract offer because he’s not playing as much as maybe he was promised – I reckon he’ll get the time here in a one-off game but that’s only if Ings doesn’t play.\n\nRandom fact about your Club?\n\nThere are plenty of famous West Ham fans out there (Ray Winstone anyone?), but (whilst not random to us so much) our right winger Jarrod Bowen is dating ex-Eastenders actor Danny Dyer’s daughter, Danni.\n\nWhich were your favourite and least favourite matches involving West Ham?\n\nFavourites:\n\n* Has to be the Europa Conference League final in Prague last season. Nothing will beat that for a long time.\n\n* West Ham vs Sevilla, 2nd Leg R16, Europa League 21/22 – 1-0 down from the first leg, the boys turned it around at home with a raucous crowd to win 2-1 on aggregate. The best live atmosphere of any football game I’ve ever been to.\n\nLeast favourite:\n\n* Relegation at Wigan in 2010/11 season. Absolutely heart-wrenching season ending with that. That said, it started the rebuild of this club so there is a silver lining.\n\nWhich sides do you think will finish in the top 4 and which do you think will finish in the bottom 3 of the Premier League?\n\nTop Four: Manchester City, Liverpool, Tottenham, and Arsenal.\n\nBottom Three: Luton, Everton, and Sheffield United.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Arsenal?\n\nClearly a very talented side, it’s easy to see how things have clicked over the last season and a bit. And they’ve generally recruited well over the last couple of years, notably taking Declan Rice from us – it’s clear he’s made them look better (but a reminder to Arsenal fans that he was doing that week in and week out for us) but you take away Dec and some of the heart of the midfield (as well as perhaps Jesus), then they can be vulnerable. There is only one thing I dislike about Arsenal and that has to be Arteta. I’m sure Arsenal fans now love the guy with how he’s got them playing but the guy drives me crazy trying to be like Pep.\n\nAll in all, I can see Arsenal finishing in the Champions League positions again at the end of the season, but I reckon they’ll fall short of the league title again with a much stronger top 10 overall.\n\nIf you could steal one Arsenal player for your own team, who would it be and why?\n\nWhilst I’d love Dec back, I’d actually take Eddie Nketiah. The guy is insane and knows where the goal is – would be a massive upgrade on Michail Antonio, who really does need to be replaced in the January window and I reckon would slot right in at West Ham.\n\nWhat is your prediction for this match?\n\nIt’s a one-off cup match at home, and we’re not in a great run of form at the minute – lots of nice football at times, but nothing to show for it. Given the significance, I’m going to go with an entertaining 2-2 draw with West Ham pipping it on Penalties."
