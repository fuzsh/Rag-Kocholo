        "text": "The Premier League season has drawn to a close once again but how have the clubs been operating financially? In 2010/11 the 20 top-flight clubs made a record income of £2.3bn but the latest published accounts show only five actually made a profit.\n\nTelevision deals, especially a record £1.5bn from overseas broadcasters has meant the combined turnover of the clubs has increased to £2.3bn compared with £2.1bn in 2009/10.\n\nDavid Conn has written:\n\nOf the other clubs, 14 made losses, totalling £463.4m. Manchester City, in the third year since Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi's ruling family bought the club and began to pour in money to acquire a team capable of winning the Premier League, lost £197m, the greatest financial loss in the history of football.\n\nChelsea lost the next highest amount, £68m, bankrolled by their owner, the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, who loaned £94m to the club during 2010‑11. Liverpool, documenting the first eight months of ownership by John Henry's Fenway Sports Group, lost £49m.\n\nThe graphic below shows each Premier League club's net debt.\n\nYou can find a visual comparison of each club's turnover against its wage bill here.\n\nThe table below shows turnover plus income from sources such as gate/matchday and TV and broadcasting as well as net debt for each club and wages as a percentage of turnover.\n\nYou can also download a spreadsheet containing additional accounts details including losses, profits and owners' financial contributions for the 2010/11 and 2009/10 seasons.\n\nWhat can you do with the data?\n\nData summary\n\nDownload the data\n\n• DATA: download the full spreadsheet\n\nMore data\n\nMore data journalism and data visualisations from the Guardian\n\nWorld government data\n\n• Search the world's government data with our gateway\n\nDevelopment and aid data\n\n• Search the world's global development data with our gateway\n\nCan you do something with this data?\n\n• Flickr Please post your visualisations and mash-ups on our Flickr group\n\n• Contact us at data@guardian.co.uk"
