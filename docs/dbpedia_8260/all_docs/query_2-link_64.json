        "text": "Arsenal travel to Portugal tonight for the first leg of their Champions League round of 16 clash against Porto, live on talkSPORT 2.\n\nThe Gunners have been drawn to face the Portuguese giants who were champions of Europe in 2004 and haven't won on their three previous visits to Porto.\n\nBut Mikel Arteta's men head to Portugal in great form and with confidence flowing after thrashing Crystal Palace, Burnley and West Ham in recent weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, Porto aren't in the best form, having won just one of their last three.\n\nHowever, at home, they are a different beast, losing two matches all season and one was a narrow defeat to Barcelona, so this won't be easy for Arsenal.\n\nPorto vs Arsenal: Gunners flying\n\nJust before the new year, Arsenal lost to West Ham and Fulham and appeared to be showing signs they were cracking.\n\nThey followed that up with a 2-0 defeat to Liverpool at home in the FA Cup to leave them out of both domestic cup competitions.\n\nHowever, their league form has been exemplary, and they are turning into a winning machine.\n\nThey are also scoring a lot of goals, with Martin Odegaard and Bukayo Saka looking particularly sharp.\n\nLeandro Trossard, starting as the lone striker with Gabriel Jesus injured, has also added a new dimension to their attack, while their midwinter trip to Dubai appears to have re-energised the whole team.\n\nIn many ways, this is the right time to be hitting form, as opposed to last year, when the Gunners started to slip up and allow Manchester City to catch them at the top of the table.\n\nIn the Champions League, they are also one of the strongest sides remaining and will feel confident about getting past Porto.\n\nFC Porto have been eliminated from seven of their eight UEFA Champions League knockout ties against English opposition, with the exception being a round of 16 victory over Manchester United en route to winning the trophy in 2003-04.\n\nArsenal have won all three of their home UEFA Champions League games against FC Porto by an aggregate score of 11-0, but are winless in all three away games (D1 L2).\n\nThe last time Arsenal got past the round of 16 in the UEFA Champions League, they did so by beating FC Porto 6-2 on aggregate in the 2009-10 campaign. Nicklas Bendtner scored a hat-trick at the Emirates for the Gunners in that tie.\n\nPorto vs Arsenal: Team news\n\nPorto: Costa, Joao Mario, Kleper Pepe, Otavio, Wendell, Varela, Gonzalez, Francisco Conceicao, Eduardo Pepe, Galeno, Evanilson\n\nSubstitutes: Stephen Eustaquio, Grujic, Claudio Ramos, Sanchez, Jaime, Loader, Andre Franco, Baro, Martinez, Borges, Ze Pedro, Fabio Cardoso\n\nArsenal: Raya, White, Saliba, Gabriel, Kiwior, Odegaard, Rice, Havertz, Saka, Trossard, Martinelli\n\nSubstitutes: Ramsdale, Smith Rowe, Nketiah, Cedric, Jorginho, Vieira, Nelson, Elneny, Hein, Nwaneri, Lannin-Sweet, Heaven\n\nEach of the last five teams to eliminate FC Porto from the UEFA Champions League in the knockout rounds of the competition has gone on to reach the final that year – Juventus in 2016-17 (last 16), Liverpool in 2017-18 (last 16) and 2018-19 (quarter-final), Chelsea in 2020-21 (quarter-final) and Inter last season (last 16).\n\nSince the round of 16 was introduced in the UEFA Champions League in 2003-04, Arsenal have gone out at this stage more than any other side (9), including in each of their last seven appearances in the competition between 2010-11 and 2016-17. With eight last 16 eliminations, FC Porto are joint-second in this regard.\n\nFC Porto have scored seven goals in their last two UEFA Champions League home games, as many as they had in their previous nine home matches in the competition combined.\n\nPorto vs Arsenal: What has been said?\n\nArteta has been speaking about how much belief he has that his Arsenal team can go far in the Champions League.\n\nHe said: \"It’s great we have earned the right to be here.\n\n\"It’s been seven years since we’ve been at this table for this kind of match and 14 years since we’ve been able to go to the next stage.\n\n\"That’s the challenge, that’s what is ahead of us and we are really excited to face it, and to go for it with full belief, that’s for sure.\"\n\nArsenal have scored more first half goals than any other side in the UEFA Champions League this season, with 12 of their 16 strikes coming before half-time. The Gunners have scored in the opening 45 minutes in each of their last 13 Champions League games, the longest such run in European Cup history.\n\nIn this year’s UEFA Champions League group stage, only Manchester City (91%) and Real Madrid (89%) had a higher pass completion rate under pressure than Arsenal (86%).\n\nIn a run stretching back to November 2018 with Man City, Arsenal’s Gabriel Jesus has been involved in 20 goals in his last 18 UEFA Champions League starts (15 goals, 5 assists). He’s been involved in six goals in four starts for the Gunners so far this term (4 goals, 2 assists).\n\nNo player has been involved in more UEFA Champions League goals this season than Arsenal’s Bukayo Saka (3 goals, 4 assists), with the young Englishman averaging a goal involvement every 48 minutes in the competition so far.\n\nPorto vs Arsenal: Date and how to follow\n\nThis Champions League last-16 first-leg clash will take place on Wednesday, February 21.\n\nThe match at the Dragao is due to kick-off at 8pm UK time.\n\ntalkSPORT 2 will have live coverage from Portugal with commentary from Jim Proudfoot and former Republic of Ireland international Andy Townsend.\n\ntalkSPORT.com will also have all the reaction.\n\nTo tune in to talkSPORT or talkSPORT 2 through the website, click HERE for the live stream.
