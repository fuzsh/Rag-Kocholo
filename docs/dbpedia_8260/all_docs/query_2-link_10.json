        "text": "Chelsea begin the defence of their Premier League title with a home match against newly promoted West Bromwich Albion. The 14 August match means a return to Stamford Bridge for the former Blues midfielder Roberto Di Matteo, now manager of West Brom.\n\nNext up for the champions will be a trip to Wigan Athletic, where they were beaten last season, before Stoke City visit Stamford Bridge on 28 August. The title holders have to wait until 2 October for their first match against one of the big four clubs, when they face Arsenal at home, with the return fixture on Boxing Day.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti's side first face Manchester United on 18 December, with the two playing at Old Trafford on 7 May – the Blues' penultimate away fixture. United, runners-up in 2009-10, also start with a home match against a newly promoted team. Sir Alex Ferguson's side take on Newcastle United on the first day. Blackpool, the third of the sides promoted from the Championship, provide the Old Trafford opposition on the last day of the season, 22 May.\n\nThere are two intriguing matches between top-four hopefuls on the opening day. Liverpool start the post-Rafael Benítez era with a home match against Arsenal, while Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City meet at White Hart Lane.\n\nAston Villa face West Ham United and Everton travel to Blackburn Rovers, while Blackpool's first match in the Premier League is at home, to local rivals Wigan. Elsewhere on the opening day, Steve Bruce's Sunderland are at home to Birmingham City, one of the clubs he previously managed. Wolverhampton Wanderers and Stoke City play at Molineux, while Bolton Wanderers and Europa League runners-up Fulham meet in the north-west.\n\nNewcastle's manager, Chris Hughton, admitted he had been hoping for an easier start after seeing his side given a trip to Old Trafford on the opening day. \"It's a tough start for us, we would have preferred a home game to kick the season off but you take what you get,\" he said.\n\n\"We can take heart and confidence from the 1-1 draw we earned at Old Trafford two years ago on the opening day of the 2008-09 season. Villa at home the following week is another tough one but a great game to begin our home campaign. You tend to look at the number of back-to-back games you have against the top six/eight teams and our fixture list looks to be fairly balanced in that respect.\"\n\nThe Blackpool manager, Ian Holloway, welcomed the news his side will play their first game at home followed by a visit from Arsenal. \"It is nice to kick off with a home game and with Wigan up the road it will be nice for us,\" he told Sky Sports News.\n\nOn the trip to north London to face Arsène Wenger's men, he added: \"That's fantastic, that's exactly what I wanted. It will be a new experience for all of us going to the Emirates. Hopefully all the butterflies will be out of the way and we can see what we can do against Arsenal.\"\n\nBlackpool also face a tricky finish when they meet Manchester United at Old Trafford on the final day. \"That will be nice if we could celebrate staying up,\" said Holloway. \"I am sure Sir Alex (Ferguson) has already sent me a letter telling me to bring some good red wine.\""
