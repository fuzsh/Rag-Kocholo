        "text": "Arsène Wenger believes it will be \"difficult but possible\" for Arsenal to overcome Barcelona after the sides were paired in the Champions League last-16 draw.\n\nThe matches will be a repeat of last season's quarter-final, when Barcelona's 4-1 second-leg win at Camp Nou completed a 6-3 aggregate success for the Spanish club.\n\nWenger told Arsenal's website: \"Revenge is not on my mind. We want to qualify and we want to knock them out. So is it difficult? Yes. Is it possible? Yes.\n\n\"Barcelona are certainly the favourites [for the competition] and a famous team but, on their side, they did not want us either because they know they will get a game.\n\n\"I think we are better than last year and we have a good opportunity to show that.\"\n\nThe match will also give the Arsenal captain, Cesc Fábregas, the chance to face his former club at Camp Nou – he missed the away leg last season after being injured in the 2-2 first-leg draw at the Emirates. Barcelona tried to re-sign him last summer.\n\n\"We are in the middle of December and we play at the end of February, so there is a long way to go,\" said Wenger.\n\n\"It is too early to speak about this game concretely. You can just speak about the draw. The whole context might be completely different in two months. We don't know what we will do and how we will feel.\n\n\"But the best way of going into that game with confidence is down to what we do from today until then. If we do well in the league, the FA Cup and the Carling Cup that will give us the best chance of knocking them out.\"\n\nThe Barcelona sporting director, Andoni Zubizarreta, admitted that it was impossible to overlook the talk of Fábregas. \"Obviously there will be a lot of talk about Cesc until the tie starts. That's logical,\" said Zubizarreta.\n\n\"He's a player who learnt his trade at Barca and for him it will be a very special game.\n\n\"He will be able to come up against his Spain team-mates and play in the Nou Camp with Barcelona as a rival, which he couldn't do last season.\n\n\"It will be a spectacular tie. Both teams have a footballing style that is built around possession of the ball. Last year's game [at the Emirates] it was wonderful but Arsenal have character and what looked like a [Barcelona] win ended up being a draw.\n\n\"Without Cesc, they have called on [Samir] Nasri and things have changed in goal for them too. They still have the same style though – they have good passers, speed on the break and good finishers.\n\n\"I hope Cesc can play the second leg at the Camp Nou: I am sure that the fans will give him a warm welcome.\"\n\nThe Barcelona coach, Pep Guardiola, also spoke of his respect for Arsenal, even saying that he is \"frightened\" by the prospect of facing Wenger's side.\n\n\"Arsenal are a classic of English football,\" he said. \"They have been playing good for football for years now. I think they will be stronger than they were last season with Nasri now fully established in the team, plus the signing of [Marouane] Chamakh. Also there's a difference this time: Cesc will be on the pitch.\n\n\"Arsenal frighten me, but that is true of all the clubs in the draw. I see difficulties in all of them. I will be a little calmer when I start to watch their games, if I can see any weaknesses.\n\n\"If you're not at your best, Arsenal over-run you. It should be a fantastic game because we are two very similar sides. \"They are a very bold, daring team, a side that forces you to defend very well. They play and defend with the ball – they are a very good team who play nice football.\"\n\nThe first leg will take place at Emirates Stadium on Wednesday 16 February 2011, with the second leg at Camp Nou on Tuesday 8 March."
