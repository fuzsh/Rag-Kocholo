        "text": "1. Arsenal Holdings plc Results for the year ended 31 May 2011 ARSENAL STARTS ITS 125th YEAR IN STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION Group turnover was £255.7 million (2010 - £379.9 million). Reduction was due to the expected lower level of property sales activity. The sale of apartments at Highbury Square is in its final stages, with 69 sale completions in the year (2010 – 362) generating £30.3 million of revenue from property (2010 - £156.9 million). Operating profit in the property business was £12.6 million (2010 - £15.2 million) including the write back of part of a previous impairment provision in respect of the Queensland Road development site. Operating profit (before exceptional costs, depreciation and player trading) in the football business was £45.8 million (2010 - £56.8 million) with commercial gains offset by increased wage costs. Loss from player trading of £14.7 million (2010 – profit of £13.6 million) with no significant disposals of registrations in the year. Group profit before tax was £14.8 million (2010 - £56.0 million). The Group’s property business continues to be debt free and generating surplus cash for the Group. The overall level of Group net debt had been reduced to £97.8 million (2010 - £135.6 million) at the balance sheet date. Commenting on the results for the year, Peter Hill-Wood, non-executive Chairman, said: “The sad passing of our dear colleague Danny Fiszman has heralded a time of change in terms of ownership. We continue to run the Club effectively and in a self-sustaining way which is important for our long-term future. We have had a robust financial performance, reporting another profitable set of full year results.” Ivan Gazidis, Chief Executive, said: “Our primary objective, as we take the Club forward, will always be success on the field. To give the Club the best opportunity to achieve this, we must drive a virtuous circle of increased revenue, increased investment in the team and a larger engaged fan base and we must do this in a way which is self-sustaining and protects the long-term future of the Club. Our goals for the organisation are clear and unchanged: to support and fund on field success; and to enhance the fan experience. We are making progress on all fronts and the Club starts its 125th year in a strong position.”\n\n2. Arsenal Holdings plc Chairman’s Statement I am pleased to open my report to shareholders by confirming that a strong financial performance across the second half of the year means that the Group has delivered another profitable set of full year results. Strong financial performance is not an end in itself, but creates the platform from which the Club can build and sustain the on-field success which is always its main objective. On the pitch, the year has featured a number of competitive highs and lows whilst off the field the sad passing of our dear colleague Danny Fiszman has heralded a time of change. The team played some fantastic, entertaining football and mounted a strong challenge on four competitive fronts. We saw the emergence of a terrific new home-grown talent in the shape of Jack Wilshere and young goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny grabbed his chance to excel in the latter stages of the campaign. Although we were always battling against injuries to key players such as Cesc Fabregas, Thomas Vermaelen and Robin van Persie, some of our displays were memorable. My personal highlight was the inspirational clash with Barcelona in a packed Emirates Stadium. Although we went on to lose that Round of 16 tie, the first leg victory was a spectacular evening and one of the best games many of us have ever seen. Defeat by Barcelona in the second leg triggered a challenging spell with the frustration of defeat in the dying moments of the Carling Cup Final against Birmingham City followed by our 6th round FA Cup exit at the hands of Manchester United. Despite those setbacks, we continued to compete in the race for the Barclays Premier League title right up to the closing games. Ultimately, a fourth placed finish felt less than our performances deserved but it was still notable for the fact it gave us a route to the UEFA Champions League for a remarkable 14th season in succession. This is a record of which we are justly very proud. I would like to pay tribute, once again, to the Arsenal Ladies as they collected the FA Women’s Cup for the 11th time, the FA WSL Continental Cup and were the inaugural winners of the Women’s Super League. We continue to run the Club effectively, in a way which will be sustainable over the long- term, and, as you will read in the following pages, we have had a robust financial performance, reporting a profit before tax for the year of £14.8 million. This is lower than last year which was, in light of reduced incomes from player sales and from our property business, entirely to be expected. The landscape at the top of the game remains fiercely competitive. As such the Group’s future revenue growth is vital as we aim to drive increased investment into the team and hence provide the best opportunity for success on the field. With that imperative in mind we have continued our programme of building our head office capabilities – putting in place a top quality management and staff resource to drive long term future commercial success. We are beginning to see the first returns from this investment in the form of a successful Far East pre-season tour and a number of valuable new sponsorships and renewals. This is an\n\n3. Chairman’s Statement (continued) ongoing process, but the early results are very encouraging and give us reason to look forward with confidence. Another feature of the year was our partnership with Centrepoint, the charity which helps homeless young people. Through the ‘Be a Gooner. Be a Giver.’ campaign, the partnership raised more than £600,000. This exceeded the target set at the start of the year, to fund the refurbishment of one of Centrepoint’s facilities in Soho, and I’d like to congratulate everyone involved on a terrific effort. This year our Arsenal community suffered a profound loss with the death of our dear friend, fellow director, fan and inspiration Danny Fiszman. Danny was much loved by those who knew him, not just for his extraordinary vision and commitment driving Arsenal forward but because he was a respectful gentleman with a deep passion for the Club. We miss him deeply but his legacy will live with us forever in the shape of the Emirates Stadium. I was honoured to unveil the Danny Fiszman Bridge in acknowledgement of his outstanding contribution to the Club. On the same day I was also privileged to unveil the Ken Friar Bridge. Ken’s contribution to this Club is unsurpassed. For the past 62 years, from the age of 12, he has worked tirelessly for the good of Arsenal and it was entirely appropriate that he should be formally recognised alongside Danny. Both Danny and Ken embody Arsenal’s spirit of innovation and forward thinking and Danny’s passing heralded change for the Club and the start of a new era. Danny had agreed for his estate executors to sell his shares in the Club to Stan Kroenke. This prompted a wider offer from Mr Kroenke’s organisation, KSE UK Inc., which both I and my fellow board directors agreed to accept for our own holdings in the Club and to recommend to shareholders generally. This decision arose from no other desire than to protect the long- term interests of the football club we support and love. Following the offer KSE UK Inc. holds a controlling interest of 66.8% of the share capital of Arsenal Holdings plc. We have all grown to know Stan well during his three years as a fellow board member and we are confident he is the appropriate custodian to support the Club through the next stage of its evolution. That evolution will be built on the foundations that have been created over the 125 years of the Club’s history. This year we will be celebrating those enlightened individuals working at the Woolwich Arsenal who broke ranks to set up a football team to break the monotony of their daily lives. Back in December 1886 founder David Danskin had a vision to create a community around football, to give people a sense of purpose, fun and belonging. That vision has been the foundation of everything that has been achieved since. It is important that we mark this 125 year milestone, important that we pay tribute to our founding fathers and important that we recognise Arsenal Football Club will always be capable of bringing people together around a common cause. Ultimately Arsenal Football Club is here for our fans. Once again we had a full stadium for all of the Club’s home fixtures last season and passionate away support which I believe is second to none. I would like to thank those fans and indeed our fans from all around the world for their fantastic ongoing support. I also thank my fellow directors, our management\n\n4. Chairman’s Statement (continued) team and entire staff for all their hard work and dedication over the last year. I also fully recognise and appreciate the support from our sponsors and commercial partners. I look forward to welcoming you all again to Emirates Stadium over the course of this, our 125th season. P D Hill-Wood Chairman 30th September 2011\n\n5. Arsenal Holdings plc Chief Executive’s Report Overview As we enter our 125th year it makes sense to reflect on what has been achieved by our great football club and to look forward to what comes next. Arsenal Football Club was born out of one man’s vision to help his work colleagues break free from the daily grind of life in the Woolwich Armoury. David Danskin had an ambition to build a community of people with a kindred spirit and aim, namely playing football, having fun and being together. December 1st 1886 was the date. The Royal Oak public house in Woolwich was the venue. Mr Danskin could never have dreamed that Arsenal Football Club would achieve the fame and global reach it has today, but his original sense of community remains very much part of the Arsenal way. There are other common themes which have also carried through to the present day, notably a refusal to stand still and a desire for the Club to represent all that is the very best in the game. Our desire to drive the Club forward is critical in the current competitive landscape of European football. Other clubs are growing rapidly, expanding their international reach and fan base and using the revenues generated, or other resources, to enhance performance on the field. It has been said before but is worth repeating – standing still is not an option for Arsenal. Our primary objective will always be success on the field. To give the Club the best opportunity to achieve this, we must drive a virtuous circle of increased revenue, increased investment in the team and a larger engaged fan base and we must do this in a way which is self-sustaining and protects the long-term future of the Club. That has been my mission since joining the Club and we are making good progress. On the Pitch The 2010/11 season was one of considerable extremes. The team played some fantastic attacking football and mounted a serious challenge in all four competitions but ultimately we fell short of winning a trophy. The Chairman has referred to the victory over Barcelona in his report and I am sure that was a highlight for many of our supporters, as it was for me. The performance on the pitch coupled with the atmosphere in the stands and the hard work behind the scenes made it a night which the Club can reflect on with considerable pride. That high was followed by the pain of second leg defeat in the Camp Nou and a 6 th round FA Cup exit at the hands of Manchester United. In the Carling Cup we reached a Wembley final for the first time in 13 seasons but fate was against us as we went down to a late winner against Birmingham City.\n\n6. Chief Executive’s Report (continued) In the Barclays Premier League we remained in the running for the title right up to the closing weeks of the season. Ultimately, we finished fourth, securing UEFA Champions League entry for the 14th season in succession, a remarkable feat in an increasingly competitive environment. The Arsenal Ladies enjoyed another hugely successful season, lifting the Women’s FA Cup for the 11th time and then going on to win the first ever Women’s Super League. A 3-1 victory over Liverpool in the final game gave them the Super League title. They completed a treble by beating Birmingham City to collect the FA WSL Continental Cup. This is a fantastic achievement and one that ensures Arsenal Ladies remain the pre-eminent force in the women’s game here in the UK. The new season started with the Emirates Cup, which was again a resounding success, with 115,000 fans enjoying four games across an entertaining weekend. It was a pleasure to see Thierry Henry, a true Arsenal legend, back on the Emirates Stadium turf as his New York Red Bulls side lifted the trophy. During a very busy summer transfer window we have added some significant talent to the squad in the shape of Mikel Arteta, Yossi Benayoun (season loan), Gervinho, Carl Jenkinson, Per Mertesacker, Ryo Myaichi, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Ju Young Park and André Santos. In addition, we now have Aaron Ramsey back available for selection and we have seen Emmanuel Frimpong become the latest youngster to make the transition from our youth programme into first team reckoning. At the same time we have said goodbye to Cesc Fabregas, Samir Nasri, Gael Clichy and Emmanuel Eboue. We thank them for their contributions to Arsenal and wish them well with their new Clubs. As I write, the new season is entering its second month. There is no doubt that we have had a tough start to the 2011/12 campaign but we have won through an awkward UEFA Champions League qualifier, against Udinese, and we remain confident in the quality within the squad and of our prospects for the rest of the season. Business Update Once again the financial results for the year, which are covered in more detail in the Financial Review section, are sound. Whilst profits are lower than last year, due to a reduced level of exceptional gains from player sales and from our property business, this was expected. We continue to be in excellent shape financially and well set for future growth. It is important to remember our business goal is to increase revenues for ongoing investment in the team and across the Club. We have a clearly defined plan to take the Club forward and I am pleased with the progress we are making.\n\n7. Chief Executive’s Report (continued) The capability of our staff will be vital to the successful delivery of our commercial plans and, accordingly, we have continued to recruit expert staff in the areas of Information Technology, Partnerships, Human Resources, Marketing, Retail, Hospitality and Communications. Our investment in new head office staff across the last two years has not been made lightly but with a clear objective of delivering a sustained period of business growth. I am pleased to confirm that, although we are only in the early stages of our plan to drive commercial revenue growth, we are already generating incremental commercial revenues which exceed our investment made in new staff. During the year we completed the biggest research study ever conducted by the Club. We examined and talked in detail to our various categories of fan and analysed their Arsenal experience, what they love about the Club and where they think we can improve. This comprehensive and valuable research will inform our thinking as we move forward and it is already coming to life through changes in the way we interact with our fans day to day, the experience we create at the Emirates Stadium and how we operate as an organisation. Underpinning our thinking is the recognition that Arsenal Football Club is about making people proud to be part of the Arsenal community. Whether he or she is the fan who travels around the world to watch every game, or the fan who cheers us on from a settee in London or a bar in Singapore, or the member of staff who works for the Club day to day, our aim must be to make them feel proud to be a part of our club. That pride is clearly driven to a significant extent by results and performances on the pitch but it is about more than only this. It is about the way we run the Club day to day, it is about our contribution to communities around the world, it is about the way we treat people, it is about the memories we create. We must strive to represent our fans in the way they would wish to be represented and to reflect their highest aspirations of what their club should be. I believe our fans are proud of the fact that Arsenal’s successes are achieved in a responsible and sustainable way, a way that other clubs around the world seek to emulate, and a way that is good for the game of football. Partnerships One of the areas where our investment in people has begun to generate growth is in the area of commercial partnerships. Historically, like most football clubs, we have created value by selling to partners what was effectively advertising space in varying shapes and forms. Partners today, however, are increasingly focused on creating value in their sponsorships and this requires Arsenal to have a much deeper understanding of a partner’s business objectives and clear proposals for how we can work closely with them to help them achieve their objectives. This progressive approach has attracted the likes of Italian white goods manufacturer Indesit, who have signed a three year agreement with us. In addition, Citroen has renewed its partnership at an increased value and we have also signed contracts in recent months with Carlsberg, Thomas Cook and on-line gambling firm Bettson.\n\n8. Chief Executive’s Report (continued) Our two main sponsorship relationships – Nike and Emirates – helped to secure the move to the Emirates Stadium and remain contracted through to 2014. We have developed an excellent relationship with both partners and have worked very closely with them over the years. There is important work that we can and are doing now with Nike and Emirates to ensure that we can continue to maximise the value of those relationships when these sponsorships come up for renewal. Another important area of focus is the development of our broadcast programming and content development. This is a key component of our drive to build on our engagement with fans around the world. We have continued to invest in our website, our media production capability and our partnership with MP&Silva, a leading international sports media company that manages and distributes television and media rights around the world, is developing well. Arsenal programmes are now being broadcast in 88 territories around the world, reaching an estimated 110 million households. This is in addition to the extensive exposure we receive through global broadcasts of the Barclays Premier League. Membership Building our Club membership is another key area as we move forwards. We have now included the re-branded Arsenal Player, our in-house television programme, into the package of benefits offered to our 200,000 paying Arsenal members. This package also includes increased access to match day tickets - in the coming season twice as many tickets will be open to Red Members compared to previous years. In addition we have developed a highly successful Junior Gunners road-show, which has toured southern England during the summer, giving thousands of young supporters a behind the scenes glimpse of life at Arsenal. Asia Tour This summer the Club made its first long distance pre-season tour in twelve years, travelling to Malaysia and China. This was an important development as we look to build our fan base around the world and to deliver value to our commercial partners. The tour was a great success and a remarkable experience for everyone involved. Our fans in Asia showed unbridled passion and love for Arsenal whilst displaying in-depth knowledge of the players and Club. We played in front of 65,000 fans in Kuala Lumpur against a Malaysia XI, winning 2-1 and followed that with a 1-1 draw against Hangzhou Greentown in China. The games were useful in terms of early preparation for the season ahead but, more significantly, I am confident that the tour helped us create a platform for future development in Asia. The fact more than 2.5 million people joined a web chat involving Bacary Sagna and Thomas Rosicky and that we had more than 270,000 fans register for our website in China in less than a month underlines the opportunity which we have in this part of the world.\n\n9. Chief Executive’s Report (continued) Stadium Development We have completed a second year of work designed to improve the experience fans have when they visit Emirates Stadium. This is an ongoing programme, which we are developing in consultation with our supporters, and over the last year: we have dedicated the two bridges leading to the stadium to Danny Fiszman and Ken Friar; we have developed a series of fan tributes to star players, past and present, which now adorn the lower surrounds of the stadium; we are flying flags in tribute to key fans and Club figures; we have continued our development of the Club Tier with the introduction of the new 49ers bar; and we have created new “super-boxes” to meet the needs of some of our corporate supporters. There are more plans in the works for some iconic additions to the stadium surrounds which will be unveiled later this season to mark our 125th anniversary. The feedback from fans has been strong and positive and we will continue to look for more ways to keep our magnificent home at the forefront of modern stadia thinking as we move forward. Community Activities Our Charity of the Season was Centrepoint and through the ‘Be a Gooner. Be a Giver.’ campaign, we raised over £600,000. This was a magnificent achievement and my thanks go to everyone who offered their support. The Club continues to place great importance on its work in the community by offering and supporting a variety of innovative social inclusion, education and sport programmes around Islington and beyond. I am delighted to report that this community work has again been formally recognised with: three National Kickz Awards 2010; the Elthorne Park Cruyff Court winning the Mayor of London’s Safer Parks Gold Award; and the Double Club education scheme acknowledged for “Outstanding Commitment as Business Language Champions”. I’d like to congratulate everyone involved in those particular projects and our community team in general for another year of outstanding work.\n\n10. Chief Executive’s Report (continued) During the year ahead the Club will be partnering with Save the Children. We will support the charity on a range of education projects designed to help the poorest children, both in the UK and overseas, get a better start in life. We look forward to a successful programme of activity. Prospects Once again, we have started the new season with general admission and Club Tier season tickets fully subscribed. In addition and encouragingly, we have begun to see the early stages of growth in our commercial revenues from the Far East tour, from sponsors and from our retail business. During the close season we have again committed funds to the improvement of our stadium facilities and the training ground facilities at London Colney. The summer months have seen a period of intense activity in the transfer market. Clearly that activity will be judged by results on the field but it also needs to be considered in terms of both the transfer fees paid and received and the movement in contracted wage commitments. Overall we have made a significant net investment in the development of the playing squad. We continue to invest in outstanding young players as part of our core strategy but we have also added players of considerable experience in this transfer window. This mix of youth and experience is powerful and we have always invested in players with the quality which Arsène Wenger believes can help take the team forward. We are confident that we have a squad that can and will meet the challenges of what is sure to be an exciting and very competitive season domestically and in Europe. Off the field, our goals for the organisation are clear and unchanged: to support and fund on field success; and to enhance the fan experience. We are making progress on all fronts and the Club starts its 125 th year in a strong position. Arsenal Football Club strives to strike the right balance between short-term objectives and long-term success. We continue to work hard to get that balance right each day as we aim to take the Club forward and make everyone proud to be part of the Arsenal family. I E Gazidis Chief Executive Officer 30th September 2011\n\n11. Arsenal Holdings plc Financial Review At this time last year the Group reported record financial results for the 2009/10 year. Those results were driven by the inclusion of two particular one-off items - significant profits from player sales and a peak in the property trading activity at Highbury Square - and the 2010/11 results are, inevitably, at a lower level. Strong financial performance in the second half of 2010/11 means that the losses reported for the first half of the financial year have been converted into a full year pre-tax profit of £14.8 million. This was a result of both the football and property business segments delivering positive contributions. 2011 2010 £m £m Group turnover 255.7 379.9 Operating profit before depreciation, player 50.5 72.0 trading and exceptional items Exceptional items 4.8 - Depreciation (12.5) (11.9) Player trading (14.6) 13.6 Joint venture 0.8 0.5 Net finance charges (14.2) (18.2) Profit before tax 14.8 56.0 During the year under review the amortisation of player registrations was only partially offset by profits on the sale of player registrations, the main contribution to which was from the sale of Eduardo. As a consequence, there was a net loss on player trading of £14.6 million (2010 – net profit of £13.6 million). Net finance charges have been reduced to £14.2 million (2010 - £18.2 million). The lower cost reflects the fact that our property business was debt free throughout 2010/11 and, therefore, represents the fixed cost of our stadium finance bonds net of the interest earned on our bank deposits. Having paid off its bank loans during the prior year, our property business has continued to be strongly cash generative. As a consequence, at the balance sheet date, the Group’s cash and bank balances amounted to £160.2 million (2010 - £127.6 million) and the Group’s overall net debt was £97.8 million (2010 - £135.6 million).\n\n12. Financial Review (continued) Football Segment 2011 2010 £m £m Turnover 225.4 222.9 Operating profit before depreciation, player 45.8 56.8 trading and exceptional items Player trading (14.6) 13.6 Profit before tax 2.2 44.8 There were 28 home fixtures (19 Barclays Premier League, four UEFA Champions League, three e.on FA Cup and two Carling Cup). This was one more game than in the prior year but the mix of games was less favourable with two less games played in the Champions League. As a result, match day revenue was slightly lower at £93.1 million (2010 - £93.9 million). The average ticket sales per game was 59,849 (2010 – 59,765). Broadcasting revenues were also little changed overall at £85.2 million (2010 - £84.6 million) with the earlier exit from the Champions League compensated by the media revenues associated with our FA Cup and Carling Cup campaigns and a better £:€ exchange rate on converting Champions League distributions from UEFA. Combined retail and commercial revenues were slightly increased at £46.3 million (2010 - £43.9 million) reflecting some positive early returns on initiatives implemented by the new management teams in these areas. We have indicated in previous reports the continuing upward pressure on player wage costs and, in addition, we have continued to invest in developing the commercial and support staff to deliver significant revenue growth for the Club over the next few years. These factors combined to produce a full year wage cost of £124.4 million (2010 - £110.7 million) which represented 55.2% of our football revenues (2010 – 49.7%). Our investment in player wages, which means not just a significant current cost but also represents a high level of committed future cost, is underwritten by our accumulated property profits and cash reserves. Other operating costs, which include all the direct and indirect costs and overheads associated with the Club’s football operations and revenues, fell slightly to £54.5 million (£55.0 million).\n\n13. Financial Review (continued) Property Segment 2011 2010 £m £m Turnover 30.3 156.9 Operating profit before exceptional items 4.7 15.2 Reversal of impairment provision 7.9 - Profit before tax 12.6 11.2 Turnover from property was derived from the continuing sale of flats in the Highbury Square development. Sales progress has been steady as we have sought to achieve value rather than sell off the remaining flats at the fastest possible rate. 69 flats were sold during the period bringing the cumulative sales up to 639 of 655 market housing apartments within the development. We have commenced construction and refurbishment works on a small number of properties owned by the Group in the roads immediately adjacent to Highbury Square and this project will deliver some 21 additional property units for sale from spring 2012. Visitors to Emirates Stadium will be aware of the extensive construction works ongoing to the south at Queensland Road. These works are being undertaken by Newlon Housing Trust following our sale of part of the site to them in February 2010. The area of the site to the north east and adjacent to the stadium podium is now being cleared and remediated in readiness for completion of the sale contract, exchanged with Barratt in June 2011, for three towers of market residential accommodation. Although the revenues and costs associated with the Barratt contract will not be recognised in the profit and loss account until legal completion occurs, likely to be in summer 2012, the value of the contract means that part of the impairment provision previously booked against the site can be released and £7.9 million has been credited in the current year results in this respect. We continue to work with Islington Council’s planning department to determine the optimum development schemes for our two remaining property sites on Hornsey Road and Holloway Road. Profit after Tax The tax charge for the year was £2.1 million (2010 – credit of £5.0 million). The effective rate of taxation of 14.5% benefits from the revaluation of the Group’s deferred tax liabilities to the 26% rate of corporation tax effective from April 2011. The retained profit for the year was £12.6 million (2010 - £61.0 million).\n\n14. Financial Review (continued) Emirates Stadium During the year we continued to invest in our stadium and player facilities. Expenditure of £9.6 million on fixed assets included the major redevelopment of the dining and hospitality facilities within one quadrant of Club Tier, further Arsenalisation initiatives throughout the stadium including the return of the Clock End and the construction of a state of the art medical and rehabilitation centre at the first team’s training ground at London Colney. Financial Fair Play The 2011/12 financial year will be the first to be included in the break even monitoring arrangements being introduced as part of UEFA’s Financial Fair Play initiative. At the core of these new regulations is a requirement for clubs to balance revenues and costs and to operate their football businesses on a self sustaining basis. This has consistently been our approach and, accordingly, the Club is well placed to comply with UEFA’s new regime. Stuart Wisely Chief Financial Officer 30th September 2011\n\n15.
