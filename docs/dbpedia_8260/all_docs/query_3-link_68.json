        "text": "The 2024/25 Championship campaign is here and talkSPORT brings you a cracker between Leeds and Portsmouth this afternoon.\n\nPompey are finally back in England's second tier after 12 years battling in League One and Two.\n\nAnd John Mousinho's men couldn't have been handed a harder start than a visit to Elland Road.\n\nLeeds will most likely be promotion challengers again, but after losing several key players over the summer, things aren't as positive as they were last year.\n\nDaniel Farke's side were beaten 1-0 by Southampton in the play-off final last season, meaning they didn't automatically return to the top-flight at the first time of asking.\n\nBut the pressure will be back on them this year, and a win here would be the ideal start.\n\nLeeds vs Portsmouth: Pompey's return\n\nPortsmouth are a traditional and proud football club who won the FA Cup as recently as 2008.\n\nUnfortunately, due to poor ownership and financial decisions, Pompey were plunged into administration and were duly relegated from the Premier League.\n\nThings went from bad to worse when they were dumped out of the Championship in 2012 and started the 2013/14 season in League Two.\n\nSince then, it's been a long, hard slog to get back into England's second tier.\n\nPompey have some of the country's best fans, who travel everywhere in huge numbers, so it's great to have them back in the Championship.\n\nThey will no doubt prove to be a valuable addition.\n\nThis will be the first league meeting between Leeds and Portsmouth since February 2012, and a goalless draw at Fratton Park.\n\nPortsmouth have won just one of their last seven away league games against Leeds (D1 L5), a 2-1 Premier League win in April 2004. Their last such visit to Elland Road ended in a 1-0 defeat in October 2011.\n\nLeeds vs Portsmouth: Date and how to follow\n\nThis Championship clash is set to take place on Saturday, August 10.\n\nKick-off at Elland Road is scheduled for 12:30pm.\n\ntalkSPORT will have live and exclusive coverage from west Yorkshire, with Faye Carruthers serving as your presenter.\n\nCommentary will come from Ian Danter and former West Ham striker Dean Ashton.\n\ntalkSPORT.com will also have all the reaction.\n\nTo tune in to talkSPORT or talkSPORT 2 through the website, click HERE for the live stream.\n\nYou can also listen via the talkSPORT app, on DAB digital radio, through your smart speaker and on 1089 or 1053 AM.\n\nOf the last 20 occasions Leeds have begun their league campaign with a home game, they’ve lost just once (W13 D6), going down 2-1 against Derby County in 2010-11.\n\nPortsmouth have only lost their opening league match in one of the last 10 seasons (W4 D5), going down 1-0 at Shrewsbury in 2019-20.\n\nThis will be Portsmouth’s first season in the Championship since 2011-12, a campaign in which a 10-point deduction ultimately saw them relegated to League One.\n\nLeeds vs Portsmouth: Team news\n\nLeeds XI: Meslier, Bogle, Rodon, Strujk, Firpo, Gruev, Ampadu, James, Rutter, Gnonto, Joseph.\n\nSubs: Darlow, Byram, Wober, Crew, Rothwell, Aaronson, Gelhardt, Piroe, Bamford.\n\nPortsmouth XI: Norris, Williams, Shaughnessy, Towler, Ogilvie, Pack, Dozzell, Lane, Lang, Silvera, Sorensen.\n\nSubs: Archer, Swanson, Stevenson, Moxon, Devlin, Lowery, Ritchie. Whyte, Saydee.\n\nLeeds vs Portsmouth: What has been said?\n\nPortsmouth manager Mousinho is still looking for more additions in the transfer window.\n\nHe said: \"Yes, the seasons starts in days but the window doesn’t close until the end of August.\n\n“There’s still plenty of time for us to bring players in, we do have to be focused on the short term though and make sure we can secure results.\n\n“It’s a really fine balance though, there’s still plenty in the pipeline so we’re not done yet, there’s quite a few options that we’re trying to pursue.”"
