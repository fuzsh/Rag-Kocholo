        "text": "Ex-Hull City goalkeeper Vito Mannone has been linked with a surprise move back to the MKM Stadium as the Tigers hunt around for a new goalkeeper.\n\nMannone currently plies his trade in France with Lille but played just six times last term with three of those coming in the Europa Conference League for the Ligue One side.\n\nNow 36, the former Arsenal stopper spent a loan spell at City earlier in his career when he played 33 times during the 2010/11 campaign having arrived from the Gunners at the age of 22 during Nigel Pearson's reign.\n\nREAD MORE: Tim Walter's sleepless nights as Hull City face critical week ahead of new Championship season\n\nThe vastly experienced Italian has a year left on his deal in Northern France and according to Sun journalist Alan Nixon, the Tigers have enquired about bringing him back to East Yorkshire.\n\nBringing in a new goalkeeper is a key task for City this summer given senior players Ryan Allsop and Matt Ingram have both left the club, while Ivor Pandur is yet to be in the Championship but will start Saturday's season opener against Bristol City.\n\nThimothee Lo-Tutala is returning from injury but Harvey Cartwright is out for a lengthy period of time after flying home from City's pre-season training camp in Turkey to undergo surgery on his injured hand. Under-21 stopper Owen Foster has been on the bench in recent games, but has not played.\n\nSpeaking after Saturday's 2-0 loss at Reading in their final friendly outing of the summer, boss Tim Walter admitted again that the goalkeeping position was an area to strengthen, as was everywhere else.\n\n\"We can talk especially about this player or this player or this position, but we need players in every position we need a progression,\" he said. \"I have to wait and I have to stay strong and it's what I did but losing games, I'm not happy about it.\""
