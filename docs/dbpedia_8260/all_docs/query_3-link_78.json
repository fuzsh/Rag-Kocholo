        "text": "Mesut Ozil's arrival at Arsenal in 2013 brought unrivalled excitement but lofty expectations at the same time.\n\nIn the six years that have passed, like Arsenal, he has had tremendous ups, despairing downs and more recently has been searching for his calling with Unai Emery at the helm.\n\nThe first blockbuster signing of the Emirates era, the German brought hope to north London. An instant icon, he had fans parading the streets following his announcement had to wait in anticipation for his debut after the September international break, but it was worth it.\n\nEleven minutes in and he was already living up to those lofty expectations set by his record-breaking £42million price tag. In behind the Sunderland defence and the assist tally was off and running as he squared for Olivier Giroud to finish; a great start.\n\nWith Aaron Ramsey also firing that season, Arsenal led a real title charge for the majority but fell off towards the end of the season. Top of the league in February, the hope Ozil brought to the side in his first season is a burden that has followed the club throughout the decade.\n\nTime and again the Gunners have made strides forward only to be knocked back.\n\nIn the 2010/11 season, Arsene Wenger had Arsenal playing brilliant football only to sit in second place behind Manchester United for almost four months to end up finishing fourth. The next year, after a 4-0 round of 16 first leg defeat to AC Milan, Wenger's side shot out the blocks and were 3-0 before half-time but yet again, couldn't get over the finish line.\n\nEven though the hope pushed onto Ozil's shoulders has been a burden, Arsenal finally deciding to spend big worked out almost instantly.\n\nHelping the club snap it's nine-year trophy drought in the 3-2 FA Cup Final victory in 2014, they were no longer the nearly men. Now, they could actually get over the line and of course, with that came more expectation.\n\nAs the expectation grew around the halfway point of the decade, however, Ozil and Arsenal finally looked to be growing as a side.\n\nThe German himself had just won the World Cup, had an injury lay-off but came back seemingly stronger whilst still able to supply a killer pass. Santi Cazorla and Francis Coquelin anchored him superbly as Hector Bellerin and Nacho Monreal began to emerge as promising full-backs but there was another ingredient that made it all tick. Alexis Sanchez took the Premier League by storm that year and by the time everyone had gelled, Arsenal were ready for another title push.\n\nInstead of running away with the Premier League in the 2015/16 season, it was more of the same. Close, well closer, but still no cigar.\n\nEnding the season with 19 assists, what seemed like his most important at the time came on Valentine's Day. Five minutes into added time at home to Leicester, when the moment came, he produced. Whipping his free kick into the box for Danny Welbeck to brush home, the Emirates went into pandemonium. Very rarely do Arsenal players jump into the crowd to celebrate but at what felt like a watershed moment it had to be done. Just like in his first season, however, the Gunners would slip away and ended up finishing 10 points behind the eventual champions, Leicester.\n\nEven though he starred that season with influential performances against all of the current top six apart from Chelsea, Ozil was now a nearly man. A single assist away from breaking Thierry Henry's record, the German can't be faulted for his contribution in that season but the Arsenal way of the 2010s had rubbed off on him.\n\nAs Wenger's major coup of the decade, even when the Frenchman's time at the club was coming to an end, Ozil still shone. The Gunners were still one of the best teams with the ball at their feet and even though they failed to meet the growing expectations that came with the three FA Cup triumphs, they could still blow teams away.\n\nIn this period, Ozil himself began to evolve by adding more goals to his game. Netting eight in the 2016/17 season, including against Chelsea, he was still very much the figure that the Gunners revolved around. Becoming more clinical in front of goal, he was producing even more memorable moments. His Champions League hat-trick against Ludogorets, his goal to put Arsenal 3-2 up against Liverpool at the Emirates and his volley against Newcastle solidified his place as an Arsenal icon even more than he already was.\n\nHowever, the final two years of the decade have brought a confusion that has enveloped Arsenal.\n\nMaking Ozil Arsenal's highest earner on £350k per week just months before Wenger parted ways with the club has backfired massively. Not only did the man that brought the German to the club leave but in appointing Unai Emery, a manager who doesn't seem to fancy Ozil that much, the club have been left in limbo for 18 months.\n\nPulling him off in his opening two league games against Manchester City and Chelsea, the Spaniard immediately created questions over his usage of Ozil. Since then, his treatment of the 31-year-old has been even more questionable. Eventually he was brought back into the squad last year but this season, the German was exiled for over a month before returning to the first team.\n\nAlthough Emery has kept Ozil in the squad recently, the confusion around that situation has spread to across the team. Heading into 2020, there have been rumours that both Granit Xhaka and Lucas Torreira could exit and on the pitch, Emery doesn't look like he has figured out how to make Arsenal tick as Wenger did earlier in the decade.\n\nAn amazing player stuck in an underachieving side, Mesut Ozil's Arsenal career has embodied the hope, expectation and confusion that has followed the Gunners through the 2010s. Even if he may not have reached the expectations set when he arrived in 2013, the German has left a mark in his time at the club."
