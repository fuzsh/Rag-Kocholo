        "text": "PSV Eindhoven and Arsenal both advanced to the knockout rounds of the Champions League after playing out a 1-1 draw at the Philips Stadion. The two teams had already qualified before kick off in the final Group B match but their encounter was an enjoyable and entertaining affair.\n\nMikel Arteta made eight changes to the starting line-up which meant the Gunners were disjointed through the opening stages but they created a couple of good chances with Eddie Nketiah opening the scoring. He collected a pass from Reiss Nelson before touching the ball into the box and slotting it into the far corner.\n\nAfter the break PSV responded with a simple pass up the pitch. Ricardo Pepi nipped in between William Saliba and Gabriel to receive the ball before setting up Yorbe Vertessen to guide in the equaliser. A lack on intensity from both teams meant the match meandered to its conclusion and the points were shared.\n\nRelive the match action below:\n\nPSV vs Arsenal live\n\nArsenal’s new look line-up secures draw against PSV Eindhoven in Champions League dead-rubber\n\nPSV Eindhoven draw 1-1 with Arsenal in the Champions League\n\nBoth teams have qualified for the knockout rounds\n\n83’ DISALLOWED! - Kiwior’s header is ruled out for offside (PSV 1-1 ARS)\n\n68’ POST! - Saibari strikes the woodwork for the hosts (PSV 1-1 ARS)\n\n50’ GOAL! - Vertessen slots home the equaliser (PSV 1-1 ARS)\n\n42’ GOAL! - Nketiah’s fine finish gives the Gunners the lead (PSV 0-1 ARS)\n\n36’ SHOT! - Pepi’s effort is blocked by Saliba (PSV 0-0 ARS)\n\n18’ POST! - Vertessen leaps and nods one onto the post (PSV 0-0 ARS)\n\n6’ CHANCE! - PSV get the first opportunity to score through Van Aanholt (PSV 0-0 ARS)\n\nPSV Eindhoven 1 - 1 Arsenal FC\n\nArsenal’s new look line-up secures draw against PSV Eindhoven in Champions League dead-rubber\n\n20:12 , Mike Jones\n\nArsenal’s much-changed side were lucky to leave the Netherlands with a 1-1 draw in their dead-rubber Champions League tie against PSV Eindhoven.\n\nA goal apiece either side of half-time saw the top two in Group B share the spoils as Eddie Nketiah’s first Champions League goal was cancelled out by Yorbe Vertessen’s smart finish in a draw.\n\nManager Mikel Arteta said on the eve of the game that, whoever represented Arsenal had a “duty” to win – but his unfamiliar XI were second-best for much of the night.\n\nArsenal had already secured top spot in Group B, with PSV assured of qualifying alongside them, and the Gunners showed eight changes to the five alterations made by the hosts.\n\nArsenal secure draw against PSV Eindhoven in Champions League dead-rubber\n\nFT PSV 1-1 Arsenal\n\n20:06 , Mike Jones\n\nFT PSV 1-1 Arsenal\n\n20:02 , Mike Jones\n\nFT PSV 1-1 Arsenal\n\n19:56 , Mike Jones\n\nIsmael Saibari was been named Player of the Match with Uefa’s Technical Observer Panel saying: “Really strong performance from the PSV man and he was often the instigator of their dangerous attacks.\n\n“He was unfortunate to hit the post and is a great talent for the future.”\n\nFull-time! PSV 1-1 Arsenal\n\n19:40 , Mike Jones\n\nThe whistle goes to end the match and the teams settle for an entertaining draw. The stakes were low but the atmosphere intense.\n\nA goal either side of the break gave both sets of fans something to cheer about and there weren’t any major injury concerns to worry about of either manager.\n\nArsenal finish top of Group B with PSV Eindhoven in second place. Both teams are heading into the knockout rounds.\n\nPSV 1-1 Arsenal\n\n19:36 , Mike Jones\n\n90+3 mins: Declan Rice gives the ball away deep inside his own half but recovers brilliantly to spare himself a few blushes. Arsenal are content to maintain possession now, their main aim is to avoid any injuries and see out the game.\n\nPSV 1-1 Arsenal\n\n19:34 , Mike Jones\n\n90 mins: Six minutes of added time to play before the end of the match.\n\nPSV 1-1 Arsenal\n\n19:32 , Mike Jones\n\n87 mins: A nice twist from Leandro Trossard earns him a touch of space in a central area and he fanices taking on a shot at goal. He strikes the effort well enough but the ball is always rising and sails over the top.\n\nPSV 1-1 Arsenal\n\n19:27 , Mike Jones\n\n83 mins: Almost. Disallowed goal!\n\nThe Gunners win a free kick over on the left side of the pitch that Martin Odegaard swings into the box. Gabriel is in an offside position as the ball comes towards him.\n\nJakib Kiwior leaps in front of him and turns the ball into the back of the net but Gabriel was interfering with play and the goal is chalked off after a VAR check.\n\nPSV 1-1 Arsenal\n\n19:24 , Mike Jones\n\n80 mins: Inside the final 10 minutes now and there’s nothing to separate the two teams but the hosts are the ones knocking at the door and chasing a winner.\n\nThey were in the ascendancy in the first half too when Arsenal scored. Will history repeat itself?\n\nPSV 1-1 Arsenal\n\n19:23 , Mike Jones\n\n78 mins: Ben White blocks Pepi’s first effort at a cross before the second is floated over towards the back post. Jakub Kiwior sticks to his marker brilliantly and has enough strength to keep the forward from leaping fully towards the ball.\n\nIt drops over the heads of both men and Arsenal can clear their lines.\n\nPSV 1-1 Arsenal\n\n19:20 , Mike Jones\n\n75 mins: Bakayoko flicks the set piece over to the back post but Rice is there to meet the ball in the air and nod it clear. Arsenal’s counter-attack doesn’t quite materialise but they manage to keep hold of the ball high up the pitch.\n\nPSV 1-1 Arsenal\n\n19:15 , Mike Jones\n\n71 mins: Declan Rice has come onto the pitch and is playing as a centre-back. Bakayoko is clipped and brought down outside the penalty area resulting in a PSV free kick.\n\nBakayoko himself is standing over it...\n\nPSV 1-1 Arsenal\n\n19:11 , Mike Jones\n\n68 mins: POST! Ismael Saibari is denied by the woodwork.\n\nA fine run in behind from the PSV midfielder sees him picked out inside the box and he beats Aaron Ramsdale at the near post with a guided shot.\n\nThe ball rattles into the woodwork and bounces clear denying PSV the chance to go ahead.\n\nPSV 1-1 Arsenal\n\n19:09 , Mike Jones\n\n65 mins: Eddie Nketiah has taken a knock to the head and stayed down causing a break in play. There’s some concern for the Arsenal forward but he’s back on his feet and will play on.\n\nArsenal restart the match quickly with Havertz and Nelson combining. Nelson takes the ball into the box, shuffles onto his left and pings a shot into the side netting.\n\nPSV 1-1 Arsenal\n\n19:08 , Mike Jones\n\n62 mins: Mikel Arteta makes a triple change now with Declan Rice, Martin Odegaard and Ben White all coming on to replace William Saliba, Mohamed Elneny and Cedric Soares.\n\nPSV 1-1 Arsenal\n\n19:04 , Mike Jones\n\n59 mins: Close! Leandro Trossard does well to get the ball up to Eddie Nketiah from the left. The forward manages to turn the ball over to Kai Havertz who curls a pass over to the opposite side of the pitch for Cedric Soares.\n\nHe floats a cross into the box and picks out Nketiah who manages to nod the ball into the side netting. The Arsenal fans believed the ball went in but their bubble was popped pretty quickly.\n\nPSV 1-1 Arsenal\n\n19:01 , Mike Jones\n\n56 mins: A shot from Van Aanholt is blocked and comes back out to Tillman. He takes it over to the right and whips in a cross only for the ball to curl out of play.\n\nPSV 1-1 Arsenal\n\n18:58 , Mike Jones\n\n53 mins: Reiss Nelson has been impressive for Arsenal. He’s a bundle of energy, runs at speed and isn’t afraid to close players down. At the top end of the pitch he’s been one of the Gunners’ better players tonight.\n\nGOAL! PSV 1-1 Arsenal (Vertessen, 50’)⚽️\n\n18:55 , Mike Jones\n\n50 mins: Equaliser!\n\nA simple ball comes through the middle and bounces into the path of Ricardo Pepi. The forward nips in behind a sprawling William Saliba before taking the ball into the box.\n\nHe flicks it across to Yorbe Vertessen who finishes it calmly and puts his team back on level terms.\n\nPSV 0-1 Arsenal\n\n18:52 , Mike Jones\n\n48 mins: Close! Malik Tillman drives forward and takes the ball up the pitch. He knocks it across to Johan Bakayoko over on the right channel and the winger checks inside.\n\nHe lays the ball off to Yorbe Vertessen who takes a shot and scuffs his low effort wide of the far post.\n\nSecond half! PSV 0-1 Arsenal\n\n18:49 , Mike Jones\n\nPSV get the match restarted. There hasn’t been any changes at half-time from either manager.\n\nHT PSV 0-1 Arsenal\n\n18:45 , Mike Jones\n\nHT PSV 0-1 Arsenal\n\n18:41 , Mike Jones\n\nArsenal took a while to click after Mikel Arteta made eight changes to the starting XI but they’ve gone into the break with a lead after a superb strike from Eddie Nketiah.\n\nThere won’t be many changes at half-time and another goal for the Gunners may just kill off this match as both teams have already reached the next round.\n\nHT PSV 0-1 Arsenal\n\n18:37 , Mike Jones\n\nHalf-time! PSV 0-1 Arsenal\n\n18:33 , Mike Jones\n\n45+3 mins: Bakayoko draws a save out of Ramsdale who manages to palm the ball wide of the post and out for a corner. Arsenal defend it well and head into the break with their lead in tact.\n\nSo far so good for Mikel Arteta’s men.\n\nPSV 0-1 Arsenal\n\n18:30 , Mike Jones\n\n45 mins: Three minutes of added time to play at the end of the first half. PSV will be slightly annoyed after giving away the opener as they’ve started this match well.\n\nGOAL! PSV 0-1 Arsenal (Nketiah, 42’)⚽️\n\n18:27 , Mike Jones\n\n42 mins: Oh my!\n\nArsenal take the lead with their best move. They bring the ball down the right with Reiss Nelson and Cedric Soares doing the heavy lifting.\n\nNelson gets it back and slots a pass into the box for Eddie Nketiah. He takes and touch then smokes a well guided strike into the bottom corner.\n\nWonderful finish.\n\nPSV 0-0 Arsenal\n\n18:25 , Mike Jones\n\n39 mins: No goals at all in Group B so far tonight as Lens vs Sevilla is also goalless as the half-time mark edges closer. Mikel Arteta looks in thought on the sidelines.\n\nHe’ll be wanting his team to express themselves more in the second half.\n\nPSV 0-0 Arsenal\n\n18:21 , Mike Jones\n\n36 mins: A threaded pass through midfield takes the ball up to Ricardo Pepi who nudges it forward before slipping in Ismael Saibari. Saibari is closed down but not before offloading a pass back to Pepi.\n\nHe checks to the right and shoots but William Saliba manages to get across and block the shot.\n\nPSV 0-0 Arsenal\n\n18:18 , Mike Jones\n\n33 mins: Bakayoko sets up Teze to shoot from a long way out and the defender goes for it. He puts his laces through the ball but lifts it well over the crossbar without troubling Aaron Ramsdale.\n\nPSV 0-0 Arsenal\n\n18:16 , Mike Jones\n\n30 mins: Chance!\n\nArsenal’s first moment of joy comes through midfielder Mohamed Elneny. He touches the ball into space on the edge of the box and lets fly with a shuffling shot that skids off the turf.\n\nWlater Benitez dives over to the right and watches as the ball sails wide of the post.\n\nPSV 0-0 Arsenal\n\n18:14 , Mike Jones\n\n27 mins: Mohamed Elneny moves the ball across to the right where Cedric Soares is making a run down the flank. The defender collects the ball and looks for Eddie Nketiah in the box.\n\nHe’s overpowered by the closest centre-back, Armando Obispo by the looks of it, and the hosts turn the ball away.\n\nPSV 0-0 Arsenal\n\n18:11 , Mike Jones\n\n24 mins: Eddie Nketiah receives the ball and holds it up well before sweeping it across to Kai Havertz. He flicks a cross back into the middle where Leandro Trossard is waiting.\n\nThe ball doesn’t quite drop to him and PSV manage to clear the danger.\n\nPSV 0-0 Arsenal\n\n18:09 , Mike Jones\n\n21 mins: Arsenal are starting to get themselves together. Aaron Ramsdale clings onto another shot from range that got the home fans quite excited.\n\nThe visitors are starting to see more of the ball though they are yet to string together a decent opportunity.\n\nPSV 0-0 Arsenal\n\n18:04 , Mike Jones\n\n18 mins: Close! A hopeful ball up the pitch comes through for Pepi after Gabriel misses the ball with an attempted clearance. The forward takes it into the box and looks to cut one back for Yorbe Vertessen.\n\nCedric clears his lines but the hosts recover the ball and come again. The cross comes in from the right and does find Vertessen this time.\n\nHe leaps and nods the ball towards the far post, Ramsdale jumps across but can’t reach it and Arsenal are saved by the post!\n\nPSV 0-0 Arsenal\n\n17:59 , Mike Jones\n\n15 mins: Aaron Ramsdale is down and seemingly has a knock to his knee or shin. He’ll be desperate to play on and show what he can do tonight.\n\nAfter the physio checks and with a grimace the goalkeeper is back on his feet and ready to continue.\n\nPSV 0-0 Arsenal\n\n17:57 , Mike Jones\n\n12 mins: PSV’s vibrancy is all coming through Bakayoko. He’s not short on confidence at all and is willing trying to take on the Arsenal defenders.\n\nThere’s a bit of naivety to the winger too and he loses possession on the edge of the box instead of utilising the overlapping run from Jordan Teze.\n\nPSV 0-0 Arsenal\n\n17:54 , Mike Jones\n\n9 mins: Bakayoko whips a cross into the box from the right wing and almost picks out Pepi but Gabriel is there again to nod the ball clear.\n\nThe Arsenal centre-backs have been well worked over the opening 10 minutes.\n\nPSV 0-0 Arsenal\n\n17:52 , Mike Jones\n\n6 mins: Chance!\n\nThe first attack of the night falls to PSV. They use the width on offer and pick out Johan Bakayoko on the right side. He carries the ball towards the box and slots an early pass into the middle.\n\nPatrick van Aanholt is waiting for the ball but the combined efforts of Aaron Ramsdale and Gabriel keep out his effort. The ball rebounds to Ricardo Pepi but his shot is deflected too and loops over the crossbar.\n\nPSV 0-0 Arsenal\n\n17:48 , Mike Jones\n\n3 mins: Aaron Ramsdale is making his Champions League debut tonight and is forced into an early clearance after a back pass from Cedric Soares.\n\nThe goalkeeper keeps his composure under pressure well enough.\n\nKick off! PSV 0-0 Arsenal\n\n17:46 , Mike Jones\n\nArsenal get the ball rolling. The knock it around the back line and work it across to the left wing.

Ultimately, the stadium will be full again and we want to make our supporters proud.

Unai Emery’s side extended their club-record home winning run to 15 consecutive matches after adding the second of two of the finest victories Villa Park has staged within the same week.\n\nTriumphant against the champions on Wednesday, Villa knocked down the side who started the weekend as leaders on Saturday night. Though those wins may share the elements of magnitude and scoreline, they could hardly have been more different in how they were achieved.\n\nVilla’s energy and commitment was superb but Arsenal were wasteful and allowed three points and the chance to extend their lead over Manchester City to slip away.\n\nWith Arteta suspended from the touchline, Arsenal were unable to produce another late goal and the manager departed the directors box seconds before the final whistle after Kai Havertz’s equaliser was disallowed for handball. Moments later, Emery was dancing down the touchline, having beaten the club who sacked him after 18 months for the second time and first since his return to the Premier League.\n\nArsenal stunned by Unai Emery’s early trick as Aston Villa join the title race\n\nPSV vs Arsenal\n\n17:15 , Mike Jones\n\nArsenal have scored in each of their last 22 Champions League group stage matches, since a 2-0 loss against Borussia Dortmund in September 2014.\n\nNo side has netted more Champions League goals than them this season, while only twice have they scored more in a single group stage than their 15 this term (18 in both 2010/11 and 2016/17).\n\nPSV vs Arsenal\n\n17:10 , Mike Jones\n\nPSV have won their last two Champions League matches, as many as they had in their previous 22 (D9 L11). They last won three in a row in the 2006/07 group stages, in a campaign they would eventually reach the quarter-final after eliminating Arsenal.\n\nThe Dutch side are unbeaten on home soil in the Champions League this season, last going a full group stage undefeated at home in 2015/16 under Phillip Cocu, when they won all three games.\n\nPSV vs Arsenal\n\n17:05 , Mike Jones\n\nThe Gunners are winless in their last three major European visits to the Netherlands since a 2-1 win at Ajax in September 2005 in the Champions League.\n\nTwo of those defeats have come against PSV.\n\nPSV vs Arsenal\n\n17:00 , Mike Jones\n\nArsenal have faced PSV in competitive action on nine occasions, with seven in the Champions League as well as last season’s two encounters in the Europa League.\n\nThey have only lost two of those games, but both have on each of their last two visits to the Philips Stadion.\n\nArsenal pick ‘three big prospects’ for Champions League match at PSV\n\n16:55 , Mike Jones\n\nMikel Arteta has picked three rising talents from Arsenal’s Hale End academy to join the senior squad on their Champions League trip to PSV.\n\nReuell Walters, Ethan Nwaneri and Lino Sousa have travelled with the group and could make their Arsenal debuts in the dead rubber, with both clubs already qualified to the knockout phase and the Gunners assured of top spot in Group B.\n\nAsked if it has become harder to blood youngsters while challenging for honours, the Spaniard replied: “It gets harder and harder. So the talent has to be really good. (They are) three big prospects. We want to keep developing players from our system. They deserve to be here. There are circumstances that have brought them here. We will try to give them the opportunity if we can in the right moment.”\n\nArsenal pick ‘three big prospects’ for Champions League match at PSV\n\nArteta’s thoughts on PSV\n\n16:50 , Mike Jones\n\nThe Arsenal manager also gave his thoughts on how he feels PSV will play this evening saying: “It’s really impressive how [PSV] play, the consistency, the way they are winning football matches.\n\n“They’ve been extremely dominant, not only this season but last season as well and huge credit to the manager, the coaching staff and players for what they’ve done.\n\n“When you look at the record that they have here, it’s incredible so we’re going to have to be really good tomorrow to beat them.”\n\nArteta on Smith Rowe\n\n16:45 , Mike Jones\n\nInjuries have caused Emile Smith Rowe’s Arsenal career into a screeching half but the manager is backing him to perform when he is given minutes on the pitch.\n\n“I think what he’s been through is part of the experience that 90 per cent of footballers have to go through.” Arteta said,\n\n“Difficulties, injuries, setbacks and different types of performances now. That’s all in his bag now. If he can use that in a powerful way he’ll be a much better player.\n\n“The way he’s done his rehab, I haven’t seen him do it before like how he’s done it this time. You see the way his team-mates reacted to his comeback which is really positive as well. The moment we can give him chances, the better we’re going to be.”\n\nPSV’s super sub could trouble Arsenal\n\n16:40 , Mike Jones\n\nAmerican striker Ricardo Pepi is fast becoming something of a ‘super sub’ for PSV Eindhoven.\n\nThe 20-year-old has scored six times this season despite having only been on the pitch for a total of 239 minutes. That equates to a goal every 40 minutes.\n\nPepi’s most valuable strike so far was against Sevilla on Matchday 5, the forward scoring the dramatic late winner after coming on in the 82nd minute.\n\nArsenal team changes\n\n16:39 , Mike Jones\n\nMikel Arteta makes eight changes to the Arsenal team that lost 1-0 to Aston Villa last time out. The Gunners have already reached the Champions League last-16 so the manager is choosing not to risk most of his key players from the start.\n\nAaron Ramsdale starts in goal with Jakuk Kiwior and Cedric Soares at left and right back. In midfield Mohamed Elneny, Jorginho and Leandro Trossard take up their positions as Reiss Nelson and Eddie Nketiah join Kai Havertz in the forward line.\n\nPSV vs Arsenal line-ups\n\n16:36 , Mike Jones\n\nPSV Eindhoven XI: Benitez; Teze, Ramalho, Obispo, Mauro Junior; Tillman, Van Aanholt, Saibari; Bakayoko, Pepi, Vertessen\n\nArsenal XI: Ramsdale; Cedric, Saliba, Gabriel, Kiwior; Elneny, Jorginho, Trossard; Havertz, Nketiah, Nelson\n\nTonight’s venue\n\n16:32 , Mike Jones\n\nTurkish football league suspends all matches after club president punches referee in the face\n\n16:25 , Mike Jones\n\nThe Turkish football league has suspended all matches after a club president punched a referee in the face after his team conceded a 97th-minute equaliser.\n\nChaos erupted at the Turkish Super Lig game on Monday night at Eryaman Stadium between Caykur Rizespor and MKE Ankaragucu.\n\nOfficials from both sides entered the pitch after full time and moments after Caykur Rizespor scored an equalising goal in the 97th minute, resulting in a 1-1 draw.\n\nTurkish football league suspends all matches after club president punches referee\n\nPSV vs Arsenal prediction\n\n16:20 , Mike Jones\n\nMikel Arteta is likely to make a heap of changes to his Arsenal team but the Gunners should have enough quality in the squad to earn a win away from home.\n\nPSV 0-1 Arsenal.\n\nPSV vs Arsenal predicted line-ups\n\n16:15 , Mike Jones\n\nPSV Eindhoven XI: Benitez; Van Aanholt, Ramalho, Boscagli, Dest; Schouten, Veerman; Bakayoko, Saibari, Til; De Jong\n\nArsenal XI: Ramsdale; White, Kiwior, Gabriel, Cedric; Elneny, Jorginho, Havertz; Jesus, Trossard, Nelson\n\nEarly team news\n\n16:10 , Mike Jones\n\nPSV are without defenders Jordan Teze, Armando Obispo and Armel Bella-Kotchap who all sit out the game through injury.
