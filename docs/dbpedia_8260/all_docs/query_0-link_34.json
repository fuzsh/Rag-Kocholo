        "text": "Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta may be on the precipice of taking the youngest team in England’s top flight into the Champions League.\n\nIt is the consequence of a deliberate strategy: an attempt to rejuvenate the squad and kickstart a new cycle of success at a club who won the title three times in seven years from 1998 to 2004 but have not done so once in the 18 years since. The approach has already guaranteed a place in this season’s top six, but their sights are set higher still. The fillip of Champions League football come the autumn could be another catalyst in this young group’s development.\n\nBut how young are this side as compared to the rest of the league? And how does that compare to other seasons?\n\nThe Athletic has looked back at the past decade to see how this group’s performance fares when measured against other youthful teams from the recent past.\n\nIt’s remarkable that such a high proportion of the players Arteta has regularly used through 2021-22 qualify to play in this season’s Premier League 2 competition for clubs’ under-23s sides: Aaron Ramsdale, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Nuno Tavares, Martin Odegaard, Emile Smith Rowe, Bukayo Saka, Eddie Nketiah and Gabriel Martinelli are all young enough to have been fielded in the under-23s without impinging on the over-age player quota.\n\nArsenal have comfortably the youngest average age in the Premier League this season at 25.2 years — a full year younger than Brentford, the next youngest. Interestingly the clubs in closest proximity to Arsenal, Brentford and Southampton, are both regarded as hothouses of talent development. Arsenal’s project is somewhat different: they don’t intend to become a selling club to be picked over by the game’s financial superpowers but to develop and retain their stars.\n\nSo many of Arsenal’s direct competitors for European qualification have substantially older squads: West Ham United, Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United are all among the eight highest average ages in the league. It seems that at the business end of the table, experience is preferred. Tottenham (27.3) are a little younger, but still not close to Arsenal.\n\nThis should bode well for Arsenal, who could reasonably expect their performance level to improve as many of their squad move into their peak years.\n\nWhile this Arsenal team is the youngest in the Premier League this season, it is not the youngest in the top flight’s modern history.\n\nOf the top 20 youngest teams in the division since the 2010-11 season, they rank 15th, with Aston Villa’s 2012-13 team having the youngest average age of 24.1 years.\n\nIt is important to note how small the margins are between these teams, however, with Arsenal just a short gap away from the seventh youngest team — Sunderland in 2010-11.\n\nDespite not being the youngest Premier League team of the past 12 years, Arsenal 2021-22 are one of the best performing teams in this group. Their tally of 1.9 points per game is the second-highest since 2010, with Mauricio Pochettino’s 2016-17 Spurs team the outright leaders averaging 2.3 points per game.\n\nArsenal’s emphasis on youth this season was clear in their summer business.\n\nAlbert Sambi Lokonga, Tavares, Ramsdale, Benjamin White, Odegaard and Tomiyasu were all 23 or younger upon signing. White turned 24 in October and Ramsdale does so on Saturday.\n\nMixing these signings with promising academy graduates has paid off at different points in the season. Arsenal were heavily reliant on Saka and Smith Rowe to thrust them forward in the opening months.\n\nThe Athletic wrote a series of pieces looking at the age profiles for Premier League squads in November and for Arsenal, as well as having a significant number of players pre-peak years, that duo from the club’s Hale End academy stood out statistically.\n\nAs the season has progressed, the influence of other players has increased.\n\nRamsdale, Tomiyasu and White helped solidify the back line early while contributing in possession too. Odegaard began to find his rhythm in December and is now ranked second in the league for shot-creating open-play passes (94). On top of that, players signed from previous windows such as Kieran Tierney, Gabriel Magalhaes, both 24, and 20-year-old Martinelli are also having an impact.\n\nThe experience that comes in the shape of Granit Xhaka, Mohamed Elneny, both 29, Thomas Partey, 28, and 30-year-old Alexandre Lacazette has also been vital at different stages.\n\nLacazette is out of the side now due to what 22-year-old Nketiah offers in his place, but played an important role between October and the New Year, his game-changing cameo in the home game against Crystal Palace a prime example. Partey and Xhaka’s partnership helped the midfield run smoothly mid-season, while Elneny has helped shore things up recently to help Arsenal back into the top-four race.\n\n“It’s the team we’ve been building for the last two seasons and we’ve been trying to find the balance between the senior players, the experiences they had, their qualities, and the numbers we had to manage to get the best out of the group,” Arteta said on the make-up of the squad ahead of the north London derby away to Spurs tonight (Thursday).\n\n“It’s no different to the time I joined and hopefully we can do it.”\n\nInterestingly, Arteta the player joined Arsenal halfway through their two other youngest Premier League seasons since 2010.\n\nThe average age of 24.8 in 2010-11 was the sixth youngest across the league in our sample, but also the fifth most successful, averaging 1.8 points per game — a tally equalled in Arteta’s debut season at the club a year later (a squad with an average age equal to the current one’s 25.2).\n\nThe promise of that 2010-11 season, where Arsenal were six points off eventual champions Manchester United with six games to go, was backed up by the present and potential quality of that squad.\n\nThe settled starting XI was: Wojciech Szczesny; Bacary Sagna, Laurent Koscielny, Thomas Vermaelen, Gael Clichy; Cesc Fabregas, Alex Song, Jack Wilshere; Theo Walcott, Robin van Persie, Samir Nasri.\n\nOf that side, two were arguably the best in their position of Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium era (Sagna and Koscielny), three left in the summer of 2011 before winning multiple league titles elsewhere (Fabregas, Nasri and Clichy), two did the same a year later (Song and van Persie) while Szczesny’s successes have come in more recent seasons with Juventus in Italy.\n\nWhile that 2010-11 side was largely broken up and reassembled in the windows that followed, by contrast, there is the example of that 2016-17 Spurs team. The majority of that squad stayed together but grew stale in the late Pochettino era and failed to truly build on their title near-miss from the previous season and 2018-19 Champions League final appearance.\n\nThe fact that much of this Arsenal squad were either signed last summer or have been given new contracts in the last two years bodes well for the idea of individuals continuing to evolve at the Emirates, unlike their 2010-11 predecessors. Reinforcing that with quality in key areas is what will help build on the foundations of this season, with centre-forward and central midfield obvious areas for improvement.\n\nGiven the return to European football and the ramifications that playing this year’s World Cup in November and December will have on Premier League scheduling next season, the importance of that reinforcement is heightened.\n\nRegardless of the number of young players in the squad, Arteta has been able to be very consistent in his selection. That has presumably helped the less experienced players become settled in the side.\n\nSo far this season, Arsenal have named an unchanged XI in consecutive games on seven occasions — only West Ham have managed more, with Spurs also on seven. At the other end of the spectrum, Chelsea haven’t managed it at all (Tuesday and Wednesday night’s matches are not included in the table below).\n\nThe big outlier here in the chart above is Arsenal’s fourth game of the season — the home fixture against Norwich City in September. That is when Arteta made seven changes to his XI, bringing in a host of the new signings such as Ramsdale, White and Tomiyasu, and effectively rejuvenating his team.\n\nSince those sweeping changes, he has largely made small tweaks with the same trusted pool of players.\n\nThere’s a general trend of fewer changes as the season has worn on. This can be attributed in part to the slimming-down of the squad that took place in the January transfer window, and partly to Arteta settling on a preferred selection. Arsenal have doubtlessly been helped in this consistency by their lack of European football — and the fact they exited the FA Cup at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nThey are already qualified for the Europa League, and still hope to reach the Champions League for the first time since 2016-17. It will be interesting to see how this young team handle the demands of a busier fixture list next season. More rotation is presumably an inevitability for 2022-23. The size of the present squad (21 players) will not suffice when fighting on multiple fronts.\n\nWhatever happens next season, the achievements of this one can’t be taken for granted.\n\nArsenal have had to rely on young players throughout the year and they have delivered, whether it be Saka and Smith Rowe early in the year, Odegaard and Martinelli at the mid-point or Nketiah in recent weeks.\n\nThose players handling that pressure may surprise those on the outside, but they have all had to mature quickly before reaching this point.\n\nSaka’s bounce-back after his decisive European Championship final penalty shootout miss for England is the most obvious example, but Odegaard overcame large periods of disappointment at previous club Real Madrid, Smith Rowe played a key role in Huddersfield Town retaining their Championship status while on loan there in 2019-20, Nketiah fought to start at both Leeds United and Arsenal that same season, while Martinelli had a long-term knee injury to recover from in the second half of 2020.\n\nNone of them have had it easy and Arsenal have reaped the benefits of that this season, with those five players in particular all contributing at least 10 goals and assists combined across all competitions.\n\nNow it’s down to them to cash in on all that hard work and back it up in 2022-23.\n\nAdditional reporting: Mark Carey\n\n(Top picture: designed by Sam Richardson using Getty Images)"
