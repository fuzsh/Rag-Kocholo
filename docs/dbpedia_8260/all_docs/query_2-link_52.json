        "text": "Originally Posted by Ra_Z_Boy\n\nStill haven't seen the highlights yet but thoughts from my perspective:\n\nUnited:\n\nDefensively we were superb. I thought literally the whole back 4 played well. Vidic and Rio didn't put a foot wrong pretty much, won every header, dealt with every dangerous ball. Cleared their lines first time without fail when under pressure. Vidic with heroic block. Just brilliant.\n\nIn possession, we looked a bit panicky and we turned the ball over time and again carelessly however this is actually not ultra important in the scheme of things, certainly not as important as it would be to Arsenal from my next point below.\n\nWe played as we always do against Arsenal. Most of us would have predicted almost the exact line up and tactics beforehand yet same old Arsenal. Packed the midfield in front of our defence centrally, countered with width, played direct high tempo football going forward. Hey presto another deserved victory. The fact we were gtiving the ball away sloppily was not that important since we were basing our attacks on quick breaks, getting the ball to Nani and Park or directly to Rooney. This happened more than enough in very dangerous areas for us to not need that much possession and with our defense absorbing pressure as much as they did Arsenal weren't looking like threatening to score often even when in territorial advantageous positions.. I haven't checked the stats but I am sure it was close to 50/50 probably with Arsenal having the edge. But we could have had 35% and still been the more likely to score.\n\nPeople keep going on about the Clichy penalty incident. Whilst I couldn't see it clearly, I could see Chamakh's very clearly so I think a penalty for handball was evening things out, whether the decision was right or wrong. LOL Rooney.\n\nGoing through the players individually:\n\nVDS-Nothing to do apart from a few clearances and a couple of routine saves.\n\nEvra-Made vital interceptions, surged forward well, broke up play. Even won headers! Not dominant or anything but very happy with how he played considering his start to the season after the WC.\n\nVidic-Immense. Enough said.\n\nRio-Just like Vidic, this was Rio of old. Dependable, mistake free. Makes good forwards look very ordinary. Haven't seen the Sagna incident yet though, people are talking about it.\n\nRafael-Despite a few incidents with Wilshere were he got done he was very good I thought. He really is going to be a top class full back imo. He is able to get in front of his man from behind to intercept so well. Can break forward. Harry's people. Solid.\n\nFletcher-Mixed bag. Broke up play well, full of energy but a lot of poor touches and passes which put immediate pressure on the recipient due to innaccuracy, too much pace or simply choosing the wrong option. Not his best day imo but don't think Arsenal enjoyed facing him all the same.\n\nCarrick-As above. Didn't play that well although he was not able to play his usual midfield pivot role due to tactics and I thought he fought very hard to win balls. Moreso than usual. Wouldn't criticise his effort. There was one moment in first half thoiugh where he had all the time in the world and looked like he thought the whistle had blown or something and got robbed. Day dreaming? Dunno.\n\nAnderson-Beasted it imo. Very happy with his performance. So strong, powerful running, can win the ball too. Not sure of his best position but I think this slightly different role he has enjoyed since coming back from injury suits him more.\n\nPark-My main thought was the amount of off the ball work he does. You don't really get a full view of it on TV coverage but the constant movement and running, the change of direction and his attempts at creating space and holes for others makes it horrible for the opposition. Arsenal defenders were constantly trying to communicate about who was responsible for him, where they should be and he just made them nervous. He also worked his ass off in challenges. Not the best day he has had in terms of attacking penetration but again couldn't really fault him.\n\nNani-Mixed bag. Dangerous as always, potent threat when attacking but very frustrating on multiple occassions. Missed an absolute sitter when Clichy made an error. Failed to beat his man or find a decent cross a few too many times. This was the sort of game that fell right for Nani for him to be an outstanding man of the match but it didn't quite happen. Still had an important role.\n\nRooney-Despite the penalty miss thought he did ok. Not absolutely brilliant like last season but was a handful for the centre backs and provided an outlet for direct release of pressure much better than I would have expected as a lone front man. Couple of chances. **** penalty. Not bad. Hopefully he gains confidence and really turns it on soon though.\n\nArsenal-\n\nKeeper-Nothing bad to say. Didn't make any mistakes from what I saw.\n\nSagna-Did ok. In fact I think he was probably Arsenal's best player. Put in some poor crosses though and got muscled off the ball a couple of times by smaller men which is unlike him.\n\nClichy-He made some good tackles on Nani to get the ball off him but honestly I thought he was poor and it was more a reflection on Nani than him. Poor crossing, didn't offer much going forward except poor crosses. Meh.\n\nCentre backs-ok I admit, I struggled to tell who was who from my vantage point at times. Overall I think they both struggled to deal with Rooney and won nowhere near enough headers. Average.\n\nSong- I thought he was piss poor tbh. Provided very little cover to the defense as he was just stretched. Chased shadows.\n\nRosicky-Didn't notice he was playing. I am not even lying. I don't remember a single thing he did basically. Not helped by the fact as a home fan you are actively paying attention to your own players more but just added nothing.\n\nNasri-Considering his form I was surprised how little damage he did. I was scared every time he got the ball, if he had ran forcefully at our defense we would have been in so much trouble multiple times but he chose to cut back and pass. Arsenal did a lot of passing around about 25 yards out without ever looking to threaten the goal. Should have been more confident. Not bad by any means just not great.\n\nWilshere-Big game for him, up against United's midfield playing pretty well it was a tough ask of him. He's a bit green for this sort of game imo. Needs more strength.\n\nArshavin-Dangerous for the first 15 minutes but overall, lazy and greedy on the ball. Didn't want to know when it got physical. Resorted to fouling. He had nothing to worry our defense really.\n\nChamakh-Not his sort of game. I think where he is most dangrous, on the end of crosses, nodding it down for others etc Arsenal don't really allow him to show. He was called upon to recieve it along thr ground, hold it up, run at players etc which I don't think are his strengths. I don't think he is technically THAT good tbh, his touch doesn't seem that great.\n\nFabregas and Van Persie didn't look ready. When Walcott got the ball, Arsenal stopped. They didn't look to give him options, they must know what to expect. Same old complaints.\n\nSeems like I am overly praising United and overly criticizing Arsenal considering it wasn't exactly a dominant display or anything. Results orientated? Maybe. We were the better side and deserved the win but it was tight. Perhaps I am looking at it through rose-tinted specs but honestly I can't think of what else to say about the performances. Maybe there was something good about Arsenal players that I thought were poor that I missed I dunno. I am sure the Arsenal fans will let me know but thats my honest assessment."
