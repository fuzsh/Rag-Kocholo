Mikel Arteta has given his thoughts on Jack Wilshere's battles with injury ahead of Arsenal's Premier League clash with West Ham.

The midfielder came through the Arsenal academy and quickly established himself in the first team as an 18-year-old during the 2010/11 season. Picking up his first major injury in the 2011/12 pre-season, he came back in bursts for the Gunners but struggled to sustain a run over an entire season.

Leaving when his contract expired in June 2018 - the same summer Arsene Wenger departed - Wilshere joined West Ham for free. He's since played 14 league games for the Hammers with his last appearance coming in October's 2-0 loss to Everton when he played 27 minutes.

Having played with Wilshere for five years, Arteta gave his perspective of the injury troubles the 28-year-old has had over the course of his career.

"It's very sad with Jack. When I joined here and watched him play every day in training, you would say he could be one of the best midfielders," he said.

"He always had something, then he is starting to build again a career and then again another injury, again another setback and it was disappointing.

"I was very impressed with Jack. How strong he was mentally to deal with the situation because as well he had a lot of pressure from the media because the expectations for him were big, but it is what it is.

"He could have been phenomenal."

Wilshere has returned to the Emirates since leaving as his third game for West Ham was away at Arsenal.

Getting through the entire 90 minutes, the then 26-year-old had a good game despite suffering a 3-1 loss. On the ball, he completed five dribbles and all four of the long balls he attempted. In a team less used to having the ball, he was tasked with putting in more of a defensive shift and obliged by making two tackles and two interceptions on the day.
