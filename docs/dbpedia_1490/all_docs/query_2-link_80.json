        "text": "Aydan,\n\nThank you for remembering Teresa Thorne. I've been meaning to make mention of her being left out. I can't imagine why she's not listed. During filming in 1957, MacQuitty insisted on a full series of publicity photos showing Thorne with the real Edith Russell - and her pig.\n\nOne that you may be aware was displayed by the late Walter Lord in his home. Another, which I only have a newsclipping of, shows the two standing at the foot of the staircase on the movie set. The actress is in costume and Edy is examining it \"for accuracy\" the cutline says. Yet another press picture I've been told of (but not seen yet)shows Edy with Thorne seated in a lifeboat on the set.\n\nRandy\n\nAydan,\n\nThanks! Now I know why you're after the full cast list, and the sort of information you're looking for - not that I've got good news for you. It's been a while since I've read Macquitty's Titanic Memories, so I had a quick skim before responding.\n\nThe detail you're looking for just isn't in the book. It's an overview of the entire project, from concept to realisation to premiere and beyond. There's very little on the cast, even if it is bolstered with anecdotes about people, many of them featuring the marvellous Edith Russell - what a character!\n\nMost of the photos are from the production: cast, crew, special effects, storyboard, etc. There's also a full reproduction of the film's UK publicity brochure, including a cast list much shorter than that available elsewhere. It's also fair to add that the book is less than 50 pages in length, just under a third devoted to reproducing the publicity brochure.\n\nFor what it's worth, the making of ANTR would seem to be the best source of information on the cast. And you've already seen that.\n\nAs for the inaccuracy/imcompletion of the list on IMDB: is it still possible to submit updated/corrected information to the site? Several years ago I submitted some changes/updates to cast and crew information for one of the listings there, and it was used. The situation may've changed, but it may be worth a look.\n\nRandy - sadly MacQuitty hasn't used many of those photos you've described above, even if the book is quite well illustrated. I do wish it were a longer work."
