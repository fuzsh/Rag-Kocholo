The raindrops kissed the flower beds The blossoms raised their thirsty heads A perfumed thank you they seem to say! Surely here was charm beyond compare to view Maybe it was just that I was there With you! 'Twas just a garden in the rain, But then the sun came out again And sent us happily on our way! Surely here was charm beyond compare to view But, maybe it was just that you were there dear, You were so lovely! 'Twas just a garden in the rain, But then the sun came out again And sent us happily on our way! Just a garden in the rain!
