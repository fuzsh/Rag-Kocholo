        "text": "A January 12, 1920 U.S. Federal Census record reveals that Harry Auracher (34), musician in the theater industry, and wife Dorothy (27) were staying with friends in Manhattan.\n\n1920 U.S.Federal Census for Borough of Manhattan with Harry Auracher's entry divided into two parts for easier reading.\n\nLike most married women of her time, Dorothy Dyrenforth Auracher, who had been a Northwestern instructor, dancer, and aspiring actress before marriage, appears in the census as having no occupation.\n\nThe Aurachers' trip to Manhattan was not just a social visit.\n\nThe Frivolities of 1920\n\nReviews focused on the show’s vulgarity, its girls, and the likelihood of its success, not on its music.\n\nThe “Frivolities” is just a gigantic revue that is built up of vaudeville specialties with a big chorus and number here and there through it. There isn’t any attempt at any kind of a story and so it must be judged entirely from revue standards. As such, all that it needs is a little more comedy and some cutting and speeding here and there to make it a sure-fire for the box office. --Variety\n\nThere is plenty of life in The Frivolities of 1920, produced last night by G. M. Anderson at the 44th Street Theater. Much of it is low life, but it is all lively. There used to be a decided difference between the burlesque show and the Broadway revue, and the difference was more than one of mere costliness of production. That difference seems to be disappearing. The Frivolities of 1920 is really a very expensive burlesque entertainment. Our guess is that it will prove a great success. . . .\n\nThere is much expensive scenery, hundreds of bright costumes and all kinds of speed in the production. And the audience last night was loud in its applause and laughter. In fact, it is the sort of thing that appeals to those who are loud in everything. –Brooklyn Daily Eagle\n\nFrivolities of 1920, presented last night at the Forty-fourth Street Theatre, is big enough and noisy enough for that capacious playhouse, and has a lot of fun and activity. It is lucky the theater is roomy, for some of the revue needs the air.\n\nThe revue was born and brought up in Boston, which, as everyone knows, was once the centre of American culture. It ran gaily and successfully there for a month, and, it is to be feared, was somewhat demoralized by its sojourn in that rough city. There were some crude and ugly attempts at humor which will very likely be removed. . . .\n\nIt would be unjust to ignore a certain distinguished merit of the chorus; they had the best collection of legs ever seen outside a Ziegfeld production. There certainly is nothing wrong in having good legs and displaying them on the stage, and the chorus was no party to the revue’s dismal moments of impropriety. –New York Daily Herald\n\nHad Mr. Anderson been as spendthrift and energetic in providing expert showmanship and an atmosphere of good taste he would have an entertainment which might divert a part of the golden stream pouring into the Follies.\n\nThere is much that is of merit in the production, and when the worthy is on view some moments of real pleasure are to be had. But vulgarity stamps in too frequently and the real pleasure is forgotten in the amazing display of shoddy sallies at marriage and women and Congress and prohibition and bedroom farces.\n\nBut after all, the patronage of such a show as the Frivolities will depend chiefly upon its assemblage of girls. . . . A parade across a dimly lighted stage of girls ready for a plunge in the sea made an appealing incident to the palpitating elderly gentlemen in the front rows. . . .\n\nDoraldina transformed herself into jelly on two occasions, performing dances that make the exhibitions in the most reckless of burlesques show pale and insipid things in comparison. –New York Dramatic Mirror\n\nFrivolities of 1920 would run at the 44th Street Theatre through February and then go on tour.\n\nA few days after Frivolities' opening night, an advertisement in Evanston, Illinois’ Daily Northwestern attested to Auracher’s entrepreneurial success. With several orchestras to his credit, Auracher was now president with his own business agent to handle bookings.\n\nJanuary 14, 1920\n\nDespite Harry Auracher's success back home in Chicago, to garner attention and achieve comparable success in the musical theater world, he would need to do something different than Frivolities.\n\nFirst Known Recording of an Archer Tune\n\nI'm Gonna Quit Saturday, with lyric by P. D. Cook is probably the first recorded Archer tune.\n\nthe pair of songwriters couldn't have been luckier than to have famed Bert Williams interpret and record their song. It would be one of a handful of last Bert Williams recordings.\n\nListen to Bert Williams perform I'm Gonna Quit Saturday.\n\nBert Williams, 1921 or 1922. Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division\n\nFeist, 1921\n\nA Career Move, a Name Change, and Minor Shows\n\nAccording to sources to be revealed later, Auracher relocated to New York in February 1920 to join the staff at Feist Music. Aside from a series of Feist publications, I have found no information pertaining to his work for the firm.\n\nPitter Patter and Afgar, 1920\n\nAuracher was soon music director for another William B. Friedlander show, Pitter Patter, which opened at the Longacre Theatre on September 28, 1920, and closed on New Year's Day, 1921. He does not appear to have composed any of the show's music.\n\nIn November, Feist copyrighted Johnstone and Auracher's \"Be Yourself,\" a piece the pair must have considered for the 1919 show Love for Sale., They had first copyrighted it in lyric and melody form while similarly copyrighting other songs eventually harmonized and re-copyrighted with the Love for Sale show title. Unlike those other songs, \"Be Yourself\" had no second copyright until designated for the American production of an older French operetta titled Afgar. The show had opened in England in 1919 and was scheduled to open in the U.S. in 1920.\n\nThis proved to be more than a completed, re-purposed song. Ironically, the second \"Be Yourself\" copyright marked the Americanization of Harry Auracher's German surname, a new identity for the composer. Harry Auracher became Harry Archer.\n\nFirst copyright of Be Yourself\n\nSecond copyright of Be Yourself\n\nPeek-a-Boo, 1921\n\nHarry Archer also served as music director for Peek-a-Boo, an elaborate burlesque show produced by Jean Bedini at the Columbia Theatre. Archer teamed up with lyricist P. D. Cook to write the music.\n\nSix weeks before the show opened, a brief promotional item in Variety pointed out a theatrical \"first\": “[F]or the first time in the history of burlesque, the production music will be sold in the lobby and in music stores as with regular Broadway musical shows.”\n\nOpening May 16 for the \"summer\" season, Peek-a-Boo ran until July 2, the date that several theaters closed for the summer. The Columbia reopened in September for its regular season with Peek-a-Boo running twice daily for its first week. Among the show's performers drawn from vaudeville, the Seven Musical Spillers are probably best known today, at least by readers of Ed Berlin's Scott Joplin biography, King of Ragtime.\n\nFrom the outset, Peek-a-Boo received better reviews than most shows of its type and, unlike many burlesque shows, was viewed as appropriate for women and children. Variety commented on the music and expressed its opinion that Bedini should retain Archer for future shows:\n\nOther than the pop songs in the specialties, there is a specially written score, with “Hitch Your Wagon to a Star” quite melodious as the theme number. “Melody Dream Girl” is another fetching strain with a production end, various girls singing old songs as they are sent out to about the third row in the orchestra on what looks to be a duplex crane arrangement. This number is extremely well gowned. The Columbia can justly claim that Peek-A-Boo is the best laughing shown on Broadway, and at $1.50 Bedini can justly claim he has the best burlesque show ever turned out. . . . At any other Broadway house it could get $2.50, with just as many if no more laughs.\n\nHarry Archer wrote the special score. Bedini should tie him up.\n\nThe New York Tribune described Peek-a-Boo as “a succession of ingenious stunts that make up a good show, well received” and added that it ranged “from the regular burlesque joke stuff to a doll fantasy that verges on the classical ballet.”\n\nThe Tribune further took note of the show's jazz band. In one particularly unusual musical stunt, an alleged Italian from the Shipyards charged down the aisle and into the orchestra staging a fight before returning to the stage to “dance, sing and play several instruments with equal facility and agility.” As we will see later, this may have been one of Harry Archer’s early efforts to make musicians a part of the show rather than confining them to the pit.\n\nFeist again published the music, which also included not only \"Hitch Your Wagon to a Star\" and \"Melody Dream Girl,\" but also \"Cuddle\" and \"Ornamental Oriental Land.\"\n\nFollowing its run at the Columbia, newspapers from several cities indicate that Peek-a-Boo toured under the new name Chuckles of 1921.\n\nAdvertisement for orchestrations from renamed Peek-a-Boo\n\nMay and December and The Awkward Age, 1921-1923\n\nBy late 1921, Archer begun collaborating with Harlan Thompson. A former Kansas City Star journalist born in Hannibal, Missouri, Thompson had landed in New York City after serving in World War I. Although he worked at the New York World, Thompson's heart was in the theater where he dreamed of making a living.\n\nAccording to the March 5, 1922 Kansas City Star, Thompson was “devoting all his time to writing for the stage,\" and had several “playlets” touring on the circuits, including Indoor Sports, Broke, and May and December. Five years later, the New York Times explained that William B. Friedlander had first introduced Thompson to Archer in Friedlander's office.\n\nThat introduction had led to their collaboration on May and December, which had opened at Poli's Capitol in Hartford, Connecticut, in late 1921 before going on the United Booking Office (U.B.O.) circuit.\n\nNot much over twenty minutes long and performed as one act among several in the vaudeville houses where it appeared, May and December starred dancer Sheila Terry. According to the Los Angeles Times and Houston Post, the short play was more than just a dance act; it was a seven-scene romance--a description that sometimes appeared in advertisements. When the act played in Buffalo, New York, in November 1923, the Buffalo Courier described it as “a delightful dance novelty, the star assisted by a clever company of six people.“\n\nAlthough the brief play included Archer's music, it was not a musical, and I've found no details shedding light on Archer's contribution.\n\nSheila Terry in May and December, July 1922\n\nOregon Journal [Portland], May 7, 1922]\n\nThe Awkward Age ran concurrently although separately. With book by Herbert H. Winslow, lyrics by Harlan Thompson, and music by Harry Archer, The Awkward Age starred legitimate theater’s Eve Lynn and Clyde Dilson. Lyrics and dialogue focused on adolescence and told of “Hopes, disappointments and the lights and shades of a boy, a girl, and a mother.”\n\nBridgeport [CT] Telegram, May 22, 1922\n\nSince both short plays appeared as individual acts in multi-act vaudeville shows, they received little attention. However, Thompson-Archer collaboration, although seemingly trivial, would eventually lead to Broadway success.\n\nParadise Alley, 1922 and 1924\n\nThat time had not yet come. Archer was a busy man with another theater project underway or soon underway.\n\nOn August 15, 1922, the New York Times announced the previous day's opening rehearsal for Paradise Alley, a new show featuring Archer's music. Written by Carle Carlton, a former British band leader who had penned the recent hit Irene, Paradise Alley told the rags to riches story of two young East Side New Yorkers, one who rose to fame in the British theater and the other in the boxing ring. The boxer wanted his girl friend to sacrifice the stage for him, and she wanted him to walk away from the ring to join her in the theater.\n\nThe day after its Philadelphia opening, the Evening Public Ledger commented, \"Paradise Alley does not appear to be another Irene, even though Mabel Withee does impart to the heroine's role a great deal of charm and some real acting.\" The main problem, according to the reviewer, was that the show's excessive sentiment \"drowned out the comedy, and that's the element that's needed\":\n\nStories of New York tenement heroines who aspire to the stage but finally return to their prize fighting sweethearts are all very well, but they should be done in moderation. Paradise Alley is all sweetness and love. The songs are spoiled by the same token. Only Franklyn Farnum, with some nifty dancing, got away from the general spirit of \"tell it with loves songs.\"\n\nDue to low box office receipts during the Philadelphia tryout, the show temporarily folded.\n\nCarlton did not give up on the show. He hired Clare Kummer, said to specialize in wit, to trim the show \"up with sparkles.\" In March 1924, the revised Paradise Alley opened in Brooklyn.\n\nIn his Brooklyn Daily Eagle review titled \"Paradise Alley not a Bad Show, But It's None too Good Either, \" Arthur Pollock commented on the feature song and explained the show's primary weakness:\n\n\"Any Old Alley Is Paradise Alley\" is doubtless destined to be the hit among the show numbers. Carle Carleton, who produces the piece, wrote the music together with H. Archer and A. Otvos. . . .\n\nParadise Alley ought to be a moderate success in Manhattan. With a couple of exceptional performers in the cast it might prove an immoderate success. But the exceptional performers are not there.\n\nThe copyright record indicates Archer composed the melody but Carleton must have played some role in the finished music.\n\nFollowing Paradise Alley's Broadway debut at the Casino, Burns Mantle wrote a relatively positive review in the New York Daily News. After observing that musical theater has a set formula but that the \"mixing of the ingredients is important,\" he complimented Carleton for handling that task well. He then added:\n\nThe music has rhythm and melody. The name song, \"Paradise Alley,\" seeming good for a hit. A professional quartet helps the singing a lot.\n\nThe Daily News, April 3, 1924\n\nDorothy Dyrenforth Auracher Sues for Divorce\n\nShortly after The Awkward Age opened and before rehearsals for the original version of Paradise Alley, Harry Archer's wife in Illinois sued for divorce. On April 28, 1922, the Chicago Tribune carried the story:\n\nIn the bill, filed by her father, Mrs. Auracher charges that Auracher deserted her early in 1920, when he relinquished his business interests in Chicago and went to New York to become associated with the Leo Feist company, music publishers. The couple were married in 1913.\n\nMrs. Auracher has taken an active part in North Shore society, and attained considerable local fame for her classic and ball room dancing.\n\nAuracher formerly maintained offices in the Republic building, from which he directed the movements of his orchestras, which were popular several years ago. His opera, The Pearl Maiden, was enthusiastically received by audiences in New York, Boston, Philadelphia and other eastern cities, as well as in Chicago, where it had a successful run.\n\nMr. Dyrenforth, member of the legal firm of Dyrenforth, Lee, Chritton and Wiles, with offices in the Marquette building, refused to comment on his daughter’s action, except to confirm the fact that desertion was the basis of the suit.\n\nMr. Auracher is in New York, I under-stand, trying to compose or sell music,” said Mr. Dyrenforth last night. Mrs. Auracher is living with her parents for the time being at least.\n\nAn article reporting Harry's denial of her allegations also pinpoints the month of the alleged desertion--February 1920:\n\nNeither article gets the 1912 marriage date right, but that reporting Harry Archer's denial appears to pinpoint the month and year he moved to New York to began work at Feist.\n\nTwo other newspaper items raise a question about the accuracy of Dorothy Dyrenforth’s claims:\n\nOn July 24, 1921, The Daily Star (Queens Borough, NY) printed this small item: “Mr. and Mrs. Harry Auracher of Manhattan have leased the Ferry house on Third street for July and August.” Were the Aurachers living together during summer 1921, well over a year after Dorothy said Harry had deserted her?\n\nOn April 4, 1923, the Chicago Tribune reported that “Mrs. D. D. Auracher of New York will be the matron of honor” at the wedding of her sister Miss Carroll Dyrenforth, Evanston, Illinois. What was she doing living in New York in April 1923 before traveling home for her sister's wedding? The 1922 article reporting her filing for divorce had said she was living with her Illinois parents.\n\nPerhaps Harry did desert Dorothy. Perhaps the two had attempted reconciliation and failed. Perhaps Dorothy didn't want to trade the Chicago area where a socialite for New York where she was not. Whatever the case, newspapers don't provide a clear story.\n\nArcher and Paul Whiteman\n\nShortly after the announcement that Dorothy Dyrenforth Auracher would leave New York to serve as matron of honor at her sister's wedding, Harry Archer was temporarily leaving the country in pursuit of his music career.\n\nWhile Paul Whiteman’s Leviathan Orchestra was booked for United States Shipping Board liners during the summer of 1923, Whiteman provided another orchestra, including Harry Archer, to embark on the U.S liner George Washington, April 14. Ship records documenting Archer’s May 11 return to New York from Bremerhaven, Germany, still aboard the George Washington, include a notation that musicians were to be paid upon return.\n\nDisembarkation did not end Archer’s association with Whiteman musicians.\n\nThompson-Archer Broadway Shows\n\nPrior to joining Whiteman's orchestra as pianist, Archer had teamed up again with lyricist Harlan Thompson with whom he had collaborated on May and December and The Awkward Age. The pair's new project was a full-length musical comedy. Archer returned from Europe to the news that rehearsals would open in two days.\n\nLittle Jessie James, 1923-1924\n\nOn July 12, 1923, while Little Jessie James was in rehearsals, Variety announced the show's opening in New Jersey:\n\nLittle Jessie James, the musical show which William Friedlander and L. Lawrence Weber are producing, will open at Long Branch Monday with Nan Halperin featured. The book is by Harlan Thompson of the New York World, the score being composed by Harry Archer, first pianist for Paul Whiteman. --Variety, July 12,1923\n\nAt the end of July, to promote the show's impending New York City opening, the New York Morning Telegraph reported that Little Jessie James “broke all records on the New Jersey shore.”\n\nNew York Times\n\nLittle Jessie James opened at the Longacre Theatre on August 15, 1923 and ran there until January 27, 1924, when it moved to the Little Theatre, opening the next day and not closing until July 19.\n\nSomewhat like Archer and Thompson, born in small town Iowa and Missouri, the show's main character, Jessie Jamieson, left her Kansas home bound for New York City. Nicknamed for the outlaw because of her history ignoring strict laws back home, Little Jessie James was not making a career move, but instead out for a good time. In New York, she falls into a series of madcap misadventures that include a Murphy bed said to fold into the wall when it shouldn't and unfold when it shouldn't. What looks like big trouble for Little Jessie James naturally works out for the best, and the show ends with her return to Kansas.\n\nThe music in earlier shows had received little attention. Although Little Jessie James' plot and its chorus girls' beauty continued to fill the majority of the newspaper space dedicated to the show, the show's music attracted substantially more notice than before. This held true from the rehearsal period through the national tour:\n\nA number of novelties are promised. Among them is a Paul Whiteman band called the “James Boys.” Special provision is being made to accommodate the 17 musicians in the pit of the Longacre, New York, where the show is due about the first of August. A 15-minute concert prior to each performance and during the 10-minute intermission between acts is part of the “James Boys” duties. --Variety, July 12, 1923\n\nThere was one particularly whistley waltz song, \"I Love You,\" and the way the James boys did tickle it indicated that it would be a sure fire talking machine hit in the near future, as well as a favorite at all dance palaces and lesser jazz parlors. It was between acts that the musical boys did their best stunts, encouraged by Mr. and Mrs. Whiteman from a stage box. And the audience was with them to the extent of cheers and applause galore.\n\n--The Evening Telegram, New York City, Aug. 16, 1923\n\nNan Halperin, as the little heart bandit, easily captured the audience with her quaint ways and finely rendered songs; she put the songs over and they are good. . . .\n\nAnother feature is \"The James Boys,\" a Paul Whiteman band, that jazzed the really good score and won hearty applause by their efforts both individual and collective.\n\n--The Brooklyn Citizen, August 16, 1923\n\nHarry Archer, composer of the music of L. Lawrence Weber's Little Jessie James, now at the Little Theatre here and the Garrick Theatre, in Chicago, and who wrote \"I Love You\" said to be the biggest song sensation in recent years, has gone back to the scenes of his early triumphs--Chicago--to show the natives how a real, honest-to-goodness successful composer looks. --The Evening Telegram, New York City, Mar. 16, 1924\n\nThe song successes of Little Jessie James are too numerous to mention. Everywhere music is played you hear its haunting strains and the song that made love famous, \"I Love You,\" now has the distinction of being the biggest seller among music buyers the world has ever known.\n\nThe company playing Little Jessie James has just completed its three hundredth performance and will remain in New York all summer.\n\nThe Chicago company could easily stay in Chicago all summer, but the eastern cities, like Boston and Philadelphia, have contracts which must be fulfilled--so if you haven't seen this little giant of musical comedies, don't delay. To miss it is to regret it. --The Daily Herald, Chicago, May 16, 1924\n\nThe music from the pen of Harry Archer, we can say without fear of contradiction is the best that has been written since The Prince of Pilsen or The Merry Widow, has been given special attention by Mr. Weber who has engaged a Paul Whiteman band to play Mr. Archer's score during the performance and between acts render a Jazz concert that will fairly rock the theatre from syncopated strains and make the oldest person in the house feel like stepping to the tunes. One of the big song hits in Little Jessie James, \"I Love You,\" swept the country like wildfire and has been translated into thirty-two languages and is now being sung in Chinese besides being on Chinese mechanical records. --The Reading [PA] Times, Sept.1,1924\n\nAn enjoyable part of Little Jessie James is furnished by the James boys, so-called, a group of young demon musicians selected and sponsored by the king of jazzland, Paul Whiteman, himself. These boys have the honor of having their names listed on the program together with the instruments each one plays and although they are stationed in the orchestra pit, they are an integral part of the play itself. --The Billings [MT] Gazette, Sept.26, 1924\n\nThe Paul Whiteman band, under the able direction of Paul Parnell, shared the honors with the cast. . . .\n\nThe most attractive feature of the show was the entertainment of extraordinary merit given by the orchestra between acts. Players of various instruments gave solo renditions of the melodious song \"I Love You,\" and were encored time and again. The song also proved the climax of the second act. --The Helena [MT] Daily Independent, Sept. 29,1924\n\nThe music by Harry Archer is lovely and all of the numbers have vitality. The air that lingers, the one which the audience hums as it goes cafe or homeward bound is \"I Love You.\" The James Boys, so billed to fit in the story, are in reality one of Paul Whiteman's bands, and one of the best. Talented to a mother's son, the musicians play together like a big symphony orchestra. They play solos, too, every man contributing a specialty. The orchestra is far and away the best part of the show. --The Oregonian, Portland, Oct. 17,1924\n\nAt Shreveport's Grand Opera House\n\nFrom the opening selections, played by a Paul Whiteman band, to the drop of the curtain and the final strains of the music the audience is held spellbound. There is not a dull moment in the play.\n\nLittle Jessie James is rich in music. There is the band, a Paul Whiteman organization, directed by Sol Kosarin. Its splendid playing was rewarded by round after round of applause, matinee and last night.\n\nAnd there are voices, real voices which were liberally used by their gifted possessors in rendering the many tuneful songs.\n\nLittle Jessie James starts well with the first song number, \"Quiet Afternoon,\" sung by Mr. Connor and Mr Kent.\" Suppose I Had Never Met You\" by Mr. Carroll and Miss Reed, and \"I Love You,\" the song hit of the play, by the same singers are all received with thunderous demands for encores.\n\nAnd then Miss Brady sings \"My Home Town in Kansas\" in her inimitably charming way and again the audience applauded her until she and chorus are forced to plead for mercy.\n\n\"The Knocking Bookworm,\" by Mr. O'Connor, Miss Shay and the chorus, is a pleasing little novelty song, enhanced by some excellent dancing. \"Little Jack Horner,\" by Miss Brody and Mr. O'Connor, is another of those charming novelty songs in which the play abounds.\n\nThe second act of the program is introduced by some specialty work of The James Boys, which wins the audience. \"The Bluebird,\" by Mr. Burns; \"Little Jessie James,\" title song of the play, by Miss Brody, Mr. O'Connor and the Girls; \"From Broadway to Main Street;\" Such Is Life\" and medley of songs of the play complete the vocal score, all pleasing and well rendered. --The Shreveport Times, Jan. 19,1925\n\nWhen Little Jessie James reached its 44th week on Broadway, the Daily News reported that the show, including royalties from \"I Love You,\" had made wealthy men of Thompson and Archer. This income would increase as the various touring companies traveled the U.S. and as the show expanded overseas to Berlin, Vienna, and London. Other papers reported that the show had bought Archer two New York apartments.\n\nOver the years, several attempts were made to revive Little Jessie James.\n\nIn late August, 1932, Mount Vernon, New York's Daily Argus reported that Archer played his songs on the piano during a revival at the town's Croton River Playhouse.\n\nIn November 1943, the New York Times announced producer Walter Brooks' planned January opening of That Girl from Texas, a revised version with new book by Thompson, lyrics by Thompson and Gladys Shelley, and music by Archer. Less than a month later, Brooks canceled the plan, citing inability to clear rights to the production.\n\nTwo other revivals, under the names Lucky Break (1934) and Heels Together (1942), will appear below.\n\nMy Girl, 1924-1925\n\nDespite criticizing the thin plot with \"a succession of scenes, all leading to nothing,\" the New York Times reviewer called the show \"tuneful and fast-moving, with just enough brightness in it to make you long for more.\" Elaborating sightly on the \"tuneful\" side, he noted that \"practically all the feet in the audience were set tapping last night\" and predicted that Archer's \"swinging\" rhythms would soon \"be danced to all over town.\"\n\nA major change had occurred since Little Jessie James. Harry Archer's orchestra replaced the Paul Whiteman orchestra. Having written a hit with Little Jessie James, Thompson and Archer, nonetheless, had to share much of the credit for the show's success with another man's musicians. A Paul Whiteman Orchestra may have been selected to lend credibility to a show by largely unknown composers. Knowing little or nothing about the supposed young college boy team behind Little Jessie James, many theatergoers may have been enticed to buy tickets to hear the famous orchestra.\n\nHow prominent the Whiteman group was is unclear, however. Since Archer had returned to New York only two days before Little Jessie James rehearsals had begun, the show's Whiteman musicians quite likely were drawn from the group that had returned with Archer on the George Washington while Whiteman's main orchestra was aboard a different ship.\n\nNow that Thompson and Archer had a smash hit on their hands with Little Jessie James, they had reason to believe they could attract a crowd on their own, no longer needing the Whiteman name.\n\nThe Daily News, NYC, Dec. 25, 1924\n\nWhile the show ran on Broadway and across the country, publications frequently commented on the Thompson-Archer music and the musicians playing it:\n\nThe brightest of the light musical pieces, or so it seemed at yesterday's matinee, is one called My Girl at the Vanderbilt. And if it is not the brightest as to book, it can boast the most intelligent and the most amusing set of lyrics written in these parts this season.\n\nAnd the most pleasing of musical scores. I have great hopes of the Harlan Thompson-Harry Archer combination. Little Jessie James was their first music play, if you remember it, and though there was not much in the James play to cheer about, from it came one song, the sighing \"I Love You,\" that swept the country.\n\nIn the new piece, there is another--two or three others, in fact--that I expect to hear a good deal from. The most insistent of them is called \"You and I.\" When the moaning saxes and clarinets of the Archer orchestra, which is a feature of the show, drift dreamily into this one, the audience is quickly reduced to nothing much but a swaying crowd.\n\nThe others include \"Desert Isle,\" \"Before the Dawn\" and \"A Fellow Like Me.\"\n\n--Burns Mantle, The [NY] Daily News,\n\nNov.28, 1924\n\n\"Desert Isle\" (Harry Archer), like with every other successful musical comedy, is the surprise offering of My Girl. \"You and I,\" from this show, takes first honors, but as a sprightly dance tune \"Desert Isle\" is a corker all by itself.\n\n--Variety, Apr. 29, 1925\n\nThe orchestra in My Girl is one of those tinkley-banjo, moaning-oh-you-red-hot mamma-saxophone and soothing violin affairs, and very enjoyable, too. --The Baltimore Sun, Dec. 21, 1924\n\nMy Girl is the work of the author and the composer of Little Jessie James, and if you liked their earlier work you will probably like their present production just as much. The two pieces are alike in type but quite different in incident and atmosphere. Both made their strongest appeal through the rhythmical and emotional allure of jazz. Whenever the comely legs, or whenever the tired dancers take a bit of a rest, which is less often, the excellent jazz orchestra, which is an integral part of the show, is ready with a new burst of stimulating syncopation. . . .\n\nThe music is always spirited, occasionally refreshingly novel, and there are more catchy tunes than should be expected from the score of one jazz farce. \"Rainbow Jazz,\" \"You and I,\" \"A Fellow Like Me\" and \"A Solo on the Drum\" were among those most heartily applauded. --The Boston Globe, Aug. 4, 1925\n\nAnother feature which is most enjoyable in the production is the violin solo by Robert Berne, the conductor of the Harry Archer orchestra. Piano selection will please you, but when you hear the violin, you realize there is no modern instrument to keep pace with this instrument We have only one criticism to make of Mr. Berne and that is that he fails to give an encore. --The News-Leader, Staunton, VA, Oct 16,1925\n\n\"You and I\" is still a song hit, despite the continual playing of it since My Girl opened in Manhattan a year ago. So is \"Desert Isle.\"\n\nPaul Parnell conducts the Archer Orchestra. Archer should be charitable and provide orchestras such as this for every show in New York, regardless of the producer. It would improve them 50 percent. --The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Nov. 24, 1925\n\nArcher's Contribution to Theater Music. During the Broadway run of My Girl, newspapers noted Archer's innovations. Because some of these had appeared during Little Jessie James, we cannot rule out a possible Whiteman influence, but the inclusion of the Italian shipyard worker on the 1921 Peek-a-Boo stage, who after entering the orchestra pit during a fight scene, began expertly playing several instruments, can just as easily allow us to credit Archer.\n\nAfter discussing Harlan Thompson's innovative small choruses, chosen less for the chorus girls' looks than for their talent and making them capable of assuming small acting roles and advancing their stage careers, a Brooklyn reporter turned to Archer's comparable contributions. Like Thompson who personally selected and trained the chorus girls, Archer did the same for the musicians, becoming \"their best friend, if also their severest critic.\"\n\nJust as Thompson reduced the chorus size, Archer traded the regulation Broadway theater orchestra of eighteen to thirty-two for a \"small but select\" thirteen-man jazz band comprised of musicians capable of playing several instruments and gave them the chance to solo on at least one during every performance.\n\nSupporting the idea that Archer, not Whiteman, deserves credit for these innovations, Harlan Thompson explained:\n\nHarry not only composes music but plays on the piano and several brass instruments himself. He got the idea that the usual theater orchestra of strings, French bass, and a harp, wasn't able to keep up with modern music. He thought the new orchestra ought to have a piano, saxophones, banjo and so on like a regular jazz band, and he came from Chicago to peddle his idea up and down Broadway for three years without making a dent.\n\nHe, too, carried out his idea in Jessie with the James Boys, who attracted a lot of attention, and now he has got together and trained the same kind of a band for the new show.\n\n--Quoted by Catharine Brody, Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Dec. 28, 1924\n\nPointing out to New York readers who may have known Archer only as a theater composer, the New York Sun compared band and orchestra leader Archer's \"new type of orchestra\" at the Vanderbilt Theatre to Gershwin's new type of music.\n\nThe Sun also let Archer speak for himself: \"Every member of the band is a capable solo performer. Every one was chosen as careful as the members of the cast.\"\n\nArcher continued:\n\nThe distinctive contribution they are making to the music of the theater is that because they are acting as accompanists to performers they must also double as a legitimate string and wind orchestra as well as a jazz band.\n\nAmerican music has thus established itself within theater walls as well as in dance halls. Our saxophone players are not only capable of playing all the various saxophones from the soprano to the bass but they can double on woodwinds, and one of them is also a cellist. One of our numbers, \"You and I,\" is played as a straight waltz,with no inkling of jazz, and is then orchestrated in typical jazz fashion.\n\nArcher then predicted the nature of orchestras to come:\n\nThe orchestra of the future will undoubtedly be fashioned after the small model I am offering at the Vanderbilt, when it is used in musical comedy. The old theater orchestra has outlived its day. Jazz dominates, and so the orchestra ought to include players who are capable of interpreting both modern music and music typical of the past as well. --quoted in The Sun, Feb. 26, 1925\n\nMerry Merry, 1925-1926\n\nAt the Vanderbilt Theatre from September 24, 1925 to March 13, 1926, Thompson and\n\nArcher's Merry Merry failed to live up to Little Jessie James or My Girl, yet this play about chorus girls was still a success with its 197 performances and its six-month run.\n\nDuring the opening scene, Adam Winslow and Eve Walters, played by Harry Puck and Marie Saxon, meet in a subway station and feel a mutual attraction. As strangers, they go their separate ways. With comedy based in part on mistaken identity, the simple plot ends with Winslow and Walters reunited at the Vanderbilt Theatre.\n\nFrom the show's trial run in Providence, Rhode Island, through its Broadway run, Thompson and Archer continued attracting attention:\n\nProvidence gave this musical comedy the best send-off a new piece, shipped here to be tried out in the sticks, has received in two seasons. The house was packed matinee and evening yesterday. . .\n\nThe chorus is young and versatile and contributed not a little to the success of the farce here, as did also the Harry Archer orchestra unit of 12 men under the direction of Ernest Cutting. . .\n\nThe show is likeable and of the light breezy type. The melodies are of the soft, haunting waltz variety popularized in Little Jessie James. The songs registering best here were \"It Must Be Love,\" \"My Own,\" \"Little Girl, \"I was Blue,\" and \"Oh, Wasn't It Lovely.\" --Reprinted in Variety, Sept 9, 1925\n\nPre-Broadway run in Hartford, CT\n\nIt is about time to announce that Harlan Thompson and Harry Archer seem to have taken over the mantle left untenanted by that trio of happy Princess days, the Messrs. Bolton and Wodehouse and Kern. Last night at the Vanderbilt, the newest Thompson-Archer musical comedy, Merry Merry, turned out to be approximately three times as good as as either of their preceding works. . . .\n\nAs for the songs and dancing, the first are tuneful and the latter is frequently remarkable. Mr. Archer has provided at least a pair of unusually beguiling melodies--to wit, \"It Must Be Love\" and \"I Was Blue.\" The numbers break upon one unexpectedly, and have been developed with endless ingenuity. . . . --New York\n\nTimes, Sept. 25, 1925\n\nAs a syncopating pit orchestra, this band is in a class by itself. Its men are expert trench accompanists, the medium between a dance orchestra and a pit bunch being a difficult thing to accomplish. Collectively they present a classy \"front,\" several being expert in solo opportunities and (the main thing) playing for the show in satisfactory fashion.\n\n--Variety, Oct. 28, 1925\n\n**At the time of this post, titles of \"It Must Be Love\" and \"I Was Blue\" are reversed on Internet Archive\n\nVariety, Dec. 30, 1925\n\nBy the way Mr, Archer, who originated the jazz band idea in the orchestra pit of a musical show, has some new ideas for the use of a jazz band which he will use in our new production. This idea, which we also used in My Girl, has been our winning to musical comedy of a large branch of the theatre-going public which ordinarily does not attend such shows. The new production at the Vanderbilt, in New York, will continue to follow the lines of the past production. That is, it will be a farce set to modern jazz music, with just enough of the old-fashioned ballad style and waltz to please everyone. --Harlan Thompson, before the opening of Merry Merry, qtd in The Philadelphia Inquirer, Dec. 27, 1925\n\nWhen Merry Merry opened at the Vanderbilt Theater critics were unanimous on one point: the score. Harry Archer, they said, had written music which never fell below the level of excellent at any time. The author of \"I Love You\" had duplicated his success. He had written \"It Must Be Love.\" --The [NY] Sun, Jan. 20, 1926\n\nThe Daily News, New York, NY, Sept. 20. 1925; for those not old enough to recall William Frawley, he is better known to some of us today as Fred Mertz, Lucy and Ricky Ricardo's landlord on the early I Love Lucy TV comedy series.\n\nPromotional Strategies: A couple months into Merry Merry's Vanderbilt run, the San Diego Evening Tribune revealed that Ruth Varin, Archer's band leader sister, introduced each new Archer piece to that city before anyone else could obtain a copy. When she and her band featured Merry Merry's \"It Must Be Love,\" the Evening Tribune predicted the tune's popularity in San Diego would rival its popularity in New York--long before any road troupe would come that way.\n\nBack in New York, an early January issue of The Sun reported that Archer had found another way to carry \"It Must Be Love\" to wider audiences. Rather than originating the promotional strategy, he had borrowed it from Hungarian operettas in which the producer, composer, and star gave their friends specially-made car horns \"so that the hit song may greet the ears of passersby on highways everywhere.\" Perhaps picked up when Archer traveled to Hungary with Little Jessie James, this was a new twist on that show's powder cases that played \"I Love You\" whenever a woman opened the lid.\n\nWhen the Vanderbilt scheduled a January French fashion showcase immediately following a Merry Merry matinee, the theater probably drew in new people interested in seeing the latest haute couture. Spectators got not only an eyeful of Paris models strutting the runway clad in spring and summer wear, but also an earful of bonus concert music played by Archer's Vanderbilt Orchestra.\n\nArcher's Stories about Composing the Merry Merry Hits. The January 20 Sun reported how Archer, content with completed work, had planned to use his music for \"My Own\" as the show's main number. Then during a few weeks in Norwalk, Connecticut finalizing the music for Merry Merry, Archer spent eight hours a day at the piano. \"One day the arrangement of 'It Must Be Love' chorus played itself. After replaying the chorus and replaying it the next day for Feist's arranger, Archer realized he \"had a hit.\" Unsure what to do because he also liked \"My Own,\" he followed others' advice to make \"It Must Be Love\" the show's featured number.\n\nArcher next explained composing \"I Was Blue\" while suffering from a severe cold. Feeling bad, he decided to take a day off from working on the show. In the afternoon, a hungry Harlan Thompson came by wanting to eat. Archer who hadn't eaten all day decided that he couldn't let his guest eat alone. Revived and feeling better after a meal, Archer came up with the tune for \"I Was Blue.\" As Thompson wrote the lyric for Archer's tune, he recalled Archer's words: \"Funny how that cold took all the music out of me.\" Just as Archer felt better after eating, Thompson gave his lyric about the blues a happy ending.\n\nWhether facts or good stories fabricated by the composers, The Sun concluded, \"And that is how the two hits of Merry Merry came into being.\"\n\nRecordings and Radio. During Merry Merry's run, Variety and many newspapers announced Archer's new recording deals with the Brunswick and Vocalion labels, using \"Harry Archer and His Orchestra\" on Brunswick and \"The Vanderbilt Orchestra\" on Vocalion.\n\nAccording to the January 27, 1926 issue of Variety, demand had increased for show song recordings, especially in parts of the country that would need to wait a season before a show reached them from New York or Chicago.\n\nFirst up were Archer's hits from Merry Merry:\n\nLinks to the related recordings are posted above.\n\nOther recordings quickly followed, Links to some appear on this page.\n\nAlso in January, Thompson and Archer's previous show, My Girl, was playing at Buffalo and Archer's Vanderbilt Theatre Orchestra appeared on WMAK radio for three evenings, directed by Paul Parnell. Indicating that the chance to hear the orchestra from one's home was not a substitute for going to the theater, the Buffalo Times played up the orchestra's benevolent side. Thanks to the free radio concert, Invalids, the elderly, and their caretakers, as well as young mothers \"unwilling to leave their infants alone,\" could now hear the latest tunes played by \"real stage artists whose previous radio concerts have been nothing if not 'wows.'\"\n\nIn early February, Harry Archer and Harlan Thompson appeared together on New York's WGBS for a half hour interview, followed by a Vanderbilt Dance Orchestra performance.\n\nThe pair's successes had opened many doors.\n\nTwinkle Twinkle (1926-1927)\n\nOf Thompson and Archer's three Vanderbilt Theatre shows, Little Jessie James was decidedly the biggest hit. Merry Merry, which the New York Times declared three times better than the others, had the shortest run--more than a hundred fewer performances that My Girl and more than two hundred fewer than Little Jessie James.\n\nTheir fourth musical comedy, Twinkle Twinkle, opened at the Liberty Theatre, not the Vanderbilt, on November 16, 1926, and closed on April 9, 1927, with a total of 167 performances. With nearly a five-month run, no one could call the show a flop. Nonetheless, Twinkle Twinkle would be the last of the major Thompson-Archer collaborations although not their last collaboration.\n\nThe dramatic setting changed from the pair's usual New York City to a train traveling through Kansas and to the fictional town of Pleasantville. Instead of a Midwesterner arriving in New York, a glamorous actress escapes her private car and seeks anonymity in Middle America. Leaving the screen for the small-town restaurant, she falls for a local newspaper reporter, never suspecting that he also has a hidden identity as the vice president of the John W. Whoozis Film Company in town scouting a location for a million-dollar theater. Meanwhile, responding to rumors that a famous film star is in town, the correspondence school-trained private investigator determines to find her and repeatedly dons ridiculous disguises in the attempt to discover her identity.\n\nGiven Thompson's birth in Hannibal, Missouri and Archer's in Creston, Iowa, the pair's frequent use of Midwestern characters or now a Midwestern town makes sense. The contrasting life styles provided comedic opportunities. Touring show troupes might also have reaped good profits in Midwestern communities, even in any small town or city far from New York.\n\nIn American Musical Theatre\" A Chronicle, Gerald Bordman points out that due to weaknesses in the book and score Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby were asked to contribute additional music. The opening of the New York Times review refers to \"additional scenes, lyrics and music.\" Before the show opened at Broadway's Liberty Theatre, Kalmar-Ruby had added \"We're on the Map,\" \"Sweeter than You,\" and \"Whistle.\" Two Thompson-Archer songs from the list above had vanished and new Thompson -Archer tunes added.\n\nAgain referring to \"the none too substantial plot,\" the New York Times accepted that characteristic as common to musical comedy and, overall, complimented the show:\n\nThis time they are, possibly, a little less intimate than they were when their wares were on display at the Vanderbilt Theatre, and the product, although of no great pretensions, is a genuinely pleasant and diverting entertainment, with some gay tunes, lyrics that can pass the Binet [intelligence] test, and all the usual first-rate dancing of a musical comedy. --Nov. 17, 1926\n\nThe Times reviewer opened the paragraph with \"Possibly the most damning thing that can be said of this new musical comedy is that it is clean.\"\n\nPerhaps that remark explains the earlier \"a little less intimate\" comparison between this show and the three Vanderbilt Theatre shows which had sometimes been described as off-color. In fact, because of Little Jessie James' disappearing Murphy bed scenes, London had initially banned the show but later lifted the ban.\n\nDuring the New York run of Twinkle Twinkle, the Chicago Tribune granted that the show \"has most of the things a music play needs.\" Yet the paper was far from complimentary unless calling Thompson and Archer \"practical workers\" might be construed as a compliment. The Tribune appears to have been making the point that Thompson and Archer wrote whatever would line their pockets:\n\nThe Messrs. Harlan Thompson, who used to write pieces for the World newspaper, and Harry Archer, who used to compose tunes for any publishing house that would buy them are practical workers in their field. They write for the trade and their present ambition, I gather, is to give the trade what it will pay for. Hence the production of a week ago of another of those things with music called Twinkle Twinkle. --Dec. 5, 1926\n\nFollowing the road show's Chicago opening at the Erlanger Theater, the Tribune commented somewhat more specifically on the music:\n\nThat's the play part; and this brings us right down to Mr. Archer's music, which sounds to me exactly like the music Mr. Archer put into Little Jessie James and My Girl, operas of his composition heard here earlier in the current century. He seems to score what he writes for xylophone, six drums, and cymbals, leaving to the management the task of adding strings, brass, and woodwind in an effort to pacify the musicians' union. But the performers find it to be good music to which to dance; and that is important, inasmuch as there are many dances with songs in the first act, while in the second act there are many songs with dances. --Apr. 20, 1927\n\nThe San Francisco Examiner viewed the music, as performed by the chorus, at least somewhat more favorably, describing it as one component of a successful show:\n\nAll are equipped with legs and voices that don't find it difficult to sing to Harry Archer's music, which is tuneful and xylophony--as in Little Jessie James. And the chorus, very dressy in silks and frills, impinges happily on the eye. The episodes are well framed, too. . . .\n\nYes, it's a musical comedy that's on to stay. --Sept.20, 1927\n\nIn addition to the recordings, Archer or the show producers found another way to plug the show and its music. On December 10, 1926--less than a month after the show had opened, WEAF radio announced that the Twinkle Twinkle stars and orchestra would broadcast a \"tabloid version\" of the show at 6:45 that evening.\n\nDuring the musical comedy's 21st week (late March), WGBS similarly announced that after the evening's performance, the entire cast and orchestra would broadcast a \"midnight air version\"\n\nThe Show Folds in New York and on Tour. Despite such efforts, Twinkle Twinkle folded in New York approximately a week and a half later but lived on for a few months on the circuit. The El Paso Evening Post reported on the show's final performance, December 3, 1927, with the orchestra \"playing in jazz\" Auld Lang Syne.\n\nSome of the performers returned to New York; others reportedly joined another show in Los Angeles. Star Joe E. Brown, the correspondence school detective, was said to be going to L.A. \"to have a tryout in the movies.\"\n\nHarlan Thompson joined those headed to California where he continued his career as film writer, lyricist, director, and producer. Despite his new ventures, Thompson didn't entirely abandon his interest in musical theater.\n\nLegal Troubles and a Second Marriage\n\nA Breach of Promise Suit\n\nBasing the headline on Archer's hit song from Little Jessie James, the Daily News opened its article about a lawsuit by quoting the song's chorus:\n\n\"I love youoooooo\n\nI love youoooooo\n\nThat's all that I can say . . . . \"\n\nThat might be all that Harry Archer, composer of the above song, can say--\n\nbut it's a lot less than Hattye C. Fox, well known musical comedy actress, has stated and will continue to state for some months to come.\n\n--Apr. 3, 1925\n\nThe Daily News went on to explain Hattye Fox's reason for suing Archer for breech of promise and $100,000. According to Fox, she had met Harry Auracher in July 1919 when she was in the cast of Love for Sale. Still married and living in Chicago, Auracher had allegedly struck up a relationship with Fox, and \"less than a year after that, Archer [as he was by then calling himself] promised to make Hattye his wife.\" Fox states that Archer asked her to retire from the stage \"to do housekeeping\" for him. When Archer composed the music for Little Jessie James, she explains that his \"interest in her began to wane\" and that he left her when the show and \"I Love You\" became hits. Not until February 1924 [the month during which Dorothy and Harry Auracher's divorce was finalized, did Hattye Fox say she had learned Auracher was married while she was living with him.\n\nIn late November, 1927, the New York Times reported that Fox's breach of promise suit was still pending in West Chester County courts. Furthermore, Fox was now also suing Archer for what she claimed was her share of the profits for songs she alleged she co-wrote during her time living with Archer: \"I Love You\" and \"You Know What I Know\" from Little Jessie James, \"You and I\" from My Girl, \"It Must Be Love\" from Merry Merry, and others from Twinkle Twinkle and Afgar.\n\nWhen Archer's lawyer called Fox a \"gold digger\" during a change of venue hearing, her lawyer argued, \"She is a sweet, little girl and as pretty as her aunt,\" the actress Della Fox.\n\nIn June 1928, the Times reported that Fox's second suit demanded 50% of the song royalties from 1919 to 1924 and that Archer had proposed a settlement out of court for an undisclosed amount.\n\nAlthough I haven't located further information regarding these suits, Fox was far from the \"sweet little girl\" her lawyer wanted the judge to believe she was. For one thing, she was not \"a little girl.\" Born in 1888, she was only two years Archer's junior, making her approximately 31 when she met Archer in 1919 and 32 when she moved in with him in 1920. Second, no mention was made of her 1914 St.Louis divorce from singer and former Steward Opera Company Manager William G. Stewart on the grounds of desertion. Fox and Steward had known each other since at least 1904 when they performed together is the show Louisiana, written for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, more commonly known as the St. Louis World's Fair. Ancestry.com provides Fox and Stewart's 1907 New Jersey marriage record. Finally, less innocent and naive as she must have portrayed herself, Fox was a highly experienced performer when she met Archer, not an upstart chorus girl.\n\nMarriage to Alma Lescher\n\nAlma also authored or was the subject of many other articles during her marriage to Harry Archer\n\nAltoona Mirror, Altoona, PA, July 2, 1932\n\nWindsor Star, Ontario, Canada, July 31, 1933\n\nHer 1988 obituary reported her \"interviewing Hitler, drinking with Hemingway in Paris, and sailing with James Joyce,\"--all during the height of her career in the '30s.\n\nArcher's Views on Broadway and the Little Theater Movement\n\nIn 1927, syndicated columnist Lemuel F. Parton, who sought out interesting people to feature in his columns, interviewed Harry Archer. The result was an article focusing on Archer's views about Broadway and the role he felt the Midwest, West, and South should play in determining the future of the American theater.\n\nDescribing Archer as \"the inevitable successor to Victor Herbert in the musical world,\" Parton praised Archer's musical comedy successes. He explained that Archer rejected Easterner H. L. Mencken's view that the rest of the country was a \"cultural wasteland.\" Parton quoted Archer's opinion that other parts of the country were leaving Broadway behind:\n\nThe trouble with Broadway is that it is behind the times. While America as a whole has been growing up and maturing in the arts, Broadway has been standing still. There is a healthy little theater movement springing up all over America; there is new creative vitality in music and there is evidence everywhere of the beginnings of native drama and music far more worthwhile than the old Broadway output--consisting mostly of a mob of girls, to which the makeshift books and lyrics are entirely secondary. --The [Omaha] World Herald, July 26, 1927\n\nAfter filling in Archer's biographical and theater background, Parton again let the musician speak for himself:\n\nFor the first time in its history, America at large is becoming intelligently critical in the fields of literature, music and drama. The best work of the future will be done by men who are essentially American and who are not dazzled by mere sophistication or by the smart and flippant currencies of metropolitan taste. I do not wish to belittle much splendid work now being done by Broadway producers, but I do want to insist that the end is at hand for the sleazy, commonplace productions, barren of taste or intelligence and rigged out with the old banalities of underdressed girls and third-rate music.\n\nArcher predicted success throughout the country for the \"high class roadshow\" and argued that more people had begun occasionally attending the theater due to the successful Little Theater Movement--a non-commercial movement in universities and cities giving playwrights such as Maxwell Anderson, Elmer Rice, and Eugene O'Neill a chance to stage their work.\n\nArcher believed that American theater needed \"a declaration of independence of Broadway with productions by men who know the west and south, whence many of our best artists come.\"\n\nHad Archer rejected the types of shows for which he'd written music: burlesque, vaudeville, or musical comedies repeatedly described as little more than vaudeville acts strung together by a weak plot? Might his new wife Alma have played a role in his ideas at this time? Was he thinking of the efforts he and Harlan Thompson had made to turn chorus girls into actresses and to make pit orchestras a part of the show?\n\nLater Shows\n\nJust a Minute, 1928\n\nAgain teamed up with vaudevillian and lyricist Walter O'Keefe, Archer next wrote the music for Just a Minute, a show differing somewhat from those before it. According to the Brooklyn Standard Union, Just a Minute was \"primarily a musical\" but embodied \"a revue, a black Harlem cabaret, and a prize fight.\"\n\nDuring the show's pre-Broadway tryouts, the Boston Globe described it as combining two popular show characteristics: a largely vaudeville act sequence with enough plot to introduce the songs and a story about show business--about a pair of young song writers. For the most part, the Globe praised the production:\n\nIt begins with an orchestra of pretty girls, under the vivid leadership of Count Berni Vici--and that's no kid--the girls are fine musicians and have been chosen for an unusually perfect ensemble. . . .\n\nThe plot naturally takes one to a night club where the color line has been slightly slacked, with results in fire and contortion, in rhythm and speed, in brevity of costume and length of back, that quite outdo anything to be seen in Boston's night clubs.\n\nThe two song hits of Just a Minute [are] \"Anything Your Heart Desires\" and \"Pretty, Petite and Sweet,\" but there are many numbers that one remembers, and several that are away above the average. One of the best is a neat little thing called \"I Got a Cookie Jar, but No Cookies; I Got a House, but Nobody Home.\"\n\nJust a Minute opened on October 8, 1928, at Broadway's Ambassador Theatre. One of four shows in part dealing with boxing to open on Broadway in a six-week period, Just a Minute more than doubled the performances of two of those shows but fell far short of Hold Everything's 409 performances. Changing part way through its run from the Ambassador to the Century, Just a Minute closed December 15 after 80 performances and then went on the road.\n\nThe New York Times offered few compliments:\n\nAnother musical comedy opened last night at the Ambassador Theatre and that is precisely the way in which most of those who saw it are likely to think of it.\n\nIt is not a good show and in spite of certain lamentable features, particularly an appallingly weak book, it is not quite a bad one. . . . With a great deal of speeding up and rewriting of the dialogue it may yet be made a passable entertainment. Of the musical numbers heard last night, \"You'll Kill 'Em\" is quite a snappy effort in the jazz vein, while \"We'll Just Be Two Commuters\" and \"Anything Your Heart Desires\" are rather more melodious than the average.\n\nAn orchestra of young ladies--Count Berni Vici's Symphonic Girls, led by the energetic Count himself--play with spirit.\n\nPerhaps the \"Symphonic Girls\" could have been Archer's tribute to his sister's San Diego all woman orchestra. But, if so, why have a male conductor?\n\nThe black cabaret scene, with what Brooklyn's Standard Union called \"the riotous folk dances of Africa, as transplanted to Harlem,\" was a first in a show featuring Archer's music. Yet the show went further, introducing the Ebony Steppers, black chorus girls paralleling the show's white chorus, and \"jazz music syncopated by Peek-A-Boo Jimmie and his colored band\" paralleling the white women's pit orchestra.\n\nAlthough the show included perhaps daring changes from Archer's norm, it failed to attract the masses. Archer would never again see a hit to approach Little Jessie James although one future London production would surpass Twinkle Twinkle.\n\nDec. 29, 1928 advertisement for nearby Jamaica, NY, road show production, declaring the a \"Smashing New York Comedy Hit\"\n\nDaddy, 1928-1929\n\nLittle is known about Daddy, an Edmund D'Orsay & Company one-act farce that helped to fill out theater programs between 1928 and 1929. The Springfield [MA] Republican referred to it as \"from the fertile pen of Harlan Thompson, with special music by Harry Archer.\" Another issue of the paper provided a small clue to the comic plot, telling readers that it 'has to do with twins, triplets and possibly quadruplets.\" The Ottawa [Canada] Journal confirmed that Thompson wrote book and lyrics and commented briefly, but generally, on the play:\n\nEdmund D'Orsay and company will be seen on the current bill in a musical farce entitled Daddy. The piece, which was written by Harlan Thompson with music by Harry Archer fairly\n\nabounds in tuneful melodies, clever lyrics and amusing situations.\n\nYounkers [NY] Statesman\n\nBecause Daddy was little more than a short vaudeville act, newspapers gave it little attention. What it received was probably due to people's familiarity with the Thompson-Archer duo.\n\nKeep It Clean, 1929\n\nThe day after Keep It Clean opened,, the New York Times classified the show as \"a hodge-podge of vaudeville, revue and night club specialties\" and judged it \"a passable diversion for this time of year,\" never any better than that at any season.\n\nThe Times review opened with what may have been the program credits. Other papers provided nearly the same information, sometimes the identical information:\n\nAlthough Alvin Kayton of the Brooklyn Citizen believed that the \"music and lyrics slightly surpass[ed] the general level of the show and helped the amusement value a good deal,\" I've located only three songs from Keep It Clean. Archer wrote one-- \"All I Need Is Someone Like You\"-- with words by Charles Tobias. Shapiro, Bernstein published all three songs, the other two by Lester Lee, one of those in collaboration with Jack Murray.\n\nGiven the number of people credited with music and lyrics, other songs must never have been copyrighted. The show was hardly a smash hit:\n\nKeep It Clean, which is not altogether clean, is called an \"intimate musical revue.\" Intimate in this instance means incompetent, musical means nothing at all and revue means merely permitting a large number of third-rate performers to do whatever they think best.\n\n--Arthur Pollock, Brooklyn Daily Eagle, June 24, 1929\n\nI was unable to stay through the first performance of Keep It Clean, but from what I saw of it I should say it is successfully geared to meet the demands of those who find the low-caste revues better than no entertainment during the off months of the season. A loud and common show that doesn't pretend to be anything else.\n\n--Burns Mantle, The Daily News, June 26, 1929\n\nKeep It Clean opened June 24 and closed July 6.\n\nShoot the Works, 1931\n\nShoot the Works closed October 3 after 87 performances. Organized as two-week fund-raiser, the show's success meant that performers, who originally agreed to work for free, all began receiving salaries after the first two weeks.\n\nLucky Break, 1934\n\nFrom fall 1934 until spring 1935, Harry Archer's music was again heard by London theatergoers. Called a revised version of Little Jessie James, which had played in London a decade earlier during its European tour, Lucky Break had a new book and lyrics by Douglas Furber and revised music by Harry Archer.\n\nThe show's opening date isn't certain. The New York Times and New York Sun indicate that it opened October 2, 1934, each providing a London dateline and the New York Times quoting the London Times' review. However, several days earlier, on September 25, London's The Guardian published a review of Lucky Break's previous night's opening at the city's Palace Theatre. The answer lies in a September 20 advertisement in The Guardian. For whatever reason, Lucky Break had opened at the Palace before its scheduled opening at The Strand.\n\nThe [London] Guardian, Sept. 20, 1934\n\nNewspaper accounts reveal little connection between the plots of Little Jessie James and Lucky Break other than the repeated disappearances of characters into an opening and closing Murphy bed in the former and a statement in The Guardian that the latter's action \"rests on the appearance and disappearance of most of the characters at the wrong time\" through such means as falling down stairs and through trap doors.\n\nLikewise, newspapers provide little information about the music aside from the New York Times' statement that Archer had \"entirely revised the score.\" Copyright records bear this out, at least if we can safely assume that new titles mean new music rather than the same music with Furber's new lyrics. New titles included \"Am I Delighted,\" \"I'd Like to Know,\" Tum-Tum-Tum,\" and \"A Kick in the Pants.\" According to the New York Sun, London's Daily Mail labeled it \"delightful\" and the Daily Herald \"excellent.\"\n\nListen to three selections from Lucky Break.\n\nAlthough Archer is known to have directed the Little Jessie James orchestra for part of its London run, he may or may not have also directed the Lucky Break orchestra. Although no record can be found of his arrival in London, on November 9, more than a month after the show opened, Archer sailed from Southampton aboard the S. S. Washington, arriving back in the Port of New York on November 15.\n\nLucky Break ran another five months. Based on the advertisement below, we can estimate that the show closed on or around Saturday, March 23, 1935.\n\nThe [London] Observer, Sunday, Mar. 17, 1935\n\nCarrying the the previous day's London dateline, a November 15, 1934 article published in Territorial Hawaii attests to widespread interest in theater news--at least, of the uncommon sort. The Honolulu Advertiser reported that Harry Craddock, an enterprising American bartender at London's Savoy Bar, had invented a cocktail and named it for one of Archer's \"hit musical numbers\" from Lucky Break. Whether leaving the show with the tune in one's head or perhaps wanting to relive the experience, one could order a Kick in the Pants--a drink comprised of 1/3 brandy, 1/3 Bacardi rum, 1/6 Cointreau, and 1/6 lime or lemon juice.\n\nEntre Nous, 1935\n\nBack in the U.S., Archer may have reused \"A Kick in the Pants\" with a new lyric, and possibly other Lucky Break tunes, in a new show. Dan Dietz's Off Broadway Musicals, 1910-2007 indicates that Entre Nous opened December 30, 1925, at the Cherry Lane Theatre, Greenwich Village and ran for 47 performances.\n\nOn December 21, nine days before a possible Cherry Lane Theatre opening, The Daily News told a somewhat different story: \"Entre Nous is current at the Provincetown Playhouse, having moved from the Cherry Lane Theatre.\" A Christmas Day advertisement in the New York Times also placed the production at the Provincetown Playhouse.\n\nPossibly the show moved or returned to the Cherry Lane on the 30th.\n\nAccording to Dietz, Entre Nous included not only \"A Kick in the Pants,\" but also \"I'll See You Home,\" \"Under My Skin,\" \"A. J.,\" and \"Am I?\"--each with music by Archer and lyric by Will B. Johnstone. Unfortunately, I've been unable to locate copyright records for any or these aside from the O'Keefe-Archer \"A Kick in the Pants\" from Lucky Break.\n\nStrip Girl, 1935\n\nThe third and final act of Strip Girl contained the show's only song--\"I Want a Flame,\" music by Harry Archer and words by Jill Rainsford, vaudeville and early New York film actress and songwriter.\n\nOpening at Longacre Theatre on October 15, 1935, Henry Rosendahl's play, in part, told the tale of of a working stripper and prostitute who had saved $8,000 to send her younger brother to college, only to have him die of cancer and send her to the bottle. The show received a complex review from The Daily News. Despite describing the show's profane elements, critic Burns Mantle refused to condemn the show. Instead, he compared it to Maxwell Anderson and Lawrence Stallings' 1924 What Price Glory?--an anti-war satire set in World War I France.\n\nIn Strip Girl, the heroine is, as said, the strip tease artist who plays applause-poker with the audience, removing one shred of covering for each salvo of cheers and retiring finally stripped to the buff, but still clothed in her right mind, while the applauding animals out front have lost theirs. . . .\n\nMr. Rosendahl [playwright] has embraced the privilege accorded the Messrs. Stallings and Anderson in the writing of What Price Glory? He has quoted these characters of the lowest form of stage entertainment in the idiom and vernacular of their kind, as the war-play authors quoted their soldiers in the idiom and vernacular of the trenches.\n\nIt is bold talk and frequently offensive. But it also is true to type. The choice is yours as to whether or not you are interested in paying for the privilege of spending an evening with prostitutes and procurers. ---Oct. 21, 1935\n\nWe might view Strip Girl as the trashiest show to contain Harry Archer's music, Or, remembering his praise of Little Theater, which launched such playwrights as Maxwell Anderson and Eugene O'Neil, we might view it as the new type of show with which Archer would proudly have claimed association.\n\nJohnny 2x4, 1942\n\nThe next show to feature Archer's music opened at the Longacre on March 16, 1942 and closed on May 9 after 65 performances.\n\nWritten by Hollywood gangster-film scriptwriter Rowland Brown, Johnny 2x4 takes place in a speakeasy. Daily News critic Burns Mantle devoted enough space to the setting that readers can almost smell the patrons' sweat and the wet bar towel that \"reeked of stale beer.\" Yet, unlike some critics, Mantle left viewers to make up their own minds, much as he had with Strip Girl:\n\nFortunately the box office reception was better than the press reception and at this writing Johnny 2x4 is promising to continue playing.\n\nWhether it deserves to continue playing or not is a matter of opinion. Mr. Brown has gone in heavily for realism. His realism renews an acquaintance with some very exciting but also very depressing years in New York history. His characters are confined to a group of more or less distressful lawbreakers of one breed and another. I am always a little surprised, and frequently more than a little pained, by the effort of playwrights to tell interesting and appealing stories through the medium of uninteresting and repellent characters. It has been done successfully, but not often. --March 17, 1942\n\nAlong with the \"gunmen and their molls\" filling the 2x4 Club are honky-tonk pianist and owner Johnny, a fellow musician \"who blows a sweet horn\" and bumps off a killer, and a singing cigarette girl, each of the three introducing music suited to the Prohibition Era.\n\nUnlike Strip Girl, a non-musical that contained only one song (Rainsford and Archer's \"I Want a Flame\"), Johnny 2x4 was a song-filled \"musical melodrama.\" Archer had composed only one of the show's tunes--\"We Were Lucky Together,\" with words by rising star Gladys Shelley (1911-2003).\n\nHeels Together, 1942\n\nA few months after Johnny 2x4 closed, Archer teamed up again with Harlan Thompson, who had written the book for Heels Together, an old-style song-and-dance revue. Archer's collaborator on Johnny 2x4, Gladys Shelley, shared lyrics credit with Thompson.\n\nFeaturing \"a bevy of blondes, who sing, dance, and swing,\" Heels Together was publicized as a revised Little Jessie James with rewritten book and original songs.\n\nNewspapers announced the show's scheduled September 15 opening in Scarsdale, New York, for the last week of the summer season. Next stop Broadway!\n\nFour days before the Scarsdale opening, the nearby Dobbs Ferry Register declared half of the dozen songs \"certain to find a place on the hit parade before the season is very far advanced\": \"Wonderful,\" \"Got to Have a Man Around the House,\" \"59th and Fifth,\" \"Ten Minutes Longer in Bed,\" \"How Did You Ever Happen to Me?\" and \"Who's to Blame?\"\n\nOn December 13, nearly three months after the Scarsdale run, the Miami News published a December 12 wire report from New York listing fourteen new shows scheduled for Broadway debuts before the year's end. The list included Heels Together.\n\nA delay in the Broadway opening must have turned into cancellation. I have located little information about Heels Together following this announcement. In the May 23, 1943 Philadelphia Inquirer, former Heels Together leading actress Joan Roberts revealed that the play was still being \"revamped for a fling at Broadway.\"\n\nCo-stars Joan Roberts and Lee Dixon left the show. Dixon explained how a composer and lyricist came to Scarsdale scouting possible performers for a new musical (Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Oct. 10, 1943). They tapped Joan Roberts for the role of a young farm girl living with her aunt and a hired hand and Lee Dixon for the role of a dumb dancing cowboy returning home from the big city to claim his bride. Roberts and Dixon left the floundering Heels Together and achieved stardom as Laurey Williams and Will Parker in Oklahoma! This may have been Heels Together's greatest success.\n\nMore Marital Changes, 1942 and1946\n\nArcher's life wasn't going particularly well professionally or personally,\n\nThird Marriage\n\nOn February 25, 1946, a Cook County, Illinois marriage license was issued to Harry Archer and wife-to-be #3, actress Ruth Gillette. Newspapers reveal that Archer was currently directing the orchestra during the national tour of Sigmund Romberg's revived Blossom Time. Gilette was playing Bellabruna, one of the show's leading roles.\n\nHow long Archer and Gillette had known each other is unclear. Both are mentioned in newspapers from the Midwest to the West for five months prior to taking out the license. Blossom Time had opened at least by early October 1945 when it played in Springfield, IL, traveling to such places as Tacoma, WA; Portland, OR, San Francisco, Ogden, UT; Sioux City, IA; and Sioux Falls, SD, before opening in Chicago on February 2, 1946. After closing in Chicago on March 3, the show continued its tour eastward for another few months.\n\nArcher easily could have died before marrying Gillette. Following opening night, fires broke out in four locations of Chicago's Congress Hotel. They were later attributed to a grease fire and four room fires.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune reported the hotel managing director's account of the fire in Archer's room shortly after the grease fire: \"We had to break in. We found the guest sitting in a stupor in a morris chair. I'm sure the fire was started by a cigaret the guest dropped. We put him in a room on the third floor of the south building.\"\n\nArcher was one of the lucky ones. Only an hour after employees helped another guest to his room, the third fire broke out there. Firefighters were unable to save him.\n\nHarry Archer's Death\n\nA small-town boy from Creston, Iowa, Harry Runkle Auracher had dabbled briefly in ragtime but devoted his career to his Chicago and New York jazz orchestras and to the musical theater, changing his name to Harry Archer along the way. His aspirations outweighed his achievements, but he had his moments of glory, most notably with the hit Broadway show Little Jessie James. One of the original members of the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP), Harry Archer died April 23,1960, at New York City’s Doctors Hospital, following a heart attack, and was buried at Ferncliff Cemetery, Hartsdale, Westchester County, New York.\n\nHe was survived by wife Ruth (1906-1994). Although she appeared in TV sitcoms from time to time into the 1980s, she is probably best known for playing Lillian Russell in The Great Ziegfeld (1936).\n\nRecordings of Miscellaneous Archer Compositions\n\nClick each title to hear the recording.\n\nRecordings by Harry Archer and His Orchestra\n\nClick each title to hear the recording.
