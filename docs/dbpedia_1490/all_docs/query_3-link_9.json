        "text": "'Twas just a garden in the rain,\n\nclose to a little leafy lane\n\na touch of colour 'neath skies of gray!\n\nThe raindrops kissed the flower beds\n\nthe blossoms raised their thirsty heads\n\na perfumed thank you they seem to say!\n\nSurely here was charm beyond compare to view\n\nmaybe it was just that I was there\n\nwith you!\n\n'Twas just a garden in the rain,\n\nbut then the sun came out again\n\nand sent us happily on our way!\n\nSurely here was charm beyond compare to view\n\nbut, maybe it was just that you were there dear,\n\nyou were so lovely!\n\n'Twas just a garden in the rain,\n\nbut then the sun came out again\n\nand sent us happily on our way!\n\nJust a garden in the rain!\n\nWriter(s): CARROLL GIBBONS, JAMES DYRENFORTH<br>Lyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
