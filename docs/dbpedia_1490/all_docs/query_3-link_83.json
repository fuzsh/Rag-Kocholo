        "text": "We are thrilled to host well-known UU composer, performer, poet, and activist Jim Scott on Sunday, 8/11. At 7:00 p.m., he will offer a concert featuring his new musical and multimedia presentation, “The Year to Save the Earth,” along with other songs he has written. (You may know his much loved song, “Gather the Spirit,” which we often sing, and others that are included in the UU hymnbooks.)\n\nJim Scott has brought his contemporary and multicultural music to more than 700 UU Churches over three decades. Though often filling role of “speaker,” Jim’s services are always very musical. He speaks with passion on ecology, justice and peace, and his lyrical poetry and stories are calls to action, full of hope and gentle wit. In concert, he brings his audience into an intimate gathering with guitar skill and disarming presence. As song-leader he lifts joyous participation from all.\n\nPlease help us spread the word about Jim Scott’s 8/11 appearance. Admission at the door: $20 for adults, $10 for college students, and Free for youth (18 and younger).\n\nThis is an automated email reminder for this event, please do not respond (except using methods below)\n\nThis issue will cover events during the next month. Please turn in your articles before the deadline and make sure you include all relevant details (who to contact about your event, their email or phone number, if this item should be placed on the calendar, if you wish for your information to be highlighted on the church web page, etc.).
