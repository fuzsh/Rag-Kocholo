        "text": "LanguageEnglishPages6EAN5020679525562\n\nA staple of the British dance band era, A Garden In The Rain was written in 1928 by Carroll Gibbons (1903-1954), with lyrics by James Dyrenforth (1895-1973). It was first performed and recorded by Gibbonsâ€™ own band, the Savoy Hotel Orpheans , which at the time was the resident dance band at the Savoy Hotel in London. Since then, it has been recorded many times, most famously by Gene Austin, The Four Aces, and Frank Sinatra. This classic song has been transcribed for Piano, Voice, and Guitar, with Boxed Chord symbols for easy use."
