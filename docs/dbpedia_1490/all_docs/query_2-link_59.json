The classic mammoth 1958 Gordon sci-fi feature film masterpiece was almost an unfinished production until Thompson decided to serve in an uncredited additional position as director- to complete the scenes that Crabtree* refused to work on.

Underneath the front entrance marquee at the Rialto, a mock display was constructed for interested theatergoers with a prop “creature” figurine that resembled the creature in the 1958 production and was controlled with a motor with recorded sound effects in the display. It was mentioned that the size of the interested theatergoers who saw the mock “creature” display increased significantly and caused significant delays in both pedestrian and automobile traffic.

It was mentioned that theater managers from coast-to-coast were encouraged to have a “Fiend Without a Face” mask show contest for the participants during a Saturday afternoon matinee screening of the double-feature release of “Fiend Without a Face” and “The Haunted Strangler.” The participating contestant who got the biggest applause for their “Fiend Without a Face” mask art creation would win a prize as part of a promotional tie-in with local toy stores and/or local department stores.\n\nRichard Gordon’s proposed sequel for “Fiend Without a Face”\n\nAccording to additional details from IMDB’s trivia section, it was reported that Richard Gordon had planned on doing a sequel to “Fiend Without a Face” with director Norman J.

Fun Fact: Along with Sven’s classic “Hit the Theme for Us, Chas” sound bite phrase, I also used a sound bite of Arthur Bostrom’s famous opening phrase for his “Officer Crabtree” character from “Allo, Allo!” for the opening of my 2016-17 weekly Hood College online radio series, “Yours Truly, Chris Hamby!” –C.H.\n\nThis week’s edition of “Silver Screen Reflections” is dedicated to the memory of two legends that we lost recently, including legendary actor/artist/singer and lecturer Robert Clary (1926-2022) of TV’s “Hogan’s Heroes” fame & legendary actor/animated voice-over artist Kevin Conroy (1955-2022) of TV’s “Batman: The Animated Series” fame. #RIPLegends.\n\nSvengoolie presents his big broadcast of “Fiend Without a Face” (1958), plus “Sventoonie”\n\nSat., Nov. 19 at 8 p.m. Eastern/7 p.m. Central on Me-TV\n\nTo all fellow Super Svengoolie SvenPals/fellow Super “Toon In With Me” Tooners/fellow Super readers/fellow subscribers of “Silver Screen Reflections” everywhere: Seriously, Please, please be good, kind, courteous, safe and respectful to each other.
