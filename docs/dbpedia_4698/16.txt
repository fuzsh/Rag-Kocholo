Wicklow is a constituency represented in Dáil Éireann, the lower house of the Irish parliament or Oireachtas. The constituency has an electorate of 86,763 and at present is served by 5 Teachtaí Dála (TDs). The method of election is the Single Transferable Vote.

The constituency returned three members to the Dáil Éireann in 1977 and this was increased to four members in 1981. In part this was because, in 1977, parts of the county had been placed in the constituencies of Dublin County Mid and Dublin County West [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1974/en/act/pub/0007/gen_1.html] while the 1981 constituency included the entire county. [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1980/en/act/pub/0017/gen_1.html]

The constituency spans the entire area of County Wicklow in Leinster, including the towns of Wicklow, Arklow, Greystones and Bray and includes a small part of eastern County Carlow containing the villages of Hacketstown and Rathvilly .

One of the most high profile TDs in the constituency is the current Minister of State for European Affairs, Dick Roche. Another TD, Liz McManus, is currently the deputy-leader of the Labour Party.
