The most conspicuous,feature of the security market during the past week, and in fact now for some time past, has been the persistent demand for high grade securities at either steady or advancing prices. This demand is evidenced by the eager way in which new offerings are taken up and is also reflected in the almost steady advance in the average price of high grade bonds. The Dow-Jones average of 40 bonds has advanced another eighth during the week. The attitude of investment houses toward the prospective offering of $120,000,000 Standard Oil of New Jersey 20-year 5% debentures, which are shortly to be offered through J. P. Morgan & Co., would have seemed astounding even a comparatively short time ago. As soon as it became known that the company intended to call its issue of V00,000,000 7% preferred stock and replace it in part by a new bond issue, investment houses made tentative subscriptions to make sure of obtaining a liberal proportion of the offering, and many houses have communicated with their customers offering in advance their facilities in handling the reinvestment of the proceeds of the preferred stock. The preferred stock is to be paid off at the call price 115, on March 15 next, thus removing one of the most conspicuous and sought after high rate investment issues that was characteristic of the disturbed period of adjustment that followed the war. The advance in investment bonds has been all but continuous since the middle of 1920. At that time the Dow-Jones average of 40 investment bonds reached a point just above 72. The advance of the first few months was quite rapid, the average going Bank and Quotation Section Bankers' Convention Section NO. 3204. to about 79. Then there was a hesitant period of nearly a year occasioned by the adjustments of 1921, followed by a rapid and persistent advance which reached a temporary culmination in the latter part of 1922 at approximately 92. This was succeeded by a comparatively short decline to approximately 86 in the early part of 1923, and subsequently by an advance checked only by short and small declines to the present level around 96. Furthermore, there seems to be a very general expectation among investors and bond houses that prices will go still higher and yields still lower. The situation in stocks is in some contrast. The advance of the averages from the low point in 1921 has, of course, been relatively far greater than the advance in bonds, but during the past year there have been enough cross-currents to prevent any great change in the averages. The Dow-Jones industrial average stood at 147 a year ago. During the past week it fluctuated around 155 and 156 until driven below 153 by heavy liquidation or short selling on Friday. On the other hand, during the past year there have been somewhat extensive movements up and down, the low point of 135.20 having been recorded on March 30, and the high point of 166.64 on Aug. 14. Since then the average has been down 21 points and up 11. One news development during the week has been of a very reassuring nature. Officials of the Ford Motor Co. on Saturday, Nov. 13, stated that 1926 had been a period of almost ideal operating conditions for that company, production being practically at a dead level of 6,500 cars daily, five days a week. This would work out a probable production in 1926 of 1,625,000 cars, as against 1,775,000 in 1925 and 1,790,000 in 1924. Stabilization of this most important industry at this comparatively high level is of great importance and the knowledge of it is of value, inasmuch as there has been much uncertainty as to the present volume of Ford production. That it represented a smaller proportion of the entire automobile production than a few years ago has been generally recognized, but the fear has been abroad that the decline in Ford production had been quite precipitate. The economic statistician of one of the largest automobile companies, in a recent review of the industry, estimated total production of automobiles, trucks and buses in 1926 at between 4,500,000 and 4,600,000, this figure comparing with 4,336,000 in 1925, 3,640,000 in 1924 and 4,095,000 in 1923. His estimate was based upon a production of 3,726,000 during the first nine months, an estimate of 365,000 for October and 500,000 for November and r 2558 THE CHRONICLE [Vox.. 128. December..

One other possible source of trouble remains, namely, a clash between the Government and the mine owners over drawing up the peace terms which the miners accepted.\" According to the same dispatch,\"the opinion was expressed in Government circles that the owners will not resort to obstructionist tactics by refusing to enter into district agreements for the purpose of defeating the proposal to establish an arbitration tribunal.\" • The strike of British coal miners, which has been in progress for more than six months, has not been settled. It had been expected until Thursday that the miners would vote favorably on the terms which had been accepted by their delegates at a conference last week and recommended by them to the men. At least two federations of miners were reported to have accepted, but toward the end of the week London The Executive Council of the South Wales Miners' cable advices indicated that there would be quite a \"controlling one of the biggest coal large adverse vote.

The ques- Nov. 20 1926.] THE CHRONICLE tion on which the vote was taken seems more significant than the number of votes in its favor. The New York \"Times\", representative in the French capital cabled on the evening of Nov. 12 that, \"by 365 votes to 207 the Chamber of Deputies at its first meeting to-day gave sanction to the Government's request that it abstain from all controversial, timewasting and extraneous discussion during the coming short session and,devote all its energies to passing the budget.\" He suggested, \"that vote shows clearly the position of Poincare's Government of national union. Against it have been ranked the communists, the Socialists and the extreme radicals, and a few wild men who belong to no party. But its 365 supporters are solid. With that majority there is neither danger nor doubt.\" Only four days later (Nov.16) the situation looked correspondingly bad for the Cabinet, according to Paris cable advices on that date. The New York \"Times\" representative said that \"Premier Poincare's Cabinet, of all opinions and all parties, came to-day very near disruption. It held together only because the majority,of its component parts foresaw the disaster which would follow a split and it survived in the Chamber for much the same reason.\" It ,was explained that \"Louis Mann, Minister of Pensions, was responsible. His speech last Saturday has caused such a storm of political rancor that the Cabinet had to do something abgut it.\" Announcement was made also that at a Cabinet meeting on the morning of Nov. 16 \"a joint statement was drawn up to be read by the Premier. It somewhat frankly disavowed the Minister of Pensions, laying emphasis on the fact that the opinions he expressed last Saturday were his personal opinions, not his opinions as a member of the Cabinet, and stating that he had no intention to wound his colleagues either in reputation or in party pride.\" The \"Times\" correspondent added that \"if a vote had been taken on the simple issue of M. Mann's speech, without involving the existence of the Government, there is no doubt that the majority would have been strongly against the Minister of Pensions. No one, however, is anxious just now to cause any upset and the radicals abstained from taking part in the vote so as to permit the-matter to be buried. The incident served to show very clearly the depth and keenness of po-litical party division, however united the Cabinet may be.\" The following- day (Nov. 17) the situation looked better again for the Premier and his Cabinet. It was stated in an Associated Press dispatch that 'Premier Poincare received another vote of confidence to-day when the Chamber of Deputies, at his request, defeated an amendment to the budget, offered by the radicals, 330 to 135.\" M. Berenger, who as French Ambassador to the United States, negotiated the war debt funding agreement, which the French Parliament never has ratified, offered his resignation recently to Foreign Minister Briand. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Paris on Nov. 13, the latter would not accept it, \"and M. Berenger consequently soon will return to Washington.\" It was explained that \"M. Berenger's appointment runs for six months at a time, in order that he may retain his seat in the Senate. His third six-month term will begin next month.\" The Associated Press representative like- 2561 wise stated that \"the.Ambassador has been exerting his great personal influence in Parliament, especially in the Senate, in favor of ratifying the Washington debt agreement, appearing before committees and having long individual conversations with the members.\" Much was made in Paris cable dispatches at the beginning of the week of a call of Reginald McKenna, former British Chancellor of the Exchequer, on Premier Poincare of France in Paris on Nov. 13. The former was quoted in a special Paris cable dispatch to the New York \"Times\" the next day as saying \"it was merely a courtesy visit.\" He added that \"on the Premier's side the same reticence was maintained.\" He asserted, nevertheless, that \"to-day, however, a different character is being put on the visit at least to the extent that the courtesy has been enlarged. Mr. McKenna came on a mission and not as a tourist. He came as spokesman, not only of British, but also of American banks, not to give M. Poincare advice, but to-indicate to him what would be done in the happy event of France seeing fit to ratify the debt agreements with her creditors and in the other happy event of her stabilizing her money.\" Continuing, the same correspondent declared that \"Mr. McKenna's visit was made to lay before the Premier an outline of the help which France could count upon in the event of her stabilizing the franc, as the Belgians have done. He has denied that there was any question of a loan discussed between the two, and this, of course, is perfectly accurate. The matter has not yet reached that point. The message which he did, however, leave with the Premier, to be communicated in interested quarters was that both British and American financiers were prepared to make large and continuous investments in French industries if and when the franc was stabilized, investments which would enormously help in the debt payments.\" The correspondent readily admitted that \"what influence the conversation will have on the Premier's policy it is far too early to guess. He is anxious that, so far as possible, stabilization of the franc should be done by France alone, without too great a recourse to foreign credit, and it will be some time before he will be able to see his way clear. Nothing certainly will be done until after the passage of the budget toward the end of December.\" Paris apparently expects important developments with regard to Government financing. Its attitude may be based somewhat on an announcement at that centre on Nov. 14. The Paris representative of the New York \"Times\" said that \"an announcement today by the Government of a 7% sinking fund consolidation loan to replace the 6% Credit National bonds of 1922, maturing in February next, is considered in financial circles as an indication that the Government intends to proceed in this manner with the remainder of the short-term debt, and therefore no forced consolidation is expected.\" Further details of the plan were given in part as follows: \"The interest on the new bonds will be based on the nor mal value of 500 francs, but as the issue is offered at 460 and is payable in ten years at 525, actual interest will be about 8.1%. The issue will be free of all special taxes and can be exchanged for the maturing 1922 bonds or purchased for cash—but only to the amount of bonds presented for redemption, approxi- 2562 THE CHRONICLE mately 1,350,000,000 francs. The total outstanding is 3,040,000,000. The balance matures in February 1932. A safety clause provides that at least 20% from the fourth to the sixth year and 50% from the seventh to the tenth year is the minimum of the annual portion that must be withdrawn. Therefore if the Government is pressed in other directions it reserves the right to retire less than the maximum annual portion. As the 1922 bonds are redeemable at 507 francs 50 centimes and the new bonds are issued at 460, those who choose consolidation will be paid 47 francs 50 centimes cash.\" The \"Times\" representative added that \"it is understood that the Treasury could have met the February maturity of 1,350,000,000, but preferred to consolidate the bonds and provide an annual sinking fund in the budget which must be used each year in retiring a maximum of one-tenth of the total issue of 525 francs or purchase bonds in the open market. In this manner the whole issue can be retired in ten years easily in the ordinary normal process.\" 128. The Government has refunded 200,000,000 francs to the bank, the report showed. The Chamber meantime, is continuing its work on the budget and, goaded by Premier Poincare's repeated declarations that 'time is precious,' is approving one division after another. It now appears that the Premier will be able to get the entire budget rushed through before the Christmas holidays.\" The franc had another sharp advance yesterday. Judging from Paris cable advices the speech of President Coolidge at Kansas City last week, in which he discussed at considerable length the payment of international obligations and made it clear that the Administration will insist upon the reservations, without the acceptance of which by Europe, the United States would not enter the World Court, has caused wide comment on the other side of the Atlantic. At any rate, on Nov. 12, the Paris representative of the New York \"Times\" cabled that \"President Coolidge's Kansas City speech has been read in France with amazement and an effort at The sharp advances in the French franc have comprehension which has failed.

The problems thus selected will form the agenda for the approaching conference.\" The \"Times\" correspondent called attention to the fact also that \"the Preparatory Committee was established last year by the Assembly following a resolution presented by Louis Loucheur of France.\" will meet at regular stated intervals to examine the situation. It is generally considered that the organization could best be established under the League of Nations, but out of respect to Washington's fear of all things of League character, it will probably be wholly independent of Geneva.\" At Tuesday's session of the Preparatory Committee,\" Chairman Dubois of the sub-committee on financial problems suggested that certain new questions be added to the potential agenda of his section and asked that the League of Nations financial documents be used as a basis of information. M. Dubois urged the necessity of stabilizing the purchasing power of gold. Discussing the economic situation in Europe, he said high discount rates were one of the causes of economic difficulties. Central banks by có-ordinating their work had made a good step forward, but capital should be made more available in order that the difficulty of discount rates might be overcome. While he stated that public finance was really outside the limits of an economic conference, which despite financial aspects should not take up work belonging to a financial conference, M. Dubois pointed out the danger of short-term public debts. When such debts comprise big sums Governments risk demand for repayment, with possible disastrous effects. At present these debts exist in such tremendous amounts as to prevent a reduction of discount rates.\" Announcement was made in a special Geneva cable message to the New York \"Times\" on Nov. 18 that \"the draft of the agenda for the International Economic Conference was approved to-day by the Preparatory Committee, and instead of being agenda for a constructive conference it is merely a program for a general consultation by Government representatives. It may be hoped that this consultation, when it comes, will pave the way for a real conference at which agreements and recommendations for improving world economic conditions will be adopted. Next May 4 is suggested as the meeting day.\" The opening session, as usual at such gatherings, \"was given over to formalities.\" M. Theunis of Belgium presided. It was noted in a special Geneva dispatch to the New York \"Times\" that \"38 experts, representing the industrial and economic thought of 23 nations, were present.\" The same correspondent added that \"the meeting, which was given over to formalities, none the less exposed the tremendous grip which the proposed conference has taken on the world. Approbation of world-wide industry has become a great force for economic betterment of the world.\" Continuing his outline of the possibilities of the conference he said: \"A score of the world's greatest industrial organizations have prepared for the committee exhaustive reports on phases of the industries with which they are familiar and the International Chamber of Commerce has presented an important document on tariffs through Sir Arthur Balfour. Organizations which aided in the first step of the work include the German iron and steel industries, the American Iron & Steel Institute, the French Comite des Forges, Italian Metallurgical Industries, the German mining industry, the French National Federation of Underground Workers, the Comite des Houilleres de France and the Mining Association of Britain. From Secretary Houston of the United States came a document on rationalization and standardization of industry, who at the same time wrote an interesting letter on the effects of the non-existence of barriers-on the economic development of the United States. Eighty documents, representing perhaps the greatest collection of industrial and economic information ever compiled, has been prepared for the committee by experts, by industries and by Governments.\" He likewise declared that \"the same ideas are held by most European Governments. Therefore it seems that what the committee will do is to suggest agreement between the nations to stop irrational and erratic changes in tariff schedules, which are the greatest impediments to continental trade. Probably they will be asked to give a year's notice of changes. At the same time it will suggest the extension of the most favored nation's treaties between European countries. The second most important question probably is that of private industrial agreements. This forms the basis of a recommendation rather than a convention. The recent agreement in the steel industry is a good example. The form of agreement can be extended to all industries with a big financial basis and standard products. There also will be an effort to establish an economic council which 2563 Premier Mussolini continues in the limelight as much as ever. Apparently he has no fear of the assassin, although six well-defined attacks have been made on his life publicly within a comparatively short time. The Associated Press representative in Rome cabled on Nov. 13 that \"Premier Mussolini, who preaches the doctrine 'live dangerously,' is living up to it by mapping out a program for the future which will carry him more than ever before the public, despite pleas that he protect himself by seclusion from further attempts at assassination. Protection by keeping out of the public eye, the Duce feels, according to those close to him, would be treason to the Italian people, who see in him a symbol of the nation's spirit of indomitable fearlessness. Keeping in the limelight may be an optional privilege for the ordinary Mortal, but it is an obligation and a duty for a generalissimo who preaches the doctrine 'Live dangerously! Risk should not be the spice but the staff of life for a weak nation which dares hope to be strong.' Practicing what he preaches, the Premier, since the recent attack upon him at Bologna, has shown himself in public at every opportunity.

According to the weekly Statement of the Bank of France a further contraction of 862,715,000 francs occurred in note circulation, therefore bringing the total of that item down to 54,064,189,046 francs. .This compares with 47,943,223,555 francs at the corresponding date last year and 40,530,277,515 francs the year before. Advances to the State also showed a favorable change. The Government repaid 200,000,000 francs during the week; reducing its indebtedness to the Bank to 35,850,000,000 francs. At the same date in 1925, advances to the State stood at 31,100,000,000 francs and in 1-924 at 22,900,000,000 francs. The usual small gain in gold • of 2,600 francs brought that total up to 5,548,797,100 francs. Gold holdings last year at this time aggregated 5,547,625,925 francs and in 1924 5,544,600,794 francs. Other changes in the Bank's weekly report were: Silver increased 10,000 francs; bills discounted 66,533,000 francs, and general deposits, 519,813,000 francs. On the other hand advances to trade decreased 75,514,000 francs and treasury deposits fell off 17,049,000 francs.

Moreover, gold holdings continue to expand. For the System as a whole, there was an increase in gold of $9,300,000. Rediscounting of Government secured paper increased slightly, $800,000, but rediscounts of other bills fell $15,200,000, so that total bills discounted 2565 for the week were reduced $14,400,000. Open market purchases increased $7,900,000. Total bills and securities (earning assets) rose $1,400,000, while member bank reserve accounts were augmented by $19,600,000, and deposits moved up $36,300,000. The amount of Federal Reserve notes in actual circulation remained practically stationary, declining $500,000, so. that the total amount still is over $1,750,000,000, as against $1,708,000,000 last year. The report of the New York Bank was along closely parallel lines. Gold increased $29,700,000. Rediscounting of all classes of paper fell $26,800,000, which brought total bills discounted down to $90,233,000, as against $147,977,000 a year ago. Holdings of bills bought in the open market, however, increased $10,300,000. Total bills and securities declined $9,000,000. Increases occurred of $13,900,000 in member bank reserve accounts and $16,100,000 in deposits. The amount of Federal Reserve notes in actual circulation increased by $13,000,000. As to reserve ratios, larger deposits served to nullify the effect of gains in gold reserves, so far as the report of the System is concerned. Consequently, the reserve ratio for the combined banks declined 0.3%, to 73.7%, although at New York a gain of 0.4%, to 84.9%, occurred. Last Saturday's statement of the New York Clearing House banks and trust companies showed a small addition to surplus reserves, notwithstanding heavy expansion in deposits. The loan item declined $12,961,000. Net demand deposits were increased $54,615,000, and time deposits $2,941,000, the latter to $627,619,000. The total of demand deposits was $4,363,683,000, which excludes Government deposits amounting to 427,806,000, a falling off in the latter item for the week of $4,906,000. Cash in own vaults of members of the Feder-al Reserve Bank declined $1,897,000, to $46,112,000; this, however, does not count as reserve. State bank and trust company reserves in 'own vaults decreased $720,000, and the reserves of these same institutions kept in other depositories declined $353,000. An expansion in the reserves of member banks in the Federal Reserve institution of $12,033,000, was sufficient to offset enlarged deposits and bring about a gain in surplus of $3,675,420; thereby increasing excess reserves to $16,281,630, as compared with $12,606,210 a week ago. Surplus reserves are calculated on the basis of the requirement of 13% legal reserve, against demand deposits for member banks of the Federal Reserve System, but do not include $46,112,000 cash in vault held by these members on Saturday last. Loans were called to a great extent and rates on demand accommodations higher at the beginning of the week than had been predicted. The payment of from $20,000,000 to $25,000,000 on each of those two days is said to have been asked for. The maximum loaning rate was 5%.

Friday irregular weakness developed and there was a further slight recession in quotations to 4 84%@4 84 5-16 for demand and 4 84%@4 84 13-16 for cable transfers; trading was dull and narrow. Closing quotations were 4 84 5-16 for demand and 4 84 13-16 for cable transfers. Commercial sight bills finished at 4 84 3-16, sixty days at 4 80 3-16, ninety days at 4 78 5-16, documents for payment (sixty days) at 4 80 7-16, and seven-day grain bills at 4 83 9-16. Cotton and grain for payment closed at 4 84 3-16. No gold was engaged for export or import, although it is understood that the Belgian National Bank has bought here,in New York the sum of $2,500,000 gold bullion for the purpose of strengthening its reserve. This is the first step in carrying out the recently arranged plan for supporting Belgian stabilization measures. The Bank of England was less active in the transfer of gold. Reports showed the sale of 00,000 in gold bars and exports of sovereigns to India and the Straits Settlements of approximately L40,000. In the Continental exchanges, while trading was little more than intermittently active, the undertone of the market was generally buoyant and new high records were established in Frefich currency, as well as in Norwegian krone. As a matter of fact most of the week's activities centered around these two exchanges, while the remainder of the list was neglected. French francs, after opening at 3.3032, rose to 3.36; 2, the highest lost 3 points and then shot up to 3.623/ This is especially April. point touched since last interesting when it is remembered that less than four months ago francs were selling at a record low level of 1.96. The strength was due primarily to the steady return of funds, that had previously been withdrawn, to the French capital, which movement was in turn based on the encouragement felt over the prospects of satisfactory debt adjustment and the lack of really serious friction in the debates in the French Parliament. However, not a few of the more experienced market observers are showing alarm over the sensational rise in francs, pointing out that this gait cannot be maintained and that it is likely to work grave hardship tp French business interests. Paris cable despatches intimate that the rise is causing uneasiness in trade circles, particularly as regards exports. Prices have shown a declining tendency but not enough to warrant so drastic an adlately, • vance in exchange values, and exporters are already are complaining of cancellations, while tourist traffic has fallen off materially of late. No hint has been received of the nature of Premier Poincare's valuation • plans, though it is believed they will involve extensive deflation. Local bankers are of the opinion that the franch should have been stabilized on a much lower basis. Heavy buying by a bank that usually acts as agent for the Bank of France, sent prices to the top for the week, and led to the belief that the Government was not altogether opposed to the rise. 2567 Italian lire opened up barely steady at around 4.13 but later rose to 4.25 in response to the issuance of the so-called Lictor Loan, which is perhaps more generally known as the famous forced 5% consolidation loan of 20,000,000,000 lire. This created an inquiry for Italian exchange with consequent strength in quotations, although before the close there was a drop to 4.17 on realizing sales. Belgian francs were inactive and a trifle easier, ruling at close to the equivalent of 13.90 for the belga. Inquiry among bankers and foreign exchange dealers reveals the fact that there has been a gradual return to the use of the Antwerp belga. Following the creation of this new unit, a general outbreak of dissatisfaction arose, principally over bookkeeping difficulties because of the fact that the Belgian authorities were maintaining of franc quotation for home use. It develops, however, that practically all of the New York houses are now quoting Belgian exchange in the new belgas. For this reason it has been deemed expedient to quote the belga in place of the franc. German marks sustained a further fractional decline to 23.713/2, although actual trading was very light. Greek drachmae remained stationary at around 1.23, while the minor Central European division was practically unchanged and exceptionally dull. The London check rate on Paris finished at 137.00 against 145.50 last week. In New York,sight bills on the French centre closed at 3.59, against 3.303/2; cable transfers at 3.60, against 3.313/ 2, and commercial sight bills at 3.58, against 3.293/2 a week ago. Antwerp belgas finished the week at 13.91% for checks and at 13.913/ 2 for cable transfers. Reichmarks closed at 23.72 for checks and at 23.74 for cable transfers, against 23.73 and 23.75 a week earlier. Austrian schillings finished at 143/8, unchanged. Lire closed at 4.17 for bankers' sight bills and at 4.18 for cable transfers, in comparison with 4.14% and 4.15% last week. Exchange on Czechoslovakia finished at 2.96% (unchanged); on Bucharest at 0.54%, against 0.55%; on Poland at 11.50 (unchanged), and on Finland at 2.52% (unchanged). Greek exchange closed at 1.23% for checks and at 1.234 for cable transfers, Last week the close was 1.22 and 1.223/ 2. • Attention once more reverted to movements in the former neutral exchanges, as a result of .another kaleidoscopic outburst of strength and activity in Norwegian currency. Following an opening quotation Of 25.00, Oslo remittances shot up sensationally to 25.96, or the highest level since 1919, and less than 1 cent under parity. The advance in reality occurred abroad and was said to be due to heavy buying by German interests. It is understood that the Norwegian Government disapproves the advance at this time, but is unwilling to take the necessary steps for curbing the movement. It is now rumored that Norway will likely be upon a gild basis by the turn of the year. Lcical trading was only moderately active. Danish and Swedish currencies were well maintained, but not ,essentially altered. Dutch guilders were heavy, though slightly above the low levels of last week until Friday, when there was a slump to 39.95. Swiss francs remain at very close to 19.28. Spanish pesetas showed signs of renewed speculative activity and moved up from 15.14 to 15.27, although before the close considerable of this gain was lost. The same is true of the Norwegian krone,which declined to 25.58011 profittaking sales. 2568 THE CHRONICLE' Bankers' sight on Am4terdam finished at 39.95, against 39.98; cable transfers at 39.97, against 40.01, and commercial sight bills at 39.91, against 39.95 last week. Swiss francs closed at 19.27 for bankers' sight bills and at 19.28 for cable transfers. Last week the close was 19.283/ and 19.293/2.

The British Empire in Conference. The meeting of the British Imperial Conference, the ninth in order of time and the second since the World War, which began at London on Oct. 19, was looked forward to in some quarters with a good deal of apprehension. In spite of the impressive demonstration which such a conference always affords of the extent, variety and political resources of the Empire, some fear was felt lest the decisions of the Conference, when its deliberations should have been concluded, might be found to have weakened the Imperial bond and dimmed British world prestige. It was pointed out that Great Britain alone had adhered to the Locarno 'pacts, and that none of the Dominions had .as yet shown a disposition tO join the mother country in those agreements. The spectre of Imperial disunion had been raised when General Hertzog, Premier of the Union of South Africa, had pictured South Africa as \"a free and independent State, with the right to international recognition by foreign Powers, but with a common connecting link between itself and Great Britain centred in the King.\" The controversy between Mr. Mackenzie King, Liberal Premier of Canada, and Governor- • General Byng, over a constitutional isue, followed by a general election, the defeat of the short-lived Conservative Government, and the triumphant return to power of Mr. King, was fresh in mind, and its political implications were variously interpreted. Nov. 20 1926.] THE CHRONICLE British statesmen and publicists have tried hard, during the past few years, to replace the term British Empire with the term British Commonwealth of Nations, but there were those who doubted whether even this phraseology, suggestive of a federation of self-governing States, would, long accurately describe the situation if disintegrating tendencies were to continue to operate. Although the sessions of the Conference have been secret and an adjournment has not yet been reached, enough is known of the decisions of the Conference to permit a preliminary judgment of the accuracy of these predictions. The Empire is still intact, loyalty to the King has not been jeopardized, and the vast contribution of Great Britain to Imperial naval defense has been effectively exhibited in a review of the fleet. For such evidences of political solidarity the friends of the Empire will be grateful. Indications are not lacking, on the other hand, that the Imperial bond has been further eased under pressure of the demand of the Dominions for greater autonomy, and that at a number of points the hopes of the home Government have apparently not been realized. If, as has been intimated, the Conference has been unable to agree upon a formula which should reconcile the historical conception of an Empire with such advanced views of Dominion independence as are held by General Hertzog, certain decisions of the Conference suggest that, in practice, the Dominions may hereafter largely determine their own policy. Three decisions in particular invite comment. Article IX of the Locarno treaty of mutual guarantee provides that \"the present treaty shall impose no obligation upon any of the British Dominions, or upon India, unless the Government of such Dominion, or of India, signifies its acceptance thereof.\" While the action of Sir Austen Chamberlain, the British Foreign Secretary, in signing the treaty, appears to have been approved by the members of the present Imperial Conference without dissent, the Dominion Premiers are reported to have agreed that it would be better, in the interest of Imperial unity, not to give their adherence. The most pronounced reluctance appears to have been shown by Canada, Australia and the Irish Free State, neither of which saw anything to be gained by signing, although Australia was reported as willing to sign if the otbprs did. New Zealand and Newfoundland, while willing to sign, were prepared to do sO only with material reservations. The decision, which appears to have been anxiously awaited in the Dominions as well as in Great Britain, marks an important step in the development of British Imperial policy in Europe. The only interpretation that can be put upon the action of the Conference is that the Dominions, although ready to give their moral support to the course of the British Government in an international matter of considerable importance for Europe, are not disposed to allow themselves to be involved in European i)olitical arrangements with which they are not directly concerned. In other words, they have asserted a right of independent judgment as to what is or is not an Imperial affair. Most political propositions'have their corollaries, and the corrolary in this case is evident. If the Dominions are to reserve to themselves the right to refrain from giving formal adherence to an international agreement to which Great Britain is a party, ;they may with equal propriety claim the right to con- 2569 dude diplomatic agreements of their own with foreign States, independently of the home Government. Such a contention has already been indicated by the course of the Irish Free State in filing copies of treaties with the League of Nations on its own account, and not through the intermediary of the British Foreign Office. To...this extent, then, the demand of General Hertzog for \"the right to international recognition by foreign Powers\" appears to have been conceded in principle, as it has already been clearly foreshadowed in the recognition of the Dominions and India as signatories of the Treaty of Versailles. A further step in the direction of greater autonomy,akin, indeed, to independence, has been taken in the appointment by the Mackenzie King Government of a Canadian Minister to the United States. It is reported that a similar appointment by Australia is in contemplation. The question of a Canadian Minister at Washington has been discussed off and on for several years, and although the Washington Administration appears to have taken no steps as yet to appoint a Minister for Canada, the wishes of Canada in the matter will doubtless be met in due course. The action of Canada is even more significant than the decision of the Conference to refrain from signing the Locarno pact, as evidence of the extent to which the old idea of the Empire has changed. With the Irish Free State already represented at Washington, the British Ambassador will hereafter be only one of several spokesmen for British interests, and the opinion of the Empire will be the collective opinion of its various self-governing parts. A third step, economic rather than political in character, appears in the reported intention of Canada, Australia and New Zealand to adopt the American plan of restricted immigration. As long as free migration within the Empire obtained, unemployment in Great Britain could be in some measure met by migration to the overseas possessions, but with restricted immigration in force, that means of relief.will no longer be so fully available. The decision may bear hard upon the present acute unemployment situation in Great Britain, where the majority of the unemployed are industrial laborers, and where it has been hoped that immigration overseas might afford substantial relief. Canada, however, is reported to desire only agriculturists, and only selected persons, presumably with some capital or a record of efficiency, within that class, and the labor needs of Australia and New Zealand appear to be much the same. Once more the old conception of the Empire is to be modified, this time by the erection of immigration bars and the establishment of quotas or admission standards. It may very well turn out that Canada, to the extent to which it is able to draw agriculturists from England, may increase still further the difficulties of the British farmers and the dependence of Great Britain upon imported food, unless the British Government can devise a means of inducing its unemployed industrial workers to go upon the land, but the policy of Canada seems to be that of caring first for the needs of its own people and the development of its own resources. These are some of the larger fruits of the Imperial Conference as thus far made known. They indicate further substantial progress in the direction of independence within the Empire, and a widening of the field of Dominion self-government. A common race, a common speech, a common law and a common his. 2570 THE CHRONICLE tory still suffice to insure essential unity, and cooperation in Imperial business may be counted upon to -operate as Imperial problems arise, but the Empire itself undergoes continual change. For most purposes the British Dominions have become autonomous States, free of obligations save such as inhere in loyalty and good-will. It is to the credit of British common sense that it accepts the inevitable with good grace, and that the political children of the Empire do not seem to lose affection for the common mother as they more and more pursue their several ways. The Trend Indicated by Labor Banks. Mr. Frank Parker Stockbridge, writing on what he terms \"The New Capitalism\" in the \"Saturday Evening Post\" of Nov. 6, finds a significant trend in the establishment of labor banks. As the basis of his claims he sets out in the beginning of his article, that \"there are in operation in the United States 37 labor banks, with resources ranging individually from $200,000 to nearly $27,000,000, and aggregating more than $120,000,000. There are eleven investment corporations entirely owned and controlled by organized labor, with aggregate paid-in capital of $34,000,000. Besides that pool of more than $150,000,000, which labor absolutely controls, there are banking resources of more than $100,000,000 in the investment of which labor has a not inconsiderable say. . . . New labor banks are being projected and organized at the rate of dozens a year. I was told in one place of 50 which are expected to be in operation before the end of 1927. The whole movement is less than six years old, most of the institutions less than three. Only a small portion of the cirganized workers in the United States and Canada are as yet participants in the new capitalism, probably fewer than 10% of the important labor groups included in the membership of the American Federation of Labor, the railroad brotherhoods and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers. Yet they are already operating in the field of big business with somewhere around $250,000,000 of capital, operating successfully, making money collectively and individually, converting their constituencies into investors, and through their collective investing power sitting at the table with capital in its most concentrated forms and finding capital not only not aloof but genuinely friendly.\" • We shall later refer to other points made by this writer, but as his main argument is based on the fact that labor has entered the banking business, we now quote his conclusion: \". . . There is no doubt whatever that American labor is headed toward the goal'of the control of American industry, not alone in the indirect sense in which its collective purchasing power already makes it largely the dictator of what industry shall produce, but by such a degree of actual ownership, as shareholder and bonded creditor,as to insure the stability of its own job, to make the payroll rather than the dividend the first financial objective of business. The road on which labor has started, with its conversion of workers into capitalists, leads definitely in that direction. Unless an at present unthinkable letting down of the immigration bars or some unforeseeable cataclysm blocks the path, that is where labor seems bound eventually to arrive.\" The growth in the number of workingmen who are becoming investors in stocks and bonds of [Vol,. 123 railroad, public utility and other corporations, Mr. Stockbridge does not pass by, but there is confusion in classing these with actual ownership of 51% of shares in labor banks by the unions. Several of the significant points brought out by this writer are that these labor banks have been started by individual unions, such as the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Amalgamated Clothing Workers, and not by the A. F. of L., which has taken no position in the matter; that they have not confined their business in deposits and loans to members of these unions, as evidenced in the case of the Cleveland bank, the largest and most successful of all of them, \"while nearly two-thirds of the Cleveland bank's deposits are in savings accounts, only about 14% of the total of these are in the names of members of the Brotherhood; that while these labor banks are controlled in majority ownership of stock and in the directorate by the unions, in their early administrative direction they were manned by experienced bankers hired for the purpose; that they have \"played the game\" from the standpoint of capital rather than labor socalled, obeying the financial rules of sound banking; and that by reason of the chain bank system they have been enabled to take part in large banking enterprises and to become dealers in stocks and bonds by virtue of easy access to their memberships. We see no reason why this adventure into business should not take place. If these unions have the money they may enter the banking or any other business: It is for the unions to decide whether it is politic or not, whether this is the real purpose of unionization. It is proper to wish them well, and as stated in the article they find no antagonism voiced by what is termed \"entrenched\" capital. But we find in the major fact not revolution but evolution; not confirmation of many of the claims and activities of the historic unions, but abandonment of radical claims and the adoption of established business principles. Saying this we do not foresee the early control of \"industry\" by the unions. Two hundred and fifty millions, whether in resources or in capital stock alone, the author is not quite clear on the point, is not a formidable amount in industry as a whole. There is a long road ahead before \"labor\" will sit around all the boards and exercise a directing voice. There are forty million workers, between three and four millions organized. The profits and savings extended over one hundred and fifty years in the United States constitute the capital of the country. Organized labor in six or sixty years can secure but a small portion of it. While labor is saving existing capital is adding to its own stock. It will continue to do so alongside \"labor's\" investment enterprises, unless Leninism does take the helm and destroy all. Leaping at conclusions is an easy *ay to reap the harvest. More, banking and bonding investments, are only one way in which capital works. Manufactures, agriculture, mining, and in a less degree, transportation, for all of workers' investments in stocks, are far from being owned by labor shareholders, welcome as these are. This writer himself notes the fact that at the outset the Cleveland labor bank promised the \"depositors of savings accounts a share in the profits in addition to their regular 4% intereSt,\" a practice which he says has been \"discontinued.\" Now, there have been \"mutual\"savings banks for scores of years, limited in scope and investments and distributing Nov. 20 1926.] THE CHRONICLE practically all gains over the costs of operation. Labor has not only introduced no new principle in banking, but has adopted the old and time-tried principles, and largely thereby has succeeded. But is it to be supposed that it can, by buying control of manufacture, exercise the same powers? What is to become of the old capital in light of the new? Will it be any different sort of capital because new or because of new owners? We find in this advent into new fields surrender rather than triumph. The idea is advanced that when labor does obtain financial control it will consider wages first and profits afterward. But can there be any wages without first profits? Can enterprise and industry pay wages by devouring its own capital? Again, and the dilemma is patent, if labor ownership should be superimposed, can management fatten by leaning on the consuming power of labor employed and nothing else? And there are many obstacles to be overcome. The future of industry cannot be entirely divorced from its past. Continued depressions may affect even well-regulated labor banks. Six years in an upward trend is a short time. Old capital is, as it always has been, welcoming to new enterprise; it will help when it can, and also when it must. Only alarmists talk otherwise; only extremists see revolution in the dust of whirlwinds. River Transportation. Improvement of interior waterways is a subject over which the whole people may enthuse. There are present signs of fulfillment, but we think it impolitic to promise the benefits in a few years. Time is necessary and hundreds of millions o money. No pork barrel scheme of haphazard expenditures should be tolerated. Congress in the last quarter of a century has wasted more than enough in this way. There are two principal objects involved—reclamation of lands subject to overflow and the deepening and controlling of the channels and currents of the rivers. These objects dovetail -together. And if the farm relief agitation accomplishes the purpose of starting into activity this mighty and useful work it will have performed some service to the country at large. But ,it is not wise to promise an immediate help from so gigantic an undertaking. To resolve to do it thoroughly is the first step. You cannot sit for half an hour at Riverside Drive without noting the barge traffic on the Hudson. Viewing the Mississippi from the Eads Bridge is, by contrast, a woeful disappointment. There is no barge traffic worth mentioning. A few small sternwheel steamboats and a modicum of freight piled up on the levees, shows how little these streams, the Missouri, Mississippi and Ohio, serve the people, and especially the farmers, of these vast valley territories. Yet it is possible, subject to difficulties ine"
