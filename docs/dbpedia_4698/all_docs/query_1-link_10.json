        "text": "About me\n\nHi, Aodhán here,\n\nI wanted to tell you a bit about why I want to represent you and Dublin in Europe.\n\nYou see, Dublin is more than a city to me. It’s made up of the people and places that have moulded me into the person I am today.\n\nI was born here, went to school and college here, and spent my teaching career here. Now as a politician, it's my mission to give back to the place and people who have given me so much.\n\nI love and believe in Dublin. And, I want to make it a Dublin for all. Not just those who were born here, but those who come here from every corner of Ireland and the world. Together we can make Dublin a better place for everyone to live, work and raise a family.\n\nA fairer, better, safer Dublin for everyone who lives here.\n\nI believe our place in Europe is key to building a better future for Dublin and its citizens.\n\nThe values and solidarity that bind the members of the European Union have never been more important or more under siege. The threat of the far right looms large across Europe and Putin’s war in Ukraine continues.\n\nI am determined to use my voice in Europe to stand up to these threats to democracy and humanity. But to do that, I need your vote.\n\nI’ve spent the past 20 years fighting for the people and causes I believe in. I’ve campaigned to extend library opening times, advocated for our schools, and demanded people battling addiction be supported and treated with dignity and respect.\n\nI am committed to fighting for what’s right and to representing all the people who live here. I want to make Dublin the best city to live, work and raise a family in.\n\nSo please trust me with your vote and allow me to represent Dublin in Europe.\n\nWhy I got involved in politics\n\nTeaching in the North Inner City exposed me to some of the brutal inequalities that exist in Irish society but also to the incredible resilience and power of people working together to achieve change.\n\nRunning for the local elections in 2004 I wanted to open a local library on a Saturday. Now I want to give every child in Ireland the chance to achieve their potential in a just and equal Ireland.\n\nMy priorities\n\nPeople in Dublin Bay North want to feel proud of their individual communities. To be able to be a child, to raise children or to grow older in a safe and empowering environment where people help to lift each other.\n\nWe want to play our part in addressing the big issues of our time: health, housing, education, equality and climate change. Defending the public space, public services and the public good.\n\nMy background\n\nA Northsider educated in St. Oliver Plunkett's NS, Gaelscoil Míde and Malahide Community School, I attended UCD and Marino Institute of Education.\n\nI spent 11 years as a teacher in the Sheriff Street area of the North Inner City.\n\nI was elected to Dublin City Council for the North Inner City in 2004, re-elected to DCC for Clontarf in 2009 and then to Dáil Éireann in 2011 for the Dublin North Central constituency.\n\nI served as Minister of State for Equality, New Communities, Culture and the National Drugs Strategy from 2014 to 2016.\n\nI was elected to Seanad Éireann in 2016 and founded Irish Stand to tackle Trump's regime from the Irish-Amercan perspective.\n\nRe-elected to Dáil Éireann in 2020 I now serve as Labour's spokesperson on Education, Enterprise and Trade.\n\nClubs and Committees\n\nMember of Oireachtas Education Committee"
