        "text": "As the hotel is currently being refurbished, General Manager Michael McCarthy explained to the Irish Independent that they are giving away items – such as carpet and furniture - to anyone who is willing to take them.\n\nHe explained the decision was made to avoid waste as many items would be discarded: “I think it was my mother that came up with the idea, she said ‘somebody is going to have use for this’”.\n\nFor example, the manager explained they are changing their old carpet: “It’s good carpet, but it’s time for us to change the style and theme of our bedrooms and our corridors.”\n\nAfter announcing it on their social media pages, that same carpet was used by people in many different ways: “We’ve had people putting it around base of trees to keep weeds down, we’ve had people using it for hallways, for stairs, to cover turf, there’s several different reasons people come and take it.”\n\nToday's News in 90 Seconds - June 27th\n\nThis is the latest of a number of initiatives launched by the Falls Hotel to keep their carbon neutral status, which they earned four years ago.\n\nMr McCarthy said: “It started off joining Green Tourism, there was a benchmark to get to the first goal, and each year we would try to improve, whether that’s our water consumption or energy consumption, or our kitchen waste. And we’re still improving.\n\n“There’s only two carbon neutral hotels in Ireland and we’re one of them. We’re carbon neutral for nearly four years. We generate our own electricity, we have a water turbine which runs off the river. We get 70-75% of our energy from the river.\n\nMr McCarthy explained that being carbon neutral means looking at many details: “Everything we look at we see where we buy something, where we source it, how far it has to travel.\n\nHe added: “To remain carbon neutral we need to plant 100 trees per year, so we do that and we have our own tree nursery as well, so we grow our own trees from seeds, and we also buy some, some fruits trees, apple, pear, cherry trees.”\n\nMany projects are also in the pipelines as the manager described the sustainable work at the hotel as “hard but rewarding”.\n\nHe said: “Two years ago we planted a new orchard In the hotel, last year we did another orchard. You can see the orchard now is two years old and it’s starting to bear fruit so I’d imagine that orchard in five years’ time is going to look incredible. There’s 70 fruit trees in our main orchard and 30 in the smaller one.\n\n“We’re also putting our own greenhouse in the hotel this year, which is similar to what was in the hotel maybe 100 years ago, hopefully it will be completed later this year.”"
