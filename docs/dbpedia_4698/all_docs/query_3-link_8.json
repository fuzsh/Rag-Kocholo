        "text": "In the parable, the prodigal son returned to a fatted calf. When David Wright returned home from the US, he was presented with a fatted Celtic Tiger in the shape of the position of general manager in his father's bar and what he says he believed was a claim on 50 per cent of the busy Dublin establishment.\n\nMore than anyone else, the man at the centre of a constructive dismissal case in the Employment Appeals Tribunal knows what this half share in the Galway Hooker bar at Heuston station could be worth. David Wright (31) is suing the owner of the Galway Hooker - who happens to be his father, Michael Wright - claiming he fired him from his job. The family owns a lucrative fish business in Howth and several bars and restaurants. He also claims he is entitled to half of the bar.\n\nIt looks like being the mother of all family rows.\n\nBefore they started admitting only those people with train tickets at 10 a.m. on a Sunday, the Galway Hooker was something of a haven for party stragglers, students and those who, after an extended Saturday night on the town, just didn't want to go home.\n\nThe bar at Heuston station is one of the few places in town where alcohol is served that early on a Sunday. Those who are really desperate can buy a ticket to Destination Anywhere to avail of early drink. For much of the week when rail passengers file in with their bags and rucksacks, the Galway Hooker, which also serves food, does a roaring trade.\n\nDavid Wright had spent 10 years in the US working in and managing bars before returning home to become general manager of the Galway Hooker when it opened in December 1997. During those 10 years he had 15 separate addresses. He denied this week that the job offer had represented something of a lifeline from his family. When asked if he was the prodigal son, he said he was one of three prodigal sons.\n\nIn addition to his salary, he understood that some day half the bar would be his. It was never put in writing because father and son were close, Wright jnr said at this week's hearing. However, instead of receiving a 50 per cent stake in the business to which he claims he is now entitled, Wright jnr says he was sacked after an argument last November concerning bar manager Liz Hunter.\n\nHe thought the woman, who had 14 years in the business and had managed several high-profile bars, was not up to the job. His father disagreed, saying, according to David, she was the most loyal person he could have employed. Harsh words were exchanged and it seems he was asked to give back his keys to the bar.\n\nDavid Wright was furious and sought the services of a solicitor because he felt ignored by his family. It emerged at this week's hearing that he had had problems with alcohol in the past and had seen a counsellor in relation to this. His mother suggested he see the counsellor again, Wright jnr claims, and said she would continue to give him money.\n\nWright jnr denied during cross-examination that he had suffered mood swings last July and that he had wanted to get rid of Ms Hunter at that time. Counsel suggested that Wright jnr had never raised alleged problems with Ms Hunter during meetings with her and other family members.\n\nThe Wright family are understood to be deeply embarrassed and upset that such grubby linen is being publicly laundered.\n\nWright jnr represents the fourth generation of a Dublin fish dynasty which has been operating for more than 100 years. It was started in 1890 by one Michael Wright and their main business in Howth still involves the smoking of salmon and preparing other luxury seafood. The family also has restaurants at the Irish Financial Services Centre and in Howth where they also have a bar, the Bloody Stream. Paddy Wright, an executive director of Smurfit, is a brother of Michael and Fianna Fail TD G.V. Wright is a cousin.\n\nThey are a good-looking family with a long and illustrious history of business, wealth and extremely close family links in their stomping ground of north Co Dublin. An unseemly family squabble which resumes in August is most unwelcome."
