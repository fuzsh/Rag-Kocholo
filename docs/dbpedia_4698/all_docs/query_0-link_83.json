KAPP & PETERSON, LTD., DUBLIN IN IRELANi^. PREFACE This First Edition of \" Thorn's Irish Who's Who \" contains life sketches of upwards of 2,500 Irish men and women, at home and overseas, who are conspicuous in the Nation's History, and includes leaders of thought and action in all fields of enlightenment and civiUzation. Neither labour nor expense has been spared in an effort to make the book as authoritative as possible, but no claim is made to completeness. The difficulties that confront the Editor of a volume of this description are much greater than may appear to a casual observer. In the first place there is always present the desire to avoid invidious Belection, and in the second, the danger of omitting, through oversight, names whose absence might naturally occasion surprise. This appHes especially, and for obvious reasons, to a First Edition, and therefore we issue this publication with an apology for errors which are unavoidable, and of whose existence we are unaware. We cordially invite the co- operation of the Irish Public everjrwhere, in enabling us in subsequent editions to correct such errors of omission or commission as we may have unwittingly made. Our aim is to make this Directory complete, and to enable the wayfarer or the scientific inquirer to discover immediately and without inconvenience \" Who's Who \" in the homeland and abroad. When it is borne in mind that the sun never sets on Ireland's sons and daughters, it will be apparent that such co-operation as we invite is vitally important. PREFACE We respectfully present this Volume as a chapter in the contemporary history of the Irish Nation. Most books of reference become obsolete by flux of time. This volume will become enhanced in value as the years pass. Ireland is emerging from the throes of revolution, the ultimate effects of which none can appreciate or forecast. When the historian of the future undertakes to chronicle the stirring events of which the passing generation is witness, we venture to suggest that the names and history of the outstanding personahties of 1922 will be of priceless value. What, for example, would the historian of to-day not give for an \" Irish Who's Who \" relating to the year that marked the passing of the Act of Union ? Our immediate appeal is to the Statesman, the Man of Letters, the Clergj^man, the Artist, the Journalist, the Lawyer, the Scientist, and last, but in many respects first, the Man of Commerce. To these and to the general pubUc we hope the book will prove useful. The Publishers. December^ 1922. ABBREVIATIONS A.A.Q. ... Assistant- Adj ataut- General . b. A.B. Bachelor of Arts.
