        "text": "He announced today that he will not be contesting the local selection convention next week.\n\n“It is, in my view, time for a younger person to take on the role it has been my pleasure to play in politics for a quarter of a century.\n\n“It is also time for me to effect a change in career at a time when I feel capable of taking on new challenges in what will be a considerably different lifestyle.\n\n“Politics, as many of my colleagues have attested, is a tough business which makes tremendous demands on those involved and their families. ”\n\nThe other Government TD in Dublin North, Jim Glennon is expected to seek a nomination along with Cllr Michael Kennedy and Cllr Darragh O’Brien.\n\n“They make a formidable team and are amongst many outstanding public representatives with whom it has been my pleasure to work,” Mr Wright said in a statement.\n\nMr Wright was involved in controversy two years ago after his car was involved in a collision with a pedestrian.\n\nHe was fined €900 and banned from driving for two years for drink driving following the incident on the North Strand in Dublin on September 18, 2003.\n\nHe was on his way home from Leinster House at the time.\n\nPaying tribute, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern said today that the TD will be a loss to the party.\n\n“Deputy Wright was a hard-working, competent and popular public representative whose enthusiasm, experience and good humour will be missed by the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party,” Mr Ahern said from India, where he is on a week-long trade mission.\n\nMr Wright remarked that his Oireachtas career has been exciting and demanding.\n\n“I am happy to have participated in many major changes that have enhanced the lives of those who live in Dublin North. These include inward investment, job creation, the provision of outstanding sporting and recreation facilities as well as improved services for those in need.”\n\nHe said he was proud of the growth of Fingal County Council area and the development of schools, transport and housing infrastructure in the general Dublin North area.\n\nMr Wright was a TD from 1987 to 1989, and from 1997 to date.\n\nHe served as a Senator from 1982 to 1987 and from 1989 to 1997. He was Fianna Fáil’s leader in the Upper House from 1992 to 1997.\n\nHe was a member of Dublin County Council, and later Fingal County Council, from 1985 to 2004.\n\nLobbyist Frank Dunlop claimed at the Mahon Tribunal he made a payment of £7,000 to Mr Wright when he was a member of Dublin County Council.\n\nA former Dublin Gaelic footballer, the avid sports fan was also a former international basketball player and coach.\n\nMr Wright said he was personally proud to have been appointed to government positions by three taoisigh, Charles Haughey, Albert Reynolds and Bertie Ahern.\n\n“I have taken this decision after 25 very enjoyable years in political life at both local and national level and will continue to serve my constituents wholeheartedly for the duration of the current Dáil,” he added.\n\nHe pledged to do everything he could to win two Fianna Fáil seats in Dublin North at the next election.\n\nHe also thanked his wife and children and his voters for their wholehearted support."
