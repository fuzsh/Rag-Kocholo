        "text": "Chanel College is a Catholic boys' secondary school in Coolock, Dublin, Ireland. The principal is Dara Gill. The school has approximately 600 pupils.\n\nHistory\n\nThe school opened in 1955 with 12 pupils in the first year. It was the year after the canonisation of Saint Peter Chanel (one of the early Marists and the first to be canonised) and so the college was named in his honour. The main part of the school was built in the late sixties. Chanel was the third school to be opened by the Marist Fathers in Ireland, coming after CUS in 1867, and St Mary's College, Dundalk in 1861.\n\nSports facilities\n\nIn 2012, Chanel transferred some of its sports fields to the neighbouring Parnells GAA club, which built a new sports complex on the site consisting of several floodlit all-weather pitches, training facilities, and a social centre. Chanel has the use of these facilities.[1] It subsequently sold much of its campus to developers, who have built private housing on the approach to the school.\n\nCommunity involvement\n\nChanel College has been involved in Civic Link since 2001. In the first year, they were linked to St. Joseph's High School, Derry. Subsequently, they were linked to Knockbreda High School, Belfast and Ballycastle High School, County Antrim.[2] They are currently linked with Keithryan High School, County Antrim.\n\nChanel joined the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship programme in 2006.\n\nNotable past pupils\n\nTerence Flanagan (b. 1975) - Dublin City Councillor and former TD for Dublin North East (2007-2016)\n\nPatrick Joseph McGrath (1945-2023) - Bishop of San Jose, California (1999-2009)\n\nAlex White (b. 1958) - politician, former TD for Dublin South\n\nG. V. Wright (b. 1947) - politician, senator and TD\n\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\n\nNotes and References"
