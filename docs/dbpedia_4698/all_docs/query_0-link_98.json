        "text": "Name\n\nThe modern name Malahide may come from \"Mullach Íde\" meaning \"the hill of Íde\" or \"Íde's sand-hill\". It could also mean \"Sand-hills of the Hydes\" (from Mullac h-Íde) probably referring to a Norman family from the Donabate area. According to the Placenames Database of Ireland the name Malahide is possibly derived from the Irish \"Baile Átha Thíd\" meaning \"the town of the ford of Thíd\". Malahide Bay was anciently called Inber Domnann, the \"river-mouth of the Fir Domnann\".\n\nLocation and access\n\nMalahide is situated 16 kilometres north of the city of Dublin, lying between Swords, Kinsealy and Portmarnock. It is situated on the Broadmeadow (Bromwell) estuary, on the opposite side of which is Donabate.\n\nThe village is served by the DART and the train, run by Irish Rail. The Dublin Bus 32, 42 and 102, the 32X and 142 peak hour express services, and 42N Nite-Link route serve the town from Dublin City Centre. Route 102 serves local areas to / from Dublin Airport ( via Swords ) and Sutton Station (via Portmarnock ).\n\nHistory\n\nWhile there are some remnants of prehistoric activity, Malahide is known to have become a persistent settlement from the coming of the Vikings, who landed in 795, and used Malahide Estuary (along with Baldoyle) as a convenient base. With the arrival of the Anglo-Normans, the last Danish King of Dublin retired to the area in 1171. From the 1180s, the history of the area is tied to that of the Talbot family of Malahide Castle, who were granted extensive lands in the area and over the centuries following developed their estate, and the small harbour settlement.\n\nThere is an ancient covered well, St. Sylvester's, on the old main street (Old Street, previously Chapel Street), which used to have a \"pattern\" to Our Lady each 15 August.\n\nIn 1475 Thomas Talbot, head of the Talbot family of Malahide Castle, was granted the title Admiral of the port of Malahide by King Edward IV, with power to hold admiralty courts and levy customs duties on all merchandise coming into the port. The office was hereditary, and the family's right to act as Admiral was confirmed by the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) in 1639.\n\nBy the early 19th century, the village had a population of over 1000, and a number of local industries, including salt harvesting, while the harbour continued in commercial operation, with landings of coal and construction materials. By 1831, the population had reached 1223. The area grew in popularity in Georgian times as a seaside resort for wealthy Dublin city dwellers. This is still evident today from the fine collection of Georgian houses in the town and along the seafront, and Malahide is still a popular spot for day-trippers, especially in the summer months.\n\nIn the 1960s, developers began to build housing estates around the village core of Malahide, launching the first, Ard na Mara in 1964. Further estates followed, to the northwest, south and west, but the village core remained intact, with the addition of a \"marina apartment complex\" development adjacent to the village green.\n\nToday\n\nMalahide grew from a population to 1500 in 1960 and by 2011 had a population of 15,846, and is still a rapidly growing town for the Dublin area. Most of the population lives outside the core village, in residential areas such as Seapark, Biscayne, Robswall, Chalfont, Ard Na Mara, Millview, Yellow Walls Road, Seabury and Gainsborough.\n\nIn Malahide village there are extensive retail facilities and services including fashion boutiques, hair and beauty salons, florists, food outlets, and a small shopping centre. There is a wide selection of pubs (including Gibney's, Fowler's, Duffy's and Gilbert and Wright's) and restaurants and the 203-room Grand Hotel.\n\nPolitics\n\nMalahide is part of the Dáil Éireann constituency of Dublin Fingal, whose five elected representatives are Louise O'Reilly (Dublin politician) of Sinn Féin, elected in 2016; Darragh O'Brien of the Fianna Fáil Party elected in 2016; Brendan Ryan of the Labour Party, elected in 2016; Clare Daly of United Left Alliance, elected in 2016; and Alan Farrell of Fine Gael, elected in 2016. For the 2016 election held on Feb 26th, the Dublin North constituency was replaced by the Dáil Éireann constituency of Dublin Fingal.\n\nPast sitting TDs have included Nora Owen (Fine Gael), Sean Ryan (Labour), and the Fianna Fáil member G.V. Wright.\n\nMalahide forms part of the Howth/Malahide Local Electoral area of Fingal County Council. The current representatives of the eight-seat area are Daire Ní Laoi (Sinn Féin) Eoghan O'Brien (Fianna Fáil) Anthony Lavin (Fine Gael) Brian McDonagh (Labour) Cian O'Callaghan (Social Democrats) David Healy (Green Party) Keith Redmond (Renua) Jimmy Guerin (Independent)\n\nLeisure and organisations\n\nNear to the village itself is Malahide Castle and demesne, including, gardens, which were once the estate of Baron Talbot of Malahide.\n\nMalahide also has a substantial marina.\n\nThe Malahide area has more than twenty residents' associations, sixteen of which (May 2007) work together through the Malahide Community Forum, which publishes a quarterly newsletter, The Malahide Guardian.\n\nThere is an active historical society (with a small museum at Malahide Castle Demesne), a Lions club, a camera club, a musical and drama society, the renowned Enchiriadis choirs, a chess club and a photography group which has published calendars.\n\nAside from Malahide Castle Demesne, there are a number of smaller parks (with further spaces planned, for example, at Robswall and Seamount). There are several golf courses nearby, and GAA, soccer, tennis, rugby, yacht clubs and Sea Scouts.\n\nIn 1990, Malahide won the Irish Tidy Towns Competition.\n\nAnother group that has been present in Malahide for many years is the Malahide Pipe Band. The band was established in 1954 and still practices in the same original area in Yellow Walls today. The band comprises pipers and drummers playing the bagpipes and snare, tenor and bass drums. The band plays at various events locally, with main objective to play in competitions around the country in the summer months. The Band has also been involved in running a Pipe Band Competition in Malahide Castle for a number of years. The Band is always looking for new members and supporters. For more details go to the Malahide Pipe Band's website.\n\nSport\n\nThere are also a wide variety of sports clubs within the Malahide area.

Both the men's and women's premier teams compete (in their respective leagues) at the highest grade of cricket played in Ireland. From 2009–12 the club's ground was developed into an 11,500-capacity venue and hosted its first one-day international in September 2013 when Ireland played England, with England winning by six wickets after captain Eoin Morgan hit 124 not out on what had been his home ground in his youth. The ground is now the biggest in Ireland. This project has also seen the development of a 2nd \"club\" pitch on the nearby Lady Acre within Malahide Demesne.\n\nSoccer\n\nMalahide United AFC ([2]) was founded in 1944 and currently fields 60 schoolboy/girl teams, from Under 7 to Under 18, and 4 senior teams.

It is now one of the northern termini of the DART system, (the other being Howth). The station features a heritage garden and an attractive ironwork canopy. The ironwork in the canopy contains the monogram of the Great Northern Railway ('GNR'), who operated the route prior to nationalisation of the railways.\n\nThe railway crosses the Broadmeadow (Bromwell) estuary on a Broadmeadow (Bromwell) viaduct known locally as The Arches. The original viaduct was a wooden structure built in 1844, which was replaced with an iron structure in 1860 and a pre-cast structure in 1966-7.\n\nViaduct collapse\n\nOn 21 August 2009 the 18:07 train from Balbriggan to Connolly was passing over the 200-year-old viaduct when the driver noticed a subsidence and the embankment giving way on the northbound track. The train passed over the bridge before it collapsed and the driver alerted authorities.\n\nAn inquiry is investigating the possibility that sea bed erosion is the primary cause of the collapse.\n\nA member of Malahide Sea Scouts, Ivan Barrett, had contacted Iarnród Éireann five days before the collapse about possible damage to the viaduct and a change in water flow around it.\n\nBuses\n\nDublin Bus provides local bus routes in the area on Routes 32, 32X, 42, 42N, 102 and 142.\n\nRoute 32 connects Malahide with Portmarnock, Baldoyle, Howth Road, Raheny, Killester, Clontarf West, Fairview, Connolly Railway Station and terminates at Abbey Street.\n\nRoute 32X connects Seabury, Malahide, Portmarnock, Baldoyle, Clontarf Road, Fairview, Connolly Railway Station, Saint Stephen's Green, Leeson Street, Donnybrook Village, RTÉ and terminates at UCD Belfield.\n\nRoute 42 connects The Hill, Malahide Village, Seabury, Kinsealy, Clare Hall, Coolock, Malahide Road, Artane Roundabout, Donnycarney Church, Fairview, Connolly Railway Station and terminates at Eden Quay.\n\nRoute 42N is Friday and Saturday only Route which serves Kinsealy, Seabury, Malahide Village, Portmarnock (Coast Road), Wendell Avenue, Carrickhill Road, Stand Road and Portmarnock.\n\nRoute 102 serves Malahide Village en route to Seabury, Waterside, Mountgorry Way, Pavilions Shopping Centre, Swords Main Street, Boriomhe, River Valley and terminates at Dublin Airport.
