        "text": "By John Manning,\n\nStaff Reporter\n\nWHILE the legacy of Charles J. Haughey was being debated on the national airwaves, his political associates, friends and neighbours in Malahide and Kinsealy remembered a man they knew personally as generous, witty and fiercely intelligent.\n\nMalahide TD GV Wright was not only a political associate but a close personal friend of Mr Haughey and remembers him as a man of ‘great intellect, wit, warmth and vision’.\n\nHe told the Fingal Independent: ‘Personally I wouldn’t have had a political career without Charles J. Haughey. He brought me into politics and supported me through all the good as well as the difficult times. He was a loyal and true friend and supporter.’\n\nHe added: ‘He will be truly and sadly missed. I was with him very recently and though clearly a man whose life was fading, he had lost none of his intellectual powers – he faced his death with courage.’\n\nPaddy McCormack is a well-known figure in Fingal’s gun-hunting circles and was one of a small group of close friends of the former Taoiseach that visited the Abbeville estate for a weekly chat that was always free of politics.\n\nThe weekly chats must have come as sweet relief from the pressure of political life for Mr Haughey who sat with the local men and talked about his interests in hunting, nature and rural life.\n\nPaddy saw Mr Haughey as recently as Saturday, just three days before the former Taoiseach’s passing.\n\nMr McCormack told the Fingal Independent: ‘I saw him last Saturday. He was in good form but he was a great man to keep up a good face on things. I know with the drugs he was on that he was in no pain – I didn’t expect him to go so quickly.’\n\nPaddy trained Mr Haughey’s beloved gun-dog, ‘Inis’ and also had a role in managing the game population on the Abbeville estate and when the walls of Abbeville reverberated with the sounds of traditional music, as they often did, Paddy was there with his accordion.\n\n‘We had some great sessions up there and recitations. He loved all that kind of thing,’ Paddy told the Fingal Independent.\n\nRemembering his friend, he said: ‘He was the kind of man you would love to be with and great company and without mentioning politics at all, he had great insights into nature and country life.’\n\nPat McNamara, former President of Swords Fingal Chamber of Commerce lives in Malahide and is a personal friend of the Haughey family and part of what he described as a ‘close knit group of friends’ that include Mr Haughey’s sons.\n\nMr McNamara had seen Charles J. Haughey on almost a weekly basis in recent years and found the former Taoiseach to be: ‘Intelligent and entertaining – he could talk about any subject under the sun.’\n\nSaddened by Mr Haughey’s final defeat by illness, Mr McNamara said that the former Taoiseach had become frail but had an extraordinary capacity to ‘bounce back’ from illness.\n\nMr McNamara had seen the former Taoiseach as recently as last Sunday week and on that occasion, Mr Haughey was ‘frail but up and about through his sheer determination and his mind was 110 per cent alert’.\n\n‘He was a fatherly figure and I will personally miss him very much,’ Mr McNamara said.\n\nEric Crampton is a well-known community figure in Malahide and such was his regard for Mr Haughey and his family, he interrupted a holiday to Canada to give his reaction to the sad news.\n\nMr Crampton said that Charles J Haughey and the entire Haughey family had made an extraordinary contribution to the communities of North Dublin, Fingal and Malahide.\n\n‘Probably next to my own father and father-in-law, he was the greatest Irishman I ever met and history will judge him finally as one of the great statesmen,’ Mr Crampton said.\n\nHe continued: ‘Over 35 years of community work in Malahide, I found the Haughey family were always the first ones to support anything that was going on.’\n\nLike all of those who offered their reaction to the death of Mr Haughey, Mr Crampton’s thoughts were with the Haughey family and especially, Maureen Haughey who Mr Crampton has seen almost every morning for many years, as she took her morning constitutional through the village.\n\nFormer Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey died at his Kinsealy home after a long battle with cancer on Tuesday morning.\n\nHe was surrounded by his family and is survived by his wife Maureen, and children Eimear, Ciarán, Conor and Seán.\n\nSee more pages 2, 3 & 5"
