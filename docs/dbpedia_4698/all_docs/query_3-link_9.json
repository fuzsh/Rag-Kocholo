        "text": "Housing Minister Darragh O’Brien was moulded by the Fianna Fáil old guard, but after a bruising few days, his long-held ambition to one day lead the party may be stalling. He might have hoped to be the Minister to solve the housing crisis, but record rents, Celtic Tiger-era property prices and a failure to hit supply targets mean the voters are as dissatisfied as ever.\n\nIt has been a tumultuous week for Mr O’Brien. While he was in Helsinki,\n\nFinland, for the Housing Europe Conference, the domestic housing crisis he presides over was upgraded to ‘disaster’ status by the President, Michael D Higgins.\n\nA day later, on Wednesday evening, Mr O’Brien was accused in the Dáil of a political ‘stroke’ after introducing a last-minute amendment to the Electoral Reform Bill to allow political parties obtain lottery licences for political fundraising.\n\nPolitical fundraising is a delicate issue for the Malahide man. The region where he grew up was once synonymous with planning corruption and property developers holding influence over politicians.\n\nIt would become the epicentre of corrupt land dealings examined by the Mahon\n\nTribunal, which was established in 1997 and delivered its final report in 2012.\n\nMr O’Brien’s political mentor and friend, the former Fianna Fáil councillor and TD for Dublin North GV Wright, was one of three people found by the tribunal to have received corrupt payments.\n\nMr Wright took Mr O’Brien under his wing as his political protégé and their friendship has endured to this day.\n\nSome of the biggest property developers in the country live in Mr O’Brien’s Dublin Fingal constituency, and some of them gave donations to the-then young first-time TD. Other donations came from prominent local businesspeople.\n\nPolitical donations are typically intended to cover the cost of election campaigns.\n\nAn analysis of Mr O’Brien’s donations for 2007 and 2008 shows that €13,790 (33.5%) came from those in property and construction.\n\nHowever, almost 70% (€9,585) of Mr O’Brien’s donations from construction and property interests came the year after he was elected, in 2008.\n\nIn 2008 Gannon Homes wrote a cheque for €1,065 to Mr O’Brien, which was declared. The company is owned by Gerry Gannon, one of 10 ‘Golden Circle’ investors approached by Anglo Irish Bank to buy shares in the bank in 2008.\n\nThe group, which bought shares in the bank using loans from Anglo as part of an illegal scheme to reduce businessman Seán Quinn’s 25% stake in the bank, were dubbed the Maple 10.\n\nThe bank was ultimately nationalised in 2009.\n\nGannon Homes remains active in construction and recently completed a housing development at Belcamp in Malahide.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Mr Gannon’s firm succeeded in having large chunks of land in North Dublin rezoned. Mr Gannon built large housing and apartment developments in the north county, including around Malahide Marina in the early 1990s.\n\nIn July 1993 the council approved the rezoning of a green belt in the area for a Gannon Homes development after a motion for rezoning was tabled by GV Wright and his fellow Fianna Fáil councillor, Michael Kennedy.\n\nThe Oireachtas register of interests for 2007 and 2008 show that Mr O’Brien received among the highest amounts of political donations. In 2007 he received the fourth-highest amount (€22,310) of declared donations of any TD, and the fifth-highest in 2008 (€18,736).\n\nOther donors to Mr O’Brien included Newpark Holdings, owned by property developer brothers Thomas and Joe Flood. It donated €1,065 in 2008, which was also declared.\n\nIn 2003 Newpark Holdings made a €500,000 settlement with Revenue after a fake invoice tax fraud. There is no suggestion Mr O’Brien was aware of the wrongdoing when he accepted the donation.\n\nAnother donor to Mr O’Brien at the start of his national political career was Albany Homes, which donated €1,065 in 2008. The company is owned by David Daly, who is from Malahide in Mr O’Brien’s constituency.\n\nThe largest payment from a single building firm came from Flynn & O’Flaherty which made a combined donation of €3,065, in the two years examined.\n\nThe company is owned by James Flynn and Noel O’Flaherty. Filings with the Companies Registration Office show that Mr O’Flaherty lives in Mr O’Brien’s constituency.\n\nIn 2007, Tulca Developments wrote a cheque for €1,000 to Mr O’Brien. The company, since renamed Erigo Construction, is owned jointly by Laurence Flood and Joseph Flood. Its registered address is in north county Dublin.\n\nIn 2007, Thomas Smyth and Sons Co Ltd wrote a cheque for €2,500 to Mr O’Brien, the maximum permitted in a single year.\n\nThe company owned Smyths Cock Tavern in Swords as well as Smyths pub in Malahide. In court in 2005 the co-owner, Noel Smyth, was told by a judge that he was not fit to be a publican and was accused of engaging in ‘child exploitation’.\n\nThe business was fined €66,500 over 35 breaches of legislation governing the hours worked by minors. In one case, a 15-year-old girl worked until 1.30am, five-and-a-half hours after she should have finished. The company is no longer trading.\n\nRules for political fundraising were tightened in 2009, with the maximum allowable donation to a candidate falling from €2,539 to €1,000 in a single year. The level of donations having to be declared also fell from €634 to €500.\n\nThe list of donations also includes lesser-known building contractors and estate agents.\n\nIn March 2007, Darragh O’Brien recognised that delivering housing and helping young people onto the property ladder were central to electoral success.\n\nAt the Fianna Fáil ard fheis in the RDS, the then county councillor for Fingal made a speech praising his party’s intervention in the housing market by supporting first-time buyers.\n\nBeaming with confidence on the podium, he could not have imagined that, more than a decade later, he would be tasked with fixing a housing crisis fuelled by his party’s repeated failures.\n\nIt is not surprising that Mr O’Brien is sensitive to opposition claims that his policies are too ‘developer-led’, as he fears being linked to a past he is undoubtedly keen to distance himself from.\n\nIn the RDS in 2007 ard fheis, Mr O’Brien praised the then finance minister, Brian Cowen, for ‘giving direct assistance to first-time buyers by doubling the ceiling on mortgage interest relief’.\n\nMr O’Brien told the ard fheis that night that he was a recent first-time buyer and that he knew ‘how difficult it can be to buy your first home’.\n\nLand registry records show Mr O’Brien bought a home in Malahide, with a mortgage of €321,600, in March 2005. The records show he sold the property in May 2015.\n\nLand registry records also show that Mr O’Brien and his wife Susan Maxwell registered the purchase of a separate home in Malahide around two months after this speech. The couple still live in the same home with their daughter.\n\nParts of Mr O’Brien’s speech to the ard fheis 14 years ago could easily be reused today.\n\n‘All of us here have family and friends who are living at home with parents or who are renting apartments and houses. The vast majority of people want to own their own homes and set down roots,’ he said.\n\nMr O’Brien praised the work of Fianna Fáil – the self-styled ‘party of home ownership’ — in housing delivery and insisted supports to first-time buyers must be continued.\n\n‘This government has assisted dramatically in increasing the supply of new homes. We must continue to help first-time buyers get onto the property ladder and reduce the expense for people who have bought in the last few years.’\n\nHe also pleaded for more measures to help would-be home buyers, saying ‘further changes to stamp duty need to be made. We must be careful that any amendments do not fuel house price inflation…’\n\nMr O’Brien had quit his job with Friends First/New Ireland to focus on his political aspirations. Less than a month later, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern called a general election and Mr O’Brien became a TD a month after that, in May 2007, taking the third and final seat in Dublin North at the age of 32.\n\nThe ard fheis was an important night for Mr O’Brien, who was keen to present himself as a national figure internally.\n\nDespite being involved from a young age in Ógra Fianna Fail, the party’s youth wing, he rarely participated nationally, opting to strengthen his standing locally instead.\n\nMr O’Brien was elected into a party that had been in power since 1997. The Celtic Tiger was still roaring and, at the ard fheis that night, Mr Ahern told his colleagues that ‘we live in a time of unprecedented prosperity’.\n\nThere was no point in resting on past glory, Mr Ahern said. Instead the focus would be on the ‘next steps’ to make the country ‘stronger, fairer, greener, and even more prosperous’.\n\nMr Ahern promised a 2% cut in tax, a halving of the PRSI rate, a huge Garda recruitment drive, more teachers, and increases in benefits and welfare.\n\nTwo months later, the party was returned to power on the back of those promises, with the support of the Green Party, the Progressive Democrats and a handful of Independents.\n\nSixteen months later, the country would be engulfed in a financial crisis caused by an overinflated housing market funded by reckless loans and driven by successive Fianna Fáil governments.\n\nMr O’Brien’s association with Fianna Fáil dates back to his involvement in a local residents’ association in Malahide, so ‘politics was a natural fit’, according to Graham Hanlon.\n\nMr Hanlon, who ran unsuccessfully for the party in the 1999 local elections and now runs his own legal firm, describes Mr O’Brien as ‘very affable and very endearing’.\n\nMr Hanlon was one of Mr O’Brien’s closest friends among the emerging Fianna Fáil clique at the time, when he was in his early 20s.\n\n‘He always did have a genuine passion for serving the public need… Politics would be a natural draw for him. He would have been politically astute for a young man,’ Mr Hanlon said.\n\nThe young group were brought together by GV Wright.\n\nThey met to ‘look at legislation on a Saturday morning’, according to Mr Hanlon, and to help with Fianna Fáil electoral campaigns.\n\n‘I think Darragh and GV [Wright] had a very good, strong, personal relationship. There is no doubt about that, and GV would have gladly given advice to Darragh when he started off on his political career locally and then the Dáil,’ says Mr Hanlon.\n\nHe draws similarities between Mr O’Brien and Mr Wright in their ability to put people at ease and socialise comfortably among any political or social class.\n\nMr Wright held the role of both councillor and TD, but in 2003, legislation was introduced to ban the dual mandate after the local elections the following year.\n\nMr Wright stood down before the election and Mr O’Brien was co-opted into his mentor’s vacant council seat in 2004, months before the local elections, at the age of 29.\n\nA report in the Fingal Independent quotes Councillor Michael Kennedy as saying: ‘I’m sure Darragh will continue the quality of service of his predecessor.’\n\nA few months before vacating his council seat, Mr Wright was fined and banned from driving for two years when, while drunk driving on his way home from the Dáil, he knocked down a nurse who was walking on the pavement.\n\nIn 2007, after Mr Wright stepped aside from national politics, again his young protégé was put forward, with the backing of his mentor’s loyal support base, to contest the seat.\n\nIn March 2012, following the publication of the Mahon Tribunal report, Mr Wright resigned from Fianna Fáil rather than face expulsion.\n\nDespite his exile from the party, the relationship between Mr Wright and Mr O’Brien has endured. The pair are regularly seen drinking together, at least before the pandemic, at St Sylvester’s GAA clubhouse in Malahide.\n\nMr Hanlon doesn’t believe Mr O’Brien’s enduring friendship with Mr Wright will damage him in the eyes of the public.\n\n‘I actually don’t think so. I think people tend to judge politicians now for what they represent, who they are and what they do,’ he said.\n\nMr Wright was previously the vice-president of Malahide Cricket Club. The political significance of the club was passed onto his understudy. However, despite his association, Mr O’Brien never played much cricket.\n\n‘He wasn’t much of a cricketer. He didn’t play very much for too long. Nowadays he might show up on the day of an international or for a photo op but that would be it. He wouldn’t be in the clubhouse regularly having a drink or anything like that,’ one member of the cricket club said.\n\nIndependents for Change MEP Clare Daly spent several years on Fingal County Council with Mr O’Brien.\n\nShe uses terms to describe him such as ‘charming chancer’ and ‘wheeler dealer’, echoing the ‘Del Boy’ nickname that he has recently acquired.\n\n‘That’s the way he was politically brought up. He’s cute… He plays the likeable rogue.\n\n‘I’ve always found him likeable. That doesn’t mean I agree with his politics or think his politics hasn’t caused damage, but I can divorce that sort of behaviour and he can be charming and likeable. He’s very cute,’ Ms Daly said.\n\n‘He won’t do you a bad turn unless he has to. I’ve never seen him to go particularly out of his way to shaft people. He’ll do you a good turn if he can, but he wouldn’t be shy about pursuing his own interests in a different way,’ she said.\n\nThere are different sides to the 47-year-old Malahide native’s personality. There is the ‘very affable’, ‘likeable rogue’ who enjoys a pint of Guinness and a singsong, when he is known to favour a rendition of ‘Grace’.\n\nHe is a frequent socialiser and occasional smoker who has been trying to give up for as long as some of his friends have known him.\n\nThere is also the politically ruthless operator who is preparing to stake a claim for the ultimate political prize — the Taoiseach’s office.\n\nHis strategy of focusing on his local area as a young politician, without being too concerned about building his reputation nationally within the party, has paid off.\n\nNow he has what one party veteran describes as a ‘first class’ constituency operation that is potentially one of the best in the country, ‘but certainly the best in Fianna Fáil‘.\n\n‘He has all his councillors totally united with him, which is a hell of an achievement, especially for anybody with a high profile. He has also managed it from his own perspective extremely well — maybe not from the party perspective,’ the party elder said.\n\nMr O’Brien’s parents, Joan and Padraig, are both retired, but have been very supportive of their son’s political career. Padraig, a talented amateur painter whose works often hung in a local Café Provence, was also active locally in various community groups.\n\nAt the last local elections, only one Fianna Fáil candidate was put for-­ward to run in the Howth/Malahide ward, the Minister’s brother, Eoghan O’Brien.\n\nThe younger O’Brien, described as his brother’s ‘eyes and ears on the council’, topped the poll with almost a quota-and-a-half.\n\nThere was some internal disquiet over the failure to run a second candidate.\n\n‘I would think at this stage, for him to fulfil his ambition as party leader he has to deliver a second seat,’ the source said.\n\nAccording to one veteran of the party, Mr O’Brien knows ‘when to smile and when to swing the knife, and sometimes when to do both at the same time’.\n\nHe is described as coming from the ‘old Haughey school of hard-­nosed politics’.\n\nGV Wright was a close social friend of Brian Cowen, and Darragh O’Brien also often socialised with the then Taoiseach.\n\nAt the infamous party think-­in at the Ardilaun Hotel in Galway, Mr O’Brien was part of the group drinking with Mr Cowen in the hours before his infamous ‘gargle gate’ appearance on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland.\n\nMr O’Brien’s seat at the high stool was granted by virtue of his close association with GV Wright.\n\nIn the 2011 election, Mr O’Brien lost his Dáil seat. However, he spent just five days in political exile before outgoing Taoiseach Mr Cowen nominated him to the Seanad as a replacement for Ciarán Cannon, who was elected to the Dáil.\n\nMr O’Brien was then elected in the Seanad elections a month later. In 2016 he was again elected to the Dáil and became Fianna Fáil’s spokes­man on housing.\n\nIn 2019 he failed in a pitch to write a co-­authored book with his now main policy adviser, Kevin Dillon, a former adviser to Micheál Martin.\n\nHis pitch for Home Truths was rejected by publishers just after Sinn Féin’s housing spokesman, Eoin Ó Broin, published his policy book on housing, called Home.\n\nTaoiseach Micheál Martin said he appointed his Cabinet based on experience, ensuring that Ministers would hit the ground running in their portfolios.\n\nHowever, it would take Mr O’Brien 14 months to publish his Housing For All policy document setting out the Government’s plan to tackle the housing crisis.\n\nTo Mr O’Brien’s critics, his speech at the ard fheis in 2007 might shed light on why he seems wedded to the policies he has championed.\n\nThe Help To Buy scheme, introduced in 2017 and maintained in Budget 2022, allows for a tax rebate of up to €30,000.\n\nInitially, the scheme was limited to a tax refund of €20,000, or 5% of the property’s value, prior to the pan-­demic July stimulus package.\n\nConcerns have been raised by the Parliamentary Budget Office, which found that 41% of claimants by August 2019 already had at least a 10% deposit saved and were not in need of the scheme, which was intended to help first-­time buyers get their deposit.\n\nSeparately, the International Monetary Fund has warned the Government about the wisdom of running a scheme that interferes in the housing market but that discriminates in favour of first-­time buyers.\n\nThe Shared Equity Scheme is not yet in operation, but it will see the State take a stake of up to 20% in a home to bridge the affordability gap for those who may earn too much to be eligible for social housing but not enough to pay the full current mar­ket price themselves.\n\nThe State’s stake is paid off at low interest over a period of up to 20 years. However, the ESRI and the Central Bank have both advised against it, describing it as inflationary.\n\nInternal Department of Housing records obtained by this newspaper show that the target of building more than 33,000 homes a year will not be achieved until the Govern­ment’s last year in office. The influx of Ukrainian refugees fleeing the war has made the challenges in housing even more acute."
