        "text": "The participation of women in Irish nationalist movements in the nineteenth century is an important, if still largely unexplored, arena for research in gender studies. Allied to it is the question of the extent to which a feminist agenda can be detected in the ideologies of Irish nationalism throughout the nineteenth century. This article will examine the participation of women in the movement in the 1840s which, after the example of such continental movements as &#39;Young Italy&#39;, came to be called &#39;Young Ireland&#39;a label first affixed to it derisively by its enemies, but later taken up proudly by its members.&#39; This article will examine prose pieces and some poems written by women, together with the responses to them by men, in theYoung Ireland newspaper the Nation, published between 1843 and the paper&#39;s suppression in July 1848, as well as female contributions, published between February and May 1848, to John Mitchel&#39;s more militant paper, the United Irishma...\n\nAbstract The symbolic role of women in Irish nationalism has to some extent obscured their practical involvements. By studying some of the most prominent female nationalists, this paper shows how women often read representations of women as icons of nationhood very much against the grain of the passive interpretations favoured by later historians. The paper also shows how heavily contested was the ultimate exclusion of women from public and political spaces.\n\nIn the thirty years since the publication of ‘An agenda for women&#39;s history in Ireland’, the study of women&#39;s and gender history has been transformed. The introduction to this special issue contextualises the ‘Agenda’ within this evolving landscape, underlining the significant role it played in stimulating scholarship by outlining some of the major developments in the field since 1992. The introduction also points to developments that the authors, Margaret MacCurtain, Mary O&#39;Dowd and Maria Luddy, could not have foreseen when writing the ‘Agenda’, such as rapid technological advances and the possibilities they have opened up for scholars of women and gender in Irish history. By tracing these developments, the introduction serves as a gateway into the articles that form the special issue: contributions that demonstrate the wide-reaching and multifaceted impact of the ‘Agenda’ and the three pioneering scholars who authored it, and that provide thought-provoking analysis of ..."
