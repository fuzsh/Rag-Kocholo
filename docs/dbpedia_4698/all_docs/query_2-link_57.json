I remember spinning up in the air. I came down off the bonnet and then on to the concrete.\"\n\nThe TD, from Malahide, who arrived in court dressed in a navy suit shortly after 10am, was named as Thomas Wright.\n\nGarda Fergal Flynn gave evidence of arresting the TD when gardai were called to a road accident at North Strand Road on September 18.\n\nHe said there was a strong smell of alcohol when he spoke to Wright who admitted driving under the influence.\n\nThe deputy was arrested and taken to Store Street Garda station where his blood alcohol limit was registered at 67mg per 100mg.\n\nThe court heard Wright is a married father-of-three with no previous convictions.\n\nJudge Scally said the reading was \"very high\" and imposed the fine, disqualification and licence endorsement.\n\nAs he walked from court afterwards, Wright refused to answer questions on whether he would resign from his seat.\n\nCAPTION(S):\n\nCOURT: GV Wright yesterday"
