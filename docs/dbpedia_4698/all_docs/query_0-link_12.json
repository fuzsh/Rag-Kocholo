        "text": "THEIR name bears that of a town in Munster, and they are referred to as a Tipperary school; yet their premises is located over the border in Offaly and they play their rugby in Leinster.\n\nFianna Fáil face tough road of rebuilding ahead for the party, according to a former TD Jim Glennon, who described the election as \"Armageddon\".\n\nSPARE a thought for a candidate who gets up a 6am six days a week to drive 310km to and from work who then has to trudge out into the night to knock on doors.\n\nFormer Fianna Fáil TD Jim Glennon has hit out at last night's debate, branding it \"an exercise in showbusiness\".\n\nAS the election campaign nears the end of a second week, it offers an opportunity to step back for a moment and reflect on matters more general.\n\nMichael Moynihan talks to Senator Joe O’Toole, a member of the GAA’s Management Committee and a director of the Croke Park stadium.\n\nAll the major political parties are tonight limbering up for the kick-off of the General Election campaign – on a soccer pitch.\n\nFORMER Dublin GAA captain and All-Star winner, John O’Leary, is to run as a Fianna Fáil candidate in Dublin North in next year’s General Election.\n\nFormer Dublin Gaelic Football captain John O'Leary is to run for Fianna Fáil in the Dublin North constituency at the next general election.\n\nFIANNA FÁIL had cause for further celebration yesterday, as a second opinion poll confirmed that public support for the party has increased, despite the controversy over payments to Taoiseach Bertie Ahern.\n\nIF Bertie Ahern had been drawn to the boxing ring, as opposed to the soccer pitch, he’d have hugged the other boxer to death. There’s nothing like a committed clinch for pinning an opponent’s arms to his side and preventing him from thumping you.\n\nTaoiseach Bertie Ahern was today urged to listen to his Fianna Fáil backbenchers in the run up to the next General Election after it emerged they were forming a committee designed to have their concerns taken on board.\n\nA group of Fianna Fáil backbenchers is reportedly forming a new committee in an effort to get their opinions heard ahead of the next general election.\n\nTHERE was a widespread welcome last night for a decision to hold public Oireachtas hearings into the Government’s controversial proposal to privatise Aer Lingus.\n\nThe is no political will within the Government to tackle alcoholism, a Fianna Fáil backbencher claimed tonight.\n\nSEAN HAUGHEY turned up for almost twice as many votes in the last Dáil session as newly appointed junior minister Mary Wallace.\n\nTAOISEACH Bertie Ahern provoked anger in Fianna Fáil ranks last night with a reshuffle upset that saw a rebel deputy promoted as Sean Haughey was again overlooked.\n\nA successor to former Junior Transport Minister Ivor Callely will probably be announced next week, it emerged tonight.\n\nWITH the Cabinet expected to appoint a new Minister of State at the Department of Transport this week, Sean Haughey has firmly thrown his hat into the ring by saying the post would be the next logical step in his career.\n\nFianna Fáil will continue its preparations for the next General Election tonight, as it holds two selection conventions in Dublin and Cork.\n\nGovernment TD GV Wright is to retire from politics at the next General Election to pursue other interests and make way for a younger successor, it emerged today.\n\nTHIS evening Dáil Eireann rises for the Christmas recess, so it is time to announce the fourth annual Tallyman’s awards - my entirely subjective political prizes for ‘05.\n\nA SMALL number of senior Fianna Fáil backbench TDs have been installed as the early favourites to fill the junior ministry left vacant by Ivor Callely’s resignation yesterday.\n\nThe Government was in bullish mood tonight despite the Ivor Callely controversy casting an ugly shadow over its biggest-ever give-away Budget.\n\nThe Taoiseach may not fill Ivor Callely’s job until the New Year and it is likely to go to for a North Dublin backbencher, it emerged today.\n\nFianna Fáil TD Jim Glennon has called for the sacking of Aer Lingus managers responsible for drawing up the controversial memo leaked earlier this month.\n\nFormer Labour Party vice-chairman Henry Haughton this afternoon called on Fianna Fáil's Dublin North TD Jim Glennon to state whether he is in favour of Aer Lingus privatisation."
