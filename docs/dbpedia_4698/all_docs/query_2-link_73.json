        "text": "British Soldiers died in Ireland 1919-21\n\nI suspect that the list of deaths will never be completed. Certainly the British did their best to keep reported casualties down to just KIA. The accidental deaths and suicides were not officially reported but can be got from following up on local press reports and cross checking with Irish GRO records and CWGC records.\n\nAs well as the known dead, a number are \"Missing, Fate Unknown\". The British walked away from most of the missing, writing them off as \"deserters\". I have found it difficult to determine who deserted and got away and who was killed by the IRA and buried in an unmarked grave. I can name 42 men missing and bodies not found, plus another 18 who were exhumed and re-buried. But even many of the exhumations were not reported in either the Irish nor the British press.\n\nThere are also all the Auxiliary Deaths 52, of which 6 were accidents. The Auxiliary deployment was equal to about two battalions, so their mortality was considerably higher than an Infantry Battalion\n\nI have only included soldiers who were still serving at the time of their death\n\nI have attempted to categorise the deaths as follows. The figures need to be reworked as I have added many more deaths in Ireland\n\nkilled in action - 180 before the truce and another 17 after the truce. On 21 November 1921 the British army held a memorial service for its dead, of all ranks, of which it counted 162 up to the 1921 Truce and 18 killed afterwards. To an extent it depends how you define KIA in Ireland\n\nkilled accidentally by firearms - 106 deaths\n\nsuicide - 46 deaths\n\nmurdered by another soldier - 4 deaths\n\naccidental deaths - 78 deaths from non-firearm related accidents\n\nSpanish Flu - 176 deaths\n\nOther natural causes - 223 deaths.\n\nI have not attempted a full list of Police Killed. Others have details of those. Nor Civilians. The two links below are just men whose deaths I have researched as part of incidents that I investigated.\n\nPolice Killed\n\nCivilians Killed by IRA as spies\n\nI have not finished the 5 analysis below, but the numbers are available from the main list below\n\nSoldiers killed by regiment\n\nIntelligence\n\nSuicides\n\nExhumed or Missing\n\nDeserters\n\nKilled in Action\n\nMy main work here is a record of all British soldiers who died in Ireland from 1919 to withdrawal and the reasons for their deaths. The following list that contains 822 names\n\nNote the CWGC reindexed their web site after I had completed this list. It was not worth re-doing the links to the new CWGC ones, as my purpose was to ascertain who was commemorated and who was not."
