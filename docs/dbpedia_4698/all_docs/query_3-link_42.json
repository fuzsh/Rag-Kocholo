        "text": "🚀 Breaking the 7-Figure Barrier: A Journey of Growth with Discounters.pk 🚀 Dear LinkedIn community, I'm thrilled to share the incredible journey of Discounters.pk, where we went from a solid 7-figure revenue to soaring into the realm of 8 figures. This transformation wasn't an overnight success but a testament to the power of perseverance, continuous learning, and strategic risk-taking. Background: For two years, Discounters.pk found itself plateaued at the 7-figure mark. Despite the initial success, progress stagnated. It was during this time that I realized the importance of embracing challenges, learning from setbacks, and utilizing every opportunity for improvement. Key Learnings: Risk Analysis Expertise: Understanding and mitigating risks became a cornerstone. My deep dive into risk analysis allowed me to make informed decisions, turning potential setbacks into opportunities. Team as Friends: A business is only as strong as its team. Fostering a culture where the team feels like a family was pivotal. Trust and camaraderie became the fuel for our collective success. Consistent Hard Work: There's no substitute for hard work. Consistency in our efforts, day in and day out was the driving force. This work ethic instilled resilience and determination within the team. Continuous Improvement: A commitment to constant improvement fueled innovation. We embraced change, welcomed feedback, and evolved our strategies and processes regularly. Turning Point: The breakthrough came when I decided to take calculated risks that I had been avoiding for the past two years. This shift in mindset was crucial. It wasn't about avoiding risks anymore; it was about managing them strategically to propel the business forward. The Mindset Shift: The mindset shift was the linchpin of our success. It involved embracing challenges as opportunities, viewing risks as stepping stones, and understanding that growth often lies just beyond the comfort zone. For Those Seeking Details: If you're eager to dive deeper into the specifics of this case study, I'd be more than happy to share the intricate details of the strategies implemented, the risks taken, and the mindset cultivated. Drop a comment below, and let's connect! \"A Heartfelt Thank You to Saad Khan, Zain Khan, Asad Ahmed, and other team members\"\n\n🚀 Breaking the 7-Figure Barrier: A Journey of Growth with Discounters.pk 🚀 Dear LinkedIn community, I'm thrilled to share the incredible journey of Discounters.pk, where we went from a solid 7-figure revenue to soaring into the realm of 8 figures.

Now, I debated this post for 2 days because I didn't want to be \"that guy\" on LinkedIn who comes off as bragging. However, I felt the good that could come from the context may outweigh any fear or doubt I have. Let me set the stage. I spent my whole career as an entrepreneur, and only started trying to break into corporate sales in 2021. It was my first W2 job since High School. I struggled to find footing in tech sales because I didn't have the fancy background and corporate experience. After a layoff in November, Chris Ray and I started with an idea for a side hustle. We put our head down and went for it, and here we are. Not a side hustle anymore. I tell you this story to encourage you. If you're trying to break into tech sales from a non-traditional background, don't stop. You CAN do it. If you're laid off and thinking about a side hustle, go for it. Who knows what is in the cards for you. You CAN do it. You can accomplish anything you want to if you are willing to work hard. If a redneck from Alabama with a very non-traditional background and a corporate sales pro who's never started a business can build Revenue Rocket, you can create your own path too. Whatever path it may be.\n\nI'm excited to say that the green banner is coming down, at least for now! When I parted ways with my last company, I had a personal mission: First and foremost, I needed to rest and recharge, and to do it THOROUGHLY. Then the goal was to start paving a path towards a life where I could have flexibility and enough work/life balance that I could move my passions along while crushing my work while on the clock, plus bonus points if I could do it all while keeping my sales expertise sharp. So what's happening? - I landed a badass sales contract ✓ - I started a business ✓ The contract: today I started working with CrewOS as one of their first two sales employees. I'm ecstatic about this opportunity. A past company I worked for was a startup that was already many years and several hundred employees into their growth, and I always found myself curious about the opportunity to have an even bigger impact at a startup even earlier in its growth. I'm so pumped to join another vertical SaaS company for a new industry where my previous sales skills will translate like a dream, but to do it at a critical early point in company development. The product and team at CrewOS are amazing. I absolutely have to recognize Tracy from Crew here. She recruited me on LinkedIn, and she's been awesome from our first connection all the way to our first day working together today, and I'm excited as heck to team up with her. The business: I opened a Gothic Home and Garden store called Doom and Bloom, and it launched this past Friday! 💀🌱 I've spent the last couple of months getting my LLC and learning the ropes of e-commerce, building the website, and building out my branding/social media presence. It's brand spankin' new so the future is hazy, but my goal is to move from an online store to an event vendor here in Austin to (hopefully) a brick and mortar store in addition to the online store. A pretty sharp change from my traditional sales path, but what LinkedIn doesn't know is: I'm a horror addict and \"elder goth\" with a green thumb and a communications degree. This path was probably overdue for me, honestly. 😜 And this is a stepping stone for an even bigger, even spookier business that I'll open later down the road. 💜 (And shameless plug- if you want to check out my store, you'll find it at www.doomandbloomshop.com or you can follow the store on Instagram @doom.and.bloom.shop 💜) I'm so excited about where I stand in life right now. So many things could happen: the contract could turn into something long-term. The store could take off and become a full time job. Both could happen. Neither could happen, and more doors will open. But no matter what happens, I can't wait to see where this path leads! So, no more green banner for now. Will it go back up after my contract? Who knows?! But I'm excited to find out. Thanks for all the supportive words and job recommendations along the green banner journey, LinkedIn community. 💜\n\n4 years in biz 🍰 Last year I took a photo in front of my shower curtain to celebrate the milestone last min This year, we found the time to bake a cake from scratch - Progress - They say it takes about 5 years to scale a bootstrapped biz to a point it’s “predictable” That math, maths in my experience I grew up: - often living in cars or half way houses with my mom - stealing and selling scrap metal to buy Taco Bell so I could feed and care for my baby brother while my mom left for days on end, my little brother who had cystic fibrosis, me only being 7-9 years old - waiting until 12 pm on the first of the month to use food stamps to get groceries as soon as they refilled - moving “out” at 15. No ID. No license. Slept in my friends closet for 16 months. Starting a business may 2020, and pushing through the toughest years in biz isn’t the hardest thing I’ve ever grown through 😅 It’s up there though, that’s for sure. Every day I am so thankful for the people who have trusted me with their - careers businesses precious vc dollars their job openings their training programs or with their careeer receipts & coaching Words will never describe what this sales community means to me Thank you!! Here’s your sign to start. Reinvent yourself. Do it. Push through. It’s worth it! $$$ Cheek out my company page for job opening The best is yet to come - I can feel it What are you celebrating today? #startup #business #salesrecruiter #gtmsalesrecruiter #itsdestinyrecruiting\n\n#Newfounderstory Wow. Pinch me. Yeah, duh, of course! We're doing really well, in fact above average in both ACV and ARR in same month benchmarks. It's so easy to get caught up in how much more can be done and needs to get done, to get trapped in letting the evil little voice that sits on your shoulder telling you that you could have done better - so great to take a breath and realize all that we have accomplished. And it's about to be even greater. A milestone moment happened yesterday. We were on a client call and our newest hire, Ryan Bush, was leading it. At this stage stage (and yes, arguably every stage) we need to be laser focused on building credibility and trust with every touch point, post sale. Nothing is more important than making your customers successful on your product and in their initiatives. My co-founder Courtney C. is not only focused on product, but understands we (the experience) are also the product, and thus created a tool to help us scope and onboard clients. They nailed it. This early in the game, key moments like this are incredibly telling in what and how we are building- totally co-founder crushing on my biz partners, Courtney C. and Jeff Reekers and realize we are so fortunate to have such a killer team already. Champs, here's looking at you today! xo, Gi"
