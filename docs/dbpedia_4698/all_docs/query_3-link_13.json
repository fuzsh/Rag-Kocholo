        "text": "Giving evidence yesterday, Mr Wright said he was impressed by Mr White’s plans and had supported them because Swords needed houses and a hotel.\n\nHe described how Mr White telephoned his constituency office in Malahide and the two men met there. As they discussed the venture, Mr Wright recommended Mr White should see the local councillors for the Swords area as well as the senior planners.\n\nMr Wright suggested Mr White make direct contact, through his architects, with the planning officials.\n\nThe Dublin North TD said yesterday there would have been general discussions among the Fianna Fáil group of councillors about the project.\n\n“It was a major development and I certainly would have made the group aware of my feelings for the development,” he told tribunal lawyer Pat Quinn SC.\n\nAsked about his relationship with former political lobbyist Frank Dunlop, Mr Wright said that at that stage, Mr Dunlop had a very successful public relations company.\n\nIn previous evidence, it was stated Mr Dunlop was hired by Mr White to act in a lobbying /PR capacity.\n\nLast week, Mr Dunlop, a former Fianna Fáil Government press secretary, admitted he was wrong when he said he paid a £1,000 bribe to Mr Wright in relation to the project.\n\nYesterday, Mr Wright acknowledged Mr Dunlop’s admission.\n\nIn his own statement to the tribunal, Mr Wright said he had received no payment or political donation from Mr Dunlop in respect of the Duff lands project.\n\nMr Dunlop is due to return to give evidence to the tribunal tomorrow."
