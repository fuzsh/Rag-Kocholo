Wales champions.\n\n17 March: Pope Shenouda III (the Coptic pope) Papa Abba Šenoude (b. 1923), has died. The 117th Pope of Alexandria & Patriarch of the See of St Mark, his episcopate lasted 40 years (from November 1971). A conservative figure in a conservative church, his official title was Pope of Alexandria and the Patriarch of All Africa on the Holy Apostolic See of Saint Mark the Evangelist of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. Here (right) he is pictured on his throne, lying in state, in all his regal splendour, (i.e., this is his corpse and this his wake) the Coptic tradition which continued for three days.\n\n18 March – break-in at justice minister Alan Shatter‘s home in Dublin.\n\n22 March – The Mahon Tribunal published the findings of its 15 years of investigations into corruption in Irish public life, that is, the Tribunal of Inquiry Into Certain Planning Matters and Payments. Commonly known as ‘the Mahon Tribunal’ after the name of its last chairman, Judge Alan Mahon, this was a public inquiry established by Dáil Éireann [the parliament of the Irish Republic] in 1997 to investigate persistent allegations of various forms of corrupt payments to politicians and officials. (Judge Alan Mahon was the final chair of the tribunal; the chairman at the outset and for most of its proceedings was Judge Feargus Flood, hence the original term in common usage ‘the Flood Tribunal’.) The tribunal ran from November 1997 to March 2012, the longest running and most expensive public inquiry in Ireland — costs estimated to total out at between €250 million and €300 million. Public hearings concluded in September 2008, and following several delays due to various legal challenges (from people who could still afford to do such things), the tribunal set about preparing its final report. (The tribunal published four interim reports, but this, on 22 March 2012, is its final report.) THE REPORT FOUND that former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern failed to “truthfully” explain the sources of various payments to him, rejecting his attempted representation of these payments as “dig-outs” from friends at the time of his divorce etc — of one sum at one point Ahern said he couldn’t explain it but he might have “won it on the horses”; of course it was meant to be light-hearted but those amused by it were a thinning band of die-hard supporters of dubious cognitive acuity. (In April 2008, Ahern had been forced to resign as Taoiseach [prime minister] due to continuing controversies arising from the tribunal’s proceedings, specifically his utterly incredible testimony and the negative public reaction thereto. The party was underwater in the polls by then, so much so he was persuaded to go — and then, of course, financial crash of 2008-9 happened, which totally destroyed the chances of a recovery in the party’s fortunes.) The tribunal also found that former EU Commissioner Pádraig Flynn (another Fianna Fáil godfather) “wrongly and corruptly” sought payments from English property-developer Tom Gilmartin. (Many other lesser culprits were identified but these two were the headline figures.) FOLLOWING PUBLICATION the Irish government — by this time a Fine Gael and Labour Party coalition — referred the 3,270-page report to the Garda Commissioner, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Revenue Commissioners, and also to the newly-established Standards in Public Office Commission. After the final report’s publication what was left of the Fianna Fáil Party — which suffered slaughter in the 2011 general election (reduced to just 20 members of parliament, down from 71) — sought to expel members found to have received corrupt payments. However, Bertie Ahern, Pádraig Flynn, G. V. Wright, Don Lydon, Finbarr Hanrahan, John Hannon et al, all resigned from the party before they could be expelled.\n\n24 March – People packed to capacity the National Stadium in Dublin for a rally to protest the household charge payment introduced in the last Budget. Crowds unable to get in gathered outside.\n\n24 March – death of Jocky Wilson, one-time world darts champion (b. 1950).\n\n24 March – The Sunday Times releases video evidence of Conservative Party co-treasurer Peter Cruddas offering undercover reporters access to UK Prime Minister David Cameron for £250,000 (i.e., private dinners at Downing Street).\n\n25 March – denying any wrong-doing, Peter Cruddas resigns as Tory Party co-treasurer following the “Cash for Access” revelations (see above).\n\n26 March – in the wake of the “Cash for Access” scandal (see above) David Cameron publishes details of all Conservative Party donors who have had dinner with him at Downing Street (10 Downing Street being the official London residence of the British prime minister).\n\n28 March: death of English playwright John Arden (aged 81) — Sergeant Musgrave’s Dance etc — who lived and died in Galway in the west of Ireland.\n\n27 March – The cost of a first-class stamp in Britain will rise from 46p to 60p from 30 April, while second class post will increase from 36p to 50p, after regulator Ofcom lifts some price controls on Royal Mail.\n\n29 March – Respect Party candidate [and general pain in the ass] George Galloway wins the Bradford West by-election in the UK with a majority of 10,140 votes, taking the seat from the Labour Party (which he was once a member of — once a Labour Party member of parliament indeed). Lots of angry Muslims in Bradford West (and lots of sick-of-New-Labour people too), whose frustrations and grievances Galloway cleverly surfed to find his way back onto the green benches of the House of Commons.\n\nApril\n\n5 April: death of Barney McKenna (aged 72), founding member of the Irish folk music group The Dubliners.\n\n6 April: Good Friday\n\n8 April: Easter Sunday\n\n11 April – in his own constituency Irish environment minister Phil Hogan sought sanctuary in a Carlow cathedral after running away from people protesting about his new property tax.\n\n14 April – As the Labour Party (the junior partner in the governing coalition in Ireland) held its centenary conference in the Bailey Allen Hall in the National University of Ireland campus in Galway, Gardaí used pepper spray to hold back anti-austerity demonstrators protesting government austerity measures. The conference venue was lock-down secured amid chants of “Revolution, revolution!” with demonstrators sporting a coffin draped in the Irish tricolour.\n\n19 April – Gavin O’Reilly, chief executive of Independent News & Media, resigns at the end of long-running dispute with Denis O’Brien, the company’s leading shareholder.\n\n22 April: death of Irish artist Louis Le Brocquy (aged 95).\n\n26 April – Former Liberian president Charles Taylor found guilty on 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, crimes which were committed during the war in neighbouring Sierra Leone (he also started a civil war in his own country, in the 1990s, which is how he came to power in the first place).\n\n30 April – Data released by the Met Office ranks April the wettest April on record in the United Kingdom.\n\nMay\n\n2 May – a pastel version of Edvard Munch‘s ‘The Scream’ sells for $120 million USD in New York City auction, setting a new world record for an auctioned work of art.\n\n2 May – Cardinal Seán Brady, Archbishop of Armagh and Roman Catholic Primate of All-Ireland et cet, embroiled in controversy in the wake of a BBC television programme alleging he failed to act in 1975 when a sex abuse survivor gave him a list of children being abused by jailed paedophile and former priest Brendan Smyth. (Brady sought to silence the victim and protect the good standing of the church, which in effect meant sheltering the abuser; his grace the cardinal does not accept that he has anything to answer for.)\n\n3 May – Denis O’Brien buys another 5% stake in Independent News & Media, taking his stake in the company to 27%\n\n3 May – Local elections in England, Scotland, and Wales. Labour Party make gains, winning the largest number of councillors in England and Wales, while in Scotland the Scottish National Party make further gains achieving the largest number of local council seats. Nationally vote share was: 39% Labour, 31% Conservative, 16% Liberal Democrats, and others 14%. Boris Johnson re-elected Mayor of London with 51.5% of the vote. Ken Livingston, his Labour Party opponent (and former mayor) subsequently says that that is his last election (Ken’s last election). In the London Assembly, Labour becomes the party with the most seats, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats losing out. The British National Party have lost their only seat on the Assembly. Of the Assembly’s 25 seats, the final tally stands at: Labour 12, Conservatives 9, Liberal Democrats 2, and Greens 2.\n\n5 May – with a 2–1 win over Liverpool in the final, Chelsea win their seventh FA Cup.\n\n9 May: death of Vidal Sasson, British style guru and entrepreneur (b. 1928).\n\n9 May: Archaeologists announce discovery on the Burren (in County Clare) of evidence of a settlement from circa 6000 BCE.\n\n13 May – Manchester City win the Premier League title on goal difference ahead of cross-city rivals United, City’s first top division title since 1968.\n\n15 May: Socialist Party’s François Hollande defeats Nicolas Sarkozy in the French presidential elections\n\n15 May – death of Carlos Fuentes, Panamanian-born Mexican writer (b. 1928) — The Death of Artemio Cruz, Aura, Terra Nostra, The Old Gringo, Christopher Unborn etc.\n\n16 May – The Garda Síochána (the police force in the Irish Republic) destroyed the Occupy Galway camp in an overnight raid (see also 8 March and 14 April, above, and 17 May, below).\n\n17 May – Irish prime minister Enda Kenny heckled and booed by anti-austerity protesters in Galway.\n\n19 May – in Munich’s Allianz Arena, Chelsea win the European Cup for the first time in their history, defeating Germany’s Bayern Munich on penalties after a 1–1 draw.\n\n17 May– death of Donna Summer, American disco diva (b. 1948).\n\n20 May – death of Robin Gibb (of Bee Gees fame), British-Australian pop musician (b. 1949).\n\n22 May – Tokyo Skytree is opened to the public, at 634 metres the tallest self-supporting tower in the world.\n\n25 May – Millionaire’s daughter Laura Johnson, who ferried looters around London during the 2011 riots in London, is jailed for two years.\n\n31 May – Constitutional referendum to permit Ireland to ratify the 2012 European Fiscal Compact passes.\n\n–\n\nJune\n\n2-5 June – UK celebrates the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II (60 years on the throne) with a four-day bank holiday weekend.

She also received the Freedom of the City of Dublin, which was granted her in 2000. And at an “Electric Burma” concert at the Bord Gáis Energy Theatre, she was presented with the Amnesty Ambassador of Conscience Award which had been awarded to her in 2009.

Really horrible!\n\n19 June: Julian Assange, editor-in-chief and founder of the whistleblower’s website WikiLeaks has taken up residence inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London where he has applied for diplomatic asylum. Since November 2010, Assange has been subject to a European Arrest Warrant in response to a Swedish police request for his apprehension for questioning in relation to a sexual assault investigation. In June 2012, following final dismissal by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom of his appeal against enforcement of the European Arrest Warrant, Assange has failed to surrender himself, and has been treated by the UK authorities as having absconded. The British government intends to extradite Assange to Sweden when (or if) he leaves the embassy, which Assange says may result in his subsequent extradition to the United States to face charges relating to the Bradley/Chelsea Manning prosecution. (WikiLeaks became internationally well known in 2010 when it began publishing U.S. military and diplomatic documents. Chelsea Manning — then Bradley Manning — has since pleaded guilty to supplying the leaked files to WikiLeaks, for which s/he was been sentenced to 28 years prison-time.)\n\n24 June: a Chinese spacecraft carrying three Chinese astronauts (including their first female ‘naut) docks manually with an orbiting module Tiangong 1, making them the third country, after the United States and Russia, to successfully perform such a mission.\n\n24 June – England lose penalty shoot-out at the Olimpiyskiy National Sports Complex in Kiev so Italy through to a Euro 2012 semi-final against Germany (Spain go on to win the tournament beating Italy 4-0 in the final).\n\n28 June – A man is killed as torrential rain causes widespread flooding across England.
