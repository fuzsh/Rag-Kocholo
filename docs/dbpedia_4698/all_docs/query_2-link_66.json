        "text": "Just before Christmas I signed up a new client, sent the contract and invoice and heard nothing more despite a couple of reminders. I assumed that on reflection they had changed their mind, it happens. This week I received a call followed by an email from their partner asking if any money was owed or whether there was anything outstanding. He advised that she had been killed in an accident. What a huge shock. Her death was sudden, unexpected and as a result no plans were in place for what happens next. There were many difficulties getting access to records, emails, accounts hence the delay contacting me. It has made me review and rethink my arrangements. What are your arrangements as small business owners if the worst happens? Do you have someone who can contact your clients? What about the data in your CRM or other systems? How will this be managed? Who has authority to manage your bank account and act on your behalf? These are things that are easy to overlook while we are in good health and not as exciting as a new brand or design or sales. Now, while you are well is the time to make these arrangements, to make these plans so if the worst happens it is easy for those left behind to look after your business."
