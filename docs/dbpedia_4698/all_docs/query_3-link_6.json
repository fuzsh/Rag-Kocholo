        "text": "But he acknowledged receiving political donations of £10,000 — in cash — from Mr Dunlop between 1991 and 1993. He received £5,000 in Mr Dunlop’s office; £3,000 in an envelope in the environs of the council offices, and £2,000 — wrapped in a newspaper — in the Dáil bar.\n\nDenying Mr Dunlop’s claim, Mr Wright said this proposal would have brought jobs into his constituency and he would not need some sort of payment to support it.\n\nReferring to the controversial rezoning, Judge Keys said councillors had a map in front of them showing the red zone area; that something built in that area would have a seriously detrimental effect on the safety of aircraft landing on runway 11/29.\n\nThe tribunal had been told how Aer Rianta, the airports authority, had warned the 18 acres of agricultural land up for rezoning lay in the flight path of this runway.\n\nWhen Mr Wright said developments were going on all around the area, Judge Keys said that was irrelevant.\n\nTony Fox, a member of Dublin Co Council in 1993, said he never got any money from Frank Dunlop. The lobbyist alleged Mr Fox asked for money and he gave him £1,000 before a council vote on the Cloghran lands in September 1993.\n\nEntries in Mr Dunlop’s phone diary recorded a call made by Mr Fox the day before a council vote on the Cloghran rezoning motion, requesting the lobbyist to contact him but Mr Fox could not recall why he wanted Mr Dunlop to return his call."
