VAT) 65p sterling area No. 43,333 CITY DUBLIN, THURSDAY, JULY 2, 1992 Three killed after Sligo body find By Gerry Moriarty and Jim Cusack HREE bodies, believed to be the victims of IRA “‘executions”’, were discovered last night in sep- arate areas of south Armagh. There was speculation early this morning that the murders may be linked to the finding on Tuesday / of the body believed to be of a Portadown woman, Ms Margaret Perry (26), in Mullaghmore, Co Sligo. She had been abducted a year ago. The three deaths mark the end- ing of the longest gap between killings in Northern Ireland since Men found murdered and dumped in south Armagh early 1970. Fifty-six days had elapsed since the last killing in the North in early May, when the IPLO shot dead Mr Billy Sergeant (65), in a North Belfast bar. The areas where the bodies were located were cordoned off this morning as the RUC and British army mounted a major check. The South Armagh area near Crossmaglen where the bodies were found is a notorious dumping ground for so-called IRA informers. It is reported that the dead men were found hooded and stripped. A priest who gave the Last Rites to one of the victims spoke of his body being bruised and mutilated. The Rev AF McCourt from Newtownhamilton, Co Ar- magh, said that one of his parish- ioners called to him, last night saying he had discoverd a body at Henry’s Bridge near Newtownhamilton on the main . Dundalk-Armagh road. Father McCourt alerted the RUC and visited the scene to administer the Last Rites. “The body was dumped in a ditch. It was hooded and there was a vast quantity of blood around the head. It was stripped naked and bruised,” he said. The Rev John Duffy from Dundalk, who also visited the scene, said the man had been “‘terribly muti- lated”. Later, two more bodies were found in the vicinity of Crossmaglen. _ The Rev Donal Sweeney, who is reported to have administered the Last Rites to a body in Culloville, spoke of the victim being hooded and bloody. The deaths come 24 hours after the body, believed to be Ms Perry’s,was found in a shallow grave at Mullaghmore. The IRA. in a statement said she was the! victim of British military agents. They said a further statement would follow. This aroused fears for the lives of at least two men, reported to have IRA links, who went missing in the Portadown area two weeks ago. RUC detec- tives are trying to determine if the IRA statement was shorthand for suggesting a link between her death and the discovery of the three bodies last night. The IRA claim that she was killed by British military intelli- gence agents could possibly mean that informers within the para- military organisation’s own ranks had some involvement in her death. Early this morning, the RUC confirmed that three bodies had been found but said at this stage they could give no further details. Father Duffy said there was something attached to the foot of the body of the first man found near Newtownhamilton. Because of this, he decided that it might be dangerous to approach the body.

North parties and | Government may > & meet next week | Dublin and London From Gerry Moriarty in Belfast, and Joe Carroll THE talks aimed at achieving a new British-Irish agreement have moved forward dramatically after all four Northern parties involved in the process agreed to hold sub- stantive Strand Two North-South talks. The opening session of these historic discussions, which would bring together Government Min- isters and Nothern political lead- ers, could get under way in London as early as next week. The Government has warmly welcomed the announcement from Belfast. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Andrews, warned, however, that any future attempts to amend Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution could “‘raise very strong passions.”’ The British Prime Minister, Mr Major, last night welcomed the news. His statement said: ““We welcome the progress that has been made, and the moves to stages two and three.” Mr Andrews’s response to the development was given within an hour of the announcement by the Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew. Mr Andrews was speaking during a debate on Northern Ireland in the Seanad which urged the Government to do its utmost to promote a politi- cal solution in Northern Ireland. There was a flurry of excitement in the Chamber when word came from Stormont and Mr Andrews rose to speak. A delighted Sir Patrick an- nounced to reporters at Stormont shortly before 6 pm yesterday that the most serious obstacle to progress had been overcome, and that Sir Ninian Stephen could now convene an opening meeting between the Government and the Northern constitutional parties. The announcement by Sir Pat- rick effectively puts to one side welcome dramatic progress in talks the Strand One talks, which in- volve the Northern party leaders and which had become seriously bogged down because of funda- mental differences between the parties. Sir Patrick announced the move to the controversial second stage of the talks after he and a Northern Ireland Office Minister, Mr Jeremy Hanley, held a num- ber of meetings with the party leaders at Stormont yesterday. This was followed in the after- noon by a plenary meeting where he announced he was finally tak- ing the initiative to push the talks substantially forward. He formally proposed the launch of Strands Two and Three and, the official NIO statement said, “in the light of the points made by the Secretary of State during consultation and in ple- nary, the party leaders indicated that they accepted the proposal.” Of this development in the pro- tracted talks process, Sir Patrick said: “It is the best moment so far.” It is now up to Sir Ninian to decide when the Strand Two Lon- don talks begin but in the-light of the longstanding: difficulty over moving to this sensitive stage, it is being predicted that he will “strike while the iron is hot” and call a meeting next week. Mr Andrews said yesterday that the Government looked forward ‘to working actively and con- structively in Strand Two, under the independent chairmanship of Sir Ninian Stephen, with a view to ensuring the decisive contribu- tion which Strand Two must make to the outcome of the talks process as a whole.” Strand Two, which involves the two Govern- ments and the four parties in Northern Ireland, was “a very important and integral part of the process which was agreed on 26th March 1991”. In reply to Senators John A. Murphy and David Norris, who had called for the amendment or removal of Articles 2 and 3 as part of the talks, Mr Andrews said this was an issue “on which our people as a whole must pro- nounce, if or when a question is put to them in a referendum. Such a referendum would touch on very deep issues and could raise very strong passions.” The Minister said that it would be important to ensure that any amendment “would not appear to be a denial of the _ of people born or living in Northern Ire- land to be Irish.” Any proposal’: which seemed to go in that direc- tion would, he believed, “meet with very considerable oppo- sition.” Also, any amendment which could be interpreted as a denial of ‘“‘a strong aspiration to unity by peaceful means and by agree- ment” would likewise “‘meet with — opposition”, Mr Andrews said. The breakthrough comes following the “Strand Three for- mation talks” between the Irish and British governments in Lon- don on Tuesday at which the four Northern parties had observers, including the previously key ob- jector to Strand Two talks, the ev Ian Paisley of the DUP. While the deadlock has been broken, the divisions between the Ulster Unionists, the DUP and the SDLP over finding Strand One agreement on a new form of government for the North still exist. The Unionist parties are bit- terly opposed to the SDLP’s de- volution proposals, which include Southern and European dimen- sions to governing the North. Dr Paisley in particular has stated repeatedly up to this week that there could be no North-South talks until Strand One was con- cluded. Sir Patrick Sonceded that Strand One is still a major stumbling block. He said that while the North-South and Strand Three “East-West” talks could continue, further consideration to Strand One may be necessary at a | § later stage. Responding to the Secretary of State’s announcement, the Labour Party leader, Mr Dick Spring, said last night that it was essential that the momentum of the talks should not be broken. Welcoming the news, the dep- uty Fine Gael leader, Mr Peter Barry, said it was essential that the three strands of talks “move together”. He said, however, that . progress would not be instant. Deputy Eamon Gilmore of Democratic Left said the devel- opments were very encouraging. See also page 2.

See also page 7 Bill increases condom availability By Maol Muire Tynan, Political Reporter THE Family Planning Bill, long delayed and much revised, which permits the sale of condoms from all commercial and retail outlets to those over 17, is expected to be passed by the Dail and Seanad next week. The Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Bill, 1992, puib- lished yesterday by the Minister for Health, Dr O’Connell, does not include the controversial pro- posal in last ar Family Plan- ning Bill that health boards would have discretion over which out- lets could distribute condoms. The new Bill also reduces the age limit at which people may buy condoms, without prescrip- tion, from 18 to 17. The former Taoiseach, Mr Charles Haughey, had originally proposed lowering the age limit for purchase to 16, an issue that led to considerable discord within the Coalition. . * ~ Under the new law, already widely criticised by the opposi- tion, condoms may not be sold through vending machines, mo- bile outlets, street vendors or in primary or secondary schools. Their sale is also prohibited in youth clubs or sports centres ca- tering for people under 17. Natu- rally, the vendor must be over 17 also. Dr O’Connell said his primary concern was the issue of public health and he would personally prefer to allow distribution of condoms through vending ma- chines, as he had stated within two weeks of being appointed to the portfolio earlier this year. He denied he had encountered resistance in Cabinet to the use of vending machines. He said it was the reservations he received from the public, particularly from the parents of younger children, which led him to the conclusion that this method of distribution should not be introduced yet. = “I am sure that condoms will be widely available from now on. They will be sold in all commer- cial and retail outlets, and that includes supermarkets, shops, pubs, barber shops and adult discos. “Their wide availability is essential since we have had an in- crease of almost 50 per cent in the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases between 1986 and 1990. We have over 1,200 HIV cases and 276 instances of full-blown AIDS,” the Minister said. Because 40 per cent of those with AIDS were intravenous drug ‘users, his Department had de- cided to distribute condoms free to addicts who attend a number of “‘satellite clinics” to be estab- lished around the Republic, Dr O’Connell said. He acknowledged, meanwhile, that it is still up to individual vendors to decide if they should stock condoms, but he was confi- dent sales of the non-medical § i contraceptives would increase under the new legislation. In spite of the Minister’s assur- ances in relation to widespread availability of condoms, opposi- tion parties expressed deep reser- vations about the proposals. According to the Fine Gael spokesman on health, Mr Rich- ard Bruton, the Government is insisting on an age limit which it knows is unenforceable. According to the Labour Party spokesman on health and social policy, Mr Brendan Howlin, it was “‘quite inexplicable” that the Government and the Minister should have delayed sc long in publishing the new Bill. “The Bill is a failure by the Minister for Health in his prime responsibility to promote a health policy that adequately safeguards the well-being of the _ Irish people,”’ Mr Howlin said.

This was less a product of tired journalism than a reflection of the enormous goodwill which accompanies the process. Goodwill toward the par- ticipants — and, in particular, toward the two. unionist parties — will have increased considerably with their deci- sion to progress to the subse- quent strands. Optimism, too, will be on the increase, if restrained ~ by Sir Patrick’s warning on Tuesday that there is a long way still to go. Whatever distance the parties now travel, the talks a will be widely held to ave been justified. Dublin has always -been concerned about the consequence of fail- ure. But the pzrameters and agenda have been established, and they will not be easily escaped by any party in the short or long term. That said, finding agree- ment will not be easy either. Despite their past declara- tions, the unionist leaders have agreed to move to Strand Two without definitive agreement on the future struc- ture of government for North- ern Ireland. The SDLP maintains its ‘‘reservations’’ about the devolution plan developed by the unionist parties and Alli- ance. By all accounts, that plan requires much in the way of definition and development. It falls far short of what the SDLP considers ‘‘a solution” to the Northern Ireland prob- em. For the time being at least, the unionists have been pre- pared to journey in the belief that Sir Patrick favours their approach. However, some senior unionists admit to worries that the chemistry may be altogether different when British ministers are joined at the table by their rish counterparts. Keeping the British government onside therefore appears to have been an important tactical spur to the unionist agreement yesterday. How that plays out will much depend on the unionist perfor- mance in Strand Two, and on the question of London’s own objec- tives in the talks. If the unionists were content to seek devolution as envisaged by the Anglo-Irish Agreement, then London would have little diffi- culty (though the same may not now be true for Dublin and the SDLP). In any event, the unionists want an alternative agreement. They have yet to resolve the conflict between the scale of that ambition and the comparative modesty of their proposals to date. It seems reasonable to assume that there will be nothing modest about the SDLP’s ambitions for future North-South relationships. If Articles Two and Three are to be abandoned, the price will un- doubtedly be high. Sinn Féin may currently be in decline, but the SDLP will not want to waste the advantage de- veloped in the past seven years. The party, moreover, feels that it remains in the driving seat and that, unlike the unionists, it has the Agreement to fall back on in the event of failure. ‘ That belief has been the opera- tive assumption in much comment about Northern Ireland since 1985. But the SDLP is not entirely thrilled by London’s en- thusiasm to take the controls. And between them, Mr Brooke and Sir Patrick Mayhew have opened the field in a way not seen since Hillsborough. The unionists are not the only ones who will have to make Strategic adjustments to that fact. DeLorean cannot be extradited THE businessman, Mr John DeLorean, cannot be extradited from the US to stand trial in Brit- ain following the failure of his car project in Belfast in 1982, the at- torney general, Sir Nicholas Lyell, confirmed in a Commons written reply last night. He said that the Royal Ulster Constabulary held a warrant for Mr DeLorean’s arrest on charges of conspiracy to defraud, but time had now run out for extradi- tion. “I am advised that the laws of the United States provide a limi- tation period after which extradi- tion is not normally possible. _ “While the period varies, de- pending upon the offence alleged, the period in this case expired be- _ fore the Serious Fraud Office was created.” He said it was the SFO’s inves- tigation “which produced the evi- dence justifying the obtaining of the warrant against Mr DeLorean”’. A .British partner in Mr DeLorean’s car project, Fred Bushell, was sentenced at Belfast Crown Court last week to three years’ imprisonment and a fine of £700,000 for defrauding the Brit- ish taxpayer. A # Me fees, Lord Justices Stuckay said Bushell had engage? in a “bare- faced, outragtotis “itd massive fraud” in connection ~awith.- project. — (PA) the}.Ms..Perry:s. disap Body found in Sligo may By Jim Cusack, Security Correspondent THE State Pathologist, Dr John Harbison, was last night examin- ing human remains found in a shallow grave near Mullaghmore, Co Sligo, which may be those of a oung Co Armagh woman who is elieved to have been abducted and murdered a year ago. The remains were found on Tuesday after information was apparently given to gardai in Sligo by a Northern Ireland priest who is understood to have been led to the grave by a young man. It is believed the body is that of Ms Margaret Perry (26), from Portadown, Co Armagh, who dis- —_— from her home in June 1991. A Portadown priest, the Rev Arthur MclInerney, confirmed yesterday that he had been con- tacted by an anonymous caller on Tuesday and told to inform Ms Perry’s family to be prepared for “bad news”’. Chief Superintendent Michael Ringrose of Sligo asked for any witnesses who might have seen a — man of slim build wearing lue denim jeans in the area around Mullaghmore' on oa The discovery of the body yes- terday sparked considerable spec- ulation about the background to ance, .with. one report in a Belfast newspaper be Portadown eae ree e % . ae Ms Margaret Perry: her body may have been found in Sligo quoting an IRA spokesman as blaming the British security forces for her death. There was no attempt to substantiate this. The claim contradicts previous, again unsubstantiated, reports that Ms Perry was, in fact, killed by north Armagh IRA members. _A report in the Northern edi- tion of the Sunday World on April 12th last reported that Ms Perry had been beaten to death and “buried in a shallow grave across the Border” and that republican amilitaries were responsible or her killing. | with the Training and Employ- woman ment Agency in Lisburn, Co An- trim, had been murdered by a “‘prominent republican with a his- tory of beating up women” who had been an IRA member. The Sunday World reporter, Martin O’Hagan, quoted “republi- can sources” in Portadown as say- ing a sum of money Ms Perry had saved to buy a house had been stolen by “one of a gang of rene- gade Provos’’. It said she had in- tended going to Monaghan to complain to a leading IRA figure, but was ee on her way there by one of the Portadown IRA figures, beaten to death and buried in Sligo. The site where the body was buried is inside the Classiebawn Castle estate which formerly be- longed to Lord Mountbatten, who was killed by the IRA in August 1979 while on_ holiday in Mullaghmore. Yesterday the Jrish News in Bel- fast published a front-page report under the headline: “IRA claims woman was murdered by British”’. A spokesman for the Republican Press Centre in Belfast yesterday said that a statement attributed to the IRA, carried in yesterday’s Irish News, saying that Ms Perry had been murdered by “people acting on behalf of MI5, British Intell ; The report i d that Mé’Perry, nte pence and the RUC Special ith....who worked. asi.a.clerical officer : Branch who feared that their ac- tivities would be exposed”; -had not been issued by the centre. Travel THE Co Wicklow home of Adrian Hopkins, imprisoned for his part in attempting to smuggle arms into the country on board the Eksund for the Provisional IRA, is up for sale with a reserve price of £180,000, the High Court was told yesterday. Mr Joe Walsh, head of Joe Walsh Tours Ltd, claims he got judgment for £20,000, plus inter- est and costs, against Hopkins a a High Court action in Yesterday Mr Walsh, of Ardilea House, Mount Anville Road, Dublin, obtained a tempo- operator granted was a well-known fact that Hof- kins had been managing director and principal shareholder of Bray Travel Ltd, which went into liqui- dation in 1981, and of another company Bray Travel (UK) Ltd, rary order from Mr__ Justice Blayney which restrains Hopkins, and his wife Stephanie, from dis- posing of, or removing from the country, the proceeds of the sale of Holly Hill, Greystones, except those exceeding £75,000. Mr Paul O’Neill, barrister (in- structed by Reddy, Charlton and McKnight), made the application on behalf of the tour company. The injunction continues until Monday next. In an affidavit, Mr Walsh said he was managing director and ewig 9 shareholder of Joe alsh Tours. He also said that it registered in Belfast. The North- ern mr re owed Joe Walsh Tours £20,000. In 1988, the High Court found Hopkins liable and ordered him to pay £20,000 and interest from 1981. Hopkins had filed a notice of appeal, said Mr Walsh. It appeared, he said, the resi- dence, which was originally in the name of Hopkins, had been trans- order ferred into the name of his wife; the result being that Hopkins had denuded himself of the only asset to which his creditors could look for payment. It recently came to his notice that Hopkins and his wife were attempting to sell their residence. He claimed that Hopkins had attempted to frustrate Joe Walsh Tours from recovering the sum due to it. He was “extremely con- cerned” Hopkins would dissipate the proceeds of sale unless restrained. The total now due to his company was £44,498, and costs were £11,313. } : $ By Edward O’ Loughlin THE annou®cement by the Min- ister for the Environment, Mr Smith, of the first increase in taxi fares since 1985 failed to prevent a protest convoy of about 1,000 members ‘of the Irish Taxi Drivers’ Federation (ITDF) bringing chaos to afternoon traf- fic in Dublin yesterday. The drivers were protesting at the carrying of radio equipment by hackney cabs, which has been banned since 1983, and were call- ing for an increase in fares, ac- cording to the president of the ITDF, Mr John Ussher. The organisation claims 1,500 members in Dublin and large | numbers of taxi-licence owners from Tralee, Limerick, Galway, Cork, Waterford, Drogheda and Dundalk also participated, said Mr Ussher. Gardai estimated that 1,000 taxis took part, causing “terrible disruption” for two hours in the city centre. Several gardai were on duty at O*Connell Bridge dur- ing the protest, taking the num- bers of any cabs which infringed the junction boxes. The Minister’s announcement on fares was accompanied by two _other initiatives: 50 new licences Protest goes on despite taxi fare increase were issued for wheelchair-acces- sible taxis in Dublin, while the moratorium on new hackney li- cences was removed. The latter initiative is likely to be unpopular with existing licence-holders. In addition, the Minister also published an inter-departmental report on the taxi business con- taining recommendations which, if adopted, would transform the on taxi, limousine and hearse hire industries. The Minister’s new fare struc- ture accedes to the ITDF’s request for an increase in the basic mileage rate to 8Up, up 5p, a reduction from one mile to half- a-mile in the distance for which the initial £1.80 fare applies (with ro-rata increases where time of journey establishes the fare), and an increase in extra charges for public holiday work. He turned down requests for a separate rate of fare from the point at which a fare reaches £7 and for higher charges for fares beginning at Dublin Airport. Ac- cording to Mr Ussher, the new fares structure should mean a 50p increase in the cost of an average taxi journey. Mr Smith’s decisions to grant 50 licences for wheelchair-access cabs in Dublin and to allow more hackney licences to be issued were among 64 separate recom- mendations made by the inter- departmental committee on hackneys and taxis, which was es- tablished last year. Significantly for yesterday’s protest, the report recommends that hackney cabs, which unlike taxis cannot ply for public hire or carry a taxi meter, be allowed to retain radios used to communicate with their base. The ITDF could not be con- tacted for comment on Mr Smith’s proposals last night. WEATHER SYSTEMATIC weather observations are a_ recent craze. Here in Ireland, for example, they could be.said to have begun with the work of Richard Kirwan, a_ dilettante weatherman of Cavendish Row in Dublin. Kirwan maintained ‘an array of meteorological instruments at his home, and used them to carry out detailed weather observations for the 30 years or so before his death in 1812. But this was rare; most of the information we have about weather conditions be- fore, say, the middle of the last century, has been gathered in a ‘ variety of much more devious ways. Contemporary manuscripts are a favoured and a fruitful Source. Many people in days gone by kept special weather- diaries, or at the very least mentioned the weather from time to time in passing in their other writings. Even official documents and other chronicles of times long past make detailed reference to storms and droughts and floods. These, of course, are all descriptive — but over the years climatologists have evolved clever techniques which allow them to relate these descriptive reports to numerical values in a surpris- ingly accurate and consistent way. Probably the earliest refer- ence to weather in an Irish manuscript is a report in the Annals of the Four Masters of Historical meteorologists Dublin called Maximillian a vicious storm upon Lough Conn, which is believed to have occurred in 2668 B.C. The earliest weather-journal proper that we know of is a weather diary for Kilkenny, for 1682 and 1683, kept by an employee of the Duke of Ormonde.. The diarists were more prolific in the foliowing century: Thomas Neve of Ballyneilmore, in Co Derry, chronicled the elements from 1711 until 1725; James Simon documented the period from 1753 to 1755; Dr John Rutty summarised the Dublin weather 1716 to 1766; and the Rev Henry Ussher maintained a weather register at Dunsink Observatory from 1786 to 1790. A Huguenot immigrant to Faviere carried the story into the next century with regular weather diaries kept on the blank pages of printed alma- nacs from 1781 to 1812. It is likely, of course, that there is a great deal more information of this kind than we know about — tucked away in attics and in trunks around the country. Mrs Lisa Shields is the librarian of the Meteoro- logical Service Library, and she maintains a catalogue of any such material in private hands around the . country. Should you make a _ chance discovery among the family heirlooms, she would welcome the chance to havea look at it, and to add it to her list.

Speaking from notes, Mr O’Malley said that the policy pursued by Mr Reynolds of confining export credit insurance (ECIS) cover to just two companies had “‘its gene- sis” in a meeting between Mr Reynolds and Mr Larry Goodman on November 13th, 1987, and a subsequent letter from Good- man International to Mr Reynolds’s De- partment. This is the first time at the tribunal that Mr O’Malley has gone so far as to say that an important Government policy decision originated, not in consideration of overall industrial policy, but in Mr Goodman’s representations to Mr Reynolds. The letter to which Mr O’Malley referred is particu- larly controversial because its contents were subsequently altered and did not a pear on Departmental files. , Under a second day of cross-examina- tion by Mr Dermot Gleeson SC, for Good- man International, Mr O’Malley was responding to contentions that a number of offical reports on industrial policy, from Telesis, NESC and the Department of In- dustry and Commerce, supported the idea of selectivity in State aids to industry. He said that the “managed policy (the policy of confining cover to just two com- panies and excluding their competitors from the Iraqi market) doesn’t have its par- entage or genesis” in the reports con- cerned, but in the meeting between Mr Goodman and Mr Reynolds on November 1 3th. On that day, he said, Mr Goodman complained to Mr Reynolds about the pres- ence of his competitors in Baghdad. On the same day, Mr Goodman got an extra $30 million allocation of cover which resulted, Mr O’Malley said, in another company, Agra Trading, “being put out”. This accords with previous civil service TRIBUNAL OF INQUIRY INTO THE BEEF PROCESSING INDUSTRY O’Malley makes further substantial allegation evidence to the tribunal that, before meet- ing Mr Goodman, Mr Reynolds inquired about the levels of exposure to Iraq and subsequently decided to withdraw the cover allocated to Agra so that Goodman could be facilitated with the extra cover. Mr O’Malley went on to say that “shortly afterwards” Halal’s cover was withdrawn and referred this toa letter of November 27th sent to the Department by Goodman International and received by Mr Reynolds (according to the evidence of an official, Mr Joe Timbs) that morning. At 2.30 p.m. that same day, said Mr O’Malley, the decision to exclude Halal was made, was made, and they were informed of it at 4 p.m. The thrust of all of these representa- tions, according-to Mr O’Mailey, “‘was an antipathy to competition”. The letter which Mr Reynolds received that day contains the following paragraph: ‘From a marketing perspective, it is imper- ative that the Iraqis see a united front from the sellers of Irish beef in order to preserve the price premium now clearly estab- lished. . . For Ireland, a single voice is an essential marketing tool to prevent such an occurrence. Because of our history in the market, AIBP (the Goodman company) should be that voice, and I would therefore request that your Department reject sund applications for credit from various Irish suppliers. . .” It is to this paragraph in particular that Fintan O’Toole analyses the evidence of Mr O’Malley’s third day of cross- examination. Mr O’Malley was referring in tracing the genesis of the “managed policy” to Mr Goodman’s representations. The import of the allegation is that it ascribes the deci- sions to exclude two other meat companies from ECIS cover to the influence of Mr Goodman rather than to calculations of the ‘“‘national interest” based on an assessment of industrial policy. The paragraph itself, however, has a chequered history. According to the evi- dence of Mr Timbs, he was offended by it, sent the letter back to AIBP so that it might be removed, and kept no copy. When the letter arrived back with the offending para- me deleted, early in January 1988, it was ackdated to November 27th and now con- tained an application for cover for $155 million rather than for $52 million, as had been the case with the original letter. The original letter only came to light in the course of the tribunal itself. The Industry and Commerce file there- fore purported to show that the representa- tions about rejecting oe from other companies had not been made, and that, on the day on which Halal had its cover withdrawn, Goodman’s application was $103 million larger than it had actually been. These changes take on an added po- litical significance in the light of Mr O’Malley’s statement that the letter and the earlier meeting constitute the genesis of the entire policy pursued by Mr Reynolds. At the same time, Mr O’Malley also strengthened his implicit criticism of Mr Reynolds’s wider mers of granting huge amounts of cover for the Iraqi market. Mr Gleeson put it to him that Government decisions often work out very badly and that it is easy to make accusations with hindsight. Mr O’Malley, however, replied that “the circumstances in which these events took place were not just bad luck. .. because they never had any chance of succeeding.” He subsequently described the whole af- fair as a “fairly disastrous experience”’. This seems to rule out any possibility that Mr O’Malley might accept a conciliatory version of the events — that Mr Reynolds’s decisions, while they subsequently proved to be wrong, were reasonable at the time they were taken. ost of the day’s cross-examination was taken up with Mr Gleeson’s attempts to show that Mr O’Malley offered a “mir- ror-image”’ of his own accusations against Mr_ Reynolds, exhibiting Pa itical disfavour” rather than “political favourit- ism”. Mr O’Malley, he said, was “‘pro-risk but not pro-Goodman risk” and a man who “would lose no opportunity for a gratuitous swipe at the Goodman organisation”. Much of his counter-argument was taken up with attempting to show that Mr O’Malley’s decision to void the cover given to Goodman International was wrong, though he did not dispute that 38 per cent of the beef was processed outside the State, and admitted that the shipments were “not properly declared”. ince, however, Mr Justice Hamilton twice stated that he would not be deciding on the legality of that decision, which is the subject of a massive High Court civil dam- ages case, none of this will have an effect on the outcome of the tribunal. Perhaps Mr Gleeson’s strongest point otherwise was his reference to an Industry and Commerce memo of December, 1989, which says that, as Minister, Mr O’Malley had decided to bring Iraq back on cover for non-food exports unless there was a com- pelling reason not to. Mr O’Malley, however, said that the amounts in contemplation were of the order of £% million (as opposed to the £250 million which Mr Reynolds sanc- tioned for Iraq) and that he listened to advice from his officials (who had also op- posed Mr Reynolds’s policy) and decided not, in fact, to restore cover. The memo did suggest, nevertheless, that Mr O’Malley did not have an overwhelming moral objection to doing business with Saddam Hussein. _ It was also notable that the two princi- ples which Mr Gleeson cited in order to question the wisdom of Mr O’Malley — who had been involved in controversy about Goodman, taking a decision as Min- ister about the company in 1989 — might be equally applicable to the situation of the Fianna Fail government in 1987. The principle that no one should act in a matter in which he or she has a stake might well be relevant to the issue of con- tributions to political parties; and the prin- ciple that justice must not merely be done but be seen to be done (“the very appear- ances are important’) might well apply to the keeping secret of the “managed policy”. Perhaps the greatest political. signifi- cance of Mr Gleeson’s cross-examination, which has now concluded, other than Mr O’Malley’s statement about the genesis of Mr Reynolds’s policy, may well lie in the fact that it has contradicted none of the three politically important statements made by Mr O’Malley on Monday, all of which have serious consequences for Mr Reynolds’s position. — In nine hours and over 400 questions and statements, Mr Gleeson did not deny that 38 per cent of the beef was not pro- cessed within the State; did not deny that intervention beef was used (even though Mr O’Malley invited him to do so by say- ing that “beef that came out of interven- tion certainly wouldn’t have any positive effect on cattle prices”); and did not main- tain that Goodman companies had signed contracts on all occasions that they were ranted cover. These issues, therefore, are ikely to remain very much on the table for ° Mr Reynolds. ” . Officials when Tribunal told of contract THE only matter relevant to the contractual relationship on export credit insurance between the Minister for Industry and Commerce and Goodman Inter- national was the contract, the proposal form, the policy itself and the declarations signed by the company, Mr Desmond O’Malley told the tribunal yes- terday, when discussing the voiding of the policy. Under cross-examination on the sourcing of beef for export contracts, the Minister stated that Goodman International in the declaration undertook to use — beef from the Republic of Ireland when the company’s financial controller wrote to the Insurance Corporation of Ireland on February 18th, 1988. Mr Dermot Gleesan- SC, for Goodman International, ques- tioned +the Minister, about the definitions, of what,was Irish. He quoted a previous witness at the tribunal, Mr Ted O’Reilly, a - former assistant secretary in the nga as having defined it as . both North and South. Mr O’Reilly had drawn up cee to this effect pub- ished in November, -1987, by the Department to the ICI in respect of the operation of the export credit insurance scheme. ere was a meeting of Department the guidelines were drawn up. The Minister said he failed to relevance could be attached to a meeting of Department officials. Mr Gleeson said they had the happy conjunction of Mr O'Reilly having negotiated the contract with the Goodman organisation and the same official sending the uidelines to the ICI, advising ow these insurance policies should be interpreted. Mr O’Malley replied that Mr O’Reilly had only discussed with the Goodman organisation some of the “‘non-fundamental variable terms”. Mr O’Reilly had not discussed with Mr Goodman whether there would be permis- sion to use Irish or non-Irish beef. Mr Gleeson stated that Mr O’Reilly’s evidence to the tribu- nal had stated to the contrary. He had said that in 1986 the Border should be ignored for beef and cattle and he carried that understanding through in negotiations, for which he re- ceived the Minister’s approval. Mr O’Malley said that he had seen the memo of the 1986 meeting but did not see what relevance it had. Mr Gleeson said that the guidelines stated that goods or services could have a 60 per cent foreign input in the gross value of the contract and that 40 per cent should be Irish. For a comprehensive policy, goods and materials should “as far as possible’’ be sourced in Ireland using only Irish labour. The Minister said he had never seen this definition before. Mr Gleeson asked if he could take it that the Minister made the decision to void the policy without seeing this document. The Minister replied: “It forms no part of the policy whatsoever, Mr Gleeson, as |! am sure you well know. These are administrative guidelines for officials in insurance com- panies.” Mr O’Malley stated that it was an internal document between the Minister and his agents and had no bearing on the Minister’s contractual relationship with some outside party. He under- stood that the reference to 40 per cent was to goods which were finally assembled in Ireland, as had been specified in EC definitions. The Minister said that one of the confusions. which Mr Gleeson was labouring under was that he was equating beef and cattle as the same thing, which they were not. r Gleeson stated that Mr O'Reilly had said they were the same. “lf Mr O'Reilly said that, he was wrong because they are not, not By a long shot,” said the Minister. Mr Gleeson then read out a vassage from the _ tribunal transcript of Mr O’Reilly’s evi- see what dence, giving the witness’s reasons for taking the view of his definition of Irish beef. The Minister replied that Mr O’Reilly was — entitled to his point of view. “He did mention that he was influenced by the. thinking at the time, including the Anglo-Irish Agree- ment. That might be commend- able politically and socially, but it does not cut any ice as-far as I’m concerned and, hopefully, the law is concerned.”’ He said that he thought Mr O’Reilly was making an error by confusing beef and cattle. Beef was processed; the line had to be drawn somewhere. “We do not intend to cover anything that was slaughtered and processed outside the juris- diction,” stated Mr O’Malley. The Minister said that the proposal form for the insurance contract related to Ireland and excluded the Six Counties. When Mr Gleeson again re- ferred to the guidelines, Mr Henry Hickey SC, for the Attor- ney General and all State agencies, which would include r O’Malley in his capacity as Minister, stated that Mr Gleeson ° should put it to the Minister that in the’-agreement with the ICI Ireland was defined as being the 26 counties. ; Mr Gleeson was only giving half the story, and it was not fair to the Minister. Mr Justice Hamilton said that he was sure the Minister could take care of himself. Mr O’Malley stated that he was very much indebted to Mr Hickey as he had not: known that, but if Ireland was defined in the ICI agreement as the 26 counties, “‘then that’s it’’. Mr Gleeson said that in 1986 there was a Ministerial decision that Northern Ireland beef or cattle could be included. Mr O’Malley said that the statement presupposed that there was a decision, and he was not clear what it was about. However, what happened in 1986 had no relevance. . Counsel asked why he did not consult Mr O’Reilly, the man who had negotiated the contract and drawn up the guidelines, when he was making the deci- sion about voiding the contract. Mr O’Melley said that Mr O’Reilly’s name did not appear on the policy or the proposal. The Minister stated that a very “tees deal hung on the case in inancial terms, and he was loath to make pronouncements which could be used in the High Court but “even if Mr O'Reilly had fe to me, or any officials, the views he expressed in the tribunal on that day, it would not have affected the decision made because it seems to me that the views Mr O’Reilly expressed in 1986 were not rele- vant and did not form part of the contract.” Dispute over policy THE “genesis” of the managed policy to provide cover to Goodman International and Hibernia Meats over other meat exporters to Iraq had its origins in a meeting between Mr Good- man and the present Taoiseach, Mr Reynolds, ‘on ‘November 13th, 1987, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr O’Malley, told the beef tribunal yesterday. It was the first time in_ his three days of evidence that Mr O’Malley has mentioned the Taoiseach by name or assigned to him personally the go pon bility for the selection of two companies to benefit from the renewed export insurance cover. Mr O’Malley’s statement arose out of a dispute he had with Mr Dermot Gleeson SC, for Good- man International, over the origins of the managed policy — that is, selecting one or two companies from the meat indus- try to benefit exclusively from insurance cover to boost exports. r Gleeson put it to Mr O'Malley that various reports by independent consultants, such as the Telesis report, and by State- sponsored agencies such as the conomic and Social Research Institute, had argued that sup- port should be given to large = f bg?

Detailed reports were compiled by Sean MacConnell, Padraig Yeates and Christine Newman. Mr Reynolds: named at tribunal and the company was told at 4 pm. The thrust of all these events and Goodman International was the contract, the proposal form, the policy itself and the declarations signed by the company. The Minister stated that Goodman International in declaration undertook to use only Ireland when the company’s financial controller wrote Insurance Corporation of on February 18th, 1988.

Mr Gleeson suggested that the adoption of a selective policy was in line with these reports and that his client’s group of companies was “exactly within the criteria set out by these consultants’ reports’. Mr O’Malley countered by saying that Telesis also empha- sised the dangers of selectivity, which could give rise to all kinds of undemocratic and arbitrary decisions. It called for State support to be given to _ those companies which could benefit from it, rather than simply the largest operators in es sector. ‘““My belief is that the history and circumstances surrounding the managed policy doesn’t have its genesis in Telesis and Departmental reviews and the ESRI, because none of these deals with ECIS or managed policies,’ Mr O’Malley said. “The managed policy had its — at a meeting on Novem- r 13th, 1987, when your client came back from Ba hdad after he found there might competi- tion and met Mr Reynolds.’ Mr Goodman had already ex- pressed the view in correspon- dence that there should be “‘a single voice” in Baghdad, and the Minister should reject sundry applications for aid from others. r Goodman had ob-tained £30 million worth of cover on November 13th, 1987. As a result Agra, “pencilled in with an allocation,” were “put out”, Mr O'Malley said. Halal, which had been told it was receiving cover, had had it withdrawn, Mr O’Malley added, after advice had been obtained from the Attorney General. Documentation showed that the decision to exclude Halal had been made at 2.30 pm on November 27th, 1987, and the yore was told at 4 pm, Mr O’Malley said. The thrust of all these events supported the view that a managed policy had been adopted. r Gleeson made further efforts to show that the policy aps by the Government in 1987 was endorsed by various reports in his cross-examination of Mr O’Malley, but the chair- man of the tribunal, Mr Justice Hamilton, said that the Report on Industrial Performance, 1890, > seemed to support Mr O’Malley’s contention that policy should not be directed towards “picking winners’ but companies that could benefit from State support. Mr O’Malley said that the chairman’s summary was more in line with the general thrust of policies than ‘“‘some of the selective quotes being made”’. Minister rejects claim THE Progressive Democrat leader, r Des O’Malley, rejected claims by counsel for Goodman International, Mr Dermot Gleeson SC, that he was ro-competition and _ pro-risk ‘but not pro-Goodman risk’’ during sharp exchanges at the beef tribunal yesterday. Mr O’Malley, who was begin- ning his third day of evidence to the tribunal, said that ‘‘as far as any suggestions or allegations go that I was antagonistic to your Client, the facts don’t bear that out. I recall that in August, 1990, your client’s group of companies got into serious difficulties and were more or less_ insolvent. They owed a large number of bank debts of £550 million that ~— could not meet.” e situation had been precipi- tated by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, Mr O’Malley added, and normally a company in such a position would have been put into liquidation straight away. In this instance, however, he had the Dail recalled on August 28th and the Senate a few days later to put through a Bill which had Originally been part nine of the 1990 Companies Bill (and became the Companies Amend- ment Act, 1990). The Dail had only been recalled on two or three occasions in the past to pass legislation in a summer recess, Mr O’Malley added. “I believe it showed every good will to your group when they were in the most need.” Mr Gleeson put it to Mr O’Malley that one of the reasons that his client had been vulner- able at that time was that their export cover had been voided. “The critical factor was the invasion of Kuwait’’, Mr O’Malley replied. “The policy was voided on legal grounds” he added, referring to the fact that the Goodman group had used meat sourced outside of the Republic for its Iraqi sales. arlier Mr Gleeson had asked why there was so much empha- sis on the beef sector when the main companies in the pork and lamb sectors had a similar 35 per cent share of the market. (Mr Gleeson stressed that he was not Suggesting there were any prob- lems in either of these sectors). He went on to quote Mr O’Malley speaking against a Fine Gael private member’s Bill that sought to limit the share of any company in.any section to 30 per cent economic activity of the market. In reply Mr O’Malley said that he accepted some of the prin- ciples of the Fine Gael Bill but not that the 30 per cent principle Should apply to all sectors of the economy. There were some sec- tors, cement production for example, where one producer had 100 per cent of the market. He felt the two criteria that had to be considered were how large a company needed to be to compete successfully abroad, and whether a company which had a dominant position was abusing it. The Competition Act, 1991, said this and reflected mutatis mutandis Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome. Mr Gleeson also sought to show from the Dail record that Mr O’Malley had been selective in citing the Goodman group adversely during Dail debates. On one occasion the Ceann Comhairle had had to intervene twice during a debate when Mr O’Malley criticised the Goodman group. Mr O’Malley said that he felt he observed the rules about not naming parties outside the chamber who might not be in a position to respond “‘as least as much as most deputies.” He added that it was impossible to discuss contemporary affairs without at least referring in limited circumstances to indi- viduals and companies outside. He was sure that if Mr Gieeson went through the Dail record he would find frequent a interventions by the Ceann Comhairle over statements by other deputies. When pressed by Mr Gleeson to name another company he had commented on adversely, Mr O’Malley said that a com- pany “mentioned regularly and incessantly” in the Dail in recent months had been UMP. Frau claim queried THE Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr O’Malley, refused to withdraw his allega- tions, made in the Dail, that the use of beef from outside the Republic of Ireland in shipments to Iraq under the export insur- ance scheme constituted a fraud on the Irish taxpayer. He had been called upon to do so repeatedly by counsel for Goodman International, Mr Dermot Gleeson SC, yesterday afternoon at the end of three days of intense cross- examination. Mr Gleeson argued that the total amount of beef sourced in the Republic of Ireland met the level of cover given by the Government. He also Mr O’Malley that beef sourced outside the Republic, that is in Northen Ireland, England, Scot- land and Wales, should be covered by export insurance under the principles of EC law on competition and the harmon- isation of export risks. There was no basis for the allegation Mr O’Malley had made that the inclusion of Northern Ireland beef constitu- ted fraud on the taxpayer, Mr Gleeson said, when the amount of Republic of Ireland beef exceeded the cover given by the State. The declaration purported that all the beef was Irish, Mr O’Malley said, and he didn’t think that Mr Gleeson’s clients were entitled to claim at all under the policies because there had been such a fundamental breach of the conditions on which the insurance cover had been granted. ut it to. The contention of fraud was “‘unsustainable’’, Mr Gleeson continued, on the basis of the veterinary certificates issued, which clearly showed the source of the beef. “It is well known to your clients that the source of a good bit of the beef was other than from the Republic of Ireland,” Mr O’Malley said. “Why did they make a declaration that every last bit of it came from the Republic of Ireland?”’ t was “unsustainable and pro- foundly damaging”’ to his clients to make the allegation that there was fraud in this case, Mr Gleeson insisted. “I invite you to withdraw it.” | “The obtaining of cover in these circumstances in respect of very substantial non-Irish beef was clearly something that was fraudulent because the declara- tion was wrong”, Mr O’Malley said. Mr Gleeson told Mr O’Malley that what he had done was “a mirror-image of the accusations ou. have made against others. y clients have become victims of political disfavour” and “of a controversy not of their making’’, Mr Gleeson said. Mr O’Malley said that Mr Gleeson’s clients were victims of their own actions and had at all times been treated as any other company would have been in the same situation. Earlier Mr Gleeson had sought to show that EC directives pre- vented discrimination against member-states in the area of export insurance. If his clients had subcontracted the supply of beef to UK suppliers they should not have lost their cover, and he accused the Minister of not being aware of the fundamental principles of EC law in this area. Mr O’Malley said that he was aware of bilateral agreements between individual EC member- States to provide for such arrangements but he did not accept that “Country A is obliged to cover the goods of Country B”’. He had been seek- ing agreement at EC level to establish such a system but there had been resistance from larger member-states which were fear- ful of having to pay out large sums. Mr Gleeson put it to the Minister that member-states were obliged to “take in other people’s washing” in this area. “I don’t take in other people’s washing and I don’t see them taking in mine”, Mr O’Malley replied. Credit issue raised MR O’MALLEY denied that he had sought to “become judge and jury” over the operations of export credit to the Goodman group of companies when he accepted the job as Minister for Industry and Commerce follow- ing negotiations with Mr Charles Haughey in 1989. He accepted, during cross- examination by Mr Dermot Gleeson, SC, that he had been a protagonist while in opposition and had sought information about the level of exposure to debt from the Iraq cover. But he refused to accept that when he voided cover for the export credit for the Goodman companies it was not a neutral decision because of his earlier stand on the matter. The decision to withdraw cover had been taken only after careful consideration and follow- ing advice from the Attorney General, senior counsel not attached to the AG’s office and Department officials, he said. e added that he had not brought the matter to Govern- ment and was not aware that any member of the Government dis- sented. He got the impression that they supported him. The Minister said that there were good and valid reasons why the cover had been re- moved. The policies would not have been voided if the meat involved had been sourced in the Republic of Ireland. e decision to void cover was a judicial one, he said. He said it may have been unfortu- nate from Mr Gleeson’s client’s point of view, but the decisions taken were valid ones Mr O’Malley had earlier dealt with an internal memo. which had been circulated through his Department in December 1989, which stated that he, the Minis- ter, had decided to restore export credit facilities for non- food manufactured goods to ~— r QO’Malley said that, al- though the memo had stated that he had taken the decision to restore export credit facilities to the non-meat area, he had not done so. ‘Swipe’ at client alleged THE Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr Desmond O’Malley, was accused by coun- sel for Goodman International of “losing no opportunity for taking a gratuitous swipe” against the Goodman organisation and tak- ing the opportunity to give an answer which was destructive to his client’s reputation. Mr Gleeson asked Mr O’Malley if he did not agree that it had been shown that, if a number of companies were allowed into a market, then the prices fell, and this was detrimental to the Irish farmer. The Minister replied that Mr Gleeson made the assumption that if a beef-processor got a high price then the whole of that rice was passed on to the Irish armer. However, he saw no evidence of that, and there was no justification for what he was Saying. e said that the higher price was profit and it did not neces- sarily go to farmers. That profit went to the beef-processor, and he could use it for whatever pape he wanted. He did not ave to go to the farmer and say that he had made a real killing in Iraq and would give it to IFA members. Minister recalls Speech AN IRISH ambassador who had regarded his embassy as “the house of the President of Ireland” would not allow it to be “sullied with talk of trade’, the beef tribunal was told yesterday. Mr O’Malley, Minister for Industry and Commerce, was responding to a question from Mr Dermot Gleeson SC, for Goodman International. Mr Gleeson was contrasting Mr O’Malley’s critical attitude towards the use of diplomatic bags from Iraq to facilitate the Goodman group during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait with a = he had made in 1977 uring which he had called for a broadening of diplomatic repre- sentation to give a better com- © mercial service to the private sector. Mr O’Malley recalled that he had become Minister for Indus- try and Commerce four or five months before he made the speech. He had been approached by the Industrial Development Authority to seek the use of an Irish embassy for a function to promote Irish goods. He had raised the matter with. Foreign Affairs and word had gone back to the IDA from the ambassador concerned that he regarded ‘his house as the house of the President of Ireland and he didn’t want it sullied with talk of trade”’. He had later raised the matter with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and both had agreed this was not the correct approach. Legal counsel who addressed the tribunal yesterday were Mi Dermot Gleeson SC, for Goodman International, and Mr Henry Hickey SC, for the Attorney General and all State agencies, including Mr O’Malley in his capacity as Minister for Industry and Commerce. THE IRISH TIMES, Thursday, July 2, 1992 HOME NEWS 5 Murp “OUR Government’s role at this moment of opportunity must: surely be to promote peace rather than pursue a territorial impera- tive,” Professor John A.

Professor Murphy, who was speaking before the Minister for oreign Affairs, Mr Andrews, an- nounced the transition to Strand Two of the talks, said later that he did not believe that a referen- dum on the subject would be divisive. The people in the South were only too relieved that they had been spared the situation in the North. “Compromise is inevitable from all sides,” he said. “The unionists must consider some Irish dimen- sion and -the nationalists must accept that Articles 2 and 3 simply have no place in the scheme of peaceful things. ‘““Backbenchers who indulge themselves in irredentist fantasies must be prepared for the inevitable historic compromise. After all, we have been assuring the unionists for years that they would be surpri by our gener- osity once we sat down at the table, and that day has finally dawned. “As for Sinn Fein, their place at the table can only be prepared when they unequivocally renounce the IRA campaign, and then only in proportion to their electoral strength in Northern Ireland.” Professor oma A paid tribute to the President, Mrs Robinson, whose contribution to reconcili- ation was “immeasureable.”’ And the very presence of Dr Ian ; * ne Se ae Seen cats PPoatare se ee earch teh ” ~ Professor John A.

He was answering a point. raised by Fine Gael’s spokesman on justice, Mr Dan Neville, who called for the abolition of such arb which, he said, was particu- arly “silly and inappropriate when women are for to wear what is essentially male onl Mr O’Dea said that, following some 12 years’ practice as a barrister himself, he was more than aware of the anxiety and nervousness with which poops approached the courts. He be- lieved these feelings were com- pounded by the attire worn by judges and lawyers. “If I can at least make the courts more user-friendly in my tenure of office, I will consider that I have succeeded in no small yy he said. O’Dea pointed out that the matter had also arisen in the course of the Bill’s passage thro the Dail. He had con- sulted the Bar Council, which had told him that it was carrying out a review of the matter. He had told the Bar Council and the Dail — and was again repeating it — if they did not come forward with ro by the end of the year, is Office would have to take steps to alter, or maybe totally change, the relevant court rules. It was his opinion and that of “every shade of political grou ing” that the wearing of 17th- century dress was no_ longer appropriate to the modern condi- tions of Irish courts. Mr O’Dea said that such “paraphernalia” was not worn in vacation sittings, which were often very busy. Neither was it worn in family law cases. There was no evidence that the interests of justice were damaged. In fact, he said, all the available eviden suggested the contrary. . Solicitors did not wear such garments in the district courts, and their absence in no way —- the procedure of the aw. The Bar Council had put foreard ‘‘somewhat spurious arguments” that such clothing was mecessary to ensure that discrimination would not be per- .ceived between barristers earnin £200,000 a year — who coul afford to dress better. — as against those who were only earning £200. Mr O’Dea described the Bill, which passed all stages, as a landmark piece of legislation which represented a fundamental change in the law. It amends the law of evidence in criminal cases in several . These include making certain documents, including computer print-outs, admissible in evidence. The Bill makes it easier for witnesses to give evidence in cases involving violence or, sexual abuse. It sets out the law about the competences and compellability of spouses and former spouses of accused persons and permits unsworn evi- dence to be given by persons under 14 or those who are men- tally handicapped. It also abolished the present obligatory warning given to juries by a trial judge about the danger of convicting on the evidence of a child, leaving the uttering of such a warning to the trial judge’s discretion. . Opportunity now to make a new beginning, says Andrews “ON BEHALF of the Govern- ment, I greatly welcome the pro- posal by Sir Patrick Mayhew this afternoon that Strand Two should now be launched, and the reported ar oo of this pro- ed by all concerned,” the inister for Foreign: Affairs, Mr Andrews, announced in the Seanad. “We are very pleased that this crucial phase as now been » Mr Andrews said in the course of a debate on a private member’s motion on Northern Ireland. “We have the chance, with imagination and goodwill, to start building a basis for an honour- able, mg and lasting accommodation between the two traditions. We have the oppor- tunity for a new beginning that can help signal the end to the strife that -has caused so much suffering and hardship to the le of Northern Ireland.” r Andrews said that he would be misleading the House if he said the Government was certain of success or that the task ahead would be an easy one. The dis- cussions would be complex and ‘**However’’, he went on, “once launched the process of dialogue will, I hope, acquire its own momentum. re is, I be- lieve, a growing acceptance that political dialogue alone offers a way out of the tragedy of North- ern Ireland.” The Government firmly be- lieves that “a new beginning of relationships” must address all ‘the ‘different dimensions, he said.” “It must be grounded on respect for the aspirations and sense of identity of each tradition. Both are entitled to equal measure. Both involve allegiances that transcend the confines of Northern Ireland, and no real or durable accommodation is pos- sible unless framed in the context of the wider dimension of rela- tionships within Ireland and be- tween the two islands. “In accepting this reality as the basis for talks, I believe all sides have already taken a signifi- cant step. “As confirmed in Article One of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, both governments have fully accepted that the aspirations of each tradition are legitimate and both must be accommodated. The fundamental basis of the present talks is the need to divise institu- tions that can accommodate each tradition and take full account of their legitimate aspirations.” It, was central to this' approach that neither tradition should be placed in a position of privilege or special status against the other, he said. “We must base our negoti- ations on the conflicting aspira- tions and identities as each tradi- tion itself perceives and defines them, not in the form the other tradition might find it convenient for them to be. We must make our solution fit the problem, not seek to define it in terms of the solutions we are prepared to offer. “Our roach to the agenda will Faron ore od = aa com nsive. of the agree ween rules is that the talks will open to each of the parties to raise an of our relation- ships, including constitutional issues — Or any matters con- sidered relevant.” Mr Andrews concluded that there’ was much to build on and much on which all sides already agreed. The House adjourned until 10.30 this morning. Molloy accepts Sellafield demand THE GOVERNMENT agreed, in the Dail last night, to an Opposi- tion demand that legal action be considered to prevent an extension to Sellafield going ahead at the end of the year. In a surprise develop- ment, the Minister for Energy, Mr Molloy, said the Governmnent would accept a Labour Party mo- tion which called for legal advice on the matter. On Tuesday night, when debate on the motion opened, Mr Molloy indicated that legal action was not practicable. Although Greenpeace had provided copies of two separate legal opinions, neither of them, on examination by the Attorney-Gen- eral’s office, provided hope that im- mediate _ action could be taken, the Minister said. The motion which the Govern- ment accepted last night also called for a campaign every possible forum,” including the pean Parliament and the Anglo-Irish Conference, with th e object of securing the closure of the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant. Consensus over talks THE TAOISEACH, Mr Reyn- olds, described as *Tuesday’s meeting in Lon- don which brought together union- ist leaders and Government ministers. But he stressed, during question time, that one of the con- ditions of the talks process was that confidentiality would be ob- served by all parties. There was an all-party consen- sus when Mr Reynolds was asked about the talks. He pledged to keep the opposition leaders in- formed confidentially of the progress being made, from time to time. | The Fine Gael deputy leader, Mr Peter Barry, said that progress on all three strands was essential. While Tuesday’s meeting was im- portant, the relationship between all people on this island was very important. The leader of Democratic Left, Mr Proinsias De Rossa, congratu- lated all the parties who that par- ticipated in the London talks. It was of the utmost importance that the process continued, regardless of how long it might take, he said. Mr Reynolds said he did not ‘think that anybody, or any of the parties concerned in so far as he , was aware, doubted the good faith . of the Irish Government in relation to the talks. ‘6 “= DAIL REPORT By Dermot Kelly and Michael O’Regan Minister refuses to put time limit on Shannon decision THE MINISTER for Tourism and Transport, Mrs Geoghegan- Quinn, refused to put a time- frame on the making of a decision on the future of the Shannon stopover. _ Responding to the Fine Gael spokesman on transport, Mr Ivan Yates, she said that whatever de- cision was made would have to last for a number of years. That was one of the requests made to her by the interests concerned, and she intended to respect it. She turned down a suggestion from Mr Yates to have an in- dependent study made of the issue. She said she did not think it would be helpful in adding to the debate. Replying to Mr Eric Byrne (DL, Dublin South Central) she de- fended her decision to write to the chairmen of three semi-state boards — Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta and Bord Failte — asking them not to make public pronounce- ments on the controversy and to discipline staff who did so. It was a matter of concern, she said, that at a time when the Gov- ernment was faced with making a decision these bodies should be responsible for taking up public positions and contradicting each other’s aims. The debate must be conducted calmly and not “by megaphone”’. The decision would ultimately rest with the Govern- ment, she added. Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn: any decision on Shannon will have to last a number of years. Mr Yates said that the Minis- ter’s ban smacked of the kind of action taken in the former eastern European countries. Aer Lingus had lost £100 million and was en- titled to make its views known. Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn said that the loss was not attributable to the Shannon stop. Mr Jim Kemmy (Lab, Limerick East) suggested that the Minister ' publish a position paper setting out the arguments on the issue. Mrs egan-Quinn said she was not sure that would add any- thing to the debate. Mr Eric Byrne said that the Minister was gagging the workers in the three semi-state companies and was infringing their civil rights. Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn said that since the restriction was im- posed on public pronouncements there had been a calm debate be- tween the interests concerned and her Department. Earlier, Ms Madeline Taylor- Quinn (FG, Clare) was suspended from the House after clashing with the Ceann Comhairle (Mr Sean Treacy) over being excluded from the questions dealing with the Shannon stop. The questions were listed as “priorities”, and Mr Treacy said under the rules only the deputy who had tabled the questions could put supplementary ques- tions to the Minister. Ms Taylor- Quinn demanded to be told how she could raise the issue, and when she persisted Mr Treac requested her suspension. She le after a motion to suspend her was passed without a vote. Cabinet THE MINISTER for Transport and Tourism, Mrs Geoghegan- Quinn, assured the House that there was no difference between her and the Taoiseach, Mr Reyn- olds, over the future of rural sub- post offices. She was asked by the Fine Gael communications spokesman, Mr Austin Currie, about an interview in which Mr Reynolds was quoted as saying that the closure of sub-post offices as proposed in An Post’s viability plan was “not on his agenda.” Mrs Geoghegan- Quinn said she could not com- ment on media reports. An Post division on rural post offices denied was in serious financial trouble and there was an urgent need to implement proposals to restore it to financial health. The settle- ment of the postal dispute en- abled the company to proceed with the implementation of ‘its priority recovery proposals. An Post was negotiating with the unions about its remaining pro- posals, excluding those relating to the closure of sub-post offices and the introduction of roadside let- ter-boxes. These matters were the subject of a report by consultants nominated by the NESC and ap- pointed by the previous Minister. pe a ‘““My examination of the report of the consultants who ‘studied the socio-economic implications for rural communities of those two proposals is continuing,” she said. The report would be pub- lished in due course. Mr Currie said he assumed there had been “some going back” on the proposals, and he hoped there was. He asked the Minister to state what alternative arrangements she had for An Post to resolve its financial problems. Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn repeated that the consultants’ report was being studied. _ A Flowers to New York? In When a Kerry company wanted to send fresh flowers to New York, guess who they turned to?
