These public events aimed to diversify approaches to the decade of commemoration, focusing intentionally on “women and the decade of commemorations” as a corrective to the national conversation at that point, seeking to showcase the scholarly and creative endeavors of women working in an Irish cultural context and to initiate discussion about their counterparts of a century ago. Finally, they aimed to consider the ways in which the decade of centenaries had the potential to limit discussion and debate about events and commemorations perceived to lie outside of its remit, from the ways in which women in the North of Ireland contributed to the revolutionary period to the rights afforded to women in contemporary Ireland. Scholars, writers, art practitioners, activists, and community workers attended and participated in a series of events throughout the year, generously funded by Maynooth University’s Commemorations Committee and the Research Office at Maynooth University. The Department of Foreign Affairs’ Peace and Reconciliation Fund’s support meant that we were able to offer funding to postgraduates, independent researchers, and artists from across the island of Ireland, allowing for crucial exchanges between early career researchers, artists, community workers, activists, and established voices from an all-Ireland perspective. I am also most grateful to the Irish Research Council for generous funding under its New Foundations scheme, which allowed for the expansion of the original program and afforded the university the opportunity to host preeminent scholars from around the world.

The period that this commemorative decade marks includes World War I, the Easter Rising, the Revolutionary War, and the start of the Civil War, key events that have all contributed to and shaped myths that form the basis of the Irish state and of Northern Ireland. The same foundational myths have also been at the genesis of various crises that both spaces have endured since, so they are at the core of contested memory in an Irish context. Because of this, this decade’s commemorations have been attended by much speculation and interest as to how, where, and with what perspective and consciousness events would be marked. As the island of Ireland approached a series of key centenaries in the 2010s, there was curiosity as well as concern about how the anniversaries would be commemorated: How would the marking of certain events by some groups avoid a celebratory tack that might be deemed offensive by others? What narratives would be promoted at national and all-island levels, and how would these conflict with or function alongside more local endeavors to commemorate? How would commemorations on this island relate to international commemorative contexts? The initial launch of the Irish government’s Decade of Centenaries program took place in 2012—early enough that voices immediately expressed concern that by the time key anniversaries would arrive the island would be in the grips of commemorative fatigue. The stated aims of the program, which in its initial iteration focused heavily on 1916, were to be “broad and inclusive,” encompassing “the different traditions on the island of Ireland and aim[ing] to enhance understanding of and respect for events of importance among the population\n\n1\n\n2\n\nWom en a n d t h e Deca de of Com m e mor ations\n\nas a whole” (Decade of Centenaries 2012a). The program would “foster deeper mutual understanding among people from different traditions on the island of Ireland” (ibid.); a real effort was made, at Irish and British government levels, to use the moment to further reconciliation efforts, signaled by meetings between then prime ministers Enda Kenny and David Cameron as well as by the Northern Ireland Executive’s commitment to oversee commemorations based on principles of “inclusivity, tolerance, [and] respect” (Decade of Commemorations 2012). The use of the term centenaries, rather than commemorations, signaled that it was a group of particular events that would be marked. Even when, as in the case of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly document cited above, the term commemorations was deployed, it was seen as being interchangeable with centenaries: “The Decade of Commemorations [is] also known as the Decade of Centenaries” (ibid.), the text begins. This kind of language indicated that official focus remained trained on major events such as the Battle of the Somme and the Easter Rising; under the program’s remit, there would not be consideration of other noncentennial commemorations such as, for instance, the twentieth anniversary of the last closure of a Magdalene laundry in 2016, or the fiftieth anniversary of the Troubles in 2019. The government program sought, instead, to explicitly illuminate events of one hundred years ago and, as was much noted, stopped short of including the Civil War’s conclusion by ending the official commemorative period in 2022. The Decade of Centenaries project also made clear the prominent role played by and granted to historians and the seriousness with which “the past” and “history” continue to be taken in an Irish context; the “expert group” appointed by the government to advise on its centenary plans was composed almost exclusively of historians.1 Significantly, the original membership of the expert group included only three women (of ten), later extended to four (of twelve); there was also only one committee member from Northern Ireland, and thus no attempt at gender balance in the Northern Irish representation.2 The pluralist and inclusive intentions thus stood at odds with some of the realities of the program’s oversight. As commemoration is an engagement with the past the performance of which informs us of the present, there is a sense in which these details tell particular stories, which have become more significant as the decade has worn on. The fact that the Decade of Centenaries will close before the centenary of the Civil War’s closure, for instance, reveals uncertainty about how to mark a period of “home-grown” conflict, one that continues to inform party politics on the island of Ireland and is profoundly marked by what Guy Beiner calls “goal-directed forgetting” (2018). These details also tell other stories, though,\n\nI n troduction\n\n3\n\nthat suggest what I call “oblivious remembering”—which I conceive of not in contrast to Beiner’s conceptualization of “goal-directed forgetting” but at a right angle to it. In 2012, when that initial expert group was formed, there was relatively little attention paid to its gender balance and not much public concern with the geographic spread of its representation; as we near the decade’s close, however, there is an atmosphere of increased awareness of what we might broadly call women’s issues in an Irish context, as well as an increasing uneasiness about what Brexit will mean for the future of Northern Ireland and the Republic’s border. There is also an acute consciousness of the need for broader and more inclusive representation in public and social life. As it was, the fact of the committee’s composition chimed with a broader “story” that had long been narrated and would be subsequently challenged by the multitude of commemorations of this decade. As the decade of commemorations moved into its crucial opening phase, what became apparent was that, while there were individual projects underway drawing attention to women’s roles in revolutionary Ireland—including by contributors to this volume—it was not a foregone conclusion that female experts in the contemporary moment would be involved in commenting on and analyzing Irish history and culture. This, I would argue, is because the Irish mnemonic context has long been marked by “oblivious remembering,” which I define as a form of remembrance that lacks awareness of or dismisses the systemic biases present in its institutional and/or official approaches to the past. Projects such as 77 Women at Richmond Barracks, an exhibition and community art project that remembered women arrested and held at the barracks in 1916, often stood in contrast to the exclusion of female experts from the public forum in which the Irish past was analyzed. A Royal Irish Academy (RIA) series of “six high profile public lectures” promisingly titled “1916 as a Global Event,” for instance, ran from early October 2015 to January 2016 and featured Professors Partha Chatterjee, Mark Finnane, Bill Nasson, and Jay Winter as well as journalist Fintan O’Toole.3 While the RIA was by that time under the stewardship of its first female president in the distinguished historian Mary Daly, this did not, of course, excuse the blatant imbalance of the program, which lacked even one female speaker; nor would it have been solely the president’s responsibility to take an entire organization to task for such programming. In response to not just the RIA’s program but also other events with similar blatant gender imbalances, “Academic Manel Watch Ireland” started on Twitter (in September 2016) in order to call public attention to conferences and events to which few women had been invited as speakers; within days almost 250 Irish female academics had listed their areas of expertise under a request to “alert organisers\n\n4\n\nWom en a n d t h e Deca de of Com m e mor ations\n\nof conferences/seminars/panels [that] you are a woman who is available to speak as a keynote & panelist” (October 8, 2016), since a common excuse was that event organizers did not know who to invite. Just as much historical focus on the women of revolutionary Ireland classed them as “exceptional” and out of the ordinary, it seemed that inclusion of female scholars as keynote speakers in the present and in certain places could also be “exceptional.” It is telling, however, that only a few months later, by February 2016, the kind of exclusion and oblivious remembering seen in the RIA’s program would no longer be tolerated: University College Dublin’s major public conference for the centennial year, “Globalising the Rising: 1916 in Context,” had a gender-balanced program that had nonetheless managed to engage “high profile” speakers;4 my own institution, Maynooth University, ran 2016 commemorative events that focused on women’s roles in the revolutionary period and their place in present-day Ireland.5 At least in part, this shift in atmosphere and expectation was due to Waking the Feminists, the response by female theater practitioners to the Abbey Theatre’s commemorative program for 2016, Waking the Nation. As a national institution, the Abbey’s artistic beginnings were clearly linked to the revolutionary period through its declared intentions to upend representations of the stage Irishman and to establish a national literary theater at a time when there was not yet, of course, a nation (see Maples 2011). The fledgling theater set out a stall for national drama with the production of plays like Lady Gregory and William Butler Yeats’s Cathleen Ni Houlihan (in 1902), which saw a sold-out series of performances by Maud Gonne electrify Dublin’s theatergoing population with a nationalist pitch that drew explicitly on the cultural memory of rebellion in Ireland. And, curiously, as an aspirational and then newly established nation sought to articulate a cultural and moral code of theater that distinguished itself from England’s, it was often the performance of Irish womanhood—woman’s virtue, role as symbol of the nation, role in the home—that became a site of debate and rupture. This was seen and the Abbey’s role in culture solidified only a few years into its tenure in the furor sparked by both J. M. Synge and Séan O’Casey’s plays. Synge’s Playboy of the Western World (1907) caused riots after his one-act drama In the Shadow of the Glen (1904–1905) had itself provoked a years-long war of words in national periodicals about the nature of Irish women following the lead character’s forced departure into the Wicklow wilderness: objecting that no Irish woman would leave her husband (and failing to observe that Nora was evicted), Arthur Griffiths was famously provoked to proclaim that “Irish women are the most virtuous in the world” (Hogan and Kilroy 1979, 116),\n\nI n troduction\n\n5\n\nwhile James Connolly claimed that “young Irish wives, even when found in loveless wedlock with old men, do not act in the manner . . . [of] Mr. Synge’s plot” (1904). Only a few years further on, O’Casey’s The Plough and the Stars saw Yeats, enraged, taking to the Abbey stage, berating the audience for having “disgraced themselves again” for their response to a play that challenged comfortable notions of nationalism—a response that saw some of the widows of 1916 join the protest. From its earliest years, the theater thus played an important role in representing Ireland, particularly to itself, with that representation in the early years often linked directly to the performance of Irish womanhood. Because of the place of the theater in Irish cultural history, there was a resulting strong expectation that the Abbey program would do justice both to that history and to the significance of the year. Launched on October 28, 2015, ahead of Ireland’s centennial year, the Abbey’s Waking the Nation program brought forth instead, however, an echo of Yeats’s admonition from the Abbey stage, this time directed at the theater itself: for the program excluded female playwrights and directors and enraged a community. The theater likely had little reason to suspect what was about to happen—its own centennial celebrations in 2004 had included the work of only one female playwright, Marina Carr, even excluding the work of theater founder Lady Gregory (Madden 2004). When reaction was surprised and furious that the only work by a woman included in the Waking the Nation program was a monologue for children by Ali White, the Abbey was forced to apologize and rethink its programming, announcing a series of events that became known as Waking the Feminists. The event triggered an international response and, as the important research of Brenda O’Connell in this volume attests (chapter 13), led not only to the short-term gatherings of Waking the Feminists on the Abbey stage but to significant and longer-lasting initiatives. As a result of Waking the Feminists, Ireland thus entered the key year of 2016 with a renewed consciousness of the role of women in commemoration and in Irish culture broadly conceived. The heated and sudden response provoked by the Abbey’s programming decisions made it apparent that there was an energy and a mood in the country that had shifted and that Irish citizens, particularly women, were in no mood for weak excuses when it came to gender equality. What the Waking the Feminists episode suggested for me was that the cultural memory of women in the Ireland of a century ago was irrupting in the present, with many asking questions of what the State—which had been founded on principles of equality—had actually managed to achieve when it came to women’s rights.\n\n6\n\nWom en a n d t h e Deca de of Com m e mor ations\n\nWom en a n d Ir ish Cu lt u r a l M e mory: Th e E x a m pl e of Y e ats’s “E a ster 1916” Closing in on one of the anniversaries most anticipated of all in this decade of commemorations, that of the Easter Rising, the island was thus furnished with an opportunity to reflect not just on history but on the larger notion of cultural memory in an Irish context and its implications for our present-day society. While there is a broad understanding of “history,” notions of “cultural memory” are less understood and also rarely tacked down. Cultural memory, as I have defined it elsewhere, is a form of “remembrance amongst social groups that manifests itself in multiple forms and relies upon acts of narration” (Frawley 2010, 18). In contrast—though not in opposition—to history, cultural memory involves a consideration of why and how we remember what we remember—and, on the other hand, why and how we forget, as Guy Beiner’s recent work documents (2018). Irish memory studies has developed rapidly in the past two decades, with a particular acceleration in recent years that shows no sign of abating. Frameworks and methodologies of memory studies have proven useful in an Irish social context still dealing with contested versions of the past, and at times when the past—whether colonial or postcolonial—seems to continue to intrude in the present. This was particularly the case in the context of the sesquicentenary of the Famine in the mid-1990s, with the advent of the Northern Ireland peace process and the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, and amid ongoing revelations of church and industrial school abuse. In addition to a slew of important publications, the establishment of the Irish Memory Studies Network in 2013 at University College Dublin helped draw the parameters of the field, which has continued to grow during this decade of commemorations (Beiner 2007, 2018; Frawley 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014; Pine 2010, 2020 among others). Ireland is thus intensely marked by memory in the present. The lead-up to the centenary of the Irish Civil War and the Brexit negotiations’ implications for Northern Irish identity and the Irish border mean that cultural memory continues to play a profound role in an Irish social context. What I refer to as Irish cultural memory is neither monolithic nor monumental; instead—like any body of cultural memory—it is shifting and changeable. We have seen, repeatedly, that attempts to control cultural memory from the top down, to impose a single narrative or interpretation of the past, are likely to fail: as Roisín Higgins’s work on the Easter Rising has convincingly demonstrated and as Guy Beiner’s work on 1798 so comprehensively shows, commemorative plans might be made and initiated, but control of the message\n\nI n troduction\n\n7\n\nor its interpretation is regularly impossible, as cultural memory is responsive and changes over time (R. Higgins 2012; Beiner 2007, 2018). Thus it becomes important to consider not only what official commemorative narratives are but the commemorative environment more broadly. What stories are we telling ourselves? Who is doing the telling, and who is included in those stories? Conversely, who is not speaking, and who is excluded? How, in this key period, is the past being narrated to us—and which “us” is being addressed? What audiences have these stories found and reached, and what are their sources? What forms of narration are being deployed, and in what forums? And, crucially, what are the social contexts into which these narrations are inserted? The essays in this volume all explore these questions. Commemorative practice is one of the most obvious lenses through which to view and gauge changes in cultural memory, since it is an opportunity to witness and observe memory performed. Cultural memory is a major determinant in how commemoration will be enacted; without the ongoing input of shifting cultural memory, commemorations would remain static and become irrelevant. Instead, what has tended to happen is that commemorative practice shifts and adapts to reflect the changing needs and aims of a given society, responding to politicized or other attempts to either support or suppress memory; in the latter case, memory can go underground, only to later reemerge as “forgetful remembrance” (Beiner 2018). The Easter Rising, one of the centerpieces of this decade of commemorations, met many of the conditions that scientific and social work on memory suggests makes an event memorable: it was unexpected by large segments of the population and gave way to great change; it involved considerable trauma and marked a watershed moment in individual lives as well as for the broad population who had not been directly involved but whose existence was shaped by its impact; it was a moment, arguably, that reflected a coming-of-age or emergence into self of the Irish State; and elements of its remembrance, particularly in relation to women, have been underground for most of the past century.6 The fact that the Rising operated on the basis of what Beiner calls “prememory” (2018) and what we might think of as a schemata of the memory of rebellion in Ireland meant that it drew additional strength from other events: it was itself, in a sense, a commemorative act, for the brave and all of the “dead generations” that Patrick Pearse described (Pearse 1915, 72). “Ireland,” as Guy Beiner has argued, “is deeply troubled by evocative memories of its past, not least 1916, which inhabits a mythic time and space reverberating with resonances that range far beyond the events of that year” (2007, 366). This meant that, in many ways, the Easter Rising was primed to become a “memory crux” at which the past would be debated and entered into dialogue\n\n8\n\nWom en a n d t h e Deca de of Com m e mor ations\n\nwith (Frawley 2014). Part of that ongoing attempt to enter into dialogue with the past is seen, viscerally, in 1916 commemorations. What has made the Easter Rising all the more memorable, of course, is the commemorative practice associated with it. Commemorations, like other ritual practices, are attuned to our cognitive needs and evolve to ensure their relevance and remembrance.7 By way of opening up the themes of this volume, I would like to consider a particular commemorative response to the Rising that manages to encapsulate some of the ways in which cultural memory functions. We have firsthand accounts of the Rising written from memory, but I want to look briefly at a text that manages to be at once a private memorial account of the Rising and its aftermath—a “personal” memory—and one that asserted itself as a public commemoration of the event and has become a “cultural” memory aligned with the sense of women’s roles in the revolutionary period and, by implication, in Irish culture. Yeats’s “Easter 1916,” I want to suggest, manages both to record a memorial response to a major historical event from the individual perspective and, in its transition into the public mind as a representation of that event, also comes to signify distinctions between memory and history, especially as they coalesce around the idea of women’s roles in Ireland. Significantly, Yeats was not in Dublin at the time of the Rising and had to make do with reading newspaper reports and awaiting correspondence from friends. Yeats wrote letters himself in response, expressing his “bewilderment” (to sister Lolly), and, ten days after the event, confessed that “I have been a good deal shaken by Dublin events—a world one has worked with or against for years suddenly overwhelmed. As yet one knows nothing of the future except that it must be very unlike the past” (in Foster 2003, 46). What becomes evident is that “Easter 1916” is a poem of memory. It was composed in retrospect, governed by the gaze of a man who needs to reassess his past understandings of people, place, and events now that the present had erupted so forcefully as to rend the continuum on which we think of ourselves as operating. Importantly, Yeats was also at a physical distance, so that, as he began to compose his mind, he was working with the memory of Dublin and not a series of images before his eyes. Just as when he composed “The Lake Isle of Innisfree,” Yeats gazes inward and backward to grasp at memory, to reinvent it: the poem intended as a memorial is written on memorial terms.8 Gradually moved to shock by the events that followed the Rising, Yeats drafted the poem within several weeks. If initially he deemed the Rising a “tragic business” that might interfere with the work of the Abbey Theatre (to Lady Gregory, April 27, 1916; Yeats 2002, InteLex 29349), he was moved to see\n\nI n troduction\n\n9\n\nthe Rising as something much bigger, primarily through correspondence with the two women who had profound influence on him at that time, Lady Gregory and Maud Gonne (see Pethica 2016). On May 11, he wrote to Lady Gregory: Cosgrave whom I saw a few months ago in connection with the Municiple Gallery project [sic] & found our best support has got many years imprisonment & to day I see that an old friend Henry Dixon—unless there are two of the name—who began with me the whole work of the literary movement has been shot in a barrack yard without a trial of any kind. I have little doubt there have been many miscarriages of justice . . . I see therefore no reason to believe that the delicate instrument of Justice is being worked with precision in Dublin. I am trying to write a poem on the men executed; “terrible beauty has been born again.” If the English conservative party had made a declaration that they did not intend to rescind the Home Rule Bill there would have been no rebellion. I had no idea that any public event could so deeply move me—& I am very despondent about the future. At the moment I feel that all the work of years has been overturned all the bringing together of classes, of the freeing of Irish literature & criticism from politics. (May 11, 1916; Yeats 2002, InteLex 2950)\n\nYeats’s letter to Gregory shows how his thinking of the Rising was enwrapped with his personal links to individuals and the effect of knowing people who were arrested and killed. He shows concern at the injustice of their mistreatment and execution and also believes that, had the House of Lords acted differently and not failed to sign the Home Rule Bill passed by the House of Commons in 1912, the entire rebellion could have been avoided; this is an explicit discussion of people and politics—a more extended discussion ensues in the letter about England’s situation in European politics—into which is embedded the poet’s own emotional response. Despite his ambivalence about the Rising’s necessity, he was at work on the poem within weeks, compelled to it. At this early stage he had a version of his refrain, though with a less active form of the verb—the present perfect “has been.” Yeats has already likened the impact of the Rising to that of a major life event—a birth, despite the fact that the event marked so much death—and has already settled on the key phrase “terrible beauty,” indicating that the poem will be not a celebratory commemoration but a complex and ambivalent one. When completed, the poem was privately printed10 and circulated among friends—a mere twenty-five copies were made, dated September 25, 1916. Compare this to the one thousand printed copies of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic and it becomes clear that the poem was intended initially as a relatively private document. “‘Easter 1916’ is an elegy,” Denis Donoghue\n\n10\n\nWom en a n d t h e Deca de of Com m e mor ations\n\nnotes, “a song of loss; as such, it is supposed to issue in a cry of sorrow for the dead. And so it does. But there is more in the poem than that cry, and some reluctance to utter it” (Donoghue 2018, 52). The reluctance is evident in the fact that Yeats refrained from offering it for publication for over three full years: a remarkable length of time. Yeats opted not to include the poem in the Irish edition of The Wild Swans at Coole (1917) as originally planned, and later declined to include it in the expanded English edition of that book in 1919 (Crotty 2016, 12; Yeats 1919). There are numerous prospective reasons for this holding back. There is the possibility, noted by many critics, that Yeats lacked the stomach for entering into the nationalist fray (see, for instance, R. Higgins 2012) or, more generally, the difficulties that he perceived in relation to the poet’s responsibility with regard to war (see Brearton 2000, 45–82). It is also feasible that Yeats recognized the ambiguities in the poem as potentially incendiary; and the fact that Gonne found it to be an inadequate response to the Rising may also have hit its mark. “No,” she wrote him, “I don’t like your poem, it isn’t worthy of you & above all it isn’t worthy of the subject” (November 8, 1916; Jeffares and White 2008, 333). A proper commemorative poem, for Gonne, would have been one that “our race would treasure & repeat” (November 8, 1916) and that contained as well the kind of emotive demand for action that Yeats and Gregory had—arguably naively enough—written into Cathleen the previous decade. The reluctance to publish the poem relented, as Patrick Crotty convincingly argues, only when the political situation in Ireland had worsened considerably: A decision finally to release the poem into the public domain had already been taken when Yeats made what Conor Cruise O’Brien called “probably the boldest [political act] of [his] career.” By October 1920 “Easter 1916” was scheduled for inclusion in Michael Robartes and the Dancer, which would be published, as planned, by the Cuala Press early in 1921. Yeats elected to bring his lyric’s debut forward, however, and to make an event of it, preferring a widely read British political journal to an Irish “slim collection” as the forum for the poem’s unveiling. In Ireland the War of Independence / Black and Tan War was approaching its climax in October 1920, as, in Britain, was the Brixton Prison hunger strike of the Lord Mayor of Cork, Terence MacSwiney. Yeats, along with Irish public opinion in general and liberal opinion in Britain, was deeply disturbed by the Black and Tan atrocities sanctioned as “reprisals” by the British Prime Minister David Lloyd George. (Crotty 2016, 12)\n\nWhen the poem was published, it appeared twice in close succession, first in the New Statesman on October 23, 1920, and then in The Dial in November\n\nI n troduction\n\n11\n\n1920. While Yeats is regularly remembered as among the more conservative of twentieth-century Irish writers, both of these periodicals were left-leaning: the New Statesman was, of course, founded by members of the socialist Fabian society (with George Bernard Shaw’s support) and had printed, six years prior to the publication of “Easter 1916,” Shaw’s lengthy essay, “Common Sense about the War” (1914)—which is as complex and multifaceted as Yeats’s poem in its approach to divisive issues. Shaw, observing an early reluctance to “talk and write soberly about the war,” begins by acknowledging that he had not “h[e] ld [his] tongue easily,” and that “my inborn dramatic faculty and professional habit as a playwright prevent me from taking a one-sided view even when the most probable result of taking a many-sided one is prompt lynching. Besides,” he continues, “until Home Rule emerges from its present suspended animation, I shall retain my Irish capacity for criticizing England with something of the detachment of a foreigner” (Shaw 1914, 3). While Yeats, even eighty years dead, would undoubtedly not appreciate the comparison to Shaw (and would likely banish me to the “objective” phase along with Shaw as a result), I think it worth noting that, in contrast, Yeats had less difficulty in holding his tongue but otherwise was, like Shaw, drawn in this case both to the “many-sided view” and to the critique. The New Statesman took care to publish this kind of work. “Easter 1916’s” first public outing here, at a delicate moment following the devastation of World War I, is pointed: it makes it impossible to read the poem as a simple nationalist text. Yeats’s poem appeared in an edition that included, “from a correspondent in Ireland,” an article on “The History of Reprisals,” as well as an essay on “The Pall of Indifference,” positioning his text among others that were taking politically left stances. The Dial, with its historical association with American transcendentalism, was, by 1920, a preeminent, radical, and modernist literary publication; it was similarly an unlikely venue for nationalist rhetoric, and the poem appeared in a volume with work by George Moore and T. S. Eliot, among others. These were not obvious venues for a commemorative poem marking the birth of a nation—and the poem’s placement in them by Yeats demonstrates “Easter 1916” ultimately refusing that position. It is only in subsequent years that the poem became an official kind of marker for the nationalist cause, with interpretations latching on to the refrain and certain lines and ignoring others—as, for instance, in its deployment in the 1966 commemorations, when the refrain only became part of an official program of events and served as the title of a commemorative poster distributed by a newspaper, depicting a burned-out General Post Office (GPO) with the words bannered above it. It is interesting that the refrain is focused on, since, of course,\n\n12\n\nWom en a n d t h e Deca de of Com m e mor ations\n\nrefrains exist to drive words and phrases into memory: Yeats uses the refrain to powerful memorial effect, even if with unintended results. One has only to google the phrase “a terrible beauty” to see the many iterations of the phrase in book titles, newspaper headlines, film names, documentaries, romance novels, and so on—it is a series of three words that have become inextricably linked to the Rising as an act and as the precipitator of a nation’s establishment, which is an extraordinary fate for any poem’s refrain but especially for one that took such an ambivalent position on what had happened. Yeats’s poem has thus stepped into the mythologies of the Rising. What this background shows is that while “Easter 1916” was not necessarily intended as an act of official national commemoration, its subsumption into commemoration and into broad cultural memory allows it to act in an official capacity and to perform some of the task of rewriting Ireland’s narrative. In such a process, Jenny Edkins notes, “deaths are retrospectively claimed by the nation” (2003, 95), and, since Yeats’s poem does elegize the dead, it is not difficult to see how the poem could be co-opted for nationalist purposes. The poem famously describes individuals—“that woman,” “this man,” “this other,” “this other man”—without naming names. The rebels are initially denied monikers, though notably it becomes possible to identify each individual because of the details supplied: That woman’s days were spent In ignorant good-will, Her nights in argument Until her voice grew shrill. What voice more sweet than hers When, young and beautiful, She rode to harriers? This man had kept a school And rode our wingèd horse; This other his helper and friend Was coming into his force; He might have won fame in the end, So sensitive his nature seemed, So daring and sweet his thought. This other man I had dreamed A drunken, vainglorious lout. He had done most bitter wrong To some who are near my heart, Yet I number him in the song; He, too, has resigned his part\n\nI n troduction\n\n13\n\nIn the casual comedy; He, too, has been changed in his turn, Transformed utterly: A terrible beauty is born. (Yeats 1997, 85–86, lines 17–40)\n\nIt is a curious tactic, because to withhold the names is to withhold the assignation of “hero” and defies traditional poetic commemorative tradition; the poem initially insists on a kind of anonymity, albeit one that can be deciphered by those in the know—though Yeats might have been aware of the movement, following World War I, to commemorate the “unknown soldier.” When Yeats finally names names, at the close of the poem, they become a roll call for memorialization and not for the rebellion more generally: some of the dead will be memorialized. Countess Markievicz, with her “ignorant good-will” and “shrill” voice, goes unnamed to the end, since she was not martyred through execution, and so her presence is an absence; she is consigned by the poem to an explanatory footnote. This elision of Markievicz’s name chimes with the general sense of how the Rising came to be held in cultural memory for the best part of the century, as an overwhelmingly male rebellion, an act of machismo in line with other such nationalist acts that had failed in preceding centuries. Markievicz’s unnaming—her oblivious remembrance—echoes, of course, the photoshopping of Elizabeth O’Farrell out of the famous photo of the surrender with Pearse in what has become an oft-repeated symbolic example of the ways in which women have been removed from the frame of the Irish past. The century’s pattern of thought about the Rising would not have changed, necessarily, had Yeats thought fit to include a woman’s name among his roll call of national heroes; the absence of any women’s names did indicate, however, the way in which memory would function in relation to the event. Markievicz is not absent from Yeats’s version of 1916, or entirely absent from earlier histories of Ireland—just as Elizabeth O’Farrell’s feet remained in the original image of surrender. But Markievicz’s presence is codified in certain ways: through that unnaming and through a characterization that undermines her womanhood by stressing the change that her nationalist commitment has wrought—she is no longer young or beautiful, no longer in possession of a “sweet” voice (unlike McDonagh, whose “sweet” nature arguably feminizes him). Markievicz is, as critics have remarked over the years (i.e., Butler Cullingford 1996), defeminized in this way. Her presence is thus codified through a dogged emphasis on her “extraordinary” status, which indicates that “ordinary” (McCoole 2003) women were limited in taking up their places in the annals of Irish history, literature, and culture, as much recent scholarship makes clear.\n\n14\n\nWom en a n d t h e Deca de of Com m e mor ations\n\nIwona Irwin-Zarecka points out that “social forgetting” functions as a “noticed absence” (1994, 116), and in those early years—from within the social atmosphere that urged Yeats to unname her—Markievicz, and women more generally, were such a “noticed absence” in Irish history: allowed to participate in their capacity as guardians of memory but not included on a national or otherwise wide scale as the newly formed state set about establishing restricted roles for women. Irwin-Zarecka argues that “Documenting an absence from collective memory is distinct from tracing its origins and transformations. . . . Finding out what has been excluded from the record produces more predictively powerful results than other types of inquiry into the framing process” (1994, 117). Beiner’s most recent work on Forgetful Remembering serves as a model for what is often referred to as historical and cultural “recovery” work but is sometimes, in fact, a matter of listening to what has been said, as Beiner notes in the closing pages of his book: it is a matter of expanding our idea of what source material consists of and to whom we are willing to listen. This kind of work—the kind of work so strongly represented in this volume—is, in many ways, a self-reflexive exercise, one that demands a move away from oblivious remembering to a more critically aware remembrance that is actively inclusive. I would argue that there is a distinction to be drawn between the kind of “forgetful remembrance” that Beiner’s work documents and the obliviousness that comes from structural inequalities of the kind, for instance, that has meant that women have so often been excluded from history and commemoration on this island as elsewhere. So while appreciative of the social usefulness of forgetting that Beiner’s study demonstrates and also aware of the dangers of saturation in what Emilie Pine calls the “memory marketplace” (Pine 2020), I am also cautious and wary that such forgetfulness, or accepting the idea that we have seen excessive commemoration, might push us backward. My concern would be that, were we to agree that there is an excess of memory, an excess of commemoration, it would be the more marginalized voices and perspectives that would be the first to go. Since there has never been an “excess of commemoration” for any but a select few in Ireland, I would be more inclined to encourage the glut of memory, to open the door to all of those voices that have been, traditionally and historically, unheard. It is the tack of recovery that has been so successful in an Irish context since the 1980s, when, in the decade following the women’s movement, scholars began to publish the kind of work that not only documented but began to fill in those gaps. From the groundbreaking work of scholars like Margaret Ward, Maria Luddy, Margaret McCurtain, Gerardine Meaney, and many others, a substantial body of critical work has been amassed and is being constantly built on, as, for example, in Lucy McDiarmid’s wonderful At Home in the Revolution\n\nI n troduction\n\n15\n\n(2015) and the ongoing work of all the scholars who have contributed to this volume, whose work opens up the material culture of women of this period and their position both in Ireland and further afield, challenging us to change narratives and to remember differently. Markievicz herself has gained in prominence as the decade has advanced. Paul Muldoon’s “1916: The Eoghan Rua Variations” (published in the Irish Times on March 27, 2016) includes a direct mention of her in the opening of the fifth sonnet in the sequence: “I’ve watched Countess Markievicz striding through the oaks / where our aspirations turn out to be pigs in pokes.” This echoes the start of Yeats’s poem—“I have seen them”—but the effect of the contraction is to take the formality away, to remove the distance, which Yeats clearly felt while writing his poem. And rather than avoid names in the collection published as Rising to the Rising, Muldoon uses them regularly. Markievicz returns in part 7: “‘Leave your jewels in the bank,’ / the Countess told the girls. ‘The only thing worth / wearing’s a revolver.’ It seems she shot one officer point-blank” (Muldoon 2016c). If Markievicz was left out of Yeats’s poem because she had not died, she is used by Muldoon precisely because she had lived, her speech making her present in a different kind of memorialization, a bringing back to life through direct speech. Markievicz has been present in this decade in other ways, too: in July 2018 her portrait was presented to the House of Commons to mark her historic election to the British parliament, the first woman to be so elected (though she did not, of course, take up the seat). Markievicz was also the subject of an exhibition at the National Gallery of Ireland: “Countess Markievicz: Portraits and Propaganda” sought to illuminate the life and image of a woman historically eclipsed by the images of the men she fought alongside and was timed to correspond to the centenary of Irish women receiving the right to vote (in 1918). After a dearth of biographical attention, these past few years have also seen two new biographies as well as a book on Markievicz and her sister, Eva Gore-Booth. These activities, alongside many other regional and local endeavors during the decade of commemorations—such as the staging of Gore-Booth’s The Death of Fionovar in Cork in 2015—suggest that there is a possibility of finally moving away from a dominant narrative of the nation’s founding and the revolutionary period that saw women sidelined: to extend the narrative and to name names.\n\nWa k ing th e Fe m inists, Globa lly a n d Nationa lly The official Decade of Centenaries program has run parallel to key events both within Ireland and outside of it that have also had an impact on Irish consciousness. Though cultural memory was far from exclusively national in the period of\n\n16\n\nWom en a n d t h e Deca de of Com m e mor ations\n\na century ago, memory in the present is determinedly transnational, as recent studies have shown (De Cesari and Rigney 2014; Tornquist-Plewa, Bernsand, and La Rosa 2017)—it is also transcultural (Bond and Rapson 2014). There is a sense in which the Irish commemorative environment of this decade has been unquestionably informed by events outside of Ireland, and not just through engagement with other national commemorations to mark the centenaries of, for instance, the Battle of the Somme or the Gallipoli landing. Commemorations do not take place in a frame in which they reference only each other, but they occur in broad social contexts—and wide, even global, questions concerning women’s rights have had an impact on our commemorative agendas as have had Brexit and the ongoing lack of a sitting government in Northern Ireland. Only two weeks before the Abbey’s announcement of Waking the Nation, for instance, then first lady of the United States Michelle Obama delivered a searing speech in response to revelations that presidential candidate Donald Trump had bragged, on camera, about his inappropriate and sexually abusive treatment of women: “This is not something that we can ignore,” Obama said (2016). Obama’s speech was prescient, preceding what was to end up as a torrent of comparable revelations as part of the #MeToo movement, which, in a now-global climate of outrage about sexual predation and the start of a Donald Trump presidency, took root in Ireland as elsewhere. While #MeToo had been founded by activist Tarana Burke in 2006 (Brockes 2018), it exploded on social media in October 2017 following a New York Times investigation into film producer Harvey Weinstein’s long-rumored patterns of intimidatory practices, sexual harassment, and sexual assault (Kantor and Twohey 2017). While initial media reports focused on Hollywood revelations, the #MeToo hashtag rapidly spread far beyond that community and references to well-known or powerful men; it became, instead, a worldwide sign of resistance and reclamation of self in the aftermath of abuse. The sense of an urgent need to speak out, to be heard and believed about abuse, came to an Ireland only approximately three decades into a process of dealing with revelations of its own particular and historical forms of abuse. Since the 1980s, there have been nearly continuous admissions regarding the abuse of children and women at the hands of the state in a variety of state-run institutions. #MeToo as an idea and as a movement has thus had a peculiar kind of resonance on this island, where the Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (the Ryan Report) published its shocking findings as recently as May 2009, and where disclosures continue to be made about the scale of abuse and violence in industrial schools and mother and baby homes, where unmarried women were often placed and had their children removed from\n\nI n troduction\n\n17\n\nthem.11 While the aim here is not to suggest that instances of contemporary sexual assault in Hollywood are comparable to long-term abuse of numerous kinds at government-sanctioned institutions, #MeToo nonetheless has political and social power in the present to influence how we interpret and react to that long-term abuse. At present, at the urging of groups such as Justice for Magdalenes, which has fought for the rights of women forced to live and work in laundries in Ireland during the twentieth century, and in large part because of the independent research of Catherine Corless, who doggedly pursued information about the Tuam Mother and Baby Home, the Irish government is carrying out an investigation into mother and baby homes. The Decade of Centenaries program, as it went on, opened up its focus with the Decade of Centenaries: Second Phase Guidance, 2018–2023, thus extending the period of reflection to include the Civil War’s end; it also relented in its focus on events of a century ago to fund other commemorative projects and events, including “1916 Home 2016,” which “respond[ed] to the 20th anniversary of the closure of Ireland’s last Magdalen Laundry. Papers consider[ed] how we commemorate the history of women and how their bodies were treated during the revolutionary period and, later, by the Irish State” (Irish Humanities Alliance 2016). Specific cultural and historical situations of the Irish twentieth and twenty-first centuries have interacted, in other words, with a broader context—with a global, media-driven surge that urged women and survivors of abuse to come forward. Interestingly, this movement coincided with a new adaptation for global television of Margaret Atwood’s dystopian novel The Handmaid’s Tale (1985), which presents a world in which women have been utterly stripped of freedom and are used for breeding purposes—the costumes for which have been used by feminist protests around the world, including in the United States (Hauser 2017), Australia (Mary Ward 2018), and Ireland (“Pro-choice Campaigners” 2017)—and which provoked the wry headline “Women of Ireland to Watch Handmaid’s Tale to Escape Grim Reality” in the satiric online news platform Waterford Whisperers (2018). That these international events and contexts have an impact on Ireland demonstrates how much current history has the potential to be shaped by transnational and transcultural women’s movements that take root through unofficial forums such as social media; for instance, there were reports of higher-than-usual calls to the Rape Crisis Centre in Ireland following #MeToo, and rape trials in Ireland are thought to be influenced by the movement as well (Gallagher 2019). The response to and impact of movements such as #WTF, #MeToo, and #Ibelieveher—a hashtag that emerged on Twitter in response to a high-profile rape trial in Belfast in 2017 in which all of the accused were acquitted12—were\n\n18\n\nWom en a n d t h e Deca de of Com m e mor ations\n\nall the more profound for Ireland in 2018 for, while the country marked the centenary of women’s suffrage, it was also facing a key vote in relation to women’s rights. On May 25, 2018, Ireland voted to repeal the Eighth Amendment to the Irish constitution (which had recognized the rights of the “unborn”), paving the way for the legal provision of safe access to abortion. The result came after a hard-fought grassroots campaign that repeatedly reminded people of just how many women’s lives had been endangered and lost because of the amendment, which has prevented doctors from acting to save the lives of pregnant women. At such a moment, when bodily autonomy has been granted to Irish women through democratic vote, it was perhaps the centenary of Irish women’s suffrage that had more resonance than any other (see the significant work of Kennedy, chapter 14 this volume). Jenny Edkins reminds us that “when we are less immediately involved we can more readily participate in, and perhaps challenge, practices of remembrance” (2003, 23). In this sense, the distance from events of a century ago and the distance of women from Irish history—by virtue of having been written out, silenced, and prevented from participating in the operations of the state for so long—have perhaps functioned as an enabling fact in the present. As time passes, performed commemorations and the sites of memorials must not just evoke symbols: “It is no longer sufficient to evoke a recognised narrative symbolically: the story has to be explicitly told” (Edkins 2003, 124). The kind of story narrated by this decade of commemorations is being “explicitly told” not just through official and state commemorations but also through the work of activists, artists, scholars, and critics whose work continues to inform strands of women’s movements in Ireland. Their work is no longer being patently ignored, but there are still voids to fill and still distance to be covered. As recently as May 2018, in a sign of the continuing importance granted to history in an Irish context, Irish President Michael D. Higgins launched The Cambridge History of Ireland, making an impassioned plea for an ongoing commitment to historical research, teaching, and support: “A knowledge and understanding of history is intrinsic to our shared citizenships, [and] to be without such knowledge is to be permanently burdened with a lack of perspective, empathy and wisdom” (M. Higgins 2018b). The project for which the prestigious launch took place, however, contains the work of only 28 female researchers out of the total 102, indicating that, however much change has taken place, more is required. Current projects, which include the work of established as well as up-and-coming scholars, continue the work of rewriting narratives, challenging commemorative practices, and encouraging others to contribute to a shifting landscape of Irish social studies.\n\nI n troduction\n\n19\n\nOut of the explicit recognition that some of the significant commemorations of this period will not have been the ones that have been the most covered by media or those that received the most funding, this book marks “women and the decade of commemorations” rather than the “decade of centenaries,” having sought not only to highlight work that concerns women in either the Ireland of a century ago or the Ireland of the present but also to privilege women’s scholarship in an attempt to redress what has been a long-standing imbalance. What remains to be seen is whether our reinsertion, in this decade of commemorations, of absent voices, lost stories, and subverted histories into the national narrative will stick and become part of cultural memory in Ireland. The fiftieth anniversary of the Rising functioned as a narrative of modernization (R. Higgins 2012); the ninetieth anniversary marked a self-congratulatory Celtic Tiger-era display of hypermasculinity in its militarism. We can only hope that the commemorations of this decade have marked out a space that sees women permanently lifted out of the footnotes and brought into the text. That this is happening is in large part due not only to the work of committed scholars but also to the amount of new primary source material available, from census data to the military archives, which provides new windows into lives that have been obscured or are simply unknown. As part of my own ongoing research, I was recently able to access my grandmother’s military pension archive, including a page that has stayed with me. Following her death, one of my aunts was required to complete a form, which contained the typeface “His Name” for the deceased; my aunt duly crossed this out and wrote “Her,” highlighting the need to be prepared to revise and challenge the terms of the past as they are presented to us. Commemorative activity is always a reflection not of the past but of the present, and, just as Yeats’s poem offers insight into a culture unprepared to acknowledge in full the contributions of women, the ways in which we mark the decade of commemorations similarly reflects our cultural views: perhaps the events of this decade will be remembered not only for the laying of wreaths and the pageantry of the official commemorations but for the waking of the feminists—some of whom have been awake already for a long, long time.\n\nNote s 1. Critics have noted that historians were privileged over anthropologists, sociologists, political scientists, and literary critics, for example (see Bryan 2016). 2.

The original committee did not have any representatives of historians working in universities in Northern Ireland nor any whose work specifically covered Northern Ireland. Éamon Phoenix is based in Stranmillis College, Queen’s University Belfast, and Mary Harris’s work also considers the conflict in Northern Ireland. This suggests that, as time has gone on, the need for further inclusion of Northern Ireland has been recognized. Available at ­http://​­w ww​ .­decadeofcentenaries​.­com​/­expert​-­group​/. 3.

Research suggests that events and ideas persist as long-term memory in the individual mind if they fulfill certain criteria: we are more likely to remember events that happen during the ages of fifteen and twenty-five because that period is one that sees the emergence of independence and the individual self (M. Conway 1997; M. Conway et al. 2005); we are more likely to remember major life events because they happen infrequently and involve transitions: marriage, birth, death, emigration. Traumas of all kinds are more likely to be remembered (Scrivner and Safer 1988), alas, than their joyous counterparts, as are surprising and emotional events (Christianson and Loftus 1991). Rehearsal of events in memory—what we call “consolidation”—also helps move memory from working memory to longer-term memory (McGaugh 2000). The Easter Rising involved all of these elements. 7. The cognitive anthropologist Harvey Whitehouse found that daily or weekly religious rituals were not particularly distinctive experiences and would not be remembered, in fact, were it not for the practice of repetition. Unusual rituals practiced much more rarely, Whitehouse found, and thus under the threat of being forgotten, had to be more extreme, marked by features that would leave their mark on memory; otherwise the ritual would be lost (Whitehouse 1995). While Whitehouse is concerned with memory for religious ritual, his research suggests that the rituals associated with commemorative practice are comparable: it is unlikely that people recall, say, the fifty-ninth anniversary of the Rising as strongly as the fiftieth, and it is likely that the centenary will have marked memory more strongly than other anniversaries. This is because, of\n\nI n troduction\n\n21\n\ncourse, the “special” anniversaries will be marked with more extreme, and more abundant, ceremonies. 8.

In a period during which commemorations, in spite of engaged efforts, have tended to take place in either Northern Ireland or the Republic, the Belfast rape trial provoked protests across the island, despite the fact that the jurisdictions are distinct.

Critiques, however, should focus not just on these “absences” but also on how what is commemorated is made visible—and by whom. Gendered discourses of sacrifice, patriotism, and the masculine nature of heroic republicanism mean certain observations on the gendered memory of the 1916 Rising can be made. As noted by Karen Steele, Irish women’s republican activism during the 1916 Rising as well as the subsequent War of Independence and Civil War, which was “shaped and encoded by gender norms,” prevented “both comrades and enemies from noticing their political agency and effectiveness in the struggle for Irish liberty,” resulting in the elision of much of what the women said and did from contemporary and subsequent historical accounts and commemorations (2010, 58). Women who participated in the Rising are made semi-visible, in mainstream narratives, through the very specific categories of carer and nurturer, and, post-Rising, this gendered narrative was expanded to include women as official mourners and keepers of the heroic male patriot flame. Women’s militancy, on the other hand, has been invisible, censored, or noted with the understanding that militancy remained unique to a small number of “extraordinary” women. Women such as Countess Markievicz or Margaret Skinnider1 have been encoded as unfeminine, and their behavior, as it was dictated by extreme or unusual circumstances, was considered temporary. These “unfeminine” women, even if lauded for bravery, could be set aside as unusual, and, therefore, once the “acceptable” women’s nurturing and caring roles are mentioned, no other experiences need be considered. This constructed, safe, and passive image of\n\n22\n\nR e m e m ber e d for Bei ng Forgotten\n\n23\n\nthe women of 1916, which would dominate mainstream narratives, was set in place soon after the Easter Rising.\n\nConstructing th e Gen der ed Discou r se s of 1916 In traditional histories, the years from 1916 to 1921 are regarded as most important in terms of republican propaganda; it is the period from the summer of 1916 to the end of 1918 that firmly established the gendered discourse that dominates received narratives of the Rising until, it can be argued, the present day. The lacuna of women’s contributions in the mainstream narratives that emerge in republican propaganda can be perceived as a dismissal of the propaganda activism of republican women between 1916 and 1918. However, women historians2 of the revolutionary period recognize the continuing importance of militant women, post 1916. As Margaret Ward has noted, in the months following Easter Week, “only the women remained free to consolidate the new mood and generate a new movement; it all depended on their energy and their commitment,” so it was left to Cumann na mBan, the Irish women’s paramilitary organization, to wage effective propaganda campaigns (1983, 118). This retrospective acclamation of the heroes of 1916, a constructed masculine “patriotic cult” of the Rising, developed very quickly and depended, as historian Peter Hart wrote, on the “flood of rebel memorabilia, of postcards, mass cards, song sheets, pamphlets, flags, badges, pictures, photograph albums, calendars and a host of mass produced items” (2000, 207). It was women who produced and distributed much of the Easter Week memorabilia, postcards, posters, and flags that commemorated the executed and imprisoned leaders of 1916; they also produced pamphlets that emphasized the loyalty owed by Ireland to the successors of the men of 1916, those men who were now leading Sinn Féin. A 1918 Cumann na mBan pamphlet declared that “not a week passes but some incident occurs in every part of the country which could be turned to account in driving home the lesson that the country must look to Sinn Féin for its salvation” (Novick 2002, 38). Women also submitted articles to newspapers describing the heroics and sacrifices of the men of 1916, positioning them as inheritors of a patriotic iconography stretching from the eighteenth-century heroes of 1798 such as Lord Edward Fitzgerald and Wolfe Tone through the myriad of nineteenth-century rebels. This positioning of the male dead of 1916 in the chronology of the “glorious” patriot dead is evident in one of the most emotive occasions for republican propaganda post-Rising, the funeral of Thomas Ashe (see McAuliffe 2017). Ashe was one of the two senior surviving commandants of 1916 (Éamon de Valera was the other) and had commanded the garrison in Ashbourne. He\n\n24\n\nWom en a n d t h e Deca de of Com m e mor ations\n\nhad been court-martialed and sentenced to death, a sentence then commuted to life imprisonment; he was released as part of the general amnesty of 1917. Ashe was regarded as one of the most important, popular, and senior leaders of the Irish Volunteers. On release, he was determined to take advantage of an environment now more receptive to republican ideology, traveling the country and making seditious speeches in breach of the conditions of his release under the Defence of the Realm (DORA) regulation. Because of these activities, he was rearrested in August 1917 and imprisoned in Mountjoy Jail with dozens of other republican men who went on hunger strike to force the authorities to grant them “political prisoner” status. On September 25, 1917, Ashe suffered a heart attack while being force fed and died soon after being transferred to the nearby Mater Hospital. His funeral was deliberately planned, with Cumann na mBan help, to be one of the largest displays of republicanism since the Rising. As Michael Brennan of the East Clare Brigade of the IRA noted, “Ashe was given a national funeral which was probably the biggest and most impressive demonstration so far in our movement” (BMH 1,068, 29). Over nine thousand volunteers, eighteen thousand trade unionists, and members of the Irish Citizen Army and Cumann na mBan joined his funeral cortege from Dublin City Hall, where he had lain in state, to Glasnevin Cemetery.3 The cortege took a deliberately circuitous route to Glasnevin in order to pass sites associated with the patriot dead. At High Street, it passed Tailors Hall where Wolfe Tone and United Irishmen met prior to the 1798 rebellion; at Thomas Street, it passed the site of execution of Robert Emmet, whose failed rebellion in 1803 was still remembered in song and story. On the Quays, it passed the Four Courts, and, on O’Connell Street, it passed the GPO, both iconic sites associated with the 1916 patriot dead. It was noted that over “200,000 spectators and sympathisers thronged the route . . . roofs, windows, verandas—even lamp-posts, railings, walls, hoardings, trees, statues, and monument—every possible point of vantage was utilised by eager sightseers” (Evening Herald, October 1, 1917). The funeral cortege was filmed and shown around the country—and in the footage numerous members of Cumann na mBan, as well as Irish Volunteers and other militant groups, are seen marching in tight formation behind the hearse.4 The message was that Ashe, now in his turn, joined the masculine pantheon of martyred patriots for Irish freedom. If executed signatories of 1916 and Ashe in 1917 were now firmly emblematic of the sacrifice of republican men, it was the widows and mothers of 1916, especially the widows of the executed signatories, who quickly became effective emblems of the sacrifices of women. A gendered concept of sacrifice was used in these propaganda campaigns, and it fell on fertile ground. In a culture already attuned to\n\nR e m e m ber e d for Bei ng Forgotten\n\n25\n\nthe concept of the heroic male fighting and dying for a passive, waiting Mother Ireland, images of the dead, mostly young male patriots of 1916 and Ashe, good looking, tall, the only militarily successful 1916 leader, reenforced the relationship between militant nationalism and masculinity. Republican womanhood, on the other hand, with the odd exception, had, in the propaganda, a more passive image. One potent example of this passive image is the series of photographs reproduced in the Catholic Bulletin.5 In December 1916, its editor, J. J. Reynolds, commissioned these photographs of the widows and orphans of the dead signatories of the 1916 Proclamation. Áine Ceannt, Muriel McDonagh, Lillie Connolly, Agnes Mallin, and Kathleen Clarke were photographed in widows’ weeds, several of the women surrounded by their young orphaned children.6 Hanna Sheehy Skeffington, widow of the murdered Francis, was photographed with her son Owen, while Nannie O’Rahilly, whose husband The O’Rahilly had been killed in the vainglorious charge up Moore Street on Easter Friday as the GPO garrison prepared for their retreat, was photographed with her four sons, one of whom, Rory, had been born in July 1916, three months after his father’s death. Agnes Mallin also held a baby, Moira, born four months after the Rising and her father’s execution. In particular, the poignant and romantic image of Grace Gifford resonated. Gifford was the fiancée of Joseph Plunkett, a poet, a journalist, a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, one of the planners of the Rising, and a signatory to the Proclamation. The couple were to marry on Easter Sunday in 1916, but, as the Rising broke out, their nuptials were postponed. After the surrender, Plunkett was court-martialed and sentenced to death. On May 3, 1916, Gifford was brought to Kilmainham where she and Plunkett were married in the prison chapel and granted ten minutes alone in his cell a few hours before his execution. The story of the 1916 rebel and his true love was widely publicized, with articles about their marriage appearing in Irish, English, and American newspapers. The fact that Gifford was an accomplished artist, political cartoonist, and activist in her own right was rarely mentioned. As noted by Brian Murphy in his study of the importance and impact of the Bulletin, “Few could remain unmoved by the pictures of children, many mere babies, surrounding their mothers” (1989, 75). These widows, sweethearts, and mothers of the Rising leaders became emblems of the nation, the ever patient, expectant, and sacrificing Mother Ireland; they were potent but passive symbols of the sacrifice of their men. The Bulletin, as Clair Wills notes, was very important in molding the growing post- Rising support for the rebels’ ideologies (2009, 110–116). Unlike other more radical or ostensibly republican publications, it was not heavily censored\n\n26\n\nWom en a n d t h e Deca de of Com m e mor ations\n\nunder the DORA regulations.7 It was, as Sinn Féin historian P. S. O’Hegarty later admitted, one of the papers that helped “make the Rising acceptable to a majority in Ireland” (Ó Drisceoil 2012, 58). Editor J. J. O’Kelly understood that the “first stage of recession of Easter week into history” was important and determined that the Bulletin would be in favor of the heroes of 1916 (B. Murphy 2012, 48). The Bulletin, he wrote, would eventually be searched by students of history for “material that will enable them to place in its true perspective the lives and the methods and the motives of the men of Easter Week” (ibid., my italics). The “subtle mix of historical narrative and propaganda” in the Bulletin urged the Irish public toward support of the formation of a republican Sinn Féin by 1917 (ibid., 51–52). The Bulletin kept to the forefront of its readers’ minds a narrative of the sacrifice of the “men of 1916.” With its laudatory obituaries and its twenty-three photographs of the widows and orphans of the men of 1916, the Bulletin helped normalize and gender the patriotism of those who fought and died in the Rising. These hagiographic images and sketches of the male heroes and their grieving but proud widows showed a nonthreatening, acceptable republicanism, gendered in a respectable discourse of sacrificial male patriot and passive, keening, grieving woman. This, as Wills notes, reassured the initially skeptical public that the “rebels were not German stooges but Irishmen and Catholics, who devoted themselves to their nation” (2009, 111–112). The sacrifice of the widows, and of the wives and mothers of the thousands of imprisoned Volunteers, was swiftly constructed as one of stoicism, loyalty, and emotional suffering.\n\nWom en a n d th e Fir st Com m e mor ation, 1917 The first anniversary of the Rising in April 1917 was vital in the ongoing republican propaganda campaigns, but, with many of the male leaders in prison, constrained under DORA or on the run, it was, again, the political women who were central to organizing commemorative events. That April the Bulletin and other publications produced a glut of writings replete with the “hazy symbolism of the sword, righteous flame and Mother Ireland . . . hagiographical portraits of individual [male] insurgents emphasising their devotion to God and the Irish nation” (Wills 2009, 115–116) . However, when women were mentioned in these articles, the focus was on their roles as caregivers, nurses, and assistants. As Ireland was still under martial law in 1917 and physical acts of commemoration were banned, it fell to the republican women, despite their traditional representation in the media, to attempt illegal but emotive commemorations at the Rising outposts. According to Helena Molony, one of the\n\nR e m e m ber e d for Bei ng Forgotten\n\n27\n\norganizers of that first commemoration, the women “intended to run up the flags again in all these positions and to get out the proclamation, and proclaim it again, and to try to establish the position that the fight was not over, and that the Republic still lives” (BMH, WS 391, Helena Molony, 42). This action was left to the “extremist group” in Liberty Hall, “women, including Jinny Shanahan and Winnie Carney” (ibid.). With some help the women managed to get the tricolor up a flagpole at the GPO the night before the date chosen for commemoration—which was Easter Monday, April 9, rather than the actual anniversary of the Rising, April 24. Molony and her comrades also commemorated James Connolly with a major event at Liberty Hall on the first anniversary of his execution, May 12, 1917. A large scroll was created that bore the words “James Connolly Murdered, May 12th, 1916.” Rosie Hackett described what happened: “Miss Molony called us together Jinny Shanahan, Brigid Davis and myself. . . . Getting up on the roof, she [Molony] put it high up, across the top parapet. We were on top of the roof for the rest of the time it was there. We barricaded the windows. . . . Thousands of people were watching from the quay on the far side of the river. It took the police a good hour or more before they got in, and the script was there until six in the evening, before they got it down” (Rosie Hackett, BMH WS 546, 10–11). In these first commemorations, as in all subsequent commemorations until the late twentieth century, it was the ideologies, activism, and sacrifices of the male heroes of 1916 that were central to the commemorative narrative. The flags, the emblems, and the reprinting and reposting in the city of the Proclamation “would become part of the battle for legitimacy not just between Republicans and the State, but between Republicans themselves; and women would adopt the mantle of guardians of the ideals of the Rising” (R. Higgins 2016b, 51). Nowhere, in any of these commemorations, was the role of women at the forefront. For republican ideologies to take root, it was important to focus on Pearse, who had proclaimed the Republic, on the sixteen men who had been executed, on the men still in prison for their republican activism: and it was thus important to consign the role of women to auxiliary or marginal status. The resulting narratives did not go unnoticed by some of the republican women in the years after the Rising. Senior activists such as Jennie Wyse Power and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington campaigned long and hard to gain executive roles in the Sinn Féin, which was now the political wing of republicanism. The aim, in having these roles at senior level in Sinn Féin, was to hold the party leaders to the promise of equality, as included in the Proclamation. Because of the outbreak of the War of Independence and subsequent Civil War, the first formal commemoration of the Rising did not take place until\n\n28\n\nWom en a n d t h e Deca de of Com m e mor ations\n\n1924, when the Cumann na nGaedheal-led Irish Free State organized a military commemoration at Arbour Hill, where most of the executed men of 1916 are buried. Due to the divisions of the Civil War and since Cumann na mBan had, for the most part, rejected the Anglo-Irish Treaty, very few republican women took part. In fact, of the relatives of the signatories still living, only Agnes Mallin, widow of Michael, agreed to participate. In the 1930s, after Fianna Fáil came to power, commemoration became more about gaining political capital and legitimacy from the legacies of 1916. In 1934, de Valera, as head of the government, had Kathleen Clarke (widow of Tom Clarke) and Mary Margaret Pearse (sister of Patrick) prominently involved, symbolizing the sacrifice of the men of 1916, and so conferring legitimacy on his government. But women’s part in commemorative events during this era remained marginal and purely symbolic, as did any commemoration of the part they played in 1916. In her study of commemoration and 1916, Roisín Higgins acknowledged that, during the fiftieth anniversary in 1966, “discourses on freedom were concerned with the national question and economic inequalities and were not translated into gender issues”; nor was the historical position of women during the Easter Rising discussed in terms of contemporary women’s roles or position in society (2012, 82–83). Kathleen Clarke’s offer to serve on the commemoration committee was tellingly declined at a moment when the women of Old Cumann na mBan saw themselves “as guardians of the republican conscience rather than representative of the interests of women,” as Margaret Ward has argued (cited in R. Higgins 2012, 84). As the country moved further in time from the Rising, representations of women, as Louise Ryan wrote, were “contained within the conventional narratives of grieving mothers or passive, nameless victims” (2004, 47). More than most, it is in the person of Elizabeth O’Farrell that the nature of that gendered memory and historical amnesia was embodied.\n\nR e m e m ber ing N u r se O’Fa r r ell: Eliz a beth O’Fa r r ell In a letter to Patrick Pearse, commandant of the 1916 rebel forces, dated April 29, 1916, the British commander of the crown forces in Dublin, General Lowe, wrote that “a woman has come in and tells me you wish to surrender” (Irish Independent, April 21, 1965, 3). That woman was Elizabeth O’Farrell, commonly referred to in narratives of the Rising, and more particularly in those of the surrender, as Nurse O’Farrell. One of the most prominent and poignant images in these surrender narratives is of O’Farrell, “a pretty, pale girl,” walking under fire toward the British positions to offer the surrender of the rebel\n\nR e m e m ber e d for Bei ng Forgotten\n\n29\n\nforces on Saturday, April 29, 1916, assuring her place, albeit a gendered place, in the history books (Good 2016, 111). The Catholic Bulletin, in 1917, included descriptions from both O’Farrell and her lifelong companion, Julia Grenan, of her role in the surrender (E. O’Farrell 1917; Grenan 1917). O’Farrell describes the series of instructions she delivered to Lowe from Pearse, and from Pearse to Lowe, over a number of hours on that Saturday. In her own recounting, the woman who had made a choice to commit her life to militant separatism is evident. She recalled that she delivered her request to the first senior British officer she met, stating that “the commandant of the Irish Republican Army wishes to treat with the commandant of the British forces in Ireland.” When, rather disparagingly, he asked if she meant the “Sinn Féiners,” as the insurgents were now being called by the public and the Crown Forces, she corrected him, stating, “No, the Irish Republican Army they call themselves and I think that is a very good name too” (Bulletin, April–May 2017, 30). This exchange demonstrates a woman quite aware of who she was fighting with, and why. She continued negotiating with the British until, at about 3:30 p.m. that afternoon, she accompanied Pearse up Moore Street to General Lowe, where, standing by his side, she watched as he handed over his sword and surrendered. The moment of surrender was preserved in a famous photograph, with Pearse facing General Lowe and his aide-de-camp, while half-hidden beside him was Elizabeth O’Farrell. Artist Sinéad Guckian reimagines the famous photo in a painting that, instead, provides a fuller view of O’Farrell. (See Figs. 1.1 and 1.2.) Who was this woman standing beside the commandant of the Irish Forces at one of the central and iconic moments of the 1916 narrative? Elizabeth O’Farrell was born in Dublin’s City Quay in 1883 to Christopher Farrell, a dock laborer, and his wife Margaret. With Julia Grenan by her side, O’Farrell was, from the early 1900s, involved in activism. On leaving school, she got a job in a printing house, while her work as a political activist also began. Initially a member of the cultural nationalist organization the Gaelic League, she went on to join the militant, separatist, and feminist cultural organization Inghinidhe na hÉireann around 1906, and later, in 1908, the militant feminist organization the Irish Women’s Franchise League (IWFL). O’Farrell was, in common with many of her generation, men and women, motivated by the three significant movements of early twentieth-century Ireland: the national moment, the women’s movement, and the labor movement. In 1911, she joined the newly formed Irish Women Worker’s Union (IWWU) and, in 1913, was part of the Dublin Lockout strike. In 1914, she joined the newly formed women’s nationalist group, Cumann na mBan, and it was here, in common with most Cumann na mBan\n\nFigure 1.1. 1916 Surrender, April 29, 1916.

When the Rising broke out on Easter Monday 1916, O’Farrell and Grenan were among the first women to join the insurgent general headquarters at the GPO on O’Connell Street. There, during the week, they served in several roles: as couriers and message carriers, as arms smugglers between outposts, and, as the fighting intensified, performing nursing and caring duties in the GPO. O’Farrell’s political chronology of militant feminist and separatist activism led directly to her involvement in 1916. However, in the mainstream narratives of 1916, women’s political agency in choosing involvement in militancy from an ideological standpoint was often invisible or denied. As her comrade-in-arms Helena Molony later complained, it seemed that men were “unable to believe that any woman [could] embrace an ideal, accept it intellectually, feel it as a profound emotion and then calmly decide to make a vocation of working for its realization” (BMH, Helena Molony, WS 391). For O’Farrell and many of the women of 1916, their involvement was as political and as ideologically motivated as that of the men of 1916. They were not there because they simply followed their brothers, husbands, lovers, or fathers into battle; they were there because they were committed to the ideal of an Irish Republic in which they had full and equal citizenship, as promised in the Proclamation of 1916. The “pretty and pale girl”8 who negotiated the surrender for Pearse in 1916 was in fact a thirty-two-year-old seasoned political activist who knew why she was there. As the photograph of the surrender was taken, O’Farrell made another decision, one that she admitted she later regretted. In retelling the story of that moment, she explained her decision: “If you examine the photograph of Pearse surrendering to General Lowe, you will notice the shoe and dress of a nurse on the far side of Pearse. She told us that when she saw a British soldier getting ready to take the photo, she stepped back beside Pearse so as not to give the enemy press any satisfaction. Ever after she regretted having done so” (An Fiolar 1958). Because she stepped back, in the original photograph O’Farrell is only visible from the knees down, and her gray coat with the white nurse’s apron underneath is also visible. However, subsequent treatments of the photograph removed even this evidence of O’Farrell, with her gray coat being manipulated to make it seem as if Pearse was wearing a long coat. This was, as one commentator noted, “an editorial decision . . . Pearse was the important figure, Elizabeth wasn’t” (Loughrey 2016, 5). This excising of O’Farrell from the iconic image has become a popular symbol of the airbrushing of the women of 1916 from the narrative, a willful act of amnesia about the role of women. However, it is perhaps the significance of the naming of O’Farrell as\n\nR e m e m ber e d for Bei ng Forgotten\n\n33\n\nNurse O’Farrell that was more effective at airbrushing the more complicated and integral histories of the women of 1916 from mainstream Easter Rising and broader revolutionary narratives. Nurse O’Farrell is often the only woman mentioned, often the only individual woman (other than the outlier and “extraordinary” woman Countess Markievicz) in histories of Easter Week. The image of the nurturing, caring, and passive nurse, the helpmate of the patriot male, dominates the gendered representations of 1916. Nurse O’Farrell, the kind, caring, reliable auxiliary, is an unthreatening representation of the women of 1916. In a report of her death in June 1957, she is described as “Pearse’s envoy” and the nurse who “attended the wounded and the dying” during Easter Week. Her own political activism and ideologies, before and after the Rising, were not mentioned. However, another photograph exists, reputed to be of O’Farrell, a studio photograph taken prior to the Rising. In this image, the woman is standing facing directly at the camera, in a military uniform, holding in her right hand an unholstered gun, probably a C96 “Peter the Painter” semiautomatic gun.9 It is telling that this woman is dressed in a more masculine Volunteer-style uniform, holding a weapon.10 Here is a Cumann na mBan woman in a very different guise: this self-constructed image shows a woman with agency, an ideologically committed, fervently militant Cumann na mBan woman, in stark contrast to that of the nurse and caregiver. This photograph of the uniformed, armed woman is at odds with subsequent memoirs of O’Farrell; however, it is the image and title of “nurse” that remains central to memories of most of the women of 1916. For their male comrades, it was the care offered by the women that resonated in their memories. Irish Volunteer Fintan Murphy, who was stationed at the GPO during Easter Week, sang the praises of the “gallantry and goodness . . . of that brave band of women . . . who tended and cared for us during the week,” although he did also admit that “some of them [were] risking their lives in crossing the street to our outposts there and [were] all ready and willing to undertake dangerous missions to other commands and elsewhere” (BMH WS 373 Fintan Murphy, 4). Emphasizing the nurturing and caring role of the women of 1916, the Catholic Bulletin of 1917 noted that they “looked after the needs of the men under arms, they nursed the wounded, they soothed the suffering and it was they who softly breathed the last prayer into the ear of the dying” (Catholic Bulletin, 1917). The women—their activism, ideological commitment and militancy disregarded, and their key role in reorganizing and propagandizing the republican movement in the following years forgotten—now became the “girls” who helped in the revolution.\n\n34\n\nWom en a n d t h e Deca de of Com m e mor ations\n\n“Th e Forgotten H eroine s of th e E a ster R ising” Eithne Coyle, an important Cumann na mBan activist during the War of Independence and Civil War, noted that she and her comrades were largely dismissed in narratives of Irish revolutionary history: “It is a curious fact that women as women got a very meagre place in the pages of history. And Irish history, I am sorry to say, is no exception to the rule” (Shighle Humphreys Papers [UCDA], P106/1226[1]). In the initial post–Civil War period, amid a backlash against those who had opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty, the narrative of the women of the revolutionary era was of “unmanageable revolutionaries,” those “furies” in Cumann na mBan who had voted by a majority to reject the Treaty and the setting up of the Irish Free State.11 W. T. Cosgrave, the president of the Free State Executive, condemned those women who were anti-Treaty as “neurotic girls [who] are among the most active adherents to the Irregular cause” (G. Foster 2015, 33). The Sinn Féin historian P. S. O’Hegarty described republican women who had participated in revolutionary activism as “‘practically unsexed,’ animated by ‘swashbuckling and bombast and swagger’ and utterly incapable of understanding the complexities of politics” (Pašeta 2013, 7). “‘War,’ he wrote, ‘and the things war breeds—intolerance, swagger, unwomanliness—captured the women, turned them into unlovely, destructive-minded, avid begetters of violence’” (O’Hegarty in Connell 2017, 104). Women like Coyle and O’Farrell, implacable in their opposition to the twenty-six county Irish Free State, were regarded as unhinged, unwomanly, and a real threat to that new State. Imprisoned during the Civil War and, after the cessation of violence, deliberately marginalized by the masculinist, conservative, Catholic ideologies of the new State, the contributions of women to 1916, other than that of the benign, respectably feminine nurse, began to disappear from official, mainstream narratives. It was inconvenient for the historical narrative that the committed Republican, the armed, militant feminist, Elizabeth O’Farrell, voted against the treaty, sided with the anti-Treaty Republicans during the Civil War, and for the rest of her life, rejected the legitimacy of the State formed in 1922. However, the whitewashed, passive, unthreatening figure of Nurse O’Farrell could, briefly, make an appearance in the Easter Rising story—with her simple white flag, her long nurse’s coat, and her red cross.12 And, as quickly as she enters the narrative, she exits; she exists only for those days of care in the GPO and the journey up Moore Street with her white flag. Once her moment is over, in history as in the photograph, she, along with most of the women of 1916, was quietly and effectively airbrushed from memory.\n\nR e m e m ber e d for Bei ng Forgotten\n\n35\n\nAs the State moved further away from the events of Easter Week, there were attempts to collect histories and memories of the Rising. In 1947, the Bureau of Military History was established “to assemble and coordinate material to form the basis for the compilation of the history of the movement for independence from the formation of the Irish Volunteers on 25 November 1913 to 11 July 1921” (McGarry 2011, 26).13 About 1,770 statements were collected from members of the Irish Volunteers, the Irish Citizen Army, the Irish Republican Brotherhood, Sinn Féin, and, of course, from Cumann na mBan. However, women’s contributions comprised less than 10 percent of the Witness Statements, reflecting, as Ferghal McGarry notes, “contemporary assumptions about the relative importance of their contribution” (ibid., 28). O’Farrell, still refusing to recognize the State, also refused to participate in the Bureau of Military History interviews; nor, indeed, she did she apply for a military pension. Where the women were remembered in the male-centered narratives it was as the “loyal and courageous” girls of Cumann na mBan who “rendered heroic service . . . carried despatches, nursed the sick and wounded, [provided] clothing . . . and there were women and girls [outside of Cumann na mBan] who kept many a long vigil, who cooked and washed and provide shelter” (O’Donoghue in Ryan 2004, 48–49). The dominant memory of the women of 1916 and of the War of Independence had become, effectively and quickly, a gendered memory of wives, mothers, widows, nurses, and carers.\n\nR e m e m ber ed for Being Forgotten From the 1980s, the historiography of women and the Rising (and the following years of violence through to 1923) has been one of constant recovery, rewriting, and reiteration. Over forty years of research and writing on women and the revolutionary era, 1900–1923, mainly by women historians and researchers, has led to a real richness of scholarship.14 Yet, in 2016, many articles appeared in the mainstream Irish media that emphasized the need to look again for “The Forgotten Heroines of the Easter Rising” (Irish Times, January 28, 2016). At the end of one such newspaper article detailing the activities of women such as Linda Kearns, Dr. Kathleen Lynn, Elizabeth O’Farrell, Julia Grenan, Ella Webb, and Margaret Huxley, the author noted that “we compound the original neglect by failing to remember them as we mark the creation myth of our state. . . . By remembering their role in the road to the Republic, the commemoration in 2016 could mark the start of a whole new inclusive chapter in our nation’s story” (ibid.). The implication here, as in many other media pieces, was that 2016 would and should mark a turning point in including women’s contributions to\n\n36\n\nWom en a n d t h e Deca de of Com m e mor ations\n\nthe narrative of the Rising.
