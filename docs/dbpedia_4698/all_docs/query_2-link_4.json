It was the week of Cheltenham races, and as both leader of the Seanad and a Dublin county councillor Wright was too preoccupied to assist a friend in getting his land rezoned.\n\nKnown to lobbyists as a “genial facilitator”, Wright had been helping Denis Mahony, a car dealer and friend, to have his land near Portmarnock in north Dublin rezoned from agricultural to residential use. Mahony was angry at being left in the lurch by Wright as he had only three days, until March 12, to lodge his planning motion with the council.\n\nWright recommended Mahony and his business partner employ Frank Dunlop, a former government press officer,"
