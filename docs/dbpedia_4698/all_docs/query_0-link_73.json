We know now what we purported not to know before: that senior political figures were \"on the take\" and that at least one of them was \"on the take\" for decades. We now know that the manner in which this senior political figures, Charles Haughey, was \"on the take\" involved the complicity of bankers, accountants and benefactors, that it involved a complicated financial ruse (the Ansbacher accounts) that were availed of by many others as well. Many of these others were associates of Mr Haughey. But whatever the further revelations of the Moriarty tribunal into these matters and whatever more emerges about the existence of similar financial ruses in other banks, these represent only the symptom of what seems to be a much deeper malaise. That malaise is represented perhaps best by three extraordinary decisions taken by Fianna Fail-led governments in recent years. The first of these decisions was the tax amnesty of 1993, whereby tax defrauders were given a total amnesty on payment of just 15 per cent of the tax they owed to the state and a guarantee of absolute confidentiality hereafter. The scale of this benefit to the richest in society cannot now be quantified, but it may be assumed with confidence that it was massive. But of more concern is what motivated the introduction of the tax amnesty in the first place. Was it done to accommodate a single mega-rich taxpayer who was in trouble with the Revenue Commissioners and whose generosity to Fianna Fail and perhaps to individuals within the party was considerable? So troubled was the then minister for finance, Bertie Ahern, with the proposal to introduce the scheme that he considered resignation, and he was talked out of it only by a representative of the Labour Party, which was then in government with Fianna Fail. How ironic that a Fianna Fail finance minister should be encouraged to accept a measure that was so manifestly unfair by a representative of a party that purports to represent the quintessence of fairness: The second of these decisions was the refusal to permit the Moriarty tribunal to investigate the source of all funds in the Ansbacher accounts (the accounts held in a Dublin bank, where the holders of the deposits were unnamed, where the monies had been routed through London, the Cayman Islands and back to Dublin). In this Fianna Fail was supported by its partners in government, the Progressive Democrats, and by Fine Gael. (Fine Gael is now busily trying to rewire its involvement in that piece of infamy.) The third was the announcement in the budget of a reduction in the rate of capital gains tax, from 40 per cent to 20 per cent. The scale of this latter tax change is staggering. In one fell swoop, a government that made such a fuss about reducing the top and standard rates of income tax by two percentage points reduced the tax that most affects the rich by a full 20 per centage points. At present, private investors on the Irish Stock Exchange own shares to an estimated value of £8 billion. Over the last year alone, the value of these shares would have increased by about £200 million. The tax on this realisable gain alone has been cut by £40 million. Of course, the capital gain on such stocks would be far greater than £40 million, taking the gain over the last several years. And this capital gain represents only a fraction of the capital gain generated generally in the economy-it does not include, for instance, the capital gain from investment in property. Therefore, the benefit to the rich by this tax reduction is probably of the order of £100 million, although Charlie McCreevy stated that the cost to the exchequer in a single year was only £19 million. Either this was done to benefit the rich generally-on top of the benefit they gained by the reduction in the top rate of income tax-or perhaps for the benefit of a particular individual. Either way, it is a disgrace. And particularly a disgrace given the paucity of the increases in social welfare and the deferral (again) of the implementation of the benefit, such as it was. In that vivid phrase of the hapless Michael Lowry, the cosy cartels are indeed very cosy. They have three parties to represent their interests (Fianna Fail, the Progressive Democrats and Fine Gael) and they have little to fear from a tame Labour Party and a timorous Democratic L~ft.\n\nIN THIS ISSUE ...\n\nBecause of the descent again into carnage and the bleak prospects for the peace process, Northern Ireland features prominently in this issue. We publish ..an inside report on the allparty talks by Fionnuala O'Connor, a profile and interview with the murdered loyalist killer Billy Wight by Emer Woodful, and a review of the significance and new evidence concerning Bloody Sunday by Eamonn McCann. The interview with Mary McAleese, conducted last September, two months before she became president, also touches on Northern Ireland, as well as on the Catholic Church, RTE and her own background. The interview was conducted also before she acquired a new hairstyle. Some of the photographs by Derek Speirs that accompany the interview are therefore of her previous incarnation. Our persistence in pushing the Department of Justice and the gardai on the investigation into the murder of John Corcoran in 1985 seems to have had some effect. As we report on page 8, the Department of Justice has informed us that the special investigation into that murder has been completed. But as we also report, the garda! have not yet interviewed the self-proclaimed murderer, Sean O'Caliaghan. However, we understand an interview is to take pace shortly. It appears that the cover-up of perhaps the most worrying scandal to emerge in recent years continues. Vincent Browne\n\n~\n\nOur March issue will reveal further. details of Charles lIaugheY's'Golden Circle'\n\nMAGILL\n\n7\n\nBRIEFING\n\nSean O'Callaghan:An Update\n\nJustice Minister John O'Donoghue has received the garda report he ordered six months ago into claims by Sean O'Callaghan, the IRA informer, that he murdered another IRA informer, John Corcoran, in 1985. A spokesman said the minister received the report last week. However, Magill has learned that the gardai only contacted Mr O'Callaghan for the first time on Monday 19 January and that, at the time of going to press, he has still not been questioned by gardai. Following controversy early last year about the failure of the gardai to question Sean O'Callaghan about his role in the murder, the then opposition Fianna Fail spokesman, John O'Donoghue, promised to have the matter fully investigated on the party's return to power. Two months ago, on December 8, a spokesman for the minister told Magill that the minister had sought a full report on the case from the garda authorities within weeks of coming into office and that a\" report was \"imminent.\" John Corcoran was an epileptic father of eight and a low level garda informant whose body was found in March 1985 in a field in south Kerry. He had been shot in the head. The Christmas issue of Magill revealed evidence that gardai knew in advance about plans for the murder but failed to intervene. There was also evidence of garda reluctance to investigate the murder, including their failure to question Sean O'Callaghan while he was held in prison in the North for eight years for the murder of two members of the security forces and following his release in December 1996. Magill has now learned that last Monday, 19 January, a senior garda officer spoke to Sean O'Callaghan on Mr O'Callaghan's mobile phone and requested an interview. Mr O'Callaghan agreed, and it is expected that senior gardai will travel to Britain next week to interview him about his role in the murder. Up until now, garda! have told Magill that they were unable to contact Mr O'Callaghan because they didn't have his phone number. Mr O'Callaghan, who has been living in Britain since his release from jail, told Magill he was always available to speak to the gardai and that his mobile phone number had been available to journalists for the last 12 months. In early December, Magill gave the gardai Mr O'Callaghan's mobile-phone number. The garda who spoke to Mr O'Callaghan is the officer who was appointed over a year ago to investigate claims, first made by O'Callaghan in 1988 and \"repeated in interviews with the Sunday Times and the Boston Globe, that he MAGILL 8\n\nmurdered John Corcoran and that . . he warned the gardai several times that John Corcoran's life was in danger. In the interview with the Sunday Times in 1992, he said he informed the gardai about Corcoran's abduction and where Corcoran was being held captive. He said: \"When I returned, I removed Corcoran to a shed. I had him quiet and calm. He thought it was going to be a press conference. I wanted him to think that, because I fully expected gardai to arrive and all of us to be arrested and questioned. The police did not come, and three hours later I put a Beretta machine-pistol to Corcoran's head and shot him dead.\" However, when interviewed by Magill last month, December 1997, O'Callaghan would neither confirm nor deny the previous accounts he gave to newspapers on how he murdered John Corcoran. Magill understands he has recently done a volte face on the subject and is now privately denying that he murdered John Corcoran. Earlier this month, on 5 January, Eileen Corcoran, widow of John Corcoran, spoke to RTE's Pat Kenny on his morning radio show about her frustration over the failure of the gardai to question Mr O'Callaghan about his claims. Mrs Corcoran told Magill that she experienced a great response to the interview. \"So many people came up to me and said they heard me. Many said they never realised what I had been going through until then,\" she said. However, Mrs Corcoran said she was disappointed that the gardai had not contacted her following her interview with Pat Kenny. CI\n\nUrsula Halligan\n\nEnvironmental Campaigners Descend on the Four Courts\n\nby Iva Pocock\n\no\n\nm\n\n()\n\nO\n\nn Wednesday 21 January, the sound of bongo drums and fire jugglers could be heard through the first-floor windows of High Court 10 above the monotonous drone of Dublin's quayside traffic. Outside, over' 100 people had gathered in support of the so-called ecowarriors who have been living in the trees of the Glen of the Downs for over seven months. One of them, computer technician Dermot Murphy, was downstairs in Court 5 seeking leave to apply for a judicial review of Wicklow County Council's roadwidening plan. He was joined in court by an eclectic bunch of tree-dwellers who were injuncted a week earlier from entering the \"cut zone\" in return for an undertaking by Wicklow County Council not to fell any more trees. Throughout the day, there was a steady stream of colourful ecologists traipsing through the Four Courts, an unusual sight in a place dominated by drab legal garb and, with soldiers seeking and defending claims for deafness, army uniforms. The Glen supporters included a number of people who were in the court that day\n\nz -c I -c z\n\n(/)\n\n'what they consider to be inadequate environmental protection. While the challenge to seek a judicial review of the Glen of the Down's road-widening scheme and the judicial review of the EPA's toxicwaste-incineration licence are being taken by individuals, the Glen Ding case was, unusually, brought by a limited company, the Blessington Heritage Trust. In ruling that the trust had locus standi to move legal proceedings against Wicklow County Council, Justice McGuinness set a clear precedent for environmental campaigners that work for a limited company. If a company is shown to have a track record in environmental issues, it does not have to own property in order to take legal proceedings to protect the landscape. Her ruling follows the controversial case surrounding the Hilton Hotel in Dublin, where an off-the-shelf company, Lancefort Ltd., was ruled to have locus standi because of its directors' proven commitment to architectural conservation. The ruling in the Glen Ding case is just the latest twist in a long saga that, according to Frank Corcoran of Blessington Heritage\n\nj; z\n\n(/)\n\nI\n\n» z » I\n\n» z\n\n« I\n\nZ\n\no w o\n\n:s\n\nfighting other cases of environmental significance. Indeed, the warriors' music seemed fitting on the opening day of proceedings challenging the Environmental Protection Agency's decision to grant an integrated pollution-control licence to Roche Ireland for incinerating their toxic waste-and on the day when Justice McGuinness ruled that Wicklow County Council's rezoning of Glen Ding Wood for quarrying was invalid. All three cases are being taken by a number of environmental activists who have resorted to the courts in seeking to rectify\n\nTrust, is set to continue. The actions of both Wicklow County Council officials and elected councillors in relation to Glen Ding are extraordinary. In 1996, Tommy Cullen, then chairman of the council, had to take a High Court case in order to get access to files relating to Glen Ding, placing his farm as security for the case. In September 1996, during a monthly meeting of the county council, Councillor Cullen proposed an amendment to include the original amenity zoning for Glen Ding within the draft Blessington development plan. Councillor Ruttle, Cullen's successor\n\nas chairman of Wicklow County Council, disallowed the amendment, a move that Judge McGuinness last week ruled was a breach of the council's own standing orders. That Wicklow County Council was under attack for its attempts to clear part of the Glen of the Downs on the same day as the council chairman was found to have breached his own standing order_s is considered by some environmental campaigners to be indicative of this council's attitude to environmental protection. But Wicklow County Council is not the only state authority entrusted with powers of environmental protection facing legal proceedings. The four-year-old Environmental Protection Agency is also under attack in the courts with two' judicial reviews of EPA procedure ongoing. The first is challenging the EPA's licensing of the first-ever genetically engineered crop in Ireland, in this case Monsanto's genetically engineered sugar beet. The most recent judicial review IS that taken by Clare resident Orla Ni Eili over the licensing of Roche Ireland's toxic-waste incinerator, near Ennis. One of the arguments in this case is that the EPA acted unreasonably in granting a licence in light of the evidence of adverse health effects caused by dioxin emissions from the incinerator. This claim is denied by the EPA. Depending on the outcome, this may have implications for deployment of EPA resources to ensure that medical expertise is available for determining when human health is being endangered by environmental pollution .• • Iva Pocock is co-ordinator of environmental organisation VOICE. MAGILL the 9\n\nYesterday FM\n\nadio Ireland was revamped and relaunched in January as 100 to 102 Today FM. The station's owners will spend £1 million over the next year in a bid to boost the station's listenership, which stood at 1 per cent of the national audience in the JNLR figures published last August. At present, the station is losing £250,000 a month. A new music-driven schedule hopes to win the all-important daytime housewife market. The new-look Today FM begs two questions. First, will the Independent Radio and Television Commission and, for that matter, the losing bidders for the original licence allow the station to renege on its mandate without mounting a legal challenge? And, second, is there room for Today FM in a segment of the radio market already well catered for? Today FM during the day is now indistinguishable from the Dublin-only 98FM. \"Imitation is the best form of flattery,\" says Ken Hutton, station manager at 98FM. \"From the breakfast show until Eamon Dunphy comes on at five, their output is very similar to ours. Even the new promotions-driven marketing campaign apes 98FM.\" Producers and presenters at Today FM bridle at terms like \"dumbing down\" and \"infotainment,\" but the transformation of its output is undeniable. At its launch, the station went head to head with RTE Radio\n\nR\n\nradio market seems unassailable. Under the 1988 Radio and Broadcasting Act, the commission has an arsenal of powers at its disposal that it could use to unravel the ad hoc re-working of Today FM. The commission can monitor the programming of the station, conduct its own market research and suspend or terminate the station's contract at its discretion. At a board meeting late III January, the commission agreed to give the station one month to make changes to its output. The new Daybreak programme, for example, does not meet the criterion of half music and half talk, 50 per cent of which must be current 'affairs. The news content has been gutted in favour of music. If Today FM does strike a deal with the IRTC, losing bidders for the licence may take legal action. Dermot Hanrahan, head of FM104 and a shareholder in one of the losing consortia, is already considering a challenge. But Hanrahan concedes that the station must face commercial realities: \"You have to roll your sleeves up and do whatever it takes to stay in business. No one came closer to the knacker's-yard gate than us,\" he says, referring to FM104's early trials. \"Today FM must win over the daytime housewife listeners in Dublin,\" he says. Outside Dublin, a patchwork of strong local stations will be difficult, if not impossible, to compete with. The two RTE stations, which remain strong in Dublin, quickly lose out in\n\nSlap Attpaction ... Eamon Dunphy\n\n\"\n\n. 1, offering an \"intelligent\" alternative. Now the station is vying with 2FM, 98FM and 23 local radio stations outside the capital for listeners between 25 and 44 years of age. Conflicting noises are coming from the IRTC. Within the commission, the belief that Ireland does not need another music station is tempered by the commercial logic that Radio l's grip on the middle-brow talkMAGLLL 10\n\nthe rest of the country to the locals. The JNLR figures give RTE Radio 1 and 2FM 54 per cent of the national audience, while all local radio has an audience of 45 per cent. Some local stations have an even larger share. Highland Radio, for example, has 70 per cent of the local market in Donegal. However, the Dublin market, is already served by two independent music stations,\n\n98FM and FM104 (which targets a younger audience). \"There is no gap in the market for Today FM in its new format,\" says John Purcell, the chairman of the Association of Independent Radio Stations. \"The IRTC has to decide if there is room for a properly marketed alternative to Radio 1 and use its powers accordingly.\" Goodwill towards the station on the part of advertisers has quickly evaporated. \"I don't know any advertising agency that will put its reputation on the line by recommending a client buys advertising space on Today FM,\" says Liam Gaskin, at advertising agency Watermarque (which is retained by 2FM). The spectre of a new owner stepping in, without even a diluted commitment to public-service broadcasting, looms ever larger. \"Scottish Radio [already a minority shareholder in the station] may be waiting in the wings for Today FM to go belly up,\" says Purcell at AIRS. Another potential buyer, Denis O'Brien, the chairman of 98FM, is already said to have held talks with minority shareholders in Today FM about buying their stakes. Regardless of who owns it, most experts agree that Today FM cannot afford to have listener figures of less than 10 per cent by August if it is to stay in business. Century Radio, Today FM's ill-starred predecessor, had 16 per cent of the market when it went out of business eight years ago, up from 10 per cent at its launch . The next set of JNLR figures is not due for release until August, 1998. The interim will determine whether Today FM survives. The rival station that potentially has the most to lose from a successful Today FM is reserving judgement. Will Today FM see the year out? \"Only time will tell,\" says the boss of 2FM, Bill O'Donovan. The answer seems generous in the circumstances.

The first has to do with political motivation and responsibility for the massacre, the second with the possibility that a subsequent cover-up was organised at the highest level within the British political and legal establishments. The facts suggest as a likelihood that the military operation was approved in advance by representatives of both the Northern Ireland and British governments and mounted in order to shore up the Stormont administration headed by Mr Brian Faulkner and that, thereafter, the lord chief justice of England conspired for political reasons to conceal or distort the truth and thus to pervert the course of justice. There are no foreseeable circumstances in which a British government would sanction an inquiry that it was aware might establish these likelihoods as fact. In other words, there is currently no possibility of the key demand of the families of the victims being met. Twenty-six years on, the Bloody Sunday issue is as far from resolution as ever. Bloody Sunday was so hugely shocking at the time, and has echoed so distinctively\n\nand ominously down the years since, that it has come to be seen almost as an event on its own, as if having happened in isolation from the political context of its time. But the pressure that produced the spasm of evil around Rossville Street on 30 January 1972 had been generated from deep within the North's political system. The parliament at Stormont, which the Unionist Party had dominated for 51 years, was beleagured from without and disintegrating from within. The specific likely purpose of the Bloody Sunday operation will have been to thwart the perceived threat to Stormont rule posed by what was happening in Derry. The 30 January march was in opposition to internment without trial, which had been introduced by Mr Faulkner, home-affairs minister as well as prime minister, under Stormont's Special Powers Act the previous August. The march was illegal, all parades having also been banned in August. Mr Faulkner's extreme-unionist critics had welcomed internment but were angered that the blanket nature of the ban curtailed Orange processions, too. Internment so enraged the Catholic working-class areas from which most\n\ninternees were drawn that many-and some not for the first time-instantly became \"no-go areas\" for the RUC and British army. The largest and most obdurate was the 30,000-strong Bogside-Creggan district of Derry. The 30 January march was scheduled to begin in the Creggan and to weave through the Bogside before proceeding to Guildhall Square in the city centre. It promised to be the biggest in a series of marches that had begun on Christmas day with a demonstration from the outskirts of Belfast to the gates of the Long Kesh internment camp. In the four weeks before Bloody Sunday, there were nine illegal anti-internment marches across the North. Mr Faulkner was constantly challenged on the issue by dissidents within his own party, such as William Craig, and by the Reverend Ian Paisley, of the recently formed Democratic Unionist Party. Internment, they complained, had not made the state more secure. The law was openly being flouted on a vast scale. If \"drastic\" action wasn't taken; warned Mr Craig on 16 January, \"there will be determined loyalist action to sweep weak leadership away.\" On 22 January, an anti-internment march in Armagh was scattered by British soldiers firing CS gas and rubber bullets. On the same day, a march to a newly opened prison camp at Magilligan in Co Derry was beaten and kicked into disarray by soldiers, including men of the First Battalion of the Parachute Regiment bussed in from near Belfast. Civil rights leaders complained about soldiers putting the boot in. But as far as Faulkner's far-right critics were concerned, he was still pussyfooting around. As Armagh and Magilligan marchers nursed their bruises on the way home, the Grand Amalgamated Committee of the Orange Order, the Royal Black Preceptory and the Apprentice Boys of Derry was meeting in Lurgan. Unimpressed by the security forces' performance earlier in the day, they issued a threat of Orange marches in defiance of the ban if a stop wasn't put to the anti-internment protests: \"In the absence of a clear demonstration of [the ban's] effectiveness, the government can hardly expect our people to observe it.\" At Stormont the following Tuesday, 25 January, Ulster Unionist MPs Robert Mitchell and John Laird defied the party whip and voted for a motion jointly proposed by Mr Craig and Dr Paisley condemning the application of the ban to parades by the \"loyal orders.\" On the same evening, the Derry branch of the DUP called for action against the Bogside-Creggan\"The Queen's writ must run in all parts of our city\"-and announced a \"prayer meeting\" in Guildhall Square at 3.00 p.m. the following Sunday to coincide with the\n\n\"The facts suggest as a likelihood that the military operation was approved in advance ... to shore up the Stormont administration headed by Mr Brian Faulkner and that, thereafter, the lord chief justice of England conspired for political reasons to conceal or distort the truth and thus to pervert the course of justice. \"\n\nMAGILL 15\n\nscheduled arrival of the march. The statement ended with a plea: \"Where are the men at the top? Why are they so silent? What are they waiting for?\" The following evening, Mr Craig enthused a packed rally at the Apprentice Boys Hall in Derry, contemptuously contrasting the fumbling of Faulkner with the tough leadership that would have been forthcoming from true men like Edward Carson. Loyalists, he declared, \"must find new leaders and go into action.\" He announced a series of demonstrations to begin the following week, to culminate in a \"monster rally\" in Belfast on 18 March. Nineteen-seventy-two would be \"loyal Ulster's year of decision.\"\n\nReginald Maudling-responsible for Northern Ireland affairs-Defence Secretary Lord Carrington, Leader of the Commons William Whitelaw, and the joint chiefs of staff. This group, minus the joint chiefs of staff, also constituted the cabinet's Northern Ireland Committee. It is likely that the Derry march featured at this meeting, too: during the Commons debate in April 1992 on presentation of the Widgery Report, Heath was to reveal that \"cabinet ministers\" had been aware of the plans for handling the Derry march. The next day, 29 January, the RUC and the British army issued a joint statement: \"Experience this year has already shown that attempted marches often end in vio-\n\nAt 8.30 the following morning, the first two RUC men to lose their lives in Derry in the Troubles, Peter Gilgun, 26, married with an 18-month-old son, and David Montgomery, 20, were killed in a Provo ambush as their car travelled along Cregg an Road at the edge of the no-go area. There was now, naturally, even more intense outrage in the calls for harsher security action. As the two policemen drove into the ambush, Mr Faulkner was en route to London, possibly ruminating on the meeting of the Stormont Joint Security Committee, which he had chaired the previous night. It had been attended by the general officer commanding British troops in the North, Lieutenant General Harry Tuzo, RUC Chief Constable G~aham Shillington, Junior Home Affairs Minister John Taylor and a British government official. It is likely, to put it no higher, that the handling of the Derry march had been the main item on the agenda. In London, Mr Faulkner addressed a meeting of industrialists on the investment attractions of Northern Ireland, and then met for more than an hour with Prime Minister Edward Heath at Downing Street before flying home. On the following morning, Friday 28 January, Mr Heath presided .at a meeting of his cabinet's Defence and Overseas Committee, attended by Home Secretary\n\nlence and [sic] must have been foreseen by the organisers. \"Clearly, the responsibility for this violence and the consequences of it must rest fairly and squarely on the shoulders of those who encourage people to break the law. The security forces have a duty to take action against those who set out to break the law.\" That afternoon, the Democratic Unionists announced the cancellation of their \"prayer meeting\": \"We have been assured that the civil rights march will be halted by force ifneeessary. We are prepared to give the government a final opportunity to demonstrate their integrity and honour their promise, but warn that if they fail in this undertaking they need never again ask loyalist people to forfeit their basic right of peaceful and legal assembly.\" The same afternoon, a run-of-the-mill riot in William Street shuddered to a halt when a local man, Peter McLaughlin, was hit in the shoulder by a single shot fired by a soldier stationed on a rooftop about 100 yards away. As the street cleared, another man, Peter Robson, ran out to help. As he bent over McLaughlin, another shot from the rooftop on the Strand Road struck him in the shoulder and passed through his body less than half an inch from his spine. Within an hour, the British army had issued a press state-\n\nment claiming that the two men had been throwing nail-bombs. They had fallen a few yards from the spot where Damien Donaghey and John Johnston, the first casualties of Bloody Sunday, were to be shot the next day. Neither man was ever questioned or charged in relation to the nail-bomb allegation. Late the same night, at their home on Westway, Creggan, Peter Robson's brother Terry, having driven from Belfast upon hearing of the shooting and noted military vehicles on the move in unusual numbers, remarked: \"There's something really odd about all this. Something's up.\" Bloody Sunday has been a bitter and emotional factor in Northern politics for 26 years, but it didn't become a mainstream issue or begin to figure in Anglo-Irish relations until the early 1990s. The relatives' organisation, the Bloody Sunday Justice Campaign (BSJC), was formed in 1992, when activities around the 20th anniversary of the massacre brought representatives of the 14 families together for the first time. Until then, the annual commemoration march, the upkeep of a memorial in the Bogside and sporadic propaganda activity had been organised by the Bloody Sunday Initiative, a loose group with a shifting, largely republican membership. It was a measure of the difficulty of winning mainstream support until recently that when this writer travelled to Dublin in January 1992 with a number of relatives of the victims for the publication of the book Bloody Sunday in Derry, written to mark the 20th anniversary, only one TD, Tony Gregory, attended the launch in Buswell's Hotel, across the street from Leinster House, although every member of the Oireachtas had been individually invited. It has since been helpful that the founding of the BSJC coincided with the inception of the peace process, which has required the southern authorities to be seen representing the concerns of northern nationalists. Interest in Bloody Sunday has been significantly boosted, too, by new evidence that has come to light in the last two years. Thus the sense of momentum that has given some\n\n\" The RUC and the British army issued a joint statement: 'Clearly, the responsibility for this violence and the consequences of it must rest fairly and squarely on the shoulders of those who encourage people to break the law. ' , ,\n\ncampaigners confidence that the truth is imminently to be acknowledged by the British authorities. But in fact, the more clearly the truth emerges, the uglier it seems, and the less likely that the British government will agree to look it in the face. Given the context set out above, it will strike many as common sense that the Bloody Sunday operation was intended to strengthen the position of Prime Minister\n\nMAGILL\n\n16\n\nFaulkner and stave off Stormont's collapse. Direct evidence might be found in the minutes of the meetings at Stormont on 26 January and two days later at Downing Street. At the Widgery hearings, James McSparran QC, for the relatives, raised this with the commander of land forces in the North, Major General Robert Ford: McSparran: \"Before the brigade orders were prepared, it had been discussed by the Security Committee and it had been discussed by the cabinet ministers III England?\" Widgery: \"That is not a question for the general.\" McSparran: \"Could I ask him does he know if it had been discussed?\" Widgery: \"No.\" That Widgery's exclusion of the political background was itself politically motivated is suggested by the minutes of an extraordi-\n\n\" Some campaigners are confident that the truth is imminently to be acknowledged by the British authorities. But in fact, the more clearly the truth emerges, the uglier it seems, and the less likely that the British government will agree to look it in the face. \"\n\nnary discussion between Widgery, Heath and the lord chancellor, Lord Hailsham, at Downing Street two days after the massacre, on the evening before the Commons announcement of Widgery's appointment to conduct the inquiry. Among \"a number of points to which [Heath] thought it right to draw to the lord chief justice's attention [was that] it had to be remembered that we were in Northern Ireland fighting not just a military war but a propaganda war.\" Heath is also recorded saying that Derry Guildhall would be unsuitable as a venue for tribunal hearings, being \"on the wrong side of the River Foyle.\" The Guildhall is on the mainly Catholic west bank of the Foyle. Widgery himself \"saw the exercise as a fact-finding exercise .. .It would help if the inquiry could be restricted to what actually happened in those few minutes when men were shot and killed; this would enable the tribunal to confine evidence to eye witnesses.\" In the event, Widgery confined himself to the evidence of some eye witnesses, refusing to hear the evidence of others. In writing his report, he then ignored much of the evidence that he had heard and distorted a great deal of the rest: an examination of the text rules out the possibility of this having come about through misunderstanding, carelessness or unconscious bias. In the days after Bloody Sunday, the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association gathered more than 700 eye-witness statements from civilians in Derry. Copies of\n\nthese were presented to Widgery on 9 March. But instead of welcoming this reservoir of relevant information, Widgery, according to an internal tribunal memorandum dated 10 March, \"considered that the statement ... had been submitted at this late stage to cause him the maximum embarrassment. \" In fact, the three-inch-thick file of statements had been delivered to the Treasury Solicitor's Office in London on 3 March, 34 days after the event and 17 days before the tribunal's final public sitting. A delay of about a week had been caused by disagreement among relatives and others about whether to co-operate with the tribunal at all. The 10 March memorandum records that \"only 15\" of the statements were \"drawn to [Widgery's] attention.\" It is not clear whether Widgery himself actually read any of these 15 statements. But on the basis of this knowledge, he is recorded saying of all 700 statements that he did not \"think that the people who wrote them could bring any new element to the proceedings.\" The statements were discarded. The NICRA dossier was discovered by writer Don Mullan three years ago, in a plastic bag in the office of a civil rights group in Derry, and forms the basis of his book, published a year ago, Eye-witness Bloody Sunday. What mostly gave the book its huge impact were the repeated references in the 100 statements reproduced verbatim to shots fired from the City Walls where they beetle over the Bogside. The evidence selected by Widgery had either been unspecific on the point or told only of shots fired from ground level within the Bogside. Campaigners now argue that this factor on its own invalidates Widgery's conclusions and makes the case for a new inquiry. It emerged that there had been other evidence available suggesting firing from the walls. In January last year, Channel 4 News broadcast tapes of British army and RUC communications recorded during the shooting by amateur radio enthusiast Jim Porter. Soldiers clearly identified as being on the walls are heard reporting incoming fire, firing and claiming \"hits.\" Mr Porter recalled offering his tapes to the tribunal and being rebuffed on the ground that the recording of radio communications without appropriate authorisation is illegal. Additionally, Channel 4 and Mullan separately presented expert evidence from the post-mortem results that at least three of the victims had been shot from a height and not from ground level. Widgery also rejected an. offer of eVIdence from former Derry mayor Dr\n\nRaymond McClean, who had pronounced four of the victims dead in the Bogside and attended all 13 post-mortems at Altnagelvin Hospital. He would have given his opinion that at least one man and possibly two others had been shot from high above. Widgery completed his mission with remarkable dispatch. The hearing of evidence and legal submissions was completed\n\nin under 100 hours, spread over 17 days between 21 February and 14 March. He heard 114 witnesses-37 people from Derry, including 7 priests; 21 journalists/photographers; 5 named and 35 unnamed British soldiers; 8 police officers; 6 doctors or forensic experts; and 2 other civilians, including Lord Fenner Brockway, one of the scheduled speakers at the intended Guildhall Square rally. Widgery delivered his report to Home Secretary Maudling on 10 April. It was published on 18 April-71 days after the incident under investigation, It runs to 39 pages. All this can be taken as indicating a cavalier approach to his task by a man who, far from high-mindedly seeking out the truth, regarded himself as being on a political mission and had his mind already made up how best to accomplish the objective. The indication is even clearer from looking at examples of Widgery's handling of the evidence that he did choose to hear, for example relating to the key moment when paratroopers opened fire in the courtyard of Rossville Flats and shot dead 17-year-old Jackie Duddy, the young man seen in a much-used film clip being carried dying through British lines by a group of men including Dr Edward Daly. Lord Widgery heard from eight members. of Support Company of 1 Para, who told MAGILL 17\n\n\" Widgery confined himself to the evidence of some eye witnesses, refusing to hear the evidence of others. In writing his report, he then ignored much of the evidence that he had heard and distorted a great deal of the rest. \"\n\nthat they had come under fire as they debussed from an armoured personnel carrier (APC) in the flats' courtyard, intending to arrest \"hooligans.\" However, every soldier's account of the hostile fire contradicted every other soldier's account. The fog of battle hardly accounts for the discrepancies. Sergeant 0 told of around 80 shots being fired in this enclosed space in the course of two to three minutes from different calibre weapons. Lieutenant N, on the other hand, couldn't recall any civilian gunfire at all. Major 236 described \"continuous firing\" not for two to three but for ten minutes. Lance Corporal V heard only single-shot rifle-fire. And so on. Some of the soldiers took cover behind the APC, a bulkier vehicle than, say, a Ford Transit van. But not only did the blizzard of bullets miss the sheltering soldiers, it missed the APC .... Dunne, a school-teacher, now headmaster of a large primary school. All were adamant that the soldiers' account of gunfire was total fabrication: no shots had been fired at the paras, they hadn't had to take cover, and so on. Widgery professed himself \"entirely satisfied\" that the paras had come under fire and had fired back only in self-defence, and that it was in these circumstances that Jackie Duddy had been shot dead and Michael Bridge, Michael Bradley, Peggy Deery, Patrick McDaid and Alana Burke wounded. He explained: \"Such a conclusion is not reached by counting heads or by selecting any particular witness as truthful in preference to another. It is a conclusion gradually built up over many days\"-three, actually-\" of listening to evidence and watching the demeanour of witnesses under cross-examination. \" Nowhere in his report does Widgery compare the two hugely conflicting stories. The reference to the \"demeanour\" of witnesses is his entire account of his process of reasoning. He offers no explanation for the remarkable level of disagreement between the soldiers. There is a hint at his underlying approach in the deadpan observation that \"there was no reason why they should have ... begun to shoot unless they had come under fire themselves.\" The same approach led to other crucial finding by Widgery, including that \"on the balance of probabilities\" Gerald Donaghey, 17, had four nailbombs in his pockets when shot in Glenfada Park. Much has been made of this case by defenders of the Bloody Sunday operation and by those arguing there was \"blame on both sides.\" It was the only case in which a weapon of any kind had allegedly been found on the body of a victim. (All others had been \"spirited away.\") The nail-bomb evidence came from a bomb-disposal officer, Soldier 127, who told Widgery that shortly after the shooting he had been called to Craigavon Bridge to examine a car containing a body. He noted two nail-bombs protruding from the jeans pockets, and two from the jacket pockets of a dead youth. Each of the nail-bombs, he said, was\" a bout the size of a cocoa tin.\" He summoned a police photographer and a Times reporter to note the nail-bombs. Both gave evidence confirming that the nailbombs were in Donaghey's pockets when they arrived at the car. Widgery heard evidence from two civilians who had carried the wounded Donaghey into the Glenfada Park home of Raymond Rogan, chairman of the local tenants' association. The two described his tight-fitting jeans and denim jacket, and said they saw no nail-bombs. Leo Young described searching Donaghey's jacket pockets for identification after they'd laid him down in the Rogan home. There had been no nail-bombs. Donaghey was examined in the house by Dr Kevin Swords of Lincoln Hospital, who had been in Derry visiting relatives. He gave evidence of loosening Donaghey's clothes to examine a gunshot wound in his abdomen and then \"going over his whole body\" for other wounds. He noticed no nail-bombs. Charlie Hazlett, a reporter with the Belfast Telegraph for more than 20 years, sheltering in the Rogan home, said he watched closely as Dr Swords examined Donaghey. He noted no nail-bombs. Mr Rogan carried the dying Donaghey in his arms to his car and eased him into the rear seat. No nail-bombs. Leo Young sat into the rear seat and cradled Donaghey as they set off. Still no nail-bombs. At Barrack Street, the car was stopped by a military patrol and Rogan and Young ordered out. A soldier drove the car to a first-aid post on Craigavon Bridge. Here,\n\n\" Far from high-mindedly seeking out the truth, Widgery regarded himself as being on a political mission and had his mind already made up how best to accomplish the objective. \"\n\nDonaghey was examined by a medical officer from the First Anglian Regiment, who gave evidence of examining the body before pronouncing Donaghey dead. He noticed no nail-bombs. Shortly afterwards, when Soldier 127 summoned the police photographer and John Charteris of the Times, the nail-bombs were, literally, sticking out. Charteris told the tribunal that he could see one of them clearly from outside the car, protruding from Donaghey's denim-jacket pocket. It is scarcely to exaggerate, and not at all facetious, to speculate that a 10-year-old of average intelligence could work out what happened here. But Lord Widgery concluded that the nail-bombs had probably been in Donaghey's pockets all along. Donaghey\n\n1;>;,\n\nWidgery heard evidence from six civilians about events in the flats' courtyard. They were Father (later Bishop) Edward Daly; Simon Winchester, a journalist then with the Guardian; Mary Bonnor, a resident of the flats; Derrick Tucker, an Englishman living in Derry who had seen service with both the Royal Navy and the RAF; Joseph Doherty, an unemployed man from the Creggan estate; and Francis MAGILL 18\n\nhad probably been a.nail-bornber, The paras had probably had the right to kill him. The demands of the BSJC, drawn up early in 1992, are for a clear declaration of the innocence of all the victims, the repudiation of the Widgery Report, and the prosecution of those responsible for the shootings. Campaigners stress that they are not out for personal revenge. \"I'm not fixated on having a 60-year-old Brit put in prison for murdering my father,\" says Tony Doherty, whose father, Patrick, was shot dead at Joseph Place. \"What I want is the complete truth.\" It is the demand for a formal renunciation of the tribunal's conclusions that raises the need for a new inquiry. \"No matter what apology is made or what sort of 'review' is offered, until the British government formally repudiates Widgery's report, his findings will remain on the record as the official truth of what took place,\" says Tony Doherty. \"That's an insult. We will not accept it. \"The repudiation of Widgery would logically involve establishing a new inquiry. And after Widgery, we are justified in insisting on an independent element, whether an international panel of judges or whatever. We want all the available evidence made public and examined objectively. That includes any evidence of political motivation.\" The most obvious explanation of what happened in Derry is that the paras were deployed either to entice the IRA into battle or in the expectation that they would anyway be confronted by IRA members intent on battle, the plan being to inflict a major\n\ndefeat on the republican forces and thereby shatter the resistance of the \"Free Derry\" no-go area while teaching the illegal antiinternment marchers a lesson in law and order they would remember for a long time-long enough for Mr Faulkner to staunch the haemorrhage of support to Craig-Paisley and to consolidate his position at Stormont. Given the certainty of thousands of marchers in the vicinity, any such plan would have involved a reckless disregard for civilian life. The paras were not policemen. Recalling the events in a BBC documentary broadcast in January 1992, the commander of 1 Para, Lieutenant Colonel Derek Wilford, put it plain: \"When we moved on the streets, we moved as if we in fact were moving against a well-armed, well-trained army.\" Reporting the publication of the Widgery Report in April 1992, the Sunday Times's Insight team claimed that the plan of action for 30 January had been approved in advance by the Northern Ireland Committee of the British cabinet-because it carried an \"obvious\" risk of casualties. This was the obvious possibility James McSparran had continued to pursue at the tribunal. \"Do you know if the question of firing in the course of the arrest operation was discussed by the Security Committee?\" he asked: Ford: cc •• .I do read the minutes .. .I can recall that the Joint Security Committee did take note of a comment made by the GOC and the chief constable that it was possible that the events in Londonderry ... might lead to shooting by the IRA.\" After an exchange about the standing instructions governing return of fire,\n\nMcSparran tried to return to his key question: \"Did the operation which you carried out in the Bogside and in Derry ... conform, in your view; to the tenor of the instructions issued by the Joint Security Committee?\" Widgery: \"No, you need not answer that.\" But from the point of view of the relatives, this brings up precisely what needs answering. Under the Public Records Act (1958), the minutes of both Stormont and Westminster cabinet committees are released after 30 years unless specific reasons, usually \"national security,\" are adduced for keeping them closed. In the normal course of events, then, the Bloody Sunday files should be opened in 2003. But the 1958 act also provides for a decision by the lord chancellor to release such papers at any time. The current lord chancellor, Derry Irvine, could, with the approval of Tony Blair, take an executive decision to order the publication forthwith of all papers relevant to Bloody Sunday. This, in itself, might go a long way towards answering the questions that must be disposed of before the relatives can put the grief of Bloody Sunday behind them. On the other hand, publishing the papers might suggest-and a new inquiry might show clearly-why Lord Widgery averted his eyes from some of the evidence and distorted some of the rest so as knowingly to reach conclusions at variance with the truth. The truth about Bloody Sunday, which the relatives desperately need to know, may go so deep into the heart of British politics and law as to be mortally dangerous to the authority of the state.

It's therefore all the more surprising to read an article by you in the Tablet in which your critique of the Catholic Church and the Catholic hierarchy is in many ways as vehement as a critique you'd expect from Free Presbyterians. Why is that? Mary McAleese: Well, the difference between the two events you are referring to, an event in 1984 and an event in, I think, 1997. There's been quite a trajectory of development and thinking in the meantime, both on my own part, I suppose, and on the part of the Church as well. It will come as no surprise to anybody to know that the hierarchy have been under quite an amount of critiquing for quite some time now, coming at them from a variety of sources. But I think perhaps the strongest source of ongoing criticism or critiquing has come from within Christian feminism, and I count myself among that happy band of people who would regard themselves as Christian feminists. I think that it certainly shouldn't shock anybody that there's an impatience among women in the Church, who are committed to the Church, at what they perceive as a certain unwillingness, even at this late stage, to enter into the kind of dialogue one might have expected to have been entered into by now. If you look back at the kind of things we were hearing after Vatican II, and in particular some of the comments of Pope Paul VI, who talked about the need to engage women in dialogue and who talked very openly about the fact that women's talents and giftedness within the Church had not been fully utilised and who looked forward to the day when they might be, I think that people are entitled to feel, perhaps, some sense of impatience that we've just never, we've never opened up that debate-and if anything we've watched the closing down of that debate. You're almost contemptuously dismissive of the present pope in his efforts to apologise on behalf of the Church for the wrongs done to women by the Church. I hope that's not true. I hope that that isn't the tone in which it was written. I don't regard the present pope contemptuously at\n\nall. I have an enormous admiration for him, but also, apart from the great impatience at his failure to engage in a dialogue that he, I think, as an intelligent man, must know is coming at him from, you know, from all areas and all parts. You wrote in the Tablet in March 1997, \"The very fact that this pope has felt it necessary to return frequently in the past few years to the subject of women tells its own story. His words are not those of a man who believes he is on the comfortable side of a debate. Far from it, they are the words of a man who is slowly realising that the citadel's defences have been breached and its once staunch defenders are a declining population.\" I hope that doesn't carry with it a hint of contempt, I wouldn't like that ... Almost a hint of hypocrisy ... On the part of the pope? Yes. Well, I think that what I'm saying there is that the evidence is all around him of a very, very, very loud and vocal and unhappy debate from within the Church. A widespread debate on the issue of the lack of openness that the Church is offering to women and, indeed, to laity generally, but particularly to women. And I think there is a genuine sense of impatience. People have responded, perhaps with some degree of concern, to the way in which over the last year, two years, instead of opening up the debate, we've had the declaration, for example in relation to women and ordination, a declaration that purports to be an infallible doctrine. Now, I could see where a doctrine like that might happen, though I hope it wouldn't happen, but I could see where it might happen after a very long and detailed look at 2,000 years of sexism and the damage that has done to the Church. Particularly when this pope and his predecessor, Pope Paul VI, and indeed John XXIII, all acknowledged that there was a problem, if you like, at the heart of the Church, of sexism. It seems to me once you acknowledge that, it's very important that you then explore it and you ask yourself the question, \"well, what damage has that done, and before we make any decision\n\n(J)\n\na: W\n\n(J)\n\n(L\n\n'a: \"\n\nill ill\n\no\n\nabout how we would go forward, let's understand where we've come from.\" I mean, it's not a question of just doing damage in the Church, It's also done damage to the wider society and done damage particularly to women. That's correct. You've characterised the absorption of women in that sexist culture, in the words of Yeats \"a code of ignoble sedition.\" What's surprising, perhaps, is that you could remain so staunchly with an institution that is so flawed fundamentally.\n\nOf course it's flawed. It's always been flawed. But fundamentally. The Church has been flawed from the very earliest days. I mean, I love the Church. I love it with a tremendous fondness and a determination that I'm going to remain as fond of it as I've always been. Why do you remain fond of an institution that has done such damage? Well, because I look at, you know, at the founding stone on which the Church was first based, the first great apostle, Peter, and\n\nyou know, he was no great shakes. The man was a coward and .a liar according to the gospel, someone who denied Christ ... He was a misogynist as well. Well, and very likely. Certainly, that probably is true. But I also look at what the Church, what is it a repository at the end of the day of, and at the end of the day it's also my spiritual home. I look at the history of the Church. There have been many, many worse epochs than this. There's been far worse hypocrisy in the Church than this. I see it growing as an institution. I see it having enormous influence globally if it can be brought off the learning curve. And there's plenty of evidence that it will eventually be dragged, screaming, up, you know, up the equal-opportunities learning curve. And for me that's very important, because the reach of the Church globally is such that if it once made that option for women, if it once was able to admit in humility that it has been wrong, that it has played its own part and, indeed, it has not been the only agency-it certainly has not monopolised sexism. I mean, it has been a cultural feature right across the globe of many, many cultures, many religions, many. Indeed, many cultures that don't even have an apparent relationship with a strong religious ethos or ethic. And so, I would take that view, that I can patiently waitwell, maybe impatiently wait-for the Church to come up that learning curve, precisely because its reach is so global. And I think the transformative effect once it makes that option for women could be quite stunning. You write in this article in the Tablet, \"Women have observed the enormous drain of heterosexual males from the priesthood and the growing phenomena of gay priests. They are quietly asking what is happening at the core of the call to priesthood that attracts homosexuals in such greater numbers than their proportion\"-in society at large, I assume. You have to read the next bit of that to make sure that you make it clear that I was not being homophobic. Alright. .. Because I'm a very strong ... You deny being homophobic, but ... I am and have been a very strong defender of gay rights. Maybe I will read the next bit: \"These questions are not raised in any homophobic way but are among the raft of questions bobbing to the surface as we struggle to come to terms with the manifest and minds of the model of the priesthood on which the priest-mother alliance was once founded and is now floundering.\" Yes. I don't see how that detracts from the core of the criticism that you make, that it is\n\n\" I would like to see a priesthood that is a healthy a wide variety and across the spectrum, the hum and all sexual orientations. I would be\n\nMAGILL 22\n\nbecoming a priesthood dominated by gay priests. I didn't say that it was dominated by gay priests. Now, I think what's important to say is that the core ... \"The call to the priesthood that attracts homosexuals in such greater numbers.\" I think it is important. I'm bearing in mind you've only read this article five minutes before we started this conversation, and it took me a very long time to put that article together, and every word is balanced and measured. What I'm trying to get across is the changed democracy of priesthood in a very, very short space of time. All of us who lived through the 1970s and the 1980s will know of the enormous drain away and the impact that the debate on celibacy has had on that drain. We also know that-and I suppose it's a matter of public record-the concerns that have been expressed, particularly, for example, in American seminaries about the increased phenomenon of large numbers of young gay men being attracted to the priesthood. Now, I have no difficulty with young gay men being attracted to the priesthood, but that was what I was at pains to point out there. What I am concerned about is what's wrong with priesthood that we are not also able to attract a similar number, in\n\nproportion to their. .. That there is something about the priesthood that is particularly attractive to homosexuals. I don't know, you see. And I pose the question there. I'm not sure what the\n\n\" I used to look around at the very talented, women, and RTE wasn't a place that celebrated the gifts of women to any significant extent at that time.\"\n\nanswer to this perplexing issue is. I'm saying that it's an issue that people have observed, and they are quietly-and I said it therethey are quietly pondering these things and\n\nsaymg, \"well, what direction, down what , vortex is the priesthood being taken?\" Does it matter whether the priesthood is gay or not? Well, it would matter to this extent, that I would- like to see a priesthood that is a healthy priesthood in the sense of being able to attract a wide variety and across the spectrum, the human spectrum, of men and women, of all genders and all sexual orientations. I would be concerned if it was unable to do that. Insofar as it attracts heterosexuals to the priesthood, you could argue with some justification that the people who are attracted are in a large measure dysfunctional. Well, I don't know that to be true. And I would ... Do you suspect that? Is that not part of the point you are making? No, I don't think so. I don't think that is part of the point that I'm making. What I'm saying is that the nature .. .I think it is very important that it's not seen ... this is not really seen an article about .. .in fact that was a small part of an overall article about priesthood. What I'm saying is that the priesthood as we have known it and as I grew up with it has changed so phenomenally and over a very short space\n\nas\n\npriesthood in the sense of being able to attract an spectrum, of men and women, of all genders concerned if it was unable to do that.\"\n\nMAGILL 23\n\n\"If ever anyone was a culture shock, Conor Cruise O'Br man in the process of revising everything that I had kn set in motion a way of looking at Northern Ireland that\n\nof time.

The only questions that I'm raising there really are sort of speaking out of my own heart and of my own experience, saying what is happening at the core of priesthood. Manifestly, there is something wrong with the model of priesthood as we have experienced it. Sounds very anti-clerical. Well, it might, it might. I think the kind of MAGILL 24\n\nI raise that point because in April 1984, at the Lental talk in the Pro Cathedral, you said that the division between northern nationalists and loyalists was no more bitter and no more real than the gulf between Catholic and anti-clerical in Dublin. Ummrn. The gulf between you and the Catholic Church would appear to be at least as large. Well, I hope that's not true. As I say, I am a\n\nvery committed and loving member of the Church. I think the world has moved on very considerably since 1984 .... Do you have any sense of embarrassment at your identification with a hierarchy that you castigate so seriously? Absolutely not. Absolutely not. Absolutely not. I have tremendous admiration for many of our hierarchy. I think that they operate, you know, within a system that of its nature is really very confining, and they find themselves in a kind of situation quite different now from 1984. I mean, the world has moved on very considerably, put them under enormous pressure, not least through the kind of scandals that they've endured, not least because of the growing, if you like, the mainstreaming of issues like Christian feminism. Twenty years ago, 15 years ago, many of these issues were regarded, if you like, as outside the Church rather than within the mainstream of the Church. They've now come firmly inside the mainstream, and I think the world has moved on; particularly the world of the Church has moved on quite phenomenally in the period of 14 years since then. In uala O'Connor's book In Search of a State: Catholics in Northern Ireland, you're quoted as saying, as uttering another criticism of the Church: \"You never hear from them that the bishops, the voice of forgiveness, the person we associate most strongly with forgiveness, was not a churchman at all but the father of a girl who died in Enniskillen.\" Gordon Wilson. \"Are they afraid to say it. I think possibly they are. I am quite happy to say this because I said it to the cardinal\"-that's Cardinal Daly, I assume-\"I've face to face told the bishops of it.\" This is in relation to the Church's teaching on the provos. What did you have in mind then? It's a while back, but I think what I was saying, and I think it is probably as valid today as it was then, is that the ... As I look back on Northern Ireland and as I look back on, you know, the absolutely appalling things that have happened, every atrocity produced a litany of condemnation and righteous condemnation, but the voice that said, you know, \"Father forgive them, for they know not what they do,\" the voice of the gospel, was a very muted, a very, very muted voice, and it always struck me as very strange that when Gordon Wilson spoke those words, you know, it was almost as if he was speaking them for the first time, or as if they were being spoken for the first time, because they seemed to almost stop the moment. I'm sure people know that Gordon Wilson, God rest him, had no easy ride after he uttered those words. There were many people who were offended by what he said and, you know, who sent him hate mail and who told him he had no\n\nien was to me. Here was this extraordinarily arrogant own to be a given and a truth about Irish history, and he we are only now beginning to grow up and grow out of.\"\n\nbusiness forgiving and how dare he forgive. Literally as if he were saying these words for the very first time. And, unfortunately, I think it has been the case that the churches in Northern Ireland have been seen more as part of the problem, in the sense that there's a perception, rightly or wrongly, that they have tended to bleed more when their own side bled-that they have been more concerned with the language of politics than to really preach the gospel emphatically, and I think that is generally true. You were born in Belfast, of course, and brought up in the Ardoyne and experienced a lot the troubles there in the early 1970s. And then you came to live in the South, and particularly while you worked in RTE you were regarded as a \"provo\" very often. I hope that's not true. Where on earth did you get that from? From interviews that you gave yourself. You said that you were treated as though you were a provo. Ah well, we are talking about a very small coterie of people who might have regarded ... who might have used that epithet and, indeed, whom I eventually took to court and sued successfully. That would not have been generally or universally true. But I think you and I both know that in RTE at that time [in the early 1980s] it was a very, very unhealthy place in which to work. It was deeply conspiratorial, and it 'was an extraordinary place to work, and I must say I was probably quite an innocent abroad. I am not now, never have been and, please God, never will be a supporter of IRA violence. Indeed, unlike most of my colleagues in RTE, if in fact not all of them, I had endured that violence, my parents had been victims of it. We had a business that was fire-bombed by the IRA, so why would I have any particular brief for them? But when I came to work in RTE, I was surprised by the level to which, as an institution, it had come to be, effectively, in the grip of people who had very, very, very strong political views and who to some extent appeared to use their power within the media to give voice to those views-and who were very, I think perhaps tragically, dismissive of other people's views. I suppose what I'm saying really, something that I think is generally true of Ireland as a whole, is that it was not a very good listening environment. That when people said something with which you disagreed, instead of listening and trying to understand where that person was coming from, it was always so much easier to label them-and once you've put the label on, you didn't have to deal with what they were saying, you were able to stereotype them, to dismiss it. In this Nuala O'Connor book that I mentioned earlier, you're quoted as saying, \"I'd a dreadful time\"-this was when you were with RTE-\"I'd a dreadful time with the Workers' Party, people whose idea of It wasn't all of the time, but it was certainly a significant part of the time. It wasn't just my experience, it was the experience, I think, of many of us who worked there. I\n\ncoming to the North was to talk to unionist politicians, whom they cultivated in a really obsequious way to talk to other Workers' Party people and then to come back to\n\n\"I see the Church having enormous influence globally if it can be brought off the learning curve. And there's plenty of evidence that it will eventually be dragged, screaming, up the e qua 1-0 PP0 rtu nit ies learning curve.\"\n\nDublin and tell what was happening in the North.\" Was this something that you experienced frequently?\n\nthink it is fairly well documented. I think, actually, you might be one of the people who also documented it very well during that time. It was very unhealthy. Very unhealthy and a very unhappy, personally very unhappy, time for me. I have no problem with cultivating unionist politicians. I think that we should all be cultivated, and I think that part of what we urgently need in Ireland-have needed for some very long time-has been this ability to listen to each other with respect, even if we are hearing things that deeply burn us and hurt us. But in those days that was not what was happening. That was not what was happening. You also said that RTE was a deeply sexist institution. It was dreadfully so. Does that come a surprise to you? Could you explain why you thought that? Well, I felt it. I felt it to be so. How did it manifest itself? Well, I used to look around at the very talented women, and [RTE] wasn't a place that celebrated the gifts of women to any significant extent at that time. It wasn't very affirmative of women, and particularly now, as I look over the last ten or eleven or years-and have done quite a bit of work in the field of equal opportunities-I realise that it badly needed a dose of equalopportunities training. There was just a very poor MAGILL 25\n\nconsciousness, really, about the extent to which women were stereotyped, and their skills and their giftedness were kept corralled effectively. I don't think all that is generally any longer true. I think that there are some marvellous women who have made great contributions now in RTE, but at that time I have to say that it was a very highly sexist environment. It wasn't a very particularly pleasant environment generally, though. By its nature, I think television tends to produce prima donnas, and it also tends to produce a level of, let's say, everyday social intercourse, you know, that can sometimes get quite shrill as an environment. And you need to have a fairly thick skin to endure it. Were you a prima donna? Well now, the awful thing about prima donnas is that they totally, utterly lack any personal insight, so I think you'd have to ask other people about that. I, of course,\n\na: W 0o:\n\nUl\n\nFionnuala O'Connor] where you spoke about Dublin being a very shocking experience, you went on as saying, \"But I went there first when Conor Cruise O'Brien was in the ascendant, and if ever anyone was a culture shock, Conor Cruise O'Brien was to me. Here was this extraordinarily arrogant man in the process of revising everything that I had known to be a given and a truth about Irish history, and he set in motion a way of looking at Northern Ireland that we are only now beginning to grow up and grow out of. Mmmm. So I think it is important to say that that shock, if you like, was, and what I was referring to in the book was the culture shock of coming down from the North in 1975 and coming away from an environment that I really did want to escape, because we had just been through so much personal family pain, and I wanted to make a fresh start.\n\nmorning I was married, two of my very dear friends were murdered on the morning of my wedding. And many, many of my friends-because I lived in Ardoyne-were murdered in sectarian murders, so there would have been a litany of things. Anyone of them happening over a lifetime would produce trauma and would produce stress. At that time, they were happening to so many people, and we came out of an environment, I think, which is inherently stoical, which teaches you to take things on the chin, not to articulate your pain-and particularly when other people around you were suffering and enduring much, much worse than we had endured. I don't think that we dealt with it terribly well. I still don't think that as a community we have dealt with these things terribly well. So that was the background. I was coming away from that, my parents had just left Belfast. They had uprooted after a\n\nJ\n\nI\n\nr\n\n\"\n\nW\n\na: w\n\no\n\nwould tell you no, never. It wouldn't be in my nature. It wasn't a particularly successful period for you career-wise, was it? And therefore I wonder whether your criticisms of RTE now are somewhat coloured by the lack of success. Do you think so? I've never heard that said before. I always thought that I was reasonably successful; I made my own career choices, but I'd be interested to hear what you have to say about it. It's the first time it's ever been put to me in that way. In a passage of the interview [with\n\nWhat was that personal family pain? We endured a lot as a family. We had our home several times attacked in sectarian attacks. My brother, who is profoundly deaf, was very badly assaulted, a murderous attack on him. We had two gentlemen come to our door with sub-machine guns, which they emptied through our windows, and it's only God's mercy that we weren't killed. My father's two businesses were, one of them blown up, the other one fire-bombed. Two pubs. Yes. A young girl killed, a young mother killed in the second explosion. On the\n\nlifetime there, they had uprooted a family of nine children to move to a small village to find peace and tranquillity somewhere. And I then moved on to Dublin, and I came with a great hope and expectation that-and I've said this before-that I thought I was coming, in a sense, to a spiritual and, if you like, political homeland. Now, if that was naivety on my partand I now look on reflection, I had no right to expect that, I had no right to expect that of Dublin-and I suppose when I came and found this extraordinary man, Conor Cruise, who, at the time when he spoke, I\n\n:\n\n\"I have no problem with cultivating unionist politicians. part of what we urgently need in Ireland-have needed to each other with respect, even if we are he\n\nMAGILL 26\n\no\n\nm\n\nJJ\n\nm\n\n(f) \"1J\n\n\"\n\n[1J\n\nJJ\n\n(f)\n\nused to say to people \"he sounds like a unionist,\" and they'd say, \"Oh no, he's an Irish nationalist.\" And then, thankfully, in later life he obliged me by joining the United Kingdom Unionist Party, which helped enormously, but didn't give me much comfort in those days. 'But wasn't the journalism of Conor Cruise O'Brien a very important antidote to the unquestioning nationalist assumptions that we lived with here for so many years? Well, I think it's important to question and challenge, you're quite right to critique, and I don't in any shape or form say that what we lived through was a healthy analysis of Irish nationalism. I think it was very important that we did open it up, explore it, look at its mythologies, look at its language, look at the way in which, you know, it cultivated the cult of martyr, particularly the blood sacrifice. All of that which we've lived with the dreadful legacy of. So yes. On the other hand, I'm not so sure that what was being held up as, if you like, the opposing version was any nearer, if you like, a truth or the truth. But I think that we have kind of stumbled our way to a variety of versions of the truth in the meantime, and I also think about that period that it was a harsh, very harsh period. People roared at each other, you know, across barricades. It\n\nwasn't a seemly debate, it wasn't a courteous debate. It was a very contemptuous debate. I don't think ultimately it conduced to the good of the community, that kind of shrill debate. But you are right to say, yes it is very important, and it still remains important, not to accept the myths and mythologies and the givens of the past. I mean, I think that one of the things that I've become most conscious of in the intervening years has been this need to unlearn so many of the things that we went to an awful lot of bother either to be taught or to learn. What is the main element of what you've unlearnt? I don't think it comes down to one element. I think it comes down to a lot of things, to many, many things-the first process of unlearning is to try and develop an ear for listening to those people who in the past one has been trained really to listen to in a very curious kind of way, because who one is politically opposed to are speaking. Even if you are not actually talking back, you are firing back almost verbal exocets in your head as they speak, you see. Now, I think one of the things that I've tried, successfully or unsuccessfully, to do over the last number of years is to train myself to listen, to understand where they\n\nare coming from, precisely because I would like that same understanding and, if you like, that kind of same respectful listening for where I'm coming from. Given what you and your family experienced when you were in your childhood and early adulthood, were you ever attracted to the republican movement? No. No, I could have been [but] I wasn't, and thanks be to God I wasn't. I think perhaps that's also why the stereotyping of one's political views was so hurtful, because from a very early stage in the troubles, right from the very beginning-I mean, I was born and reared in Ardoyne, lived right through the worst of the times, right through the B Specials, the burning down of homes of people who lived beside me, so there was a lot to be provoked by, there was a lot to be hurt by. And when you're 17 or 18, the passions run high. Naturally, it is attractive to be drawn into that, if you like that vortex of violence. And I'm always very grateful that I wasn't, though a number of people whom I knew and knew well were, but I wasn't. I think one of the reasons for that was that I always had-first of all, I came from a very prayerful home, I came from a home where, you know, religion, and not religiosity but religion, actually did play a\n\nI think that we should all be cultivated, and I think that for some very long time-has been this ability to listen aring things that deeply burn us and hurt us.\"\n\nMAGILL 27\n\n\"In the early 1980s, RTE was a very, very unhealthy pic it was an extraordinary place to work, and I mu\n\npart and where the gospel meant something. And so that side of me was fairly well developed, if you like. The spiritual side of me was fairly well developed, and that's the side that I think kept me, that acted as a simply as meaning that they would be totally overwhelmed; that their viewpoint would simply be subsumed, would be ignored, it would be, you know, wiped away-I think the process of unlearning and spectrum of thought. By and large, Northern Ireland tended to be much more conservative and still, indeed, is much more conservative on both those issues than would be Great Britain generally, and on those issues was much closer to the spectrum of thought that existed in the Republic. I think these are issues that are global; every community, every society faces them and dealswith them and deliberates upon them with the same passion, and exactly the same argument and the same shift of focus as we have experienced here. Except that on the issue of divorce, for instance, the rhetoric of the Catholic Church during the divorce referendum, of the Catholic hierarchy during the divorce referendum, was very much to the effect that their version or their view of the common good is something that ought to be embraced by society as a whole, irrespective of minority views and what might be termed pluralities. Well, I think you'd have to address them on that. I didn't write their scripts for them and, thankfully, that's not a position that I would have ever taken myself; so I think that's a matter that you'd really want to address to them. You flirted with Fianna Fail for quite a long time. Indeed, you were a candidate for ~\n\nm\n\nA\n\n(f)\n\nkind of cantilever to the, you know, the pull of violence. Are you still a nationalist, or has that process of unlearning led you away from nationalism? No, I wouldn't say it's led me away from nationalism, but what it has done, though, is revise the rather crude early perspective that I would have had on nationalism. I\n\n\"We're a very cynical lot, and we've an awful habit of looking back over even the most gifted of people and looking straight for the clay feet.',\n\nwould still regard myself and would define . myself as an Irish nationalist, yes. And then, beyond that, though, when I talk about or when I would talk about, for example, the ambition that is at the heart of Irish nationalism, is for an Ireland that is united. Now, when I was growing up that was a very crude kind of term, and when I realised that the one and a half million unionists who live in Northern Ireland identified that MAGILL 28\n\nthe process of redefining nationalism for me has meant that I now come to the issue of where we're up to, for example, in Northern Ireland as we approach talks, which we hope will lead to consensus, that I have a very open view now about what shape Ireland might take for the future. I'd be very open about the kind of consensus that might come our of a dialogue between nationalists and unionists in Ireland and Britain as to the furure of this island. The old, if you like that old image, that old and rather crude concept of a united Ireland, the words, the concept that is raised by that image I think, no longer fits the profile of where a modern Ireland would like to go to. I think that we have to be open to the possibility that what we're looking at is quite a complex set of arrangements. That complex set of arrangements would inevitably involve a respect for other values and of other ideals. Have you in political positions you've taken on issues, such as divorce and abortion, been sensitive to those considerations. I'm not too sure to what extent they play into the issue of Catholic versus Protestant or nationalism versus unionism. Funnily enough, I don't regard those, fundamentally, as fWO issues that touch on the issue of nationalism and unionism. I know they can be perceived as such, because of what is perceived as being the confessional nature of the Irish state, but, for example, even in Northern Ireland I was deeply conscious of the fact that in relation to divorce we never followed the British. The law that applied in Great Britain was always aeons further down the line than in Northern Ireland, because there was a\n\n(f)\n\n\" Ii\n\nm\n\nFianna Fail. You call that flirting; now, you must have confused this expression \"flirting.\" How would you describe it? I joined Fianna Fail. Held hands ... Held hands? You ran for the party in 1987 in Dublin,\n\nce in which to work. It was deeply conspiratorial, and st say I was probably quite an innocent abroad.\"\n\nand in the run-up to that you described Eamon de Valera as the greatest visionary Ireland has had. Mmmmm. That was very far-fetched. Was it? Sure, we all say those sorts of things in a moment ... When we're looking for a nomination ... .. .In a moment. May I say, I do have great admiration for Eamon de Valera. Enormous admiration for him. Is it still your view that he was the greatest visionary Ireland ever had? I think he was a tremendous visionary, yes. But Ireland .. .I mean, it depends on your time scale, you know, it really does depend on the time scale. There are new visionaries will have emerged, but I wouldn't take from him. No, I would not take from him what he achieved, and leaving it back I think one of the difficulties-isn't it, you know, ipso facto-looking back over history [is that] we're a very cynical lot, and we've an awful habit of looking back over people's, you know, even the most gifted of people and looking straight for the clay feet. I think, taken in the round, yes, he was a visionary and, yes, he made an enormous contribution ... You also said around that time about Charles Haughey, \"Yes, I do admire the man, and my husband, Martin, is a relentless Charlie fan. I admire in him predominantly his staying power and ability not to cave in in the face of the relentless pursuit of him by the media and, indeed, from within his own party. I also have a very deep admiration for anyone whom the British government fears, and I'm sure they fear Charlie.\" . Mmmm. Do you now have the same opinion of him? Well, now. We're all an awful lot older and an awful lot wiser, Vincent, you and I both, and I wouldn't take from him his innovative skills in those days when I first came to Dublin. And one of the things that I found interesting about him was the fact that many of the things which were innovative in terms of legislation had his stamp on them somewhere, and that was intriguing and interesting and I wouldn't take that from him. But we all know now what the story was, a story that I certainly didn't know anything about until the McCracken tribunal, any more than you or anybody else. You didn't know in 1984 that his lifestyle was such as not to be conceivably affordable by the income he was getting as a public representative? Well, how would I have known that? How would I particularly have known that? Everyone in the country had known that. Did they? And what did you do about it as well? You were working in the field of journalism, like myself, at that time. You know, some of these things are tediously silly, really, Vincent. I mean, a lot of people asked questions at that time and, with the greatest respect to those people who now look back, I mean I would have to say to you about that time, there were a lot of contempt on his part for people like me, actually, and for other people who did have a faith in him and who did believe that when he talked about his vision for Ireland\n\no\n\nm\n\nJJ\n\n.A\n\n(f)\n\nm\n\n'0\n\n(f)\n\nm 55\n\nquestions around at that time, and my view as a lawyer would be very, very simple. If people have allegations to make, let them make the allegations and let them stand\n\n\"Not one single person who was in a position to alter the course of history actually did it in relation to Charlie Haughey. It was only almost by happenstance that he managed to be found out before death got him.\"\n\nover them. There were hundreds of people at that time who made those allegations who never at the end of the day saw them through to the end of the line. And it seems to me extraordinary looking back on those days now, now that we know the story, the story's actually beyond credulity, it is so dreadful, and it shows, if you like, such a\n\nand that when he did defend the nation and when he was essentially one of Ireland's first citizens, and, when you think about, one should have and would be entitled to have both a respect and pride in one's politicians-and that when I look back on that and see how people like me were essentially duped. Yes, one does feel very foolish, not surprised, not shocked, but one feels very, very foolish. But I'd have to say that it wasn't my function then as a very small underling in a party. I didn't know the man hardly at all, I'd barely met him, maybe I saw him once or twice, maybe, in my entire life. There were people who were around him who were very, very close to him, there were institutions of the state, there were tax collectors, tax inspectors, all sorts of people who would have a role to ask the very questions-I think you're, you know, you're posing now-and more importantly to take those tracks and to track right down to the very end, and they did not do that, and I think those questions still remain open. It just strikes me as extraordinary that we only now have this appalling insight into this man and to the, I suppose, to the strange nature of this man, this very twisted nature, and we only have that because of a private family dispute that went awry. Not one single organ of the state, not one single journalist, not one single politician, not one single person who was in a position to alter the course of history actually did it in relation to Charlie Haughey. It was only almost by, you know, by happenstance, by accident or coincidence, that he managed to be found out before eventually death got him. Mary McAleese, thank you.
