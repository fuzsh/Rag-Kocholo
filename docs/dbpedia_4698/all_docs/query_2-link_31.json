This transformation wasn't an overnight success but a testament to the power of perseverance, continuous learning, and strategic risk-taking. Background: For two years, Discounters.pk found itself plateaued at the 7-figure mark. Despite the initial success, progress stagnated. It was during this time that I realized the importance of embracing challenges, learning from setbacks, and utilizing every opportunity for improvement. Key Learnings: Risk Analysis Expertise: Understanding and mitigating risks became a cornerstone. My deep dive into risk analysis allowed me to make informed decisions, turning potential setbacks into opportunities. Team as Friends: A business is only as strong as its team. Fostering a culture where the team feels like a family was pivotal. Trust and camaraderie became the fuel for our collective success. Consistent Hard Work: There's no substitute for hard work. Consistency in our efforts, day in and day out was the driving force. This work ethic instilled resilience and determination within the team. Continuous Improvement: A commitment to constant improvement fueled innovation. We embraced change, welcomed feedback, and evolved our strategies and processes regularly. Turning Point: The breakthrough came when I decided to take calculated risks that I had been avoiding for the past two years. This shift in mindset was crucial. It wasn't about avoiding risks anymore; it was about managing them strategically to propel the business forward. The Mindset Shift: The mindset shift was the linchpin of our success. It involved embracing challenges as opportunities, viewing risks as stepping stones, and understanding that growth often lies just beyond the comfort zone. For Those Seeking Details: If you're eager to dive deeper into the specifics of this case study, I'd be more than happy to share the intricate details of the strategies implemented, the risks taken, and the mindset cultivated.

A year full of so many high hopes, crushing letdowns, incremental victories, and, most of all: Growth & Focus. I've delayed writing this because I really didn't think it would take this long. Sure, I knew I had my work cut out for me trying to return to the corporate world after being self-employed, but I was ready and hungry to grow in a way that I'd never been before. I began looking to return to B2B sales last Spring after tiring of Real Estate sales (mostly the rental side of things). When I got into this field, it was a side-hustle that I was excelling at, and then the pandemic hit and I went full blast with it. I landed a corporate landlord account and generated $600k ARR for them. For a few years, I grossed over $100k in commissions with no salary. But I started to feel...understimulated. Incredibly dissatisfied. I looked at my successes in Real Estate and said: \"Ok so...what now? What am I moving toward? What am I learning?\" I missed working with a team and being challenged. The best parts of my job as an agent were client relations anyway. I missed the feeling I had signing and managing client accounts when I was an Account Executive. I felt like I conquered what I came to conquer in real estate and I also felt like time was slipping away. It was time to leave it and get back to B2B sales. I've been successfully self-employed for 7 years because the honest truth is that I was suffering from chronic physical anxiety and panic attacks in my late 20s and I had no idea how to enter the office when I was struggling to keep it together every day. I was 27, and working at an early-stage SaaS startup in the prestigious Atlanta Tech Village incubator. Things were going great, until a week before my birthday when my heart wouldn't stop pounding out of my chest. On my birthday, the doctor diagnosed me with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and, sure, why not, let's throw in Depression. I returned to work feeling defeated. I stuck it out for a few more months but I decided I needed to leave Atlanta altogether and be with my family back in NJ. I spoke to my manager and he compassionately worked with me on my exit. I'll still never forget the grace with which he handled the situation and I'll always be grateful to him and the CEO for their kindness that day. I moved back to NJ, helped my friend scale a new restaurant he was running, and basically had to reset my career trajectory all over again...and reset myself in the process. Turns out my anxiety was a gut health issue, and by the grace of God and good habits, I'd completely overcome my body's daily desire to scream out in pulsating anxiety. For the last few years now, I've run *toward* challenges. I welcome them, learn from them, and allow myself to be sharpened by them. I've never been more ready or excited to take my sales skills and resilience and excel on a sales team. I wish it hadn't taken this long, but I wouldn't trade the journey for anything. #Opentowork\n\nNothing great ever came that easy. I think about this often as I'm currently spending 95% of my time building relationships & connections with my network on the hunt for amazing early-stage startups to partner with. Building out our CRM with CLEAN data & contact info takes time Doing research on potential clients takes time Crafting emails takes time Cold calling and emailing takes time Testing and learning takes time Thinking through a partnership strategy takes time Responding to salespeople looking for help takes time Consistently improving our messaging & offerings takes time But you know what? 2024 will be a grind (for sure) but I'm laying the ground work brick by brick to make my life easier in 2025 to build a repeatable business that provides for my family. Anything worth building takes time. Here's how I know what I'm doing is working: I'm on my 28th day as a bootstrapped founder and received 5 fairly positive responses to cold outreach in the last 24 hours. In this market?! That's a f*cking win!! For anyone who needs to hear it - keep going. Your next sale, job, or opportunity is right around the corner. You just need to find it and hold on tight üí™\n\nIn the past, I faced: 1. Some colleagues say kind things to me or in public but then speak negatively about me to others in private 2. Some team members speak negatively about their colleagues without having a direct conversation with them first 3. Job candidates badmouthing their ex-companies and bosses 4. Moments where I revealed too much or said things I regret But what I wanted to say is this. Marketing, SaaS, startups‚Ä¶ these are all small worlds. Nobody delivers great work every single time. It‚Äôs one thing to share constructive criticism or an opinion. But there‚Äôs a time, place, and a classy way for it. (the hard way) Another thing is to badmouth or critic someone without having the guts to say it to their face first. (the easy way) That's not you being transparent, that's you being... oh wait, they told me not to curse here. That's you being small-minded and classless. Easy way is always more popular, but what goes around comes around. I‚Äôd love it if we all learned to walk the hard way. Let‚Äôs call this way ‚ÄúStairways to Heaven‚Äù. ü§ò\n\nNot the news I wanted to share but here it is.... Last Thursday, VIIZR announced that we were ceasing operations effective November 1. Well, it's November 1 and I woke up with a wave of mixed emotions. VIIZR gave me the opportunity to work with some of the most talented and brilliant people I have ever met. What I learned from the 6 months I was there, couldn't be replicated in any other environment, and I am convinced of that. I learned what it was like to work for a start up SaaS company...it's the Wild Wild West ya'll...and I loved it! It took some reflection to realize what I loved about that, and it's risk, growth, collaboration, and literally a TEAM \"sport\". It's not for the faint of heart but the reward payout, in self-GROWTH is not quantifiable. I was mentored by some of the best people, whom I highly respect and admire. I was able to have long conversations with the CEO, COO and CFO...which in most corporate structures, would not have happened and certainly ideas wouldn't be bounced off you. Ego isn't a thing in a startup, you can't have one and if you do, you'll be shot right back down to Earth. I learned how to ask for help more than I ever have and was met with grace every time. I have so many things to say about VIIZR and none of it is about the product (which was good too). All of it is about the experience and the gratitude I have for each and every person I met and now call friends, mentors, career partners. With that said, I am looking for my next growth opportunity in Sales. I love the SaaS world and would love to stay in it, but am open to all opportunities. I know VIIZR was a bridge for me to walk over to get to my most fulfilling role and will miss all the crazy aspects of it. If you or someone you know is in the process of hiring for sales positions, I would be truly honored if you would keep me in mind. Likewise, if you're aware of anyone seeking to hire in the tech industry (across various domains like design, engineering, and more), I'd be thrilled to recommend a number of individuals that I can vouch for without hesitation. I appreciate your referrals in advance ‚Äì they mean the world to me and my little family. Keep in touch VIIZRoos, I sure will miss you! Let me know if you ever need a thing! #SaaS #SalesManager #Growth #Opentonewops #StartUpTech"
