THE CHRONICLE ish, expenditures of the most reckless and inexcusable kind were incurred, salary lists extended and increased, salaries themselves raised to prodigal extremes and no attempt made anywhere to retrench and economize. If proof were needed of the fact it would be sufficient to point out, as we did in our articles a year ago, that whereas the City budget,in 1916 was only $212,956,155 and in 1917 no more than $211,114,136, and even in 1918, when Mayor Hylan entered office for the first time, was only $238,123,759 (this latter budget having been the last adopted by the Mitchel Administration); on the other hand the budget for the current year of 1926, and the last adopted by the Hylan Administration was no less than $437,000,000. In other words, in the eight years of the Hylan Administration the City budget -,—the amount of the yearly expenditures—was added alto in the huge sum of, roughly, $200,000,000, or entirely is ed, remember most doubled. This, be it in independent of the increase in the same interval net. the City's permanent indebtedness, gross and office, On Jan. 1 1918, when Mayor Hylan entered was debt t permanen the gross funded and other two his of $1,219,548,477; on Jan. 1 1926, at the end terms of office, the gross debt had run up to $1,566,013,785.

The announcement is not merely startling; it is posithe tertively alarming. It was supposed that with mination of the Hylan regime the end of the period had also been of constantly swelling budgets enough to sanguine reached. Some of us were even total of the hope that substantial reductions in the and is so was it since budgets would- be effected, and exus superfluo plainly apparent that many off traneous items of expenditure can be lopped impairing without detriment to anyone and without City is the that functions in the least the many the record is again to be broken, and the budget swollen to even more appalling proportions than before. The Comptroller's figures foreshadow another addition of nearly $40,000,000, which would bring the 1927 budget up to $476,000,000. This is larger than the expenditures of the entire Federal Government in the years immediately preceding the war, including the Army, the Navy, the pensions, and everything else. In order that the reader may have the figures before him in graphic form and in statistical shape, we introduce here the following, showing the budget in each of the eleven years from 1916 to 1926, inclusive, and indicating also how much of the budget in each year has consisted of the City payroll, for this last constitutes the most important item in the story: YEARLY EXPENDITURES OF NEW YORK CITY.

Before proceeding further with our discussion, it seems desirable to impress the reader with the magnitude of such a budget as $476,000,000 for the conduct of our civic Government, since in this age of rapid expansion where projects and undertakings involving billions upon billions of dollars are of common occurrence, the general public is likely to lose its sense of proportion and fail to recognize what is involved in City expenditures of such truly vast proportions. A very apt way of bringing the ordinary person to a realization of the size of such expenditures, when applied even to a City with such a large population as New York City, is that which was employed by us in our second article on the subject of the City's Plight, published in the \"Chronicle\" for Oct. 24 last, namely to consider the expenditure in relation to population in order to arrive at the per capita expenditure. The population of 2 the Greater New York may be roughly taken as 61/ in000 millions. Accordingly, a budget of $476,000, volves a per capita tax for the support of the City Government of roughly $73. It follows as a consequence that for a family of five persons the cost of running the City Government is $365 per year. This in turn means that an average family of five persons is called upon to bear a tax,in one form or another, in higher rents and higher living costs of $7 per week in order to maintain the City Government in its different functions. We may therefore repeat the query we put in our article of last October and ask, Is not a tax of $7 per week for this puipose an inordinate and exorbitant burden, and are we not wholly called upon to perform. it evidences a record Instead, the Comptroller confronts us with the within bounds when we say that of inefficiency, of profligacy and wanton waste possibility, nay the almost absolute certainty, that JULY 24 1926.] THE CHRONICLE which must be brought to a quick close else disaster will result. In 1917, the last year of the Mitchel Administration, the population was about 51/ 4 millions and the budget $211,114,136; the per capita expense was therefore only $40, and the average charge for a family of five persons no more than $200 instead of the. present $365 per year, making the burden per week $4 in contrast with the cost now of $7 per week. Comptroller Berry in his letter lays especial stress on the additional burden which the projected outlays will involve in additions to debt and rapidly augmenting interest charges and in meeting the yearly deficit from the operation of the new subways on the basis of a continuance of the 5-cent fare, when, according to carefully prepared computations of the Board of Transportation, as submitted to the Board of Estimate and Apportionment under date of May 26 1925, the new subways cannot be made to pay their way at less than an 8-cent fare. That certainly constitutes a formidable element in the problem, but the fundamental cause of the trouble lies much deeper. It is found in the reckless way in which expenditures have been enlarged, year by year, all the way from $5,000,000 a year to over $70,000,000 a year, as is indicated by the tabular statement which we have presented above. Except for this the additional burdens imposed by new subway construction, heavy though they be, would not be so difficult to bear, but coming on top of ordinary budget outlays already exceeding the bounds of prudence, the burden threatens to become positively crushing. How relief is to be provided, however, from the new burdens will tax the ingenuity of the wisest men, since the 5-cent fare has been firmly imbedded in the law and there appears to be no getting away from it. Besides, during the Mayoralty campaign of last autumn Mr. Walker also definitely committed himself in favor of a continuance of the 5-cent fare. There seems, therefore, no alternative, by which even partial relief from the new burdens can be obtained, except possibly by assessing a portion of the cost of the new subways upon abutting property owners and the feasibility of such a step may well be questioned. If the attempt were made we are sure it would quickly appear that the harm and damage inflicted in a great variety of ways would completely outweigh any possible good to be derived by the City at large. All this makes it all the more important that the problem should be attacked at its root and some means be devised for not only checking the constant growth of expenses, averaging in all recent years some $40,000,000 per annum, but for reducing very substantially the yearly total of the expenditures with a view of bringing them back to proper, reasonable limits. The Comptroller cites the increase in interest and sinking fund charges as one of the factors contributing to the steady rise in expenditures, but that that is only one of the elements in the problem is made apparent by the table which we 367 have given above and which shows that in the ten years from 1916 to 1926 the City payroll has been increased from $97,072,519 to $213,534,186. This great expansion in the payroll is the twofold result of an increase in the number of the City employees and an increase in their wages, or compensation, which increases have been made in most prodigal fashion, as we showed in our article of a year ago. Yet at this very moment the school teachers are clamoring for a further increase in their pay which with extra pensions would involve new outlays per year estimated to run between $15,000,000 and $30,000,000, depending upon the extent to which the demands for the pay increases were complied with. In forecasting for 1927 a budget aggregating $476,000,000, Comptroller Berry does not appear to have taken these demands of the school teachers into abcount, and if they were granted to the full extent the budget would be brought very close to the half-billion-dollar mark. Whether included or not, the Board of Estimate and Apportionment should resolutely set its face against further pay increases of any kind. That has not been the policy of the new Board thus far. Only recently they voted pay increases in the case of a considerable number of City employees out of money expressly provided for the purpose and included as a special item in the budget of 1926. They might well have refrained from such a course and left the money appropriated for the purpose unused in the City Treasury, seeing the acute stage of the City's financial affairs. Now that the Comptroller has brought so forcibly to the attention of every member of the Board the grave financial problem that confronts the City there will be no excuse for further pay increases of any kind hereafter. And the City should be frank and straightforward in rejecting such demands. The refusal should be put upon the indisputable ground that the City hasn't the money for the purpose. This, too, should be the answer to the school teachers' demands. They should be told merely that the City has no money to comply with any such demands, no matter from what source the demands may emanate. In the light of such circumstances it would be a waste Of time to give consideration to the merits of their case. That is entirely beside the mark. The situation in that respect is no different from that of the ordinary private individual who finds himself finan, ciallY embarrassed. If he hasn't the money, he simply can't pay any increases, however much he would like to do so. Then drastic steps should be taken to get rid of unnecessary employees and to eliminate superfluous and to reduce extravagant items of expenditures. The room for economy here is almost boundless. The Comptroller touches quite lightly on this phase of the matter, but he does mention just a single item which speaks volumes as to the conditions which exist in that particular. He makes bold to say that real economy can be effected in the matter of de- 368 THE CHRONICLE partmental maintenance and then mentions as an illustration of the kind that \"the City's bill for automobile service, leaving out the Police, Fire and Street Cleaning Departments, has increased from $500,000 in 1917 to nearly $4,000,000 in 1926. Taxi service costs 50 cents per mile to maintain.\" To which he adds the further statement that \"this is only one of the many items known to experienced budget makers where it is possible to effect savings.\" The Comptroller expresses the opinion that \"salaries and wages paid by the City do not give much room for economy because in many instances City employees are underpaid\"; but in this, few competent observers will agree with him. He tells us, however, that \"economies might be effected by reducing the number of departments, thus following the example set by the State.\" There are a number of places, he goes on to say,\"where the overlapping of departmental functions is obvious; there also are a number of positions which could be abolished without detriment to the City service.\" All this is significant and should be heeded and enforced. But the inquiry should by no means end there. The matter of the City's solvency is at stake. Even a very superficial observer could indicate numerous other ways for cutting down expenditures. As one instance, the radio broadcasting station in the Municipal Building should be turned over to private agencies and made the source of revenue instead of a constant source of outgo. In a court proceeding last summer one of the affidavits averred that the City records show that in addition to the original cost of $55,800 for the station, its maintenance and personal service payroll had grown until in the 1925 budget these called for $44,088. The station is not now being abused in the way it was during the nylon Administration, but broadcasting is not one of the legitimate functions of a municipal Government. Then, steps should be taken to prevent for the future at least, such attempts as those by which the nylon Administration sought to increase the pension allowance of a large number of City employees, including Mayor nylon himself. These all resigned a little before the close of the nylon Administration, but while it was still in full control of the City Government, so that they might be legally entitled to, and be given these special favors. Mayor nylon himself resigned the day before the cl me of his term, in order that he might come within the provisions of the law and the City ordinances. He voted himself a pension of $4,215 a year. In April last the Supreme Court handed down an opinion, from which an appeal has been taken, holding that all these acts were invalid. About $500,000 altogether seems to have been involved in this test case. But whether the acts are finally found to be valid or invalid, active steps should be taken to prevent similar occurrences in the future on the part of anyone. Granting pensions to elective office-holders is an anomaly anyway in municipal affairs, and should [VoL. 123. be made completely impossible for the future—certainly in the case of a municipal officer like Mayor nylon, who was getting a salary of $25,000 a year. The mere fact that an office-holder has to resign before the end of his term to get the benefit of the pension, shows that the pension was never intended to apply to such persons. The whole matter of the City finances and the City expenditures has now reached a pass where, for the continued solvency and financial integrity of the City and the maintenance unimpaired of its credit and financial standing, it must be dealt with in a broad and comprehensive manner. Complete confidence in the ability of the City to shoulder the growing volume of obligations and burdens being imposed upon it can be restored in no other way. Mayor Walker has recently appointed a Committee on City Planning composed of some of the most eminent men in the city. Everyone has the utmost confidence in the new Mayor's good intentions and in his sincere desire to bring about efficiency and economy in the conduct of the City Government. Of all the aspects and details of City Planning, what is more important than a wise planning for the administration of City finances. Indeed, in view of -the disclosures in Comptroller Berry's letter, that matter completely overshadows in importance and extreme urgency planning of every other kind. The personnel of the sub-committees of this Committee on City Planning and Survey has not yet been decided upon, but the subject expressly assigned to one of the sub-committees is that of New Sources of City Revenue. We would suggest, therefore, that the Mayor request this committee, when appointed, to make a thoroughgoing investigation into the subject of the City finances and report at an early day. In selecting the members of this committee the Mayor should also bear in mind their fitness for the task thus to be imposed upon them. We notice among the names on the full committee of 475 Otto H. Kahn and Mortimer L. Schiff, and these eminent financiers might well be chosen to head the subcommittee, in view of the fact that the investigation will involve such intricate and complicated financial questions that only experts in such matters can be deemed qualified for the work. At the time of the appointment of the committee it was stated that every one of the members had agreed to serve and Mayor Walker in his remarks on June 21 before the full committee expressed his gratitude and appreciation at the fact that they had all come \"freely offering your services in an endeavor to help the officials of this City to work out some scientific method for its improvement and its government.\" In these circumstances neither Mest.rs. Schiff and Kahn, nor the others designated to serve with them, could well refuse to accept the commission given them. These men, too, would be rendering an inestimable service in thus acting. We are persuaded that they would go into every detail of the City's finances and its expenditures and reve- JULY 24 1926.] THE CHRONICLE nues, and uncover every defect and every weak spot. Moreover, by reason of their force and character their recommendations would find universal acceptance. In this way only can the problem be solved once and for all, and the path for the future be so clearly charted that no doubt will ever again arise as to the ability of the City to preserve its credit and its integrity for all the long years to come. The Financial Situation. While the stock market has been the subject of wide fluctuations—early strength with rising prices being followed by sharp downward reactions as the result of the financial debacle in France—domestic corporation bonds the past week have ruled at about the same prices as in the previous week or . declined fractionally. With the approach of the autumn crop moving season it is customary to expect some seasonal weakening of prices and it may be that several other influences are operating. There is a possibility that the rate of turnover and the margin of profit in some industries have diminished, requiring a larger amount of working capital to carry a given amount of business. The requirements of industry often result in the withdrawal of funds from bond investments. And it is not unlikely that several industries producing semi-luxuries have been pushing sales aggressively by the extension of longer credits. The moderate recession in the quotations for United States Government bonds has been attributed to the same influences as those operating in the case of corporation bonds. The Liberty Loan issues and Treasury securities are undoubtedly very sensitive to money conditions. In addition, the Liberty Loans have recently lost much of their attractiveness to investors seeking tax exemption. Up to July 2 of this year one might hold $50,000 in principal amount of the various 4% and 41/ 4% Liberty Loans free of Federal income taxes and surtaxes. After that date the exemption was reduced to $5,000 principal amount, although the First 3/ 1 2s continue to be exempt from income taxes and surtaxes. They therefore show a somewhat lower yield than the others and the distinction would probably be more marked were it not for the fact that surtaxes vary with individual incomes and cannot well be expressed in general market quotations. The spectacular further decline in the French franc, aggravated by lack of confidence in the shortlived Herriot Ministry, had a curious effect on the French dollar bonds. Last Saturday the external 8% bonds issued in 1920 were selling at 102%, the 71/ 2% bonds issued in 1921 at 95% and the 7% bonds issued in 1924 at 91. On Monday and Tuesday they all declined fractionally and by Wednesday quotations had receded to as low as 100, 92% and 867 / 8, respectively. The low prices occurred on limited transactions, most of the bonds sold during the day moving at higher prices. The announcement that would undertake to form a Cabinet on Poincare • Thursday resulted in an irregular recovery, the 71/2s at one time selling at 94% and the 7s at 89%. The recovery in the 8s, which were characterized by the greatest activity in the group, carried them to 101. Friday's advices that Poincare had succeeded in 369 forming his Cabinet resulted in little further advance, although the 8s sold at 100% at the close. The total outstanding amount of the French Government dollar bonds publicly held is considered to be in the neighborhood of $250,000,000, which should not prove a great burden in terms of French finance. The French dollar bonds have often been characterized by market instability. The 8s were offered in September 1920 by J. P. Morgan & Co. and a syndicate at par. In 1921 they sold down to 96 and up 4 in 1922,90in 1923, to 1013 / 4;they were-aslow as 931/ and as high as 109 in 1924. They fluctuated between 106 and 983 / 4 in 1925. The 7y2s were brought out at 95 in May 1921 and sold as low as 84 in 1923. The 7s, priced at 94 in December 1924, registered a low of 86 in 1925. It is thus evident that the declines in the French bonds during the week did not reach unusual proportions. In fact, it is conceivable that the recent crisis in Paris may eventually prove beneficial to the French dollar bonds. The maintenance of this debt service is of fundamental importance to French national credit and the proportion of the total amount to the total French national debt is very small. The recognition of the currency crisis and its eventual solution might well provide a more cheerful background for the dollar issues. Before the stock market became reactionary, the Anaconda Copper 7s. due 1938. established a new / 4 in response to the strength in the comhigh at 1073 mon stock, into which they are convertible at 53. On several occasions this conversion feature has been on the verge of becoming attractive. The Brooklyn Union Gas convertible 51/0 of 1936 were active, ad/ 4, comparing with a high for this vancing to 1513 year of 152. There was considerable activity in the Bethlehem Steel consolidated mortgage bonds, the Dodge Bros., Inc., 6s of 1940, the Seaboard Air Line consolidated 6s of 1945 and the Pan American Petroleum & Transport convertible 6s of 1934. New financing for the week has been extensive. On Tuesday a syndicate headed by Dillon, Read & Co. offered $8,000,000 Seaboard Air Line Ry. consolidated mortgage 6s, due 1945, at 95%. The previous day, Kuhn, Loeb & Co. brought out $4,600,000 New Orleans Texas & Mexico Ry. first 5s, due 1956, at par. Both these issues represented additional amounts under existing mortgages and in each instance the company has been making extensive improvements and additions in growing territory. A somewhat similar motive characterized the offering of $15,500,000 Wabash Ry. refunding and general 5s, due 1976, at 95%, by Kuhn, Loeb & Co., on Tuesday. A significant issue for a traction company was that of $5,000,000 first 6s, due 1951, of the Dallas Railway & Terminal Co. by Tucker, Anthony & Co. and associates. Public utility offerings were an outstanding feature of the latter half of the week. On Wednesday a syndicate headed by W. C. Langley & Co. offered $18,500,000 West Penn Power Co. first 5s, due 1956, at 100%. This important subsidiary of the American Water Works & Electric Cq., Inc., has been growing rapidly in its highly developed industrial territory. In this case also, the issue was another series of an old mortgage. The tendency to create an open financing medium has been more pronounced in recent years, avoiding the restrictions placed upon a property which may result in the inability of 370 THE CHRONICLE the company to finance its requirements.

The Government cotton crop report as of July 16, issued yesterday by the United States Department of Agriculture forecasts a yield for the present season of 15,368,000 bales of 500.pounds gross weight, exclusive of linters. This is a drop of 267,000 bales from the Department's June 25 estimate, and compares with a harvest of 16,103,679 bales in 1925, 13,627,936 bales in 1924, 10,139,671 bales in 1923, 9,762,069 bales in 1922 and only 7,953,641 bales in 1921. The present estimate of 15,368,000 bales is based on a condition of 70.7% of normal upon the 48,898,000 acres in cultivation on June 25 last and a ten-year average for abandonment of acreage. The condition of 70.7% of normal compares with a condition of 70.4% at the same time a year ago, and with 75.4% on June 25 last. A drop in condition at this time is a thing that is usual, the condition a year ago having declined in this period 5.5%. In 1925 at this time the Department estimated that the crop would be about 13,588,000 bales, with a condition of 70.4%, and an estimated acreage of 46,448,000 acres, with a yield per acre of 140 pounds, while the actual production turned out to be 16,103,679 bales. What the final outcome will be remains to be seen, but there are possibilities of getting the largest crop of cotton ever produced in this country. Of course, this depends entirely upon the part played by the various influences that will affect the crop during the remainder of the season. One of the main things to be taken into consideration is the damage and destruction that may be brought about by insects, such as weevil, fleas and grasshoppers. According to the Department's computations, if the developments during the remainder of the season are as unfavorable to the crop as during 1921, 1922 and 1923, a total production of only 13,476,000 bales may be expected. On the other hand, if later developments are as favorable to the crop as during 1924 and 1925 a total production of 16,628,000 bales may be expected. The yield per acre for this year's crop is now placed at 155.8 pounds, which compares with 158.5 pounds on June 25 this year, and with 167.2 pounds in 1925, 157.6 pounds in 1924, with a fiveyear average of 144.2 pounds and a ten-year average of 153.7 pounds. Virginia, North Carolina, Florida and New Mexico are the only States showing an increase in condition between June 25 and July 16; the increase ranges from 2% to 9%. All of these States, however, with the exception of North Carolina, raise only a small part of the crop. In North Carolina the increase in condition was 5%. The condition for South Carolina, Oklahoma and California remains the same, while all of the other States show a decline in condition ranging from 1% to 9%. Texas, the largest cotton producing State, shows a decline of 7%;Georgia,9%;Arkansas and Alabama, [voL. 123. 7%, and Mississippi, 8%. The condition in Louisiana and Arizona declined 2%. In all of the other States not mentioned the condition has dropped 1%. At last France has decided to try a Coalition Cabinet in a seemingly desperate effort to save the country from the serious financial situation into which the prolonged quarreling of its political leaders had brought it. The task of forming such a Cabinet was allotted to Raymond Poincare, \"three times a Premier, and President of the Republic during the World War.\" President Doumergue selected him after having received a request to do so signed by 250 members of the Chamber of Deputies. It took M. Poincare 36 hours to form the new Cabinet, his fourth. The Paris representative of the Associated Press cabled last evening that \"the Cabinet is composed exclusively of political veterans, including, with M. Poincare, no fewer than six former Premiers. All the others have been Cabinet members before, with the exception of the Labor Minister, and he is a son of the late President Fallieres.\" Continuing, the correspondent said: \"After visiting the Elysee Palace to inform President Doumergue of his success, M.Poincare said to the newspaper men: 'We wanted to form a Cabinet of the largest national union in which all parties would be represented, without taking account too closely of the representation of groups. We have tried to fulfil our task in the most high-minded spirit possible.' M. Poincare added he had found no difficulties in his path, because he insisted upon forming the Cabinet without regard to personal preferences. He is holding an informal Cabinet meeting at his home this afternoon and expects to present the new Ministers to the President this evening. The Premier announced that, at the same time the new Cabinet faced the Chamber of Deputies, next Tuesday, he would introduce his financial bill. M.Poincare was loudly cheered by a crowd outside the Elysee Palace as he left, after seeing the President.\" Besides M. Poincare, the other former Premiers are Aristide Briand, Minister of Foreign Affairs; Louis Barthou, Minister of Justice; Albert Sarraut, Minister of Interior; Edouard Herriot, Minister of Education, and Georges Leygues, Minister of Marine. The eleventh Cabinet of Aristide Briand, Premier of France, went down over the week-end. It happened Saturday night, July 17, and was the result of the demand of Joseph Caillaux, Finance Minister, that the Chamber \"give the Cabinet dictatorial fiscal powers as the basis of his plan to save the franc.\" The vote was 288 to 243. The situation just before the demand was made was outlined in part as follows in a special Paris cablegram to the New York \"Times\" on July 16: \"Having been told by the American Government that there is no chance of obtaining at present a modification of the Mellon-Berenger treaty, the French Government late to-day decided to stake its financial program and its existence in a strenuous effort to force through Parliament the American debt settlement as it stands. The Finance Minister, Joseph Caillaux, presented his bill for the delegation to the Government of decree power in the work of financial reform and announced definitely that JULY 24 1926.] THE CHRONICLE he would ask ratification of the Washington and London debt accords before the Chamber adjourned, as their ratification is essential to the whole scheme of financial reform.\" The New York \"Herald Tribune\" representative added: \"The Chamber begins to-morrow one of the most critical debates, perhaps, in the history of the Third Republic upon the Briand-Caillaux Government's finance reform bill and at the moment the franc is weakening under conditions which might be described as verging on a panic and the public is rushing to demand repayment of maturing Treasury and national defense bonds. Joseph Caillaux, Finance Minister, appearing before the Chamber's Finance Commission late to-day after the franc had fallen unprecedentedly to 42.49 to the dollar and 206.40 to the pound, told the Commission that the Government measure, including the right to decree fiscal reforms in the next four months, and all depending on the ratification of both the American and British debt agreements must be passed by the Chamber before the Bourse re-opens next Monday morning. 'Otherwise,' said the Finance Minister, not take any further responsibility.'\" Discussing the question of responsibility for the overthrow of the Cabinet, the Paris representative of the New York \"Times\" said in a cable message late Saturday night that \"the honor or dishonor of the day goes to Edouard Herriot, President of the Chamber and leader of the Left, who quit the Presidential chair to lead the fight against the Government and to defend the sanctity of Parliamentary institutions. There is without doubt a connection between M. Herriot's solicitude for the rights of Parliamentary government and his hope that to-morrow President Doumergue will once again send for him to form a Government.\" He further stated that \"when Premier Briand went to the Elysee soon after 8 o'clock to hand the Government's resignation to President Doumergue, he advised the President of the Republic to make haste in forming a new Government, saying he thought it essential that this be done by Monday morning. As the resigned Cabinet came down the steps of the Presidential Palace, M. Briand had a tired and worn look. 'Now,' he am a free man and I am going fishing tosaid, morrow.' M. Caillaux, on the contrary, was jaunty and full of pep. He seemed not to be grieving over his defeat and rather had the air of a man who felt he had made others afraid of him. He appeared to have quite a lot of steam left, and circumstances recall the saying that the French politician is dead only when the undertaker gets him. M. Doumergue followed the Premier's advice and at 9 o'clock sent for President de Selves of the Senate and President Herriot of the Chamber for the customary consultation.\" Apparently M. Herriot's political opponents were on hand, even that evening, as he went to the Elysee Palace in reply to a summons from President Doumergue. The \"Times\" correspondent said: \"When M. Herriot arrived at the Elysee Palace tonight to confer with President Doumergue on the Cabinet crisis a crowd quickly surrounded his automobile and greeted him with boos and catcalls. It was impossible for the car to get to the gate of the Elysee. Police reserves were hurriedly called and made a lane to the courtyard door through which the 371 President of the Chamber was able to pass. At midnight M. Herriot said he had discussed the political situation at length with the President of the Republic, but that he had not been asked to-night to form a Cabinet. When the question was put whether he expected to be asked, M. Herriot replied in the affirmative and said he would accept. He refused to indicate what sort of combination he contemplated.\" Commenting the next day upon the difficulties encountered by M. Herriot at the outset, the \"Times\" representative said: \"But now, twelve hours later, the unhappy Cartel chief finds that the bed he made for himself when he engineered the defeat of the Briand-Caillaux Government last night is full of thorns instead of the petals his roseate imagination foresaw. The new Herriot Cabinet consists so far of M. Herriot. None of the other leaders of the Chamber or Senate show any enthusiasm about linking their political fortunes with him. When M. Herriot awoke this morning a note was handed to him from M. Briand saying that the ousted Premier had gone fishing down in Normandy and requested particularly not to be disturbed. Of course M. Briand knew the note was well directed because he had 'advised' President Doumergue last night to let M. Herriot see what he could do with his victory. At the Elysee M. Herriot explained to President Doumergue that he hoped to form a Cabinet of the large coalition, incliiding if possible Socialists on the Left and Poincarists headed by M. Mann on the Right. President Doumergue replied that he thought such a Cabinet would obtain a large vote in the Chamber. Full of hope, M. Herriot set about his task. He wrote a letter to Leon Blum, head of the Socialists, inviting his party to join the new Government, and a letter to M. Mann asking him to come and see him to discuss the formation of the new Government. The result of his efforts to-night is that the Socialists in a meeting marked by an excellent pugilistic contest replied to M. Herriot that they would take part in any Cabinet which pledged itself to a capital levy. M. Mann has informed M. Herriot that although his group found him very convenient in getting M. Caillaux's scalp yesterday he did not wish to join a Herriot Government. Of course, M. Herriot cannot get a capital levy either through the Chamber or Senate, and therefore the Socialists' letter was a refusal. Questioned to-night, M. Mann said, with respect to a Herriot Government, that he preferred to remain in opposition. 'It is plain enough that a Coalition Cabinet is not possible under M. Herriot,' he said.\" The New York \"Herald Tribune\" correspondent added in a cablegram to his newspaper the same eveDing that \"the impression is that he will fail and that the task will pass into other hands. His efforts this afternoon to reconstruct the old cartel of the Left failed when the Socialists decided not to participate in any Ministry not their own, and not to support any Government not advocating the capital levy as the main plank in its program for the nation's financial recovery. On leaving the Elysee Palace to-night, Herriot made it plain, however, that if he is successful in assembling a new Government to-morrow, the keystone of his policy would be to 'bring about the solution of France's problems by France's own means.' This can only be interpreted 372 THE CHRONICLE as hostility to the ratification of the debt pacts and to foreign credits, which the non-partisan committee of experts already has told the country were its only hope of avoiding national bankruptcy.\" In a special London cable dispatch to the New York \"Herald Tribune,\" also on Sunday evening, it was asserted that \"dismay reigns in financial circles here over the overthrow of Joseph Caillaux. Although the financial district frankly was doubtful whether M. Caillaux would last as Finance Minister, the critical moment in the Chamber of Deputies was not expected to develop before Tuesday at the earliest, and the news of Caillaux's downfall, which arrived late last night, filled banking men with the deepest misgivings as to the future of France. So important was the event deemed that, late as the hour was, the Resident Secretaries in Downing Street at once sent the news to Prime Minister Baldwin and Chancellor of the llxchequer Churchill who were passing the week-end in the country.\" It was added that \"the political consequences of the downfall of the tenth Briand Cabinet are being watched here with as much anxiety as the financial results. The fear is openly expressed that France has taken another step on the road to a dictatorship, and Edouard Herriot has come in for a great deal of criticism, especially in Liberal quarters, for the part he played in upsetting Caillaux. In refusing to give the Finance Minister dictatorial powers the English Liberals assert that he has inadvertently administered a severe blow to Parliamentary institutions in France and helped win converts in his country to Mussolini's viewpoint that a liberal democratic regime is powerless to save a nation in a crisis.\" Continuing, the correspondent said: \"Herriot, however, is not the only scapegoat being held up in rebuke in England. The others are Caillaux himself—and the United States. America is taken to account by 'The Daily Mail,' which editorially blames the debt funding policy of the United States from the time of the armistice as the cause for all the troubles which are afflicting France today. 'The Daily Mail,' which has by far the largest circulation of any newspaper in Britain, evidently thinks that the indirect attacks on the debt policy of the American Government by Winston Churchill, the direct attacks by the anti-Administration newspapers in the United States, the Peabody letter and the parade of the war cripples in Paris have made the time opportune for an assault on the Mellon line.\" Edouard Herriot eventually succeeded in forming a Cabinet. Late Monday night, July 19, the Paris representative of the New York \"Times\" cabled that at 11 o'clock to-night the Elysee announced the formation of a new Government headed by Edouard Herriot.\" He claimed that \"the Cabinet is mediocre in composition, and, far from being the coalition Cabinet the country desires, is almost exclusively of the Radical Left. Outside MM. Herriot, Painleve and LoucheuA,the Government contains none of the country's big leaders. The important post of Minister of Finance goes to Senator Anatole de Monzie.\" Continuing to outline the difficulties with which the new Premier was confronted and to comment on the personnel of the new Ministry, the \"Times\" correspondent said in part: \"The new Cabinet is not what the country needs and it is difficult to see how [VoL. 123. it can achieve anything. It is overwhelmingly opposed to ratification of the Berenger treaty and one of its planks will be that France does not need foreign credits, but under the banner of true republican leadership can save its own finances in the same spirit as it won the Battle of the Marne. But M. Herriot did not command at the Battle of the Marne. No one denies that M. Herriot is persistent, and in financial matters it will probably be revealed that he is consistent. He is noted as a man who resorted to concealed inflation and if he remains in office this time long enough to get hold of the helm there is every prospect that the first accomplishment of his Government will be further inflation. There is no chance whatever of the new Government inspiring that confidence which will obtain the return to France of the capital which has fled. The heavy fall of the franc on the Paris Bourse to-day was caused by further flights of French capital and the procedure will certainly continue to-morrow. The path of the new Herriot Government was paved with good intentions. M. Herriot tried his best to get MM. Poincare, Briand, Tardieu and Mann into his Cabinet to give it better tone. They declined the honor. To-day he offered the post of Finance Minister to Louis Barthou, President of the Reparations Commission, who declined without thanks. Therefore M. Herriot has probably done the best he could with the material left. M. Herriot is in a difficult position, not having all his own party behind him. Saturday night, when he hooked his wagon to the Nationalist attack on M. Caillaux, 75 Radical Socialists voted for the Government, while only 48 voted for M. Herriot. At a meeting of the Radical Party to-day, M. Herriot's friends introduced a motion criticizing those who voted for M. Briand, This motion was defeated by a good majority, and thus M. Herriot's own party turned on him. The whole Right will fight the new Cabinet and the Communists will be against it. Its only hope lies in the Socialists, which means that its only hope lies in espousing the Socialist fiscal panacea.\" According to expectations at that time, the new Cabinet will go before Parliament on Thursday, and meanwhile will draft its financial program. It is impossible to say to-night what this program is since it does not yet exist.\" It was pointed out by the New York \"Times\" correspondent that \"the Government which M. Herriot has brought together is the fourteenth since M. Clemenceau ended his work on Jan. 17 1920, and the seventh since the general elections of the spring of 1924 unseated the Conservatives and brought in the present Premier for the first time with his Socialist-Radical Government, supported by the Socialists. His new Government, with the exception of himself and M. de Monzie, who has already served as Minister of Finance; M. Painleve, the Premier who succeeded M. Herriot on Oct. 29 1925, and M. Loucheur, said to be the richest man in France, who has already been Minister of Finance, is principally composed of men of local rather than of national reputations.\" The Paris representative of the New York \"Herald Tribune\" was still less hopeful of the success of the new Ministry. He cabled Monday evening \"that the Ministry will fall upon its first demand for a vote of confidence in the Chamber of Deputies on the policy of a disguised capital levy and other radical JULY 24 1926.] TH v. CHRONICLE measures as a financial panacea would not be surprising. With the franc falling to about two cents in value, extra policemen guarded the streets leading to the Bourse and the banks near the boulevards where the holders of internal bonds were clamoring to buy foreign currency. The Government has forbidden broadcasting companies to announce financial and commercial quotations, such being confine d to Government bulletins when necessary. This is construed as the first stage of a censorship, also suggested by announcement of the postal authori ties that telegrams will be subject to long delays for a few days 'on account of storms.'\" That at last the business situation in France was greatly upset by the continued severe declines in the franc was set forth in a long Paris dispatc h from the Paris representative of the Associated Press Tuesday afternoon, July 20. In part he said: \"Members of the Chamber of Deputies were more engrossed to-day in the fall of the franc than in Edouard Herriot's new Cabinet, completed yesterday. Several told of rising impatience among their constituents, especially the business people; who seem almost unanimous in calling for a committee of public safety, with full powers to save the currency. The economic pinch is now regarded as the most potent factor in the exchange situati on, because of its influence on the general confidence. The Paris Bourse of Commerce to-day took stringent measures to prevent speculation in sugar by deciding no deals will be approved at prices higher than last Friday's closing. This action somewh at calmed business circles, but the franc again weakened and went nearer the 2-cent mark, at 49.33 to the dollar. The silk manufacturers of Lyons, of which M. Herriot is Mayor, created a sensation by an outspoken address to the Presidents of the Chamber and Senate and the Chairmen of the Parliamentary Finance Committees. They declare their industr y is in an inextricable situation, as it is no longer possible to adapt their financial resources to their needs for foreign exchange to buy raw materials. They blame the frequent Ministerial changes and procrastination in settling the financial problem.\" He added that \"rumors that the new Government would resort to further inflation are denied officially. Finance Minister de Monzie is credited with a plan for forced conversion of the whole interior debt, including the national defense bonds, with a view to relieving the Treasury of this menace. Evidences of ill humor on the part of Parisians is now cropping out in different ways. While the growing impatience of the people is causing anxiety in official quarters, it is hailed by many followers of the situation as a welcom e development, since it is regarded as the thing best calculated to spur Parliament to effective action.\" With the franc continuing to slump day after day, \"the new Herriot Government decided to-n ight [Tuesday] to go before the Chamber for a showdo wn to-morrow afternoon at 5 o'clock instead of waiting until Thursday.\" The New York \"Times\" correspondent in the French capital cabled that evening that \"announcement of this set at rest reports that because of dissensions the new Cabinet had decided to resign at once. The differences which developed in the Cabinet meeting, which lasted from 3 o'clock this afternoon until 10 o'clock, were said to have li 373 arisen over Finance Minister de Monzie's request for full powers similar to those asked by M. Caillaux. Such a program was rejected by Premier Herriot, who based his successful fight against the Briand Cabinet on Saturday night on opposition to special powers for the Government. M. de Monzie issued a statement late to-night in the form of a blanket denial of the reliability of reports of any financial plans credited to him.\" Realizing the possibility if not probability of the new Herriot Ministry failing to obtain support from the Chamber of Deputies, steps were attempted in advance to still have a Government by giving the President virtually the powers of a dictator. In a special Paris dispatch to the New York \"Herald Tribune\" Tuesday evening, it was stated that \"Deputy Morinaud, of the Radical Left, a party a trifle to the right of M. Herriot's Radical-Socialists, announced that he had procured the signatures of 250 Deputies to a petition to be presented to President Doumergue in the event of the fall of the Herriot Cabinet, demanding that the President himself exercise his constitutional prerogative of forming a Ministry of national union regardless of politics, which would deal with the financial situation before disaster overtook the nation and function as did the non-partisan Cabinet headed by Georges Clemenceau at the darkest period of the war.\" It was made known also that \"another petition of the same character began to be circulated in M. Herriot's own section of the Chamber of Deputies to-day, Henry Franklin-Bouillon obtaining many signatures to this document. Thus it would appear that already a majority of the Chamber as well as of the Senate is against M. Herriot's cartel Government even before it appears in the Lower House. To-night's session of the Cabinet followed a three-hour meeting this afternoon, when it became known that M. Herriot and Anatole de Monzie, his Finance Minister, were in disagreement over the means of meeting the coming State obligations, mainly the rush of bondholders with demands for redemption. Two alternatives are open—inflation of the currency or a temporary cessation of the payment of these bonds. At the end of the meeting M. Herriot motored to the Elysee Palace to consult President Doumergue.\" The Herriot Cabinet made its declaration to the Chamber of Deputies at 5 o'clock Wednesday afternoon. The Paris representative of the Associated Press cabled that \"the newly formed Herriot Government, in its Ministerial declaration before the Chamber of Deputies to-day, set itself on record as opposed to inflation of French currency and in favor of payment of all debts.\" The program of The new Ministry was further outlined as follows: \"There will be no foreign loans, the Government asserts; the country must save itself. Foreign currency held abroad by Frenchmen must be returned to France, a special account for that purpose to be opened by the Bank of France. The strictest economy will be enforced, beginning with the State services. No reference is made in the declaration to a capital levy, but it mentions 'a special tax on assets not in the service of the public credit.' The declaration is very short and concludes with a demand for immediate approval or rejection of the program. It was received by the Chamber in ominous silence, _374 THE CHRONICLE rvoL. 123. broken only by handclapping from a few scattered $30,000,000 is still left of the $100,000,000 which was advanced to the Poincare Government in 1921 Socialists.\" to defend the franc.

Sarraut, but retain the Finance portfolio himself.\" Announcement was made the same evening tat \"Raoul Perk, former Finance Mininster, was elected to-day as President of the Chamber of Deputies, which post he held from 1920 to 1924. He succeeds Edouard Herriot, the Radical leader, who quit the Chamber Presidency to form the Ministry which fell yesterday.\" An official announcement in Paris yesterday showed that the forecast of the personnel of the new Cabinet was substantially correct. . A controversy has arisen between Winston Churchill, Chancellor of the British Exchequer, and members of the House of Commons, and the United States Treasury Department with respect to war debts. The former were quoted as taking the ground that our dovernment had displayed a distinctly commercial spirit with regard to this question. The London representative of the New York \"Herald Tribune\" cabled on July 19 that \"grave warning by Hilton Young that 'minority Americans who make commercialism their god are imperiling the future good relations between the United States and Great Britain'featured a debate on war debts in the House of Commons this evening.\" As to the identity of the speaker the correspondent said that \"Parliament was captured by the brilliant speech on the effect of the Baldwin debt settlement on Anglo-American relations by this back-bencher, who is one of his country's leading financial experts and only to-day was appointed by Premier Baldwin as a member of the British delegation to the League of Nations Assembly in September. Though quite recently converted to the Conservative Party from Liberalism, Mr. Young spoke with the air and authority of a Minister.\" The speaker was quoted as saying also that\"we have begun to pay our debt to America, but our Allies have not yet begun to pay us smaller amounts. What is amiss is this: We have regarded that matter as more than merely a commercial debt, but the United States has not. Either the United States entered the war because of common motives and ideals or as mere mercenaries. I believe that those in America who took the latter view comprise a small majority misrepresenting the true spirit of that great nation. But, while the British Minister cannot go cap in hand to America asking for the remission of the debt, America ought to remember that it is a matter of deep concern to Anglo-American relations in the future. There was a little rift in Anglo-American relations, due to this minority which makes commercialism a god. The tie of common memories of the war is a little loosened, and it may be necessary to look for another alliance.\" Philip Snowden, Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Labor Cabinet of Ramsay MacDonald, attacked Winston Churchill, complaining that \"the United States had made a much better bargain with Great Britain than Britain had with France or Italy.\" He charged also that \"he [Churchill] crumples up every time he comes into contact with a representative of a Continental debtor country.\" Continuing, Snowden said that \"in fifteen years the United States will 375 be taking from Europe, on account of war debts, £80,000,000 yearly. That means it will take a day's labor of 320,000,000 workers in Europe to pay this annual tribute to the United States. America in fifteen years' time ill be getting far more than Germany will be paying in reparations. This is a situation that cannot continue permanently. It is not to the interest of America that it should continue. There is certainly a change of opinion taking place in the United States regarding those debts.\" It was not at all surprising that the Treasury Department at Washington should have made prompt reply. According to a special Washington dispatch to the New York \"Times\" on the evening of July.20, \"a rejoinder was made by the Treasury to-day to the statement in the House of Commons yesterday by Winston Churchill, Chancellor of the Exchequer, in contradiction of Secretary Mellon's assertion that Great Britain borrowed a large portion of its debt from us for 'purely commercial as distinguished from war purposes.'\" It was explained that \"the Treasury's response took the form of a statement of the British account with the United States in connection with war loans. The essence of the figures was at variance with the British Chancellor's declaration that of $7,000,000,000 spent by Great Britain in the United States she had borrowed $4,000,000,000 and provided the other $3,000,000,000 from her own independent resources.\" The dispatch further stated that \"the data made public to-day by Under-Secretary Winston were designed to back up the declarations of Mr. Mellon in his letter to Frederick W.Peabody, which drew dissent from Mr. Churchill. Mr. Mellon is now at sea bound for Europe. The Treasury statement admits that the total reported British expenditures in the United States aggregated $7,219,408,669, but added that $1,853,612,246 of these were met by reimbursement from other Allies out of funds loaned to those Allies by the United States and that this was not provided for out of England's 'own independent resources.' This left about $5,366,000,000, of which $1,682,000,000 represented 'exchange and cotton purchases.' The greater part of the .latter expenditure is declared by the Treasury to have been 'for the maintenance of sterling exchange for purchases in America, but which enabled England to make purchases at an unprecedented exchange rate.'\" That level-headed Englishmen were coming to realize the mistake that had been made in attacking the war debt policy of the United States was indicated in a special London cable dispatch to \"The Sun\" Thursday evening. The author said that, \"with evidence rapidly accumulating that Americans at home as well as tourists abroad are resenting the efforts of Mr. Churchill and of Lord Rothermere in particular to give Americans at large a lesson in the meaning of war debts and to make them accept the idea that they are gouging the world, there is a demand in many quarters here to-day for the cessation of this unique educational campaign. There are members of the British Government who, while agreeing that Mr. Churchill has made out a good case, nevertheless question the wisdom of his eagerness at all times to tweak Uncle Sam's nose on this issue. Lord Rothermere's campaign is frankly described in important political and financial guar- 376 THE CHRONICLE ters as disastrous and calculated to introduce an element of bitterness into the debts question which may have the effect of impairing relations. Mr. Churchill is one of a group of British politicians who for a long time have been obsessed with the idea that some profitable clearing of the air might be done in respect of the debts question by giving the American public a close-up of the situation through British spectacles.\" It developed later the same day that so far as the Government was concerned the controversy had not come to an end. The New York \"Herald Tribune\" correspondent in London cabled that \"Great Britain recognizes the right of the United States to let off France, Italy and her other debtors on easier terms than Britain if she so desires, but Washington must not give as a reason for its discrimination the excuse that a large part of Britain's borrowings during the war were used for her own commercial purposes.\" He explained that \"this is the argument of a tart and lengthy communique issued by Winston Churchill to-night. In adding another chapter to his controversy with Secretary of the Treasury Mellon, the Chancellor of the Exchequer complains that the American Treasury's allegations that the money borrowed by Britain from the United States was not all used for purely war purposes is 'a misconception of the facts to which the necessary corrections' must be made.\" Marshal Pilsudski continues to experience not a little difficulty in the establishment of a real dictatorship in Poland, or even in the carrying out of any of his ideas with respect to a new Government. In a special wireless message from Warsaw to the New York \"Evening Post\" on July 17 it was claimed that \"Pilsudski's indirect dictatorship will be a limited .one, and he will not be in the same class as Premier Mussolini and General Primo de Rivera by the time the measure for constitutional changes gets through the Polish Diet.\" The correspondent added that \"constant hammering by the Left parties has prevented the complete overthrow of the Constitution, which last week seemed imminent. To-day a compromise has been drafted by the committee charged with preparing the constitutional reform measures. It has its first reading in the Diet. Sweeping Governmental powers, as provided for in the original bill, are included in the new measure, but a time limit is set for their existence. The Government will be permitted to issue dictatorial decrees affecting the organization of administrative offices, budget matters and finances generally only until October 1927. The new bill eliminates entirely any alterations in the Constitution or electoral law. Such changes have been bitterly opposed by the Diet, which, as a whole, regards the new bill as a victory for Parliament. It is expected that the new bill will be placed before the Diet for its second reading today and that the third and final reading will be early next week.\" The uncertainty and apprehension existing in the minds of the people were outlined in another Warsaw dispatch to the \"Evening Post\" two days later. It was asserted that \"the 'legality' of Marshal Pilsudski's procedure since the May revolution has not succeeded in averting international complications, which, as was expected, have arisen from his curious [VoL. 123. indirect dictatorship. As it is not clear to any one inside or outside Poland exactly who is responsible for the Government, there is a wide opportunity for the wildest rumors and in the neighboring countries, which were made most restive by the May coup, these rumors find ready credence.\" The correspondent further said that \"Pilsudiki needed only to call a Council of the War Ministry, which he heads, to awaken fears among all the small States surrounding Poland and give the Nationalist German press an opportunity to reveal the Polish war plans and thus add new fuel to its campaign to keep alive the German determination to recover the Polish corridor. That Pilsudski's Council actually laid any of the fantastic imperialistic plans attributed to it is officially denied and what all the world knows is emphasized, that Poland is in neither a political nor a financial position to undertake hostilities.\" Developments on Tuesday made the situation look more encouraging for Pilsudski. The New York \"Times\" representative in Warsaw cabled that evening that \"the new Government's program of reforms was sent forward to the third reading late this evening in a form which will undoubtedly meet with nearly unanimous approval in the final vote on Friday. While its measures are only a shadow of what the Government originally demanded, its approval definitely indicates that Premier Bartel has achieved a political success of great proportions, if not a genuine victory.\" He further declared that \"acceptance of the program by the various parties constitutes a vote of confidence and any such approval of the post-revolutionary Cabinet had heretofore been sternly withheld by the Seim. Moreover, the accord was reached after the Premier's bold statement yesterday which constituted a virtual declaration of independence from Marshal Pilsudski's dictatorship.\" The chief features of the program were given in part as follows in a special Warsaw wireless message under date of July 21: \"Parliamentarism has won a victory over dictatorship in Poland. The changes adopted in the second reading of the Government's bill in the Polish Parliament do not fundamentally impair the democratic constitution. They amount, rather, to merely technical reforms. The most radical reform authorizes the President to dissolve Parliament and gives Parliament the right to dissolve itself by a two-thirds vote. This power is mitigated by a stipulation that a new election shall be held within 90 days after dissolution. Such power as this is enjoyed by Presidents in a number of other countries with Parliamentary government; for instance, Germany. Parliament is further empowered to pass a bill giving the Government the right to issue decrees on certain questions at certain times, that is to say, to transfer full powers to the Government in case of a crisis. Whether Parliament will finally piss such a measure is still to be determined and will be debated only after the third reading of the Government's bill on Friday.\" Very little progress appears to have been made toward a settlement of the British coal miners' strike. Prime Minister Baldwin was said to have rejected the plan proposed by English clergy to solve the problem. On July 17 the London correspondent of the New York \"Times\" cabled that \"the interven- JULY 241926.] THE CHRONICLE tion of the churches in the coal stoppage is not likely to bring about a settlement. The proposals made by the leading Bishops of the Church of England and the Free Church leaders, and accepted by the miners, envisaged a further Government subsidy to enable work to be resumed for four months at the old wages. Stanley Baldwin, the Prime Minister, in a letter to the Bishop of Litchfield, stated emphatically that further subsidy is now out of the question.\" Apparently the strikers have been able to hold on largely because of the financial assistance received from outside sources. In a special cable dispatch from Paris to the New York \"Times\" on July 21 it was stated that \"all question as to who were the chief financial backers of the British coal miners' strike was set to rest to-night with an announcement from the International Miners' Federation that the Russian Soviet Government had contributed $2,100,000 to the British miners' unions with which to carry on the strike. A total of nearly $3,500,000 has been received from all sources, including foreign countries, for the striking miners. Although the actual figures for America were not given out, it is believed that a large share of that part of the fund described as 'from other sources' came from America. British mine leaders attending the present session of the Federation urged further and even larger contributions, so that the strike can be maintained for six months, if necessary. It became increasingly evident that hope of curtailing or entirely stopping shipments of coal from other nations to Britain is very slight. The British leaders plan to concentrate upon financial aid, so that the strike can be prolonged for several Months.\" There has been no change in official bank rates at leading European centres from 7/ 1 2% in Austria; 7% in Belgium and Italy; 6% in Paris and Berlin; 5/ 1 2% in Denmark and Norway; 5% in London and 2% in Sweden, and 3/ Madrid; 41/ 1 2% in Holland and Switzerland. In London open market discounts were still virtually unchanged, at 41/ 4@4 5-16% for / 8% for short bills short and long bills, as against 43 and .4 5-16@4%% for three months a week ago. Money on call in London was steady and closed at 1 2% last week. In Paris 31/ 4%,in comparison with 3/ the open market discount rate was advanced from 5/ 1 2% to 534%, but in Switzerland was quoted at 2%%, unchanged. The Bank of England in its latest weekly statement reported another addition to gold holdings, this time of £398,761, thus bringing the total up to £151,733,845, as against £163,234,260 last year and £128,269,723 in 1924 (before the transfer to the Bank of England of the £27,000,000 gold formerly held by the Redemption Account of the Currency Note Issue). Furthermore, circulation again declined—£122,000, with the result that the reserve of gold and notes in the banking department increased £521,000, while the proportion of reserve to liabilities advanced to 24.58%, as compared with 24.01% last week,31.%% a year ago and 18%% in 1924. Public deposits continue to shrink, a further reduction of £1,741,000 being shown, but \"other\" deposits increased £960,000. Loans on Government securities increased £1,615,000 and loans on other securities declined £2,934,000. Reserve aggregates £30,136,000, which compares with £39,592,625 a year ago and £21,747,- 377 003 the year before that. Note circulation aggregates £141,348,000, in comparison with £143,391,635 and £126,272,720 one and two years ago, respectively, while loans total £69,942,000, as against £69,761,557 in 1925 and £73,509,754 the year preceding. The Bank's official discount rate continues at 5%, unchanged. Clearings through the London banks for the week totaled £704,972,000, which compares with £762,852,000 a week ago and £687,880,000 last year.

This compares with 44,220,912,845 francs at the corresponding period in 1925 and with 40,081,713,400 francs for the same time in 1924. After the fall of the new Herriot-de Monzie Ministry on Wednesday (July 21), a law was passed authorizing the transfer to the Bank of France of the available balance of the Morgan credit, amounting to about $25,000,000, and also authorizing the Bank to raise the limit of the note issue by an equal amount, approximately 1,300,000,000 francs. Total obligations of the Government to the Bank of France were increased, by ark additional loan of 550,000,000 francs during the week,to 38,350,000,000 francs,the largest figure ever reached. In 1925 at the same date, advances to the State amounted to 27,400,000,000 francs and in 1924 they totaled 22,700,000,000. In the gold item a gain of 7,100 francs was reported. Total gold holdings now aggregate 5,548,647,425 franc swhich compares with the 5,546,831,184 francs and 5,543,407,548 francs respectively in 1925 and 1924. Changes among the other items in the Bank's return were: Silver gained 7,000 francs; trade advances were increased by 36,071,000 francs; Treasury deposits rose 25,371,000 francs, and general deposits expanded 621,151,000 francs. In contrast, bills discounted fell off 7,871,000 francs. Comparison of the various items in this week's return with the figures of last week and with corresponding dates in both 1925 and 1924 are as follows: BANK OF FRANCE'S COMPARATIVE STATEMENT.

Other liabilities increased 27,377,000 marks. Increases and decreases were about evenly divided in the matter of assets. Holdings of bills of exchange and checks were reduced 80,602,000 marks, but advances increased 5,224,000 marks, while there were increases also in silver and other coins of 4,523,000 marks; notes on other banks, 5,407,000 marks, and other assets, 73,209,000 marks. Reserve in foreign currencies fell 8,968,000 marks. Gold and bullion holdings, however, recorded another addition of 35,000 marks, to 1,492,304 marks. At this time a year ago the total was 1,068,673,000 marks and in 1924 469,372,000 marks. Outstanding note circulation equals 2,738,054,000 marks. Comparatively minor changes in gold holdings and substantial curtailment in both rediscounting and open market operations, were the outstanding features of the weekly Federal Reserve banks' statements, issued at the close of business on Tuesday. The.report for the entire System revealed a loss in gold reserve of $3,500,000, while rediscounting of paper secured by Government obligations fell $24,300,000. In other bills there was an increase of $4,800,000, so that total bills discounted were reduced $19,500,000. Holdings of bills purchased in the open market declined $16,700,000. Shrinkage was shown in all of the following items: Total bills and securities (earning assets), $44,400,000; Federal Reserve notes in actual circulation, $26,100,000; member bank- reserve accounts, $33,800,000, and deposits, $32,500,000. The New York Bank gained gold in its operations with interior institutions and reported an increase of $28,600,000. Rediscounts of Government secured paper were reduced $21,600,000, while other bills increased $2,400,000; the net result, therefore was a contraction in total bills discounted for the week of $19,200,000. Bill buying in the open market decreased $18,100,000. Declines in total bills and securities were $44,500,000 and in deposits 17,200,000. The output of Federal eserve notes was brought down $3,100,000, while member bank reserve accounts dropped $18,300,000. However, the falling off in deposits both locally and nationally served to more than offset all other changes, and reserve ratios advanced. For the banks as a group the ratio advanced 1.01%, to 76.0%. At New York a gain of 3.6%, to 83.0%, was shown. Last Saturday's statement of the New York Clearing House banks and trust companies showed further decreases in loans as well as in deposits, but a large decrease in surplus reserve, mainly the result of the drawing down of more than $20,000,000 in member bank reserves with the Federal Reserve Bank. The drop in the loan item amounted to $56,424,000, while net demand deposits were reduced $14,259,000, to $4,388,468,000. This total is exclusive of Government deposits to the amount of $21,537,000. In time deposits an increase of $961,000 occurred, bringing the total up to $604,858,000. Other comparatively minor changes included a decline of $538,000 in reserves of State banks and trust companies in own vaults and an increase of $204,000 [VOL. 123. in reserves kept by these institutions in other depositories. Cash in own vaults of members of the Federal Reserve Bank fell $5,734,000, to $42,926,000, which is not counted as reserve. Member banks, as noted above, drew down their reserves at the Reserve institution $20,696,000, with the result that surplus reserves, notwithstanding smaller deposits, fell off $19,222,400, to $11,329,240, which compares with $30,551,640 last week. The above figures for surplus are on the basis of 13% legal reserves against demand deposits for member banks of the Federal Reserve System, but do not include $42,926,000 cash in vault held by these members on Saturday last. Notwithstanding continued activity in the stock market, call money was extremely easy. It may be said that 4%, or a little higher, was the going rate for actual business. The New York Stock Exchange stated that the supply was ample and the demand not particularly active. These conditions prevailed, although for one day early in the week total sales of stocks on the Exchange exceeded 2,000,000 shares and rather closely approximated that level the greater part of the week. The tone of the time 1 2%, money market was a little firmer, with bids at 4/ imporSpecial higher, reported. even a little or tance was not attached to this development. In some circles, however, it was thought that it indicated firmer money later on, because of the increased demand to move the crops. Brokers' loans for the week ended July 14, as announced by the Federal Reserve Board, showed a decrease of $1,531,000 compared with the previous week. This was the first decrease for some time. The aggregate loans stood at $2,601,257,000, against the high level for this year so far of $3,141,125,000 on Jan. 6. The decrease was so small as not to be important in itself. Unless the volume of trading in stocks falls materially below recent levels and the reaction is carried further, it would not be at all logical to look for big decreased in the loan account. With the financial situation in France so acute and with most of the important currencies so severely depressed, there was no reason to look for the offering of European bonds in this market. Domestic offerings were on a rather good-sized scale. The steel trade is at least holding up, and the ingot production of the United States Steel Corporation has shown a further advance to about 87% of capacity. The Government weather report was not altogether favorable. With present conditions there is not likely to be especial change in the aggregate demand for funds in the near future. More money may be needed temporarily for harvesting and moving the crops, but the requirements from other sources may lessen somewhat. Dealing with specific rates for money, call loans have ranged between 4 and 43,1%, against 4@43/2% last week. However, with the exception of Monday, when renewals were negotiated at 414%, the high and the low was 4%; there was no range, call funds ruling on the remaining days of the week—Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday—at 4%, which was the only rate named during that entire period. For fixed date maturities the undertone was firmer and quotations advanced to 43/2% for sixty days, ninety days and four months, against 4%@43/27o, and five and ix months to 43/2@4%%, against JULY 24 1926.] THE CHRONICLE 432% a week ago. Toward the close the tone of the market was softer; but this was evidenced more by freer offerings, than by easing in rates. Trading continued quiet and featureless. Commercial paper was likewise firmer and four to six months' names of choice character are now quoted at 4%,as against 3%@4% last week. New England mill paper and the shorter choice names are being dealt in at 4%, as against 33 4 1% heretofore. Names not so well known continue to require 43.%. Country banks were the principal buyers, with trading only moderately active. Offerings are still restricted. Banks' and bankers' acceptances remain at the levels previously current. The demand was reported as light throughout, with offerings of prime names rather scarce. The market was in fact a dull affair, with trading inclined to be listless. For call loans against bankers' acceptances the posted rate of the American Acceptance Council has been reduced from 4% to 332%.

Small up,and down movements with no particular trend in one direction or the other, characterized trading in sterling exchange this week. Price levels were fairly steady and despite an utter lack of interest on the part of large operators, the range was only a trifle lower than that of the preceding week, with the extremes 4 86 3-32 and 4 859 for demand bills. The market was exceptionally dull and entirely devoid of news feature of any sort. Unfavorable influences still operative were the unsettled British coal strike, which is being viewed with growing alarm by leading financiers and business men throughout the country, and is certainly throttling Britain's industries, and the increasingly chaotic state of financial affairs in France. Although not directly affected by the latter, sterling showed an inclination to recede with 379 each fresh dip in the value of the fast vanishing franc. On the other hand, sterling profited to some extent by an inquiry on the part of those endeavoring to convert their franc holdings into some more stable form of currency. Nevertheless, taken as a whole, the market for sterling exchange can best be described as a waiting one with speculation reduced to a minimum, and large dealers maintaining an attitude of extreme caution in the matter of filling even routine requirements. As regards quotations in greater detail, sterling exchange on Saturday last was dull and narrow, with the undertone steady and demand unchanged from 4 86 (one rate) and cable transfers at 4 863/2. On Monday prices were maintained on quiet, featureless trading; a range of 4 85 15-16@4 86 1-32 prevailed for demand and 4 86 7-16@4 87 17-32 for cable transfers. Better buying sent rates up 1-16c. on Tuesday, and demand sold at 4 86@4 86 3-32 and cable transfers at 4 863/ 2@4 86 19-32; the market, however, was still inactive. Wednesday a slight reactionary trend developed and prices moved down to 4 85%@4 86 for demand and 4 863@4 863/ for cable transfers; freer offerings were the principal cause of the decline. Dulness was the chief characteristic of trading on Thursday, and there was a tendency to recession; demand sold down to 4 85%@4 85% and cable transfers to 4 863@4 86%, On Friday there was very little business transacted although rates were firmer at 4 85 13-16@4 85 29-32 for demand and 4 86 5-16@4 86 13-32 for cable transfers. Closing quotations were 4 85 29-32 for demand and 4 86 13-32 for cable transfers. Commercial sight bills finished at 4 85 25-32, sixty days at 4 82, ninety days at 4 803, and documents for payment (sixty days) at 4 823/ 8, and seven-day grain bills at 4 85 21-32. Cotton and grain for payment closed at 4 85 25-32. No gold was reported this week either for import or export to New York. Considerable interest is being shown in the announcement recently published that the $53,500,000 in gold that was transferred from France during the war against British advances to France, and mentioned in the Franco-British debt agreement, is at present in the vaults of the United States Federal Reserve Bank. This gold, according to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, was transferred to the United States during the war and has never been included with the British gold reserve. The Bank of England reported exports of £7,000 to Brazil, £15,000 to Holland, £18,000 to Spain, and imports of £137,000 in gold bars, also £250,000 in sovereigns from South Africa. Conditions bordering closely upon demoralization developed in Continental exchange trading this week, almost paralleling those witnessed during the war era, and French francs (which continue to shape opinion so far as other European currencies are concerned) suffered in all probability the severest slump in their history, at least to the lowestlevels. The reason for this collapse was primarily the downfall of the Briand-Caillaux Cabinet and with it the hopes of those who had looked to it for a solution of France's desperate financial problems. News that the Ministry had failed in its first test was immediately followed by a wild orgy of selling—speculative and otherwise—that swept the franc from 2.443/ (the opening figure) to 2.123. Formation of a so-called 380 Herriot Ministry evidently found little favor with French business interests, since instead of a rally, the new Cabinet was greeted by another wave of weakness that sent the franc crashing through the 2-cent mark to 1.94Y4.. By Wednesday, however, recovery set in and francs moved up about 24 points, to 2.20, in response to intimations that a coalition Cabinet might be formed. It is interesting to note that New York operators took little or no part in the proceedings; the declines for the most part occurring before the market had opened, and in fact reflecting the uneasiness and complete lack of confidence felt abroad in the position of France's currency. On the upturn moderate activity commenced,in the form of buying by several large local banks with French connections, which in turn led to active covering of short accounts. Still later in the week francs again firmed up and recovered nearly all of the spectacular losses recorded in the early dealings, touching 2.393/2, but no attempt was made in responsible banking circles to minimize the extreme gravity of the situation. News that M.Poincare, one of France's most eminent statesmen, had undertaken the difficult and delicate task of forming a national ministry, alive to the needs of the occasion and strong enough to bring about real rehabilitation, naturally exercised a reassuring effect, but could not shake off pessimism that is felt over the obstacles to be overcome. It is pointed out that the relief afforded by expenditure of the last of the Morgan reserve credit can only be temporary, since it also removes France's last bulwark against speculation by foreign interests, while in the present position of the French Treasury, it seems almost impossible to avoid further inflation, regardless of what steps are taken politically. Apparently, nothing but the arrangement of large foreign credits can bring about the needed stability, and there seems little prospect of anything of the sort at the present time. Belgian francs moved in sympathy with the French unit, though at an appreciably higher level. The range for the week was 2.45 to 2.16 on dull but irregular and nervous trading.
