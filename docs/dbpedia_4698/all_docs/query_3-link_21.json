The backbencher was re-elected to the Dail in 1997 having lost his seat in 1989.\n\nA former businessman, he also played Gaelic football for Dublin County and was also an international basketball coach.\n\nWright was not at his home or his constituency office yesterday to further discuss his shame.\n\nRadio shows were inundated with angry callers yesterday calling for Wright to resign.\n\nThe incident is a complete embarrassment to the Government, which has vowed to clamp down on drink- driving and road offences in general.\n\nFianna Fail Parliamentary Party Chairman Seamus Kirk said: \"On the issue of driving while intoxicated, Fianna Fail has reduced the blood alcohol limit allowed by law and increased the penalties for those convicted.\n\n\"The party believes everyone has a duty to observe the law in that regard and not endanger themselves or others by driving while over the allowable blood alcohol limit.\"\n\nCAPTION(S):\n\nAPOLOGY: Deputy GV Wright"
