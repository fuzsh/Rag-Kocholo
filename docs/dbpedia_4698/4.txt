NOTICE OF

DÁIL ELECTION

CONSTITUENCY OF DUBLIN BAY SOUTH

Pursuant to a writ issued to me by the Clerk of Dáil Éireann I am about to proceed to the election of one member of the Dáil for this constituency.

Nomination papers may be obtained from the address below during the usual office hours.

A person may nominate himself/herself as a candidate or may, with his/her consent, be nominated by a proposer who is registered as a Dáil elector in the constituency.

If no certificate is attached, the candidate must, before the latest time for receiving nominations, either-

secure 30 assents to the nomination by way of statutory declarations by Dáil electors registered in the constituency (forms available from me or the registration authority), or

Details of these requirements are set out in the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2007.

The latest time for receiving nominations is 12 noon on the 24th day of June, 2021.

Completed nomination papers may be delivered to me in person by the candidate or his/her proposer at any time when I am at my office, from 10am on the 19th day of June, 2021 until 12 noon on the last day for receiving nominations.

I am required by law to attend to receive nominations between 10am and 12 noon and between 2pm and 5pm on the 19th day of June, 2021 and between 10am and 12 noon on the 24th day of June, 2021.
