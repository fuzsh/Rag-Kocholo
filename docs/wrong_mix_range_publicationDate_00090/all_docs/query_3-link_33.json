        "text": "Humor is a way to show opinions in a light-hearted manner. The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy is a satire that talks about everything from religion to technology, politics to reality. Although the book is older, it is still relevant for readers today and the issues that are discussed are usually universal in their meaning, and to Society. Douglas Adams presents an idea as if it is ridiculous and it appears ridiculous to the reader, but then relates this ‘ridiculous’ idea in the day to day lives of the reader.\n\nThe first page of the book sets the satirical tone. Douglas provides us with an example of how society functions with the quote, “This planet has, or rather had, a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy …show more content…\n\nFor some reason, if a strag (strag: nonhitchhiker) discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, washcloth, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet-weather gear, space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitchhiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitchhiker might have accidentally lost. What the strag will think is that any man that can hitch the length and breadth of the Galaxy, ruff it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through and still know where his towel is, is clearly a man to be reckoned with” (21). This quote shows how Adams uses humorous ways to comment on society. Humans often make judgments upon each other on appearance or possessions, in this example the towel. Adams is saying that society has standards that others must live up to in order to be accepted. This towel is the standard “strags” must live up to, in real life that standard may be a house or a job, which some may not be able to afford. This is a humorous way to address a serious subject, because the idea that the towel is a determining factor over whether someone shall help another person is laughable. Apply this concept to reality and it sad that there are people who refuse to help others based on their appearance. This quote shows how Adams causes people to think with innocent humor, but develops into serious"
