The main character Arthur Dent is being targeted by these unprepossessing aliens to demolish his house to make a intergalactic bypass, when moments later they are going to destroy the earth. All Arthur can worry about is his house when the earth is going to end. In reality a normal human would be worried about surviving.

Satire is present in this situation because the answer to a theoretical question is distorted to cause humor in waiting millions of years just to find out all they were living for was a meaningless answer. In reality, there is no answer to life, it just comes and goes, and plays out as humans"
