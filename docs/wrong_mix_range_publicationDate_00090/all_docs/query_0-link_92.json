I don't know what my question is but I thought maybe you'd have an answer ðŸ’™\n\n32 years later, more and more people know and love Good Omens all around the world, and I'm happily making more of it, so as reviews go, it makes me wonder how badly the poor reviewer hated the English, and whether it might have been possible for the NYT to have found a reviewer who liked funny English books to review a funny English book, but it doesn't rip me apart. It just makes me happy that my reaction to most bad reviews over the years has been to shrug and to write the next thing.\n\nHaving said that, we took a quote from this review -- from the bit that goes ''Good Omens'' is a direct descendant of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,'' a vastly overpraised book or radio program or industry or something that became quite popular in Britain a decade ago when it became apparent that Margaret Thatcher would be in office for some time and that laughs were going to be hard to come by.\n\nJust as Douglas Adams worked his joke to death by juxtaposing the tedious lives of ordinary people with events of cosmic significance, so Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, two former journalists, go on and on for 354 pages with their schoolboy wisecracks about Good, Evil, the Meaning of Life and people who drink Perrier.\n\nand put \"A direct descendant of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,'\" The New York Times on the front of the paperback and undoubtedly sold a lot of copies.\n\nSo, yes. bad reviews happen. That's because different people like different things. That's not actually a problem, it's what allows us all to have books and shows we love without having to love them all, and it's what allows creative people to make a living. The important thing is to keep on creating."
