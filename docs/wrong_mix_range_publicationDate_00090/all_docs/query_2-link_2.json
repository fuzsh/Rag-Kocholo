Fforde's world-building is outstanding too - a richly detailed, zany account of life in a dystopian (and very cold) alternative Wales. The exposition is witty, and the story plays host to a large cast of rich and interesting characters. Show less\n\nAll copies in use.

What could a pantheon of unemployed gods, everyone's favorite renegade Galactic President, a lovestruck green alien, an irritating computer, and at least one very large slab of cheese have to do with all of this?

A bicycle courier becomes entangled in more that he bargained for when he is suddenly promoted, but with the new role comes new responsibilities. His current existence of drugs, sex, and highbrow partying will come under threat and he is forced to not only look to the future, but also fight for values he never knew he had!

Despite the silliness, though, the Discworld universe has its roots firmly in our own history, albeit the more obscure parts of it. And the characters are ones we all recognise and relate to. Go, read, and enjoy! Show less\n\nAll copies in use. Availability details\n\nAn amalgamation of William Shakespeare with Edgar Allen Poe, this satirical Venetian gothic is hard to pigeonhole.

Three dastardly plotters invite an even more dastardly dinner guest for a promised night of mayhem… then murder. Looking to dispose of the only roadblock to riches and respect, the three plotters eagerly await the aptly named “Fool”. But is he really? This isn’t Fools first rodeo, and he has plenty of tricks up his sleeve before the night ends. This book is a sequel to the original book where the character was first introduced, entitled “Fool”, but it is not essential reading to pick up the story. A bawdy tale filled with vulgarity and humour, read this if you like your Shakespeare stitched together with modern raunch Show less\n\nThere’s nothing worse than waking up and realising that history has changed, the German’s now have won WWII and all you can get for breakfast is bratwurst...Show more There’s nothing worse than waking up and realising that history has changed, the German’s now have won WWII and all you can get for breakfast is bratwurst and not a good old fashioned breakfast sausage. An absurd, funny and fantastical tale where it falls to our two protagonists to go back in time and fix whatever went wrong to get time back on track, solving 12 cases of cosmic conundrums that will hopefully lead them to the way to right the wrong now in world. Rankin's novels have a darker and more satirical feel to them than Pratchett's, and many are set in Brentford, London, which happens to be full of ancient evils and/or insane aliens. Read this if you like the absurdity of Douglas Adams.

Existing alongside our own world of Mundania, Xanthians all have a unique talent, which can manifest itself in any number of ways. A wildly popular long-running series.

The Heavenly Host's loss is humanity's gain when the angel Qaphsiel misplaces a very special box. It remains hidden until 2015, when Charlie \"Coop\" Cooper, a thief who specializes in stealing magical artefacts, purloins what he believes to be the score of a lifetime.
