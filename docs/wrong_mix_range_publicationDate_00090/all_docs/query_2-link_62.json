Timeless classic that still fares extremely well re-reading.\n\nI will frequently just purchase a few of the kindle deals they have for $1-$3. Best case you find a new author to explore, even in the worst case your out the cost of starbucks.\n\nHave you explored the Kindle Unlimited program? The Netflix of books has a certain appeal to it, and certainly lends itself to exploring new authors."
