        "text": "psynoid , October 02, 2008 (view all comments by psynoid)\n\nArthur Dent was only trying to save his house from being wrecked not knowing that the same was about to happen to his home planet. He was saved by his friend Ford Prefect before being turned into hydrogen, but this was just the start of a hilarious trip as the 2 hitchhikers traverse around the universe with the galaxy president Zaphod Beeblebrox, his secretary Trillian, and a stolen battle ship. I like the way the story unfolds, not unlike Terry Pratchett's style, only difference I see is that Pratchett's forte is fantasy, while Douglas Adams' work is science fiction -- a great satirist with the same sarcastic humor that would make you say to yourself \"ow... that really hits the spot!\"."
