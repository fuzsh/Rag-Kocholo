Though it was released in 1979, I think now is a perfect time to read this incredibly unique book. It’s lighthearted style, jokes, and enjoyable plot is sure to help reduce stress and anxiety over Covid. It is a science fiction story about protagonist Arthur Dent and his unexpected journey around the galaxy while meeting strange extraterrestrials and trying to get back home. While the plot is amazing, the aspect that sets this book apart from the rest is it’s humor. Douglas Adams has an amazing gift to include humor at the just right moments through many different forms. His unique cast of characters fit well with the humor of the story and Adam’s writing style.If you like sci-fi, or you just want a good laugh, then this is definitely the book for you! In this stressful time it is important to laugh and keep your spirits and this book definitely can do that. The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy is the first book in a five book series. I will warn that as the series goes on the plot gets a bit more confusing to follow, but I believe it is still a worthwhile read. The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy can be found wherever books are available and has an audiobook too."
