        "text": "David Freeman: Good evening. I'm David Freeman, you don't know me but you will know the other two. Over there is the man with more fans than Madonna, that's Terry Pratchett, and the man with political and terrorist prescience is Gerald Seymour, and I say that advisedly because he wrote about Afghanistan nearly 20 years ago.\n\nGerald Seymour: Yes, in 1982 during the Falklands war I went off to the North West Frontier and all those sorts of places, so there's a ring of familiarity going on.\n\nDF: Would you have predicted what's happening now?\n\nGS: No, no. I usually am accused of having a crystal ball into which I can gaze and look into the future and at the moment my crystal ball is utterly clouded. I don't know whether what happened on September 11 is the equivalent of the 3 September 1939, or whether it's the equivalent of that earthquake a few years ago in Japan from which we recovered quickly, or whether we're into a situation where our lives and attitudes are not going to be repeated. I'm about to sit down in the next two or three months and start another book, and, for the first time, I feel insecure and diffident because I've always had that comfort in feeling that I have a knowledge of what the world is about, and at the moment frankly, I don't have that.\n\nDF: Terry Pratchett, do you have a knowledge of the world that's reflected in your books? Do you have to research them in the way Gerald researches them?\n\nTerry Pratchett: It's very rare that I ever go and research a particular subject. I did it recently for the making of chocolate and also for the construction of clocks, because I didn't know enough about these subjects. Mostly I do serendipitous research, I read stuff, things spinning out of the page.\n\nHere's the sort of thing that happens with serendipitous research. Picture the scene, London 1846, a young lady is going to a ball. She has a new dress, it's made of something called tarlatan. It's the most beautiful green and it's a kind of foam silk. She has shoes made of it, a dress, a fan of tarlatan. It's a warm evening, she needs that fan as she dances, the windows are closed, it's rather humid, but she has a wonderful evening. She goes home feeling a bit tired and 24 hours later she has died a horrible death because the main component that makes tarlatan so green and shiny is copper arsenate, or to put it another way she has gone to the ball wearing enough arsenic to kill 50% of all the people there.\n\nThis was in the London Daily Post or something, 1866, and it's just a fact that somehow I enjoy the terrible death. I could see the scene, I could see her dancing, I saw it as a movie as I read it. I haven't the faintest idea if I'll ever use anything like that in a book, but the best research is the research that you don't know that you are doing. I'm sure we've both had the experience of thinking: I know about this, I know about this, I've read it somewhere. You turn round and look at your library - in my case my reference library is one wall of my office - and think it's somewhere in there and I haven't a dog's chance of remembering where I read it.\n\nDF: When you have an idea, how long has it been sitting in the cavern of your mind, before you find the angle on it?\n\nTP: This could be a tricky one. When people say \"How do you write a book, how does it all happen?\" I say, you line things up, and you line them up as actually as you possibly can, but sooner or later the book has got momentum and it's moving along under that momentum. It's like a sculpture, if you're working with the grain of the wood, the wood will start defining what shape it's going to become. What did worry me slightly was that I knew with the Four Horseman of the Apocalypse that the book would contain the fifth horseman who left before they became famous, creative differences and that sort of thing, but I didn't know what he represented. I had a few ideas - I gave him a name, a funny name, and there was a point in the book where a third party sees something which makes him realise what the true name of the fifth horseman is, and I realised that the funny name I had given him, because it was a funny name, actually contained that clue. Had I known what I was doing? Had I known all along who the fifth horseman was?\n\nDF: When you read up about you, it says that you seem to spend your life in Wiltshire, writing. Do you sit there in front of your computer making yourself giggle?\n\nTP: No.\n\nI'm pretty sure I speak for both of us on this. First of all you are a writer, a writer is what you are, so it doesn't actually stop the moment you leave your desk, your computer, your keyboard, whatever. Something is operating the back of your mind; in fact, it took me a long time to find this out. There are times when the best writing you can do is to go for a walk or drive, a long drive is ideal. Before now I have phoned up friends and said, \"Have you got a piece of paper? Write this down quickly\", because I can't stop and it's an idea...\n\nDF: Gerald, it said somewhere that your first priority is walking the dog, the second was walking two dogs and writing came third. Do you walk the dogs as an aid to your career?\n\nGS: Yes, it's very unfortunate. The two dogs go for this walk with me each morning and we have about five variations over our fields and our little valley in Somerset, south of Bath. They are very, very broad-minded labradors because they hear the most disgusting and revolting language, because I can use my dialogue - this is the practice time.\n\nAnd these poor brutes are wandering around desperately looking for pheasants to chase. And that's my solitary time. That's when I pretend I've got a proper job and this is the gap between leaving home and going to work.\n\nResearch, for me, is not a sort of muzzle velocity thing of copying out stretches of fighting weapons and things like that, but it's trying to get a mood, a mood of a place and style of people and it's also trying to boost my confidence and get the adrenalin flowing. I go off on my trips to odd places and dark corners, feeling somewhat apprehensive and nervous.\n\nWhen I worked at ITN it was marvellous because I had the metropolitan police press card which was recognised by everybody, including the provisional IRA, as being totally bona fide, and I also had an airline credit card with a great long string of digits and a 'q' on the end, which meant that I could fill a jumbo and fly down to Buenos Aires with 500 guests.\n\nSo when I handed those in I did feel somewhat isolated, and my first major trip was to go behind the inner German fence and all the barbed wire stuff and the big dogs and the minefields and the automatic guns... I went in the middle of the night from Hanover to Magdeburg, and when we got to the border, which was all floodlights, and pulled in at the platform, there were chaps there in black boots with whopping big alsatians.\n\nWe all had to get off, and there were very few people on the train going into East Germany at about 1 o'clock in the morning and I was feeling very sorry for myself, thinking that maybe I should have stayed in my day job. Anyway, I handed my passport in and the chap looked at it and it was upside down, so the other chap turned it up the other way and gave me a withering stare. Then another chap came to look at it, and another chap, then finally the moment came and they stamped the visa. I took it back and looked at it, and I was the seventh person to go through. So they'd stamped it '007'.\n\nDF: You seem to lead such a gentlemanly, urbane existence. Where do you meet your drug dealers? There's a bit in your new book where someone says something derogatory about the bad guy, and ends up with his hands and tongue gone. Where does all that come from?\n\nGS: It comes from the National Criminal Detection Service, it comes from Customs and Excise Investigation Service...\n\nDF: So that's what VAT men do if you don't pay?\n\nGS: VAT men will strap you on to a stretcher and feed you into a central heating system.\n\nYou go up a little back staircase at the Old Bailey and you sit in the public gallery. All life is in the Old Bailey. I wanted to see a real-life example of the power of organised crime. There was a young fellow, 30, a member of Twickenham rugby club - which meant he should have been all right - he worked for the Crown Prosecution Service on the serious case desk. He had been bought for just two or three thousand pounds by the principal crime family in London. He had supplied this family with the name and address of the wife and children of the chief CPS solicitor working on the investigation.\n\nSo he is a bad guy, a big, useless lump of lard who tried to ingratiate himself with the jury by smiling at them all the time. Sitting next to me are his parents. Mum looks like she's been through two years of hell, and dad was a former detective sergeant at Scotland Yard. So sitting next to them, my mind is racing for six hours as to what their son has done to them.\n\nIt's that sense of place and presence that spurs you on. I'll read nothing about those parents in a national newspaper, but I can make a chapter out of them. So it's going into dark corners on your own and just absorbing moods.\n\nDF: Terry, you think that Gerald does 'place' very well. What do you have in mind?\n\nTP: The last book I read of his was Holding the Zero, and I recall it cinematically. The grey landscape, the dust, the cold, the heat. I could almost trace the sniper across the Kurdish countryside. But I was thinking that the best research you can do is to talk to people. Before I wrote part of Carpe Jugulum, I spoke to a couple of old ladies who had been midwives before the last war. Can you imagine what it's like when you are the only real, practical source of medical knowledge for the people around you?\n\nThe decisions they had to make in some cottage bedroom, at the beginning of a life or at the end of it... when someone says, \"Is there anything you can do for grandfather?\" when he's screaming upstairs, they don't mean give him another pillow. They were saying that a lot had to go on that wasn't talked about because someone had to make a decision and it was always going to be the 'wrong' decision. Some of my best sources are ex-policemen, just to get a feeling of what it's like to be one. And it's quite different from being a civilian - except, of course, that I believe that policemen are just special sorts of civilians. Things like how hard it is to hold someone that doesn't want to be held. They probably need six people - or five if one can sit on his stomach - to hold him. This is the kind of thing that is worth knowing.\n\nI was also on a paper for many years, and I spent a lot of that time in small towns. I would get to know the police and a lot of what was going on. One of the important things about being a small-town reporter is knowing what not to put in the paper. I once went for a walk with a guy who'd been working for a small newspaper for 50 years and I said to him, \"Wasn't it rather dull?\"\n\nHe said, \"Well, let's see now. See that house there? That's where they caught a man doing something he shouldn't with a common barnyard fowl. And I remember that because in court he said, 'Well, it's my hen.'\"\n\nDF: That didn't make a page lead?\n\nTP: Absolutely not. We're talking local newspapers here.\n\n\"That's where they locked a girl up in an attic for having a double-headed baby.\" Obviously the town deserved to be run by the Soddom and Gomorrah district council.\n\nSome of the stuff he knew you just couldn't report. How the hell would you do it? He'd been turning in the copy about the flower shows and the obituaries for years and years.\n\nDF: You were the front man for the British nuclear industries for a while, weren't you?\n\nTP: I spent far more time spinning lies for newspaper editors than I did for engineers, that I can tell you. By and large, I worked for the nuclear industry during a period when we were telling the truth. Because they'd tried telling everything else and it hadn't worked.\n\nDF: I have this vision of you being a sort of spin doctor...\n\nTP: No. At that time the Central Electricity Generating Board did employ journalists as press officers, which meant that you came with a pretty good idea of how newspapers would react to certain bits of news. It got to the point where I would ring up the Western Daily Press and say, \"I have to tell you, we lost a generator tonight but it should be back on tomorrow. But no one's going to die.\"\n\nAnd they would say, \"Why are you telling us, if it's not important?\"\n\n\"Because if you hear it from some other contact at midnight that there's a great hoo-haa at the power station, I'm now telling you exactly what it is. If you have any questions, ring me up.\"\n\nDF: Were you a consumer of fantasy in your spare time?\n\nTP: I discovered fantasy and science fiction when I was about 10, and read nothing else for about three years. I ran out of all the books that there were to read in the library. So I started reading palaeontology, because that's practically science fiction. So is archaeology, so is ancient history. I did not differentiate. I was just keen on reading stuff that took me to other places.\n\nSometimes the 'other place' can be this place, 65m years ago. So I got myself an education. Certainly in the late 70s and early 80s there were a lot of bad copies of Tolkien around. Just as Douglas Adams could only write Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy when enough people knew what the cliches were in science fiction so it was worthwhile parodying them, I started writing Discworld when fantasy imagery had been on heavy-metal covers. It was time to start having fun with it.\n\nDF: Gerald and I were talking about the ultimate accolade. For Douglas Adams, we found a website that permanently broadcasts Hitchhiker, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. In your world, Gerald, would that be having your stuff made into a film?\n\nGS: I started off in the slipstream created by Frederick Forsyth's Day of the Jackal - 1972. All over Fleet Street, journalists were tapping away in their spare time because it seemed like writing a thriller was the thing to do.\n\nI remember reading Jackal on a flight to Madrid to see an execution of Eta activists, and it kept me alive. It was a horrible night. We all started writing, and within a year or so, Day of the Jackal was a major film.\n\nI've never had a film. I've had several television series. I've found that an increasing number of novelists are a bit disenchanted with it. Very rarely does anyone say that the TV is better than the book. We all hope that TV will bring something added to the book - not just an audience - it will bring an interpretation and skills that you may not have as a writer.\n\nThe first one I had televised, Harry's Game, I thought that was brilliant. I love it. It was about Northern Ireland, and they were so terrified of what they'd bought that they really interfered with the story very little. What appeared on the screen was a filming of the book. With each one I've had on, the changes have become more and more considerable. The latest one bears very little relation to the story.\n\nDF: Is it difficult to be a thriller writer when the world is on a roller coaster?\n\nGS: Yes. It probably is. I try to discover situations and pressures on people which are not generally available to the public. I'm not a journalist any more. What gives me a huge buzz is when a commander of Scotland Yard or a general in Bosnia says to his acolytes, \"You can say what you like about Seymour, he's not a journalist.\" Because I now don't have to stick a microphone up somebody's nostril and I don't have a camera lens behind my shoulder, I think people talk to me in a much franker way.\n\nTerry, you spoke about talking to people, but what we really mean is we listen. If we can get people to relay those secret anecdotes...\n\nTP: The important thing is to not show how important the thing they've just told you is, in case they get frightened...\n\nTP: I think the biggest accolade is to become part of the language in some way. \"It's like something out of...\" I remember thinking that on September 11th - we're now in a Tom Clancy novel, and the worst news is that Jack Ryan isn't president. Lots of people were saying that. Though Tom Clancy said he wouldn't write a novel that was quite as far-fetched as that.\n\nFor quite a long time, 42 will be the secret of life, the universe and everything. I don't know how long it will survive, but it will probably survive for as long as 1984 is a relevant date. Movies come and go - in my case they come and go but never get made... Authors on the whole don't make huge amounts of money out of films.\n\nDF: I was looking through the Pratchett chatrooms, and you seem to have the ability to write for an audience that thinks that you're writing for each of them individually. They seem to have a personal relationship with you. Is that how it feels?\n\nTP: I don't quite know how it happens. If you work on local newspapers then there is a complicity - both you and the readership believe that Preston is a really important place. The rest of the country does not. People expect their wedding or funeral - of course, they don't complain if their funeral isn't mentioned - but they expect to see things in the newspaper, and the smaller the town, the more this happens. I don't know whether that lends something to one's writing, but you're always, as a journalist, aware that there's a readership out there. The book is not completely written until someone else has read it.\n\nI occasionally do read some books that were written in order to have been written. Some of them get awards. Genre authors, by and large, write books that are meant to be read.\n\nYoung fans send me slices of their birthday cake.\n\nDF: I think that's wonderful, don't you?\n\nTP: Ever since the cannabis incident I've thought it is.\n\nDF: What do they send you, Gerald?\n\nGS: I am one of the world's dreadful technophobes. I listen to discussions about cyberspace and the internet... We were on the internet, but it's broken down and I've unplugged it. That's why Holding the Zero was about sniping, because it's the oldest form of military procedure and hasn't changed in the last 100 years.\n\nTP: I have to interrupt, because you'll be too modest. There's a movie out called Enemy at the Gate. When you watch it, I suggest you read Holding the Zero to see what it ought to have been. It makes a nod at the peculiar world of the sniper, but I was absolutely riveted by Holding the Zero, even though I knew how it was going to turn out.\n\nGS: I go away, and I try to do my research. There was one evening when I was staying in a small village, and there were a couple of people who'd been, in their National Service, to an old RAF base - currently an Iraqi base. One fellow, Charlie, remembered the flies, he remembered the tents and the dirt runway. So I thought we'd weave a bit of back-plot into this place.\n\nA letter arrives from Hainault in Essex from an activist in the veterans association connected with this place. Apparently this base had the best quarters that they'd ever lived in. The runway was not one runway of dirt, but three of concrete. Those are the sorts of letters I get - I've got something wrong. The only thing to do is to grovel and write a really nice letter back.\n\nThis starts a little correspondence, because they've obviously shown the letter to her indoors and she's said, \"You were bloody miserable writing that letter, because he's sent such a lovely letter back.\" So I then get a really apologetic letter saying sorry for disturbing me! But if you get something wrong and you're trying to create an image of exactitude then it flattens people hugely. I take that as a mortal pain.\n\nDF: Terry, do you find endings difficult - do you find it hard to stop?\n\nTP: There's what I call the cigarettes. Most novels have them. What happens after the end of the action - the things necessary to bring the whole thing to a conclusion. I think what drove me away from being a reporter was an inability to accept that the world came in neat stories. You'd do a 150-word story about something, but that's not the real story. Every story you have to report is just part of something bigger. The news isn't what happened last night - it's some cumulative thing that's happened over centuries. I found it hard to think of one event and drag it out of a bubbling pot and present it as the story that explains it all.\n\nWith endings, I want to cover all the loose ends, every possible one. With Small Gods, I did not know how it was going to end until the last page. I felt that my options were narrowing and the story actually bought itself to the only conclusion that it could possibly reach; once I finished it I realised it had to go like that.\n\nDF: Is it the same with you Gerald? Because this one has got a great ending. Is it working back from that, have you started 100 pages back before the ending, zeroing in on that point?\n\nGS: No, I don't know what the ending will be. I have a four- or five-page outline, I draft maybe a page of notes for each of the 10 chapters and after that we fly. That's the excitement for me, the adrenalin; the desire to succeed has a lot less compulsion than the fear of failure. It's terrifically exciting not knowing how it's going to be.\n\nDF: A question, a comment to either of these two gentlemen, or both?\n\nQ: Do you find that you spend more time actually redrafting a book than you do coming up with the original idea?\n\nGS: Dr Johnson, I think it was, said that \"guests, like fish, go off after three days\".\n\nIn my case the house guests have probably come in for nine months to a year. At the time that I think I've finished the story I'm desperate to get the spare bedroom back, so to speak. So I don't tend to redraft, I will try to tidy it up, but basically I feel what I write down first has got the impetus, it may be clumsy, it may be repetitive, but a good editor can take that out. That first writing bit is the best thing you will do. Get yourself in position, spend time researching, thinking, preparing. Once I go, I hit it and then hope that someone else will make it readable.\n\nTP: I, on the other hand am a technophile, so there is no such thing as a first draft. The first draft plunges on, and about a quarter of the way through it I realise I'm doing things wrong, so I start rewriting it. What you call the first draft becomes rather like a caterpillar; it is progressing fairly slowly, but there is movement up and down its whole length, the whole story is being changed. I call this draft zero, telling myself how the story is supposed to go.\n\nPerhaps a third of the way through or more something will happen as a direct result of the characters and situations I have set up - emerging behaviour, something that I have not planned for when I started the book. By the time you write the last page you have done half the book. The other half tends to get done in about five weeks; I do several drafts, very, very furiously rewriting. I literally do more or less nothing else and I stick with it and go through it and I begin to hate it. After you've been working fairly intensively on a novel for six months you never want to see the damn thing again.\n\nA dreadful thing starts to happen - you start rewriting good passages because you've read them so often that they are now becoming dull. You have to keep saying: someone who is reading it for the first time is probably going to enjoy that bit. Towards the end of a book I start holding out a promise to myself, \"If you're a good boy and do all your editing...\"\n\nFor The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents there was with an editor in America, an editor in the UK, and two managing editors who were taking a lot of interest, and everyone was having opinions about it. I was going mad. I thought it was going to be a children's book that I could write simply in three months, but it took about seven months of incredibly hard work. I say to myself, \"If you're a good boy and eat up all your editing lacquer - you'll be allowed to write another book afterwards.\"\n\nThere;s that lovely thing for the first month or two of writing a new book: OK, I don't know what that character's going to do, but we'll find out later. After about three or four months you come to that bit where you've got to put some plot in before it's too late, and you have to go back and start inserting plot, and, ooh, I've left out the literature, OK, lets put some in. It's actually true that I keep myself going by constantly promising myself that in response for the hard work I will be allowed to do some more hard work later on.\n\nDF: Is there anybody itching to say one last thing?\n\nQ: Mr Pratchett, what gave you the idea for Discworld?\n\nTP: This is a good example of serendipitous research. When I was about 10 or 11 I was very interested in astronomy because you were allowed to stay up all night.\n\nI later found out that you had to do maths as well, and astronomy largely consisted of doing maths in a small room in Cambridge. I subsequently found out that all science is doing maths somewhere, even oceanography is probably doing maths in a small room in Southampton. I realised what I really wanted to be was a journalist, so I could take an interest in astronomy without having to do all the hard bits. In the books of astronomy, you've always got a little chapter that in the 50s probably had a heading that meant, even though it didn't say, \"Let's have a laugh at all those silly old Greeks and the kind of things they believed.\" Invariably there would be a description of what effectively is the Discworld.\n\nI've seen a 16th-century woodcut of something like the Discworld. The idea that the world goes through space on the back of an enormous turtle is something that's common to a large number of cultures, past and present, from this planet. I don't know why. It's not an obvious beast to carry the world through space, I mean they go underwater quite a lot. I don't know if there's a turtle-shaped hole in our racial consciousness. When I needed a ridiculous world... I wanted to write, in effect, an antidote to fantasy. I thought let's take a ridiculously, self-evidently foolish world, but put the people on it, and make them as real as possible. The Discworld was ready made. It belonged to world mythology but I stole it and ran away before the alarms went off.\n\nDF: Terry? Birthday cake?\n\nTP: The next time someone offered me birthday cake I asked if it had cannabis in it. The following year the same guy turned up with a big cake with a cannabis leaf iced on it and the words \"Not a cannabis cake\" written on it."
