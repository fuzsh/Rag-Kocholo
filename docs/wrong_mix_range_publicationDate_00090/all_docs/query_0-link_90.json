        "text": "Neil Gamian and Terry Pratchett, 1990\n\nthe seventeenth book in the visitor recommendation series;\n\nsuggested by Øyvind Thorsby\n\nA while back a few articles were circulating around about how poverty forces people into making shortsighted decisions. Instead of buying a $100 pair of shoes that will last you five years, you keep buying $10 pairs that last a few weeks, because you never have a full $100 to spare. I've made a lot of bad decisions in my life, both major and minor, and of the minor ones, there's one that really eats at me, and it's related to this phenomenon. In 1998 my interactive fiction story Photopia won a competition, and I got first pick of the prizes on offer. At the time, I was close to flat broke. My ATM receipts informed me that I wasn't even a hundredaire. So I picked a cash prize: $150, which I spent on I have no idea what. What I did not pick, and what I have bitterly regretted not picking ever since, was the chance to have a scene from Photopia illustrated by renowned X-Men artist Dave Cockrum. By the time I had saved up enough to pay for a commission and thereby make up for my mistake, Cockrum had died. I have a blank spot on my wall where that picture should go.\n\nI did make a good choice at the same time, though. The top finishers of the '98 IF competition also got certificates signed by the Infocom author of their choice, and as the winner, I got first pick. I chose Douglas Adams. I was glad that I hadn't come in second, because I didn't really have a second choice; I had poked at a couple of the Infocom games as a kid, but they didn't really mean much to me. But I'd gone crazy for the Hitchhiker books when I was eleven, like every other eleven-year-old nerd in the world. Three years later I picked up a book called Don't Panic: The Official Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Companion by some guy named Neil Gaiman. Two years after that I was in college and came to know a guy named Bob who, like me, was into comic books. He was talking about a new miniseries that was coming out — I think it was The Books of Magic — and said, \"It's by Neil Gaiman, so it'll be dark and literary and concerned with the occult.\" This was the first time I had ever heard that name spoken aloud. I was like, what? The Douglas Adams guy?? Later I read some of The Sandman and couldn't stop boggling that the goths' favorite author was the same person who'd written a companion book to a series about Ravenous Bugblatter Beasts and Pan-Galactic Gargle Blasters."
