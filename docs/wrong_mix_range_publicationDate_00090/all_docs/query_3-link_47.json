        "text": "The Hitchiker’s Guide to the Galaxy\n\nBy: Douglas Adams\n\nMy Rating: Four out of Five Stars\n\nBest for: 14 and up\n\nDon’t judge. I never read The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.\n\nIt’s basically the Monty Python and the Holy Grail for fans of science fiction–a little bit funny, a little bit stupid, and a lot bit woven into every inside joke that everyone gets but you.\n\nBut never again! Because, I never read The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy…\n\nUntil now.\n\nIt’s a tongue-in-cheek journey through the universe after Earth gets destroyed to make way for an inter-galactic highway, and it’s everything I expected it to be. See my clever comment above about Monty Python. Well done, me.\n\nIf you’re like me and your knowing laughter at all those inside jokes has been nothing but a lie, go ahead and read The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. You owe it to yourself.\n\nOh, and btw–it’s a lot of fun, too.\n\nNo language, sex, or violence. Plenty of goofy jokes and gags that will probably be over the heads of our youngest ScyFy fans, though. 14 and up is probably a good target.\n\nHappy Reading!"
