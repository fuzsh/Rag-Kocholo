        "text": "Douglas Adams' writing style is full of wit, wry humor, and dark comedy. The writing style is very similar to that of Monty Python and is quite typical of classic British humor employing word play, funny back and forth dialogue between characters, and the liberal use of ridiculous situations. Adams' prose is long winded and descriptive. he constantly wanders off into humorous tangents in order to explain his viewpoint or elaborate upon an event. In the style of a field guide, Adams' novel often breaks the fourth wall and refers to itself, its characters, and places, events, and creatures within its own universe. Adams will often lead the reader on for the entirety of a lengthy sentence only to provide a small twist at the end. Adams' humor is both slice of life while at the same time resonating on an existential scale. His jokes are about daily occurrences and common rituals but tie together to show us great truths about time, space, and humanity. Absurdity and comedy are his bread and butter. Included here are some quotes which showcase Adams' unique and humorous writing style.\n\n1. “For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much—the wheel, New York, wars and so on—whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man—for precisely the same reasons.”\n\n(Much of the book is a satirical analysis of humanity's flaws and absurdities. Adams constantly makes observations about human nature and society throughout the novel.)\n\n2. “You know,\" said Arthur, \"it's at times like this, when I'm trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse, and about to die of asphyxiation in deep space that I really wish I'd listened to what my mother told me when I was young.\"\n\n\"Why, what did she tell you?\"\n\n\"I don't know, I didn't listen.”\n\n(Here's an example of Adams' \"twist\" in action.)\n\n3. “A towel, [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy] says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have. Partly it has great practical value. You can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapors; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a miniraft down the slow heavy River Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (such a mind-boggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see you); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough.”\n\n(Adams seems to enjoy seeing how long he can captivate our attention by stringing together ridiculous lists. He seems to revel in the length of his own absurdity)\n\n4. “O Deep Thought computer,\" he said, \"the task we have designed you to perform is this. We want you to tell us....\" he paused, \"The Answer.\"\n\n\"The Answer?\" said Deep Thought. \"The Answer to what?\"\n\n\"Life!\" urged Fook.\n\n\"The Universe!\" said Lunkwill.\n\n\"Everything!\" they said in chorus.\n\nDeep Thought paused for a moment's reflection.\n\n\"Tricky,\" he said finally.\n\n\"But can you do it?\"\n\nAgain, a significant pause.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Deep Thought, \"I can do it.\"\n\n\"There is an answer?\" said Fook with breathless excitement.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Deep Thought. \"Life, the Universe, and Everything. There is an answer. But, I'll have to think about it.\"\n\n...\n\nFook glanced impatiently at his watch.\n\n“How long?” he said.\n\n“Seven and a half million years,” said Deep Thought.\n\nLunkwill and Fook blinked at each other.\n\n“Seven and a half million years...!” they cried in chorus.\n\n“Yes,” declaimed Deep Thought, “I said I’d have to think about it, didn’t I?\"\n\n[Seven and a half million years later.... Fook and Lunkwill are long gone, but their ancestors continue what they started]\n\n\"We are the ones who will hear,\" said Phouchg, \"the answer to the great question of Life....!\"\n\n\"The Universe...!\" said Loonquawl.\n\n\"And Everything...!\"\n\n\"Shhh,\" said Loonquawl with a slight gesture. \"I think Deep Thought is preparing to speak!\"\n\nThere was a moment's expectant pause while panels slowly came to life on the front of the console. Lights flashed on and off experimentally and settled down into a businesslike pattern. A soft low hum came from the communication channel.\n\n\"Good Morning,\" said Deep Thought at last.\n\n\"Er..good morning, O Deep Thought\" said Loonquawl nervously, \"do you have...er, that is...\"\n\n\"An Answer for you?\" interrupted Deep Thought majestically. \"Yes, I have.\"\n\nThe two men shivered with expectancy. Their waiting had not been in vain.\n\n\"There really is one?\" breathed Phouchg.\n\n\"There really is one,\" confirmed Deep Thought.\n\n\"To Everything? To the great Question of Life, the Universe and everything?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nBoth of the men had been trained for this moment, their lives had been a preparation for it, they had been selected at birth as those who would witness the answer, but even so they found themselves gasping and squirming like excited children.\n\n\"And you're ready to give it to us?\" urged Loonsuawl.\n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"Now?\"\n\n\"Now,\" said Deep Thought.\n\nThey both licked their dry lips.\n\n\"Though I don't think,\" added Deep Thought. \"that you're going to like it.\"\n\n\"Doesn't matter!\" said Phouchg. \"We must know it! Now!\"\n\n\"Now?\" inquired Deep Thought.\n\n\"Yes! Now...\"\n\n\"All right,\" said the computer, and settled into silence again. The two men fidgeted. The tension was unbearable.\n\n\"You're really not going to like it,\" observed Deep Thought.\n\n\"Tell us!\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Deep Thought. \"The Answer to the Great Question...\"\n\n\"Yes..!\"\n\n\"Of Life, the Universe and Everything...\" said Deep Thought.\n\n\"Yes...!\"\n\n\"Is...\" said Deep Thought, and paused.\n\n\"Yes...!\"\n\n\"Is...\"\n\n\"Yes...!!!...?\"\n\n\"Forty-two,\" said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm.”\n\n(The humor is different from what one would expect. Who would ever expect the punchline of a joke to be the number 42?)\n\n5. “Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mind-bogglingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see it as the final and clinching proof of the non-existence of God.\n\nThe argument goes something like this: \"I refuse to prove that I exist,'\" says God, \"for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing.\"\n\n\"But,\" says Man, \"The Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don't. QED.\"\n\n\"Oh dear,\" says God, \"I hadn't thought of that,\" and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic.\n\n\"Oh, that was easy,\" says Man, and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing.”\n\n(Here we have an example of some of Adams' own personal beliefs making their way into his writing.)\n\n6. “Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.”\n\n(The book's commentary frequently develops a philosophical side especially when discussing humanity. The book as a whole is very philosophical as it deals mainly with the problem of life.)\n\n7. “Another thing that got forgotten was the fact that against all probability a sperm whale had suddenly been called into existence several miles above the surface of an alien planet.\n\nAnd since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale, this poor innocent creature had very little time to come to terms with its identity as a whale before it then had to come to terms with not being a whale any more.\n\nThis is a complete record of its thoughts from the moment it began its life till the moment it ended it.\n\nAh … ! What’s happening? it thought.\n\nEr, excuse me, who am I?\n\nHello?\n\nWhy am I here? What’s my purpose in life?\n\nWhat do I mean by who am I?\n\nCalm down, get a grip now … oh! this is an interesting sensation, what is it? It’s a sort of … yawning, tingling sensation in my … my … well I suppose I’d better start finding names for things if I want to make any headway in what for the sake of what I shall call an argument I shall call the world, so let’s call it my stomach.\n\nGood. Ooooh, it’s getting quite strong. And hey, what’s about this whistling roaring sound going past what I’m suddenly going to call my head? Perhaps I can call that … wind! Is that a good name? It’ll do … perhaps I can find a better name for it later when I’ve found out what it’s for. It must be something very important because there certainly seems to be a hell of a lot of it. Hey! What’s this thing? This … let’s call it a tail – yeah, tail. Hey! I can can really thrash it about pretty good can’t I? Wow! Wow! That feels great! Doesn’t seem to achieve very much but I’ll probably find out what it’s for later on. Now – have I built up any coherent picture of things yet?\n\nNo.\n\nNever mind, hey, this is really exciting, so much to find out about, so much to look forward to, I’m quite dizzy with anticipation …\n\nOr is it the wind?\n\nThere really is a lot of that now isn’t it?\n\nAnd wow! Hey! What’s this thing suddenly coming towards me very fast? Very very fast. So big and flat and round, it needs a big wide sounding name like … ow … ound … round … ground! That’s it! That’s a good name – ground!\n\nI wonder if it will be friends with me?\n\nAnd the rest, after a sudden wet thud, was silence.\n\nCuriously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was Oh no, not again. Many people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the universe than we do now.”\n\n(The absurdity exhibited here by the improbability drive allows us another full view of Adams' literary style. It's lengthy, funny, witty, philosophical, and at no point does it ever make coherent sense. It's akin to Alice in Wonderland in space.)"
