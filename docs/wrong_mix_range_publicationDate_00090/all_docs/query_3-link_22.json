But it does have a lot of very dry and quirky humour, and I know a lot of people just don't get it at all, so if you have enjoyed it, then I'm pleased.\n\nAnd you're right - there is a lot of hidden depth in there; once you go past the jokes and silliness, he does actually touch on some quite deep philosophical areas.\n\nHakoona said:\n\nAlso, has anybody else noticed how similar the book is to british sitcoms? Just a strange thought I had.\n\nWell, it was originally a British radio sitcom, so that's understandable. They also made a TV series in the 80s, and there's a movie version in production right now which should be released next year.\n\nSpudley said:\n\nHakoona said:\n\nusualy tis kind of reading isn't my cup of tea\n\nSo presumably it is your cup of something almost but not quite entirely unlike tea?\n\nHakoona said:\n\nIt's very silly and not as funny as everybody told me it was, but it does get you to thinking about allot of stuff ad it's deeper than it first apears.\n\nPersonally, I love it - it is every bit as funny as they say; I find new things that make me laugh out loud every time I read it.

Very interesting that the sitcom was based on a show. The movie has potential to be the most annoying thing since Barny the Dinosaur.\n\nHakoona said:\n\nThe movie has potential to be the most annoying thing since Barny the Dinosaur.\n\nHehe. Yes, you're right - it could be awful. And millions of HHGG fans around the world are praying it won't be.\n\nIts a very similar situation to the Lord of the Rings movies when they were released -- both books have a massive base of extremely loyal fans, who will be utterly scathing of anything that isn't perfect. The movie producers are treading a very fine line; it has to appease the fans, but still be accessible to everyone else. If they pull it off, it will be a triumph. If they don't, it will be a disaster.\n\nThe biggest problem the movie producers have is that Douglas Adams died a couple of years ago, so this will be the first HHGG project that he hasn't been directly involved in. That could be used by the more obsessive fans as a way to attack it. (though the can hardly blame him for dying can they?!)\n\nIt's worth pointing out that the TV series had some very cheesy effects, but nevertheless managed to capture the essence of the book quite well, and is generally well liked by the fans.\n\nI simply adore Hitchhiker's Guide! I grew up reading them ... at every stage in my life I found something deeper and funnier to enjoy in them. I never get bored of reading them, because they seem to grow with me! Douglas Adams was a genius. Such a clever clever guy ... the plots of all his books, the Dirk Gently ones too, have this knack of being able to appear silly and chaotic on the surface, but actually when you think about it, are incredibly complex and telling.\n\nI know his humour is not everyone's cup of tea, but like all true fanatics that's something I have great difficulty comprehending. For me they are in many ways, perfect.\n\nIt seems, that when you meet someone who understands Douglas Adams as you do, you've met someone that understands you.\n\nOooh I'm reading \"The Ultamite Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy\"\n\nI'm on the third book I think. and I totally agree that its not as funny as I was told. But it is funny and I'm really enjoying it!\n\nI think when some one tells you something is funny you expect it to be funnier. Maybe people should just say its a great book and not mention the funnyness. Thats my theory anyway.\n\nSpudley said:\n\nIts a very similar situation to the Lord of the Rings movies when they were released -- both books have a massive base of extremely loyal fans, who will be utterly scathing of anything that isn't perfect.

None of the formats were exactly like the previous one, so they have some leniency there.\n\nPossibly the funniest books I have ever read."
