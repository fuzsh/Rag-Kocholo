        "text": "Synopsis: Arthur Dent is understandably upset when his house is demolished by a council order in order to make way for a new bypass. His mood is not improved by the fact that the Earth itself is demolished immediately afterwards to make way for a hyperspatial express route. Luckily for Arthur, he is taken right off the Earth seconds before this happens. And all thanks to his new friend, Ford Prefect, a galactic hitchhiker.\n\nZaphod Beeblebrox is one of the most successful Presidents the Galaxy has ever had ‚Äì he has already spent two of his ten presidential years in prison for fraud.\n\nNow before you get the pitchforks and come for me, I found The Hitchhiker‚Äôs Guide to the Galaxy to be an interesting, thought-provoking book. The dry humour is also right up my alley. The unconventional style of writing also really sticks out for this book.\n\nBut all that being said, Hitchhiker‚Äôs Guide is just not for me. Perhaps it‚Äôs all the hype, because without that I would have read it as a quiet, interesting sci-fi book and then completely forgot all about it. But Hitchhiker‚Äôs is impossible to forget about. Somehow, incredibly, it has become a cultural phenomenon even for people who have in fact seen a hundred and one better versions of the book come out in popular media since then.\n\nBut sometimes the first version of something is imperfect because it‚Äôs precisely that ‚Äì the first version. It‚Äôs okay that there are better, more interesting versions of the same thing out there, and it‚Äôs okay to enjoy those more than you did the proto version. A number of authors whose work I genuinely enjoy have no doubt been influenced by Hitchhiker‚Äôs, and its cultural significance cannot be denied.\n\nSo let that suffice for the legacy of the book, so that I can pronounce it boring despite everything and move on in peace. üòõ"
