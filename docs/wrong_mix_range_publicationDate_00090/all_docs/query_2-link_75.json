        "text": "(Discworld series, The Wee Free Men, Only You Can Save Mankind, Good Omens)\n\nPratchett is a fantasy and humor writer best known for his series set in a world very much like Earth, called the Discworld. The characters are quirky and dimensional, the dialogue is witty and hilarious, and jokes, references, and allusions abound in Pratchett’s books. He also uses the Discworld and its traditions to comment on our world, whether it’s about philosophy and spirituality (the Death subseries), the police force/military and the social order (the City Watch) or feminism, literature, and storytelling (the Witches). Humor is the key element of Pratchett’s books, along with his cinematic pacing and well-developed characters.\n\nIf you like Terry Pratchett, try:\n\nKurt Vonnegut (if you like satirical sci-fi and fantasy with lots of genre-blending and plenty of poignancy, try Breakfast of Champions or the short story collections Welcome to the Monkey House and Bagombo Snuff-Box)\n\nJohn Connolly (readers who especially like the stories with the Wee Free Men or Granny Weatherwax might enjoy The Book of Lost Things, and Good Omens fans might like The Gates)\n\nChristopher Moore (if you enjoy lots of humor and allusion, and/or are a fan of the Death books, you might try A Dirty Job)\n\nJames Morrow (fans of Pratchett’s social commentary and exploration of spirituality as well as his intelligent humor might enjoy The Last Witchfinder or Towing Jehovah)\n\nNeil Gaiman (if you enjoy the wonderful fantasy and characters in Pratchett’s books, you might like American Gods or Good Omens, which the two co-authored)\n\nDouglas Adams (readers who enjoy Pratchett’s brand of humor and his use of social satire might like The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy)\n\nJasper Fforde (if you like literary allusion, quirky characters, and plenty of social commentary set in a world very similar to our own, you might try the Thursday Next series. Start with The Eyre Affair)"
