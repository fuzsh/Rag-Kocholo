        "text": "Douglas Adams is pure genius\n\nI read this book a few years ago and was left with the feeling that Douglas Adams was a pure genius - the Monty Python and Andy Kaufman of literature. In other words, he has a very peculiar sense of humor, but if you find it funny you will be laughing to hard that people will be staring at you on the subways. Now, I listened to a version of the book prior to the release of the 2005 movie, so I don't know if this new version of the book by random house audio is the same or if it has been modified for the movie. Frankly the movie stank with comparison to the original book so hopefully this is the original book just re-narrated or re-released.\n\nI read this some twenty years ago\n\nI was stuck in the vast emptyness of Yuma Arizona, a one gas station, Mcdonalds, Del Taco kind of place. Stationed there as 19 y/o US Marine I found the whole experience there miserable at best. Then on the second day a lovely young girl gave me this book to read, she said it was funny and filled up the boredom that enveloped Yuma. I took it and read it and loved it. True I do have a warped sense of humor, or at least those who know me would claim. Which may explain my passion for all of Douglas Adams books. Nonetheless, I am looking forward to listening to this book, and after that I'm off to see the movie, well maybe not the movie. I'll wait for the DVD, $8 for popcorn is bit too pricey for me.\n\nJust the right voice for this story\n\nI've long been a fan of this series by Douglas Adams and purchased this audiobook to share it with my children on a long road trip. Well, now we've got two more fans. Stephen Fry is a pleasure to listen to . . .I'd probably listen to his grocery list. But, given the excellent deadpan humor of this novel, he gave a genius reading.\n\nI can't love this book enough!\n\nThis book is still funny even after almost 40 years it's a classic and I highly recommend it. Stephen Fry voice acting is amazing\n\nPure Douglas Adams insanity\n\nThis is the first part of the famous Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy trilogy (plus a couple extra volumes). It is a perfect example of the insane and illogical universe created by the author. This is admirably narrated by Stephen Fry, who's delivery perfectly fits the subversive style of the story.\n\nIf you enjoy things like Monty Python or Red Dwarf, this is absolutely for you. If you prefer the universe to make perfect logical sense, this might be a bit more challenging... but you should still give it a try.\n\nNot impressed by this book...\n\nI know it's supposed to be a classic, but I had a hard time wading through the frivolous make-believe. I know it's sci-fi, I know it's fiction, but the overly done up foundation of characters and plants and systems and OMG! was distracting to me. The plot all by itself was thin, and lacked substance IMO.\n\nBut that's just my opinion.\n\nAmazing and entertaining!\n\nThis is by far one of the most important cornerstones to Science Fiction there is. And Stephen Fry reading it to me was the best way to experience it.\n\nStephen Fry is wonderful!\n\nAlthough I have read this book before myself. I thoroughly enjoyed Stephen Fry’s reading of this audiobook. His voice is soothing and he tells the story with gusto. It was an excellent choice for my first audiobook."
