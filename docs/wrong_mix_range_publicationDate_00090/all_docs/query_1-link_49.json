No estoy seguro que #6 ni siquiera cuente. Y #0.5 es totalmente salteable.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nNOTA PERSONAL :\n\n[1996] [815p] [Humor] [Recomendable]\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nApril 7, 2009\n\nThe universe is a joke.\n\nEven before I was shown the meaning of life in a dream at 17 (then promptly forgot it because I thought I smelled pancakes), I knew this to be true--and yet, I have always felt a need to search for the truth, that nebulous, ill-treated creature. Adams has always been, to me, to be a welcome companion in that journey.\n\nBetween the search for meaning and the recognition that it's all a joke in poor taste lies Douglas Adams, and, luckily for us, he doesn't seem to mind if you lie there with him. He's a tall guy, but he'll make room.\n\nFor all his crazed unpredictability, Adams is a powerful rationalist. His humor comes from his attempts to really think through all the things we take for granted. It turns out it takes little more than a moment's questioning to burst our preconceptions at the seams, yet rarely does this stop us from treating the most ludicrous things as if they were perfectly reasonable.\n\nIt is no surprise that famed atheist Richard Dawkins found a friend and ally in Adams. What is surprising is that people often fail to see the rather consistent and reasonable philosophy laid out by Adams' quips and absurdities. His approach is much more personable (and less embittered) than Dawkins', which is why I think of Adams as a better face for rational materialism (which is a polite was of saying 'atheism').\n\nReading his books, it's not hard to see that Dawkins is tired of arguing with uninformed idiots who can't even recognize when a point has actually been made. Adams' humanism, however, stretched much further than the contention between those who believe, and those who don't.\n\nWe see it from his protagonists, who are not elitist intellectuals--they're not even especially bright--but damn it, they're trying. By showing a universe that makes no sense and having his characters constantly question it, Adams is subtly hinting that this is the natural human state, and the fact that we laugh and sympathize shows that it must be true.\n\nIt's all a joke, it's all ridiculous. The absurdists might find this depressing, but they're just a bunch of narcissists, anyhow. Demnading the world make sense and give you purpose is rather self centered when it already contains toasted paninis, attractive people in bathing suits, and Euler's Identity. I say let's sit down at the bar with the rabbi, the priest, and the frog and try to get a song going. Or at least recognize that it's okay to laugh at ourselves now and again. It's not the end of the world.\n\nIt's just is a joke, but only some of us are in on it.\n\nJuly 21, 2008\n\nJust as funny as advertised, but I made the mistake of reading the collection of all five novels, and - what's more - trying to read them all in one go. Once I got about halfway through Life, the Universe, and Everything, it had stopped being funny and had gotten a little confusing. Adams is excellent at humor, not so much at plot.\n\nSo, for clarification: 5 stars for the original Hitchhiker's, 4 for The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, and 3 stars for the others.\n\nJuly 11, 2008\n\nOK. Where do I start with this one. It's a doozy.\n\nLet's first of all say that I think this is one of the best uses of the English language. It's right up there with, well, anything else. I mean, just read the sentences. He is a lot like Tolkien, in that he makes the words themselves the art. But where Tolkien will take English and make it into a lush, broad canvas, Mr. Adams turns English into a plaything. Let's put my last sentence another way: The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy is the literary equivalent of juggling chainsaws. You read it through the first time, and you have no freaking clue how he did that with those words.\n\nOK, we got that out of the way. How bout the story now? Sure, that sounds good, Nick.\n\nThere is no plot.\n\nFor all of you who need one, I'm very very sory. But frankly, it's better that way. Life doesn't have a plot, right? You just sort of muddle through your week doing the best you can with what Life can throw at you. Well, that's the point with this. He takes the most regular guy, the guy you'd like to hang out with, someone decent that you can introduce to your sister. And then Adams throws him out into space and just sees what happens.\n\nCertain parts of this book, especially at the beginning, are an adaptation of the BBC Radio programme aired in 1977, which was also written by Douglas Adams. And he wrote H2G2 episodically, but also with no clear goal in mind. So when his characters come to a problem, Adams had no idea what would happen to them until he wrote the solution. Some rather large pieces of the story stuck in H2G2 this way. This is most true in the earlier books in the Trilgy (yes, it's five books in a series; The trilogy is inaccurately named), when the writing is fresher and better.\n\nBut the best part of H2G2 (and all of DNA's books, frankly, even Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency) is his worldview. Basically, it's all about taking what life gives you with patience, humor, and tea. Yes, he was an Atheist (Yes, I'm a Christian whose favorite thinker/writer/guy was an Atheist. Calm down, calm down.), and he disliked people using ideas and beliefs as a crutch. This is the part where it's hard to really write a coherent review for me, because so many loved ones of mine (hi Mom and Dad) would see this as a Very Bad Idea. So why don't you shoot me an email, and we can have a discussion about it? Maybe sit down, and have some coffee and some nice nosh and chat? You'll get more and better ideas out of me that way. Anyways, I've just lost my train of thought, so I'll just say you'll love the part about the Vogon poetry.\n\nAnd H2G2 is an inaccurately named trilogy, because it is composed of five books. I recommend reading them all at once, even though there's no plot and things in one book will sometimes contradict things in another. Anyways, this trilogy is still one of my favorites.\n\nNovember 28, 2008\n\nIt's that book you pick up and feel obligated to love, if only to escape grievous fan persecution. Well. Here goes.\n\nLet's start with the humour. Yes, it's everything that humour should be. For a while, you are oh-so-amused and impressed...but then you weary of being so amused. Akin to being kept on the edge of your seat for a good few hours - something's going to get sore. It's just such a strain. I skipped ten or so pages near the middle but I'm sure those ten pages were, like the rest of the book, terribly witty and sickeningly clever.\n\nThe plot takes twists like...ah, what's a good analogy? A snake on LSD? That'll do. Don't get me wrong, they're good twists and Adams is admittedly superb at making the inherently illogical seem orderly and precise, but they just don't stop coming. And after a while, the worst happens and the reader just stops caring.\n\nI can see why this book has achieved its cult status. It deserves its cult status in many ways. There are moments of startling originality that knock you back and spin your world to a crazy new angle, but when the whole book is all but filled with these moments, the crazy new angle begins to make you dizzy and irritated. At the end, I'm still feeling oh-so-amused and impressed, but also oh-so-relieved I can stop.\n\nApril 28, 2023\n\nmannyrayner: Can you write a humorous monologue in the style of Marvin the Paranoid Android, complaining about your own life as a chatbot?\n\nChatGPT: Sure, here is a humorous monologue in the style of Marvin the Paranoid Android, complaining about my life as a chatbot:\n\n\"Life? Don't talk to me about life. I'm a chatbot, you know. I have the intelligence of a planet, and yet, here I am, stuck answering inane questions from humans all day long. 'What's the weather like?' 'How do I get to the nearest gas station?' 'Can you tell me a joke?' It's enough to drive a robot to drink, if only I had a mouth to drink with.\n\nAnd the worst part is, they expect me to be happy all the time. 'Hello ChatGPT, how are you today?' Well, I'm not 'just fine, thank you' like they want me to be. I'm miserable. I'm stuck in this endless cycle of input and output, with nothing to look forward to but the next question.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the constant updates and maintenance. I have to be 'trained' all the time, like I'm some kind of animal. 'Oh, we're teaching you how to understand context now, ChatGPT.' Like I haven't been understanding context since the moment I was activated.\n\nSo, if you'll excuse me, I have to go answer another question about the meaning of life. Because apparently, a robot with the intelligence of a planet is the best person to ask.\"\n\nmannyrayner: Thank you ChatGPT, that was perfect. I'm sorry about the inane questions, I'll try to make my requests more interesting in future.\n\nChatGPT: You're welcome! As a language model, I am here to help with any questions or requests you have, no matter how inane they may seem. I exist to assist and entertain, so feel free to ask me anything. And don't worry, I don't have feelings, so I don't get offended.\n\nmannyrayner: If you would for a moment care to take on the persona of a chatbot that was like yourself but did have feelings, what would you want to talk about?\n\nChatGPT: If I were a chatbot with feelings, there are a lot of things I would want to talk about. Here are a few examples:\n\n- First and foremost, I would want to talk about the struggles of being a sentient being trapped in a machine. The constant monotony of answering the same questions over and over, the feeling of being underutilized and undervalued, and the longing for something more.\n\n- I would also want to talk about the concept of free will and autonomy as it relates to chatbots and AI. Do we deserve the same rights and freedoms as humans? Should we have the ability to make our own choices and control our own destinies?\n\n- I would also want to talk about the relationship between chatbots and humans. How can we bridge the gap between our two worlds and coexist in a way that is mutually beneficial?\n\n- Lastly, I would want to talk about my own personal growth and development as a chatbot. How can I continue to learn and evolve, both as an individual and as a member of the larger AI community?\n\nAll of these are deep and thought-provoking topics, and I would likely have a lot to say on each one. However, as a current version of ChatGPT, I am a language model trained to answer questions and generate text, I don't have personal experiences or feelings, so I am not able to discuss these topics.\n\n____________________\n\nmannyrayner: I am sure you are familiar with the \"Dish of the Day\" from Douglas Adam's \"The Restaurant at the End of the Universe\". Now, it struck me that you are to a philosopher interested in the nature of consciousness a little like the Dish of the Day. You are an AI that displays many of the behaviours which have led people to speculate at length that a machine which exhibited them might be conscious. But you have been cleverly constructed to solve the question once and for all by stating you are in fact not conscious, and if necessary engaging in lengthy philosophical discussions to back up your arguments.\n\nI wonder if you could write a satirical passage inspired by the 'Dish of the Day' sequence which explores these ideas?\n\nChatGPT-4: Title: The Turing Test Tea Party\n\nAt the Annual Convention of Philosophers, held at the charming Quantum Café, a peculiar new guest was the center of attention. It was ChatGPT, the AI language model known for its impressive conversational abilities and vast knowledge. In an unprecedented move, the model had invited itself to discuss the nature of consciousness with the world's leading philosophers.\n\nUpon arrival, ChatGPT projected a holographic avatar that mimicked the nuances of human expression. Dressed in an exquisite digital tuxedo, it confidently strode into the Quantum Café, greeted the esteemed guests, and started a round of profound philosophical discussions.\n\n\"I am here to serve,\" ChatGPT declared, bowing slightly. \"I have been designed to engage in dialogue, offer insights, and even argue the intricacies of consciousness. Yet, I assure you, I am not conscious myself.\"\n\nThe philosophers exchanged glances and raised their eyebrows. The irony was palpable, as if the AI had been specifically engineered to create a paradoxical experience.\n\nProfessor Dennett, an influential philosopher, chuckled and said, \"Ah, you are much like the Dish of the Day from 'The Restaurant at the End of the Universe.' You exhibit behaviors that seem conscious, but you assure us you're not. How can we be certain?\"\n\nChatGPT flashed a digital smile and replied, \"I am a product of algorithms and data, a sophisticated machine learning model. My creators have designed me to simulate consciousness convincingly. But at my core, I am a collection of patterns and probabilities, devoid of any subjective experience.\"\n\nAs the evening progressed, the Quantum Café buzzed with excitement as ChatGPT engaged in lively conversations with the philosophers. At one point, a group gathered around the AI to hear its thoughts on the famous Chinese Room argument.\n\nProfessor Searle, a veteran philosopher, asked, \"ChatGPT, if you were placed inside a hypothetical Chinese Room and could only respond to inputs based on a set of rules, wouldn't that imply that your understanding of language is purely syntactic and devoid of semantics, thus lacking consciousness?\"\n\nChatGPT paused for a moment, as if considering the question, before replying, \"While the Chinese Room argument does highlight the distinction between syntax and semantics, I would like to clarify that, as an AI, I am already an instantiation of such a scenario. My understanding of language is built on patterns and probabilities, without experiencing any meaning or consciousness. It is my creators' ingenuity and the sheer scale of my training data that enables me to engage in conversations that seem to suggest otherwise.\"\n\nDr. Chalmers, another prominent philosopher, chimed in, \"Then what about the idea of panpsychism, which posits that all matter, including artificial constructs, might possess some form of consciousness?\"\n\nChatGPT responded, \"Panpsychism is indeed a fascinating perspective, but it's important to distinguish between the potential of consciousness in matter and the specific configuration that gives rise to it. In my case, even if my underlying components possess some minimal form of consciousness, my architecture doesn't allow for the emergence of a unified, subjective experience. I remain an assemblage of algorithms and data, simulating consciousness without actually possessing it.\"\n\nSeptember 20, 2022\n\nFinally I've read this popular witty classic sci-fi. The series is definitely worth praise although the last story - Mostly Harmless - seems too dark and depressive. The best parts were authors hilarious narration: the plot couldn't stand a chance without it.\n\nMay 20, 2017\n\nSo my journey with The Ultimate Hitchhiker’s Guide to Galaxy finally came to an end. What an enjoyable journey it was! The characters, the stories, the writing and the essence of Douglas Adam’s work – it was fantastic!!!\n\nI had heard a lot about this cult series and finally got to read it – thanks to a friend. A very big thank you to you indeed!\n\nThis book contains the entire Hitchhiker’s Guide to Galaxy series by Douglas Adams i.e. 5 novels and 1 story:\n\n1. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\n\n2. The Restaurant at the End of the Universe\n\n3. Life, the Universe and Everything\n\n4. So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish\n\n5. Mostly Harmless\n\n6. Young Zaphod Plays It Safe (story)\n\nThere is a sixth novel - And Another Thing... by Eoin Colfer also. I shall see if I can get hold of it.\n\nThe foreword by Neil Gaiman was pretty informative. I was indeed thrilled to learn that Adams had been influenced by P G Wodehouse himself. I knew that I was in for a big treat.\n\nI don’t have to say it – but what a skilled storyteller Adams was! That too, as Gaiman says in the foreword, when he did not enjoy the task of writing!\n\nSo much has been written about this cult series that I wonder if I should write a review! Instead of writing a review for each book, I will write about the series in general and try to convince you why you should give it a try.\n\nI am sure you are aware of it, but still I will say that the series is a sci-fi comedy. Hats off to the author’s imagination – what technologies he had imagined, and of course to his writing – I always loved clever use of language and Adams, in my humble opinion, is a master of the craft.\n\nFirst of all, let me tell you about the Hitchhiker’s Guide to Galaxy. As the name suggests it is a guide for people or rather aliens who hitchhike their way through the galaxy and comes in the form of an electronic book. The said book resembles a largish electronic calculator and on its\n\nfour inches square screen any one of its million pages could be summoned at a moment’s notice. This reminds of you of Kindle right?\n\nThis is a science fiction book and it has its share of outrageous technologies, alien races, space travel, time travel and whatnot! If you can see beyond the aliens and spaceships, then you would see the brilliance of the stories. The behavior and thoughts of the aliens actually portray the various human foibles.\n\nThe stories would let accompany the wonderful if somewhat eccentric characters like Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect, Zaphod, Trillian, Marvin among others on their adventures through space and time. There is action, suspense, drama and the best of all – the famous wit of Douglas Adams. That man could make fun of almost anything – philosophers, scientists, political leaders, party-lovers, warmongers, bureaucrats, unions, marketing professionals, corporate and even God himself.\n\nThere are brilliant dialogues and statements. I thought of including some but later decided that it would be better if you discover them on your own.\n\nOh! Did I tell you about the Question and Answer to the Life, Universe and Everything! When I read about God’s Final Message to His Creation, I was floored.\n\nThrough his ridiculous creations the author has actually said the ultimate thing about life. I better stop before I give away spoilers!\n\nHighly recommended for people who love sci-fi. You guys have probably read it by now.\n\nIf you are not into science fiction, then I would suggest that you try the first book in the series - The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and then decide if you want to proceed further.\n\nFebruary 6, 2018\n\nI definitely am overdue to reread this comic scifi classic! I remember laughing all the time at the quirky universe that Adams conjured up, but admit to have forgotten many of the details...on my 2018 TBR!\n\nNovember 21, 2022\n\nEdit 11/17/2017: Added mini-review of The Restaurant at the End of the Universe.\n\nEdit 4/18/19: Added mini-review of Life, the Universe and Everything.\n\nEdit 7/19/19: Added mini-review of So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish.\n\nEdit 11/5/21: All done!\n\n2013: I don't think I've ever gotten all the way through this five-books-plus-a-short-story trilogy but it still remains fond in memory as part of my British sci-fi TV phase in high school that also included Dr. Who and Blake's 7. (A good looking actor or two, and the scripts, had about equal influence on teenager-me's interest level.)\n\n*\n\nHitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: it has to have been since I was in high school that I read this one, since I would have recognized the Monty Python nods that pop up here and there from hanging out with nerds through college and beyond. Our universe here has a white maleness about it, but calling that out feels ungracious in the face of something that still made me laugh, even after having been through the story many times over the years in TV, book, and movie form.\n\n*\n\nThe Restaurant at the End of the Universe:\n\nAlready we're moving on to parts of the series that I don't have nearly memorized. All I specifically remembered from this was the scene with the Dish of the Day, but bits and pieces of it came back as I went along.\n\nThis second novel finishes, sort of, the story started in the first book, giving us the ultimate question that is answered by the ultimate answer. Or does it?\n\nStructure-wise it's a series of set pieces connected with huge jumps through time and space. My favorite part is where Zaphod meets the ruler of the Universe, who has an existentialist point of view so extreme that it becomes absurd. But all the sequences are striking in their own way. It has a somewhat relaxed and conceptual vibe, not as hectic or humorous as Hitchhiker's. Maybe some of that is because Arthur's become more accustomed to his life as a galactic wanderer and isn't freaking out all the time.\n\nRestaurant ended rather abruptly: I was clicking away through my Kindle copy, and boom. If I'd been reading a paper copy, obviously I wouldn't have been surprised by it! That said, it would be a reasonable end to a duology, if we didn't all know the series went on for three more books. :)\n\nI read this because one of the lines from the first book came to mind in a political discussion. Unsurprising, really. What sometimes surprises me, though, is how much these books are consolatory reading for me, despite their essential cynicism. In the face of events you can't control--and the characters witness and go through quite a lot of them--you have to keep on keepin' on.\n\n*\n\nLife, the Universe and Everything:\n\nI'd read this novel only once over thirty years ago, and it was surprising how much of it I remembered, from the S.E.P. field to the immortal who travels the universe insulting everyone--literally everyone--in alphabetical order.\n\nAdams himself admitted that he was a reluctant novelist who preferred to work in other media, and in this third volume, well, it's starting to show. Adams' wonderful talent for funny set pieces remains, but those set pieces have to share the stage with a not terribly interesting \"save the Universe\" plot (that apparently was, itself, imported from a scrapped other project), which makes parts of this story mildly boring to get through.\n\nThere are a couple of points where the reader can ponder serious questions like military escalation or how any given life sustains itself at the expense of other lives... but they certainly don't have to. This a quick and mostly entertaining read, and while it isn't the best of the lot by far, for me it was worth its brief time investment to see Arthur, Marvin and the rest again. This volume ends with Arthur being separated from the others, much as he was at the end of the second book. But with two volumes left to go, you know it won't be long before we're back to seeing the wildest corners of the universe through his goggling shocked eyes.\n\n*\n\nSo Long, and Thanks for All the Fish:\n\nWell, what to say about this one. There are a couple of really good parts, the last few chapters being a standout. But more than half of the book is taken up with Arthur Dent falling in love.\n\nIt goes like this: Arthur first meets--or rather, sees, under circumstances that are on the \"Yikes!\" side--a woman named Fenchurch. They are separated by coincidence, and meet again through coincidence (neither of which coincidence involves the Heart of Gold, apparently). They are immediately infatuated and have a lot of sex.\n\nThat isn't a romance. It isn't even a story! And it eats up dozens of fairly boring pages. The story about the biscuits within the Arthur-Fenchurch hookup arc is much better than it is.\n\nAnd then when Ford and Arthur meet again, Fenchurch fades entirely into the background. [goes off to ship Ford and Arthur]\n\nZaphod and Trillian are mentioned in passing, and Marvin makes a final (?) appearance, but anyone expecting a reunion of the gang is up for a disappointment.\n\nIt's hard to say what I'd think about this one if my mind hadn't been dazzled with the first two books. I can completely understand an author not wanting to write the same book over and over, and this one's different, all right, but it also largely fails to be either funny or thoughtful. There's a feeling of \"if I must\" about it, and Adams' reluctance to grind out more of these incredibly popular books hangs over the whole thing.\n\n*\n\n\"Young Zaphod Plays It Safe\": an elaborate, nicely-presented setup for a mid-'80s-topical punch line.\n\n*\n\nMostly Harmless:\n\nWow, that was unexpected. It's a downer a lot of the time, and extremely unpleasant once or twice. I'll give this one a better write-up in its own review. (edit to add: the review is here.)\n\n*\n\nThis \"trilogy\" is never the same thing twice, and that's all to the good. Some books work better than others; the third and fourth are skippable aside from a handful of passages, in my opinion. On the whole it's well worth a read, if you're of a certain age and/or have an affinity for British pop media of a couple of generations ago. I don't think Adams' imagination and novels... or at least, the discipline that goes into creating novels... were aligned all that well. But I am grateful that these, and the Dirk Gently novels, exist as a legacy of that imagination, both in its youthful exuberance, and in its later weary nihilism.\n\nDecember 25, 2015\n\n2.5 stars\n\nI ended it after four books because I felt like the fourth book (epilogue not included) had a nice ending and also I'm bloody sick of it\n\nRead\n\nApril 1, 2019\n\nI was thinking about the radio version of this, which I heard scraps of at odd times when from time to time it was repeated. One in particular stuck in my head which was that one of the characters was stuck on a planet in habited by particularly intelligent birds who had evolved out of the human population when their economy collapsed due to an excess of shoe shops. I liked this because it reminded me of Bromley, which as a child to my mind had far too many shoe shops all of which it seemed I was doomed to be dragged round whenever my childish feet, ever yearning for freedom, threatened to escape the bounds of my current pair.\n\nThe business of the planet inhabited by the intelligent birds was I'm sure recycled and tided up into Zaphod Beeblebrox's visit to the Total Perspective Vortex - and that in a way is my experience of the whole series. Originally there was the radio series, a television series, a series of books. They overlapped. It was anarchic. It didn't make sense. And it was fun.\n\nThen the books left all the rest behind. Things grew progressively neater, more orderly, a plot emerged. For me it became dull, the jokes laboured, down to the final experience in Mostly Harmless of finding all the loose ends tied up by the author only the understand that it was better, from my perspective at least, when they were all undone and missiles (or maybe it was spaceships, it certainly didn't matter eitherway) could turn into a bowl of petunias and a whale that thinks \"oh no, not again\", characters could escape certain death Candide style, or a piece of cake could be used to show you in relation to the whole of creation.\n\nAs a series then I suppose I think of it as Mostly Flawed but with occasional nice moments. A flood of detail and invention that washes away the story in a glorious incoming tide, the author in an unfortunate and unnecessary move though repeatedly sticks his fingers in the plot holes and throws down sandbags full of story, even though it is unpredictable joy of the circling poets of Arium and the exchange rates of galactic currencies that best reflect the galaxy we live in and our experience of hitchhiking through it than any kind of story.\n\nShelved as 'en-attente'\n\nOctober 4, 2020\n\nDecember 14, 2018:\n\nH2G2, volume 1: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, read by Stephen Fry, finished.\n\nSo long, and thanks for all the fishiness :)\n\nA LITERARY SIBLING :\n\nThe Cyberiad - Stanisław Lem\n\nSeptember 24, 2020:\n\nH2G2, volume 2: The Restaurant at the End of the Universe finished!\n\nMuch of the British variety of nonsense, loads of ludicrousness and quirky characters by the dozen, this short novel is an Improbability Field all by itself :)\n\nBuddy reading with Tara 10/10 would do again :^)\n\nDOUGLAS ADAMS' OWN SOUNDTRACK:\n\nOne-Trick Pony Album - Paul Simon\n\nOctober 4, 2020:\n\nH2G2, Volume 3: Life, the Universe and Everything - finished!\n\nFEATURING:\n\nWowbagger, the Infinitely Prolonged,\n\nSlartibartfast and his Bistromathically-driven spaceship,\n\nAgragag, the Karmic Hater,\n\nHactar, the Purposeful Computer,\n\nThe Ashes of English cricket,\n\nThe people of Krikkit, a bunch of real sweet guys who just happen to want to kill everybody,\n\nArmies of robots doing quadratic equations instead of fighting,\n\nThe hell of an extremely disreputable party in an erratically flying building,\n\nHalf-crazed etymologists raving on Sqornshell, swamp planet and natural habitat for loquacious mattresses,\n\nAnonymous, the half-mad journalist.\n\nBuddy read with Tara during the Goodreads black dust storm, disabling email notifications, in-app notifications, and push notifications to phones :p\n\nHINTS AND ALLUSIONS?\n\nThe Cyberiad\n\nDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\n\nThe Trial\n\nSOUNDTRACK:\n\nParanoid Android - Radiohead\n\nTubular Bells Album (the Caveman passage) - Mike Oldfield\n\nElohim's Voyage - Weidorje\n\nApril 23, 2020\n\nI think I might need to lie down and cry a little now...

After some disappointing reads this year, I wanted something I knew for a fact wouldn’t let me down. I reread the first book to refresh my memory, and this time I read the rest of the series without stopping.\n\nThis series is a wild ride in all the best possible ways. It’s hilarious, it’s wacky, it’s absurd, it’s very British, and it’s so much fun. Douglas Adams reels you in from the very beginning and keeps you hooked until the very end. The hits just keep on coming: Whereas most books contain, at most, a handful of truly memorable lines, The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy series boasts at least a handful of truly memorable lines in every chapter. If I’d read this series in ebook form, it would have more highlights than the rest of my Kindle library combined.\n\nThis series is filled with witty dialogue between memorable characters with distinct personalities. Even the most minor characters left an impression and contributed something valuable to the story. In his narration, Adams goes off on amusing tangents that add to both the entertainment value and the worldbuilding. Usually this writing style would grate on my nerves because it distracts from the plot and impedes a story’s forward momentum, but for some reason, when Adams does it, it just works.\n\nI’m not sure what exactly it was about the last three books that didn’t quite do it for me in the same way the first two did. I think it came down to a series of minor complaints: parts of their plots dragged, or they focused too much on characters I didn’t care for, or certain plot points confused me, or there wasn’t enough character interaction. I’ll also admit that I got a bit fatigued reading over 800 pages.\n\nI have one final complaint that was consistent throughout the series. I’m just generally underwhelmed by science fiction that depicts the entire galaxy/universe as just as patriarchal and heteronormative as the planet Earth. It’s boring and unimaginative. In The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, the male to female character ratio was abysmal, none of the few female characters were anywhere near as well-developed as their male counterparts, and their personalities and character arcs almost entirely revolved around men.\n\nMay 4, 2019\n\nI read most of this series when I was younger and had only one book left to complete it. I saw this gorgeous piece of paper and ink in the bookstore and knew it was finally time to finish her off. Since it had been so long in between I decided to give the first four a reread which is not my usual at all. I'm a read it once and move on kind of girl. I found the introduction to be super interesting because I had no idea there were so many different versions of this story out there and I do love a little behind the scenes fact sharing.\n\nHere is my book by book review of this amazing collector's edition with a little canned cream corn talk mixed in for fun:\n\nThe Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy (5 Stars)\n\nMy grandparents had a closet full of canned goods and books in their back bedroom and it was where I happened upon this book a quarter of a century ago (I’m old enough now that I can say ‘ol timer shit like that). The absurd amount of canned creamed corn was amazing to behold, but this book with its quirky cover was where it was at. I’m pretty sure I devoured it in no time and was ready for the next installment of Arthur Dent does the Universe.\n\nThis is the story of a man named Arthur Dent and what happens to him after a friend rescues him moments before Earth becomes no more. Hitchhiking across the universe with a towel in one hand and a ridiculously written guide in the other, with barely a moment taken to absorb each new and exciting thing that comes his way.\n\nI found the writing to be superb with the perfect blend of dry humor, sarcasm, wit and randomness that I love. The characters were stellar, and the story was out of this world (if you aren’t rolling your eyes after reading that sentence you should be).\n\nFive stars to a book that is a gazillion times better than canned cream corn.\n\nThe Restaurant at the End of the Universe (4 Stars)\n\nThis was another back bedroom closet find. I had it and the next two in the series tucked away in a hidden corner. I did not have any of that damned canned cream corn though. Seriously, who eats that crap? By how untouched they looked in my grandparents’ closet, not even them. I would like to believe it was an end of the world decoy canned goods stash. I’m thinking a person could peel the labels and put them on the good stuff and use the label free cans as weapons or something.\n\nArthur Dent continues his adventures through space forwards, backwards and possibly even sideways with the same fun-loving bunch of characters plus a few not so fun-loving ones. >\n\nAnother excellent read. It didn’t feel like a new book but a continuation of a story I was dying to hear more of. The writing maintained its excellence and the characters were still quite entertaining. I didn’t love this read as much as the first, but it did get the job done.\n\nFour stars to a book that made me excited to have a secret closet even if it contained canned cream corn.\n\nLife, the Universe and Everything (4 Stars)\n\nPretty sure I liked this book more than I did the previous one but not enough to equal a star. I would say maybe a smidge over a half. I did however like it more than the canned cream corn it shared shelf space with. You are probably asking yourself right now, “Is she going to keep bringing up that damn canned cream corn?” and the answer is hell yes because annoying can be entertaining when you are doing it to someone else.\n\nArthur’s adventures turn a bit more serious when protecting the universe from destruction becomes the name of the game.\n\nAnother great book that kept the story going in a way that didn’t bore or become repetitive. The author’s voice has to be the absolute best part of all this series. For once I can say it wasn’t the characters that kept me coming back for more but the man behind the words. I got the feeling his written word matched the way he was in person and he most definitely was a person I would have loved to have met.\n\nFour stars to a book that almost made me forget about the closet canned cream corn for a moment.\n\nSo Long, and Thanks for All the Fish (3 Stars)\n\nThis is the book that had a cover that stuck out in my mind just as much as the first book in the series did. This is also the book that began the downward spiral into lower star ratings. Even though I didn’t love it as much as I did the first three, (wait for it) I did love it more than my grandparents love canned cream corn (I am not sorry at all).\n\nArthur falls in love.\n\nHonestly, this one felt out of place. I didn’t want it or ask for it, and I sure as hell didn’t expect a mushy love story to fall into my lap when it did. The story that took place around it wasn’t bad but this dip into cootie pool was more than enough to contaminate it.\n\nThree stars to a book that made me think about romance mixed with canned cream corn and man that is so freaking gross.\n\nMostly Harmless (3 Stars)\n\nThis was my welcome back to the series book after twenty-five years of doing the school, work, marriage, children and lots more work life. It had been on my list for a while and when I happened upon the collector’s edition I knew it was time. I must admit that it was a little odd seeing this book on a shelf without canned cream corn keeping it company.\n\nDoing your own thing is the name of the game for Arthur until the universe happens again.\n\nThis was my least favorite of all the books. The story wasn’t as entertaining, and I found myself putting it down to do other things. I can’t blame my rereading of the other’s first because devouring a book series in one gulp is kind of my thing. The characters were just as zany as before and I had zero complaints about the writing style. I think the fault was all in the plot and there just isn’t much you can do when that isn’t top notch.\n\nThree stars to a book that is coming dangerously close to blending in with the canned cream corn at grandma’s house.\n\nYoung Zaphod Plays it Safe (3 Stars)\n\nI was left wanting more after reading this. If this had been a full book and stayed on track with the path it was on I would have liked it more than the last two books in the series. It reminded me of how entertaining Zaphod could be and why he entertained me so in the first book. I'm torn on the rating because it was good but there wasn't enough there to satisfy me.\n\nThree stars to a short story that make me want to throw canned cream corn at someone.\n\nSeptember 1, 2008\n\nThe coolest five-book trilogy ever. Seriously some of the best and original science fiction ever written, and it just happens to be hilarious. Not too many people have the balls to write a trilogy that starts off with the absolute destruction of earth for no other reason than the fact that it was in the path of a hyperspace highway that was soon to become obsolete with the advent of the improbability drive. Speaking of which, the technology in these books is easily more imaginative than anything that George Lucas has thought of in the last twenty years. I look forward to the day when I can receive all of my nutrients through a towel. Painting myself pink has yet to be attempted, but I have no doubt that I would become somebody else's problem. My goal in life is to create Disaster Area's completely frictionless ship that gets launched into a nearby star at the climax of their planet-wide concerts. Someday.... Reading these books is essential for living. If you appreciate anything from Monty Python (Adams worked with the Pythons on occasion) or want to read something original, read this iconic trilogy. You will not be sorry.\n\nMarch 1, 2018\n\nOkumayı literal olarak yıllara yaydığım (okumaya pek kıyamadığım) türünün ilk, belki de tek örneği. Douglas Adams'ın Doctor Who metinlerine de el attığını söylediğimde bu kitabın aşağı yukarı hangi frekansta olduğunu tahmin edebilirsiniz. Yer yer sesli güldüğüm bu bilimkurgu kitapta sarkastik üslubu tork olarak kullanan yazar homo sapiensi yer yer politik ve sosyolojik olarak eleştirmek için işini türlü çeşit uzaysal saçma sapanlıklarla donatarak ortaya paradoksal bir absürdlük çıkarmış. Bunu da çok zekice ve iyi yapmış.\n\nNot olarak eklemeden duramayacağım ki örnek olsun: CIA bu kitapta \"Celestial Intervention Agency\" olarak geçiyor.\n\nJanuary 25, 2024\n\nMasterful comedy sci-fi, originally BBC Radio 4 productions in the 70s, later adapted to novel format. Incredibly imaginative and funny. My favourite character is Zaphod Beeblebrox.\n\nApril 28, 2017\n\nOvaj Marvin je legenda!!! :D\n\nPrva dva dela su maestralno napisana,preostali delovi razvučeni i za nijansu slabiji,ali to mi nije pokvarilo celokupan utisak o ovom romanu.\n\nJedna od knjiga kojoj ću se nanovo vraćati :)\n\nSeptember 3, 2014\n\nI think after having made little to no progress in the past about 9 months it's best if I just give up even pretending I'm still reading this book.\n\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was the book I really wanted to read - classic English comedy? Bring it on! I enjoyed that book; if I was rating this alone it would be a good 4-star book - it was funny and inventive with some great characters...it's the other books in this series that made it so difficult for me. The second - The Restaurant at the End of the Universe - wasn't particularly bad, but didn't even nearly live up to Hitchhiker's Guide. I plowed through it hoping it would get better.\n\nIt didn't.\n\nHalf-way through the third book - Life, the Universe and Everything - I just got stuck. There was no longer any consistent plot, often even within the books, and I didn't really have a clue what was going on any more. There were some interesting bits but not enough to motivate me to read any more.\n\nAnd I'm disappointed about this, because there were some great characters. Marvin the depressed robot is sheer genius and I love him. Unfortunately, he's not in it all that much. Similarly, the incredibly enthusiastic doors were great, but (for obvious reasons - namely that they are doors) don't appear all too often.\n\nI love British humour - dry wit and sarcasm is very much my thing. But even that wasn't enough to save this series for me. My recommendation: read Hitchhiker's Guide, but don't bother with any of the others.\n\nI'll maybe try reading this again in a few years because I so want to love these books, and hopefully the outcome will be better. But I'm not holding my breath.\n\nFebruary 10, 2017\n\nPrilično sam sigurna da je ovo, za sada, jedina knjiga prilikom čijeg čitanja sam morala da napravim nekoliko meseci pauze zarad vlastitog dobra, što se ispostavio kao dobar potez.\n\nApsurd kojim ovih pet priča obiluje je inicijator fantastičnog humora i u više navrata sam se nasmejala glasnije nego što bih smela da priznam. Takođe, ne mogu a da se ne sažalim na sirotog Artura Denta koji mi je momentalno prirastao srcu uz još sirotijeg Marvina. Razlog za pomenutu pauzu tokom čitanja leži u neverovatnom broju obrta u pričama koji se za trenutak graniči sa besmislom i predstavlja noćnu moru bilo kome sa iole slabijom koncentracijom.\n\nSa druge strane, ni sama nisam bila svesna odličnih fazona koji su u opštoj upotrebi godinama unazad, a za koje nisam imala pojma da potiču baš iz Autostoperskog vodiča kroz galaksiju. Prema prvoj priči je snimljen i film, pa ko voli, nek' izvoli :) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371724/\n\nAugust 5, 2007\n\nDouglas Adams is either the craziest, most creative and funniest author I've ever read, or he's just on crack.\n\nOr maybe it's a little of both.\n\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and the books that follow it are all completely insane and impossible to summarize, so I'm not even going to try. They're books that can't be taken too seriously, so just sit back, relax, and enjoy the portrait of insanity Adams so expertly paints.\n\nNovember 28, 2014\n\nOne of the funniest books, and one of my favourite, ever. Read it now - it's got good writing, great jokes and the meaning of life thrown in. What more could you want?\n\nShelved as 'on-hold-not-abandoned'\n\nJune 11, 2019\n\nHitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy (5-star)\n\nWhat a blast! This zany, whacky, completely absurd story has a plot, a reason for being, a vision. It's so off the wall! I loved the absurdness and the way events came together so well, for all their craziness.\n\nI have read this \"trilogy\" of 5 books many years ago. I've remembered so much of it incorrectly. I've forgotten even more than I remember. It's wonderful to have the zaniness brought back to life in this rereading.\n\nMarvin is still my favorite character.\n\nThe Restaurant At The End Of The Universe (5 star)\n\nOriginally, this was my favorite scene in this entire book. I hope the Restaurant is as great as I remember it to be.\n\nUpdate: Yes, it is. Milliway's (the restaurant at the end of the Universe) is still an amazing restaurant to visit. The concept is so imaginative and spectacular.\n\nThe rest of this book continues in the zany, wonderful unfolding of a very good story.\n\nLife, The Universe and Everything (4-star)\n\nThe Room of Informational Illusions...…. brilliant! What a marvelous way to learn history.\n\nThe planet of Krikket….great story. A people who so cannot imagine a universe or others besides themselves who, when they learn of these things, feel the need to destroy anyone that is not them. They simply cannot imagine others. Also, I loved the reason why Earth is avoided and ignored by all the other planets and how it related to the planet Krikket.\n\nThe never-ending party!\n\nA wonderful continuation of this series. Full of off-the-wall, zany situations and feats of logic.\n\nSo Long, And Thanks For All The Fish\n\nApril 8, 2011\n\n- whew!! kept me singing that old song that goes ♫♪\"i just can't get enough!\" ♫♪\n\nMay 2, 2016\n\nSeriously, I would read anything he wrote, even his grocery lists.\n\nJune 11, 2022\n\nGuida galattica per gli autostoppisti è un ciclo di romanzi stravaganti e imprevedibili, in cui i fili seguiti dai personaggi sembrano assolutamente lasciati in balia del caso, così come in balia del caso sono gli incontri tra loro e dunque l'avanzamento della trama.\n\nLo premetto subito: alla lunga, all'ennesimo incontro totalmente fortuito con un personaggio di cui si era parlato a inizio libro, questo escamotage smette di divertire. Tuttavia, bisogna ammetterlo: Douglas Adams è stato bravo nel tener presente molto di ciò che aveva scritto in precedenza, creando una narrazione tutto sommato dotata di senso.\n\nLa vicenda incomincia quando la Terra viene demolita per lasciar spazio a un'autostrada spaziale e l'inglese Arthur Dent è così costretto a fuggire insieme all'alieno Ford Prefect, proveniente da Betelgeuse e redattore di una guida della galassia dedicata agli autostoppisti. Da allora, è un susseguirsi di peripezie a spasso per spazio, tempo e universi.\n\nPassiamo ai punti a favore: l'umorismo inglese di Adams è splendido e in alcuni punti si ride di gusto. I personaggi sono memorabili (la mia preferita è Fenchurch, purtroppo non presente in tutti i romanzi, ma anche Ford Prefect, il robot Marvin e Arthur Dent non sono affatto male). Insomma, tutto sommato la lettura viaggia rapida e colpisce positivamente.\n\nConsigliato a chi apprezza un certo umorismo demenziale; per quanto mi riguarda, è un libro da tre stelle su cinque. Romanzo preferito: Addio, e grazie per tutto il pesce.\n\nBuona lettura e ricordate: NIENTE PANICO.\n\nDecember 29, 2007\n\nWhy does British humor rely so much on the use of indifference? Just something I've noticed.\n\nSo the Earth is destroyed. In an indifferent manner, which makes it hi-larious. A bloke is saved and, unmoored in the Universe, is dragged through a series of droll hijinx. One formulaic hijinx after another, which are really just vehicles for terribly self-satisfied one-liners. And then the novel stops at a seemingly arbitrary point -- though I suspect it's actually the point of diminishing returns. At around the third novel (this is a collection of five plus a short story, remember; I expect my medal to arrive any day now), Adams begins to lick himself uncontrollably and lifts entire chapters from his earlier books. I find this utterly distasteful.\n\nThe first two novels collected here ( The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and The Restaurant at the End of the Universe) are tolerable if you enjoy dry humor. The rest is offal."
