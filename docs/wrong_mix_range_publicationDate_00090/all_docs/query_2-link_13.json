The remaining 100+ titles, as well as the lists we used, are in alphabetical order at the bottom of the page.\n\nHappy Scrolling!\n\nTop 17 Best Books For Fans Of The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy\n\n17 .) A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L’Engle\n\nLists It Appears On:\n\nBBC America\n\nTaste Dive\n\n“It was a dark and stormy night; Meg Murry, her small brother Charles Wallace, and her mother had come down to the kitchen for a midnight snack when they were upset by the arrival of a most disturbing stranger.\n\n“”Wild nights are my glory,”” the unearthly stranger told them. “”I just got caught in a downdraft and blown off course. Let me sit down for a moment, and then I’ll be on my way. Speaking of ways, by the way, there is such a thing as a tesseract.””\n\nA tesseract (in case the reader doesn’t know) is a wrinkle in time. To tell more would rob the reader of the enjoyment of Miss L’Engle’s unusual book. A Wrinkle in Time, winner of the Newbery Medal in 1963, is the story of the adventures in space and time of Meg, Charles Wallace, and Calvin O’Keefe (athlete, student, and one of the most popular boys in high school). They are in search of Meg’s father, a scientist who disappeared while engaged in secret work for the government on the tesseract problem.”\n\nPurchase / Learn More\n\n16 .) And Another Thing by Eoin Colfer\n\nLists It Appears On:\n\nTaste Dive\n\nBarnes & Noble\n\nAnd Another Thing … will be the sixth novel in the now improbably named Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy trilogy. Eight years after the death of its creator, Douglas Adams, the author’s widow, Jane Belson, has given her approval for the project to be continued by the international number one bestselling children’s writer, Eoin Colfer, author of the Artemis Fowl novels. Douglas Adams himself once said, ‘I suspect at some point in the future I will write a sixth Hitchhiker book. Five seems to be a wrong kind of number, six is a better kind of number.’ Belson said of Eoin Colfer, ‘I love his books and could not think of a better person to transport Arthur, Zaphod and Marvin to pastures new.’ Colfer, a fan of Hitchhiker since his schooldays, said, ‘Being given the chance to write this book is like suddenly being offered the superpower of your choice. For years I have been finishing this incredible story in my head and now I have the opportunity to do it in the real world.’ Prepare to be amazed…\n\nPurchase / Learn More\n\n15 .) Bill, the Galatic Hero by Harry Harrison\n\nLists It Appears On:\n\nLibrary Point\n\nQuora\n\nBill was a peaceful farm boy until he was lured by the martial music of a passing recruitment sergeant, drugged, and made to enlist in the Empire Space Corps. His basic training is sheer hell, but somehow he manages to stay alive and achieve the rank of Fusetender 6th Class in the process. En route to an engagement with the lizard-like Chingers, Bill’s spaceship is involved in a supreme conflict and — by accident — Bill is the man who saves the ship and wins the day. A grateful Galaxy awards him its highest accolade: the Purple Dart, to be presented by the Emperor himself on the fabulous aluminium-covered planet Helio. And then his adventures really start to take off in the most bizarre and surprising ways …\n\nPurchase / Learn More\n\n14 .) Guards, Guards! by Terry Pratchett\n\nLists It Appears On:\n\nReddit\n\nTaste Dive\n\n“Long believed extinct, a superb specimen of draco nobilis (“”noble dragon”” for those who don’t understand italics) has appeared in Discworld’s greatest city. Not only does this unwelcome visitor have a nasty habit of charbroiling everything in its path, in rather short order it is crowned King (it is a noble dragon, after all…). How did it get there? How is the Unique and Supreme Lodge of the Elucidated Brethren of the Ebon Night involved? Can the Ankh-Morpork City Watch restore order – and the Patrician of Ankh-Morpork to power?\n\nMagic, mayhem, and a marauding dragon…who could ask for anything more?”\n\nPurchase / Learn More\n\n13 .) Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers (Red Dwarf #1) by Grant Naylor\n\nLists It Appears On:\n\nGoodreads\n\nGoodreads 2\n\nAwakening from a drunken spree in a London pub to find himself on one of Saturn’s moons, Lister joins the Space Corps and boards the Red Dwarf, determined to return to Earth\n\nPurchase / Learn More\n\n12 .) Interesting Times (Discworld, #17; Rincewind #5) by Terry Pratchett\n\nLists It Appears On:\n\nTaste Dive\n\nGoodreads\n\n“Another outrageously clever installment in the Discworld files, Interesting Times reminds the world why Terry Pratchett is considered the best fantasy and humor writer in the English speaking world.\n\nWhen a carrier albatross arrives from the Counterweight Continent with an Urgent Request for a “”Great Wizard,”” Rincewind is “”volunteered.”” Along his absurdly delicious travels, he meets a colorful band of characters only Terry Pratchett could compile. Their mission is to either defend or destroy the Forbidden City of Hunghung. The instructions are not entirely clear.”\n\nPurchase / Learn More\n\n11 .) Lords and Ladies (Discworld, #14; Witches #4) by Terry Pratchett\n\nLists It Appears On:\n\nTaste Dive\n\nGoodreads 2\n\nThe fairies are back, but this time they don’t just want your teeth . . . Granny Weatherwax and her tiny coven are up against real elves. There’s a full supporting cast of dwarfs, wizards, trolls, Morris dancers and one orangutan. It’s Midsummer Night — no time for dreaming. And lots of hey-nonny-nonny and blood all over the place.\n\nPurchase / Learn More\n\n10 .) Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman\n\nLists It Appears On:\n\nBBC America\n\nTaste Dive\n\nRichard Mayhew is a young London businessman with a good heart whose life is changed forever when he stops to help a bleeding girl—an act of kindness that plunges him into a world he never dreamed existed. Slipping through the cracks of reality, Richard lands in Neverwhere—a London of shadows and darkness, monsters and saints, murderers and angels that exists entirely in a subterranean labyrinth. Neverwhere is home to Door, the mysterious girl Richard helped in the London Above. Here in Neverwhere, Door is a powerful noblewoman who has vowed to find the evil agent of her family’s slaughter and thwart the destruction of this strange underworld kingdom. If Richard is ever to return to his former life and home, he must join Lady Door’s quest to save her world—and may well die trying.\n\nPurchase / Learn More\n\n9 .) The Eyre Affair by Jasper Fforde\n\nLists It Appears On:\n\nLibrary Point\n\nQuora\n\nFans of Douglas Adams and P. G. Wodehouse will love visiting Jasper Fforde’s Great Britain, circa 1985, when time travel is routine, cloning is a reality (dodos are the resurrected pet of choice), and literature is taken very, very seriously: it’s a bibliophile’s dream. England is a virtual police state where an aunt can get lost (literally) in a Wordsworth poem and forging Byronic verse is a punishable offense. All this is business as usual for Thursday Next, renowned Special Operative in literary detection. But when someone begins kidnapping characters from works of literature and plucks Jane Eyre from the pages of Brontë’s novel, Thursday is faced with the challenge of her career. Fforde’s ingenious fantasy—enhanced by a Web site that re-creates the world of the novel—unites intrigue with English literature in a delightfully witty mix.\n\nPurchase / Learn More\n\n8 .) The Long Dark Tea-Time Of The Soul by Douglas Adams\n\nLists It Appears On:\n\nQuora\n\nTaste Dive\n\nWhen a passenger check-in desk shoots through the roof of a terminal at Heathrow Airport in flames, Dirk Gently investigates the cosmic forces at play\n\nPurchase / Learn More\n\n7 .) The Time Machine by H.G. Wells\n\nLists It Appears On:\n\nTaste Dive\n\nGoodreads\n\nH.G. Wells, a pioneer in the science fiction genre, produced awesomely imaginative novels whose technologies seem impossibly sophisticated for a writer living in an era before automobiles and the widespread application of electricity. In his work The Time Machine, Wells Time Traveller, a gentleman inventor living in England, traverses first thousands of years and then millions into the future, before bringing back the knowledge of the grave degeneration of the human race and the planet. One wonders if Wells could truly see into the future, as over 100 years after its publication date his visions seem timelier than ever.\n\nPurchase / Learn More\n\n6 .) To Say Nothing of the Dog, Or How We Found the Bishop’s Bird Stump at Last by Connie Willis\n\nLists It Appears On:\n\nLibrary Point\n\nAM Reading\n\n“Ned Henry is badly in need of a rest. He’s been shuttling between the 21st century and the 1940s searching for a Victorian atrocity called the bishop’s bird stump. It’s part of a project to restore the famed Coventry Cathedral, destroyed in a Nazi air raid over a hundred years earlier.\n\nBut then Verity Kindle, a fellow time traveler, inadvertently brings back something from the past. Now Ned must jump back to the Victorian era to help Verity put things right–not only to save the project but to prevent altering history itself.”\n\nPurchase / Learn More\n\n5 .) Good Omens by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett\n\nLists It Appears On:\n\nQuora\n\nReddit\n\nTaste Dive\n\n“There is a distinct hint of Armageddon in the air. According to The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch (recorded, thankfully, in 1655, before she blew up her entire village and all its inhabitants, who had gathered to watch her burn), the world will end on a Saturday. Next Saturday, in fact. So the armies of Good and Evil are amassing, the Four Bikers of the Apocalypse are revving up their mighty hogs and hitting the road, and the world’s last two remaining witch-finders are getting ready to fight the good fight, armed with awkwardly antiquated instructions and stick pins. Atlantis is rising, frogs are falling, tempers are flaring. . . . Right. Everything appears to be going according to Divine Plan.\n\nExcept that a somewhat fussy angel and a fast-living demon — each of whom has lived among Earth’s mortals for many millennia and has grown rather fond of the lifestyle — are not particularly looking forward to the coming Rapture. If Crowley and Aziraphale are going to stop it from happening, they’ve got to find and kill the Antichrist (which is a shame, as he’s a really nice kid). There’s just one glitch: someone seems to have misplaced him. . . .”\n\nPurchase / Learn More\n\n4 .)

And it is the particular story of psychohistorian Hari Seldon, the only man who can see the horrors the future has in store—a dark age of ignorance, barbarism, and violence that will last for thirty thousand years. Gathering a band of courageous men and women, Seldon leads them to a hidden location at the edge of the galaxy, where he hopes they can preserve human knowledge and wisdom through the age of darkness.\n\nPurchase / Learn More\n\n2 .) The Colour of Magic by Terry Pratchett\n\nLists It Appears On:\n\nAM Reading\n\nBBC America\n\nLibrary Point\n\nTaste Dive\n\n“The beginning of the hilarious and irreverent series that has more than 80 million copies worldwide, The Color of Magic is where we meet tourist Twoflower and wizard guide Ricewind, and follow them on their always-bizarre journeys.\n\nA writer who has been compared to Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, and Douglas Adams, Sir Terry Pratchett has created a complex, yet zany world filled with a host of unforgettable characters who navigate around a profound fantasy universe, complete with its own set of cultures and rules.”\n\nPurchase / Learn More\n\n1 .) Dirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency by Douglas Adams\n\nLists It Appears On:\n\nQuora\n\nReddit\n\nTaste Dive\n\nAM Reading\n\nBarnes & Noble\n\n“DIRK GENTLY’S HOLISTIC DETECTIVE AGENCY\n\nWe solve the whole crime\n\nWe find the whole person\n\nPhone today for the whole solution to your problem\n\n(Missing cats and messy divorces a specialty)\n\nDouglas Adams, the “master of wacky words and even wackier tales” (Entertainment Weekly) once again boggles the mind with a completely unbelievable story of ghosts, time travel, eccentric computer geniuses, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the end of the world, and—of course—missing cats.”\n\nPurchase / Learn More\n\nThe 125+ Additional Best Books similar to The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy\n\n#BookAuthorLists(Titles Appear On 1 List Each)182001: A Space OdysseyTaste Dive19A Brief History of Britain 1066-1485Nicholas VincentGoodreads20A Fine and Pleasant MiseryReddit21A Hat Full Of SkyTaste Dive22A Scanner DarklyPhilip K.
