Time for a cup of tea! Join the cosmically displaced Arthur Dent and his uncommon comrades in arms in their desperate search for a place to eat, as they hurtle across space powered by pure improbability.<br>Among Arthur&rsquo;s motley shipmates are Ford Prefect, a longtime friend and expert contributor to <i>The Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy;</i> Zaphod Beeblebrox, the three-armed, two-headed ex-president of the galaxy; Tricia McMillan, a fellow Earth refugee who&rsquo;s gone native (her name is Trillian now); and Marvin, the moody android. Their destination? The ultimate hot spot for an evening of apocalyptic entertainment and fine dining, where the food speaks for itself (literally).<br>Will they make it? The answer: hard to say.
