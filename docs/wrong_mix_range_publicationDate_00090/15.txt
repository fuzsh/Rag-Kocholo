What happens in this book?

Arthur Dent wakes up to a bulldozer about to rip his house down because England needs another bypass. By lunchtime, he becomes a refugee on an alien vessel, fleeing the demolition of the Earth because it was in the way of a new galactic bypass. Except, oops, it turns out the Earth was a grand experiment to discover the question behind the answer of the purpose of “Life, the Universe, and Everything.” The answer is 42. The question is not a fragment of the Bob Dylan lyric, “How many roads must a man walk down…” On the journey, Arthur Dent and his alien friend Ford encounter a manic-depressive robot, a two-headed ex-galactic president, working together to complete the quest for the meaning of life. It's a hilarious rollercoaster through the cosmos filled with wit and whimsy.
