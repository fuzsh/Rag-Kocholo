Set in contemporary Pakistan, the 1980 film The Blood of Hussain is a gripping and provocative drama that explores themes of power, religion, and identity in the aftermath of a political revolution. Directed by Jamil Dehlavi and starring Salmaan Peerzada, Kika Markham, and Durriya Kazi, this film is a powerful exploration of the complexities of Islamic politics and the consequences of revolutionary zeal.

The Blood of Hussain begins with the assassination of a revolutionary leader, Hussain (Peerzada), by the military regime in power at the time. His sister Zainab (Markham) is left to navigate the political landscape on her own, as the revolution that Hussain helped to incite fizzles out into violence and chaos. Zainab becomes increasingly frustrated with the situation, and eventually decides to stage a symbolic protest in memory of her brother, taking a stone from the ruins of a sacred mosque and declaring it the blood of Hussain. She then puts the stone on display in an empty mosque, drawing enormous public attention and sparking a new wave of revolutionary zeal.

As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that the conflict between religious militants and secular authorities lies at the heart of this film. The Blood of Hussain explores the tension between these two groups, highlighting the ways in which religion can be used to justify violence and oppression, or to inspire hope and resistance. The film's complex narrative weaves together multiple threads of power and ideology, forcing viewers to confront the moral dilemmas at the heart of revolutionary politics.

At the same time, the film is a powerful meditation on the nature of identity and belonging. Zainab, as a Westerner, is caught between two worlds, struggling to reconcile her desire for political change with her sense of cultural dislocation. The Blood of Hussain explores this tension with sensitivity and nuance, drawing viewers into a profound examination of what it means to be a Muslim in the modern world.

Throughout the film, the cinematography is breathtaking, capturing both the beauty and the brutality of Pakistan's urban landscapes. The contrast between the serenity of the empty mosque and the chaos of the city outside is particularly striking, underscoring the film's themes of violence and resistance.

In terms of acting, Salmaan Peerzada delivers a powerful performance as Hussain, imbuing the character with a sense of moral authority that resonates throughout the film. Durriya Kazi is equally impressive as the fiery and determined Zainab, bringing a palpable sense of urgency to the character's quest for meaning and purpose. Kika Markham, for her part, portrays the complexities of Zainab's situation with grace and subtlety, capturing both the character's idealism and her despair.

The Blood of Hussain is not an easy film to watch: it is a challenging and thought-provoking meditation on some of the most difficult questions of our time. But it is also a courageous and important work of cinema, showcasing the power of art to challenge our assumptions and push us to think deeply about the world around us. Overall, this is a film that deserves to be seen by anyone with an interest in Islamic politics, social justice, or the transformative nature of cinema itself.
