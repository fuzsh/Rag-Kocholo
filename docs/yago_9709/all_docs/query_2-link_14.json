Italy\n\nGold Medal : Houston International Film Festival, USA\n\nGrand Prize : Jackson Hole Mountain Film Festival, USA\n\nSpecial Jury Prize :Telluride Mountain Film Festival, USA\n\nDiable d’Or : Festival International du Film Alpin, Les Diablerets, Switzerland\n\nREVIEWS\n\n‘Watch out for a stunning new film QÂF - THE SACRED MOUNTAIN, Jamil Dehlavi’s homage to a volcano. Part of the Worldwise season, QÂF portrays the awesome power of a volcanic eruption. The dreamlike, mystical quality of the film is represented by its title: In Islamic cosmology QÂF is the mother of all mountains which are linked to it by subterranean branches. When one of these is set in motion cataclysmic eruptions occur.’\n\nChannel 4 Television\n\n‘Huge streams of lava pelting down a mountainside with Tangerine Dream music to ease its passage. The results are quite extraordinary. Nothing for it but to let your jaw swing loose and marvel.’\n\nTime Out\n\n‘A hauntingly beautiful, surrealistic documentary. Jamil Dehlavi is a visionary filmmaker who has transformed the boundary between the visible world of the senses and the unseen world into the abstract painting in motion.’\n\nAsian Times\n\n‘A magical, hypnotic film that gives a surreal view of the underworld exposed. A spellbinding study of creation.’\n\nTelluride Gazette"
