        "text": "(English dialogue)\n\nThe filmmakers of “Jinnah” no doubt hoped that the saga of the man behind the creation of Pakistan would elicit “Gandhi”-like commercial response internationally. And while this history lesson has some potent drama, it plays mostly to an initiated, upscale public. Theatrical prospects are very limited in America and Europe, where the partition of India reps an esoteric subject and the reverential stance toward the title character will be mystifying.\n\nThough much of the filmmaking is classic biopic template, the story is given an unusual structure that lightens the tone, allows for debate and humanizes the larger than life characters and situations. In the opening frames, Jinnah (Christopher Lee) is being rushed to hospital. Presumably mortally ill, he succumbs and a moment later awakens in some celestial clearing house where a decision on his eternal soul will be made. Unfortunately, his file is missing and the computers are malfunctioning.\n\nHis guide (Sashi Kapoor) queries him about his life and politics, and, in this way, the cogent details evolve. The action rolls back to 1947, as Britain prepares to grant India its independence. Jinnah is advocating a separate nation for the Muslim minority, much to the dismay of viceroy Montbatten (James Fox), who hopes to enlist Gandhi (Sam Dastor) and Nehru (Robert Ashby) to dissuade their political adversary from splitting the soon-to-be former colony. Gandhi suggests making Jinnah prime minister, to the chagrin of Nehru.\n\nThe offer will be turned down forcefully, and one senses Gandhi suspected such a compromise was untenable. The roots of this resolve are then made clear as the story continues in 1916, when the younger Jinnah (Richard Lintern) was a rising star on the one-India Congress Party. The flashback also reveals his marriage to a young Parsee woman (Indira Varma) and the lifelong bond with his equally strong willed sister Fatima (Shireen Shah).\n\nIn an effort to break with dry, simplistic biopic constraints, some magic realism, in the form of a fanciful examination, is introduced and goes a long way to provide a fresh perspective, though little doubt is left about the heroes and villains of this page of history.\n\nLee, a seemingly unusual choice for the title role, is afforded one of his meatiest screen roles. He is never less than credible, investing Jinnah with dignity, resolve and humor and making him accessible to an audience unfamiliar with his role in this violent chapter. His nemesis is Montbatten who, as limned by Fox, is vain and oblivious in a manner that is understandable and frightening. The support cast also gets into the spirit of bringing life to history, particularly Shah, Ashby and Maria Aitken as Lady Montbatten. Kapoor is simply a delightful impish invention asking the questions the audience wants to hear.\n\nDirector and co-writer Jamil Dehlavi skillfully mounts an epic canvas on a limited budget. The constraints only pop up briefly when he attempts massive reconstructions of carnage or exodus that falter in conveying the sweep of time. Otherwise, it’s lushly visualized by cameraman Nic Knowland and backed up by a grand score and characters of flesh and blood."
