        "text": "‘Few individuals significantly alter the course of history. Fewer still modify the map of the world. Hardly anyone can be credited with creating a nation-state. Muhammad Ali Jinnah did all three’\n\nSo wrote Stanley Wolpert in his acclaimed 1984 biography of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the man who was almost single-handedly responsible for splitting Pakistan from India. A source of much controversy throughout its making, this 1998 biopic from Pakistani-French indie filmmaker Jamil Dehlavi opened to great acclaim in Pakistan but was not made available in the English-speaking world – until Eureka Entertainment brought it out in a dual format release in the UK in 2016. That release has since been discontinued, and copies now fetch silly money on Amazon.\n\nHowever, here’s your chance to see the film anew as Indicator is releasing a Limited Edition Blu-ray featuring a sparkly new HD remaster supervised by the film’s director, Jamil Dehlavi, and it includes an insightful documentary that was not included in the Eureka release, plus a host of bonus material. Whether you’re in the UK or the US, both releases are region-free. Available from 29 January 2024.\n\nFollowing his death on 11 September 1948, Muhammad Ali Jinnah (Christopher Lee) awaits final judgement in the afterlife and must tell the story of his life before his celestial minder (Shashi Kapoor). His story covers the intense political strife and bloody events that led to the formation of the Muslim nation, starting in 1947 as Lord Mountbatten (James Fox) uses his diplomatic whiles to persuade Mahatma Gandhi (Sam Dastor) and Jawaharlal Nehru (Robert Ashby) to join in his effort to stop Jinnah’s homeland campaign…\n\nThis is a lavishly mounted, intensely moving piece of cinema. If you’re not offended by an English actor playing a Pakistani, then Lee certainly delivers one of the finest performances of his career. It’s certainly one that he was most proud of – he even bears much countenance to the revered real-life statesman, not only in appearance but also in some of the character traits that are explored in his inventive biopic that not only addresses Jinnah the politician but also the man – especially his regrets in his personal relationships with his two wives and daughter, Dina. My other best-acting vote goes to Maria Aitken’s fabulous turn as the manipulative Lady Edwina Mountbatten.\n\nINDICATOR LIMITED EDITION BLU-RAY SPECIAL FEATURES"
