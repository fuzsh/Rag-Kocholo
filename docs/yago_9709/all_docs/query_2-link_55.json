        "text": "Mystery dramas were massively popular with American listeners during the Golden Age of Radio. The Whistler, which ran on CBS from 1942 to 1955 with 692 episodes, was one of them. I’ve never heard of it, even though I’m a fan of vintage radio shows, notably The Saint (1947-1951), which starred Vincent Price (of course) as Leslie Charteris’s ‘devil-may-care Robin Hood’ Simon Templar.\n\nAnd just as RKO adapted The Saint for a series of feature films (1938-1943) with Louis Hayward, George Sanders and Hugh Sinclair taking on Templar’s mantle, Columbia Pictures did the same with The Whistler – as part of their series of B-movie crime programmers like Boston Blackie. Between 1944 and 1948, eight B-features, running just 60 minutes each, were produced. Oscar-nominated actor Richard Dix, who was picked based on his performance in Val Lewton’s The Ghost Ship, starred in seven, and Michael Duane played the lead in the last one as Dix had decided to retire from acting.\n\nThe Whistler (voiced by Otto Forrest, who reminded me of American psychic Criswell) acted as the host/narrator, emerging as a shadow with a haunting whistle and heavy footsteps to introduce and comment on the action in each twisted tale of crime and punishment in which Dix would play different characters that were either heroic, villainous or everyman besieged by fate.\n\nFuture gimmick showman William Castle cut his filmmaking teeth directing four of the features, bringing an eerie air with some low-key lighting effects and inventive camera angles (that would inform his later work), and by bringing them under budget, Castle became an in-demand director throughout the 1950s until he decided to go independent and scare the pants off America with such classics as House on Haunted Hill and Strait-Jacket.\n\nFor Indicator’s sixth release in their Columbia Noir collection, all eight films have been brought together in a four-disc Blu-ray box set. Each disc has two features alongside an array of extras, including commentaries, critical appreciations and image galleries, and a 120-page booklet which includes new and archival essays, including a great one from Tim Lucas (I especially liked how he connected these films to David Lynch’s Blue Velvet). If you have never seen these films, I recommend reading Tim’s article and tuning into Kim Newman’s essential primer, A Whistle-Stop Tour, on the first disc beforehand.\n\nDISC ONE\n\nThe Whistler (1944, dir William Castle)\n\nAfter failing to save his wife (Gloria Stuart, of The Old Dark House and Titanic fame) from drowning at sea, guilt-stricken industrialist Earl C. Conrad (Dix) hires a contract killer (House of Frankenstein’s J. Carrol Naish) to end his life – but when his wife turns up alive, he discovers he can’t renege on the deal.\n\nThe Mark of the Whistler (1944, dir William Castle)\n\nIn this tale, scripted by The Devil Bat‘s George Bricker, based on pulp fiction author Cornell Woolrich’s short story, Dormant Account, homeless drifter Lee Nugent (Dix) swindles $30,000 from an abandoned bank account by impersonating someone with the same name. But he’s soon targeted by the rightful owner’s sons (one of whom is played by famed US magician John Calvert).\n\n• Audio commentary with film historian Josh Nelson on The Whistler (2024)\n\n• A Whistle-Stop Tour (2024, 25 mins): an in-depth overview of the film series by critic and author Kim Newman\n\n• It’s Your America (1945, 36 mins): a dramatised documentary focusing on soldiers returning from World War II, directed by John Ford and featuring J. Carrol Naish.\n\nDISC TWO\n\nThe Power of the Whistler (1945, dir Lew Landers)\n\nFortune teller Jean Lang (Janis Carter) is determined to help amnesiac William Everest (Dix) uncover his name and past using the items he carries in his pockets – but gets the shock of her life when he turns out to be an escaped maniac from a mental hospital. Director Landers worked on over 100 features throughout his 50+ year career, including the classic Bela Lugosi/Boris Karloff 1935 horror, The Raven.\n\nVoice of the Whistler (1945, dir William Castle)\n\nLoneliness is the key theme in this entry as the wealthy John Sinclair (Dix), who has six months to live, makes a deal with his nurse, Joan (Lynn Merrick), that they marry, and she will inherit his fortune after his death. Seven months after settling into a refurbished lighthouse, John is still very much alive, Joan wants out, and her ex-fiancé Fred (James Cardwell) returns to claim her back… Cue some deadly action as Fred and John try to bump each other off.\n\n• Audio commentary with film scholar Professor Jason A Ney on The Power of the Whistler (2024)\n\n• Audio commentary with the late film historian Lee Gambin (who tragically died, aged just 44, in May, on Voice of the Whistler (2024)\n\n• The Noir City Interview with Robert Dix (2010, 19 mins): an interview with the son of Richard Dix, recorded in LA following a screening of The Power of the Whistler\n\n• Stuart Holmes Oral History (1958, 69 mins): archival audio recording of the prolific character actor in conversation with historian George Pratt\n\nDISC THREE\n\nMysterious Intruder (1946, dir William Castle)\n\nUnscrupulous private detective Don Gale (Dix) gets mixed up in murder and mayhem when he’s hired to find a missing girl whose family inheritance contains two rare collectable song recordings from real-life Swedish singer Jenny Lind. This one features Barton MacLane, who famously played General Peterson in I Dream of Jeannie and professional wrestler/Hollywood heavy Mike Mazurki. It was also Castle’s final feature in the series as he would head off to work with Orson Welles on The Lady from Shanghai.\n\nThe Secret of the Whistler (1946, dir George Sherman)\n\nDix plays ‘kept husband’ Ralph Harrison, who poisons his wealthy wife Edith (Mary Currier), who suffers from bouts of heart attacks, so he can marry artist model Kay (Leslie Brooks). But Edith soon becomes suspicious. A well-acted, well-paced entry from director George Sherman, best known for low-budget Westerns in the 1930s and 1940s, and also the 1971 John Wayne classic, Big Jake, which marked his final feature.\n\n• Audio commentary with film historian Jeremy Arnold on Mysterious Intruder (2024)\n\n• Working in the Shadows (2024, 22 mins): Kim Newman looks over William Castle’s early career as a studio-contracted director\n\nDISC FOUR\n\nThe Thirteenth Hour (1947, dir William Clemens)\n\nHere, Dix plays Steve Reynolds, a trucking company owner who can’t get a brake as a rival firm wants him out of the picture. Framed for running down a police officer, Steve, with the help of his fiancé Eileen (Karen Morley) and her son Tommy (Mark Dennis), is determined to prove his innocence armed with a crucial piece of evidence – a glove containing diamonds in the thumb. It was a tremendous final stint from Dix and well-directed by William Clemens, who had previously helmed three Falcon films (RKO’s The Saint imitations). Karen Morley had a burgeoning career in the 1930s and 1940s (check her out in 1932’s The Mask of Fu Manchu), but her career floundered after being blacklisted by the Un-American Activities Committee. Little Mark Dennis also appeared in 1947’s Secret Beyond the Door and 1968’s Targets.\n\nThe Return of the Whistler (1948, dir D. Ross Lederman)\n\nAnother Cornell Woolrich story, All At Once, No Alice, forms the basis for this final entry in the series. Helmed by another actioner director, D. Ross Lederman, it stars Michael Duane as a man whose fiancée Alice (Lenore Aubert, best known for Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein) is abducted on the eve of their wedding. As he – and a dogged PI (Boston Blackie regular Richard Lane) – investigate, it turns out Alice is the heir to an estate, and her murderous in-laws are determined to be rid of her.\n\n• Audio commentary with academic Eloise Ross on The Thirteenth Hour (2024)\n\n• It’s Murder (1944, 9 mins): dramatised documentary produced for the war effort directed by Edward Bernds (who helmed 1959’s Return of the Fly and 1958’s Queen of Outer Space)\n\nTwo of my favourite Ozploitation films, Patrick (1978) and Snapshot (1979), have been given a glorious 4K restoration, and Powerhouse Films have gone to town with their Indicator boxset releases, which include some marvellous bonus material alongside the UHD and Blu-ray editions. Available now.\n\nFirst up is Patrick, from director Richard Franklin, starring Susan Penhaligon, Sir Robert Helpmann, Rod Mullinar, Bruce Barry, and Julia Blake and introducing Robert Thompson as the film’s titular protagonist.\n\nPenhaligon plays British nurse, Kathy Jacquard, who takes up a nursing position at a private clinic in Melbourne after leaving her Australian husband, Ed (Mullinar). There, she is charged with looking after Patrick (Thompson), who has been in a comatose state after murdering his parents three years previously. The hospital’s owner, Dr Roget (Helpmann), is keeping Patrick alive as part of an experiment to explore the nature of life and death. But unbeknownst to them all, Patrick has psychokinetic powers and, falling for Kathy, begins a murderous campaign against anyone who comes between them…\n\nProduced by Antony I. Ginnane and written by Everett De Roche (whose first feature screenplay was Long Weekend), Patrick was shot over seven weeks in Sydney and edited over three months before its Australian release in October 1978 (the same time as Long Weekend). While it performed poorly there, Patrick‘s subsequent international release was a huge success. It paved the way for a slew of Ginnane-produced thrillers – including Snapshot (1979) and Harlequin (1980), both directed by Simon Wincer, Thirst (1979) with Rod Hardy at the helm, and Survivor (1981), directed by David Hemmings. It also marked Franklin’s ascent as a director and producer, with Roadgames (1981) and Psycho II (1983) following in Patrick‘s wake.\n\nFor me, Patrick reigns supreme within the Ozploitation genre. Franklin crafts his Hitchcockian thriller with meticulous detail, an eye for suspense, and just the right amount of shocks and scares; Brian May’s Bernard Herrmann-esque score is suitably atmospheric, as is Donald McAlpine’s lighting and cinematography, and the special effects are bang on. De Roche also gives us a collection of believable characters, all with their quirks, especially Julia Blake’s hard-as-nails matron, who is frightened of Patrick and Helpman’s ‘mad as a box of frogs’ shrink. Franklin also makes excellent use of the filming location, the 1885 Simmonds Hall mansion in South Yarra, which doubles as the Roget Clinic.\n\nCompletists will love the Powerhouse release as it features three versions: the Australian theatrical release (the go-to one for me), the Italian-language version which opts for a score by Dario Argento’s favourite prog-rockers Goblin (the one I’ve longed to see and hear – especially now that English subtitles have been included for the first time – and I’ll be watching this repeatedly now), and the heavily-shortened re-dubbed American cut (I’ll be giving that one a miss thank you!).\n\nThe new 4K restoration from the original negative is available both as a Limited Edition 4K UHD with Dolby Vision HDR and as a separate Limited Edition Blu-ray, and the bonus extras (see the full list below) are most welcomed for this huge fan of the film.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nHot on the heels of Patrick‘s success at Cannes, Tony Ginnane put together his thriller follow-up, 1978’s Snapshot. Everett De Roche wrote the script in a month, and the 21-day shot again took place on location in Melbourne, while directing duties fell to Simon Wincer, who had cut his teeth on the popular Crawford TV cop shows Matlock Police, Division 4 and Homicide.\n\nOnce again, Ginnane was able to score success overseas, especially in Norway and in the US, where indie producer Brandon Chase (of Alligator fame) had the foresight to capitalise on the success of John Carpenter’s Halloween, by releasing the film under the title, The Day After Halloween.\n\nMaking her first lead in a feature, Australian TV actor Sigrid Thornton (who was known for The Sullivans and Father, Dear Father in Australia in 1978), plays naïve hairdresser Angela, living under the thumb of her domineering mother, who is persuaded by her model friend Madeline (Chantel Contouri) to try glamour modelling.\n\nAfter posing topless on a beach for a fashion photographer (Hugh Keays-Byrne, AKA Mad Max‘s Toecutter), she is soon on the road to stardom – but not without a cost. Her ex-boyfriend Daryl (Vince Gill, AKA Mad Max‘s Nightrider) keeps following her about in his Mr Whippy ice cream van, and wealthy modelling agency owner Daryl (Robert Bruning) has his eye on seducing her. But who is the real threat to her life?\n\nI have a soft spot for Snapshot, mainly for the fact I’m a big fan of both Sigrid Thornton and Chantel Contori. At the time of the film’s release in Australia (in April 1979), the two actors were well-known to us Aussies for appearing in the period soap The Sullivans – probably the most watched show on telly at the time, and Thornton also had a stint in my favourite sitcom, Father, Dear Father In Australia. Being only 15 in 1979, I remember it was rather risqué to see her naked picture on posters for the film at the time – but it only made me want to see the film (which I did at the drive-ins) even more.\n\nNow, while it doesn’t have Patrick‘s Hitchcockian vibe, Snapshot is a tautly directed thriller – with subtle hints of grimy exploitation. Thornton totally carries the picture, as does Brian May’s lush piano-heavy score and the scope cinematography (by Vincent Monton, who had previously lensed Long Weekend and Newsfront). Revisiting the film again via this new restoration release, I think it still holds up well, and I thoroughly enjoyed all the bonus extras included here – especially Grant Page’s commentary, which is especially poignant as the legendary stuntman died, aged 85, on 14 March, just 11 days before this Powerhouse Films/Indicator release.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nPATRICK LIMITED EDITION BLU-RAY SPECIAL FEATURES\n\n• New 4K restoration from the original negative by Powerhouse Films\n\n• Three presentations of the film: the Australian theatrical version (113 mins), the US theatrical cut (97 mins), and the Italian-language version (102 mins)\n\n• Original mono audio\n\n• Audio commentary with director Richard Franklin and screenwriter Everett De Roche (2002)\n\n• On-set Interview with Richard Franklin (1978, 10 mins) conducted by film critic Ivan Hutchinson\n\n• On-stage Interview with Richard Franklin (2001, 9 mins): previously unseen interview in which the director discusses Patrick and its unofficial Italian sequel, 1980’s Patrick Still Lives\n\n• A Coffee Break with Antony I.

Available from 29 January 2024, exclusively to the Powerhouse Films website.\n\nTaylor plays workaholic London-based talent agent Peter Reaney, who is disenchanted with his high-flying job and marriage. Having had enough of Peter’s absence and constant drinking, his long-suffering wife, Amanda (Penelope Horner), walks out on him. Unable to face being alone in the marital apartment (cold and clinically designed in the latest pop art trend), Peter is welcomed into the home of his best friend and work colleague Val Pringle (James Booth) and his wife Jody (Carol White).\n\nBut Peter’s loyalty is put to the test when he has an affair with Jody that is unwittingly been ignited by Val’s own womanising. Meanwhile, Peter also starts to question the morality of his trade when his boss tasks him with protecting their main client, popstar Barry Black (Clive Francis), when one of his groupies is forced into having a backstreet abortion.\n\nPenned by Chris Bryant and Allan Scott (their first screenplay together before hitting success with Nicolas Roeg’s Don’t Look Now) based on Gordon M. Williams’ bawdy 1967 bestseller of the same name, the film, directed by John Krish (Unearthly Stranger) attempts to be: ‘a penetrating and provocative look at the “Mod” London of pop stars, press agents and talent agents, and the city’s contemporary roistering life of its playboys and playgirls.’\n\nA hirsute middle-aged Taylor is quite amusing as the boozing Lothario (although he wasn’t faking the drunk scenes); Booth is a hoot as his jokey writer pal, and White shows great depth as his wife. It’s such a shame, however, that the Poor Cow/Cathy Come Home star had such a tragic life (she had her own issues with alcohol and drugs and died aged just 48 in 1991).\n\nThe supporting cast includes some famous faces like Keith Barron and Valerie Leon (who gets a great scene towering over Francis’ annoying egoist), while the music is courtesy of American jazz maestro Johnny Mandel (who scored Robert Altman’s M*A*S*H in the same year).\n\nAn odd fusion of domestic drama and comedy; it doesn’t all work (which is probably the reason why it flopped commercially). There are a couple of humourous moments (like the fried eggs stuck on a fridge and the truckload of toilet bowls) – but these sit oddly with the film’s darker scenes – like sleazy Black’s young victim’s sad, lonely demise in a cinema showing cartoons. Still, it’s a fascinating time capsule to London circa 1968/1969, and film location fans will have great fun tracking them down.\n\nIndicator’s world premiere Blu-ray release includes extensive interview material with director Krish, as well as newly restored versions of two of Krish’s short films – Break-In (1956) and the anti-apartheid drama-documentary Let My People Go (1961).\n\nLIMITED EDITION BLU-RAY SPECIAL FEATURES\n\n4K restoration\n\nOriginal mono audio\n\nThe BEHP Interview with John Krish (1994–2004, 90 mins): an archival audio recording of the celebrated director in a career-spanning conversation with Rodney Giesler, made as part of the British Entertainment History Project\n\nA Bad Marriage (2024, 11 mins): screenwriter Allan Scott discusses the process of adapting The Man Who Had Power Over Women for the big screen with writing partner Chris Bryant, and the reasons for removing their names from the final film\n\nBreak-In (1956, 44 mins): Krish’s dramatised training film about the military police, made for the British Army and featuring Jim Dale in his earliest-known screen appearance\n\nLet My People Go (1961, 24 mins): Krish’s powerful, polemical film which combines archival footage and staged reconstructions to inform and educate about the brutal realities of Apartheid in South Africa\n\nImage gallery: promotional and publicity materials\n\nNew and improved English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing\n\n40-page booklet with a new essay by Vic Pratt, archival interviews with Rod Taylor and John Krish, new writing on Break-In, Patrick Russell on Let My People Go, and film credits\n\nPresented by Nicolas Winding Refn in a new 4K restoration, Curtis Harrington’s 1961 fantasy thriller Night Tide is an offbeat classic of American independent cinema, and it makes its UK Blu-ray debut with this must-have box-set from Powerhouse Films.\n\nNight Tide sees Dennis Hopper (in his first starring role) playing a sailor on shore leave in San Diego, where he meets a young woman called Mora (Linda Lawson) who not only works in a sideshow as a mermaid, but actually believes she is one of the mythical Sirens, who lure young men to their deaths…\n\nA dream-like fusion of arthouse, expressionism and the surreal, dominated by high-contrast lighting and deep shadows, Harrington’s first feature pays homage Val Lewton (one of Harrington’s heroes) and his classic 1942 chiller Cat People – and cements the young film-maker’s poetic cinematic vision that was born out of his earlier experimental shorts. This new restoration is simply luminous and one that I can happily watch over and over again.\n\nExclusive to this two-disc region free set is a bonus Blu-ray devoted to eight of Harrington’s short films. Previously released by Flicker Alley and Drag City in the US following painstaking restoration by the Academy Film Archive (that was carried out between 2003 and 2007 – the year of Harrington’s death, aged 80), these shorts (also making their UK Blu-ray debut) are a key insight into Harrington’s development as a film-maker…\n\nThe Fall of the House of Usher (1942, 10 mins): Inspired to become a film-maker after reading Paul Rotha’s The Film Till Now: A Survey of World Cinema, Harrington was just 16 when he crafted this hallucingenic and campy homemade short in which he plays both Roderick and Madeline Usher. It might be very low budget is bursting with style that would later inform his cinematic vision.\n\nFragment of Seeking (1946, 14 mins): This ‘examination of youthful narcissism’ was heavily influenced by Maya Deren’s influential Meshes of the Afternoon and is very much a companion piece to Kenneth Anger’s Fireworks in its exploration of homosexuality. In fact, when the two friends first screened their ‘erotic dream pieces’ to an LA art group, they were deemed ‘very sick boys’. Good on them!\n\nPicnic (1948, 23 mins): Harrington persuaded his own parents to star in this ‘satire of middle-class life’, in which an angry young man chases false love and desires to escape authoritive control. Acclaimed French director and film critic Jacques Rivette praised the film’s poetic expression.\n\nOn the Edge (1949, 6 mins): Surrealism comes to the fore in this powerful short about youthful dissatisfaction and human frailty, which uses the wild and desolate landscape of Salton Sea (near Brawley, California) to great effect.\n\nThe Assignation (1953, 8 mins): In this love letter to Venice and in his first short in colour that was long deemed lost until it was rediscovered in the vaults of the Cinematheque Française, Harrington explores themes of ‘fleeting human connection’ while also showcasing the city’s brooding architecture.\n\nThe Wormwood Star (1956, 10 mins): This is my personal favourite and comes with a very interesting history. Entranced by the LA artist Marjorie Cameron, a magnetic and alluring woman whom he had met while appearing in Kenneth Anger’s Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome and who makes a witchy cameo in Night Tide, Harrington crafted this arty occult short to ‘present Cameron/the artist as alchemist who, through her creative work, becomes herself transmuted into gold’.\n\nVery much part of the occult milieu of Southern California at the time, Cameron was a unique and troubled soul whose lovers included rocket scientist and Aleister Crowley follower Jack Parsons (who developed a belief system that was later appropriated by Ron L Hubbard — guess what that was?) and psychedelic artist Burt Shonberg (who was commissioned to create the ancestor paintings in Roger Corman’s House of Usher). Cameron later burned most of the pieces that appear in the short (which was filmed in the home of surrealist collector Edward James), so this is only record of her unique artistry.\n\nThe Four Elements (1966, 13 mins): Commissioned by the United States Information Agency, Harrington was tasked to make this propaganda film to show off the might of American industry. He does so, but with his distinctive flair. Following this short, Harrington went on to craft a host of psychological thrillers like Games (1967) and Who Slew Auntie Roo? (1971) that have now attracted cult status, and TV movies like Cat Creature (1973) and Killer Bees (1974), then ended up helming episodes of the biggest and campest soaps of the 19870s, Dynasty and The Colbys.\n\nUsher (2002, 37 mins): This final inclusion sees Harrington return to what made him become a film-maker in the first place: ‘the art of it’. Filmed at his home with a crew made up of friends (and Church of Satan members, Nikolas and Zeena Schreck), its an atmospheric and humourous take on the same Poe tale that began his cinematic journey.\n\nThis box-set is currently my No.1 home entertainment release of 2020, and could only be bettered by seeing all of Harrington’s features and TV movies in another box-set or two. In the meantime, here are the complete specs on Powerhouse/Indictator’s fabulous release.\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES:\n\nDISC ONE: NIGHT TIDE\n\n• New 4K restoration\n\n• Original mono audio\n\n• Audio commentary (from 1998) with writer-director Curtis Harrington and actor Dennis Hopper (This is a must-listen and very informative on the making of the film – also a piece of cinema history as both of them are no longer with us)\n\n• New audio commentary with writer and film programmer Tony Rayns (excellent as always)\n\n• Harrington on Harrington (2018, 25 mins): wide-ranging archival interview with the filmmaker\n\n• The Sinister Image: Curtis Harrington (1987, 57 mins): two episodes from David Del Valle’s public access series devoted to cult cinematic figures (It was fantastic to finally see this)\n\n• Original theatrical trailer\n\n• Image gallery: publicity and promotional material\n\n• New and improved English subtitles\n\nDISC TWO: DREAM LOGIC – THE SHORT FILMS OF CURTIS HARRINGTON\n\n• High Definition remasters\n\n• Original mono audio\n\n• Eight short films: The Fall of the House of Usher (1942, 10 mins); Fragment of Seeking (1946, 14 mins); Picnic (1948, 23 mins); On the Edge (1949, 6 mins); The Assignation (1953, 8 mins); The Wormwood Star (1956, 10 mins); The Four Elements (1966, 13 mins); Usher (2002, 37 mins)\n\n• Image gallery: production photography and a rare selection from Harrington’s personal collection\n\n• New and improved English subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing\n\n• 80-page collector’s book featuring new writing on Night Tide by Paul Duane, Curtis Harrington on Night Tide and the short films, archival articles by Harrington on horror cinema, experimental films and the making of Picnic, an overview of critical responses, Peter Conheim on the restoration of Night Tide, and film credits\n\n• Limited edition exclusive set of five facsimile lobby cards\n\nBased on MR James’ classic tale of terror Casting the Runes and adapted for the screen by regular Hitchcock collaborator Charles Bennett, director Jacques Tourneur’s Night of the Demon is considered to be one of the seminal horror films of 20th-century cinema.\n\nNiall MacGinnis is the politely malevolent Dr Julian Karswell, an eminent British scientist who has been dabbling in black magic (while also hosting children’s parties dressed as a clown). When rival scientist Professor Harrington (Maurice Denham), threatens to expose his nefarious activities, Karswell invokes a demon which kills him.\n\nDana Andrews plays the sceptical psychologist Dr. John Holden who refuses to believe Harrington’s niece Joanna (Peggy Cummins) when she suspects something demonic is at work, but he soon has good cause to think she is telling the truth when Karswell passes him a piece of parchment at London’s British Museum which may bring about his death inside four days…\n\nAlthough the titular demon appears at the beginning and the end, it’s the constant level of fear throughout that makes this classic British horror such a genuinely scary chiller and remains a bona fide classic of the genre.\n\nIt was also famously referred to in Science Fiction/Double Feature (the opening track in Richard O’Brien’s Rocky Horror Picture Show), with the witty line: ‘Dana Andrews says prunes gave him the runes…’\n\nReleased on Blu-ray for the very first time in the UK from Powerhouse Films/Indicator, Night of the Demon is presented here in four different versions (including the BFI’s 2013 2K restoration of the 96-minute version), and is accompanied by a huge array of new and archival special features., plus a double-sided poster and 80-page book.

Just witness his 1960s quartet, La Notte, L’Eclisse, L’avventura and il deserto rosso, and his hip cult hit Blow-Up.\n\nAfter a dalliance with the American counterculture movement in 1970s Zabriskie Point, the Italian auteur returned to his favourite themes for The Passenger, his third film with producer Carlo Ponti. Unfortunately, it died a death at the box office and quickly went out of circulation for many decades, until a re-release back in 2005, which has resulted in a growing new appreciation for this hidden gem.\n\nThis is the first time that the film has been released on Blu-ray in the UK, and the re-master is a knockout! Now, I absolutely adore Antonioni’s eye for the visual. Every shot is framed with a painterly approach, and he really knows how to use landscape and architecture as character.\n\nThe Passenger is no exception. Just take a look at the above screen grab. This was taken from a scene shot in a specially-built hotel in the Almeria town of Vera (standing in for Osuna in the film). The way the light falls on the straight lines of the interior just makes me swoon. The art decoration is by Piero Poletto (who also worked on L’Eclisse and L’avventura), while the camerawork is courtesy of Lucian Tovoli, who’d famously go onto lens Dario Argento’s Suspiria two years later.\n\nTovoli makes great use of some stunning Spanish locations and especially some iconic modernist buildings, including Antoni Gaudi’s La Pedrera and Parc Guell in Barcelona, and Patrick Hodgkinson’s modernist Brunswick Centre in London’s Bloomsbury (which had opened just a couple of years before the film was made).\n\nBut the stand-out scene is a seven-minute long tacking shot right at the end of the movie – and it is worth the wait as it was a major technical achievement at the time, that required the camera to move through a door barred with grates, then do a 180 degree turn and return back to the hotel interior. Of course, it could all be done with CGI today, but here Antonioni is at his most inventive and meticulous.\n\nTypical of the director, the story is real head-spinner. Jack Nicholson plays world-weary journalist David Locke, who is making a documentary in Chad when he impulsively takes on the identity of a man called Robertson, whom he finds dead in his hotel room. He sees it as a chance to escape his old life and his wayward wife Rachel (The Final Programme‘s Jenny Runacre).\n\nBut he gets more than he bargained for when it turns out Robertson was a shady arms dealer and rashly takes a bundle of cash from gun-runners who want their merchandise. And Locke’s problems don’t stop there, as Rachel wants answers about his death and a cat and mouse situation ensues as Locke tries to flee the country aided by a young architecture student (Maria Schneider of Last Tango in Paris fame)…\n\nThis Blu-ray release of Antonioni’s arty road movie-cum-thriller is probably my favourite find of 2018 so far. It is also Jack Nicholson’s favourite film – so much so, he owns a personal print of the film.\n\nPowerhouse Films’ Indicator UK Blu-ray release features a high definition remaster with the original mono audio and new and improved English subtitles, and the following special features…\n\n• Alternative presentation: Italian Professione\n\n• Audio commentary with actor Jack Nicholson (2006)\n\n• Audio commentary with screenwriter Mark Peploe and journalist Aurora Irvine (2006)\n\n• Audio commentary with film historian Adrian Martin (2018)\n\n• Jenny Runacre on The Passenger (2018, 15 mins)\n\n• Steven Berkoff on The Passenger (2018, 11 mins)\n\n• Profession Reporter (1975, 5 mins): archival interview with Michelangelo Antonioni at Cannes Film Festival\n\n• Antonioni on Cinema (1975, 5 mins): the acclaimed filmmaker on his philosophy of cinema\n\n• The Final Sequence (1985, 13 mins): Antonioni analyses the climactic sequence\n\n• Original theatrical trailer\n\n• Gallery\n\n• Collector’s booklet with a new essay by Amy Simmons\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\n1960’s Never Take Sweets from a Stranger (aka Never Take Candy from a Stranger in the US) was one of Hammer’s bravest ventures: an earnest precautionary tale with its intentions in the right place that never really got a chance on its original release. But its now ripe for rediscovery as it joins Indicator’s second volume of Hammer classics: Criminal Intent.\n\nAdapted from a 1953 play, The Pony Cart, by Roger Garris, it follows a British family settling into a small Canadian town where the father, Peter Cater (Patrick Allen) has been appointed the new school principal. When daughter Jean (Janina Faye) claims that the town’s respected patriarch, Clarence Olderberry Sr (Felix Aylmer), offered her and her friend Lucille (Frances Green) sweets in exchange to seeing them naked, Jean’s horrified mother Sally (Gwen Watford) demands an investigation. But the ensuing trial sees Jean coming under some brutal cross-examining and the elderly Olderberry being found not guilty… a verdict that results in murder!\n\nHammer’s social drama boasts great turns from Allen and Watford as the concerned parents, while Janina Faye gives a career-best performance as Jean (in a role that she also played on the West End). As the elderly paedophile, knighted stage and screen actor Felix Aylmer must be one of Hammer’s most chilling monsters (with or without makeup), and the fact he never utters a word only makes his performance all the more unnerving – as you never know what’s really going inside his sick mind.\n\nCinematographer Freddie Francis adds a touch of cinéma vérité to the nerve-wracking courtroom sequences, which were all shot in a single take at Bray Studios, and he makes atmospheric use of some of Hammer’s favourite locations – Oakley Court (standing in for a sanatorium) and Black Park, as well as Burnham Beeches and a housing estate in Slough. The suspenseful score is from idiosyncratic composer Elisabeth Luytens, while director Frankel brings a tremendous amount of suspense to the proceedings (he would later helm Hammer’s The Witches in 1966).\n\nHammer purposely plays down the sensationalism to craft an insightful message movie which explores both predatory behaviour and how power and privilege can shield dangerous people from proper justice. Applauded by critics of the day, the film was quite ground-breaking – especially as child sexual abuse was still a taboo subject. But the film was denied a certificate that would have allowed children to see it, as it was deemed too upsetting. Even the film’s star Janina Faye did not see her fine performance for many years. While promoted as a warning for parents, the film was not a commercial success and quickly disappeared – becoming one of Hammer’s most elusive titles in their back catalogue.\n\nWatching it afresh, it is a stark and impressive piece of cinema that continues to send a chill down the spine with its authentic exploration of a very real grim subject that refuses to go away. Brave, intelligent and way ahead of its time – this is Hammer at its most sincere.\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES:\n\n• HD restoration with original mono audio and new improved English subtitles.\n\n• Two presentations: Never Take Sweets from a Stranger (UK); and Never Take Candy from a Stranger (US).\n\n• New documentary: Conspiracy Theories: Inside Never Take Sweets from a Stranger (The film’s background and production are retraced by Indicator’s stable of Hammer experts, plus there’s some great archive audio interview excerpts from director Frankel).\n\n• Appreciation of Gwen Watford by British cinema expert Dr Laura Mayne.\n\n• An interview with Janina Faye, who looks back over her career with Hammer and recalls her role in the film.\n\n• The Perfect Horror Chord: David Huckvale explores composer Elisabeth Lutyens’ ‘eerie weirdy’ musical compositions for Hammer (if you are musically inclined, this is a must).\n\n• Actor and film-maker Matthew Holness explores the film’s message, intentions, cast and crew.\n\n• Trailers From Hell commentary with Brian Trenchard-Smith, who succinctly does the same.\n\n• Advertising and Publicity Gallery\n\n• Press Material\n\n• Exclusive booklet\n\nNever Take Sweets from a Stranger (1960) can be found on Indicator’s Limited Edition Box Set, Hammer Volume Two: Criminal Intent, which includes three other classic thrillers from the vaults of Hammer Films (all world Blu-ray premieres): The Snorkel (1958), The Full Treatment (1961) and Cash on Demand (1961) .\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nSave"
