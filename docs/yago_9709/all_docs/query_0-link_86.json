        "text": "Indicator prides itself in championing great British cinema and, as part of this ethos, 18 March 2019 will see the release of its first Indicator restorations. Scanned in 4K from the original negatives, the presentations of The Triple Echo and Immaculate Conception mark a new development in the Indicator range that will ensure that even more unjustly neglected gems will appear on Blu-ray for the first time ever.\n\nMarchâs selection starts with Anthony Mannâs stylish and gripping spy thriller A Dandy in Aspic (1968), starring Laurence Harvey (Room at the Top, The Manchurian Candidate) and Mia Farrow (Rosemaryâs Baby, See No Evil), and John Dexterâs screen adaptation of Leslie Thomasâ notorious The Virgin Soldiers (1969), starring two of British cinemaâs biggest stars of the time, Lynn Redgrave (Georgy Girl, The Deadly Affair) and Hywel Bennett (Twisted Nerve, Percy). Next, our first two restorations of 2019, both scanned in 4K from the original negatives: Michael Aptedâs uniquely powerful The Triple Echo (1972), starring the great Oliver Reed (The System, The Damned) and Glenda Jackson (Women in Love, Sunday Bloody Sunday), and finally Jamil Dehlaviâs sumptuous and unsettling Immaculate Conception (1992), starring Melissa Leo (21 Grams, The Fighter), James Wilby (Maurice, Gosford Park) and one of Indiaâs most celebrated stars, Shabana Azmi (Ankur, The Chess Players).\n\nMastered from the finest available materials, each of these collectable Limited Editions contains an array of new and archival extra features, English subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing, and comes packaged with a Limited Edition exclusive booklet containing newly commissioned essays, contemporary reviews, and film credits.\n\nA Dandy in Aspic (1968) | Limited Edition Blu-ray | 18 March 2018 | Â£15.99\n\nThe final film by the great Anthony Mann (Winchester '73,Â El Cid),Â A Dandy in AspicÂ is a stylish and complex cold-war thriller starring Laurence Harvey as a Russian double-agent working for British Intelligence who is assigned to track down and kill an unusual target.Â\n\nFalling between the outlandish exploits of James Bond and the dour realism of John le CarrÃ©’s ‘circus of spies’, this paranoid thriller is a dark and refined affair, with a superb supporting cast headed by Mia Farrow and Tom Courtenay (The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner,Â Otley), wonderful cinematography by regular Powell and Pressburger cameraman Christopher Challis, and with a terrific score by Quincy Jones.Â\n\nIndicator Limited Edition Blu-ray features:\n\nHigh Definition remaster\n\nOriginal mono audio\n\nAudio commentary with author and critic Samm Deighan\n\nBFI Seminar with Anthony MannÂ (1978): an archival audio recording of the great director\n\nThe BEHP Interview with Christopher ChallisÂ (1988): an archival audio recording, made as part of the British Entertainment History Project, featuring the renowned cinematographer in conversation with Kevin Gough-Yates\n\nBerlin: The Swinging CityÂ (1968): original promotional filmÂ\n\nInterview with titles designer Michael Graham-SmithÂ (2019)\n\nRichard Combs on ‘A Dandy in Aspic’(2019): a new appreciation by the renowned critic, lecturer and broadcaster\n\nTheatrical trailer\n\nImage gallery: on-set and promotional photography\n\nNew and improved English subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing\n\nLimited edition exclusive booklet with a new essay by Ian Penman, an overview of contemporary critical responses, and film credits\n\nWorld premiere on Blu-ray\n\nLimited Edition of 3,000 copies\n\nAll extras subject to change\n\nThe Virgin Soldiers (1969) | Limited Edition Blu-ray | 18 March 2019 | Â£15.99\n\nSet in Singapore in the early 1950s, this impressive adaptation of Leslie Thomas’ best-selling, scandalous novel centres on a group of naÃ¯ve, young British Army recruits billeted to Malaya who have no experience of either love or war.Â\n\nBoth affectionate and affecting in its look at young men in wartime, the film has a wonderful cast which includes Lynn Redgrave, Hywel Bennett and Nigel Davenport (The Third Secret,Â The Mind of Mr. Soames), along with early appearances from Christopher Timothy, Wayne Sleep, James Cosmo â and a young David Bowie. Genuine and heartfelt,Â The Virgin SoldiersÂ is an insightful and hugely underrated British comic drama.\n\nIndicator Limited Edition Blu-ray features:\n\nHigh Definition remaster\n\nOriginal mono audio\n\nInterview with co-screenwriter Ian La FrenaisÂ (2019)\n\nInterview with actor Roy HolderÂ (2019)\n\n16mm On-set FootageÂ (1969): rare and previously unseen material shot on location\n\nOperation MalayaÂ (1953): David MacDonald’s acclaimed feature-length docudrama on the Malayan EmergencyÂ\n\nTheatrical trailer\n\nImage gallery: on-set and promotional photography\n\nNew and improved English subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing\n\nLimited edition exclusive booklet with a new essay by author Scott Harrison, an overview of contemporary critical responses, and film credits\n\nUK premiere on Blu-ray\n\nLimited Edition of 3,000 copies\n\nAll extras subject to change\n\nThe Triple Echo (1972) | Limited Edition Blu-ray | 18 March 2018 | Â£15.99\n\nMichael Apted made his feature-film debut with this distinctive drama based on the novella of the same name by H E Bates. Reuniting Glenda Jackson with herÂ Women in LoveÂ co-star Oliver Reed, the film also stars a young Brian Deacon (Vampyres,Â A Zed & Two Noughts).\n\nWhen a young soldier (Deacon) deserts his outfit and hides in a remote farm, the farm owner (Jackson) and he fall in love. But their idyll is shattered by the arrival of a boorish, violent army sergeant (Reed) searching for his AWOL recruit.Â\n\nUnconventional and superbly played,Â The Triple EchoÂ is one of the finest British films of the 1970s. Long overlooked and unjustly neglected, this powerful drama is now ripe for rediscovery, and is presented in a brand new 2K restoration from the film’s newly rediscovered original negative.\n\nIndicator Limited Edition Blu-ray features:\n\nNew 2K restoration by Powerhouse Films from the original negative\n\nOriginal mono audio\n\nInterview with director Michael AptedÂ (2019): the award-winning filmmaker discussesÂ The Triple EchoÂ in this new and exclusive interview\n\nInterview with actor Brian DeaconÂ (2019)\n\nInterview with composer Marc WilkinsonÂ (2019)\n\nInterview with editor Barrie VinceÂ (2019)\n\nInterview with costume designer Emma PorteusÂ (2019)\n\nNeil Sinyard on ‘The Triple Echo’Â (2019): a new appreciation by the author and film historian\n\nSuper 8 version: original cut-down home-cinema presentation\n\nTheatrical trailer\n\nTeaser trailer\n\nImage gallery: on-set and promotional photography\n\nNew and improved English subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing\n\nLimited edition exclusive booklet with a new essay by Pasquale Iannone, an overview of contemporary critical responses, and film credits\n\nWorld premiere on Blu-ray\n\nLimited Edition of 3,000 copies\n\nAll extras subject to change\n\nHere's Indicator's new 2K scan of the extraordinary theatrical trailer forÂ The Triple Echo,Â created by the great Jean Fouchet:\n\nImmaculate Conception (1992) | Limited Edition Blu-ray | 18 March 2018 | Â£15.99\n\nA Western couple (played by Melissa Leo and James Wilby) working in Pakistan visit an unconventional holy shrine to harness its spiritual powers to help them conceive a child. They are lavished with the attentions of the shrine’s leader (an exceptional performance from Zia Mohyeddin âÂ Lawrence of Arabia,Â Khartoum) and her followers, but their methods and motives are not all that they seem, and the couple’s lives are plunged into darkness.\n\nThis ravishing, unsettling film from director Jamil Delhavi (The Blood of Hussain,Â Born of Fire) is a deeply personal work which raises questions of cultural and sexual identity, religious fanaticism and the abuses of power. The brand-new 2K restoration from the original negative was supervised and approved by Dehavi and cinematographer Nic Knowland.\n\nIndicator Limited Edition Blu-ray features:"
