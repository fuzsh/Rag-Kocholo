        "text": "The year 1997 marked the 50th anniversary of the creation of Pakistan. The film âJinnahâ produced by Professor Akbar S. Ahmed and directed by Mr Jamil K. Dehlavi was launched in Pakistan in the same year. The film project faced severe criticism from several quarters in Pakistan but it acted as a catalyst for establishing the Jinnah Society. It was also launched in 1997 with the object of propagating the ideals, principles and vision of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah as a nation building venture.\n\nThe Jinnah Society extended undeservedly its help and support to the Jinnah (film) Project on the assumption that the film would be good for Pakistan and also serve the purpose of propagation of the ideals, principles and vision of Mr Jinnah. Accordingly, the Jinnah Society provided a platform to mould public opinion, propagate the Jinnah (film) project which faced un-certainty and difficulty from the inception due to lack of Government patronage and withdrawal of support by PTV and fight its battles both in the public arena and in the Court.\n\nLegal Challenge to the Jinnah Film\n\nA constitutional petition filed in the High Court of Sindh at Karachi against the Producer, Director and cast of the film âJinnahâ was successfully defended by S. Sharifuddin Pirzada and Liaquat Merchant. The High Court upheld that a film was an expression of thought and ideas and was protected on the same basis as freedom of speech and expression, a fundamental right guaranteed under the Constitution of Pakistan. The petition was dismissed and the film went on to completion.\n\nPremier of the Film Jinnah"
