        "text": "Really loved the juxtaposition between the Zoroastrian funeral rite of Sagdid, in which the dog is sacred and thus its gaze drives away darkness, versus the Muslim belief of dogs driving away angelic creatures and their saliva being sacrilegious, etc. Then how the two were bridged with the killing of the dog, and its corpse subsequently being taken to be fed to the vultures.\n\nIt’s not made obvious what religious path Dehlavi’s character himself follows, having had a Muslim father and Zoroastrian mother. He appears to adopt both of them in his defiance of authority and oppression. This overcoming of evil is what binds the two traditions together for him. You hear at some parts Parsi prayers being recited, and…\n\nExtraordinary film engram on the polarity of Islam and Zoroastrianism, a man's intimacy with death and the haunting of a conflicted religious upbringing. The Zoroastrian rite of excarnation or sky burial, as also practised in Tibet, is an ecological method of purifying nature through the transposition to the aether of human remains via the 'divine ministers' of carrion birdlife after the bodies are interred in stone towers (Dakhmeh). The imprint of this process on a child, the premature death of his mother and military murder of his father, instils a tripartite fixation on decay, political dissidence and a common good in religious syncretism. In one of the most affecting sequences, in opposition to Allah's ruling that wild dogs are the…\n\nA bold and visually striking 54-minute debut from cult independent film director Jamil Dehlavi (who is perhaps best known for directing the notoriously 'out-there' horror movie Born of Fire [1987]). As would continue to be the case in several of Dehlavi's later films, Towers of Silence draws on elements of Islamic mysticism and Zoroastrian tradition to conjure up a wealth of impressionistic, hallucinatory images. Quite what the director intended by these images may seem impenetrably obscure at times, but they remain striking nonetheless.\n\nThe storytelling takes a poetically fluid approach to time and space, with past, present and future seeming to co-exist all at once. Though there is certainly a narrative at play here, it would be misleading to describe…\n\nI’m tempted to give Towers of Silence an extra 1/2 star because of its importance to Pakistani cinema, but Dehlavi’s style is inflected with so many decadent Western cliches that it might feel like an ethnographic interpretation of its culture if it wasn’t so surrealistically structured and irreverently shot (the latter trait of which is observed unevenly). The film lucidly shifts between three parallel narratives that house each other, where at the core we see the story of a child obsessed with death rituals, over that the tale of a Zoroastrian woman who engages in a possibly Oedipal relationship with a young man, and insulating both is an account of a female author in the creative process of writing a book.…\n\nJamil Dehlavi is a London-based independent film director, son of a French mother and a Pakistani diplomat (who has travelled to the capitals of Europe) and studied at the best schools in America. Probably why his debut film is so boldly visionary is that it freely draws on the full range of modernist tools, from surrealism to expressionist montage, standing at the crossroads of cultures. This 'Gothic, dreamlike montage of ancient burial rituals shot in Karachi and New York', as I read, was inspired by an uncle who was married to the daughter of a Zoroastrian high priest. It's no wonder that Western, Indo-Iranian, and Islamic mysticism and mythology blend so richly, creating this unique visual world. The opening sequence…\n\nI don't usually give plot synopsis for shorts so I'll jump right on to just talking about the movie.\n\nThis is Jamil Dehlavi's student film from the beginning of his career.\n\nAlready you can see sort of the ending of Blood of Hussain in there somewhere.\n\nCruel authority is shown here in the form of those cops or soldiers? Makes sense to consider the context of the time this short was released, when Pakistan was under a dictatorship.\n\nIts also quite clearly about life and death.\n\nThere are images of the moon, a woman, a egg laying turtle, seems a good fit to connect those as shoe ins of femininity which represent life, same with the baby.\n\nThe dog's death…"
