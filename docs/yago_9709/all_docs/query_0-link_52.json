        "text": "The Blood of Hussain (Blu-Ray+DVD)\n\nBeschrijving\n\nThe Blood of Hussain (3-disc DVD + Blu-ray set)\n\nDirected by Jamil Dehlavi\n\nPolitical, subversive and artistically maverick, Pakistan's leading filmmaker Jamil Dehlavi's remarkable body of work stands out for its originality and engagement with social and political questions. He is an artist whose vision captures the diversity and power of both the religious and the secular in everyday life\n\nIn The Blood of Hussain (1980), the annual mourning procession for the murdered Hussain, grandson of the prophet Muhammad, is the setting for an allegorical tale of revolutionary struggle against injustice and oppression. Banned by successive military regimes in Pakistan, the film has achieved legendary status in its country of origin.\n\nThis release includes Dehlavi's landmark 1975 Towers of Silence, which weaves scenes of Zoroastrian funerary rituals in which bodies are consumed by vultures with glimpses of armed insurrection, juxtaposing traumatic landscapes of sex, death and faith.\n\nSpecial features\n\nBrand new masters of both films presented in High Definition and Standard Definition\n\nBetween the Sacred and the Profane (2018, 66 mins): Dr Ali Nobil Ahmad explores the cultural, artistic, and political background of Jamil Dehlavi's films\n\nJamil Dehlavi in Conversation (2018, 76 mins): an on-stage conversation between the director and curator Timothy Cooper.\n\nIllustrated booklet with a new essay by Raficq Abdulla, writing by M J Fischer and full film credits\n\nUK, Pakistan | 1980, 1975 | colour, black and white | 106 minutes, 51 minutes | English and Urdu language, with optional English subtitles and English hard-of-hearing subtitles | original aspect ratio 1.66:1, 1 33:1 | BD50: 1080p, 24fps, PCM 1.0 mono audio (48kHz/24-bit), region B | 2 x DVD9: PAL, 25fps, Dolby Digital 1.0 mono audio (48kHz/16-bit), region 2\n\nRegisseur: Jamil Dehlavi\n\nCast: Salmaan Peerzada, Kika Markham, Durriya Kazi, Kabuli Baba, Mirza Ghazanfar Begg, Fauzia Zareen\n\nOndertiteling: Engels\n\nVoorraad\n\nJA"
