        "text": "In Pakistan, independent filmmakers face limited opportunities to showcase their films. However, they have discovered a platform for their work on international stages. At the Red Sea International Film Festival 2023, held in Jeddah, two Pakistani feature films and two shorts were included in the competition category. These films garnered positive feedback from both the jury and the audience, highlighting the talent and creativity of Pakistani filmmakers.\n\nPakistani films garnered significant attention at the Red Sea International Film Festival, showcasing notable works such as “In Flames” directed by Zarrar Kahn, “Wakhri – One of a Kind” by Iram Parveen Bilal, and two shorts titled “Solitia” and “Eid Mubarak” directed by Hira Yousafzai and Mahnoor Euceph respectively.\n\nThe presence of the South Asian, particularly Pakistani, diaspora in Jeddah was evident as they eagerly lined up to watch these films from their homeland and have the opportunity to meet the stars. This sight is reminiscent of the enthusiastic crowds typically seen at film festivals in the Western world.\n\nDuring a conversation with Ramesha Nawal, the star of “In Flames,” after the award ceremony, she expressed her surprise at winning the prestigious Best Feature Film award, the highest honor at the Red Sea festival. “Although we believed in the potential of our film, we were up against such strong competition that it was a challenging race. When our names were announced, we all leaped from our seats and erupted in screams of joy,” she shared.\n\nThe screening of the film at Red Sea was an unforgettable experience for her, and she expressed some apprehension about how the Saudi Arabian audience would react to the film. However, she was pleased to see a large number of people attending the screening. “Even after the screening, we felt the warmth of the audience. They kept coming to us and called us Mariam and Asad, which are our character names.”\n\nVersion 1: The film screening at Red Sea was a remarkable experience for her, and she was a bit nervous about how the Saudi Arabian audience would receive it. Nonetheless, she was delighted to see a significant turnout. “Even after the screening, we felt the warmth of the audience. They kept coming to us and called us Mariam and Asad, which are our character names.”\n\nWhen asked about the audience’s reception of Solatia at the Red Sea International Film Festival (RSIFF), Hira Yousafzai expressed her overwhelming gratitude for the positive response. Despite the sold-out tickets and the disappointment of those who couldn’t attend, Yousafzai found the reception to be deeply moving and was thankful for the opportunity to share her work with a diverse audience.\n\nShe emphasized that these moments of connection between the audience and the film serve as inspiration for filmmakers to continue creating stories that not only touch hearts but also ignite meaningful conversations. Yousafzai also mentioned the encouraging recognition from acclaimed filmmaker Baz Luhrmann, who acknowledged the progress of Pakistani films and even gave Solatia a shoutout. She expressed her appreciation for his support and eagerly looks forward to embarking on her filmmaking journey.\n\nMahnoor Euceph’s film, Eid Mubarak, has been gaining recognition at various film festivals. When asked about her experience at the Red Sea festival, she expressed her gratitude towards the festival’s team for going above and beyond to tailor the experience for each filmmaker. As a filmmaker herself, she felt well taken care of and appreciated the opportunity to meet talented individuals from different Muslim countries.\n\nShe also mentioned that the festival provided a warm and welcoming atmosphere, allowing everyone to connect and get to know each other. There was a significant presence of Pakistani filmmakers at the festival, which created a sense of unity and camaraderie among them.\n\nDuring a conversation with Lebanese journalist Riya Abirached, Baz Luhrman, the head of the festival’s jury, acknowledged the emergence of amazing movies from Pakistan. He hinted that something special is happening in the Pakistani film industry, in response to a query from Hira Farooqi, the producer of Solitia.\n\nThe year 2023 has proven to be a remarkable year for Pakistani films. “In Flames” premiered at the Directors’ Fortnight section of the Festival De Cannes, marking the first Pakistani film to be featured in this section in 43 years since “The Blood of Hussain” by Jamil Dehlavi. Additionally, “In Flames” was selected as Pakistan’s official entry for the 96th Academy Awards."
