        "text": "THE BLOOD OF HUSSAIN\n\nUK/Pakistan, 1981, 112 minutes, Colour.\n\nSaalman Perzeda, Kika Markham, Durriya Kazi.\n\nDirected by Jamil Dehlavi.\n\nThe Blood of Hussain is a Pakistani film, completed in England. The filming was completed during 1977, just before the military coup. The director escaped from Pakistan and completed his film in Great Britain. This gives the film political and historical interest.\n\nThe plot echoes Pakistani situations and is an interesting reflection on Pakistan in the 70s. The film focuses on Hussain, a hero figure, who has within him the spirit of a great 17th century martyr who was grandson of Mohamed. The film highlights the place of Islamic beliefs and zeal in Pakistan. The contrast is with Hussain's brother, married to a westerner who is unfaithful to him and who has, a business mission to Washington. The film contrasts the two brothers, the one dealing in compromise, the other a leader of his people, rallying the people together, dying heroically in battle against the army.\n\nThe film works well on a realistic level but is given a symbolic framework with a sequence at beginning and end as a white stallion seems to rise out of the ground.\n\n1.
