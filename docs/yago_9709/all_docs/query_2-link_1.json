It was directed by Jamil Dehlavi, and written by Akbar S. Ahmed and Jamil Dehlavi. It stars Christopher Lee in the lead role as Jinnah.[5]\n\nTo make this film, Shashi Kapoor wanted to invest $1 million.[6] Shashi Kapoor was the victim of controversy from India and Pakistan for acting in the film.[7] It was shown in Mill Valley Film Festival on 15 October 1999.[8] The director of the film accused Akbar Ahmed of embezzling money from the film. Former Channel 4 executive Farrukh Dhondy also helped write the screenplay for the film for £12,000.[9]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film opens with the words of Professor Stanley Wolpert:\n\nFew individuals significantly alter the course of history.\n\nFewer still modify the map of the world.\n\nHardly anyone can be credited with creating a nation-state.\n\nMuhammad Ali Jinnah did all three.\n\nA Guide takes Jinnah to 1947 where, at the Cromwell Conference with Lord Mountbatten, Jinnah demands a homeland for Indian Muslims.\n\nIn flashbacks, the Guide recounts the marital life of Jinnah, when he falls in love and marries a Parsi named Rattanbai Petit, nicknamed Ruttie, later known against the will of her parents, mainly on grounds of religion and the difference in their ages. In 1922, Jinnah faces political isolation as he devotes every spare moment to be the voice of moderation in a nation torn by Hindu-Muslim antipathy. This creates tension between Rattanbai and Jinnah. She finally leaves him with their daughter, and they eventually separate. The subsequent death of Rattanbai from cancer greatly impacts Jinnah and his fight for Pakistan. He returns to British India to start a political journey of the two-nation theory. At the Muslim League annual conference in 1940, Jinnah addresses thousands of Muslims and gives them the assurance of the birth of Pakistan.\n\nThe Guide questions Jinnah as to who he loves the most apart from Ruttie and his sister Fatima. He then mentions his daughter, who married a Parsi boy without his permission.\n\nWhile addressing a Muslim League conference in 1947, Muslims fanatics attack the conference and argue that if Pakistan is to be a Muslim state, it cannot give equal rights to women and non-Muslims. Jinnah replies that Islam doesn't need fanatics but people with vision who can build the country. However, the partition of India is carried out, and the Guide and Jinnah witness the massacre of Muslims in migration done by Hindus and Sikhs. Jinnah is sworn in as the first Governor-General of Pakistan and announces Liaquat Ali Khan as the first Prime Minister of Pakistan. Jinnah then says goodbye to his daughter. Dina promises that she will visit him but stays behind in Bombay with her husband and child.\n\nAfter independence and the end of British rule, Pakistan stands as a new nation and sanctuary for the Muslims of the subcontinent. Jinnah is given the title of Quaid-e-Azam of Pakistan. Jinnah waits for the first train carrying Muslims who left India for Pakistan, but when the train arrives, they are all found dead save for one infant child. Fatimah and Lady Edwina Mountbatten visit refugees and Lady Mountbatten learns the importance of independence. Mountbatten betrays Jinnah as the Hindu Maharaja of Kashmir, Sir Hari Singh, stalls his decision on which nation to join. With the population in revolt in October 1947, aided by Pakistani irregulars, the Maharaja accedes to India; Indian troops are airlifted in. Jinnah objects to that and orders that Pakistani troops move into Kashmir, which leads to a war between India and Pakistan then and afterward from time to time in the Kashmir conflict.\n\nThe film jumps into a final scene showing Jinnah and Lord Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma (last Viceroy of India) in a Heavenly Court. Jinnah is fighting a case against him over his betrayal. The film ends with Jinnah and his angel judge traveling back in time to the scene of Muslim refugees. Jinnah expresses his sorrow over the plight of the refugees during the division of Punjab. They chant \"Pakistan Zindabad\" in response, which ends the film.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nSoundtrack\n\n[edit]\n\nJinnahSoundtrack album by\n\nNigel Clarke and Michael Csányi-Wills\n\nCritical reception\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film received an overwhelmingly positive response in Pakistan. Christopher Lee spoke highly of the film, calling his performance in it the best of his career as well as stressing the importance of the film.[14][15]\n\nThe most important film I made, in terms of its subject and the great responsibility I had as an actor was a film I did about the founder of Pakistan, called Jinnah. It had the best reviews I've ever had in my entire career—as a film and as a performance. But ultimately it was never shown at the cinemas.\n\nHowever, the choice of Lee to play the lead role led to a large amount of media controversy in Pakistan because of his previous roles in horror films and vampire films as Count Dracula, with Lee having received death threats which required personal bodyguards during filming. The BBC reported that the threats were due to his previous film roles and not that he was a European playing an Asian.[10] Some critics even demanded a ban on the film.[16]\n\nInternational awards\n\n[edit]\n\nGrand Prize - Zanzibar International Film Festival[12]\n\nBest International Film - World Film Awards, Indonesia[12][17]\n\nGold Award Best Foreign Film - Worldfest Flagstaff[17]\n\nSilver Award, 1999 - WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival[18][12]\n\nGolden Pyramid Award Nomination - Cairo International Film Festival[12][17]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of Islamic films\n\nCinema in Pakistan\n\nList of Asian historical drama films\n\nList of artistic depictions of Mahatma Gandhi\n\nList of artistic depictions of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nJinnah at IMDb\n\nJinnah at AllMovie\n\nChristopher Lee on the making of legends and Jinnah\n\nChristopher Lee launches film about Jinnah in London (Asians in Media Magazine) Archived 17 July 2012 at the Wayback Machine\n\nFilm reviews\n\n[edit]"
