        "text": "Introduction:\n\nJinnah is a 1998 epic film the only movie based on the life of the great leader and founder of Pakistan, Mohammad Ali Jinnah. This film describes some of the different parts of his life and consists of some of the main events which took place in the life of Mohammad Ali Jinnah, such as his life as an advocate, his marriage, his illness and problems that he faced during the struggle for independence. This film was directed by Jamil Dehlavi and was written by Akbar S. Ahmed which was released in 1998 in the United Kingdom and Pakistan.\n\nThe summary:\n\nThe film opens with the words of Professor Stanley Wolpert:\n\n“Few individuals significantly alter the course of history.\n\nFewer still modify the map of the world.\n\nHardly anyone can be credited with creating a nation-state.\n\nMohammad Ali Jinnah did all three”\n\nThe film starts with the death …show more content…\n\nAs expected Jinnah wins the case. Here comes the last part of the movie in which Quaid-e-Azam finally sees his people happy for getting independence.\n\nThe movie ends by telling about the death of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah on the night of 11 September 1948.\n\nMy Opinion:\n\nI must say this is one of the best movies I have ever seen, the movie was outstanding and it was brilliantly written and directed it was worth watching and it increased my knowledge to some extent.\n\nBut I would also like to add a downside of the movie, which is the fictional Jinnah shown in much parts of the movie makes the movie give a non-serious picture most specifically when the young Jinnah meets the old Jinnah in his home’s lawn.\n\nOther than that I find the movie perfect, as unfortunately we have forgotten the sacrifices made for our homeland Pakistan I consider this movie as also a great reminder of the sacrifices made by the people of our country and how our great leader wanted Pakistan to"
