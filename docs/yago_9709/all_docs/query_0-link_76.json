        "text": "Organizers of the worldâs longest running South Asian film festival have revealed the final line up of films and, the stars who will grace the red carpet in London with Bollywood stars Poonam Dhillon and Rajkumar Rao among those attending the 25thÂ anniversary edition of the UK Asian Film Festival.\n\nDhillon and Rao will be in conversation at the Closing Gala of the festival on 14 May at BFI Southbank â part of the Festivalâs Closing Event which will also featureÂ a special centenary celebration screening ofÂ A Meeting Of Cultures,Â a heritage film told through the eyes of BA2 dance students from Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance.Â It marks the centenary of the start of the iconic collaboration between Prima Ballerina, Anna Pavlova, and renowned Indian dancer, Uday Shankar, from their first performance at Royal Opera House in 1923.\n\nOn the same day, actor,Â Jassa Ahluwalia, will also host theÂ UK Asian Film Festival 2023 Awards.\n\nAlso in conversation at UK Asian Film Festival Closing Gala will beÂ Jamil Dehlavi, celebrated independent film director and producer whose notable films include the JinnahÂ (1998) and the Cannes-feted The Blood of Hussain (1980).\n\nThe Festival will open on 4 May at BFI Southbank with the UK Premier of Sanaa.Â Directed by Sudhanshu SariaÂ the film stars Radhika Madan and tells the story of the challenges faced by women in the Indian corporate environment.\n\nThe screening will be followed by a Q&A with Madan moderated by Smita Tharoor.\n\nTheÂ Closing FilmÂ onÂ Saturday 13thÂ May will be âBhagwan Bharoseâ, Director Shiladtiya Boraâs thoughtful exploration of the rising tide of Hindu nationalism in 1980âs India, told through the eyes of two village boys struggling with their understanding of God and religion.\n\nThe screening at Londonâs Kilm Theatre will be followed by a Q&A with actorsÂ Vinay Pathak, Masumeh Makhija andÂ Satendra Soni and directorÂ Shiladitya Bora moderated by BBC Radio 4 announcer Viji Alles.\n\nAmong the other highlights of the Festival is the UK PremiereÂ ofÂ Kamli, the latest offering from Sarmad Khoosat, one of Pakistanâs most provocative auteurs.Â Starring Saba Qamar and Nimra Bucha,Â theÂ film portrays a woman’s struggle between her sense of loyalty to her missing husband and her personal desires.\n\nAs part of the festivalâs LGBTQ strand, theÂ Festival will host the UK PremiereÂ ofÂ Trans Kashmir, S. A. Hanan and Surbhi Dewanâs intimate portrait of the unique culture, resilience and beauty of transgender women in Kashmir.\n\nAs it marks its 25thÂ Anniversary Tongues on Fire UKAFF will once again spread its wings right across the UK, taking South Asian cinema to all four corners of the country with screenings and events planned in London, Leicester, Manchester and Glasgow.\n\nOver the past quarter century,Â the festival has been a force in championingÂ South Asian female-centric cinema and celebrating women in film â both behind and in front of the camera.\n\nA festival helmed by women and feminist allies, its programmes have annually sought to disrupt the patriarchal status quo and initiate challenging conversations in its mission to advocate and promote gender equality in cinema.\n\nTheÂ âCelebrating Our StoriesâÂ theme of the festivalâs silver jubilee year will present a curation of film stories centring on the British Asian experience â redefining and reimagining oneâs roots and dreams in a foreign land â and will celebrate the individuality and uniqueness of trans generational, South Asian migrant stories.\n\nâWhen we set up Tongues on Fire,Â we wanted to create aÂ platform for thought provoking stories that stimulate meaningful conversations, unpack uncomfortable truths and challenge the patriarchyâ, said the Festivalâs Founder, Dr Pushpinder Chowdhry MBE.\n\nShe adds: âWe remain true to our roots with a power packed programme celebrating our stories through excellent films, masterclasses, in conversations, live events and more!â"
