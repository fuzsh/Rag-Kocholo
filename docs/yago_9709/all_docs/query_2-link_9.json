        "text": "A Jewish American journalist is held hostage by Muslim fundamentalists in Karachi against the release of prisoners in Guantanamo bay.\n\nWritten, Produced & Directed by Jamil Dehlavi\n\nStarring\n\nKevin Collins • Raza Jaffrey • Jennifer Calvert • Constantine Gregory\n\nAWARDS\n\nFipresci International Critics Prize\n\nBest Feature Film : European Independent Film Festival, Paris\n\nGrand Prize : Florence River to River Film Festival, Italy\n\nSpecial Jury Award : Worldfest, Houston\n\nPrix de la Critique : Amiens International Film Festival\n\nBest Supporting Actor : KaraFilm Festival, Pakistan\n\nOFFICIAL SELECTION\n\nDinard • Bradford • Hyderabad • Lisbon • Mumbai • Nantes\n\nREVIEWS\n\nIn the wake of the impressive, multi-layered yet near-impenetrable Syriana comes Infinite Justice, a bold, confrontational and far more accessible consideration of the ‘war on terror’ and the mechanics of the political world that pulls the strings of the opposing elements at the heart of the fray. An edgy and unsettling thriller, it is loosely based on months leading to the death of the American Jewish journalist Daniel Pearl, who was investigating links between Pakistan, Al Qaeda and the 9/11 attacks on America when he was kidnapped by Islamic fundamentalists in 2002. He was later beheaded with the hideous act caught on camera. Kevin Collins plays Jewish reporter Arnold Silverman, a bullish young man with a touch of the crusader about him who sets out to unravel the Gordian knot of intrigue and conspiracy that led to the destruction of the World Trade Center and the deaths of thousands of people. One of them was his sister. His terrier-like digging unearths several links – between radicalised young British Muslims and firebrand speakers in the States, between the 9/11 terrorists and Pakistan, and between enigmatic homeland security personnel and other, sinister, freelance agents. One of them is Abe Kautsky (Constantine Gregory), a mystery man who seems to know all the answers to all Silverman’s questions. His journey eventually leads to Karachi and to a far more complex web of relationships and understandings than even he suspected. Jamil Dehlavi’s uncompromising film strikes at the very heart of the international stand-off between West and East and postulates whether professional observers such as Pearl are merely puppets in a wider conspiracy controlled not by governments or idealists but by shadowy middle-men with their own murky agendas. This is a potent brew. At no point does Dehlavi allow himself to take sides, instead presenting his tale from multiple viewpoints and suggesting a very different scenario to the ‘official’ version of Pearl’s death. Infinite Justice – the title is taken from the name of the USA’s operation to topple the Taliban in Afghanistan - is a hard-hitting but always intelligent contemplation on American world policy and the reaction to it by the Muslim world. Always challenging and occasionally shocking, its closing moments deliver a sledgehammer punch unequalled by recent political dramas and hints at the inner strength of a filmmaker unencumbered by the concept of fear.’\n\nImage & IMAX\n\nBritish Pakistani director Jamil Dehlavi is best known for chronicling Pakistani anomie in films such as The Blood of Hussain (an allegorical tale about dictatorship, 1981) and Immaculate Conception (a scathing indictment of modern-day Pakistan vis-à-vis British social mores, 1992). In 1998 he turned to Pakistani history with Jinnah, a biopic steeped in metaphor about the founder of Pakistan. Never one to shy away from controversy, Dehlavi now trains his sights on unravelling the financial network behind 9/11, using the Daniel Pearl case as a peg to hang his story on. While A Mighty Heart focused on Mariane Pearl’s journey to trace her husband’s whereabouts, Dehlavi employs a Syriana-esque structure and seamlessly moves back and forth in time and place while detailing the story of fictional Jewish American broadcast journalist Arnold Silverman, who launches an investigation into the events behind the World Trade Center tragedy. Silverman has a personal stake as he’s lost his sister in the calamity. In time-honoured political-thriller mode, Dehlavi ratchets up the tension as we follow Silverman from New York to London to Karachi. Using a quasi- documentary approach, the director interweaves memorable news footage with Silverman’s dramatic and event-filled quest for the murky truth. Dehlavi doesn’t point fingers or pronounce judgement on any organisation or country. He does, however, create a shadowy American figure, Abraham Kautsky, who seems equally in cahoots with the American and Pakistani governments and underground terrorist organisations. What elevates Infinite Justice above the ordinary is Dehlavi’s narration of the journey of two extremely intelligent and educated British Pakistani youths — Waqar Islam and Kamal Khan—from regular Britons to radical Islamists. As the film unfolds, Dehlavi cuts back repeatedly to Islam and Khan, and we see the genesis of their transformation—the posh British school where they are denied the right to Muslim prayer, the inevitable racist attacks by lager louts, their indoctrination at a London mosque, and finally a Taliban bootcamp on the Afghan/Pakistan border. The director also returns time and again to an ongoing chess match between Silverman and Khan when the journalist is held hostage in Pakistan. In the course of their conversations, Khan the lucid abductor and Silverman the rational journalist capture the essence of the west-versus-fundamentalism discussion. This leads to the gradual creation of a Stockholm Syndrome scenario that ends in a truly horrifying bloodbath.\n\nSight & Sound\n\nThe film is a fast aced ‘A sprawling, complex, masterful take on the Daniel Pearl case. After losing his sister in 9/11, broadcast journalist Arnold Silverman attempts to unravel the events behind the tragedy, winding up kidnapped in Pakistan for asking one question too many. Deftly shifting Syriana-style between continents and timeframes, the film also takes a dispassionate look at the radicalisation of educated British Muslim youth. Dehlavi juxtaposes news footage with stunning, sometimes grisly imagery, creating a mood of palpable danger. But the heart of the film is the verbal sparring and extended chess match between Silverman and his captor Kamal Khan, neatly encapsulating the ongoing debate about terrorism and its causes.’\n\nTOTAL FILM\n\n‘A fast-moving political thriller. Technically impressive.’\n\nThe Guardian\n\n‘An interesting contribution to the post 9/11 movies. Serious and decent-minded.’\n\nThe Observer\n\n‘There’s an ambitious sweep to Infinite Justice. Dehlavi moves confidently between time-frames and countries.’\n\nBBC\n\n‘Shot on location in London, New York and Karachi, Infinite Justice uses an impressively broad canvas to paint a picture of dangerous fundamentalism and western opportunism.’\n\nSky Movies\n\n‘A very good political thriller, directly inspired by the story of the journalist Daniel Pearl, abducted and murdered by Islamic terrorists.’\n\nLe Monde\n\n‘Explosive filmmaking. Not to be missed.’\n\nLe Courrier Picard"
