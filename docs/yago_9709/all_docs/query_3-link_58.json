        "text": "REVIEWS\n\nGodforsaken is a clever and complex story that feeds the audience a little bit at a time until it all comes together at the end. Director, Jamil Dehlavi who also co-wrote the script, did a fantastic job at keeping the story moving at a nice pace while jumping between all the different places and characters. This is a thinking man’s film that is both unique and different. It’s a story you can’t take your eyes off of and the film keeps you wanting more and more. I was impressed with Annabel Wright who plays dual roles in the film as its lead and Nick Ashdon as The Angel. If you’re looking for a film that is both intelligent and entertaining, then I highly recommend picking this one up. It will have you captivated right from the start and it will keep you engaged to the very end.\n\nVideo Views"
