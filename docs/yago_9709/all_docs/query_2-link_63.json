        "text": "SOME of the most enduring images of decolonization in the popular imagination of Americans have come from films. Some of these films are of average quality and imperfect in their historical accuracy, but many are excellent and effectively recreate the environment and compelling issues that men and women faced at different moments in the history of decolonzation. And since films are the media through which many Americans gain their impressions of the historical, political, and cultural legacies of decolonization, they are worthy of consideration by historians for that reason alone.\n\nBelow is a selection of films useful for complementing our study of decolonization. Most of these films are available on DVD or Blu-Ray at Watzek Library. You can also find many of them on streaming services. In addition to this list, Colonial Film: Moving Images of the British Empire holds detailed information on over 6000 films showing images of life in the British colonies. Over 150 films are available for viewing online.\n\nSome information courtesy of Internet Movie Database. Used with permission\n\nEARTH\n\nDirector: Deepa Mehta, 1998\n\nThe movie opens in the city of Lahore in Punjab in 1947 before India and Pakistan became independent. Lahore is a cosmopolitan city, depicted by a group of working class friends from different religions. The rest of the movie chronicles the fate of this group and the maddening religious conflict that sweeps across Punjab as the partition of the two countries is decided and Lahore is given to Pakistan. Based on the 1988 semi-autobiographical novel The Ice Candy Man by Bapsi Sidhwa.\n\n© New Yorker Films\n\nVICEROY'S HOUSE\n\nDirector: Director: Gurinder Chadha, 2017\n\nThe transfer of power and partition of India and Pakistan told largely through the experiences of the house staff at the stately New Delhi residence of the viceroy following the arrival of Lord and Lady Mountbatten in early 1947. As the clock ticks down to independence, the servants must prepare for an uncertain future for themselves and their families. The film had been lambasted by historians for the unsupported premise that partition was conceived as conspiracy by Churchill's wartime government to contain postwar Soviet expansion into the oil-rich Middle East.\n\n© Pathé\n\nEXODUS\n\nDirector: Otto Preminger, 1960\n\nThis Hollywood epic portrays the last days of the British mandate of Palestine and the birth of the state of Israel. The plot revolves around a group of Jewish war survivors whose refugee ship, Exodus, is diverted from Cyprus to Haifa. There they join a kibbutz and must reconcile themselves to their Arab neighbors as well as the more militant Jewish fighters. Meanwhile British authorities struggle to keep order and prepare to partition the country and withdraw. Based on the bestselling 1958 novel by Leon Uris.\n\n© MGM/UA\n\nO JERUSALEM\n\nDirector: Elie Chouraqui, 2006\n\nThis film revolves around the friendship between two men, an Arab and a Jew, during the final days of Britain's Palestine mandate and leading up to the birth of the state of Israel. As British authorities in the mandate lose the will to stay and keep order Jews and Arabs fight for control of the holy city and to determine the fate of the region. Based on the bestselling 1972 book by Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre.\n\n© Les Films de l'Instant\n\nCOTTON MARY\n\nDirectors: Ismail Merchant and Madhur Jaffrey, 1999\n\nIn 1954, seven years after India has gained independence from Britain, many Indians still feel like second-class citizens in their own country, as the nation's sovereignty has not immediately erased the perception that the British are superior to Indians. An example is Cotton Mary, an Anglo-Indian nurse in the employment of the wife of a BBC correspondent. Mary claims she is the daughter of a British army officer (although she has no firm evidence) and views herself as more British than Indian.\n\n© Universal\n\nSOMETHING OF VALUE\n\nDirector: Richard Brooks, 1957\n\nPeter, a Kenya settler boy, and Kimani, a Kikuyu, are childhood friends. After his father is jailed for following tribal customs, Kimani joins the Mau Mau rebellion. Kimani believes in the cause, but does not agree with the indiscriminate killing of women, children, and those who will not join or support the rebels. Peter, even after the deaths of his little sister and brother by the Mau Mau, still believes that there is a chance for peaceful co-existence. Based on the 1955 novel by Robert C. Ruark.\n\n© MGM\n\nTHE KITCHEN TOTO\n\nDirector: Harry Hook, 1988\n\nMwangi is a Kikuyu boy whose preacher father is murdered by Mau Mau revolutionaries in 1950. Soon afterward he goes to work as a house servant for a colonial police officer, his wife, and young son. When the revolutionaries kidnap Mwangi and make him swear allegiance to their cause, a potentially explosive situation arises. A gripping story about one of the bloodiest episodes in the history of British decolonization and the birth of modern Kenya.\n\n© Warner Home Video\n\nGUNS AT BATASI\n\nDirector: John Guillermin, 1964\n\nRegimental Sergeant-Major Lauderdale is an old-school martinet assigned with other British NCOs and officers to a remote African outpost to train soldiers of a newly independent former colony (a thinly veiled Kenya). When a populist uprising overthrows the government, soldiers loyal to the new regime take over the barracks prompting a tense standoff with Lauderdale and his men. Released in 1964, at the height of decolonization, this film is a useful artifact of British feelings about the end of their empire.\n\n© Twentieth Century Fox\n\nSTAYING ON\n\nDirector: Silvio Narizzano, 1979\n\nBased on Paul Scott's Booker Prize-winning novel from 1977, this film tells the story of retired colonel Tusker Smalley and his wife Lucy who made the decision to \"stay on\" in India after the British withdrew in 1947 and as most of their friends returned home. Now retired, Tusker and Lucy are the only remaining British residents in a once-busy hill station. Problems arise when the Indian owner of their bungalow plans to change the one corner of India in which they hoped to preserve their Anglo-Indian life.\n\n© HBO Films\n\nTHE LAST POST\n\nDirectors: Miranda Bowen and Jonny Campbell, 2017\n\nIn 1965, a detachment of the Royal Military Police keep an uneasy peace in the colony of Aden, an important military and naval outpost in Britain's declining postwar empire. This television series follows the professional and personal lives of the RMP men and their families as pan-Arab nationalists take up arms against British rule. The Aden Emergency resulted in the withdrawal of British forces at the end of 1967 followed by the independence of Yemen.\n\n© BBC\n\nTHE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND\n\nDirector: Kevin Macdonald, 2006\n\nNine years after Uganda gained its independence from Britain in 1962, a former private in the King's African Rifles named Idi Amin seized power. This film is a fictionalized version of the reign of Amin as seen through the eyes of Nicholas Garrigan, a young Scottish doctor who quite accidentally becomes the dictator's personal physician. A chilling portrait of Amin's erratic and murderous regime as well as the trauma of postcolonial Africa in the wake of British rule. Based on the 1998 novel by Giles Foden.\n\n© Fox Searchlight\n\nCRY FREEDOM\n\nDirector: Richard Attenborough, 1987\n\nIn the 1970s Donald Woods, chief editor of the liberal South African newspaper Daily Dispatch, writes several editorials critical of the banned anti-apartheid activist Steven Biko, but after meeting him he changes his views. The two meet several times and soon Woods and his family come under surveillance from the security police. When Biko dies in police custody Woods writes an exposé about Biko's death and government torture. This results in his being banned and fleeing South Africa.\n\n© Universal Pictures\n\nGOODBYE BAFANA\n\nDirector: Bille August, 2007\n\nThis film offers an inside look at part of the 27-year incarceration of ANC leader Nelson Mandela in the prison on Robben Island through the eyes of prison guard James Gregory. Gregory and his family moved to the island in 1968 and, because he spoke Xhosa, his superiors charged him with censoring correspondence and supervising visits between Mandela and his wife, Winnie. The film is based on Gregory's controversial 1995 memoir which has been challenged by some Mandela biographers.\n\n© Image Entertainment\n\nBOPHA!\n\nDirector: Morgan Freeman, 1993\n\nIn the 1980s Micah Mangena is a black sergeant in the South African police assigned to help keep order inside the township in which he and his family live. An honest and well-intentioned man, Mangena believes his job is the best way to serve his community but he is aware that many of his neighbors and his own teenaged son, Zweli, see him as an enabler of apartheid and the pawn of a racist government. Adapted from the 1986 play by Percy Mtwa.\n\n© Paramount"
