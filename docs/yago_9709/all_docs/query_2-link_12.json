        "meta_description": "Biography of Mohammed Ali Jinnah, the founder of modern Pakistan is told through flashbacks as his soul tries to find eternal rest. The flashbacks start in 1947 as Jinnah pleads for a separate nation for the Muslim minority, infuriating Lord Mountbatten. Mountbatten then tries to enlist Gandhi & Nehru to persuade Jinnah to stop his efforts. Gandhi sides with Jinnah, which upsets Nehru. However, Jinnah turns down the offer to become prime minister and the film takes another slide back to 1916, which reveals all of the political implications that have occurred.",

        "text": "Christopher Lee was certainly a larger-than-life personality. He narrowly dodged death in World War II. He briefly courted Swedish royalty. He claimed descendance from Emperor Barbarossa (as well as distant relation to Ian Fleming, John Lee, and Robert E. Lee). He lent his voice to a string of heavy metal albums. He also stood 6'5\", dressed impeccably, and possessed an intensely commanding Basso Profundo.\n\nAs an actor, Lee was among the first great franchise actors, and certainly one of the most resilient. Lee first truly asserted himself as an actor in the Hammer Horror films, starring memorably as Dracula. After gracing a litany of such films, he diversified into roles such as Rochefort in The Three Musketeers, and Bond Villain…\n\nThere are some actors so gifted, that despite having rich careers, they never get a role truly worthy of their talents. As fond as I am of Christopher Lee's Drive Bee wit matching nefarious deeds in The Stupids (1996) - Jinnah represents a genuine challenge for the seasoned star. The actor has frequently spoken about this take on Pakistan's founder, as his finest performance, and despite some local pushback related to his blood drinking typecast, delivers a thoughtful, complex, nuanced, and memorable take on Muhammed Ali Jinnah - which functions as a respectful counterpoint to the less than historically accurate version of the man seen in Richard Attenborough's Gandhi (1982). A number of legal issues relegated this to the festival…\n\nrancid, a film about Jinnah told through memories as he sees them where he is the sole force of dignity, played by not just one but 2 different white men, the partition of india remains an atrocity today, the direct precedent of the atrocities committed against the ppl of Jammu and Kashmir, the people of Bangladesh, crimes against Muslims and Hindus and Christians and Sikhs in both Pakistan and India, and all we can remember is how pretty the glint of sunshine looks as educated desis go and court british women, but theres still something here, the picking and choosing when to embrace a 2 nation theory and when to look towards the intertwined desi society, the glint of light…\n\nFrom his turbulent life outside cinema to the wide range of roles he inhabited in films, Christopher Lee is undoubtedly one of the most interesting figures in all of cinema. While he had an illustrious career, his choice for the best performance of his own career is one that has been in relative obscurity. The role in question is Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the Quaid-e-Azam of Pakistan.\n\nJinnah is a very unorthodox biopic. From its bizarre \"A Christmas Carol/It's a Wonderful Life\" style structure where Jinnah evaluates his entire life and the effects he had on various people with the Shashi Kapoor character as a guide who is credited simply as \"narrator.\" This unique structure gave Dehlavi the freedom to bounce…\n\nrather wary of the film right from the get-go, for pop culture simply doesn't know how to portray jinnah, often painting him as merely a petty man. though i see why: jinnah wasn't an easy character to understand, often cryptic in mannerisms and speech.\n\nworries only grew when the film tried to embark from his afterlife, debating whether he should be whisked away to the doors of heaven or dragged down the depths of hell. i was afraid it might get too campy for a man like jinnah, though i found it very well done.\n\nchristopher lee was phenomenal in this. i found him perfect. how do you make a man so boring come to life on screen? he manages…\n\nChristopher Lee cited his performance in the title role of this biopic of barrister-turned-politician and Pakistan founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah as the best and most important work of his career, but it's a film that's been notoriously difficult to see over the last 25 years. Unseen in America until it aired on TCM in October 2016 when Lee was their \"Star of the Month,\" this 1998 Pakistan/UK co-production gave Lee his largest late-career role in a prestige period project that can be seen as a counterpoint of sorts to Richard Attenborough's GANDHI (Jinnah was played in that film by Alyque Padamsee). It hits the expected biopic bullet points, but suffers from a hokey structure that's equal parts A CHRISTMAS CAROL…\n\nIn what Christopher Lee not only called one of his most important roles of his long and storied career, but also called the Pakistan media slandering coverage of the film, \"sloppy journalism\" for the News International calling his casting in a negative connotation with \"Dracula cast as the father of the nation\" as a headline. JINNAH (1998) is a film that should be celebrated for the historical aspects of the birth of Pakistan and the life of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of the country, who believed that the Muslims of the subcontinent should have their own state to avoid the possible marginalised status they may gain in an independent Hindu–Muslim state in the post-WWII British relinquished colonial India.…\n\nI will leave the decision on whether it was appropriate for Christopher Lee to play Muhammad Ali Jinnah for greater minds, other than to say that Lee's performance is pretty perceptive, and completely respectful. Though, the darkened skin tone that Lee requires, achieved through make-up, is as uncomfortable as you'd expect.\n\nIf anything the film is too respectful, as a riposte to Richard Attenborough's Gandhi, it takes a look at Jinnah, in soft-focus cinematography, and tries to skirt around most of the difficult issues. I know that it is quite popular to criticise Gandhi (the film) these days, but that is a much superior and impressive work.\n\nWhat you have with Jinnah is a bizarre framing device that occasionally drifts…\n\nAn admirable attempt to give substance to a character who was short shrifted as largely an antagonist in Gandhi, and to attempt to give a bit more depth to the start of the partition which was handled by a hard-cut in Gandhi. Admirable, though not entirely successful. Aspects of it unfortunately do feel like \"discount store Gandhi\" in terms of production values, the direction and especially the performance of Gandhi. If Gandhi struggled to include every bit of history involved from Gandhi life in over three years, this feel really struggles to include it in less than two hours. All of which it attempts through a questionable framing device of a deceased Jinnah attempting to explain his actions to court…"
