        "text": "Jamil Dehlavi is an independent filmmaker of Pakistani and French origin, whose groundbreaking work has been praised by critics and screened at film festivals around the globe and has won several awards. Dehlavi’s biopic Jinnah (1998), which tells the dramatic story of the partition of India and the birth of Pakistan has gone on to receive the Grand Prize at the Festival of the Dhow Countries, Best International Film at the World Film Awards in Indonesia, the Gold Award at Worldfest Flagstaff, Best Foreign Film at Houston, and was nominated for a Golden Pyramid at the Cairo International Film Festival.\n\nNow reports suggest that the director, writer and producer, who has popular films such as Immaculate Conception, a short thriller Blood Money, Infinite Justice besides Jinnah to his credit, is gearing up for his next yet to be titled feature length film.\n\nHaving earned recognition all over the world, Jamil Dehlavi is now working on his upcoming feature film, which according to Entertainment Pakistan will be shot in Pakistan.\n\nThe online portal also stated that the filmmaker is currently in Pakistan and that the film’s script has been completed. Moreover, Dehlavi is busy considering his casting options for his forthcoming film, which is slated to go on floors in March 2020.\n\nWith unique filmography that largely deals with issues plaguing a modern Islamic society as well as highlighting the South Asian socio-political dynamics, let’s wait and see what Dehlavi delivers."
