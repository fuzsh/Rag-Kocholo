        "text": "Written and directed by Pakistani-born film-maker Jamil Dehlavi, Infinite Justice is an interesting addition to the current spate of films addressing the ongoing 'war on terror.' Inspired by the kidnapping and murder of the US journalist Daniel Pearl, which was also the subject of Michael Winterbottom's A Mighty Heart, this proficient thriller explores the doomed encounter in Karachi between a Jewish American financial reporter (Kevin Collins) and a British Muslim (Raza Jaffrey), belonging to a fundamentalist organisation.\n\nThere's an ambitious sweep to Infinite Justice, which begins in the autumn of 2001 after the terrorist attacks on America. Arnold Silverman (Collins) is dealing with the trauma of losing his sister in the World Trade Centre, and is investigating how Al-Qaeda could have financed such a complex operation. Ignoring the advice of the sinister government operative Abe Kautsky (Constantine Gregory), he travels to Pakistan and arranges a meeting with Universal Sharia Movement member Kamal (Jaffrey). In flashbacks we discover that the latter was radicalised by his experiences of growing up in England during the 1980 and 1990s, and had volunteered alongside a childhood friend for the Muslim cause in the Bosnian war.\n\n\"COMPETENT RATHER THAN COMPELLING\"\n\nShooting on digital video, Dehlavi moves confidently between the different time-frames and countries. There is, however, a schematic dimension to the screenplay, with individual characters representing a particular political perspective, and the performances are competent rather than compelling. Yet in these troubled times it's hard not to agree with Kamal's impassioned assertion that, \"If you want to make peace, don't talk to your friends, talk to your enemies.\"\n\nInfinite Justice is out in the UK on 30th November 2007."
