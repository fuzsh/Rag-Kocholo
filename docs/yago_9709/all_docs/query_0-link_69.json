        "text": "KARACHI: As Pakistani horror film 'In Flames' becomes the second one from the country in 43 years to head to the Directors’ Fortnight, an event that runs parallel to the prestigious Cannes Film Festival, its lead actress Bakhtawar Mazhar described the development as a “great moment for Pakistani cinema”.\n\nWritten and directed by award-winning Canadian-Pakistani filmmaker Zarrar Kahn, In Flames is the second Pakistani film to make it to the Quinzaine des Cineastes (Directors’ Fortnight), an independent selection launched in 1969 that runs parallel to Festival de Cannes (Cannes Film Festival) in France.\n\nThe first from the South Asian country to achieve the feat was Jamil Dehlavi’s ‘The Blood of Hussain’ which was screened at Cannes under the same segment in 1980\n\n“I feel nervous for tomorrow but at the same time, I am so excited and so proud to be one of the very few artists to have made it to the Cannes,” Mazhar told Arab News from Cannes. “It’s a great moment for Pakistani cinema.”\n\nIn Flames is one of the 20 feature films and 10 short features that will run at the Quinzaine des Cineastes. It is overseen by French Directors’ Guild. The film will have its world premiere at Cannes on Friday, May 19.\n\nIt explores the struggles of a Pakistani mother and her daughter who try to survive in a Pakistani patriarchal society. “A lot of it is about the daughter’s dilemma and the daughter’s traumas,” Mazhar said. She plays the mother.\n\nThe film was shot in Karachi in early 2022. Interestingly, Mazhar will be watching the film for the first time herself at the Cannes screening.\n\nThe actress lauded the film’s inclusion in the Directors’ Fortnight, saying that it is a prestigious sidebar at the Cannes Festival.\n\n“People actually look up to the Directors’ Fortnight for meaningful stuff. There are different genres and different stories. Films are chosen and selected by a whole panel to be a part of this,\" Mazhar said.\n\n\"They must have judged the film on so many tiny things because every year they get hundreds of entries from all over the world.”\n\nThe event kicked off on May 16 and will run till May 27. In Flames will have its press screening on May 19, followed by a question-and-answer session. According to Mazhar, the film will have a little red carpet event, followed by its world premiere the same night. The film also has multiple screenings lined up on May 20.\n\nIn Flames marks Mazhar’s feature film debut, with the actress calling it a “huge honor” for the film to have made it to Cannes. She started her acting career with theatre in Pakistan almost two decades ago. One of her most recent works in theater included legendary actor and TV broadcaster Zia Mohyeddin’s adaptation of 'Romeo And Juliet'.\n\nISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s health ministry confirmed a second case of mpox on Friday in a man who had traveled to the South Asian nation from a Gulf nation and was screened at an airport.\n\nThe World Health Organization last week declared a global health emergency over the spread of a new mutated strain of mpox named clade I. Pakistani health officials confirmed the first mpox case on Aug. 15 but said it was of an older, milder variant called clade II. Clade I has triggered global concern because it seems to spread more easily through routine close contact. The emergence of the new strain has been linked to a growing outbreak in Africa.\n\n“A second case of mpox has been reported in Pakistan,” the health ministry said on Friday. “A person traveling back from a Gulf country tested positive with symptoms.”\n\nA health desk established at Peshawar Airport in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province had transferred the patient to a hospital after he tested positive during an airport screening, the health ministry said.\n\nHealth Coordinator Dr. Mukhtar Ahmed said the ministry was continuously monitoring the situation and had an “effective system” of screening and surveillance at all airports.\n\nPakistani authorities said on Thursday they had placed airports on alert and strengthened screening systems at various entry points out of the country.\n\nThe mpox virus is primarily found in Central and West Africa, where it is transmitted from animals such as rodents and primates to humans. Human-to-human transmission can occur through direct contact with body fluids, respiratory droplets or contaminated materials like bedding. The disease is characterized by fever, swollen lymph nodes and a distinctive rash.\n\nISLAMABAD: A spokesperson for the National Assembly of Pakistan said this week parliament would deploy rat traps and had allocated a budget and begun digitizing its archives to protect important official documents from rats that had overrun the building.\n\nThe latest rat problem at the National Assembly building came to light after an official committee recently asked to see the records of meetings from 2008, which were found to have been badly gnawed by rats. The pests had also caused damage to CCTV and Internet cables and usually appeared at night when the building was vacant.\n\nAuthorities subsequently allocated Rs1.2 million ($4,320) to combat the problem and published newspaper advertisements to identify pest control companies, receiving interest from two firms.\n\n“To safeguard records, the National Assembly has initiated the digitization of its archives,” Zafar Sultan, the director general of media at the assembly, told Arab News, saying the rat infestation was a years-long problem.\n\n“A tender [for pest companies] is floated every year, this year’s tender was awarded in July,” he added. “The National Assembly administration contacted the Capital Development Authority (CDA), which is responsible for providing services in the Parliament.”\n\nSultan confirmed that a budget of Rs1.2 million had been allocated for removing rats from the building and a two-person team would handle the task using bait-fillefd rat-catching nets.\n\nEarlier this week, Sultan told the BBC the rats were “so huge that even cats might be afraid of them.” He said most of the rats could be found on the first floor, which houses the building’s food hall as well as the office of the senate opposition leader. Most meetings of political parties and standing committees also take place here.\n\n“When there are usually no people here in the evening, the rats run around in there like it’s a marathon,” the BBC quoted Sultan as saying. “The staff posted there are now used to this, but if someone comes here for the first time, they get scared.”\n\nPakistani TV channel Geo News reported that the Capital Development Authority was mulling employing hunting cats to catch rats in parliament.\n\nISLAMABAD: Pakistan has sent a C-130 aircraft to bring back bodies of 28 pilgrims who were killed in a bus crash in Iran this week, the Pakistani information ministry said on Friday.\n\nThe bus carrying Shiite pilgrims from Pakistan to Iraq crashed on Tuesday night in the central Iranian province of Yazd, according to Pakistani and Iranian authorities.\n\nAnother 23 people suffered injuries in the crash that happened on their way to Iraq, with more than a dozen of the injured pilgrims in serious condition.\n\n“A special C-130 aircraft of the Pakistan Air Force has been sent to Iran to bring back dead bodies of Pakistani pilgrims,” the information ministry said in a statement on Friday afternoon.\n\n“The dead bodies of Pakistani pilgrims will be brought back from Iran today (Friday).”\n\nA majority of the deceased Pakistani pilgrims belonged to the Larkana district in Pakistan’s Sindh province, according to the statement. Pakistan’s ambassador to Iran had recommended sending bodies of Pakistani pilgrims by air due to the long distance between Yazd and Larkana, in view of hot weather.\n\nPakistan’s ambassador to Iran, Mudassir Tipu, said they had completed arrangements for the repatriation of bodies and some of the injured persons.\n\n“Mission is most grateful to Pakistan and Iran for utmost cooperation dealing with tragic situation,” he said on X.\n\nThere were 51 people on board at the time of the crash outside of the city of Taft, some 500 kilometers (310 miles) southeast of the Iranian capital, Tehran. The pilgrims had been on their way to Iraq to commemorate Arbaeen.\n\nMillions of Shiite Muslims are currently partaking in the Arbaeen pilgrimage in Iraq’s Karbala Governorate, which marks the 40th mourning day following the martyrdom of Imam Hussain (RA), a central figure in Shiite Islam and the grandson of Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him).\n\nIran has one of the world’s worst traffic safety records with some 17,000 deaths annually. The grave toll is blamed on wide disregard for traffic laws, unsafe vehicles and inadequate emergency services in its vast rural areas.\n\nIranian state television has blamed Tuesday’s crash on the bus brakes failing and a lack of attention by its driver.\n\nLAHORE: A court in Pakistan on Thursday allowed investigators to question a man in their custody for four more days about his role in spreading misinformation that sparked widespread rioting in the UK earlier this month, officials said.\n\nThe court’s decision came a day after authorities charged the suspect Farhan Asif, 32, with cyber terrorism following his arrest from his home in Lahore, the capital of eastern Punjab province.\n\nAsif, who is a freelance web developer, was produced before the court amid tight security. He was not allowed to talk to the media.\n\nKiran Muqeem, a prosecutor for the Federal Investigation Agency, told the court that Asif did not cooperate with officers after the same court the previous day allowed them to question him for a day. They demanded his custody for two weeks but the court said it would only allow it for four more days.\n\nMuqeem later told reporters that Asif disseminated fake news and caused riots in England.\n\nAsif was handcuffed and wearing blue shalwar kameez garments when brought to the court.\n\nHis lawyer Rana Rizwan told reporters that the court remanded his client into the custody of the federal agency in a hurry and without hearing him.\n\n“We were informed by the court that the case of Asif would be taken up after lunch break. But the court took up the matter before the lunch break, and allowed FIA to keep him in their custody,” Rizwan said.\n\nAsif is accused of spreading misinformation from YouTube and Facebook about the British teenage suspect in a stabbing attack that killed three girls and injured 10 other people on July 29 at a dance class in Northwest England.\n\nThe false information claimed that the suspect was a recently arrived asylum-seeker and had a name that suggested he was Muslim. After the misinformation led to a violent mob attacking a mosque near the site of the stabbing the next day, police took the unusual step of clarifying that the suspect was born in the UK.\n\nBritish media has widely reported that his parents are from Rwanda and are said to have Christian beliefs.\n\nChannel3 Now, an account on the X social media platform that purports to be a news channel, was one of the first outlets to report the false name, Ali Al-Shakati.\n\nA Facebook account for the channel said it is managed by people in Pakistan and the US. But, officials say Asif was solely running the Channel3 Now, and he spread misinformation to gain more viewers.\n\nRAWALPINDI: Bangladesh opener Shadman Islam hit a fighting half-century on Friday to lead his team to 134-2 at lunch on the third day of the first Test against Pakistan in Rawalpindi.\n\nThe 29-year-old left-hander was unbeaten 53 with senior batter Mominul Haque 45 not out as the duo defied Pakistan’s pace attack on a Rawalpindi stadium pitch that has slowed down considerably.\n\nThe visitors still trail Pakistan’s first innings total of 448-6 by 314 runs with eight wickets intact.\n\nShadman pulled pacer Naseem Shah’s last delivery before the interval for his sixth boundary to reach a third Test half-century, extending the unbroken third wicket stand with Haque to 81.\n\nThe stand led the recovery after Pakistan removed Zakir Hasan (12) and skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto (16) in the extended three-hour session due to Friday prayers.\n\nHaque has also batted with confidence, having hit four boundaries.\n\nPakistan employed all four pacers but are missing the services of a frontline spinner.\n\nPart-time slow bowler Agha Salman has made little impact in his eight overs so far.\n\nResuming at 27-0, Bangladesh lost Zakir to a smart catch by wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan, diving to his left to take a one-handed catch in Naseem Shah’s fifth over of the day.\n\nShanto looked good during his short knock but was bowled between bat and pad by Khurram Shahzad, leaving the visitors on 53-2."
