        "text": "'Utopia' Extends Run\n\nThe run of Tom Stoppard's \"Coast of Utopia\" at the Vivian Beaumont Theater in Lincoln Center has been extended by nine weeks, through May 13, including six Saturdays when all three of its parts -- \"Voyage,\" \"Shipwreck\" and \"Salvage\" -- will be performed. The dates of those marathons are March 24 and 31; April 7, 21 and 28; and May 5. Tickets for the extension go on sale tomorrow.\n\nBritish Report Lets Clock Keep Running on Rock\n\nAging British rockers and record labels seeking an extension of Britain's 50-year limit on sound recordings and performers' rights were rebuffed yesterday in a review commissioned by the government. The recommendation, part of a 146-page reconsideration of intellectual property laws, said: \"The ideal IP system creates incentives for innovation, without unduly limiting access for consumers and follow-on innovators. It must strike the right balance in a rapidly changing world so that innovators can see further by standing on the shoulders of giants.\" The copyright recommendation means that the Beatles' catalog, including early hits like \"Love Me Do\" and \"I Want to Hold Your Hand,\" could be up for grabs in 2012 and 2013, Reuters reported. The government review also said that consumers should be allowed legally to transfer music they buy in CD format to MP3 players, and it called for measures to crack down on piracy and counterfeiting."
