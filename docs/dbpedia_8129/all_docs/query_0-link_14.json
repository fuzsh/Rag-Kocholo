        "text": "Overview[]\n\nThe Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (1917-1922) was a communist one-party state in Europe and Asia. The Russian SFSR was by far the largest SSR and richest SSR out of all the SSR's. It is the political descendent of Bolshevik Russia. It had an official United Nations seat and was home to the Soviet Union's capital, Moscow.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (Russian SFSR or RSFSR; Russian: Российская Советская Федеративная Социалистическая Республика, tr. Rossiyskaya Sovetskaya Federativnaya Sotsialisticheskaya Respublika), also unofficially known as the Russian Federation, Red Russia, Soviet Russia or Russia (/ˈrʌʃə/ (About this sound listen); Russian: Росси́я, tr. Rossija; IPA: [rɐˈsʲijə]; from the Greek: Ρωσία — Rus'), was an independent state from 1917 to 1922, and afterwards the largest, most populous, and most economically developed union republic of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1991 and then a sovereign part of the Soviet Union with priority of Russian laws over Union-level legislation in 1990–91. The Republic comprised sixteen autonomous republics, five autonomous oblasts, ten autonomous okrugs, six krais, and forty oblasts. Russians formed the largest ethnic group. The capital of the Russian SFSR was Moscow and the other major urban centers included Leningrad, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.\n\nThe Battle of Prokhorovka was fought on 12 July 1943, and The Battle of Kursk of 5 July 1943 – 23 August 1943 occurred on it's territory in WW2.\n\nAutonomous Republics within the Russian SFSR[]\n\nTurkestan ASSR – Formed on April 30, 1918, on the territory of the former Turkestan General-Governorate. As part of the delimitation programme of Soviet Central Asia, the Turkestan ASSR along with the Khorezm SSR and the Bukharan PSR were disbanded on October 27, 1924, and in their place came the Union republics of Turkmen SSR and Uzbek SSR. The latter contained the Tajik ASSR until December 1929 when it too became a full Union republic, the Tajik SSR. The RSFSR retained the newly formed Kara-Kirghiz and the Kara-Kalpak Autonomous Oblasts. The latter was part of the Kirgiz, then the Kazak ASSR until 1930, when it was directly subordinated to Moscow.\n\nBashkir ASSR – Formed on March 23, 1919 from several northern districts of the Orenburg Guberniya populated by Bashkirs.
