See here transliteration details).\n\nName (English): Tuva • (Russian, short form): Тува | Tuva • (Russian, long form): Республика Тыва | Respublika Tyva • (local, short form): Танну Тува | Tannu Tuva\n\nLocal official language: Tuvian\n\nCapital: Кызыл | Kyzyl\n\nArea: 170 500 km2 (~65 800 sq.mi.) • Population: 311 200 inhabitants in 2000\n\nStatus: Republic (Республика | Respublika) within the Russian Federation\n\nFederal District: Siberia • Economic region: East Siberia\n\nLicense plate code: 17 • Ham radio code: TU • ISO 3166-2 code: TY\n\nFlag adopted on 1992.09.17 • Coat of arms adopted on 1992.09.17\n\nTuva broke away from Mongolia in 1921, and retained its independence until incorporation into the USSR in 1944. In 1961, it became an ASSR. In 1992, a new flag of light blue, yellow and white was adopted.\n\nStuart Notholt, 25 Nov 1995\n\nTuva is currently an autonomous republic of Russia, but was previously independent. The area is near the border between Siberia and Mongolia, and is also claimed by China (I think that Taiwan even has a representative in their legislature for Tuva, or at least they used to).\n\nAnnie Platoff\n\nTuva borders Mongolia to the south and has a short border with Buryatia to the east. Tuvinian is a Turkic language and is most closely related to Uighur, spoken in the Chinese region of Sinkiang.\n\nVincent Morley, 19 Nov 1997\n\nDescription and meaning of the flag\n\nThe original Tuvan flag adopted in 1918 was also blue, yellow and white. Today, the colours are said to represent courage and strength in blue, prosperity in yellow and purity in white.\n\nVincent Morely, 19 Aug 1997, quoting [rya97]\n\nPresent flag of Tuva was designed by Oyun-ool Sat 18 September 1992. White suggests silver (clean thoughts) and the silver streamers draped over a hostess’ arms as she greets guests. Yellow suggests gold (riches) as well as Buddhism. Light blue suggests the courage and firmness of the nomadic herdsmen (and the big blue Tuvan sky!). The stripes represent the confluence of the Bii-Khem and Kaa-Khem rivers at Kyzyl, where they form the Ulug-Khem (Yenisei).\n\nDave Martucci 15 Mar 1998, quoting Kerry Yackoboski\n\nThe Pantone colours proposed by The Flag cabinet (Jiri Tenora, Berlin) are: B- (PMS 285), Y (PMS 116).\n\nPascal Vagnat, 03 May 1998\n\nJiri Tenora’s proposal for the blue is too dark. The many photographs we have show a lighter shade: PMS 292 or even 291 is more correct. (The picture above shows the colors very good).\n\nRalf Stelter, 27 Jun 1999\n\nThe legislation about the State flag of the Republic of Tuva, of 17 September 1992 was superseded by the Law About the State symbols of the Republic of Tuva No. 697 of 31 December 1996 (Chapter III devoted to the flag), with no changes in the description or measures. The Law About the State flag of the Republic of Tuva No. 1302 of 8 February 2002 establishes new proportions 2:3, remaining the construction details untouched. This Law abolished Chapter III of the previous Law of 1996.\n\nAntonio Gutierrez, 25 Jun 2006\n\nPrevious version\n\nimage by Vincent Morley, 19 Nov 1997\n\nIncorrect design reported\n\nimage by Vincent Morley and António Martins, 12 Apr 2000\n\nThis (in medium blue) flag is listed under number 122 at the chart Flags of Aspirant Peoples [eba94] as: \"Tuva Ulus (Tuvinian Mongols) - South Siberia\". Similar to the real flag, but no white stripe between the yellow triangle and the blue field.\n\nIvan Sache, 15 Sep 1999\n\nI wander if the missing white stripe is simply an error or if it has a meaning as a variation of the Tuvan flag — for what is worth, \"Tuvinian Mongols\" are simply Tuvans (or Tuvinian).\n\nAntónio Martins, 16 Sep 1999\n\nCoat of arms\n\nimage by Eric Slone\n\nThis emblem is remarkably similar to the one on the 1933-1941 flag.\n\nAntónio Martins, 15 Feb 2000\n\nHistorical Flags of Tuva"
