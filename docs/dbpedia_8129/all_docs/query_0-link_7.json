Originally, each autonomous entity was dealt on a case by case basis. At the end of the Civil War in 1920, there were four Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republics. The Russian constitutions of 1925 and 1937 merely referred to the Autonomous Republics without defining their status, however the Autonomous Republics in their constitutions of 1937 were for the first time described as states. According to the Russian constitution of 1978, the Autonomous Republics, defined as states, made up the federation together with the Russian S.F.S.R. itself.\n\nAll autonomous republics that existed after 1920 are recorded below. By 1980, the Russian S.F.S.R. was divided into 87 entities (15 autonomous soviet socialist republics, 6 kraya, 49 oblasti, 2 cities of republican subordination, 5 autonomous oblasti, and 10 autonomous okruga). Until 1991, almost all leaders were members of the Communist Party so their party affiliations are generally not noted below. Non-Russian names of entities below are given in attempted transliteration of modern Cyrillic orthography of respective language. For the kraya, oblasti, cities of republican subordination, autonomous oblasti and autonomous okruga see RSFSR Admin. divisions Page 2 (from 25 Dec 1991 see Russia Administrative Divisions).\n\nParty abbreviations: DR = Demokraticheskaya Rossiya (Democratic Russia, electoral bloc, 1990-2000); KPSS = Kommunisticheskaya Partiya Sovetskogo Soyuza (Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Marxist-Leninist communist, USSR state party to 13 Mar 1990, former VKP, 13 Oct 1952 - 29 Aug 1991); KPR = Kommunisticheskaya Partiya Rossiyskoy SFSR (Communist Party of the Russian SFSR, split from KPSS, 19 Jun 1990 - 6 Nov 1991; from 14 Feb 1993 Kommunisticheskaya Partiya Rossiyskoy Federatsii);\n\n- Former parties: KPKF = Kommunisticheskaya Partiya Karelo-Finskoy S.S.R./Karjalais-Suomalaisen Sosialistisen Neuvostotasavallan Kommunistinen Puolue (Communist Party of the Karelo-Finnish S.S.R., former KPKF-B, 13 Oct 1952 - 25 Jul 1956, re-incorporated into VKP); KPKF-B = Kommunisticheskaya Partiya (Bol'shevikov) Karelo-Finskoy S.S.R./Karjalais-Suomalaisen Sosialistisen Neuvostotasavallan Kommunistinen Puolue (Bolevikit)(Communist Party [Bolsheviks] of the Karelo-Finnish S.S.R., separated from VKP, 27 Apr 1940-13 Oct 1952, renamed KPKF);NSPKB = Natsional-Sotsialisticheskaya Partiya Severokavkazskikh Brat'yev (National-Socialist Party of North Caucasian Brothers, militant Chechen nationalist, anti-communist, 28 Jan 1942-1942);PSR = Partiya Sotsialistov-Revolyutsionerov (Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries, \"SRs\", democratic socialist, agrarian socialist, split Aug 1917 into Left and Right wings, 1902-1922);RKP = Rossiyskaya Kommunisticheskaya Partiya (Bol'shevikov)(Russian Communist Party [Bolsheviks], Marxist-Leninist communist, state party, former RSDRP-B, 8 Mar 1918-31 Dec 1925, renamed VKP);VKP = Vsesoyuznaya Kommunisticheskaya Partiya (Bol'shevikov)(All-Union Communist Party [Bolsheviks], Marxist-Leninist communist, USSR state party, former RKP, 31 Dec 1925-13 Oct 1952, renamed KPSS)\n\nkraya, oblasti, autonomous oblasti and autonomous okruga: see part 2\n\nAutonomous Soviet Socialist Republics Bashkir\n\nc.1926 - c.1930 Possible\n\nc.1930 Possible\n\nc.1930 - c.1935 Possible\n\n11 Oct 1924 - c.1926\n\n23 Jun 1937 - 9 Feb 1938\n\n9 Feb 1938 - 1947\n\n1947 - 31 Mar 1954\n\nAdopted 31 Mar 1954\n\n23 Mar 1919 Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Republic (Bashkort Avtonomiyaly\n\nSovet Respublikasy/Avtonomnaya Bashkirskaya Sovetskaya\n\nRespublika), created from the former Bashkir Government, within\n\nthe Russian S.F.S.R.\n\nApr 1919 - Aug 1919 Bashkir areas occupied by the \"White\" Russian troops,\n\nSoviet Bashkir authorities go into exile in Saransk.\n\n15 Sep 1919 Boundaries established, definite separation from the Orenburg\n\nand Ufa governorates.\n\n25 Jul 1920 Renamed Bashkir Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic (Bashkort\n\nAvtonomiyaly Sotsialistik Sovet Respublikasy/Bashkirskaya\n\nAvtonomnaya Sotsialisticheskaya Sovetskaya Respublika),\n\nwithin the Russian S.F.S.R.\n\n14 Jun 1922 Ufa governorate incorporated.\n\n5 Dec 1936 Renamed Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Bashkort\n\nAvtonomiyaly Sovet Sotsialistik Respublikasy/Bashkirskaya\n\nAvtonomnaya Sovetskaya Sotsialisticheskaya Respublika),\n\nwithin the Russian S.F.S.R.\n\n11 Oct 1990 Declaration of state sovereignty (Bashkir Soviet Socialist Republic\n\n[Bashkort Sovet Sotsialistik Respublikahy/Bashkirskaya Sovetskaya\n\nSotsialisticheskaya Respublika]).\n\n25 Feb 1992 Republic of Bashkortostan (Bashkortostan Respublikaһy/Respublika\n\nBashkortostan).\n\nChairmen of the Bashkir Regional Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)\n\n18 Nov 1919 - 20 Jan 1920 Kharis Yumagulovich Yumagulov (b. 1891 - d. 1937)\n\n20 Jan 1920 - Mar 1920 ....
