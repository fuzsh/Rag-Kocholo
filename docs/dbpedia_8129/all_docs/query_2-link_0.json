        "text": "Type of administrative division of the Soviet Union\n\nAn Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR, Russian: автономная советская социалистическая республика, АССР, romanized: avtonomnaya sovetskaya sotsialisticheskaya respublika) was a type of administrative unit in the Soviet Union (USSR), created for certain ethnic groups to be the titular nations of. The ASSRs had a status lower than the constituent union republics of the USSR, but higher than the autonomous oblasts and the autonomous okrugs.\n\nIn the Russian SFSR, for example, Chairmen of the Government of the ASSRs were officially members of the Government of the RSFSR. Unlike the union republics, the autonomous republics only had the right to disaffiliate themselves from the Union when the union republic containing them did so, as well as to choose to stay with the Union separately from them. The level of political, administrative and cultural autonomy they enjoyed varied with time—it was most substantial in the 1920s (Korenizatsiya), the 1950s after the death of Joseph Stalin, and in the Brezhnev Era.[1]\n\nAccording to the constitution of the USSR, in case of a union republic voting on leaving the Soviet Union, autonomous republics, autonomous oblasts and autonomous okrugs had the right, by means of a referendum, to independently resolve whether they will stay in the USSR or leave with the seceding union republic, as well as to raise the issue of their state-legal status.[2]\n\nAzerbaijan SSR\n\n[edit]\n\nNakhichevan ASSR, now Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic\n\nGeorgian SSR\n\n[edit]\n\nAbkhaz ASSR, now Abkhazia\n\nAdjarian ASSR, now Adjara\n\nRussian SFSR\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 1978 Constitution of the RSFSR recognized sixteen autonomous republics within the RSFSR. Their status as of October 2007 within the Russian Federation is given in parentheses:\n\nBashkir ASSR (now Republic of Bashkortostan)\n\nBuryat ASSR (now Republic of Buryatia)\n\nChecheno-Ingush ASSR (now Chechen Republic and Republic of Ingushetia)\n\nChuvash ASSR (now Chuvash Republic)\n\nDagestan ASSR (now Republic of Dagestan)\n\nKabardino-Balkarian ASSR (now Kabardino-Balkarian Republic)\n\nKalmyk ASSR (now Republic of Kalmykia)\n\nKarelian ASSR (now Republic of Karelia)\n\nKomi ASSR (now Komi Republic)\n\nMari ASSR (now Mari El Republic)\n\nMordovian ASSR (now Republic of Mordovia)\n\nNorth Ossetian ASSR (now Republic of North Ossetia–Alania)\n\nTatar ASSR (now Republic of Tatarstan)\n\nTuvan ASSR (now Tuva Republic)\n\nUdmurt ASSR (now Udmurt Republic)\n\nYakut ASSR (now Sakha (Yakutia) Republic)\n\nGorno-Altai Autonomous Oblast (now Altai Republic), Adyghe Autonomous Oblast (now Republic of Adygea), Karachay–Cherkess Autonomous Oblast (now Karachay–Cherkess Republic) and Khakassian Autonomous Oblast (now Republic of Khakassia) were all promoted in status to that of an ASSR in 1991, in the last year of the Soviet Union. Only the Jewish Autonomous Oblast retained its autonomous oblast status in Russia.\n\nOther autonomous republics also existed within RSFSR at earlier points of the Soviet history:\n\nCrimean ASSR (October 18, 1921 – June 30, 1945; now the Republic of Crimea, disputed between Russia and Ukraine)\n\nKazakh ASSR (1925–1936, now the independent state of Kazakhstan)\n\nKirghiz ASSR (1920–1925, became Kazak ASSR, now the independent state of Kazakhstan)\n\nKirghiz ASSR (1926–1936, became Kirghiz SSR, now the independent state of Kyrgyzstan)\n\nMountain ASSR (1922–1924, broken up into several smaller Northern Caucasus Republics)\n\nTurkestan ASSR (1918–1924, now part of the independent states of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan)\n\nVolga German ASSR (1918–1941, divided between Saratov Oblast and Stalingrad Oblast)\n\nUkrainian SSR\n\n[edit]\n\nMoldavian ASSR (1924–1940). In 1940, it was made, together with territory annexed from Romania, into the Moldavian SSR (now the independent state of Moldova, however, de facto, a bit of the right bank and the city of Bendery are controlled by Transnistria).\n\nCrimean ASSR (February 12, 1991 – 1992). Crimea Oblast was promoted to the ASSR status following a referendum held on January 20, 1991 (now the Autonomous Republic of Crimea / Republic of Crimea, territory disputed between Ukraine and the Russian Federation)\n\nUzbek SSR\n\n[edit]\n\nKarakalpak ASSR (1932–1991), now Karakalpakstan\n\nTajik ASSR (1924–1929, became Tajik SSR, now the independent state of Tajikistan)\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nAutonomous oblasts of the Soviet Union\n\nAutonomous okrugs of the Soviet Union\n\nNational delimitation in the Soviet Union\n\nRepublics of Russia\n\nSubdivisions of the Soviet Union\n\nAutonomous regions of China"
