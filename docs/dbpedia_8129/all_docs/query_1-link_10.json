Tsar Nicholas II ordered Russian troops into Tuva in 1912, as Russian settlers were allegedly being attacked. Tuva became nominally independent as the Urjanchai Republic before being brought under Russian protectorate as the Uryankhay Kray on 17 April 1914. It was then part of the Yeniseysk Governorate. This move was requested by a number of prominent Tuvans, including the High Lama. A Tuvan capital was established, called Belotsarsk (Белоца́рск; literally, \"Town of White Tsar\"). Meanwhile, in 1911, Mongolia became independent, though under Russian protection.\n\nFollowing the Russian Revolution of 1917 which ended the Tsar's rule, most of Tuva was occupied from 5 July 1918 to 15 July 1919 by Aleksandr Kolchak's \"White\" Russian troops. Pyotr Ivanovich Turchaninov was named governor of the territory. In the autumn of 1918 the southwestern part was occupied by Chinese troops and the southern part by Mongol troops led by Khatanbaatar Magsarjav.\n\nIndependence\n\nFrom July 1919 to February 1920 the communist Red Army controlled Tuva, but from 19 February 1920 to June 1921 it was occupied by China under governor Yan Shichao. On 14 August 1921 the Bolsheviks (supported by Russia) established a Tuvan People's Republic, popularly called Tannu-Tuva. In 1926, the capital (Belotsarsk; Khem-Beldyr since 1918) was renamed Kyzyl, meaning \"Red\". Tuva was an independent state between the World Wars.\n\nThe state's first ruler, Prime Minister Donduk, sought to strengthen ties with Mongolia and establish Buddhism as the state religion. This unsettled the Kremlin, which orchestrated a coup carried out in 1929 by five young Tuvan graduates of Moscow's Communist University of the Toilers of the East. In 1930 the pro-Soviet government began to reform the writing system, first replacing Mongol script with a Latin script, then adopting a Cyrillic script in 1943. Under the leadership of Party Secretary Salchak Toka, ethnic Russians were granted full citizenship rights and Buddhist and Mongol influences on the Tuvan state and society were systematically reduced.\n\nIn World War II the state contributed infantry, armored, and cavalry troops to fight against Germany. Under Soviet command a number of units distinguished themselves and received Tuvan medals\n\nAnnexation to the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Soviet Union annexed Tuva outright in 1944, apparently with the approval of Tuva's Little Khural (parliament), though there was no referendum on the issue. The exact circumstances surrounding Tannu-Tuva's incorporation into the USSR in 1944 remain obscure. Salchak Toka, the leader of Tuvan communists, was given the title of First Secretary of the Tuvan Communist Party, and became the de facto ruler of Tuva until his death in 1973. Tuva was made the Tuvan Autonomous Oblast and then became the Tuva ASSR on 10 October 1961.\n\nV.A. Sokolov\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century Tuva, located between Mongolia and Siberia, was a land of nomadic livestock breeders. The working arats (peoples) revolted for years and on 14 august 1921 founded their own state  the Tannu-Tuva Peoples Republic (TTPR). Under the leadership of the Peoples Revolutionary Party the working people of Tuva started to effect fundamental social and economic changes in their country. The flag of this party is still preserved in the State Museum in the capital Kyzyl Khoto (Red City). During these years plain red flags were also used in Tuva.\n\nThe first constitutions of the TTPR. adopted in 1921 and 1924, did not contain articles describing the state flag and coat of arms of the TTPR. Such a description was given for the first time in the constitution adopted on 24 November 1926, which changed the name of the country into Tuvinian Peoples Republic. Article 28 of this constitution said that\n\nthe seals of the Great Khuruldan (Legislature), the Government, ministries and other departments shall be of a rectangular form; in the middle of the obverse side of the seal there shall be engraved the Khorlo [1] and inside the Khorlo is the globe of the earth in the rays of the sun and at the top there shall be a sickle and rake framed by a wreath of grain, with the name of the appropriate department being at either side.\n\nAricle 29 said that the state coat of arms shall consist of the image described in Article 28 while Article 30 provided that the state flag shall be red with the state coat of arms in the middle. [2]\n\nChanges in the state flag and coat of arms of Tuva were made in 1930. On 28 June of that year a romanized Tuvinian alphabet was introduced in Tuva; before that inscriptions in Tuva, inclding the name of the country which appeared on the flag, were made in Uighur, the old Mongolian script. Moreover, on 18 October 1930 a new constitution was adopted for Tuva. Its Article 58 said that\n\nthe state coat of arms of the Tuvinian Arat (Peoples) Republic shall consist of a depiction against a red background of a globe framed by a wreath of ears of wheat and grass, in the middle of the globe shall be a sickle and rake, crosswise, and above the globe is a five-pointed star with the inscription TARand Workers of All Lands and Oppressed Peoples of the East, Unite!\n\nArticle 60 said that the state flag shall be red with the state coat of arms in the middle.[3]\n\nIn 1933 the Fourth Session of the Little Khural made changes in the state coat of arms and flag of the Tuvinian Arat Republic (TAR). The new coat of arms of Tuva featured a five-pointed star framed by a border of yellow-red-yellow. Within this border was a depiction, against a blue background, of the TAR territory in greyish-brown and a rider  wearing the red national dress, a black hat with a red band, and black top-boots  astride a white horse, The sun is to the northwest with a green sickle arching from the southeast to the north and, below, the inscriptions TAR and Workers and Oppressed Peoples of All Lands Unite in yellow.\n\nThe new state flag of 1933 was of red with the coat of arms in the middle. This coat of arms meant that Tuva, which had become independend thanks to the October Revolution in Russia, was a peoples revolutionary republic where the main branch of the national economy was animal husbandry supported by stock breeding [4] The flag and coat of arms were both displayed on the Government House of Tuva.\n\nOn 25 June 1941 a new constitution was adopted in Tuva, according to which [5] the state flag of this republic consisted\n\nOf a red cloth with the letters TAR in gold depicted in the upper left corner next to the staf. The staff is topped by a five-pointed star. The ratio of width to length is 1:2.\n\nAs for the new state coat of arms it consisted of a depiction in the center of the TAR territory, against a blue background, of part of the globe, of a riding arat with an uruk [a kind of lasso] in his right hand galloping towards the gold rays of the sun lighting the TAR territory from above from the left. In the upper part of the coat of arms is a fivepointed star with the inscription below it: Workers and Oppressed Peoples of the East Unite! Under the depiction of the TAR territory are a sickle and hammer, crosswise, and below them, on the red ribbon whose ends intertwined with the lower parts of ears of wheat and steppe grass framing the entire representation of the coat of arms, are the letters TAR in gold\n\nAt that time the inscriptions on the flag and coat of arms of Tuva were made in the romanized alphabet. On 8 Septembver 1943 a new alphabet based on Cyrillic lettering was introduced in the republic and all inscriptions on the flag and coat of arms began to be made in this new alphabet.\n\nA firm friendship developed between the Tuvinian people and the peoples of the USSR. The desire to consolidate this friendship forever found its expression in the aspiration of Tuvinians to join the USSR. To the request of that nature from the working people of the TAR dated 26 April 1941, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR responded favorably in its Decree of 11 October 1944. Tuva became an autonomous region of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic and at that time its former coat of arms and flag became null and void, as autonomous regions within the USSR do not possess individual flag and coat of arms.\n\nOn 10 October 1961 Tuva was reorganized into an autonomous republic: on that date the history of its state flag and coat of arms resumed. In this connection on 10 January 1962 the Supreme Soviet of the Tuvinian ASSR adopted the Lawe on the Coat of Arms, Flag, and Capital of the Republicaccordig to which according to which as the state flag (10) of the Tuvinian ASSR there was adopted\n\nthe State flag of the RSFSR, consisting of a red cloth with a light blue stripe at the staff along the whole width of the flag\n\nThe light blue stripe be one-eight of the length of the flag. A sickle and hammer in gold shall be depicted in the upper left corner and above them a five-pointed red star edged in gold and below the sickle and hammer shall be the gold letters Тувинская ACCP (Tuvinian ASSR). the ration of the width of the flag to its length is 1:2,\n\nOn 27 December 1971 the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Tuvinian ASSR adopted the Statute on the State Flag of the Tuvinian ASSRwhich confirmed the positions of the sickle, hammer, star, and stripe on the flag as well as the procedure of its use. According to the law of 19 January 1962,\n\nthe state coat of arms of the RSFSR consisting of a representaion of a sickle and hammer in gold positioned crosswise with the handles down against a red background in the rays of the sun and framed by grain with the inscription ПPOЛETAPИИ BCEX CTPAH COEДИHЯЙTECЬ! [Workers of All Countries, Unite!] in Russuian an Tuvinan language\n\nbecame the state coat of arms of the Tuvinian ASSR.\n\nIn 1978 the RSFSR made a change in its coat of arms. Tuva also made a corresponding change in its coat of arms, adding a five-pointed star at the top and alternating the inscriptions on the shield (!!). Since that time no changes have been made in the representation of the coat of arms.\n\nThe state flag of the Tuvinian ASSR was changed in connection with the adoption of a new constitution of this republic. On 10 November 1978, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet approved a new Statute on the State Flag of the Tuvinian of the Tuvinian ASSR according to which the inscription Tuvinian ASSR was put on the flag in both Russian and Tuvinian languages.\n\nThe symbolism of the contemporary state flag and coat of arm of the Tuvinian ASSR is identical to the symbolism of colors and figures of the state flag and coat of arms of the RSFSR. Only the inscriptions on the flag an coat of arms in Tuvinian individualize them and convey the idea of the equality of the Tuvinian people in the united family of the peoples of the Russian federation. [6]\n\nOn 1 November 1992, the resolution of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Tuva No. 354 \"On the State Emblem and the State Flag of the Republic of Tuva\" came into effect on 17 September 1992, which approved the description and depiction of the State Coat of Arms of the Republic of Tuva on the projects of Ivan Chamzoevich Salchak and Oleg Ilyich Lazeyev in their author's description:\n\n\"The State Emblem represents five equal semicircular outlines (five-petalled). The contour of the coat of arms is a narrow (1/38 part from the center) golden (yellow) stripe with alternation deep into the white (1/38 part from the center) and then golden (yellow) wide (1/19 part of the center) strip. In the upper right corner image of the Sun (1/7 part from the center) with fifteen golden (yellow) colors. In the center, on a blue background, a rider (1/3 part of the coat of arms in height) is depicted on a golden (yellow) horse galloping towards the rays of the rising sun . Below the rider is a traditional band \"hudak\" of white color (1/7 part in height) with an inscription in Tuvan language \"Tyv \". The letters are made in gold (yellow) color. All the ratios are measured from the center of the coat of arms \"\n\nThe official explanation of the symbolism of the coat of arms: \"The arat horseman riding on a horse - a farmer-pastoralist reflects the identity of the Tuvinian ethnos, their traditional way of life and basic economic activities for many centuries. On the rider national costume \"tone\" and headdress, worn by the ancestors of the Tuvinians. It is not by chance that he is on horseback. The life of a Tuvinian nomad is inconceivable without him. The horse gave high-calorie food - meat and koumiss; clothes, shoes, ropes, lasso, thread; served as the main vehicle, in the event of military clashes was a war friend of his master. The image of the rider - arata, galloping toward the golden rays of the sun, symbolizes the movement towards a bright and happy life, the world, high ideals. The ribbon \"kadak\" is a ceremonial scarf, is presented as an honorable gift, and also expresses the hospitality and friendliness of the Tuvinians. The five-petalled frame, which gives the coat of arms a unique shape, is a stylized ancient Buddhist sign of eternity. \"\n\nth are intertwined with the lower parts of ears of corn and steppe grasses framing the whole image of the emblem, the golden letters \"TAR\" (Tuva People's Republic) \".\n\nArticle 16 of the constitution of the Republic of Tuva about the. State Symbols and the Capital of the Republic of Tuva reads:\n\n1. The Republic of Tuva has its own state symbols  flag, emblem, anthem. The description and procedure for the use of the state symbols of the Republic of Tuva are established by the constitutional law of the Republic of Tuva.\n\n2. The capital of the Republic of Tyva is the city of Kyzyl. The status of the capital is established by the constitutional law of the Republic of Tuva.\n\nCoat of arms of the Republic of Tuva\n\nDescription:\n\nCoat of arms of the Republic of Tuva  an image on a blue background of a golden horseman in national Tuvan clothing, galloping on a golden horse to meet the rays of the rising sun. At the base of the coat of arms on the traditional white ribbon kadak inscription gold Tyva. The frame of the emblem is five-petalled.\n\nThe arat horseman galloping on a horse  a peasant cattle-breeder reflects the identity of the Tuvinians, their traditional way of life and basic economic activities for many centuries. On the rider national costume tone and headdress, worn by the ancestors of the Tuvinians. It is not by chance that he is on horseback. The life of a Tuvinian nomad is inconceivable without him. The horse gave high-calorie food  meat and koumiss; clothes, shoes, ropes, lasso, thread; served as the main vehicle, in the event of military clashes was a war friend of his master. The image of the rider  arata, galloping toward the golden rays of the sun, symbolizes the movement towards a bright and happy life, the world, high ideals.
