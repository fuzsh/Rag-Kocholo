        "text": "This chapter seeks to distinguish musician Valeriy Kechilovich Mongush’s vocal gifts of xöömei, kargyraa, and sygyt from the so-called throat-singing or overtone singing prac­ tices that have circulated internationally (especially since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991) and become dissociated from local meanings and values in the Tyva Republic. In particular, the author is concerned that the global awareness of these practices has fo­ cused on the “acoustic facts” of voice production to the exclusion of the histories and re­ sponsibilities that these gifts carry—the knowledge of where these practices originate, what they mean, how their history reflects a changing and sometimes repressive political landscape, the intentionality of voicing as action, and the aesthetic and ethical dimen­ sions of voicing song as a social practice. The chapter asks what Valeriy is doing—both re­ al and imagined—when he is doing xöömei, kargyraa, or sygyt. What stories does he tell himself and others? How do his vocal practices reflect a changing political landscape? And what, in Valeriy’s estimation, should practitioners of these “three main techniques” (üsh kol xevir) do in order to understand them as vocal gifts and use them with a sense of purpose, care, and respect for local traditions? The author poses these questions and Valeriy answers with more stories, told from his own perspective.\n\nPart of a Special Issue on Ethnomusicology edited by Valentina Süzükei. This article explores some of the relationships between ideology, aesthetics, circulation, and agency in productions of “traditional music” and “world music” made by musicians from Tuva, a Turkic-speaking republic in Inner Asia that is now a part of the Russian Federation. This article contends that the conditions surrounding the dissolution of state socialism in the former Soviet Union laid the groundwork for the meaning and value of culture and identity in post-Soviet Tuva, including traditional music, to be renegotiated. The intentions of actors and interest groups involved in renegotiating the aesthetics of Tuva’s traditional music were diverse and not always consistent. Nonetheless, their efforts in combination had the effect of rejecting Soviet state-sponsored folkloric models as overly mediated and embracing global music industry models as more representative of “authentic” Tuvan musical practices. Neoliberal “branding” of xöömei throat-singing and Tuvan traditional music within the world music industries produced new forms of meaning and value for Tuvan people in the post-Soviet era. It also gave legitimacy to local projects of postcolonial historiography and precipitated a reevaluation of indigenous culture, language, and identity. This article traces and attempts to disentangle the work of some of the agents who were instrumental in shaping Tuvan musical aesthetics during the 1980s and 1990s, which are foundational to understanding Tuva’s contemporary music scenes based in the republic’s capital city of Kyzyl.\n\nRooted deeply in spiritual and traditional practical uses, the unique practice of throat singing and the folk song genres of the nation are encountering many challenges in the modernization and the merge into the global music world. Tuvan throat singing is an intense skill that is a cultural norm in the NorthEast Asian region, and has just recently begun to disperse globally, beginning an experiment of how cultural-specific spiritual musical practices are translated and interpreted around the world. This paper provides an analysis of the integration of the Tuvan throat singing practices in the Western music world, focusing on how the context in which it is performed impacts the performance and the aesthetic meaning of the music. In accomplishing this paper&#39;s aim, an in-depth historical and cultural perspective is necessary, thus through the work of ethnomusicologists&#39; field work, the genre&#39;s spiritual roots are identified, followed by the use of traditional performer&#39...\n\nThe Republic of Tyva and her people, since mid-twentieth century, exist in a colonized state first by the Soviet Union (1944-1991) and currently by the Russian Federation (1991-Present). In an increasingly nationalistic Russification policy inside Mr. Putin's Russia, the people of Tyva continue to live as a marginalized population and the target of rampant discrimination at home. While traditionally the Tyvan people have relied on geographic isolation as a form of defense, both indigenous language and music, while not classified as endangered are under pressure due to continued internal Russification policies. This mixed methods dissertation explored modern Tyvan identity, musical culture, and music learning by means of immersive field work in Tyva and Mongolia described in autoethnography, a Likert style survey (N = 168) to rank the importance of markers of modern Tyvan identity, and finally an extended long form questionnaire (N = 44) designed to explore the musical lives, teaching and learning of Tyvan Vocal Music (khöömei), and Tyvan Instrumental Music (doshpuluur, igil, chanzy, kengirge, shoor, chadagan, khomus). Both music and voice function as embodied forms of memory that bind the Tyvans to their ancestral lands and pre-Soviet non-colonized nomadic life.\n\nThis article discusses the influence of staged folklore and popular music upon the musical life of a Central Asian rural community-that of the Dashtijum mountain valley in Tajikistan. I trace the musical history of the Dashtijumis across the late-Soviet and post-Soviet periods, following their experiences of migration away from and back to the mountains. In the process, I highlight how the cross-fertilization between grassroots musical practices, and staged and mediated traditional and popular musics, has offered a terrain for the articulation of collective identifications, memories and everyday lifeworlds among the Dashtijumis, illuminating more broadly their position and response vis-à-vis changing historical, technological and ideological frameworks.\n\nThis article aims to explain and exemplify the bard's identity and the functions of khömmei –a special vocal technique sometimes called overtone singing or throat-singing among nomadic, hunter-herder communities of Mongolia, Tuva and Siberia. The presentation will be performed by means of short-length auditory and visual media. The bard's ritualistic performances are viewed in terms of sound production and their functions as well as the impact of modernist policies, historical struggle for independence, colonialism and global capitalism as agents of change on this spiritual and social act. The status of the bard within the versatile, multilayered character of Mongolian society is assessed from the perspective of animistic roots of Mongolian Buddhism (called Shamanism in popular social perspective), nomadic life, economic and social concepts. For instance, while the performance of a spiritual leader (shaman) includes the practice of unification with cosmic power, that of the bard has some other functions, namely transmission of values giving the opportunity for the bard practice to be maintained in a Buddhist realm with regard to a belief system."
