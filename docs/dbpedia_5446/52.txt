Welcome back for another film review 🙂

I recently got chance to watch this film- after wanting to watch it for so long- and I really enjoyed it!

‘Pretty Woman’ film synopsis

‘Pretty Woman’ is a 90s film about a young “call girl” Vivian (Julia Roberts) who is hired by a business man, Edward (Richard Gere). Edward needs someone to accompany him to important, high class social engagements with various business associates.

He thinks that a girlfriend will complicate things too much, and so when he meets Vivian one night while she’s out working, he realises she is the perfect solution.

And this arrangement is perfect for Vivian, too. As someone who is not used to men treating her well, she is blown away by Edward’s behaviour as a gentleman, failing to understand his rich, middle-class way of living.

As Vivian and Edward start to understand each other’s worlds, they get closer as people, with Vivian helping Edward with his business meetings, and Edward opening Vivian’s horizons, and her mind.

‘Pretty Woman’ film review

I loved this film for many reasons, not least the glamour and excitement. When Vivian first goes to the hotel where Edward is staying, she is mesmerised by his wealth, and I loved seeing how this world was so different to the one she was used to.

I also loved the glamorous scenes where Vivian and Edward go to upper class parties, such as the races. The people she encounters there are rich and snooty and so the interactions between them and Vivian are fantastic. The scene where Vivian goes shopping is also a classic, and yet it was so glamorous to watch.

I would really recommend this film, as it was fun and light, but also a meaningful watch, and I actually found that it stayed with me afterwards. While it may be seen as just a “stereotypical” love story, I thought this was a brilliant film.

Stuck in the house, it’s hard to find activities to fill out the day, especially if you’re not working, and so I would really recommend this film to anyone wanting to escape the realities of the world for a few hours.

Did you enjoy my review of ‘Pretty Woman’? Do you like films that feature Julia Roberts and Richard Gere? What’s your favourite 1990s classic?

Happy reading (and stay safe) x
