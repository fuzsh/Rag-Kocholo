        "text": "From 5.13 big walls in Yosemite to 5.14 sport climbs in Mexico to V14 boulder problems in Colorado, Pretty Strong follows eight of the world's strongest female climbers as they explore new climbing areas, send hard projects, and push the boundaries of the sport and themselves. Putting badass ladies front and center, this film is about some of the best climbers in the world--some you know, some you don't--doing what they do best: crushing hard rock climbs. Your palms will sweat from the dizzying heights, your imagination will expand with the breathtaking landscapes, and your motivation will soar from the determination and try-hard of these strong women. The climbers featured include Nina Williams, Katie Lambert, Daila Ojeda, Hazel Findlay, and more. Created by the all-women production team Never Not Collective, Pretty Strong is a climbing film about women, by women, and for everyone.\n\nWe are excited to partner with REI Pittsburgh to screen Pretty Strong. All who register will receive a token for their first drink from East End Brewing and a raffle ticket for REI gift packages. Donations and raffle tickets sales to benefit Southwestern PA Climbers Coalition (SWPACC). Doors open at 7PM, program will begin at 8:15PM. East End Brewing - beer and non-alcoholic drinks & Yovi's Food Truck - until 9PM."
