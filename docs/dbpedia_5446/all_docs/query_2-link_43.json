        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nNational Best Friends Day is on June 8.\n\nIn honor of the holiday, we've picked the 20 most iconic best friends in movie history.\n\nWe've picked friendships of all kinds, like \"Harry Potter\" trio and Cher and Dionne from \"Clueless.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn honor of National Best Friends Day on June 8, we've picked 20 iconic best friends from movies, ranging from Goose and Maverick in \"Top Gun\" to Romy and Michele, to the ladies of \"Girls Trip.\"\n\nBest friends are some of the most important people in our lives. And we all need to celebrate our besties right now, especially when we might not be able to see them as often as we'd like.\n\nKeep scrolling to see which BFFs we picked. Maybe it'll inspire your next besties movie night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Top Gun's\" Goose and Maverick are the epitome of bro-love.\n\nGoose and Maverick are regularly put in life-or-death situations as Navy pilots, and have to trust each other implicitly in order to stay safe. But out of the cockpit, the two are equally as close. They play volleyball together, Goose helps Maverick serenade women at bars, and they clearly have a deep bond. No spoilers, but the end of \"Top Gun\" will make you cry, and it comes down to how much they love each other.\n\nAnd now, 36 years later, you can see how much the events of \"Top Gun\" have affected Maverick in 2022's \"Top Gun: Maverick.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThroughout the eight \"Harry Potter\" films, Harry, Ron, and Hermione, continually put their lives in jeopardy for each other.\n\nSpecifically, Ron and Hermione continually choose to put themselves in harm's way to support their friend Harry, and while he never asks them to do it, he always feels guilty that his friends are put in danger. They all support each other, make each other laugh, and by the end of the saga, they are family.\n\nIn \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy, Sam proves over and over that he's the best friend Frodo could've asked for.\n\nHobbits are small, but Frodo and Sam (and also Merry and Pippin) prove that they can change the world. Every time Frodo gets discouraged on the journey to destroy the dangerous ring, Sam encourages him and helps him along the way. We all need a Samwise Gamgee in our lives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"Romy and Michele's High School Reunion,\" Romy and Michele prove that their high school friendship is a bond for life.\n\nEven though Romy and Michele do fight towards the beginning of the film, they reconcile to show everyone from their high school that they are successful, and way cooler than they were back then. They learn that their bullies from back then definitely peaked in high school, and they show off their iconic dance to \"Time After Time.\"\n\nTimon and Pumbaa are the most legendary Disney duo.\n\nTimon and Pumbaa stand by each other through everything, from Pumbaa's flatulence problem to their decision to adopt a dangerous lion cub together. In both the animated classic and the new live-action film, Timon and Pumbaa are easily the highlight of the films.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTibby, Bridget, Carmen, and Lena are bound together by a magical pair of jeans and years of sisterhood.\n\nIn both \"Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\" movies, our foursome doesn't actually spend much time together. Instead, they communicate via letters and a magical pair of pants that seems to fit all of them, even though they have different body types. But that means their bond is all the more powerful. They are there for each other even when they're thousands of miles apart.\n\nA three-movie saga starts with two stoner best friends Harold and Kumar, who simply want to go to White Castle.\n\nWhile the \"Harold & Kumar\" films might be extremely silly, it's fun to see pre-stardom Kal Penn and John Cho as two stoners desperate for burgers. Their adventures together, including hang-gliding off a cliff, hanging out with Neil Patrick Harris, and escaping from Guantanamo Bay, are, in a word, legendary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnnie, Brenda, and Elise reunite after losing touch after college, and team up to get revenge on their husbands.\n\nSadly, this trio was a foursome before their friend Cynthia died by suicide, but that incident inspires the three to reunite as the First Wives Club. Throughout the film, they prove that their husbands don't own them, and they rediscover how powerful their friendship is.\n\nIn \"Clueless,\" Cher and Dionne prove why they're the original high school power duo.\n\nCher and Dionne are benevolent popular girls. They try and help new student Tai, they organize a fundraiser, and they even get two of their teachers to fall in love. Even now, we rarely see \"popular\" girls as heroes in movies; they're almost always the enemy to be taken down. But we never see Cher and Dionne be mean. More friendships like this, please!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBill and Ted have had many adventures together over the years, all excellent, of course.\n\nNot all best friends can say that, one day, they'll be responsible for creating a perfect utopian society, but time-traveling duo Bill and Ted (played by Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves) sure can.\n\nOver the course of three movies and two separate TV series, Bill and Ted traveled throughout time, formed a band, and remained besties. In the 2020 sequel, \"Bill & Ted Face the Music,\" it's revealed that they stayed close, and that their daughters are close friends as well.\n\nOne of the most recent additions to the list of iconic besties are Molly and Amy from \"Booksmart.\"\n\nThroughout the film, which almost entirely takes place in a day, Molly and Amy realize that they wasted their high school experience studying and staying home to get into good colleges when they find out that everyone else in their grade, who went out and partied, are also going to good schools. And thus, the two are set on a whirlwind journey including hallucinogenic strawberries, jail, a serial killer, a giant fight, and multiple wild parties. Not bad for two nerds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe real friendship worth remembering from \"Mean Girls\" is between Janis and Damien.\n\nYou could include Cady, played by Lindsay Lohan, but Janis and Damien were besties long before she came into the picture. Damien stuck by Janis when everyone else was afraid of her for years. It really was them against the world.\n\nHan Solo and Chewbacca have a decades-long friendship.\n\nHan and Chewie have been in our lives since the original \"Star Wars\" movie in 1977. Over the decades that followed, we saw the origin of their bond in \"Solo: A Star Wars Story,\" and saw in \"The Force Awakens\" that, in the 30 years that followed \"Return of the Jedi,\" Han and Chewie stayed close until the very end. While Han may claim he's not loyal to anyone, he's certainly got a soft spot for his Wookiee friend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThelma and Louise, played by Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon, embark on a wild road trip together as they attempt to outrun the police.\n\nIn \"Thelma & Louise,\" Thelma and Louise are two friends who, after a night out at a bar, end up shooting a man who attempted to rape Thelma. The two then hit the road together. These two are literally ride or die.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarlin and Dory become friends over the course of \"Finding Nemo.\" By the end, they're family.\n\nNot every fish would travel across the ocean, braving sharks, scuba divers, jellyfish, and a dentist's office, for someone they just met. But from the jump, Dory is there to support and help Marlin on his search for his son Nemo. While he doesn't always appreciate Dory at first, by the end of the movie, he recognizes her as family.\n\nAnd in the sequel, \"Finding Dory,\" both Marlin and Nemo don't hesitate to help her find her family, and then rescue her from the aquarium. We love to see it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRyan, Sasha, Lisa, and Dina in \"Girls Trip\" are always a fun time.\n\nThe Flossy Posse, as they're also known, are always a fun time, especially when they reunite in New Orleans after years of drifting apart. \"Girls Trip\" is hilarious and heartwarming, and it all comes down to the chemistry and genuine love between these four women. We want a sequel, ASAP.\n\nIn \"Now and Then,\" we follow the kid and adult versions of Roberta, Teeny, Samantha, and Chrissy.\n\n\"Now and Then\" is a story about growing up, and these four friends did it together by vowing to be there for each other always. While it's another story about childhood friends growing apart as adults, the star-studded cast (Demi Moore, Rosie O'Donnell, Melanie Griffith, and Rita Wilson play the adult versions of the friends) helps this movie remain an important entry in the best friends canon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"Set It Off,\" Stony, Cleo, Frankie, and T.T. commit crimes together to help better their lives.\n\nFriends who rob banks together, stay together. Though \"Set It Off\" was released 26 years ago, its themes of racism, police brutality, and inequality, remain painfully relevant today. At the center of it all are Stony, Cleo, Frankie, and T.T., who come together to rob a bank and better their lives.\n\n\"The film fully recognizes and acknowledges how the bond of a deep friendship with other Black women can be necessary and life-affirming. To have fellowship and camaraderie with women you would not just kill for, but die for,\" wrote Sherronda J. Brown for the Black Youth Project.\n\nThe bond between \"Fast and Furious\" stars Dom Toretto and Brian O'Conner made for one of the saddest movie moments of all time.\n\nDom and Brian created a bond in 2001's \"The Fast and the Furious.\" Over 14 years and six more movies, they proved they were the heart of the franchise when, after the real-life death of Paul Walker (who played Brian), Dom and Brian share a scene set to \"See You Again\" that will tug on anyone's heartstrings. The fact that Walker and Vin Diesel (Dom) were also close in real life makes this on-screen friendship even more powerful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Bridesmaids\" is all about the friendship of Annie and Lillian.\n\nAnnie and Lillian support each other through major life events, like getting engaged, opening (and closing) your own business, and getting married. The main conflict of the movie is that Annie feels insecure and nervous that Lillian is replacing her with Helen, which is extremely relatable. But, thankfully, the two work out their differences and have a memorable sing-along in the process.\n\nRead next\n\nMovies Friends Entertainment\n\nMore...\n\nAdvertisement"
