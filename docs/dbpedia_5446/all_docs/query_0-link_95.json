        "text": "What if the roles were reversed between Julia Roberts and Richard Gere in Pretty Woman? Or if it was a comical version of it? How would it be if it were in French? Not quite there yet to qualify as a classic like the former movie, but The Hook Up Plan (Plan Coeur) is certainly an amusing romantic-comedy mini-series.\n\nThe Netflix Original, directed by Renaud Bertrand and Noemie Saglio, has garnered a positive response from audience worldwide, rated on imbd with 7.5 out of 10. This eight episode series, with each chapter having a running time of around 25 to 30 minutes is perfect for a weekend binge session for all the hopeless romantics out there.\n\nPlan Coeur is a quirky story about the Parisian girl-next-door – Elsa, who is in her late twenties, living with her father, and stuck in a job that doesn’t excite her. Hung over her ex, Maxime for over two years, Elsa is a lost cause who can only be handled by her two bestfriends – Charlotte/Cha-Cha & Emilie/Milou. After a night of drunken misadventures, Cha-Cha has an epiphany of how Elsa needs to get laid to get over the past, strongly opposed by Milou, while Elsa still holds out hope for something extra-ordinary. In a hilarious attempt to get her out of the funk, Cha-Cha ends up hiring her a male escort or as the French say it, a Gigolo.\n\nAlthough a strange parallel can be drawn with Pretty Woman, Milou after finding out about Cha-Cha’s conspiracy screams out about the fact that Elsa isn’t Julia Roberts nor does she have any idea that the Prince Charming, Jules Dupont who flirted with her near a carousel was actually paid to do so. All this spirals out of control as dates after dates follow, and the web of lies go out of hand, with the girls having problems of their own to deal with.\n\nDespite a slightly predictable storytelling, what makes this series delightful is the relatable and multidimensional characters – Elsa, the awkward yet witty & charmingly optimistic soul; Cha-Cha, the funny, fleeting girl but with her own strong perspectives; and Milou, the uncompromising yet empathetic independent woman. This trio will have you remember your own besties – polar opposites with different tastes in Pizza, complicated yet inseparable.\n\nThen there is Jules (looks very much like the French version of Tom Hardy), who whisks away Elsa off her feet. One can slowly understand the helplessness of Jules once he realises he’s in it too deep, but has a mother and a friend to support. The actors bring life and chemistry to these comical and flawed characters in such a way that you start rooting for most of them. Even the side characters keep you on your toes and the dialogues and situations make you laugh out loud quite a lot.\n\nSpeculations are still on whether this light-hearted series will return for another season, but going by what happened in the first, many are eagerly awaiting for its continuation. Last but not the least, one should keep their ears out for the amazing soundtrack of this series, with the song Amor Ocasional as the cherry on top. As for the best French experience, the recommended way: French Audio, with English subtitles, and a glass of wine… and maybe even your beau?\n\nBy: Arundhati Chowdhury\n\nBA (Hons) Geography\n\nPS:\n\nHere are some links to help you out –\n\n1.
