        "text": "Earlier this week Domino's Pizza had to issue an apology over a promotion it ran in Australia and New Zealand, offering free pizza to \"nice Karens\".\n\nThe company didn't pick out the name Karen at random. \"Karen\" has, in recent years, become a widespread meme referencing a specific type of middle-class white woman, who exhibits behaviours that stem from privilege.\n\nTo give some examples, \"Karen\" is associated with the kind of person who demands to \"speak to the manager\" in order to belittle service industry workers, is anti-vaccination, and carries out racist micro-aggressions, such as asking to touch black people's hair.\n\nBut a predominant feature of the \"Karen\" stereotype is that they weaponise their relative privilege against people of colour - for example, when making police complaints against black people for minor or even - in numerous cases - fictitious infringements.\n\nAnd in recent months, the meme has evolved into something new: Coronavirus Karen. This particular form of Karen refuses to wear a face covering in shops, won't stick to quarantine, and thinks the whole pandemic thing is overblown.\n\nBut as the meme has become increasingly mainstream, some have argued that it's sexist and ageist.\n\nWhere did the meme come from?\n\nAlthough its exact origins are uncertain, the meme became popular a few years ago as a way for people of colour, particularly black Americans, to satirise the class-based and racially charged hostility they often face.\n\nOver the last decade, as it became easier to film confrontations on our smartphones, incidents started to be captured on camera and uploaded to social media with far greater ease - a woman calling the police when a black eight-year-old child was selling water without a permit, for example.\n\nWhen these videos inevitably went viral, people online would assign the perpetrators commonplace names that chimed with the situation.\n\nThe woman who complained about the young water-seller was dubbed \"Permit Patty\". Another woman who called the police when a black family was having a barbecue was named \"BBQ Becky\". And a white woman who called 911 on a black dad at a football match, while sitting in a golf cart, was called \"Golfcart Gail\".\n\nThis trend properly broke through in 2018, and eventually all of these names became distilled into one or two of the most popular - including Karen.\n\nIt also became synonymous with a particular type of hairstyle - specifically, the short, choppy cut sported by US reality TV personality Kate Gosselin in 2010. (Gosselin has since changed her hairstyle.)\n\nAnd in recent months a male version of the Karen meme has emerged, although it is less widely used: Ken. In June, when wealthy couple Patricia and Mark McCloskey were pictured pointing guns at protesters passing by their home in St Louis, Missouri, they were widely dubbed \"Karen and Ken\".\n\nWhat is a 'Coronavirus Karen'?\n\nThe wearing of face coverings in this pandemic has been extremely politically charged in the US, with some insisting mandatory usage is an affront to personal liberty.\n\nSince the coronavirus arrived in the country, videos have periodically gone viral on social media of people refusing to wear face coverings in stores and restaurants, often berating service staff.\n\nAggressively refusing to wear a face covering to help protect others from the virus has been seen as a new iteration of the stereotype of the entitled Karen who harasses service industry workers. Similarly, people who share coronavirus disinformation and conspiracy theories on social media are called Karens, too.\n\nIn the US, as in the UK, Covid-19 has become a racially charged issue as well. The pandemic disproportionately affects people from black and other ethnic minority backgrounds.\n\nThe refusal of some people to acknowledge the risks associated with the virus, and to be shielded from these risks by their white privilege, has also been seen as \"Karen\" behaviour.\n\nWhat about racism and Black Lives Matter?\n\nOn Memorial Day this year, 25 May, black birder Christian Cooper was walking in Central Park, New York, when he ran into a woman called Amy Cooper (no relation), who had let her dog off the lead in a leash-only area of the park.\n\nHe asked her to put her dog back on the lead. Her response was to call 911 and, in histrionic tones, tell operators that \"there's an African-American man threatening my life\". The entire exchange was filmed, uploaded to social media, and Ms Cooper was from then on known as \"Central Park Karen\".\n\nGeorge Floyd was killed by police officers in Minneapolis that same day, just hours after the Central Park incident - meaning people began linking the racism of \"Karens\" such as Amy Cooper to the wider issue of systemic racism and police brutality.\n\nIs the Karen meme sexist?\n\nIn April, British feminist Julie Bindel tweeted: \"Does anyone else think the 'Karen' slur is woman-hating and based on class prejudice?\"\n\nThis is an argument that has been repeated in recent months, as the meme has become more mainstream. Some people responded to Bindel's tweet agreeing with her summary. Even British supermarket Sainsbury's has had a run-in with the meme.\n\nAllow Twitter content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

To view this content choose ‘accept and continue’.\n\nHowever, people who use the term \"Karen\" say that it is not simply a catch-all for all middle-aged white women - and is, rather, dependent on a person's behaviour.\n\nFor example, writer Karen Geier - a Karen in the traditional sense - responded to Bindel: \"As the only Karen replying to you: No. If you have a problem being called 'a Karen' then don't be one? I don't call the police on people or ask to speak to the manager. Very simple!\"\n\nSo, when is a Karen not a Karen?\n\nThe Wall of Moms bloc in the current protest movement in Portland, Oregon is a good example of mainly middle-class, middle-aged white women explicitly not being Karens."
