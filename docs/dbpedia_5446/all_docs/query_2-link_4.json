        "text": "Mr. Darcy's hand flex, plain and simple.\n\nIf you're a film aficionado, chances are you've heard of the \"male gaze.\" Basically, the male gaze refers to how women in media are depicted from the perspective of heterosexual men, therefore making them passive objects of male desire.\n\nBUT, lately there's also been a lot of talk about the \"female gaze.\" There's not quite an official definition of the female gaze yet, but it generally means subverting the male gaze and depicting things from the female perspective, usually tapping into empathy, emotion, art, and/or empowerment more than simply objectifying. For example:\n\nSo, I'm curious: What's your favorite example of the female gaze in movies and TV? Maybe the scene in Pride and Prejudice where Mr. Darcy's hand flexes after touching Elizabeth's for the first time always makes you weak in the knees.\n\nOr perhaps you really appreciate how the Amazons are portrayed in Wonder Woman as strong, empowered warriors when they could've very easily been sexualized.\n\nOr maybe you've always preferred Loki over Thor in the MCU because his depiction was always SO MUCH more appealing than Thor merely taking his shirt off.\n\nOr perhaps you still think about the moment when Miles helps Iris get something out of her eyelash in The Holiday:\n\nWhatever it is, tell us in the comments! Share your favorite example of the female gaze in movies and TV, and why you love it so much. Or fill out this form if you'd rather remain anonymous. We may feature your responses in an upcoming BuzzFeed Community post.\n\nShare This Article"
