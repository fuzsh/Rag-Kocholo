        "text": "\"A stunning family tragedy and a hold-your-breath pedal-to-the-metal thriller...certain to be a book of the year.\"\n\n—Lee Child\n\nSisters. Strangers. Survivors.\n\nMore than twenty years ago, Claire and Lydia’s teenaged sister Julia vanished without a trace. The two women have not spoken since, and now their lives could not be more different. Claire is the glamorous trophy wife of an Atlanta millionaire. Lydia, a single mother, dates an ex-con and struggles to make ends meet. But neither has recovered from the horror and heartbreak of their shared loss—a devastating wound that's cruelly ripped open when Claire's husband is killed.\n\nThe disappearance of a teenage girl and the murder of a middle-aged man, almost a quarter-century apart: what could connect them? Forming a wary truce, the surviving sisters look to the past to find the truth, unearthing the secrets that destroyed their family all those years ago . . . and uncovering the possibility of redemption, and revenge, where they least expect it.\n\nPowerful, poignant, and utterly gripping, packed with indelible characters and unforgettable twists, an instant New York Times bestseller, Pretty Girls is a masterful novel from one of the finest writers working today.\n\nREVIEWS\n\nInstant New York Times Bestseller\n\nWall Street Journal “Best Books of 2015”\n\nHuffington Post “Best Books of 2015”\n\nGood Housekeeping “Best New Read”\n\nRedbook “Best Books 2015”\n\nAmazon “Best Book of October 2015”\n\n#1 iBooks Bestseller\n\nCOSTCO Buyer’s Staff Pick\n\nPeople’s Choice Award Winner\n\nITW Thriller Award Finalist, Best Hardcover Novel\n\n“A hell-raising thriller…a genuinely exciting narrative driven by strong-willed female characters who can’t wait around until the boys shake the lead out of their shoes.”\n\n—The New York Times\n\n“The author's trademark of complex plots coupled with character studies makes Pretty Girls another standout.” —The Associated Press\n\n“Slaughter shreds your own nerves along with those of the sisters, not simply by a parade of gruesome revelations—though she supplies them in abundance—but by peeling back layer after layer from beloved family members Claire and Lydia thought they knew.” —Kirkus, starred review\n\n“Pretty Girls is one of the year's most fascinating stories, told with the creatively inventive touch of a true master of suspense. It is also a story that will stay with you for a long time after you have closed its pages…I have long praised the books of Karin Slaughter, Pretty Girls, however requires praise at a new level.” —Huffington Post\n\n“The queen of police thrillers takes a more psychological approach with her 15th novel…the book has all the twists and suspense that readers expect from Slaughter, but from a more poignant perspective.” —Atlanta Magazine"
