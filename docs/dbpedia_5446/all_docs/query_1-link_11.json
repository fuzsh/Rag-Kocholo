Sundance Institute has offered unprecedented support to women artists, including groundbreaking women like Euzhan Palcy, Barbara Kopple, Allison Anders, and many more at our earliest labs and Festival.\n\nOur dedicated Women at Sundance program began as a partnership with WIF Los Angeles in 2012. Together, we commissioned groundbreaking research with Dr. Stacy Smith and her team at USC’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative to better understand the key barriers and opportunities for women filmmakers.\n\nGuided by these findings, Women at Sundance supports filmmakers from historically underrepresented communities — through yearlong Fellowships and shorter intensives — to cultivate career sustainability, build community, and strengthen the artist pipeline.\n\nThe program has catalyzed the growth of women-dominated networks and established a firm awareness among decision-makers and gatekeepers in the industry about the deficit of women behind the camera in independent film and beyond.\n\nWomen at Sundance continues to discover, spotlight, and forge ways for women to succeed as storytellers who shape our cultural landscape."
