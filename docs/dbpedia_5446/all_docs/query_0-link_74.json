        "text": "How much you’ll love “Pretty Woman: The Musical” depends a lot on how much you loved its source material, the 1990 film that turned Julia Roberts from a hot Hollywood newcomer into a global superstar.\n\nVirtually every character, costume, wig, signature line and scene from the movie has been replicated faithfully in the 2-1/2-hour touring production playing through Sunday at the San Diego Civic Theatre.\n\nThe big and occasionally bombastic stage adaptation has fun, flashy pep thanks to director-choreographer Jerry Mitchell. But the show’s original score by Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance is only modestly memorable, and the sexual heat that earned the film an R rating has been modestly toned down to PG-13.\n\nRoberts’ charm, vulnerability and beauty made the Cinderella story of a New York billionaire falling instantly in love with a Hollywood streetwalker seem somehow plausible on film. It’s a tougher sell onstage. Central character Vivian Ward, the hooker with a heart of gold from small-town Georgia, comes across in the musical’s first act much brassier, louder and tougher than the Vivian onscreen. Fortunately, Vivian’s rough edges are shaved down considerably in act two.\n\nThe musical’s 16-song score — ranging from ballads to rock solos to a tango — is chock full of belted high notes, and fortunately the tour’s two lead actors have the talent to pull them off. Vivacious Olivia Valli as Vivian has a huge and well-tuned pop voice, and Adam Pascal, as the billionaire Edward, still has the gravel-edged, razor-sharp rock tenor voice that made him famous 26 years ago in “Rent.”\n\nKyle Taylor Parker is endearingly funny as the Happy Man, a character unique to the musical who pops up unexpectedly in numerous roles, from the map-to-the-stars hawker to the hotel manager to the conductor in the Civic Theatre’s orchestra pit. And Jessica Crouch brings a comic, streetwise sensibility a growling rock-blues voice to Vivian’s roommate and fellow hooker, Kit.\n\nAs in the movie, Edward hires Vivian to be his lover and social companion during his one-week business trip to Beverly Hills. During that time, she influences him to loosen up emotionally and give up his career as a corporate raider. That transition takes time in the film but is telegraphed early in the musical in Edward’s first-act song “Freedom,” which is one of the show’s best numbers.\n\nMitchell’s choreography is challenging and athletic and the energetic 21-member cast make these steps look easy.\n\nOne of the show’s best song-and-dance scenes — led by Parker and Trent Soyster as the baby-faced hotel bellboy — is “One Night Like Tonight,” where the hotel staff teaches Vivian to tango. But a musical scene that disappoints is Vivian’s Rodeo Drive shopping blitz. In the film, there’s a quick-cut series of shots of Roberts trying on multiple outfits to Roy Orbison’s 1964 song “Oh, Pretty Woman.” That kind of quick-change effect isn’t possible onstage, but Orbison’s song does make an appearance in the show.\n\nOn Wednesday night, a near-capacity audience primed from repeat viewings of the film applauded every signature line (“Big mistake. Big. Huge.”) and sang along to the title song. The show is a guaranteed crowd-pleaser, but it doesn’t stick in the memory like the better and more original musicals “Hadestown” and “Come From Away,” which visited the Civic earlier this summer.\n\n‘Pretty Woman: The Musical’\n\nWhen: 8 p.m. Friday, July 29. 2 and 8 p.m. Saturday, July 30. 1 and 6:30 p.m. Sunday, July 31\n\nWhere: San Diego Civic Theatre, 1100 Third Ave., San Diego\n\nTickets: $40.50 and up\n\nOnline: broadwaysd.com"
