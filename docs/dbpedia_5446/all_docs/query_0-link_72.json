        "text": "DEVILS LAKE, N.D. -- A North Dakota high school is under fire for using movie clips from the film, \"Pretty Woman\" to suggest what girls shouldn't wear to school.\n\nIn the well known 1990s film, actress Julia Roberts plays a prostitute. The clips were played during a female dress code assembly.\n\nAdministrators say they were encouraging female students to refrain from wearing tight yoga pants and leggings. However, some say the clips were over the top.\n\n\"I get, like, how that lady was judged by what she was wearing,\" said one young student. \"But we don't wear that kind of stuff to school.\"\n\nLicensed psychotherapist Dr. Stacy Kaiser adds, \"The message it is sending to the girls is that they dress like prostitutes and they are sexualizing them instead of treating them with self-respect.\"\n\nThe high school principal later admitted showing the clips was a poor choice."
