        "text": "If there's one thing that gets you locked into any movie, it's a good monologue - especially from a woman. From the iconic America Ferrera feminist speech in Barbie, to the downright emotional words of Viola Davis in Fences, some of the best films find that their greatest moments come from a few expertly delivered lines, that instantly have us all weeping / laughing / cheering.\n\nTo save you the trouble, we've compiled a list of the best monologues from women in movies, and they're all absolutely sensational. Whether you're after something comedic or empowering, or short and sweet, we have the monologue for you.\n\nThe best movie monologues from female characters\n\n1.Barbie (2023) - American Ferrera as Gloria\n\nMonologue: “It is literally impossible to be a woman. You are so beautiful, and so smart, and it kills me that you don't think you're good enough. Like, we have to always be extraordinary, but somehow we're always doing it wrong.\n\n\"You have to be thin, but not too thin. And you can never say you want to be thin. You have to say you want to be healthy, but also you have to be thin. You have to have money, but you can't ask for money because that's crass. You have to be a boss, but you can't be mean. You have to lead, but you can't squash other people's ideas. You're supposed to love being a mother, but don't talk about your kids all the damn time. You have to be a career woman but also always be looking out for other people. You have to answer for men's bad behaviour, which is insane, but if you point that our, you're accused of complaining. You're supposed to stay pretty for men, but not so pretty that you tempt them too much or that you threaten other women because you're supposed to be a part of the sisterhood.\n\n\"But always stand out and always be grateful. But never forget that the system is rigged. So find a way to acknowledge that but also always be grateful. You have to never get old, never be rude, never show off, never be selfish, never fall down, never fail, never show fear, never get out of line. It's too hard! It's too contradictory and nobody gives you a medal or says thank you! And it turns out in fact that not only are you doing everything wrong, but also everything is your fault.\n\n\"I'm just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us. And if all of that is also true for a doll just representing women, then I don't even know.\"\n\n2. Everything Everywhere All At Once (2022) - Stephanie Hsu as Jobu Tupaki\n\nMonologue: \"I got bored one day - and I put everything on a bagel. Everything. All my hopes and dreams, my old report cards, every breed of dog, every last personal ad on craigslist. Sesame. Poppy seed. Salt. And it collapsed in on itself. 'Cause, you see, when you really put everything on a bagel, it becomes this....\n\n\"Do you know why I actually built the bagel? It wasn't to destroy everything. It was to destroy myself. I wanted to see if I went in, could I finally escape? Like, actually die. At least this way... I don't have to do it alone.\"\n\n3. Little Women (2019) - Saoirse Ronan as Jo March\n\nMonologue: \"If I was a girl in a book this would all be so easy. Just give up the world happily. I've always been quite content with my family, I don't understand it. Perhaps I was too quick in turning him down, Laurie. If he asked me again I think I would say yes. Do you think he'll ask me again? I care more to be loved, I want to be loved. I just feel like women, they have minds and they have souls as well as just hearts. And they've got ambition and talent as well as just beauty, and I'm so sick of people saying love is all a woman is fit for. I'm so sick of it, but I'm so lonely.\"\n\n4. Little Women (2019) - Florence Pugh as Amy March\n\nMonologue: \"Well, I'm not a poet, I'm just a woman. And as a woman I have no way to make money, not enough to earn a living and support my family. Even if I had my own money, which I don't, it would belong to my husband the minute we were married. If we had children they would belong to him, not me. They would be his property. So don't sit there and tell me that marriage isn't an economic proposition, because it is. It may not be for you but it most certainly is for me.\"\n\n5. Queen and Slim (2019) - Jodie Turner-Smith as Queen\n\nMonologue: \"I want a guy to show me myself. I want him to love me so deeply that I'm not afraid to show how ugly I can be. I want him to show me scars I never knew I had. But I don't want him to make them go away, I want him to hold my hand while I nurse them myself. I want him to cherish the bruises they leave behind.\"\n\nWATCH NOW\n\n6. Gone Girl (2014) - Rosamund Pike as Amy Dunne\n\nMonologue: \"Cool girl. Men always use that, don’t they? As their defining compliment. She’s a cool girl. Cool girl is hot. Cool girl is game. Cool girl is fun. Cool girl never gets angry at her man. She only smiles in a chagrin loving manner and then presents her mouth for f***ing. She like what he likes. So, evidently, he’s a vinyl hipster who loves fetish monger. If he likes girls gone wild, she’s a mall babe who talks football and endures buffalo wings at Hooters.\n\n\"When I met Nick Dunne, I knew he wanted a cool girl and for him, I’ll admit, I was willing to try. I wax stripped my pussy raw. I drank canned beer watching Adam Sandler movies. I ate cold pizza and remained a size 2. I blew him… semi regularly. I lived in the moment. I was fucking game. I can’t say I didn’t enjoy some of it… Nick teased out in my things I didn’t know existed. A lightness, a humour, an ease.\n\n\"But I made him smarter, sharper, I inspired him to rise to my level. I forged the man of my dreams. We were happy pretending to be other people. We were the happiest people we knew. And what’s the point of being together if you’re not the happiest. But Nick got lazy. He became someone I did not agree to marry. He actually expected me to love him unconditionally then he dragged me, penniless, to the naval of this great country and found himself a newer, younger, bouncier cool girl.\n\nYou think I’d let him destroy me and end up happier than ever? No fucking way. He doesn’t get to win. My cute, charming, salt of the earth misery guy. He needed to learn. Grown ups work for things. Grown ups pay. Grown ups suffer consequences.\"\n\nWATCH NOW\n\n7. Manchester By The Sea (2016) - Michelle Williams as Randi Chandler\n\nMonologue: \"Could we ever have lunch? Because I said a lot of terrible things to you. I know you never... Maybe you don't want to talk to me. However my heart was broken. It's always going to be broken. I know yours is broken too. But I don't have to carry it. I said things that I should f***ing burn in hell for to you. I'm sorry. I love you. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Honey I see you walking around here and I just want to tell you. I don't want to torture you, but I just want to tell you that I was wrong.\"\n\n8. The Devil Wears Prada (2006) - Meryl Streep as Mirana Priestly\n\nMonologue: \"This 'stuff'? Oh, ok. I see, you think this has nothing to do with you. You go to your closet and you select out, oh I don’t know, that lumpy blue sweater, for instance, because you’re trying to tell the world that you take yourself too seriously to care about what you put on your back. But what you don’t know is that that sweater is not just blue, it’s not turquoise, it’s not lapis, it’s actually cerulean.\n\n\"You’re also blindly unaware of the fact that in 2002, Oscar de la Renta did a collection of cerulean gowns. And then I think it was Yves St Laurent, wasn’t it, who showed cerulean military jackets? And then cerulean quickly showed up in the collections of eight different designers. Then it filtered down through the department stores and then trickled on down into some tragic 'casual corner' where you, no doubt, fished it out of some clearance bin.\n\n\"However, that blue represents millions of dollars and countless jobs and so it’s sort of comical how you think that you’ve made a choice that exempts you from the fashion industry when, in fact, you’re wearing the sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room. From a pile of 'stuff'.\"\n\n9. Hidden Figures (2016) - Taraji P. Henson as Katherine Goble\n\nMonologue: \"There’s no bathroom for me here. There is no bathroom. There are no coloured bathrooms in this building. Or any building outside the West Campus, which is half a mile away. Did you know that? I have to walk to Timbuktu just to relieve myself. And I can’t use one of the handy bikes. Picture that, Mr. Harrison. My uniform. Skirt below my knees, my heels, and a simple string of pearls. Well, I don’t own pearls. Lord knows you don’t pay coloured enough to afford pearls! And I work like a dog, day and night, living off of coffee from a pot none of you wanna touch. So, excuse me if I have to go to the restroom a few times a day.\"\n\n10. Legally Blonde (2001) - Reese Witherspoon as Elle Woods\n\nMonologue: \"On our very first day at Harvard, a very wise Professor quoted Aristotle: 'The law is reason free from passion.' Well, no offence to Aristotle, but in my three years at Harvard I have come to find that passion is a key ingredient to the study and practice of law - and of life. It is with passion, courage of conviction, and strong sense of self that we take our next steps into the world, remembering that first impressions are not always correct. You must always have faith in people. And most importantly, you must always have faith in yourself.\"\n\n11. Erin Brokovich (2000) - Julia Roberts as Erin Brokovich\n\nMonologue: \"Oh, see, now that pisses me off. First of all since the demur, we now have more than four hundred plaintiffs and let’s be honest, we all know there’s more out there. Now, they may not be the most sophisticated people, but they do know how to divide, and twenty million dollars isn’t shit when it’s split between them. And second of all, these people don’t dream about being rich. They dream about being able to watch their kids swim in a pool without worrying they’ll have to have a hysterectomy at age 20, like Rosa Diaz, a client of ours, or have their spine deteriorate like Stan Bloom, another client of ours.\n\n\"So before you come back here with another lame ass offer, I want you to think real hard about what your spine is worth, Mr. Buda, or what you’d expect someone to pay you for your uterus, Ms. Sanchez, then you take out your calculator and multiply that number by a hundred. Anything less than that is a waste of our time.\"\n\n12. Fences (2016) - Viola Davis as Rose Maxson\n\nMonologue: \"I been standing with you! I been right here with you, Troy. I got a life too. I gave several years of my life to stand in the same spot with you. Don’t you think I ever wanted other things? Don’t you think I had dreams and hopes? What about my life? What about me. Don’t you think it ever crossed my mind to want to know other men? That I wanted to lay up somewhere and forget about my responsibilities? That I wanted someone to make me laugh so I could feel good?\n\n\"You not the only one who’s got wants and needs. But I held on to you, Troy. I took all my feelings, my wants and needs, my dreams…and I buried them inside you. I planted a seed and waited and prayed over it. I planted myself inside you and waited to bloom. And it didn’t take me no eighteen years to find out the soil was hard and rocky and it wasn’t never gonna bloom.\n\n\"But I held on to you, Troy, I held you tighter. You was my husband. I owed you everything I had. Every part of me I could find to give you. And upstairs in that room…with the darkness falling in on me…I gave everything I had to try and erase the doubt that you wasn’t the finest man in the world, and wherever you was going…I wanted to be there with you. Cause you was my husband. Cause that’s the only way I was gonna survive as your wife. You always talking about what you give…and what you don’t have to give. But you take too. You take…and don’t even know nobody’s giving.\"\n\nWATCH NOW\n\n13. Dirty Dancing (1987) - Jennifer Grey as Frances 'Baby' Houseman\n\nMonologue: \"I told you I was telling the truth Daddy. I’m sorry I lied to you. But you lied too. You told me everyone was alike and deserved a fair break. But you meant everyone who was like you. You told me you wanted me to change the world, make it better. But you meant by becoming a lawyer or an economist and marrying someone from Harvard. I’m not proud of myself, but I’m in this family too and you can’t keep giving me the silent treatment. There are a lot of things about me that aren’t what you thought. But if you love me, you have to love all the things about me. And I love you, and I’m sorry I let you down, I’m so sorry Daddy. But you let me down too.\"\n\n14. Miss Congeniality (2000) - Sandra Bullock, Young Gracie\n\nMonologue: \"I would have to say, I used to be one of them. And then I came here and I realised that these women are smart, terrific people who are just trying to make a difference in the world. We've become really good friends. I know we all secretly hope the other one will trip and fall on her face - wait a minute! I've already done that! For me, this experience has been one of the most rewarding and liberating experiences of my life. And if anyone, anyone tries to hurt one of my new friends I would take them out. I would make them suffer so much, they'd wish they were never born. And if they ran, I would hunt them down.\"\n\n15. Kill Bill: Volume 1 (2003) - Lucy Liu as O-Ren Ishii\n\nMonologue: \"As your leader, I encourage you from time to time, and always in a respectful manner, to question my logic. If you're unconvinced that a particular plan of action I've decided is the wisest, tell me so, but allow me to convince you and I promise you right here and now, no subject will ever be taboo. Except, of course, the subject that was just under discussion. The price you pay for bringing up either my Chinese or American heritage as a negative is... I collect your f***ing head. Just like this f***er here. Now, if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the f***ing time!\"\n\n16. Bridesmaids (2011) - Kristen Wiig as Annie Walker\n\nMonologue: \"Lillian, this is not the you that I know! The you that I know would have walked in here and rolled your eyes and would have thought that this was completely over the top, ridiculous, and stupid! Look at this shower! Look at that f***ing cookie! Did you really think that this group of women was gonna finish that cookie? Really, and you know that reminds me actually; I never got a chance to try that fucking cookie!\"\n\n17. 10 Things I Hate About You (1999) - Julia Stiles as Kat Stratford\n\nMonologue: \"I hate the way you talk to me and the way you cut your hair. I hate the way you drive my car. I hate it when you stare; I hate your big dumb combat boots and the way you read my mind. I hate you so much it makes me sick; it even makes me rhyme. I hate the way you’re always right. I hate it when you lie. I hate it when you make me laugh, even worse when you make me cry. I hate it that you’re not around. And the fact that you didn’t call. But mostly I hate the way I don’t hate you, not even close, not even a little bit, not even at all.\"\n\n18. Clueless (1995) - Alicia Silverstone as Cher Horowitz\n\nMonologue: \"So, OK, like right now, for example, the Haitians need to come to America. But some people are all, 'What about the strain on our resources?' But it's like when I had this garden party for my father's birthday, right? I said RSVP because it was a sit-down dinner. But people came that, like, did not RSVP. So I was, like, totally buggin'. I had to haul ass to the kitchen, redistribute the food, squish in extra place settings. But, by the end of the day it was, like, the more the merrier!\n\n\"And so, if the government could just get to the kitchen, rearrange some things, we could certainly party with the Haitians. And in conclusion, may I please remind you that it does not say \"RSVP\" on the Statue of Liberty!\"\n\nWATCH NOW\n\n19. The Princess Diaries (2001) - Anne Hathaway as Mia Thermopolis\n\nMonologue: \"Hi, I, uh, hello. I'm Mia... It stopped raining...Oh. I'm really no good at speech-making. Normally, I get so nervous that I faint or run away; or sometimes I even get sick. But you really didn't need to know that. Um, but, I'm not say afraid anymore...no. My father helped me. Earlier this evening, I had every intention of giving up my claim to the throne. And my mother helped me by telling me that it was ok, and by supporting me like she has my entire life.\n\n\"But, then I wondered how I'd feel after abdicating my role as Princess of Genovia. Would I feel relieved? Or would I feel sad? And then I realised how many stupid times a day I used the word 'I'. In fact, probably all I ever do is think about myself. And how lame is that when there's, like, seven billion other people out there on the planet.\n\n\"But then I thought, if I cared about the other seven billion out there instead of just me, that's probably a much better use of my time. See, if I were Princess of Genovia then my thoughts and the thoughts of people smarter than me would be much better heard, and just maybe those thoughts could be turned into actions. So this morning when I woke up I was Mia Thermopolis. But, now, I choose to be forevermore, Amelia Mignonette Thermopolis Renaldi.\"\n\n20. Hustlers (2019) - Jennifer Lopez as Ramona\n\nMonologue: \"Look, baby, we gotta start thinking like these Wall Street guys. You see what they did to this country? They stole from everybody. Hardworking people lost everything. And not one of these douchebags went to jail. Not one. Is that fair? You ever think about when they come into the club? That's stolen money. That's what's paying for their blow jobs. The f***ing firefighters retirement fund. F*** these guys.\"\n\n21. Marriage Story (2019) - Laura Dern as Nora Fanshaw\n\nMonologue: \"Don’t ever say that. People don’t accept a mother who drinks too much wine and yells at her child and calls him an asshole. I get it. I do it too. We can accept an imperfect Dad. Let’s face it, the idea of a good father was only invented like 30 years ago. Before that fathers were expected to be silent and absent and unreliable and selfish and we can all say that we want them to be different but on some basic level we accept them, we love them for their fallibilities. But people absolutely don't accept those same failings in mothers.\n\n\"We don't accept it structurally and we don't accept it spiritually because the basis of our Judeo-Christian Whatever is Mary Mother of Jesus and she’s perfect. She’s a virgin who gives birth, unwaveringly supports her child, and holds his dead body when he’s gone. But the Dad isn’t there. He didn’t even do the f***ing because God’s in heaven. God is the father and God didn't show up so you have to be perfect and Charlie can be a f*** up and it doesn't matter. You’ll always be held to a different, higher standard and it’s f***ed up, but that’s the way it is.\"\n\nWATCH NOW\n\n22. A Cinderella Story (2004) - Hilary Duff as Samantha Montgomery\n\nMonologue: \"No, you listen. You turned out to be exactly who I thought you were. I never pretended to be somebody else. It's been me all along. And it was me who was hurt in front of everybody. Look, I didn't come here to yell at you, okay? I came to tell you that I know what it feels like to be afraid to show who you are. I was, but I'm not anymore. And the thing is, I really don't care what people think about me... because I believe in myself. And I know that things are gonna be okay. But even though I have no family, and no job, and no money for college... it's you that I feel sorry for.\"\n\nWATCH NOW\n\n23. Wild (2014) - Reese Witherspoon as Cheryl Strayed\n\nMonologue: “It took me years to be the woman my mother raised. It took me four years, seven months and three days to do it, without her. After I lost myself in the wilderness of my grief, I found my own way out of the woods. And I didn't even know where I was going until I got there, on the last day of my hike. Thank you, I thought over and over again, for everything the trail had taught me and everything I couldn't yet know.\n\n\"Now in four years, I'd cross this very bridge. I'll marry a man in a spot almost visible from where I was standing. Now in nine years, that man and I would have a son named Carver and a year later, a daughter named after my mother, Bobbi. I knew only that I didn't need to eat with my bare hands anymore. That seeing the fish beneath the surface of the water would be enough, that it was everything. My life, like all lives, mysterious, irrevocable, sacred, so very close, so very present, so very belonging to me. How wild it was, to let it be?\"\n\n24. Down With Love (2003) - Renée Zellweger as Barbara Novak\n\nMonologue: \"I’m not gonna storm out of here, Catch. And I’m not gonna admit that you got Barbara Novak to fall in love, because I’m not Barbara Novak. There is no Barbara Novak... And I didn’t fall in love with Zip Martin. I fell in love with Catcher Block. And that was a year ago, when for three and a half weeks, I worked as your secretary. I don’t expect you to remember me. I wasn’t a blonde then. But you did ask me out. And it broke my heart to say no, but I loved you too much. I couldn’t bear to become just another notch in your bedpost. With your dating habits, I knew that even if I was lucky enough to get a regular spot on your rotating schedule, I would never have your undivided attention long enough for you to fall in love with me. I knew I had to do something to set myself apart. I knew I had to quit my job as your secretary and write an international best-seller, controversial enough to get the attention of a New York publisher as well as Know magazine. But insignificant enough that as long as I went unseen, Know magazine’s star journalist would refuse to do a cover story about it. I knew that every time we were supposed to meet, you would get distracted by one of your many girlfriends and stand me up, and this would give me a reason to fight with you over the phone and declare that I wouldn’t meet with you for a hundred years.\n\n\"And then all I would have to do was be patient and wait the two or three weeks it would take for everyone in the world to buy a copy of my best-seller – and then I would begin to get the publicity I would need for you, to, one, see what I look like, and, two, see me denounce you in public as the worst kind of man. I knew that this would make you wanna get even by writing one of your exposés. And in order to do that, you would have to go undercover, assume a false identity and pretend to be the kind of man who would make the kind of girl I was pretending to be fall in love.\n\n\"And I knew that since I was pretending to be a girl who would have sex on the first date you would have to pretend to be a man who wouldn’t have sex for several dates. And in doing so, we would go out on lots of dates to all the best places and all the hit shows, until finally, one night, you would take me back to your place – that you were pretending was someone else’s – in order to get the evidence you needed to write your exposé, by seducing me until I said, ‘I love you.’\n\n\"But saying ‘I love you’ was also my plan. I just wanted to tell you the truth so that when you heard me say, ‘I love you’ you would know that I knew who you were, and you would know who I was. Then you, the great Catcher Block, would know that you’d been beaten at your own game by me, Nancy Brown, your former secretary. And I would have, once and for all, set myself apart from all the other girls you’ve known. All those other girls that you never really cared about, by making myself someone like the one person you really love and admire above all others: you! Then, when you realised that you had finally met your match, I would have, at last, gained the respect that would make you wanna marry me first and seduce me later. I just wanted you to hear all this from me before you heard it from your private eye.\"\n\n25. Requiem For A Dream (2001) - Ellen Burstyn as Sara Goldfarb"
