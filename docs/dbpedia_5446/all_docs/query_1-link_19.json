        "text": "2.1 White upper middle-class women and work\n\nThe White upper middle-class woman in the 1950s was considered to be civilly incapable, and her life was planned–from childhood onwards–according to a future inevitable marriage. Her dependence passed from father to husband, thus perpetuating the secondary and dependent condition of the female figure. The patriarchal society at that time was characterized by the submissive role of women toward the head of the family, which restricted them to the role of mother and housewife (Saffioti, 1976; Bassanezi, 2004; Martins-Suarez & Farias, 2017).\n\nThis patriarchal society sought to preserve “good customs” while keeping women away from the modernity arising from industrial development and innovation (Mittanck, 2017, p. 2). Thus, the possibility for women to have a career was unquestionable (Rocha-Coutinho, 1994; Almeida, 2014). According to Frasquete and Simili (2017), even with changes in the national scenario, the dominant female and femininity model was that of the wife and mother and/or the woman dedicated to the home. Being against the female social role of a caring mother and a wife dedicated to the family and household chores was an obstacle in the 1950s (Martins-Suarez & Farias, 2017).\n\nConsidering these traditional and patriarchal conceptions of the roles of White women at that time, they ended up being marginalized from the productive workforce (Saffioti, 1976). According to Andrade (2016), in 1950, only 13.6% of women were economically active according to data provided by the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística Demographic's Census. Working women generally engaged in the so-called female careers, e.g. teachers and nurses (Wallace, 2015). Frasquete and Simili (2017) conclude that the professional performance of Brazilian women at that period was in job positions that reaffirmed their role in the home, where they served their children and husband; in addition to household chores, women were also responsible for educating their children, sewing and embroidering, for example.\n\nAccording to Pinto (2017), in urban elites and middle classes, the woman's sacred place was the home, where she could play the role of a sanctified mother (at least considering the discourses of the ideal family) being prohibited from having a public life. Women were instructed to live in the society in order to serve the home and men; that is, female education reproduced the Catholic ideal of conceiving women as guardians of the home and destined for motherhood (Almeida, 2014).\n\nBassanezi (2004) adds that the natural vocation considered for women at that time would be motherhood and domestic life. Not adhering to this path would be against female nature. Furthermore, at that time, the maternal function was no longer just biological, but social and patriotic. Motherhood was the most valued role for women and aimed at for the development of the motherland and of future generations (Almeida, 2014).\n\nThis difference was also reflected in women's education: educated women were the ones who knew how to receive guests, obey their husbands, parents and brothers, dress appropriately, take good care of the family and knew how to behave in public. Education was not synonymous with educational background or professional activities, neither with an academic degree in any study field (Almeida, 2014).\n\nWoman's work was limited to the home borders, except for women who worked outside the home. According to Bourdieu (2010), the place culturally imposed on women is the inside, which guaranteed their invisibility. Therefore, leaving this patriarchal system, achieving financial independence through education and having a profession meant a break from culturally long-established agreements and could lead to social disorder (Almeida, 2014).\n\nThis way, the struggle of women from more privileged social classes was different from the issues raised by Black and the lower-class women, who worked long hours and received low wages, in addition to being responsible for the domestic work at home. The dissatisfaction of White women for being confined and subordinate in the household was seen by Black women as freedom (Hooks, 2000).\n\nThe next subtopic portrays the relationship between Black women and work.\n\n2.2 Black lower-class women and work\n\nBearing in mind that gender operates with other social categories, such as race, class, sexuality, religion and nationality, it is necessary to understand it from an intersectionality perspective (Santana, Rios, & Menezes, 2017). Thus, working with these categories is relevant to offer analytical tools to understand the articulation of multiple differences and inequalities (Piscitelli, 2008). For Teixeira, Oliveira and Carrieri (2020), race must be considered as a social phenomenon that up to now is the foundation of segregation and inequality in social relations.\n\nIn this sense, Mesquita, Teixeira and Silva (2020) argue that racial issues must also address the power relations that permeate society. Miranda (2019) points out that Black women are represented by the lowest tier of the social pyramid. Therefore, it is important to note that the situation of Black lower-class women was completely different from the condition of White women's; in addition, Black women must also face double discrimination–gender and race (Mesquita, Teixeira & Silva, 2020).\n\nWith this double burden, other forms of inequality operate together, giving rise to the term intersectionality, used for the first time by the jurist Crenshaw (1989) and understood as a combination of factors that lead to discrimination. Crenshaw's (1991) studies have shown that Black women suffer from these different modes of discrimination. Besides, most Black women face an increasing burden of poverty, which reduces their chance to move up the pyramid. Such scenario becomes more critical when considering the Brazilian context, in which these women still carry the legacy of slavery.\n\nWomen from lower social classes were never excluded from work. In the 1950s, working outside the home was accepted only from women belonging to the lowest tier of the social pyramid, in which the imperative of survival overlapped any prejudices or taboos (Pinto, 2017). In other words, Black women were part of the workforce, but occupied subordinate positions (Mesquita, Teixeira & Silva, 2020), i.e. job positions with bad working conditions, which include lowest-paying jobs, informal jobs and domestic work (Proni & Gomes, 2015).\n\nBlack women were better accepted in domestic works, which enabled them to provide for the whole family. The long working hours, which were part of most of Black women's lives, reproduced a pattern established during slavery. These women had all other aspects of their existence overshadowed by work. It was common for women to leave their youngest child in the care of eldest children or even elderly Black women that were no longer working. Their main priority should be work, which represented a guarantee of survival (Davis, 2016).\n\nIn addition, it has become natural, in a totally wrong way, to accept that Black people have more physical strength, which justifies their participation in activities that require tougher physical activity. Black women are considered “warriors” and “strong” and their bodies are still understood to be more resistant to pain (Teixeira, Oliveira & Carrieri, 2020, p. 65).\n\nAccording to Pinto (1953), when Black women begin to ascend socially, in addition to other common barriers to color regardless of gender, and to gender regardless of color, they find resistance to their social ascension as a way to perpetuate their subordinate status: Black women are often thought of as servants, performing household duties and having the lowest salaries (Miranda, 2019).\n\n5.1 Maria Luiza and the luck of getting married and having fun (?): rich, White and separated\n\nWe are living the life they chose for us and the only way to get out of this is to go crazy (Maria Luiza).\n\nMaria Luiza belonged to a wealthy family of coffee barons in São Paulo. She married Pedro and had their first child, Carlinhos. She moves to Rio de Janeiro with plans to open a restaurant with her husband. However, upon arriving in the city, she realizes that he was cheating on her and had disappeared with all the couple's money.\n\nIt is at this moment that Maria Luiza meets Adélia, who worked as a domestic worker. After having contact with the city of Rio de Janeiro, samba and bossa nova, Maria Luiza decides to stay in the city to put into practice the plan to open a restaurant, but with the idea of turning it into a music club. However, she had to face her father, who, upon discovering that her daughter had been abandoned by her husband, wanted her to return with him to São Paulo:\n\n- I want to transform the restaurant into a music club, a place where people want to meet and where there is live music.\n\n- No.\n\n- I want it too … No?\n\n- I don't want my daughter to live a miserable life here, ruining our reputation with a “music club”.\n\n- That's not it. It is much more than a music club or restaurant. I can already see it. You have to trust me. Please.\n\n- You are the one who needs to trust me. A family girl like you has to be in São Paulo, raising your child. […]\n\n- It's just that my whole life has always been about being Ademar's daughter, and then Pedro's wife. And now I'm going to be the poor widow? The poor little girl? No. I want to create my own identity, father. And I want no one to take that away from me. Understand? That's it.\n\n- We are going back to São Paulo now.\n\nMaria Luiza represents women who were against their natural vocation, or according to Bourdieu (2010) “naturalized women”, who belonged to private life, as dedicated mothers and housewives, as approached by Bassanezi (2004). It is clear that Maria Luiza's father wanted her to be a dependent person again. In addition, it shows how separation at that time marked women, leaving them in an inferior and submissive position. Maria Luiza's father does not accept that his daughter opens the music club and wants her to return to her role as daughter and mother in the private space of the home. The excerpt shows how upper-class women were restricted to the home, being prevented from participating in the public space (Almeida, 2014) and maintaining their social status (Saffioti, 1976; Martins-Suarez & Farias, 2017).\n\nHowever, contrary to the customs of that time, Maria Luiza decides to stay in Rio de Janeiro and open her music club, without any moral neither financial support from her father. She asks Adélia to work for her. With the plan in mind, she tries to find a personal loan to open the new venture and faces yet another discrimination:\n\n- I had a meeting with an accountant to check the papers for the club. Do you know what he said to me?\n\n- No.\n\n- No. Exactly that. Then I went to the bank to see if I could get a loan. They told me that because I am a woman I cannot start a business, nor get a loan without a man's signature (Maria Luiza in conversation with Adélia).\n\nIt can be seen how the performance of women in the public space, represented in the series, was limited. According to Bourdieu (2010), public space was destined for men, while women were restricted to the private, hidden, limited space of the home. Women needed authorization from their father or husband to engage in paid work because they were considered civilly incapable (Saffioti, 2004).\n\nEven so, Maria Luiza does not give up on her venture and invites Roberto, a music producer from Rio de Janeiro, to become a partner. And, once again, she realizes the prejudice for being a woman:\n\n- You are young, Maria. You are a beautiful woman. You're here, in Rio de Janeiro, single. Enjoy it. Just get to know the city. There are so many beautiful places here. Leave the boring part for the boys (Roberto's discourse to Maria).\n\nIt is interesting to notice some relevant aspects of this episode, whose title is Girls are not welcome. According to this excerpt, the man treats the woman in a childish way, asking her to “have fun” while he solves the “boring part”, which corroborates what Rocha-Coutinho (1994) affirms about the dominance of men's role in contrast to the women's, considered submissive. In addition, the report also illustrates that men must be obeyed and respected, while women are infantilized by their inability to think and act (Rago, 1985; Bassanezi, 2004; Tinkler, 2013).\n\nDespite the difficulties, Maria Luiza tells Adélia how uncomfortable she feels by repeating the role of her mother, who is restricted to the home and submissive to Maria Luiza's father. She decides to sell her wedding ring and fake her husband's (Pedro's) signature to get the loan. And she does not give up, even when suffering discrimination: Today I heard from three different men that I can't do what I want to because I am a woman (Maria Luiza in conversation with Adélia).\n\nWith the money in hand and after renovating the club, a heavy rain in Rio de Janeiro floods Maria Luiza's property before the inauguration. And Maria Luiza's first instinct is to give up. She then returns to her parents' home in São Paulo, and is pressured by her father to remarry:\n\n- Do you understand how lucky it would be if a boy like that agreed to marry you?\n\n- Marry?\n\n- It's time to get back to reality, Maria Luiza. You need to find a new husband. A decent one this time (Maria Luiza's conversation with her father).\n\nIt can be seen how upper-class women were destined for marriage; matrimonies maintained their social position and guaranteed their stability (Saffioti, 1976; Martins-Suarez & Farias, 2017; Mittanck, 2017). Thus, according to Maria Luiza's father, she needed to remarry as soon as possible for the maintenance of the family image, since she had been abandoned by her first husband.\n\nHowever, Maria Luiza did not feel that she belonged to that role. With the support of her mother, she returns to Rio de Janeiro, which goes against the social role of women at that time, as approached by Martins-Suarez and Farias (2017). She, then, looks for Adélia again, proposing a 50–50 partnership agreement. After getting a loan, Maria Luiza renovates the club once again and inaugurates it. With Thereza's help, she prepares an ad for magazine publication in order to promote the club Most Beautiful Thing. Her father, however, doesn't like the publication:\n\n- What was that ad in the magazine?\n\n- Did you see? Yes. I know it was a little bold, but look, the club is crowded every night, Dad.\n\n- I'm embarrassed.\n\n- I thought you could be proud.\n\n- Carlinhos just lost his father. Be the respectable mother he needs! (Conversation of Maria Luiza with her father on the phone).\n\nOn behalf of good customs, White women were assigned to the household, as daughters, wives and mothers. And it was this specific role that Maria Luiza's father wanted his daughter to play. One can also notice that motherhood was appreciated (Almeida, 2014), but this role should be exercised in the private space of the home: the role of “respectable mother.”\n\nFinally, in a conversation with Adélia, Maria Luiza complains about her role as a woman and realizes how she and Adélia belong to different worlds. The series shows how Maria Luiza always had a place to turn to (her parents' house) and how Adélia did not have that privilege. Adélia has always had to work to provide for herself and her family:\n\n- I wish I didn't have to worry about looking pretty and being well dressed.\n\n- I would find it wonderful to spend all day only thinking about lipstick and rice powder (Conversation between Maria Luiza and Adélia).\n\nTherefore, it is important to introduce herein the different women represented in this TV series.\n\n5.2 Adélia and the intersection of roads: poor, Black and domestic worker\n\nFighting for your right to work? I've been working since I was eight years old. My grandmother was born in a slave quarter and it is just tough. It's really tough (Adélia).\n\nAdélia is a Black woman living in a slum, who fights daily against racism and works seven days a week to provide for her younger sister Ivone and daughter Conceição. Adélia hides the fact that Conceição was conceived during her relationship with the son of her former employer, and not during the long relationship with the musician Captain.\n\nIn the plot, after the discovery of Adélia's relationship with her son, the ex-boss sends her son to Europe before he even knew about the pregnancy in order to break them up and fire Adélia. After having the baby, Adélia transfers the fatherhood to the figure of the Captain, a musician with whom she starts a relationship during the plot.\n\nAt the beginning of the plot, Adélia worked as a maid in an apartment in the same building where Maria Luiza's husband lived before his disappearing. She experienced discrimination of her employer on a daily basis. The series features scenes in which Adélia is repressed for using the social instead of the service elevator and for taking her daughter to work:\n\n- Look who decided to show up. And chatting in the lobby, like a queen. They complain when we call them lazy. And you brought the girl again. […] Adélia, you've been working for me for two years and you know how generous I am. I don't force you to sleep here. I let you take my clothes home to get them washed. And I even give you Sundays off (Employer talking to Adélia).\n\nAdélia represents female domestic workers, which was the service considered as an opportunity for lower-class women due to the lack of preparation or qualification demanded by the profession. Most Black women from lower social classes turned to domestic work as a way to provide for their family (Bruschini & Puppin, 2004).\n\nSubsequently, Maria Luiza emphasizes her will to open a music club and invites Adélia to work with her. They start renovating and cleaning the space for the music club, but at a certain moment they lose everything they had due to a flood in the city of Rio de Janeiro before the launch of the club. Then, they had a serious discussion:\n\n- You are right, Malu. We are not the same. You've always had choices. Not me. (Adélia in conversation with Maria Luiza)\n\nIn this discussion, the difference and distance between Malu and Adélia is clear, as presented by Saffioti (1976) and Rocha-Coutinho (1994). Malu returns to her parents' home in São Paulo, while Adélia must return to her job as a domestic worker to provide for her family. She faces discrimination again:\n\n- Adélia! What are you doing here?\n\n- Miss Regina, I went to the greengrocer as you asked.\n\n- But what are you doing here in the social elevator?\n\n- Ah, it's because the service elevator is still under maintenance. I was just putting the groceries here, then I'd use the stairs.\n\n- You can't put that here, the neighbors will complain.\n\n- But the apartment is on the ninth floor, do you want me to go upstairs with all these groceries?\n\n- If I had your arms, I would have taken them myself.\n\nThis scene illustrates the fact that Black women are considered strong and resistant; therefore, one expects them to be mostly necessary in activities that require more physical strength, as approached by Teixeira, Oliveira & Carrieri (2020).\n\nAnother portrait of Adélia's reality reveals that she did not know how to read or write. According to Pinto (1953), the census revealed that in Rio de Janeiro, in the 1950s, 54.08% of Black women were illiterate. The fragile economic situation of lower-income families led to the premature use of the child labor either in the domestic work or on the streets as vendors; such reality takes away the opportunity for better jobs.\n\nThe first time that Lígia goes to the music club represents and reinforces the discrimination experienced by lower class (and mainly Black): they were only seen as individuals that must serve upper-class women. According to Davis (2016), when Black women start to ascend the social ladder, they find resistance to their social ascension as a way to perpetuate their subordinate status.\n\n5.3 Lígia and the dream of singing: rich, married and high society\n\n[…] we know that women have to choose between children and their career (Lígia).\n\nLígia is forced by her husband to represent the image of the traditional woman belonging to a patriarchal society, who is restricted to the private space of the household and must play the role of living in the ideal family while being prohibited from having a public life, as cited by Pinto (2017). Considered the “family girl” of that time (Bassanezi, 2004) and despite having studied music, Lígia is forbidden by her husband, Augusto, to become a singer in order to avoid ruining the family's “reputation.” Augusto is against the woman's right to a job, which becomes evident during a conversation with his brother Nelson:\n\n- Do you need money, Nelsinho?\n\n- What do you mean, man?\n\n- Then why are you letting your wife work? Is that right?\n\n- Augusto, you know that we have very different views on what is right and wrong. Thereza owns herself, man. I am not the one who will tell her what to do or not.\n\nAt that time, women should ask for the authorization of the husband or father in order to engage in remunerated activities (Saffioti, 2004). In the first scene in which Ligia asks her husband for permission to sing, he gives her a slap in the face:\n\n- I passed an audition to sing next week. […] Honey, that's what I want to do. Doesn't Grace Kelly help the Prince of Monaco? Let me sing at your political rally, will you?? (Augusto answers her with a slap in the face).\n\nAfter this episode, Augusto still manages to make Lígia feel guilty for the event, for having disobeyed and displeased her husband:\n\n- It was my fault. I always knew that you don't like me singing.\n\n- Help me to treat you the way you deserve.\n\nLigia's relationship with her husband in the series illustrates how women were submissive and inferior to the husband (Azambuja, 2006). However, in addition to trying to let go of music because of him, Lígia cannot give up on her dream of becoming a singer. At the inauguration of Most Beautiful Thing, Lígia ends up being invited by Maria Luiza to sing and, while she is performing, her husband arrives at the club:\n\n- Wow! Bravo, Liginha. Bravo. What a beautiful performance. You really look like a beautiful singer.\n\n- Please, Augusto …\n\n- From a brothel. A beautiful whore. If you go on that stage again, you will never step on my house ever again (Lígia's conversation with Augusto).\n\nAfter this event, Augusto once again attacks Lígia, but is interrupted by Maria Luiza, who bans him from the place. Lígia then goes back to the stage and does not return home, staying with Maria Luiza. The next day, after Lígia's presentation, the music critic Requião had his note published on the newspaper regarding the inauguration of the music club Most Beautiful Thing. Note that appeared at the inauguration of the music club Most Beautiful Thing appears in the newspaper. Requião mentions specifically Lígia's presentation:\n\n- About Lígia Soares there is not much to say. A somewhat vulgar girl, without much charisma, but with a beautiful pair of legs, which are her only noteworthy attributes.\n\nIt is important to note that Chico, considered the “new genius of music,” was the only one complimented in Requião's newspaper note, even though he was drunk, did not finish his presentation, and had to leave the stage for assaulting his producer. It is, therefore, possible to notice the discrimination faced by women, who are often objectified by men and considered incapable individuals.\n\nAfter the occurrence of these events, Lígia decides that she wants to pursue her career as a singer but discovers that she is pregnant with her husband's child. That's when she decided that her career was more important at that moment: […] we know that women have to choose between children and their career (Lígia's conversation with Thereza). For Lígia, it was necessary to make a choice between motherhood and career, and as mentioned by Almeida (2014), motherhood was the most valued role attributed to women, and it would be very difficult to reconcile motherhood with career.\n\nLígia then has an abortion in order to dedicate herself entirely to the career and signs the divorce papers sent by her mother-in-law; she experienced discrimination not only for being a divorced woman, but also for starting a singing career. When she goes to the club, for example, with Thereza and Maria Luiza, the club members feel uncomfortable with the presence of Lígia and Maria Luiza, as they did not have the behavior expected at that time for women (both without a husband and working individuals).\n\n5.4 Thereza and an open mind in a closed society: journalist, independent and feminist\n\nA magazine for women must be produced by women (Thereza).\n\nThereza is very different from Maria Luiza and Lígia, despite also having a higher social status. She is a woman who was not attached to the patriarchal customs of that time; she was against the social role attributed to women (Martins-Suarez & Farias, 2017). Thereza is the exception for having a career as a journalist, walking in the opposite direction of what was expected from women at that time (Pinto, 2017).\n\nSuch exception is attributed to her living in Paris with her husband, where they were influenced by European feminist movements that were already reshaping the role of women in the society through work and educational opportunities (Azambuja, 2006; Martins-Suarez & Farias, 2017). Thereza's husband had the same open mind about woman's role in the society and supported his wife. Thereza was a journalist and the only woman who worked for a women's magazine, the so-called Angela.\n\nIn one of the scenes, his boss asks Thereza to hire a new editor for the magazine, but Thereza was not finding a writer who met the company's profile and did not want to hire another male colleague:\n\n- Please, Thereza. It's not that hard. You don't have to be a genius to write like a woman. […]\n\n- Why do we need another man in this newsroom?\n\n- Simple: Biology. Men are more focused, more professional, less emotional. If you were a man, for example, we wouldn't be having this type of conversation.\n\nThe series illustrates the prejudice that Thereza faced in the workplace for being a woman, being considered inferior to her male colleagues (Azambuja, 2006), despite working for a women's magazine. When contacted by Helô, a girl who worked as a model and who was interested in becoming a reporter, Thereza used strategies of discrimination suffered by women, who earned lower salaries compared to men, to convince her boss to hire her, because, according to the dialog above, the boss only wanted to hire men:\n\n- This girl would cost you five times less. It is up to you.\n\n- Yes. I don't think it's going to hurt to have another skirt to decorate the room (Thereza and her boss).\n\nThis way, Thereza manages to hire Helô as part of the editorial staff of the magazine. After that, in a meeting with reporters to close the next issue of the magazine, Thereza suggests an article about women who were working on the construction of Brasília in order to highlight women who were invisible at the time; however, she is one more time discriminated by the group:\n\n- As there is still an article to complete the edition, my suggestion is to talk about these women who are working on the construction of Brasília. They are a third, a third of the workforce, and nobody says anything about them in the press. I interviewed this woman. She left Rio Grande do Norte driving a truck, seven months pregnant, to get there.\n\n- (laughs from magazine colleagues).\n\n- Is there a problem, Gustavo?\n\n[…]\n\n- It's ok. No woman is interested in that, Thereza.\n\n- Oh, no?\n\n- Only lesbian women will read this, guys (laughter from other colleagues).\n\n- What do you suggest then?\n\n- I do not know. Something related to fabric, to the new season, to trends. I don't know … Or maybe how to be as generous as your cleavage (laughter), something like that\n\nIt is possible to notice from the excerpt above how men had power over women's affairs. They wanted to write about the women they wanted to have at home, telling them how to behave, which emphasized a family model with predefined roles and with rules related to behavior and opinion about sexuality, marriage, youth, marital happiness, moral and good customs (Bassanezi, 2004). After the above-mentioned episode, Thereza's boss interrupts the conversation and suggests that the magazine should publish an article about Brasilia; however, addressing Miss Brasilia. For Helô, he suggested an article about the ideal outfit to wear on a first date.\n\nThe scene shows how the two women were embarrassed by the speech and attitude of their coworkers. In another scene, after the closing time, the male coworkers arrange a happy hour and neither Thereza nor Helô are invited. It is evident how the public space was occupied by men (Bourdieu, 2010) and how the women who occupied this space suffered prejudice and were excluded.\n\nThereza and Helô are the portrait of women's resistance; they wanted to conquer all spaces of the society (Azambuja, 2006). Through their work in the magazine, they seek to encourage women and eliminate the idea of submission, inferiority and the ideal role that women should play in the household. Despite being criticized by the boss, they tried to publish more feminist content in the magazine, such as: in the end, marriage is not a reward for your good behavior, even if your mother taught you that (Helô in one of the articles).\n\nWith regard to gender relations, the series illustrates how women were in a position of inferiority and submission in relation to men, as stated by Rocha-Coutinho (1994), Almeida (2014), Frasquete and Simili (2017), Martins-Suarez and Farias (2017). Maria Luiza and Lídia represent women who were stuck to their husbands/fathers and limited to the private space of the household; they were also prevented from engaging in any remunerated activity and had to play the role of mothers and wives/daughters. For them, marriage played a major role, as Mittanck (2017) points out, and when they wanted to break from this reality, they suffered discrimination and even violence.\n\nRegarding race relations, the series illustrates Adélia's difficulties, as she is a Black woman, poor, head of the household and single mother. Adélia had to work as a domestic worker all her life to provide for herself and her family; when she had the opportunity to ascend the social ladder, as a partner in the music club, she faced discrimination. According to Crenshaw (1991) and Proni and Gomes (2015), Black women had fewer job opportunities due to gender and race discrimination, in addition to the fact that they did not have access to a proper educational background nor professional training. Such reality relates to the legacy left by slavery in Brazil.\n\nRegarding the relationship among social classes, the series shows that the needs of women from more privileged classes are different from the issues faced by women from lower classes, for the latter group work was placed in a more prominent position. Some scenes illustrate the dissatisfaction of the character Adélia as being a domestic worker because she could not focus only on household activities; instead, she had to worry about providing for her family. For Hooks (2000), the confinement and subordination experienced by upper class women were seen by the less privileged women as freedom.\n\nIt is worth noting that women from the lowest social classes were never excluded from work. According to Pinto (2017), working outside the home in the 1950s was accepted for women belonging to the lowest tier of the social pyramid. Survival needs made women part of the workforce. The character Adélia represents these women.\n\nThereza, on the other hand, represents women who had the opportunity to get an education and even live outside Brazil, being influenced by feminist thoughts that criticized the traditional and patriarchal roles imposed on women by the society. Thereza worked as journalist in a predominantly male environment, as approached by Proni and Gomes (2015), in which she was discriminated daily in the workplace for being a woman.\n\nPlate 1 shows the spaces occupied by the four women represented in the TV series Most Beautiful Thing. The image shows Thereza at her workplace (top left image), the only woman in the newsroom (before she managed to hire Helô) surrounded by male colleagues. Lígia appears being protographed for her husband's electoral campaign (bottom left image), trying to put aside the dream of being a singer and pass on the image of a “family woman”, the wife of a politician. Malu is illustrated during her arrival in a new city–Rio de Janeiro–(top right image), dealing with her husband's abandonment and fighting for the right to work in the music club. And Adélia (bottom right image), who had a different lifestyle in comparison with the other women of the series, had to work her whole life in order to survive and provide for her family.\n\nThe series takes place in the late 1950s but brings up issues that are recurrent up to now. Today, it is possible to perceive women's advances with regard to the access to the labor market and access to education (Bruschini & Puppin, 2004; Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística, 2018), as well as access to civil rights, considering that the 1988 Federal Constitution of Brazil established equal rights and obligations between men and women. Despite these advances, women today still face inequalities and discrimination due to the accumulated historical legacy of slavery and to the civil incapacity attributed to them (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística, 2018).\n\nThe labor market is one of the spaces in which these inequalities are still present. Women receive lower salaries, fail to reach to management positions and, when they do, they experience discrimination. Women are still the minority in power-related environments and are still generally the ones responsible for household activities and caring for the family (Bruschini & Puppin, 2004; Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística, 2018)."
