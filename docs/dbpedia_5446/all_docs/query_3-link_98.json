        "text": "It’s that time of year when the airwaves are filled with the spooky and the macabre, including horror films filled with religious imagery.\n\nWhy is religion so popular in movies designed to frighten us?\n\n“It seems like religion always gives us a way to deal with things most mysterious, fearful and fright-inducing in our lives,” said Andrew Rudd, an associate professor of communications at Malone University. “It makes sense that some of the symbols of iconography that give us hope are a natural fit for those (films).\n\n“There’s another level at which the makers of horror films recognize the mythological significance of crosses and of blood. If you think about it, the Christian story has some pretty gruesome and horrific elements.”\n\nCraig Joseph, a local artist and former pastor who studied theater and film at Northwestern University, said the horror film is one the genres “where it’s still safe to talk about spiritual matters without it offending someone, which is kind of ironic.”\n\nBLACK AND WHITE\n\n“Horror films are some of the most moral films out there, because I think more than any other, it’s the genre where you can have clear good and evil, black and white, without the gray,” he said. “Also, it’s one of the only genre that gives credence to the idea that there is a supernatural world. Because of that, you can get away with talking about religion and spiritual and invisible things more than any other genre.”\n\nJoseph said that in a postmodern society where relativity rules, horror films are less ambiguous.\n\n“In horror movies, you need a good guy and bad guy,” he said. “In a lot of them, hopefully, good wins and evil is vanquished ... So much of horror movies is inexplicable, the supernatural, why a serial killer is doing what he/she is doing, how to get the thing to stay dead.\n\n“I believe the characters have to turn to something for aid that they might not turn toward, all things being equal. Hence, religion and the symbols. I think this happens in real life, too, when folks are confronted with uncertainty and fear. Horror movies just show that in extremes.”\n\nSOMETHING WICKED\n\nIn his book, “Through a Screen Darkly: Looking Closer at Beauty, Truth and Evil in the Movies,” film critic Jeffrey Overstreet writes that horror movies often reflect our unspoken fears.\n\n“The horror we feel in films like ‘Alien,’ ‘The Thing,’ ‘Slither,’ ‘28 Days Later’ and ‘The Shining’ is really about our fear that the entities on whom we depend will suddenly morph into something dangerous,” he writes. “These types of films exploit our notion that our own human resources are not enough to save us. God does not intervene in the world they portray, nor are there many signs of hope. Most suggest that the world is just as the former reverend in ‘Signs’ declares that it is: ‘There’s no one looking out for us. We are all alone.’ ”\n\nOverstreet further states that while horror films can contain messages of value, people should exercise caution:\n\n“Horror movies can sometimes scare us with something darker that the familiar progression from sin to consequences,” he writes. “Just as art can encourage our faith in supreme benevolence and reveal the grander designs of our lives, so it can pull back the veil on more troubling realities. There is more at work in our world than mere human misbehavior.\n\n“The horror artist walks a dangerous path when approaching this subject. The success of the ‘X-Files’ wasn’t a fluke. We’re fascinated by the paranormal. Even responsible portrayals of spiritual darkness will draw those with an unhealthy curiosity about supernatural evil. Like foolish children coaxed into danger, they head out into the forest at night with flashlights, thrilled at the possibility of glimpsing some menace. The menace is real, and so are its claws. And if we tempt it, something wicked this way will come.”\n\nBLOOD & GORE\n\nRudd said many people’s earliest frights come by way of Bible stories from the Old Testament or the details of Jesus’ crucifixion.\n\n“In my case, it was apocalyptic literature and the end-times movies and books, that I grew up on,” he said. “I found them terrifying.”\n\nJoseph agrees, noting that the central event of Christianity is Jesus’ crucifixion, and the central symbol of the faith is blood.\n\n“To many people that’s horrifying,” he said. “We talk about ‘eating his body’ and ‘drinking his blood.’ There are some touch points in terms of horror movies, which are very much about harm to the body. The same thing people (complained) about ‘Friday the 13th’ is what they said about Mel Gibson’s ‘Passion of the Christ’: The blood, the gore and a guy being impaled.”\n\nBut Joseph said anything that requires imagination is helpful in fostering belief in an invisible reality, such as God.\n\n“It’s one of the reasons why ghost stories fairy tales or even tales of magic are important for kids to hear growing up,” he said. “Often some Christian people want to shut that down, and you have to be careful with anything. Obviously, I’m not advocating that a 5-year-old watch (horror films). But anything that fosters children’s imagination is helpful because it fosters their ability to believe in a world beyond what they can see and touch.”\n\nThough he’s not a horror-film aficionado, Rudd liked ‘The Exorcism of Emily Rose.”\n\n“The guy who made that film is a Christian and is very interested in Christian theology through the language of film,” he said. “Horror gave him the ability to express it.\n\n“I’m a movie snob, but I’ll watch the worst horror movies,” Joseph said, laughing."
