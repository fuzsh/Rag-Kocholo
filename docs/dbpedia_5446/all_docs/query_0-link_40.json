        "text": "'PRETTY WOMAN' TRAILER\n\nThe greatest thing about 'Pretty Woman' is its universal appeal. Last week, a miracle happened. I popped on 'Pretty Woman' and after watching for a few moments... my boyfriend joined me on the couch to watch. Now, I'm going to put it down to great writing, and not a 21-year-old Julia Roberts. The writing, the dialogue, the onscreen chemistry is perfect down to a T. When you read up on 'Pretty Woman,' the anecdotes and stories on set are fun, with Marshall making room for improv and even pranks. The great thing about having a close cast and crew is that the creation of the film becomes fun - and it totally translates. Right down to the non-scripted moment where Gere closes the Harry Winston box on Roberts' hand, perhaps the most poignant moment of the movie.\n\nThe film is cheeky whilst also leaving room for audiences to say \"awwww\". It plays with double entendre, sex, pun and pure wit. It doesn't shy away from being politically correct, and displays Vivian as strong and knowing what she wants. It's an allegory for all the women who easily get looked over - but, also for the men who think they're doing the right thing. It's so progressive for its time.\n\nGoing back to its reach, 'Pretty Woman' is the film for mothers and daughters, partners, friends, even dudes. Its credibility is solidified by the fact that, even today, it plays on Friday night TV and still makes you laugh. It doesn't beat around the bush, it's honest, and its message extends to the humanity of ladies of the night. The fact that this film gets me so excited (I could almost pee my pants) 30 years on is a testament to its great story, characters and filmic fun."
