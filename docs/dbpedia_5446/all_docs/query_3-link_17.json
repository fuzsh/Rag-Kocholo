        "text": "Many can relate to the classic instance in which a young child does a strange act, such as body slamming his brother like John Cena, with the parent knowing exactly where he learned it from: his favorite television show or movie. Let’s face it: children are smarter than we often give them credit for. They observe the patterns and themes they see in movies and other media, using them to draw conclusions about the world around them. At surface-level, this is not necessarily bad. There is nothing wrong about learning something from an electronic source, even if it is only a wrestling move. However, the issue with these conclusions and simplifications arises when they are applied to more complex themes: the ones that cannot be adequately outlined …show more content…\n\nThis villain is usually portrayed as a woman with warts, scars, wrinkles, acne, or other abnormal facial features. For instance, in Snow White, Queen Grimhilde is obsessed with beauty and is angry that Snow White is prettier than her, which drives her to try and kill her own daughter. By showing a less-beautiful woman’s jealousy of a “fairer” woman, Disney conveys the message that less attractive people are evil and jealous of beautiful people. Another example of these traits is shown by the stepsisters in Cinderella, who have large noses and grouchy faces, and are fittingly dubbed the “ugly stepsisters”. These girls are jealous of Cinderella, a prettier girl, so they actively try to hinder her success. This is another example of the false notion that ugly people are jealous of pretty people, which is problematic because it is another inaccurate generalization about an entire group of people. Since many children make assumptions using the information that is constantly presented to them, some might falsely assume that these traits are associated with evil people, which could make girls with these characteristics feel judged for their features. This adds further pressure to these girls because, coupled with already being insecure about not looking like a princess, they now have to worry that they are evil because they possess the same physical traits as the …show more content…\n\nThis is shown in the movie Sleeping Beauty, in which Aurora is only saved because of the prince’s physical attraction to her. Furthermore, this theme is presented in Cinderella, in which she improves her appearance in order to get Prince Charming, a man who has never even spoken to her, to search the entire kingdom to marry and save her from her family. Although there is nothing wrong with being beautiful or needing help, making external beauty a primary ambition is dangerous for young girls. Some might falsely assume that beauty is the most important trait to have, since many movies are centered around this idea. If girls believe that they need to be beautiful in order to be valuable in society, this could cause them to feel even more insecure about their appearances if they do not look like their favorite princesses. Furthermore, beautiful girls might never try to improve any other skills if they believe that beauty is all they need, which might not yield happy and fulfilling lives for them, contrary to their animated"
