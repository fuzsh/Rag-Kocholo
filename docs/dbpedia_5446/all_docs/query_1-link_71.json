        "text": "“Not only are the movies little tiny pieces of time that we never forget, the movies are little tiny pieces of time that we live through. When we watch movies, we aren’t just bearing witness to history, we’re making history of our own — through decisions and events and circumstances that take place as part of the overall moviegoing experience.” Jimmy Stewart\n\nComprised of moments taken entirely from hundreds of the greatest films of all time, visionary Hungarian director György Pàlfi tells a single story of a man and a woman. To make this astonishing cinematic feat, Pàlfi (Hukkle) devoted over three years in the editing room expertly blending genres, decades, countries, and stars into a unified whole. From Marilyn Monroe to Jackie Chan, from Ozu to Lynch, and from the 1920’s to the Millennium and back again, this incredible collection illustrates the history of romance as told by the movies.\n\nI’ve never seen anything like Final Cut; it’s like a straight hit of the primal, Jungian stuff—a plea to the part of our brain that is endlessly addicted to story, and glamor, and happiness.”\n\nPaul Constant, The Stranger"
