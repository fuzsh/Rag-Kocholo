        "text": "The cinematic lovechild of Ilana Glazer and Pamela Adlon is a raunchy exploration of pregnancy pitfalls, bonded women, and bodily fluid mishaps. Navigating early motherhood has rarely been so belly-laugh hilarious or filled with excellent nasty truth reveals about growing bodies inside our bodies.\n\nAfter witnessing the birth of her bestie Dawnâs second baby and then having a meet-cute on her commute, Eden (played by Glazer) finds herself learning firsthand everything she didnât know about pregnancy. Co-written by Glazer and Josh Rabinowicz, Pamela Adlonâs feature directorial debut â Babes â is as delightfully irreverent as fans of Adlonâs Better Things and Glazerâs Broad City could hope for. Loaded with positive affirmations and glorious examples of mothers as humans (moms like sex and mushrooms too), itâs a simple story that leans on the comedy expertise of its cast and crew. The filmâs goal isnât plot twists and mysterious subtext; itâs straightforward comedy iced with just enough emotion to keep it real.\n\nAt Saturdayâs SXSW world premiere, the Paramount Theatre audience roared with laughter from opening scene to end credits. (The cute stranger next to me was laughing so hard I was concerned for their health.) Statistically itâs likely that most reviews of this movie by women about women will be written by men, so normally weâd be concerned how that would affect distribution. Thankfully, the still unrated Babes was picked up by Neon, which means audiences everywhere will soon have the opportunity to enjoy this wild ride, too.\n\nGlazer holds down the filmâs fort with her signature antics, riotous wit, and âyes girlâ empowerment. Her co-lead, Michelle Buteau, shines as Dawn, a worthy counterpart whose in-labor crawl will likely prove as memorable as Maya Rudolphâs wedding dress street shit or Melissa McCarthyâs âhot lavaâ scene. If weâre calling 2011âs Bridesmaids the predecessor of Babes, letâs also acknowledge thatâs a clear indication the world deserves more extremely funny, female-centered, female-written, and female-directed comedies, pronto. Everyone poops, pregnancy is insane, and friendships evolve.\n\nOh yes, the filmâs men: Hasan Minhaj as Husband, John Carroll Lynch as OB/GYN, Oliver Platt as âDeadbeatâ Dad, and Stephan James as Lover are all wonderfully cast, each offering his own platform on which the co-leads riff and dance.\n\nDuring the post-screening Q&A, Adlon and Glazer continued producing laughs and maintained the âwomen support womenâ vibe. They noted the film was an inspired compilation of actual pregnancy experiences, but when asked âWhat truths about motherhood did you highlight in this film?â Adlon deadpanned âUh, what?â She continued: âWell itâs raw. You see all this same raw stuff in menâs comedies and we werenât trying to be salacious. Itâs important because we laugh so much as women and also as mothers it can be dark and scary.â The film's additional themes of consent, men needing validation, women as the unsung knights in shining armor, and legitimate mom fear â âlike a lion is chasing meâ â are intentional. And the Dawn-Eden duoâs charming dynamic? âIt makes me want to cry because that is womenâs friendship. Thatâs real.â\n\nBabes\n\nHeadliner, World Premiere\n\nMarch 9, 6:30pm, Paramount Theatre\n\nCatch up with all of The Austin Chronicle's SXSW 2024 coverage."
