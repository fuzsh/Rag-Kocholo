        "text": "Co-chair & CEO, Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group\n\nGreta Gerwig was halfway through shooting “Barbie” when Abdy and Mike DeLuca joined the studio (and share the same title), and while the exec soon saw its potential, she had no idea how big a cultural phenomenon it would become. “Every once in a while, something comes along that just ignites the audience,” says Abdy, who credits the filmmakers and studio’s marketing team for helping to make “Barbie” a monster success. “I remember going into the movie theater opening weekend, and honestly I burst into tears just seeing how many people were dressed in pink, how many people were in line and concessions were sold out.” It was, she says, “incredibly gratifying.”\n\nHead of AVOD Originals & Licensing; Unscripted and Targeted Programming, Amazon MGM Studios\n\nAnderson believed in Freevee’s reality-blurring “Jury Duty” from the start. But even she did not expect it to break through the way it did in April, going on to earn the renamed streamer’s first Emmy noms, including one for star James Marsden, who plays a heightened version of himself in the series. “I don’t think you can ever predict the type of cultural moment it has had,” says the broadcast vet of “Jury Duty.” Her biggest challenge in today’s entertainment environment: hooking viewers quickly amid greater than ever competition for viewer eyeballs. “That’s a huge hurdle,” says the former NBA exec. “That’s what keeps me up at night.”\n\nActor, “The Little Mermaid,” “The Color Purple”\n\nDisney’s live-action adaptation of “The Little Mermaid” introduced Bailey, already known for her singing with sister Chloe and acting on “Grown-ish,” to an even bigger worldwide audience. The second Black actor to become a Disney princess, she’s now an icon for young Black girls everywhere. “I want the little girl in me and the little girls just like me who are watching to know that they’re special, and that they should be a princess in every single way,” Bailey told Variety for a Young Hollywood cover story last year. Next up: starring in the upcoming Warner Bros. musical adaptation of Alice Walker’s “The Color Purple.”\n\nActor-writer-executive producer, “Abbott Elementary”\n\nThe star and creator of “Abbott Elementary” earned three more Emmy nominations this year, including one for her guest performance on “Saturday Night Live.” All told, Season 2 of the show about a Philadelphia primary school earned eight nominations, the most of any network comedy series, and one more than its first season. Brunson, who won a writing Emmy for Season 1, received her second consecutive Emmy nomination for acting this year. “Creatively, my favorite part of producing a show is being able to look at the bigger picture and fold everyone else’s talents and incredible ideas into that picture,” Brunson says.\n\nCostume designer, “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever”\n\nCarter made Oscar history in March when she became the first Black woman ever to win two Oscars, thanks to her costume design work on “Black Panther” and “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.” It was a big undertaking. “You’re not just painting and creating something,” she says. “It really did need to have an anchor in historical facts, as well as be in the super-hero realm.” Chronicle Books published “The Art of Ruth E. Carter,” which spans her entire career, in May. “I wanted to show people how I did what I did in the movies I have worked on throughout my career.”\n\nCo-president, Motion Picture Group, Paramount Pictures\n\nKnown for savvy and scalable taste in features of all budgets, Cercek oversaw four hits that put Paramount back in the game: “Scream VI,” “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,” ‘Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” and “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.” She also guided last year’s huge horror film “Smile” She’s midway through production on Ridley Scott’s “Gladiator 2,” and will soon oversee John Krasinski’s “If” starring Ryan Reynolds and revisit the “Sonic the Hedgehog” franchise. “I feel so fortunate that despite the challenges of the business and the world at large, we were able to tell great stories and give our filmmakers space to create and do their very best work,” Cercek says.\n\nSenior exec VP & chief human resources officer, the Walt Disney Co.\n\nPromoted to her role in April, Coleman has worked hard to advance diversity, equity and inclusion at Disney. “We continue to increase our executive level representation along all spectrums of underrepresentation,” Coleman says, mentioning women, racial and ethnic groups and the disability community among others. Aware of her impact as a prominent Black executive at Disney, she wants young women and women of color to understand their own value and potential: “Anybody can be in this chair, any Black girl, no matter where she is in the world, can be in this chair, if that’s what they so choose. And I want them to know that.”\n\nActor, “The White Lotus”\n\nAlready an Emmy-winner for the first season of “The White Lotus,” Coolidge launched a thousand memes with the plaintive line, “these gays, they’re trying to murder me,” in Season 2 of the HBO series and could score another trophy when the winners are revealed in January. Coolidge credits “White Lotus” creator Mike White, a pal, with believing in her abilities. “I have done one thing really right in my life,” she told Variety last year. “I’ve picked great friends.” Even if “White Lotus” was done as a play in a little theater, “it would still be one of the greatest things that ever happened to me.”\n\nBalian: President, FX Entertainment, FX\n\nBurke: President, 20th Television, Disney Television Studios\n\nRyan: President, marketing, Disney Entertainment Television\n\n20th TV president Burke has found success in placing new and returning series on a wide range of outlets — including Apple TV+’s most-watched limited series ever, “The Last Thing He Told Me,” and FX’s drama hit “The Old Man.” “I’m most proud of having supported the brilliant creator Liz Heldens to her long overdue, first ever series renewal with ABC’s ‘Will Trent,’” Burke says: “She has deserved it many times, but never more so than with this gem.” On the marketing side, Ryan, responsible for driving audiences to more than 200 titles across Disney’s many platforms, credits her team with doing “an incredible job pivoting and remaining flexible, being innovative and scrappy” the past year. Successes include “Abbott Elementary,” “The Golden Bachelor,” “Only Murders in the Building” and “The Kardashians.” FX president Balian oversaw the Emmy-nominated “Fleishman Is in Trouble,” as well as this fall’s “A Murder at the End of the World” and the fifth season of “Fargo.” While impressed by those at the company that rose to the occasion during the past year, she acknowledges that there has been plenty of hardship and strife due to disruption in the industry. “I truly believe we can come out of this stronger and better positioned to succeed together with our creative partners.”\n\nStockmal: Lead director, “Fox NFL Kickoff”\n\nMedina: Director, “Fox NFL Sunday”\n\nStockmal and Medina, two rare women in sports broadcasting, are entrusted with some of the highest-rating events on TV. Stockmal, who grew up in a sports-loving family, moved to Fox from NFL Network in 2013, working her way up to lead director on “Fox NFL Kickoff” and directing all the men’s and women’s FIFA World Cup pregame and postgame shows. “I’ve never categorized myself as a woman in a man’s industry. I always see myself as a production person who wants to be the best at what I do and prove myself in a sea of other production people,” says Stockmal. Medina, who joined the network in 2003, is one of the first women at Fox Sports to direct pre-and postgame shows for the NFL. “We keep the show fresh by adapting to the latest technology,” says Medina, who touts a last season’s set redesign and XR graphics that “can put our talent in literally any kind of environment.”\n\nExec VPs\n\nWhen Yacoubian began her booking career 15 years ago as a ticketing assistant at Goldenvoice, she met Vee, who had already been there for six years.\n\n“I definitely felt so lucky to have had such mentorship within the company to help me create my own path and my own goals,” Yacoubian tells Variety.\n\n“Jenn and I are yin and yang in a lot of ways,” Vee adds, “We both learn from each other so much, we have different work styles and expertise in different genres, but we come together and are like a whole. We’re able to accomplish so much together and represent so much on behalf of Goldenvoice just because of our broad knowledge base. We’re very strong together.”\n\nIn addition to helping to book Coachella, the exec VPs have their hands full, with Vee overseeing Stagecoach, the largest country music festival on the planet, as well as the Just Like Heaven festival in Pasadena, while Yacoubian oversees booking at the Shrine Auditorium and Pasadena’s Cruel World Festival.\n\n“I wake up every day, and Stagecoach is the first thing I think about,” Vee says. “I just don’t stop thinking about it.”\n\nAdds Yacoubian: “We never stop thinking of creative ideas and new concepts.”\n\nChair, entertainment labor, Loeb & Loeb\n\nA labor specialist, Kagan Bierman has been especially busy this past year helping clients navigate strike-related issues. “My concern right now is that we’re looking at an industrywide problem,” says the lawyer, who was around for the last WGA strike. “It is so critical for labor relations for there to be trust,” she says. “If you don’t have trust, not only is it hard to get these deals done, but after the deals are actually done, I foresee a lot of disputes over the interpretation of those deals, the implementation of those deals and the enforcement of those deals.”\n\nPresident of distribution, Universal Pictures Intl.\n\nWhen Kwan Vandenberg ended her 28-year run at Warner Bros. in 2018, she effectively retired. But, two years later, she put her power suit back on to join the team at Universal. “After a while, you think, OK, I still have something in me,” she says. Also, “I have always been an incredible admirer of [NBCU content boss] Donna Langley, and I was very excited to work for her.” This year, she oversaw the largest international release slate in the biz, toplined by Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer,” which helped the studio amass more than $3 billion in worldwide box office for the first time since 2019.\n\nGoldman: VP, global partnerships\n\nMattingly: Head of global media partnerships\n\nCazian: Head of strategic partnerships\n\nWhen Meta announced it was moving up the launch of its Twitter competitor Threads by a week to July 6, the marketing team sprang into action. Cazian and Mattingly slipped out of Fourth of July parties in Delaware and Malibu, respectively, and Goldman cut short her vacation in Mexico after just one day and hopped on a plane to Los Angeles, where she pitched the platform to a pair of players from the U.S. women’s soccer team seated next to her. “They were like, ‘We’re doing this thing about the World Cup,’ and I said, ‘You’ve got to use Threads,’” Goldman recalls. The team’s efforts paid off, helping helping Threads register 100 million users within a week of its July 5 launch. It’s just the latest in a long list of major launches for the Playa Vista-based trio (following Instagram, Instagram Stories, Reels, Facebook Live and Facebook Video), which works with public figures, creators and media execs at companies ranging from Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery to the NBA to create strategic partnerships across the Meta ecosystem. Recent campaigns include collabs with Universal on “Fast X” and the NFL on the Pro Bowl, and Instagram takeovers for “The Little Mermaid” and “Barbie.”\n\nEbong: VP overall deals, original series\n\nHowe: VP drama series\n\nLevy: VP unscripted series\n\nPakosta: VP comedy series\n\nThe TV development teams at most studios still need to feed the broadcast beast, but that’s not the case for this Netflix quartet. “There is freedom to do what’s best for the project versus having to stick to guidelines, whether it be time or even content for particular buyers where there is a very distinctive need or slot to fill,” says Pakosta, whose comedy purview includes both original series and standup specials such as “That ’90s Show,” “Never Have I Ever,” “Survival of the Thickest” and Netflix’s first-ever live event, “Chris Rock: Selective Outrage.” On the unscripted side, it gave Levy the ability to develop “The Ultimatum: Queer Love.” “It was a really great moment for our team and for me personally as a gay woman,” says Levy. As the exec overseeing the streamer’s overall deals, Ebong is able to draw upon the talents of Shonda Rhimes’ Shondaland (“Queen Charlotte”), Shawn Levy’s 21 Laps (“All the Light We Cannot See”) and Ryan Murphy (“Dahmer — Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story”). Howe, whose team developed some of Netflix’s biggest hits, including “Beef,” “The Diplomat” and “The Night Agent,” sums up their creative criteria thusly: “We are always looking for really a specific point of view, a bold voice.”\n\nCMO, Downtown Music Holdings\n\nNeuman became Downtown Music Holdings’ first CMO last year amid a four-year period of rapid growth, as the company blossomed into a 600-person global network with hubs in Los Angeles, Nashville, London, Amsterdam and Portland, Ore. “If I continue to do my job right, people will continue to have a better understanding of Downtown and our mission to be a true partner to the industry,” says Neuman, who also works with various government agencies to address issues related to copyright, music licensing and the representation of independent artists. Among her goals for 2024? “More representation of women, people of color and our LGBTQ+ communities in our companies and in our charts.”\n\nCMO, Tubi\n\nAs the VP in charge of marketing in North America for dating app Tinder, Parlapiano seemed like a definite swipe left for Fox’s ad-supported streamer Tubi when it was looking to fill their CMO slot last year, but “they were really set on having someone that didn’t come from entertainment, and so I took the job because it felt like just an exciting brand challenge,” she says. Since then, Parlapiano has helped Tubi stand out amid the Netflixes of the world with campaigns including a series of Super Bowl spots that have won or been shortlisted for more than 15 awards (including the Super Clio).\n\nVP of film, LuckyChap\n\nA movie lover whose first job in her native Australia was working at a Blockbuster Video, Payne joined LuckyChap in 2018, a day after the banner led by Margot Robbie, Tom Ackerley and Josey McNamara got the rights to produce “Barbie” with Robbie to star. “Walking on those sets for the first time was beyond anything I could have imagined,” says Payne, who has also worked on Emerald Fennell’s “Promising Young Woman” and “Saltburn,” along with “My Old Ass,” an upcoming project directed by Megan Park, whom she met through AFI classmates. “We are a filmmaker-driven company, and it’s our hope to give a platform to female stories and storytellers.”\n\nPresident, Sony Pictures Television Studios\n\nPope had just executive produced “The Dropout” for Hulu when she took over as president of Sony Pictures TV in 2022. She oversees more than 40 productions, including the hit HBO drama “The Last of Us,” a collaboration with PlayStation Prods., Netflix’s hit “The Night Agent,” as well as the recent “The Boys” spinoff “Gen V” for Amazon Prime Video. “Even though it has been a challenging year for the entertainment business, I am extremely proud of the work we are doing and the content we are creating,” Pope says. “This year, that effort was marked by our team receiving 36 of SPT’s 53 Emmy nominations, a company record.”\n\nActor-producer, “Barbie”; producer, “Saltburn”\n\n“Barbie” had been languishing in production hell before Robbie and her LuckyChap production banner won the rights to turn Mattel’s popular doll into a movie. Five years later, the Greta Gerwig-directed movie starring Robbie is a monster hit that has grossed more than $1.4 billion worldwide, No. 1 for the year and the most ever for a Warner Bros. film. Not bad for a woman that wasn’t into Barbie growing up in Australia. “This movie is brimming with optimism, and maybe people weren’t expecting that from a Barbie movie,” Robbie told a reporter pre-SAG-AFTRA strike. She also produced Emerald Fennell’s awards hopeful, “Saltburn,” under her LuckyChap banner. Among her upcoming projects: an “Ocean’s Eleven” prequel that will co-star “Barbie’s” Ken, Ryan Gosling.\n\nExec VP, originals, Boardwalk Pictures\n\nRoma notched her second consecutive Emmy this year, this time for her work on FX’s breakout soccer series “Welcome to Wrexham.” The show, which follows Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney as they take ownership of a U.K. soccer club, received six Emmy noms for its first season; the second season bowed in September. “Mainstream audiences finding and falling in love with the subjects of a doc series is something we’ve believed in for a long time,” says Roma, who last year was nominated for her work on W. Kamau Bell’s Showtime series, “We Need to Talk About Cosby.” “‘Wrexham’ really represents the reach that documentary series can have.”\n\nActor, “Avatar: The Way of the Water,” “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3”\n\nSaldaña starred in James Cameron’s “Avatar: The Way of Water,” the top-grossing movie worldwide last year, and third top grosser ever. It’s also the Marvel Cinematic Universe star’s fourth film to gross more than $2 billion worldwide. “Doing work that I can be proud of is the most important for me,” she says. “Maybe it’s something that appeals to a large audience, and it gives people joy and entertainment. Sometimes, it’s a story that’s so well written that I can’t say no. Other times, it’s something that will represent being Latinx, or a woman of color, in a way that I find valuable, and needs to be out in the world.”\n\nPartner and talent agent, UTA\n\nStreisand is known for identifying new talent — she signed Timothée Chalamet when he was still in high school — and building and sustaining successful careers. Before the actors’ strike, she closed Daisy Edgar-Jones’ deal to star in the upcoming “Twisters” sequel and negotiated Greta Lee’s roles in the A24 hit “Past Lives” and Disney’s upcoming “Tron: Ares.” Additionally, Streisand negotiated Archie Madekwe’s role in Sony’s “Gran Turismo” and signed Dominique Fishback, who landed the leading role in Paramount’s “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts.” She represents Taylor Russell, Lili Reinhart (who stars in “Hal and Harper” and Lea Seydoux, who will next be seen in “Dune 2.” “In an environment with a lot of content, the challenge is to connect clients with something meaningful that grabs the audiences’ attention and sparks the shared dialogue,” she says.\n\nFishback: actor\n\nNabers: creator-exec producer\n\nAmazon Prime Video’s limited series starring Fishback as a serial killer who’s also a superfan of a Beyoncé-esque pop star was a hit with audiences and critics, earning Emmy nominations for writing (shared by co-creators Nabers and Donald Glover), costume design and its lead actress. “It’s almost like [Fishback’s] Dre has her own cult fan base now, which is pretty cool,” Nabers says reflecting on the show’s success, which she credits in large part to Fishback’s nuanced portrayal. “As absurd and as crazy as Dre was, you still saw her humanity,” she adds. “I hope it motivates actors to look for those roles that really challenge them, that make them question their own interpretation of a character’s humanity.” With “Swarm” as her first showrunner credit, Nabers also hopes it “motivates Black female writers who are interested in telling stories that are a little bit outside the box.”\n\nPresident, AMPAS\n\nYang and AMPAS CEO Bill Kramer worked hard to make sure the first Academy Awards ceremony on their watch was scandal-free and succeeded, helping to restore luster to the event post slap-gate, “though that seems like ancient history now.” In October, AMPAS made the tough decision to postpone the Academy Museum fundraising gala 36 hours before the event due to the escalating Israel-Hamas conflict. The SAG-AFTRA strike also added uncertainty to the Oscar season. “We’re still on pins and needles about everything that is going on,” says Yang, who believes the joy of filmmaking should be celebrated even in challenging times. “I think people need this now more than ever.”"
