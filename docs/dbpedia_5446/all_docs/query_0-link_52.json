        "text": "Author: Vera Kobalia\n\nI met with Carlos during my visit to Taipei as he kindly offered to take me on a tour of the city. Living and working in the city for over a year, his knowledge of places to eat and catch a live performance was exponentially better than mine. As we walked through the night market we talked about his research at the University of Taipei and the imminent return to Brasilia to teach in the fall semester. “what course?” I asked. “International Politics of the 20th Century through Film”.\n\nAfter the trip to Taipei, as my fellowship at the University of Hong Kong was coming to an end, I found myself thinking more and more about gender equality and female-led movements taking place across the world. The #Metoos and #GlassCeilings. It was the little things, comments overheard around the campus or at dinner tables that got my mind racing. Comments such as “How convenient for her to remember the rape 30 years later” or “this has gone too far, you can’t even flirt with a colleague any more”.\n\nAs a reaction, I started a series of interviews titled “conversations with women” and found myself with women that on the outside emitted so much power and success, and often, internally, were struggling with so many expectations put on their shoulders. “Good for you, only a 2-week maternity leave. What a powerhouse.”\n\nGoing back in my mind to the conversation with Carlos, I thought, wouldn’t it be great to teach young girls and boys from an early age the concept of equality. And to do this through movies, through visuals they can relate to.\n\nI clearly remember the three movies that we were shown in high school. It’s a Wonderful Life, in my ESL class when I just moved to Canada. Schindler’s List, in history class and Basketball Diaries, as an attempt to warn us of the dangers of drug use.\n\nWhat movies does one show to illustrate “what it feels like for a girl”? And what is a feminist movie anyway? Is it one that passes a Bechdel test (The test, created by comic artist Alison Bechdel, asks whether a film has at least two female characters and at least one scene in which they talk to one another about something other than a man) or a Mako Mori test (based on Guillermo del Toro’s Pacific Rim character, the test asks whether a film has at least one female character who gets her own narrative that is not about supporting a man’s story). To me both tests can act as good indicators on how to pick a movie over the weekend, but too narrow to classify all movies of all time into good or bad categories.\n\nThe point for this course is to illustrate that we are all equal. And it is by character, and not sex, that we should be categorizing people. But life is not that way, yet. So my movies on this list start with girls in their adolescence, trying to figure out what it’s like to be a girl (periods and breasts and all), to the day when they start thinking about their rights and rights they don’t have, and to the day when this will all pass, and we will all be on equal terms.\n\nOf course, nothing is stopping you to join my imaginary class now, from your own home and screen."
