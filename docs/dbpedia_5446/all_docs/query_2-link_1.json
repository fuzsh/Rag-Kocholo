        "text": "Whatever else one can say about gender equality in Hollywood, there's clearly no shortage of female roles for space princesses, alien hunters and flying nannies.\n\nFor THR's latest intra-industry poll, the editors asked Hollywood professionals — actors, writers, directors and others — to take an online survey of their favorite fictional female characters. More than 1,800 participated — twice as many women as men — but the results proved there isn't such a great divide between the sexes after all, at least when it comes to what types of females we enjoy watching on screens. By comfortable majorities, both genders picked a certain Hogwarts know-it-all as their No. 1.\n\nNaturally, the poll was anonymous, but some industry pros don't mind sharing. \"The tough Angelina Jolie characters in Wanted and Salt — and whoever Ava Gardner played in capri pants,\" offers Dawn Hudson, CEO of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Hunger Games franchise producer Nina Jacobson confesses to having a \"soft spot for Katniss Everdeen,\" while Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy admits that as a child she worshiped Scout from To Kill a Mockingbird. \"I used to think I was her,\" she says.\n\nChances are, there's at least one character on these pages who you once imagined being, particularly if you're female — and maybe even if you're not. After all, who hasn't dreamt of bitch-slapping an alien, owning a pet dragon or even traveling by umbrella?\n\nClick here to vote for your favorite female character of all time in THR's bracket.\n\nEdited by Benjamin Svetkey and Andy Lewis.
