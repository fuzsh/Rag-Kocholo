        "text": "Directing\n\n46 Storyboard Examples from Movies, Animation, and Games (with FREE Storyboard Templates)\n\nA storyboard is a graphic layout that sequences illustrations and images with the purpose of visually telling a story. Filmmakers and video creators use storyboards to transfer ideas from thier mind to the screen. Creating an effective story board takes skill, but you can learn from storyboard examples to gain some pro tips.\n\nTake a look at these fantastic professional storyboard examples. These verified storyboards were released by the DGA, and they include storyboard examples from Harry Potter, Star Wars, Inception, Gladiator, Jurassic Park, Moulin Rouge, and many other great films.\n\n1\n\nScience Fiction Storyboard Examples\n\nStoryboards from Sci-Fi Movies\n\nMovie Story board Examples\n\n1. Alien\n\nScene: Infirmary Scene\n\nRidley Scott did not draw stick figures here, and while he probably picked up some pretty slick storyboarding skills when he attended the Royal College of Art, it doesn’t mean you should throw in the towel or that you can’t achieve similar results from following his example.\n\nStory boards by Ridley Scott for Ridley Scott’s • Alien\n\nNote: “Action inside the egg is beautiful.”\n\nAlien • Infirmary Scene\n\n\"It’s got a wonderful defense mechanism... molecular acid storyboards.\"\n\nMovie Storyboard Examples\n\n2. Pacific Rim\n\nNot a lot of wide shots in these storyboards. Going from control room to outside takes careful planning. There is a distinct Japanese/Anime vibe.\n\nVery cool how the negative space works as light in this storyboard. Check out the entire story board with the shot specs and play the storyboard in slideshow mode, take a look below:\n\nAnd here's the actual scene from the film:\n\nPacific Rim • Final Monster Battle\n\n\"We can clear a path… for the storyboard.\"\n\nMovie Storyboard Examples\n\n3. Jurassic Park\n\nScene: Raptor Attack Scene\n\nThe notes help lead you into each new shot. Multiple slides (or cells) for can be used for a single shot, especially if you plan to linger a bit.\n\nStoryboards by David Lowery for Steven Spielberg's • Jurassic Park\n\nNote: “Foot toward camera and…”\n\nJurassic Park • Raptor Attack Scene\n\n\"Ah, ah, ah, you didn’t say the magic word (it’s storyboard).\"\n\nMovie Storyboard Examples\n\n4. Star Wars: A New Hope\n\nScene: A Galaxy Far, Far Away\n\nGeorge Lucas did a storyboard for the title sequence. C3PO looks really different in these. Tougher. Lucas knew how he wanted that final shot.\n\nStoryboards by George Lucas for • Star Wars: A New Hope\n\nA ton of specific visual goals in this storyboard made it to the screen.\n\nThat’s No Moon • Star Wars: A New Hope\n\n\"I am fluent in over six million forms of communication… including storyboards.\"\n\nMovie Storyboard Examples\n\n5. Transformers\n\nScene: Blackout’s Rampage\n\nI quickly notice thoughtful sketches of the production design. See how the artists visualize destruction? Blocking of the confused soldiers is very interesting, along with being a really pretty story board example.\n\nStoryboards by Ed Natividad for Michael Bay’s • Transformers\n\nDefinitely story boards for a Michael Bay film.\n\nTransformers • Blackout’s Rampage\n\n\"Autobots; assemble... a scene with a storyboard.\"\n\nMovie Storyboard Examples\n\n6. Inception\n\nScene: Hallway Fight Scene\n\nHow would you draw a rotating room? The ceiling fan helps you stay oriented.

Everything is visualized perfectly in your mind, but will it make it to the screen?\n\nWhat you need is a storyboard. Storyboards are what professional filmmakers and production companies use to clearly communicate visual ideas with their team. Cavemen used storyboards. The Ancient Egyptians used storyboards.\n\nBottom line: Storyboards work.\n\nWhile some of the reasons storyboards work so well may seem painfully obvious, there are more nuanced rationales that many novice (and professional) filmmakers tend to overlook.\n\nYou may not have a huge budget, so naturally, you think you’re limited. That line of thinking can be harmful to your project because what you’re actually doing is limiting your creativity, which in turn limits the effectiveness of your vision, which in turns limits your project.\n\nDon’t waste valuable energy thinking about limitations. Take that energy and create storyboard ideas for your scene. Make sure to spend some time sketching out your storyboard ideas, even if they're just as samples. You’ll often hear the suggestion to:\n\n“Draw your storyboard ideas with stick figures if you’re not an artist.”\n\nI strongly disagree.\n\nI firmly believe that you should take your time drawing an ugly storyboard because then you’re forced to draw an ugly background, an ugly foreground, ugly characters, and thoughtful shot compositions.\n\nSuddenly, new storyboard ideas are popping into your head:\n\nMaybe a special easter egg hidden in the background of a shot.\n\nOr perfect symmetry for a specific point in the story.\n\nPerhaps a match cut from one image to another.\n\nThese are great cinematic goals, and they’re often the product of storyboarding. Tim Burton movies and Wes Anderson films come to mind when I think about precise shot composition and unique production design.\n\nThey put imagery on the screen that you won’t find anywhere in the existing world. They had their departments build, scout, and piece together a world that, at one point, only existed in their minds.\n\nHow do you think they communicated their visions? Their teams used storyboards to act as examples for their vision. Learn as much as you can from these movie storyboard examples and see how you can take your dream from your head to the big screen.\n\nSTORYBOARDING WITH STUDIOBINDER\n\nCreate the perfect storyboard\n\nWhen you study professional storyboards like these, you quickly begin to understand how much effort goes into the planning stages of a film.\n\nSuccessful projects use the pre-production phase to the fullest.
