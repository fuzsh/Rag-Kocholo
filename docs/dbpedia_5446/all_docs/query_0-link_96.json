        "text": "Camille - the first tart with a heart - has inspired countless plays and films. But her life, says Lyn Gardner, was far from romantic.\n\nBarring divine intervention or a natural disaster, it's a safe bet that Julia Roberts will hold her first Oscar aloft this evening. In doing so, she will bring a measure of comforting certainty not only to the proceedings, said to be unusually difficult to predict this year, but also to the film industry and to the cinema-going world at large.\n\nIt was one of the most successful films of the decade. It made Julia Roberts an international star. Its fairy-tale plot bore almost no relation to reality. And it's just the kind of movie Hollywood loves. So the only surprising element of news that plans are afoot to make a sequel to Pretty Woman is that it has taken 10 years."
