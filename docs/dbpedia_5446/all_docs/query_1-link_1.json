        "text": "In a good movie year — and whatever you may have heard, 2022 was such a year — I find it an agony to compile a Top 10 list. There are just too many good and great films, too many titles that I want to celebrate. Being overwhelmed by a bounty of excellence is a pleasure, one that I often experience at film festivals. And lately, whether I’m at home or at a festival, I have been struck by how much of this abundance is from women onscreen and behind the camera.\n\nWe are experiencing a sea change with women and movies, a shift in numbers but also in consciousness. Female-driven movies, from women filmmakers and not, open weekly and are greeted as a matter of course rather than as aberrations; some dominate the box office, and a handful are enlivening the awards season. Despite continuing biases and barriers, women are now directing movies with a variety of budgets, topics and casts. It’s made my job as a critic more exciting.\n\nIt is, I learned long ago, demoralizing and alienating to watch film after film in which women watch men conquer worlds. And, yes, men continue to dominate American cinema. The producers and directors guilds have failed to nominate a single woman filmmaker for their latest awards, and on Tuesday the Academy Awards largely followed suit, although Sarah Polley’s “Women Talking” was a surprise best picture nominee. All the Top 20 domestic box office earners last year were directed by men, a gender imbalance that’s been the norm for a long time, notwithstanding exceptions like “Wonder Woman.” Yet what struck me about 2022 were the number of movies headlined and directed by women that made an impact, culturally and economically.\n\nWomen seemed to be taking the representational fight in every kind of movie last year, whether it was Michelle Yeoh tearing through “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” Keke Palmer running off with “Nope” or the metaphorically rich army of women warriors leading the charge in “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.” There were more female fighters in Gina Prince-Bythewood’s adventure drama, “The Woman King,” which opened at No. 1 in September. The next weekend, filmgoers could catch “Don’t Worry Darling,” Olivia Wilde’s divisive freakout about a woman breaking free of brutally reactionary femininity. It too opened at No. 1; the next weekend, it was supplanted by “Smile,” a horror flick about a woman facing a demon.\n\nI couldn’t remember when (or if) three female-led movies had topped the box office consecutively, so after “Smile” opened, I asked Tom Brueggemann, who tracks the box office for IndieWire. He established that the last time had been in 2009 with the release of “The Twilight Saga: New Moon,” “The Blind Side” and “The Princess and the Frog,” which features Disney’s first Black princess. “Frog” aside, these films aren’t especially memorable, and their stories are cut from shabby cloth. Yet taken together, their popularity suggested that something significant had started to shift in the movie world, even if only about a third of speaking characters in the Top 100 popular films were female, per one study.\n\nSOMETHING ELSE HAPPENED in 2009: Kathryn Bigelow’s war movie “The Hurt Locker” opened to ecstatic reviews and decent box office, and was soon on the march toward the Academy Awards. Such campaigns are slogs, but this one paid off when in March 2010 Bigelow became the first woman to win best director. By the end of the night, she had a second Oscar when the movie won best picture, twin triumphs that brought many of us watching at home to our feet. I hate the Oscars when I don’t love them, but that night I swooned. Surely, I thought, this would change everything for women in the industry, forcing open doors and checkbooks. It didn’t exactly happen that way; I didn’t realize that change had already started sneaking in.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
