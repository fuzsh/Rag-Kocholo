Microsoft has announced a groundbreaking partnership with Sanctuary AI to develop general-purpose humanoid robots. This collaboration promises to usher in a new era of robotics innovation. 🔍 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀: - The focus is on developing Large Behavior Models (LBMs) which will enable robots to learn from real-world experiences rather than just simulations. - Microsoft will leverage its Azure cloud infrastructure to handle the intense AI workloads necessary for this venture. - Sanctuary AI brings invaluable expertise, with its humanoid robot, Phoenix, already making waves in one of Canada’s largest retail chains, successfully performing 400 customer-related tasks across various industries. 📈 𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗧𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀: This partnership is a testament to Microsoft’s deepening commitment to AI and robotics. Coming off a $675M Series B funding round into AI robotics startup FigureAI, Microsoft is positioning itself at the forefront of AI-driven technological advancements. Bill Gates himself has shown a keen interest in the potential of humanoids, underscoring the strategic importance of this initiative. 🌐 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗙𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗥𝗼𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗰𝘀: As these technologies evolve, they promise to revolutionize how businesses operate and how daily tasks are performed. The implications for efficiency and innovation are vast. 💡 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁’𝘀 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗧𝗮𝗸𝗲?: How do you see humanoid robots impacting your industry? Are we ready for this leap in AI integration? #Microsoft #HumanoidRobots #AI #Innovation #TechNews\n\nWhen I discuss digital transformation--whether to illustrate the power of #digitalmatrix or the ideas underlying the forthcoming book, #FusionStrategy, I often use the automotive industry as an example. This sector is amid reinvention with digital giants (Waymo), ambitious startups (Tesla. Uber), and legacy incumbents (e.g., GM, Mercedes, Toyota, Tata Motors, and others) all jockeying to redefine the new rules. My co-author, Vijay Govindarajan (VG), and I are excited about the fusion future of the automotive sector because of the role that real-time data and AI will play in redefining the mobility space and offering new business models. We have glimpsed how large language models could redefine creative sectors such as media, publishing, education, legal, and consulting. I am most excited about the role of large language models in industrial sectors such as transportation, mining, farming, healthcare, buildings, and logistics. Large Language Models (LLMs) will play a fundamental role in self-driving and could show new ways to unlock trapped value in other sectors. The time is right for leaders in industrial sectors to recognize #genaitrends not just for professional productivity and creativity but as the new strategic competence that will separate the winners from the losers in this decade. #digitaltransformation #digitaltwins #realtimedata #industrialai\n\nGet ready for the robot revolution. Elon Musk predicts 1 billion humanoid bots by 2040! Buckle up, the future is coming fast: tech visionary Elon Musk has endorsed a bold prediction - 1 billion humanoid robots walking the Earth by the 2040s! This bombshell dropped after David Holz, founder of AI research lab Midjourney, ignited the discussion on X (formerly Twitter). Musk, known for his audacious pronouncements, chimed in with agreement: \"Probably something like that, provided the foundations of civilization are stable.\" Now, the tech world buzzes with anticipation and questions. Is this sci-fi fantasy or a glimpse into reality? While predicting the future is a tricky business, Musk's backing carries weight. His company, Tesla, is at the forefront of robotics, already developing their humanoid robot, Tesla Optimus, showcased at their 2021 AI Day. What does this mean for us? The implications are vast, affecting everything from our workforce to everyday lives. Imagine robots handling hazardous tasks, automating manual labor, or even providing companionship. But with such rapid advancement, questions about ethics, employment, and safety demand careful consideration. Join the conversation on LinkedIn! Share your thoughts on this thrilling prediction: Do you believe in Musk's vision? How will this impact humans and society? What ethical considerations must we address? Let's delve into this robo-revolution together! Use the hashtag #RobotUprising (with a wink) to share your insights and join the discussion. This is just the beginning. Buckle up, network, and prepare for a future where humans and robots might just become colleagues! #elonmusk #ai #humanoidrobots #technology #marketing #sales #digitalmarketing #remotework #marketingstrategies #futureofai\n\nAccording to Industry Expert: “Autonomous agents are set to revolutionize entire industries by streamlining processes and enhancing efficiency.” Luckily, this is a skill anyone can learn.

Google DeepMind just introduced Mobile Aloha, a low-cost robot capable of completing complex tasks like cooking, cleaning, and more 😳 Developed by researchers from Stanford University, Aloha robot appears to have learned how to do some fancy stuff based on imitation learning. With just 50 demos, the robot can autonomously complete complex mobile manipulation tasks like: - Cook and serve shrimp 🦐 - Call and take the elevator 🛗 - Store a 3Ibs pot in a two-door cabinet 🗄️ & more! The best part? It's all open-sourced. The key to mass-market robotics is cost, and Mobile Aloha was made just under $32,000 & it’s driven by a cheap laptop with a mobile 3070ti. A future where robots do all the mundane tasks is less than 5 years away. P.S. check out 🔔linas.substack.com🔔, it's the only newsletter you need for all things when Finance meets Technology.
