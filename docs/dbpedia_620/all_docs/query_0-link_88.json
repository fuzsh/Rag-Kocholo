        "text": "Transcription of obituary published in the Primitive Methodist Magazine by T.C.S.\n\nWith the passing of Brother David Seward, of Donnington-on-Bain Society, the Horncastle Circuit has lost a valuable worker and friend. For over thirty years our brother toiled as a local preacher in the interests of the Kingdom. In all the circuits of Mid-Lincolnshire he was a very welcome visitor.\n\nFor years a member of the District Committee, his presence and sage contributions were always acceptable. In the Horncastle Circuit he was regarded as a father, to whom the younger officials looked for guidance and sympathy. In his own village he was held in highest esteem.\n\nOur brother’s sufferings were brief, though intensely painful. The sick room was transformed into a sanctuary. He passed home to God on September 30th, 1915. The funeral was conducted by Rev. A.F. Hayden on October 2nd. Our prayers go out for the widow and only daughter, that the grace of God may be sufficient for them, as it was for our brother in the hour of his greatest need.\n\nFamily\n\nDavid was born in early 1851 at Boston, Lincolnshire, to parents John Sewards, a cordwainer (1851) and later a platelayer (1861), and Mary Moralee.\n\nCensus returns identify the following occupations for David.\n\n1861 scholar\n\n1871 labourer (Great Northern Railway)\n\n1881 foreman platelayer GNR & Primitive M Local Preacher\n\n1891 platelayer foreman\n\n1901 foreman platelayer\n\n1911 foreman platelayer\n\nHe married Mary Ann King (abt1853-1918) in the summer of 1873 in the Boston Registration District, Lincolnshire. Census returns identify one child.\n\nMary Eiizabeth (1874-1950) – married Joseph Wilson Gilliatt, a blacksmith (1911), in 1892\n\nDavid died on 30 September 1915 at Donnington on Bain, Lincolnshire.\n\nPrimitive Methodist Magazine 1916/242\n\nCensus Returns and Births, Marriages & Deaths Registers"
