He spent a small portion of his life in Pennsylvania; and was a member of the Presbyterian church in North Carolina as early as 1792. He was a ruling elder in that branch of the church of Christ for more than twenty years; from 1797 to the day of his death. He resided at the place where he died, the last 14 years of his life. He was a widower, and had been considered a kind and affectionate husband. He raised two sons and a daughter, who bear willing testimony to his love and faithfulness as a christian father. He reared them up in the fear and admonition of the Lord; and to his precepts and example, under God, they acknowledge themselves greatly indebted for a lively hope in Christ their Saviour. The deceased was at all times a decided Presbyterian, but he loved all who bore the image of Christ, and it is believed he enjoyed in a very high degree, the love and confidence of all who knew him, of whatever name. A mild and even temper was his distinguishing trait; he was never at variance with any man, and delighted to reconcile the differences of others. He was well qualified to be a peace maker, and in that enviable character rendered invaluable service to the Church and to his fellow men. His conduct as a member and officer of the church, was unexceptionable and exemplary. In the sanctuary his place will be difficult to supply. To the last he kept fully up to the spirit of the age, rejoicing in the prosperity of every benevolent enterprise, and freely giving his mite to aid in every work of love. In his closing hours he gave pleasing testimony of his unshaken confidence in Christ; and apparently without pain, and certainly without complaint, yielded up his breath, and no doubt rests in perfect peace upon that arm which is mighty to save, and to which he had so long and so confidently trusted. He has left his children and grandchildren but a small portion of this world's goods; but what is far better, he has left them a character and an example which if adopted and faithfully followed must lead them all to that inheritance which is above all price, incorruptible and that shall endure forever.\n\nG.M.

These two lots were won in the lottery by Edmond Bradberry, who drew lot 35, and Johnson Porter, who drew lot number 36. The main street in Madison is the approximate dividing line between the two lots, though a small portion of lot 35 extends just to the northwest of Main Street. As reported in Deed Book A, pages 337 and 338, Morgan County Superior Court, Bradberry sold lot 35 to\n\nElisha (sometimes spelled Elijah) Wyet (also spelled Wyatt). This was on January 20, 1806.
