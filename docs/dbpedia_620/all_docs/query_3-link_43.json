        "text": "UCF Communications and Marketing follows the writing guidelines in the Associated Press Stylebook for stories unless otherwise noted here. This reference is not intended to be a duplication of that guide, but a supplement for style, consistency, spelling and terms often encountered around the university. Please send comments or suggestions for this evolving reference to Nicole Dudenhoefer at Nicole.Dudenhoefer@ucf.edu.\n\nJump To:\n\nA\n\nA&P Administrative and Professional employment classification. Acceptable on first reference for stories on campus but spell out the name in the story.\n\nabbreviations and acronyms Avoid turning stories into alphabet soup. Universities have many buildings, courses, organizations, clubs, programs and titles that often are shortened for casual use, but generally spell them on first reference. It is not necessary to follow a full name with an abbreviation in parentheses; if an abbreviation on second reference is not clear on its own, don’t use it. It is often more clear on second reference to say the department or the organization or use some other identifier rather than use unfamiliar abbreviations and acronyms. Some abbreviations, however, have become so universally known that they stand alone, such as NCAA, SAT, GPA, ROTC and others, that can be used on first reference.\n\nacademic degrees The preferred form is to use bachelor’s (degree) and master’s (degree) in place of abbreviations. Also acceptable without a possessive in this style: Bachelor of Arts and Master of Science.\n\nAbbreviations can be used when the use of full terms would be cumbersome, as in a list of people. To abbreviate, use periods and no spaces between letters, such as B.S. (Bachelor of Science) or M.A. (Master of Arts). For degrees with three or more capital letters, such as MBA or MFA, omit the periods. However, Ph.D. should contain periods. The word degree does not follow a degree abbreviation.\n\nAn Associate of Arts is a two-year post-secondary degree offered by colleges. For students who transfer to UCF, the degree serves as the first two years of work for a bachelor’s degree. Associate degree is not possessive.\n\nIf mention of degrees is necessary to establish someone’s credentials, the preferred form is to use a phrase such as: John Jones, who has a doctorate in psychology.\n\nUse such abbreviations as B.A., M.A.,and Ph.D. only when identifying many individuals by degree on first reference would make the preferred form cumbersome. When necessary, use these abbreviations only after a full name – never after just a last name.\n\nacademic departments Capitalize as part of an official name as in Department of Political Science and Department of History, but lowercase when referring to them generically as in the political science department or history department.\n\nAcademic Health Sciences Center Organizational structure that includes the College of Medicine, College of Nursing, and College of Health Professions and Sciences.\n\nacademic titles Capitalize and spell formal titles (president, provost, dean, chancellor, vice president, professor) when they precede a name: Dean Mary Lou Sole. Lowercase job titles elsewhere, such as: James Green, dean. When used as descriptors, lowercase titles when they identify something else: dean’s list, provost’s office. Do not abbreviate assistant or associate.\n\naccents Use tildes and other accent marks when spelling proper names and other words as needed. Depress control and ‘ keys while typing the vowels for á, é, í, ó and ú.\n\nFor ñ, depress the alt key and type numbers 164 on the right side of the keyboard.\n\nFor ü, type alt 0252.\n\naccreditation UCF is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) to award degrees at the associate, baccalaureate, master’s, specialist and doctoral levels. SACSCOC reaffirmation of accreditation is on a 10-year schedule. UCF was initially accredited in 1970 and was last reaffirmed in 2016 as a Level VI institution.\n\nThere is no reason to qualify accreditation: fully accredited\n\nACT Use only the initials when referring to the previous American College Testing.\n\nadd/drop\n\nAddition Financial Arena Official name beginning May 1, 2019, of the UCF arena, which hosts basketball games, commencement ceremonies, concerts and other events.\n\nA&P Stands for Administrative & Professional employment category.

The remaining two members are the chair of the Faculty Senate or its equivalent, and the president of the student body of the university.\n\nBounce House Nickname for UCF’s football stadium.
