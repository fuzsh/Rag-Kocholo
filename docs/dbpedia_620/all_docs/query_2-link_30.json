        "text": "Terri Bea Marie Nicholson-Veliz, Age 57, passed away on Saturday, November 27, 2021 courageously fighting Covid 19.\n\nTerri was born on September 12, 1964 in Fremont, Ohio to Silas and Linda Nicholson and raised in Castalia, Ohio. She graduated from Margaretta High School. She worked at Ford Motor Company for nearly 28 years, was a loyal union sister and was looking forward to a well-earned retirement. Terri was married to Jesse Veliz for only a short while, but he has loved her for over 30 years, and they planned to live out their golden years together. As the eldest daughter she took on the job of protecting (and bossing around) her siblings and she also took on the responsibility of making sure her parents felt loved. She had a special bond with her Dad that could never be broken, and she called her Mom every night at 9:30 to talk. She had many friends and truly had a way of making each person in her life feel special in her own way.\n\nTerri lived her life on her own terms; she worked very hard and spent her money freely on family, friends and charity. She found great pleasure in giving. She would lovingly assemble diamond paintings for her dearest friends, and was just starting to enjoy showing her work at craft shows. Terri LOVED Christmas and succeeded in making it irrelevant as to whether Santa showed up or not! She truly lived for her children and grandchildren and adored her dogs and birds.\n\nHer life will forever be cherished in the hearts of her family: Father and mother, Si and Linda, her husband Jesse, daughter, Denille (Shane) Toccaceli, son, David (Stacie) Howard, grandchildren, Jessyln Jenkins, Kaden Folk, Gabriella Toccaceli, Kevin Howard, sisters, Judy (Chuck Schaffer) Garden, Joanne Nicholson, brother, Johnny (Kendy) Nicholson.\n\nTerri was preceded in death by her paternal grandparents, Roy and Beatrice Nicholson, maternal grandmother , Estelle Andres, uncles, John Andres, Rush Andres and Bob Galloway, nephew, Colten Garden-Barnicle and godfather Marvin Griffin.\n\nTerri did not wish for a service or showing, but rather a celebration of her life. She did not want to cause any of her loved ones sorrow and she explicitly left instructions that her family and friends could only cry for her for ONE day. Ransom Funeral & Cremation Service, Castalia, is in charge of the arrangements.\n\nThe family would like to express special thanks to the staff at Firelands Regional Medical Center for their exceptional care for Terri in her final hours.\n\nThose wishing to honor her life can make a donation in her memory to Back to the Wild, Another Chance Sanctuary, Clyde, OH or your local Humane Society.
