        "text": "It has been alleged that the father of William Nicholson ( - aft. 1802) of Culpeper Co., VA and John Nicholson ( - 1810) of Culpeper and Madison counties was the William Nicholson who was mentioned as a landowner adjacent to Robert Traweek/Traweck in a 1751 deed of property on the south side of the Hazel River in Culpeper Co., VA. The 28 March 1748/9 survey of this tract of land for Robert Traweek/Traweck shows this property to be adjacent to Wm. Nicholesone of Whitehaven. A 1734 survey states that a tract of land in St. Mark's Parish being surveyed for Benjamin Berryman was adjacent William Nicholson, Thomas Stonehouse, et al. It is clear from the description of this area that the land in question was actually the 1000 acres of land that was patented to Thomas Nickholson of Whitehaven, Cumberland, England in 1732 (Patent Book 14, p. 454), which was also in St. Mark's Parish and adjacent to Thomas Stonehouse. Apparently the error in names made in the 1734 survey for Benjamin Berryman was propagated in the 1748 survey for Robert Traweek/Traweck and in the 1751 deed by Robert Traweek/Traweck. The 1000 acres patented by Thomas Nickholson in 1732 was sold by his widow, Mary Nicholson, and eldest son, John Nicholson, in a deed in November 1752 in Culpeper Co., VA. That this William Nicholson was an \"error,\" created by a surveyor in 1734, is also confirmed by the fact that there is no mention of this William Nicholson's property after 1752, when Thomas Nicholson's property was sold by his relict and eldest son. There are also no Nicholsons (or any name derivatives) who owned any land in Culpeper Co., VA listed on the 1764 Rent Roll, theQuitrent Accounts of 1773, or the Rent Roll of 1779. Finally, there are no wills or inventories of any Nicholsons in the 18th century in Culpeper Co., VA.\n\nIt has also been alleged that a John Nicholson, possibly the one who died in Madison Co., VA in 1810, owed a debt mentioned in a court case in Orange Co., VA on June 27, 1765 (Order Book, Vol. 7 [1763-1769], p. 331), in which a William Nicholson offered to pledge for the debt if John Nicholson could not pay it. This is incorrect. I looked at, and copied, this record from microfilm yesterday and the actual court record states that the attorney, William Strother, for the plaintiff, Henry Goare, would cover the obligation for John Nicholson if necessary. Part of the actual text is listed below:\n\nHenry Goare Plt.\n\nagt.\n\nJohn Nicholason Deft. In Debt\n\nThis day came the Plt. by his attorney William Strother comes into court and Undertakes for the Deft. that in case he is ?cast in this Suit he Shall pay the condemnation of the court or render his Body in Execution in Discharge thereof or that he the said William will do it for him and the Deft. confesseth the Plt. Action ...\n\nListed below are some personal property tax (PPT) records for the Nicholson families of Culpeper and Madison counties. These records were first kept in 1782 and the key category is for tithables, i.e. the number of white males of at least age 16. Other categories include: horses, cattle, slaves, etc. In some cases, elderly males, or males that had been injured and could no longer work, were exempted from the tithable tax. That may explain why William Nicholson was not charged with a tithable starting in 1795. The name of the tax collector is shown to indicate in which district each individual lived. This can be used as a proximity indicator. The names are transcribed as shown in the records.\n\nCulpeper Co., VAPersonal Property Tax Lists (1782-1802), Library of Virginia Microfilm Reel 89\n\n1782 William Nichols1, 0, 1, 8(James Pendleton District)\n\n1782 John Nicholson1, 0, 1, 4(Henry Hill District)\n\n1783 William Nichols1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 7, 0, 1(James Pendleton District)\n\n1783 John Nicholson1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4(Henry Hill District)\n\n1784 William Nicholson1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 6(James Pendleton District)\n\n1784 No John Nicholson\n\n1785 Wm.

The PPT records also show that John Nicholson ( - 1810) and William Nicholson ( - aft 1802) were never residents of the same tax district from 1782 to 1800. The PPT records show that William Nicholson ( - aft 1802) was a resident of Culpeper Co., VA continuously from 1782 to 1801, every year except 1788. The records also show that there was another, unplaced, John Nicholson living in Culpeper Co., VA in 1795 nearby William Nicholson and his son, Benjamin Nicholson. William Nicholson ( - aft 1802) is shown on the land tax records of Culpeper Co., VA as owning 200 acres of land from 1782 to 1794 and 100 acres of land from 1795 to at least 1802. This property was obtained by William Nicholson as shown below (not from an unspecified father):\n\nCulpeper Co., VA, Deed Book \"I\", pp. 231-233\n\nMarch 15, 1779Recorded March 15, 1779\n\nDeed from Samuel Fargeson and wife Ann to William Nicholson, 200 acres purchased by Samuel Fargeson from John Washborn\n\nWitnesses: John Walker, John Wigginton\n\nThis property was sold and a different 100 acres was purchased by William Nicholson per the following records:\n\nCulpeper Co., VA, Deed Book R (1791-1794), Part 2, pp. 621-624\n\nMarch 25, 1794Recorded April 22, 1794\n\nDeed from Hamon Utterback and wife Elizabeth to William Nicholson, 100 acres.\n\nWitnesses: John Wigginton, Samuel Ferguson, Benjamin Nicholson, John Ferguson, Birkett Davenport\n\nCulpeper Co., VA, Deed Book R (1791-1794), Part 2, pp. 627-631\n\nMarch 25, 1794Recorded June 16, 1794\n\nDeed from William Nicholson and wife Mary to Isaiah Corbin of Charles City Co., MD, 200 acres in the \"north little fork of Rappahannock River\" adjacent Wm. Corbin Senr., John Green, and Baysies (formerly Brownings). The land was conveyed with the following stipulation: \"(to wit) Wm. Nicholson and Mary his wife at the time of Sealing & delivery of these presents is and Stands seized of an Indefeasable Estate of Inheritance in fee simple in and to the said Land and premises ...\"\n\nWitnesses: Samuel Ferguson, John Ferguson, Benjamin Nicholson, Birkett Davenport, John Wigginton\n\nIt is my interpretation of the records that William Nicholson's wife, Mary, was a Ferguson, and the 200 acres that William Nicholson first obtained in 1779 came from his wife's family.\n\nThe name Nicholson (and its derivative forms) was very common in 18th century Virginia. Since three of John Nicholson's ( - 1810) sons (Michael, Aaron, and Benjamin) married daughter of William Sandy and Dinah Wood (residents of Shenandoah Co., VA in the 1780s and 1790s), I also reviewed the PPT records for Shenandoah Co.,VA. John's son, Michael Nicholson, who married Eleanor Sandy in 1791, was on these records from 1792 to 1798. However, also listed on these records during some of these years there were John Nichols, Richard Nichols, and Nathan Nichols. Clearly this is yet another John Nichols.\n\nOn the abstracted colonial tithable lists for Orange Co., VA there were the following entries:\n\n1761 John Nicolas 1\n\n1765 John Nickleson 1\n\n1767 John Nicholason 2\n\n1768 John Nickafson 3\n\n1769 John Nicholafs 3\n\n1769 John Nickson 2\n\nThese entries are also clearly for a different John Nicholson, since the eldest of John Nicholson's ( - 1810) sons, William, wasn't born until about 1765. There are some internet entries which show his eldest son as Benjamin Nicholson, born about 1760. This is based on an entry on the 1850 census of Madison Co., VA. These census entries should never be used in isolation. If one looks at all of the census entries for Benjamin Nicholson and wife Mildred \"Milly\" Sandy, then there birth dates should be shown as about 1770-1780. However, there marriage bond on November 18, 1797 clearly shows that both parties were still minors (less than 21) because a parent of both parties had to grant approval for the wedding.\n\nIn summary, there are no court records that I have located which link William Nicholson ( - aft. 1802) of Culpeper Co., VA and John Nicholson ( - 1810) of Culpeper and Madison counties, although they might have been brothers. If they were brothers, there is no evidence who their father was. There were clearly several other John Nicholsons who lived in this area during about the same time. One possible link that I have investigated briefly, is that the maternal grandfather of the three Sandy women who married John Nicholson's ( - 1810) sons, was Samuel Wood of King George Co., VA. He lived for a number of years adjacent to another John Nichols, who also had a son, John, named in a will in 1758. There might be some link between these families, however, I haven't located any records thus far to prove this relationship."
