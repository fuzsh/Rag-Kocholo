        "text": "Comparing My Family’s Common Ancestor Results at AncestryDNA: Part 1\n\nRecently, I was looking at my sister Heidi’s Common Ancestor results at AncestryDNA and noticed that she had a lot of new ones that I wasn’t aware of. In order to find these, I go to DNA matches, then I filter for common ancestors. Because I like to count things, I’ll put the results in a table. It will be interesting to compare the results for me and my 4 siblings who have tested at AncestryDNA. Here is a chart starting with me:\n\nAlso The numbers are good, but it is the actual common ancestors that are interesting. I guess I should add the mother’s side also. Ironically, my mother isn’t listed as being on my mother’s side, but my siblings are. That’s OK. Also, I don’t know if the mother’s side works for distant cousins:\n\nHere is the filled out chart:\n\nThe comparison is interesting:\n\nI have the fewest DNA matches with common ancestors.\n\nMy sister Lori has the most DNA matches with common ancestors\n\nMaternal side matches are not given for Distant Cousins\n\nMy mother’s 4th cousin matches and Distant Cousin Matches are important ones. Many of these would not be covered by my and my siblings’ matches.\n\nLooking At My Mother’s Common Ancestors\n\nFirst, I went through my mother’s 4th cousin and Distant Relative Common Ancestor matches and put a colored dot with the ancestor to designate the branch. I have had trouble identifying Lentz ancestors previously, but now I notice quite a few, so I would like to take a look at those matches.\n\nShoring Up the Lentz Common Ancestors\n\nHere is the Lentz DNA matching chart I have so far:\n\nThe left part of the chart has Nicholson matches and there are a lot of them, so I would like to augment the right-hand side of the chart. Green means that the DNA match is listed in a place where I can tell where on the chromosome the match is. This is usually at Gedmatch.com. My mom’s top non-Nicholson match is Radelle. She linked her DNA results at Ancestry to her mother, so that is a little confusing. What that means is that Radelle is actually a 4th cousin to my mom instead of the 3rd cousin once removed that AncestryDNA shows. Radelle and my mom have one shared DNA match, so I sent a message to that match. The match had no Ancestry Tree.\n\nMy mom’s next match is with Deborah. She is also on the chart, though she has a lower DNA match. Deborah is on a branch with more connections. However, I didn’t see that Deborah and my Mom have any shared DNA matches.\n\nNow that I have a purple dot for Lentz, I am able to filter by that dot:\n\nRadelle and Deborah were the first two matches with Lentz common ancestors out of eight.\n\nThe next match is another Deborah and appears to be the mother of the previous Deborah. She also has no shared matches with my Mom.\n\nBack to George Adam Lentz Born 1770\n\nI’ll need to add an extra level on my chart for the next match. Here is what AncestryDNA shows for the connection:\n\nOf course Ancestry wants me to evaluate the connection. I notice that TL’s tree goes up to a Lantz instead of a Lentz, so that is a little suspicious. The other suspicious part is that by this tree, George would have been 13 years old when Sarah was born. I’ll leave TL off my chart for now. From another tree at Ancestry, here are Sarah’s parents:\n\nThere is a probably a connection somewhere, but it doesn’t appear to be here.\n\nJohn to John\n\nThis tree seems more reasonable as it goes up to Eliza Lentz. I’ll be a bit lazy and I won’t evaluate this tree. It is consistent with my chart with the Glenn surname. Here is John added in:\n\nSo if this is right, John is Radelle’s second cousin twice removed. It’s nice to have some company on the Eliza Lentz line.\n\nBetty on the William Lentz Line\n\nBetty appears to be related to the two Deborahs:\n\nAnother Bogus George Adam Lentz Connection\n\nI had hope for these connections, but they didn’t pan out:\n\nMary Lantz was born when my ancestor George was 7 years old.\n\nThe last person on my list is Al who is already on my Lentz DNA match tree. So of the eight people I identified, 4 were already on the Tree. Two didn’t match by the AncestryDNA suggested genealogy and two were added.\n\nMy Mom’s Baker and Faunce Lines\n\nHere is my chart so far:\n\nIn a sense my siblings and I are not as important as my mom should have more DNA than we do for these matches. Here is my mom’s top DNA match on that line:\n\nThe Baker family was large, so that means many descendants with DNA matches.\n\nAdding Peter and Justin to the Baker DNA Tree\n\nNow I’m up to four Baker Lines. Justin adds another generation going down.\n\nFL On the Catherine Baker Slater Line\n\nI just looked up Annette. She was a match on MyHeritage. FL at AncestryDNA is on that Line also.\n\nThis is beginning to look like a real surname DNA project now.\n\nAn Older Faunce Match with Lauren\n\nNow I need to figure out how to get Lauren onto this tree. Actually, I need to build a new Faunce Tree:\n\nI just didn’t add all the others under Catherine Faunce from above. Hopefully, I’ll find more matches here also.\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nI started by comparing my siblings’ common ancestor DNA matches with mine and my mother’s common ancestor DNA matches.\n\nThis comparison showed that I should look at my siblings’ results.\n\nI then saw that my mother must have more common ancestor matches to look at.\n\nI looked at two different Philadelphia lines and matches that my mom had showing common ancestors.\n\nThe two matches my mom had with common ancestors going back to George Adam Lentz didn’t pan out. I would still like to find some matches there – though this is going back to about as far as a DNA match would be expected.\n\nMy Mom’s Lentz Family and Roberta Estes’ Lentz Family\n\nRoberta Estes has blogged about her Lentz family. I have also blogged about my Lentz family. Roberta and I have checked to see if there was an autosomal DNA match between our two families, but we were unable to find any significant match. Recently, in checking my 23andMe results, it seems like there may be a way to see if we are related by YDNA.\n\nMy Mom’s Lentz Family YDNA\n\nI have tested my DNA at 23andMe and have a few Lentz matches there. One good thing about 23andMe is that when you take an autosomal test, they also give you a rough estimate of your YDNA haplogroup. I have has two Lentz matches at 23andMe who are brothers. They both have this Haplogroup:\n\nI’ve sent off messages to the two brothers. I don’t know exactly how we are related, but based on the size of the autosomal DNA match and where they live, my guess is that our common ancestors must be Jacob George Lentz and Annie Nicholson:\n\nI don’t have record of William Lentz born 1892 as having any sons. William did have a brother named Stanley who had sons, so that may be where the two matches fit in. At any rate, their YDNA would go up through the Lentz side.\n\nWhat is R-Y4355?\n\nI would expect that 23andMe has an accurate haplogroup though not recent. Here is what YFull has on Y4355:\n\nAbove the tree, YFull gives the YDNA Line for this branch of Lentz back to Genetic Adam (listed as Home). This shows that Y4355 is about 4200 years old, so fairly old. I recognize R-U152 in that line as a major branch.\n\nRoberta Estes’ Lentz YDNA\n\nHere is what Roberta has in one of her Blogs:\n\nRoberta has invested in the Big Y test for her Lentz relatives, so this is likely to be extremely accurate and fairly recent. YFull does not have BY39280, but has some information on KMS75:\n\nActually KMS75 is listed as +1SNPs above. The equivalent at YFull is Y20993 which was formed 4800 years ago. So this particular SNP is not that recent. BY39280 would be more recent but perhaps not by much.\n\nThe Short Answer\n\nI would say that based on the 23andMe Haplogroup and the work that Roberta has done, these two families are not related. The common ancestor is R-L23 which was formed 6400 years before present. I’ll draw a tree for the two Lentz families:\n\nI would have thought that Roberta’s Lentz Line would be longer, but it must be an older branch or a branch with less branching in it. So from the top of the tree to the bottom is about 2,000 years, but we still have about 4,000 years to get to the useful genealogical time.\n\nHere is an R1b Tree:\n\nI have an arrow pointing to where my Mom’s Lentz family and Roberta’s Lentz family split. The split goes to Western Altantic for my Mom’s Lentz family and Eastern for Roberta’s Lentz family. Interesting. U152 is a major branch. U152 begins below the ‘ic’ of Atlantic. Checking the YDNA was pretty easy. That concludes the YDNA part of the Blog. Next I’ll add my Lentz autosomal DNA to DNAPainter\n\nAdding Lentz DNA to DNAPainter\n\nI can add the autosomal DNA to DNA Painter for the two Lentz matches I have at 23andMe. Here is one match added to my Lentz/Nicholson common ancestors:\n\nJereme adds important DNA that I didn’t know about before. I didn’t have any DNA from these two common ancestors previously on Chromosomes 2, 3, 4 and 15. I have less of a match with Jereme’s brother Will:\n\nI’ll paint in Will also even though he doesn’t add new information. Jereme matches me by 95 cM compared to Will’s 72 cM.\n\nJereme and Will upped my percentage of maternal mapped DNA from 30 to 32%. That is a significant jump at this stage of mapping:\n\nHere is the maternal and paternal side:\n\nI changed Lentz/Nicholson to a sort of pea green because it was the same blue as Clarke on my paternal side. I now have 41% DNA painted overall. I assume that this went up although I didn’t check to see what it was previously.\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\n23andMe has a useful feature that predicts your YDNA Haplogroup at no extra charge.\n\nThis feature can be used to see if you are related to male relatives of the same surname. In this case, I was related to two Lentz brothers with a predicted haplogroup. Roberta Estes had Lentz relatives tested for YDNA resulting in a known Haplogroup. I checked on Roberta’s Lentz relative’s YDNA haplogroup and it didn’t match up with my Lentz relative’s Haplogroup. I then found the common Haplogroup for the two Lentz families. The common haplogroup was over 6,000 years old.\n\nIt would be interesting to see if this could be used in other situations.\n\nThis Blog was short so I painted the autosomal DNA of my Lentz relatives using DNA Painter.\n\nSorting My Mom’s DNA with AutoCluster\n\nI already sorted my mom’s DNA with AutoCluster last week. However, since that time, Genetic Affairs has changed the look of their AutoCluster Chart. They now cluster the clusters which makes it easier to tell which ancestral groups go with which\n\nMy Mom’s Ancestry\n\nMom, Gladys’, father is German but his German ancestors lived for quite a while in a German colony in Latvia. His parents were Rathfelder and Gangnus. My mom’s maternal grandfather Lentz was also German but his ancestors had been in Philadelphia since the American Revolution. Gladys’ maternal grandmother was Nicholson. Her family moved to Philadelphia from Sheffield, England.\n\nThe First AutoCluster\n\nMy first AncestryDNA AutoCluster for my mom looked like this:\n\nThresholds: 20-600 cM\n\nMatches: 323\n\nMatches not used in clusters: 29\n\nClusters: 48\n\nI started writing a Blog on the results, but didn’t finish. Here is a spreadsheet for the above chart:\n\nThese clusters were sorted by the size of the cluster and I didn’t identify the first three clusters.\n\nMom’s New AutoCluster Results\n\nI expect the new results to be more organized and show where the groups of matches belong compared to the other groups of matches:\n\nThresholds: 20-600 cM\n\nMatches: 330\n\nMatches not used in clusters: 28\n\nClusters: 49\n\nI used the same thresholds in the new AutoCluster run. The results were similar but now the clusters are organized. Here is the new spreadsheet:\n\nI note that Elise and Rowena are in twice. I don’t know if that messes up the results. I didn’t show all the clusters as they go off the page.\n\nElise shows as being in Clusters 5 and 6 which doesn’t make sense. She doesn’t show in Cluster 5 but shows as a dark gray row to the left and above Cluster 6. Rowena shows as being in her own Cluster 15 which I don’t show above.\n\nUnraveling the Mystery of Mom’s DNA\n\nThe unraveling the mystery of mom’s DNA involves trying to figure out which parts of her DNA go with which common ancestors. The common ancestors are the common ancestors of her common matches. Her common matches are grouped together and those groups are grouped together, so let’s get started.\n\nHere are mom’s four grandparent lines:\n\nThese shown are the first and 2nd great-grandparent levels. By location, the top two grandparent are Latvia and the bottom two grandparent lines are Philadelphia and Sheffield, England.\n\nCluster 1: Nicholson/Ellis\n\nCluster 1 is easy. It is headed up by mom’s 2nd cousin Carolyn on the Nicholson/Ellis Line:\n\nCluster 38 – Rathfelder\n\nNext, I’ll go all the way down to Cluster 38. I believe that this is a Rathfelder Cluster:\n\nI may only have one Rathfelder Cluster with the two sisters, Astrid and Ingrid.\n\nMom’s Maternal and Paternal Clusters\n\nThe above two Clusters may have set the edge for Mom’s Clusters, but I’ll check in more detail later. Here is my assumption so far:\n\nAgain, this is a guess based on two clusters. I will need to check this out. I also will want to try to identify Lentz and Gangnus matches, if possible.\n\nFinding Lentz\n\nLentz matches have been difficult to find. Here is the Lentz tree with some of the descendant who have had their DNA tested:\n\nThe left branch has the closer matches, but they are also half Nicholson. Here is Radelle’s mom at Ancestry:\n\nThis is a little confusing because Radelle took the test and her mom, Delores shows in the tree. I became suspicious when I saw that Delores died in 2011. Radelle is in Cluster 32:\n\nI now have three of my mom’s grandparents. However, does that mean that Nicholson has 31 Clusters?\n\nMore Nicholson\n\nI can fill in one Cluster with Nigel. He has a large match with my mom going back to 1765 in Sheffield, England.\n\nI should have John Nicholson’s wife as my mom could just as easily be sharing her DNA. Here she is:\n\nI’m getting stuck on my mom’s maternal side, so time to switch to paternal:\n\nOtis and Cluster 39\n\nHere is Otis:\n\nHere Otis is 3rd cousin once removed and 4th cousin once removed on my mother’s Rathfelder side. This Chart describes Otis’ relationship to my mom as 5th cousin, once removed on the Gangnus side:\n\nThat means the Rathfelder side wins out (I think).\n\nOtis and the Colony Effect\n\nThe Colony is effect is this. You put a bunch of Germans in a Colony in Latvia and they want to marry other Germans:\n\nHere is Otis’ Cluster 39 in blue highlighted. Astrid is in the cluster above and to the left of Cluster 39. Otis is the top left match of the blue cluster. He also has shared matches with mom in other clusters below and to the right.\n\nDoing Some Latvian Genealogy\n\nI did a search for Latvia at my mother’s AncestryDNA match page:\n\nRobert shows his maternal grandparents coming from Latvia. That means I could try to do some genealogy on Roberts tree if I want. Robert is also in Mom’s Cluster 45.\n\nThe All-Latvia Database\n\nI was able to find the Resch family at:\n\nhttp://www.lvva-raduraksti.lv\n\nThis is a good web site for Latvian research.\n\nThe Latvians like to Latvianize names. So I don’t know if Retsch is a German name changed to Recs or if Recs changed to Retsch. I also found Zamuels birthplace and birth date. The last column is place of origin. This shows as Riga for father and son. I usually look for Irsu Pag. which is Hirschenhof. That would link with my ancestors.\n\nRobert has that Alma was born in Dresden, Germany, so I’ll look to Mazur and Rosenbach. I couldn’t find Rosenbach in the list. I did find some Martin’s in the Latvia Inhabitant list:\n\nThe closest Martin has his dad as Jēkabs.\n\nA Latvian Secret Weapon\n\nI was ready to give up but remembered I had a book on the Gangnus family. If Robert is related to me through that family, perhaps I could make a connection there.\n\nI left out the bottom where it says Darmstadt 2003.\n\nI looked up Retsch in this book and found one reference:\n\nThis reference says that Samual was born March 22, 1872 which is close to the April 3, 1872 I had above. Now all I have to do is make the connections. I have a feeling that the connections go back a way. What the above says is that Samuel married Charlotte Alma who was born 2 March 1867. Her parents were Johann Georg Gangnus and Marie Jacobine Schilling.\n\nI see what happened. Robert had Charlotte Alma Gangnus as Alma Magnus. That makes sense. When I first saw my mother’s grandmother’s name written, I think it was written as Youganis.\n\nGangnus Production Update\n\nNow I have two Gangnus/Gagnus families:\n\nThe good news is that I was about to give up on the Robert tree and then I remembered my Gangnus book. The bad news is that I’m getting lost in all these Gangnus families. However, I am starting to see our trees coming together in a confusing and interesting way.\n\nIf I understand this correctly, Robert and I are double 5th cousins. Robert and my mother are double fourth cousins, once removed. The other thing is that Robert is related on my mother’s paternal grandfather’s and grandmother’s side.\n\nIn order to display this on my spreadsheet, I added another row for Cluster 45:\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe new autoclustering look helped show where the clusters grouped with each other. I wasn’t able to identify many more clusters specifically, but now I know in what area they should belong.\n\nI was able to make a guess where my mother’s shared matches went from maternal to paternal\n\nI looked at some paternal clusters. However, intermarriage in Hirschenhof, Latvia made it difficult to nail down DNA to a specific grandfather in at least one case.\n\nI was able to build out Robert’s tree. Robert was in my mother’s Latvian Cluster 45. I used the All Latvia on-line Directory and a book I had on the Gangnus family in Latvia. However, after all that work, Robert appears to be equally related to my mom on both my mom’s paternal grandfather and grandmother’s sides.\n\nFun With an AncestryDNA Lentz Circle\n\nMy Lentz Line has been difficult to nail down. The genealogy has been difficult and it has been difficult to assign a lot of DNA to Lentz ancestors\n\nMy Lentz Circle at AncestryDNA\n\nAncestry has been helpful in the Lentz area. Here are my AncestryDNA Circles:\n\nLentz is one of my smallest circle with 9 members:\n\nSix of those 9 members are from my family. That leaves two other groups with a total of three people in them. In the Deborah Family group, there are two Deborah’s. They appear to be mother and daughter. I built out the tree of the mother and found a common ancestor in John Lentz. Then I found the tree of the daughter Deborah and she had already built out her tree as seen here:\n\nJohn Lentz is on the younger Debbie’s mother’s father’s father’s line or her great-grandfather Davenport’s Line. This matches up well with my Lentz Web Page:\n\nI was unclear as to whether John had one or two wives. Debbie has identified the wife as Elisabeth Riehl. I didn’t follow the line down of William Andrew. However, I have more information on my Ancestry Tree, which puts my Web Page out of date:\n\nLentz DNA\n\nOne interesting thing is that I do not match either Deborah at AncestryDNA. They do, however, match my mother and some of my siblings. Here is my mom’s match with the elder Deborah:\n\nWhat is more interesting is that the younger Debbie uploaded her DNA results to Gedmatch. This is what the match looks like between Debbie and my Mom:\n\nBy DNA, my mom, Gladys and the younger Debbie could be fourth cousins. However, Debbie and her mom match my mom at about the same amount of DNA. That means Debbie’s mom passed down all the Lentz DNA that matches my mom to her daughter. This DNA match is on the shortest Chromosome.\n\nVisual Phasing for My Siblings – Chromosome 22\n\nI performed visual phasing on my DNA. Here is what I had for Chromosome 22:\n\nThis matches up with what Gedmatch shows as Debbie’s matches with my family:\n\nIn this case the reportable matches start at about 15M, so that is where Jim, Heidi and Lori have Lentz DNA shown in green on the left hand side of my Chromosome 22 map above.\n\nA Lentz DNA Tree\n\nI have drawn a tree of the Lentz descendants who have had their DNA tested. I had missed Debbie, so she is not there yet:\n\nI am on the left side of the tree. I also descend from the Nicholsons and get a lot of matches with that family. The right side of the tree is more specific as I have no Nicholson relatives there, but the relationships are further out. I am already tracking two people from the William Andrew Line there.\n\nHere are the two Deborah’s added in:\n\nThis shows that my mom is a fourth cousin to the elder Deborah and I am a 5th cousin to the younger Deborah.\n\nHere is how Debbie matches Radelle, Al and Stephen on Chromosome 12:\n\nThis suggests triangulation between these four people which would indicate a common ancestor:\n\nMy mom matches Radelle and Deborah, but on different Chromosomes. Hence, the Ancestry Circle.\n\nPainting Debbie’s Match to My Mom\n\nThis is what I had previously for my mom’s John Lentz DNA based on her match with Radelle. That match is in dark green.\n\nI need to add Mom’s Lentz DNA to Chromosome 22:\n\nThis doesn’t look like much, but it doubles what my mom had on Chromosome 22 previously.\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nReviewing my AncestryDNA Circles lead me to a Lentz descendant who I had overlooked.\n\nOne of the people in the Circle had uploaded her DNA to Gedmatch. I had seen her match before, but didn’t know exactly how we connected on my mother’s line.\n\nBecause Debbie uploaded her DNA to Gedmatch, I was able to tell exactly where she matches different Lentz descendants.\n\nMy Closest DNA Match at MyHeritage with Unknown Connection\n\nBlaine Bettinger has a knack for posting polls at the Genetic Genealogy Tips & Techniques Facebook page. A recent one was:\n\nTODAY’S POLL: how much DNA do you share with your closest ‘unknown’ match at MyHeritage? Unknown = you haven’t yet placed them in your tree.\n\nMy Closest Unknown Match: Molly\n\nIt turns out my closest match is Molly. She also matches my mom which is a good hint. Here is how Molly matches my mom by DNA:\n\nOn interesting thing I just noticed about Molly is that she is age 20 or below. My mom is 96. I am guessing that there could be a two generation gap between Molly and my mom. Molly was born in 2003, so there could even be a three generation difference. Molly has a tree, but her parents and grandparents show as private. I assume that they are all still living. I have sent a message to Molly, so perhaps she will write back.\n\nShared Matches between Gladys and Molly\n\nMyHeritage shows shared matches between my mom, Gladys, and Molly:\n\nBeth is mom’s second closest unknown match and also matches Molly – though more distantly. Danielle and Bridget show icons which means that they have triangulating DNA. This is specific matching DNA that has come from a common ancestor.\n\nBeth’s Family Tree\n\nBeth has a pretty good family tree:\n\nHere is my mom’s tree:\n\nBeth’s Schroek side is from Pennsylvania. My mom’s mom was from Pennsylvania, so my theory right now is that the common ancestor is on my mom’s mom’s side on the bottom side of her above tree.\n\nA Pote Connection\n\nLooking a little more closely at Beth’s family tree, I see a Pote connection. My mom has no Pote in her ancestry, but she does have Nicholson and a collateral line married into the Pote family. That seems like a likely connection. Here is what I have at Ancestry:\n\nThis shows the Schroek/Pote/Nicholson connection differently than the tree Beth has.\n\nHere Beth has Martha N. Schroek. Her maiden name by my tree should be Pote. Beth also has Sarah Pote whose maiden name should be Nicholson. So the issue is mainly one of maiden names. However, Beth has Sarah Pote’s father as Sampson Pote, where I believe her father should be William Nicholson who is my mother’s great-grandfather.\n\nBeth must have already been on my radar as here she is in a Nicholson Tree:\n\nBeth shows as a 2nd cousin once removed to my mother.\n\nWhat About Molly?\n\nI mentioned above that I don’t have Molly’s tree. However, I can make a good guess as to where she is on the tree. Molly is probably at the level of Joshua and has as her ancestor Annie Nicholson born 1865 in Sheffield, England. That would make Molly a 1st cousin, three times removed to my mom.\n\nHere are some statistics:\n\nMolly would be at the top end of a 1st cousin three times removed or in a more reasonable range for a 1st cousin twice removed from my mom.\n\nGoing Down Molly and Gladys’ Shared Match List: Annette\n\nAnnette is after Beth on Molly and Gladys’ shared match list. It looks like Annette has a good tree with some common ancestors.\n\nThis shows that Gladys and Annette share Baker, Faunce and Peol ancestors.\n\nThe Philadelphia Bakers\n\nAnnette and Gladys are third cousins:\n\nFrom what I can tell, Conrad Baker was a successful fisherman in Kensington in present day Philadelphia:\n\nHere we see in the 1850 Census: Catherine and Mary and even a Pote. If I have it right, this part of Kensington is called Fishtown today.\n\nPainting the Baker/Faunce common ancestors.\n\nI use DNA Painter to paint common ancestors. Here is what I have for my mom so far:\n\nHere’s my mom’s “new” Baker/Faunce DNA in light blue on Chromosomes 3 and 11:\n\nI don’t think this DNA got passed down to me as I didn’t see a match between Annette and me at MyHeritage. This brought my mom’s mapped DNA up from 22% to 23%. On Chromosome 3, the change from brown to blue represents a crossover my mom has from her Nicholson grandparent side to her Lentz grandparent side.\n\nMolly’s Next Shared Match with Gladys: Danielle\n\nThe good thing about Danielle is that she triangulates with my mom and Molly:\n\nThe area where the triangulation occurs is on Chromosome 3.\n\nHere is Danielle’s tree:\n\nHere is another tree I found at Ancestry:\n\nThis was more filled out but was missing Leon Edwards. Ancestry has Danielle and my mom as distant relatives. So it may be difficult to find common ancestors. However, I didn’t see any obvious family name matches to people in my mom’s known ancestry. I’ll just have to wait until later to solve this mystery. Danielle’s ancestors were from the same areas as my mom’s, so the potential is there for finding a common ancestor.\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nA question by Blaine Bettinger lead to some DNA and genealogical research at MyHeritage\n\nI didn’t figure out how I am related to Molly but guessed at a relationship to my mom and a possible Nicholson or Lentz ancestry.\n\nI re-found Beth with a shared Nicholson ancestry.\n\nI found Annette who has an interesting connection to my mom on the Baker/Faunce line from early Kensington in current day Philadelphia. I was able to “paint” this DNA to my mom.\n\nI found a person triangulating with Molly and my mom, but was not able to find a common ancestor.\n\nMy Mother’s Best Lentz DNA Match\n\nI’ve been in touch with Radelle for a while. First, we were in touch over Lentz genealogy without the DNA part. Some of the Lentz genealogy that I had done in the past was helpful in Radelle finding parents for her ancestor Eliza Lentz. Radelle later took the AncestryDNA test and recently uploaded those results to Gedmatch.com.\n\nLentz Genealogy\n\nI have made a Lentz tree for those that have had their DNA tested and uploaded the results to Gedmatch. There would be a bigger tree of those who haven’t had their DNA tested.\n\nI’m on the left side of the chart. Radelle is on the right side of the chart. Radelle, Al, and Stephen descend from Eliza and William Andrew Lentz. Note that Al and Stephen’s great grandfather is Phillip Miller Chappell. Phillip Miller is discussed below as the 2nd husband of Eliza who married John Lentz at the top of the chart. Phillip Miller most likely raised the young Lentz family. Judy, Joshua, my mom and her children and my 1st cousin Cindy descend from Jacob Lentz b. 1818. Because Jacob George Lentz b. 1866 married Annie Nicholson, I can’t tell for sure if the matches with Judy, Joshua and Cindy are on the Lentz side or Nicholson side. Radelle and my mom are 4th cousins. Radelle is 4th cousin once removed to everyone else except for Joshua. Radelle is 4th cousin, 3 times removed to Joshua.\n\nI had a difficult time nailing down John Lentz years ago when I was working on Lentz genealogy. I wasn’t sure if there were one or two John Lentz’s in the area at the time. From what I could tell, John died and his wife Eliza married Phillip Miller. Here is an 1877 death notice for Eliza:\n\nNotice that the funeral reception was at Eliza’s daughter in law’s house. Mary A Lentz was my 3rd great grandmother, the wife of Jacob Lentz b. 1818. Eliza was Jacob Lentz’s (b. 1818) mom, so Mary A Lentz his wife was Eliza’s daughter in law. Based on the above death notice, Eliza would have been born about 1796.\n\nWho Was the Eliza Lentz Married to John Lentz and Phillip Miller?\n\nI see that Radelle has a possible name for Eliza:\n\nThis record was from Trinity Church, Oxford. According to Wikipedia:\n\nOld Trinity Church, also known as Trinity Church, Oxford, is a historic Episcopal church founded in 1698 in Oxford Township, Pennsylvania, which is now part of Philadelphia\n\nHere is another hint that came up for me at Ancestry. This is from Kensington\n\nThis may fit in better as far as the date goes. This would mean that Eliza was married at about age 26. The first marriage, Eliza would have been married at about age 17.\n\nHowever, having said that, it does appear that Radelle is right as I have that the three sons of John were born before December 1st 1822. Perhaps Elizabeth Refford died in childbirth at the birth of Wiliam Andrew Lentz who was born 13 May 1822. John would have had no one to take care of his young family. So perhaps he remarried Eliza Rihl later that same year. Something to think about. However, then John Lentz died in 1823. Eliza marries Phillip Miller in 1825. If I have my facts right, then the Lentz children were raised by a step mother and a step father.\n\nThe DNA Part\n\nI said that Radelle was my mom’s largest Lentz DNA match. Here is how they match at gedmatch:\n\nTheir estimated common ancestors are at 4.4 generations based on the DNA match. Their actual ancestors are 5 generations back, so that is a bit more than average DNA that they share. Here are some more matches Radelle has with my family:\n\nHeidi and Jon are my siblings. Gladys is my mom. Heidi got the same match with Radelle that my mom had. Jon and I got less. My two sisters Lori and Sharon don’t match Radelle.\n\nMapping My Family’s DNA onChromosome 2\n\nI have my DNA mapped. That mapping shows where my siblings and I got our DNA based on how our four grandparents contributed. Any match with Radelle should be on the Lentz grandparent side.\n\nThis shows why Jon and I had less than a fuill dose of Lentz DNA from our mom. My mom matches Radelle between 171 and 212M. I have a crossover at 186. That means on maternal Chromosome 2, my Lentz DNA ends at 186M and the Rathfelder DNA takes over. Lori is has all Rathfelder DNA in that area (from my mom’s dad) so she doesn’t match Radellether. Jon has a Crossover at 180M, so he matches Radelle’s Lentz DNA less than I do. Here is a close-up of the area where Radelle matches me and my brother Jon:\n\nWe match Radelle only in the yellow Lentz segments. I didn’t show Heidi, but she has a longer Lentz segment than Jon or me in this area of Chromosome 2.\n\nDNA Matches to My Mom and Radelle\n\nAt Gedmatch, there is a way to find common matches to two people. I did this for my mom and Radelle. When those matches are on the same segment, that tells me that these people should share the same ancestors. Here is how my mom matches Radelle and four others on Chromosome 2:\n\n#3 had a tree at Gedmatch.\n\nA Lanz/Lantz family may be a link to the Lentz family.\n\nAnother Chromosome Map\n\nKitty Munson has a chromosome mapping utility at her web site. Using my new match with Radelle, I get this:\n\nThe new match with Radelle translates to the DNA I got from John Lentz b. 1792 (or his wife who appears to be Elisabeth). That new piece of DNA appears in pink on my maternal side Chromosome 2. This map is different from the mapping I did with Chromosome 2 above that only has my grandparents. This map uses matches from actual people with known ancestry. The DNA match with Radelle pushed back what I had on the Lentz family over 70 years.\n\nOther Matches?\n\nUnfortunately, I didn’t see other matches between Radelle and other Lentz descendants. It may be that the relationships are too distant and the DNA dropped out. However, Radelle matches my mom and three out of five of her children. My mom matches others on the Jacob George Lentz branch. That implies that the DNA match between my mom and Radelle also applies to them:\n\nHere are the chances of matching a specific level of cousin:\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nRadelle is my mom’s biggest identified Lentz DNA match. This helps solidify the genealogy that Radelle and I have done.\n\nWith previous Jacob George Lentz descendants matches, I couldn’t tell if the DNA represented Lentz or Nicholson. The match with Radelle would be the first Lentz-only identified DNA match.\n\nI was able to add a late 1700’s Lentz DNA segment to my Chromosome map\n\nRadelle got me thinking again about John Lentz, Elisabeth and Eliza. I came up with a possible scenario for this family which had the children being raised by two step-parents.\n\nRadelle does not match other Lentz desendants by DNA. This may be due to the distance of the relationships. After fourth cousin level, the chances of matching by DNA drops off.\n\nI’ll be waiting to see if we find other Lentz DNA matches. These matches seem to be a bit rare.\n\nBlaine’s X Chromosome Challenge\n\nRecently, Blaine Bettinger challenged people on his Genetic Genealogy Tips & Techniques page:\n\nWho is your closest X match at GEDmatch, that you didn’t target test?\n\nBlaine’s previous challenge challenge produced some interesting results and I was running out of ideas, so I thought that I’d try it. Technically, my closest X match is fourth on my Gedmatch list below. That match is my maternal 1st cousin Rusty at 120 cM, but I think that Blaine meant to look for the first match that we didn’t know.\n\nThe top six matches are my mom, four siblings and a maternal 1st cousin. I have four matches at the bottom of the list. They all have the same email address, so I assume they are closely related. These are my highest X Chromosome matches where I don’t know how we are related. A good surprise is that the top match Alice has a family tree indicated by a GED hyperlink.\n\nI quickly checked the GED link looking for maternal matches. My mom’s matches are usually German on her dad’s side, or from Sheffield, England. I was disappointed to not see any of those places on the list. I did however see a Pennsylvania name of Faunce. My mom is from Pennsylvania and has a Faunce ancestor.\n\nHere is Alice’s tree as posted at Gedmatch :\n\nHere is my mom’s tree:\n\nIf Alice’s tree had a Jacob Faunce, then I would have had a match and Catherine and Elizabeth Faunce could have been sisters. However, it is not that easy.\n\nBack to the DNA\n\nHere is the detailed match I have with Alice:\n\nHere is the results of mapping the X Chromosome to myself and 4 siblings:\n\nMy match with Alice was in my Lentz area which leads back to Faunce. I have the bar starting with J. It looks like Sharon and Jonathan should also match Alice on the X. Here is the path that the X Chromosome inheritance could have taken for my mom:\n\nAlice also has a clear sailing path for her X Chromosome. It goes from her mom Rosalie, to her grandmother Alice, then her great grandmother Ida, 2nd great grandfather Anson Hale and finally to Alice’s 3rd great grandmother Elizabeth Faunce. Now that I’ve established a route where there could be an X Chromosome match, I need to get back to the genealogy.\n\nCatherine Faunce and Her Daughter Mary A Baker\n\nIt took me a long time to figure out who was the wife of my 2nd great grandfather George Washington Lentz b. 1840. I was determined to find out who she was. The 1910 Census George’s son Jacob Lentz gave me a hint.\n\nHere on Earl Street there were three generations of Lentz. My grandmother, Emma, her dad Jacob Lentz and his mother Mary Lentz. Of particular interest was the fact that an Aunt, Sohpia Kemble was living with them. She was 72 at the time. Next, I go back 10 years to 1900:\n\nMary Lentz is living with her two sisters in Palmyra, NJ. One of Mary’s sisters is single – Elizabeth Baker. That gives me the maiden name of Mary Lentz. The Findagrave.com has an article on Mary Baker Lentz’s mom who was Catherine Faunce:\n\nHere is the marriage record for Catherine Faunce in 1824:\n\nThe record reader interpreted Faunce as Fanner.\n\nElizabeth Faunce\n\nAlice has her ancestor Elizabeth Faunce as the mother of Anson Hale on her tree. Here is Anson and mother Elizabeth in 1860 along with the rest of the family with them at that time:\n\nHere Elizabeth was born in Pennsylvania. I had a lot of trouble finding information on Elizabeth outside of Ancestry Trees. This makes me suspicious that the trees are copying each other. The 1880 Census tells us that Elizabeth’s parents were also born in Pennsylvania. I was able to find a tree Alice put on FamilySearch:\n\nAbove, I’m not sure the jump from Pennsylvania to Plymouth, MA is warranted. My understanding is that the Philadelphia Faunce family was originally the German Fans which got anglicized to Faunce. The Plymouth, MA Faunce was probably always the English Faunce. Another point is that in the 1880 Census, Elizabeth [Faunce] Hale lists both her parents as being born in Pennsylvania.\n\nWilliam Hale and Elizabeth are in Howell in 1850:\n\nJoseph appears to be their eldest. He was born around 1832, so let’s say William and Elizabeth married in 1831. It turns out that may have been a good guess as I find this at Ancestry:\n\nI at least feel better finding a record outside of a Family Tree. Now I feel justified in adding the Faunce surname to Elizabeth. However, note that these two were married in Philadelphia where my mom’s Faunce ancestors lived. From my tree, I have a Jacob Faunce living in Kensington, Philadelphia in 1820. At this time, Elizabeth would have been between 7 and 12 depending on whether she was born in 1809 or 1813.\n\nThere were eight people living in Jacob’s house in 1820. Let’s say there were two parents and six children. Of the six children, four were girls. One was under 10, two were 10-15 and one was at least 16. It could be that Elizabeth Faunce was one of these four girls.\n\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nMy closest non-identified X match is on my Lentz line\n\nThat X inheritance line could follow back to my ancestor Catherine Faunce in Philadelphia\n\nMy closest match Alice’s X inheritance line could follow back to her ancestor Elizabeth Faunce who married William Hale in Philadelphia in 1831\n\nAlice has a father for Elizabeth who was from Plymouth Massachusetts\n\nBased on the DNA and genealogy I believe this Plymouth father may not be correct for Elizabeth Faunce.\n\nI am suggesting that Elizabeth Faunce is linked with a Philadelphia Faunce family based on DNA and genealogy.\n\nAlthough I have shown that it is possible for Elizabeth’s father to be my Ancestor Jacob Faunce, I have not been able to prove that by the DNA and genealogy.\n\nSadie’s Nicholson DNA\n\nRecently, I’ve been in touch with a new DNA relative on my mom’s Nicholson side. Sadie showed up at AncestryDNA as many matches do. Sadie, however, also showed up as a Shared Ancestor Hint. These are good. As long as the genealogy on both sides is good, this shows how you connect to your DNA match by common ancestors.\n\nEmma above is my grandmother and Martha is Sadie’s great grandmother. That makes us third cousins once removed to each other. Speaking of Emma, I found a photo of her online that I hadn’t seen before. My cousin Judy in the chart below had posted it:\n\nEmma is holding her Lentz niece. However, they are both Nicholson descendants. The niece was born in 1918.\n\nHere is how Sadie fits in with some of the other Nicholson DNA-tested relatives:\n\nI’ve chopped off some of my unrelated Rathfelder ancestors on the left. Sadie descends from Sarah who represents a new daughter of William Nicholson and Martha Ellis. Actually Sarah Nicholson is new to this DNA project and the eldest child of William and Martha Nicholson.\n\nSadie’s Nicholson DNA\n\nSadie matches me and my 4 siblings as well as my mom by DNA. She matches my cousin Rusty. She doesn’t match Judy and Joshua. She matches Joan and Joan’s sister Linda. She matches Carolyn but not Nigel. The largest Nicholson match that Sadie has is on Chromosome 6:\n\nHere she matches:\n\nJoan\n\nMe\n\nMy mom\n\nMy sister Heidi\n\nMy sister Sharon\n\nMy Brother Jonathan\n\nAnother Nicholson relative that hasn’t gotten back to me\n\nMy cousin Rusty\n\nMy sister Lori\n\nIt looks like a lot of people, but it could be reduced to Joan, my mom, the other Nicholson relative and my cousin Rusty. That is because my siblings and I got all our Nicholson DNA from our mom. These matches form a Triangulation Group:\n\nThe theory says that these four people got their specific matching DNA from either William Nicholson or Martha Ellis. However, because we don’t know which, I’ve circled them both. This doesn’t mean that the other people that didn’t match on Chromosome 6 don’t descend from William and Martha. However, it does give solid evidence that the ones that do match do descend from the couple.\n\nA Chromosome Mapping Side Trip\n\nIn Sadie’s matches, I noticed that Sadie had a shorter match with my sister Lori who is #9\n\nThis means that Lori likely has a crossover where her match stops around 56M. Here is Lori’s match with Sadie:\n\nIt looks like chromosome mapping would go beyond the scope of this Blog, so I’ll address this later. My assumption is that Lori’s maternal Chromosome 6 switches from her Lentz grandmother (whose mother was a Nicholson) to her Rathfelder grandfather at about position 56M.\n\nSadie’s Nicholson X Chromosome Matches\n\nThe important rule about the X Chromosome is that it doesn’t travel down from father to son. That means if there are two males in a line going up from a DNA tester to a common ancestor, then there can’t be an X Chromosome match there. This applies to only Nigel in my chart. Nigel is from a long line of Nicholson males.\n\nHere are Sadie’s top three X matches:\n\nThe first match is Joan. I don’t know who the second match is. Probably a non-Nicholson match. The third match is to Judy in the chart above. The pink zero means that Judy shares no autosomal DNA (Chromosomes 1-22) with Sadie but does share a sizeable X Chromosome match. Here are Sadie’s X matches with these two Nicholson cousins on the Gedmatch Chromosome Browser:\n\n#1 is Sadie’s match with Joan and #2 is her match with Judy. Again, we can’t know if this DNA is from William Nicholson or Martha Ellis. This is because Sadie, Joan and Judy descend from daughters of William and Martha. If one of them had descended from a son, then we would know that the X Chromosome they got would have to be from Martha Ellis.\n\nMy Chromosome Map\n\nI almost forgot to update my Chromosome Map based on Sadie. This is the one based on all my identified cousins that match by DNA. Kitty Munson developed the software for this:\n\nSadie shows up on my map as maroon on Chromosome 2 and 6. The 2 is important as I had no maternal match on that large Chromosome prior to the match with Sadie. Here are the specifics of my match with Sadie:\n\nCan 83 cM Last for 7 Generations?\n\nRecently, I came across a DNA match at Ancestry. This match was on my mother’s side. Here is how the match showed at AncestryDNA:\n\nThe match, Nigel, showed as a predicted 4th cousin. However, the range stated he was possibly a 4th to 6th cousin to my mother (and my sister). Further, the matching surnames looked familiar based on my mother’s ancestry. However, the Ellis on Nigel’s side was a female from the early 1700’s. Any possible Ellis connection would be before the Nicholson/Staniforth connection.\n\nThe Common Ancestors\n\nI wrote to Nigel and mentioned that it looked like we were related on at least one line. I had a bit of trouble figuring out exactly how we were related as did Nigel. It helped me to map it out – especially as Nigel has 4 Johns in a row in his ancestry.\n\nIt turns out that Nigel was not just a 4th cousin as predicted by AncestryDNA, but a 4th cousin, 2 times removed to my mom. Our common ancestor based on the chart above is John Nicholson baptized 1765. That is where the 7 generations comes in. John Nicholson is 7 generations before Nigel and 5 generations before my mom. However, my sister Heidi and Nigel have the same DNA as my mom and Nigel and Heidi is 6 generations away from the probable common ancestors of John Nicholson and Sarah Stanisforth.\n\nNigel at Gedmatch\n\nI mentioned my Nicholson webpage to Nigel which he enjoyed. Nigel was willing to upload his DNA to Gedmatch for my research. Here is how his match looks like with my mother:\n\nHere is where the 83.8 cM comes in. Hence the title of the Blog: “Can 83 cM Last for 7 Generations?”\n\nA chromosome 1 map\n\nHere is a map of my Chromosome 1 kindly produced by M MacNeill – prairielad_genealogy@hotmail.com. The top portion of this map was based on raw data DNA. It shows how my 2 sisters and I inherited our DNA from our 4 grandparents.\n\nThe four light blue bars at the bottom of the above image show the DNA matches that Nigel has to my mom, my sister Heidi, myself and my sister Sharon near the beginning of Chromosome 1. Nigel is related on my mother’s mother’s side. Notice how Nigel’s light blue matches below correspond to the DNA mapped to my mother’s mother’s light blue regions above. Heidi inherited a large maternal grandmother segment in this area of Chromosome 1 from our mom that had the large match to Nigel. The entire segment mapped to my maternal grandmother’s side appears to make up the match I have with Nigel.\n\nA Nicholson Triangulation Group\n\nMy mother forms a Triangulation Group (TG) with her 2nd cousin Carol and 4th cousin, twice removed, Nigel. The TG is on Chromosome 3. To show the TG, I have to take the Gedmatch threshold down a little.\n\nMy mom’s match to Nigel\n\nLikewise, the threshold was reduced to show the match between Nigel and Carol.\n\nNigels’s Match to Carol\n\nNo threshold change was needed for the match between my mother and her second cousin Carol.\n\nMom’s match to carol\n\nHere is what the TG looks like with the likely common ancestors of Nicholson and Staniforth:\n\nAre There Other Possibilities?\n\n83.3 cM is way off the charts for 4th cousin or 4th cousin, 2 times removed. I brought the question to the ISOGG Facebook Group. The prevailing wisdom there is to check for other closer relatives (which makes sense). If there are missing ancestors on either side of the match (my family or Nigel’s), that may leave room for other more recent common ancestors.\n\nmy ancestry\n\nFirst, the match is on my mother’s side. So that narrows things down. Secondly, my mom is 1/4 English. Therefor, I am only looking at 1/8 of my ancestry and 1/4 of my mom’s.\n\nAbove, I have circled in yellow the one out of 4 grandparents of my mother that could match Nigel as Nigel has not shown any German ancestry. Annie Nicholson is 2 generations back from my mom (my mom’s grandmother).\n\nHere is an enlargement of Ann Nicholson’s ancestors:\n\nThis shows that in the 5th generation from my mom where the assumed common ancestors of our match is found, most of the ancestors are identified. Mary doesn’t have a last name and I’m missing parents for Charles Ellis. So even if the new common ancestors were in this generation, they would be in the same generation of our currently assumed common ancestors. But what if Nigel has an unidentified ancestor in his 6th generation that matches someone in my mom’s 4th generation? That would be a closer match. So let’s look at Nigel’s tree.\n\nNigel’s tree\n\nNigel’s father’s side appears to be from Scotland. His mother’s side is from England. Nigel’s maternal grandmother is from the Derbyshire area and his maternal grandfather is from the Sheffield area. So that narrows things down to 1/4 for Nigel. My mom’s only English ancestors were from the Sheffield area, so we will concentrate on Nigel’s maternal grandfather’s side.\n\nHere are Nigel’s maternal grandfather’s Sheffield ancestors:\n\nThe tentative common ancestors between Nigel and my family is one generation off this chart. The John Nicholson married to Martha Jow had as parents another John Nicholson who married Sarah Stanisforth. The ancestry above shows that Nigel has 6 out of 16 Sheffield ancestors 6 generations away. Is this a problem?\n\nNigel’s missing ancestors\n\nAbove, I had said that if Nigel had missing ancestors in generation 6 that matched with my mom’s generation 4 ancestors, then there could be a closer match. I’ll look at thee various possibilities and we will decide if they pose a problem.\n\nA problem that I hadn’t considered previously would be if Nigel’s unknown 6th generation matched with my mom’s 2 unknown ancestors in her 5th generation. Those unknowns are the parents of Charles Ellis born 1795. I don’t think that scenario is very likely. First, it would not likely be on the Ellis side. Charles Ellis’ father would also be an Ellis and Nigel doesn’t have any Ellis’s in his known generation 5 ancestors. But what about Nigel’s unknown female ancestors in generation 5? They were already married and having the children that are known in Nigel’s generation 4. So any unknown common ancestor there would have to be in Nigel’s generation 7 which is back where we started.\n\nAnother scenario would have a missing female ancestor of Nigel remarrying. However, usually in this case, there would only be a 1/2 match and thuse 1/2 the DNA coming down to Nigel and my family. I would rule this scenario out based on the very large DNA match between my family and Nigel.\n\nWhen I look at other scenarios the reasoning seems to be similar as what I mention in #1 above. The options appear to bring us back to Nigel’s generation 7 again. That means that we either have an additional set of common ancestors in addition to the one that we have identified or we don’t. It makes sense to me to go with the ancestors that we do have rather than worry about missing ones we may have. Put another way, I’m gambling on the possibility that there were not additional common ancestors in Nigel’s generation 7 and my mom’s generation 5.\n\nON the other hand: Our non-conformist ancestors\n\nOne thing that Nigel and my family’s Sheffield ancestors had in common were that they were non-conformists. This means that they attended a church that was not the official Church of England. In their case it was the Congregational Church. Perhaps there were other types of churches that they attended during the family history. What I don’t know is if people in these these groups married cousins to keep within the faith, or if there were enough of these non-conformists around that this wasn’t necessary.\n\nSo, Where Are We?\n\nThe prevailing wisdom is that if there are missing ancestors, then the matches could be in a closer generation in those missing spots.\n\nI would like to push back the prevailing wisdom a bit. Even if we are missing some ancestors, there are things that can be deduced about those missing ancestors based on known ancestors in the next more recent generation.\n\nIn genealogy research and DNA matching, things are not usually known 100 percent. I believe that there is a high probability that John Nicholson and Sarah Stanisforth are the common ancestors between Nigel and my family represented by a relatively large amount of DNA that made it down through both of our lines from the 1700’s.\n\nKitty Cooper’s Chromosome Maps\n\nAbove I have shown the genealogy and a Triangulation Group for the Nicholsons. I have also shown that the match between Nigel and my family is through my correct grandparent’s (mother’s mother’s) DNA. Now that I have convinced myself that John Nicholson and Sarah Stanisforth produced the matching DNA between Nigel and my family I will add that couple to my Kitty Cooper generated Chromosome Map:\n\nThe Nicholson/Staniforth connection on my map above is shown on Chromosomes 1 and 3. Note that this is not the oldest DNA that I have and that the matches are in line with 2 other ancestors (Frazer in Green and Rathfelder in purple) from around the same time period.\n\nOf course, I can’t leave it at that. Now I need to show my mom’s updated Chromosome map:\n\nNote the following:\n\nMy mom’s segments are larger than my corresponding maternal segments as she is one generation back from me\n\nMy mom’s Nicholson/Stanisforth DNA is shown in purple.\n\nMy mom does not show DNA from that couple at Chromosome 3. That is because her match came in at 6.9 cM which is just under the 7.0 Gedmatch threshold. If I wanted to be more accurate, I would have added that match also – especially as that is the match that resulted in the triangulation group.\n\nNicholson DNA\n\nGreat news. My 3rd cousin, Joan, who is a Nicholson, posted her 1st cousin once removed, Carol’s DNA to Gedmatch.com. Carol is also a Nicholson descendant and my mother’s 2nd cousin.\n\nThis does 3 things:\n\nImproves my Chromosome mapping a la Kitty Munson\n\nIdentifies my DNA by grandparent that I have mapped as per the Kathy Johnston method\n\nCreates a great link to the Nicholson side of the family that has been lost over the years.\n\nIn addition, these matches between Carol and my family are all higher than average. So even though my sisters and I are 2nd cousins once removed to Carol, we have about the amount of shared DNA to make us look like 2nd cousins.\n\nWilliam Nicholson born 1836 Sheffield England and Martha Ellis His Wife: Our Common Ancestors\n\nThe common ancestors between Joan, Carol, my mother Gladys, me and my 2 sisters are William Nicholson and Martha Ellis.\n\nJudy and Joshua have tested also, but they are from both the Lentz and Nicholson side. Joan and Carol are helpful in that our only connection is Nicholson. That is the advantage of testing 2nd cousins. They usually can limit your matches to one of your 4 grandparents – or in this case, one of my mother’s 4 grandparents.\n\nA Brief Sketch of William Nicholson\n\nI am happy to have a photo of William. William was born in Sheffield, England in 1836. Working conditions were deplorable in Sheffield at this time. William’s father died in 1840 when William was 4. According to the newspaper, “On Thursday the 30th April, after a severe indisposition, aged 41, Mr. Matthew Nicholson, late of Suffolk road, leaving a numerous family to lament their loss.” The family was numerous with 12 children. William was number ten. William’s mother Martha made some money operating a beerhouse. Beerhouses were promoted at this time in England to counteract the effects of drunkenness due to gin consumption. This article was written about a year and a half after William’s father Matthew died:\n\nWilliam married Martha Ellis in 1854. William didn’t manufacture pen knives like the older generation but manufactured saws. He had 4 children in Sheffield, England between 1860 and 1869. After the Nicholson’s made the big move, he had 3 more children born in Philadelphia between 1871 and 1879. In Philadelphia he continued with his saw making skills. William’s wife Martha died in 1887. William married Emma Gardiner and had 2 more daughters. William died in 1919 in Philadelphia at age 83 – more than twice the age of his father when he died in Sheffield. I think William made a good decision to leave those unhealthy work conditions in Sheffield.\n\nUpdating My Chromosome Map\n\nHere is what the DNA of my ancestors looks like mapped out:\n\nMy mother’s side is on the bottom of each chromosome bar. The DNA I got from the Nicholsons only is in light yellow. The light yellow also represents the DNA matches I have with Joan and her first cousin once removed Carol. Note on Chromosome 18 that the color goes from orange to yellow. There, the DNA I got is switching from my mother’s father’s side (Rathfelder) to my mother’s mother’s side (Nicholson).\n\nMapping My Chromosomes a la Kathy Johnston\n\nI have also mapped my chromosomes using a method developed by Kathy Johnston. This method compares the matches that I have with my 2 sisters. From this, I can figure out how I inherited each of my 4 grandparents’ DNA. However, to distinguish the 4 grandparents, I need to have reference points. Carol’s DNA matches with me and my sisters provided many of those reference points for my mother’s mother’s side of the family. Where before on many chromosomes, I only knew I had maternal grandparent 1 or 2, now I know that they are Rathfelder or Lentz. [My Lentz grandmother’s mother was a Nicholson.]\n\nFor example, here is the same Chromosome 18:\n\nMy Chromosome is the bottom one. The other two are for my sisters. I match Carol from 71-74. So that confirms that the orange segment on the bottom right is from my mother’s Lentz side. And then more specifically through my mother’s mother’s Lentz mother’s Nicholson side. This change at positions 71 from green to orange on my mother’s father’s side to my mother’s mother’s side corresponds to the actual previous Kitty Munson DNA map where the color went from orange to light yellow.\n\nThere will be more time to look at Nicholson DNA in the future. For right now, I am glad that DNA has brought back together a family that settled in the Philadelphia area from Sheffield, England in 1870. My mom has only mentioned fond memories of her Nicholson grandmother. Those included Annie Nicholson Lentz’ cooking abilities and bringing my mom to church as a child. I expect other Nicholson branches have similar great memories."
