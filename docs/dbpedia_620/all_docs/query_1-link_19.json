        "text": "When I set up Community Driving School CIC I wanted to have a National presence to push our cause into parts of the UK where people needed to become employed. Well, here is our first foray into that dream of mine. This car is called \"Smiler\" and we will be making a video to explain more about that in due course. Smiler will be based in Southport with Steve Richmond and there is a very personal link to the Royal Marines. Steve wanted to join with us for a while now, but personal reasons meant he was unable to. Now the time is right and we walk together on this journey. My sincere thanks to Chris Yates Graham Doyle from D2NA for making this happen. You deserve so much credit for putting your business ethos into action and sponsoring Smiler. I also want to thank Dean Johnson from Signs & Imaging for wrapping Smiler and making this dream real. This is the result when a community comes together to make positive things happen. Everyone benefits. #business #collaboration #sponsorship #dreams\n\nWith the devastating news that Grahame Thorpe has taken his own life, I wanted to share with you all, why I am so pleased to still be alive and in this world. I hope it resonates with people feeling so low and believing the world would be a better place without them. The world will not be a better place.. Not at all. It will be a darker place as yet another light goes out. In the words of Linkin Park \"If they say Who cares if one more light goes out? In the sky of a million stars It flickers, flickers Who cares when someone's time runs out? If a moment is all we are We're quicker, quicker Who cares if one more light goes out? Well I do The reminders pull the floor from your feet In the kitchen, one more chair than you need oh And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair Just 'cause you can't see it, doesn't mean it, isn't there\" Please ALL of you keep your eyes on loved ones. Just one moment is all it takes to help that person change their minds from the ultimate ending to being happy being on this planet. I hope my story of being a normal person raised on a council estate in South-East London to now owning my own social enterprise business shines a light into those dark spaces of your life. You can do it.. You can be who you want to be and achieve your own life goals.

Not only does Sara have vast experience at will writing and making sure it is watertight, she has a heart of gold. She donates a percentage of every will towards some good causes and we are one of the recipients of her generosity. Sara has met some of our pupils and their stories resonated with her and they enjoyed meeting her. This makes being a sponsor a powerful thing for her business and you can listen to why she is involved by clicking the video in the COMMENTS section below. If your business wants to be part of our community of businesses, please contact me. You can make a difference and you will see where your support goes. #sponsor #willwriting #business\n\nHello my LinkedIn contacts. Community Driving School CIC are hosting a Comedy and Magic night and we would like to gauge interest. If you own a small business and wanted to have a Christmas Meal to celebrate with you team, then join us. Hosted at the amazing Judd's Folly Hotel just outside Faversham with comedians, magicians and a fabulous three course meal to round things off. Formally an elegant 17th century Classical Palladian house, the hotel is set within 4 acres of beautiful parkland and on a clear day has views over Faversham Quay and the Swale Estuary. It is located nearby the 13th century village of Ospringe. The date is to be confirmed but the line up is astonishing. If you'd like to register your interest and receive some updates, please email events@thecds.org.uk and mention Judds Japery and we'll keep you informed. Have a great night out with laughter and astonishment at THE #Christmas Party of the Year.\n\nYes, I admit to going early here... But I am excited because next month I find out if Community Driving School CIC is shortlisted for an award. Won't say which one, but I get so excited as if I am an Elf at Christmas. Not a Legolas type of Elf of course.. No, they are a bit too prim to show emotions. But one of those annoying buggers who thinks Christmas is the ONLY event in the calendar. I love winning awards for my business as it shows the hard work WE all put into it has paid off. Just the simple fact I have applied is exciting. I have no idea if we will be shortlisted as a finalist and yes I care, but the excitement is just incredible. Do awards make you feel this way? Or, is it just me?\n\nIt was only this year I decided to confront my demons and Deborah Mulvany was ideally placed for me to take this HUGE step. My father was both a dad and a bastard. When he was sober he was funny, kind and made time for my sister and me. However, when he was drunk, he was violent, bullying and a monster. These two people that were my dad have played a HUGE part in my life and in shaping who I am today. There were times I dreaded dad coming home as I knew which version would be staggering through the door. Even as a child, my father hit me and once knocked me across the floor where I was left to lay bleeding and in pain. My mother couldn't help as she was in the same condition as me and my sister was told to go upstairs. She witnessed this and it has affected her so badly that she herself is now an alcoholic and it helps her numb the pain in her mind. And since the death of our mother in 2015, my sister has been worse than ever. For some reason she cannot face the demons as I have been able to and it saddens me. Therapy has unlocked so many \"dark places\" in my head that I had forgotten them. Childhood trauma, as I am aware can be help onto and act as a weight around you. It can drag you into the darkest of places and you feel as if you are being stifled by life in general. When I was boxing training last year, I froze at the very fist sparring session as all that filled my mind was my dad approaching me and I got smacked up a bit. That shook me out of things and I fought back. But just for that moment, I was back in my 6 year old body... However, since talking with Debs abut all of this, I feel much better equipped to deal with my dad and all that went on because of the therapy. I don't feel so burdened by the past and now look forwards with a different view on life. I would like to write a book about my life, but who the hell would be interested in reading about a fat bloke from the Elephant & Castle that isn't famous... LOL #mentalhealth #therapy\n\nSome people you meet in business networking and you discover they have the same ethos as you. Well, Sam is one of those people who's heart is HUGE and her passion for the community is beyond measure. Sam runs her own business, Hearing Matters in Kings Hill, Kent. She is an audiologist with a remit to help EVERYONE understand the importance of hearing and what happens to your ears. She is compassionate, caring and incredibly knowledgeable and she has helped me. I suffer with tinnitus thanks to many years of high volume Rock and Metal music. This had an effect on me which I didn't realise or want to acknowledge, because that is for other people right? Well, WRONG, whenever you plug ear buds in or attend a gig you have a chance of damaging your ears. When Sam did her 10 minutes at BBN - BB Networking, I was stunned by how easily you can damage your ears and what this means in the long term. So, all that \"not wanting to acknowledge\" the issues I had was for nothing and I spoke with Sam. She was brilliant. All those traits I have mentioned were there to help me get over myself and I now have a solution in place and wear hearing aids. This has helped me so much to cope with the tinnitus. If any of my contacts are reading this and are in business, I would advise you to get in Sam to check the hearing of your staff/team. She is the epitome of professional and fully explains EVERYTHING with regards to how you can improve yourself if your hearing is better. This isn't just for \"old people\" as you may think. How many of you wear \"buds\" or headphones for a period of time, such as exercising? Speak to Sam and she can advise you on what to do to preserve your hearing. Thank you Sam, for what you have done to help me and Community Driving School CIC #business #hearing #community\n\nThank you both so much for your support doesn't seem to be enough to be honest. Alex & Suzanne have sacrificed so much on behalf of Community Driving School CIC that I cannot seem to say thank you properly. So, here goes... Alex, last year you stepped into a Boxing Ring to raise funds for us and all the training that took to achieve your win. Just WOW.. On top of the \"day-job\" which is running and managing Va Va Voom Video.. You have a HUGE HEART and I cannot thank you enough for being part of this \"thing\". You are brave and \"dedicated\" is your middle name. Nothing seems to phase you and still you manage to produce some of the finest video content I have seen. You body of work speaks for itself and I advise anyone wanting to promote their business through your creativity then they MUST speak with you. Suzanne, we first met in 2017 when this \"thing\" was just a germ of an idea and that day I believe we were meant to speak about things. You have been at the very heart of CDS for several years now and it won't be the same without you. But I know that you are around and we can still talk about CDS and how life brings people together for a reason. You are a brave woman who can hold her head up high, look life in the eye and say \"Bring it on\" because you are strong enough to cope with whatever is thrown at you. Thank you for being you. #video #event #thankyou\n\nI really want to say a HUGE thank you to Adam Smith of Secure Tech Systems for talking up a HUGE challenge on behalf of Community Driving School CIC. He and his friend Jamie are walking 60kms across the Jubilee Greenway in London. They will be doing this in a single day on Saturday 7th September and I'd like to ask ALL of my contacts to make a donation towards this monumental effort. Even if it is just a £1, it makes a difference to what we do. People making such a HUGE effort deserve some support and I am asking EVERYONE one of my contacts to make a donation. If every single one of you donated £1, we would have £11k. That is HUGE for us and will achieve so much. So, please share this around and if you do, make a donation for their efforts at the very least. #donation #sponsored #walking https://lnkd.in/ear-QmTX\n\nWhen I am struggling, I find great comfort in looking back at what Community Driving School CIC means to people who have benefitted from being part of our program. The message below is from a pupil who lost her younger 16 year old sister to suicide. She often reads my social media posts and checks in to make sure I am okay. She can read between the lines as she has been there. Being part of the CDS family is something I care deeply about and NEVER want to change that feeling and way of looking at things. If we all just did that something to check on someone, how many lives can we save? Just to clarify the message though, David is a full time carer for his older brother and passed his test at the second attempt with us. Our sponsors and EVERYONE involved transformed his life for the better. The phoenix represents ALL of us who have been through troubled times but have \"Risen Again\" to be the person we are meant to be and more. I am proud to say I have \"Risen Again\" from the ashes of my suicide attempt and no matter how bad things get, I will NEVER go back there. Thanks to people in the CDS family, I have the support and encouragement to overcome so much. So, I urge anyone reading this to speak with someone who isn't quite feeling themselves and ask them TWICE how they are feeling. Tell them its okay to not feel okay. Things may seem bad right now, but it will get better - it just seems to take a long time and the world is a better place with you in it. Ring Samaritans on their behalf Call 116 123 and tell them someone you care about isn't feeling well and you want to help them. If even 1 life is saved, YOU have made the difference. #mentalhealth #suicide #StrongerTogether"
