        "text": "Nicole\n\nEvidence suggests* that Isaac II was the younger of the two Isaac Nicholsons in 1830 Monroe Co. Tenn.The other Nicholson heads of household appear to be Isaac II's younger brothers and Isaac I's sons except for the younger of two William Nicholsons who is dwelling beside the Sr Isaac Nicholson.I see him as probably being your William Nicholson and the son of Isaac II.We can't prove all this.\n\nIsaac I, who the 1830 Monroe census indicates was born in the 1750's, could possibly be a brother, or cousin, of John (1763) as well as William and Benjamin Nicholson who resided in Pendleton District S.C. circa 1800.That can't be proved, but there are reasons to suspect it other than the common name.\n\nI believe Isaac I died in the 1830's.I'll see if I have a firmer date on this.I've also seen it alleged that he married a Lucretia Dover.Again, I haven't looked at this stuff in years and may be forgetting something.Just looked in a file and see this info, which I believe was passed to me either from you or from Darlene Tracy and dug up by the late Jackie McClenahan:\"Isaac d: c1836 Monroe Co TN, Benj. Holcomb Exec., and Lucretia Dover Ncholson.\"There was however a Lucretia Nicholson, widow of James Nicholson who died in Monroe in 1833.James would have probably been Isaac I's son.so, there is a possibility the Lucretia Dover mentioned was a daughter in law, rather than his wife.\n\n*Isaac Nicholson III wrote that he was born in Monroe Co. Tn and that his grandfather, Isaac was a Rev War soldier from S.C.We know that Isaac III was born about 1831? and he was the son of Isaac II.So, the assumption that the two Isaacs in Monroe Co. in 1830 were father and son, Isaac 1 and II seems pretty sound.Isaac III also states his mother's maiden name was Penry.He further names his other grandfather as Henry Penry and give his burial place as the place Isaac II (his father) moved to in 1835, \"just\n\nbelow Chain ferry on what is now Geo. McClary's farm\".Isaac III states his father moved to Georgian in 1838 and sure enough he is on the 1840 Union Co. Ga. census.This leads me to believe that Henry Penry died between 1835 and 1838.Isaac II stated \"Father sold out his claim in 1838 to David L. Knox and moved to Georgia.\"\n\nJohn (1763) Nicholson's parents are unknown, despite people that continue to post that John was the son of a William Nicholson.When queried they never have proof, or even any details on said William.I think this came from one source and everyone copied it.\n\nThere is a DAR monument in North Georgia that proclaims John (1763) Nicholson's wife was a Nancy Freeman.This was apparently based on faulty research done by a woman who was admitted to membership based on ancestry from John N.The researcher was unaware that John was already married with children and living in a different state at the time a different John Nicholson married Ms Freeman.Rather than correct an error, DAR researcher(s) gave him two extra wive's (one to account for the children and another to account for his later being proved married to his one, and only, wife Susan Brown) and erected the monument.They even ignored testimony by his grandchildren who stated the only grandmother they knew was Susan Brown Nicholson. :)"
