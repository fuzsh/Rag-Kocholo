According to one story, he and his mother survived the massacre of the rest of their family because a servant hid them in a pile of brushwood. William grew up in Whitehaven, Cumberland. During this time he converted to Quakerism and was known henceforth as 'William the Quaker'. When of age, he returned to Ireland and rebuilt the house at Cranagill. William married Isabel Gilbert (c.1637-1716) and had five sons. In 1688 the advancing Jacobite forces burnt Tallbridge House and the Nicholson family fled to Londonderry for sanctuary. Two of William's sons died during the siege.[1][2][3]\n\nIt is not known exactly when William Nicholson returned to Ireland. His first (isolated) entry in the Quaker records is for the year 1662, when he was recorded as 'of Tortorian' county Armagh. (Tartaraghan is a small settlement on the south bank of Lough Neagh a few miles to the north of the family's estate at Cranagill.) On this occasion, he was fined 10s for attendance at a Quaker meeting and had a mare worth £1 15s taken from him to pay it. [4]\n\nBy 1664, he was back at Cranagill, where he featured in the hearth money (property tax) rolls. [5]\n\nIn 1672, he was party to two deeds designed to confirm his ownership of lands previously owned by his father and grandfather which had been lost by them in the rebellion of 1641. The first of these describes William Nicholson, Gent, son and heir of John Nicholson, late of Cranagill, in ye B of O’Neal, co Armagh, Gent, and confirms an indenture dated 12 December 1631, made between Andrew Stewart of Castle Stewart, Dungannon, co Tyrone, Knt, & Bart, & the said John Nicholson, whereby, for the sum of 325£, sir Andrew sold & confirmed to the said John Nicholson in fee farm the townland of Brackaville and 2/3 of the townland of Derry in County Tyrone. [6]\n\nThe second deed, dated August 1672, confirmed his ownership of half the townland of Cranagill, comprising 120 statute acres, more or less which had been granted in fee to his father (whose name is not mentioned) before the rebellion when it had been lost. William was described as yeoman in this deed and paid William Waldron Esq. £12 for the benefit of it. [7]\n\nWilliam Waldron may have died, or not have had the right to confirm the ownership of the land, because in another indenture dated 1 July 1676, William Nicholson paid £10 to George Waldron to confirm his ownership of the same half of Cranagill, still comprising 120 statute acres, more or less. This deed describes William Nicholson as of Tallbridge, yeoman but says that the land had originally been conveyed by one Henry Pilkington to William's grandfather, named as William Nicholson. [8]\n\nWilliam Nicholson died at his house at Tallbridge on 24 Mar 1715/6.[9] The Quakers left a short testimony to his life\n\nWilliam Nicholson departed this life at his dwelling house at Tall Bridge the 24th of the 1st month 1715 about the 11th hour at night being about 83 years he lived and dyed in unity and his friendshipp with his brethren who do and will find that he will be missed in the meeting he belongs unto being a generous minded man for the ? also very charitable unto any that was in want or distress being a ? kind man in conversation and of good repute which causes a good ? to be left behind him much might be said to his praise if set out unto the full but its our comforts thats left behind that we have cause [to] believe he is at rest and redeemed out of this troublesome world. [10]\n\nWill and Estate\n\nWilliam Nicholson made his will on 10 January 1714/5. He described himself as being “stricken in years and growing weak in Body but of sound and disposing mind.” He left his freehold in Cranagill, Tullyrone, and Drumanon to his son Jacob Nicholson. He left twenty pounds to his granddaughter Sarah McNesce who was under twenty-one. He left ten pounds to William Nicholson, eldest son of his son John Nicholson, deceased, and ten pounds to John Nicholson, son of John Nicholson, deceased, and ten pounds to Elizabeth Nicholson, daughter of John Nicholson, deceased. He also left twenty pounds to their mother Margery Nicholson, widow, to be divided among the other children of John Nicholson, deceased. He left fifty pounds to his son in law William Brownlow and his wife Elizabeth to be paid to “such of their children as they think fit.” He left fifty pounds to his son in law George Fox and his wife Jane for their children. He left fifty pounds to his son in law Robert Hodgson and his wife Sarah for the use of their children. He left his son Abraham Nicholson his freehold in Tullyrome. He left the remainder of his estate to his wife Isabel. He left twenty pounds to the Meeting in Ballyhagan in trust of William Richardson and William Gray. He named his wife Isabel Nicholson and son in law Robert Hodgson as his executors with William Richardson and William Gray as overseers. His will was witnessed by John Nixon, John Deale, John Sturges, Joseph Williamson, Samuel Gray, Mary Gray, and Isabel Gray. [11] (See: The Will of William Nicholson of Cranagill, 1714/5)\n\nThe Quakers made an inventory of his financial assets and liabilites dated 14 November 1716 which included debtors totalling £20/10/8 and creditors of £100/10/? (figure of pence not clear). The inventory ends by stating that these debts and the legacies left in his will were to be paid out of the (income from) his freehold lying in Cranagill. [12]\n\nResearch Notes\n\nNo birth or marriage record located.\n\nThere are numerous versions of the history of the Nicholson family, but, as Eric McElroy explains in his journal article no two accounts seem to agree. [1] He might have added that no account cites any sources for its claims. The evidence cited above and in the profile of William's father clearly links the Quaker William Nicholson of Tallbridge to a father John who died in the rebellion and a grandfather William and shows that the family owned lands of Crangill, co Armagh and two townlands in Tyrone which were lost during the rebellion. Although the evidence shows the death of John Nicholson in 1641, there is no similar objective evidence for the death of grandfather William. Rev William Nicholson was certainly granted lands in Derrevrochish and Killeman in 1628, and the statement that the Rev William was the grandfather of William the Quaker is consistent with the deed cited above in which William Nicholson described his grandfather as William. However none of the lands claimed by William junior is the same as those granted to the Rev William. It may well be that the grant of land to the Rev William was in his capacity as Rector, and could therefore not be passed on to his descendants.\n\nThere is also no objective evidence to support the claim that William Nicholson's mother took him to Cumberland, although it is certainly not unlikely. Nor has any objective evidence been found for the statement that the Nicholsons retreated to Derry or that some of William's children died there. Indeed, the expert on the Williamite war, JG Simms, writes that the protestant population of South Ulster fled to the fortified town of Enniskillen, rather that to Derry, which would have required crossing or travelling around Lough Neagh.
