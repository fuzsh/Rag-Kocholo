        "text": "Well, hello there. Congrats on the little cutie you’ll be welcoming a few months from now! (If you’re not a parent-to-be and you’re simply here to add baby names to your Notes tab, that’s cool too.)\n\nRegardless of whether or not you’re expecting, the reason you clicked on this article about nonbasic middle names for your baby boy is probably because…you’re searching for unique middle names for a baby boy. Noted.\n\nThe good news: There are so many middle names you can choose for him that aren’t James, John, or William. The bad news: Figuring out which one to use will literally keep you up at night.\n\nBut between the nursery, diapers, and breastfeeding questions you’re probably definitely already consumed with, the last thing you want to worry about is a cool middle name. Especially when that should be one of the fun parts!\n\nTo help, we’ve curated a list of the best baby boy middle names that you’re going to be obsessed with. We promise there’s something here that will make the perfect initials for your kid to use. (But in the event that you haven’t picked out the first name yet, probs best to start there because that’s kind of important too. Right this way for some unisex first name options….)\n\n1. Aiden\n\nAiden sounds like a surfer dude from Laguna Beach or The O.C., and I’m not mad about it.\n\n2. Alexander\n\nUmm…hello, regal king.\n\n3. Andrew\n\nOkay, FINE, it’s not the most uncommon name you’ll ever hear—but it will pair nicely with just about any first name you can think of.\n\n4. Bailey\n\nGender-neutral names are some of the most interesting names you’ll find, and you won’t change my mind.\n\n5. Bennet\n\nAs long as his first name isn’t Ben, this is a great choice. Unless you want a son named Ben Bennet?\n\n6. Brian\n\nSo many people go with this as a first name. Why not change things up by making it his middle instead?\n\n7. Bryant\n\nBy adding a simple “t” to the end, you’ll completely transform the name Bryan.\n\n8. Carson\n\nTake a page from everyone’s favorite former TRL host. And if you didn’t know that I was talking about Carson Daly, thanks for making me feel incredibly old.\n\n9. Chase\n\nIf you want him to be a complete badass, this is the name. Now all he needs is a baby leather jacket.\n\n10. Christopher\n\nThis religious name is of Greek origin and means “bearer of Christ.” Amen!\n\n11. Daniel\n\n“Dammmnnn, Daniel!” will forever be a timeless meme (IYKYK), just like this timeless name.\n\n12. David\n\nIf you have any luck, your baby boy will grow up with a brow game as strong as Schitt’s Creek character David Rose’s.\n\n13. Dean\n\nGreat for fans of James Dean AND Jensen Ackles’s Supernatural character.\n\n14. Elio\n\nIt’s not just the best frozen pizza brand (minus one “l”)—it also makes for a stellar middle name.\n\n15. Emerson\n\nA powerful name for a baby, as it literally means “brave” and “powerful.”\n\n16. Eric\n\nEric is by far the best Disney prince, in my opinion.\n\n17. Flynn\n\nYou can’t beat one-syllable choices like Flynn, especially as a middle name.\n\n18. Frederick\n\nIf you want, you can even call him Freddy as a nickname. Aw!\n\n19. Garrett\n\nWith a sporty name like Garrett, he just might be a jock.\n\n20. Grey\n\nGrey is easy to pronounce, unique, and totally mysterious-sounding in the best way.\n\n21. Henry\n\nDid you know Prince Harry’s real name is Henry?? As if you needed more proof that it’s an awesome name.\n\n22. Hendrix\n\nGoing with Hendrix practically guarantees he’ll be shredding Jimi’s solos by the time he’s old enough to hold a guitar.\n\n23. Hudson\n\nBeing named after the Hudson River—you’ll want to get him started with swimming lessons ASAP.\n\n24. Hunter\n\nA very country choice for your adorable little cowboy.\n\n25. Isaac\n\nThere aren’t too many “I” names out there, but Isaac has more than enough swag to make up for it.\n\n26. Jack\n\nJack Black, Jack Nicholson, 30 Rock’s Jack Donaghy…yep, your baby boy is in some good company.\n\n27. Jax\n\nHe might not have been the best role model on Vanderpump Rules, but you have to hand it to Jax Taylor—he’s got an undeniably cool name.\n\n28. Jeremy\n\nHe’ll be your little Jer-Bear forever.\n\n29. Judson\n\nIf you liked Hudson but had your heart set on a “J” middle name, why not have both?\n\n30. Kev\n\nChoose the right first name and this special take on Kevin will sound ultra hip.\n\n31. Killian\n\nThis Celtic choice translates to “little warrior” and “bright-headed.”\n\n32. Knox\n\nKnox, knox. Who’s there? A boy with an awesome middle name, that’s who.\n\n33. Lawrence\n\nCan you even imagine a baby nicknamed Larry? So cute!\n\n34. Leo\n\nAn especially fantastic option for all you astrology moms out there with babies born from July 23 to August 22.\n\n35. Levi\n\nThere’s a reason Levi’s is the most popular jean company—it has the best name, don’t @ me.\n\n36. Lincoln\n\nA future history major in the making?\n\n37. Lucas\n\nOr drop the “s” and make it Luca! Either way…10/10 choice.\n\n38. Maclean\n\nThis Gaelic name can be pronounced either Mac-leen or Mac-layn. Both are equally futuristic-sounding.\n\n39. Mitchell\n\nMitch, Mitchie, Mitchell…so many variations on this special one.\n\n40. Nash\n\nWhether you’re a Nashville native or just a fan of the city’s iconic music venues, this is a sweet choice for your future country superstar.\n\n41. Nicholas\n\nNicholas means “people of victory,” so get ready for plenty of exciting victories in your little one’s life.\n\n42. Noah\n\nThis popular name is of Hebrew origin and means “rest” or “repose.” Hopefully, that means your newborn will have no trouble sleeping through the night.\n\n43. Orson\n\nOrson, of Latin origin, means “bear cub.” Name a cuter baby name meaning than that…I’ll wait.\n\n44. Oliver\n\nInspire a future reader by giving him a name from the Charles Dickens classic.\n\n45. Peter\n\nPeter, a Greek name meaning “rock” or “stone,” is a rock-solid choice for your little dude. See what I did there?\n\n46. Penn\n\nIf your baby grows up to be as talented as Penn Badgley is, you’re in luck. Just make sure the similarities stop at Penn…and not his You character, Joe Goldberg.\n\n47. Peyton\n\nPeyton? Like quarterback Peyton Manning?? Yep, your boy is set to make NFL history.\n\n48. Quentin\n\nHaving any “Q” name is already super rare, but sharing one with director Quentin Tarantino is even rarer.\n\n49. Reid\n\nThis English name actually means “red-haired,” so if your son is born a redhead, you know which name to choose.\n\n50. Rhett\n\nIf you grew up in the golden age of YouTube, you’ll immediately think of ’00s duo Rhett and Link. Both are pretty impressive names, but Rhett definitely stands out.\n\n51. Richard\n\nRichard, which was a bit more popular years ago, is sure to give your son’s name a vintage feel.\n\n52. River\n\nThis could be an especially cute pick if your boy is a water sign!\n\n53. Samuel\n\nIf you want your kid to be as iconic as Pulp Fiction’s Samuel L. Jackson, you know what to do.\n\n54. Scott\n\nIf you have Scottish family members, this could be the nicest tribute to them—because the name quite literally means “from Scotland.”\n\n55. Sutton\n\nSimilarly, if you have Southern roots, Sutton means “from the Southern homestead.”\n\n56. Thomas\n\nIf your little engineer becomes hooked on trains because of Thomas the Tank Engine, just wait until he realizes he shares a name with him.\n\n57. Taylor\n\nStill not over the fact that Taylor Lautner married another Taylor and now they’re both Taylor Lautner. And before that, he dated Taylor Swift. Pick this name if you’re as big a “Taylor” stan as Taylor Lautner is.\n\n58. Timothy\n\nOr if you’re feeling fancy, you can spell it Timothée, à la Chalamet.\n\n59. Tobias\n\nSay what you will about Tobias Fünke, Arrested Development fans, but the guy had a pretty great name.\n\n60. Vincent\n\nVincent is Latin for “conquering,” which is what he’ll be doing in life for years to come with a name like that.\n\n61. Wesley\n\nWesley means “western meadow,” which is just about as peaceful of a name as it gets.\n\n62. Zayn\n\nIf you were once a Directioner (and your fave of the group was Zayn), I get it…because same."
