The twenty-four letters of the Greek alphabet introduce twenty-four stories of transformation and metamorphosis from Greek and Roman history and mythology. Each story is illustrated with one or more object from across the collections of the University of Sydney held in the Nicholson Museum, the Macleay Museum and the University Art Gallery. In 2018, these same three collections will themselves be transformed into the new Chau Chak Wing Museum. This final Nicholson Museum exhibition represents the beginning and the end, the alpha and omega of what has been and what will be."
