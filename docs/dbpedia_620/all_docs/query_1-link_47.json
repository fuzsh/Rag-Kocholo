        "text": "Hi everyone, this is a strange one.\n\nJOHN GILCHRIST born Hull Yorkshire 1885.......1891 is described as grandson of John GILCHRIST (my great grandfather) and mary Ann nee Young.......\n\n\"Grandson\" being presumably the child of a child of John and Mary....there is no sign of the birth of Henry, thus no parents.\n\nThe obvious conclusion being that Henry was the illegitimate son of a daughter (or son) of John....only two qualify by age..MARY E and ARTHUR...\n\n1901 henry is in the liverpool Sheltering home for destitute children..then he disappears.....\n\nHave googled \"Liverpool Sheltering Home\" and it seems that hundreds of these unfortunate children were sent to Canada to work on farms etc....(which process could open up a whole can of worms!!)\n\nAll i need, kind folks is someone (Sylvia where are you??lol)..to look at Canada passenger lists from Liverpool between 1901 and 1911..to see if was sent to Canada.\n\nPlease don't send me reams of \"For information\" of copy and pasted census returns..I have them all..\n\nMany thanks in anticipation.\n\nDerek.\n\nDerek - the reams of census info is not usually for your benefit. It's background for us to work from.\n\nWill go and check shipping lists.....\n\nEDIT: On second thoughts, was there an upper age limit on Home Children being sent away?\n\nCould you also clarify if he is John or Henry? - you use both in your opening post.\n\nEDIT 2: Have looked at that 1891 census (and resisted the urge to post it!) it appears we're meant to be looking for HENRY Gilchrist - that is the name of John's grandson.\n\nHi Shirley..many thanks for that.what a great Archive..but he does not appear to be on it..but i've found another relative who is!!\n\nMarie.I take your point..but haven't you received such lists, often totally unrelated to the enquiry...but if we're still friends lol..please look. Thank you.\n\nDerek.\n\nDerek - of course we're friends!! I do know what you mean, but you must know what I mean too when we're trying to get the bigger picture. :-)\n\nAnyhow, now I know what the right name is I'll go and take another look!!\n\nWow...Marie and Potty..that is brilliant..Knowlton Quebec was the place they were sent to before being \"farmed out\" literally.....The Website that Shirley gave me a link to is very revealing..about motives etc!!..not nice...\n\nYou can send me reams of anything you like marie!!\n\ndon't suppose you've got the marriage to Ethel..??? I ma aware of the Canadian 100 year embargo........\n\nBut many many thanks for all your help.\n\nDerek.\n\nSome prompts which come up.\n\nHenry Nicholson Gilchrist\n\nBirth: Jul 1884 - Sculcoates, Yorkshire - East Riding\n\n=================================\n\nOntario, Canada, Deaths, 1869-1938 and Deaths Overseas, 1939-1947\n\nabout Henry Nicholson Gilchrist Name: Henry Nicholson Gilchrist\n\nDeath Date: 31 Dec 1935\n\nDeath County or District: York\n\nAge: 52\n\nGender: Male\n\nEstimated Birth Year: abt 1883\n\nBirth Location: England\n\nFather: Henry Gilchrist\n\nMother: Sarah Jane Solson\n\n===============================\n\nOntario, Canada Marriages, 1801-1928\n\nabout Henry Nicholson Nicholson Gilchrist Name: Henry Nicholson Nicholson Gilchrist\n\nBirth Place: Hull Eng <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\n\nAge: 31\n\nEstimated Birth Year: abt 1885\n\nFather Name: Henry Gilchrist\n\nMother Name: Sarah J Nicholson Gilchrist\n\nSpouse Name: Sarah Luella Cutway\n\nSpouse's Age: 24\n\nSpouse Birth Place: Trosktown\n\nSpouse Father Name: Amos Cutway\n\nSpouse Mother Name: Annie May Wiley Cutway\n\nMarriage Date: 7 Jun 1916\n\nMarriage County or District: Leeds\n\n==============================\n\nmarriage 1884 Jun qtr\n\nTolson Sarah Jane Sculcoates 9d 242\n\nGilchrist Henry Sculcoates 9d 242\n\n==============================\n\n1881 Same family as 1891 in your first post.\n\nHenry Gilchrist John,\n\nMary A. abt 1863 Hull, Yorkshire, England Son Drypool, Yorkshire\n\n===================\n\nHowever young Henry is also with his parents in 1891 but not 1901.\n\nSo is it two Henry's or was he on the 1891 twice?\n\nHell Thelma..........many thanks for your help....Henry son of John and Mary..did indeed marry Sarah Jane Tolson..but there son henry was only one year old in 1891..I haven't got him on my tree becasue it was Emily who was born in 1885...and she is still with mum and dad on the 1911..unmarried..in leeds......\n\nSo henry son of henry didn't go to Canada..and henry senior was a well to do man with servants...so why abandon a child???\n\nAnother complication is that the nicholsons are in my family....but married to herny seniors sister mary E........so my rvised thinking might be that Henry 1885 who was \"deported to Canada MIGHT have been an illegitimate child of Mary's before she married John Nicholson?\n\nBut why would he be with his grandparents in 1901..and then slung off into a home by 1911.....\n\nthe Canada information is great.....but why include both Tolson and nicholsons?? very confusing......but what grreat fun!! thank you again.\n\nDerek.\n\nThe one with grandparents says born 1885 and the one with Henry and Sarah J 1890.\n\n1911 Henry and Sarah Jane had 8 children 5 died.\n\nwith them in leeds are Mary Hannah 1885 and Emily 1889.\n\nWas Sarah Jane Tolson or Nicholson.\n\nWas Tolson written instead of Nicholson.\n\nI can find a Sarah Jane Nicholson but not Tolson.\n\nDo you have her parents?\n\nLike you say why would Henry have been sent away.\n\nMaryb.\n\nMary !! you have become..with the greatest love and respect !!..a pain in the neck!!.You have led me down another avenue..and your suspeicions are brilliant!!\n\nHenry Gilchrist DID marry Sarah j Tolson rd quarter 1884\n\nMartha ( not mary) married John W Nicholson 4th quarter 1890....(Henry born 1891)...........all of which i knew...\n\nWhat I DIDN'T know was that SARAH J TOLSON born 1867..who married Henry in 1884..was on the 1881 Census what looks like the Grand daughter of one henry and hannah NICHOLSON!!!\n\nIt's become very complicated and explains the canadian records...Oh Joy!!\n\nSo if Henry 1885..was the son of henry and sarah married 1884....what happened???\n\nI love it!!\n\nThanks again\n\nEDIT..Sarah J Tolsons parents were Mark Tolson from Darlington and Elizabeth from Hull...........I bet she was a Nicholson!!\n\nThelma...or anybody..care to take a look on the 1881 for Sarah J Tolson 1867 Hull.......and see if you can read the relationship to the Nicholson's???? could it be \"adopted daughter\"?\n\nStrange to say..her siblings in 1881 are living with an Aunt called Sherwood.......parents Mark and Elizabeth have diappeared!!..and \\mark's wife Elizabeth was NOT a Nicholson....\n\nPhew!!!\n\nDear mary!!...not wlld goose chase.i was congratulating you..and thanking you.abd putting me on the right track .it now appears that all the Tolson/Nicholson from canada is entirely accurate in that Srah j Tolson was aopted by the Nicholsons.........which bespeaks another sadness..in the break up of the Tolson \\family...by 1881..because of the deaths of both parents!!...........looks like you wonderful lot have soved the problem....\n\nAny help i can return on my derbyshire thrread..pop in for a cup of something!!\n\nDerek."
