        "text": "There are two conversational gambits that I dread. The first is: 'What does your husband do?' The other is: 'How many children do you have?' Once a woman interrogated me at a dinner party. Despite - or because of - my evasive responses, she decided that my husband must have abandoned me. I, slightly drunk, snapped back that he was dead. The truth is, she didn't know the half of it. Ten years ago my husband, the Observer journalist John Merritt, died of leukaemia. And then, six years later, in an incredibly cruel twist of fate, our eldest daughter, Ellie, died - also of leukaemia. If I tell people this, they are usually tongue-tied or horrified. Sometimes complete strangers start crying, which I hate.\n\nSo, without denying John and Ellie's existence, I try not to talk about them with people I don't know very well. Leukaemia isn't hereditary. My family's experience is unique, as far as I know. Since Ellie's diagnosis and death, new lines of research have opened up but no one really knows exactly why both father and child were affected. Or what the implications are for other family members, especially Hope, my surviving daughter, who at nine is the age her sister was when she died. The uncertainty is just something we have to live with. Along with the grief.\n\nMy side of the family is extraordinarily long-lived. I was well into adulthood before I experienced even the death of a grandparent. If I had had any way of knowing what was in store for me, I would not have thought it possible to endure. The morning after John's death, I remember feeling absolutely enraged that the world had kept turning and the sun had come up as if nothing had happened.\n\nBut the world does keep turning and, while the pain never goes away, eventually you find ways of incorporating it into who you are. It is a process that takes years, unlike in the movies where it is telescoped into a few months. If they were more realistic, films such as Sleepless in Seattle would make pretty tedious viewing. But when you look back, you see that it really is a mappable process of forcing your psyche to face up to what has happened\n\nThe various stages along the way are pretty well documented, but what is less often appreciated is that you don't progress through them in an orderly manner. Rather you are whipsawed through tidal waves of emotion and it is only with hindsight that you can say what was the predominant theme at any given time.\n\nAt first, of course, all you can register is shock - however predictable the death might have been. It is a physical reaction with very physical side-effects. I remember being put in a side room at Great Ormond Street hospital just after Ellie died and being overwhelmed by what felt like a sleeping sickness. When the doctors came in to talk me through what had happened, I remember feeling embarrassed because I was so tired I could barely keep my eyes open. The physical symptoms went on for at least a year, making me nauseous most days, with stomach cramps and a pounding headache. My job involves a lot of entertaining and there was a point in that year when I felt I must have thrown up in every smart restaurant in London.\n\nDenial kicks in pretty early on, too, which is lucky as you have to organise the funeral. Or maybe funerals were invented to give you something to do while you flounder around in denial? Whichever, to me it was the most curious, lightheaded feeling where you know intellectually that the person you love most in the world has gone, but you can't really think about it right now because you have a great big party to organise.\n\nFor most of the mourners, the funeral represents closure, and it is pretty hard to stay in denial when confronted by all the ritual and symbolism. But if you are burying your husband or child, the extent to which your brain protects you from understanding what is going on, is in itself quite frightening. A dry-eyed widow or mother in the front row of the church is not being brave; nor is she being unfeeling - she just has no idea where she is. I know, I've been both.\n\nEventually, though, reality does start creeping in through the chinks in your armour, bringing with it dreadful nightmares - which I still get - and horrible flashes of despair when I feel as if I'm teetering on the edge of an abyss. They stir up an intense and furious rage against fate for causing so much pain. But, of course, you are still all scrambled up with the denial. So since it's unthinkable that you could be angry with your dead husband or child, you lash out in other ways.\n\nIf you can control it, you can use the terrific waves of energy that the anger unleashes in a constructive way. Campaigning for more bone-marrow donors to sign up with the Anthony Nolan Register gave me a focus for a while. But at some point you will still find yourself taking it out on some innocent bystander, almost certainly someone who had been helping you to cope. Which is how I ended up falling out with my utterly stalwart best friend at the point in my life when I needed her more than ever. And being able to recite this theory off-pat makes not a shred of difference. This is where you go quite literally mad with grief. It sounds grim - and it is.\n\nGrieving people are a pain to be around and, much as I hated being me, I can see now that it was very hard trying to be a friend to me. Forget the stereotype: the bereaved do not, in my experience, recline decorously on a sofa dabbing at their eyes with a lace-trimmed hankie. I remember a friend saying, wearily: \"Your grief is very active, isn't it?\" Some friends manage to hang on in there and become all the dearer and closer as a result. But others - and who can blame them - bale out. And even if you don't destroy all your friendships in your rages, there are those who just find the whole thing so unbearable that they cannot think of anything to say and start avoiding you out of embarrassment. Or perhaps they think that tragedy is catching and avoid you for fear of having their happy lives contaminated. All in all, at a rough estimate, I guess I have lost a third of my Christmas-card list over the years.\n\nEventually, the shock and anger and denial do abate and everyone thinks you are \"getting over it\" and \"putting your life back together\", but the truth is that the worst bit hasn't even started yet. As you gradually realise that the person you loved is never, ever coming back, you descend into a solid, grinding pit of depression. Crawling out of it takes years and years. I am still in it - although I think I can see daylight now and again.\n\nProfessional grief counsellors estimate that for what they call a normal bereavement - the death of an elderly parent, say, from natural causes - the process of shock, denial, anger and depression through to the final state known as acceptance takes about four years. What are known as complicated bereavements, such as I went through, are supposed to take a minimum of seven years - often longer, as it is easy to get stuck in the depression stage. Some never get out.\n\nThis is why I rage against simplistic statements such as time being a great healer, which it isn't. Or that you should rely on friends or family to pull you through. Even if you haven't already fallen out with them, there is no way that they could imagine what you were going through. In a society such as ours in which people live so long, very few young or even middle-aged people have firsthand experience of such intense loss.\n\nIn their misunderstanding, many people tend to focus on the anniversaries as milestones in the grieving process. Anniversaries are certainly important but only because they have to be got through somehow. Even if you choose not to mark them, they are inescapable. John died in August during the long, hot dog-days of summer when everyone is on holiday and the garden is baked by the heat. I couldn't avoid the countdown even if I never looked at a calendar. On the day itself, I am haunted by flashbacks... This is the time I was driving to the hospital... This is when I realised it might be more serious than the other scares we had lived through... This is when I guessed it was all over... This is when they told me it was all over...\n\nI repeat to myself like a mantra that the day of an anniversary can only be 24 hours like any other. But it always seems much, much longer.\n\nNor is there any sense of achievement at having survived another year. Only profound guilt that I have had a year of life that my husband and child never knew.\n\nThe second year of mourning is almost always worse than the first because reality is setting in and the passage of time is taking you further and further away from your memories. The sound of their voice, the smell of their hair or the touch of their skin becomes harder to conjure up.\n\nA friend who lost a daughter once asked me whether the anniversaries got any better. She had, she told me, been so distressed at work that she bawled out an important client who then took his business elsewhere. I had to tell her that they won't ever get better for her but that they will for the people around her.\n\nAfter you have racked up a few dreadful anniversaries, you realise that you have to plan out your day very carefully. And you have to do it at least six weeks beforehand because as the actual date approaches, you feel as if you are moving through glue and can't organise anything. Now, on Ellie's anniversary, I go to the ballet, which she loved, and try to be on holiday for John's. In Ireland, preferably, where their greater acceptance of death means I don't feel like such a freak for being so careless as to lose not only a husband but a child as well.\n\nI go to the graves - John and Ellie are buried side by side - a day or two before rather than on the anniversaries, ever since a former colleague remarked sniffily that she was surprised not to see any fresh flowers when she had visited. I had brought them, of course, but arrived later than her. As chief mourner, you are appointed keeper of the flame and other people feel badly if you don't behave in a way they think is fitting, however rough you may be feeling.\n\nAnd still, through everything, life goes on. You have to get out from under the duvet, make breakfast and go and earn a living. I had no choice about whether or not to work after John died: I had a three-year-old to support and was pregnant with our second. But to my utter surprise, and in the midst of all the turmoil, I found that work can be a great blessing, a balm for the soul even. It is absorbing, constant and full of people who, in the day-to-day pressures of getting a magazine to press, more or less forgot after my first morning back what I had been through.\n\nDespite, or because of, the circumstances, my career took off after John's death. The year after Ellie's death, I won the top award in my industry - editor of the year - for my work on Prima magazine and was headhunted to be editor-in-chief of the hugely prestigious Good Housekeeping. This disconnection between public success and private torment, I realise, makes people suspicious and wary of me. They think that they could never cope in that way and presume that I must be an exceptionally cold-hearted careerist to have done so. But I don't think that they really consider what the options are. Even my own mother can't understand why I don't stay at home and just care for Hope; maybe write a little to pay the bills. But the truth is that throwing myself into my work is what has saved me. And, conversely, thinking that Hope could save me would have been a very mean trick to play on a child.\n\nThe name Hope was chosen jointly by John and me, although she was born five months after her father died. And while the many consequences of being a posthumous child are, for her, still to come, she doesn't grieve for him in the way someone who had known their father would. She was five when she lost her sister and took it very hard indeed. Despite all the platitudes you hear about children being \"very accepting\" or \"getting over things more quickly than adults\" - they don't. Children grieve in exactly the same way, and over the same timescale, as adults, but without the language to express it. And sod's law has it that they never coincide with where you are in the grieving process. When one of you is having a rare moment of accepting the situation, the other is usually slap-bang in the middle of denial.\n\nThe first two years after Ellie's death were pretty hellish. Hope was very clingy and slept every night in my bed, which was fine by me as we clung together for comfort. She was so scared of losing anybody else that when her godmother came to visit from Italy, she used dressing-gown cords to tie her to the furniture and prevent her from leaving. Yet she has thrived at school - her version of throwing herself into work, I suppose - and is an extremely outgoing and confident child. A real chatterbox, she talks matter-of-factly about her sister and her father, with little thought of the impact it will have on the listener. One day at school she approached another little girl and asked her why she was crying. \"I miss my daddy,\" the child sobbed. \"Well, my daddy's dead and I'm not crying,\" said Hope. Cue tears from the whole class.\n\nI don't have any special game plan for helping her cope, except to keep talking. When she was younger, she questioned me daily about death, why people die and where they go afterwards. And I, thank God (as it were) for religion. I am a Catholic and although I'm not really sure how much comfort my faith has brought me, I really don't understand how anyone without a framework of belief (any belief, it doesn't matter what) could cope with the constant interrogation from a grieving child. You simply couldn't keep it up if you were having to reassess your own views each time you answered a question.\n\nThen there is all the other stuff that goes with being a single parent. I always cry after parent-teacher evenings because I have no one to discuss Hope's progress with. And the rare occasions when I fall ill are very scary for us both. But the relentless hard work and ruthless organisation that being a single parent entails is really all I have ever known. John became ill quite soon after Ellie was born so my memories of shared parenting are mainly about fitting in around blood transfusions and chemotherapy. I don't have a very good comparison with how much easier life might be if I were not on my own.\n\nWhich is not to say I like it. I was 36 when John died and, much as I loved him, I didn't, even then, expect to remain on my own. But 10 years on, I'm starting to wonder. Widowers seem to attract nice, caring women who want to look after them. I know one who has remarried within three months and is having a new baby in less than a year. I'm glad for him that he is not alone but I think it is tough on his existing kids, and on his new wife who is going to have a new baby to cope with and the rest of his grieving process to get through.\n\nWidows don't seem to inspire the same caring instinct in men. Or I don't anyway. Perversely, some men seem to think that since I have endured so much pain, a little more on top won't hurt. A man I was having a relationship with told me, three weeks after Ellie's death, that he had been seeing someone else. Maybe the reality is too intimidating.\n\nI have to shoulder my share of the blame, too, as I am still wrestling with my idea that finding someone new to love means having someone new to lose. Self-limiting and destructive as I know commitment phobia to be, it's still a fairly reasonable reaction, I think, to everything I've been through.\n\nSo now, along with the actual losses of John and Ellie, I also have the virtual losses of the companionship I have missed out on over the past decade and the other children I would have loved to have had but now never will. It's quite a lonely and depressing picture. But it is not the full picture. Since the past is so full of horror and the future so filled with uncertainty, I have no choice but to live very much in the present, taking life day by day. Psychologically, this is supposed to be extremely healthy, although very hard to achieve unless you are absolutely forced into it.\n\nI am lucky to have a circle of loving and loyal friends, plus a job that gives me endless opportunities to socialise. I travel a lot on business and take several holidays a year. I work out at the gym, ride horses, go to the theatre and the opera, and out to dinner.\n\nIf I usually wear black, that's because Mr Armani makes most of his clothes in that colour. And if you were to meet me, I probably wouldn't be dashing away a silent tear. In fact, you would be more likely to notice my laugh, which is frequent but, unfortunately, I'm told, earsplitting.\n\nIt sounds terribly cliched but I do now take much more pleasure in the small day-to-day joys of life. In some respects, I think I am actually happier than people who have never suffered anything and live in fear of what might happen rather than enjoying the here and now. The girl I see in my old wedding photos, who has no idea what lies ahead of her, seems like a a stranger to me. This is who I am now.\n\nI have bad days as well as good days, and on bad days I try to remind myself that in the whole history of humanity, and still in many parts of the developing world, my experiences would be typical rather than exceptional. What I have been through - although dreadful - is really just part of what it is to be human. Hope is reading this over my shoulder as I write. She says it needs a good title. I ask her to suggest one. \"How about Life After Death,\" she says. \"Because they've died but we've got to go on living.\""
