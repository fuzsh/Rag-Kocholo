He was educated at Lime House School, Wetheral, Carlisle and entered the third form of George Watson's College in May 1933 where he was in Cockburn House until 1937. He gained a bursary in 1935 and was a member of the 3rd Rugby XI. He went on to Edinburgh University where he had completed two years of a B. Sc degree in Agriculture when he left to enlist in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. He was commissioned as a Pilot Officer on the 30th of December 1940.\n\nOn the 16th of February 1941, David Caird and Sergeant Aubrey Jessie Burley took off from RAF Sutton Bridge in Miles Master Mk 1 N8043 for an instrument training flight. At the time he had 100 hours of total solo flying time of which 5.50 hours were on the aircraft type. The weather was poor with visibility of 1 to 2 miles and 10/10th cloud down to 900 feet, although at the time of take off the cloud base was between 1,500 and 1,800 feet. There was no training hood in the aircraft and the two pilots were to put their heads inside the cockpit instead. During the exercise the aircraft was making a tight turn when it stalled and crashed near Hilgay Station near Downham Market, killing both men.\n\nHis father received the following telegram dated the 17th of February 1941: - \"Deeply regret to inform you that your son Pilot Officer David Francis Caird is reported to have lost his life as the result of an aircraft accident on Feb 16th/41. Letter follows. The Air Council express their profound sympathy.\"\n\nAn eyewitness later stated that the aircraft did a very tight vertical turn to the right at about 800 feet. It then flicked out of the turn on its back and was recovering when it hit the ground. The wreckage indicated that the aircraft struck the ground at an angle of 60 degrees to the vertical and not at a particularly high speed.\n\nHis funeral took place on the 20th of February 1941.\n\nHe is buried at St Matthew's Churchyard, Sutton Bridge Section P Grave 52\n\nCalder David James Leading Aircraftman 1346894\n\nNo. 911 School Squadron, United States Army Air Corps\n\nDied of wounds on the 6th of October 1942 aged 19\n\nDavid James Calder was born at Edinburgh in 1923 the only son of the Reverend James M.

They were to be escorted by Mustang fighters which would bomb enemy flak positions at Den Halder and Texal. Reconnaissance photographs showed the presence of twenty three enemy vessels in the harbour area. He took off again at 2.55pm along with eleven other aircraft from his Squadron for the operation. When the Squadron reached the enemy harbour they strafed and bombed the enemy shipping and were met with intense \"light\" flak from the enemy ships but scored strikes on a number of them and set one on fire. When they left the target area one ship was seen to blow up with another three larger vessels seen to be burning \"fiercely\" and another \"smoking\". Three smaller vessels were also on fire. Two of 143 Squadron's aircraft and one from 455 Squadron failed to return from the mission of which David Cameron’s aircraft was one.

He was educated at George Watson's College until 1931, where he was a member of the 1st Rugby XV. He went on to Bennett College, Sheffield where he studied for a Civil Service examination. He was granted a short service commission as an Acting Pilot Officer in the Royal Air Force on the 21st of December 1936 and was confirmed in his rank on the 12th of October 1937. He was appointed as an Acting Flight Lieutenant on the 2nd of March 1939 and was promoted to Flying Officer on the 12th of May 1939. He relinquished the rank of Acting Flight Lieutenant on the 16th of December 1939.\n\nHe was married to Mary Isabelle (nee Mill, later McCulloch) of \"Medan\", Craiglockhart.\n\nWilliam Cogman and his crew took off from RAF Driffield at 11.59pm on the 8th of September 1939 in Whitley Mk III K8985 DY-J for a leaflet dropping operation over Germany. During their mission they ran short of fuel and strayed into neutral Belgian airspace where they were intercepted by two Belgian Air Force fighters flown by pilots J. Offenberg and Alexis Jottrand. They were forced to land at Nivelles airfield where their aircraft was impounded, and the crew interned.\n\nThe crew was: -\n\nActing Flight Lieutenant William Curwen Gavine Cogman (Pilot)\n\nCorporal Sydney Reay Wood (Air Gunner)\n\nPilot Officer William Arthur Mack (Navigator)\n\nSergeant Gerard John Peter Henry (Observer) (Killed in action 28th April 1942)\n\nAircraftman First Class Alan Steel (Wireless Operator) (Killed in action 29th August 1940)\n\nHis wife received the following telegram dated the 10th of September 1939: - \"Regret to inform you that your husband Flight Lieutenant William Curwen Gavine Cogman is reported as interned in Belgium following a forced landing on 9/9/39. Letter follows.\"\n\nThe crew was initially interned by the Brussels Gendarmerie, but all were later interned with other British officers at Fort II,in the small village of Borsbeek near Antwerp. On the 24th of November 1939, William Cogman and William Mack, along with three other officers, effected an escape and returned to the UK and to their Squadron in the December, where William Cogman was assigned to A Flight.\n\nWilliam Cogman and his crew took off from RAF Driffield at 8pm on the 19th of May 1940 in Whitley Mk V N1417 DY-B for an operation on Gelsenkirchen. When in the target area, the aircraft was hit by anti-aircraft fire and the crew was forced to bail out. The Observer, Kenneth Thrift, was rendered unconscious by the explosion and was very likely already dead when the 2nd Pilot, Leonard Miller, dragged him to the escape hatch and pushed him out, pulling his ripcord as he fell. He and the others then managed to bail out of the stricken aircraft and it crashed at 11.30pm on the farm of Mr Wilbers at De Klef near Milheeze in North Brabant.\n\nThe crew was: -\n\nFlight Lieutenant William Curwen Gavine Cogman (Pilot) (Evaded)\n\nPilot Officer Leonard Miller DFC (2nd Pilot) (POW No. 0024 Stalag Luft III)\n\nSergeant Kenneth Victor Thrift (Observer)\n\nLeading Aircraftman John Robert Nicholson (POW No. 13040 Stalag Luft IV)\n\nAircraftman 2nd Class EH Bros (Rear Gunner) (POW No. 13043 Stalag Luft IV)\n\nLeonard Miller was not captured until the following day when he asked the Germans about the fate of Kenneth Thrift. He was told that he was dead and that his parachute had not deployed. The surviving members of the crew were all captured except William Cogman who managed to evade capture and make his way across the German frontier where he crossed into Belgium and got to Bruges. He later travelled to Ostend where he hid for a while in a farmhouse. On the 26th of May he telephoned Royal Air Force Headquarters in France to report that he was safe. The following day he entered the port area where he boarded the coastal steamer SS Abukir, under the command of Captain Rowland Morris-Woolfenden, which set sail for England at 10.30pm that night with around 480 passengers and crew on board. She was armed with a single Lewis gun.\n\nAs the ship sailed out into the Channel it was followed by an aircraft which was dropping flares to illuminate the vessel. This continued for an hour and half while other aircraft dropped bombs, although she sailed on. At 1.15am on the morning of the 28th of May 1940, the SS Abukir was off the port of Nieuport and near to the Noordhinder lightship, when the German E Boat, S35, under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Obermaier, attacked her, firing two torpedoes. These were avoided by the skipper who was sailing a zigzag pattern, but twenty minutes later S35 appeared on their port bow from where she fired two more torpedoes. The first missed but the second struck the coaster amidships, causing her to break in two, burst into flames and sink by the bow in about a minute. Although most of the passengers and crew had been killed in the explosion and sinking, the S35 turned her searchlight on and began to machine gun the survivors in the water. Between 24 and 33 survivors (numbers vary) were rescued at daybreak by four British destroyers, having spent six hours in the water. William Cogman was among the dead.\n\nPilot Officer Ian James Muirhead, who had been shot down on the 26th of May, was on board the SS \"Abukir\" and survived. He compiled a report on the events of that night which included a mention of William Cogman: - \"So far the Air Ministry have not tried to contact the skipper of the boat who was saved and is he, or myself who could help them regarding personnel on board etc. There was one V.R. lad, a lad called Cogman who jumped behind German lines and had walked and scrounged lifts for a week including crossing the German frontier in uniform.\"\n\nThis information promoted the Royal Air Force to ask him for more details of his encounter with William Cogman which he did in a letter written at the Palace Hotel, Torquay dated the 1st of July 1940: - \"Dear Sir, In reply to your letter of the 27th re F/O W.C.G. Cogman. F/O Cogman as far as I can remember him was a well built chap of about 5ft 11 fairly heavy featured, dark hair. The mistake about the V.R. I think occurred through his borrowing a coat with V.R. on it probably from F/Lt Symons whose name I appear to have got down as Stevens. F/Lt Symons was fairly tall, fair haired and a good linguist, as apparently was Cogman who was with Ives and myself for some considerable time. Cogman's story was that he had been shot down by AA fire near Dusseldorf at night and his crew were apparently killed (sic). His machine was set on fire and he had to jump at night in the vicinity of Dusseldorf. On landing he got as far away from the parachute as possible and made for the coast. On one occasion he walked within thirty yards of a German patrol and turned round and walked away without challenge. He was then in RAF uniform. He then apparently crossed the German lines at night by rowing down the River Scheldt and after scrounging a bicycle, worked his way to the vicinity of Bruges where he must have contacted \"Panther\". Incidentally, several airmen with \"Ps\" on their shoulder were with us both at the farmhouse at Ostend where we took refuge and later on the Abukir. I think several were picked up. I understood the P to indicate Phantom but I'm probably wrong on this point and I have an idea that the officer I referred to as F/Lt Stevens but who was probably F/Lt Symons had a similar small P on his shoulder. I could not be positive about this now however......... I am completely certain however about Cogman as he said he was from a Whitley Sqd and was in my company practically the whole time. I saw one body of a RAF officer the next morning but could not identify it positively. It was probably F/Lt Symons. I trust this will help you in your quest and if I remember anything further, I will let you know sir. Yours sincerely, Muirhead\n\nFlight Lieutenant Ian Muirhead DFC, 605 Squadron, was killed in action during the Battle of Britain on the 15th of October 1940.\n\nHe is commemorated on the war memorial at Davidson's Mains, Edinburgh.\n\nHe is commemorated on the Runnymede Memorial Panel 5\n\nCraik, Thomas Baldwin Private 7929\n\nArmoured Car Company, Federated Malay States Volunteer Force Southern Area\n\nDied on the 21st of August 1945 aged 36\n\nThomas Baldwin Craik was born at 64, Strathearn Road, Edinburgh on the 3rd of April 1909 the son of Thomas Craik and Helen Davidson (nee Baldwin) Craik of 64, Strathearn Road, Edinburgh.

On leaving school his family emigrated to New Zealand, but the ship they were on was sunk by a German mine and the family lost all of their possessions. With employment opportunities lacking in New Zealand the family moved to Australia after about eighteen months where they settled in Victoria and farmed at Tongala. He was very involved in his local Anglican church, where he led the bible class and was drawn to missionary work. He and a colleague, David Howell, went on an evangelical tour of Gippsland. He joined the Melbourne Bible Institute in 1927 where he was appointed as senior student and was placed in charge of their outside evangelical work. In May 1928 he met with two companions, Carey Tolley and Hudson Southwell, to discuss the formation of an organisation to convert the natives in the jungles of Sarawak to Christianity. In August 1928 the Borneo Evangelical Mission was formed and in the October the three men sailed for Borneo via Singapore. With the other evangelical organisations already operating in Borneo being concentrated in the port and coastal areas, the new mission travelled into the interior of the country where they worked with some success among the Iban, Murut and Kelabit tribes. On the 7th of February 1935 he was married to Edith (née Gray) at the Residency in Limbang. Also in 1935 he was chosen to work in the Trusan area. When the Japanese invaded Sarawak on the 16th of December 1941 he fled to the north of the country but was eventually forced to surrender. He was interned at Kuching Civilian Internment Camp where he was subjected to heavy labour by his captors and, suffering from malnutrition, he died there.\n\nHe is commemorated on the Civilian Roll of Honour at St George's Chapel, Westminster Abbey.\n\nDawson, Quintin Dunlop Maxwell Sergeant 7603192\n\nRoyal Army Ordnance Corps\n\nDied on the 2nd of June 1942 aged 30\n\nQuintin Dunlop Maxwell Dawson was born at \"Ravenswood\", Buckhaven, Fife in 1912 the elder son of Dr John Maxwell Dawson MD DPH and Jean Elizabeth (nee Dunlop) Dawson of 32, Lauder Road, Edinburgh.

At 5.10pm they boarded DUKW amphibious vehicles, with A and B Companies entering the water at 7pm as the leading wave of the attack. They were to be followed by C and D Companies at 7.30pm. Poor navigation by the DUKW crews meant that the leading wave was unable to find the landing beach on the far side with A Company arriving at the correct beach at 1am and B Company, who had gone too far north, arriving at 2am.\n\nMeanwhile, C, D Companies and Battalion Headquarters landed at 10pm and began to push inland. Almost immediately they ran into a minefield where they suffered casualties from anti personnel \"S\" mines and booby trapped Teller mines. They continued to try to push forward and to find a path through the mines but came across more mines and suffered more casualties. They fell back to the beach where D Company tried to push up a narrow beach but came under heavy machine gun fire from enemy positions hidden in rocks to their southeast. Following two failed attacks, the commanding officer ordered his men to hold their ground in the sand dunes to await the two missing Companies. With the arrival of A Company at 1am a fresh attack was made at 4.45am but this was met with very heavy mortar fire followed by an enemy counterattack which forced a withdrawal and saw the loss of half the men engaged. At 6am the decision was taken that all further attacks would cease and that they would hold the bridgehead where they were.\n\nCasualties during the attack were approximately seven officers and one hundred and forty men.

He was transferred to the General List on the 8th of June 1940, shortly before his battalion embarked for service in France, on the 12th of June, and was attached to the Directorate of Military Intelligence at the War Office. He transferred to the Intelligence Corps on the 19th of July 1940 where he served in the Intelligence Training Establishment, and was promoted to temporary Lieutenant on the 21st of April 1941. He was promoted to Lieutenant on the 13th of July 1941 and to Acting Major on the same date. He was mentioned in despatches for \"Recognition of gallant and distinguished services in the Middle East during the period November 1941 to April 1942\", which was announced by the War Office on the 15th of December 1942 and was mentioned in despatches for \"\"Gallant and distinguished services in the Middle East\" which was announced by the War Office on the 13th of January 1944.\n\nHe was awarded the Order of the British Empire, which was announced by St James' Palace on the 23rd of March 1944, in recognition of his service in Sicily. The recommendation for the award reads: - \"This officer has on several occasions rendered Eighth Army particularly valuable services. He is an officer of outstanding ability in the Intelligence world, and is always willing and ready to lend a hand wherever required. He was attached to the Eighth Army for some weeks during the battles at Mareth and the Gabès Gap and I cannot speak too highly of his work. Personal gain means nothing to Col. Ewart, he is 100% out to give his best for the common cause. Besides his service with Eighth Army, he performed invaluable work whilst employed at GHQ when I was DHI. I consider he requires some special recognition.\" The recommendation was signed by Major General Francis Wilfred de Guingand Chief of Staff, Eighth Army.\n\nHe was created a Commander of the British Empire (Military Division) for his work during the German Ardennes offensive, which was announced by St James' Palace on the 21st of June 1945. The recommendation for his award reads: - \"This officer was responsible for the tactical intelligence throughout the German offensive in the Ardennes. His task was to keep the C-in-C appraised of the enemy situation and to give personal guidance to the armies under command in a very difficult situation. By regular visits to the battle and close personal touch with the situation (in addition to the usual Intelligence sources) he was able to produce a volume and accuracy of information which kept the armies fully informed of the situation and enabled the C-in -C to make such dispositions as he deemed fit in relation to the tricky problems created by the enemy's earlier successes. He was tireless, accurate, even brilliant in his work at this critical juncture and without his presence both in close touch with the C-in-C and with the battle it would have been impossible to have produced a coherent view at a time when accuracy and calmness were more than ever demanded. Col. Ewart made a very substantial personal contribution to the defeat of the enemy's last gamble in the west and he is confidently recommended for the award of CBE.\"\n\nHe was promoted to Major on the 24th of December 1942 and was promoted to temporary Lieutenant Colonel on the same date.\n\nHe was promoted to Colonel on the 2nd of June 1944 and by April 1945, he was the second most senior Intelligence officer in 21st Army Group under Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery. At the beginning of May 1945 Montgomery's headquarters was at Lüneburg Heath where negotiations for the surrender of German forces had been carried out over the previous days. On the 3rd of May the first German delegation arrived and Montgomery demanded the unconditional surrender of all German forces facing 21st Army Group. There was to be no further negotiation. Joe Ewart was in charge of drawing up and translating the surrender document and to translate what the Germans had to say, although Montgomery was not prepared to hear what they had to say so his translation skills were hardly used as there was little dialogue. The German delegation returned the next afternoon and signed the document with Joe Ewart in the room close to Montgomery. The war ended at 8am the following day, the 5th of May 1945.\n\nHe died from injuries as the result of a road accident close to the town of Melle, near Osnabrück in Germany.\n\nHe is buried at Munster Heath Cemetery Plot 2 Row F Grave 24\n\nEwing, Robert Ross Brigadier General OBE"
