        "text": "Author Archives:\n\nAbout mary corbin\n\nArtist, writer, yoga teacher and outdoor adventure enthusiast. Can't get enough well told stories, vibrant color and walks in the woods.\n\nBasking in Beauty and the Many-Splendored Wonders of a Colorful Autumn in the Heart of Appalachia (Part II)\n\nOctober 22 – November 5, 2019: checking out the hip vibe of Asheville, North Carolina and environs; a visit to Greenville, South Carolina to take in the burgeoning food, culture and arts scene; a sobering visit to the Museum of the Cherokee Indian; much waterfall chasing and hiking in pristine forests; a glimpse of Georgia’s “Deliverance” country; and indelible memories camping on the Wild and Scenic Chattooga River.\n\n“Wonder. Go on and wonder.” – William Faulkner\n\nFrom Knoxville, Tennessee, it’s on to Asheville, North Carolina – 108 miles distant, a sign just outside the city limits indicates. We’re eager to see what all the fuss is about in what has lately (and quickly) become one of the country’s top destinations to relocate to. Our itinerary will take in a large swathe of the Blue Ridge Mountains, several National Forests, dozens of historical sites and landmarks, beautiful creeks, rivers, waterfalls and hiking trails, and small artsy towns contained within a 205,000 square mile area defining Appalachia USA: 13 states, from northern Mississippi to southern New York. Our circuitous route will wind through parts of four of the Appalachian states: Tennessee, North and South Carolina, and Georgia. And all points in between, surrounding, abutting and leading to beauty and history.\n\nWe’ve got a few hours to burn before settling into our accommodations for the next two nights at “Mark’s Place” in Canton. Judging from previous guests’ appraisals, “Caroteo” is a highly touted Airbnb. After several nights in hotels in the big cities of Tennessee (see Part I), we’re looking forward to a “place of our own” in a tranquil, rural setting.\n\nFirst things first. A quick internet search turns up a promising hiking area near Sylva – Pinnacle Park, located in the 1,088 acre Fisher Creek Watershed. Though we don’t see a single pinnacle, the gentle, woodsy setting offers a perfect respite, truly a breath of fresh air, for a couple hours’ worth of leisurely hiking along a sing-songy brook beneath a colorful canopy of trees. Not a bad first introduction to the wonders of Mother Nature in North Carolina.\n\nBut only later do we find out about the famous “must-see” Judaculla Rock located a few minutes away in some farmer’s field. How on earth in the atlas of strange places did we manage to never hear of the Judaculla Rock? For centuries the eroding soapstone boulder has been a sacred and enduring spiritual marker to Cherokee Tribal people. Lost in the mists of mythological memory, little is known of the hazy origins of Judaculla Rock and its mysterious inscriptions of bizarre hieroglyphic like symbols, estimated to be perhaps 4000 years old.\n\nAccording to Cherokee legend, Judaculla, known as Tsul’kalu, was a fearful beast who leapt from a mountain top and left its 7-clawed imprint in the rock. Many spooky stories have been handed down through generations about ghosts and bizarre energy associated with Tsul’kalu. Tom Belt, a Cherokee Tribal native and educator, says the ancient symbols, which remain undecipherable, are sacred and important, connecting the Cherokee “not only to our own people in the past, but they connect us to that time, the element of time, and it makes it all then like we’re still here. We’re still here and we never left.”\n\nTom Belt is referring to the spiritual imprint of place and sacred sense of belongingness that the Cherokee still feel and deeply reside in karmic memory – despite having been “relocated” as a Tribal people nearly 200 long painful years ago. “Relocated” really means forcibly removed (in 1838) from their homeland to Indian Territory on the Oklahoman frontier by the fiercely anti-Indian Andrew Jackson administration in the historic tragedy known as the “Trail of Tears” . . . a multi-pronged land and water course trajectory that swept the Cherokee homelands clean of their presence, the Trail of Tears overlapped with our roundabout itinerary, serving as a constant reminder of what poet Edgar A. Guest described (in another context) as a “winding trail of wrong that time may never right.” Today the Trail of Tears is memorialized in monuments, plaques and museums dedicated to a resilient unconquered people. (More on this down the road when we visit to the Museum of the Cherokee Indian.)\n\nBack in Canton, we pull into Caroteo, our Airbnb for the next two days and base from which to launch forays into the surrounding area to hike, explore, see what’s what and where’s where in this part of the country we’ve never been to before. A master carpenter, Mark designed his functional home with a zen-like sensibility, including guest lodging upstairs to take advantage of the many travelers passing through seeking a cool place to stay.\n\nThough we have a private room, all other areas are shared common spaces. While garrulous and needy for attention during our common time together preparing meals or watching a movie, Mark proves to be an amiable host and charismatic person with lots of knowledge to impart about places to go and things to do. Hilariously, he’s also a dead ringer for, and talks just like, Woody Harrelson! Yet despite encouraging usage of his “shared space” with guests, he’s a hair on the proprietary side, as we learn our first morning on waking when he’d arranged all of our dry and refrigerated food and kitchen items in a manner more to his suiting.\n\nThere’s also a woodworkers studio attached to Mark’s property, and one day as we’re leaving to go on a hike, we stop to chat with one of the craftsmen who gives us a friendly wave. Turns out he’s a Native American elder from Minnesota by way of Canada who regales us with a stories of his traditional upbringing and later activism with the American Indian Movement, joining in on the occupation of Alcatraz Island among numerous other acts of protest. He also is Leonard Peltier’s cousin, so we get an earful about Leonard’s plight before thanking him for sharing his personal story, knowledge and wisdom with us. (Wish we’d taken a photo.)\n\nThe next day, October 23, dawns crisp and clear, heralding blue skies and perfect hiking weather, so we pack a lunch and drive the short distance to the Big East Fork trailhead off Highway 276 in the Pisgah National Forest – wilderness designated land boasting sparkling streams, steep ridges and rugged 6,000 ft. peaks draining two forks of the Pigeon River.\n\nHiking along the Big East Fork could last for a couple of hours, take all day, or occupy several days of backpacking, depending on your timetable, inclination, and abilities. We choose to saunter along a leaf-splattered, stream-side trail, one of those slow-moving, take-it-all-in outings where one “distraction” after the next prevents us from covering much ground, but, oh, what little glories and supremely heart-felt accomplishments, to witness such beauty in our midst, and take in the small miracles of creation oft-unnoticed in the speedy hiker’s impatience and rush to move through the landscape in search of bigger and better views. That insatiable yearning to forge ahead at breakneck speed we knew all too well in past days of long-distance hiking prowess.\n\nBut today, it’s enough to just discover the simple sights and sounds of what’s around the next bend. Right where we are: “Deep in the quiet wood“, as poet James Weldon Johnson reminds us. Where we find our better self. Where crap melts away and mental detritus dissolves. Where the carnal incrustations of life’s oppressive weight are shed, and society’s rude demands made a bit more bearable. Deep in the quiet wood, rife with birdsong and the soothing melodies of water running over rocks, and the gentle rustle of leaves tickled by a fair breeze, “Filling earth for you with heavenly peace and holy harmonies.“\n\nIn our less hurried mind frame, in more attuned moments of slowing down, we are able to stop, look, listen, and see things, at once more mindful and mindless; when we make every effort to sharpen the senses in order to fully appreciate “the daily and hourly miracle of the usually unnoticed beauty that is close at hand” as Joseph Wood Krutch says. Maybe all this lyrical talk is just our way of making up for no longer being physically capable of engaging in those rollicking, strenuous pursuits of youthful days, when we were forever in search of the bigger, the longer, the farther, the better . . .\n\nNext up, a day and night in Asheville at Julie’s place, a sweet Airbnb in a walkable neighborhood. Come to find out, most of Asheville is walkable, and we spend the entire day proving that point to ourselves. We check out hoity-toity galleries in the arts district; tool around the cozy downtown area people watching; poke our noses into shops and more galleries; and enjoy a spell of shopping and chit-chat with locals at a bustling farmers’ market in a quintessentially Southern Americana scene. That night we dine at a fabulous vegetarian restaurant (The Laughing Seed Cafe) and have just enough energy to slog back to Julie’s place and collapse with aching feet, too tired to even watch a movie, hitting the hay early to refresh for the next day’s hiking adventures in the glory lands of the Pisgah National Forest.\n\nSo much to see and do in Asheville for such a big little city! One day we tour the historic Omni Grove Park Inn. Construction on the mega-hotel complex was completed in 1913, instantly attracting the rich and famous, including presidents, movie stars, and assorted luminaries for its hot springs and spa-resort appeal.\n\nOver the course of two summers in 1935 and 1936, the woebegone F. Scott Fitzgerald rented a pair of suites (one for writing) for a triple dose of the R’s: “rest, relaxation and respite”. (His bipolar wife, Zelda, was institutionalized in 1936 in Asheville’s Highland Hospital.) Recovering from tuberculosis, Fitzgerald holed up to concentrate on reclaiming his writing skills, and rehabilitate his declining reputation. His time at the Grove Park Inn was neither happy, fruitful nor restorative, according to reports.\n\nProbably drunk, given his legendary intake of “fifty ponies of beer a day” (trying to wean from a gin addiction), he broke his shoulder while diving, preventing him from accomplishing much in the way of writing. A New York Post reporter paid a visit for an interview, and described Fitzgerald as “a very broken man, who’s physically feeble and mentally very pathetic.”\n\nA tainted legend and dark chapter, indeed, in the life of the the once nonpareil writer and soul of the jazz age, but a somewhat happier ending was in store when he returned to Hollywood, moderated his drinking excesses, and wrote his unfinished masterpiece, The Last Tycoon before dying in 1940 at the ripe, young age of 44.\n\nAnother day in Asheville. We stroll around the beautiful manicured grounds and woodsy paths of the North Carolina Arboretum adjacent to the wide, lazy French Broad River, one of the oldest waterways in the world judging from the ancient rock through which the river carved its course. We follow a sinuous path that takes us to the Arboretum, and then veer onto Bent Creek Road to admire the National Native Azalea Collection and a most impressive Rhododendron thicket, while exploring the small, intimate charms of little old Bent Creek.\n\nNo superlatives here, only a lovely little place, nothing of outstanding grandeur or magnificence, mind you, just more of the same: an abundance of small miracles and simple beauty, hidden in plain sight there for the looking. Native trees in colorful foliage. Riparian flora abloom. Moss-carpeted rocks begging to be caressed, and painterly streaks of bark-splotched lichen, inviting a curious gaze such as one would cast upon works of art in a museum. Odd-looking fungi popping up all over moist creation.\n\nLeaving Asheville temporarily, we extend our “deep in the quiet wood” reverie for two nights camping down a little-used Forest Service road off the main Highway 276. We maneuver Homer over a couple of puddles and muddy ruts to find a perfect site situated amidst sylvan splendor far from any other campers in the peaceful bosom of the Pisgah National Forest. As far as we can tell, we’re the only ones encamped along the six mile stretch of backroad the Forest Service allows for camping specifically for people like us to escape the noisy, party types crowded together in smoke-choked “official” National Forest Service campgrounds with their fire-rings, hook-ups, stinky pit toilets, etc. (If you can call that “camping”.)\n\nElated to have the entire surroundings to ourselves, we settle in for forty-eight hours of pristine solitude, a complete break from all the hustling and bustling around. The only people we encounter are other cyclists when we hop on our bikes and ride along a flat service road, through a beautiful painted leaf forest, a few miles to the desolate trailhead at Wash Creek Horse Camp where a few cars are parked, all mountain bikers.\n\nA friendly, fresh-faced Forest Service ranger is attending to duties and we engage him for a few minutes, curious to learn more about the sign posted near our camp screaming in capital letters,“WARNING CAMPERS! The Forest Service is considering closing this area to all camping. Why?”\n\nYes, why? WHY ARE PEOPLE SO RUDE AND IGNORANT? Why do they despoil the water in their own well? Why must they bring their depraved city ways to tarnish and debase the purity of wild areas? Why must they leave their trash, toilet paper and garbage strewn about – not like animals, that would be an insult to animals – but like the disrespectful morons they are? At our site, we actually have to clean up a nasty mess before we can even set up our tent – enough crap left behind to fill a garbage bag! We report it to the Ranger, who duly notes it with a kindly nod and a knowing sigh of disgust, and then gets to talking about what type of odious people are responsible for such blatant bad behavior and disrespect for nature. And it turns out, not just bad behavior and disrespect, but potential danger. The ranger tells us how he’s constantly harassed and threatened in the course of his rounds when he must approach and fine scofflaws and evict squatters, often not the friendliest of individuals.\n\n“It’s difficult,” he laments, “because we are not law enforcement, and they see us as powerless. And calling for an officer is useless because we’re so remote and the radio connection is shaky, and these guys know it. But I love what I do, so it’s worth it for me to try to educate people without angering or alienating them, but legally, there’s not much we can do to enforce the laws. Our only recourse is to close down these dispersed camping sites, which then punishes all you good people who obey the laws and respect nature.” The ranger then points out on a map he unfolds a half-dozen camping sites that have been shut down recently. “Site # 8 – your site – is next on the list, probably, so count yourselves fortunate you got it when you did” We shake our heads in sad resignation, thank him for his service, commend his bravery and dedication, and resume our bike ride.\n\nThe next day, as we’re leaving the way we’d come in, we recall having spotted two beater vehicles illegally pulled in the thickets, defacing the earth with muddy tire tracks and uglifying things with their course presence. The occupiers had sheared branches from trees and slung up ratty old tarps. Coming in we’d caught a glimpse of these sketchy characters the ranger had warned us about later on – two sleazebag chicks and a mean-looking dude – swigging Miller’s and smoking cigarettes. They begrudgingly waved as we slowly passed by trying our best to ignore their stares. During our conversation with the ranger, he’d told us about his tense confrontation with them earlier, and had given them 24 hours to vacate. Driving by, we notice they were gone, but, true to poor form, they’d left a bunch of garbage for the ranger to clean up.\n\nAnother day, in pursuit of countless wonders yet discovered, like Annie Dillard at Tinker Creek, we “wake expectant, hoping to see a new thing.” So off we go in search of it, cruising scenic Highway 276, stopping along the way to admire heartrending beauty right off the roadside, the kind of sights you’d normally have to hike in ten miles to appreciate. Thundering waterfalls. Majestic creeks. Pretty forests. Far-flung views of the Blue Ridge Mountains and its lonesome backwoods “hollers”, filled with old growth trees and the specter of sauntering bears, prowling mountain lions, lost Cherokee paths traced by the quiet ghosts of hunters and trackers.\n\nOur imagination runs wild envisioning Appalachian Trail through-hikers slogging their way toward their final Valhalla, the wind-whipped, rugged Mount Katahdin in far wood-shrouded northern Maine. And with a longing in our hearts to be there, there, there! Before realizing the importance and necessity of being here now, here, here, here! Right where we find ourselves in perfect harmony with our incomparably beautiful surroundings. Despite the hordes in our midst, we find a way to achieve harmonic balance with being caught in the clutches of a madhouse situation, and finding escape to tranquil pastures untrodden by the masses.\n\nIn tow with a mob of other gawking sight-seers, we pull off the road to pay homage to Looking Glass Waterfall, fed by a beautiful creek of the same name tumbling out of the rugged hills. It is stunning. As the crowd begins to thin out, we linger to soak in the magic and revel in luxurious isolation, fully appreciative of the miraculous nature of water that nourishes and sustains all life.\n\nWe give thanks and praise, and can’t help but wonder: what is it about water? Especially water gushing over rocks and down cliff ledges. Precious, sacred water that draws us to it, that fills us with surges of primal energy, envelopes us in pristine ecstasy, hijacks our central nervous system for the day. Writers, poets, mystics and philosophers throughout the ages have attempted to understand water.\n\nD. H. Lawrence observed that “Water is H2O, hydrogen two parts, oxygen one, but there is also a third thing that makes water, and nobody knows what that is.” Helen Keller referred to water’s “mystery of language” revealed to her in an epiphany when she suddenly realized that W-A-T-E-R meant “the wonderful cool something that was flowing over my hand. That living word awakened my soul, gave it light, joy, set it free.” Hermann Hesse understood water to be “the voice of life, the voice of Being, the voice of perpetual Becoming.” Rumi suggested we use “wisdom’s water” to “wash the dust” from our souls and hearts.\n\nAnd so, before leaving this magical spot, we close our eyes and let the splish-splashing song of the creek fill our souls with peaceful energy, losing ourselves in a blissful reverie, internalizing the sound of W-A-T-E-R and feeling every bit ONE with the precious substance that makes us, and the Earth, a unified whole. Enveloped in rapturous sensations of earthly delight, we stop to hear “the voice of the wood” and the song of W-A-T-E-R, welcoming the soft caresses and blessings of the Undines come to titillate us in our dreamy, timeless idyll by W-A-T-E-R’s edge . . . whenever we can, we bathe and baptize in its sweet cleansing, healing wisdom. To wash the dust from our hearts and souls.\n\nWhat adventure awaits now? What next up on the bucket list of exciting things to check off? Just down the road from Looking Glass Falls is another W-A-T-E-R wonderland: Sliding Rock Recreation Area showcasing a year-round beautiful creek, and because it is “off-season”, sans the namesake’s Recreation part of screaming kids and slap-happy adults in their big amusement park. We have the run of the place. A true luxury to have it all to ourselves, to just revel in silence and beauty, the purity and simplicity of things. We stroll down a lovely path to a pool at the base of the slide, breathe in the fresh mountain air, hug a tree, caress a velvety blob of moss, and dip our feet in the chilly water. Another soulful respite from all the driving and rushing about to see everything we can pack in – when it’s all right here, right now, right under our feet.\n\nSame with our little stroll on the Andy Cove Nature Trail, at first blush not “much of anything” but as we immerse in the deep, quiet wood, we realize we’ve been transported into an inner sanctum of precious and delicate beauty. We opt for a short loop, less than a mile, that takes us three whole hours to traverse. Not that we’re in a hurry! It’s just that every little thing along the way commands our attention and focus. The key to all such sensory attuning being what the old naturalist John Burroughs called “the art of seeing where things escape us because the actors are small.” Long ago in another time, Burroughs exhorted us “to look closely and steadily at nature” and take pleasure in the “minute things” about us. As we’ve gotten older, and a bit creakier, gone are the days of gallivanting about like billy goats, so we’ve become more adept at taking such advice – stopping to smell the roses – enjoying the small miracles and quiet reveries, the happy notes of bird song, and meditations of gurgling brooks, the satisfying, sensual communion with animist nature spirits that our earth-loving ancestors – and oh, don’t we, too! – worshipped.\n\nCan’t miss Greenville, South Carolina, next up. We’ve heard a lot about Greenville, another appealing scene on the rise – another get there while you can place to live on the growing list of formerly down on their heels small cities being transformed by a diaspora of techies, entrepreneurs, musicians, artists, young people and retirees, an inexorable influx, all ditching expensive and overcrowded, formerly desirable places, seeking more livable and lively communities to settle in. We’re off to have a look-see for ourselves, discover the recipe of what makes Greenville the new Asheville.\n\nWe arrange to stay a couple of nights to give Greenville its just due. We sense the cost of living is less expensive and the city equally appealing in terms of all the “KPIs” (key performance indicators) that rank in desirability: proximity to nature venues chief among them. Forbes Magazine rates its downtown as one of America’s best. In the midst of the Blue Ridge mountains, Greenville boasts a thriving music and arts scene, superb restaurants and boutiques, festivals, historic architecture, sites and museums. Not much to not like, we’d say.\n\nYessiree, Greenville appeals to the aesthetic sensibilities of the young and old alike, everyone flocking from everywhere to find the next great place to turn into the previous great place lately overrun and too costly to live in. Get there while you can, we keep saying to ourselves. Because like in Bend, Oregon and a dozen other once sleepy communities, the time’s they are a-changin’ – the times they have a-changed! – and soon you’ll be on the outside looking in, wishing, hoping you’d made the move sooner than later, if ever.\n\nOne day we hike the beautiful trails around Lake Conestee Park, spending the better half of a long day doodling around the Nature Trail Loop circling through a swampy backwater and the Reedy River, a classic deep south lazy “old man river” that captivates us at every bend with pretty views of lush scenery and magical reflections of colorful foliage in the river’s surface.\n\nAnd more simple walking, walking, the meditative exercise of the soul, where nature comes alive beneath our feet and in our hearts. Zen poet Gary Snyder tells us that “out walking, one notices ecology on the level where it counts.” So true, we slow moving walkers find out with each and every step we take in our soft and loving tramping upon sacred ground.\n\nThere really is a ton to see and do in the Greenville area, and we try to pack it all in, which is not possible given our limited time frame. See, to backtrack a bit, we’re on a mission to return to Asheville to hook up with Shannon and Meg, two friends of Mary’s brother and sister-in-law, Kurt and Jane. The lovey-dovey pair graciously had offered us lodging in their room for a night before our Greenville intermission (they were out of town), and departing that morning for Greenville, we’d forgotten a phone charger cord, plus we had left on their bed a small token of our appreciation – a card with three peace cranes Ora Lora had hand-crafted – that their dog, adorable Tulsi, had ripped to shreds in a fit of anxiety or jealousy, or who knows what, but Shannon and Meg returned to find a mess all over their bed! So, it was swell to return to Asheville and actually meet them and present them with three more of Ora Lora’s peace cranes (we had a ton of them from her memorial back in August). Plus, we had a small window of time to visit with a former Yoga student and friend of Mary’s, the sweet southern Tennessee belle, Jen Aly.\n\nBut we still have a couple of days in the Greenville area to tick off a few more bucket list items: Lake Jocassee, a big blue reservoir, no doubt a complete maaaaadhouse during busier summer times. We notice a group outfitted in scuba diving gear preparing to submerge in the lake, and approach a guy at the parking lot stripping out of his diving gear to ask what the story is with all the diving. He tells us Lake Jocassee is one of South Carolina’s hidden treasures, an especially great diving spot with deep, clear water holding secrets of submerged graveyards, wrecks and reefs. His enthusiasm almost makes us us want to try our hand – or lungs – at scuba diving!\n\nAs October gives way to November, we find ourselves on one of our wandering explorations at several more delectable waterfalls, but not first without a detour to check out Oconee Station and the William Richards Stone Block / Traders Brick House. Beginning in 1792, until 1799, Oconee Station served as a garrisoned outpost, erected to defend the westernmost frontier from “savages”. Make that indigenous Cherokee and Creek peoples defending their homeland from invading hordes of white Europeans (perhaps the real savages, after all).\n\nIn 1790, Creek Chief Hopotble Mico traveled to New York to negotiate a peace settlement but he was rebuffed in a failed treaty attempt, and returned to Oconee country to carry on the fighting, the raiding of settlements, engaging in skirmishes, and disrupting as much as possible further encroachments onto their sacred lands and hunting grounds that had sustained their cultures for millennia. Well, guess what. Time to scram. As Andrew Jackson so cold-heartedly put it a few years later, in his shameful campaign that precipitated the Trail of Tears, “Build a fire under them, and when it gets hot enough, they’ll move.”\n\nBy 1799, disease and warfare had decimated most Cherokees in the area. Eventually, the Oconee outpost went from being an armed garrison to a vital trading post, further sealing the disruption of a millennial-long lifeway. The two-story Traders Brick House, which Irish immigrant William Richards built in 1805, was an anomaly in a frontier inhabited by poor settlers dwelling in rustic log cabins. Richards stoked his wealth on the backs of eleven enslaved workers and eventually amassed thousands of acres of land and was known to be a “go-to” guy for flints, furs, bear and deer skins, ginseng, and valuable sundries hard to get in the frontier.\n\nToday the site is illustrative of a complex and changing history revealing strained relationships between southeastern Native Americans and expanding white Christian settlers driven by “manifest destiny” to colonize the “untamed” lands. You get the picture: subdue (= eradicate) the native peoples (= savages), make the land “productive”. The sad history of U.S. / Native American relations in an rotten acorn nutshell.\n\nOur last night in Asheville we enjoy a lovely dinner at another wonderful vegetarian restaurant downtown on Lexington. Rosetta’s Kitchen is a cozy scene on a rainy night, with excellent food and atmosphere, including a Kombucha bar in the center of the space. Mary’s so enamored of the place that upon leaving she forgets her purse slung on the back of her chair. Of course, despite momentary panic, the lovely wait staff takes care of it until we can return in the pouring rain to retrieve it!\n\nAn absolute highlight of our peregrinations in and around the South Carolina / Georgia border is primitive camping for several days along the stunning Chattooga River in the heart of Appalachia country. Established as part of the historic Wild and Scenic River System in 1974, the Chattooga wends its way through the Andrew Pickens Ranger District of the Sumter National Forest (South Carolina), alternating between wide, lazy stretches and roiling white water tumbling through rocky channels suitable for rafting and kayaking adventures. Or just kicking back and enjoying the views.\n\nIn late October / early November, the trees along the banks of the Chattooga come alive with color, flaunting their polychrome regalia in glorious reflections in the placid surface of the slow-moving river. We while away many hours strolling up and down the streamside paths mesmerized by the sublime mirror image effect of this tree-lined pageantry of dazzling autumnal beauty.\n\nNights are colder than expected, in fact so chilly that we’re forced to crawl in our sleeping bags and tents by around 7 pm, which makes for very long but cozy nights huddled together, but the horrors of having to rouse and crawl out of our slumber on all fours like bent over nocturnal creatures to relieve ourselves in the dead cold of night is a laborious effort repeated twice nightly, at least for one of us. Such are the things to complain about when encamped on the Wild and Scenic Chattooga River with no one about except a friendly fisherman dude from Atlanta set up in his sweet Teardrop rig about a hundred yards down the road who invites us over for beers and schmoozing one night.\n\nWe squeeze in a few more hikes in and around the ultra-scenic mountain hamlet of Highland, NC (population about 1,000; elevation 4,118 ft.). This part of the Blue Ridge Escarpment encompasses three states (Tennessee and the Carolinas), all within easy driving distance of at least a dozen major waterfalls dotting the area.\n\nThe fabulous Glen Falls is a short out ‘n back hike up and down a steep switchback trail to take in majestic views of a stunning 200 ft. tall triple-decker falls originating from the East Fork of Overflow Creek in North Carolina’s Nantahala National Forest.\n\nThree prime attractions in South Carolina’s Sumter National Forest are well worth the effort: Yellow Branch Falls is a beautiful, easy hike through lush forest leading to a huge rocky outcrop with a tickling cascade of rainbow spray flowing over it, easing the eyes and soothing the soul.\n\nAs judged by the presence of many people come to gawk, the can’t miss 100 ft. tall Issaqueena Falls is a real stunner, giving us a glimpse into Creek Indian folkloric history amid a gorgeous sylvan setting. Issaqueena Falls is named for a Creek maiden who feigned her death by “jumping” off the falls to avoid capture by Cherokee warriors, who did not pursue her, scared off by their belief that “evil spirits” inhabited waterfalls. We feel no such thing – only supremely beneficent water spirits pouring their delightful cargo over the cliff face and spraying refreshing mist into the air.\n\nAnd never enough and not too much, we can’t resist cramming in a third waterfall of the day – the 60 ft. high cascade of Station Cove Falls tumbling out of the Blue Ridge hills of the Oconee District, a lovely vision of Mother Nature’s handiwork in what ecologists call a “spray community” creating perfect conditions for organisms such ferns, moss, liverworts, salamanders, crayfish and aquatic insects to exist and thrive.\n\nAnd so idyllic days come and go, and more still to come, a constant push, push, push forward in an ever-changing itinerary, always moving and seeking our next destination, plotted out by lines on a map representing alluring territory, but representing so much more than a mere topogeny of place names we longingly wish to experience and know. There’s always next time, right . . .\n\nIf only it wasn’t turning into winter, though, why then we could venture forth into the Great Smoky Mountains, which we’ve barely skirted. Or get on the Appalachia Trail and do some real backpacking for once. Ah, if only . . .\n\nGearing up to kiss Southeast Appalachian country goodbye – before heading deep into Alabama and on to New Orleans by way of an unexpected detour to Destin, Florida – we tack west to Cherokee, North Carolina, and end up spending two nights in Franklin at the High Country Haven Camping and Cabin (Ashlie’s Place). We love our rustic little scene, as you can see how cute and darling it is.\n\nWe’re back on the road to check out the Museum of the Cherokee Indian in Oconaluftee Indian Village in Cherokee, North Carolina, gateway to the Great Smoky Mountains which will have to wait for our next visit. Someday, but not another 65 years that’s it’s taken to get here the first time!\n\nOn a rainy day, a museum tour is the perfect activity, though as you can imagine, a somber experience given the tragic history photographically and physically documented throughout the museum, a vivid accounting on full display of the horrific treatment – crimes – against the Cherokee, and by extension, against all Native American peoples.\n\nExhibits, murals and dioramas focus on social and cultural history / legacy, and artistic accomplishments, with a heavy emphasis on the period of time referred to, in the Cherokee language, as Nvnohi Dunatlohilvhi – “The Trail Where They Cried”. Now a National Historic Trail, The Trail of Tears, as it is known in English, was a fanning out network that included land and water routes to forcibly march and transport 16,000 Cherokee people westward to Indian Territory in Oklahoma.\n\nIt’s shocking to learn about the true history and fate of the Cherokee and so many other Native Americans throughout the Southeast (and the decimation of indigenous peoples throughout the Caribbean and all of the Americas). A vicious, bloody tale of betrayal, sabotage, war, disease, and cultural disintegration. The museum’s exhibits are unsparing in their presentations and depictions of callous, inhumane, genocidal mistreatment of the Cherokee by “God’s chosen people”\n\nIn 1811, though, Tecumseh branded the invaders as anything but. Earlier, in 1775, the “wicked white race” conned Cherokee leaders out of 20 million acres of ancestral lands in what is now Kentucky and Tennessee in the sham resolution known as the Sycamore Shoals Treaty. And that’s not the half of it, with much more deception, duplicity and malicious flim-flam to come foisted on Cherokee leaders. Evil windbag Andrew Jackson’s hollow deceitful words remains the epitome of a liar’s creed when he proclaimed to the Cherokee people, “your white brothers will not trouble you, they will have no claim to the land, and you can live upon it, you and all your children, as long as the grass grows and the water runs, in peace and plenty. It will be yours forever.”\n\nWell, “forever” lasted just a few years, leading up to the 1830 Indian Removal Act and the subsequent 1836 decision by Congress to ratify the Treat of New Echota (passed by one vote) which mandated the forced removal of all Cherokees from their homeland within the next two years.\n\nIt’s a sad, sobering, and moving experience – enough to leave our own little trail of tears as we make our way from one diorama and mural to the next depicting unimaginable savagery and brutality heaped on the Cherokees at the hands of white conquerors and settlers. Certainly, African-Americans shipped over from Africa as chattel slaves bore the brunt of inhumane barbaric treatment seared into memory like a firebrand, as did the Jewish people who collectively suffered a nightmarish history and ineffable atrocities at the hands of the Nazis, and in no less painful terms the Museum of the Cherokee Indian likewise forces us to confront the sorrowful reality of genocide of Native Americans in order to establish “this great nation” of ours. The legacy of tragedy continues to this day in the form of cultural impoverishment, high crime rates, drug and alcohol addiction, and a general feeling of hopelessness, dissolution and despair on many Indian reservations. All in all, the exhibits are a powerful reminder of a big fat lie and wrongdoing perpetrated, a concerted, conscious effort to exterminate “savages” blocking the way to “progress” in settling the great American continent and upholding its “liberty and justice for all” ennobling ideals.\n\nFinally, winding things down, a quick swing-through in Georgia, stopping long enough to get a taste of Helen, the touristy but dead-empty at this time of year German-themed town, and get a feel for Clayton, Rabun county, home of Billy Redden, the banjo playin’ backwoods mountain boy in John Boorman’s 1972 film Deliverance, who, left embittered and broke, claims to have been shafted by everyone out of his rightful share of profits and future movie deals. Probably truth spoken by the famous fiddler reduced to an indigent life working at Walmart.\n\nAnd gasp at the beauty of Tallulah Gorge and Falls State Park, on whose vertiginous cliffs Jon Voight scaled in said flick, and where the tightrope walker stuntman Karl Wallenda famously made history tippy-toeing across the gorge on July 18, 1970. The detritus of his daredevil endeavor lies strewn about near the lookout at the top of the cliff.\n\nWe wind up our drive-about / walk-about Appalachian Tour with yet another hike along a gushing creek to see Raven Cliffs falls near Dahlonega, Georgia (for the record), and spend one final cold-ass night camping down some lonesome “hunter’s” road in the Chattahoochee National Forest. The cold foretells winter about to bear down, a sure sign we need to start heading south to warmer climes. And so, back on a major freeway, we’re headed to Selma, Alabama, to take in some more sad, sobering history in the city of “Bloody Sunday” made famous in 1965 for its violent civil rights marches led by the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. and Congressman John Lewis, among many other brave protesters. Read our account in the next chapter of our journey along America’s Trail of Tears.\n\nFor now, it was adios, goodbye, see ya later, it’s been good to know ya, Appalachia Country. Hope to do it again sometime soon.\n\nBONUS LIVE FOOTAGE\n\nCOMMENTS FROM PEOPLE WHO DID NOT POST DIRECTLY TO THE BLOG:\n\nHey Tom, Thanks so much for brilliant Appalachia blog, so near and like the rural Kentucky of my roots. Thank you so much for sharing the Cherokee perspective as well. All of this beauty and wonder is their birthright murderously stolen from them and ravished. Despite America’s best efforts, some small pockets of little disturbed beauty and majesty can still be found. My great grandmother on my moms side was half Irish and half Cherokee and I am blessed to still hear at times the ancient voice of the Grandfathers. The human being is puny and deluded, a blind fool measuring itself against the vastness of eternity and the majesty of the cosmos. Long after man is gone and forgotten the Glory of nature will resound. This certainty gives me some peace. All of truth and mystery, all of understanding and healing constantly surrounds us and supports and sustains us. It requires heart and courage to bear the weight of the Glory. Thank you for sharing. As ever, Matin (Frank Lawrence)\n\nWow. What an amazing time you had. I’ve never been to Appalachia, but thanks to you and your write-up (and photos), I feel like I have! Now I can’t wait to visit one day. Thanks for sharing this. I’m so glad you guys had such a great time. Cheyenne Richards\n\nPerused your Appalachia trail blog and as usual enjoyed the photos – soooo much – yes the water water – you know I can’t imagine going camping if not near it. Boadiba\n\nOh my Tommy, what a super trip!! Thank you for sharing with me! So glad you are still able to do all that hiking and biking! Alice Williamson\n\nThanks for sharing another increment of your epic search for America. Started reading it last night, gorgeous photos. Ebou Camara\n\nLove this! Thank you for the adventure. WOW! Dahlusion\n\nThank-you, Tom, most enjoyable pictures. I do love that mountain range. Spencer Brucker\n\nGreat writing as usual. Perhaps you should self-publish a travel guide with a collection of your adventures. As you may recall I grew up in the Baltimore area and I spent a fair amount of time in the Appalachians, particularly as a boy scout (my troop hiked all the Maryland and Pennsylvania sections of the Appalachian Trial over the years I was in it) and I worked summers at a boy scout canoe base in Western Maryland on the Potomac. I still have a fondness for Harper’s Ferry, West Virginia where the Shenandoah and Potomac rivers join up. In my younger years, my parents took us on trips along the Blue Ridge Parkway and I know we covered Virginia and North Carolina. The last time I was in Asheville was for a niece’s graduation (she went to Warren Wilson). Your journal reminded me of how awesome it is there, so I have added to my mental list of places I want to re-visit. Andy Oppel\n\nOh my my my! I loved this. As a kid I lived in West Virginia from about age 5 to about age 10. My dad was a chemist and got his first job after his doctorate at Union Carbide in Charleston. My stepmom and I wanted to do the Blue Ridge a few years ago but life got in the way. I’m going to forward your wonderful story and totally awesome images to her as a worthy substitute for our dreamed-of trip. Thanks Tom and Mary…for taking us along with you! Mary DeShaw\n\nYour blog is fantastic! Annnd you were spot on: Tulsi sure did have an anxious episode. We still have those wonderful peace cranes from Ora Lora and an open door, for whenever the world reopens again. Meg ‘n Shannon\n\nA Grand Tour Through the Appalachian Heartland Seeking Natural Wonders, Rekindling Old Friendships, and Exploring Revitalized Cities (Part I)\n\nOctober 16 – 22, 2019: Part I of our swing-through checking out the many-splendored autumnal wonders of Georgia, Tennessee and the Carolinas; a stop-over to visit old friends in Athens; a diversion at a little-known prehistoric site on the Duck River in Tennessee; then on to acquaint ourselves with three Queen Cities of Tennessee: Chattanooga, Nashville and Knoxville.\n\n“… a Southerner is BORN into the lifestyle, there just ain’t no choice about it. Yer either a Southerner or ya ain’t.“ – Chad B. Hanson\n\nAfter our wonderful stay in Atlanta as guests of niece Marilyn, her husband Brian and their two delightful little scamps, Nax and Maris, we bid our adieus one Monday morning and set off on the next leg of our adventure – a grand tour of the Great Smoky Mountains and Appalachia country. Having never explored this part of the country, we knew not what to expect, and set no expectations, other than to have a great time exploring as many parks and forests and waterfalls as we could in between visits to three of Tennessee’s big four cities (sorry, Memphis, another time.)\n\nBut not without first diverting up to the venerably hip enclave of Athens, home to the University of Georgia Bulldogs and a premier music town as well, nurturing the alt-rock and new wave careers of the B-52s and R.E.M., as well as the likes of Indigo Girls, Drive-By Truckers, and for you musically arcane fans, the national acts of Widespread Panic, Danger Mouse, and Dead Confederate.\n\nBut our real reason for visiting Athens was to see our two sweet old amigos from my high school days who decided a couple of years ago to forgo their peripatetic ways and retire: the fun-loving, theatrical, long-time couple, Richard Chaney and David Swisher, who have been together for like, ever! (Since 1972?) It was a perfect opportunity on a gorgeous fall day to dart up to Athens for a quickie stop to hang out for a few hours with these two beautiful soulmates who have been in my life ever since Richard snagged a teaching position at Benton Central Junior-Senior High School in Oxford, Indiana and imparted some edjumacation in this yere cornfed country boy (though I ain’t no southerner!) and learned me some basics of journalism, even naming me co-editor of the county-renowned school newspaper, The Stampede!\n\nOn graduating in 1973, Richard cleared the way with my mom (Ora Lora) to accompany him on a road trip to New Orleans (David had flown down in advance) where they were to take up residence for the next several years (followed by other 7-year-itch living stints in San Francisco, Seattle, Tucson and Washington, D.C.) Back in those early traveling days, Richard and David graciously offered up hospitality and nonstop fun times in New Orleans on my way to and back from Latin American vagabondage with my then traveling companion and girlfriend, Marie Ceccanese. Throughout the years, we have kept in touch with one another – keeping tabs on our creative endeavors, professional lives, and all manner of doings, comings, and goings. Hey, boys, it’s been good to know you – a jolly good time, too, we had, albeit ruefully brief, in Athens!\n\nNext up, on the way to spend a couple of nights checking out Chattanooga, was a stretch our legs stop-over for a hike and look-see at the State Archaeological Park of Old Stone Fort, a 2000 year old ceremonial Native American site along the Duck River near Manchester, Tennessee.\n\nAlthough we were heading north, we were still in the south. It felt good to get out of the car and slowly saunter along a beautiful trail through an autumn-tinged forest with reflections of colorful trees in the slow-moving river. Small cascades and alluring pools beckoned us to water’s edge for quiet time and reverie, giving us time to reflect on and wonder about the prehistoric Middle Woodland peoples who designed the entrance of the fort to greet the rising sun of a sacred summer solstice morning heralding the advent of seasonal cycles and propitious augurs for a bountiful harvest, happy hunting, good health and community spirit.\n\n“Chattanooga is a fine old town, sugar babe . . .” – Johnny Cash\n\nWe rolled into Chattanooga planning to spend just a night, having heard good things about the city, but in our minds we were thinking it was still just a big, ugly transit hub of an industrial wasteland – how wrong we were!\n\nAfter reading a bit about how it’s become a “go-to” place for young families, artists, hipsters and entrepreneurs (what place isn’t nowadays?) looking for an affordable, decent place to live, we decided to stay and experience the Chattanooga Choo-Choo for two nights.\n\nWe checked into a nice hotel and spent the next couple of days cycling the Riverwalk / Bike Trail; day-hiking the surprisingly rugged and ecologically diverse North Chickamauga Creek Gorge State Natural Area; and spent languorous evenings strolling around the renovated (gentrified) city, peering into shop windows, stopping in brew pubs for a cold one, and walking slowing across the lit-up pedestrian-only historic Walnut Street Bridge spanning the Tennessee River to check out the North Shore’s offering of more hip restaurants, shopping and entertainment venues.\n\nThe Riverwalk / Bike Trail extends 22 miles along the scenic Tennessee River, but the first part of our ride was anything but. At the beginning, a large stretch of trail was closed off for construction, so we had to detour onto busy streets. Another lengthy section followed an industrial line of ugly factories, right about when we stopped to chat with a passing cyclist who proudly proclaimed, “Oh, yes, we’re lucky to be living in Scenic City!” We found an alternate path on a boardwalk overlooking a pretty little creek for some good views, excellent birding and solitude, but eventually it came to a dirt path with a couple of more factories visible. Finally, we turned around and headed the other direction from where we parked, and found a truly beautiful stretch of trail, but by then, we’d expended all our energy and called it a day. All this is not to say we didn’t have a wonderful bike outing!\n\nWalking about the pedestrian-friendly city provided ample opportunity for people watching. Like anywhere, a mix of young and old, urban professionals, artists, hippies, punks, down on their heels buskers, and a fair share of street people, presumably homeless.\n\nWe spoke with a few folks who’d moved to Chattanooga recently, and they all praised it for its “livability” factor, citing an influx of creative people fostering an infusion of arts, culture, beer gardens, great restaurants, urban renewal architecture, and tourist attractions like the Tennessee Aquarium, Creative Discovery Museum, Chattanooga Zoo, and the Hunter Museum of American Art. Adding to the city’s cachet of attractions is its proximity to gorgeous nature locales such as Ruby Falls, Rock City, Raccoon Mountain Caverns, the Ocoee River offering up a bounty of water sports and fun, plus nearby access to the fabled Cumberland Trail in the Appalachian Mountains.\n\nWe loved strolling across the historic Walnut Street Bridge with its pretty sunset and night time views of the Tennessee River and Chattanooga skyline. We traced a few blocks along the Passage, a pedestrian link between downtown and the river, marking the beginning of the deplorably sad saga known as The Trail of Tears – a sobering encounter with history indeed.\n\nIn the Year of the Devil, May 1838, some 7,000 federal troops under the command of General Winfield Scott began rounding up Cherokee peoples who had refused to move to Indian Territory (Oklahoma). Ultimately, 17,000 natives were marched ruthlessly westward in a grueling journey in the middle of a dry sweltering summer, and 4,000 anguished souls perished under harsh, brutal conditions.\n\nSomehow, though, we managed to miss the “weeping wall’ representing Cherokee tears and the ceramic disk sculptures narrating the centuries-long, grand story of the highly accomplished Cherokee Nation, whose most famous member was Sequoyah, “the Cherokee who made the leaves talk” when he devised a complete writing system – the Cherokee Language – without first being literate in some language (a first in history!). Today, the Cherokee Nation is the largest Native American tribe in the U.S, and since the forced removal from their indigenous homeland in 1838 – 1839, are located on a reservation in northeastern Oklahoma.\n\nIt was time to ditch the city for a while, and get out to nature for a breath of fresh air. We thought about visiting Ruby Falls, Lookout Mountain or the Caverns, but we were scared off by internet reviews of those places being “madhouses” overrun with tourists so we tacked the opposite direction and found ourselves hiking in one of the most beautiful places we’d yet been to in the Southeast – and had never heard of prior to our online search: the North Chickamauga Creek Gorge State Natural Area where we looked forward to making some tracks on a portion of the Cumberland Trail.\n\nWe were so eager for a nature immersion! Just the words creek, gorge, and natural area said it all . . . WILD and BEE-U-TEE-FULL!\n\nLeaving the world behind, we entered a lichen and moss-rich diverse forest and riparian zone – a biota wonderland, in fact, with many endangered or threatened plants, with bald eagles and peregrine falcons soaring high above the gorge, and a plethora of bird, reptile and amphibian life. We had stumbled into Heaven’s Back Forty, and there we remained for most of the day, picnicking, wading, exploring small miracles here and there – a lizard doing push-ups, a painted leaf caught in the clutches of a mini maelstrom, the sound of birdsong – we just kicked back taking in the immeasurable peace, quiet and beauty of the place – all to ourselves! And in no special hurry to get back to civilization with its hustle and bustle and gritty hubbub.\n\nBut of course, we eventually had to leave this little slice of paradise and head back into town . . . for a final stroll across the old bridge at sunset to gaze out into the clear Tennessee night, and eventually continue on to the North shore of the river to locate that groovy vegetarian restaurant we’d read about: Sluggo’s!\n\nAfter our glorious nature outing, hungrier than a couple of bears, we tucked into (why am I using this “foodie” expression I so loathe?) some real tasty grub to the beat of Sturgill Simpson (why am I shamed-faced to admit that I had to inquire with the cute waitress who, exactly, was belting out those damn good tunes?), hung around reading some books on the shelf, groovin’ to Sturgill, and after some dessert, headed to people-watch as we slowly strolled hand in hand across the bridge.\n\nAnd, then, too tired even for an after dinner brew or more strolling, we headed back to our hotel with sated bellies and light hearts, eager for the next leg of our adventure. It was time to get off the Chattanooga Choo-Choo, wondering, hoping, when, if, there would be another boarding of the fabled train. Certainly, there are enough attractions and diversions to get back on for another ride someday.\n\n“Everybody now thinks that Nashville is the coolest city in America” – Dave Grohl\n\nIn our peregrination across “these great United States”, three music-centric cities stood out as “must visit” destinations. Two of which still needed to be ticked off the bucket list – New Orleans and Austin – but now, first, and finally, we were touching down in Nashville, Tennessee! (If only we were “true southerners”, we could pronounce it NASH-VULL!)\n\nRolling into the city, with Dylan’s famous Nashville Skyline cued up in our music player, we were giddy with excitement, hard to convince ourselves we’d never been to Music City. Outside of VEGAS and NAWLINS, NASH-VULL ranks high on the list of Party Capitals of the U.S.! We were about to find out why.\n\nA sense of deja vu washed over us as we rolled into town – like we’d been here before, it felt familiar and lived in. Maybe it was all the stories we’d heard from sister Tina and her husband Joe about their many business / pleasure visits here and all the fun and crazy times they shared with us.\n\nWhen we visited them in Walpole last August (2019) and told them of our eventual plans to spend a few days there and experience the zany bar scenes and raucous commingling in the streets for ourselves, they both immediately chimed in, “We’ll see you there! Can’t wait” Well, that never happened, disappointingly, but we weren’t let down by the city’s fun, frenetic energy.\n\nThough saddened that Tina and Joe couldn’t hop on a flight down to join us for some hearty partying, our visit was extra-special because we were about to meet our super-host Cindy – not of the Airbnb variety – who’d invited us as guests while in town. There’s nothing more wonderful than having a dear old friend invite you in while visiting a place for the first time.\n\nWell, actually a dear old friend of Tina’s from Walpole. Years ago, we’d met Cindy and her three little children (now all grown up) when she lived up the hill from Tina’s “Plimptonville” pad in Walpole (at the time married to her prestigious doctor husband of Chinese ancestry whom we’d never once met because, I understand, he was always on call, or mostly away working at New York City’s most famous cancer hospital as head surgeon).\n\nWell, Cindy laughed, and said, “You can imagine how that turned out!” So she’d up and moved to Nashville to be around her daughter, Emma, who was attending Vanderbilt University. But mostly, it was a chance to begin a new chapter after years of living in Walpole defined by her traditional role as wife and mother.\n\nWell, not no’ mo’! The “new and improved Cindy” was ready to bring it on, don her rodeo hat and put on her cowgirl boots and paint the town red! At least for a few months of unwinding and good times, and we were fortunate to have landed smack dab in the middle of her new chapter.\n\nA native Floridian (who has since relocated there), Nashville was, for the time being, comfortably close to her beloved southern roots. We found her in fine fettle re-inventing herself after the split-up and the kids had gone their separate ways.\n\nEver in lively spirits, and exploring being in a new relationship (since split up), all in all Cindy was just in a very good place, mentally, spiritually and location-wise. She kept saying how hard it was to beat the nonstop electric vibe of Nashville. “I just love it here!” she said.\n\nUber-happy, free of entanglements and obligations, she was in an “anything is possible / anything can – and will! – happen” frame of mind, and she treated us like dear old friends, too, showering us with some downright southern hospitality. Funny how it all worked out. We had reconnected back in August (2019) at Mom’s life celebration, and when she found out we planned to party down in Nashville sometime in the coming months, she jumped at the chance to extend an invitation to us. We were overjoyed and a bit shocked by her generous offer.\n\nI mean, here’s a person we barely knew, really, only that every time we saw her over the many years of going to Walpole to visit Mom and Tina’s family, we loved her effusive energy and fun-loving style. But at Mom’s memorial, I embarrassingly admit, I almost didn’t recognize her, the transformed vivacious woman, full of vim and appearing, seriously, half the age I thought she was! I espied her sitting at a table with my 25 year old nephew, Joey, and honestly thought she was his new girlfriend!\n\nOh, I imagine, Cindy, you will get a huge kick out of that! We hugged between tears and she said, “You guys just have to call me when you get to Nashville and stay with me for a few days!”\n\nWe had to work around her timing to make it happen, because she was off to a Kripalu Yoga Teaching Certification Workshop, where she was to become a freshly-minted certified “500-Hour Kripalu Yoga Teacher”, telling us in a text “the mind-blowing last module I did was life changing! I’ll fill you in when y’all get here!”\n\nYep, everything clicking for Cindy! So we zigged here and zagged there for a couple of weeks to ensure we would not miss our time with Cindy in Nashville.\n\nCindy resided in a modern upscale apartment complex about a fifteen minute walk from the main drag where all the action, bars and music venues were, but Nashville being Nashville, there was action, bars and music venues everywhere, even right across the street from her apartment on Demonbreun Street, where we had easy access to any number of bars, the best being Tailgate Brewery, Two Bits, Dawg House Saloon, and South. And within walkable distance, famed locales such as The Gulch, Downtown, and Music Row awaited to be plucked of their mystique.\n\nAfter greeting Cindy and her wise, wonderful old pooch, JoJo (aka “The Inspector”, “Dodi” and “Joseph P. Withers III, Esq.”), we settled into our bedroom with a large window overlooking the Nashville Skyline, and then proceeded to sit down for an endless “catch up” chat about everything under the sun. In a few short minutes of conversation – detailing our road trip adventures, hearing about her deep friendship with Tina, what her kids were up to, her recent Yoga teaching certification, and her love of and memories of Ora Lora – we learned more about Cindy than in the past three decades!\n\nWe enjoyed a wonderful few days with Cindy – when we could squeeze her in between overnight visits with her new squeeze – but we managed to have a few doozies of a night on the town, dancing to great honky-tonk music at Robert’s Western World, where we sat at the bar and watched a dude named Slim prep fries and baloney sandwiches on the grill, digging to his rhythm as he rocked to “Six Days On The Road” and other country classics pumped out by a band named, appropriately enough, Nashville Skyline.\n\nWe were very appreciative of Cindy’s hospitality and generosity. One day, she treated us to Sunday brunch at Rudy’s Jazz Room in a dark, neon-lit, intimate setting with a live band performing while we slurped cocktails and drooled over a buffet of delicious New Orleans-Creole style cuisine. I think I went back for thirds.\n\nAfter a couple of hours, we had to pull ourselves away or we would have closed the place down at 1 in the afternoon! And we had a full day ahead of us, including several walkabouts slated for JoJo, who despite his age, took on a well-heeled dog a third his age in a shocking display of aggression. Well, come to think of it, Cindy had warned us about “The Inspector’s” tendencies!\n\nOne day we just walked around the crazy streets jam-packed with tourists and – get this! – it was an especially maddening blitzkrieg of a weekend flush with a crowd-crushing influx of college kids in town because – imagine the insanity! – of a triple-header series of football games being played that weekend!\n\nIt was nearly out of control with boisterous partying drunken fools stumbling up and down the streets and riding idiotic party buses – but we took a deep breath and reveled in watching the street scene pandemonium unfold.\n\nOne thing for certain: lots of homeless and street people in Music City: decrepit vets, down-and-out druggies, broken-down run-aways, gritty chicks on street corners looking for a hand-out, and depressed looking musicians crowding one another out for space in front of prime venues or consigned to play some lonesome bar for peanuts at 2 in the afternoon.\n\nA tough way to make an easy living. And, nope, not a single celebrity sighting, in the city famed for famous residents, like Jack White, John Prine (RIP), Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban, Taylor Swift, Miley Cyrus, Kelly Clarkson, Dolly Parton, and the list goes on. Of course, mostly they stay out of sight, hiding themselves from the unwashed masses. Can’t blame ’em.\n\nAnd so, once again, with another few days of memorable events added to our ever-expanding list of truly incredible sights and people, we said farewell to our beautiful friend Cindy and the great city of Nashville, with a final quick tour around North Nashville to see what was up there – not a whole lot, we determined – but hoping to run into Todd Snider, maybe. No such luck.\n\nBefore leaving, Cindy said we could not leave with going out to breakfast at Loveless Cafe for some “Real Southern Food”, so we took separate vehicles there, since it was on the way out of town toward the direction we were headed – our next destination, another grand belle of a sister city: Knoxville.\n\nKnoxville: America Concentrated in One Spot” – Kristen Combs, Director of Communications & Social Strategies\n\nKNOX-VULL, we’d been told in that pronunciation by a struggling musician on the streets one night, is “way cooler” than NASH-VULL could ever hope to be. It was just a matter of whether you wanted to live in a cynosure of neon glitz, over-hyped country phoniness, a magnet for the homeless and down-and-out, and, let’s face it, a gross tourist bedlam, or, no poison to pick here, he pointed out proudly, “my home town” – a friendly, mellow city with an equally fascinating legacy of country roots and historic backstory as its more famous neighbor to the west.\n\nDude went on to praise his home town for being more down-to-earth, easier to get good paying gigs without competing with a million other aspiring musicians, and twice as authentic as Nashville in terms of country roots and tradition, nurturing the stellar careers of icons Roy Acuff, Chet Atkins, Flatt & Scruggs, Dolly Parton, and bluesman Brownie McGhee and the Everly Brothers. He said, “It ain’t called the Cradle of Country Music for nuthin’.”\n\nLike with St. Louis’ Walk of Fame, where we learned surprisingly about dozens of luminaries from the city, so too with Knoxville. Apart from the musically famous, other well-known sons and daughters of Knoxville include: James Agee, Quentin Tarantino, Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., Christina Hendricks, Nikki Giovanni, Jack Hanna, and for the esoteric literati among you, Joseph Wood Krutch.\n\nSo take that, Nashville, and stick it you know where, he was basically saying, pigeon-holing the three of us on a side-street for darn near half an hour, blocking sidewalk traffic and regaling us with an insider’s hard-earned wisdom of the artist/musician’s struggle in Nashville. (Mostly, can’t blame him, he was entranced with Cindy giving him the time of day.) “Helluva lot easier to make a livin’ in my hometown of Knoxville,” he said. “And anyway, I’ll put it up against Nashville any day.” Which prompted me to ask him, “So why are you here in Nashville.” He said he was giving up and going back to his hometown any day now.\n\nWe wished we had spent more time exploring and getting to know Knoxville, named one of America’s TOP 100 for places to live. Like everywhere that’s become (becoming) gentrified owing to exorbitant cost of living and congestion / pollution / crime issues in formerly desirable places to reside (uh, the Bay Area, Seattle, NYC, LA) . . .\n\n. . . historic Knoxville’s growth has been propelled by the same forces of civic development and expansion that has fueled growth in formerly once not so desirable places to live (a long list), as artist/ hipsters, entrepreneurs, restaurateurs, the whole lot of ’em flocking to the next “best place to raise your family” and transforming towns and cities across America.\n\nAll contributing to the meteoric growth in any number of once-sleepy, down on their heels towns in the Industrial (Rust) Belt or poorer states, places that have become beacons of such change, magnets attracting hordes of outdoors buffs and nature lovers, people sick and tired of cramped city living, and insanely wealthy brogrammers and other nouveau riche types.\n\nYou just know these places without even having to mention the state: Bend, Asheville, Reno, Tulsa, Fort Collins, Spokane, Austin, Mariposa, Sedona, Albany, OKC, the list is endless as a mass exodus of people out of no longer livable cities to rural, semi-rural and manageable mid-sized cities – places where they can (re)create the social and cultural zeitgeist they left behind.\n\nKnoxville seemed like just such a new livable place recreated in the image of the hippest, coolest Berkeley neighborhood: art galleries, artists community and art galleries, fancy restaurants, high-tech startups, cool street festivals, hip wine bars and micro-breweries, cannabis dispensaries, rock climbing gyms, bars, music halls, and meet-ups with like-minded refugees from never-never-again land.\n\nThrow in a smattering of pretty parks, sculptural gardens, and public squares lined with historic buildings in an arts and entertainment district, and, amazingly, two renovated world-class historic theaters, the Bijou and the Tennessee, not to mention nearby nature attractions – or escapes – and voilà, you’ve got yourself a bona fide culture-rich habitable city . . . that is, until it’s the next over-run, ruined, high cost of living, congested, polluted, crime-ridden example of rampant gentrification.\n\nWell, for now, it looks like Chattanooga and Knoxville (not so sure about Nashville) have escaped that fate, but both cities, nearly 200,000 in population, have bloomed between 7% to 10% in the past decade, and growing ever-faster owing to the allure of all mentioned herein, not least of which is a (supposedly) hot job market, diverse economy, and “good schools.”\n\nAlso, of the two cities, Chattanooga seems on pace to out-do Knoxville, as its population growth has outpaced the national average for more than 20 years. And with its reputation as a high speed fiber optic hub, nicknamed “Gig City” – there ain’t no slowin’ down in sight.\n\nThough growing exponentially, like Chattanooga, the city felt contained and manageable. Walking around was leisurely and non-hurried. We found parks to sit in by ponds and fountains, and enjoyed tracing a line of country music icon markers of famous sons and daughters, and stopping here and there to learn about its 225 year old history as a railroad and industrial center.\n\nThe morning we left we had a great breakfast at the cool artsy-fartsy eatery, OliBea, and took another quick spin around an architecturally famous area, and then climbed in Homer and said goodbye to Knoxville, see you the next time . . . and hauled off toward our next destination in our Appalachian tour: Asheville, North Carolina and environs, and a chilly (nights) camping adventure in the gorgeous Chattooga and Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia. Tune back in for Part 2 of “Our Grand Tour Through the Appalachian Heartland Seeking Natural Wonders, Rekindling Old Friendships, and Exploring Revitalized Cities.”\n\nBONUS FOOTAGE:\n\nEnjoy this snippet of a cool honky-tonk band beltin’ out a song that, as the late Jerry Jeff Walker wrote “don’t it make ya wanna dance.” Check out the pure joy emanating from the smiling guitar player, contrasted with the dopey drummer, who was probably just plain sick and tired of it all after a million gigs of the same old same old. Maybe was just sleepy.\n\nAnd this one from the boys in Nashville Skyline: a punkish looking lead guitarist, a hard-workin’ bass player straight from the “Streets of Bakersfield”, and a drummer who looks like he coulda been an uncle of mine back in the sixties.\n\nOh, Atlanta!\n\nA visit to the Peach State to see the sweetest peaches we know, Mary’s nieces Marilyn and Chelsea, the daughters of Mary’s brother Rich. And to meet the freshest little fruit of our family tree, Miss Maris McKinley Norman. From Oct 11 – 17, 2019\n\nGeorgia, Georgia, the whole day through\n\nJust an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind. ~ Gorrell / Carmichael\n\nMary’s recollection:\n\nI can’t believe it’s been nearly a year since I saw my lovely nieces, the two of whom define that word in completely different ways. It would be like trying to describe the beauty of a sunrise compared to that of a sunset. From the same source, yet vastly and contrastingly distinctive. Though a full year has passed, the lively spirit of this visit lingers deep in our hearts.\n\nLeaving our friends in Punta Gorda, Florida, we dropped in for an overnight at a hotel in Valdosta, Georgia with the friendliest staff imaginable and photographs of Woody Harrelson all over the lobby walls – apparently he stayed here while filming Zombieland. We learned that other films have been shot here over the years making it a sought after location for producers and directors looking for a solid Southern backdrop. Who knew?\n\nAfter a long and sugar-sweet confabulation with the hotel front desk clerk, we headed out early for Atlanta. We considered a stop in Macon to visit the Allman Brothers Band Museum but, missing the exit and feeling the desire to stay on the road, like a “Ramblin’ Man”, Tommy pressed on. As a side note, I met Gregg Allman in an interminable line at the Whole Foods one evening many years ago in Berkeley CA in the days he briefly lived there. He turned around to look at me and said hello. I humbly gave him his full due for enhancing my teenage years with his soulful voice and special brand of southern blues rock.\n\nArriving at my niece Marilyn’s home in Atlanta proper where she lives with her husband Brian, son Nax (short for Greek philosopher, Anaximander, who is the first person in recorded history to recognize that the earth exists as a solitary body – in case you were wondering!) and baby daughter Maris, we were welcomed in with southern hospitality firmly intact. A sweet home in the Loring Heights neighborhood of Atlanta, we felt immediately at home with family.\n\nIt was a Friday and Marilyn had taken the afternoon off work from her full time job to prepare for the weekend. On Saturday, a celebration of Maris’ first birthday was planned and others would be arriving soon. A dinner party was in the works for this first evening and we would be gathering with my other niece and Marilyn’s younger sister Chelsea, their mother and my brother’s ex-wife, Linda Marti and Linda’s sister Carmen who was flying in for the weekend from Michigan. Fun was certainly in store with this crew, I had no doubt.\n\nNax welcomed us in joyfully and showed us around, freely expressing himself in his excitement. The boy is not shy, he is adorable and full of energy and lots of questions, to say the least. A real boy’s boy, Nax was at the time of our visit one year ago on the cusp of four years old, growing and expanding each curious day in leaps and bounds! The family’s home was lovely and so welcoming to relax in with the Corbin/Marti/Norman clan.\n\nBrian, a true Southern gent, arrived home from work within a couple hours looking dapper and handsome as usual but ready for the weekend ahead. Within a very short time, Chelsea, Linda and Carmen arrived and bottles of wine and champagne were flowing, dinner was being attended to and before long, we were all gathered around the table enjoying each other’s company in fine form. I hadn’t seen Carmen or Linda in a long while and it was great catching up with them. Brian, who has a sassy sense of humor, kept things joyful and lively at the helm of this female dominant affair!\n\nThe Marti sisters and daughters are such wonderful women to share company with!\n\nDo we have an opinion about something? Of course we do. We are all strong, thoughtfully inquisitive and vocal women and there is no time for a dull or false moment. I love the company of the Marti women, though rare, it is always nourishing, supportive and interesting.\n\nThe next day was the big event, Maris’ 1st Birthday party, held outside on a lovely Fall afternoon at a nearby neighborhood park. Tommy and I got turned around on our walk over and had to summon Brian by mobile to get us back on track. The setting was lovely for this small gathering of friends and family there to celebrate Maris.\n\nWith an Alice in Wonderland theme, the picnic tables were bursting with stacks of cupcakes, “Eat Me” macarons and party favors. Maris wasn’t quite sure what to make of it all, especially that cake!\n\nAfter the party in the park, we ambled back through their charming neighborhood to hang out on the comfy back yard deck. More wine and champagne and pizza worked their way into the afternoon and plenty of lively banter and laughter ensued.\n\n“Behind every successful woman is a tribe of other successful women who have her back.” ~ Marilyn Monroe\n\nFeeling the day sink in, the evening could have been passed gracefully into the wee hours right there on the deck. But Chelsea had other ideas for me and Tommy. A dance performance across town was on the docket and we eagerly agreed to check it out with darling Chelsea, so we hopped into an Uber and motored across town to experience a dose of the arts a la Atlanta.\n\nWe arrived near our destination and hopped out to stroll the Inman Park neighborhood and get a feel for the area filled with old southern homes, coffee houses, restaurants and bars. As we found our way to the performance venue of the Whitespace Gallery through a pretty and romantically lit courtyard, we grabbed some drinks. We wandered in and out of the collection of various viewing rooms of this contemporary/alternative space to check out the art and live music prior to the performance of the Zoetic Dance Ensemble.\n\nWhen the performance began, dancers clad in neutral shades of lingerie ambled slowly across the courtyard and through the crowd. The performance, subtle yet captivating, unfolded as a beautiful expression of the power of women: Our natural beauty and strength individually and collectively, our diversity and complexity, our empathy and support of each other. A perfect theme for this particular weekend.\n\nExpressed in a contact-improv style performance, the ensemble moved slowly into and out of each space as the audience stood to watch or followed the dancers along from room to room. Occasionally one or two dancers would break out into a solo piece then integrate back into the group. It was poetic. It was breathtaking and life-affirming, soothing and dynamic, all at once.\n\n“I would like be known as an intelligent woman, a courageous woman, a loving woman, a woman who teaches by being.” ~ Maya Angelou\n\nAfterwards, we mingled with the crowd for a bit then began our long walk through the city via the Atlanta BeltLine, a former railway corridor through the core of the city, redesigned as a non-motorized and pedestrian only thoroughfare passing through different neighborhoods of the city. Currently running a 22 mile stretch and under development through 2030, the BeltLine is a great way to traverse the city and experience a variety of views and vibes.\n\nPassing lively outdoor patios, brew pubs and restaurants, skateboard parks, music venues and open greenspace, we finally spilled out into Ponce City Market and called an Uber for the ride home. Thanks Chelsea for having that event in your back pocket, turning us onto the arts scene and showing us some of your city!\n\nUpon returning to Marilyn and Brian’s, we found them having never left the back porch, hanging out with their next door neighbors and ready to plan some things for Sunday. The biggest agenda item was where to indulge in a big Sunday breakfast, Atlanta-style.\n\nAfter Brian explained the finer points of The Waffle House on Saturday night, the morning rolled easily into place and we ended up packing into two cars and heading for something even more classic to the region, The OK Cafe, where we got a big dose of throwback southern food and atmosphere.\n\nPancakes, eggs, biscuits and more, all served up with a heaping helping of sweet southern hospitality. Afterwards, we wandered into the adjunct take out shop to eye some of the goods and some funky art.\n\nAfter breakfast, a chill day was in order for Brian, so Marilyn, Nax, Tommy and I met up with Chelsea at the High Museum for the afternoon, which just happened to be having an exhibit of one of my all time favorite artists Romare Bearden.\n\nWe also took in several other rooms of the museum. This one in particular had Marilyn on her toes explaining to Nax the “what” and “why” of the paintings in the Mutiny on the Amistad exhiibit.\n\nAn interesting design of museum space, it was fun just being here, catching the tail end of a local high school jazz performance, viewing the various exhibitions and immersing in the energy of family day at the museum.\n\nOn Monday, everyone was off to work. Able to break away for the afternoon, Chelsea met up with us for a visit to the fabulous Atlanta Botanical Garden. We’ve been to many botanical gardens all over the States but this one really takes top billing. Linda works on the grounds here primarily in the beautiful children’s garden and we hoped to have another chance to chat with her before we left town.\n\nGorgeous grounds and exhibits, a true urban oasis, we were treated to a multitude of stunning visuals, including a special Halloween exhibit tucked in and around the landscape.\n\nOne of a multitude of Halloween inspired installations around the grounds.\n\nAnother outdoor exhibit was one dedicated to Alice in Wonderland. Truly spectacular we had the luck of seeing it just before it was being dismantled.\n\nIndoors at the Fuqua Conservatory, housing 5 separate exhibition spaces, we wandered through a maze of delights highlighting tropical and desert environments, including a fascinating amphibian exhibit with tropical frogs.\n\nWe walked the bridges and pathways of the vast garden grounds and got lucky to happen upon Linda on a short break. What a nice surprise!\n\nOn Monday night, it was relaxation time. After a bedtime story for Nax, all any of us needed to do was hang with family, drink some wine and confabulate.\n\nTommy and I weren’t the only guests staying at the Norman home that weekend. Marilyn and Brian were dog-sitting their friend’s dogs, Pfeiffer and June Bug, one of whom was not about to give up his end of the couch paradise for anyone.\n\nThe other dog, June Bug, who I nicknamed “Mud Pie” because he looked like he hadn’t had a bath in over a decade, preferred to be outside.\n\nWell, the long weekend and then some began to wind down with everyone back to work full swing. We stayed another day to have some work done on the van and then it was time to get on down the road and let this busy family get back to regular life.\n\nThanks Chelsea, Linda, Carmen and Marilyn, Brian, Nax and Maris for bringing us fully into the fold. Such precious time with family is unforgettable and so good for the soul!\n\nUntil we all meet again, be well, be happy and keep on living the sweet southern life!\n\n“Oh Atlanta, oh Atlanta!\n\nI said yeah! yeah! yeah! Atlanta!\n\nGot to get back to you.”\n\n~ Lowell George/Little Feat\n\nFlorida (Part 1): A Hedonistic Interlude with Friends in Punta Gorda\n\nOctober 5 -11, 2019: A major detour into the Sunshine State, swinging down the sub-tropical Gulf Coast, to meet up with our St. Louis friends in the sauna-like heat and humidity of Punta Gorda, to . . . party our butts off in style . . .\n\nFuzzy memories recollected by Tom:\n\nIn our sightseeing, bucket list journey across the States, we’ve packed in more fun and adventure than we can keep up with, at least when it comes to keeping up on our blog. While generally adhering to a semi-fixed itinerary, zigging here and zagging there, we’ve enjoyed wonderful visits with friends and family in Utah and Colorado, the Midwest, the East Coast, and down into D.C. and Virginia, and there was more on the docket. Our running (driving) joke got to be, “Oh, nooooo! Here comes Tom and Mary!”\n\nUpon departing our dear friends’ company in Charlottesville, we tacked south in a splendid detour to the resort area of Emerald Isle for a few days of rest and relaxation in a gorgeous vacation home courtesy of Mary’s friends, Sarah and Brian Fagan, and after that sweet but stultifying hot interlude (sans the Fagans, unfortunately), we figured we’d keep heading south, not knowing if we’d end up in Florida or the Yucatan Peninsula. We still had friends and family to visit in Atlanta, Nashville and Houston, and certainly had to somehow swing back up to Asheville, the Smokies and back down to New Orleans in some kind of crisscrossing big loop, but then, what about Florida? Well, the Florida dilemma conveniently resolved itself when our St. Louis / Lake of the Ozark friends, Michael and Sheila, followed through on their invitation to meet up with them in – say where? Punta Gorda is where.\n\nDuring our stay with them (July 2019) at their beautiful home on Sunrise Beach, Lake of the Ozarks, Sheila and Michael had told us about their trip to Florida planned for early October and – hey! – why not meet up there if we were going to be anywhere in the vicinity at that time. Since were we in Savannah, with a coin toss as to which way to head next, it seemed like the stars were aligning and our timing would be perfect to avail ourselves of their wonderful, kind, generous offer to spend time with them in an exotic locale. Because, after all, it’d only been like, what, 40 years since either of us had been to the Sunshine State. It was definitely time for a visit.\n\nSo with nothing pressing to do or magnets pulling us in another direction, at least for now, we figured, why not, let’s shoot down to Florida and hang out in a luxury pad for a few days with our good friends. From there, we could then seriously consider continuing our journey farther south hugging the gorgeous aquamarine waters and white sand beaches of the Gulf Coast, and – why not! – nothing stopping us! – we could then push on to the Keys, or if the bug were to bite us hard enough, figure out a way to cross the Gulf of Mexico and spend the winter kicked back on the mellow Caribbean beaches of the Mayan Riviera. (Now, that’s what retirement should be lookin’ like, eh!)\n\nAnd so we bid Savannah adieu and departed Georgia with a full tank of gas and a plan to someday return and spend more time when the weather was more amenable to being outdoors. Crossing the state line into Florida felt like we’d entered a different country. Wealthier, ritzier, and, from the look of things, big-time MAGA country. Trump bumper stickers adorning SUVs, and Confederate flags proudly flying, including a 100 ft. tall monstrosity greeting motorists along I-75 outside of Tampa (temporarily taken down on June 1, 2020). Nothing to do but keep driving, stay in the right (left?) lane, and be kind to everyone.\n\nWe were also struck by how horrendous and unskilled most motorists were – just downright rude sonsabitches for the most part! – barreling down the highway with reckless, self-absorbed urgency, creating traffic backups and veering in and out like maniacs liable to cut you off without notice. Let alone the massive parade of speeding big rigs balling jack and bearing down menacingly. Then you had a ridiculous number of vacationing mom and pops tooling along in their absurdly huge 8-cylinder pickups towing mega-sized trailers and RVs towing jeeps down straightaway stretches of freeway where, to keep from getting bullied, or run off the road, I had to drive as fast as all the other Floridians and out-of-staters. It was an unregulated free-for-all verging on total traffic anarchy on Florida’s Interstate Highway 75. I was surprised not to see a single wreck, and honestly, I don’t recall seeing a single police officer patrolling for these contemptible motorist scofflaws – speeders, texters, drinkers, distracted idiots on their phones, people making illegal lane changes, failing to use turn signals, etc. The prevailing rules of the road on Florida’s I-75: Be Rude and Drive Aggressively. Every Asshole For Himself. (Most definitely HIMs.) Seriously, the level of incivility and “get out of my way, asshole” style of road rage inducing driving was unlike anywhere I’d ever been while behind a steering wheel, including – and this is hard to beat – Massachusetts and Chicago!\n\nWell, phew! We made it safely past godforsaken Jacksonville – thought the sprawl was never going to end – and just when we thought we were cruising along, got badly hung up in a nightmarish jam on the outskirts of Gainesville, where we thought it might be nice break up the drive, check out the college town, and spend the night. But we couldn’t find a decent available hotel within our means, or, barring that luxury expense, a camping spot for the life of us, which was always and forever a difficult proposition, given our extreme dislike of mainstream camping and (misanthropically, I am loathe to admit) mainstream campers. So, despite being thoroughly trashed behind the wheel, I boned up and suggested driving another couple of hours to spend the night in a Best Western Plus, which turned out to be located forty minutes off the freeway in Leesburg, an old fart resort area in aptly named Lake County, for its surrounding complex of interconnecting lakes, which, of course, attracts all the big boaters, jet skiers and fishermen. Plenty of beauty but simply overrun with too many people engaged in activities geared for zero solitude and very little peace and quiet.\n\nAfter our respite for the night – just another $130 lodging tab is all – we arose early the next morning to partake of the BW+ complimentary continental breakfast (truly sucky food) before setting off on the final push to Punta Gorda, another three hours away. We made a quick stopover in Sarasota to buy some groceries at the deluxe Whole Foods; and what we saw of Sarasota was pretty much gigantic mall-land and bustling intersections and no sidewalks or pedestrians, but certainly there must be attractive areas, if only we’d had the time, and inclination, to check them out, and visit a cousin who lives there I haven’t seen in probably forty years. Anyway, that possible visit and swimming with the manatees and strolling the boardwalk would have to wait for the return trip, as we were due to meet our friends at noon or so.\n\nTraffic was horrible, maddening, as usual, with everybody in an anxious mental mush and super-rush to get their relaxing destinations, hell-bent and god-be-damned if they made it there safely or caused someone else to die in a wreck. We were delayed just long enough to miss the gang greeting us with hugs and high fives, which was fine because, frankly, we were bushed – psychically taxed from the driving, mostly! – and so Michael, Sheila and Julie had decided to go out boating without us. We made ourselves at home, and did what we do best under such circumstances: lounging around, relaxing in the air-conditioning with occasional forays out into the intense heat of the day for a quick dip in the cool pool, noshing, waiting for them to return so we could get down some real partying. Sheila called Mary at one point, offering to swing by and pick us up dockside in an hour, but we declined, as it was just too torpid for us to expose ourselves to the serious heat and humidity. Julie chimed in that there was a bottle of Prosecco waiting to be popped just for us in the fridge, so why go anywhere, right?\n\nThey eventually returned and one look at their wind-blown and sun-burned faces, and sagging body language (they got into a bit of a scrape out on the water), we were relieved we had declined to join in on the sailing tour. Unlike in our younger days, when we could go biking in 108 degree weather and deal with heat, sun, humidity, wind, and not be . . . I guess hot and bothered is a good way to put it . . . today we’re so much more careful, me in particular having suffered from a couple of bouts of severe heat stroke in recent years. But after a dip in the pool, showers, and acclimatizing to the air-conditioning, the merry gang all seemed none worse the wear, in good cheer, and broke out cold beers, the chilled wine, and the vape pipe. And so began Day One in Punta Gorda, and it pretty much didn’t let up for five days.\n\nThough we were forced to spend most of our time indoors, it provided a wonderful opportunity to re-connect with Michael and Sheila, and surprise! – Julie – who had also made the trip down. It was party-central, even though Michael and Sheila were ensnared in a landlord-renter conflict that was stressing them out quite a bit. Their tenant was this asshole guy renting their Punta Gorda investment home who was causing lots of trouble over nothing really, other than to give them a hard time over a broken air-conditioning unit a few weeks before and a downed wifi connection which they had remedied as soon as possible, and now here he was interfering with their agent trying to show the place to sell, and the jerk was threatening to refuse to vacate, all of which was mental energy-zapping, but at least it provided for lively, endless, strategizing about what to do conversation. All in all, our time together was special and we made the best of things despite the heat and humidity that prevented us from enjoying so many other activities . . . so Happy Hour and Happy Times prevailed!\n\nEvenings were more amenable to being out and about. We enjoyed a few nights on the town, listening to Boomer crooners and Jimmy Buffet style bands in bars and restaurants (banal but evoking nostalgic sentiment), and partaking of many languid Happy Hours, absorbed in conversation and enchanted by the beautiful scenery of the Peace River and Charlotte Harbor.\n\nWe kicked off our first night in Punta Gorda gulping down margaritas and Coronas at the rooftop bar of the luxury Wyvern Hotel where we were treated to great sunset views and priming us for the evening of fun with our friends. Later on, we landed for dinner and drinks on the patio of Dean’s South of the Border, a lively Mexican restaurant and cantina with live music – Live and Learn, an LA-area band busting out raucous versions of Stevie Ray Vaughan tunes.\n\nWe truly regretted how the weather prevented us from enjoying all of Punta Gorda’s activities and attractions. It would have been fun to go sailing and do a little cycling, take in a sunset cruise, and visit the wildlife estuary and mangrove wetlands exploring in a kayak the alluring maritime and coastal ecosystem supporting over 600 species of birds, fish and other wildlife. Oh, well, there’s always next time. Should we ever make it back to Punta Gorda.\n\nPunta Gorda’s motto – “Come for the weekend – stay for life” – is meant to attract people seeking a lower key lifestyle and more integrated community spirit from other more popular places on the Gulf Coast or elsewhere along Florida’s 8,436 miles of ocean shoreline and endless lakeshore frontage. And it’s true: a distinct laid-back vibe prevails in the small city of 17,000 souls, many of them retirees and on and off residents. Politics seemed to take back seat to hedonism. There was a touristy flavor to the scene, not too, too off-putting, but it certainly was a scene geared more toward the older, shall we say, Boomer crowd, than it was a young, hip scene.\n\nHad the humidity not been so suffocating, we might have enjoyed the city’s diverse array of things to see and do much more. That was our only regret for making the long ass drive from Savannah, and then, as it turned out, not heading farther south, but reversing direction back up to Georgia. But it was special enough just to be there with our friends, enjoying their company and camaraderie in a different sort of place from anywhere we’d yet been to in our criss-crossing of the States. Florida felt different, looked different, smelled and was different. It was a taste of the exotic we hoped to experience again.\n\nWe figured we’d save the Keys for later, and beeline straight up to Atlanta where Mary’s niece, Marilyn, and her lovely family, had an open invitation for us to stay a few days. It was now or . . . who knows when? So that’s what we did, jammed back up north, figuring we could always swing down to Mexico after completing a loop of the Southeast and Gulf Coast – all those places we’d missed since leaving Charlottesville for Emerald Isle and Savannah. It was a lot of backtracking, but we were carefree lucky souls, able to go wherever and do whatever we wanted to do, whenever . . . or so we thought. We couldn’t imagine when or where . . . or if . . . Florida (Part 2) would ever materialize. But it would, in good time.\n\nThanks so much to our friends Sheila and Michael for bringing us into the fold once again with such generosity and style! And to Julie for keeping us all in party spirit. Cheers!\n\nA Double Dip into the South\n\nLate September 2019: An unexpected trip to Emerald Isle, North Carolina; hot nights in Savannah, Georgia.\n\nEmerald Isle Idyll (as told by Mary):\n\n“Sing me a love song in a slow, southern drawl to the tune of sunny days . . . ” – Kellie Elmore, writer, 1967- Present\n\nAfter leaving the cozy nest of the Nolasco homestead in Charlottesville, Virginia (see our previous post), we pushed on a little deeper into the southern states. We would likely never have made a trip to Emerald Isle, North Carolina, but for the grace and generosity of Sarah and Brian Fagan. Out of the blue, while we were in DC I got a message from Sarah – who I knew as Sarah Mann growing up in St. Louis – saying she had been following our blog and asked if we would be interested in staying at her summer place in Emerald Isle!\n\nWe were thrilled with this gesture, though dismayed that it would not include a visit with Sarah and Brian, as the family, who reside in nearby New Bern, were on their way to Florida. But the southern hospitality of this fine lagniappe was astonishing and received with abundant gratitude! After a catching-up phone call with Sarah, we made our plan.\n\nI met Sarah in the 8th grade when my family moved across town thusly tossing me into a new school district and new junior high. She was one of the first girls I met in a crowd of tight-knit friends welcoming me quickly into the fold. Sarah, originally from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, was a southern belle at her core.\n\nI remember that even her family home resembled something more befitting of the south than St. Louis, Missouri, with its whitewashed pillars and grand lawns and long driveway, a home filled with a grandeur that spoke to something other than our beer and baseball town. A classic beauty, Sarah possessed a mischievous spunk and, while looking sweet as pie, innocent as rain and as pretty as a girl could ever hope to be with her blond locks, kind eyes and child-like grin, Sarah seemed always to be hatching up some antics to surprise and entertain us all.\n\nPulling into the circular driveway mid-day, we beamed at the beauty of their lovely summer home nested between the Atlantic Ocean and Bogue Sound, beckoning us to come inside and set a spell. On a mother of a hot and sticky humid day, we parked Homer and wandered over to the frog filled pond in the center of their front yard with its picture-perfect porch swing built-for-two under the respite of a huge shade tree. You could just feel it was a place where Sarah and Brian have had loads of fun with their beautiful family and friends.\n\nWe made our way up to the front deck and thankfully into the cool environs of the three story house. What a lovely place to hang our hats for a few days. Every creature comfort was at our disposal and the only thing missing were our friends Sarah and Brian. “Where are you guys!”\n\nThe Fagan’s summer home had all the markings of life well-lived with family. A sweet and comfortable interior for true R and R, big front and back decks, a sprawling backyard leading to a private boat dock on the Sound and a separate structure serving as a private “man cave” for Brian. He served 20 years in the Marine Corps as a marine helicopter pilot, retired in 2008 and is currently an instructor for the Osprey aircraft at the marine corps air station New River.\n\nBut we managed to have some good fun while we were there despite their absence. Though mid-days were hot and muggy, early morning rides along the Emerald Isle bike path were a great way to explore the island. The paved path runs 11 miles from the Indian Beach town limits all the way to The Point at Bogue Inlet with a variety of side paths leading to the beach. We ditched our bikes at one or two and took beautiful strolls along the beach both mornings and at sunset on more than one occasion. Or we would set out on our bikes or stroll the neighborhoods closer to the Sound behind the Fagan’s property. Upon return, a chilled white wine would be begging to be popped open, to be sure.\n\nShades of the Confederacy peek through an otherwise sunny disposition of a beach town of vacation rentals and summer getaways on streets with names like Plantation Drive and Mangrove Drive commingling with Lobster Lane, Pelican Court, Ebb Tide, Clam Digger and Outrigger Drives. Squeaky clean whitewashed multi-storied houses and pastel mansions set against the back drop of sparkling, blue waters of the Crystal Coast’s sandy white beaches whisper sweet poetry if you listen closely enough. This place instills a calmness, an invitation to laziness and easy livin’ – given the opportunity to be on the right side of history. And weather, for that matter. The town has been the destination of more than one hurricane to hit landfall as recent as August 2020.\n\nOne afternoon, as a diversion, we drove to Beaufort, a nearby town that Sarah suggested we check out. So we took the short drive cross the bridge spanning the Newport River and the Bogue Sound and spent a few hours strolling up and down the main drag – Front Street – lined with antebellum-style homes and many shops and restaurants. Before the day heated up to frying pan hot, we stro"
