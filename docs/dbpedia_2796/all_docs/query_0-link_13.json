        "text": "Georgia (en-us-Georgia.ogg /ˈdʒɔrdʒə/ (help·info)) is a state in the United States and was one of the original Thirteen Colonies that revolted against British rule in the American Revolution. It was the last of the Thirteen Colonies to be established, in 1733. It was the fourth state to ratify the United States Constitution, on January 2, 1788. It declared its secession from the Union on January 21, 1861 and was one of the original seven Confederate states. It was the last state to be restored to the Union, on July 15, 1870. Georgia is the ninth-largest state in the nation by population, with an estimated 9,685,744 residents as of July 1, 2008.[1] From 2007 to 2008, Georgia had 14 counties among the nation's 100 fastest-growing counties, second only to Texas.[2] Georgia is also known as the Peach State and the Empire State of the South. Atlanta is the capital, and the most populous city. Georgia is bordered on the south by Florida; on the east by the Atlantic Ocean and South Carolina; on the west by Alabama and by Florida in the extreme southwest; and on the north by Tennessee and North Carolina. The northern part of the state is in the Blue Ridge Mountains, a mountain range in the vast mountain system of the Appalachians. The central piedmont extends from the foothills to the fall line, where the rivers cascade down in elevation to the continental coastal plain of the southern part of the state. The highest point in Georgia is Brasstown Bald, 4,784 feet (1,458 m); the lowest point is sea level. With an area of 59,424 square miles (153,909 km²), Georgia is ranked 24th in size among the 50 U.S. states. Georgia is the largest state east of the Mississippi River in terms of land area, although it is the fourth largest (after Michigan, Florida, and Wisconsin) in total area, a term which includes expanses of water claimed as state territory.[3]\n\nGeography[]\n\nMain article: Geography of Georgia (U.S. state)\n\nTemplate:Morefootnotes\n\nBoundaries[]\n\nBeginning from the Atlantic Ocean, the state's eastern border with South Carolina runs up the Savannah River, northwest to its origin at the confluence of the Tugaloo and Seneca rivers. It then continues up the Tugaloo (originally Tugalo) and into the Michael River, its most significant tributary. These bounds were decided in the 1787 Treaty of Mexico, and tested in the U.S. Supreme Court in the two Georgia v. South Carolina cases in 1922 and 1989.\n\nThe border then takes a sharp turn around the tip of Rabun County, at latitude 35°N, though from this point it diverges slightly south (due to inaccuracies in the original survey). This originally was the Georgia and North Carolina border all the way back to the Mississippi River, until Tennessee was divided from North Carolina, and Alabama and Mississippi (the Yazoo Lands) were taken from Georgia.\n\nThe state's western border then departs in another straight line south-southeastward, at a point southwest of Chattanooga, to meet the westernmost point of the Chattahoochee River near West Point, Georgia. It continues down to the point where it ends at the Flint River (the confluence of the two forming Florida's Apalachicola River), and goes almost due east and very slightly south, in a straight line to the origin of the Saint Mary's River, which then forms the remainder of the boundary back to the ocean.\n\nIt should be noted that the water boundaries are still set to be the original thalweg of the rivers. Since then, several have been inundated by man made lakes, including the Apalachicola/Chattahoochee/Flint point now under Lake Seminole.\n\nGeorgia state legislators had claimed that the state's border with Tennessee had been erroneously placed one mile (1.6 km) further south than intended in an 1818 survey, and proposed that the border should be corrected. This would allow Georgia, in the midst of a significant drought, to access water from the Tennessee River.[4]\n\nGeology and terrain[]\n\nMain article: Geology of Georgia (U.S. state)\n\nEach region has its own pair of distinctive characteristics. For instance the Ridge and Valley, which lies in the northwest corner of the state, includes limestone, sandstone, shale and other sedimentary rocks, which have yielded construction-grade limestone, barite, ocher and small amounts of coal.\n\nFlora and fauna[]\n\nMain article: Ecology of Georgia (U.S. state)\n\nGeorgia has a diverse mix of flora and fauna. The State of Georgia has approximately 250 tree species and 58 protected plants. Georgia's native trees include red cedar, a variety of pines, oaks, maples, cypress, sweetgum and scaly-bark and white hickories, as well as many others. Palmettos and other subtropical flora are found in the southern and coastal regions. Yellow jasmine, and mountain laurel make up just a few of the flowering shrubs in the state.\n\nRegarding fauna, white-tailed (Virginia) deer can be found in nearly all counties. The mockingbird and brown thrasher are just two of the 160 bird species that can be found in the state. The eastern diamondback, copperhead, and cottonmouth as well as salamanders, frogs, alligators and toads are among 79 species of reptile and 63 amphibians that make Georgia their home. The most popular freshwater game fish are trout, bream, bass, and catfish, all but the last of which are produced in state hatcheries for restocking. Popular saltwater game fish include red drum, spotted seatrout, flounder, and tarpon, among many others. Porpoises, whales, shrimp, oysters, and blue crabs are found inshore and offshore of the Georgia coast.[5]\n\nClimate[]\n\nMain article: Climate of Georgia (U.S. state)\n\nThe majority of Georgia is primarily a humid subtropical climate tempered somewhat by occasional polar air masses in the winter. Hot and humid summers are typical, except at the highest elevations. The entire state, including the north Georgia mountains, receives moderate to heavy precipitation, which varies from 45 inches (1143 mm) in central Georgia[6] to approximately 75 inches (1905 mm) around the Northeast part of the state.[7] The degree to which the weather of a certain region of Georgia is subtropical depends not just on the latitude, but also on how close it is to the Atlantic Ocean or Gulf of Mexico and the elevation. This is especially true in the mountainous areas in the northern part of the state, which are further away from the ocean and can be up to 4500 feet (1350 m) or higher above sea level.\n\nThe areas near the Florida/Georgia border, extending from the entire Georgia coastline west to the Florida panhandle, experiences the most subtropical weather, similar to that of Florida: hot, humid summers with frequent afternoon thunderstorms and mild, somewhat drier winters. These areas experience snow much less frequently than other parts of Georgia. The Georgia Piedmont is somewhat cooler in winter than the coastal areas. The southern areas of the Piedmont may receive snow every other year, while areas close to the foothills get snow several times a year. This part of Georgia is especially vulnerable to ice storms. The mountains of Georgia have the coolest climate and most frequent snowfall in the state. Despite having moderate weather compared to many other states, Georgia has occasional extreme weather. The highest temperature ever recorded is 112 °F (44.4 °C),[8] while the lowest ever recorded is -17 °F (-27.2 °C).[9] Georgia is one of the leading states in occurrences of tornadoes, though they rarely are stronger than F0 and F1. A tornado hit downtown Atlanta on Friday, 14 March 2008 causing moderate to severe damage due to all the broken glass on the skyscrapers. The SEC basketball tournament and a few conventions were ongoing at the time of impact and some injuries occurred due to the amount of people downtown. As it is on the Atlantic coast, Georgia is also vulnerable to hurricanes, although direct hurricane strikes were rare during the twentieth century. However, historical evidence suggests that direct strikes are more common than realized. Georgia often is affected by hurricanes which strike the Florida panhandle, weaken over land, and bring strong tropical storm winds and heavy rain to the Georgia interior, as well as hurricanes that come close to the Georgia coastline, brushing the coast on their recurvature on the way up to hit The Carolinas.\n\nIn 2006 and 2007, however, Georgia had severe droughts. Temperatures over 100 degrees have been recorded.\n\nMonthly average daily high and low temperatures for major Georgia cities City Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Athens 51/11\n\n33/1 56/13\n\n35/2 65/18\n\n42/6 73/23\n\n49/9 80/27\n\n58/14 87/31\n\n65/18 90/32\n\n69/21 88/31\n\n68/20 82/28\n\n63/17 73/23\n\n51/11 63/17\n\n42/6 54/12\n\n35/2 Atlanta 52/11\n\n34/1 57/14\n\n36/2 65/18\n\n44/7 73/23\n\n50/10 80/27\n\n60/16 86/30\n\n67/19 89/32\n\n71/22 88/31\n\n70/21 82/28\n\n64/18 73/23\n\n53/12 63/17\n\n44/7 55/13\n\n36/2 Augusta 56/13\n\n33/1 61/16\n\n36/4 69/21\n\n42/6 77/25\n\n48/9 84/29\n\n57/14 90/32\n\n65/18 92/33\n\n70/21 90/32\n\n68/20 85/29\n\n62/17 76/24\n\n50/10 68/20\n\n41/5 59/15\n\n35/2 Columbus 57/14\n\n37/3 62/17\n\n39/4 69/21\n\n46/8 76/24\n\n52/11 83/28\n\n61/16 90/32\n\n69/21 92/33\n\n72/22 91/32\n\n72/22 86/30\n\n66/19 77/25\n\n54/12 68/20\n\n46/8 59/15\n\n39/4 Macon 57/14\n\n34/1 61/16\n\n37/3 68/20\n\n44/7 76/24\n\n50/10 83/28\n\n59/15 90/32\n\n67/19 92/33\n\n70/21 90/32\n\n70/21 85/29\n\n64/18 77/25\n\n51/11 68/20\n\n42/6 59/15\n\n36/2 Savannah 60/16\n\n38/3 64/18\n\n41/5 71/22\n\n48/9 78/26\n\n53/12 84/29\n\n61/16 90/32\n\n68/20 92/33\n\n72/22 90/32\n\n71/22 86/30\n\n67/19 78/26\n\n56/13 70/21\n\n47/8 63/17\n\n40/4 Temperatures are given in °F/°C format, with highs on top of lows.[10]\n\nProtected lands[]\n\nMain article: Protected areas of Georgia (U.S. state)\n\nGeorgia is home to 63 parks, 48 of which are state parks and 15 that are historic sites, and numerous state wildlife preserves, under the supervision of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources.[11] Other historic sites and parks are supervised by the National Park Service and include the Andersonville National Historic Site in Andersonville; Appalachian National Scenic Trail; Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area near Atlanta; Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park at Fort Oglethorpe; Cumberland Island National Seashore near Saint Marys; Fort Frederica National Monument on St. Simons Island; Fort Pulaski National Monument in Savannah; Jimmy Carter National Historic Site near Plains; Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park near Kennesaw; Martin Luther King Jr National Historic Site in Atlanta; Ocmulgee National Monument at Macon; Trail of Tears National Historic Trail.[12]\n\nHistory[]\n\nMain article: History of Georgia (U.S. state)\n\nTemplate:Morefootnotes\n\nEarly history[]\n\nThe local moundbuilder culture, described by Hernando de Soto in 1540, completely disappeared by 1560. Early on, in the course of European exploration of the area, a number of Spanish explorers visited the inland region of Georgia.\n\nThe conflict between Spain and England over control of Georgia began in earnest in about 1670, when the English founded the Carolina colony in present-day South Carolina. Nearly a century earlier, the Spanish of Spanish Florida had established the missionary provinces of Guale and Mocama on the coast and Sea Islands of present-day Georgia. After decades of fighting, the Carolinians and allied Indians permanently destroyed the Spanish mission system during the invasions of 1702 and 1704. After 1704, Spanish control was limited to St. Augustine and Pensacola, both in present-day Florida. The Florida peninsula was subjected to raids as far as the Florida Keys. The coast of Georgia was occupied by now British-allied Indians such as the Yamasee until the Yamasee War of 1715-1717, after which the region was depopulated, opening up the possibility of a new British colony. In 1724, it was first suggested the British colony there be called Province of Georgia in honor of King George II.\n\nBritish interest in establishing a colony below South Carolina came from varied sources. Spanish Florida was a threat to South Carolina and a haven for runaway slaves. The French in the 1720s established a fort near present-day Montgomery, Alabama, also a threat to British interests in the region. Traders from Charleston, South Carolina, had established trading posts as far west as the Ocmulgee River, near present-day Macon, Georgia. The British trading network kept the Creek Indians allied with them; the French move threatened to wrest these Indians' trade away from the British. These strategic interests made the British government interested in establishing a new colony that would reinforce the British influence in the border country that had been open to Spanish and French penetration.\n\nMeanwhile, many members of the British Parliament had become concerned about the plight of England's debtors. A parliamentary committee investigated and reported on conditions in Britain's debtor prisons. A group of philanthropists organized themselves to establish a colony where the \"worthy poor\" of England could reestablish themselves as productive citizens. This goal was seen as both philanthropic, helping these distressed people, and patriotic, simultaneously relieving Britain of the burden of the imprisoned debtors and augmenting Britain's vital mercantile empire by planting new, industrious subjects to strengthen her trade. This goal went unfulfilled as Georgia was ultimately not settled by debtors or convicts.\n\nIn 1732, a group of these philanthropists were granted a royal charter as the Trustees of the Province of Georgia. They carefully selected the first group of colonists to send to the new colony. On 12 February 1733, 113 settlers aboard the Anne landed at what was to become the city of Savannah. This day is now known as Georgia Day, which is not a public holiday but is observed in schools and by some local civic groups. James Edward Oglethorpe, one of the trustees of the colony, traveled with the first group of colonists, laid out the design of the town of Savannah, and acted as governor of the colony, although technically under the trustees there was no \"governor.\" Oglethorpe acted as the only trustee present in the colony. When he returned to Britain, a series of disputes ended his tenure governing the colony; Georgia was then led by a series of presidents named by the trustees.\n\nAt the time Georgia was founded in 1732, the number of non-English immigrants to the colonies was at an all time high. Although religious toleration was not valued in itself, the pragmatic need to attract settlers led to broad religious freedoms. South Carolina wanted German Lutherans, Scottish Presbyterians, Moravians, French Huguenots and Jews, whom they valued as a counter to the French and Spanish Catholic and absolutist presence to the south. When the Moravians turned out to be pacifists who refused to serve in the colonial defense, they were expelled in 1738. Catholics were denied the right to own property. Jewish immigrants fleeing the Spanish Inquisition, which was being carried out by the Spanish colonies in the New World, were allowed in after some debate, owing to the leadership of James Oglethorpe. In 1733, over forty Jews fleeing persecution arrived in Savannah, the largest such group to enter an American colony up to that time. Among them was Dr. Samuel Nunez, who was the first doctor in Georgia. He immediately showed his value as a citizen by playing an invaluable role in curbing an epidemic that had already killed scores of settlers, and was credited with saving the colony by General Oglethorpe.[13]\n\nIn 1752, after the government failed to renew subsidies that had helped support the colony, the Trustees turned over control to the crown. Georgia became a crown colony, with a governor appointed by the British king.[14] However, even after Georgia eventually became a royal colony (1752), there were so many dissenters (Protestants of minority denominations, that is, non-Anglican) that the establishment of the Church of England was successfully resisted until 1752. These dissenting churches were the mainstay of the Revolutionary movement, culminating in the War for Independence from Britain, through the patriotic and anti-authoritarian sermons of their ministers, and the use of the churches to organize rebellion. Whereas the Anglican Church tended to preach stability and loyalty to the Crown, other Protestant sects preached heavily from the Old Testament and emphasized freedom and equality of all men before God, as well as the moral responsibility to rebel against tyrants.[15]\n\nGeorgia was one of the thirteen colonies that revolted against British rule in the American Revolution by signing the 1776 Declaration of Independence, despite a large population of people loyal to the crown. Since Georgia was a relatively new colony at the time compared to the other twelve colonies, Georgia was not as active in the war. Also, the Georgian militia was not fully developed, which led to the capture of Savannah by British forces in December of 1778. American forces under the command of General Benjamin Lincoln combined with French forces under the command of Charles Henri Comte d’Estaing to lay siege to Savannah in 1779. The attempt was incredibly unsuccessful, and Savannah remained in British hands until the end of the war. During the war, nearly one-third of the slaves, more than 5,000 enslaved African Americans, exercised their desire for independence by escaping and joining British forces, where they were promised freedom. Some went to Great Britain or the Caribbean; others were resettled in Canada provinces.[16] Other estimates show an even greater impact from the war, when slaves escaped during the disruption. \"The sharp decline between 1770 and 1790 in the proportion of the population made up of blacks (almost all of whom were slaves) [went] from 45.2 percent to 36.1 percent in Georgia.\"[17]\n\nFollowing the war, Georgia became the fourth state of the United States of America after ratifying the United States Constitution on 2 January 1788. Georgia established its first state constitution in 1777. The state established new constitutions in 1788, 1799, 1861, 1865, 1868, 1877, 1945, 1976, and 1983, for a total of 10 — more constitutions than any other state, except for Louisiana, which has had 11.\n\nIn 1829, gold was discovered in the north Georgia mountains, resulting in the Georgia Gold Rush, the first gold rush in U.S. history. A Federal mint was established in Dahlonega, Georgia and continued to operate until 1861. An influx of white settlers pressured the U.S. government to take the land away from the Cherokee Indians. They owned land, operated their own government with a written constitution, and did not recognize the authority of the state of Georgia.\n\nThe dispute culminated in the Indian Removal Act of 1830, under which all eastern tribes were sent west to Indian reservations in present-day Oklahoma. In Worcester v. Georgia, the Supreme Court in 1832 ruled that states were not permitted to redraw the boundaries of Indian lands, but President Andrew Jackson and the state of Georgia ignored the ruling. In 1838, his successor, Martin van Buren dispatched federal troops to round up the Cherokee and deport them west of the Mississippi. This forced relocation, known as the Trail of Tears led to the death of over 4,000 Cherokees.\n\nConfederate history[]\n\nMain article: Georgia (U.S. state) in the American Civil War\n\nOn January 18, 1861, Georgia joined the Confederacy and became a major theater of the American Civil War. Major battles took place at Chickamauga, Kennesaw Mountain, and Atlanta. In December 1864, a large swath of the state from Atlanta to Savannah was destroyed during General William Tecumseh Sherman's March to the Sea. This event served as the historical background for the 1936 novel Gone with the Wind and the 1939 film of the same name. On July 15, 1870, following Reconstruction, Georgia became the last former Confederate state to be reseated in Congress and restored to the Union.\n\nCapitals[]\n\nGeorgia has had five official state capitals: colonial Savannah, which later alternated with Augusta; then for a decade at Louisville (pronounced Lewis-ville); and from 1806 through 1868, including during the American Civil War, at Milledgeville. In 1868, the capital was moved to the new city of Atlanta — one with a better access by railroad — and it became the fifth capital city of the state. It remains so to the present. The state legislature also met at some other temporary sites, including Macon, especially during the turmoil of the War.\n\nCities[]\n\nSee also: Georgia census statistical areas\n\nThe largest city, Atlanta, is located in north-central Georgia, atop a ridge southeast of the Chattahoochee River. The Atlanta metropolitan area has a population of 5,278,904 (2007 census estimate), though the city proper has around 519,000 people.\n\nThe state of Georgia has twenty metropolitan and micropolitan areas with populations above fifty-thousand. In descending order, they are Atlanta, Augusta, Savannah, Columbus, Macon, Athens, Gainesville, Albany, Dalton, Warner Robins, Valdosta, Brunswick, Rome, Hinesville, LaGrange, Statesboro, Dublin, Milledgeville, Waycross, and Calhoun.[18]\n\nTen largest cities[]\n\nAtlanta: 519,145 people\n\nAugusta: 195,182 people\n\nColumbus: 188,660 people\n\nSavannah: 130,300 people\n\nAthens: 111,580 people\n\nMacon: 97,606 people\n\nRoswell: 87,334 people\n\nSandy Springs: 85,771 people\n\nAlbany: 76,939 people\n\nJohns Creek: 62,049 people\n\nDemographics[]\n\nTemplate:USCensusPop In 2007, Georgia had an estimated population of 9,544,750 which was an increase of 180,809 from the previous year, and an increase of 1,177,125 since 2000. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 438,939 people (that is 849,414 births minus 410,475 deaths) and an increase from net migration of 606,673 people into the state. Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 228,415 people, and migration within the country produced a net increase of 378,258 people.\n\nIts population has grown 60.5% (2,885,725)Template:Dubious since 2000, making it one of the fastest-growing states in the country. Beginning with the 1990s, Georgia took over as the fastest-growing state in the South with a 63% population increase during the decade, surpassing its neighbor Florida, which had held the title for every decade in the 20th century prior to the 1990s. Three of Georgia's counties were among the 10 fastest growing counties from 2004 to 2005.[19] The center of population of Georgia is located in Butts County, in the city of Jackson.[20]\n\nRace, language, and age[]\n\nTemplate:US Demographics\n\nAccording to the U.S. census, Georgia's population is as follows: 66.55% White, 30.63% Black, 3.19% Asian American, 1.24% multiracial, 0.73% American Indian or Alaskan Native, and 0.15% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander.[21] Additionally, 7.76% are of Hispanic or Latino descent (of any race).[22]\n\nAs of 2005, 90% of Georgia residents age 5 and older speak only English at home and 5.6% speak Spanish. French is the third most spoken language at 0.9%, followed by German at 0.8% and Vietnamese at 0.6%. As of 2004, 7.7% of its population was reported as under 5 years of age, 26.4% under 18, and 9.6% were 65 or older. Also as of 2004, females made up approximately 50.6% of the population and African Americans made up approximately 29.6%.\n\nHistorically, about half of Georgia's population was composed of African Americans who, prior to the Civil War, were almost exclusively enslaved. The Great Migration of hundreds of thousands of blacks from the rural South to the industrial North from 1914-1970 reduced the African American population. This population has since increased, with some African Americans returning to the state for new job opportunities.[23] Today, African Americans remain the most populous race in many rural counties in middle, east-central, southwestern, and Low Country Georgia, as well as in the city of Atlanta and its southern suburbs. According to census estimates, Georgia ranks third among the states in terms of the percent of the total population that is African American (after Mississippi and Louisiana) and third in numerical Black population after New York and Florida. Georgia was the state with the largest numerical increase in the black population from 2006 to 2007 with 84,000.[24]\n\nGeorgia is the nation's third-fastest growing area for Asians, behind only Nevada and North Carolina. Asian buying power in the state was $8.1 billion this year, up from $1.1 billion in 1990, according to statistics from the University of Georgia's Selig Center for Economic Growth.[25]\n\nThe Hispanic population is also growing very rapidly. While Georgia's black population increased by 22 percent in the past seven years, its Hispanic population increased by 70 percent.[26]\n\nAt 41.5 percent minority, Georgia now ranks eighth in the nation in minorities as a percentage of the total population. At the same time, Georgia also placed third nationally in adding white residents, at 57,000.[26]\n\nGeorgia is the state with the third-lowest percentage of older people (65 or older), at 9.9 percent.[27]\n\nThe colonial settlement of large numbers of Scots-Irish Americans in the mountains and piedmont, and coastal settlement by English Americans and African Americans, have strongly influenced the state's culture in food, language and music.\n\nThe concentration of Africans imported to coastal areas in the 18th century repeatedly from rice growing regions of West Africa led to the development of Gullah-Geechee language and culture in the Low Country among African Americans. They share a unique heritage in which African traditions of food, religion and culture were continued more than in some other areas. In the creolization of Southern culture, their foodways became an integral part of all Southern cooking in the Low Country.[28]\n\nReligion[]\n\nLike most other Southern states, Georgia is largely Protestant Christian. The religious affiliations of the people of Georgia are as follows:[29]\n\nProtestant: 70%\n\nBaptist: 24%\n\nMethodist: 12%\n\nPresbyterian: 3%\n\nPentecostal: 3%\n\nCatholic: 12%\n\nOther: 3%\n\nNon-religious: 13%\n\nGeorgia shares its Protestant heritage with much of the Southeastern United States. However, the number of Catholics is growing in the state because of the influx of Northeasterners resettling in the Atlanta metro area, the large Hispanic immigration into the state, and the large amount of conversions to Catholicism including a number of Protestant (mainly southern baptist) pastors.\n\nThe largest denominations by number of adherents in 2000 were the Southern Baptist Convention with 1,719,484; the United Methodist Church with 570,674; and the Catholic Church with 374,185.[30]\n\nGeorgia's Jewish community dates to the settlement of 42 mostly Sephardic Portuguese Jews in Savannah in 1733. Atlanta also has a large and established Jewish community.\n\nEconomy[]\n\nTemplate:Morefootnotes\n\nGeorgia's 2007 total gross state product was $396 billion.[31] Its Per Capita personal income for 2007 puts it 37th in the nation at $33,499. If Georgia were a stand-alone country, it would be the 28th largest economy in the world.[32]\n\nThere are 15 Fortune 500 companies and 26 Fortune 1000 companies with headquarters in Georgia, including such names as Home Depot, UPS, Coca Cola, Delta Air Lines, AFLAC, Southern Company, and SunTrust Banks. Georgia has over 1,700 internationally headquartered facilities representing 43 countries, employing more than 112,000 Georgians with an estimated capital investment of $22.7 billion.\n\nAgriculture and industry[]\n\nGeorgia's agricultural outputs are poultry and eggs, pecans, peaches, peanuts, rye, cattle, hogs, dairy products, turfgrass, tobacco, and vegetables. Its industrial outputs are textiles and apparel, transportation equipment, cigarettes, food processing, paper products, chemical products, electric equipment. Tourism also makes an important contribution to the economy. Georgia is home to the Granite Capital of the World (Elberton). Atlanta has been the site of enormous growth in real estate, service, and communications industries.\n\nAtlanta has a very large effect on the state of Georgia and the Southeastern United States. The city is an ever growing addition to communications, industry, transportation, tourism, and government.\n\nFood is also a major industry in Georgia, with widespread farms producing peanuts, corn, and soybeans across middle and south Georgia. The state is the number one producer of pecans in the world, with the region around Albany in southwest Georgia being the center of Georgia's pecan production. Gainesville in northeast Georgia touts itself as the Poultry Capital of the World.\n\nIndustry in Georgia is quite diverse. Major products in the mineral and timber industry include a variety of pines, clays, stones, and sands. The clay palygorskite, known as attapulgite, was named because of its abundance near the Decatur County town of Attapulgus in the deep southwest corner of the state. Attapulgite has numerous medical, cosmetic, and industrial uses. Textile industry is located around the cities of Rome, Columbus, Augusta, Macon and along the I-75 corridor between Atlanta and Chattanooga, TN to include the towns of Cartersville, Calhoun, Ringgold, and Dalton—the Carpet Capital of the World.\n\nWith its great population base and location along major transportation routes, Atlanta is a leading center of tourism, transportation, communications, government, and industry. Some industries there include automobile and aircraft manufacturing, food and chemical processing, printing, publishing, and large corporations. Some of the corporations headquartered in Atlanta are: Arby's, Chick-fil-A, The Coca-Cola Company, Georgia Pacific, Hooters, ING Americas, Cox, and Delta Air Lines. Major corporations in other parts of the state include: Aflac, CareSouth, Home Depot, Newell Rubbermaid, Primerica Financial Services, United Parcel Service, Waffle House and Zaxby's.\n\nSeveral United States military installations are located in Georgia including Fort Stewart, Hunter Army Airfield, Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, Fort Benning, Moody Air Force Base, Robins Air Force Base, Naval Air Station Atlanta, Fort McPherson, Fort Gillem, Fort Gordon, Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany Dobbins Air Reserve Base, Coast Guard Air Station Savannah and Coast Guard Station Brunswick. However, due to the latest round of BRAC cuts, Forts Gillem and McPherson will be closing and NAS Atlanta will be transferred to the Georgia National Guard.\n\nEnergy use and production[]\n\nGeorgia's electricity generation and consumption are among the highest in the United States, with coal being the primary electrical generation of fuel. However, the state also has two nuclear power plants which contribute less than one fourth of Georgia's electricity generation. The statistics are 75% coal, 16% nuclear, 7% oil and natural gas, and 1% hydroelectric/other. The leading area of energy consumption is the industrial sector because Georgia \"is a leader in the energy-intensive wood and paper products industry\".[33]\n\nState taxes[]\n\nGeorgia's personal income tax ranges from 1% to 7% within six tax brackets. There is a 4% state sales tax,[34] which is not applied to prescription drugs, certain medical devices, and groceries. Each county may add up to a 2% SPLOST. Counties participating in MARTA have another 1%; MARTA is the only major metropolitan rapid transit authority in the U.S. not to receive state funding. The city of Atlanta (in two counties, roughly 90% in Fulton and 10% in Dekalb) has the only city sales tax (1%, total 8%) for fixing its aging sewers. Local taxes are almost always charged on groceries but never prescriptions. Up to 1% of a SPLOST can go to homestead exemptions (the HOST). All taxes are collected by the Georgia Department of Revenue and then properly distributed according to any agreements that each county has with its cities.\n\nCulture[]\n\nMain article: Culture of Georgia (U.S. state)\n\nFine and performing arts[]\n\nGeorgia's major fine art museums include the Georgia Museum of Art, the High Museum of Art, the Michael C. Carlos Museum, the Morris Museum of Art, the Booth Western Art Museum and the Oglethorpe University Museum of Art.[35] The Atlanta Opera is a full time company that brings opera to Georgia stages.[36] The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra is the most widely recognized orchestra and largest arts organization in the southeastern United States.[37] Moreover, almost all of the universities, colleges, and junior colleges in Atlanta provide some musical instruction.[38] Georgia is also home to many \"underground\"Template:Clarifyme art galleries which also serve as performance venues catering to the more unconventional art crowd. One of the most well known and longest running is the Eyedrum Gallery in Atlanta, a large non-profit art and performance space run by volunteers.[citation needed]\n\nLiterature[]\n\nGeorgia literature is distinct among the literature of other places in the world in its historical and geographical context and the values it imparts. Dramas such as the play (on which a successful movie was also based) Driving Miss Daisy are one example of Georgia's literary culture. The most popular and famous novel has probably been Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind, also the basis of a wildly successful movie. Other authors who challenged popular ideas were Carson McCullers and Flannery O'Connor. Contemporary authors such as Alice Walker have also used Georgia's complex past as subjects for fiction, as in her The Color Purple.\n\nGeorgia's poets, such as James Dickey and Sidney Lanier, and nonfiction writers like humorist Lewis Grizzard also have a place in the state's literary life.[39]\n\nEntertainment[]\n\nMusic[]\n\nMain article: Music of Georgia (U.S. state)\n\nMusic in Georgia ranges from folk music to rhythm and blues, rock and roll, country music and hip hop. The Georgia Music Hall of Fame, located in Macon, is the state's museum of music. Georgia's folk musical traditions include important contributions to the Piedmont blues, shape note singing and African American music. The Sacred Harp, compiled and produced by Georgians Benjamin Franklin White and Elisha J. King, was published in 1844. The Sacred Harp system use notes expressed with shapes to make it easy for people to learn to sight-read music and performed complex pieces without a lot of training.[40]\n\nThe city of Athens, Georgia, home to the University of Georgia has been a fertile field for rock bands since the late 1970s. Notable bands from Athens include R.E.M.,[41] The Black Crowes, The B-52's, Widespread Panic, Drive-By Truckers, as well as bands from the Elephant 6 Recording Company most notably Neutral Milk Hotel.\n\nRock bands such as Norma Jean, The Chariot, Collective Soul, September Hase, With Blood Comes Cleansing, The Knife Trade, and Mastodon all hail from Georgia.\n\nRhythm and Blues is another important musical genre in Georgia. Ray Charles was born in Albany, Georgia. Augusta native James Brown and Macon native Little Richard, two important figures in R&B history, started performing in Georgia clubs on the chitlin' circuit, fused gospel music with blues and boogie-woogie to lay the foundations for R&B and soul music, and rank among the most iconic musicians of the 20th century. In the 1960s, Atlanta native Gladys Knight proved one of the most popular Motown recording artists, while Otis Redding, born in the small town of Dawson but raised in Macon, defined the grittier Southern soul sound of Memphis-based Stax Records.[42] Opera singer Jessye Norman is native to Augusta.[43]\n\nAtlanta has become a central player in hip hop as the home of artists Outkast. Ludacris, T.I., Pastor Troy, Gucci Mane, Keri Hilson, and Young Jeezy and producers Jermaine Dupri and Jazzy Pha. Atlanta is also home to multiple R&B and neo soul artists including India Arie, Ciara, Bobby Brown, Keyshia Cole, and Usher.\n\nFilm[]\n\nHundreds of feature films have been located in Georgia. By 2007 more than $4 billion had been generated for the state's economy by the film and television industry since the 1970s.[44] Such films include Deliverance; Smokey and the Bandit; Diary of a Mad Black Woman; Forrest Gump; Driving Miss Daisy and Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, with settings ranging from Appalachia to the manicured squares of Savannah.[44] Due to the success of Deliverance, as governor Jimmy Carter established a state film commission, now known as the Georgia Film, Video and Music Office, in 1973 to market Georgia as a shooting location for future projects. The commission had recruited more than 550 major projects to the state by 2007.[44] Actress Julia Roberts is one of the most well-known natives of Georgia. Additionally, the first African American owned and operated film studio was opened in Atlanta on October 4, 2008 by Tyler Perry.\n\nPopular culture[]\n\nStereotypical Georgian traits include manners known as \"Southern hospitality\", a strong sense of community and shared culture, and a distinctive Southern dialect. Georgia's Southern heritage makes turkey and dressing a traditional holiday dish during both Thanksgiving and Christmas. Movies like Gone with the Wind and the book If I Ever Get Back to Georgia, I'm Gonna Nail My Feet to the Ground by Lewis Grizzard highlight Georgia culture, speech and mannerisms.\n\nGirl Scouting in the United States of America began on March 12, 1912 when Juliette \"Daisy\" Gordon Low organized the first Girl Scout troop meeting of 18 girls in Savannah, Georgia.\n\nHealth care and education[]\n\nHealth care[]\n\nSee also: List of hospitals in Georgia (U.S. state)\n\nGeorgians can find medical and dental care \"via 151 general hospitals, more than 15,000 doctors and nearly 6,000 dentists.\"[45] The state is ranked forty-first in the percentage of residents who engage in regular exercise.[46]\n\nEducation[]\n\nSee also: List of colleges and universities in Georgia (U.S. state), List of schools in Georgia (U.S. state), and List of school districts in Georgia (U.S. state)\n\nGeorgia high schools (grades nine through twelve) are required to administer a standardized, multiple-choice End of Course Test, or EOCT, in each of eight core subjects including Algebra I, Geometry, U.S. History, Economics, Biology, Physical Science, Ninth Grade Literature and Composition, and American Literature and Composition. The official purpose of the tests is to assess \"specific content knowledge and skills.\" Although a minimum test score is not required for the student to receive credit in the course, completion of the test is mandatory. The EOCT score comprises 15% of a student's grade in the course.[47]\n\nHigh school students must also receive passing scores on four Georgia High School Graduation Tests (GHSGT) and the Georgia High School Writing Assessment in order to receive a diploma. Subjects assessed include Mathematics, Science, Language Arts, and Social Studies. These tests are initially offered during students' eleventh-grade year, allowing for multiple opportunities to pass the tests before graduation at the end of twelfth grade.[48]\n\nGeorgia is home to almost 70 public colleges, universities, and technical colleges in addition to over 45 private institutes of higher learning.\n\nThe HOPE Scholarship, funded by the state lottery, is available to all Georgia residents who have graduated from high school with a 3.0 or higher grade point average and who attend a public college or university in the state. The scholarship covers the cost of tuition and provides a stipend for books for up to 120 credit hours. If the student does not maintain a 3.0 average while in college they may lose the scholarship in which case they will have the chance to get it back by bringing their grade point average above a 3.0 within a period of 30 credit hours. This scholarship has had a significant impact on the state university system, increasing competition for admission and increasing the quality of education.\n\nTransportation[]\n\nMain article: Transportation in Georgia (U.S. state)\n\nTransportation in Georgia is overseen by the Georgia Department of Transportation, a part of the executive branch of the state government. Georgia's major Interstate Highways are I-75 and I-85. On March 18, 1998, the Georgia House of Representatives passed a resolution naming the portion of Interstate Highway 75, which runs from the Chattahoochee River northward to the Tennessee state line the Larry McDonald Memorial Highway. Larry McDonald, a Democratic member of the House of Representatives, had been on Korean Air Lines Flight 007 when it was shot down by the Soviets on Sept. 1, 1983.\n\n[edit] Other important interstate highways are I-95, I-20, I-16, I-59 and I-24. I-285 is Atlanta, Georgia's perimeter route and I-575 connects with counties in north Georgia on I-75.[49] Major freight railroads in Georgia include CSX and Norfolk Southern. Passenger service in Georgia is available on two Amtrak routes: the Crescent, which runs from New York to Washington, D.C., through north Georgia and Atlanta to New Orleans and the other runs from New York to the Georgia coast and from there to Florida.[50]\n\nInterstate highways[]\n\nFile:I-16.svgInterstate 16, File:I-516.svgInterstate 516\n\nFile:I-20.svgInterstate 20, File:I-520.svgInterstate 520\n\nFile:I-59.svgInterstate 59 (three exits only), File:I-24.svgInterstate 24\n\nFile:I-75.svgInterstate 75, File:I-475.svgInterstate 475,\n\nFile:I-575.svgInterstate 575, File:I-675.svgInterstate 675\n\nFile:I-85.svgInterstate 85, File:I-185.svgInterstate 185, File:I-985.svgInterstate 985\n\nFile:I-95.svgInterstate 95\n\nFile:I-285.svgInterstate 285 (the perimeter around Atlanta)\n\nFile:I-3.svgInterstate 3 (proposed)\n\nFile:I-14.svgInterstate 14 (proposed)\n\nUnited States highways[]\n\nNorth-south routesEast-west routes\n\nFile:US 1.svg U.S. Route 1\n\nFile:US 301.svg U.S. Route 301\n\nFile:US 11.svg U.S. Route 11\n\nFile:US 411.svg U.S. Route 411\n\nFile:US 17.svg U.S. Route 17\n\nFile:US 19.svg U.S. Route 19\n\nFile:US 319.svg U.S. Route 319\n\nFile:US 221.svg U.S. Route 221\n\nFile:US 23.svg U.S. Route 23\n\nFile:US 123.svg U.S. Route 123\n\nFile:US 25.svg U.S. Route 25\n\nFile:US 27.svg U.S. Route 27\n\nFile:US 29.svg U.S. Route 29\n\nFile:US 129.svg U.S. Route 129\n\nFile:US 41.svg U.S. Route 41\n\nFile:US 341.svg U.S. Route 341\n\nFile:US 441.svg U.S. Route 441\n\nFile:US 76.svg U.S. Route 76\n\nFile:US 78.svg U.S. Route 78\n\nFile:US 278.svg U.S. Route 278\n\nFile:US 378.svg U.S. Route 378\n\nFile:US 80.svg U.S. Route 80\n\nFile:US 280.svg U.S. Route 280\n\nFile:US 82.svg U.S. Route 82\n\nFile:US 84.svg U.S. Route 84\n\nAirports[]\n\nGeorgia's principal airport is Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL), the world's busiest passenger airport.[51] Georgia has 107 public-use airports, 9 of which are commercial-aviation airports and 98 which are general-aviation airports. Two of the state's important airports are Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport, which serves over 1,700,000 passengers each year and DeKalb Peachtree Airport in Chamblee, Georgia.[52]\n\nLaw and Government[]\n\nMain article: Government of Georgia (U.S. state)\n\nState government[]\n\nThe capital of Georgia is Atlanta. As with all other U.S. States and the federal government, Georgia's government is based on the separation of legislative, executive and judicial power.[53] Executive authority in the state rests with the governor, currently Sonny Perdue (until 2011) (Republican). Perdue is the first Republican governor since Reconstruction.[54] (See List of governors of Georgia). Both the governor and lieutenant governor are elected on separate ballots to four-year terms of office. Unlike the federal government, but like many other U.S. States, most of the executive officials who comprise the governor's cabinet are elected by the citizens of Georgia rather than appointed by the governor.\n\nLegislative authority resides in the General Assembly, composed of the Senate and House of Representatives. The Lieutenant Governor presides over the Senate, while the House of Representatives selects their own Speaker. The Georgia Constitution mandates a maximum of 56 senators, elected from single-member districts, and a minimum of 180 representatives, apportioned among representative districts (which sometimes results in more than one representative per district); there are currently 56 senators and 180 representatives. The term of office for senators and representatives is two years.[55]\n\nState judicial authority rests with the state Supreme Court and Court of Appeals, which have statewide authority.[56] In addition, there are smaller courts which have more limited geographical jurisdiction, including State Courts, Superior Courts, Magistrate Courts and Probate Courts. Justices of the Supreme Court and judges of the Court of Appeals are elected statewide by the citizens in non-partisan elections to six-year terms. Judges for the smaller courts are elected by the state's citizens who live within that court's jurisdiction to four-year terms.\n\nSee also: List of governors of Georgia and Georgia elected officials\n\nLocal government[]\n\nGeorgia has 159 counties, the most of any state except Texas (with 254).[57] Before 1932, there were 161, with Milton and Campbell being merged into Fulton at the end of 1931. Counties have been named for prominent figures in both American and Georgian history, but many bear names with Native American origin. Counties in Georgia have their own elected legislative branch, usually called the Board of Commissioners, which usually also has executive authority in the county.[58] Several counties have a Sole Commissioner government, with legislative and executive authority vested in a single person. Georgia is the only state with Sole Commissioner counties. Georgia's Constitution provides all counties and cities with \"home rule\" authority, and so the county commissions have considerable power to pass legislation within their county as a municipality would.\n\nFurther information: list of Georgia counties\n\nBesides the counties, Georgia only defines cities as local units of government. Every incorporated town, no matter how small, is legally a city. Georgia does not provide for townships or independent cities (though there is a movement in the Legislature to provide for townships) but does allow consolidated city-county governments by local referendum. So far, only Columbus, Augusta, Athens, and Cusseta have done this. Conyers is studying possibly becoming consolidated with Rockdale County. Recently, Savannah has consolidated its police department with the county police department and is currently studying possible consolidation with Chatham County.\n\nThere is no true metropolitan government in Georgia, though the Atlanta Regional Commission and Georgia Regional Transportation Authority do provide some services, and the ARC must approve all major land development projects in metro Atlanta.\n\nPolitics[]\n\nPresidential elections results Year Republican Democratic 2008 52.20% 2,048,744 47.00% 1,844,137 2004 57.97% 1,914,254 41.37% 1,366,149 2000 54.67% 1,419,720 42.98% 1,116,230 1996 47.01% 1,080,843 45.84% 1,053,849 1992 42.88% 995,252 43.47% 1,008,966 1988 59.75% 1,081,331 39.50% 714,792 1984 60.17% 1,068,722 39.79% 706,628 1980 40.95% 654,168 55.76% 890,733 1976 32.96% 483,743 66.74% 979,409 1972 75.04% 881,496 24.65% 289,529 1968* 30.40% 380,111 26.75% 334,440 1964 54.12% 616,584 41.15% 522,557 1960 37.43% 274,472 62.54% 458,638 *State won by George Wallace\n\nof the American Independent Party,\n\nat 42.83%, or 535,550 votes\n\nUntil recently, Georgia's state government had the longest unbroken record of single-party dominance, by the Democratic Party, of any state in the Union. This record was established partly by disfranchisement of most blacks and many poor whites in the early 20th century, lasting into the 1960s.\n\nAfter Reconstruction, white Democrats regained power, especially by legal disfranchisement of most African Americans and many poor whites through erection of barriers to voter registration. In 1900, shortly before Georgia adopted a disfranchising constitutional amendment in 1908, blacks comprised 47% of the state's population.[59] A \"clean\" franchise was linked by Progressives to electoral reform.[60] White, one-party rule was solidified. To escape the oppression, tens of thousands of black Georgians left the state, going north in the Great Migration for jobs, better education for their children and the chance to vote.\n\nFor over 130 years, from 1872 to 2003, Georgians only elected white Democratic governors, and white Democrats held the majority of seats in the General Assembly. Most of the Democrats elected throughout these years were Southern Democrats or Dixiecrats who were very conservative by national standards. This continued after the segregationist period, which ended legally in the 1960s. According to the 1960 census, the proportion of Georgia's population that was African American had decreased to 28%.[61] After civil rights legislation under President Johnson secured voting and civil rights in the mid-1960s, most African Americans in the South joined the Democratic Party.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, Georgia made significant changes in civil rights, governance, and economic growth focused on Atlanta. It was a bedrock of the emerging \"New South.\" This characterization was solidified with the election of former Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter in 1976 to the U.S. Presidency.\n\nThe political dominance of Democrats ended in 2003, when then-Governor Roy Barnes was defeated by Republican Sonny Perdue, a state legislator and former Democrat himself. It was regarded as a stunning upset. While Democrats retained control of the State House, they lost their majority in the Senate when four Democrats switched parties. They lost the House in the 2004 election. Republicans now control all three partisan elements of the state government.\n\nIn recent years, many conservative Democrats, including former U.S. Senator and governor Zell Miller, have decided to support Republicans. The state's socially conservative bent results in wide support for such measures as restrictions on abortion. Even before 2003, the state had become increasingly supportive of Republicans in Presidential elections. It has supported a Democrat for president only three times since 1960. In 1976 and 1980, native son Jimmy Carter carried the state; in 1992, the former Arkansas governor Bill Clinton narrowly won the state. Generally, Republicans are strongest in the predominantly white suburban (especially the Atlanta suburbs) and rural portions of the state.[62] Many of these areas were represented by conservative Democrats in the state legislature well into the 21st century. Democrats do best in the areas where black voters are most numerous,[62] mostly in the cities (especially Atlanta) and the rural Black Belt region that travels through the central and southwestern portion of the state.\n\nAs of the 2001 reapportionment, the state has 13 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, which are currently held by 7 Republicans and 6 Democrats.\n\nIn recent events, Democrat Jim Martin ran against incumbent Republican Senator Saxby Chambliss. Chambliss failed to acquire the necessary 50 percent of votes, a Libertarian Party candidate receiving the remainder of votes.
