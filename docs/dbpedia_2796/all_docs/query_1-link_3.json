Students will need access to a laptop with a camera or a webcam to complete their proctored event(s) via Respondus Monitor. Students must have a photo ID when using Respondus Monitor as well as when coming to campus to take a proctored event with their instructor. Instructors will provide details regarding the proctored event(s) in their courses. Students in online classes who do not complete the proctored event(s) will receive an “F” for the course. Respondus Monitor instructions can be found on the college’s website as well as from the instructors. If an exam is flagged by Respondus Monitor due to suspicious activity, the student may be asked to come to campus to take the exam. Please see the Respondus Monitor Test Guidelines for specific instructions on the use of Respondus Monitor.\n\nVisit Online/Distance Education and click Respondus Instructions or access them from the Resource Instructions section on the myOFTC Dashboard.\n\nIf you need assistance, please contact:\n\nOFTC’s Distance Education Office:\n\ndisted@oftc.edu or 478-274-7648, (478) 240-5171\n\nEach student is assigned a college e-mail account except YDC students. OFTC e-mail is one of the official means of communication with students. Therefore, students should check their e-mail accounts regularly. Students taking OFTC online courses must use their OFTC assigned e-mail account. Student accounts are only deleted after a student has not registered for classes for two consecutive terms AND has not logged into their account in the past 30 days.\n\nVisit myOFTC Dashboard and click the myOFTC Dashboard Login button.\n\nIf you need assistance, please contact:\n\nOFTC’s Information Technology Department:\n\nitshelp@oftc.edu or 478-274-7873"
