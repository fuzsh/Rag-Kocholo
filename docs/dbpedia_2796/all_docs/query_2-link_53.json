        "text": "Radiology technologists (aka radiologic technologists or rad techs) are essential to making proper and sometimes life-saving diagnoses. Working alongside radiologists and other medical professionals, radiology techs use X-ray and computed tomography (CT) imaging to examine patients and create crucial diagnostic images. Their expertise is invaluable to the healthcare field and they need a high-quality education to prepare them for this essential role.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, radiologic technologists earn a median salary of $73,410 as of May 2023. The top 10% of professionals in the field earned a reported $102,380. Additionally, the BLS expects that radiology techs will experience a growth rate of 6% which is faster than the average for all occupations.\n\nHopeful professionals can conveniently earn their degree from an accredited radiology tech program online. Online programs give students the freedom to study where and when they want while giving them the in-person experience they need to enter the field. Programs typically take two years and culminating in the ARRT exam.

While individuals just starting out on a professional career path often pick the associate or bachelor’s degree to get their foot in the door, those who have worked in the field for several years and want to climb the career ladder may decide to pursue a master’s degree. Consider which fits your current needs best as you read about each below.\n\nAccreditation & Licensing for Radiologic Technologists\n\nAttending an accredited school represents an important step in the journey to becoming a radiology tech, as individuals who don’t may find it challenging to transfer credits, compete against other job candidates who attended an accredited school, and, if necessary, receive licensure. Learners should look for institutional and programmatic accreditation. In the former, regional and national accreditation exists, with regional considered the more rigorous option. Students should also seek out programmatic accreditation, which is reviewed below.\n\nSpecializing as a Rad Tech\n\nIn addition to valuable skills and knowledge gained from a general radiography technology degree, the field also provides the opportunity for individuals with specific interests to concentrate their knowledge in a subfield.
