        "text": "Competitive Selection Process\n\nFollowing the successful completion (a grade of “C” or better) of all designated courses and additional curriculum/other requirements, students will enter into a competitive process for determining eligibility to progress into occupational program courses. The formula used for the competitive process is:\n\nTotal score = (GPA/4.0 x 50%) + (TEAS/100 x 50%) + Bonus Points\n\nThe GPA is calculated using grades earned in the designated courses and additional curriculum. ALHS, biology, physiology, physics, and chemistry courses must have been completed within the past five (5) calendar years (January - December) and if courses have been repeated, the last two grades within the previous five (5) calendar years will be used in the GPA calculation. If the student has been continuously enrolled at OFTC, the five-year period will not apply. The highest attempt of other designated classes will be used in the GPA calculation. The Registrar will calculate GPAs for all students. The GPA must be 3.0 or higher to be considered for the program.\n\nThe Test of Essential Academic Skills (TEAS) is a requirement for competition into the Practical Nursing, Radiologic Technology, Diagnostic Medical Sonography, and Associate Degree of Nursing Bridge, and Associate of Science in Nursing Programs. Candidates for TEAS testing must show a valid photo ID (driver’s license or other government-issued ID) immediately prior to testing. The highest overall score will be used in the competitive process. The TEAS must be taken within the two-year period prior to the competitive application deadline for the scores to be considered for admission purposes. A minimum required score of 59.5 (for practical nursing) or 65 (for ADN Bridge, ASN, Radiologic Technology, and Diagnostic Medical Sonography) must be attained for a student to be eligible to compete. The TEAS test must be taken face-fo-face at either OFTC's Testing Center or another PSI-approved testing center. No virtual (online) testing scores will be accepted.\n\nBonus Points - With the exception of the ADN Bridge competition, bonus points may be earned through documented, program-specific, paid work experience. One (1) bonus point for every year of experience will be awarded with a maximum of three (3) bonus points for consecutive work experience. Only work experience from the past five years will be considered for bonus points.\n\nThree (3) bonus points will be awarded in Practical Nursing competition for applicants who graduated the Health Care Assistant Technical Certificate of Credit at OFTC.\n\nThree (3) bonus points will be awarded in ADN Bridge competition for applicants who graduated the Practical Nursing or Paramedicine program at OFTC.\n\nAll students’ total scores will be ranked from the highest to the lowest. Students with the highest total scores, a GPA of at least 3.0 and the minimum required testing score on TEAS will be accepted. The total number of students accepted is based on the number of available openings. If all seats are not filled through competitive requirements, consideration may be given to students who did not make the required GPA or testing cut scores based on the number of available seats.\n\nRe-entry or Transfer Students - Students who have been unsuccessful or have withdrawn from an allied health program at HGTC, STC, OFTC, or another TCSG college and desire to re-enroll must compete for re-entry. Transfer students must submit all transcripts by the specified application deadline to compete for admission.\n\nRe-entry to First Semester - Students who wish to re-enroll in the first semester of a program must follow the same guidelines listed above. TEAS exam scores already on file in the Admissions Office will be used in calculating the total score using the formula above as long as the former TEAS test was taken within the two-year period prior to the competitive application deadline. Students will have to resubmit the competitive application and work verification forms. Students in programs that previously did not require TEAS scores must take the exam to be considered for re-entry into a program.\n\nRe-entry to Other Semesters - All students applying for re-entry into other semesters must first meet OFTC’s first-term entry requirements. If ALHS, biology, chemistry, and physics courses have been repeated, the last two grades within the previous five (5) years will be used in the GPA calculation. The highest attempt of other designated classes will be used in the GPA calculation. Students’ GPAs will be ranked from the highest to the lowest based on the competitive process. Students with the highest ranking will be accepted, up to the maximum of available openings. This option is only available if vacant slots exist in the advanced program cohort for the semester student needs to re-enter.\n\nAssociate Degree In Nursing Bridge - Students wishing to transfer into the Associate Degree in Nursing Bridge program must compete and, if selected, will be placed in the first semester RNSG courses. There are no advanced placement slots for transfer into the ADN Bridge program.\n\nDiagnostic Medical Sonography – Students returning or transferring in to the Diagnostic Medical Sonography program must attend scanning labs the semester before re-entry. Specific requirements and deadlines for lab and clinical competencies as well as clinical onboarding must be met before the re-entry term begins. See the program advisor three weeks into the term prior to your re-entry term to receive the detailed Advanced Placement Re-Entry Requirements for the Diagnostic Medical Sonography program. Any student unsuccessful in meeting all re-entry requirements by the prescribed deadline will not be allowed to attend clinical rotations and, therefore, will be withdrawn from the program.\n\nPractical Nursing – To complete the 50% residency requirements for graduation, PNSG 2010 (Introduction to Pharmacology and Clinical Calculations) and PNSG 2030 (Nursing Fundamentals) are the only Practical Nursing courses eligible for transfer credit.\n\nThere is no validation testing for PNSG 2010 transfer credit.\n\nTo receive transfer credit for PNSG 2030, students must successfully complete validation testing administered by OFTC faculty. Validation testing includes the applicable ATI (Assessment Technologies Institute) exam(s) and a skills-based performance test. The ATI exam(s) must be completed with a minimum score of a level 2; the skills-based test must be completed with a score of 100%. Both requirements must be fulfilled prior to the student being allowed to compete for a program slot. Therefore, all skills validation testing must be completed before the competitive application deadline for the chosen term of entry. Tests should be scheduled well in advance, and availability is based on OFTC instructor schedules. Students will be allowed one attempt on the ATI exam(s) and one attempt on the skills-based exam. Successful completion of the ATI exam(s) is required prior to the skills-based test being administered. The fee for the ATI exam must be paid with a credit card by the student during the testing process.\n\nRespiratory Care – Students wishing to re-enter or transfer in to the Respiratory Care program must successfully complete validation testing administered by OFTC Respiratory Care faculty. Validation testing will consist of a combination of hands-on program-related activities and written evaluation, which will require a score of 70% or greater. Both requirements must be fulfilled prior to the student being allowed to compete for a program slot. Therefore, all skills validation testing must be completed before the competitive application deadline for the chosen term of entry. Validation testing should be scheduled well in advance, and availability is based on OFTC instructor schedules.\n\nApplicants who feel that they were unjustly denied admission have the right to appeal any decision regarding acceptance to the director of student affairs within three (3) business days of receiving notification of their admission status. The written document must include specific details supporting the appeal. A further appeal may be made to the vice president of student affairs. This appeal also must be made via the admissions appeal process.\n\nIf a student has been extended two offers of acceptance into a specific allied health program at the former HGTC, the former STC, or OFTC and did not complete the program, the student will be denied admittance into the program. Students who have extenuating circumstances may appeal the decision in writing via the admissions appeal process.\n\nAll newly-accepted Practical Nursing students will be required to attend an orientation session prior to the beginning of the Practical Nursing classes. Attendance to both events is mandatory. Any student not attending the required event will forfeit his/her slot.\n\nNOTE: If a student elects to take an exemption test and passes the test for one of the required core classes for an allied health competitive program, then the exempted course will not be used for calculating the GPA for a competitive allied health program acceptance. Students may only exempt two courses in competitive allied health programs.\n\nTEAS Testing Procedures:\n\nAssessment Center staff will establish sufficient TEAS administration dates and at varying times to be available and convenient to all candidates needing testing and/or retesting.\n\nCommunication of TEAS dates to allied health candidates will be accomplished through the OFTC website Admissions page, an email to all OFTC student accounts at the first of each semester, and an email to Student Affairs and affiliated instructional faculty/staff/administration.\n\nCandidates for TEAS testing must register online to take the TEAS exam. Tests within a given semester will not be scheduled earlier than the first day of classes for that semester. Test appointments will be scheduled on a first-come, first-serve basis until capacity is reached.\n\nFollowing TEAS testing, each first-time candidate is required to personally meet with Assessment Center staff for counseling and interpretation of his/her scores."
