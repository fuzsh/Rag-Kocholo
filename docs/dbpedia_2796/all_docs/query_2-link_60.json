We know you are prepared to do great things.”\n\nFelicia Ailster, Executive Director of Financial Aid at Georgia Gwinnett Technical College served as keynote speaker and addressed the graduates, applauding them for their hard work and dedication in accomplishing their goals.\n\nMany of you have faced challenges,” Ailster said. “You have demonstrated courage, determination, and a fierce spirit that brought you here to this day. You’re an inspiration to all of us.”\n\nAcknowledging their skills, Ailster encouraged the graduates to maintain high standards of character and integrity. “As you move forward, remember that your education is a powerful tool and it’s how you use those tools that matters.”\n\n“The skills you’ve learned here will open doors for you,” she said, “but your character and integrity will determine where those doors lead.”\n\nOFTC offers a first-class education that’s close to home and affordable.
