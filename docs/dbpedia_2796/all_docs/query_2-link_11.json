If the recall is not successful and the item has been checked out for over thirty days, then the patron may submit an interlibrary loan request.\n\nThe borrower accepts financial responsibility for any loss or damage incurred to the item while in their possession.\n\nChattahoochee Tech Library reserves the right to refuse an interlibrary loan request that, in our judgment, would violate U.S. copyright law, Title 17 U.S. Code. Once an item is received through interlibrary-loan, it is the borrower’s responsibility to avoid copyright infringement.\n\nIf you need assistance, please contact your campus librarian.\n\nBack to Library Services List\n\nCopyright Laws and Peer-to-Peer File Sharing\n\nUnauthorized Distribution of Copyrighted Materials is Against Federal Law\n\nThe unauthorized copying and distributing of copyrighted materials, including, but not limited to peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing, is a violation of United States copyright law and may result in civil and criminal liability and prosecution.\n\nSummary of Civil and Criminal Penalties for Violation of Federal Copyright Laws\n\nCopyright infringement is the act of exercising, without permission or legal authority, one or more of the exclusive rights granted to the copyright owner under section 106 of the Copyright Act (Title 17 of the United States Code).
