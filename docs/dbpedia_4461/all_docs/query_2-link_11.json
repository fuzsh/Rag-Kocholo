        "text": "1961\n\nMarienfelde refugee transit camp\n\nHundreds of thousands of refugees leave the GDR. By 1960, 2.97 million people have already left East Germany. Marienfelde refugee transit camp in West Berlin is often their first port of call. Ursula Hagemann worked as a nurse at the camp and talks about her experiences there in 1961. She remembers how many a refugee from \"\"the other side\"\" was disappointed by the camp's simple facilities and cramped conditions. After the Wall is built, the flood of refugees dries up. There will not be another influx from the East until the mid 1980s.\n\nBorder, Escaping, Contemporary Witnesses, West\n\n01:26\n\nVideo versions:\n\nSD ,\n\nMD\n\nJune 15, 1961\n\n\"Nobody has any intention of building a wall\"\n\n\"West Berlin is hosting the first German-American Festival. However, rumours are circulating that East Berlin is planning to close its borders. The Western world watches nervously to see what fate awaits the city. People have been leaving the GDR in their thousands and continue to flee. Cross-border commuters – Berliners who work in the West of the city, but live in the East – are being subjected to ever-tighter controls. At the same time, GDR head of state Walter Ulbricht faces journalists from all over the world asking about the status of West Berlin at an international press conference. Annemarie Doherr from the Frankfurter Rundschau asks Ulbricht if he believes that creating a free city will involve building a state border at the Brandenburg Gate. Ulbricht gives the following reply: \"\"I understand your question in this way: that there are people in West Germany who want us to mobilise the construction workers of the GDR capital to build a wall. Am I right? I am not aware of any such plans. Most of the capital's construction workers are busy building flats and their manpower is being put to full use in these projects. Nobody has any intention of building a wall.\" A few weeks later, events in Berlin reveal his statement to be a lie. On 13 August 1961 the GDR starts building a wall that will divide East and West for the next 28 years.\n\nPolitics, West, East\n\n01:16\n\nVideo versions:\n\nSD ,\n\nMD\n\nAugust 13, 1961\n\nThe Wall goes up\n\nOn 13 August 1961 work begins to construct the Wall. The division of East and West shocks Berliners and the Western world. They are left stunned as barbed wire and barricades carve the city in half and tear families apart. The mayor of Berlin is also shaken by events and makes the following statement: \"The wall to a concentration camp is now cutting through the heart of Berlin.\" The number of refugees soared in the week before the Wall went up. In July 1961, 30,415 people applied for emergency accommodation. Over Easter alone, 4,000 people entered the transit camp – the first port of call for those who have no relatives in the West. The powers-that-be in the GDR have decided to put a stop to the mass exodus of its citizens. At first, the Western allies do not react to the closing of the border, as the barricades do not infringe their rights.\n\nBorder, Escaping, Politics, West, East\n\n01:48\n\nVideo versions:\n\nSD ,\n\nMD\n\nAugust 13, 1961\n\nThe end of the line at the Wall\n\nOn 13 August 1961 S-bahn trains reached the end of the line at the Wall.

As well as the famous fraternal kiss (staged at Schönhausen Palace to show the special relationship between the two states), the official schedule also includes an appearance at the ostentatious anniversary parade. Brezhnev tells the SED politburo that it must see to it that industrial productivity increases. “After all,” he says “we can only consume what we produce. None of us want to live at someone else’s expense or declare ourselves bankrupt.”\n\nPolitics, East\n\n00:36\n\nVideo versions:\n\nSD ,\n\nMD\n\nAugust 13, 1961\n\nA lucrative bridge business\n\nWith his grandmother in Wedding in the West and his father in Prenzlauer Berg in the East, eleven-year-old Hans-Joachim Weß often cycles over Böse Bridge on Bornholmer Strasse.

An Italian journalist asks about changes to the laws governing the right to travel. Schabowski answers: \"We have therefore decided today to put in place a regulation that allows every citizen of the German Democratic Republic to leave through any of its border crossings.\" Journalist: \"When does it come into effect?\" Schabowski: \"That comes into effect, according to my information… immediately, without delay.\" Schabowski continues: \"Permanent exit can take place via all border crossing points between the GDR and FRG or West Berlin.\" A few hours later, the Wall falls.\n\nBorder, Politics, West, East\n\n02:03\n\nVideo versions:\n\nSD ,\n\nMD\n\nAugust 13, 1961\n\nA teacher commuting across borders\n\n\"They're expecting me at work\", says Heinz Kranaster, a vocational school teacher who commutes across the border to West Berlin every day.
