After her death in 1901, Lord Curzon, the then Viceroy of India, proposed the idea of constructing a grand edifice in her honor that would also serve as a museum of Indian history and culture. He envisioned it as a symbol of British imperial power and a tribute to the queen’s contribution to India’s progress and development.\n\nThe construction of the Victoria Memorial began in 1906 and was completed in 1921. It was funded by both the British government and the Indian princes and people. The total cost of the project was about 1.5 million pounds (about 150 crore rupees at that time). The architect of the monument was Sir William Emerson, who designed it in the Indo-Saracenic style, blending elements of Mughal, Islamic, Venetian, Egyptian, and British architecture. The building was made of white Makrana marble from Rajasthan, which gives it a stunning appearance.\n\nThe Victoria Memorial was formally inaugurated by King George V and Queen Mary in 1911 during their visit to India for the Delhi Durbar. However, they could not enter the building as it was still under construction. The first gallery of the museum was opened to the public in 1921 by Lord Chelmsford, the then Viceroy of India. Since then, the museum has been expanded and renovated several times to accommodate more exhibits and facilities.\n\nThe Victoria Memorial has witnessed many historical events and changes in India’s political and social landscape.
