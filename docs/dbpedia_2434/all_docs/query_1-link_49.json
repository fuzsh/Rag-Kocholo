This trail is a quiet reach, with several small riffles (fast flowing, shallow water). The presence of occasional sandbars may provide resting or birdwatching sites.\n\nFishing\n\nThis section of the river supports numerous catfish, Guadalupe bass, and sunfish. Small lures such as jigs, plastic worms, spinner baits and light-line are recommended.\n\nWildlife and Ecology\n\nThe Guadalupe River corridor supports a diversity of plants and animals. It is a premier birding destination with a variety of migratory species visiting the area. Sightings include bald eagles, osprey, egrets, herons, kingfishers, hawks, sandpipers, phoebes, and turkeys. You will see native cypress, oak, and pecan trees, as well as many non-native tree and plant species. Common wildlife encountered are deer, armadillos, and squirrels.\n\nPrivate Property\n\nRespect private property by not trespassing or littering and keeping noise levels down. This river is classified as navigable, which permits public use of the streambed and, if necessary, the banks to portage any hazard. Any other use of private river banks without permission of the landowner can be considered trespassing. Under Texas Penal Code (§30.05), criminal trespass occurs when one enters property after receiving notice not to enter. Notice includes verbal notice, a fence, sign(s), purple paint on posts or trees, or the visible presence of crops grown for human consumption.\n\nEvents & Attractions\n\nFor more information please see the TPWD Paddling Events calendar.\n\nLocal Activities\n\nRiverside Park - Over 500 acres of parkland including group picnic sites, over 100 picnic tables, walking trails, river access and much more.\n\nWithin Riverside Park:\n\nRiverside Golf Course – 27 hole golf course that is split into three 18 hole combinations.\n\nRiverside Disc Golf Course – 21 baskets and one of the most challenging courses in Texas.\n\nTexas Zoo – Visit the wild side of Victoria\n\nRiverside Park Memorial Rose Garden – There are over 1,300 blooming roses and the aroma is breath taking.\n\nRiverside Stadium-The current home of the University of Houston-Victoria baseball team and the Victoria Generals of the Texas Collegiate League.\n\nThe PumpHouse Riverside Restaurant and Bar - Offers casual outdoor dining on the decks overlooking the scenic Guadalupe River, or indoor dining and full bar service.\n\nVisit Historic Downtown Victoria where Texas history began.\n\nPartnership\n\nThis trail was made possible through a partnership between Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority, Coastal Bend Paddlers, and the City of Victoria.\n\nRentals\n\nFlow Paddle Co.\n\nKayaks and shuttle service\n\n(361) 935-2618"
