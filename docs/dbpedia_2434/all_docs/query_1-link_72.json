It transports you back nearly seven decades to when brave sailors fought the harsh seas to reach their comrades around the world servicing in the United States Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard, carrying ammunition, goods, cargo, equipment, materials and troops necessary to defend our country. As the “unsung heroes” of numerous conflicts and the military, the merchant marines experienced the highest percentage rate of casualties of any service."
