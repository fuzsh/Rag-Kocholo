        "text": "I went into 2023 with a huge appetite for travel but very few plans to do so. Little did I know London was on the horizon, and while my annual anniversary trip was much tamer than usual in humble Huntsville AL, I was so glad to do a solo Disney World trip (again), take my girls on the road for the first time to Louisiana, and have lots of Tennessee day trips in between. Enjoy this travel journal of 379 (!!!) places, including: üñºÔ∏è 64 Museums, Gardens, and Attractions ‚òïÔ∏è 53 Coffee Shops üçΩÔ∏è 82 Restaurants, Bakeries, Bars, and Food Trucks üõèÔ∏è 29 Hotels, Bed & Breakfasts, and Airbnbs ‚ú® and a whole bunch more! Scroll to the bottom for my favorites of the year!\n\nOh, we're just getting started! Now that I have a travel buddy, my wanderlust has been awakened like never before. I didn't do all my travel with her, but with her finding cheap flights, I finally got to go places I never thought I'd get to and they were just so much more accessible. The vast majority of 2018 was spent doing weekend trips, which turned out to be our \"thing\". Don't let anyone tell you you need to spend more than a week traveling, even in Europe!"
