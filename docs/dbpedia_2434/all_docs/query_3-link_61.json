        "text": "Just a reminder that students are not permitted to order or have food/drink items delivered during the school day as outlined on page six of the Student Handbook. Interrupting classes for food delivery is disruptive to the educational day. Thank you for your anticipated cooperation.\n\nExtra Help will take place every day of the school week except Fridays. There will be no Extra Help or clubs on Fridays. Therefore, there will not be any 2:15 pm or 3:15 pm buses on Fridays. Students will not be allowed back into the building once they leave. Student-athletes know to follow coachesâ€™ directions as to where and when to meet.\n\nIn an effort to ensure continued building safety and security after school hours, no student will be allowed to re-enter the high school building after 1:34 pm dismissal. Athletes and members of clubs should attend extra help and then report to the team or club location. Any student who does not attend extra help, should report directly to a location assigned by the coach or club advisor. Any student who leaves the building, will not be allowed back in for any reason. These students will be turned away. This applies for all sports practices or meetings until 3:15 pm after buses leave. Please note that students reporting for practices scheduled for later than 3:15 pm may leave and return.\n\nWelcome to the William Floyd High School\n\nPlease CLICK HERE to access the CANVAS learning management system.\n\nThe William Floyd High School in active partnership with students, parents, educators and the community is committed to creating a challenging and rigorous academic environment where all students have the opportunity to apply their knowledge and skills to become responsible members of the community.\n\nThrough this process, the mission of the William Floyd High School is to foster the development of life-long learners that will become productive contributors of our highly technical and diverse society.\n\nWe constantly strive to provide the most positive educational experience possible for the children in our district. With dedicated faculty, staff, administrators, concerned parents and the greatest kids on Long Island, the best is yet to come.\n\nAttention All Students\n\nAfter 7:30 am, all students will enter in the North Lobby through the Attendance Area door.\n\nYou must present your school ID to the receptionist.\n\nYou will then be directed into the Attendance Office.\n\nThe reason for your lateness will be documented and you will be provided with a pass to go to class.\n\nSTUDENT PARKING/entering the building/SENIORS WITH LATE ARRIVAL"
