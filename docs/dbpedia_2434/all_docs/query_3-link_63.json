        "text": "This manicured area of green is named after Queen Victoria, who played a key role in Norfolk Island history.\n\nIn 1855, the British monarch granted those on Pitcairn Island (the descendants of Bounty mutineers and Tahitians) the right to settle here. The Pitcairners arrived the following year and many of us Norfolk Islanders can trace our lineage back to them.\n\nQueen Victoria Memorial Gardens were created by horticulturist, Pitcairn descendant and Norfolk Islander, Marie Bailey. To see the gardens at their most colourful, visit in spring or summer when jacaranda and scarlet flame trees bloom.\n\nAs you stroll, keep your eyes peeled for driftwood sculptures depicting an animal youâ€™ll see quite a lot of here on the island: the cow."
