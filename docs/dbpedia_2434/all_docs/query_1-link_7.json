        "text": "Location: Victoria Memorial Hall, 1, Queen's Way, Kolkata, West Bengal 700071\n\nHow to get there: Take the Metro to Rabindra Sadan and walk in through the South Gate, or two Maidan and go through the Main Gate. Once you get to the gate, convince the guards you have a meeting with the Curator so you don’t have to pay the entrance fee.\n\nThe Curator’s office is a small one story white office building to the east of the Memorial Building (next to the Canteen and toilets). Ask one of the staff to have a meeting with the director about your research. It can be best to go in unannounced.\n\nWebsite: victoriamemorial-cal.org\n\nLanguage: English, Bengali\n\nGetting started: The Victoria Memorial has a Library and a “Documentation Unit” (meaning archive).\n\nContact the Curator, (Mr. Sengupta at the time of research) curatorvmh@gmail.com, for any requests.\n\nThe Library contains some 11,000 books relating mostly to British imperial history, accessible by a card catalog onsite.\n\nThe Documentation Unit contains many original manuscripts, paintings etc about historical Calcutta. There is a partial catalog on site. The Documentation Unit has also Hyde’s Notebooks (not available when I researched; the Memorial had sent them to Jadavpur University of digitization.). It is located in the South East side of the Memorial building, on the ground floor.\n\nNo particular documents were required when I went. It may help to have the curator write a short note to the Librarian or the Head of the Documentation Unit, Mr. Navi granting you permission. Located on the ground floor.\n\nOpening Hours: Office: 10am-5:00pm. Documentation Unit: Around 10:30am to 5pm. Library: 12 to 5:00 Monday to Friday. (As of research, they have one retired librarian, Mr. Roy.)\n\nGeneral working conditions: Not air conditioned. The Documentation Unit will bring whatever documents you request into their office.\n\nPolicy on technology: No general policy.\n\nPhotocopy policy: No general policy."
