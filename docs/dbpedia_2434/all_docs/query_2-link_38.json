        "text": "Calcutta had been on my bucket list ever since we moved to India in 2018. But one thing and another (with 2 years of Covid) and with so many places competing for attention, it was not until July 2023 that I got to visit the city. Who knew moving out of India would not only bring me closer to the Eastern State but also make it more easily accessible.\n\nCalcutta is one of the few cities in India that there is a direct flight to, from Dhaka where we currently live. And it’s only half an hour away by flight. However, despite traveling via Calcutta airport several times, since we moved here in October 2022, it was only two months ago that we saw the city.\n\nFor reasons beyond our control, our 5 days stay extended to twelve, and by the end of it, I knew enough to say that Calcutta or Kolkata, as it is called now, is safer than the other Indian metro cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore, Pune, Hyderabad, Chennai and Surat). Unlike the other Metros, Kolkata welcomes you with an air of quiet calm, an unrushed, languorous attitude. There is none of the buzz that makes up the other Metros. The city comes alive during the five days of Durga Pooja which falls around October or November and to a certain extent during Christmas.\n\nOther than that the city is the land of Rabindranath Tagore, author, poet and Nobel Prize winner in Literature; Mother Teressa, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, Swami Vivekananda, Satyajit Ray, Amartya Sen, the Nobel prize winner in Economics and Dr. Ronald Ross, the Nobel Prize winner in Medicine or that city has a rich history, I knew little else. I had classmates from the city in school and college who swore by it, and others who had only visited told me that it was crowded and messy. ‘Garbage everywhere,’ is how my mother-in-law had described the city when she had visited it in 1998. Knowing this, however, had not reduced my hunger to visit the city that had once been the capital of British India from 1772 to 1911. The capital was later moved by the British to Delhi as it was felt that administering the country would be easier from Delhi. Prior to 1772, Delhi had been the financial and political center of many empires that had earlier ruled India.\n\nIn 2019, when a well-traveled British couple we met at a dinner in Mumbai, said they loved Kolkata, I asked them, “More than Mumbai?” and they unequivocally said, ‘Yes.’ This awakened my hunger. What was it that made Kolkata different from the other cities in India? What was it about the city that churned out artists and writers, poets and musicians, and Nobel Prize winners?\n\nAfter my visit to the city, I can only say that Kolkata is a charming, livable city with a small-town feel. The slowness may appeal to some. It has none of the buzz of Mumbai or Bangalore. It’s a place I could easily travel on my own to. The people are friendly, helpful, and love to engage in a conversation. They have a tendency to stare way beyond what would be considered appropriate, but they don’t mean anything. Once you get past feeling uncomfortable, you’ll be fine in Kolkata.\n\nGoing from Dhaka to Kolkata, the similarities between the two places stare at you in the face. The people on both sides of the border look similar and speak the same language, Bengali. After all, the former was a part of Calcutta before India and Pakistan split in 1947. The Muslims from Kolkata moved to Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) while the Bengali Hindus stayed on in Calcutta. In 1971, Bangladesh fought for freedom from Pakistan and became an independent nation.\n\nHowever, the Bengalis on the Indian side are different from those on the Bangladesh side because of the influence of economic development, globalization, education and capitalism (despite Kolkata being one of the three States in India with a Communist government).\n\nOf the twelve days we were there (5 by choice and 7 out of compulsion) we spent a week in the older part of Kolkata, and the next five days in the newer extension of the city. The old town is where all the heritage sites are. Victoria Memorial, Birla Planetarium, Birla Mandir, Indian Museum, Science Museum, Howrah bridge, and St Paul’s Cathedral are some of the sites we visited. It’s also closer to the new malls if you want to go shopping. The new town has a lot of high-rise buildings and lower-rent hotels. It is closer to the Kali temple and Ramakrishna Mutt (Ashram) .\n\nThis post was supposed to be about our experience during the first week of our stay but I stopped after the second day because it was getting too long.\n\nThe reason that we went to Calcutta soon after our Norway trip was that it was where our girls were to meet us. On the first day, all we did was talk and rest. The girls were exhausted after a 14-hour flight. And so were we as we had returned only a day ago, from Norway.\n\nThe next day, we were all set to explore the city despite the rains. Being the monsoon season in India, it rained on and off constantly. But not enough to stop us. We booked an Uber for half a day to go around the city.\n\nVictoria Memorial\n\nOur first stop was the Victoria Memorial, the largest memorial ever built for a royal. We were blown away by the splendor of the building and the sprawling gardens in which the memorial stands. A monument in white Makrana marble (the same that has been used to build the Taj Mahal) standing tall against a backdrop of watery skies in 64 acres of sprawling green lawn. The structure is crowned by a bronze statue of the Angel of Victory with a bugle in her hand that stands 16 feet high. Fixed to its pedestal with ball bearings, the Angel of Victory rotates as wind blows strongly even though it is not a weathervane.\n\nIn the front of the memorial, is a bronze sculpture of Queen Victoria, the Empress of India from 1876 to 1901, sitting on the throne, in all her grandeur.\n\nThe memorial currently houses a museum and has 25 galleries. The galleries are used for art exhibitions, musical concerts, workshops, and lectures. The Memorial is now one of the most vibrant cultural spaces in Kolkata.\n\nThe doors in the below pictures were all closed, so I’m not sure where they led to. We walked through the only open door and found ourselves in a hall with coins and stamps in use during those times.\n\nThe architecture of the dome is breathtaking with stained glass windows and paintings. Several allegorical sculptures like Justice, Motherhood, Architecture, Learning and Prudence in and around add to the beauty of the place.\n\nThere are statues of Curzon, Dalhousie, and Hastings, among others.\n\nThe Queen’s proclamation and message, signed in 1858 and 1877 respectively, made me laugh. How could anybody lie so blatantly? The Queen’s message reads, ‘To promote happiness and prosperity among our subjects,’ and the proclamation reads, ‘In their prosperity will be our strength, in their contentment, our security and in their gratitude, our best reward.’\n\nOn the top floor of the Memorial are pictures of the revolutionaries.\n\nIt was nice to see so many youngsters (who did not look like tourists) spending their weekend in the Memorial, reading about the country’s history and fight for freedom. The walls of this gallery were lined with photographs of young men not older than 25 at the time of their death. Glass enclosures held biographies and letters the men had written before being hung. Not all had believed non-violence would lead to freedom. Many had protested and lost their lives. I believe both believers had been instrumental in freeing the country from 200 years of colonial rule.\n\nIn other galleries were paintings, manuscripts, coins, stamps, and artifacts relating to royalty and the empire.\n\nAfter a tour of the Memorial, we decided to stop over at St. Paul’s cathedral, which is adjacent to the Memorial. Built in Gothic style, the white edifice of the cathedral is impossible to miss from the main road. It stands tall and wide, against the green lawns and pale skies. It’s an Anglican church, the first of its kind built outside Great Britain. The central tower is inspired by the ‘Bell Harry’ tower of Canterbury Cathedral. It’s easy to forget you are in Kolkata when you’re standing before it. I hadn’t expected it to be as beautiful as it was. Inside, there is a stained-glass west window by Pre-Raphaelite maestro Sir Edward Burne-Jones, but as photographs were not allowed inside, the outside is all I can share here.\n\nOn the way back from the church to the city, we were surprised to see horses grazing in the Maidan (largest urban park in Kolkata). The driver informed us that the race track was somewhere close by. We passed the famous Eden Gardens cricket ground on the way and saw some beautiful buildings reminiscent of the Colonial era. The driver informed us that it was Dalhousie Square. The Writer’s Building (below) was the former seat of the British Government in India. The General Post Office (GPO) building is built on the site of the Black Hole tragedy, where 146 British prisoners were locked into a 14 X 18 foot room. By morning, 123 of them were found dead because of the terrible Indian summer heat. The Black Hole memorial has been moved to St. John’s church grounds.\n\nWe ended the tour with an authentic Bengali lunch at 6 Baligunj Place. The lamb curry was out of the world and so was the steamed fish. Strangely, all the vegetarian dishes were different curries of potato- potato and beans, spicy potato gravy, and potato in curd curry. I say, ‘strange’ because down South when we say ‘vegetarian’, we have a wide range of vegetables to choose from.\n\nThe lunch marked the end of our tour. We spent the rest of the day at the hotel, watching the rain falling in sheets against the window and catching up on the children’s stories over the last five months. Not that there were any new stories. With WhatsApp free calls, the girls make sure to call us every day. But listening to the same stories again, this time face to face, felt like we were listening to new ones.\n\nLast, but not the least, I’m ending with a picture of a door to a long forgotten house that I took on the way back to the hotel. In the heart of the city, surrounded by newer buildings, it stood decaying.\n\nI wonder what stories lie in those walls.\n\nThe Thursday Doors is a weekly challenge hosted by Dan Antion for people who love doors and architecture to come together to admire and share their favorite door photos, drawings, or other images or stories from around the world.\n\nI’m linking this post to Jo’s Monday walk as well.
