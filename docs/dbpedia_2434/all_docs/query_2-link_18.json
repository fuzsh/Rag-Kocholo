        "text": "Hello guys. Hope you all continue to stay safe from the worst ever pandemic the world has witnessed. Is it time I should stop asking this question? Even I started feeling that this question can be avoided now as Covid has become like a normal fever or cough that happens to anyone in the society. If this hasn’t become common, then why would companies start functioning with almost 100% staff. Even I have started going regularly to office even when I got the option to do Work From Home for more than three-fourth of the working days in a month. Working from our personal workspace at office is a special emotion and eventhough I didn’t get my favorite desk to work at, I somehow got a desk in my favorite bay. I felt too much nostalgic when I returned to the bay after more than two years. It was without any choice I had to leave office in March 2020 before the lockdown started. I returned after a year to the premises to take the doses of my vaccine and also got the chance to meet my best friends after a year. On returning after another year, most of my friends are no longer working at my company but in the gap of a year, I made many new friendships and now I’m looking forward for some good moments to happen with them. I actually promised in my previous post with reference to our latest YouTube video that the next post on the blog would be published over the weekend but I know it has been quite later than the time. There was a very special reason why the post has been delayed on the blog which I’ll mention towards the end of the blog. In our previous journey, we returned to Rajasthan to cover the Hill Forts of Kumbhalgarh, Ranthambore and Jaisalmer and thus completed the tour of all the six Hill Forts of Rajasthan on the blog. Today, we are returning to Eastern India to take a tour of one of the oldest and most famous monuments in the country and can be said that one of its kind in the subcontinent. Let us start our exploration of what is inside the Victoria Memorial.\n\nThe Victoria Memorial is a large marble building in Central Kolkata, which was built between 1906 and 1921. It is dedicated to the memory of Queen Victoria, Empress of India from 1876 to 1901. It is now a museum under the auspices of the Ministry of Culture, and is the largest monument in the world which is dedicated to a royal. The memorial lies on the Maidan and is one of the famous monuments of Kolkata. Following the death of Queen Victoria in January 1901, it was suggested by Lord Curzon, then-Viceroy of India, that a fitting memorial to the late Queen-Empress be created. Lord Curzon proposed the construction of a grand building with a museum and gardens. Curzon said: “Let us, therefore, have a building, stately, spacious, monumental and grand, to which every newcomer in Calcutta will turn, to which all the resident population, European and Native, will flock, where all classes will learn the lessons of history and see revived before their eyes the marvels of the past.” The Prince of Wales, laid the foundation stone on 4 January 1906, and it was formally opened to the public in 1921. In 1912, before the construction of the Victoria Memorial was finished, King George V announced the transfer of the capital of India from Kolkata to New Delhi. Thus, the Victoria Memorial was built in what would be a provincial city rather than a capital. The Victoria Memorial was mainly funded by British officials and individuals of India. The politicians and people of India responded generously to Lord Curzon’s appeal for funds, and the total cost of construction of the monument, amounting to one crore, five lakhs of Rupees (₹), was entirely derived from their voluntary subscriptions. The construction of the Victoria Memorial was delayed by Curzon’s departure from India in 1905 with a subsequent loss of local enthusiasm for the project and the need for testing of the foundations. The Victoria Memorial’s foundation stone was set in 1906 and the building opened in 1921. The work of construction was entrusted to Messrs. Martin & Co. of Kolkata. Work on the superstructure began in 1910. After 1947, some additions were made to the Memorial. A smaller Victoria memorial was also constructed in the Hardoi District, which has since been converted into a city club for recreation. It is also where Mahatma Gandhi addressed Hardoi in the 1930’s.\n\nThe Victoria Memorial’s architect was William Emerson (1843–1924). The design is in the Indo-Saracenic revivalist style which uses a mixture of British and Mughal elements with Venetian, Egyptian, Deccani architectural influences. The building is 338 by 228 feet (103 by 69 m) and rises to a height of 184 feet (56 m). It is constructed of white Makrana marble. The gardens of the Victoria Memorial were designed by Lord Redesdale and David Prain. Emerson’s assistant, Vincent Jerome Esch, designed the bridge of the north aspect and the garden gates. In 1902, Emerson engaged Esch to sketch his original design for the Victoria Memorial. Atop the central dome of the Victoria Memorial is the 16 ft (4.9 m) figure of the Angel of Victory. Surrounding the dome are allegorical sculptures including Art, Architecture, Justice, and Charity and above the North Porch are Motherhood, Prudence and Learning. The Victoria Memorial is built of white Makrana marble. In design it echoes the Taj Mahal with its dome, four subsidiaries, octagonal-domed chattris, high portals, terrace, and domed corner towers. The Victoria Memorial has 25 galleries. These include the royal gallery, the national leader’s gallery, the portrait gallery, central hall, the sculpture gallery, the arms and armory gallery, and the newer, Kolkata gallery. The Victoria Memorial has the largest single collection of the works of Thomas Daniell (1749–1840) and his nephew, William Daniell (1769–1837). It also has a collection of rare and antiquarian books such as the illustrated works of William Shakespeare, the Arabian Nights and the Rubaiyat by Omar Khayyam as well as books about kathak dance and thumri music by Nawab Wajid Ali Shah. However, the galleries and their exhibitions, the programmatic elements of the memorial do not compete with the purely architectural spaces or voids.\n\nThe Victoria Gallery displays several portraits of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and paintings illustrating their lives, by Jansen and Winterhalter. The oil paintings are copies of those in London. They include Victoria receiving the sacrament at her coronation in Westminster Abbey (June 1838); Victoria’s marriage to Albert in the Chapel Royal at St James’s Palace (1840); the christening of the Prince of Wales in Windsor Castle (1842); the marriage of Edward VII to Princess Alexandra (1863); Victoria at the First Jubilee service at Westminster Abbey (1887) and the Second Jubilee service at St. Paul’s Cathedral (June 1897). Queen Victoria’s childhood rosewood pianoforte and her correspondence desk from Windsor Castle stand in the center of the room. Edward VII presented these items to the Victoria Memorial. On the south wall hangs the Russian artist Vasily Vereshchagin’s oil painting of the state entry of Edward VII in Jaipur in 1876. In the mid-1970s, the matter of a new gallery devoted to the visual history of Kolkata was promoted by Saiyid Nurul Hasan, the minister for education. In 1986, Hasan became the governor of West Bengal and chairman of the Victoria Memorial board of trustees. In November 1988, Hasan hosted an international seminar on the Historical perspectives for the Kolkata tercentenary. The Kolkata gallery concept was agreed and a design was developed leading to the opening of the gallery in 1992. The Kolkata gallery houses a visual display of the history and development of Kolkata when the capital of India was transferred to New Delhi. The gallery also has a life-size diorama of Chitpur road in the late 1800s. The gardens at the Victoria memorial cover 64 acres (260,000 m2) and are maintained by a team of 21 gardeners. They were designed by Redesdale and David Prain. On Esch’s bridge, between narrative panels by Goscombe John, there is a bronze statue of Victoria, by George Frampton. Empress Victoria is seated on her throne. In the paved quadrangles and elsewhere around the building, other statues commemorate Hastings, Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis, Robert Clive, Arthur Wellesley, and James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie. To the south of the Victoria, Memorial building is the Edward VII memorial arch. The arch has a bronze equestrian statue of Edward VII by Bertram Mackennal and a marble statue of Curzon by F. W. Pomeroy. The garden also contains statues of Lord William Bentinck, governor-general of India (1833–1835), George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon, governor-general of India (1880–84), and Rajendra Nath Mookerjee, a pioneer industrialist of Bengal. Following an order of the West Bengal High Court in 2004, an entry fee was imposed for the gardens, a decision welcomed by the general public except for few voices of dissent.\n\nThe vision of the Victoria Memorial Hall is to be the premier period museum in the world on Indo-British history in the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The mission of the Victoria Memorial Hall is to function as the premier art gallery, museum, research library on art history and museum studies, and cultural space in the city of Kolkata. In order to pursue this mission, it collects, conserves and disseminates knowledge among the general public about art objects, historical relics, and documents relating mainly to Indian history in the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In addition to the exhibits on permanent display, the Victoria Memorial Hall also organizes regular special exhibitions, lectures, publications, cultural programmes and interactive educational activities – both on-site and in different parts of India and abroad – in its four focal areas of activity, namely, art, culture, heritage and the environment. It promotes research through its research fellowships and library resources, networks extensively with other museums, historical societies and the academia, and seeks to promote positive social change through its outreach activities with non-museum organizations and community groups. It always strives to be – and is recognized by the wider community – as a museum without walls. Curzon from the very beginning had laid out in impeccable details about how he envisaged the Memorial for the Queen. The emphasis was placed on symbolism. The Victoria Memorial Hall was conceived to be not only a monument in memory of the deceased queen. Curzon wanted to project the building as ‘a standing record of our wonderful history.’ What Curzon had desired was that the building should serve as an impressive example of colonial presence.Hence Curzon entrusted architect William Emerson who already had to his glory the famous architectural buildings like the Crawford market in Bombay and All Saints Cathedral in Allahabad. Curzon had an affinity towards classical style and he insisted Emerson to submit designs in the Italian renaissance style. As an assistance to Emerson, Vincent Esch was appointed in 1902 and he was encouraged to sketch an original design for Victoria Memorial Hall. The construction of the memorial began in 1910 and by this time Esch was promoted as the project’s Superintending Architect.What is noteworthy is that even though Curzon had employed British architects to build the memorial, it necessarily reflected not only a classical style but also a reflection of Curzon’s favourite monument the Taj Mahal. The Victoria Memorial Hall today stands as the most grand monument which has been erected across various countries in memory of the Queen.\n\nIn the Royal Gallery, there are oil paintings depicting scenes of Queen Victoria receiving the sacrament at her coronation in the Westminster Abbey in June 1838; her marriage with Prince Albert (1840) in the Chapel Royal at St. James’ Palace; the christening of the Prince of Wales in St. George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle (1842); marriage of the Prince of Wales (Edward VII) with Princess Alexandra (1863) ; Queen Victoria at the first Jubilee service in Westminster Abbey in 1887 and the Second Jubilee service of Queen Victoria at St. Paul’s Cathedral, June 1897. These are copies of paintings by well-known artists in the collection of the British royalty.The writing desk and chair constantly used by her for her daily correspondence at the Windsor Castle occupy the centre of the room. King Edward VII presented these to the Victoria Memorial. Beside the painting showing the entry of Prince Wales into Jaipur is displayed here. It is the largest in oils in India (see details given with the pix). On the south wall hangs the Russian ‘ artist Verestchagin’s masterpiece depicting in oils the state entry of King Edward VII, then Prince of Wales, into Jaipur in 1876. Also to be seen in this hall are portraits of Edward VII, as Prince of Wales, painted in 1863 by Jansen and those of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert when both were young, by Winterhalter. The Calcutta Gallery, India’s first city gallery, was visualised by Lord Curzon, at the turn of the century. The matter was taken up in mid- 1970s by Prof. S. Nurul Hasan, then Education Minister, Government of India. In 1986, Prof. Nurul Hasan became the Governor of West Bengal and Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Memorial. He took the initiative to see the Victoria Memorial emerge as the focal point of academic and tourist interest in Calcutta. In November1988, Prof. Hasan invited specialists to a brain storming international seminar on Historical Perspectives for the Calcutta tercentenary. Everyone welcomed the idea of a permanent Calcutta Gallery at the Victoria Memorial. The design concept was developed by Dr. Ashin Dasgupta and Dr. Barun De, of the Calcutta Gallery sub-committee. Mr. Vikas Satwalkar, Director of the National Institute of Design had helped to inspect and recommend the work, which was done under the guidance of Mr. Tridibesh Sanyal and Mr. Siddhartha Ghosh of Tangram Design Pvt. Ltd. The air conditioning was sponsored by Mr. B. M. Khaitan of Macneill & Magor. Beside all these, the total work was done under the supervision of Mr. Hiren Chakraborty, then Secretary and Curator of the Memorial. The Calcutta Gallery displays the history and development of Calcutta from Job Charnok and the British rule upto 1911,when the capital was shifted to Delhi. The gallery also has a life size diorama of the view of the Chitpur road in the late 19th century. Chitpur was the main business centre in those days, presently known as the Burabazar area.\n\nThe Durbar Hall houses a series of oil paintings restored with the help of the Calcutta Tercentenary Trust (CTT), United Kingdom, as part of a joint venture to preserve and promote the cultural heritage of India and Britain. The project was undertaken in the year 1990 to ensure restoration and preservation of 130 oil paintings from late 18th and early 19th century. When not required for any temporary exhibition, the Entrance Hall displays an exhibition titled Construction of the Memorial, comprising paintings and photographs depicting the different phases of construction of the Victoria Memorial between the years 1906 and 1921, when the memorial was opened for the public and thus giving the visitors entering the Museum an initial orientation about the origins of the Memorial. The Central Hall or the Queen’s Hall is a key attraction for visitors. Circular in shape, it has a full length marble statue of Queen Victoria (1831-1901) created by Sir Thomas Brock, standing right in the centre of the Hall directly 180 feet under the main dome of the monument. On display is also the piano used by Her Majesty in her younger days. The corners of the walls sport marble panels with extracts from two Proclamations of Queen Victoria dated 1858 and 1877 inscribed in different languages. On the upper segment of the hall are adorned with a series of twelve semicircular canvas paintings by Frank Salisbury depicting the important events in the life of Her Majesty Queen Empress Victoria. The sixth gallery in the hall is the Potrait Gallery. Victoria Memorial Hall boasts of the finest collection of paintings in western style by numerous celebrated painters. From portraits of eminent colonial administrators to paintings of Indian princes and rulers the collection of western paintings exhibit a diverse range of themes and use of medium. The paintings by Tilly Kettle, Johan Zofanny and landscape paintings by William Hodges and Daniells are few of the most prized collections of paintings housed in Victoria Memorial Hall.\n\nLike the collection of western paintings, Victoria Memorial Hall also houses an excellent collection by the Indian artists through ages. From miniature paintings of Mughal and Rajput genre to masters of modern Indian painting like Nandalal Bose, Abanindranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore the museum has a rich collection. Collection of documents are vast and one of the most precious collection of Victoria Memorial Hall. From personal correspondences of the colonial administrators, to official letters and copies of treaties and charters the museum houses a beautiful collection. Coins are one the most important sources in history. One can get a number of information from a coin. The collection of Victoria Memorial Hall contains a number of coins from different ages in history. Lord Curzon in his writings has mentioned inclusion of coins as a part of its historical collection. He wanted to bring about different coins from empires who have ruled India across time. Lithographs and aquatints form a substantial section of the painting collection of Victoria Memorial Hall. Lithographs and aquatints are important visual medium before the coming of photography. British colonial officials sought to different mediums to document the country of India. While the earlier method of documentation were aquatints and lithographs, with the advent of camera India was profusely captured, documented and reproduced. The Victoria Memorial Hall owns in its collection of rare photographs by Bourne and Shephard. Several volumes of manuscripts of various texts from Buddhist texts to sanskritik ones are a part of the collection at Victoria Memorial Hall. Arms and armours of Indian Rulers as well as British officials are one of the most viewed sections of the Victoria Memorial Hall. Lord Curzon had desired to acquire from different states of India swords, Spears, battle axes to be displayed in the museum. The museum at present give the viewer a large collection. Some of the extraordinary textiles include Golden brocade chadder, embroidered kantha, Fateh Nishan, Daccai Orna, Achhkan and a lock of hair of Tatya Tope and Indian embroidered dress worn by Lady Curzon. Some of the extraordinary textiles include Golden brocade chadder, embroidered kantha, Fateh Nishan, Daccai Orna, Achhkan and a lock of hair of Tatya Tope and Indian embroidered dress worn by Lady Curzon. Some of the remarkable miniature collections include Tansen, Nawab Suja-ud daula, Tipu Sultan, Prince Dara Shikoh, Emperor Jehangir with a lion , Durbar of Akbar & Sikh Guru Nanak.\n\nIn the second half of the eighteenth century, a number of amateur and professional European artists visited India and recorded Indian life, architecture, costumes and landscapes. Until then people in England had no visual image of India based on artists first-hand observations. Of the great European artists working on the Indian sub-continent in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the Daniells, Thomas (1749-1840) and his nephew William (1769-1837) were perhaps the most outstanding. Thomas Daniell and his nephew William Daniell played a prominent role in documenting the landscapes, building and peoples of the country. Their seven years tour of India from 1786 to 1793 and the subsequent publication of their work bought to the British public an unrivalled view of the scenes and architecture of this beautiful land. They set out from England in 1786 to make their fortune in India and in their six years stay ventured further than any British artist had done earlier. they took three tours across India: up the Ganga from Calcutta to Srinagar, 1788-91, a circular tour around Mysore from Madras, 1792-93, and finally on their return journey to England in 1793 visiting Bombay and its sites, sketching and drawing as they travelled. Arriving back in London in 1794 the Daniells turned the substantial number of on-site sketches into finished water colours and oil paintings. From 1795 to 1808 they concentrated on producing aquatint prints for their views of india, a work they titled Oriental Scenery. The work was published in six volumes and comprised a total of 144 coloured aquatints and six uncoloured titled-pages. It was an artistic and commercial success. The cost of the complete set was Sterling 210. Thirty sets were sold to the East India Company, and a further order for eighteen copies was received. Thomas Sutton quotes a glowing tribute to the artistic work of the Daniells in an extract from The Calcutta Monthly Magazine. “the execution of these drawings is indeed masterly; there is every reason to confide in the fidelity of the representations; and the effect produced by this rich and splendid display of oriental scenery is truly striking. In looking at it, one may almost feel the warmth of an Indian sky, the water seems to be in actual motion and the animals, trees and plants are studies for the naturalist”. Forty aquatints showing showing heritage buildings and sites of India are displayed in this exhibition. These are from Daniells Oriental Scenery in the collection of Victoria Memorial Hall. This will give visitors an idea of the appearance of these heritage buildings and sites in the eighteenth century. They will also be able to tell how much we have succeeded in preserving the tangible Heritage the Daniells illustrated. The Garden of the memorial was exquisitly designed on a total area of 57 acre with the building covering an area of 338 ft by 228 ft. On way to the north gate is a bronze statue of Queen Victoria by Sir George Frampton, R.A. The Queen is seated on her throne, wearing the robes of the Star of India. Approaching the building from the south, visitors pass the King Edward VII memorial arch with a bronze equestrian statue of the King by Sir Bertram Mackennal surmounting it and a marble statue of Lord Curzon by F.W. Pomeroy, R.A. There are also other statues of various dignitaries like Lord Bentinck, Governor- General of India (1828-1835), Lord Ripon (Governor- General of India from 1880 to 1884; the statue of Sir Rajendranath Mookerjee, the pioneer industrialist of Bengal is on the eastern side. There are twenty one gardeners to maintain the garden. Many morning walkers use this garden. The morning walkers have four associations. But the authority of the memorial has no official link with these associations.\n\nVictoria Memorial is neither a World Heritage Site nor a Monument of National Importance. But without doubt, it is the most visited monument in Kolkata and one of the most visited monuments in the country eventhough the managing is not done by any government agency. As I mentioned in my previous posts, I have been at Kolkata airport on my return journey from Assam. I spent around two hours at the airport and had a sandwich and a cup of coffee from a shop there. There was also a smoking zone at the airport and there was an electronic switch to light the cigarette. It was the first time I went to the smoking zone in an airport so the lighting technique seemed entirely strange to me. My first landing in the state of West Bengal was restricted to the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Airport and there is a world outside the airport yet to explore. A full day can be planned in Kolkata city starting with the Victoria Memorial and then a ride across the Howrah bridge and few peaceful moments at the banks of the Ganges and not to miss a ride on India’s only tramway. After Kolkata, I can plan for a tour of Bishnupur and Santiniketan which are closer to UNESCO recognition. There are some historic monuments in the town of Gour which are still unknown to many. Then, I can move northeast to take the toy train to Darjeeling or make a road trip to Sikkim. That is a tour that can be really well planned and will require atleast 8-9 days to complete if Sikkim is included in the itinerary.\n\nWell, that’s all I have about the Victoria Memorial Hall. Now, coming to sports across the globe. Jersey have won the third round of Cricket World Cup Challenge League B by winning all except one match and have advanced to the 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier play-off. These will be the first matches played by Jersey with one day international status. Uganda finished on level in points with Jersey but ended up as runners-up on net run-rate. Hong Kong finished third and Kenya finished fourth while Italy while Italy and Bermuda have been relegated to the ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge play-off. India are touring Zimbabwe for three-match one day series. Netherlands are hosting Pakistan for three one day internationals. The test series between England and South Africa has commenced. New Zealand won the T20 international series against West Indies 2-1. Kuwait won the T20 international series against Bahrain 4-1. Oman will host the 2022 Asia Cup Qualifier featuring United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, Singapore and Kuwait. London Spirit are on top of the 2022 Hundred table after winning 4 out of 4 games played. Josh Inglis has been signed up by London Spirit and Tabraiz Shamsi has been signed as a part-time replacement for Rashid Khan by the Trent Rockets. Welsh Fire have signed Dwaine Pretorius while Birmingham Phoenix have signed Ben Dwarshuis as a replacement for injured Adam Milne. The 2022 Caribbean Premier League will commence at the end of this month. This year’s tournament too got an interesting field of overseas players taking part. The Trinbago Knightriders have retained Colin Munro, Tim Seifert, Seekkugge Prasanna and Ali Khan from their previous year’s squad and also signed up Maheesh Theekshana and Daryn Dupavillon. Defending champions St Kitts and Nevis Patriots have signed Wanindu Hasaranga, Dwaine Pretorius, Dewald Brevis, Izharulhaq Naveed and Qasim Akram. Last year’s runners-up Saint Lucia Kings have retained Faf du Plessis, Tim David and David Wiese and brought back in Scott Kuggeleijn, who missed last year’s tournament. Guyana Amazon Warriors have retained Imran Tahir and signed up Tabraiz Shamsi, Colin Ingram, Paul Stirling and Heinrich Klaasen and made a late addition in Shakib Al Hasan. Jamaica Tallawahs have been boosted by the signing of Mohammad Amir and have also retained Imad Wasim, Chris Green and Migael Pretorius. Sandeep Lamichhane also returns to the franchise after playing for Knightriders in the last season. Barbados Royals will be captained by David Miller and have also made a high-profile signing in Quinton de Kock, who will be playing his first Caribbean Premier League. The franchise have also signed up Mujeeb ur Rahman, Azam Khan, Corbin Bosch and Harry Tector. This year will also have a schedule clash between the CSA T20 League, Big Bash League, International League T20 and Bangladesh Premier League, which will be followed by the Pakistan Super League and the Indian Premier League. The Lanka Premier League is also scheduled to take place in December after being postponed due to the political tensions in the country. The MI Cape Town owned by the Mumbai Indians were the first franchise to announce their signings for the CSA T20 League. The franchise have signed up high-profile names in Rashid Khan, Liam Livingstone, Sam Curran, Kagiso Rabada and Dewald Brevis. The Durban franchise owned by the owners of the Lucknow Supergiants have signed up Quinton de Kock, Jason Holder, Kyle Mayers, Reece Topley and Prenelan Subrayen. Paarl Royals owned by the owners of the Rajasthan Royals have unsurprisingly signed up Jos Buttler along with David Miller, Obed McCoy and Corbin Bosch. Pretoria Capitals owned by the owners of the Delhi Capitals franchise have signed up Anrich Nortje and Migael Pretorius. Johannesburg Superkings owned by India Cements who also owns the Chennai Superkings brought in Faf du Plessis along with Moeen Ali, Maheesh Theekshana, Romario Shepherd and Gerald Coetzee. Sunrisers Eastern Cape owned by Sun TV who owns the Sunrisers Hyderabad have signed up Aiden Markaram and Ottniel Baartman. Three franchises have also announced their signings for the International League T20 which I’ll share in the next post. Let me share the draw for the play-off round of the 2022-23 UEFA Champions League which will determine the final 6 teams who will qualify for the group stage:\n\nChampions Path\n\nQarabağ (Azerbaijan) vs Viktoria Plzeň (Czech Republic)\n\nBodø/Glimt (Norway) vs Dinamo Zagreb (Croatia)\n\nMaccabi Haifa (Israel) vs Red Star Belgrade (Serbia)\n\nCopenhagen (Denmark) vs Trabzonspor (Turkey)\n\nLeague Path\n\nDynamo Kyiv (Ukraine) vs Benfica (Portugal)\n\nRangers (Scotland) vs PSV Eindhoven (Netherlands)\n\nLooks like a completely unpredictable draw from my end with Bodø/Glimt yet to make their debut at the big stage.\n\nWell, that’s all I have for the day. Thus, we have completed another journey to West Bengal to visit the symbol of the Kolkata, the Victoria Memorial Hall. Of course, there is no other monument which comes into a traveler’s mind when we think about the City of Joy. The choice of going to West Bengal was something which came to my mind randomly. We’ve been traveling through Maharashtra, Goa, Delhi, Bihar, Odisha, Punjab, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh and Rajasthan in our previous blog posts and a journey to Eastern India again was a random choice. That means we’ve missed to cover Central and Southern India on our blog for quite sometime which means our next blog post should be to any of these regions giving importance to diversity and culture of all regions. There are still a lot of must-visit monuments we haven’t covered in these states. Eventhough Central India geographically includes only the states of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh we can also consider parts of Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra which are adjacent to these states as part of the region in case our minds run out of possible destinations to cover as culture remains similar in the neighboring regions as well. At times, Rajasthan can also be considered as part of Central India due to its geographical border and cultural similarities with Madhya Pradesh. In that case, we have just returned from a tour of Central India and moved to Eastern India. Still, we can think for another journey to Central India in the form of another monument or group of monuments or to my favorite South. When I say the culture of one particular state has been adapted by the bordering districts of the neighboring state, there are many examples which I would like to point out to prove this point. Marathi is spoken in the border districts of Karnataka like Bidar, Kalaburagi, Belagavi and Vijayapura. Likewise, Telugu and Tamil are also widely spoken in some border districts of Karnataka. I got many friends from Karnataka and Tamil Nadu who speak Telugu fluently just like speaking Kannada and Tamil. When I’m trying to speak more in Kannada and Tamil, I’ve now got the additional challenge of learning Telugu too. I’m coming from a state where no other language other than Malayalam, English and Hindi is included in school syllabus commonly. My school luckily had the additional choice of Sanskrit so I skipped Hindi after my eighth grade and after tenth, I learned no other language other than English. I’ve started speaking in Hindi more when I got into traveling and Kannada and Tamil while moving to Bangalore and Chennai for job purposes. Not to forget, Assamese and Bengali are also similar in dialect. You would be wondering why I mentioned this now without knowing to talk any of these languages. What to do since returning from Assam I’m much more addicted to Assamese culture and want to go there once again if possible during the time of Rasaleela festival in Majuli. I have mentioned that there was a reason why the post was not published over the weekend. I can say it in a simple way why it was delayed. A new friendship in my company and an opportunity that was handed over to me that can enhance my skills was the only reason why the post couldn’t be published over the weekend. In fact, that can also be a stepping stone to enhance the reach of the globe. Some friends arrive late in our life but will then be crucial in motivating us enhancing our career. I can say that this friendship that is just two weeks old has motivated me a lot and also made me realise how I can utilise my skills. I hope I get more ideas and motivation through my new friendships. Thank you once again for all the feedback and support you have given for the blog. Requesting you to stay safe and make the use of masks and sanitisers a must in your daily life and also get vaccinated atleast with two doses in case you haven’t. For now, keep calm and take a walk through the vicinity of the Victoria Memorial."
