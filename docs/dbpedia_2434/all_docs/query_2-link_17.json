        "text": "Orphanage in Telangana, India\n\nVictoria Memorial Home or Yateem Khana-e-Victoria, officially known as Victorial Memorial Home Residential High School is a historic school and orphanage located in Saroornagar in Hyderabad in the Indian state of Telangana.[1][2]\n\nIt is housed in Saroornagar Palace, a palace of the Nizam of Hyderabad. The building is located 70-acre campus, located close to the Victoria Memorial metro station.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Nizam of Hyderabad, Mahboob Ali Khan, had drawings made for a hunting lodge as early as 1882.[3] The building was completed in 1903. However, the Nizam abandoned the palace on account of a superstition, as he fell ill soon after visiting the unfinished palace.[4][5] The building remained deserted for a some time.\n\nIn 1904, on occasion of the death of Queen Victoria, the British Resident asked the Nizam to set up an institute in her memory.[6] The latter issued a royal firman to set up the Victoria Memorial Orphanage at the Saroornagar Palace.[7] The orphanage opened officially on 14 February 1905.[3] In 1953, the word \"orphanage\" was replaced by \"home\" due to a request by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.[6]\n\nIn 2017, the government announced a plan to hand over a part of the orphanage to house the Rachakonda Police Commissionerate.[7] This resulted in widespread controversy and a case was filed in the High Court against the government.[8][9] Several activists including Mir Najaf Ali Khan protested against the shift.[10]\n\nBuilding\n\n[edit]\n\nThe building is rectangular in shape, with a length of 420 feet and breadth of 285 feet.[6] It has two floors. It is surrounded by thick greenery. It has an arched entrance, and high-ceilinged large rooms.[3]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
