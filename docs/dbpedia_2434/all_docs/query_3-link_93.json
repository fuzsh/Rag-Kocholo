        "text": "From a distance, the new temporary commission at the Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall, seems like any other public fountain, with sculptures adorning each level, with a pool below surrounded by people. Up close however it gets clearer that this is not the ordinary monument one sees in public squares. The lowest level, in the pool, there are a number of sharks with their jaws open wide and out of the water. One of them leans over a sinking boat with a figure in it struggling to survive. On the second level, the plinths on four sides of the fountain, are figures unlike any other classical-style sculptures seen on most public monuments. There is a seated army man, a pleading man, an overjoyed woman with a man crouching and possibly the most horrifying of images, a tree with a noose hanging down.\n\nAbove all of these, stands the monumental figure of a woman with her arms spread out. This is the new artwork by American contemporary artist Kara Walker, titled Fons Americanus. Walker has worked extensively to shed light on histories of race, gender and identities, particularly of African and diaspora communities. Walker upturns the commemorative spectacle of public monuments by evoking popular images of the Transatlantic slave trade, a major economic source for the wealth of the empire.\n\nThe work was inspired by the Victoria Memorial outside Buckingham Palace in London, built between 1911 to 1924 by Thomas Brock, as a memorial to Victoria after her death in 1901. Around this period (late 19th and early 20th century), during the height of the empire, public sculptures of the Queen emerged across England and the colonies (Martin, 2014). They functioned as tools ‘reinforcing symbolic meanings about imperial power, national aspirations and exemplary heroic achievement’ (Edensor, 2019). Over time, the meaning of these memorials change, sometimes they become completely obsolete, and at other times, an uncomfortable reminder of the actions of the people they represent. The Victoria Memorial is neither. It is situated in one of London’s most popular tourist sites, constantly crowded with tourists and passersby. Nonetheless, it has not faced scrutiny to the same extent as the sculptures of Cecil Rhodes, despite being perhaps the most recognisable image of imperialism. Kara Walker’s allusion to this memorial presents an opportunity to question these public monuments. By comparing the four main figures of both the Victoria Memorial and Fons Americanus, we can disentangle what histories this monument celebrates, what it hides and how we can interpret its colonial past today.\n\nThe facade of the monument facing The Mall features a marble sculpture of the seated Queen, dressed in royal robes, holding the Crown Jewels. Similar to this seated Victoria, the sculpture of the seated army man, The Captain, faces the entrance of the Turbine Hall. This sculpture pays tribute to the ‘real-life heroes’ of rebellions against colonisers such as François-Dominique L’Ouverture, the leader of the Haitian Revolution and the controversial Pan-Africanist, Marcus Garvey (Tate, 2019). In contrast to the strict realism of Victoria’s sculpture, this composite of numerous leaders symbolises the complex nature of rebellions against colonialism.\n\nDuring the years of Victoria’s reign, especially her jubilee and her death, there were several similar sculptures built of the seated Victoria. Yet this one is unique primarily as it sits within an assemblage of allegories that represent her personally and as a ruler. In the Fons Americanus, Walker carves, in place of these, monumental sculptures that unravel this cult of personality around Victoria and Victorian values of empire. At the back of the memorial, facing Buckingham Palace is a statue featuring a woman with children around her. Titled Motherhood, this sculpture alludes to the Queen’s role as a mother, as well as notions of motherhood and fraternity of the Empire (Smith, 2017). In contrast, Walker’s sculpture Queen Vicky is animate and laughing, unlike any portrait of Victoria. In her hands she holds a coconut, the ‘symbol for life and sustenance’ but crouching near her feet is the figure of Melancholy (Tate, 2019). While Walker contrasts this image to the seated Queen, this assemblage has meanings for the image of motherhood as well. Sustenance of the empire was based on the invisible suffering of the colonised, through subjugation and inequality, which shatters the image of a fraternity under the maternal reign of Victoria.\n\nOn either side of this are sculptures of Justice and Truth, values commonly associated with Victoria and upheld during Victorian times. On the left of The Captain in Walker’s memorial, is a statue of a tree with a noose hanging from it, representing lynchings that were a common feature during colonial slavery. This single powerful image evokes the violence of colonialism and shakes the foundations of these values of Justice and Truth. The figure of a Kneeling Man on the right of The Captain, supposedly a coloniser pleading for mercy after the rebellions, similarly plays with these values. Given the implicit forms of inequality, racism and injustice suffered by marginal groups even today, have colonisers really been remorseful or have they merely found new modes of domination?\n\nThrough symbols, the Victoria Memorial serves not only as a reminder of Queen Victoria herself, but colonial rule as a whole. The statue stands strategically at the end of The Mall, an important site with a history of celebrating anniversaries, jubilees and other significant political events. The execution of the memorial was intrinsically linked to a wider urban planning project to rebuild The Mall and connect Trafalgar Square and Charing Cross to raise the status of London to other European capitals such as Paris and Rome (Smith, 2017). It placed Buckingham Palace at the heart of London and through its symbolism, at the heart of imperialism. Despite its close links to the imperial project and its reinforcement of it, it is overlooked as a contentious monument. Walker’s Fons acts as an interesting comparison to highlight particular histories that have been hidden by the grandeur of this elaborate structure and at the same time identify the insubstantiality of those that it celebrates. It stresses the great urgency to reassess our interaction with monuments as this statue potentially perpetuates ideas of imperialism and excludes alternative histories to its interpretation. This is not to place the Victoria Memorial in the same category as Rhodes, nor to suggest its demolition. Rather it is to repurpose the statue and its setting as foci for raising awareness around the nuanced histories of Victoria and the Empire.\n\nby Laharee Mitra\n\nLaharee is a postgraduate student currently pursuing her MA in Anthropology and Museum Practice, in Goldsmiths.
