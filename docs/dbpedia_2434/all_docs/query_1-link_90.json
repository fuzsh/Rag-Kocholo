        "text": "Constructed in 1904, this stately building features a distinctive green copper roof and walls of boulder stones that came from the riverbed just south of the Horseshoe Falls. Over the decades, the structure of Queen Victoria Place was remodeled several times, but much of the original material still exists.\n\nIn its early years, the building served as the former residence of the Commissioners of Niagara Parks. It also featured an open picnic area and popular dance hall. Today, this modern yet rustic restaurant offers a locally sourced menu, Niagara VQA wine list and diverse craft beer selection.\n\nFrom a young age, Chef Matt Hemmingsen knew his passion for creation would lead him to the kitchen. Coming from a long line of chefs, as a young child he admired his grandmother's cooking skills, watching her prepare delicate meals while working as a chef on lake boats. There, Chef Hemmingsen fell in love with creating new flavours, exploring unique ingredients, food combinations and in general the joy of cooking.\n\nNiagara born and trained, Chef Hemmingsen prides himself in showcasing the fantastic local and seasonal ingredients from the Niagara region. He holds fond childhood memories of picking vegetables and fruits on his family’s farm. Being around food his whole life provided him with a true appreciation for the ingredients he works with, which he translates into fresh and flavourful culinary masterpieces.\n\nAs a graduate of Niagara College’s Culinary Management course, he has always been passionate about growing within the community, industry and region. From his time spent at Cherry Hill Country Club to Peninsula Ridge Estates Winery, he has continually taken in all the offerings of Niagara’s greenbelt. While apprenticing at Rinderlin’s Dining Room, he took his skills to the next level, learning a classical and European take on cooking, working with many of the best chefs of Niagara. To this day, he loves to marry those old-world concepts with modern techniques and above all else, regional product."
