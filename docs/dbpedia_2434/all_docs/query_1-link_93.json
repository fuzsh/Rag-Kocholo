However if your condition is not urgent, you may be asked to call NHS 111 to book an appointment.\n\nThis is to help us to maintain a safe waiting area for patients and staff.\n\nPlease note the entrance to the UTC has temporarily moved, please look for signs as you enter the hospital.\n\nWard name(s)\n\nElizabeth Ward\n\nMatron\n\nJoanne Drury\n\nWard sister(s)\n\nFiona May, Angela McGill and Damilola Adesina\n\nConsultant\n\nDr Phillip Brighton\n\nPhone numbers\n\nWard telephone number 01304 865439\n\nVisiting times\n\nVisiting will be between 1pm and 8pm to protect lunchtime meals, although we can be flexible for morning visits if relatives want to provide care for patients.\n\nPatients are allowed two visitors at a time at the bedside, but in special circumstances we will allow more, please speak to the matron.

A key part of your recovery will include getting up and dressed each day so please make sure you have day clothes and suitable shoes with you along with any items you may need for your personal care. During your stay we hope you will also be able to enjoy some of our activities which will help your recovery, progress and well-being.\n\nThe MDT will work together with you, your family and carers to make sure all support is in place prior to your discharge from us.\n\nWe would encourage and welcome your family, friends and carers to visit you while you are with us.\n\nOn admission, you and your family will be provided with more detailed information about your care and all staff will be available to discuss any queries you may have during your stay with us.\n\nThe team on Elizabeth Ward takes pride in delivering high quality care for our patients.
