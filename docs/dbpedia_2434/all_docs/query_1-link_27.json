While in this vicinity a most terrible epidemic of cholera raged in the ranks of the army. Men suffered and died in agony, their bodies were laid in the consecrated earth of Memorial Square, Victoria's oldest cemetery.\n\nThe Victoria City Council of 1854, being especially solicitous of the health of the township, provided in an authorized purchase from Mrs. Ryan, late McCrabb, a tract of land adjoining the Widow Harrison above containing about twenty-seven acres, provided it can be obtained for $300, said land to be used for a graveyard.\n\nPeople still clung to the old cemetery, and in many instances buried their dead there in preference to the newly purchased grounds. Many of the Confederate soldiers who gave their lives in the War between the States were transported to Victoria to be given up to the cemetery. Some of these veterans were sons of Victoria. Others, however, were not residents of the township.\n\nTown Ownership"
