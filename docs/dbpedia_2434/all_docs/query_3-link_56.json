        "text": "This phase of the community engagement process started in February 2022. During this phase, the City worked with residents and stakeholders to confirm the Drivers of Change and define an overall vision for the park improvements, including a series of Design Principles, which will guide the development of design options in Phase 2.\n\nDownload the Phase 1B summary report.\n\nPhase Outcome: Confirmed Drivers of Change, Draft Vision Statement and Draft Design Principles\n\nConfirmed Drivers of Change\n\nA rich colonial history\n\nVictoria Memorial Square is a unique park site with a rich cultural heritage that dates back to the founding of the city of York. It is part of the Fort York National Historic Site and the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District and is the site of Toronto’s first settler cemetery, which includes burials of military personnel and their family members. There is an opportunity to further enhance the heritage of this site while bringing forward new heritage interpretations.\n\nA rich Indigenous history\n\nVictoria Memorial Square is a site steeped in colonial history, but the story does not start there. There is also a rich and ancient Indigenous history to the site that is tied to its adjacency to Taddle Creek and the former Lake Ontario shoreline, in addition to the roles of First Nations in the War of 1812. This presence is not adequately represented in the current space.\n\nA protected commemorative landscape\n\nDespite its heritage significance, the park has become damaged and spoiled by heavy use. In addition, many of the graves are relatively shallow, and are at constant risk of being compromised by dog activity. The park improvements must preserve and protect the site’s historic cemetery and other heritage resources from further deterioration and should reflect respect for the importance of this commemorative landscape.\n\nA growing and evolving neighbourhood\n\nThe neighbourhood surrounding the park has seen dramatic increases in population growth in recent years, thanks to new development. There is a need for the park to support changing demographics as well as intensified use in this rapidly-changing area of the city. This will mean making park improvements that allow for a wider range of uses at various times of the day, and that are durable, sustainable and can withstand high traffic usage patterns.\n\nOut-of-balance park uses\n\nAs the community has grown around the park, the balance of users has changed. This has led to conflicts between user groups, including dogs and their owners, children and their caregivers and others who use the space as a place to rest or hang out. There is a need for park improvements that enhance the existing park programs through the lenses of inclusivity, safety and accessibility to ensure that all park users are able to enjoy this public space.\n\nReview the draft Drivers of Change under Phase 1A.\n\nDraft Vision Statement\n\nVictoria Memorial Square is a green oasis and cultural gem in a fast-changing neighbourhood. It is valued as both a meeting place and a sanctuary: a cozy place to retreat to; a place to gather, sit and relax.\n\nThe park works well for a lot of different people: families picnicking, friends relaxing, people walking their pets, and so many others just passing through. It’s an inclusive, accessible, clean and safe place for everyone.\n\nThe park is also a place of discovery that both honours and celebrates its rich heritage, from centuries of use by Indigenous people living in settlements along Garrison Creek and the Lake Ontario shoreline, to its colonial uses as a Military Cemetery, War of 1812 Memorial, and public park. The park’s role in the larger context of the historic Wellington Place plan, and its relationship to nearby Clarence Square via Wellington Street, is reflected in the enhanced park design.\n\nOther, more contemporary memorials are equally celebrated, including the park’s Jane Jacobs benches and tree and bench dedications.\n\nActivities or uses that might damage this cherished cultural heritage or disrupt the park’s delicate balance of users, including off-leash dog walking, are both managed and limited.\n\nDraft Design Principles\n\nBalance the needs of a wide range of users.\n\nManage and limit off leash dog use within the cemetery and park.\n\nEnsure a healthy and thriving tree canopy and landscape.\n\nIntegrate and celebrate Indigenous placekeeping into the heritage narrative and park design.\n\nPreserve and celebrate the colonial heritage including the Military Cemetery and War of 1812 Memorial.\n\nPreserve and celebrate the contemporary heritage of the park including the Jane Jacobs benches, memorial benches and trees.\n\nRecognize and tie the park restoration design to the Wellington Street revitalization and Clarence Square.\n\nEnsure the park is well lit and safe and feature lighting is integrated to amplify the cultural heritage elements.\n\nIntegrate heritage interpretation at key entrances and within the park.\n\nInclude green space and plantings to create an oasis where people can relax and lounge in a place of respite.\n\nIntegrate a variety of seating types to make this a welcoming and accessible space where people can hang out and gather.\n\nProvide park infrastructure that can withstand increased pressure due to growing population and future transit infrastructure and development coming to the area.\n\nCommunity Engagement Meetings and Events\n\nMarch 2023\n\nDesign Charrette\n\nOn March 7, the project team hosted a design charrette with the ten members of the Community Advisory Committee at Fort York Public Library. The purpose of the charrette was to convene community members to actively generate and explore ideas that are reflective of the feedback received through the broader community engagement that has taken place so far and that could inform the park improvement options moving forward.\n\nThought Exchange Activity\n\nFrom February 16 to March 1, the project team ran an online thought exchange activity where participants were able to share their vision for the park and rate the ideas of others. The thought exchange received 188 thoughts and 8,500 ratings from 270 participants of various ages and backgrounds.\n\nThe thoughts were organized into 15 themes. Ranked by the average rating of thoughts within each theme, referred to as the star score, the themes were:"
