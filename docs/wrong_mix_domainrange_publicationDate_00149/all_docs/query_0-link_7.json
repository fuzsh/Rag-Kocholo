        "text": "Find out more about Episode 36 of the Read Literature podcast on the episode page.\n\nLink to listen\n\nNotes and sources\n\nWays to support the podcast\n\nThis is Read Japanese Literature. My name is Alison Fincher. Read Japanese Literature is a podcast about Japanese fiction and some of its best works. All the works we discuss are available in translation, so you can read along if you want. You can find out more at ReadJapaneseLiterature.com.\n\nThis is the last episode of season three. Summer break makes it just too hard to get episodes out in June and July—though I might try to release a “mini-episode” or two.\n\nBut I hope you’ll join us again for season four in August. If you’d like some input into what topics RJL covers next season, please hang out through the end of the episode, chat with us on social media, or join our Patreon at patreon.com/readjapaneseliterature.\n\nDr. John Lie is a professor of sociology at the University of California, Berkeley. He is also one of the most prolific scholarly voices on Koreans in Japan available in English. And he is the editor of Zainichi Literature: Japanese Writings by Ethnic Koreans.\n\nLee was born in 1959 in Seoul, South Korea, but he grew up in first Tokyo and then Hawaii.\n\nIn a 2009 article, Lee describes his experiences as a Korean student in a Japanese primary school in the 1960s:\n\nI was routinely teased and occasionally beaten up by my classmates. My Koreanness—most obviously, my Korean name, and possibly my accent—was almost always the proximate [meaning immediate or most obvious] cause for bullying. Teachers and other adults largely feigned ignorance.\n\nCertainly, I was deviant by dint of my ethnic background, which in turn signified cultural inferiority.\n\nHe continues, “My experience was far from unique.”\n\nBut Lie goes on to talk about a conversation with a cousin who then lived in Japan in 2009; he asks his cousin about “how his children were faring in Japanese public schools”.\n\nHis cousin’s children weren’t ever bullied because of their ethnic background. And his cousin himself is a professor at a major Japanese university. That would have been an impossibility in the 60s when Lee lived in Japan.\n\nToday’s episode is about the stories of Koreans in Japan like Lie, although we’ll be focusing more on a particular group of Koreans in Japan whose parents or grand-parents or even great-grand-parents arrived before the end of WWII—often or usually called Zainichi Koreans.\n\nWe’ll start by looking at the history of the relationship between Japan and Korea—and especially between the end of the Meiji Restoration and today.\n\nWe’ll move on to the stories of Koreans in Japan—their literature. The literature of Koreans in Japan is rich and rarely talked about in English. We’ll take a look at the history of literature by Koreans in Japan as well as a few of its famous authors. And we’ll move on to some of Japan’s most famous contemporary Koran voices. These, it turns out are the authors most represented in English translation.\n\nFinally, we’ll zoom in on the work of writer Kazuki Kaneshiro and his award-winning novel Go. It’s a semi-autobiographical work about the experience of growing up Zainichi Korean in Japan. Translator Takami Nieda has given some insightful interviews about why she chose to translate the book, so I’m excited to be able to talk about her work and her experiences translating, too.\n\nTwo quick notes about names before we begin.\n\nFirst, a note about group names.\n\nIn English, we tend to use the term “Zainichi” pretty loosely to mean “Korean person living in Japan. First of all, Zainichi doesn’t even mean Korean; it means “(non-Japanese) resident in Japan”. Secondly, even Zainichi Korean most specifically applies to a particular group of Koreans in Japan.\n\nThere are a variety of names to describe the different groups and subgroups of Koreans in Japan in both English and Japanese. if you want a really careful overview of the different terms applied to Koreans in Japan over the past 140 years, you can read Sonia Ryang’s introduction to Diaspora without Homeland: Being Korean in Japan. It’s available for free online. There’s a link on the episode page. That book was really helpful putting together this episode.\n\nSecond, a note about personal names: You probably know that Japanese people with Japanese names in Japan list their family name first and their given name second.\n\nIn the English publishing world, though, we tend to reverse the name order so the names look more like English names.\n\nYou may not know that Japanese is, I believe, the only Asian language where English publishers routinely “reverse” an author’s name order.\n\nThe names of Zainichi Korean writers are complicated.\n\nFirst, keep in mind that between 1945 and, say, 2000—but even still today—the name a Korean person in Japan uses is both extremely personal and extremely political.\n\nWe’ll talk a little bit about Koreans and “passing” in Japan. As John Lie explains, the choice for a Korean person in Japan to use a Korean name is a choice to “consciously assert ethnic distinction”.\n\nZainichi writers often went by several names in both their personal lives and in print. Zainichi Korean writers sometimes use their Korean names. Sometimes that means taking the sounds of their Korean names and pronouncing their names as though they are Japanese or writing them in kana.\n\nThe pattern of “reversing” Japanese names doesn’t always hold for non-ethnically Japanese people writing in Japanese—especially when their names clearly mark their ethnicity as “not” Japanese, their name isn’t reversed. When their names clearly mark their ethnicity as not Japanese, the name isn’t reversed.\n\nFor example, Yu Miri. Yu is the family name. Miri is the given name. The cover of Tokyo Ueno Station identifies the author as Yu Miri and not Miri Yu.\n\nSome Zainichi Korean writers take Japanese names or only have Japanese names. As far as Kazuki Kaneshiro… family name Kaneshiro, and his given name Kazuki. If he has a Korean name, it is not a name he uses professionally or one that is widely disseminated. These names are treated like any other Japanese name, so they are usually reversed on the cover of English-language translations. The cover of his novel Go identifies the author as Kazuki Kaneshiro.\n\n(It turns out that I recorded way too much history for a 45 minute episode, so Patreon supporters get all that extra history as bonus content. Again, you can learn more by listening on the Patreon site or reading the transcript for as little as $3 a month: patreon.com/readjapaneseliterature.)\n\nThe story of modern Japanese involvement in Korea begins, as so many things do, with the Meiji Restoration.\n\nOn July 8, 1853, US Commodore Matthew Perry sailed 4 into Tokyo Harbor. The end result was that the Tokugawa government was more-or-less forced to sign what came to be known as the “unequal treaties.”\n\nThere are many reasons for the collapse of the shogunate in Japan, but the opening of some of Japan’s ports and the unequal treaties were more-or-less the final nails in the coffin. If you’d like more information about the Meiji Restoration, check out our season one episode Meiji Literature & Japan’s Most Famous Literary Cat.\n\nJapan was not pleased about the terms of the unequal treaties. It also looked around eastern Asia with apprehension—so many of their neighbors had fallen to Western Imperialism. To significantly oversimplify, many of the leaders of the Japanese military saw the consequences of European imperial expansion and adopted the attitude that “if you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em.”\n\n(That’s not to say that the Japanese had not come up with the idea of imperial expansion themselves. Toyotomi Hideyoshi had already tried to establish a colony in Korea in the late 16th century.)\n\nLess than a decade after the Meiji Restoration—barely more than two decades after Japan was on the losing end of unequal treaties of its own—Japan coerced Korea into signing a treaty that gave Japan extraordinary powers in Korean affairs. By 1905, Korea was a Japanese protectorate. In 1910, Japan absorbed Korea as a colony.\n\nI could give you a lot of information about the brutality and repression of Japan’s colonial presence in Korea. It would be outside of our scope today. However, I can recommend Yu Miri’s novel, The End of August, translated by Morgan Giles, as an excellent fictional response to this period of Korean history by a Zainichi Korean author and based on her own family’s history.\n\nStarting around 1900, small numbers of Koreans began immigrating to Japan in search of economic opportunities. By 1910, when Japan annexed Korea, there were about 2500 Koreans already living in Japan—mostly in Osaka and Tokyo.\n\nSome of the most affluent Koreans came to Japan because Tokyo was the best place to pursue a university education.\n\nThe 1910 annexation had caused a dramatic acceleration in immigration from Korea. By the late 1920s, the population of Koreans in Japan was increasing by as much as 100,000 people a year. There were about 419,000 Koreans living in Japan’s main islands by 1930.\n\nThe pace of immigration picked up even more as hostilities opened in the Pacific War. Often immigration was no longer a choice. Japan conscripted Korean laborers and even soldiers. This includes the “comfort women” the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces forced into sexual slavery.\n\nBy the time WWII ended and Korea was no longer a Japanese colony, there were about 2 million Korean people living in Japan.\n\nLife for Koreans living in Japan in the first half of the 20th century hadn’t been easy. They tended to live in poorer areas, working dangerous and badly-paying jobs.\n\nThey also faced racism and racially-motivated discrimination.\n\nOne of the most egregious examples of anti-Koreans racism—and its truly terrible consequences—is the response to the 1923 Great Kanto earthquake. On September 1, 1923, a 7.9 magnitude earthquake struck the area around Tokyo. Between the quake itself and the fires, as many as 150,000 people may have died.\n\nFalse rumors spread that armed Koreans were committing arson and robbery. That they were plotting to take advantage of the chaos and start a rebellion. That there were even poisoning wells.\n\nTokyo residents organized nearly 3000 vigilante groups that were supposed to keep order. The actual result was mobs violence—mobs beating and murdering huge numbers of people in the street. The police and military rounded up several hundred Koreans or suspected Koreans and murdered somewhere between 30-90 themselves. Some of those killed included people mistaken for Koreans—Chinese, Ryukyuans, or Japanese speakers of regional dialects. The total number of people killed was probably between 2,600 and 6,600 people who were either Korean or accused of being Korean.\n\nAgain, at the end of WWII, there were about 2 million Koreans living in Japan. The overwhelming majority of ethnic Koreans quickly returned to the Korean archipelago, but about 600,000 remained in Japan.\n\nIt’s important to keep in mind, that many of these 600,000 Koreans still in Japan after WWII expected to return to Korea eventually. The expectation that they would return home eventually shaped a generation or more of the culture and politics of Koreans in Japan. We’ll discuss that a little more in the next section of the episode.\n\nThese Koreans also left Japan—and US Occupation officials—in something of a quandary. To what nation did they actually belong?\n\nAs long as Korea had been a Japanese colony—up until 1945—Koreans had been considered citizens of Imperial Japan.\n\nThe political situation of those people changed rapidly after 1945. The American Occupation of Japan continued from 1945 until the signing of the 1952 San Francisco Peace Treaty. Between 1945 and 1952, Koreans in Japan lived in an odd “in-between” space. They really got the “worst-of-both” sets of political rights as both “Japanese” and “not Japanese”.\n\nThey could be tried as Japanese war criminals, but they couldn’t vote anymore because they weren’t Japanese citizens.\n\nBy 1947, all Koreans remaining in Japan had to register as legal aliens.\n\nAfter 1952, there was no more “in-between” about it. Koreans in Japan were entirely Korean—stripped of almost all political rights in Japan. Because neither North nor South Korea had formal relations with Japan, Koreans in Japan were effectively stateless. It wasn’t until 1965 that Japan and South Korea normalized relations. And so it wasn’t until 1965 that Koreans in Japan who opted for South Korean citizenship could at least apply for permanent resident status in Japan.\n\nFrom the 1950s through the 1980s, Koreans in Japan were mostly shut out of public life in Japan. They couldn’t vote or hold government positions. They couldn’t receive public benefits. They weren’t hired for prestigious jobs. Koreans in Japan were required to submit their fingerprints to the police and carry a passbook with their fingerprints in it at all times! They faced police harassment…\n\nEspecially in the 1960s and 70s, many Zainichi coped by trying to pass (try to be perceived as) Japanese. Many Koreans could pass by adapting a Japanese name, and this became an extremely contentious issue in the Zainichi community. Blackmail was also rampant. Anyone trying to pass as Japanese might feel the need to constantly look over their shoulder.\n\nThe suicide rates among Zainichi was alarmingly high.\n\nA lot of the conditions of life for Koreans in Japan in the second half of the 20th century are the specific focus of Zainichi writers, especially in Kazuki Kaneshiro’s Go, so we’ll take a look at this history again in just a few minutes. For now, let me skip forward a little bit to how the situation began to change for Koreans in Japan.\n\nThe anti-fingerprinting movement was an important early and highly-public civil rights push among Zainichi Koreans. A Zainichi man named Han Chong-Sok refused to be fingerprinted in 1980. He was convicted and fined, but he helped start a movement that contributed to the policy’s eventual repeal in 1993.\n\nThe movement toward democratic government in South Korea at the end of the 1980s and then the 1988 Seoul Olympics began to change Japanese perception about Korea—or at least South Korea. A renewed flow of immigration from South Korea in the 1980s also changed the cultural narrative about what it means to be Zainichi in Japan.\n\nIn 1992, all Koreans in Japan who could prove their families had been in the country since the colonial period were granted tokubetsu eijūsha—special permanent resident status.It’s worth noting, though, that special permanency resident status isn’t like, say, an American green card. This isn’t a step along the road to full Japanese citizenship. It is actually a permanent resident status.\n\nSo, as we learned from John Lie’s experience as related at the beginning of the episode, things have really changed for Koreans in Japan over the course of the last few decades. Some prejudices remain. Much trauma still remains. But the experience of younger Koreans really is very different that what was lived by their parents and grandparents.\n\nAs of 2010, about 600,000 ethnically Korean people live[d] in Japan under a variety of legal and residential categories. Most of them still held “special permanent resident status”. There remained 5,000 Koreans who weren’t affiliated with South Korea and were effectively stateless.\n\nThere are two major anthologies of work by Zainichi Koreans available in English:\n\nThe first is an anthology called Into the Light: An Anthology of Literature by Koreans in Japan, edited by Melissa Wender—she’s a former Harvard University professor who was teaching English as a second language at a Boston high school when the book was published in 2010.\n\nThe second anthology is Zainichi Literature: Japanese Writings by Ethnic Koreans, edited, as I already mentioned, by John Lie. That one was published in 2018.\n\nThere are other anthologies of Japanese literature that include Zainichi Koreans, but these are the two anthologies of exclusively Zainichi Korean literature. I’m deeply indebted to both books—and to both Dr. Wender and Dr. Lie—for help understanding the history of Zainichi literature.\n\nSmall side note: I just mentioned the anthologies of Zainichi Korean literature. As far as I know, there are only six stand-alone works of prose fiction by Zainichi writers translated into English. They were written by a total of four authors: as their names appear on their book covers, Chesil, Kim Sok-Pom, Kazuki Kaneshrio, and Yu Miri. And they were translated into English by just four translators: Morgan Giles, Takami Nieda, Stephen Snyder, and Christina Yi. We’ll talk about these authors and these books as we move forward.\n\nJohn Lie points out that the broadest definition of Zainichi literature—something like “literary work by ethnic or diasporic Koreans in Japan”—includes some of the oldest work in the Japanese language. The famous 8th century poetry anthology, the Manyōshū, includes work by exiles from the Korean Peninsula.\n\nBut if we’re talking about modern literature by Koreans in Japan, it probably began with a man named Yi Kwang-su. He published a [short story] called Ai Ka? (“Is It Love?”) in 1909. It is a story about homoerotic desire “across ethnonational boundaries”. It, as you might expect, has not been translated [into English], at least to the best of my knowledge. [Correction: Janet Poole’s translation of “Is This Love?” appears in in Queer Subjects in Modern Japanese Literature: Male Love, Intimacy, and Erotics, 1886-2014, edited by Stephen D. Miller. “]\n\nThe earliest modern literature in Japanese by ethnic Korean writers didn’t look quite like writing later explicitly identified as Zainichi chōsenjin bungaku—that’s the Japanese for “Zainichi literature”. (The term “Zainichi literature” originated in the 1960s, as we’ll discuss. And, as we’ll discuss in a few minutes, “Zainichi literature” also has its own unique characteristics.)\n\nLet me introduce you to one important early Korean writer in Japan, Kim Sa-Ryang. I suppose his life isn’t in any way “typical” of an early Korean writer in Japan. He is one of the few who is still classified as a Korean writer in Japan even though he ended his career writing in Korean.\n\nKim was born in Korea in 1914, moved to Japan to attend Tokyo Imperial University in the 1930s… Kim was highly regarded by the Japanese bundan (the literary establishment), and his story “Into the Light” was even nominated for the Akutagawa Prize. (“Into the Light” appears in English in the anthology—shocking—Into the Light.) It tackles many of the issues of racism and prejudice that frequently come up in writing by Koreans in Japan. Nevertheless, I feel reasonably comfortable saying “Into the Light” is the most… optimistic?… hopeful?… story by an ethnically Korean writer in Japan that I’ve come across, with the exception, of today’s focus text, Go and perhaps Chesil’s The Color of the Sky Is the Shape of My Heart.\n\nAs the Pacific War intensified, Kim was arrested as a potential thought criminal and returned to Korea. He spent the rest of his life writing first anti-Japanese and then pro-Communist material in Korean. Starting in 1950, he worked as a war correspondent for the Korean People’s Army during what English-speakers call the Korean War. Most people think he died of heart disease on the battlefield later that year.\n\nMoving forward just a bit in the history of Zainichi literature…\n\nIt’s important to keep in mind that most Koreans in Japan immediately after WWII still assumed they would eventually return to the Korean Peninsula. We discussed that a bit a few minutes ago. That expectation of return is part of the reason the earliest post-WWII Korean writers called themselves Korean rather than Zainichi that identified themselves as residents in Japan. Writing by Korean Japanese also became more prominent after WWII. Minshu Chōsen, the first journal of writing by ethnic Koreans, and it published its first issue in 1946.\n\nAs I mentioned, the term Zainichi “Zainichi literature” originated in the 1960s, and the sort of “Zainichi identity” as something politically and culturally important became an even more powerful cultural force beginning in the 1970s. The shift toward specifically Zainichi literature came with a new journal for Korean writers in Japan—Kikan Sanzenri, launched in 1975. It was also marked by a shift from stories that took place in Korea to stories that took place in Japan.\n\nThe first Koreans writers in Japan were writing as Korean who happened to be in Japan. As we’ve mentioned, for the most part, expected to return home. The first very first of these writers were often (but not always) born in Korea. But by the 1970s, many Koreans in Japan had begun to accept they weren’t “only Korean and definitely not Japanese”, but they were Zainichi. They were Koreans living in Japan without an obvious path home—and this was going to be true, not just temporarily, for some indeterminate time.\n\nJohn Lie makes the very reasonable claim that the actual criterion for Zainichi literature—especially during the 60s, 70s… into the 80s—isn’t that it’s written by a Zainichi Korean, but that it “stems from a series of political and ideological orthodoxies”.\n\nThese orthodoxies include “a commitment to homeland”—regardless of how difficult the concept of “homeland” was for Zainichi Koreans in Japan in the 1960s and 70s and into the 80s. And they also include “a strong declaration of anticolonial and therefore anti-Japanese standpoints”.\n\nIn lieu of a comprehensive history of the 60s, 70s, and early 80s, I’m going to mention three important Zainichi writers from this period who have been translated into English.\n\nKim Tal-su’s work is available in both Into the Light and Zainichi Literature. As I mentioned, he is widely regarded as the “Father of Zainichi Korean Literature”. And he was nominated for the Akutagawa Prize in 1958.\n\nRi Kaisei is another important Zainichi writer. In 1972, Ri won the Akutagawa Prize for “The Woman Who Fulled Clothes”. He is the first Zainichi writer to win the Akutagawa Prize. (There’s a full English translation available of “The Woman Who Fulled Clothes”. It appears in the anthology Flowers of Fire: Twentieth-Century Korean Stories.)\n\nRi wasn’t the Zainichi Korean writer in Japan to be nominated for Japan’s prestigious literary award—I have mentioned several—but he was the first to win. His win caused a sort of retrospective consideration of Zainichi Korean writer by Japan’s bundan.\n\nBy the way, several Zainichi Korean writers have won since.\n\nLee Yangji won in 1988. There is a partial translation of her “Yuhi” in English.\n\nYū Miri won in 1996. Her award-winning Family Cinema has not been translated into English to the best of my knowledge, although some of her other work has.\n\nAnd Gen Getsu won in 1999 for A Place in the Shadows, which I don’t believe has been translated into English either.\n\nThe third author I want to mention is Kim Sok-pom. He is also one of those 5,000 or fewer Koreans in Japan who remains stateless. Kim’s work is sometimes considered atypical of Zainichi writing because a lot of it takes place, not in contemporary Japan, but in historical Korea instead of present-day Japan. He is famous for Japanese prose that “reads like a translation” and for his allegorical stories that explain what it meant to be Zainichi Korean in postwar Japan—even while they took place somewhere and somewhen else. His 1957 Death of the Crow was published alongside a few of his other stories in English translation by Christina Yi in 2022.\n\nBy the 1980s, the varieties of Zainichi experiences had begun to loosen the definition of “Zainichi Literature”. These writers were, obviously, mostly members of a younger generation. They included more women.\n\nThe work of these “New Zainichi” often includes Zainichi characters and/or Zainichi concerns, but in stories that are about something else. And it’s worth noting that even some older Zainichi writers whose careers stretched into the late 1980s and beyond began to adopt the same approach to their writing.\n\nWe’ve already spent some time on Yū Miri in the season two episode, Writing about Japan’s Have Nots. (A quick apology that I didn’t understand the nuances of Zainichi surnames at the time I recorded the episode.)\n\nYū was born in 1968. She grew up in Yokohama. Her father was the son of Korean immigrants to Japan. Yu’s mother wasn’t technically a Zainichi. She was a refugee from the Korean war.\n\nYu does not deny her Zainichi heritage, but it also hasn’t been a big part of her writing or public identity. Her novel, The End of August, is a notable exception. It’s a fictionalized version of her grandfather’s life under the Japanese occupation of Korea.\n\nYu’s more widely-read novel in English, Tokyo Ueno Station, is also about people outside of the mainstream of Japanese life. But in this case, though, not Zainichi but homeless people and people from the Tohoku region. That one was also translated into English by Morgan Giles.\n\nIt’s worth noting that deemphasizing her identity hasn’t protected her from racist vitriol. As much as the situation for Zainichi has improved in Japan, there is still racism that affects people who publicly own their Zainichi identity. Some bookstores have chosen to cancel events due to racially-motivated bomb threats against Yu.\n\nYū has also been described as “probably the first Zainichi Korean author to have achieved critical recognition, phenomenal popularity, and even a celebrity of sorts”. She’s also been called “the first Zainichi author that can be regarded as a trendsetter influencing mainstream Japanese society”. Her 1998 novel, Gold Rush, was the first ever full-length work of fiction by a Zainichi Korean author to appear in English. It was published in translation by Stephen Snyder in 2002.\n\nKazuki Kaneshiro. Kaneshiro is our featured author today—he’s our focus author today, so we’ll come back to him in just a minute. He wrote Go, which we’ll come back to in just a minute.\n\nAs far as I know, there’s only one more contemporary Zainichi Korean writer with a stand-alone book translated into English. In English, her name has been rendered as Chesil. Chesil wrote ジニのパズル (“Ginny’s Puzzle”). The title in English is The Color of the Sky Is the Shape of My Heart.\n\nKazuki Kaneshiro was born, like Yu Miri in 1968. He was born in Kawaguchi in Saitama Prefecture. Kawaguchi is part of the Tokyo Metropolis; it’s about 1:15 from central Tokyo by train.\n\nGrowing up, Kaneshiro was—like his parents—a North Korean citizen living in Japan. He attended an elementary and middle school affiliated with the organization Chongryon. Chongryon is that culturally important group for Koreans in Japan with ties to North Korea. Chongryon was highly influential in the lives of Koreans in Japan for decades. As Kaneshiro describes in Go, Chongryon schools teach many “North Korean values and norms” like reverence for Kim Il Sung and public self-criticism during the school day.\n\nIn middle school, Kaneshiro had a reputation as something of a bad boy—he was known for pachinko playing and drinking.\n\nBy the time he finished middle school, though, Kaneshiro’s father renounced the family’s North Korean citizenship. The entire Kaneshiro family became South Korean citizens. Kaneshiro enrolled at the public Hozen High School in Tokyo’s Shibuya Ward.\n\nBy his own admission, Kaneshiro draws on his own experiences for his work. In just a minute, I think you’ll recognize a bit of Kaneshiro’s life in the life of the protagonist of Go, Sugihara.\n\nAfter high school, Kaneshiro went on to study law at Keio University. He briefly dreamed of becoming a human rights lawyer But instead of going into law, he decided he wanted to tell stories. To hone his craft, he would read one book and watch two films a day in a variety of different genres.\n\nHe published his first book, Revolution No. 3, in 1998, and it won the Shosetsu Gendai Prize for New Writers. Revolution No. 3 has not been translated into English, nor has any of Kaneshiro’s other work.\n\nGo is Kaneshiro’s second novel. It was published in 2000. He wrote Go in just two weeks. It won the Naoki Prize. The Naoki Prize is a twice-annual award for “the best work of popular literature in any format by a new, rising, or (reasonably young) established author”. (It was established at the same time as the Akutagawa Prize. You can learn a bit more about it in the season two episode The Akutagawa Prize and Kobo Abe. I’d still like to devote an entire episode to the Naoki Prize…) The film adaptation of Go won every major award in Japan in 2002, the year it debuted.\n\nKaneshiro has written a total of six books, including Go. After Go, most of Kaneshiro’s books haven’t really touched on his Zainichi heritage. Three are part of his “Zombies Series”.\n\nToday, he is perhaps more of a screenwriter than a novelist. He has written the screen plays for several films based on his novels as well as TV dramas and movies.\n\nAlso like Yū Miri, Kaneshiro has a complicated relationship with his Zainichi heritage. He spent some time in his early adulthood thinking about an alternative identity—not Zainichi but “Korean Japanese”. In a 2006 article, he said he later abandoned the name “Korean Japanese” because people who settle into any labeled identity can’t escape from it. He followed up that those people end up like animals in a cage, and he hates cramped space.\n\nNevertheless, many of Kaneshiro characters are from groups that are outside of the mainstream of society, including Zainichi Koreans.\n\nTranslator Takami Nieda, who translated Go, says\n\nIn the past, Kaneshiro has resisted the category of ‘Zainichi writer’ and insists, like many young Zainichi of his generation, that his heritage is but a small part, and not a defining mark of his identity. And yet, issues of identity make subtle appearances in his later works”\n\nA quick side note for translation dorks like me—Takami Nieda actually got permission to translate Go through a Twitter exchange with Kaneshiro!\n\nIn just the third paragraph of Go, the protagonist, Sugihara clarifies, “The story that follows is a love story. My love story. And communism—or democratism, pacifism, otakuism, vegetarianism, or any other -ism for that matter—has got nothing to do with it. Just so you know”.\n\n(FYI, we won’t find out the protagonist’s name until page 12. Sugihara is a surname, and actually an alias at that. We don’t ever learn his first name. And we only learn his Korean name at the very end of the book.)\n\nIn some ways, it’s true that Go is a love story. Nevertheless, as you’ll see, the Sugihara family’s citizenship—especially the citizenship of Sugihara himself and the citizenship of his father—are at the center of the narrative. Sugihara’s citizenship is what causes the central conflict of the love story. And it is the motivation behind most of the secondary conflicts in the novel.\n\nSugihara’s father was born in southern Korea. His mother was born and raised in Japan to Korean parents. The entire family has North Korean citizenship as the novel opens.\n\nIt’s notable that Sugihara can’t even tell his own story without adding details about the way Japanese imperialism has affected his family and the way that Japanese prejudice against Zainichi Koreans has shaped his life. In fact, Sugihara is so… maybe burdened is the right word… by his family history that he feels forced to give us six pages of historical background before he can, finally, turn to himself and his love story. He gets to page six, and adds, “This isn’t a story about my father or mother, after all,” he reminds us on that sixth page.\n\nSugihara’s father was a Japanese citizen when he was growing up in Japan, when Korea was a Japanese colony.\n\nSugihara’s father eventually chose to become North Korean rather than South Korean because he believed in North Korea’s . He assumed the North would be more compassionate to the poor. The North—and this is historically true—the North also “showed more concern than the South Korean government for Koreans living in Japan”.\n\nGo’s “inciting event”—the event that makes the novel possible—is that Sugihara’s father and mother have decided to travel to Hawaii. They’ll need to change their citizenship because North Korean citizens aren’t admitted to the United States. So that’s what they do—the entire Sugihara family becomes South Korean. Now that his family is dropping its association with Chongryon, Sugihara decides he’ll go to Japanese high school. (See—I told you we’d see parallels between Kaneshiro’s life and Sugihara’s.)\n\nAnd this is all context we get in (more-or-less) the first chapter.\n\nThe rest of the novel takes place three years in the future. Sugihara is attending a private all-boys Japanese school.\n\nIn a memory, we find out what happened in the aftermath of Sugihara’s decision to leave the Korean school.\n\nThe Korean teachers called him an ethnic traitor and a turncoat. A teacher even slapped him so hard his eardrum burst.\n\nOther Korean students bullied him, also calling him “ethnic traitor”, “sellout” while kicking him in the stomach and hitting him in the face. Sugihara’s response had been, “We’ve never belonged to a country we could sell out”.\n\nThe administration and teachers at his new Japanese school encouraged him “to attend school under an alias to avoid any problems”. This is why he’s calling himself Sugihara throughout the story. But the administration carelessly ruins the effect by listing the name of his Korean middle school in the student register. Oops. Sugihara is targeted by violent bullies within three days of the beginning of the first day of high school.\n\nThe casual violence that is a part of Sugihara’s life is one of Go’s most striking features.\n\nSugihara explains that, “Korean schools have always been seen as these exclusionary karate dojos [martial arts academies] crawling with thugs”.\n\nHe continues that there are gentle guys and violent guys (he likens them to bears) at Korean schools—just like Japanese schools.“Sadly,” though, “The bears in the Korean schools have been fed a bellyful of discrimination. They keep feasting on that salmon, fattening up, growing more savage by the day”.\n\nAt his Korean school, Sugihara engaged in delinquent behavior and violence with his peers in what he knew at the time was a response to discrimination against their community. To give a comparatively mild example, Sugihara recalls a time in middle school that a female police officer used a megaphone to call him and his Zainichi friends “pieces of human garbage”. The next day, they began “a series of guerilla-style attacks on the police” with water balloons.\n\nNow that Sugihara attends a Japanese school, Japanese “tough guys” regularly challenge him to prove themselves. Three years in, he has won all 24 of these confrontations.\n\nClearly, Sugihara is not a guy who takes discrimination sitting down. That feature of Sugihara’s character was part of the appeal for translator Takami Nieda. She describes Sugihara as a character who is “willing to drop-kick discrimination and face adversity head on”.\n\nIn a different interview, she says, “I felt like, gosh, if I’d known this book, if I’d known Sugihara in person, that would have kind of opened the doors in terms of how an Asian kid in a majority-white culture could have acted towards injustices and prejudices and bullying…”.\n\nWe meet Sugihara’s love interest fairly early in the book—it’s supposed to be a love story, after all. She won’t tell Sugihara her full name; she just gives him her family name—Sakurai.\n\nThe basis of Sugihara and Sakurai’s relationship is largely intellectual. They go hunting for “cool” stuff together—great music, literature, and art.\n\nPartially through these interactions, we find out that Sugihara is smart. He’s interested in genetics—especially because they help him prove how little sense Japanese anti-Korean racism makes. He’s also a great fan of the German philosopher Nietzche. Sugihara is widely read and he thinks seriously about the ideas he finds in these books. He takes inspiration from rock musicians like Eric Clapton and Bob Dylan. Our smart narrator breaks down all kinds of stereotypes—not only of what Koreans are like and what they’re capable of, but of what masculinity looks like.\n\nThere’s an important moment shortly after Sugihara and Sakurai meet. Sakurai asks Sugihara about his “dreams for the future”. Sugihara tells her\n\nIf I could, I’d go to a top-tier college, get in with an elite corporation, fly up the promotional ladder, and if I could marry, marry a pretty girl, have two adorable kids, build a house in the city, retire, and then learn to play [the Chinese strategy game] Go. If I could, I’d take my wife’s hand in mine on a warm autumn day and tell her how happy I was to have spent my life with her and pass away quietly of old age”.\n\nWe, the readers, get plenty of information about why Sugihara can’t hold onto the same hopes as full Japanese citizens. Sugihara tells us, “Even if [he] did become a salaryman, [his] nationality prevent[s] him from becoming company president. Deprived of [his] greatest ambition from the start, [he] ha[s] no intention of slaving away in the system”.\n\nBut Sugihara doesn’t explain any of this to Sakurai right away—in fact he hides his Zainichi identity from Sakurai for a long time. “Outing” himself to her is at the heart of the novel’s climax.\n\nOn an emotionally fraught evening, Sugihara and Sakurai decide to have sex for the first time. Sugihara elects to tell Sakurai [about] his whole self before they consummate their relationship: “I’m not Japanese”. As part of his explanation to her, he adds one of his most sincerely held beliefs: “Nationality doesn’t mean anything”.\n\nSakurai doesn’t respond with the open-hearted acceptance that Sugihara (maybe naively) expected:\n\n“Since I was little, my father told me that I couldn’t go out with Korean or Chinese men,” she says, “He told me that Korean and Chinese people have tainted blood”. She goes on, “When I think about you entering my body, I’m scared… It’s not fair the way you just dropped this on me and ruined everything”.\n\nThey both leave their room at the love motel. Sugihara returns home. In the end, he takes consolation from the poem “Advice” by the Black American poet Langston Hughes. Kaneshiro doesn’t include it in the narrative, but this is how the poem goes:\n\nFolks, I’m telling you,\n\nbirthing is hard\n\nand dying is mean—\n\nso get yourself\n\na little loving\n\nin between.\n\nI’ll leave the question of whether Sugihara and Sakurai reconcile for you to discover—this really is a book you should give the book a read, even if it’s different from your normal fare. It is a love story, just like Sugihara says. But Go is also a demonstration of just how much of a complicating factor nationality has been for Koreans in Japan. It affects every relationship in Sugihara’s life—with his friends, with his teachers, with his own father, and most importantly, with the women he’s fallen in love with.\n\nSo why should you read Zainichi literature?\n\nIf you’re a regular RJL listener, I’m sure you’ve heard me talk about the way publishers’ choices shape how we think of Japanese literature.\n\nWith only six stand-alone works by Zainichi Koreans, our understanding of how rich and diverse Japanese literature really is is impoverished.\n\nBut we, English-language readers, get to shape those markets, too, through the stories we buy.\n\nIt’s been a while since I read you a favorite quote from translator Allison Markin Powell about reading women in translation. But her logic applies just as well I’m going to apply her logic to reading books by diverse groups of people living in Japan:\n\nBy reading authors who aren’t normally represented in translation—“by buying or borrowing books but also by talking about them, in any medium—readers demonstrate that there is a demand for the subjects that [these people] choose to write about and the perspective that they offer. That it makes a difference who tells the story, and why they tell it.”\n\nMost importantly, though, the stories by Korean writers in Japan that are available in English are wonderfully written human stories by excellent writers. And, I’ll note, they’re being brought to us by some extraordinary translators whose work intentionally participates in making the world a more just place.\n\nI’ve been reading from Go by Kazuki Kaneshiro, translated into English by Takami Nieda.

We’ll be briefly reviewing some of the upsetting events in Japanese history that influenced apocalyptic literature there. In particular, WWII (including the Battle of Okinawa) and several natural disasters (including the Triple Disasters of March 2011). This novel will mention death and rape—both historical and fictional—although it won’t go into any graphic detail.\n\nWelcome back for the finale of our three-part series, “The End of the World! Japanese Apocalypse. I’ve really enjoyed putting together this series. It’s been a lot like starting the master’s thesis I once dreamed of. I hope you’ve enjoyed it as much as I have. If you haven’t had a chance to listen to parts one and two, I strongly suggest you start there.\n\nIn part one, we took a look at the origins of apocalyptic and dystopian fiction—especially English-language apocalyptic and dystopian fiction.\n\nIn part two, we began our story of Japanese apocalyptic and dystopian fiction. We looked at the evolution of the idea of an “end of the world” in Japan. We looked at stories that expressed fears about a world with nuclear weapons between 1945 and about 1970. And we looked at disillusionment in the 1970s and 80s leading to tales of “violent cleansing of a corrupt and decultured world”.\n\nToday, in part three, we’ll finish our story of Japanese apocalyptic and dystopian fiction. First with stories from the mid-90s and 20-aughts. Then stories after the March 2011 Triple Disasters. And we’ll end with a look at the life and work of author Yoko Tawada who has written several apocalyptic stories, including one of the most important works of post-3/11 apocalyptic fiction available in English translation—The Emissary, also known at The Last Children of Tokyo.\n\n1995 was a pretty awful year for Japan. It’s really no wonder it marks a turn in apocalyptic literature. While the economic bubble burst in 1989, Tanaka regards 1995 as “the year in which Japan began to seriously suffer” from that economic collapse. Certainly, it took the Japanese government and the Japanese public several years to accept that the problem was serious and was just a blip.\n\nOn January 17, a 6.9 magnitude earthquake struck the southern part of Hyogo Prefecture in south-central Honshu—Japan’s main island. In Japan, this earthquake is known as the Great Hanshin Earthquake. Outside of Japan, we usually call it the Kobe Earthquake, after the largest major city affected.\n\nThe quake killed more than 6,000 people. 4,600 of them were in Kobe. It also injured 44,000 people and caused about 10 trillion yen in damage.\n\nThen, on March 20, elite figures from a new religious movement called Aum Shinrikyo carried out an attack on the Tokyo underground train system. Aum Shinrikyo was a new religious movement founded in the mid-1980s. (I want to talk about new religious movements and Aum in an upcoming episode, so I’ll leave it at that for now.) But elite members in Aum leadership carried packs of liquid [laced] with sarin onto the Tokyo underground that killed 27 people and injured thousands.\n\nCombined, these three events shook Japan’s confidence—perhaps even caused a crisis of identity—in a way that comes across in Japan’s apocalyptic fiction for almost another two decades.\n\nThe most obvious effects are in stories about dystopias or apocalypses brought about by new religious movements. (Again, I’m going to take up these specific stories in an upcoming episode, but I should at least mention them now.)\n\nKenzaburo Ōe’s Somersault, published in 1999, is about leaders of a new religious movement attempting to refute and then reform their church when it develops a radical, apocalyptic agenda.\n\nHaruki Murakami’s 1Q84 was published serially between 2009 and 2010. It’s a novel about a woman who accidentally enters a different reality and then fights against a new religious group.\n\nI should also mention that Murakami was somewhat fixated on 1995. He thought—probably still thinks—of 1995 as a real watershed year for Japan. He had been living abroad in a kind of self-imposed exile since the late 80s. He returned to Japan after the Kobe Earthquake and the Aum attack.\n\nHe wrote a journalistic account of the Aum attack published in English as Underground: The Tokyo Gas Attack and the Japanese Psyche, which he published in two parts in Japan in 1997 and 1998. (Actually, this is one of my favorites among Murakami’s work.) He also published a short story collection in response to the Kobe Earthquake called After the Quake in 2000.\n\nMurakami ended part one of Underground with an essay in which he has this to say\n\nThe Aum “phenomenon” disturbs precisely because it is not someone else’s affair. It shows us a distorted image of ourselves in a manner none of us could have foreseen.\n\n“They” are the mirror of us”.\n\nThe narrative that most Japanese embrace (or imagine they share) broke down; none of these “common values” [proved] the least effective in warding off the evil violence that erupted under us.\n\nIn other words, Murakami’s ultimate conclusion in Underground is that the perpetrators of the Aum attacks aren’t an Other—not a Them—but an Us.\n\nAnd Murakami wasn’t alone in his thinking. The Aum attacks set off a kind of identity crisis in Japan that you can see in some of the apocalyptic and dystopian fiction of the next decade or so.\n\nWho am I, really?\n\nWhat is my relationship to everyone else?\n\nDo I carry the apocalypse inside myself?\n\nProbably the most obvious example of these fears in English translation is 2010’s ME by Tomoyuki Hoshino, translated by Charles de Wolf.\n\nIn ME, a young man attempts an identity scam. In the end, he accidentally sets off a chain of events that results in a world of copies of himself all competing with each other for limited resources, and things quickly turn violent.\n\nMotoko Tanaka adds sekaikei stories to identity-oriented apocalyptic fiction of the 1990s. (A caveat that the sekaikei genre is a little controversial—I’m citing the work of a Japanese scholar. Please don’t shoot the messenger.)\n\nTakana defines sekaikei as work that\n\nfeature[s] the combined theme of apocalyptic crisis and school romance, with situations in which the “foreground” (love between the always male protagonist and the heroine) is directly connected to the “background” (apocalyptic crisis and the end of the world) without the mediation of the “middle ground”, such as communities and societies.\n\nIn other words, these are stories where we get a close look at a relationship between a male protagonist and his love interest, a female hero. The background is the end of the world. And we don’t really see what else is going on. It’s just the couple. The world’s ending. We don’t know much else.\n\nNeon Genesis Evangelion is probably the most popular Japanese apocalyptic story ever—both domestically and internationally. It isn’t quite a sekaikei story, at least according to Tanaka. Tanaka defines it this way because the male protagonist does not have his romantic wishes fulfilled.\n\nIts first incarnation was as an anime, which aired from 1995-1996. (Let me just say that it is a weird show—and kind of confusing. If you aren’t a regular anime viewer, this is not where I would suggest you begin.)\n\nEvangelion’s basic premise is that three teenagers have to pilot giant biomechanical robots to fight destructive aliens called “Angels”. These pilots all live in Tokyo-3, a city built after Tokyo was destroyed 15 years earlier in what’s called “the Second Impact”, some sound of global catastrophe.\n\nOver the course of the show’s 26 episodes, it actually asks some quite sophisticated questions about what it means to be human, what’s the relationship between a child and its parents, what kind of community does a human being actually need…\n\nMost sekaikei stories are less philosophical and more escapist. They also have other features that are sort of markers of the time in which they were popular. The female leads in these stories often end up functioning as both romantic and/or sexual interests and mothers.\n\nSaikano: The Last Love Song on This Little Planet by Shin Takahashi is a telling example. In that manga, the male lead is a high school student whose girlfriend is—for some reason—also a cyberbionic weapon defending Japan in some undefined apocalyptic war. She can’t, in the end, save the world, but she can save the male lead by transforming into a spaceship, and literally taking him into her own body.\n\n(I suppose I sound skeptical. The premise is pretty over the top, but I actually rather enjoyed both the manga and the anime adaptation of that one.)\n\nAs I mentioned at the beginning of this section, Motoko Tanaka’s analysis of apocalyptic Japanese fiction focuses on apocalyptic fiction aimed at men.\n\nUp until about 1980, perhaps, it makes a kind of sense to assume men are the target audience for apocalyptic stories. It’s maybe about 1980 or so before men weren’t just the assumed audience of many kinds of fiction—not only in Japan, but in the English-speaking world, too. Women weren’t broadly accepted as writers of speculative fiction, either. By the 1990s, though, it seems shortsighted not to ask what apocalyptic stories were women reading—and what apocalyptic stories women were writing. Or maybe that’s just me.\n\nTakanka’s defense is that 1990s sekaikei pop culture stories are many times more popular than almost any other kind of apocalyptic story—certainly than any literary apocalyptic stories. He cites psychiatrist and critic Tamaki Saito, who observes that best-selling novels in contemporary Japanese literature “ably depict contemporary issues up to the year 1990”, but “there has been no work of traditional literature since then that can transcend the anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion in terms of critical attention, influence on other producers, and economic impact”.\n\nCertainly by influence and economic impact, he’s absolutely right. I’m still not really sure it’s a good idea to leave stories written by and/or targeted toward women out of your narrative. So I’m going to fill them in.\n\nOr at least to the extent I can.\n\nFor my part, I’m limited by what has been translated. I can only think of two.\n\nYou may remember from previous episodes that the 1990s and 20-aughts were a relative dry period for Japanese fiction that wasn’t by Haruki Murakami. Fiction by women was rarely translated until the 2010s.\n\nSo whatever apocalyptic stories from 1995-2011 exist—and I have to assume more do!—they haven’t been translated or written about in a forum I’ve been able to access.\n\nOne exception I can think of is the manga series Full Metal Alchemist, written by a female mangaka, Hiromu Arakawa and published between 2001-2010. It’s a sort of fantasy/SF alternative history that basically reimagines WWI—except what if there were alchemy? The climax of the story features the antagonist attempting to trade the souls of the citizens of an entire nation for both immortality and omniscience.\n\nThe other exception I can think of wasn’t translated until 2019, but it was published in Japan in 2010. It’s Hiroko Oyamada’s The Factory.\n\nI love The Factory. It was another of the first Japanese novels I read. It’s also Oyamada’s English language debut—extremely accessible and only 128 pages in David Boyd’s English-language translation.\n\nThe Factory is almost an allegory about late-stage capitalism, although it stays on a surrealist level and never develops into simple symbolism or even magical realism. Oyamada creates a sinister atmosphere casting a pall over vaguely concerning aspects of everyday life in modern Japan—although the story could work as well in most modern countries.\n\nSo, when it comes to apocalyptic and dystopian stories by women from the 1990s and 2000s, I guess the morals of the story are:\n\n(1.) Readers in translation only have access to what publishers give us. We need to acknowledge that there are parts of the “story” of a language’s literature that we might just not know because it’s not there for us to read.\n\n(2.) It’s important to translate not only women, but all kinds of underrepresented voices. There have been great strides in translating women, but what about Zainichi Koreans? Ryukyuans or Okinawans? LGBTQ+ Japanese? Disabled Japanese?\n\nAnd (3.) We should all be grateful for Strong Women, Soft Power, Women in Translation, and other advocacy for translating women, as well as for translators who have done that important work.\n\nOn March 11, 2011, there was a 9.0 magnitude earthquake off the Eastern coast of Japan. It’s now known as “Higashi nihon daishinsai” or “The Great East Japan Earthquake”.\n\nThe Great East Japan Earthquake triggered a tsunami—a great wave—that may have reached heights up to 133 ft. That’s 40.5m. It rushed as far as 6mi (10km) inland at speeds of up to 435mph (700km/h). It caused massive destruction along more than 250 mi. (400 km) of Japan’s eastern coast. Some coastal cities were wiped away in minutes.\n\nThe earthquake and tsunami also disabled the reactor cooling systems at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. The afternoon of March 12, one reactor exploded, creating problems with 2 others. Another exploded the Monday. The next day, a third explosion released radiation at 10,000 times normal levels. More than 300,000 people were eventually evacuated because of the meltdowns. Three months later, the company reported leaks might have spread into the Pacific Ocean.\n\nCollectively, people inside and outside of Japan refer to this series of disasters as san ten ichi-ichi or “3-11”.\n\nThe government released official death numbers around the 10th anniversary of 3/11 in 2021. It reported 19,759 deaths. 6,242 injuries. 2,553 missing, most of whom are presumed dead. 100,000s of people who evacuated the area still haven’t returned home—many never will.\n\nWe did an entire episode about “Fukushima Fiction” last year. I’ve just reviewed a little bit of the content, and I’ll review a little bit more, but that episode goes into a lot more detail.\n\nWhat’s important for our narrative today is that 3/11 marked the beginning of a fourth era of Japanese apocalyptic fiction, just as Ted Goossen anticipated.\n\nThe story of fiction that came out of 3/11 is really fascinating, in part because the literary community was actively writing as its way to participate in the recovery.\n\nThere’s a limited amount of Fukushima fiction translated from Japanese—especially fiction from beyond the first couple of years after the disaster. Of what’s been translated, about half the stand-alone prose fiction titles are by women—and the majority of those are apocalyptic stories.\n\nHiromi Kawakami’s “God Bless You, 2011” is a short story that appears in the collection March Was Made of Yarn, edited by Elmer Luke and David Karashima. It was translated into English by Ted Goossen. “God Bless You, 2011” was one of the very first pieces of Fukushima fiction to emerge after 3/11. And it was also the piece we close-read in our episode about Fukushima fiction.\n\nKawakami wrote the short story Kamisama (translated as “God Bless You”) in 1993. It’s about a woman who befriends a bear who moves into the apartment next door. They go to a nice stream together, encounter an obnoxious little boy, have a picnic…\n\nKawakami revisited the story immediately after 3/11. This time, there has been “an [incident]”, and the protagonist and the bear have to think about their exposure to radioactivity as part of their excursion. The stream is contaminated. There are no children left anywhere in the area.\n\nMotoko Tanaka’s survey ended in 2014. He didn’t really have time to take up Fukushima fiction, so I’m relying on my own research and my own reading from here on out. What I’ve got access to is limited by what scholars are writing about… and what articles have made it to academic databases, as well as what has been translated.\n\nAnd what I have access to is also gendered because, at the moment, what’s being translated is pretty gendered. We’re seeing Akutagawa winners and “comfort reads” about cats and coffee by men and women. We’re seeing detective novels, almost exclusively by men. And, at the moment, it’s mostly women writing the kinds of fiction that would include apocalyptic stories who are being translated. Japanese science fiction doesn’t tend to sell well, so we aren’t seeing much science fiction written by members of either gender.\n\n(Just to be clear, I’m not saying the situation is skewed in favor of women. My current count for 2024 at the moment is 18 fiction books by women translated into English versus 25 by men.)\n\nI can tell you that children come up a lot in post-3/11 apocalyptic and dystopian fiction by women. Again, children and maternity and childrearing is not a theme for apocalyptic fiction by women, but it does seem to take on, maybe, a new urgency? In “God Bless You, 2011”, there are no children. In The Emissay, the children are all sick—we’ll talk about that in just a minute.\n\nI saw a fascinating talk at the Association of Asian Studies conference. The talk was by Professor Chiara Pavone at Bard College. She brought to my attention a number of works that haven’t been translated from the later 2010s. (It’s bad form to give away someone’s unpublished work from a conference talk, but I think just saying that I heard novels exist and mention I learned about it from an interesting professor is okay.)\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe rolled some of the 3/11 recovery efforts into his “Womenomics” initiatives and initiatives to boost Japan’s birthrate. For fiction writers, the result was a number of books (untranslated as of now) imagining that the Japanese government was forcing women to have children.\n\nDr. Pavone offered examples. I didn’t catch which of Sayaka Murata’s novels she was including, but I believe it must have been Satsujin shussan (something like “Murderous Birth” or “The Birth Murder”). There’s a reasonable chance we will see this one translated—just a guess.\n\nThe premise of Murderous Birth is that any person who gives birth to ten children is granted the right to kill someone. (Typical Murata, right?)\n\nAnd by “person” I’m not just being inclusive. Murata explicitly says all reproduction is through assisted fertilization. There are artificial uteri where necessary.\n\nSo Murata’s feminist dystopia is a good bit more… complicated. What else would we expect from Sayaka Murata? (If you don’t know what I mean, check out RJL’s episode on Sayaka Murata and “Translating Japanese Women”.)\n\nLet me close up our discussion of apocalyptic fiction from Japan with one more example of recent dystopian fiction—still (obviously) post-3/11, but mauve at a little bit of a remove. This is Scattered All Over the Earth is also by Yoko Tawada. It was published in 2018. It has been translated into English by Margaret Mitsutani. It’s a kind of Japanese post-apocalypse, combined with a trans-apocalyptic story for the rest of the world.\n\nThe story never uses the word “Japan” or the word “Japanese”, “the land of sushi” has ceased to exist. The story never completely explains why, although it does give us hints, all of which are references to very real threats that face Japan, many of which we’ve discussed on this podcast.\n\nUrban sprawl led to the leveling of Japan’s mountains. (Okay, that one hasn’t happened, but it’s an expression of fear about destruction of Japan’s environment.)\n\nSexual hormones became “practically extinct”.\n\nIt seems that Japanese people could no longer “distinguish between the virtual and real worlds”.\n\nLaborers worked 80-hour shifts without sleeping.\n\nSo we still have this post-3/11 sense of real immediacy in Japan’s apocalypse. These things that are really happening or nearly happening right now have led to the end of Japan in Scattered All Over the Earth. And not only have Japan’s children disappeared—Japan itself is just… gone. Japan has had its apocalypse, but it seems like the world is next.\n\nThe protagonist is someone from “the land of sushi” who speaks “the land of sushi’s” language. Even where she lives in Northern Europe, environmental poisons have caused salmon to grow to the size of whales. The apocalypse is happening right now in the story.\n\nScattered All Over the Earth is actually part of a trilogy. Part two, Suggested in the Stars, comes out in English this fall—fall 2024. And part three is supposed to come out in 2025.\n\nYoko Tawada was born in 1960. That makes her two years younger than Hiromi Kawakami, the exact same age as Shun Medoruma, and four years older than Banana Yoshimoto. (Those are all other authors we’ve covered on this podcast.)\n\nShe’s from Nakano, a special ward of Tokyo. (You might have heard of Nakano from Hiromi Kawakami’s novel The Nakano Thrift Shop.)\n\nTawada’s father was a non-fiction translator, and he eventually opened a bookshop selling academic books from abroad. Her undergraduate degree is from Waseda, one of Japan’s most prestigious universities.\n\nIn 1982, Tawada graduated with a degree in Russian literature. She wanted to move to the Soviet Union to study Russian literature, but that was no easy feat in 1982. Instead, she moved to Hamburg to work for one of her father’s business partners in book distribution. Hamburg is a city in north central Germany. It was part of West Germany before German reunification in 1990. It was only about 30 miles or 50 kilometers from the border with East Germany.\n\nBy 1990, she had earned a master’s degree in contemporary German literature from Hamburg University. In 2000, she received her doctorate in German literature from the University of Zürich in Zürich, Switzerland. And in 2006, Tawada moved to Berlin, where she still lives.\n\nWhile she was earning her master’s and PhD, Tawada was also writing fiction and poetry. In 1987, she published a bilingual German-Japanese collection of poetry. I’ll spare you my attempt at the German title. The Japanese is Anata no iru tokoro dake nani mo nai or Nothing Only Where You Are.\n\nIn 1991, Tawada won Japan’s Gunzo Prize for New Writers for her first novella, Kakato o nakushite (Missing Heels). And in 1993, Tawada won the Akutagawa Prize for her story Inu muko iri, available in Margaret Mitsutani’s English translation under the title The Bridegroom Was a Dog.\n\nTawada continued writing. In 1996, she won a special award for people writing in German for whom German was not their native language.\n\nSo we have a Japanese writer who is a native Japanese speaker and writes literary Japanese but also lives in Germany and writes award-winning German prose and poetry. Tawada is just a singularly impressive writer to me, and really a testament to how limited the world is for monolinguals or people like me who only dabble in other languages.\n\nShe often writes the same stories in both Japanese and German, using a process she calls “continuous translation”. For example, the novel we have access to in English as The Naked Eye was translated from the German by Susan Bernofsky, but she wrote that book in both languages simultaneously.\n\nShe wrote translated as Memoirs of a Polar Bear in Japanese first and then translated herself into German. Her English language publisher, New Directions, suggested the English language translation should come from the Japanese version. The woman who ultimately translated the book into English, Susan Bernofsky, summarized Tawada’s response this way:\n\nI have already moved the book from an Eastern language to a Western language for you, so if you translate the German, it will be closer to my intention.\n\nIn the same interview, Bernofsky clarifies that this approach “goes against all conventional wisdom in translation”, but also that Tawada “knows a lot about translation”, so it’s an interesting thought experiment. Bernofsky’s translation, by the way, went on to win the very first Warwick Prize for Women in Translation.\n\nTawada herself uses the term exophony for writing in a language that isn’t one’s “mother tongue”.\n\nPeople have been writing in non-native languages almost since the advent of writing. Certainly there was a long time that any self-respecting, Latin-speaking Roman wrote in Greek if they wanted to be taken seriously, for example.\n\nThe term exophony, though, is relatively new.\n\nTawada has said her use of exophony is both political and stylistic. By writing beautifully in both German and Japanese as a Japanese writer, she could help dismantle the ultra nationalistic concept of a “beautiful” Japanese language. And, as we’ve discussed in earlier episodes, the Japanese language allows a great deal of ambiguity. Germanic languages like German and English don’t. So writing the same thing in the two different languages is a stylistic challenge. And, let me add that Tawada sometimes incorporates French, Russian, Chinese, Dutch, and even Afrikaans in her storytelling.\n\nAnd so you might not be surprised to learn that language becomes a major motif in some of her work. Scattered All Over the Earth is especially notable.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, Scattered All Over the Earth is an apocalyptic novel. It’s a novel about “the land of sushi disappearing”, leaving people who speak its language adrift. One of the protagonists, Hiruko, doesn’t know anyone else who speaks her language, so concocts her own “homemade language” called “Panska”. It’s mutually comprehensible across Scandinavia. A Danish linguistics student, and he’s compelled by the way Hiruko seems to be “breathing in several grammars, melding them together inside her body, then exhaling them as sweet breath”.\n\nThe novel has one of my favorite scenes in a recently-published book. One character asks Hiruko if she’s a Buddhist.\n\n“No,” Hiruko says, “I’m a linguist.”\n\n“Is that a religion?”\n\n“Not really, but language can make people happy, and [show] them what’s beyond death.”\n\nYoko Tawada is not only an author who has apocalyptic storytelling, she also has made explicit comments about her own take on the history of apocalypse in the Japanese imagination. Tawada asserts that, “The idea that the world has a beginning and an end is not well known in Japan”. And we discussed that a little bit when we talked about the history of apocalyptic storytelling in Japan.\n\nIn her telling, Catholic Jesuits imported the term, presumably in the 16th century when the first Catholic missionaries arrived in the country. You’ll be a little bit familiar with that history… sort of… both from Read Japanese Literature’s other episodes and if you’ve been watching Shogun.\n\nEarlier, I spoke about how the Japanese didn’t rely on apocalyptic imagery to talk about the firebombing of Tokyo or the historical events of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima or Nagaski. This is also true of the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake. My source is… Yoko Tawada. Or at least Tawada through an article by Kathrin Maurer at the University of South Denmark.\n\nAccording to Maurer, when Tawada writes about apocalypses, she’s interested in the ways a more-or-less European theological idea about the end of the world “traveled, crisscrossed oceans, [was] shipped over the waters, and thus changed [its] meaning”.\n\nI’ve already mentioned Scattered All Over the Earth, but the rest of this episode is going to talk about two other apocalyptic stories by Yoko Tawada. First, a quick look at the short story “The Island of Eternal Life” and then a deeper dive into The Emissary\n\nI don’t know that Yoko Tawada thinks about it this way, but it’s pretty clear to me that her 2012 short story “The Island of Eternal Life” is something like a “first pass” at some of the ideas she more fully developed in The Emissary. (You can find “The Island of Eternal Life” in March Was Made of Yarn, a collection of stories written in response to the 3/11 Triple Disasters.) Like The Emissary and virtually all of Tawada’s work from Japanese, it was translated by Margaret Mitsutani.\n\nThe Emissary was published two years later.\n\nAccording to the story, in early 2013, the mass media started announcing “The horrors of Fukushima are now over…” (It would have been obvious in 2012 that that was a lie. As you might remember from our episode on Fukushima fiction—or as you might just know—even by the time of the so-called “Recovery Olympics” in 2021, the government was still hard pressed to make the case “the horrors of Fukushima” were now “over”.\n\nAgain, according to the story, on the second anniversary of the Triple Disaster, anti-nuclear terrorists kidnapped the emperor and announced, “The emperor’s wish is that all nuclear plants should be shut down immediately”. The Prime Minister of Japan later disappeared, and by 2015 the government of Japan had been privatized. Japan has been closed and isolated ever since.\n\nThe only information the narrator of “The Island” has about Japan is from a book by a Portuguese writer who supposedly snuck into Japan. In English, the book is called The Strange Journey of the Grandson of Fernão Mendes Pinto, and the narrator thinks it reads like Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels—a completely fictional work of satire.\n\nThe very title is evocative for a number of reasons. The Portuguese did have a rather sneaky relationship with the isolated Japanese in the 17th century. And there really was a Fernão Mendes Pinto, although much too long ago to have a living grandson in the 2010s.\n\nNevertheless, The Strange Journey of the Grandson of Fernão Mendes Pinto goes on to describe a Japan that sounds a lot like what we’ll encounter in The Emissary. The elderly can’t die; children are sickly and need constant care. The language is leaving borrowed foreign loan words behind. Fish and many vegetables are too contaminated to eat. There’s no electricity. It’s almost like a return to the Edo Period.\n\nAnd that, again, would be the period before the Meiji Restoration, before Americans and Europeans arrived in a way that significantly influenced everyday life in Japan.\n\nThe story in The Emissary is much more developed than in an “The Island of Eternal Life”. (It would be. It’s several times as long.) But the story is also much more ambiguous.\n\n(And, just a reminder, The Emissary was published by Portobello and Granta Books in the UK as The Last Children of Tokyo. The title in Japanese comes from the name given to a Heian-period Japanese ambassador to China.)\n\nThe title character is Mumei. And he’s an elementary schooler. Like all of his peers, he suffers from severe birth defects because of pollution in a post-apocalyptic Japan.\n\nHis great-grandfather, Yoshiro is really the protagonist of The Emissary—at least for most of the book. For the majority of Yoshiro’s life, he has worked as a novelist. Now Yoshiro devotes most of his time to caring for Mumei. And Mumei requires a lot of care.\n\nSome disaster has devastated Japan. The disaster itself is never really clarified, although there are some hints linking it to 3/11. For example, Yoshiro recalls the weeks of living in temporary housing turning into years, almost like a throwback to Tohoku evacuees—some of whom are still living in temporary housing.\n\nOn the other hand, in a turn of understated but gleeful irony, the marginal places of Japan today have become its most prosperous in the world of The Emissary. The economies of Tohoku, Hokkaido, and Okinawa are booming while Tokyo is the place that’s left to fall apart. So maybe 3/11 isn’t the pivotal disaster.\n\nMumei’s teacher is pretty emphatic that no natural disaster is the problem. He insists to his class that, “Japan isn’t the way it is now just because of earthquakes and tsunami. If natural disasters were the only problem, we certainly would have recovered long before now.”\n\nRegardless of the cause, the Earth has become “irreversibly contaminated”, and it seems to be getting worse—“In a few years’ time, perhaps, they [will] no longer be able to leave the house”.\n\nThe disaster has also had significant and sometimes horrifying effects on human bodies. Old people never really age. There are “young elderly” and “middle-aged elderly”. People aren’t identified as “middle-aged elderly” until they are well into their 90s. Yoshiro is about to turn 108.\n\nYoung people, on the other hand, are debilitated by birth defects. We can only extrapolate from details that Tawada drops in, and most of them are about Mumei specifically. When Mumei goes to school, we can see that many of his classmates have similar limitations.\n\nMumei’s head is “much too large for his slender long neck”, and his hairs are “fine as silk threads”. His teeth are so soft that Yoshiro has to soak bread in soy milk before he can eat. (Kids’ bodies just can’t absorb the calcium they need.) Mumei has “birdlike legs turned inward from the knee down”.\n\nJapan has responded to whatever disaster or series of disasters caused all this by closing itself off from the world. The decision to isolate Japan was not made by popular consent, but it doesn’t seem to have met with real protest either.\n\nThe Emissary also reflects Tawada’s interest in language in ways that are extremely relevant to the plot. Some words have become too insensitive. When all of your children have birth defects, the word “mutation” becomes problematic. So the word “mutation” has been replaced by “environmental adaptation”. “Orphans” are now “independent children”.\n\nIn an isolated country, “foreign” words are “falling out of use”—“purposeless running had been referred to as jogging”. It’s not anymore.\n\nTawada uses an emphasis on language for humor, too. I especially enjoy the way she plays with Japan’s numerous national holidays. Because Japan’s lifestyle and culture has changed in The Emissary, the names and purposes of holidays had to change, too.\n\nRespect for the Aged Day, a holiday in celebration of people who are old and tired, has become Encouragement for the Aged Day.\n\nChildren’s Day has become Apologize to the Children Day\n\nChildren can’t play sports? Sports Day becomes Body Day.\n\nYoung people can’t work? Labor Day becomes Being Alive Is Enough Day.\n\nIt’s notable that, whatever the catastrophe was, Japan seems to have fallen apart so slowly that no one did anything in particular about it while it was happening. Certainly Yoshiro wasn’t paying attention. Tawada seems to judge him for his lack of care, although she does it with a light touch.\n\nThe middle third or so of the novel is the story of Yoshiro’s relationship with his estranged wife Marika, again Mumei’s great-grandmother.\n\nThey fall in love at protest demonstrations, although the reader never really finds out what, exactly, they were protesting. We do know the crowds at these protests stretched for miles.\n\nThey couple eventually marries. Yoshiro stays home writing a novel about hikikomori. Marika, on the other hand, gets more and more involved in political causes. She does this in part as a mother—of the daughter she and Yoshiro share. This would be the woman who becomes Mumei’s grandmother.\n\n(There’s a historical precedent for that in Japan—some of the most successful [anti-]nuclear activists in Japan were mothers’ groups, for example. Who better to advocate for nuclear disarmament than the women whose children were at risk?)\n\nYoshiro’s response at the time had been kind of sexist: he “had always been wary of righteous social movements. Milky-smelling virtue contained resentment like sulfuric acid, directed at male writers too busy penning their gloomy, perverse novels [men like Yoshiro] to think of their homes and families, and if Yoshiro were to let down his guard, the acid would surely spill over to burn his hands”.\n\nIn other words, Yoshiro is worried if he listens to Marika’s advocacy, it will actually affect him. Marika leaves when their daughter grows up.\n\nYoshiro’s grandson floats into and out of his life. And Yoshiro is still too clueless about the world around him to be of much help to his grandson.\n\nIt really isn’t until he is left with custody for his great-grandson that he looks around himself and discovers what Japan has become. And, really, it’s because he is obliged to take on a mother’s role for Mumei.\n\nI should mention that it’s possible Tawada is trying to imply the series of events has already begun—I worked out clues the story leaves behind. It’s possible Yoshiro’s daughter was born as early as the 1990s, and that his grandson was born in the 2010s. Possible, but not necessary. An interesting thought experiment.\n\nThe title of the book comes from a secret project that weaves its way through the narrative—the Emissary Association. The Emissary Association is looking for smart, selfless, personable, and visionary children to travel abroad. The goal is “to make it possible to thoroughly research the state of Japanese children’s health, yielding information that would prove useful if similar phenomena [began] to appear in other countries”. (Again, there’s this question, exactly how unique is what is happening in Japan? Exactly how much do the Japanese know about what is happening elsewhere?)\n\nMumei, obviously, is a candidate to become an emissary.\n\nI’ve given away a lot of the plot of The Emissary. It’s the kind of book you don’t really need to keep a secret to enjoy. But if you don’t want me to spoil the ending, you should skip ahead about two minutes.\n\nThe last ten pages or so of The Emissary take place seven years after the action of the rest of the book. Mumei is 15 and prepared to leave Japan as an emissary. The section is a lovely interval. It even hints at a budding romance between Mumei and a 15-year-old girl. She’s going to be an emissary, too.\n\nBut, abruptly the action returns the story’s present. Mumei is lying on the floor of his elementary school and the 10 page interval was something like a dream.\n\nAn optimistic reader might consider the dream a vision of the future. A pessimistic reader might think Mumei is dying. Once again, the Japanese have made a plan to improve the situation that they will never put into action.\n\nAnd so Yoko Tawada’s The Emissary is that kind of perfect apocalyptic story that provides an outlet for the audience’s very reasonable fears about the future.\n\nA fear of isolation.\n\nTawada has written several times about an “Edo Renaissance” since the beginning of Japan’s economic crisis. In one talk, she noted, “the longing for the Edo Period as a time of isolation is based on the sentiment that the opening of Japan wrought havoc in the country”. Perhaps the fear of Japanese isolation was even greater under the government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. But consider that Japan virtually closed its borders entirely for almost a two-full years in response to COVID-19. Is it possible Japan will cut itself off from the rest of the world entirely?\n\nFear of environmental contamination.\n\nPost 3/11, fears of environmental contamination were at the forefront of everyone’s minds. But it’s not as though those fears have gone away. The soil near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plan is still contaminated, and there’s still an exclusion zone.. The Japanese government began releasing water from the plant into the Pacific Ocean just last year—2023.\n\nAnd the Fukushima fallout isn’t even the greatest looming environmental disaster facing our planet—not by a longshot. What will happen to our children in a contaminated world?\n\nFear of a low birthrate.\n\nWe’ve discussed Japan’s low birthrate at length. After a small recovery, COVID-19 dealt a significant blow. 2023 saw the fewest births per woman in Japan ever recorded. The population shrank by more than 500,000 people last year. What would happen if the children being born could not survive?\n\nFear of an aging society.\n\nAs we’ve also discussed, Japan has one of the most rapidly aging societies in the world. People already wonder who is going to care for the elderly there. What if the script were flipped and the elderly had to become the caretakers for the young?\n\nFear for what some people think of as a dying language.\n\nThe Japanese language is not dying, but we’ve discussed authors who worry about its future in “the Age of English”. (That’s Minae Mizumura’s phrase, not mine.) Unlike many other languages, Japanese is barely spoken outside of Japan. What will happen to the Japanese language as the population shrinks? What if language itself ceases to hold its meaning?\n\nAnd fear of inaction.\n\nYoshiro has lived through a societal collapse, but no one has done anything to stop it. What if all readers are doing the same thing, even as they turn each page?\n\nSo why read Japanese apocalyptic fiction?\n\nWe’re in a weird, late-stage capitalist moment:\n\nStill dealing with a pandemic that society seems set on ignoring\n\nLiving with runaway wealth inequality that’s only getting worse\n\nWatching climate change happen in real time… and watching most governments completely fail to act\n\nDealing with new advances in technology that threaten not only people’s livelihoods, but human creativity itself\n\nQuite frankly, there are a lot of days it seems like we’re living in a trans-apocalyptic moment.\n\nIn some ways, it seems like the Japanese imagination has beaten the Western imagination to the punch. Japanese apocalyptic stories have anticipated some of the trends that English-language apocalyptic literature is just catching up to—the kinds of apocalyptic stories English-language writers didn’t start writing en masse until the 2010s or so.\n\nWork that portrays the apocalypse as the violent cleansing of a corrupt and decultured world, work that captures a real sense of hopelessness—was already coming out of Japan in the 1970s.\n\nWork that was dealing with crises of identity—who are we as individuals? who are we as a nation?—was already coming out of Japan in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nI guess I’m interested in Japanese apocalyptic fiction because it gives me a sense I’m looking ahead at what might be coming. And it grounds me with a sense of how another culture has coped with the same kinds of fears.\n\nOur focus text today was The Emissary by Yoko Tawada, translated into English by Margaret Mitsutani.

We’ll be briefly reviewing some of the upsetting events in Japanese history that influenced apocalyptic literature there. In particular, WWII (including the Battle of Okinawa) and several natural disasters (including the Triple Disasters of March 2011). This novel will mention death and rape—both historical and fictional—although it won’t go into any graphic detail.\n\nIn part one, we took a look at the origins of apocalyptic and dystopian fiction—especially English-language apocalyptic and dystopian fiction. If you haven’t listened to part one yet, I strongly encourage you to go back and start there.\n\nAs a quick review:\n\nApocalyptic fiction evolves from tales of the end of the world in Western and Central Asia.\n\nModern tales of the end of the world took off in 19th century Europe and accelerated after WWII.\n\nApocalyptic stories overlap with dystopian stories about human societies gone wrong. And these stories are often warnings about the direction our society is headed.\n\nApocalyptic fiction is an expression of some of our greatest fears:\n\nEnvironmental collapse\n\nNuclear war\n\nScience pushing beyond what should be its ethical limits\n\nIncreasingly, a society so fractured that it can’t endure much longer\n\nToday, in part two, we’ll turn our attention to specifically Japanese apocalyptic fiction.\n\nTed Goossen is a highly-regarded translator of Japanese fiction. Most famously, he has translated some work of Haruki Murakami. He has also translated some of the most recent work by Hiromi Kawakami to appear in English, including The Third Love, which is due out later this year—2024. (I’m very excited about that one!)\n\nJust two weeks after the March 11, 2011 Triple Disasters of earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear reactor meltdown, Goossen published an article in which he broke modern Japanese apocalyptic literature into three “eras”. And guessed that the event would be the start of a fourth.\n\n(These also have some overlap with the eras of sci-fi we covered in our episode on Japanese sci-fi. For our Patreon supporters, I’ll be doing some “connecting the dots” between the story of Japanese sci-fi and the story of Japanese apocalyptic fiction.)\n\nAccording to Goossen, the first wave of Japanese apocalyptic fiction was a response to the atomic bomb—fictional responses to a post-nuclear world.\n\nThe second wave of apocalyptic literature is made up of works that “portray the apocalypse as the violent cleansing of a corrupt and decultured world”.\n\nThe third wave began in 1995 with the Kobe earthquake and Aum Shinrikyo sarin gas attacks.\n\nAnd Goossen anticipated (correctly) that 3/11 would begin a fourth wave of apocalyptic stories. We covered these kinds of stories about a year ago in an episode called Fukushima Fiction.\n\nI think he makes some excellent points, so I’m going to use Goossen’s subdivisions today. I’ll go into a little bit of depth about what was going on in contemporary Japan to mark off 1945, the beginning of the 1970s, 1995, and 2011 as watershed moments in Japanese history. And then I’ll take a look at a few sort-of key works of Japanese apocalyptic literature available in English from each period.\n\nI am also relying heavily on the work of Motoko Tanaka, a professor at Tamagawa University in Tokyo, especially his book Apocalypse in Contemporary Japanese Science Fiction. You can find a link to the PhD thesis on which the book was based on the episode page. It’s available through the University of British Columbia’s open library.\n\nBy his own admission, Professor Tanaka’s study tends toward books and media targeted toward men—we’ll discuss. It was nevertheless invaluable.\n\nBut first, I’m going to go back and look at pre-modern Japanese apocalyptic fiction.\n\nNative Japanese religious traditions weren’t nearly as focused on the end of the world as Abrahamic ones, especially Christianity.\n\nThe Kojiki (learn more with RJL) is the oldest collection of Japanese myths. It has a lot to say about how things began in Japan—but nothing to say about how things will end.\n\nBuddhism originated in India in the 500s BCE. It moved along the Silk Roads to China by the 200s and to Korea by the 300s. It was imported to Japan by the 500s during the Asuka Period. (That’s 538-710.) And early Japanese Buddhism wasn’t that concerned with the end times either.\n\nThe story changed a bit after 1185. There was a brutal civil war in Japan called the Genpei War between 1180-1185. The end result was the fall of the Heian Court depicted in classical Japanese literature like Murasaki Shikibu’s The Tale of Genji (learn more with RJL) and Sei Shonagon’s The Pillow Book. That meant the end of the Heian Period of Japanese history (784-1185) and the beginning of a period of more-or-less continual civil war that lasted until Ieyasu Tokugawa became shogun in 1603.\n\nUnder pretty apocalyptic looking circumstances, some Buddhists and lay people turned to Buddhist teaching.\n\nWe went into “Kamakura Buddhism” in greater depth in a season one episode called “Setsuwa and Medieval Japanese Buddhism”, but I’ll cover what’s relevant here. (As usual, I’m doing my very best to represent living religious teachings fairly. I am happy to post corrections where I have failed and happy to post corrections, too.)\n\nBuddhist teaching passes through three “ages”. Japanese Buddhists linked the Three Ages to specific moments in Japanese history:\n\nFirst came “The Former Day of the Dharma” or “The Age of the Right Dharma”. (Dharma is a term for the teachings of Buddhism.) During this age, the disciples of the historical Buddha (Guatama Buddha) are able to uphold his teachings. According to medieval Japanese Buddhists, the Former Day of the Dharma ended in 552, the year The Chronicles of Japan gives for the introduction of Buddhism into Japan from Korea. This is probably the wrong date. Nevertheless…\n\nNext came “Middle Day of the Dharma” or “The Age of the Semblance of Dharma” During the Middle Day of the Dharma, Contemporary Buddhism only looks like correct teaching. Only resembles it. In other words, priests can mostly guess and teach and live by what Buddha intended. But it has been too long, the tradition is corrupted, people have been corrupted, and priests aren’t getting it quite right. According to medieval Japanese Buddhists, “The Middle Day of [the] Dharma” ended in 1052, exactly 500 years after Buddhism supposedly arrived in Japan.\n\nFinally comes “The Latter Day of the Dharma” or “The Degenerate Age of Dharma”—in Japanese, mappo. Mappo is a 10,000 year age during which the Dharma gradually declines. It is a period of unrest, strife, famine, natural disaster. At the end of 10,000 years, the Buddhism of Guatama Buddha will lose all power of salvation and a new Buddha will appear to save the people.\n\nEven though mappo and a kind of “end of the world” pessimism were more common in medieval Japan, there isn’t a lot of what we’d call apocalyptic fiction. And there isn’t a lot of what we’d call “fiction” in medieval Japan either.\n\nThere are warrior epics like The Tale of the Heike (learn more with RJL). And there are poems and essays in a more apocalyptic vein. Motoko Tanaka describes Kamo no Chōmei’s essay The Hojoki as “a representative [medieval] literary work with apocalyptic themes.\n\nJapan became a much more stable place after 1603—that’s when Ieyasu Tokugawa became Shogun of Japan. It’s the first year of the Edo Period, a period of relative peace that lasted all the way until 1868.\n\nAs you might imagine, the apocalypse seemed a good bit less imminent when the countryside wasn’t in constant danger of civil war. There were still religious movements that used apocalyptic imagery to appeal to the “have nots” of the Edo Period… that’s a little outside of our scope today. But there still weren’t a lot of apocalyptic stories—religious or fiction[al]—on the minds of most Japanese people.\n\nThe Edo Period of Japanese history ended in 1867. That was 15 years after US Commodore Matthew Perry sailed into Tokyo Harbor and forced Japan to open itself to American trade.\n\nThe Meiji Period that began in 1868 brought with it huge cultural changes. (We’ve discussed them at length in many episodes of this podcast.) As you might expect, it also brought on new kinds of apocalyptic thinking. Not only did the arrival of American and European culture bring new kinds of storytelling, I imagine the circumstances of the cultures’ arrival might have seemed pretty apocalyptic.\n\nAdd to that new scientific fears. For example, in late Edo and early Meiji Japan, comets and newly-discovered planets added new fears of global destruction. Many cultures have looked to the sky for signs and portents of things to come—and that includes Anglo-American culture. But these comets and planets weren’t just omens anymore. People were beginning to understand the danger of a celestial body colliding with Earth.\n\nSo what did the introduction of “modern” apocalyptic storytelling look like in Japan?\n\nTo oversimplify, the Meiji Government was all about “civilization and enlightenment”—bringing the country up to “Western” standards of education and scientific knowledge as quickly as possible.\n\nScience fiction held a natural appeal under the circumstances, so [European] science fiction stories caught on pretty quickly in Japan. More than thirty titles by Jules Verne appeared in Japanese translation between 1878 and 1888, for example.\n\nPopular apocalyptic stories imported from abroad included 1903’s The End of the World by American-Canadian astronomer Simon Newcomb—that one was translated and published in Japan in 1905. A scientist correctly predicts that a celestial object will crash into the sun, causing it to temporarily expand and kill all life on Earth.\n\nJapan was producing its own apocalyptic novels by the late 1800s. Kajo Nakagawa’s 1898 The End of the World took up a real-life warning by an Austrian astronomer that a massive comet would crash into Earth in November of 1899. (That, obviously, didn’t happen.)\n\nLiterary critic Yasuo Nagaya argues that these kinds of early stories tended to avoid an absolute end. In fact, when these stories were translated, the translator often changed the ending to make disaster into the narrator’s nightmare.\n\nAs usual, Ryunosuke Akutagawa doesn’t really “fit” into the narrative of 20th century Japanese literature—20th century Japanese apocalyptic literature—even though he’s one of Japan’s most important modern writers. Most of his stories weren’t explicitly apocalyptic. I suppose you could say a kind of “apocalyptic imagination”.\n\nHis 1927 novel Kappa, one of his last works, is part dystopia, part satire on contemporary Japanese society. Susan Napier calls it “Japan’s first-full blown dystopian novel”.\n\nIn one of the novel’s most striking and famous scenes, a father-to-be asks a fetus if he wishes “to be born into this world”. In a recent translation by Lisa Hofmann-Kuroda and Allison Markin Powell, the almost-born kappa responds\n\nI do not wish to be born. The hereditary mental illness of my father is bad enough—and besides, I believe that life as a kappa is a poor existence.\n\nThe mother then miscarries. And the unborn kappa dies.\n\nWWII changed almost everything about story-telling… almost everywhere, really.\n\nNo one really knows how many people were killed in WWII, but it is likely 70-85 million people died—3% of the total population of the world in 1940. The majority of the people who died were civilians.\n\nThe Nazis in Germany killed more than 10 million civilians themselves—not only Jews, but also Polish, Roma, Sinti, and Slavic people, gay men, people with disabilities, religious minorities…\n\nThe atomic bomb evaporated people off the streets of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in second"
