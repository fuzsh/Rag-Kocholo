        "text": "Verne's first cautionary tale about the dangers of science — first modern and corrected English translation.\n\nWhen two European scientists unexpectedly inherit an Indian rajah's fortune, each builds an experimental city of his dreams in the wilds of the American Northwest. France-Ville is a harmonious urban community devoted to health and hygiene, the specialty of its French founder, Dr. François Sarrasin. Stahlstadt, or City of Steel, is a fortress-like factory town devoted to the manufacture of high-tech weapons of war. Its German creator, the fanatically pro-Aryan Herr Schultze, is Verne's first truly evil scientist. In his quest for world domination and racial supremacy, Schultze decides to showcase his deadly wares by destroying France-Ville and all its inhabitants. Both prescient and cautionary, The Begum's Millions is a masterpiece of scientific and political speculation and constitutes one of the earliest technological utopia/dystopias in Western literature. This Wesleyan edition features notes, appendices, and a critical introduction as well as all the illustrations from the original French edition.\n\nA Note on the Translation\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Begum's Millions by Jules Verne\n\nMr. Sharp Makes his Entrance\n\nTwo Friends\n\nA News Item\n\nDivided by Two\n\nThe City of Steel\n\nThe Albrecht Mine\n\nThe Central Block\n\nThe Dragon's Lair\n\nAbsent without Leave\n\nAn Article from Unsere Centurie, a German Journal\n\nDinner at Dr. Sarrasin's\n\nThe Council\n\nLetter from Marcel Bruckmann to Professor Schultze, Stahlstadt,\n\nPreparing for Combat\n\nThe San Francisco Stock Exchange\n\nTwo Frenchman against a City\n\nExplanations at Gunpoint\n\nThe Kernel of Mystery\n\nA Family Affair\n\nConclusion\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\nJules Gabriel Verne: A Biography\n\nAbout the Contributors\n\n\"To read Jules Verne is one of the great treats of childhood. To read Jules Verne later in life is to discover a writer just as satisfying but even richer, one who is not only a natural storyteller but also a mythmaker, a social critic and an innovative artist. ...Give The Begum's Millions or one of (his) other novels a try.... There's a lot more to Jules Verne than what you find in those old, albeit quite wonderful, Disney movies.\"\n\n~Washington Post Book World\n\n\"This edition of The Begum's Millions is a significant work of scholarship and an important contribution to the ongoing project of reclaiming and redefining Verne's reputation in the English-speaking world.\"\n\n~Gary K.
