        "text": "Find out more about Episode 33 of the Read Literature podcast on the episode page.\n\nLink to listen\n\nNotes and sources\n\nWays to support the podcast\n\nThis is Read Japanese Literature. My name is Alison Fincher. Read Japanese Literature is a podcast about Japanese fiction and some of its best works. All the works we discuss are available in translation, so you can read along if you want. You can find out more at ReadJapaneseLiterature.com.\n\nQuick content warning: The end of the world isn’t exactly a cheerful subject. We’ll be briefly reviewing some of the upsetting events in Japanese history that influenced apocalyptic literature there. In particular, WWII (including the Battle of Okinawa) and several natural disasters (including the Triple Disasters of March 2011). This novel will mention death and rape—both historical and fictional—although it won’t go into any graphic detail.\n\nThe protagonist of Haruki Murakami’s 1Q84 believes that “everyone, deep in their hearts, is waiting for the end of the world to come.” I don’t know whether she’s right, but I do know that I’ve spent my entire reading life reading—and loving—apocalyptic and dystopian fiction.\n\nOne of the first novels I remember reading is a middle grade post-apocalyptic novel called This Time of Darkness by Helen Mary Hoover. It’s about an 11-year-old in a dystopian future society that controls the underclasses by refusing to teach them to read.\n\nBecause I have this life-long interest in apocalyptic fiction, I was struck by some of the first novels I encountered in Japanese translation:\n\nMariko Ohara’s Hybrid Child\n\nHiroko Oyamada’s The Factory\n\nHaruki Murakami’s 1Q84\n\nI’ll come back to these titles later—I promise.\n\nAs I read, it seemed to me that Japanese apocalyptic fiction was doing something that English-language apocalyptic fiction just wasn’t—although, at the time, I couldn’t put my [finger] on what. And it seemed like, maybe, Japanese apocalyptic fiction was ahead of its time compared to English-language apocalyptic fiction.\n\nAll of this is what I want to explore in this episode.\n\nI’m also trying something new. For the past year or so, I’ve poured my heart into a topic, produced one 45-minute episode, and then felt guilty for a month about how long it takes me to prepare the next episode. I wondered what would happen if I devoted as many episodes as it takes to tell you everything I’ve learned about Japanese apocalyptic fiction. The two-part episode on Misogyny and Mishima went over well enough that I thought I’d give this a try. It might even help me shorten the time between episode releases.\n\nI know this is different. I’d love to hear from you whether it works for you or not. Let me know through the website or through Bluesky. Patreon supporters are very welcome to contact me that way.\n\nAnd so, in this multi-part episode, we’re going to talk about apocalyptic and dystopian fiction—stories of the end of the world.\n\nThere will be some overlap with last year’s episode about Japanese science-fiction—in fact, you might want to go back and take a listen. Not necessary, just good background information.\n\nI’m going to start out with a description of apocalyptic fiction as a genre, and I’ll include its “cousin” of sorts, dystopian fiction. By the time we get to the 19th and 20th centuries, this will be mostly a story from the English-speaking world. I’ll clarify why we’re covering it anyway. Maybe you’ll hear a mention of some of your own favorites.\n\nI’ll move on to a history of apocalyptic fiction in Japan. Almost all the authors I mention, as usual, are available in English translation. And there will be a more comprehensive list of what’s translated on the episode page.\n\nWe’ll end with the biography of writer Yoko Tawada—another one of my favorites—and her novel The Emissary, translated by Margaret Mitsutani. (The Emissary was also published under the title The Last Children of Tokyo. It’s the same translation by the same translator.)\n\nLet me also mention that I’ll be giving a lot of examples of different books in this episode, and you’ll be able to find several lists on the episode page:\n\nJapanese Tales of the End of the World\n\nManga and Anime of Special Note—that means things that are particularly relevant to the topic we’re discussing\n\nOther Tales of the End of the World\n\nBooks by Yoko Tawada\n\nand then, as usual, a general list of stories this episode also mentions\n\nIf you’re interested in any of the stories (and you’re a North American shopper), please consider purchasing them through the website or our Bookshop.org page. It’s a great way to support the podcast. And there are even links to free copies of a couple of the earlier short stories that are out of copyright.\n\nAs always, the very best way to support the podcast is by joining our Patreon. We have more than 20 supporters now, and I’m grateful to each and every one of you.\n\nThis episode required a little more background reading than normal. I was very grateful to know so many people were cheering on the podcast. And for the financial support helped pay for the books I needed to read. You can join them at patreon.com/readjapaneseliterature.\n\nLet’s begin with some vocabulary.\n\nThe word apocalypse didn’t start [out] having anything to do with the end of the world. It comes from the Greek word apokalypsis meaning, literally, “lifting the veil”. It’s all about uncovering a secret truth.\n\nThe current meaning of apocalypse is either “an event involving destruction of damage on a catastrophic scale”—up to and including the end of the world. Or it means “the complete and final destruction of the world as described in the last book of the Christian Bible, usually titled The Book of Revelation. That book begins with the word apokalypsis.\n\nSo maybe you can see a link here: This revealing, unveiling book gives away a secret truth about destruction, ergo… apocalypse.\n\nAccording to tradition, John, one of the apostles of Jesus, wrote The Book of Revelation around 95 CE. Within the century, the meaning of the word apokalypsis had changed to more-or-less) the meaning apocalypse we use today.\n\nWhen we talk about apocalyptic fiction, we talk about fiction about the end of the world.\n\nWe can also talk about post-apocalyptic fiction—fiction that takes place after the world as we know it has already ended.\n\nAnde can talk about the trans apocalypse—the apocalypse as it happens. The trans apocalypse is a term for right now—the world of the fruits of late-stage capitalism, rising nationalism, and a failure to meaningfully address global climate change. Perhaps a pessimistic or cynical term.\n\n(Not to be confused with the massive assault on the rights of transgender people, which is a huge problem I don’t mean to dismiss. A quick Google search shows the term is sometimes shared.)\n\nIt’s difficult to completely separate apocalyptic fiction from its “cousin” of sorts, dystopian fiction. Dystopia comes from the Greek dus (“bad”) and topos (“place”).\n\nSome people treat it as the antonym, or opposite, of the fictional Utopia of Sir Thomas More. Sir Thomas used his book, Utopia, to describe an ideal society: -topia, again, from topos (“place”) and u [meaning] “no”. As in a utopia is a place that can’t really exist. (Many people think it’s from eu, meaning “good”—like eudaemonia, if you’ve ever studied Greek philosophy—but it’s not. It’s from u—“no”.)\n\nSo utopia is not actually the opposite of dystopia. In fact, some dystopias come from people’s attempts to make perfect societies.\n\nApocalyptic stories have been around at least as long as human beings have been able to record their own stories.\n\nMany of the oldest involve floods. (There is no geological evidence of a global flood on the scale described in these stories, there are several plausible theories about more local catastrophic floods that might have affected early human populations. The destruction might have been so memorable that it got passed down for thousands of years and recorded in scriptures all over western and central Asia.)\n\nFor example, the ancient Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh describes angry gods sending floods to punish humanity. That was written somewhere between 3200 and 4000 years ago.\n\nThe Sanskrit Dharmasastra, written in the second millennium BCE, includes an apocalyptic flood. The Dharmasastra is now one of the Hindu scriptures. And variations of the same story show up in Buddhist and Jain scriptures.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible tells the story of Noah and his family, the only humans to survive an apocalyptic flood, also at the hands of an angry God. The Hebrew Bible also contains another apocalyptic destruction, this of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.\n\n(Side note: The cities are destroyed for being bad hosts to the angels God sends to visit the cities—not for sodomy—but that’s another story for a different kind of podcast.)\n\nThere are apocalyptic stories in Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, Islam, some Native American religious traditions. Apocalyptic stories are fairly profuse in many religions.\n\nIn Christian Europe, John’s vision of the apocalypse dominated the cultural imagination of the end of the world for centuries. There are some fictional stories that play with John’s Apocalypse. Piers Plowman [by William Langland] is a Medieval English example. I studied it in graduate school. It was way over my head; I don’t want to go into it here.\n\nBut with very few exceptions, it really wasn’t until the advent of science fiction opened up new ways of imagining and telling stories that apocalyptic fiction started to become a meaningful fiction genre.\n\nAs I’ve already mentioned, we covered science fiction at length in a previous episode.\n\nAs a quick review, modern sci-fi began (more-or-less) in the 19th century. One of the most popular titles to get thrown around as “the first sci-fi novel” is Englishwoman Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, first published in 1818.\n\nNot coincidentally, several early sci-fi writers are among the earliest authors of apocalyptic fiction, too.\n\nIn 1826, Mary Shelley published her novel The Last Man. It’s often considered the first major work of post-apocalyptic fiction. The plot follows a group of people trying to survive a global plague.\n\nThe end of the world wasn’t a hugely influential theme, though, in 19th century science fiction. There are a few important works in the genre—or at least works worth mentioning.\n\nIn 1839, Edgar Allan Poe published his short story “The Conversation of Eiros and Charmion”. It’s a story about a comet that removes all the nitrogen from Earth’s atmosphere. Distressingly, the then over-oxygenated atmosphere then catches fire—yikes.\n\nH. G. Wells’s The Time Machine depicts two apocalypses of a sort. When the Time Traveler arrives in 802,701 CE, he finds that humanity has subdivided into two distinct species. One of them is beautiful and stupid; the other is clever and cannibalistic. He arrives later to find a dying Earth under a swollen, red sun.\n\nAnd Wells’s The War of the Worlds addresses aliens who successfully destroy Victorian England with their advanced weapons.\n\nThe 19th century also saw the rise of dystopian fiction, especially after John Stewart Mills made an 1868 speech to the British Parliament denouncing the government’s Irish land policy. Mills popularized the word dystopia with his claim that:\n\n“What is commonly called Utopian is something too good to be practicable; but what they appear to favor is too bad to be practicable”.\n\nAs I’ve already mentioned, dystopian fiction is tied to—but not the same as—apocalyptic fiction. Sometimes an apocalypse brings about a dystopia. Solutions to a world-ending crisis cause more harm than good. Or maybe, at the end of all things, there is just no good way to run a society.\n\nMore often, a dystopian society brings about an apocalypse. Either the society is so bad the world is literally going to end, or the citizens in the dystopia are so trapped within it that there is no real hope that the world is going to move forward. The story is apocalyptic in the sense that it is “the end of history”. These problems are unsolvable. The end.\n\nFrom the earliest days of dystopian fiction, the stories have been as much about protesting contemporary society as predicting the future.\n\nIn 1879, Jules Verne published The Begum’s Fortune. It’s a story about the corrupting influence of money and materialism. Perhaps even a critique of the military-industrial complex.\n\nIn 1907, a Catholic priest named Robert Hugh Benson wrote Lord of the World. It’s about the consequences of secularism, humanism, and socialism—and it ends with the Christian apocalypse. (Both Pope Benedict XVI and Pope Francis have praised the book as “prophetic”.)\n\nIn the early 20th century, there were anti-socialist dystopias, like Ayn Rand’s 1938 Anthem.\n\n…anti-capitalist dystopias, like Jack London’s 1908 The Iron Heel.\n\n…anti-technology dystopias—or at least pro-humanism dystopias—like Aldous Huxley’s 1932 Brave New World.\n\nThere were anti-fascist dystopias… anti-Nazi dystopias…\n\nAnd that takes us up to the 20th century.\n\nWhen we covered Japanese science fiction, we started the episode by mapping global science fiction. After some sort-of proto science fiction texts in Britain and France, American SF dominated the genre up until the 1960s.\n\nEven after the 60s, it was still useful to look at major developments in the genre globally first and then go back and take a look at how those developments played out in Japan.\n\nWhen it comes to apocalyptic and dystopian fiction, things are a little bit more complicated.\n\nYes, the earliest apocalyptic and dystopian novels are Western European.\n\nAnd, yes, the way “apocalypse” looks in the modern imagination and probably the idea of a dystopia are more-or-less European inventions.\n\nBut by the time Japanese writers had taken up the novel—say, by the end of the Meiji Period—the Japanese apocalyptic and dystopian novel [don’t] follow the same narrative as the Anglo-American apocalyptic novel.\n\nHere’s my guess: While many apocalyptic fears transcend cultures, I think there’s a case [to be made] that cultures fear different things at different times for particular cultural and historical reasons. Perhaps the way non-Japanese writers tell apocalyptic stories has an influence in Japan, but a lot of the specific kinds of anxieties Japanese apocalyptic stories express are specific to Japan at any given moment in time.\n\nAll of this is to say I have a reason I’m taking this approach of looking at Anglo-American apocalyptic and dystopian fiction first, but maybe my reasons aren’t as strong as they were for looking at Anglo-American science fiction first.\n\nYou’ll see later that the history of Japanese apocalyptic and dystopian fiction is more closely tied to Japan’s own history and culture. Nevertheless, this is an English-language podcast, and English-language fiction does give us interesting context and a way to, kind of, ground this episode’s story.\n\nIn Britain and the US, apocalyptic fiction continued to come out in dribs and drabs through the first half of the 20th century. Some of the stories anticipated motifs that we’re still exploring in the 2020s.\n\nWe get technology superseding human will—and then failing—in E. M. Forster’s “The Machine Stops”, published in 1909.\n\nWe get a deadly, almost world-ending pandemic in Jack London’s The Scarlet Plague, published in 1912.\n\nWe get genetic engineering gone awry in J. J. Connington’s Nordenholt’s Million, published in 1923. (In that one a man-made bacteria denitrifies and kills all plant life!)\n\nAnd we get an asteroid colliding with Earth in Philip Wylie and Edwin Balmer’s When Worlds Collide, published in 1933.\n\nThere are also some important dystopian stories in the first half of the 20th century. We’ve already discussed a few. The most notable ones we’ve missed are:\n\nGeorge Orwell’s 1984, published in 1949. 1984 depicts a totalitarian state that controls its citizens through surveillance and doublethink: “War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.” You’ll see as we continue that language use is a common motif in dystopian literature and apocalyptic literature—especially in the work of Yoko Tawada.\n\nAnother notable dystopian novel is Ray Bradberry’s Fahrenheit 451, published in 1953. Fahrenheit 451 depicts a dystopian United States where the government started burning books after people stopped reading them and started watching too much television.\n\nThere is a lot of apocalyptic fiction from the second half of the 20th century, and I needed to find a coherent way to tell the story. While I was doing my research for this part of the episode, I ran across an article by M. R. Carey on Electric Lit. It’s called “A Brief History of the End of the World”.\n\nIt’s not an academic source—and it’s not meant to be, but it’s an article by a well-regarded article recognizing patterns in fiction of the second half of the 20th century. So I’m going to use it as an organizational structure.\n\nCarey observes that, “Each wave of doomsday plot devices is different from the one before” and “those changes tell us something about ourselves”. He pulls out major threads in late 20th and early 21st century apocalyptic stories that show what fears were on most English-speaking people’s minds. (Later, you’ll have a chance to compare themes of English apocalyptic fiction with themes of Japanese apocalyptic fiction.)\n\nCarey isn’t so much making an argument that these are the exclusive motifs of apocalyptic fiction during any given decade—just an observation that these motifs seem especially prevalent as particular moments in time.\n\nCarey begins his account in 1960, when he claims “science fiction [began] to address itself en masse to the end of the world”. According to Carey, before the 1960s, sci-fi doomsday stories “were far outweighed by bright, millenarian visions”.\n\nThink about the TV show The Jetsons where everyone lives happily in space suburbs with 2.5 kids, a pet, and a robo housekeeper.\n\nIn science fiction, when there are skirmishes with aliens, heroes like Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers were able to handily save the day.\n\nAccording to Carey, the predominant theme in 1960s apocalyptic fiction is environmental disaster. Again, that doesn’t mean there aren’t dozens and dozens of stories on other kinds of disasters—just that environmental disaster seems to have been a special focus.\n\nYounger listeners might not realize that the 1960s are the decade the public really started to become aware of some of the catastrophes modern technologies were wreaking on the world.\n\nFor example, Rachel Carson published Silent Spring in 1962. It’s a nonfiction book—very important. It’s probably one of the most impactful environmental books ever published.\n\nSilent Spring describes how chemicals like the pesticide DDT had worked their way up the food chain and were now killing off birds—thus the silent season with no birdsong. Actually, Silent Spring includes a sort of “mini” apocalyptic story of its own. In a chapter called “A Fable for Tomorrow”, a nameless American town has been robbed of apple blossoms, fish, birds, and even human children by DDT.\n\n1960s apocalyptic fiction offered the same kinds of warnings of environmental disaster as Silent Spring did.\n\nJ. G. Ballard’s 1962 The Drowned World describes ice caps melting because of global warming. (Don’t let anyone tell you no one knew about global warming that long ago!)\n\nAnthony Burgess’s 1962 The Wanting Seed explores the effects of overpopulation.\n\nSo does Harry Harrison’s 1966 Make Room! Make Room!, much better known for its film adaptation, 1973’s Soylent Green. (Spoiler alert for people my age and younger, the climax of Soylent Green is that one of humanity’s staple foods is made from human corpses—“Soylent Green is people!”)\n\nSometimes these environmental disasters are directly related to human meddling with the atom. The most enduring example is almost certainly Kurt Vonnegut’s 1963 Cat’s Cradle. It features a scientist who worked on the Manhattan Project, the group that developed the atomic bomb. The scientist also created a substance called ice-9. It moves water’s melting point from 0° C (32° F) to 45.8° C (or 114.4° F). I won’t give away the how, but it’s fairly obvious to anyone who knows anything about Vonnegut or sci-fi that the ice-9 ends up “freezing” all of the world’s water and causing… an apocalypse.\n\nFears about nuclear war and nuclear fallout became even more dominant in the apocalyptic literature of the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nThere are, of course, older stories about apocalyptic nuclear fallout. One of the first is a novel called Mr. Adam [A-D-A-M] by Pat Frank, published in 1946. In Mr. Adam, a nuclear power plant explodes and renders the entire male population infertile.\n\nOthers include Peter Bryant’s 1958 Red Alert (later adapted into the Stanley Kubrick film Dr. Strangelove) and Walter Miller’s 1959 novel A Canticle for Leibowitz (it’s one of my favorites).\n\nBut, according to Carey, Cold War anxiety took over apocalyptic literature in the 70s and 80s.\n\nLooking through a list of 70s and 80s apocalyptic fiction, it turns out many of these novels weren’t all that enduring. There is Robert O’Brien’s 1974 Z Is for Zacariah. (That was another one of my childhood favorites.) It is what would today be published as a YA title. One girl is mysteriously shielded from the nuclear apocalypse in her farming valley. A strange man arrives and tries to force her into an Adam-and-Eve scenario. Really frightening.\n\nIt’s said that people prefer to watch their sci-fi instead of read it and that seems true of the most popular apocalyptic stories from the 70s and 80s. One example that comes to mind is the very first episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. That show premiered in 1987 with an episode that makes vague references to Earth’s age of “nuclear horror”. Captain Picard and his crew are put on trial without a jury or a lawyer in a dystopian, pre-Starfleet society.\n\nåThe biggest apocalyptic stories Carey’s characterization leaves out are Stephen King’s 1978 novel The Stand and the Terminator film franchise, which premiered in 1984.\n\nThe Stand is about a deadly virus that an incompetent government can’t stop. Hmmm…\n\nAnd The Terminator is about a time traveler trying to prevent a future where artificial intelligence has all but destroyed humanity. Also hmmm…\n\nI’m also not sure that Carey’s story takes into account the kinds of anxieties that come up in apocalyptic and dystopian stories by women and people of color.\n\nMargaret Atwood’s 1985 The Handmaid’s Tale is about a society where certain women of childbearing age are forced into concubinage in a religious dictatorship that has taken over the United States. The dictatorship struggles with infertility. In her historical notes at the end of the novel, Atwood explicitly links that [in]fertility to her contemporary concerns about radiation, chemical pollution, sexually transmitted infections… So, I suppose, in a kind-of-sort-of way, it falls under Carey’s characterization.\n\nLois Lowry’s 1993 The Giver is another middle grade novel. It’s about a society that has decided to forego pain and conflict by adopting a system of “sameness”. The protagonist eventually discovers the appalling consequences of the system. Like many works of dystopian and apocalyptic fiction by women, there’s a big focus on motherhood and children. We’ll see how that’s especially true of Japanese [apocalyptic] fiction later.\n\nOctavia Butler’s 1993 The Parable of the Sower is an alarmingly prescient dystopia set in 2020s California. The consequences of climate change, corporate greed, and massive income inequality have driven the country to the brink of disintegration. A newly elected radical authoritarian president loosening labor protections and spouting xenophobia.\n\nAccording to Carey, the 1990 and 00s were the dawn of the dead—by which I mean, there were an overwhelming number of stories of zombie apocalypse.\n\nA lot of people like to read zombies as metaphors. According to Carey, they [zombies] are “People in shape only… remind us our own personhood can be rescinded.”\n\nZombies can also stand in for all kinds of fears.\n\nA deadly plague, like in Max Brooks’s 2006 World War Z.\n\nScience gone awry, in films like the films 28 Days Later and The Zombie Diaries. (In both films, British scientists somehow create zombie viruses. Not sure what people were concerned British scientists were up to in the 2000s.)\n\nFears of cell phone signals, like in Stephen King’s 2006 Cell. (Maybe you’re old enough to remember when cell phone signals were going to kill us all.)\n\nFears of Demons—Brian Keene’s 2003 The Rising.\n\nFears of plain old late-stage capitalist hopelessness—Isaac Marion’s Warm Bodies and the film Shaun of the Dead. In both of these stories, the mechanism that started turning people into zombies seems like it was plain and simple giving up. Shaun of the Dead even ends with this magnificent scene of the zombies being put to work at dead-end jobs and the protagonist playing video games with his dead-beat friend who has been turned into a zombie because they were zombies already.\n\nAnd, of course, you can read zombies as terrorists. Remember this was the era of the War on Terror, and zombies are Others who go around destroying things and killing people and turning people into zombies for reasons you don’t quite understand or at least agree with.\n\nCormac McCarthy’s 2006 The Road isn’t a zombie story, but it’s a story about people so desperate that they act like zombies—mindlessly violent and cannibalistic.\n\nAlthough Carey doesn’t note it, the 1990s also saw a couple of notable returns to religious apocalypse stories. Maybe they were caused by fear that the world would end at the end of the second millennium?\n\nIn 1990, British authors Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett published Good Omens. It’s a satirical story hypothesizing that all the Biblical apocalyptic prophecies are true–but also carried out by fairly incompetent angels and demons.\n\nThe 90s and 00s saw the hugely popular, now almost entirely forgotten Left Behind series by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins. This 13-book saga took Biblical prophecies seriously and told the story of what would happen if they took place in the late 90s.\n\nCarey doesn’t identify a big theme for post-2010 apocalyptic fiction. He just offers an observation that there’s a lot more of it.\n\nCarey observes that “in the wake of a financial collapse [in 2008], the prospect of having your life suddenly and spectacularly become non-viable has become a day-to-day-reality for many.” American listeners may not realize that our banking collapse and financial crisis echoed around the world, so this holds for people in most developed nations. Combine that with rising nationalism, on-going conflicts across the globe, and a pandemic that we’re ignoring but hasn’t gone away… It’s easy to guess why people are still telling stories about the end of the world.\n\nI haven’t kept up with contemporary apocalyptic fiction—there’s just too much of it. You can find several lists on the episode page that include more contemporary titles if you’re interested.\n\nI will mention a book I found compelling, Louise Erdrich’s 2017’s Future Home of the Living God by Louise Erdrich. In that book, humans have begun to evolve backward, so the government is abducting all women who are pregnant—including the protagonist. Eventually, she is forced to give birth in a government facility. The government takes her healthy baby boy without ever letting her see him.\n\nThis is a particularly poignant narrative in the hands of a Native American author like Louise Erdrich—she is an enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians. Native Americans have been subject to forced adoptions. Some Native Americans authors and activists like B. L. Blanchard, Steven Charleston, and Cowboy Smith X have been pretty vocal about the fact Native Americans have already survived at least one apocalypse—the arrival of Europeans in the Americas and US settlement of the West in the 1800s. Some of the most hopeful narratives about what we can do next to deal with climate change and other disasters come from Native Americans.\n\nSo that’s the story of English-language apocalyptic fiction in a nutshell.\n\nIt’s a story that evolves from tales of the end of the world in Western and Central Asia.\n\nModern tales of the end of the world took off in the 19th century and accelerated after WWII. Apocalyptic stories overlap with dystopian stories about human societies gone wrong. And these stories are often warnings about the direction our society is headed.\n\nApocalyptic fiction is an expression of some of our greatest fears:\n\nEnvironmental collapse\n\nNuclear war\n\nScience pushing beyond what should be its ethical limits\n\nIncreasingly, a society so fractured that it can’t endure much longer\n\nIn the next section, we’ll turn to apocalyptic fiction in Japan.\n\nHow is its story like the story of English-language apocalyptic fiction? How is it different?\n\nTo what extent do Japan’s apocalyptic fears overlap with apocalyptic fears in the English-speaking world? And what concerns does Japan have of its own?\n\nWe covered a lot of texts today. You can find extensive lists on the episode page. As a matter of fact, the episode page already lists most of the content for all parts of the episode, including what we haven’t covered yet—apocalyptic fiction more specifically in Japan and Yoko Tawada’s The Emissary.\n\nYou can find extensive lists of the texts we have covered and will cover on the episode page, as well as a complete transcript, external links to more information about the ideas we’ve covered, and a complete bibliography of my sources. I hope you have a chance to take a look, whether you’re bookshopping or not.\n\nIt also isn’t too late to pick up a copy of our focus text for this episode, again, The Emissary by Yoko Tawada.
