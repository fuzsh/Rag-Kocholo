Britain is King, France is Queen demoted to Jack by Germany, who is the Joker trying to become Ace, while the Wild Card U.S. enjoys and/or suffers through the Gilded Age, where minimal taxes go hand-in-hand with minimal government regulation and social programs, becoming gold for the lucky whites at the top and fool's gold for everybody else? America is still infecting the rest of the world with social changeitis, which becomes more radical the farther it spreads, even as the stream of modern inventions (electric light, telephone, phonograph) breaks the dam, democratizing the world even faster? Meanwhile whites are quietly breeding throughout the world for future wars, little suspecting that they will be exterminating each other? American \"Playtex, it's just another day\" big business is born? Thomas Edison invents the light bulb, give the infant cathode ray tube another century and we'll get Bill Gates? The decade for hyphenated composers Cam and Nick, Camille Saint-Saens and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov? A good decade for all stripes of Wilsons?\n\nCountry Leader From To United States of America Ulysses Simpson Grant (1822-85) Mar. 4, 1869 Mar. 4, 1877 Britain Queen Victoria (1819-1901) June 20, 1837 Jan. 22, 1901 France Napoleon III (1808-73) 1851 Sept. 2, 1870 Austria Emperor Franz Josef I (1830-1916) Dec. 2, 1848 Nov. 21, 1916 Russia Tsar Alexander II (1818-81) Feb. 18, 1855 Mar. 13, 1881 Prussia Wilhelm I (1798-1888) Jan. 2, 1861 Mar. 9, 1888 Papacy Pius IX (1792-1878) June 16, 1846 Feb. 7, 1878 Turkey Sultan Abdul Aziz I (1830-76) June 25, 1861 May 30, 1876\n\n1870 - The Don't Rock the Boat Baby Otto von Bismarck Wrong-Way Giuseppe Garibaldi Papal Infallibility Year? The John D. Rockefeller Standard Oil Year? The 15th Amendment Blacks Get the Vote Year? Lauder, Lloyd, Lenin, and Smuts are dealt in, while Lee, Dumas pere, Merimee, and Dickens are dealt out of the Live Deck?\n\n1870 Pop.: Germany: 41M; France: 36M; Japan: 33M; Italy: 26.8M; Britain: 26M; Ireland: 5.4M (2.6M less than in 1841).

Beginning this year large numbers of Hungarians begin immigrating to the U.S. German-immigrant-packed Chicago, Ill. has 17 candy manufacturers, growing to 65 in 1900, becoming the Candy Capital of the U.S. after candy consumption zooms from 2.2 lbs./person in 1880 to 5.6 lbs/person in 1914, and 13.1 lbs./person in 1919. All seceded U.S. states return to the Union by the end of this year. Sweden has the highest per-capita income growth in the world, which ends in 1970 after they go Socialist. In this decade the ratio of the incomes of the richest and poorest countries begins to massively diverge, increasing 6x in the 20th cent.; Americans of Irish descent send $10M back to relatives in Ireland in this decade, causing a nat. dependence on the \"Letter from America\", particularly in the W.

Stanton; meanwhile the reaction against the incompetence and corruption in Pres. Grant's admin. incites mutiny within the Repub. ranks, causing a split into pro-Grant Stalwarts (Conklingites) who favor machine politics, incl. Chester A. Arthur and Thomas C. Platt, led by U.S. Sen. \"Lord\" Roscoe Conkling (1829-88), who controls patronage at the New York Customs House, and moderate anti-Grant Half-Breeds (incl. Rutherford B. Hayes and James A.

(Solano opponent) Cirilo Antonio Rivarola Acosta (1836-79) becomes pres. of Paraguay (until Dec. 10, 1871); since only 13% of the remaining pop. are adult males, he takes measures to attract immigrants while forcing the rural pop. into labor on the large estates.
