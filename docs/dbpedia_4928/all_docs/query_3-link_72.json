        "text": "We’ve got comedian Frank Castillo on the show today! Frank’s a pretty new comedian on the scene, but he’s very funny and headliners already recognize that and take him out on the road. He also won Roast Battle II and co-hosts the “Verbal Violence” podcast. Despite that, he’s still a guy working the door at the Comedy Store and trying to become a paid regular, all while writing and performing and getting better. Listen to what it’s like getting started in comedy and what the daily grind is like for someone at his level. Episode sponsored by VapeXhale.com!
