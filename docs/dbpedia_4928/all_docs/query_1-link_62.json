I appreciate your patience as I attempt to bring my diary of “special moments with my dogs” up-to-date!\n\nApril 3, 2021\n\nDuring my last Spring Break as a Special Education teacher in 2021, I realized just how grateful I was to have a camper….Not that I wasn’t thankful to have one pre-Covid, but now more than ever I am so appreciative that we could take a trip and still remain safe and self-contained in our own “home” during Covid times. On the way to our 2021 Easter Camping trip, we did an overnight stay at Quattro Goombas Winery/ Brewery/ Pizza Kitchen (a Harvest Hosts spot) in Aldie, Virginia, and it did not disappoint!\n\nAll safety precautions were in place and they provided curbside pickup for beer, wine, and Pizza for those who were not comfortable dining/drinking indoors … everything was delicious and there was plenty of room to walk the dogs on the grounds!\n\nThis was our first outing after the Covid oubreak\n\nNormandy Farms Campground: Foxborough, MA\n\nThis campground is located between Boston & Cape Cod and has many activities for campers!\n\nCrawfordsville KOA: Crawfordsville, IN\n\nOn our way out to the 2019 DockDogs World Championship , we did an overnight-stay at Crawfordsville KOA in Crawfordsville, IN.\n\nHooch wanted to be on the welcoming committee:\n\nOur campsite:\n\nLager in front of the cool log deer:\n\nWashington / Pittsburgh SW KOA Journey: Washington, PA\n\nOn the way out to the 2019 DockDogs World Championship, we did an overnight stay at Washington / Pittsburgh SW KOA Journey .\n\nBrennan Beach RV Resort: Pulaski, NY\n\nOn our way to Bowmanville, Ontario for a dock diving event, we did an -overnight stay at Brennan Beach RV Resort.\n\nThis campground was located right on Lake Ontario!\n\nWhat a gorgeous view!\n\nThe next morning, Lake Ontario had waves like the ocean!\n\nThis was their cute snack bar down by the beach:\n\nTom’s Cove Park: Chincoteague, VA\n\nTom’s Cove Park, located on Chincoteague Island, Virginia, overlooks Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge and Assateague Island National Seashore Park.\n\nThis was our first time camping in Chincoteague.

People at this campground were so nice – before we knew it we had a whole crew of people helping us back up (NOT an easy thing to do where we ended up!) One of the campers even drove in their golf cart to lead us to our campsite. I don’t know what we would have done without their help that night!\n\nThere was plenty of space to walk the dogs. All the campers were so excited to meet the “dock dogs!”\n\nThis was our first time staying at this campground – but we liked it so much that we already booked it for the 2019 Hopkinton Fair!\n\nBedford Creek Marina and Campground: Sackets Harbor, NY\n\nOn our way to the K9 Central Wild Card Double Header, we stayed overnight for the first time at Bedford Creek Marina and Campground .\n\nWe had a nice end spot with room to walk the dogs.\n\nWhen Rita and I went for our first walk, look at what we saw at someone’s campsite!

They are still working to recover from the tragic losses that ensued from that disaster. However, the owners could not have been nicer, and despite what the campground had been through, it looked great and was very enjoyable.\n\nOur campsite was private and had a HUGE living space…perfect for letting the dogs out!\n\nNatural Bridge / Lexington KOA: Natural Bridge, VA\n\nOn the way home from the DockDogs World Championship, we did an over night stay at Natural Bridge / Lexington KOA in Natural Bridge, VA.\n\nOur Campsite:\n\nMargarita taking a stroll around the campground – she was fascinated by the free-roaming chickens!\n\nWe had a very nice stay at this campground.

None of us had ever been there before, but we had heard great things about this campground – and it truly was very pretty there.\n\nThis was an unusually cold weekend in September, but we made the best of it.\n\nWe enjoyed playing Scrabble…\n\n…And a walk on the beach:\n\nMost of all, we enjoyed our time with family!\n\nDelaware Water Gap / Pocono Mountain KOA: East Stroudsburg, PA\n\nWe had a “dock diving free” weekend last August , so we had the rare opportunity to camp with family. We chose the Delaware Water Gap / Pocono Mountain KOA .\n\nOur campsite was awesome, but there were power lines running right through the campground. It turned out not being a big deal, but definitely was something we were not used to seeing at a campground.\n\nMargarita enjoyed walking around the campground with her cousin James. We bought James his own little “Rita leash” that we attach along with the leash I am holding so that he can feel like he is walking her.\n\nWe enjoyed the relaxing weekend with family. It was nice not to have to get up early, or have any set plans for the weekend!\n\nOverall, despite the first impression we had with the power lines running through the campground, we had a great time playing miniature golf, taking a hay ride, exploring around the campground, and just relaxing!\n\nBrian captured one of my most favorite shots of Margarita and me sitting at the campfire on our campsite:\n\nYou can purchase the above “Never Camp Alone” t-shirt from Dog is Good!\n\nBoulder Woods Campground, Green Lane, PA\n\nBoulder Woods Campground for Jenny and Brian’s 10th Anniversary!\n\nOur camp site #17:\n\nAround the campground…\n\nWe had a relaxing weekend of walking, hanging out at our campsite, and playing board games.\n\nWe were lucky enough to enjoy our Anniversary dinner outside:\n\nThis was one of our rare camping trips where we didn’t have a dock diving event.

We hope you enjoyed your Thanksgiving as well!\n\nWolfies Campground: Zanesville, OH\n\nOn our road trip back home from the 2016 DockDogs World Championship, the one and only stop-over was at Wolfies Campground in Zanesville, OH.\n\nThis was a great stop-over with an easy pull-through site. The owners were very nice also!\n\nOur site (#41):\n\nMorning walk before we hit the road to our final destination…home!\n\nSwiss Valley Campground: Dubuque, IA\n\nAfter a long road trip from New Jersey to the 2016 DockDogs World Championship, we arrived in Dubuque, IA!\n\nEven though we stayed at the Holiday Inn in Downtown Dubuqe with all the other competitors, we had driven our motor home out to Iowa, and needed a place to park it for the week. Swiss Valley Campground was the perfect place! Once we saw this beautiful 62 acre park, we wish we had camped for the week instead of staying in the hotel!\n\nOur campsite (site #4):\n\nImmediately after arriving, we had to pack up all of our dock diving gear, and head over to the hotel in our rental car!\n\nThe two “Princess and the Pea” gals “helped” us pack:\n\nWe said goodbye to the camper for the week – but got to stay the night here at beautiful Swiss Valley Campground on our last night in Dubuque, IA, before heading back home to New Jersey.\n\nOur 2019 Stay:\n\nWe stayed here for the week during the 2019 DockDogs World Championship.\n\nOur Campsite (site #4):\n\nLimoncello and Margarita walking on the nature path:\n\nPorter, Lager, Whiskey, and Limoncello playing in the creek:\n\nHooch taking a walk through the campground:\n\nSouth Bend / Elkhart North Koa: Granger, IN\n\nOur second stop-over on the way to the 2016 DockDogs World Championship was at South Bend / Elkhart North Koa in Granger, IN.\n\nOur Campsite:\n\nMorning walks and some relaxing time before we hit the road on our last leg of our road trip to Dubuque, Iowa:\n\nUpdating our “Miles-To-Iowa” sign!\n\nShawnee State Park: Schellsburg, PA\n\nOn our long trip out to Iowa for the 2016 DockDogs World Championship, our first stop-over was at Shawnee State Park in Schellsburg, PA.

I hope we get to come back to this state park for a weekend camping trip sometime soon!\n\nPomona RV Park and Campground, Egg Harbor City, NJ\n\nAll of our camping trips revolve around the pups’ dock diving competitions, except the holiday camping trips we take on Easter and Thanksgiving. We very rarely catch a free weekend – let alone one that matches up with another camping buddy. However, this particular weekend in October we were able to make it happen!\n\nThis was only our second trip in the new RV. I decided to ride on the couch with the pups for a little bit to help get them settled.\n\nAll settled in and ready to roll!\n\nIt was a very chilly weekend, but we enjoyed every minute at Pomona RV Park and Campground!\n\nYou would never know this campground was just 10 minutes away from Atlantic City Casinos, boardwalk, and beaches, as it was very quiet and peaceful!\n\nWe stayed on site C3:\n\nCampground map:\n\nLager just loves his new GLAMping window!\n\nWe spent quite a bit of time indoors getting a break from the cold, and enjoying getting to know our new camper. We could relax for sure knowing Lager and Limoncello were on patrol!\n\nHooch and Rita decided to let Cello and Lager do all the patrolling while they soaked up the GLAMping life!\n\nWe did get some warmer temps where we were able to sit outside and enjoy the fresh air – Rita seems to be more of a cold-weather kind of gal, as she enjoyed every minute sitting outside!\n\nIt was a wonderful weekend (not too far) away! We appreciated time with friends, we were delighted to spend some time figuring out all the buttons and controls on the new RV, and enjoyed the campfires each night!\n\nLancaster/New Holland KOA: First Trip With Our New Camper\n\nThose of you who have been following our adventures from the start, know that we started out tent camping, moved on to a travel trailer, and then a 5th Wheel. Even though we enjoyed all of our camping methods, once we adopted Margarita, we discovered that we needed to travel in a way where all of us could be a little bit more comfortable while on the road.

This campground even has a hotel on the grounds, AND even has a dog beach!\n\nRita enjoyed her Glamping adventure here!\n\nThe Colonies RV and Travel Park, Fort Monroe, VA\n\nThe Colones RV and Travel Park is probably THE coolest place we’ve camped!

She got LOTS of attention from everyone!\n\nEaster 2016: Old Mill Stream Campground, Lancaster, PA\n\nThis year’s Easter camping trip was at Old Mill Stream Campground in Lancaster, PA. We had a great view, and a wonderful weekend with friends!\n\nOur campsite (Site 125):\n\nView from our campsite:\n\nThis campground is located at Dutch Wonderland and offers discounted tickets for the amusement park. The amusement park was closed during our Easter visit.\n\nOld Mill Stream is also very close to many area attractions and shopping in Lancaster, PA.

It was also right on the water, and although we weren’t able to secure a waterfront site, we had a water view from our campsite:\n\nWith just a short walk to the water’s edge, we had a wonderful time walking the pups!\n\nThis campground offers cabins, cottages, on site rental trailers, and campsites.

They have 5 sites available for transient campers, like us, and also have two cabins available for renting.\n\nWoodlands is totally surrounded by Elk Neck State Forest, and is is only a short drive away from many other Chesapeake Bay area attractions.\n\nWe stayed on site 120:\n\nOur site was right at the Veterans Memorial, which they were working on the weekend we stayed at the campground.\n\nAround the campground…\n\n2018 Update\n\nWe stayed at this campground again – but this time with our Class A camper – and this time on site 47. Site 47 is my new favorite campsite!\n\nBrian and Whiskey\n\nSite 47 was so spacious, and perfect for walking the dogs!\n\nWhat a large living space for a campsite!\n\nBrian and Whiskey taking a walk through the campground.\n\nEagles Peak Campground, Robesonia, PA\n\nWe were invited by friends to camp at Eagles Peak Campground in Robesonia, PA. What a GREAT weekend we had!\n\nWe had a very large, pull-through site (site 238).\n\nThis campground had lots of cool features for kids!\n\nThe “Fun Zone” had a variety of inflatable slides and obstacle courses.\n\nThe Eagles Peak Grand Prix is a race course for remote control cars:\n\nMiniature Golf Course:\n\nThis campground also had two pools (one for the kids, and one for the adults) but the pools were not open for the season yet.\n\nWe enjoyed walking around the campground, sitting around the campfire, and cooking up an incredible feast of crabs, clams, shrimp, filet mignon,\n\ncorn, potatoes, onions, broccoli, and asparagus with our group of friends! YUM!\n\nJust a short drive brought us to a beautiful hike in Nolde Forest.\n\nIt was a fun weekend filled with good friends, fun conversation, interesting adventures, and delicious food!\n\nEaster 2015 – Frontier Town Campground: Berlin, MD\n\nThis Easter we camped with friends at one of our favorite campgrounds – Frontier Town Campground, in Berlin, MD.\n\nWe LOVED our campsite here!\n\nWe first discovered Frontier Town Campground when we attended a dock diving competition held right in the campground! We camped here for the dock diving competition as well.\n\nHere is the view from our site:\n\nThe water views around the campground are gorgeous!\n\nThis was Hooch’s first-ever Easter! It was exciting to make his basket for the first time!\n\nCello’s Easter basket:\n\nEaster morning – the Easter Bunny has arrived to the 5th Wheel with toys and treats!\n\nCello and Hooch had a great time opening their Easter baskets with the help of their Pop!\n\nAfter Cello and Hooch opened their Easter baskets, they had an Easter egg hunt in the 5th Wheel! …see if you can find all the “hidden” eggs!\n\nYay! Hooch found his first bacon-filled Easter egg!\n\nAfter each egg is found, the pup who found the egg gets the bacon inside of the egg – Hooch thought this was LOTS of fun, and waited patiently for his bacon reward!\n\nHooch enjoyed all his Easter treats and toys – and, of course, stole Cello’s bunny toy!\n\nOverall, we had a great trip, and Hooch enjoyed his first-ever Easter!\n\nFirst Trip With Our New 5th Wheel – Elk Neck State Park, North East, MD\n\nSix days after getting our new 5th Wheel, we took a trip to one of our favorite places – Elk Neck State Park.\n\nCello and Hooch had their travel buddies, Olaf and Hulk to keep them company on our ride.\n\nWe have always stayed in the North East Loop of the campground, but this was the first time we have stayed on this campsite. However, this was not the site we booked!\n\nBacking the 5th Wheel in for the first time did not go as smoothly as planned. It had rained a lot the few days prior to us arriving to the campground, so the ground was very wet and soggy. As we were trying to back in to our reserved spot, the truck got stuck in the mud! A nice man came to our rescue and towed us out! We wound up having to switch campsites with our friends because we could not get our 5th Wheel into our reserved campsite.\n\nFinally in our new campsite, safe and sound!\n\nCello has been to Elk Neck State Park several times already, (see below) – but this was Hooch’s first time visiting this great park! Cello has been to Elk Neck State Park three other times prior to this trip:\n\nThanksgiving 2012\n\nValentine’s Day 2013\n\nThanksgiving 2013\n\nThe weather was not so great when we first arrived. However, we did bundle up and take a nice long walk around the campground.\n\nThe weather continued to worsen, and it began to SNOW! Cello and Hooch could not believe their eyes!\n\nThe cold snowy weather gave us some time to enjoy our new 5th Wheel. Cello and Hooch settled right in, and seem to love their new home-away-from-home!\n\nUnfortunately, we also had our first injury to report in our new 5th Wheel. Cello and Hooch were playing, and both dogs dove for a toy that had gone under one of the recliners. Before we knew it, Cello dove under the recliner, and cut herself very close to her eye. We are very lucky she missed her eye!\n\nLuckily the weather warmed up a bit on our last day, and we were able to take a nice long walk and visit the beach! Hooch also got to play with his Vizsla buddy, Dash!\n\nHooch: Cello: We had a great first trip in our new 5th Wheel, and very much enjoyed all of the new upgrades and luxuries that we did not have in our travel trailer. We are looking forward to many camping trips and fond memories to come in our new camper!"
