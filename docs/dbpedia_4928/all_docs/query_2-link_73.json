        "meta_description": "Frank Anthony Castillo (b. April 1, 1969 – d. July 28, 2013 at age 44) was a MLB starting pitcher. Castillo played for the Chicago Cubs (1991–1997), Colorado Rockies (1997), Detroit Tigers (1998), Toronto Blue Jays (2000), Boston Red Sox (2001–2002, 2004), and Florida Marlins (2005). A sixth round pick by the Cubs in the 1987 amateur draft, Castillo made his major league debut in 1991.\n\t\n\tHis most productive season came in 1995, when he posted career numbers in wins (11), ERA (3.21) and shutouts (2), while matching a career-high 135 strikeouts in 188 innings pitched.\n\t\n\tAfter missing the entire 1999 season due to injury Frank Castillo signed with the Toronto Blue Jays as a free agent on December, 2000. With a cheap $375,000 contract it’s likely safe to say the Jays weren’t expecting great things from Castillo that season. At season’s end Castillo was 10-5 with a 3.59 ERA and a 1.22 WHIP in 25 appearances. That was the best ERA and best WHIP in the rotation and he tied for second in wins on the team.\n\t\n\tCastillo drowned in Bartlett Lake in Arizona on July 28, 2013, at the age of 44, while boating near his home with his family. \n\t\n\tCareer statistics:\n\tWin–loss record  82–104\n\tERA - 4.56\n\tStrikeouts - 1,101",
