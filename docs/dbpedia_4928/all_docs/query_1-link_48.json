        "text": "Category: Encouragement\n\n“Living Carefully”\n\nMonday, August 15, 2011\n\nThis past Saturday we had an Antique Tractor Expo hosted by Dave Becker on his farm about 4 miles from our home. I passed the site Friday in the course of my travels and decided to attend the expo on Saturday. (See below for more photos.)\n\nListen to this message on your audio player.\n\n“Living Carefully”\n\n“Be very careful, then, how you live–not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil” (Ephesians 5:15,16).\n\nI just read an article by Albert Mohler asserting that we are in the midst of a “Moral Revolution” in which he observes that long held standards of morality are being thrown by the wayside. He writes, “There is no escaping the fact that we are living in the midst of a moral revolution. And yet, it is not the world around us that is being tested, so much as the believing church. We are about to find out just how much we believe the Gospel we so eagerly preach.”\n\nThings are becoming increasingly topsy-turvey with the continued slide into decadence and denial of God’s ways. The prophet Isaiah’s words from 2,700 years ago are so amazingly timeless and powerful. “Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter” (Isaiah 5:20).\n\nThe Apostle Paul wrote, “For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God’s sight” (1 Corinthians 3:19). Consider the timely message of these verses in light of the evil behavior that pervades our world today. Those who engage in wicked behavior have been exalted as role models and trend setters while those who continue to hold to God’s holy standards are now being referred to as the “evil ones” for standing in the way of progress.\n\nYesterday I preached from Ephesians 5:15-20 and challenged our church to use the opportunities God places before us. The daily verse expresses an outstanding expression of truth. I have memorized it and encourage you to do so as well. What a somber expression of reality, as vitally needed today as when the Apostle Paul wrote it nearly 2,000 years ago.\n\nWe need to be very careful how we live. Our enemy, the devil, goes about like a prowling lion seeking whom he may devour. Many have lowered their guard but we must resist him, standing firm in our faith.\n\nWe need to “live–not as unwise but as wise.” We need “the wisdom that comes from heaven” (James 3:17) and this wisdom is increasingly contrary to the wisdom of the world. Remember the old saying, “What’s popular may not always be right and what’s right may not always be popular.” Jesus never let the desire for acceptance or popularity among his hearers dictate the truths he would disclose or errors He would refute.\n\n“The days are evil.” In seeking the true wisdom that comes from heaven I want my eyes to be open to the evil, not blinded by it.\n\nAs God’s people seeking to live out our faith in these evil days we need to make the most of every opportunity, which the KJV translates as “redeeming the time.” Opportunities abound for the Spirit led, earnest follower of Christ.\n\nToday how can you and I make the most of every opportunity to express our faith in Christ? As we are open to the daily opportunities God provides for us, seeking to make the most of them, we are living as those who are wise and fortifying ourselves against the evils of our day.\n\nI suggest three commonly held opportunities we have today:\n\n1) The opportunity to walk with God.\n\n2) The opportunity to witness for Christ.\n\n3) The opportunity to worship in the Spirit.\n\nBe encouraged today,\n\nStephen & Brooksyne Weber\n\nFather, we can be devoured by the evil that surrounds us if we don’t walk in the light of Your truth. We want to walk in the true wisdom that comes from heaven, not in the flawed wisdom that comes from the world. Help us to make the most of every opportunity to stand up for divine truth in our speech and in our actions. We want to be the light that shines forth revealing the creeping darkness of our land so that we can show others the way to eternal life. In the name of Your dear Son, Jesus, we pray. Amen.\n\nDave Becker, a local farmer with a tremendous interest in old time farming, has an annual expo on his farm attracting what seemed like thousands from all over the area. I first met Dave shortly after moving to Lancaster County and rode with him the first time I ever rode in a combine.\n\nThe tractor pulling contest had a lot of spectators and serious contenders!\n\nOld wagon with loose hay.\n\nHay wagon in barn.\n\nOld wagons\n\nThey had lots of people attending the expo and several family rides as well. I especially like this photo because it’s the same kind of tractor my Uncle Gentry had on his farm in southern Missouri when I was growing up. I have a lot of great memories on that tractor which was the first I ever drove.\n\nWe see this popular “train” ride at many local activities.\n\nThe train “cars” are made from 55 gallon barrels!\n\nDisplays of other old-time equipment such as these laundry tubs – some of you will remember those days. The Amish community continues to use ringer washers.\n\nToday’s Suggested Music and Supplemental Resources\n\n“Take My Life And Let It Be” Video Christ For The Nations Choir\n\n“Take Time To Be Holy” Video Collingsworth Family\n\n“This Little Child” Video Scott Wesley Brown This song is some 25 years old now but seems prophetic in light of how conditions have changed.\n\nHere’s the article by Albert Mohler referred to in today’s message.\n\nSend a message to Stephen & Brooksyne.\n\nPlease help us continue this free encouragement ministry\n\nMinistry Update (Revised 12/31/10)\n\nSign up here for the free daily email encouragement.\n\n“Wrong Way Concurrence”\n\nFriday, August 12, 2011\n\nWe had a beautiful day yesterday here in Lancaster County with lower temperatures and humidity, a welcome relief! Many of the Amish folks use a solar-powered clothes dryer.\n\nListen to this message on your audio player.\n\n“Wrong Way Concurrence”\n\n“Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish, but how far will they go among so many?” (John 6:9).\n\nLast week I shared a photo of an interstate directional sign I took along our journey and inquired as to what “spiritual” lesson there might be in the photo. It happens to be an example of what is known as a “wrongway concurrence”.\n\nNow in highway verbiage a concurrence occurs when two numbered routes use the same section of road. For instance in our area US Routes 11 and 15 run together through central Pennsylvania so that for awhile you are on both 11 North and 15 North at the same time.\n\nA wrong way concurrence occurs when two routes run together but in apparently opposite directions. In the case of the photo there is a section where you are on I-81 north and I-77 south at the same time near Wytheville Virginia. The routes run concurrently seemingly in opposite directions based on the signage! (See here on a Google map)\n\nIn his book, “The Invisible Hand”, theologian R.C. Sproul points out that “the doctrine of concurrence refers to historical events in which the work of Providence has been acted out through human agencies. This means at the same time human agents are acting, God is acting in and through them.”\n\nToday’s story is found in John 6:1-13 and recounts an occasion when a great crowd had followed Jesus to the east side of the Sea of Galilee. Jesus then instructed His disciples to provide a meal for the thousands who had gathered rather than sending them home to eat. Trouble is, He gave no instructions on how they were to successfully carry out this impossible feat. Philip, who apparently had some accounting background quickly calculated, “Eight months’ wages would not buy enough bread for each one to have a bite!” (Rather impressive math, since this was before they had “smart” phones.)\n\nAnother disciple, Andrew, brought a boy to Jesus who had “five small barley loaves and two small fish”. Now I find the preciseness in the description interesting, especially the designation “small” in both cases. I suppose the boy’s mother had packed him a lunch adequate for his needs. Perhaps he, in his simple logic, approached Andrew with the offering of his lunch. Andrew probably felt a bit foolish suggesting this meager offering to Jesus so he followed it up with this sensible question, “but how far will they go among so many?”\n\nJesus didn’t answer him or try to reason with him. He had the people sit down and performed a mighty miracle of multiplication.\n\nToday we need to understand that God is active even in the most mundane parts of our lives in ways that may seem senseless, such as the boy’s tiny contribution. This little boy had no idea when he took his lunch that day that he would be memorialized in Scripture, but the Lord used his tiny portion to feed a vast crowd of 5,000, with leftovers to boot!\n\nGod is still working in the “mundane” today. And he’s still working in ways that may be similar to a wrongway concurrence. This little boy should give us incentive to heed the words of Paul: “Be very careful, then, how you live–not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil” (Ephesians 5:15,16).\n\nSmall, seemingly insignificant, acts of faith and obedience have a major part in the mosaic of God’s master plan for our lives. We may desire to do something great for God, but often His plan is the simple day by day acts of obedience to Him in following His leadings, both large and small. We’ll just have to wait and see how it all fits together. May the Lord help us, like the young boy and Andrew, to do what is within our power and trust God for the results!\n\nBe encouraged today,\n\nStephen & Brooksyne Weber\n\nDaily prayer: Father, we’re grateful for the supernatural work You perform in our lives. Help us to follow Your leading in the small day to day promptings we receive from Your Spirit as we go about our activities. The miraculous way You provided for a crowd of thousands from one youngster’s lunch is a great reminder that You take what we offer, multiply it, and use it for Your intended purpose. All glory be Yours in Jesus’ name. Amen.\n\nFriday, August 12, 2011\n\nHere’s a photo of the entire Steincross family who were able to attend the family reunion this past weekend in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. We managed to snag a non family member who was walking by to take the photo. For those who are in our family, those who may know us, or for any who may be just plain curious here is a larger version!\n\nYesterday we resumed our chaplain visitation and in the course of our work passed through beautiful Amish Country.

Our neighbor graciously mowed our front lawn on Monday and it already needs mown again! The corn across from our house is doing very well and provides a beautiful foreground to sunsets during this season although I have a hard time catching it in a photo. Last night’s sunset was outstanding! A farmer friend told me how pleased the farmers are with all the rain as this will allow them to shell their corn (which is of more value) rather than chop it up for sileage.\n\nFor many years I have enjoyed watching sunrises and sunsets (mostly sunsets). As the sun rises I contemplate the activities that will occupy my day. As the sun sets I consider what was accomplished throughout the day. Wherever you live on this planet you have a sunrise and sunset but it’s not a distinct visible moment for all to view at the same time. Today’s text states that, “They who dwell in the ends of the earth stand in awe of Your signs.” Sunrise and sunset are signs reminding us of God’s greatness and faithfulness that all who dwell in the ends of the earth can see.\n\nToday’s photo is a sunset over Newport, Rhode Island I took several years ago. Water seems to be a perfect setting for a reflective, golden sunset. I don’t really seem to have the equipment or skills to take the beautiful sunset pictures I often see in calendars, but I am pleased wih the way this one turned out and it brings to mind another ocean sunset memory, although I have no photo record of it.\n\nWe traveled via ferry to Martha’s Vineyard a number of years ago. At Menemsha Harbor we visited with our dear friends John and Hope Winchoba along with Rachel, Hope’s sister, who had a small cottage on the island. That evening visitors and residents arranged their beach chairs in a long single line on the sand. We also took our seats, each wanting to take in the beauty of a sunset on the northwest side of the island. Quietly enthralled with the natural beauty of the glowing sunset it would seem that viewers were nearly in a trance.\n\nBut then as the sun disappeared over the ocean, with no warning, the islanders who had been so quiet suddenly erupted in loud applause with everyone standing to their feet. One by one the viewers echoed, “Encore! Encore!” (We didn’t get one.) It was an astounding sight and memorable experience. Most were clapping for the sheer beauty they witnessed, but for my family and friends, it was another opportunity to praise the Lord. We were among those “who dwell in the ends of the earth stand(ing) in awe of Your (God’s) signs.”\n\nThe Scripture verse continues, “You make the dawn and the sunset shout for joy.” That sure is an interesting way to view a dawn and a sunset; shouting for joy. Wherever you live, even to the ends of the earth, remember this verse when the sun rises and when the sun sets and join in praise to the indescribable God of the universe! Truly, “From the rising of the sun to its setting the Name of the Lord is to be praised!”\n\nBe encouraged today,\n\nStephen & Brooksyne Weber\n\nDaily prayer: From the rising of the sun until the time that it sets I praise You, Almighty God! Your name is to be praised when the day is before me, in the middle of the afternoon, and when the day comes to an end. Your faithfulness reaches to the heavens, spreads throughout the earth, and is personally experienced in my life daily. As high as the heavens above, so great is the measure of Your wondrous love. You are great and greatly to be praised. Amen.\n\nJohn and Hope Winchoba were an elderly couple who attended our church in Massachusetts. John died in 1999 while I was there and Hope several years ago. They were a tremendous blessing. Here’s a tribute I wrote following Hope’s passing in August 2008. Hope had long ties to Matha’s Vineyard, having visited there as a child and was also a descendant of two different families from the Mayflower. She and John lived on West Island, near New Bedford.\n\nFinally, A Few More Scenes From Our Journey To Tennessee\n\nBristol, Tennessee and Bristol, Virginia are two different towns separated by a Main Street (State Street) that runs down the state line! A train was stopped the entire time I waited to take a photo so I just figured a train is always a good thing to have a photo of! Here’s a better photo of the sign w/o the train!\n\nNormally you don’t take photos in bathrooms but I thought this was kind of interesting.

I frankly didn’t give it much thought at the time but we’re sure glad our brakes worked!\n\nYesterday we toured the Bristol Speedway and Dragstrip. This was one of the best tours I’ve ever been on. The tour guide took us down the drag strip hitting a nerve-racking* 60 mph at the ¼ mile mark and thankfully stopping (without a parachute) before we hit the bluff at the end. The real dragsters go over 300 mph in that distance and have a parachute to brake or else! The speedway tour also included several laps around the highly banked race track where drivers rely on their brakes functioning properly or they would be in real trouble.\n\nThat sure got me thinking. I’m confident that not one of you would venture out on the road in your car today if you knew that your brakes didn’t work. Even though your intent was to get to a particular destination and value the accelerator petal, all through the trip, and certainly at the end you expect to apply your brakes. If you’ve ever had a brake malfunction you know what a blessing stopping is!\n\nMy most heartpounding brake experience took place over 30 years ago. I drove a school bus to supplement our income when we planted a church in northern Pennsylvania which is a very mountainous region. Mostly I drove kids to and from school but I was asked to make a special trip driving an adult fellowship from the Shiloh Presbyterian Church to a Penn State football game in State College. A designated bus was used for these longer trips but I received no special training on how to drive it.\n\nAs I was going down a long grade on a mountain I pumped the brakes as I was accustomed to doing on my other bus. But this bus had air brakes and the more I pumped the less brake power I had until I lost them completely. To this day I still can’t explain how I was able to stop the bus short of divine intervention without having an accident, but that experience is a lasting reminder of the blessing or should I say necessity of brakes!\n\nLet us consider the blessing of another type of brake in regard to our spiritual life. We may very well find it annoying, slowing us down or stopping us in places where we would rather see a green light. Tragically the vast majority are charging right through the red lights as they completely disregard the God-ordained brakes that He so wisely and graciously provides, such as this passage from I Corinthians 15:34: “Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning.”\n\n1) The brake of Scriptural commands and prohibitions. God’s Word has both “go” and “stop” commands. When facing temptation from the enemy we do well to recall the stop commands. Our text today states, “My people are destroyed from lack of knowledge.” This is speaking about the knowledge of God and His Word. So many disregard this knowledge and we see our society racing headlong to most certain judgment. The faithful church and ministry will continue to “devote themselves to the apostles’ teaching” (Acts 2:42) and “contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all handed down to the saints” (Jude 3).\n\n2) The brake of Godly counsel. Solomon wrote, “My son, do not forget my teaching, but keep my commands in your heart, for they will prolong your life many years and bring you prosperity” (Proverbs 3:1,2). We need to heed the counsel of the wise and esteem the elderly who have gone on before us. Wisdom has been defined as “knowledge rightly applied.”\n\n3) The brake of Holy Spirit guidance. The Holy Spirit not only compels us to move forward but at times will lead us to stop. Paul was intending to continue his mission work in Asia Minor when he had his Macedonian vision where the Holy Spirit essentially stopped him and led him in another direction. “When they came to the border of Mysia, they tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus would not allow them to” (Acts 16:7). As we walk with the Lord, in sensitivity to His Spirit, we need to rejoice in both the goes and the stops!\n\n4) The brake of tradition. This point is most difficult to develop since many have developed a negative attitude toward tradition and even the Scriptures speak out against tradition in some circumstances. Certainly, tradition for tradition’s sake needs to be evaluated carefully. But it seems to me that an attitude prevails in the church among more than a few that “different” is seen as better, cooler, more appealing to a current generation. Good practices developed over years can be too quickly shrugged aside in favor of the new, without considering what significance is lost in the process. When we have Communion in our church and I am sure it is somewhat different than the New Testament Church which commemorated this God-ordained sacrament. Yet I hope there are more similarities than dissimilarities as we seek to hold true to the command of Christ who told His followers: “Do this in remembrance of me.”\n\nToday let us thank God for the blessing of brakes. When He flashes the yellow light of caution we need to slowly, carefully, and Scripturally assess the situation. When He flashes the red light we need to STOP!\n\nBe encouraged today,\n\nStephen & Brooksyne Weber\n\nDaily prayer: Father, it is because of Your wise, loving ways that You teach us about the wiles of our adversary, the devil, and his cunning ways. We are not caught unaware but recognize his strategy as we regularly read Your Word and store it up in our hearts. Your knowledge is powerful as it opens the eyes of our hearts. Your precepts are right and because of that we hate every wrong path. Direct our footsteps according to Your Word so that we are in pace with You, observing the yellow lights of caution and stopping at the red lights of danger. As we do so we will not allow sin to rule over us. Amen.\n\n* Just kidding about the nerve-racking, but she really did step on it!\n\nSome More Scenes From Our Journey\n\nThe Weber family at the 2011 reunion.\n\nAll four of us Weber kids were able to attend this year.\n\nStephen’s first cousins\n\nOur tour included a visit to the very posh Burton Smith owner’s suite.\n\nThe banks at Bristol Speedway are famously steep, among the steepest in any NASCAR racetrack.

It’s nice to see the family working together.\n\nListen to this message on your audio player.\n\n“Debt Crisis Solved!”\n\n“When you were dead in your transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made you alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our transgressions, having canceled out the certificate of debt consisting of decrees against us, which was hostile to us; and He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross” (Colossians 2:13,14).\n\nHere in the USA we have been hearing a lot about debt. I understand that this situation is true in many countries regarding government debt. Ours is now at a startling figure of 14 trillion dollars and rapidly rising which is over $46,000 for each citizen. So, my family’s share of the national debt is nearly $140,000.\n\nOur politicians are hashing out ways of dealing with it and a big deadline looms tomorrow. The situation is so dire that although I am not being apocalyptic I have virtually no faith that there is a political solution out of this mess.\n\nHowever we have a far greater debt problem regardless of where we live. Ellis Crum penned the lyrics of a song that describes the sin dilemma that each person born into this world deals with: “I owed a debt I could not pay”. It’s an overwhelming debt that leads to a hopeless situation.\n\nI am of course speaking of sin’s debt. So many live in ignorance and denial of this debt but it is a debt that every single human must deal with now or later. In fact it is a far more serious situation than the national debt of any country or the personal financial debt of any individual. How we deal with this debt has eternal consequences.\n\nBut I am pleased to share today that upon study of the Holy Scriptures a full payment has been made! It is in fact the very heart of the gospel (Good News). “For Christ also died for sins once for all, the just for the unjust, so that He might bring us to God, having been put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit” (1 Peter 3:18). The certificate of debt has been canceled out. The stamp on the certificate of the redeemed reads, “Paid In Full”.\n\nSo how do we respond? First we believe by placing our faith in Christ and receiving His free gift.\n\nThen we declare verbally and through our life, “Jesus Paid It All, All to Him I Owe!” In view of God’s mercy, we offer our bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to Him, which is our spiritual act of worship. (See Romans 12:1)\n\nModern songwriter Graham Kendrick wrote this,\n\nAmazing love, O what sacrifice,\n\nthe Son of God, given for me;\n\nMy debt He pays and my death He dies,\n\nthat I might live, that I might live.\n\nWhile some 300 years ago Isaac Watts wrote,\n\nLove so amazing, so divine,\n\nDemands my soul, my life, my all.\n\nBe encouraged today,\n\nStephen & Brooksyne Weber\n\nDaily prayer: Jesus, thank You for solving my debt problem by dying on the cross for me. I owed a debt I couldn’t pay but, because of Your great love for me, You paid in full the debt of my sins. You made me alive together with You, having forgiven me all my transgressions, having canceled out the certificate of debt consisting of decrees against me. Your love is so amazing and so divine that it demands my soul, my life, my all. In view of Your mercy, I offer my body as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to You, which is my spiritual act of worship.

A plan was recently proposed by a school superintendent to purchase belts for the students at a cost of nearly $5,000.00 (as if they will actually wear them).

But the Lord God called to man, ‘Where are you?'” (Genesis 3:8,9). “For the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost” (Luke 19:10). “Today, if you hear His voice do not harden your hearts” (Hebrews 3:7,15; 4:7).\n\nWe enjoy the unique sounds of the country. The clickety-clack of a horse and buggy slowly passing by our home, farm machinery working in a field, wind and rain splattering on the metal roof of our small barn, the neighborhood woodpecker persistently pecking away at the creaking tree.\n\nOf course we especially like the constant bird sounds that we hear as we prepare these messages. The most dominant evening sound we hear, during this late summer season, is the locusts. I think they’re in competition with all of nature to be the loudest!\n\nThere are special sounds wherever you live, sounds that you become familiar with and perhaps even take for granted. I hope there are enough pleasant sounds to drown out the undesirable noises!\n\n“Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the LORD God as He was walking in the garden.” Have you ever wondered what God sounded like as He walked in the garden? Apparently Adam and Eve had become familiar with this distinct sound and recognized it. Prior to the Fall it was a sound they surely cherished, but now they were attempting to hide. That distinct sound, which once brought joy and anticipation, now brought shame and dread. What a difference sin makes!\n\nThe very first recorded words of God following the Fall were, “Where are you?” God, whose very nature is to “seek and save that which is lost”, called out, while Adam and Eve sought to hide. Their hiding was futile.\n\nThus begins the grand story of God’s redeeming love, what Bible teacher W. Graham Scroggie calls “the scarlet thread of redemption” which runs through the Bible. He writes, “Christ is predicted in the Old Testament, present in the Gospels, proclaimed in the Acts, possessed in the Epistles, and predominant in the Revelation.”\n\nToday God continues to call out. If you listen you will hear His voice. Three times the writer of Hebrews quotes an Old Testament Psalm, “Today, if you hear His voice do not harden your hearts” (3:7,15; 4:7). We encourage you to respond to His voice today. Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling!\n\nCome home, come home.\n\nYe who are weary, come home.\n\nEarnestly, tenderly Jesus is calling,\n\nCalling, “O sinner, come home!”\n\nBe encouraged today,\n\nStephen & Brooksyne Weber\n\nDaily prayer: Jesus, day after day, we hear familiar voices and repeated sounds that have become a routine part of our lives. In the midst of all the clamoring noises we want to make time in our busy schedule to become familiar with Your voice so that we’re led by Your spirit in that which we do and say. We want to be quick in hearing Your prompting voice remind us, “This is the way” when tempted to walk in our own ways. We want Your Holy Spirit to convict and bring us to repentance when we have sinned. We also want to be familiar with Your affirming voice that says, “Well done” when we have been obedient to Your beckoning call. Soften our hearts, Lord, so that we not only hear Your voice, but we also feel Your compassion for those whom You bring into our lives today. In Your Name we pray. Amen.\n\nSome Scenes From Area\n\nWe saw lots of harvest activity yesterday.

Though a very wealthy and successful writer he chose to play and sing to small churches throughout the Midwest. In 1899 Mr. Thompson paid a visit to the famous evangelist D.L. Moody, who was very ill and near death. Most visitors were turned away, but when Moody heard that Thompson was downstairs, he called for him. “Will,” he said, “I would rather have written ‘Softly and Tenderly Jesus is Calling,’ more than anything I have been able to do in my whole life.” Obviously the message of this hymn deeply touched the heart of D.L.

They could find no corruption in him, because he was trustworthy and neither corrupt nor negligent” (Daniel 6:4).\n\nAndy Larrimore is a long-time friend from New England who runs his own website design business, developing websites for both secular companies and churches. He began work on a large multi-thousand dollar secular account when he encountered a problem. He noted that the site would contain material that he had determined in the formation of his business he would not work on.\n\nHe declined the job and wrote back to the client; “Several years ago I accepted Jesus Christ into my heart, and as a Christian have determined to live by the principles set forth in the Bible. I determined when I started my web design business that I would continue to follow the Scriptures in my business dealings and my company would abide by them no matter what the financial impact it may be. One of the policies I established is: ‘Webs by Andy will not build or consult on web sites that contain or will contain material of an adult only nature, language of a morally questionable nature, profanity or other morally offensive content’.” He had clearly drawn his line in the sand and he stood by it. We sure need people who live by their principles today don’t we?\n\nSome sixty years separate the events described in our two daily texts. The first describes Daniel as a young man separated from his family after being taken captive into Babylon. He made a purposeful resolution to stay true to his faith. I have always drawn strength and encouragement from this verse and consider the unseen influence of his parents and other godly leaders when he was young in equipping him for such a decision.\n\nThe second describes Daniel as an old man, still faithfully serving God and admired even among his most ardent critics for his integrity. Here we find him late in his career serving in government office during the reign of Darius, who happened to be the third world emperor he served under. His righteousness and Darius’ intention to further promote him prompted jealousy in the other leaders. They looked for a basis to make charges but were unable to find any. What a powerful testimony he had: “They could find no corruption in him, because he was trustworthy and neither corrupt nor negligent.” The events that follow lead to the lion’s den and one of the great stories of deliverance in the Bible.\n\nWhat a steadfast man Daniel was! Every generation needs men and women like him. Surely we need such strong unwavering followers of Christ today! The specific sources of temptation may vary, but we all need to “purpose in our heart” that we will stay faithful to God and His truth. Like Daniel we need to be trustworthy. How do people view our character? Are we trustworthy? Have we made a purposeful resolve to stay faithful? Let us take the proper steps to make sure that we do.\n\nBe encouraged today,\n\nStephen & Brooksyne Weber\n\nDaily prayer: Father, I thank you for the “Daniels” of our day. Many of us grew up with fathers and mothers who not only taught us right from wrong, but modeled it daily in their relations with family and others. So many today are growing up without Biblical models or Scriptural instruction which has brought about much confusion about what is right and wrong, true or false. The power of Your inspired Holy Word reveals absolute truth and is taught by examples of people such as Daniel. He didn’t allow his fear, pride, or earthly ambitions to compromise his integrity. Even as Daniel stood the test while continually overcoming the tempter, I pray that You, Father, would help us to prove our loyalty to You when faced with daily temptations, especially those that are subtle. May our resolve to do good far exceed our temptation to do evil. Amen.\n\nI have a framed copy of an old hymn that hangs on our office wall beside me as I work. It’s not well known and in fact I’m not sure I’ve ever seen it in a hymnal. It has long been out of copyright so I can share it here. Although written nearly 100 years ago like all Godly truths it is “forward compatible” (see Monday’s message).\n\nWe need more men like Daniel to stand for God and right;\n\nMen clean and strong, who hate the wrong,\n\nAnd for the truth will fight.\n\nWhen those controlled by evil their base designs pursue,\n\nWe need more men like Daniel who never prove untrue.\n\nWe need more men like Daniel their virtue here to show;\n\nMen bold, sincere, who know no fear when called to face the foe.\n\nThough dangers dark may threaten, they crave not ease or rest.\n\nWe need more men like Daniel who boldly stand the test.\n\nWe need more men like Daniel whose faith defied the king;\n\nWho knelt and prayed when plans were laid\n\nhis shameful death to bring.\n\nBut God sent down His angel His all to guard and shield;\n\nWe need more men like Daniel whose hearts will never yield. *\n\n* “More Men Like Daniel” Neal McAulay/Charles Gabriel © 1922 Homer Rodeheaver\n\nSome Scenes From Yesterday\n\nWe had a meeting in the morning then went over to our Amish friends, Jesse and Anna Ruth to see their new baby.

Becky grew up in the church we served in northern Pennsylvania, the daughter of our friends Greg and Linda Burns.\n\nHere’s a photo of the Burns family in 1986 at the groundbreaking for our new church building. Greg and Linda are holding their son, Danny, while Becky looks up with a big smile wondering what’s going on. I recently received notice that Daniel is now in missions service in Mexico with CAM International! A heartwarming pastoral story comes out of this home. One year I challenged the people to memorize a verse from each book of the Bible. I reasoned that when we get to heaven and meet Haggai, Habakkuk or other more obscure Bible characters it would be nice to recall something they wrote. So I carefully chose a verse from each book and over the course of 66 weeks challenged the people to memorize one selected verse per week. About half way through that same year we were visiting the Burns family and Becky, a very small child at that time, was memorizing these verses right along with her parents. She has told us she still remembered doing that (although she could not necessarily remember every verse now!) We considered that when we see these verses or hear them read, even if we don’t remember them word for word, we can remember the setting or book from which they came. That’s a blessing that remains even when much of our memories fade with time.\n\nToday’s Suggested Music and Supplemental Resources\n\n“I Am Resolved” Video Ernest V. Stoneman\n\n1.

He summed up his brief stay on earth which enabled him to speak long after he had drawn his last breath. It continues to speak over 200 years later and perhaps it will prompt you to consider what you would like written in your personal epitaph. Maybe this would be a good spiritual exercise that you could write while you have the presence of mind. A great place to write out your epitaph would be the inside cover of your Bible.\n\nJohn Newton, clerk,\n\nOnce an infidel and libertine,\n\nA servant of slaves in Africa,\n\nWas, by the rich mercy of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ\n\nPreserved, restored, pardoned\n\nAnd appointed to preach the faith he\n\nHad long labored to destroy.\n\nJohn Newton’s great hymn “Amazing Grace” is a song that I am sure practically anyone reading this has been blessed by many times. Most would list it among our favorite songs.\n\nAs John Newton aged his memory began to fail him. This is demonstrated in a poignant scene from the film “Amazing Grace” when Newton is shown in his aged condition declaring, “Although my memory is fading I remember two things very clearly. I am a great sinner and Christ is a great Savior.” His sight was also fading leading him to quote a line from his own hymn, “I once was blind but now I see”, He then asked, “Did I write that?” He was assured that he had and Newton said, “Now at last it’s true.”\n\nToday I would like to consider Newton’s self-description on his tombstone that states, “Once an infidel and libertine.” Now these are two words that we use quite infrequently these days. The first “infidel” means unbeliever and is used in the KJV of the Bible in such passages as 2 Corinthians 6:15 and 1 Timothy 5:8. However at the present time this word is most often used sneeringly by Muslims to describe all non-Muslims.\n\nThe second word is so rarely used that it needs defined. A libertine is one devoid of moral restraints, which is seen as unnecessary or undesirable, especially one who ignores or even spurns accepted morals and forms of behavior sanctified by the larger society, a dissolute person; usually a person who is morally unrestrained.\n\nFar too many people in our “good is evil” and “evil is good” framework have rejected the Bible and live under a libertine attitude which is seen as a desirable virtue. They proudly live as libertines free of moral restraints and sadly the libertine outlook has even infected the church. But to John Newton it was something that was radically changed at his time of conversion to Christ. It was important to him that his tombstone bear this witness.\n\nOur daily verse presents an interesting and often overlooked Biblical truth. “Grace is shown to the wicked.” The grace of the almighty God of the universe is abundantly demonstrated in His loving care to our world. Theologically speaking this is referred to as “common grace.” This demonstration of grace goes on moment by moment in a multitude of ways to all, even the vilest offender; the air we breathe, the livable climatic conditions, food and water.\n\nBut there is the special demonstration of grace extended to us through Jesus for our eternal salvation: “For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, so that you through His poverty might become rich” (2 Corinthians 8:9). This grace is available exclusively for those who earnestly believe in Jesus and accept His gift of salvation. This gift far exceeds the worth of all other gifts given to us by God!\n\nUnbelief and ingratitude have blinded many to this marvelous grace so that the vast majority of the world’s peoples “do not learn righteousness” which is evident in those walking in His grace. In our New Testament understanding they reject God’s grace through Jesus Christ. “They go on doing evil and regard not the majesty of the Lord.” Is this not a picture of so many?\n\nHow do we, as God’s chosen people, regard the grace of God today? The Scriptures state, “the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men. It teaches us to say “No” to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age, while we wait for the blessed hope—the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good” (Titus 2:11-14). That is the nature of the amazing grace transformation from an infidel and libertine to one “preserved, restored, pardoned.”\n\nLet us thank God for His amazing grace and never cease to be amazed by it.\n\nLet us “learn righteousness” and live our life in a manner that pleases Him.\n\nLet us regard the majesty of the Lord and reverently declare His praises daily.\n\nBe encouraged today,\n\nStephen & Brooksyne Weber\n\nDaily prayer: Father, Your abundant grace is poured out on humankind like showers of blessings, both for believer and unbeliever alike. Yet it is only as we appropriate Your saving grace that we turn away from evil and walk in the ways of righteousness. Many leaders and rulers have come and gone, but You, Father, are the eternal One whose kingdom knows no end. We humble ourselves in the light of Your majesty as we bring honor to Your holy name and live as a people who are eager to do what is good. Amen.\n\nSome butterflies from around our place\n\nYesterday as I walked about our lawn I see that the butterflies are in abundance.

Then joy will accompany him in his work all the days of the life God has given him under the sun” (Ecclesiastes 8:15). “Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord rather than for men” (Colossians 3:23).\n\nWe enjoy stopping by the “Village Farm Market” in the course of our travels. It is in a converted barn that has a variety of produce, deli items, sandwiches, and other home-made baked goods. As you can see in the photo they have a great variety and quantity of flowers and other ornamentals. I have to confess I’m drawn to the large selection of free food samples that easily surpasses the big warehouse stores!\n\nOver the last several months we have befriended the owner, Keith, who oversees a large staff of old-order Mennonites. They work with diligence, wait promptly on their customers, and spread joy throughout the store. Several weeks ago I was talking to him and we were sharing together of our common faith. He alluded to a lesser familiar verse in the Bible which was an observation made by the Queen of Sheba concerning Solomon: “Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.” Keith sees this as a good model as to how he should treat his employees.\n\nI asked permission to look through the closed doors where the food prep area takes place, and indeed I observed a happy work crew. In fact we often hear the Amish and old-order Mennonites singing as they work.\n\nHow’s your attitude toward your work today? The early part of the week is dreaded by many. The TGIF outlook seems to permeate our society. “TGIF” stands for “Thank God It’s Friday” and really reflects an attitude that the work week is finally over and now real living can begin (weekend party time).\n\nBut God’s Word says, “This is the day that the Lord has made, let us rejoice and be glad in it.” That is a constantly present tense reality. Each and every day is the day that the Lord has made and each and every day we are called to rejoice and be glad.\n\nI recall years ago going to BB’s, a discount store in rural Schaefferstown, PA, which is run by the Amish, a religious group that limits the use of modern technology. It’s a discount store with the interesting slogan, “Bents, Bumps and Bunch of Bargains”. The store has gas lanterns for lights and generators provide needed electricity for refrigeration. Several of the Amish employees sang aloud as they worked, rather oblivious to the entertained customers. Although I didn’t recognize the music, I understand they were singing hymns reflecting their joy and strong work ethic.\n\nNotice the phrase in the second daily Scripture text that states, “Joy will accompany him in his work.” What a great perspective to enjoy the work we do realizing that God has providentially placed us in the position we are in. The Amish people stocking shelves were not doing work we normally associate with being fulfilling. Anyone who has worked in retail knows the frustration of putting items neatly on display only to have customers move things around or worse yet, change their minds about an item and dispose of it far from its original location. Yet their joy was contagious and I smile as I reflect upon the experience.\n\nToday, like wise Solomon, we commend you to the enjoyment of life. Do your work wholeheartedly and let the light of Christ shine through you! May joy accompany you in your work all the days of the life God has given you under the sun.\n\nBe encouraged today,\n\nStephen & Brooksyne Weber\n\nDaily prayer: Father, we find pleasure and fulfillment in our work when we work at it heartily, as for You, primarily. We thank You for giving us the wherewithal to provide an income for our family where our financial needs are met. Certainly each workplace has its challenges, but as we look to You for strength, endurance and wisdom to deal with those challenges we find joy, thanksgiving, and fulfillment in our work. May others see heaven sent joy flow from our lives as we spread mutual respect and a strong work ethic in the workplace. In the name of Jesus we pray. Amen.\n\nSome flower scenes from around our place\n\nA peek into our backyard via our fence mounted planter.\n\nHibiscus that finally opened up their centers\n\nMounding Lantana with butterfly (Brooksyne’s personal favorite)\n\nWe have lots of butterflies and tomorrow we will show that collection.\n\nLavender Phlox\n\nView of flower bed in front of our porch.\n\n(Salvia, Zinnias, Celosia, Coleus & Marigolds)\n\nDiffused Marigold\n\nThe Village Farm Market is located east of Ephrata, PA along Rt 322 See here (Google map)\n\nRain, blessed rain!!!
