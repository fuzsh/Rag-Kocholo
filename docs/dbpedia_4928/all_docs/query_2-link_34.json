        "text": "The entire North Side of Chicago was on Cloud Nine celebrating the Cubs World Series win.\n\nEastwood baseball legend Frank Castillo always wanted to win a ring with the Cubs. He was drafted by Chicago in the sixth round of the 1987 Major League Baseball draft.\n\nHe was one pitch away from a no-hitter with the Cubs in 1995.\n\nEventually, Castillo was traded to the Rockies later on in his career, so he didn’t get the chance to bring the title to Wrigley Field.\n\nNeither was he able to see the Cubs break their 108 year-year-old World Series drought.\n\nAs CBS4 previously reported, Castillo died in a drowning accident in Arizona in 2013.\n\nHis father, Joe Castillo, sat down with CBS4 about the historic win for the ball club. He remembers his son always being told by fans, “Next year we’ll do it.”\n\nFrank Castillo may not have been able to see “next year,” happen in the stands or on the screen. But Joe Castillo knows his son would have been the first one out of the dugout to celebrate the long-awaited taste of victory.\n\n\"I'm sure he's up there in heaven jumping up for joy. That's something he wished he could've done it with the Cubs,” Joe Castillo said.\n\nJoe and the rest of the family plan to go to Frank’s grave to tell him the Cubs won the World Series."
