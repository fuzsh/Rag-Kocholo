        "text": "If we learn from failure and not success, I should have a Ph.D. by now\n\n“Have no fear of perfection – you’ll never reach it.”\n\n– Salvador Dali\n\nTerra Nova has been offline for almost a year, months of neglect on my part stemming from work, momentary and enduring distractions, and angst over the Scooter Cannonball1.\n\nStill, there’s no excuse2.\n\nShe turned over but failed to start when I started futzing with her in earnest about a month ago. I drained the gas, put in fresh fuel, and charged up the battery. No luck.\n\nI ordered a new YTZ12S battery at the local Yamaha/Honda/Suzuki/Kawasaki/Ducati/Can-am/Kymco/Kayo/Polaris/Sea-Doo dealer3, recovered from the shock of the price4, and waited.\n\nI picked up the battery on Wednesday and installed it on Saturday. And that’s when I did something really, really (really) stupid; I put it in backward, hooked up the cables and promptly blew the 50 amp main fuse5.\n\nI understand how it happened and if I would have taken another 30 seconds to think about it, I might have gotten it right. It’s one of those things I’ll never get over. In a way, that’s a good thing, because it lessens the chance I’ll do it again.\n\nThe screw-up becomes even more confounding when I vividly recall a story from Mark Day6, an old friend from high school.\n\nI mean vivid: He and I were sitting at a cafeteria table at Heskett Junior High School – now Heskett Middle School – in Bedford Heights, Ohio. He was describing how he accidentally dropped a wrench while working on his car.\n\nThe wrench – a Craftsman open-end – fell exactly across the two battery terminals and part of the battery top blew off. Mark was okay, but it was unexpected and scary.\n\nHe even drew a sketch – on white paper with a blue Bic ballpoint pen, seriously – of how the wrench hit the terminals. I can still see his sketch in my mind.\n\nI have never, ever, forgotten his story and I think of it every time I open a car hood. So Mark has probably saved me from blowing up my own battery more than once over the years.\n\nI went back to the Yamaha/etc. dealer and ordered two 50 amp main fuses7, since Gus, the parts guy8, did not have them in stock.\n\nI sent this story to a few friends, and a response from Karl Gelles about jumping a battery made me remember Mark Day’s experience.\n\nThe Yamaha fuse will arrive next week and I’ll pick up the installation again.\n\nWish me luck, or at least less stupidity. And let this tale be your Mark Day sketch when you work on your own battery.\n\n__________\n\n1 – Terra Nova is my 2012 Yamaha Super Tenere. I spent riding time aboard Terror and Erebus, the two Vespas, in preparation for the 2023 Scooter Cannonball. Not that it did much good.\n\n2 – Endurance, my 2000 BMW R1150GS, has been in statis for much longer. I think I’ll end up taking her to a shop for resuscitation.\n\n3 – That is not an exaggeration.\n\n4 – It was $238, the most I’ve ever paid for a battery.\n\n5 – Which is bad, but it’s better than burning out the ECU, the engine control unit. God knows what replacing that would cost.\n\n6 – Mark Day has graced this site with previous mentions. He and Tom McCray did an epic motorcycle ride from Cleveland to Virginia Beach in like 1976 that made me jealous. Good guys, both of them.\n\n7 – One for the bike and one for a spare.\n\n8 – Gus is a good guy and did not laugh once while I was there, explaining the problem. No telling what happened after I left, of course.\n\nPart 1: Why I Am Haunted by a Fellow Cannonball Rider\n\nNote from the mission historian: The 2023 Scooter Cannonball was an eight-day, 3,170 mile checkpointed ride across the U.S. from San Clemente, California, to Hilton Head, South Carolina. It started June 18th and ended June 25th. Cannonball events are held every two years and are limited to scooters of 278ccs or less.\n\nI piloted “HMS Terror,” #61, a 2016 Vespa 300cc GTS Super Sport (rounded up from its actual 278 by Piaggio marketing). She has about 22 hp and I named her after one of the two ships of the 1839 James Clark Ross Antarctic expedition.\n\nI rode very slowly and carefully and finished almost dead last.\n\n***\n\nDay 03 | Tuesday, June 20: Checkpoint 3 is a lonely three-pump fuel station selling only low 86 octane and diesel on a desolate stretch of New Mexico 197. The temperature hovers in the low 90s as I arrive with Virginia Cherry, a riding partner.\n\nThis is the Torreon Store and Gas Station in Cuba, New Mexico, a mandatory checkpoint1 worth 95 points, but we’d be stopping here even if we didn’t have to. The hot, dry air is sucking the life out of us, and despite the cool water in my Camelbak I’m dying for a cold bottle of Gatorade.\n\nWe’ve come about 257 miles today and have been hopscotching with fellow Cannonballers Stephen Terrien from New Hampshire and a few others.\n\nThat’s not unusual. Motorcyclists and scooterists tend to find their own pace and often encounter those traveling at similar speeds.\n\nWe exchange greetings and commiserate over the heat; it’s good to see them again, to know they’re okay.\n\nWe fuel up and do the Cannonball documentation with our smartphones, sending photos and GPS coordinates to event organizers to prove we are here. Then we hit the store for drinks and the restroom, which is unexpectedly elegant in an Algonquin-of-the-West sort of way.\n\n“Steve, visit the restroom even if you don’t have to pee,” I say. “It looks amazing. You’ll thank me later.”\n\n“I will,” Stephen says, and laughs.\n\nOther riders arrive, fuel up and leave, including Charles Beck2 from South Carolina and Steve Putnam3 from Florida. They’re moving fast and steady, riding much more efficiently than me.\n\nThen a third rider on a loaded scooter appears at the pumps and we say hello. This is James4 and he does his documentation and wearily takes a seat in the shade of the store.\n\nHe’s tired like the rest of us, a little more, maybe.\n\nWe strike up a conversation and I ask what drew him to the Cannonball. He tells us he’s doing it for the adventure and has wanted to do it for years.\n\n“I saved up for a long time,” he says after a moment. “I don’t really make much. I’m sort of a janitor at a hospital and I clean up the bloody messes after surgeries and such.\n\n“I was even selling my plasma to get extra money.”\n\nI tell him I admire his dedication and ask if I can take his photo. “I’ll email it to you,” I say.\n\nHe laughs through his fatigue and says he’ll show the photo as proof to some people “who didn’t believe I’d be doing this. They thought I’d sell my vacation time and wouldn’t go.”\n\nWe wish each another good luck and Virginia and I leave. We have a long way to go.\n\nBut I’ll remember James in the miles ahead, marveling at (and envying) his perseverance. The Cannonball is a difficult, expensive, exhausting undertaking, especially for us rookies. I think he’s worked harder than most of us to get here.\n\nI think of that as the sun bakes us and the taste of cold Gatorade vanishes, and we bounce and rumble down the empty, arid road.\n\n* * *\n\n1 – There are three mandatory checkpoints that riders must document or else lose all points for the day.\n\n2 – Charles, on a 2021 Honda PCX 150, finished 101st overall. 173 riders were at the start; some dropped out along the way for various reasons, including mechanical difficulty.\n\n3 – Steve, on a 2007 Honda Helix, finished 135th overall.\n\n4 – Not his real name and in time you will understand why.\n\nPart 2: Why I Am Haunted by a Fellow Cannonball Rider\n\nNote from the mission historian: The 2023 Scooter Cannonball was an eight-day, 3,170 mile checkpointed ride across the U.S. from San Clemente, California, to Hilton Head, South Carolina. It started June 18th and ended June 25th. Cannonball events are held every two years and are limited to scooters of 278ccs or less.\n\nI piloted “HMS Terror,” #61, a 2016 Vespa 300cc GTS Super Sport (rounded up from its actual 278 by Piaggio marketing). She has about 22 hp and I named her after one of the two ships of the 1839 James Clark Ross Antarctic expedition.\n\nI rode very slowly and carefully and finished almost dead last.\n\n***\n\nDay 04 | Wednesday, June 21: Virginia Cherry and I split up on the unpaved trail leading to Checkpoint 1 this day, mostly because she’s a superbly skilled rider on any road and I’m like skidding across ice with bald tires.\n\nShe makes Checkpoint 1 (an abandoned building in Octate, New Mexico) and is urged by a Cannonball support driver to go head without waiting for me, which she does, and later feels bad about.\n\nBy the time I get there, she is far ahead of me, which is fine because I go at my own (admittedly slower) pace and wonder about the country I’m passing through. Some of the small towns, once prosperous, are abandoned and desolate. I wonder what happened to them.\n\nAs expected, it’s another hot day. Checkpoint 2, an abandoned farmhouse on Yates Road, looks haunted1 with its windmill clattering slowly in the breeze.\n\nI stop for gas at Allsup’s Convenience Store in Clayton, New Mexico, and find fellow riders I know – Bill Redington, Stephen Terrien, and Paul Cronin. It’s really good to see them and we talk about what we’ve seen and laugh together.\n\nThen I hear another scooter arrive and it’s James, the rider from yesterday, catching up with us. He parks at one of the pumps, shuts down, and says hello while pulling off his helmet and jacket. He’s clearly knackered in the heat.\n\n“How are you doing?” I ask.\n\nHe shakes his head. “I’m okay. Hot.” He begins fueling up.\n\nI roll Terror from the gas pump to the last parking space in front of the store and go back to talk with the other riders. Paul leaves and Bill is saying something about bad weather when we hear a crash and clatter of metal.\n\nI turn and see James’s scooter and Terror on their sides on the ground, with James in-between. Someone from the store is already there, trying to help. I dash over.\n\nIt looks bad. James appears to be stuck and I can’t tell if he’s hurt. I yell for the others but they’re already on their way.\n\nWe lift the scooter off James and the store guy gets the sidestand down. Bill helps James stand up but he’s unsteady and wobbles like he’s going to fall. I grab hold and together we get him upright.\n\n“I’m okay, I’m okay,” he says, and staggers toward the store. “I just need something to drink.”\n\nStephen tries to get James to sit down but he keeps moving. “I think he’s dehydrated,” Stephen says.\n\nThat’s when the warning about dehydration from fellow rider Eric Semple2 comes soaring into my head. “You have to drink,” Eric had said a day or two earlier. “Dehydration sneaks up on you and you won’t know what hit you.”\n\nMeanwhile, the others have stood Terror upright. I check for damage but I don’t see anything other than a bent eyebolt in the rear luggage plate3. That’s where the scooter hit the Vespa, pushed it off its centerstand, and onto the pavement.\n\nJames recovers and says he is sorry about the Vespa. I tell him not to worry. Bill suggests we ride together to the next checkpoint and we agree.\n\n“Why don’t you take point and I’ll bring up the rear?” I suggest to Bill. That means James will have riders in front and behind him.\n\nThat’s how we ride to Checkpoint 3, the last of the day, a group of rusted out grain elevators in Felt, Oklahoma, about 23 miles away. We take our photos and certify our locations and set off again for Guymon, ready to end this day.\n\nBut the weather has other ideas.\n\nStorm clouds have been seriously building ahead of us and the wind starts picking up. Rain sprinkles a bit but the gusts are strong enough to batter us on the road. I’ve ridden in bad wind before but this is starting to get scary.\n\nBill pulls over and we all stop.\n\n“This is looking bad,” he says. “You can go ahead if you want, but I’m going to turn around and wait this out back there.”\n\nIt’s a sensible idea – I’m secretly relieved – so we follow him back to the rusted sheet metal silos of Checkpoint 3. If we need a support truck, they’ll know exactly where we are, which is about 60 miles from Guymon.\n\nWe park our scooters on the side of the road and wait for more than an hour, as Bill monitors the storm’s movements by smartphone with the help of his brother back East.\n\nAt times the wind is strong enough to rock the scooters, so much that we sit on or keep a hand on them to prevent a tip-over.\n\nFinally the storm clears and we proceed. It’s dark by the time we get to Guymon but we are too tired to care, I think. Everyone is all right: Bill, Stephen, James, myself, and a rider named Eddie who joined our group to wait.\n\nLater, we learn that some riders were pummeled by rain and hail.\n\nNext morning, Day 05, I take my spare Camelbak4, a new one with the tags still on it, and find James packing his scooter in the Hampton’s parking lot.\n\n“Here,” I say, “This is an extra. Why don’t you take it? It may make the ride easier.”\n\nHe looks at it, then at me. “No, thank you,” he says. “I’m dropping out.”\n\nI’m stunned. “Seriously?”\n\n“I’m tired and I’m packing it in,” he says. “I’m just getting rid of a bunch of stuff and going home.”\n\n“Wait a sec,” I say. “We’re halfway done.”\n\nIt’s true. We’ve covered about 1,500 miles with roughly 1,670 to go.\n\n“You’ve done a lot to get this far – not many people can say that. You can keep going,” I say.\n\n“No,” he says. “I’m going home.” Then he pauses and says, “This isn’t the first time. It’s happened before. There’ve been other instances.” And there’s a ship-lost-at-sea look of resignation in his eyes that breaks my heart.\n\nHe continues strapping bags to the scooter. And I try to find the words that will make him see otherwise and I fail, miserably. I know the Cannonball is not an easy ride; I’ve thought about quitting, myself. The heat and fatigue and effort are exhausting.\n\n“Take the Camelbak anyway,” I say. “For the ride home.”\n\nHe shakes his head, says, “no, thank you” and turns away with finality and I realize that there is nothing I can do without making him resent me for interfering. And I am so damned inadequate and sorry.\n\nVirginia will tell me that she also tried to talk to him and he rather snapped and said Look, I’m going home, okay?\n\nI see Stephen a bit later and relate what happened. “That’s unfortunate and I’m sorry to hear that,” he says. “But it’s his decision to make. It’s up to him.” And Stephen is right, of course.\n\nBut I can’t forget what Maimonides, a 12-century Torah scholar and philosopher, wrote. You see it phrased differently, but the essential sentiment is:\n\n“A single righteous act can tip the balance and make all the difference.”\n\nDay 04 was a long day but we’d dealt with it, the heat, scooters falling over, and dodging a storm.\n\nAnd now I learn again that sometimes, despite our best effort and intention, nothing can be done.\n\nEven so, I wish that we – James and me – had been able to tip the balance on that morning of Day 05.\n\n***\n\n1 – Which makes me compose a ghost story in my helmet about a motorcycle rider who pauses in front of a farmhouse to take a picture and talks with a little girl who invites him in for a cup of cold water. He politely declines and later learns that the house has sat empty for years.\n\n2 – That’s VespaChef #8, a superb rider, chef, outdoorsman and raconteur. A true Renaissance Man, one might say.\n\n3 – I wonder if the Vespa’s headset’s been knocked out of alignment and check that, too, but it looks okay. Moto Richmond later assures me it’s good.\n\n4 – Linda suggested I try one during the hellishly hot ride home from San Diego in 2007 and I’ve been using it on every long ride since. They really do help. Some riders use water bottles mounted on the bike instead of backpacks, but the result is the same.\n\nParking Lot Workshop, or: ‘Does That Look Like It’s Leaking/Bending/Going Flat to You?’\n\nCharley did the most incredible bodge job, using about 40 cable ties to strap two wrenches as splints across the split in the frame.\n\n– Ewan McGregor, “Long Way Round”\n\nSaturday, Oct. 22 | Day 18: It wasn’t perfect, but I did manage a classic bodge job1 on Terra Nova’s sidestand2 when it started bending under all the weight I stupidly put on the bike.\n\nAfter fueling up somewhere in Georgia on the way home, I suddenly stopped dead in my tracks and looked at the Yamaha — I mean, really looked at it — and I said to Linda, “Does that sidestand look like it’s bending?”\n\n“Yes, it does,” she said.\n\nIt was a true son-of-a-bitch moment. Ever since the sins of the 2020 ride, when I failed to monitor the engine oil in Linda’s Vespa, I’ve been a religious convert to fanatically checking both motorcycles every morning during our long-distance tours.\n\nThe fervor was part of this year’s pilgrimage, but it wasn’t enough. As you’ll see, I still haven’t learned the art of packing light. (We’ll talk about that elsewhere.) I knew the Yamaha was overloaded but I didn’t think the sidestand would be affected.\n\nWe left the gas station and got to the hotel, where I conducted an internal all-night debate in my mind, serious as the Nuremberg Trials, on whether I should leave the sidestand for later or try to improvise a brace now.\n\nIn the morning (shades of the St. Pete Beach Ace Hardware!) I found Santee Hardware3 about a half-mile away. They didn’t have any suitable angle iron but they did have 12-inch lengths of half-inch square solid steel rod I thought would work. The problem was, I needed a piece only 8 inches long.\n\n“Can you cut 4 inches off of this?” I asked one of the guys who worked there.\n\n“We don’t really do any cutting,” he said.\n\n“Here’s the problem,” I said. “I’m on a motorcycle, on my way home to Virginia, and I need this to be 8 inches long for a brace. Can you help me out?”\n\nHe took the piece to a back room, put it in a vise and used a Sawzall to cut it. He even smoothed down the rough edges on a grinding wheel.\n\nI bought the metal, a handful of hose clamps, and a 5/16 nut driver to tighten them down. “If this works, you won’t see me again,” I told the guy at the cash register and he laughed.\n\nI took it all out to Terra Nova in the parking lot next door and fashioned a brace to prevent the stand from further disfigurement. I rode back to the hotel feeling better.\n\nMaking repairs and checking oil and tires admittedly isn’t very exciting, but every motorcycle traveler/author scribbles something about maintenance. There’s something deeply self-satisfying about catching and fixing a mechanical problem that could have disrupted your ride.\n\nRobert Pirsig, for example, writes about tuning up the engine of his Honda Super Hawk in Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance and describes his satisfaction in doing it right.\n\nIt’s another essential aspect of two-wheel travel, one of many that sets motorcycles apart from cars.\n\nIn a car, you can find suitable parts and oil just about anywhere, but if you have a motorcycle, or (God help us) an exotic motorbike or scooter like a Vespa, you have to prepare, pre-service, and carry what you need with you, including special made-for-motorcycle oil.\n\nOtherwise, if you break down 300 miles from a Vespa dealer, you’re stuck4.\n\nAt home, I do motorcycle maintenance in the cozy confines of the phone-booth-size workshop at Starbase 8. While traveling on the road, other locales are pressed into service.\n\n*\n\n“For a temporary shop, your first consideration is to look around for the best available floor. It could be the pavement you’re parked on, the shoulder of the road, or a supermarket parking lot.”\n\n– C. G. Masi, How to Set Up Your Motorcycle Workshop\n\n*\n\nIn my case, that means commandeering parking lot spaces out in the good-weather open as I did in Santee, or (with the consent of bemused hotel clerks) driveways beneath grand entrance canopies.\n\nSo, using Terra Nova’s rear luggage plate as my workbench, I did my little daily reassuring rituals of checking oil levels and tire pressures and whatnot – everything except for the sidestand.\n\nBut the oil was easy. Terra Nova had been fully serviced5 before we left and her oil level never changed. The Vespa was a different story; the oil consumption varied based on the speed at which we’d traveled the day before. A faster pace guaranteed more oil usage.\n\nThat’s because Linda has a 2020 Vespa with a 300cc HPE, a high-performance engine that puts out about 24 hp6 and burns a lot of oil during its 6,000-mile break-in period. The consumption is a bit startling until you get used to it.\n\nMotorcycles and scooters require the aforementioned motorbike-specific oil so I carried about a pint for Terra Nova and a quart and a half for the Vespa. I brought along funnels, shop rags, and enough plastic storage bags to choke a Safeway7.\n\nI also took care to scrounge pieces of used cardboard for the inevitable oil drips of the dipstick and funnel, not wanting to leave oily stains on nice clean pavements and irritate the hotel folks who graciously let us park there.\n\nSo the oil was okay. The only surprise came after we got home and I started looking at replacement sidestands and discovering some of them had pre-formed bends. Even past photos of Terra Nova indicate, from certain angles, that some sort of bend was already there.\n\nI don’t know for sure yet, but I’m tempted to say the stand had a bend that was later made worse by the luggage weight.\n\nBut the inner glow of bodge-jobbing the sidestand — a sort of Pirsig Zen Buddhist calm satisfaction, I suppose — stayed with me for the ride home and after.\n\n*\n\n1 — Bodge job is British term that means temporary repair. A botched job, on the other hand, is a screwed-up affair.\n\n2 — Or a kickstand, as some philistines would call it.\n\n3 — In Santee, South Carolina, a great hardware store.\n\n4 — I suppose you could put car oil into your motorcycle just to get it to safety, if you had approximate viscosity and synthetic content and nothing else was available. Still, the thought of an engine tearing itself up from insufficient lubrication is enough to cause cardiac arrest in a rider. That’s why I willingly carry all that rather heavy oil.\n\n5 — And I have the bill from the Yamaha dealer to prove it. You’d think I was paying off the national debt of France or something.\n\n6 — Which makes it Vespa’s most powerful engine these days.\n\n7 — Maybe all that stuff conspired to help bend the sidestand.\n\nHardware Store Envy, or: Man, This Sure Ain’t the Home Depot\n\nTuesday, Oct. 11 | Day 7: I think only good friends Andrew Virzi, Tom McCray and Karl Gelles will truly understand this one, but if you’re feeling optimistic, do continue. I’ll keep it short since this is a rather quirky piece about hardware stores.\n\nInterjection from the mission logistician: Owning and modifying a motorcycle or Vespa means doing at least some work on your own. Accordingly, you end up fabricating some parts and even tools. Thus, hardware stores can sometimes be among your best friends.\n\nAfter four days of motorcycle travel, Linda and I got to St. Pete Beach late Saturday afternoon and took some time to relax and sort things out. Part of this required a stop at the South Pasadena Ace Hardware.\n\nWe’d been here before, but only briefly. Linda ended up looking for corks for her antique bottle collection and we ended up down one long aisle where I was amazed to see cabinet after cabinet of specialty screws, nuts and other items, many of which I’ve sought in the past without success, others I didn’t know existed.\n\nIt had everything, including (1) classy, knurled thumb screws that would have looked good on a set of Campagnolo downshift levers; (2) brass acorn nuts; (3) plastic caps for buttoning over the scratchy heads of screws.\n\nAnd it was so clean and thoughtfully organized, not the sad chaotic mess one usually finds in the well-picked-over aisles of Home Depot or Lowe’s.\n\nI bought a 24mm 12-point socket (I would have preferred a 6-point) for the oil drain fitting and some rubber plugs that may work to prop open the passenger peg extensions aboard Erebus and Terror, two Vespas that were parked a thousand miles away.\n\nSouth Pasadena Ace Hardware was so nice I wanted to move there, which is ridiculous, but it’s a testament to how important well-stocked hardware stores are. At least to me.\n\nMotul 4T 5W-40 full synthetic oil looks like red wine salad dressing, but most certainly does not taste like it\n\nWhile checking over Terror1, the 2016 Vespa I recently bought from a nearby Vespa dealer2 to use in the 2023 Scooter Cannonball, I discovered they’d drastically over-filled the engine oil.\n\nThe oil on the dipstick was way above the MAX mark – which is not good, of course, since too much oil means too much pressure inside the engine, causing leaks and other damage.\n\nI put about 8 miles on Terror just riding it home, which shouldn’t present a problem.\n\nThe dealer said they’d changed the engine oil and transmission oil before selling it. I asked about brake fluid, since it’s hygroscopic and absorbs water over time.\n\nYou really don’t want that. Water in brake fluid compromises braking and causes rust in steel brake lines and elsewhere in the system.\n\nThey said they didn’t know when it was last changed but said their mechanic “looked at” the brake fluid, presumably in the reservoir, and said it was okay.\n\nApologies, but that’s bullshit, too. You need to test the fluid with special test strips or an electronic meter – you can’t just “look” at it. Everything I’ve ever read says you should change the fluid every two years or so.\n\nThis 2016 Vespa is six years old.\n\nBut back to the engine oil. On Friday night, after sticking a clean plastic straw down the filler hole, I laboriously and patiently and carefully sucked out the excess oil like it was a toxic milkshake.\n\nMotul 4T 5W-40 full synthetic looks like red wine salad dressing but most certainly does not taste like it.\n\nI got the engine oil level down to where it should be. The excess went into a gallon jug that formerly held Arizona iced tea. It was about ¾ inch deep, which seems a frightful amount.\n\nOn Saturday, I rode the Vespa 153 miles south to Scoot Richmond3. They’ll change the brake fluid and engine coolant, to give me a baseline of maintenance. Linda and I will pick it up on Saturday, Aug. 6.\n\nAnd that was the latest Vespa adventure, with the apparent lesson being you have to check everything.\n\n_ _ _\n\n1 — Which is named after the second ship of the James Clark Ross expedition to the Antarctic in 1839. We’ve been over this before, right?\n\n2 — Who shall remain anonymous. The sales person was very nice, though.\n\n3 — Who has the only Vespa mechanics I can trust, apparently. It doubles my regret at not waiting and purchasing a similar vintage Vespa that popped up on their site after I bought Terror.\n\nThe Scooter Name Kinda Fits, Since I’ll Feel Some Terror, or At Least Trepidation, Before & During the Scooter Cannonball\n\n“We’re committed – or we ought to be.”\n\nFormer faux motto of the Daily Kent Stater, the student newspaper at Kent State University\n\nSometimes it’s hard to justify an act of commerce, even with motorcycles, but I bought a used 2016 Vespa 300cc Super Sport to pilot in the Scooter Cannonball.\n\nThe idea of doing the 2023 Cannonball – an 8-day coast-to-coast rally limited to scooters of 300ccs or less – started germinating like Japanese knotweed in the back of my mind after I wrote about it for USA Today last year.\n\nIt’s one of my favorite stories and I think that’s because I had a great time talking to the riders I interviewed. Fascinating people, every one.\n\nSo now I have two Vespas.\n\nThere’s an indescribable feeling you get when crossing the dividing line between spectator and participant. I felt it most keenly in my first Marine Corps Marathon, taking my place among the other runners and thinking to myself I’m really doing this at last.\n\nLikewise, writing about the Cannonball made me think could I do this?\n\nThe marathon had its roots in my high school cross-country days, back in the Pleistocene era1. The Cannonball dream is more recent, of course, and I’m learning more about its logistical demands, which are roughly akin to those of the Normandy invasion.\n\nThe planning elements comprise a long list2, but choice of scooter – what am I going to ride? – is probably paramount.\n\nScooters get punished during the Cannonball. Small engines aren’t intended for sustained high-speed travel over 8 to 10 days and riders often do maintenance chores in hotel parking lots when they’d much rather be sleeping in their rooms 10 feet away.\n\nI could take Erebus, my 2020 Vespa Sei Giorni, but it’s sort of a special-edition model and I started having visions of being dopey-tired and dropping it at gas stations and such. I really didn’t want to bash her up3.\n\nThat made me think about getting a second scooter, one, er, nice but not as nice as Erebus but still sturdy enough to get me across the country. Linda and I looked at Japanese scooters4 but then I saw the 2016 on La Moto Washington’s website.\n\nIt’s a 2016 Vespa Super Sport, a 300cc scooter with ABS, much like Erebus but less sporty-appearing. The engine isn’t an HPE like Erebus and Linda’s GTS but it’s still powerful, relatively speaking5, and has longer maintenance intervals. It had 872 miles on the odometer.\n\nLong story short, I rode it home eight miles in the rain today.\n\nI had to give her a name and, continuing my preference for naming my motorcycles after Antarctic exploration ships6, chose the moniker Terror, after the second ship of the James Clark Ross expedition of 1839-1843. Erebus was the first7.\n\nTerror is in my workshop now at Starbase 8 with 880 miles on the clock. I’ll start learning how to work on it, how to change engine oil and filters and how to replace transmission belts and variator and clutch rollers. It will be a steep learning curve for me.\n\nI’ll baby Terror and take care of her, but I’ll be secure knowing that I can take a tumble and – while aghast at the damage I’m causing8 – think: At least I’m not fucking up Erebus.\n\n_ _ _\n\n1 – Admittedly, I wasn’t a very good runner, then or now. I’ve had bystanders tell me to just get a cab.\n\n2 – That’s not an exaggeration. You have to decide if/how to ship your scooter to the starting line, reserve rooms at hotels/motels along the way, arrange for space on support vehicles and figure out how you’re going to get your scooter home when the rally is over.\n\n3 – Any motorcycle or scooter can get damaged while traveling but the Cannonball carries a higher risk because of long days, insufficient sleep, enforced timelines and intense navigation. I just didn’t want to risk Erebus like that.\n\n4 – A Honda ADV 150 or Yamaha SMAX were on the list. They have smaller engines and less power than Terror but are considered extremely reliable.\n\n5 – Terror has 22 hp; Erebus has 24.\n\n6 – It’s true; I have three motorcycles and two Vespas of my own (not counting Linda’s Vespa and Yamaha Vino) and all but one has an Antarctic-related name.\n\nThe outlier is Santiago, the 1965 Honda CL-77 awaiting restoration in a shed out back. It’s named after one of the five ships Magellan took on his circumnavigation voyage in 1519.\n\n7 – Both were constructed as “bomb ships,” built with extremely strong hulls to withstand the impacts of naval explosions. Sadly, they were lost during the 1845 Franklin expedition to find the Northwest Passage in the Arctic. Erebus was found in 2014; Terror was discovered in 2016.\n\n8 – And will fix, since it’s a really nice scooter.\n\nSort of a Dry Run, or: How I Accidentally Fixed A Vespa the Same Day I Registered for the 2023 Scooter Cannonball\n\n“There are no small parts, only small actors.”\n\n– Konstantin Stanislavski\n\nI signed up for the 2023 Scooter Cannonball1 – a scooter-only, 8-day event covering 3,170 miles – on June 25, the day registration opened, and the same day I tried to fire up Linda’s Vespa 300 GTS and found it wouldn’t start.\n\nIt was irony of the highest sort, since the Cannonball is a long-distance event in which participants ride scooters of 300ccs (or less) across the country. Scooters aren’t really meant for that type of distance and riders typically do scooter maintenance in hotel parking lots at night.\n\nSo the work of getting her Vespa back online became a learning experience, a dry run of sorts for the Cannonball, since breakdowns are common during the event. Riders are expected to at least attempt to make their own repairs, though fellow competitors often offer help2.\n\nThe Vespa hadn’t been run in a while. I pulled the Dow cover, rolled it from underneath the patio overhang and turned the key.\n\nThe system initialized: the dash lights came on, the fuel pump pumped, but when I hit the starter button, I was rewarded with only a single click from somewhere in the engine.\n\nOne tries to be rational and methodical in times like these but I couldn’t help but think: “What if this were happening at a hotel in Guymon, Oklahoma, in the morning?3 What would I do?”\n\nI charged up the battery, tried the starter again without success, and found the battery level had fallen again. From experience with Endurance’s battery, I figured that was the problem.\n\nWe dashed to La Moto Washington before they closed and got a new battery, which didn’t solve the problem. So I was feeling rather clueless.\n\nI started searching online for solutions and to watch Robot’s instructional videos on scooterwest.com5. I traced the clicking to the starter relay under the saddle and checked it by swapping out the relay from Erebus, which has the same engine as Linda’s Vespa.\n\nErebus fired up, but the other Vespa didn’t. So it wasn’t the starter relay.\n\nI started poking about the engine, looking to check the spark plug and spied a rubber sparkplug-like boot and pried it off, only to see a stud, a nut and the business end of a broken ring terminal, a dime-sized fitting used here to connect a wire to the engine block. Could this be it?\n\nI modified a ring terminal from a box of spare parts, fitted it on the engine, and tried the starter button. The Vespa cranked over and started.\n\nI don’t know what I felt more: relief or amazement at discovering the problem. I have to permanently mount a ring terminal to the engine wire, but that shouldn’t be much of a problem. And now we even have a spare battery.\n\n____\n\n1 – I wrote about the Cannonball in 2021 for USA Today online4. It’s one of my favorite stories; I enjoyed talking with nearly a dozen riders, a good group of folks. After some internal deliberation, I decided to sign up myself, though I have a long way to go before I’m actually ready.\n\n2 – It’s part of the camaraderie of the event. Seriously, it’s a wonderful thing to see.\n\n3 – Guymon is one of the overnight stops on the 2023 route. It’s in the Panhandle.\n\n4 – The story was well-received by scooter riders, but readers really liked Veronica Bravo’s illustrations, which are really good.\n\n5 – Robot has no doubt helped thousands of Vespa riders take care of their scooters.\n\nWe All Have Front-Row Seats in the Short Attention Span Theater\n\nWednesday, Oct. 6 | Day 1: We make our second gas stop of the day south of Farmville, Virginia, at a quiet, rather forlorn Exxon station1 on U.S. 15. I’m thinking Farmville – sounds like it’s within hollerin’ distance of Mayberry in “The Andy Griffith Show” as we shut down.\n\nWe’ve come a scant 160 miles so far, keeping to old U.S. highways and county roads as the mission navigator2 planned. The pace is slower and the views are more rewarding. Farmville itself is interesting, as is Longwood University. We’ve hit rain but the bikes are running fine.\n\nI pay for gas at the pump and move Terra Nova and Linda’s Vespa in front of a blocked-off garage. Inside the store, I fetch the obligatory bottles of Mountain Dew (original) and Diet Dr Pepper for the flight crew3.\n\nComing out, I glance through the garage doors, noting how both bays are empty of tools and relegated to storage. And that’s when I notice the pink sign, taped to the inside of the glass.\n\nRapid REVIVE! Training it says, and asks if its readers are interested in learning how to save lives. It lists free 10-minute training courses in the area, including one at Granny B’s Market on Abilene Road in Farmville.\n\nThe courses are sponsored by the Virginia Department of Health and the Virginia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services, according to the pink paper.\n\nI just sorta stand there and read it, marveling at:\n\n(1) Its rather cheery presentation, looking like a flyer promoting a garage sale (FREE Walk Up – 10 minute – REVIVE! Training) and its matter-of-fact tone (Are you a friend or family member of someone who uses opioids?)\n\nNot to mention use of the exclamation mark (!) and the REVIVE! program’s unfortunate harmonic proximity to the dopey “Revive with Vivaran” commercials, which advocated consumption of caffeine pills.\n\n(2) My own inexcusable ignorance of the depth of the opioid crisis. I’m aware of the public health emergency declared in 2017 by the Department of Health and Human Services, and the number of deaths, and the lawsuits filed, and the Sackler family getting immunity from lawsuits.\n\nBut I didn’t know how far we’ve fallen down the rabbit hole, that it was this bad, to the point where ordinary people are publicly encouraged to get schooled in recognizing opioid overdoses in friends and family members and administering naloxone. And that they’re learning this with quick classes in places like Granny B’s Market4.\n\nI can’t even begin to imagine what life is like for folks who have to know this, who are aware someone they love could die by overdose.\n\nThey take classes and keep Narcan close by and carry on. They may not have a choice, but they have a strength I will never know.\n\nAnd then there are those unsung heroes on the front lines, preparing and teaching those classes, and distributing thousands of flyers in county after county.\n\nWeeks later, after we return home, I take a basic online class from the Virginia health department and receive a 4 mg dose of Narcan and a pencil-case-sized pouch of overdose emergency supplies. I’ve started carrying them when we’re out and about. God knows if/when I’ll ever need to use them, but they’re there.\n\nThe thing is, it seems most of the nation has moved on from opioids and is now dealing with the pandemic, and Jan. 6, and the upcoming mid-term elections, and shouting matches over vaccinations, and everything else. We’re just not paying attention anymore. Maybe we’re just not capable.\n\nOur short attention span lets us overlook the pink REVIVE! notices, even those fortified with bold type, capital letters and exclamatory punctuation.\n\nBut on the roads ahead, in dusty windows across rural America5, the flyers are still out there. And so are friends and family members and opioids.\n\n–––\n\n1 – I shouldn’t be so judgmental. We were on Farmville Road, in a rural area, and the two garages hinted at ghosts of busy mechanics keeping cars on the road. And look at the triangular awning over the front of the station, on the left – jaunty and daring enough to suggest its designer was a fan of Frank Lloyd Wright.\n\n2 – That would be Linda, of course.\n\n3 – That would be us. Mountain Dew seems to fuel most of my rides these days, I’m afraid.\n\n4 – Where the fried chicken gets rave reviews from Yelp commentators.\n\n5 – And in Washington, D.C. (and no doubt elsewhere) as this article from the Washington Post shows – 10 overdoses with three fatalities in a single day.\n\nNot Necessarily Haunted, but: Ghost Buildings Along the Road That Would be Perfect in a Ray Bradbury or John Steinbeck Story\n\nFriday, Oct. 8 | Day 3: We took leisurely passage to St. Pete this time, mostly on old U.S. highways or county roads, making it a slower, tramp-steamer-type of motorcycle ride instead of a supersonic rush down the interstate.\n\nIt was better for Linda’s Vespa and my Yamaha1. The reward was scenic views, small towns, and a number of abandoned buildings – old gas stations, motels, diners, and other places ­– that were fascinating and depressing, in a scary story or science fictiony way.\n\nThe ghost town/ghost story comparison is inevitable, I suppose, though none of these really felt haunted. They were much more understated, like the John Steinbeck story, “The Cottage That Wasn’t There,” written and serialized in the New York Herald Tribune in 1943, during World War II2.\n\nBut walking into some of these places (taking nothing but photos) and seeing the rain damage, damp floors and mold also reminded me of Ray Bradbury’s 1950 short story, “The Long Rain,” in which four men crash-land on Venus, a planet of eternal rain, and try to get to safety3.\n\nWe’re talking about buildings that used to be popular, once upon a time; you could envision them as set players in Jack Kerouac’s On the Road or part of the background in American Graffiti.\n\nStopping at these places wasn’t part of the mission profile, but that changed as I realized how many were there and how interesting they were.\n\nI confess to breaking (to Linda’s exasperation) our ride protocol4 by simply pulling over and pulling out a camera whenever I saw something of note.\n\nSome reminded me of ghost towns we visited when living in Nevada:\n\nBodie, California, kept in arrested decay5 by California State Parks;\n\nRhyolite, Nevada, an abandoned town about 35 miles from Death Valley.\n\nI don’t know why such places attract me. Part of it is history, I reckon; I wonder about the people who worked and visited there, and what led to the abandonment. And whether the businesses and livelihoods could have been saved.\n\nTake the derelict Horne’s restaurant/souvenir shop in Lawtey, Florida, for example. It appears as though the owners simply walked away from it, leaving counters and shelves stuffed with items, very much as the things left behind in Bodie long ago.\n\nThe Interstate truck stop in Ulmer, South Carolina, must have been a thriving business until the construction of I-95 killed it.\n\nAnd Ray’s Place in Sylvania, Georgia, looked like it was a nice place, way back when.\n\nThere were no spooky incidents to report, only silent rooms and broken windows and dripping rain.\n\nI do wonder what we’d have done if we’d filled up at a strange little gas station and later met someone down the road (probably an ancient, wizened gentleman with hair longer and whiter than mine) who’d say:\n\n“Oh, no, you couldn’t possibly have bought anything there. That place closed down years ago.”\n\n1 – Sometimes I regret not taking my Vespa Sei Giorni instead of the Yamaha Super Tenere, though carrying all our stuff was easier. I’ll attempt to pack lighter for the GTV next time, definitely.\n\n2 – A story that grabs the reader unexpectedly; during WWII, a British sergeant tells Steinbeck of walking at night in England from one outpost to another and seeing a house with its lights on and a little old lady inside.\n\nHe’s charmed by the scene and reaches his destination without incident but starts thinking of how the house should have blackout curtains since it’s wartime. It slowly dawns on him that the cottage isn’t actually there – it had been bombed by the Germans months earlier with only its walls left standing.\n\nThe story is in Steinbeck’s book, “Once There Was a War,” published in 1958.\n\n3 – They’re trying to reach something called a Sun Dome, a structure with an artificial sun. The first one they find has been attacked and destroyed by indigenous Venusians, who punch holes in the roof to let in the never-ending rain. We saw a lot of rain damage ourselves.\n\nThe story was part of the collection in “The Illustrated Man,” published in 1951 and “R is for Rocket,” in 1962.\n\n4 – That’s the duty of stopping with notice to your riding partner. Linda sometimes didn’t realize what I was doing until I dropped out of her mirrors and she was forced to turn around to look for me.\n\n5 – Arrested decay is a practice of preserving, not repairing, buildings by preventing them from falling apart with outside braces or other means.\n\n‘We Seem to Have Reached the Age Where Life Stops Giving Us Things and Starts Taking Them Away’\n\n“Brutal couple of years, huh, Charlie? First Dad, then Marcus.”\n\n– Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones1\n\nSaturday, Oct. 16 | Day 11: We bought the flowers, as usual, at the Publix supermarket in Dade City, though this time we carried them aboard Terra Nova to the cemetery down the street.\n\nFlight-wise, our ride to St. Pete Beach, Florida, was much better this year than last. No U-Hauls were needed. We had no mechanical problems, other than a nail in a tire on the return route. More on that later.\n\nOn the road, there was plenty of time for reluctant reflection (inside my helmet) on 2021 as a year of loss, of both people and places.\n\nMy father died of COVID on Jan. 23 and my beloved Aunt Jo of the same on June 12.\n\nAnd then there was Cyril Kúdela, the Eastern European cousin of my father and Aunt Jo, who died April 29 in Piestany, Slovakia2. Incredibly, he and Aunt Jo wrote each other throughout the Cold War, letters that kept the Petras family connected over decades.\n\nAnd wise and kind-hearted Bob Russ, a colleague and old friend from my days at the Sandusky Register, died Jan. 23, the same day as my father. He was only 63.\n\nOn Linda’s side, Rich Stapin, the husband of her cousin Pat, died Oct. 5.\n\nOur family house in Bedford Heights, Ohio, which my parents bought in 1959, was sold Oct. 12; I’ll never again step foot inside my childhood home.\n\nThe sale was finalized and proceeds transferred while we were in Florida.\n\nWe parked the bikes in Floral Memory Gardens, trimmed the grass around the headstone, and put flowers in the vase, as we did the year before, and for nearly a dozen years before that.\n\nAnd, after visiting the cemetery, we found the lot on Bahia Drive in Zephyrhills, Florida, where my grandparents moved in 1963, has a new mobile home on it, owned by strangers.\n\nThe lot stood empty after the original house was condemned and torn down a few years ago.\n\nLinda and I had discussed buying the house at one point, but it wasn’t feasible. The owner abandoned it after taking out too many loans he was unable to repay and everything was locked up in legal disputes that continued until the demolition. Another childhood place gone.\n\nWe ended the Zephyrhills house-and-memorial-park duty by stopping for ice cream at Dave’s Treats3, the old Twistee Treat4 on Route 54, not far from my grandparents’ former place.\n\nTime keeps moving but I still don’t know how to deal with loss. I think the only thing left to us is to remember and respect who and what we’ve lost, and to remind those still here that we love them.\n\nAnd to be aware of what time we ourselves have left, keep moving forward, and live as fully as we can, with few regrets as possible.\n\nI was thinking of all this (inside my helmet) and I got a text the very next day, Oct. 17, from my cousin Joey that my wonderful cousin Marlene had died.\n\nMarlene was truly a special person and I always enjoyed her wisdom, her outlook on life, and her company.\n\nI last saw her in Cleveland on July 13 and was aware of her medical problems but I did not know how bad they were. Life is ruthlessly taking things away.\n\n1 – The title of this report is from “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” (2008). I don’t remember much about the movie but I’ll never forget that line, spoken by actor Jim Broadbent. It rings so true.\n\n2 – The two sections of the family probably would not have known of the other’s existence had it not been for those letters. And Linda and I (and Aunt Jo) wouldn’t have traveled to Slovakia in 2006, our first of three visits.\n\nIt was so good to see Jo and Cyril meet in person at last. We were on the side of the angels that day.\n\nI’ve written about Cyril a few times; I admired him and though we visited him and his family three times, I will always regret not being able to know him better.\n\n3 – The cone-shaped building is irresistible. And the ice cream there is always good.\n\n4 – The buildings are 25 feet tall, according to the company website. They’ve been around since 1983, apparently.\n\nAnd finally: In the top photo (from a wall in my workshop here at Starbase 8) that’s Dad and my brother Rob with Endurance at the American Motorcycle Association Hall of Fame Museum in Pickerington, Ohio. We’d gone there in the early 2000s to look at Indian motorcycles. On the left is Van Dale Yasek, the father of my best friend Van. Cyril, of course, is there, too.\n\nThe Music That Haunted Me in Warrenton\n\nSaturday, Aug. 21 | “I love the songs you play here and on the street, they’re really good,” a woman tells an employee inside This n’ That Amish Outlet in Old Town Warrenton, Virginia, and I restrain myself from yelling, “Yes! I think so, too!” across the store.\n\nI’d unconsciously started noticing the music stream myself – golden oldies, they’d be called these days1 – after we’d wedged the Vespas into a parking space on Main Street.\n\nWe were in Warrenton as part of a short, simple 90-mile ride to get us out of the house and back on the saddle, preparatory for the St. Petersburg mission later this year.\n\nThe realization crept up in a subtle way with me thinking, gee, that’s an oldie and then haven’t heard that one in a while and suddenly, wait, what’s going on?\n\nIt started with “Dust in the Wind” by Kansas playing on an outdoor speaker as we crossed the street.\n\nIt continued with “More Than a Feeling,” by Boston, followed by others as we had lunch at Ellie’s Place, an ice cream shop with super-nice folks.\n\nOne song after another, post-Elvis Presley and pre-disco: “Can’t Find My Way Home,” by Blind Faith in The Open Book book store down the street, then “Please Come to Boston” by Dave Loggins and “No Matter What” by Badfinger.\n\nI feel silly asking, but a very polite staffer at The Open Book tells me their music comes from Spotify, brought in by computer and played on Bluetooth speakers. She doesn’t know what other stores on the street use but says the choice is theirs.\n\n“We use indie-folk because it’s calming and doesn’t distract from people reading,” she says.\n\nYou hear music in every commercial venue, often to the point of saturation. So you ignore it, even as you’re being manipulated. Retailers often use music to make customers more susceptible to buying things, psychologists say2.\n\nPart of that is music’s ability to shift you in time, to trigger memories you’ve stuffed away. I wouldn’t have been surprised to catch Blind Faith in the bookstore, but it was like the entire town was playing the same Spotify list, making me think it was 1971.\n\nThe ride itself was good. Erebus seemed more comfortable, or maybe I’m getting used to being uncomfortable.\n\nI ended up buying the new biography of Malcolm X at The Open Book. I intended to get it at some point3, but it’s always good to patronize independent bookstores whenever possible, even if insidious, scheming, diabolical music-wielding market researchers will claim the purchase as a victory4.\n\n1 – No Rolling Stones or Beatles, though.\n\n2 – Loud music causes shoppers to leave quickly; soft music entices them to stay. And some studies say music in a minor key is associated with sadness, which shoppers address by buying something to release reassuring dopamine.\n\n3 – I’ve read the 1964 autobiography, written with Alex Haley, but I want to compare this highly regarded new book with the bios written by Bruce Perry in 1991 and by Manning Marable in 2011.\n\n4 – They can also crow about an iTunes sale, since I put “Please Come to Boston” and “No Matter What” on my iPod to be used later in this year’s St. Petersburg soundtrack – the songs I play for Linda in the morning every day of the ride. Look, don’t tell her about them, okay?\n\nRecon in Shepherdstown: Bikes, books and that Sign in the Restroom\n\nSaturday, Aug. 14 | “I saw your bikes, they look great,” says a guy on the street as we leave Betty’s Restaurant in Shepherdstown, West Virginia, the one with the memorable sign inside.\n\nOur sidewalk fan mentions the fluorescent green motorcycle jackets we have on and Linda says they’re hot in this kind of weather until we’re actually moving. The guy nods and says, “take care, ride safe.”\n\nThat’s amazing, I think to myself as we part, since Erebus and Linda’s red Vespa are parked on a side street way up the hill past Shepherd University’s main building.\n\nWhat a coincidence: He saw the Vespas, came down the hill, and unexpectedly encountered us.\n\nBut circumstances become clear a few steps later down East German Street: A pair of serious BMW 1200 GS motorcycles1, like the one I lusted after in Nashville, are parked in front of the Badgerhound Studio and Gallery.\n\nThey look like they’re built for the Dakar rally and they are beautiful.\n\nAh, so that’s it, he thought the BMWs were ours, I think, and wonder what his reaction would have been if he’d seen the Vespas. Perhaps not as enthusiastic, but still.\n\nThe Shepherdstown reconnaissance was part of a short 135-mile ride charted by the mission navigator2 – who overcame my initial reluctance since I was just too tired – that kept us off interstates and on country roads.\n\nWe go through a few small towns that are interesting, though Shepherdstown unanimously wins the day.\n\nIt’s a college town, obviously, with an artistic, cosmopolitan air that invites one to linger. Even humble sidewalk benches are an integral part of it, transformed into works of art with paint and imagination.\n\nWe find a really great independent bookstore called Four Seasons Books, one of those rare places of discovery where you walk in and fascinating tomes and titles call out to you from shelves. Books you didn’t know existed. I could have spent a lot and lugged home a double-armful.\n\nWe hadn’t been on the scooters for months, owing to work and other matters. I had only 814 miles on Erebus and I’m still not acclimated to riding it after years on motorcycles. The GTV still feels too small and the saddle is uncomfortable.\n\nI know I have to do a lot of work before riding it down to St. Petersburg as we’ve planned and using it in the 2023 Scooter Cannonball rally as I – perhaps insanely – want to do.\n\nBut Saturday’s ride gets us out and about and it feels good once I get used to being in the saddle again. After a while, the seat doesn’t feel so bad. We ride through some scenic places, including Lock 29 of the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal national park, near the Potomac River.\n\nWe end the day with dinner at the Italian Café in Falls Church, our favorite place (where the photo at the very top of this account was taken).\n\nFriend and owner Younes Jafarloo3, is a former sportbike rider and tells us how uncomfortable his Kawasaki Ninja could be after a while on the road. Ninjas have an aggressive riding posture.\n\n“My arms would hurt after a while,” he recalls.\n\nOver dinner4, Linda and I relax and talk about what we’ve seen and where we’ll go next. Outside, the sun starts to set and street lamps light up.\n\nThrough the window5 I notice a couple, about our age, intently studying the Vespas and talking about them. The guy seems especially interested; he circles both and gesticulates at Linda’s GTS.\n\nI’m mildly curious about what he has to say and if he’s been on scooters himself, but I stay where I am and don’t break the moment. At least he doesn’t think we’re on BMWs.\n\n1 – Like Endurance, my 2000 R1150 GS, only 20 years later.\n\n2 – That would be Linda, of course.\n\n3 – Younes is a great guy who sold his Ninja years ago; I confess to pestering him (gently, I hope) about getting another bike or scooter. He sat on Erebus once but graciously declined my offer that evening that he take it around the block or across his parking lot.\n\n4 – Which did not include wine, since the Vespas were parked outside and we never, ever, drink and ride. It’s an ironclad rule of our riding protocol.\n\n5 – Because we always maintain a clear line of sight to the bikes whenever we’re in a restaurant or some other place.\n\nThe View at 1,021 Kilometers, or: How the Sei Giorni Feels So Far\n\nLet’s get right to the point: Erebus has been delivered to Richmond for her 600-mile service1 and I’ve spent some time and effort on upgrades for comfort, utility and visual appeal.\n\nI’m still getting accustomed to the small size2 of it – it’s a 2020 Vespa 300 GTV Sei Giorni – but the flat seat, the one obtained with the swap from Linda’s GTS, allows me to sit farther back.\n\nI’ve also started using the passenger footpegs, which make it more comfortable and gives it more of a motorcycle feel3. And I attached an inflatable AirHawk cushion, which is working so far.\n\nI feel a bit less intimidated on the freeway now, even with clueless Virginia drivers passing like they’re in practice for their own private Le Mans. It’s getting better, though. And it does feel good on meandering county roads, with a slower pace and less traffic.\n\nOne problem is a lack of storage space. There’s a small glovebox-like compartment in the front shield that could conceivably carry a pair of gloves, and a small tub4 below the saddle that can fit a half-helmet, a rain jacket and a real pair of gloves on a good day.\n\nBut the Sei Giorni (as we discussed earlier) is patterned after a racing bike, laughable when you think about its 24-hp engine, but still. I want to store tools and rainsuits and spare parts and such without turning it into the truck from the Beverly Hillbillies.\n\nA few other additions:\n\nA windscreen from Scooter West/Vespa Motorsport, along with handlebar-end weights, an extended footpad for the sidestand, a rubber floormat and a small luggage rack for the floorboard. (That’s where the main toolkit will reside.)\n\nFrom Scoot Richmond: A luggage carrier behind the saddle and a set of crash bars.\n\nI attached two plastic canisters that each hold a 30-oz. MSR fuel bottle. The canisters5 look like a pair of small torpedoes or maybe warp nacelles from a Starfleet vessel.\n\nInstallation of all this was just basic tinkering, though it took me a while to figure out how to position the fuel carriers on the underside of the luggage plate. I also had to fabricate a way to attach them.\n\nBut at least now I can carry a half-gallon of gas in reserve.\n\nI dithered over the floorboard rack but decided I liked it. It’s low-profile enough to carry the toolkit without looking junky. It’ll be a pain to remove when it comes time to fuss with the battery, though.\n\nThe acclimation process continues. And have you heard about this Scooter Cannonball Run? It’s this coast-to-coast endurance rally, see, and I was thinking…\n\n1 – Though the odometer shows 1,021.7, which makes it plain that the dial is recording distance traveled in kilometers instead of miles. 1,021.7 kilometers equal 634.9 miles, if you want to know.\n\n2 – Relatively speaking, in reference to the BMW and the Yamaha.\n\n3 – Aside from the saddle problems, foot placement can be a bit maddening at times. There’s some space on the floorboards to move your feet around, but I found myself wanting more. I tried folding out the passenger pegs and using them and it works, sorta.\n\n4 – The tubs are called pet carriers because you absolutely can’t carry pets in them.\n\n5 – They’re actually tractor manual carriers from Agri Supply. I read about them somewhere quite a while ago; the MSR bottles fit perfectly. I have a set on Endurance and Terra Nova.\n\nIt looks good and rides perfect, but that saddle will have to go. My ass is killing me.\n\n“New beginnings are often disguised as painful endings.”\n\n— Lao Tzu\n\nThe Vespa debacle ended Saturday1 when we went to Scoot Richmond — where we probably should have gone in the first place — and bought a new 2020 Vespa Sei Giorni GTV.\n\nIt was a drama-free, no-regrets event that let me think about the scooter itself during the meandering ride home.\n\nI was gauging how it felt, the way it handled, and whether I’d be scared silly while sharing the freeway with demented, uncaring, inconsiderate northern Virginia motorists who are better at texting than driving.\n\nWe rolled out of Scoot Richmond’s lot with 7 miles on the clock and hadn’t gone 30 miles when I realized the saddle just wasn’t working. Sliding back on the seat gave my legs and arms more room, but the saddle is contoured and I ended up on the seat’s edge, which felt like sitting on the short side of a 2×4.\n\nI’ve got to get a new saddle, I remember thinking.\n\nBut that was the only thing, aside from vibration at stoplights, which is expected since we’re talking about a single-cylinder engine. The Vespa has nice acceleration and was good on the sweeping county roads like U.S. 255 and stable when I got on the freeway. The ABS-equipped brakes felt reliable.\n\nAnd I didn’t feel ridiculous on it as I thought. How I look may be another matter.\n\nI swapped seats — my first modification! — between the Sei Giorni and Linda’s GTS2 the next day, which will make both of us more comfortable, I think. There’s a list of other changes I’ll be making.\n\n“What’s the idea of a scooter if you already have a motorcycle?” a colleague at work asked, a righteous question, certainly; it’s still hard for me to articulate why I wanted a Vespa.\n\nThey’re much quirkier machines than either of my motorcycles but they still have a certain attraction for me.\n\nI still like both of my motorcycles3 and couldn’t give them up.\n\nThe Vespa is something radically different, forcing me to think differently in terms of riding and touring. It’ll be slower-paced, and we’ll have to take less than we usually do. I’m thinking that may be a good thing.\n\nContinuing my predilection for naming my bikes after Antarctic exploration ships, the Sei Giorni will be called Erebus4.\n\nNow we have to figure out where to go.\n\n***\n\n1 — I put a down payment on that poor Sei Giorni at the Honda dealer when it seemed they were making an honest effort to obtain a brown/red key. Sadly, the previous owner did not return their calls and they were flabbergasted by the quoted cost to replace the ECU and ignition switch. They dropped the price a bit more but Richmond offered a better deal on a new bike, with bonafide key and two-year warranty, so I withdrew from Honda and went to Richmond instead.\n\nI still feel bad about that keyless Sei Giorni, though. It deserves better.\n\n2 — The Sei Giorni is essentially the same as Linda’s GTS with the same engine and ABS. The seat swap was with her consent, of course.\n\n3 — Both Endurance and Terra Nova will be around for quite a while.\n\n4 — The HMS Erebus (and the HMS Terror) visited both the Antarctic, in 1841, and headed for the Arctic in 1845. Both were lost until they were rediscovered in 2014.\n\nOne Key, Two Key, Brown Key, Blue Key\n\n“If passion drives you, let reason hold the reins.”\n\n– Benjamin Franklin\n\nStill captivated by the idea of slower-paced motorcycle touring – a fixation I couldn’t dislodge with a bulldozer – I gave up on the Honda Super Cub 125 after a discouraging dealer encounter and started looking at other small motorbikes.\n\nThe focus drifted to Vespa, where I started paying attention to the Vespa Sei Giorni II, a 300cc scooter with the HPE engine, like Linda’s 2020 GTS.\n\nIt’s a beautiful machine, even more sexy than the green-and-yellow 300 Racing Sixties HPE I once admired at the dealership in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.\n\nThe Sei Giorni (which translates to “Six Days” and pronounced say JOR-nee) is based on the winning team of 125cc Vespa scooters in the 1951 Sei Giorni Internazionale enduro race in Varese, Italy.\n\nThat’s a brutal six-day endurance race. The team won nine gold medals, a stunning success.\n\nToday’s Sei Giorni is styled the same way as those winning scooters, but with updated electronics, fuel injection and ABS. The headlight is mounted on the front fender instead of the handlebars. It’s garnished with the racing number 6, front and rear.\n\nThe damn thing grew on me, gnawing at my subconscious, until finally I decided to look for one. The hunt, of course, is turning into an endurance event of its own.\n\nWe patronize Scoot Richmond in nearly all things Vespa, but they’re 110 miles from us, a bit too far for casual looking just now.\n\nSo on Saturday we went – just to look, you understand – to the closest dealer, La Moto Washington in Arlington, Virginia, whose website said they had one for sale.\n\n“Oh, we have one, but it isn’t here,” said the nice salesperson at La Moto. “We store it off-site since we can’t keep everything here.”\n\nShe says she’s there by herself since the other salesperson wasn’t able to make it in and mentions that it might not be a good idea to walk over to the other site because of the cold and ice but we could come back.\n\nWe say that’s fine, we’ll come back the next Saturday and thank her and take our leave.\n\nWalking back to the Jeep, Linda suggests we go to Richmond but it’s a little late in the day for a long drive and we veto the idea for today.\n\n“Hey,” I say, “why don’t we go back to the Honda dealer? Let’s see if that Super Cub is still there1.”\n\nSo we do, and we enter the place, and I walk back to check the row of used bikes and I see…\n\n…a 2020 Vespa Sei Giorni2 with 356 miles3 on the odometer. Exactly what I want.\n\nSeriously. It’s right there.\n\nThe coincidence is overwhelming – Twilight Zone scary, even! – and I’m marveling as I circle the Vespa. It looks good, really clean, a few minor scuff marks inside the front shield, but still, really, really good.\n\nThe sales guy, probably young enough to be my grandson, comes over and we talk for a bit and I ask, “so what’s the out-the-door price on this?”\n\nHe does a quick calculation in his head and names a figure roughly much more than I would pay. I look doubtful and he says, “I can run some numbers if you like.”\n\n“Well…okay,” I say, convinced nothing will come of this, but the Sei Giorni looks really good so we head over to his desk.\n\nHe’s on his computer for a moment and then fetches the sales manager, who turns out to be the same Mr. Killjoy4 from the Super Cub debacle literally 29 days ago.\n\nBut Mr. Killjoy is carrying a piece of paper, a printout – hey, the printer’s working! – and says they’ve done some price cutting and hands me the paper. It turns out they’ve had Sei Giorni for 90 days or more, taken as a trade-in. It must’ve been parked downstairs; I haven’t been down there in a while.\n\nThe price is a lot less than I expected, still a little high, but a good starting point. The mood is entirely different from last time, there’s no take-it-or-leave-it vibe and I’m actually starting to feel hopeful. We say we’ll think about it, thank them sincerely and leave.\n\nWe go home, pull the sales papers from Linda’s 2020 Vespa and find a few discrepancies in dealer prep and so on. We talk the idiocy of getting yet another bike but Linda senses my rising enthusiasm and understands me as usual so we decide to go back and make a counteroffer.\n\nMr. Killjoy comes back with a counter-counteroffer that’s a hundred bucks higher. I say okay and we get the paperwork started. I call our insurance company and get the Sei Giorni added to the policy.\n\nIt’s really happening at last and we wait and let the paperwork machinery whirr along.\n\nI start thinking about the Sei Giorni and what modifications I want to make (larger windscreen, additional brake light, maybe some auxiliary lights on the front) and which Antarctic exploration ship I’m going to name her after.\n\nThen the sales guy looks up and says, “We don’t have an owner’s manual. In trade-ins, we sometimes don’t get one.”\n\n“That’s okay,” I say. “That’s not a problem.”\n\nAnd it isn’t. I can go online and print one; I’ve already done it with Linda’s Vespa, two copies, one aboard the scooter itself, the other in the garage at Starbase Nashville.\n\n“And,” the sales guy says, “we don’t have a spare key.”\n\nIf this story had a soundtrack: Here is where the needle would skip across the record and make a horrible scratching sound and send the tone arm clattering off the stereo.\n\n“Wait,” I say. “You don’t have another key? You don’t have a brown key?”\n\n“Uh, no,” he says. And, as if someone’s tossed a bucket of sand into it, the deal machinery screeches to a halt.\n\nA brief but necessary technical digression…\n\nAll modern computerized Vespas are sold with two keys:\n\nA blue key, which is used as a standard ignition key, for day-to-day operation of the bike. It has a tiny transponder chip.\n\nA brown key5, which is the bike’s master key. This is the program key, used to work the bike’s onboard computer and program the bike to accept new keys and a whole lot of other stuff.\n\nWhen you buy a new Vespa, the salesperson will hand you this brown key and say, literally in bold capital letters:\n\n“DON’T LOSE THIS KEY.\n\nKEEP IT SOMEWHERE SAFE.”\n\nYou can get other blue keys as spare ignition keys. (I got two for Linda’s scooter.) However, you need the brown key to program them, to make them work.\n\nIt’s an aggravating quirk of the Vespa system. The computer controls an immobilizer system on the bike, which means you can’t start the engine without the properly coded keys. You need the damned keys.\n\nYou can’t get a new brown key without replacing the bike’s Electronic Control Unit and the ignition barrel (the thing in the dash with the slot you stick the key into). All that costs a lot of money, upwards of $800 or so with parts and labor.\n\nI am not making that up.\n\nYou can get new blue keys cloned but it’s a pain in the ass without the brown key and there’s no guarantee they’ll work.\n\n…and now back to our story\n\n“I’m sorry, but we need to have that brown key,” I say. “That’s a deal breaker.”\n\nThe sales guy goes looking for the key without success. It’s not in an office, it’s not aboard the Sei Giorni.\n\nWe try to explain how necessary the brown key is, but you just know the sales guy and Mr. Killjoy think we only want a key with a different color or something. You can see the disconnect in their eyes.\n\n“I’ll get you the brown key,” Mr. Killjoy says, and I believe he is sincere but I also believe he thinks he’ll just go to the nearest Vespa dealer – La Moto Washington, in another bit of irony – and pick up one.\n\nHe wants me to sign the paperwork anyway and I say, I’m sorry, I really like the bike but I can’t do that, not without a working brown key.\n\nSo we leave it like that, with them saying they’ll get the key and they’ll call the previous owner to see if he still has it (though he should have surrendered it with the bike as part of the trade-in).\n\nLike 29 days ago, we leave empty-handed.\n\nWe get home and I start to think how this will play out and I’m quietly convinced it won’t happen.\n\nWe’ve been in a Samuel Beckett absurdist play for 20 minutes, talking about keys with different colors and the dealership’s Vladimir and Estragon don’t quite understand because they haven’t done their homework. Vespas can be costly and complicated and dealers don’t like complications when selling used vehicles.\n\nWhat’ll probably happen is that they won’t find the original brown key or get a new one and I won’t buy the Sei Giorni.\n\nThey’ll end up selling it to someone unfamiliar with Vespas and that person will buy it and toddle off and things will be fine until they discover they need a brown key and find out they’re screwed.\n\nI’ll wait and see what happens. If under-powered Vespa scooters can win a six-day endurance race, it’s possible Godot will actually show up with a working brown key.\n\nAddendum\n\nWhat happened was just this.\n\n*\n\n1 – The Super Cub was still on the floor, but as events transpired, we didn’t look closely at it.\n\n2 – The 2020 and 2021 Sei Giornis come only in gray-blue (grigio, in Italian) which looks good, though the Portofino Green of previous models, which mimicked the 1951 racers, is better.\n\n3 – That’s a little more than half of the mileage for the first break-in service. So in essence, this Sei Giorni is practically brand new.\n\n4 – Not his real name.\n\n5 – Some folks call it a red key, because the color is somewhere in-between, though more toward brown in the spectrum. Chalk it up as just another Vespa peculiarity.\n\nIt’s not a big motorcycle, just a groovy little motorbike\n\n“Based around the air-cooled 125cc single … the 2019 Super Cub is almost as much a time machine as it is a motorcycle.”\n\n– Rider magazine review, Feb. 8, 2019\n\nI’ve been craving a Honda Super Cub C125 without knowing why until the Rider comment that made me realize, yes, that’s it – it is a sort of time machine.\n\nThe Super Cub is not the type of motorbike I normally lust after. I prefer adventure-type motorcycles1 like Endurance and Terra Nova, which is why they’re part of the fleet of five2 here at Starbase 8.\n\nI was briefly drawn to a 2021 BMW R1250 GS Adventure at Bloodworth Motorcycles in Nashville last December, a real beauty that got me going until I saw the heart-stopping price of $26,590.\n\nBut something’s been quietly nagging at me at odd moments, the notion that long-distance motorcycle travel need not be aboard a $20,000 BMW Leviathan. Maybe it’d be better if you Marie Kondoed it down to a smaller, slower bike.\n\nThree things sent me down that path:\n\nThe Long Way Down documentary in which riders had motorcycles that were a thousand times more expensive than the net worth of all the African villages they were visiting3.\n\nMy dream of riding across Vietnam on the largest bike I could rent, which would probably be no more than 250cc’s.\n\nEd March and his you-have-to-see-it-to-believe-it website C90 Adventures4, which chronicles his insane rides across Canada in winter, Alaska to Argentina, and Malaysia to the UK, all on a Honda C90 Cub.\n\nThe Super Cub took residence in my imaginary garage when I first laid eyes on a blue-and-white model at the Washington, D.C., motorcycle show in 2019. It was there because Honda was reintroducing it to American riders for the 60th anniversary of importation to the U.S.\n\nA time machine. I’d seen pictures of it in motorcycle history books, of course. It was first made in Japan in 1958, then imported to the U.S. in 1959 as a 100cc model. Honda built its sales campaign around it, the ubiquitous You Meet the Nicest People on a Honda. That was in contrast to the hoodlums depicted in the 1953 movie The Wild One5 with Marlon Brando and Lee Marvin.\n\nThere was even a song about it, Little Honda, written by Brian Wilson and Mike Love of the Beach Boys. Another group, the Hondells6, covered it and it rose to No. 9 on Billboard 100 in 1964. Give it a listen here on Shindig; you’ll enjoy the song and be grateful for improvements in music videos since then.\n\nOther advances since early Sixties include the bike’s engine, which Honda upgraded periodically. Style-wise, the Super Cub7 looks pretty much the same, with its wide handlebars, round mirrors and signature white leg shields.\n\nHonda stopped exporting it to the U.S. in 1974.\n\nAnd now the Super Cub is back, in red and white (even better!) for the 2020 and 2021 models, making me dream of riding it with Linda down rolling country roads, stopping for ice cream in small, picturesque towns, bedding down at a B&B in the Adirondacks, and zipping up Highway 1 toward Hanoi in the rain.\n\nA time machine, a dream machine, a simple machine. Something that asks you to slow down and really, really look at where you are.\n\nSo we went to the local Honda motorcycle dealership … and that’s when things started going south.\n\nThe sales rep was a good guy but did not seem to know much about the Super Cub on the floor. We tried to open the saddle to look at the gas cap, but it wouldn’t budge – the battery was too low to activate it. They put it on a charger.\n\nThat was okay, but then I asked about price, which brought in the sales manager, a Mr. KillJoy8, I think.\n\nHe ushered us over to his desk, located (inexplicably) in the Ducati section.\n\n“We don’t have much of a margin on these,” he said, and started futzing with his computer, looking up numbers, finally coming up with a price that was almost $900 over MSRP, which I thought was nearly as outrageous as the $26,000 BMW in Nashville.\n\nHe started reading off shipping charges, tax and title, dealer prep and other such nonsense and Linda asked if we could get a printout.\n\n“Our printer isn’t working,” Mr. KillJoy said.\n\nThe whole enterprise crumbled into a take-it-or-leave it affair and he appeared not to care either way. It reminded me of the Harley-Davidson dealerships I visited in the 1990s9.\n\nThey didn’t even ask for our contact information, a really bad sign. It was time to go.\n\n“Thank you for your time,” I said.\n\nOn the way out, we took another look at the Super Cub, so sad with its battery panel off and charger nearby. I was tempted to buy it anyway, just to rescue it from Mr. KillJoy. We didn’t, of course.\n\nSo we left that beautiful little bike behind but dreams die hard.\n\nWhat’ll probably happen is I’ll go back and inquire about a reasonable price and Mr. KillJoy won’t budge and I’ll get pissed off and either rationalize away the Super Cub or look for it elsewhere.\n\nOr look for something else. The Royal Enfield Himalayan, 400cc, is genuinely interesting. And Go Little Himalayan could be a catchy tune.\n\n***\n\n1 – Though I really don’t ride mine off-road. They are big, comfortable and powerful, though.\n\n2 – Yes, five: Linda’s 2007 Yamaha Vino 125; her 2020 Vespa GTS 300 Super HPE; Endurance, my 2000 BMW R1150 GS; Terra Nova, my 2012 Yamaha Super Tenere; and Santiago, my 1965 Honda CA 77, awaiting restoration in the woodworking shed out back.\n\n3 – I really like the Long Way series, but they (and other such on-the-road documentaries) got me to thinking about guys riding high-priced bikes in economically disadvantaged areas, passing through as if people in villages were simply background in a movie. Robert Pirsig talks about the difference between motorcycles and cars while traveling – “…through a car window everything you see is just more TV” – but doesn’t a $700 Shoei helmet and $1,000 Roadcrafter suit have an opposite effect on the people who see you? In both situations, you’re set apart.\n\n4 – I can’t recommend Mr. March strongly enough. He’s funny, wise, witty, adventurous, and a mechanical wizard, just the sort of guy you’d like to ride with. Do go see his site, please.\n\n5 – Which apparently scared the bejeezus out of moviegoers back then. The film really hasn’t aged well.\n\n6 – In a move that was breathtaking for its crass commercialization, they actually created a music group, named them the Hondells, and had them sing about Hondas and motorcycles and such. Their first album Go Little Honda was motorcycle-related and though Little Honda is fun and bouncy and gets stuck in your head, the other songs soon get on your nerves after a while. Their second album, released about 20 minutes later, was imaginatively titled The Hondells. I’ve yet to hear it.\n\n7 – We’re talking about a motorbike with small engine, about the size of a loaf of good bread, a single-cylinder affair that makes 9-10 horsepower on a good day. That’s on a par with Linda’s Vino scooter. Terra Nova, by comparison, has about 108 hp.\n\n8 – Actually not his real name.\n\n9 – Oh, those guys were awful. Harleys were selling like crazy back then – there were actual waiting lists – and dealers were copping attitudes like you were lucky they let you in the door. There were stories of dealerships jacking up profit margins by making you buy overpriced accessories before they’d sell you a bike. It was that attitude that drove me elsewhere, to BMW as it turned out. I bought Endurance brand-new in 2000 at Sierra BMW in Sparks, Nevada. Now that’s a great dealership.\n\nThe Best Peter Fonda Story I Ever Heard\n\nTuesday, Sept. 8 | 36 Days Before: Some of our best moments on motorcycles are encounters with bike riders and nonriders – the former who share their stories and the latter who ask, “What’s it like?” to ride a motorcycle.\n\nBoth are great to talk to1, but riders are my favorites. You get gifts of revered memories and sometimes even a glimpse of a far-away place, a shadow of road fatigue, or ghost of a frosty night.\n\nThis was a mission-prep day. We needed riding time to break in the new Vespa and ended up meandering around coastal Maryland to see a few Chesapeake Bay lighthouses. It was Linda’s idea and they were actually pretty interesting.\n\nThe Best Peter Fonda Story I Ever Heard was at the Calvert Marine Museum in Solomons, Maryland, a fascinating place even if you’re not into lighthouses and boats and the sea2.\n\nWe’d stumbled out of the museum carrying our helmets and jackets and riding gear and had commandeered3 an outside picnic table to write postcards4 to friends. We spread everything out across the table.\n\nThat’s when Joe, the lead grounds keeper at the museum, stopped by. He’d seen the Vespa and Terra Nova parked outside and our riding gear strewn about the table. He asked about our bikes and of course we started talking about motorcycles.\n\nHe was a long-distance Harley rider and a true raconteur5, a great storyteller, and among the stories he told us was this:\n\nHe’d been at a motorcycle rally in Daytona, Florida, with his girlfriend Nanette. They had their pictures taken with Easy Rider actor Peter Fonda, paying $5 each for a charity donation.\n\nAbout five months later, Joe is putting gas in his Harley at a gas station in Montana. He’s been riding two-up with Nanette, who’s in the store.\n\nWhile she’s inside, Joe sees Peter Fonda pull up on his own bike and start fueling up. It’s not that big of a surprise, Joe tells us, because he knew Fonda owned a house in that part of Montana.\n\nJoe goes over to Fonda, says hello, mentions their brief meeting in Daytona and asks a favor.\n\n“When Nanette comes out, make like you remember her,” he says. Fonda just smiles and says okay6.\n\nJoe goes back to his bike and Nanette returns. Joe motions over to Fonda and says, “I’m pretty sure that’s Peter Fonda. Why don’t you go over and say hello?”\n\nSo Nanette walks over, hesitantly, and Peter Fonda looks at her and says “NANETTE! How are you?” And Nanette’s jaw hits the ground.\n\nDuring the whole ride home, Joe says, Nanette was excitedly pummeling his ribs and saying, “He remembered me! He actually remembered me!”\n\nJoe never told her.\n\n***\n\n1 – It’s usually Linda’s red Vespa that draws them over.\n\n2 – By the time you leave there, you will be.\n\n3 – Since no one was around, it wasn’t really an act of piracy.\n\n4 – These weren’t notes from a momentous journey, since we were only 80 miles from home. But it’s never a mistake to let people know you care about them. Besides, the cards were nice. I’ve heard that few people send postcards these days, what with email and Instagram and so on. But we still do.\n\n5 – From the French term raconter, which means “to recount.”\n\n6 – I just can see Peter Fonda smiling at the idea. I’ve seen Easy Rider, of course, and Ulee’s Gold, in which he was great and deserved the Academy Award for Best Actor, and read his autobiography Don’t Tell Dad and watched him on Ride With Norman Reedus. He always seemed like a stand-up guy, a genuine good person who rejected being a Hollywood stereotype. And he loved motorcycles. I’m sorry to say he died on Aug. 16, 2019.\n\nJoe told us about a few of his other epic rides and I practically begged him to start his own motorcycle blog. He’d be great.\n\nAnd So It Ended (Part 2)\n\n“You can’t go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the ending.”\n\n– C.S. Lewis\n\nSaturday, Nov. 21 | 21 Days Later: Let’s cut to the chase: The crew at Scoot Richmond say the Vespa’s oil loss came from its breaking-in period, not because of some deeper engine problem. A top-end overhaul isn’t needed.\n\n(Part 1 is here.)\n\nAmbivalence carried the day. “Are you sure?” is what I asked, since we – that is, I – had thrown away the St. Petersburg ride on what I thought was an engine malfunction. Did we just have to add some oil and keep going?\n\nA boring recap: We left home for St. Pete on Oct. 14, rode about 400 miles in two days1 and suffered significant engine oil loss, about a pint, in Wallace, South Carolina, on Oct. 15.\n\nI replaced the oil and we trucked the scooter back to Richmond, arriving on Oct. 29. They checked the oil level, found it was good, no leaks, and told us to put 500 miles more on it.\n\nWe picked it up on Nov. 7 and put 490 miles on2 over the next two weeks, returning on Nov. 21. They checked the oil and it was okay.\n\nScoot Richmond, I should note, was very supportive throughout all of this. I have no reason to doubt them.\n\nThe theory is this: Most engines suffer some oil loss during their break-in periods3. It takes about 2,500 miles for a Vespa to break in. Linda’s Vespa has less than 2,200. So we lost the oil during the break-in to Wallace but didn’t lose any more during the 490-mile test.\n\n“Just keep an eye on it,” the service guy says. “If you have a problem, you’re still under warranty.”\n\nAnd that…was that. We rode the 103 miles home and I checked the oil the next day and it was fine.\n\nTalk about an anticlimactic ending. It’s tough to watch your cherished yearly ride get sucked away like precious water spilled on desert sand, but at least I learned to be more vigilant about checking the oil and knowing more about the bike. I just wish the lesson weren’t so costly.\n\n***\n\n1 – Yes, that’s a rather leisurely pace but it’s still fun.\n\n2 – In two trips on two weekends, one to Gordonsville, Virginia, the other to Poolesville, Maryland, for the historic White’s Ferry. Both rides turned out really nice.\n\n3 – Assuming you’re unfamiliar with engines (not that I am, of course, as these events testify) that’s the number of miles you have to ride the bike in order to smoothly wear in engine parts such as pistons and valves.\n\nAnd So It Ended (Part 1)\n\n“And so it ended, except in my mind, which changed the events more deeply into what they were, into what they meant to me alone.”\n\n– James Dickey, “Deliverance”\n\nSaturday, Nov. 7 | Seven Days Later: After too many days and too many miles in the back of a rental truck, we got the Vespa from the mechanical medics at Scoot Richmond and rode it home.\n\nWe’d left it there Oct. 291 on the way back from St. Pete. The diagnosis is: (1) We overfilled the gas tank on Day 2 in Wallace, South Carolina, and temporarily fubared the EVAP system2, and (2) The engine may have a pre-existing problem from the factory which requires a top-end overhaul3.\n\nOy vey. In the days since returning home, post-mission analysis confirms the overfill was our fault, but probability is high we could have continued riding after the fuel had evaporated from the EVAP system’s charcoal canister. That would have taken some time, perhaps overnight.\n\nThe oil loss, however, is a different matter. There was no leak but the scooter simply should not have been be using that much oil in that short amount of time. Some other Vespas with the HPE4 have been reported with similar oil consumption problems.\n\nSo Scoot Richmond will take a look, under warranty. Per their instructions, we took the Vespa home, put 500 miles on it, and will return it to them on Saturday for their inspection.\n\nAll this is a boring and anticlimatic ending to a disappointing ride, motorcycle-wise, but I was grateful anyway. We’d emerged from the cloud of uncertainty that overshadowed the entire trip, with a few sleepless nights for me worrying how I was going to get the bikes in and out of the rental truck.\n\nAt about 370 pounds, the Vespa didn’t worry me. The Yamaha, at 575, did.\n\nPart of it was YouTube disaster videos of guys riding their motorcycles up ramps and falling off. Here, this will give you an idea; go full-frame for the best effect.\n\nIn Wallace, there was no one around to lend a hand. The truck ramp was 10 feet long and about 26 inches wide. The cargo deck was 33 inches from the ground. I found a place where the ground sloped upward that reduced the ramp angle.\n\nThat was better, but it took me longer than I’d like to admit5 to work up the nerve to ride Terra Nova up that damned ramp and into the truck.\n\nThat got us over the peak, as they say. Linda and I push-pulled the Vespa up the ramp and we were able to use Home Depot tie-downs6 to secure both bikes upright in the truck. I checked them every time we stopped.\n\nAfter that, it was a matter of just driving home.\n\nDriving home. Usually I’d be brooding over the loss of a motorcycle trip, but the relief after loading the Yamaha stayed with me on the highways into Virginia.\n\nIt was kinda like the successful failure of Apollo 13, I reasoned; Linda and I may have lost the ride, but we still had each other, we were safe, the bikes were secure, we’d had a good time in St. Pete, and the Vespa would be fixed to ride another day. And we will ride another day.\n\n***\n\n1 – The official end of the mission, I reckon.\n\n2 – EVAP is shorthand for Evaporative Emission Control System, which closes the vehicle’s fuel system to prevent gasoline vapors from the tank and fuel system from escaping into the atmosphere. Overfilling the tank can cause fuel to enter the EVAP’s charcoal canister which, on the Vespa, causes a stalling/starting problem until the fuel is cleared from the canister.\n\n3 – A top-end overhaul involves taking the engine apart and replacing a number of parts, which could include piston rings, the piston itself (Vespas are single-cylinder engines) and valves. As you might guess, that’s a lot of work.\n\n4 – High Peformance Engine.\n\n5 – It really did. No one likes to admit he’s a wuss, but I was genuinely scared silly that I’d fudge it up somehow and take a tumble.\n\n6 – Four tie-downs on each bike, which may have been overkill, but I had more to make sure they wouldn’t fall over. In addition to those stupid YouTube videos, I was haunted by the experience a relative had while taking his bikes back home to California from Florida in 2003; the bikes weren’t properly secured and ended up falling over inside the truck. I didn’t want that to happen to us.\n\nJack Kerouac Didn’t Ride Motorcycles, But We Went to His Open House Anyway\n\nFrom the mission archivist: This is probably a better anecdote for house hunters and Kerouac readers than motorcycle travelers, so feel free to skip if you’re so inclined. You’re forgiven in advance, so go in peace.\n\n***\n\nSunday, Oct. 18 | Day 5: Beat Generation author Jack Kerouac died in St. Petersburg in 1969 at age 47, leaving behind a substantial body of work, his novel On the Road that influenced generations of readers, and a house on 10th Avenue North that you wouldn’t look at twice unless you knew he’d lived there.\n\nI’m a Kerouac aficionado (certainly not a scholar) and we’ve stopped by this house at 5169 10th Ave. nearly every year we’ve been coming to St. Pete.\n\nWhy that is, I can’t rightly say; we feel the need to pay respects to those we admire1, including writers whose words make you see the world differently.\n\nThat sentiment has been shared over decades by other Kerouac fans, who visit the house and put short, heartfelt notes in the mailbox and screen door. I’ve seen some of them myself, like the one pictured above.\n\nAnd now, on this St. Pete motorcycle ride (suddenly without motorcycles2) I discover Kerouac’s house has been renovated and is for sale.\n\nAn open house is scheduled for Saturday, the day we arrive, and again on Sunday, the next day. The coincidental timing is too perfect to ignore, so we decide to go.\n\n“Are you here for the house or the history?” asks the real estate agent3 when we arrive. It’s a legitimate question and we say both, because we’ve entertained thoughts of moving to the St. Pete area in a few years.\n\nBut mainly I want to see the inside of Kerouac’s house, renovated and sanitized and HGTV-ready though it may be. I also feel duty-bound to take as many pictures as I can for my best friend Van Yasek, who introduced me to Kerouac and deserves a full report.\n\nMost of the visitors are not here for history, it appears. We talk to a few while waiting outside and they confirm they’re house hunting.\n\n“Oh, we’re here for the house,” a young woman says. “This is a nice area and we’re looking to buy.” The won’t-you-please-sign-in guestbook echoes a similar theme.\n\nKerouac lived here with Stella, his third wife, and Gabrielle, his invalid mother. He was reportedly working on a novel about his father’s print shop in Lowell, Massachusetts, at the time of his death.\n\nGabrielle died in 1973 and Stella died in 1990, in Lowell. The home had been in stasis since then.\n\nA St. Pete-based nonprofit group hoped to buy the house and turn it into a writer’s retreat4 but was unable to reach an agreement5 with Kerouac’s in-laws, the owners. It was sold this year to Flip Side, LLC, a house flipper, and is now on the market for $350,000.\n\nInside – at last! – we see the sellers have taken care to acknowledge Kerouac’s presence while touting the house as a nice place to live.\n\nIt’s still a bizarre coupling of two worlds; inspecting the interior, I feel as if I’m in a TV show that’s a cross between Flip or Flop and House on Haunted Hill6.\n\nSome items are labeled “Pending certification from the estate of Jack Kerouac” which presumably means the estate will determine if Kerouac actually used it. Most of the furniture has been moved out over the years, including Kerouac’s iconic desk, which was exhibited at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell.\n\n“The house was in pretty bad shape,” the real estate agent says, and lists the repairs: a new roof, new HVAC system, wall paint, and deep cleaning. The outside walkway has been replaced for greater curb appeal.\n\nShe also says the renovators saved the original interior whenever possible. In the kitchen, “the appliances are the same and cabinets are, too. The door handles are original.”\n\nEveryone comments on the terrazzo floors7, which sparkle throughout the house. “Oh, yes, they did a great job polishing the floor,” the agent says. Even I’m impressed.\n\nWe take our time walking around, looking at rooms, noting the cedar closets and 1960s-era wallpaper and wondering what books Kerouac had in the built-in bookcase.\n\nThe house does look good and it’s fascinating to see the inside, though I feel like a bit of a voyeur looking at everything, taking in details like door handles and wallpaper.\n\nHowever, I can’t forget the utter sadness of Kerouac’s last years. He didn’t really want to move to St. Petersburg – he called it “a good place to come die” – but the climate was better for his mother, paralyzed after a stroke.\n\nHe was brutalized by the unexpected celebrity that sprang up after On the Road, his seminal work8, was published in 1957.\n\nThat book and the later writings of Kerouac and others created what came to be known as the Beat Generation9 (whose members questioned and rejected middle-class values and were later belittled and marginalized as beatniks). Kerouac became known as King of the Beats, a title he didn’t like and refused to accept.\n\nKerouac was an alcoholic for much of his life. He died at nearby St. Anthony’s Hospital in St. Petersburg of an internal hemorrhage caused by cirrhosis. His funeral was held at St. Jean Baptiste Church in Lowell, where he once served as an altar boy.\n\nSomeone, probably soon, will buy the house at 5169 10th Avenue North. They may be mindful of its famous occupant and integrate his memory into their new home, but that’s doubtful. After all, one can’t truly live in a museum; anyone who buys a house wants to make it their own. I understand that.\n\nBut the American way, the method of living shunned by the Beat Generation – the same attitude that propels us to rush ahead, forget the past, tear out what we should pause to appreciate, and calculate the quick profit – will likely prevail.\n\nI’m thankful to have seen Kerouac’s house, but I’m certain that, when we come here again next year, I’ll look at it, see what the new owners have done, and think: We’ve all blown it again.\n\nAddendum: Maybe It Will Be Okay\n\nThe Tampa Bay Times reports the house has been sold to a couple who want to preserve its history and open it to the public, either as a writer’s retreat or a place for literary events.\n\nThis comes as a surprise to me and I’m very glad to hear it. Perhaps it will work out after all.\n\n***\n\n1 – We’ve also visited the Jack Kerouac Park in Lowell, Massachusetts, where he grew up, and his gravesite in Edson Cemetery in Lowell.\n\n2 – Since our motorcycles are parked in Wallace, South Carolina, 570 miles from here.\n\n3 – Whose daughter was evidently staving off boredom on the sofa with her smartphone.\n\n4 – A different nonprofit, The Kerouac Project, had success in Orlando, Florida, where they transformed one of Kerouac’s former houses – the one in which he wrote Dharma Bums – into a writer’s haven.\n\n5 – I am sorry this did not come to pass. We attended one of their fundraisers last year and I was impressed by their vision and sincerity. The Tampa Bay Times said the Flip Side owner bought it partly because it was Kerouac’s retirement home, but mostly because he considers “it in a real up-and-coming neighborhood.”\n\n6 – The 1959 classic film with Vincent Price, Richard Long and Carol Ohmart, of course.\n\n7 – Terrazzo floors are a near-liquid composite of marble, quartz, glass and other material and are poured, smoothed out, and allowed to dry. It has a reputation for durability.\n\n8 – I really like On the Road but prefer the original scroll version.\n\n9 – Beat, as in “beat down” but also as in “beatific.”\n\nWe May Laugh About This Someday, But Probably Not Today (Part 1)\n\nThursday, Oct. 15 | Day 2: The day begins with a cryptic communique from work on my smartphone, a harbinger of changes to come, employment-wise; it throws a heavy shadow over the morning and kicks my focus off the ride for a while.\n\nWe pack up the bikes as I laborously exchange emails with trusted colleagues until I’m convinced the changes can be handled. We set course for Orangeburg, South Carolina, a 227-mile chunk of travel that will put us within arm’s reach of Georgia tonight and touchdown in St. Pete Beach, Florida, 40 hours from then.\n\nWith its 2.2-gallon fuel tank, Linda’s Vespa decides when we pause for gas. I refuel when she does, though it means putting about three gallons into Terra Nova each time we stop1. As on other rides, we develop a rhythm that works.\n\nThe rhythm has us stop 30 miles later at an Exxon station2 in Moncure, North Carolina, where I see a guy on an older Triumph Tiger, an adventure-style motorcycle like Terra Nova.\n\nI admire Triumphs of all eras but Tigers are special. I came close to getting a Triumph before deciding on the Yamaha, a Super Tenere, in 2012.\n\nI examine the Tiger until the owner emerges from the station and I introduce myself. He’s Jack Locke, from Sanford, North Carolina, not far from here. What year is the bike? How many miles does it have? I ask.\n\n“It’s a 2002 Triumph, with 162,000 miles,” he says, proudly. “And I put them all on myself.”\n\nHe’s a disaster-aid assessor for the Red Cross and has piloted that Triumph around the country. We walk around the Tiger and he points out modifications he’s made over the years, including turn signals held in place with duct tape (“someone kept breaking them off”) and other upgrades he’s done himself.\n\nHe tells us about a divorce – “she said ‘it’s either that bike or me’ and I said, well, good luck,” and listening to his travels, I’m fascinated and urge him to write about them3.\n\nWe wish each other safe travels and as Linda and I wheel away, I realize we’ve had one of those on-the-road encounters that are gifts for motorcycle travelers.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why we’re out here and my spirits lift from the hasty emails of the morning. We’re living our own lives now.\n\nWe eventually cross over into South Carolina and pull into a Shell station in Wallace, which is not much more than a crossroads of three gas stations and a few other buildings, from what I can see.\n\nI can’t resist getting out the phone again and checking email, exchanging a few texts with a colleague. Everything’s well enough there.\n\nDaylight starts to fade as we motor away from the gas station and pause at the red light on U.S. 1. The Vespa stalls.\n\nTerra Nova and I wait behind Linda as she hits the starter button. Th"
