        "text": "MUSKEGON – This is not Kevin Dalson’s first experience in the big time. This is a guy who roomed with John Smoltz back in the day, and who was a 1989 Chicago Cubs draft pick.\n\nDalson has changed games, going from baseball to softball, but the competitive fire is still there.\n\nThe fourth-year Muskegon Community College head softball coach leads the Jayhawks into the NJCAA Division II Championship tournament, which begins today at Choccolocco Park in Oxford, Ala. No. 13 seed MCC (31-6) takes on No. 4 Des Moines Area (49-12) in an opener at 3 p.m. The tourney runs through Saturday.\n\nRELATED: Details on the NJCAA Division II championship tournament\n\nAs a first-team all-state baseball player in high school, four-year starter as Michigan State University’s shortstop and one season of minor-league ball with the Cubs, the 1985 Ottawa Hills alumnus may have never imagined he’d be coaching softball at this point in his life. Now, he has no intention of going back to baseball.\n\n“If (the players) believe in you, whatever you tell them, they’re going to do it. You don’t have to deal with egos,” Dalson, 54, said. “After going to this, I would never (go back to baseball) again.”\n\nDalson finished his MSU career (1986-89) as the program’s leader in hits, doubles, runs and stolen bases. He still ranks eighth in career runs scored (143). He was named to the Big Ten All-Tournament Team in 1988, when the Spartans set a program record for wins in a season (41-20). In 1989, Dalson was named MSU’s “Gold Spikes” Award winner.\n\nDalson was selected by the Cubs in the 26th round (666th overall) of the 1989 June Amateur Draft. That year, the 5-foot-9, 165-pound infielder and left-handed batter appeared in 56 games for the Wytheville Cubs in the Appalachian League. He hit .201 with seven doubles, 11 RBIs, 22 runs scored, six stolen bases and a .298 on-base percentage.\n\n“I got released, but I wouldn’t sit here and say, ‘Man, if I would have (done this or that).’ It was a different experience; it was a great experience now that I got it, but it was different than Michigan State where you go from the ultimate winning, chemistry type team,” Dalson said.\n\n“And then minor league baseball is not for the weak, especially at those lower levels. It isn’t about team. If you lose 10-0 and get three hits (then that’s OK). … it was a different experience that way.”\n\nPrior to his MSU days, Dalson played in a Michigan vs. Illinois all-star game. His roommate was Smoltz, the future Hall of Fame closer for the Atlanta Braves, who hailed from Lansing.\n\nSmoltz was set to be Dalson’s roommate at MSU, but he signed with the Detroit Tigers the day before classes started.\n\n“On my door – I should have kept it – it had our names on it. I didn’t know he was going to be a Hall of Famer. I knew he had a great chance to be good,” Dalson recalled.\n\n“We went and played in the old Comiskey. Jim Abbott was on that team. (Smoltz) came in an inning, and from what I remember, he was just messing up – walk, walk, walk, or something like that – and then figured it out and strikeout, strikeout, strikeout. You know, just blowing people away. Just something else. So that was a cool experience for me playing in that.”\n\nDalson was at peace when his playing career ending in 1989. He admits he was not a “live-or-die” baseball player, although he was competitive and remains that way.\n\nIt’s reflected in the re-emergence of the MCC softball program under his watch. The Jayhawks captured a national title in 2010 under coach Matt Houseman and they returned to nationals two years later.\n\nDalson, who has trained baseball and softball players for more than two decades and served as a volunteer hitting coach at MCC on numerous occasions, took over as Jayhawks coach in 2018 at the urging of one of his former players.\n\nThe first two seasons did not go well: 13-28 in 2018 and 14-32 in 2019. Then, of course, last season was wiped out by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nNow, MCC is back at nationals for the first time since 2012. The Jayhawks steamrolled through the regular season en route to winning the MCCAA Western Conference title. They had to scratch and claw to get past the regional against Jackson College last Monday, ultimately pulling out the best-of-three series on Kennadi Dykstra’s walk-off home run in the eighth inning of Game 3.\n\nThe competitor in Dalson motivated him to remain MCC’s head coach after enduring rough seasons the first two years. It did not sit well with him.\n\n“One of the things we talk about, ‘Do you guys love to win or hate to lose? What is the feeling that’s deeper? The euphoria when you win or the disdain (when you lose?)’” Dalson said. “Championship teams, when you win, you expect it; when you lose, (it’s the worst).”\n\nSophomore catcher Sammy Swisher (Byron Center) said that Dalson pushes the Jayhawks and makes sure they are playing their best.\n\nFreshman first baseman/pitcher Kendyll Bond (Jenison) said the Jayhawks know they’re good and they’re confident they can beat anyone, so when they do lose, it’s because they did not play their best.\n\n“When we all have that mentality, I think it makes it even easier,” said Haley Arsenault, a sophomore outfielder from Allendale.\n\nDalson, who attributed much of the team’s success to the contributions of assistants Dave Veihl and Kirsten Sweet, said he’s learned a lot coaching travel ball in his four years at the MCC helm. He reiterated the idea that if players do not respect the coach, it will show up on the field.\n\nOf course, winning helps with chemistry, too.\n\n“It’s taken a few years, and now we are where we are,” Dalson said. “Coaching’s overrated. You’re as good a coach as the athletes you’ve got. I believe that 100 percent.”\n\nRelated reading:"
