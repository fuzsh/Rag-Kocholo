        "text": "Actress Sanaya Irani rose to fame with the show Miley Jab Hum Tum (2008-2010). She met co-star Mohit Sehgal on the sets of the show and it was an instant connection. As the show progressed, they fell in love and decided to live together.\n\nIn picture: Sanaya shared this photo on Instagram and captioned it: When u have the best light but still don't know how to take a selfie. Such good light, no filter, selfies not my cup of tea.\n\nSpeculations about Sanaya Irani and Mohit Sehgal's wedding kept going on for years, but the couple maintained that they wanted to concentrate on their careers.\n\nIn picture: Sanaya shared this adorable picture with Mohit and wrote alongside: Happy love day, my love and Happy Valentine's Day to all you beautiful people out there. keep spreading love, laughter and happiness cause that's what makes the world go round.\n\nSanaya and Mohit got engaged in December 2015. The Roka ceremony happened in Delhi among close family members. They tied the knot in January 2016, in Goa.\n\nTalking about Sanaya Irani's career so far, the pretty actress made her acting debut with the TV show Left Right Left in 2007. But she rose to fame with the show Miley Jab Hum Tum (2008-2010).\n\nIn picture: \"Sometimes kisses are just not enough @imohitsehgal,\" Sanaya Irani captioned this picture.\n\nIn 2010, Sanaya Irani hosted the dance reality show Zara Nachke Dikha - Season 2 and even participated as a contestant in the show Meethi Choori No 1.\n\nIn picture: Sanaya Irani shared this picture with her mother on Mother's Day and wrote alongside, \"Happy mothers day mom. I love you and miss you, wish you were here... but since your day has just begun, have an awesome one. Also happy mother's day to all those beautiful mothers out there.\"\n\nIn 2011, she starred alongside Barun Sobti in the show Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon? The daily soap became one of the most-watched shows on television.\n\nIn 2013, Sanaya Irani also starred in Rangrasiya, opposite Ashish Sharma. Inspired by Shakespeareâ€™s Othello, the show was shot in the same location of Rajasthan where Aamir Khan's Sarfarosh was shot.\n\nIn 2017, Sanaya Irani along with her husband-actor Mohit Sehgal participated in the celebrity dance reality show Nach Baliye - Season 8. The couple emerged as the second runner-ups of the season.\n\nIn picture: Sanaya Irani shared this cute picture with her husband Mohit Sehgal and captioned it: The couple that lives together also does make up together @itsmohitsehgal filling in his beard while I fill in my lips. Marriage = love = companionship and also = no sense of personal space.\n\n\"We were being offered 'Nach Baliye' since last four or five years, but due to work commitments, we were not able to become a part of it. I don't want to do two things together. This time also there were a few date issues. However, somehow we managed to make time and decided to do this show,\" said Sanaya Irani.\n\nIn picture: Sanaya Irani shared this picture and captioned: Always wanted to have a #floatingbreakfast. Have seen so many people doing it and being the water baby I am, always felt I was missing out. Thank you @hiltonseychelleslabriz for making this experience so much fun. @itsmohitsehgal\n\nIn 2018, Sanaya Irani made her web debut with the web series Zindabad. She was seen playing the role of a RAW agent in the show, which also featured Vikram Bhatt.\n\nIn picture: \"My most favourite place in the world the beach with my most favourite person @itsmohitsehgal\" - wrote Sanaya Irani as a caption to this image.\n\nThough Sanaya Irani had already made her Bollywood debut with Aamir Khan and Kajol's Fanaa (2006), where she played one of Kajol's friends, it wouldn't be wrong to say that it was a blink-and-miss role. Nevertheless, her recent film Ghost, directed by Vikram Bhatt, marked Sanaya's Bollywood outing as the lead actress.\n\nTalking about working with Vikram Bhatt, Sanaya said, \"I was working with Vikram on a web series, where he was my co-actor, he must have thought at that time my work was good. I was thinking about the story of Ghost first, I wanted to do something interesting. I found it very interesting since it was based on a real incident.\""
