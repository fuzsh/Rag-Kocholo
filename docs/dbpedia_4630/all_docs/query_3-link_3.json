        "text": "Sneaker culture has exploded globally – and in India – over the last couple of years and custom sneakers is a huge part of it. Multi-brand sneaker stores such as VegNonVeg and Superkicks have found a loyal following among the country’s sneakerheads, who are happy to wait in hour-long queues to cop the latest pair of dope kicks. Online, there’s a feeding frenzy when a new hypeworthy pair drops. (Travis Scott x Jordan 1 Highs, we’re looking at you). A merry band of resellers are making a killing, buying and reselling kicks at several times the original retail price.\n\nBut while store bought sneakers are cool, you can get more creative. Just under the radar is a group of dedicated artists and sneaker customizers, including players like Courtside (@_courtside_) in Delhi and Mumbai’s Kanika Ranka (the_studioproject) who’re creating unique, one-of-a-kind custom works of art for their clients and for brands alike. We spoke to four of the coolest artists on the scene right now – makers whose clientele includes everyone from Ranveer Singh and Ranbir Kapoor to Tiger Shroff and Raftaar. But that’s not why they’re cool. These are the creators pushing the scene right now. Read on for an insight into sneaker culture in India, and everything you need to know about getting your own pair.\n\nSanaya Irani (@brushtler)\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nA self-described loner in the custom sneaker industry, Sanaya’s work came to our attention via Lemonade Social’s recent celebration of World Skateboarding Day. A Mumbai-based makeup artist and painter as well as a customizer of T-shirts, caps, bags, hoodies, jackets and shoes, she ventured into the scene because of her “love for painting and, ironically, white shoes.”\n\nThe origin story\n\n“I used to attend college festivals like Kaleidoscope and Kshitij, where they had sneaker and T-customization contests and I used to win some of them, which boosted my confidence in my abilities to be able to do this. I started doing research on YouTube, then bought the appropriate paints on a trip to the US.”\n\nThe dope\n\nColourful, funky, unique, Sanaya’s designs are diverse and eclectic, from clean colour blocking to detailed Marvel superheroes. “I haven’t claimed a style yet,” she says, “and try to do anything and everything because it builds my client base as well as expands what I can artistically execute.” The price for her custom kicks depends entirely on the design, the size and material of the shoe, the coverage on the shoe, but broadly expect to budget from between Rs 4,500 for a basic design to Rs 12,000. Sanaya can help you choose a pair of shoes as well. She’ll work on used shoes that are up to a year old, but beyond that, they’re likely to be worn out. The entire process can take between 2-4 weeks.\n\nFav customizers\n\nArt By Cian (artbycian), Yasemin Karakaya Yılmaz (@yaskarakaya) and Cam Createz (@camcreatez) are brilliant. Locally, Chaitanya Dixit’s work is dope.\n\nFav artists\n\nBillie Eilish for her taste in clothing, her attitude, the way she lives her life, the songs she sings are inspirational. And she’s so young!\n\nDream commission\n\nKicks for Billie Eilish. I would just die.\n\nDream sneaker collection\n\nLondon-based influencer Sherlina (@sherlinanym) has my dream sneaker closet, with over 500 pairs in every colour possible.\n\nCoolest commissions\n\nDrake sneakers, a DaBaby jacket and a Pop Smoke custom jacket. I’m not that comfortable with portraits, so when I pull it off I’m really proud to have done it.\n\nFav Sneakers\n\nNike’s Air Force 1. I’m a nerd for plain white sneakers. I’m a customizer – but I’d never customize my own shoes.\n\nKicks I’m saving up for\n\nThe neutral grey Air Jordans 1. And a pair of Naked Wolfe high tops! They do awesome kicks. I’m comfortable spending around 10-15K on sneakers, but anything above that would worry me a little. I honestly don’t get the hype around certain pairs and the astronomical prices they sell for. I’m the kind of person who wants to buy sneakers and wear them right away rather than put them on a shelf and never use them, but that’s just me!\n\nNOW READ\n\nCrocs, Birkenstocks and the rise of comfort footwear: How the pandemic kicked off the shoe trend of the moment\n\nShould you wear Crocs? Just ask Zoë Kravitz\n\nJay-Z’s Puma x Rhuigi sneakers are a summer flex\n\nMore on Style & Fashion"
