        "text": "Colors' reality show Bigg Boss 18 will reportedly be starting from October 5, 2024, and fans are keen to see some exciting contestants with the superstar host Salman Khan. The OG host brings his charm to the show, which makes it stand out from the rest. There were rumours that popular television actor Arjun Bijlani would be one of the contestants on Bigg Boss 18. The actor has left people guessing about his participation. Over the years, we have seen many top actors from Indian television rejecting Bigg Boss, including Divyanka Tripathi, Sanaya Irani, Erica Fernandes and more. Here are a few reasons why the TV stars have rejected the Salman Khan-hosted show. Let's take a look. â€˜Bigg Boss 18â€™ Release Date: Hereâ€™s When and Where To Watch Salman Khan Hosted Reality Show Online!\n\n'Bigg Boss'- Not Worth the Effort?\n\nWith the popularity of over-the-top entertainment platforms, many top Indian TV stars are doing web series and shows. Not only are OTT series creatively satisfying for them but they also bring in good money for the actors. One can earn a decent sum in 15-20 days of work. The reality show Bigg Boss, which is a TV show telecast on OTT, is also lucrative but stressful. From surviving on bare necessities to having to indulge in fights with co-contestants to provide content for the show, it is just not worth the effort, feel some TV stars. During Bigg Boss 15, there were rumours that actress Divyanka Tripathi may join the show along with her actor husband Vivek Dahiya. However, Vivek had clarified then that the two won't be a part of the show. â€œWe are not cut out for Bigg Boss. We won't be able to give any masala (controversies) to the show,\" he had said. The last season that saw some big TV stars as contestants was Bigg Boss 13. 'Bigg Boss 18' Tentative Contestants List: Ranvir Shorey, Mr Faisu, Avika Gor, Daisy Shah, and More Rumoured To Be Part of Salman Khanâ€™s Show.\n\nIs 'Bigg Boss' a 'Marriage Bureau'?\n\nAnother major issue is the concept of 'shipping. Actors get paired up by viewers and co-contestants, or they themselves find love on Bigg Boss and are then worshipped by fans. Arjun Bijlani himself termed the show as a 'marriage bureau'. Married actors and actresses who appear as contestants don't have to worry much, as they have partners in real life. However, even actors who are single are in two minds about indulging in PDA on Bigg Boss. Moreover, the makers of Bigg Boss add in more spice by bringing in the actors' ex-lovers as contestants. They must keep in mind that not everyone is comfortable showcasing problems from their personal life on national television.\n\nDamage to Image\n\nThe core of Bigg Boss is the ugly fights. Tempers fly and it brings out the worst in each contestant. However, the damage done to an actor's carefully constructed image outside the House can be permanent. Popular TV stars build their image via their shows, so Bigg Boss appears to be a huge risk. Top actress Sanaya Irani also rejected Bigg Boss, saying it's \"not my cup of tea\". She would only do it if she needed the money, she said. The cancel culture on social media is also growing by the day and may affect the actors. It is very rare to be authentic on the show and win hearts, like Bigg Boss 13 winner Sidharth Shukla could manage to do. â€˜Bigg Boss 18â€™: Did Armaan Malikâ€™s Second Wife Kritika Malik CONFIRM Her Participation in Salman Khanâ€™s Reality Show? (Watch Video).\n\nSharing Space With Influencers\n\nWith the advent of digital media, reality shows like Bigg Boss are bringing in more influencers and content creators as contestants. However, not every TV personality is comfortable being on the same platform as these influencers. The Internet sensations often come with a huge external fan base, and TV actors know they have little chance to win against them.\n\nIn recent years, these have been some of the reasons why TV stars are reluctant to participate in Salman Khan's Bigg Boss. As the show involves, things may change and we get to see major TV stars again."
