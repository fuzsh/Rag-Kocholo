        "text": "Miley Jab Hum Tum actors Sanaya Irani and Mohit Sehgal are one of the most-loved television couples. The two tied the knot in 2016 and have been giving us #CoupleGoals ever since. Currently, they are on a holiday in San Francisco. And their vacay is making us wish they‚Äôd pack us in their suitcases. Like us, if you‚Äôre also staring at your screen right now, dreaming of being on a chutti, we‚Äôve got a treat for you. Nope, not a holiday package but all their holiday pictures that will transport you to haseen vadiyan right this moment.\n\nCheck Out All Their Pictures Here:\n\nJust look at their happy faces in winter wonderland!\n\nInstagram\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLike all of us, #Mohaya seem to be cupcake lovers too. Celebrating Christmas in true spirit. Sanaya shared this cute picture and captioned it, ‚ÄúHappy faces post cupcake session‚Äù\n\nThings You Do On A Vacay!\n\nInstagram\n\nWhat‚Äôs a holiday if you do not indulge in some crazy adventurous monkey stuff? Sanaya just did something that we can relate to. One, hang by a tree‚Äôs branch and two, break our phone. The Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon actress captioned this picture, ‚ÄúHanging in there üòÄüòÄ. This was the very moment my phone fell out of my back pocket and broke üôàüôà.‚Äù\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLook At This Snow-Fight!\n\nMrs. Sehgal captioned this one, ‚ÄúGot you Mr. Sehgal @itsmohitsehgal . Winter is here ‚ùÑÔ∏è ü•∂ ‚õÑÔ∏è‚Äù\n\nPayback Time!\n\nMohit did not leave any chance to make Sanaya pay for what she did to him. This fight is the cutest thing you‚Äôll see on the internet today. He shared this video and wrote, ‚ÄúPayback time Mrs. Sehgal @sanayairani üòÇüòÇ‚Äù\n\nStraight Out Of A Film Set!\n\nInstagram\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA View To Die For!\n\nInstagram\n\nDil Garden Garden Ho Gaya!\n\nInstagram\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe couple also visited the famous Japanese tea garden. ‚ÄòCoz chai and are just made for each other. This particular picture takes us back to their Thailand trip last year where the couple spent some quality time together getting spa treatments done and just relaxing by the beach.\n\nSeems like the two love to tour the world together. On the work front, the couple last participated together in Nach Baliye in 2017 and won the third spot. If we just talk about Sanaya, she made her big Bollywood debut earlier this year with Vikram Bhatt‚Äôs Ghost. The actress was also highly praised for her stellar performance in the movie.\n\nEnjoy the rest of your vacay, you too!\n\nFeatured Image: Instagram"
