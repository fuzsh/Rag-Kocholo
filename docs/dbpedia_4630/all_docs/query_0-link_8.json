        "text": "Hey everyone this is my first time writing and even though i have been a Iss Pyar Ko Kya Naam Doon fan since it started and I love Arnav and Khush aka Barun Sobti and Sanaya Irani. Sanaya was in Artesia, California, USA today!\n\nSo i wanted to tell you what happened today in Artesia while Sanaya Irani aka our Khushi was here.\n\n1st it started off with the the inaguration ceremony and Sanaya cut the ribbon around 1 and then she moved to Tangy Tomatos restaurant for a photo session and then around 2pm was at the Dish Botth taking pics and greeting fans.\n\nMy cousins and got there around 2:30 and as we got into the long line to take pictures with Sanaya they said that that was it n we couldnt take anymore as she was gonna move on to another place.( As they said that we got a peak of Sanaya and she looked abolutely gorgeous especially in the yellow salwar kameez!)\n\nSo they directed us to go to the Dream Collection clothing store as she was to be there at 3:30. We went all unhappily thinking that we were not gonna meet her. Then as we went inside the clothing store the owners and employees were waiting for Khushi to come and my cousins and I were the only 4 people there. We were in shock as she said you guys should start off the line and that they were not gonna let anyone else enter as Khushi was gonna arrive with her 2 bodyguards and Rajan Singh They let us stay because we were so excited to meet Khushi and so we began to sing the theme song to them and i showed them pictures I had gotten printed out of Barun and Sanaya so that Sanaya can sign it. They knew we were crazy fans and so didnt want to make us unhappy and stuff and they loved how we had the pics and thought it was cute! . We were incomplete because they were soo kind enough to let us stay as Khushi came in to meet them and shop around :)\n\nSo after about 20 minutes of waiting they got the call saying Khushi was walking and is on her way to the store with her bodyguards. My cousin and I kept screaming and were like \"OMG OMG our dream has come true and we were gonna meet Sanaya!\"\n\nSo the Khushi can in with her Bodyguards and Rajan, one of the bodyguards blocked the door and other led her in. There was starplus camera video taping as they came in. Then my cousin and a few other fans sang the \"Iss Pyar Ko Kya Naam Doon\" theme song! they all forgot the lyrics and so i myself finished off the song (i will post the video if i can). Sanaya was like \"Wow and kept smiling and looking at us (n me). Everyone all was excited and laughed as they saw how much we loved her and the show. We asked her where \"Laad Governor/Barun was\" and she said he was in the UK and she laughed and smiled so warmly.\n\nThen the owner of the shop took her around we kept taking picures off her n star plus recorded her. Then she came out way and she smiled and answered questions for us as we joked with her and the crew that came with her. Then my family and I went and took loads of pictures with her and gave her a few hugs (she was sooo sweet about them!)My 4 year old neice went to her and showed a pic of Sanaya wearing a red sari and Barun the red shirt (the Star Parivaar Picture) and asked Sanaya \"Y are you not wear this dress?\" (pointing at the sari). My neice also called Khushi \"The Princess of India!\" Sanaya bent down to my neices height and laughed and gave her loads of hugs and kisses! (My lucky neice, and this was her 1st meet, she got more hugs again later). She gave us personalized autographs and signed my necies and my picture! We then asked her to sing \"Aja Mausam Hai Soohana\", and she said she fogot the lyrics and told me to start it so I did and she joined in and was really impressed on how I knew the song (i also got that on video). Rajan also joked around with us and I told him how i learned about him from India forums and we joked on how popular he is now. He told Sanaya \"Look now i am popuar to, they know me\" and Sanaya Laughed and so did we. He also said that he is working on getting Barun to come to the U.S. and I also told Sanaya to send our love to all the cast and especially Barun and she gave a hug and said she will :).\n\nI told her to please come back with Barun and we want IPPKND season 2 and she smiled and so did the others :). After 10-15 minutes they were about to leave and their was a big crowd outside taking pictures. She gave us one last Good Bye and we wished her well .Then bodyguards took her in ran her into the car away as people ran to take pics, i managed to get some pics of her leaving too. It was then 4:15ish.\n\nThe event planner said she is coming back at 5:30 to the dish booth. SO my cousin and I saw the line form and were so happy we do not have to wait in the long line. She came back around 5:30 and her guards rushed her to the booth as everyone took pictures. I stayed out and took more an Rajan Singh saw my cousin and I and said\" the Paparazzi is back\". lol to me. We then went n took a pic with him . Then after taking pics and greeing people for an hour she then went to the near by grocerystore and fortunelty my cousins were there inside and she took loads of pics. SHe and my neice were near the fridge isle and then all of a sudden Sanaya came that way and smile at them. My neice then said \"You came back to see me?\" Sanaya smiled and gave her another hug and Kiss. Sanaya kept rubbing my neices hair saying how soft it was (because my neice has very soft and silky hair). I couldnt enter becasue the body guard blocked the door. But i still met her as i was standing near the dish booth n she was smiling at me and posed for more pics :) Some girls yelled out \"Mohit is a great actor!\" and Sanaya winked and said \"I know!\"\n\n(She looked very exhausted by the end of the day)\n\nThen she rushed out the door with the gurads and they ran to the car. AS they got in my cousin and i ran towards it and they lowered their window and Sanaya and Rajan Singh gave my cousin and I one last smile and a wave. I screamed and said Iss Pyar Ko Kya Naam Doon and they smiled and laughed and then they rolled up there window and drove off.\n\nThe security guard said you guys are amazing fans! and we smiled. Our throat still hurts from all the screaming and singing!\n\nI had an amazing day and was very lucky! Sanaya Irani is beautful and tall and very skiny. She has great skin and so did not require lots of make up. She looked simple. She stopped to tak several pics with me and my cousins and laughed how muched we lover her and the whole cast and show, I have even more love and respect fot her now becuase she is a genuine actor and person! I wish all the best and loads of success and hope to see her (and Barun) on the screens!!!\n\nWe all wished that Karan Goddwani aka NK was there :). Cant wait to meet her again InshaAllah! (i will not be going tom.) But hope u all who go have lots of fun and get a chance to meet this amazing person <3\n\nI am having trouble posting pics (i have loads to share) please help :)\n\nPictures: Khushi entering the shop Dream Collections\n\nTalking to Rajan Singh as Sanaya looked around. He said that it was great seeing fans like us and we love Sanaya. He also said he is working on brining Barun! :)"
