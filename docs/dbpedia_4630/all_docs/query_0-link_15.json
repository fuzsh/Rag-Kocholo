        "text": "He also shared another picture where he rests his head on Sanaya’s lap and the background is romantic. He captioned this picture, “My happiness lies in your lap b’cas it makes me forget all my worries. Thank you soooo much @ritusharma2015 for clicking this picture.”\n\nThe couple also recreated the iconic train scene from DDLJ. Like Shah Rukh, Mohit was aboard the train as Sanaya ran towards him. But unlike Kajol’s Simran, Sanaya rushed right past a bemused Mohit. “Was trying to recreate DDLJ scene with Sanaya Irani but...,” Mohit captioned the video.\n\nHe also shared pictures of himself in Switzerland and the place looks stunning. It looks like the actor wants to stay away from phones as he wrote along with this picture, “Who else wants to shut off their phone, #bike to a lake, forget everything and just listen to the sound of water #bliss #inlovewithswitzerland #interlaken @myswitzerlandin.”\n\nThey also paraglided in Interlaken, one of the cities well-known for the range of adventure sports available in Switzerland. Mohit wrote, “Flying on top of the most beautiful place #interlaken #switzerland will be one of the most beautiful experiences I have had . Thank you so much @paraglidinginterlaken @myswitzerlandin #inlovewithswitzerland.”\n\nSanaya and Mohit’s show concluded in 2010 and the two got married in 2016 in a beautiful ceremony attended by friends and family on January 25 in Goa."
