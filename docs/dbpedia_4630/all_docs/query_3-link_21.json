        "text": "Homepage\n\nBollywood\n\nInterviews\n\nSanaya Irani: If My Husband Mohit Can Kiss On Screen, So Can I- EXCLUSIVE\n\nSanaya Irani gets candid with SpotboyE.com that Mohit and she do not have different rules in their marriage. Also, the TV actress talks about her maiden film Ghost\n\nA popular face on TV, Sanaya Irani is pretty kicked about her big screen debut with the Vikram Bhatt film Ghost that releases on October 18. We caught up with the actress ahead of the film’s release and she spoke about what kept her away from TV all this while, her kissing scene in the film and husband Mohit’s reaction, and of course, her real-life spooky experiences.\n\nYour film is called Ghosts. Do you believe in ghosts in real life?\n\nI do believe in spirits. I believe that we all have a soul and when we die, the soul moves on. I read a lot of books, I'm quite spiritual. I read on after life, past life, so I do believe in it. Not necessarily, every spirit is bad or demonic.\n\nHave you ever experienced any paranormal activity?\n\nDuring the climax scene, we were shooting in a building which was in ruins and London was cold; that building didn't have doors or windows. So, literally we were shooting outdoors. But for some reason, when I would stand outside that building it was cold but when I would stand inside that building it was bone-aching cold. I was so uncomfortable, so as a person I'm very intuitive and I pick up on vibes and when I entered that building, I didn't get a good vibe about it. I started telling everyone that I just want to get done with this location.\n\nWhere was the location?\n\nIt was in London. I have shot for my climax scene there. There was just something off about that place. Even while going to the loo, I would try to avoid. And it was so cold. My coat caught on fire and I didn't realise. I was just getting the weirdest vibes.\n\nFor the first time you are locking lips on screen...\n\nYes, it was my first time and I think something like kissing is so normal and natural between two people. That being said, I know every actor says this that it has to make sense to the script. But, it really does. See, our film is a horror film. There’s not so much time to spend on a love story. And, if you need to show that two people are getting together, and how much they feel for each other, you need a little more than them just standing away from each other. So, when you see it, it just organically happens.\n\nSo, did you ever discuss the kissing scene with your husband Mohit Sehgal before going ahead with it?\n\nIn fact, Mohit was doing a film before me where he had a kissing scene so he was the first one to discuss it with me and I said, ‘Baby, we are actors and it doesn’t work this way. If you think it’s not unnecessary, because I do feel sometimes that in the future also I will lose out on a lot of work because I would say that certain physical aspects are unnecessary. He was actually more reluctant than me, he said‘I don’t want to do this’ and I asked ‘Why’. I told him that if you have a problem then you should not do it. But, if you are thinking anything about me having a problem, that’s not going to happen.’ So, there is no hypocrisy in a relationship, if one person can do it, the other can.\n\nThey say it’s difficult for a TV actress to be accepted in Bollywood because they get typecast. Have you ever faced such a situation?\n\nI haven’t faced it, but I have heard it too and I think my way of facing it is that it is true. I’m not getting Bollywood film offers right now. It’s not that there are 10 offers in my kitty. I feel even the web world is a little hesitant when it comes to people from Television. I get it that they feel there’s a certain kind of acting that we do. But I had to change it for this film. I would say that I got lucky. I got a Vikram Bhatt who had worked with me and liked my work. That’s how work plays out. I’m hoping that when people see Ghost they would say, ‘Oh, so she can do this kind of acting too.’\n\nEven after all these years, the audience still wants to see you and Barun Sobti return on the show, Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon. What do you want to say to them?\n\nFirstly, I feel that Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon is like the DDLJ of TV. And I can’t even explain how lucky and grateful I am. It’s so easy to be forgotten by people when you’re not working and it’s not because they don’t love you anymore. It’s because there is somebody else and they love them at that point. But, our fans have held on. I’m so grateful that this show has done what it has done for me. Thank you guys for loving it and I want to give credit to the entire team.\n\nIf a second season is planned, will you do it?\n\nEveryone thinks that I don’t want to do it, but I would do it very happily. However, I will definitely study the content.\n\nImage Source:- youtube/poojaentertainment\n\nUp Next\n\nAfter Avengers, Thor Chris Hemsworth Wants To Reunite With Iron Man Robert Downey Jr And Captain America Chris Evans For This Film\n\nDon't Miss\n\nSaroj Khan Death: When The Ace Choreographer Shared An Emotional Moment With Madhuri Dixit At IIFA 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou may like\n\nSanaya Irani And Mohit Sehgal’s Seychelles Vacay Pics Are A Sight For Sore Eyes ­­­­­­­­­\n\nBigg Boss 13: BFF Sanaya Irani Says, 'Dalljiet Kaur Is Strong, She Does Not Pick Up A Fight With Anyone Aimlessly' ­­­­­­­­­\n\nSanaya Irani & Mohit Sehgal’s Romantic Pics From Their Swiss Holiday ­­­­­­­­­\n\nIshqbaaaz: Not Drashti Dhami Or Sanaya Irani, This Actress Will Romance Nakuul Mehta Post Leap ­­­­­­­­­"
