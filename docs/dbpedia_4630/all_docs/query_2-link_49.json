        "text": "There are several interesting moments that happen on the sets of ‘Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa Reloaded’ but never aired on the small screen. Click through the gallery to get familiar with such special moments. Sanaya Irani was absolutely shocked when her boyfriend half Mohit Sehgal dropped in on the sets of ‘Jhalak Dikhla Jaa Reloaded’.\n\nMalaika, watch your back! What else would you say when she has Ganesh Hegde and Shahid Kapoor as co-judges?\n\nAre they soul sisters? Going by what Shamita Shetty and Sanjeeda Sheikh had to say on the show, that’s how it has to be interpreted. In her tweet Shamita referred to Sanjeeda as a ‘doll’.\n\nMohit Malik was super delighted after giving a sensual performance with Mohit Gulati. The two were just too good.\n\nFaisal Khan definitely has enough time to take pictures. Agreed, the pressure is high to outperform his competitors, but not at the cost of some backstage fun."
