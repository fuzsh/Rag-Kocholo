They met on the sets of a show which they were shooting together, fell in love, got married, and are happy in their lives together, chilling even.\n\nSanaya Irani was already a popular name and Mohit Sehgal had started to make his name in the Television industry with their TV show 'Miley Jab Hum Tum'. Interestingly Sanaya and Mohit played a couple even on the show. Even after being husband and wife, their PDA levels are still the same and it is adorable to see so.\n\nSanaya, who is marked as one of the topmost Television actresses today, got married to her love Mohit Sehgal in January 2016. They visited Goa during that time, and Mohit Sehgal was reminded of those moments as the much-loved couple arrived in Goa yet again, three years after their marriage."
