        "text": "Sanaya Irani and Barun Sobti‘s show Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon used to be one of the highest rated show on TV. All thanks to the amazing chemistry between Sanaya and Barun. They are the perfect example of off-screen camaraderie creating magic on-screen. To the absolute delight of their fans, the cast of IPKKND were good friends and have remained so until today.\n\nBarun and Sanaya are often spotted hanging out with each other and it’s clear that they are really close. So, it’s only fitting that Sanaya was not only present but was one of the first to announce Barun and his wife Pashmeen Manchanda‘s pregnancy.\n\nAfter 9 years of happy marriage, Barun and Pashmeen are all set to welcome their first child. Sanaya took to announce the happy news to the world through her Instagram. She congratulated the couple with a post from their baby shower and needless to say the soon-to-be parents were glowing with happiness in the picture. Sanaya had the sweetest message for the parents-to-be as well.\n\nCheck it out:\n\nSanaya’s husband Mohit Sehgal also took to wish the couple with a picture from their baby shower.\n\nTake a look:\n\nHow cute is that?!\n\nCongratulations, Barun and Pashmeen. We are so excited for you and can’t wait for the little one to arrive! We wish you all the best."
