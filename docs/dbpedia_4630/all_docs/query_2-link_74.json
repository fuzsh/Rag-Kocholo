        "text": "Star Wars Outlaws is set to bring us the “first-ever” open-world game set in a galaxy far, far away.\n\nAs one of the biggest upcoming Ubisoft games on the horizon, there’s already plenty to get excited about in this adventure featuring the scoundrel Kay Vess.\n\nThe gameplay promises a dynamic experience, featuring a comprehensive wanted system, versatile blaster mechanics, and more.\n\nCounted among a slate of exciting upcoming Star Wars games, such as Star Wars Eclipse, Star Wars Outlaws is one of the most anticipated new games for 2024.\n\nWith exciting reveals about what’s in store in the Outer Rim, this title is poised to offer a groundbreaking open-world experience in the Star Wars universe.\n\nThe Story\n\nSet between Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, the game follows Kay Vess, a scoundrel who is trying to survive in the Galactic Empire.\n\nThe core storyline will see Kay attempting to pull off a massive heist in order to pay off a huge bounty that’s on her head.\n\nIn Star Wars Outlaws, the player is free to explore and travel between at least five major worlds, ranging from Tatooine to stormy Akiva and showy Cantonica, home to the casino city Canto Bight, featured in The Last Jedi.\n\nWherever Kay ends up, she’ll encounter criminal syndicates from throughout the Star Wars franchise.\n\nThere are the brutish Pykes, the Hutts, the shadowy Crimson Dawn, and the Samurai-inspired Ashiga.\n\nCarrying out tasks for a syndicate earns you credits and reputation points, opening up more lucrative jobs as well as new areas of the map.\n\nGetting in with one gang will mean alienating another, but there will be opportunities to play the crime bosses against each other or double-cross them.\n\nThe game will involve a crime system that is similar to those used in the likes of GTA and Red Dead Redemption 2.\n\nCreative director Julian Gerighty says:\n\n“As a scoundrel you live and die by your reputation, meaning that Kay will have to navigate the underworld and its various crime syndicates, making choices that will impact her reputation, her experience, and her support throughout the game.”\n\nThe system includes multiple levels, with level 6 being the highest.\n\nPlayers can adjust the settings of the system to create the ultimate self-imposed challenge.\n\nReputation will fluctuate based on actions, allowing players to improve their standing with crime syndicates by taking on contracts after making mistakes.\n\nKay Vess\n\nKay Vess is a brand new character introduced to the Star Wars universe.\n\nShe’s a scoundrel attempting to survive the criminal underworld, against the backdrop of the Empire’s ongoing war against the Rebel Alliance.\n\nSteve Blank, director of franchise content and strategy at Lucasfilm, says:\n\n“We were just looking for the right moment that would define the gameplay and allow you to go to cool, interesting places to meet interesting characters.\n\n“So we found a place that was rife with opportunity for an underworld narrative… the eyes of the empire are focused very much on the rebel alliance, so organised crime has been able to thrive.\n\n“Jabba the Hutt is at the height of his power.”\n\nKay will be looking to pull off the biggest heist the Outer Rim has ever seen, all with the help of her loyal companion Nix.\n\nBut she may have bigger things to worry about.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe first look at Star Wars Outlaws gameplay reveals that Massive Entertainment is developing a Rockstar-style adventure set in space.\n\nAs Kay, you’ll be doing what it takes to survive – even if that means making shady deals with Syndicates, double-crossing the Empire, and betraying whatever few friends you have left.\n\nUbisoft Massive has fully committed to creating an open-world Star Wars game.\n\nOutlaws will guide players through more contained areas for missions, which can be approached stealthily or with full-on action using a blaster.\n\nPlayers can also ride speeders to explore different towns and cities on various planets.\n\nIf they find themselves in trouble with the ruling party, they can escape in their spaceship, the Trailblazer, and use hyperspace.\n\nPlayers will have complete freedom to pilot their ship, engage in dogfights, and explore a vast system of planets.\n\nThere are options to customise both the Trailblazer and the speeder.\n\nAdditionally, players will be equipped with a blaster that offers various modules to ensure a “full-fat shooting experience”, according to lead gameplay designer Fredrik Thylander.\n\nDevelopment\n\nStar Wars Outlaws has been developed by Massive Entertainment but features aspects seen in Ubisoft titles.\n\nUbisoft is the game’s publisher.\n\nThe stealth, combat and the balance between story and side quests parts from Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry and Watch Dogs.\n\nPlayers can study patrols, take targets out one by one using a range of special abilities and then flee.\n\nFurther elements are borrowed from other action adventures, including Kay’s ability to slow time and target several enemies before unleashing a multi-shot salvo with her blaster – paying homage to Max Payne and Red Dead Redemption.\n\nGerighty says: “When we first imagined the first open-world Star Wars game, we explored where and when it could take place, and quickly realised that we had all the right ingredients for the journey of a scoundrel.\n\n“These outlaws live life under the thumb of the Galactic Empire, but can still thrive given the opportunities that the criminal underworld opens up for people looking to take advantage of the turmoil.\n\n“The time is ripe for a new outlaw to make their name, and Kay Vess is written in the stars.”\n\nStar Wars Outlaws promises to be a landmark title in the Star Wars gaming universe, offering players the first-ever open-world experience.\n\nAs Kay Vess, players will navigate the treacherous and thrilling criminal underworld of the Outer Rim, making choices that will impact their reputation and standing with various factions.\n\nWith its ambitious scope and immersive design, Star Wars Outlaws is poised to captivate fans and newcomers alike.\n\nAs the game approaches its August 30, 2024, release date, anticipation continues to build, marking it as one of the most exciting additions to the Star Wars gaming franchise."
