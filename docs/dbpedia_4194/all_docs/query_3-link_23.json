        "text": "Indira Gandhi assassinated\n\nIndian Prime minister Indira Gandhi assassinated\n\nMore Information and Timeline for Indira Gandhi\n\n1. Indira Gandhi was born on November 19, 1917, the daughter of India's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru.\n\n2. Indira Gandhi was first appointed prime minister in 1966 after the death of Lal Bahadur Shastri, becoming India's first female prime minister.\n\n3. Gandhi was a very popular leader during the beginning of her time as prime minister, partially due to a series of successful reforms.\n\n4. In 1971, she showed support for the separation of east and west Pakistan by offering military support to east Pakistan. This lead to the defeat of Pakistan in 1972 and the creation of Bangladesh. This success also increased her popularity.\n\n5. Gandhi was accused of electoral corruption during the 1972 election and was convicted in 1975. While she had been expected to resign, she did not. Instead, she declared a state of emergency, censoring and suspending the civil liberties of political rivals and dissidents.\n\n6. She called for a general election to take place in 1977 and was hoping her popularity would help her win again after she eased off restrictions. She did not win the election.\n\n7. In 1980, Indira Gandhi ran for her fourth term as prime minister, now a part of a new political party, and won the election.\n\n8. In June of 1984, the holy Golden Temple in Amritsar was taken over by a Sikh separatist movement and Gandhi sent in Indian troops to remove them. As a result, hundreds were killed and the incident inspired a Sikh uprising within the country.\n\n9. On October 31st, 1984, Indira Gandhi was assassinated by two trusted Sikh body guards outside of her house. They were seeking revenge for the events at Amritsar.\n\n10. After her death, there were several incidents of violent retaliation against the Sikh population by ordinary Indian citizens.\n\nApple Macintosh Commercial\n\nThe original Apple Macintosh personal computer went on sale during January of 1984. The PC was the first mass-produced Apple computer that was mouse driven and had a built-in graphical user interface. The Macintosh was originally priced at about $2,500.00, which was more expensive than several other competitorsâ models, but it still sold well despite the higher price. Itâs success may have been due to the iconic advertisement for its release which aired during the Super Bowl. The Ridley Scott directed Orwellian-themed â1984â ad is considered to be one of greatest commercials ever created.\n\nBand Aid\n\nBritain and Ireland's top pop musicians gathered in a Notting Hill studio to form Band Aid and recorded the song \"Do They Know It's Christmas\" in order to raise money for famine relief in Ethiopia.\n\nMore Information and Timeline for Band Aid\n\nDuring November of 1984, 44 group members of âBand Aidâ came together to record the single âDo They Know Itâs Christmas?â in a London studio. The group was created by musician Bob Geldof with the intention of raising money and creating a greater awareness of famine and poverty in Ethiopia and the whole of Africa. The single became the number one Christmas hit that year and raised millions of dollars for its cause. Notable participants in the Band Aid recording included Phil Collins, Bono, Sting, Duran Duran, Culture Club, Bananarama, James Taylor, George Michael, David Bowie, and Paul McCartney.\n\nHong Kong\n\nHong Kong -- The UK and China agree Hong Kong will revert to China in 1997\n\nMore Information and Timeline for the Sino-British Joint Declaration.\n\nOn December 19th of 1984 China and the United Kingdom agreed to transfer power in Hong Kong from the UK to China in 1997. Hong Kong had been given to Great Britain in 1842 as a result of the First Opium War and had been under some form of British colonial rule since then. In 1982 China and the UK began discussing what to do with Hong Kong and in 1984 UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang agreed to a transfer of power to take place in 1997. The Sino-British Joint Declaration stated that Hong Kong would become âone country with two systems.â This meant that upon the transfer of power it would become a part of Communist-run China but would be allowed to keep its capitalist and partially democratic systems in place for fifty years. In July of 1997, the handover was considered a success and 156 years of British Rule officially came to an end in Hong Kong.\n\nUnited Kingdom - Miner's Strike\n\n1. A massive year-long minerâs strike began during March of 1984 in England.\n\n2. The strike was held by the National Mineworkers Union under Arthur Scargill and it was organized against the National Coal Board, an agency of the British government which was led by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.\n\n3. The National Coal Board was planning on closing 20 collieries which would have cost 20,000 jobs.\n\n4. At the height of the dispute more than 150,000 miners went on strike and brought much of the nation to a standstill.\n\n5. It became the longest industrial dispute of the century and lasted until March of 1985 , despite having been ruled illegal during September of 1984.\n\n6. Thatcher held strong against the defeated strikers and most of the proposed closings took place 8 years later.\n\nMore News and Key Events From 1984\n\nUnited States - Summer Olympics\n\nThe 1984 Summer Olympics, also known as the Games of the XXIII Olympiad, begin in July.
