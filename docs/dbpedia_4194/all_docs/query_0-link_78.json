        "text": "\"Have you played Atari today?\"\n\nAs Pong's popularity started to decline (coupled with the introduction of the Fairchild Channel F, the first system to have programmable \"ROM\" cartridges), Atari realized that the market for home videogame consoles that could only play one game was fading fast. So, in 1976, Atari frantically started working on project \"Stella,\" a new cartridge-based home videogame system.\n\nAs the project drew nearer to completion, Atari realized that they didn't have the money to finish the project and get it into production. Nolan Bushnell (founder of Atari) needed capital, so he sold the company to Warner Communications for $28 million in October 1976. Warner wanted Atari to rule the videogame world, so they enthusiastically sunk over $100 million into their new acquisition. Warner expected Stella (now dubbed the Video Computer System, or simply VCS) to be a huge success, since they knew Atari could make lots of money selling software for the new system.\n\nThe VCS, unlike most other home videogames of the time, had a CPU and enabled users to play different games simply by sticking in another cartridge. The actual game was stored on the cartridge's ROM, not in the system itself. This meant the VCS was able to play an unlimited number of different games, unlike the limited Pong-style consoles.\n\nSears Video Arcade ad VCS sales were boosted by the deal Atari had already set up with Sears & Roebuck to distribute its Home Pong units. Under this continuing arrangement, Sears sold its own version of the VCS called the Sears Video Arcade, and VCS cartridges under its \"Tele-Games\" label. Atari, in turn, was able to get tremendous exposure for its console since Sears had hundreds of store locations nationwide.\n\nIn October 1977, the VCS was released with a retail price of $200. Nine games were available for its launch, and despite the Sears deal, initial sales were disappointing. This was partially due to the large numbers of inexpensive handheld electronic games, such as Simon, that were flooding the market.\n\nBushnell began to clash with Warner management by 1978. Warner began to replace Atari's loose, unstructured (and fun) \"hacker\" culture by introducing dress codes and time cards. That, combined with Warner's decision to start up a computer division which Bushnell did not approve, led Atari's founder to leave the company. Bushnell signed a five-year agreement not to compete with Atari and bought his Pizza Time Theater restaurant (later to become the \"Chuck E. Cheese\" franchise) back from Warner.\n\nInvaders to the Rescue!\n\nSpace Invaders VCS Space Invaders Videogames started to become increasingly popular in 1979, but the VCS wasn't exactly breaking any sales records. That is until 1980, when Atari became the first company to port an arcade game to cartridge. The game? Space Invaders. Space Invaders for the VCS hit the shelves in January, 1980, and was a huge hit. Many people bought the VCS just to play Space Invaders at home, as Warner had predicted. The future of Atari looked bright.\n\nBut that same year, a group of high-profile Atari programmers, disgruntled over Atari's policy of giving little or no credit to game creators, left the company. David \"Pitfall\" Crane, Larry \"Combat\" Kaplan, Alan Miller, and Bob Whitehead (creators of many Atari sports games) left Atari to form Activision, a company which later developed some of the VCS's best games. Atari wasn't very happy about having to deal with this new competition (as Atari was the sole producer of VCS games prior to Activision's formation), and at the time they didn't realize that this was the beginning of the end of their software dominance. Other companies such as Games By Apollo, Parker Bros., Telesys, and Spectravision started to join the fray, and soon more and more VCS titles (of varying quality) appeared on the shelves.\n\nThroughout 1981, Atari ported more arcade hits to the VCS, like Missile Command and Asteroids. Videogames continued to rise in popularity, but with the Mattel Intellivision gaining followers and the next-generation ColecoVision console looming on the horizon, Atari decided to release its own high-powered machine in 1982. The Atari 5200 Supersystem was named for its part number in the Atari catalog, CX5200. Following this trend, Atari renamed the VCS the 2600. The company continued to support both consoles, but was soon disappointed by the 5200's comparatively poor performance in the marketplace. The failure of the 5200 was partly due to its inability to play 2600 games, as well as its shoddy controllers. Also, many gamers simply preferred Coleco's console.\n\nPac-Man VCS Pac-Man The 2600 got a shot in the arm in 1982 with the release of Pac-Man. Even though it wasn't a very faithful port, department stores around the world promoted the new cartridge to death, holding Pac-Man contests and the like, and kids loved it. Critics pointed out that Atari probably threw the game together quickly and didn't care about its quality, since a home version of the arcade smash would have sold well no matter what. This didn't stop people from purchasing Pac-Man in huge numbers, although some customers may have had their faith in Atari shaken after experiencing this terrible translation of the game. Atari made a bigger mistake later that year with the release of the E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial videogame. While E.T. was one of the most popular movies ever, the game was horribly frustrating and poorly designed (the programmer, Howard Scott Warshaw, offers some explanations here). While the game sold over a million copies, over 5 million sat unsold in warehouses. Atari paid $21 million to license E.T., and needless to say, they lost a lot of money.\n\nCompetition and the Video game \"Crash\"\n\nRegardless of some of Atari's mistakes, the 2600 had become so popular and had such a large user base that competitors Coleco and Mattel both released add-on modules to allow their systems to play 2600 games. Coleco even sold a stand-alone 2600 clone called the Gemini, which included two controllers that incorporated both sticks and paddle knobs. Atari initially threatened clone producers with lawsuits, and actually sued Coleco over its 2600 module and Gemini clone. However, since the 2600 contained no patented material and was made up of all \"off-the-shelf\" hardware (and no copyrighted software), the company evidently realized litigation was futile. Coleco and Atari settled out of court, and many other companies quickly came out with their own 2600 clones, some of which are still made to this day.\n\nIn 1983, Atari's competition continued to heat up. With the 2600 rapidly becoming obsolete, plans were made to upgrade the system by turning it into a home computer. Atari proposed their \"My First Computer\" add-on; Entex proposed the \"Piggyback\"; Unitronics pushed \"The Expander\"; and Spectravideo came up with \"Compumate.\" They all failed miserably (or weren't even released), and were crushed by competing home computers and console systems. The 2600 started to fade away rapidly and the 5200 wasn't picking up the slack.\n\n1984, the videogame market collapsed under the weight of cheap, poorly designed software from companies like Data Age and Mythicon. That didn't stop Atari (because the 2600 had been steadily declining anyway), and they kept trying to push the 2600 with promotions and low prices, emphasizing the vast number of games available. Even in 1989, Atari was pushing the Atari 2600 Jr. in its \"The Fun is Back... Under $50\" campaign. As if anyone wanted twelve-year-old technology when the NES was ruling supreme and the Genesis was starting the 16-bit revolution. Some of the best 2600 games were programmed in this era, however, including Solaris and Midnight Magic.\n\nThe Atari 2600, despite its shortcomings, was the most popular pre-crash system, selling over 25 million units. It produced large numbers of enduring classics, increased the popularity of videogames, and helped establish the home videogame console market. Later Atari consoles like the 5200, 7800 and Jaguar never came close to achieving the glory the 2600 enjoyed.\n\nAt the peak of 2600 popularity, \"Atari\" was a household name making millions and millions of dollars and employing over 10,000 people. But it declined, and the company effectively died in July 1996 when it was purchased by JTS (a hard drive manufacturer) who sold off most of Atari's remaining assets. Atari was then brought back to life in February of 1998, when JTS sold Atari to Hasbro. Hasbro tried to bring back some of the Atari magic, reviving games from Atari's vast library of classics and updating them for a modern audience, producing titles like Pong: The Next Level and Breakout: The Great Escape. In December 2000, French entertainment company Infogrames acquired Atari, along with several other Hasbro properties. On May 7, 2003, Infogrames officially changed its name to Atari and has been doing business under the Atari brand ever since.\n\nAtari 2600 Games Library\n\nThe 2600's game library, compared to the libraries of other videogame systems, is by far the strangest and most varied. The sheer number of games, which totals over 1000 cartridges by some estimates, coupled with the fact that pretty much anyone could make a 2600 game (there wasn't really any licensing system, a mistake that was later corrected by next-generation systems such as the NES) made for some really weird stuff. The 2600 produced its share of great games, but the vast majority of 2600 games were cheaply made, trashy, and created simply to cash in on the videogame \"fad.\"\n\nX-rated Games and Other Oddities\n\nCuster's Revenge Custer's Revenge The Atari 2600 had the honor(?) of being the first system to feature \"adult\" videogames. These included X-Man, Beat 'Em and Eat 'Em, and various others. Although not very explicit (this is 4-bit graphics we're talking about) and extremely trashy, these games were somewhat popular, for their \"naughtiness\" if nothing else. Of all the games ever released on the 2600, Custer's Revenge caused the most controversy. The object of the game was to get an... excited... General Custer to the other side of the screen where a nude Indian maiden was tied up to a pole. If you \"won,\" you could rape the maiden by pressing the joystick button. Needless to say, many people found this and the other \"adult\" games very offensive. On the other end of the spectrum, there were Christian games such as Eli's Ladder and The Music Machine.\n\nSince almost anyone could make 2600 games, some companies decided to produce games for promotional purposes. Chase the Chuckwagon, which was offered by Ralston Purnia in exchange for a proof-of-purchase from its dog food, is one of the more valuable and sought after games today due to its rarity. Tooth Protectors was a mail-order promotion by Johnson & Johnson to customers who purchased its products (usually Crest toothpaste). The most popular promotional game was Kool-Aid Man, which was originally available in exchange for \"Kool-Aid Points,\" but was later sold in stores.\n\nSwordQuest Contest\n\nOne of the more interesting game series for the 2600 came about as a result of the legendary \"SwordQuest Challenge.\" Launched in 1982, this contest would span four DC comic books and four game cartridges. There would be four parts of the quest, which were referred to as \"worlds\" (the four worlds being Earth, Fire, Water, and Air). For each world, there would be a separate prize and in the end, there would be a showdown between the four winners for the grand prize. What were the prizes? Get this: for each world, the prize was an 8-karat, jewel-encrusted, $25,000 artifact designed specifically for the contest. The artifacts were the Earthworld Talisman, the Fireworld Chalice, the Waterworld Crown, and the Airworld Philosopher's Stone. The grand prize was a $50,000 \"Sword of Ultimate Sorcery.\"\n\nSo how'd the contest work? Well, you basically got the comic and the game and tried to solve the game by finding a certain phrase using clues in the comic to solve the game. Needless to say, this wasn't easy. Earthworld was won by Steven Bell, Fireworld by Michael Rideout.\n\nHowever, the contest was never completed. The Waterworld cartridge was released, but the prizes were never awarded (perhaps Waterworld went millions of dollars over budget... perhaps Kevin Costner was involved?). Actually the whole series was rather boring and the console market crash brought it (thankfully) to an early end. It was an extravagant and original idea, though, to say the least.\n\nThe Good, the Rare, and the Homebrewn\n\nActivision made some of the best games for the 2600. As mentioned above, Activision was formed by some of Atari's top designers. A few of their more popular games included Boxing, Commando, Decathlon, Dolphin, Double Dragon, Fishing Derby, Freeway, H.E.R.O., Pitfall!, Rampage, and River Raid. Not too surprisingly, Activision is one of the few 2600-era companies still in existence.\n\nGames released during or after the crash of '84 are usually rare, and these include some pretty good games such as Q*bert's Qubes, one of the more valuable 2600 carts. Z-Tack, Cakewalk, Stronghold, Sword of Saros, Video Jogger, Berenstain Bears, Boing!, Out of Control, Up 'N Down and Mr. Do's Castle are a few other examples.\n\nThis Planet Sucks This Planet Sucks The fan following of this system is strong and strikingly well-organized. A number of independent and semi-corporate developers have released \"homebrew\" games for the console in recent years. Ed Federmeyer is widely recognized as the first homebrew developer, releasing SoundX (a sound utility cartridge) in 1994 and Edtris 2600 (a Tetris clone) in 1995. Later homebrews include Okie Dokie, Oystron, and one of the best-named videogames ever, This Planet Sucks. Homebrew 2600 games are usually available as downloadable ROM images or in cartridge form from Hozer Video Games. Those interested in programming their own 2600 games can learn all sorts of useful information at the archives of the Stella Mailing List.\n\nFive Must-See 2600 Games\n\nPitfall!\n\nA landmark game and one of the 2600's best, Pitfall!, was one of the first \"side-scrolling\" platform games.\n\nIn Pitfall!, you play Pitfall Harry, a jungle adventurer. The object of the game is to collect 32 items of gold, silver pieces, and money bags in 20 minutes. Along the way, you must avoid rolling logs, bottomless pits, crocodiles, fires, snakes, scorpions, and other obstacles. You can swing on ropes, jump on crocodile heads to cross ponds, and climb ladders. Pitfall! is 255 screens long, and is sure to keep you busy. Even the sound effects are great.\n\n\"I knew that there was great potential in 'run, jump, and climb' adventure games, but the result was beyond any expectations. It sold millions of copies, established a new genre of adventure games and spawned hundreds of similar products. There are now more sideview platform video games than any other category. I wanted to do a game with a running man. I had designed one and I liked the effect, but I had to make a game out of it. So, I thought, 'Well, he has to be running somewhere...' so I drew a path. And then I had to put it into a place - so I picked a jungle. The idea took all of ten minutes. It was a simple idea - a man running in a jungle. But, it spawned a genre of side-scrolling games. It was the beginning of a genre. Also, I guess people just remembered it as being neat.\" - David Crane, Pitfall!'s Creator\n\nFast Food\n\nYou're a set of chomping teeth, and you race around munching flying junk food while dodging purple pickles. Eat too many purple pickles and you'll die! It's fast-paced, simple, fun, and addicting. Everything a good 2600 game should be. A great \"twitch\" game.\n\nJoust\n\nSpace-Age Joystick Atari and third parties introduced all kinds of accessories and expansions for the 2600. Some of Atari's products included the \"Space-Age Joystick\" (which actually looked really lame), the bright blue plastic Kid's Controller, and the Video Touch Pad. There was also an alarming amount of products that were announced but never released. Atari was infamous for its vaporware. Some products that never saw the light of day include the aforementioned computer add-ons \"My First Computer\" and \"The Graduate,\" and the Voice Commander voice recognition system, which Atari had planned to develop with Milton Bradley.\n\nA lot of strange 2600-compatible devices did hit the market, however. Amiga released a NES Powerpad-like device called the \"Joyboard\" that required you to stand on a board and rock in various directions to control the game. Vidco's Copy Cart set allowed players to copy existing games onto a blank cartridge. The frighteningly named \"Grabber Balls\" were plastic knobs that attached to the standard 2600 joystick to give it an \"arcade feel.\" The Coleco-designed Kid Vid Controller was a cassette player that worked in tandem with special cartridges to produce unique children's games.\n\nThe most unusual accessory for the 2600 (probably the most unusual videogame accessory ever, actually) was the Atari Mindlink controller. Mindlink was a little headband type thing with infrared sensors that strapped onto your forehead. You'd connect it into the \"Mindlink transmitter,\" which plugged into the controller port. Then you'd have a hands-free controller which reads your mind! OK, it didn't really read your mind. It just detected muscle impulses when you moved your eyebrows. When it was unveiled at the 1983 Consumer Electronics Show, the audience thought it was a joke and laughed when an Atari executive put it on. Then the Mindlink fell off his head and broke.\n\nThe Mindlink confused the hell out of almost everyone who tried it at the trade shows. The game used to demo it, Bionic Breakthrough (a Breakout clone), wasn't exactly that cool to start with. Since Mindlink was controlled by muscle impulses, you had to squint, raise eyebrows, and generally make yourself look like an idiot to control the game. Many people walked away with headaches.\n\nAtari wisely decided not to release the $100 device, but a few prototypes still exist, including two games: Bionic Breakthrough, Mind Maze, and the newly discovered Telepathy, which recently sold at auction for over $1000. Atari promised other Mindlink software, including an ESP program, memory games, and a bio-feedback program.\n\nInteresting Accessories and Clones\n\nA more useful accessory was the Gameline, a modem which allowed you to download 2600 games from a mainframe. There is a really interesting story behind this, which has been told superbly in this great article by Dan Skelton. You'll probably be very surprised... you might even be using a descendant of the Gameline right now without even realizing it.\n\nAs mentioned above, there were many unauthorized clones of the 2600. Besides Coleco's Gemini, there was the Columbia Home Arcade (basically a Gemini in disguise) and the Brazilian pirate console Dynavision. Various pirate machines like the Rambo and Bharat's 32-In-One usually included built-in games. The TV Boy, which is still being produced in other countries, is small and portable. Using the optional antenna and four AA batteries, all you need to do is point the unit at a TV tuned to channel 13 and play one of the 129 built-in games. It doesn't let you play games that aren't built into it (since there is no cartridge slot), and has no screen. But there is at least one (commercial) portable 2600 system with a screen—the ultra-rare Mega Boy.\n\nIn September 2000, Benjamin Heckendorn wrote into ClassicGaming's Mailbag with the news that he had built his own portable 2600 by modifying a regular six-switch console. Visit his website to learn more about the Game Boy-like VCSp and how you might be able to make your own!\n\nVarious accessories tried to increase the power of the Atari 2600, the most popular being the Starpath Supercharger. Designed by Bob Brown, one of the leaders of the Home Pong and 2600 teams, the Supercharger added 2k of ROM and 6k of video RAM to help enable the 2600 to produce higher resolution graphics. Supercharger games came on cassette tapes, which were loaded into the Supercharger via a standard tape deck. Supercharger games had far better graphics and gameplay depth than \"normal\" 2600 games, and the Supercharger is still popular in 2600 circles today.\n\nBob \"Saltine\" Colbert exploded the potential of the Supercharger when he developed MakeWav and other utilities, programs to convert binary Atari 2600 ROM files into audio (.WAV) format. These files could then be transferred to cassette or played directly from a PC sound card through the Supercharger, thus allowing the games to be played on a real 2600 console. This allowed 2600 programmers to test their projects on real 2600 hardware in a matter of minutes. Not all 2600 ROMs work using this method, but a substantial number do.\n\nColbert quickly followed up MakeWav with Cheetah, a program that operates like a 2600 Game Genie. Cheetah allows players to cheat at games played through an emulator or Supercharger by performing minor alterations to program code. See his website (currently missing, let us know if you know where it went) for more details on these programs, as well as 2600 technical information.\n\nBridgestone Multimedia currently owns the rights to the original Supercharger games, and in the late 1990's they authorized the Cyberpunks, a group of 2600 enthusiasts, to release a CD containing all the Supercharger games as audio tracks. The limited edition CD was called Stella Gets A New Brain and quickly sold out. The Cyberpunks are now offering a second edition (Stella Gets A New Brain 2) of the CD which contains lots of other 2600 goodies in addition to the Supercharger games.\n\nThere are many other accessories available for the Atari 2600, and many more accessories which were planned but never released. Like the games, most accessories were gimmicks—controllers or enhancements of limited value designed to cash in on the 2600's success.\n\nEmulation\n\nIn the late 1990s, Activision released the Atari 2600 \"Action Packs,\" four collections of 15 emulated games each for personal computers. The company followed this in October 1998 with the release of Activision Classics for the Playstation, a collection of 30 ported (read, \"imperfect\") Atari 2600 games. Hardcore 2600 fans prefer one of the other emulators available, the most popular being the nearly perfect, multi-platform Stella."
