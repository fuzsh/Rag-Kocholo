This issue of Atari Age features the double page coverage of Mario Bros. by Nintendo. The Atari 2600 and 5200 Mario cartridges pre-date the NES Classic home video system of 1985 (1987 in the US). Second to last issue of this magazine as it would turn out. Catalog intact! Every issue of Atari Age is like a little 1980's time capsule in my opinion. The graphics, the interviews and the format itself are so representative of what we think of when think 80's pop culture.
