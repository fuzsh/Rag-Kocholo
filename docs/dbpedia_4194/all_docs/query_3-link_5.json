        "text": "George Orwell’s dystopian novel “Nineteen Eighty-Four,” published in 1949, predicted we would be living in a surveillance state. Sales of the book spiked four years ago after revelations of massive domestic surveillance operations in the United States, and the novel might draw parallels to today.\n\nIn the actual year 1984, the setting for the second season of Netflix’s “Stranger Things,” things seemed a bit goofier.\n\nHere are some reminders.\n\nCalling it “a nutritious and wholesome food,” President Ronald Reagan designated July as National Ice Cream Month and the third Sunday of the month as National Ice Cream Day.\n\nThe Apple MacIntosh personal computer was introduced with an ad that paid homage to Orwell.\n\nFashions included leggings, jean jackets, parachute pants, giant shoulder pads, short skirts and fluffy hair, and Madonna’s head-to-toe lace look.\n\nThe “Where’s the Beef?” catchphrase was introduced in a Wendy’s commercial by a character played by character actress Clara Peller who was 81 at the time.\n\nHulk Hogan took down The Iron Sheik and became the WWF champ for the first of six times.\n\n“I’ll be back” became Arnold Schwarzenegger’s catchphrase from a line in “The Terminator.”\n\nThe Los Angeles Olympics were held, and McDonald’s offered free food tied to the number of U.S. team medals. When the Soviet Union boycotted the games, the Big Mac maker found themselves forking over more burgers than they anticipated.\n\nAmerica was reading “The Hunt for Red October,” “Bright Lights, Big City,” “The Witches of Eastwick,” and “Iaccoca,” the autobiography of the chairman of Chrysler Motors, Lee Iaccoca.\n\nVanessa Williams, the first black Miss America, lost her crown because of some “artsy” nude photos taken years before that were published in Penthouse magazine. (She later received an apology from the pageant, and became a pretty big star, too.)\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were first introduced as a comic.\n\nBaby on Board signs were first marketed in the U.S.\n\nMore than 20 million Trivial Pursuit games were sold.\n\nThe board game Balderdash was created.\n\nThe top shows on television were “Dynasty,” “Dallas,” “The Cosby Show,” and “60 Minutes,” and “Family Ties.”\n\nThe top-ten grossing films were: “Beverly Hills Cop,” “Ghostbusters,” “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,” “Gremlins,” “The Karate Kid,” “Police Academy,” “Footloose,” “Romancing The Stone,” “Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,” and “Splash.”\n\n“Terms of Endearment” won the best film Oscar in ceremonies in April of 1984. “Amadeus,” released in September, would go on to win the next year.\n\nRob Reiner and Christopher Guest popularized the mockumentary with “This is Spinal Tap”\n\nRolling Stone has dubbed 1984 as “Pop’s Great Year.” No. 1 hits included: “Owner of a Lonely Heart,” “Karma Chameleon,” “Jump” “Time After Time” “I Just Called to Say I Love You,” “When Doves Cry,” and “Like a Virgin.”\n\nThere were a number of great songs that didn’t top the charts. “Relax” by Frankie Goes to Hollywood is used in an eye-popping sequence in Brian De Palma’s “Body Double.” De Palma also directed Bruce Springsteen’s video for his hit “Dancing in the Dark.” It was the first to feature Springsteen in the flesh and a then-unknown Courtney Cox was asked onto the stage by the Boss.\n\nSpringsteen’s album “Born in the USA” was released along with the single of the same name, and President Reagan cited it as a song of hope, although Springsteen described it as being about a man facing a spiritual crisis.\n\nWhen Madonna started grinding on the floor at the end of the live version of “Like a Virgin” at the VMA awards set the stage for shock performances by pop stars.\n\nAnd in a nod to Orwell’s surveillance state, DNA fingerprinting was introduced.\n\nOriginally Published: October 26, 2017 at 7:02 a.m."
