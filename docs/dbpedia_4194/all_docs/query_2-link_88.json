        "text": "Atari Inc., attempting to rekindle enthusiasm for its video game and computer products, introduced a sophisticated video game machine yesterday that it said was the first of a flurry of new products.\n\n''I believe that over the next 12 months this beleaguered company is going to surprise a lot of people,'' said James J. Morgan, the chairman and chief executive of the Warner Communications unit, who was brought in last year to save Atari. The company, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., lost more than $500 million in the price war that devastated the home computer and video game businesses last year.\n\nBut Mr. Morgan, who on numerous occasions has been blunt about Atari's problems, said the company had ''not completely'' turned around, and he complained that ''numerous levels of bureaucracy and red tape'' still hinder the company's creative efforts and marketing plans. A further reorganization of Atari, he said, would be announced in the next few weeks, but he refused to give details.\n\nOptional Keyboard\n\nThe new product, which Atari calls the 7800 Prosystem, will sell for $149 and appears to be a replacement for the company's current top-of-the-line machine, the 5200. Company officials disclosed for the first time yesterday that the 5200 is no longer in production, and Atari appears to be selling off its inventory.\n\nThe new video game model includes higher-resolution graphics and an optional keyboard that will convert it into a low-performance home computer. When pressed, however, company officials acknowledged that no programs currently on the market would run on the computer. ''We intend to be careful in positioning,'' Mr. Morgan said, ''so that the consumer understands that this is not a full- powered computer.''\n\nAtari said that game cartridges designed for its most popular and longest-lasting machine, the 2600, would run on the new system. Such compatibility is considered critical to the success of any new video game machine from Atari, to encourage consumers with older machines to buy the newest models.\n\nA Question of Timing\n\nStill, some analysts have questioned whether the timing is right for a new machine, particularly one whose primary attributes are technical improvements on the 5200.\n\nBut Mr. Morgan and other company officials insisted that Atari had carefully planned the move, and that demand for new video game products remained strong.\n\nThe officials cited a highly favorable response to the machine in a marketing survey conducted for the company, but they refused to give production figures or sales estimates."
