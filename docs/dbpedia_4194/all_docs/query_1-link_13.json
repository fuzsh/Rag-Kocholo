        "text": "There is something that has puzzled me for years, and that's why Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong JR and Mario Bros. appeared on the Atari 7800 in 1988 in the US, which was a competitor for the NES at the time. I do know that around 5 years earlier these 3 games, as well as Nintendo's Popeye, got multiple ports on many consoles and computers, but that was before the NES was released outside of Japan so it made total sense, but here the NES was already out and at the peak of it's popularity in the US, so is really strange to see them still getting ports on other consoles and not being just NES exclusives now. It's basically the only time alogside the CDI disaster where Nintendo allowed their ip's to appear on a rival console.\n\nI want to know if any of you have heard why this happened. I at first thought that it maybe was because Atari in fact had the license for these 3 games 5 years earlier and they somehow still had it active, but that seems unlikely since their license for the 2 DK games was only for computers, since Coleco had it for consoles, and it's rare that they would do these ports as late as 1988 and not around the launch of the 7800.\n\nthe planned deal for Atari to distribute the Famicom has already been mentioned, but it's worth noting we actually have one of the internal Atari letters discussing the situation.\n\nThat negotiating session began with a statement from Mr. Yamauchi\n\nas to the terms and conditions which he demanded, namely:\n\n1. that Atari would purchase the assembled and tested\n\nmain pc board for the FCS from Nintendo, for sale\n\noutside of Japan. Nintendo would sell the FCS on its\n\nown in Japan.\n\n2. after some minimum purchase of assembled and tested pc\n\nboards, we would be able to buy the 2 custom chips\n\nfrom Nintendo without having to have Nintendo assemble\n\nthem into the final unit.\n\n3. that Nintendo would only disclose the electrical specs\n\nfor the PPU and CPU, the circuit diagram of the FCS\n\nsystem, the test programs, and the \"cassette\" specs\n\n(meaning the ROM cartridge and cartridge edge\n\nconnector specs).\n\n4. that there would be no disclosure to Atari of the\n\nprogramming specs for the PPU and the CPU.\n\n5. that Nintendo would program titles of our choice for\n\nthe FCS system and would sell us the assembled and\n\ntested, unlabeled ROM carts at 1,500 Yen each FOB\n\nJapan for retail sale by Atari. The minimum quantity\n\nrequired by Nintendo per title would be 100,000 units\n\nand at that level there would be no fee for\n\nnon-recurring engineering/programming expenses.\n\n6. that Atari would hereby obtain a \"right of 1st\n\nrefusal\" on future Nintendo coin-op titles for use\n\nworldwide (outside of Japan) only for the Nintendo FCS\n\nsystem .... again, by programming and manufacturing\n\nthose carts themselves for sale to us.\n\n7. that the cost of the assembled and tested main pc\n\nboard would be higher than the 5,300 Yen quoted\n\nearlier to cover the cost of FCC compatibility. Also,\n\nthat the resulting new pc board would not fit into the\n\nplastic being used by Nintendo for this unit in Japan.\n\nBy the time we finished the negotiations on that trip (5/17 -\n\n5/20), the deal was changed to be as follows:\n\nA. Nintendo would disclose all items called for in my\n\nmemo of 5/13/83 (to Henricks and Paul) except for item\n\n13., namely, the LSI tapes for chip fabrication. This\n\ndisclosure would take place upon signing of the deal.\n\nAll items which are originally in Japanese are to be\n\nfurnished to us both in Japanese and in English.\n\nB. Upon signing the deal, Nintendo would reassure Atari\n\nabout the source of supply of the 2 custom chips.\n\nC. Any increases in the cost of the main pc board due to\n\nFCC compliance will be a straight cost pass through\n\n(no additional profit to Nintendo).\n\nD. Atari and Nintendo would work together to attempt to\n\nlegal protect the CPU and PPU designs.\n\nE. Nintendo would receive $5. Mil upon signing as an\n\nadvance against future payments.\n\nF. Atari would have to commit to a minimum purchase of 2\n\nmillion hardware units (some mixture of assembled and\n\ntested pc boards and CPU/PPU chip sets) over the term\n\nof the contract.\n\nG. The term of the contract would be 4 years with a 4\n\nyear option to renew.\n\nH. Nintendo would receive an additional $3.5 Mil in a\n\nline of credit as an advance upon future payments upon\n\ndelivery of the 1st production-ready prototype of the\n\nPAL West Germany version of the FCS (no later than\n\n1/1/84). Similarly, an additional advance of $1.5 Mil\n\nfor SECAM.\n\nI. The 2 million unit commitment would be broken-up into\n\n1 million NTSC, 700,000 PAL, and 300,000 SECAM. If\n\nAtari goes over in one catagory, it would directly\n\nreduce our requirement in any other catagory of our\n\nchoice. As Skip Paul likes to put it, \"cross-\n\ncollateralization is the key!\"\n\nJ. Nintendo would commit to produce 100,000 units of the\n\nassembled and tested pc board by August 31st if the\n\nnew pc design (to include FCC and to fit whatever\n\nplastic we choose) can be completed by Nintendo\n\nand approved by Atari by July 20th. In essence,\n\nunlimited quanities (in excess of 1 million/month)\n\nthereafter .... upon 3 months notice from Atari.\n\nK. Atari will have the right to program for this system\n\nwith the full assistance of Nintendo.\n\nL. Nintendo will, in the interests of expediency for this\n\nChristmas season, program 4 Atari titles of our\n\nchoice. Source and object code which meets our\n\nsatisfaction (with respect to basic design, tuning,\n\nand bug-free) to be delivered to us no later than\n\nSept. 1, 1983. The fee would be $100,000./title or\n\nno non-recurring engineering fees would be charged as\n\nlong as we buy a minimum of 100,000 carts.\n\nM. Carts would cost us 1,500 Yen/cart if in plastic but\n\nunlabeled or 1,350 Yen if not in plastic (F.O.B.\n\nJapan). Rate of production would be max. 5,000\n\nunits/week/title\n\nthe apocryphal story for why it was dropped was because Coleco showed a port of Donkey Kong running on the Coleco Adam at the Summer CES event in 1983, despite Atari having sole rights to porting Nintendo's arcade games on home computers at the time.\n\nhowever the letter is dated June 14th, almost a week after that convention.\n\na prototype of Joust made during this period is in the hands of the Video Game History Foundation, though it's never been publicly shared for legal reasons.\n\nanother interesting fact worth bringing up is that Defender II has music composed by Yukio Kaneoka, which is relevant because the various original jingles used for it would later go on to appear in the Punch-Out arcade game. (an in turn the later NES installment)"
