        "text": "From: KIM::FXL 30-JAN-1984 02:01\n\nTo: @SYS$MAIL:JUNK\n\nSubj: The first annual Jeff Boscole Memorial letter\n\nThis letter is dedicated to Jeff Boscole, someone who wasn't afraid of sounding obscure, to speak his mind, to be strange, to be brilliant, to play games, and to use MAIL to its fullest. I don't remember when he left, but it was quite a few months ago.\n\nTo anyone who cares, but especially to game designers with more clout than FXL, and to any and all people in power at Atari (not just coin-op):\n\nRecently I have spent an inordinate amount of time trying to instigate improvements in royalties, designer credits, and game testing procedures. I have had little success. I hereby apologize for all of the negative feelings and anger that I am emanating because of this. After all, things are pretty good here, and certainly better than at many companies. I do not however apologize or regret my negative feelings about the recent release of the Crystal Castles 2600 Cartridge. (In case you don't know, the cartridge was released without the approval of the coin-op design team, or anybody else in coin-op as far as I know).\n\nThis is pure theft!\n\nAnd I do not even know who to blame for this!! It isn't the programmer, who is about as mad (or worse) as I am about this situation. He was given a unmakeable release deadline (4 days instead of 3 weeks from when he was told). The game is much worse because of this (according to the programmer Peter Niday). He had no choice in the matter. Yet another unfinished, hurried, poorly tested game from Atari. Won't we ever learn?\n\nGames under license from other companies get reviewed by representatives of that company (Williams and Namco specifically). But games developed in-house are treated like they are in the public domain, while the original design team of in-house games is treated like dirt.\n\nThis is not an isolated incident either. Atarisoft, as a matter of policy, takes Atari Coin-op games, lets outside companies \"convert\" them for home computers (like Commodore 64, Vic-20, Apple 2, TI-99 and IBM-PC), and then produces them, all without the creative input or advice of the original design teams (just talk to Ed Logg about Centipede, or ? about Battlezone). Atarisoft does not ask anyone over here at coin-op for approval for the final version, but they do show the final version of the game to someone in the legal department. On the more positive side, there is a chance that Atarisoft will contribute to the Engineering Product Bonus Plan in a manner similar to 2600, 5200 and 800 products. Wouldn't it be nice to have that guaranteed and in writing? And shouldn't there be designer credits on Atarisoft products?\n\nIt's ironic that my name is on the packaging of the 2600 Crystal Castles cart, a product which I only saw an early version of. Yet when I told people that the message (\"programmed by Franz Lanzinger\") appeared in level 10 in the coin-op version I was told to take it out, or I loose an amount of bonus to be determined. Boy did that make me mad !!! I complained vocally, but only to be promised that a designer credit policy would be worked on. This policy is still \"being worked on\" eight months later. Now really. It's not that hard to do, just look at movies, books, not to mention Stern, Mylstar, Simutrek, Sente, even 2600 carts. If there were a policy right now, credits could be in in time for the Crystal Castles kits. As it is, I am still mad about the whole thing. Imagine Steven Spielberg directing a film, but not getting credit. How would he feel? Are we cogs in a machine? I am not a number !!! This isn't 1984!! (well OK, maybe it is).\n\nWhile I'm at it I would like to get one more thing off my chest (right on!!). You may know that the current \"coin-op engineering product bonus plan\" (shouldn't it really be called a royalty plan ?) is out of date. The most recent legally binding document (if it is legally binding) is dated March 26, 1982, and it expired at the end of 1983. It is my understanding by reading that memo that the bonus plan is still in effect, but it can now be \" extended, enhanced, discontinued or otherwise modified to meet management objectives \". In other words, Atari has the legal right to screw us any time they want. Personally, I would feel much more secure, happy, and motivated to work hard, if there were an updated royalty plan without a gaping loophole like that. After all, there are plenty of precedents for people getting screwed here.\n\nI am tired of fighting a brick wall. So I will resign myself to the facts of life at Atari. These facts seem to be that change is virtually impossible when suggested by a single employee, but mind-bogglingly fast if management wants it. And I will continue to feel bitter now and then (like right now for instance).\n\nHow do you feel about all this? How do you feel about 40% 30% 30% (the \"golden handcuffs\")? How do you feel about 1% under 10M, 2% over 10M? How do you feel about designer credits? How do you feel about the delays in actual payment of royalties? (I still don't have a cent for Crystal Castles, and it has been seven months since it started to earn millions for Atari).\n\nWhat can you, anyone who cares, do to make me, Joe Piscopo (oops, make that Franz Lanzinger) feel less bitter? Well, misery loves company. Please tell me, better yet, tell your favorite manager, supervisor, or even CEO, how you feel about these issues. It may not change a thing, but maybe your powers of persuasion will succeed where mine failed.\n\nUntil next year, (when I will write the second annual Jeff Boscole memorial letter)\n\nFXL\n\n(the X stands for \"eX trouble maker\")\n\nP.S. please send your answers to @SYS$MAIL:JUNK, or to someone in a position to take action, best would be both.\n\nP.P.S. If there are any inaccuracies, please let me know. The facts are to the best of my recollection, some of it is hearsay.\n\nFrom: KIM::DOWNEND 1-FEB-1984 17:22\n\nTo: @SYS$MAIL:ENGINEER.UAF\n\nto: Franz\n\nfrom: Chris Downend\n\nSubject: Response to Boscole Memorial Letter\n\nFirst of all, rest assured the issues you mention ARE being worked on - they are constant topics at meetings I attend. Everybody seems to be involved in making decisions these days. This ensures all viewpoints are heard but with a horrible speed penalty.\n\nThe solution is to keep plugging away and enlist support as you have! By the way Franz, you are certinly a valued employee with clout - one thing Atari undeniably values is people that can produce successful products and you have certainly done that with Crystal Castles.\n\nI have unique perspective on the situation since I have programmed games at the \"bottom\" and at the same time I have seen the decision-making process at the \"top\" - I can empathize with both sides.\n\nOne word of caution though, I note that you suggest dialogue thru VAX and the \"Junk\" heading which routes the text to everybody on the VAX including employees who do not share in the Product Bonus (royalty) and they just might not appreciate hearing about our lofty concerns about credits and amounts of bonus since they get neither. May I suggest the @sys$mail:engineer.uaf heading or a similar restricted audience. Management must be sensitive to the feelings and desires of many diverse groups inside Engineering and this complicates and lengthens the decision-making process. A snap decision to address the issue bothering one party may upset another party - management has to consider the whole picture sometimes.\n\nOn Royalties: Yep, Atari can screw us anytime they want. I do not think they would for fear of a lot of people leaving. The Company has to protect itself. Please realize that thru much of 1983, Atari paid bonuses even though Coin-op was not making money - we were operating in the RED and still paying bonuses ! Now that's commitment. Of course that cannot go on for too long or else the whole Company goes down. That's the reason Atari has escape valves built in to Bonus plans - it's not really too screw the employee, but instead to protect the well-being of the Company. That's the price you pay for the luxury of a steady salary and a ready-made work environment including PEOPLE and technical support. Personally, I have not been screwed, and in fact I have found that Atari has handsomely rewarded hard work and a willingness to support the Company. Maybe my expectations are lower than those who feel screwed - or maybe they valued themselves more than they were really worth. Management does care and Changes are in the works, they just take a long time especially when the players keep changing( J. Ray becomes Director, then Calfee leaves, then Farrand leaves etc. - you have to keep re-educating the new players). Changes ARE underway (no promises, but people want to fix these things if possible):\n\n-get rid of golden handcuffs\n\n-generate an advance close to initial production\n\nAs for the \"millions\" Atari made on Crystal Castles, well lets see:\n\nsales as of 1/13/84: 4363 uprts; 450 cocktails\n\nsales revenue (approx): $2095*4363 + 1695*500 = $9.98M\n\n[price was reduced in DEC(?) to $1000(?)]\n\ncost of goods sold (fully burdened):$971*4363+971*500=$4.73M\n\nEngineering Expense for Crystal Castles: about $1M\n\nEngineering Expense for games that don't make it: unknown\n\nSales/Marketing Expense: unknown\n\nEngineering Bonus expense:(.015*9.98M)=.15M\n\nPre-tax Income: 9.98-(4.73+1+.15)= $4.1M\n\nAfter taxes (50%): $2.05M"
