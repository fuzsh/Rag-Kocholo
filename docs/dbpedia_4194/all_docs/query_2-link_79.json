        "text": "THANK YOU FOR YOUR ORDER!\n\nYou should receive an email confirmation from sales@videogameheaven.com confirming your order. If not, please check your spam/junk folders and be sure to add videogameheaven.com to your Safe Senders List.\n\nIF YOU SELECTED IN-STORE PICKUP:\n\n1. Allow us up to 4 days to get you order transported to the store. You can visit our FAQs here for more info on what day it should be ready. You will also need to wait for a confirmation email titled “[Video Game Heaven]: Your order is ready for pickup!” before heading to the store.\n\n2. Once you receive confirmation, you must provide a copy of the order (printed or on your mobile device) when picking up. If you wish to have someone else pick it up, then you just have to give them a copy of the confirmation email.\n\nIF YOU PRE-ORDERED A GAME TITLE:\n\n1. All games will be available for pickup on their respective release date. If you selected shipping, then please allow 2 to 8 business after the release date for delivery. If the item’s release date is changed for any reason, then you will be notified by email. Release date changes are globally or regionally impacted and are of no fault of Video Game Heaven & Cool Stuff.\n\n2. You will receive an automated email notifying you that your game is available on the release date. This means you may proceed to your selected store location to pick it up during normal business hours. If the game is being shipped, then this is NOT a confirmation of it being shipped. You will receive a separate email indicating shipment along with tracking info.\n\nIF YOU PRE-ORDERED A COLLECTIBLE:\n\n1. Collectibles rarely have definitive release/availability dates. As a result we sometimes give general ideas when they should be available, but this is common to change especially do to supply chain and distribution issues since the start of the pandemic. Once your pre-order arrives at our warehouse you will be notified.\n\n2. If you selected store pickup, then you’ll receive an email (and eventually phone after some time) that it is waiting. If it was shipped, then you will receive an email including tracking details.\n\n3. If you need to update the pickup location or shipping address, then reply to the order confirmation email or send us the details at sales@videogameheaven.com referencing your order number.\n\nIF ONLY PAID A DEPOSIT:\n\nThe remaining amount is only due once we have received your pre-order. At that point you will be sent a payment reminder email that contains a link to submit payment."
