        "text": "In the early days of Atari's 8-bit machines, Atari treated their inner workings as trade secrets, in particular their custom graphics and sound chips. Third-party developers could only receive technical documentation on those secrets if they signed a nondisclosure agreement. (Ted Nelson complained bitterly about this situation in his introduction to The Creative Atari.)\n\nSomething changed at Atari, though, and the company shifted course. In 1981, several Atari employees began publishing articles in the computing press on the Atari's internals: player-missile graphics, display lists, sound, and more. These articles started in January 1981 (in BYTE and Compute!, which you linked to above) and continued into the next year.\n\nIn 1982, this information was collected and published in a single book, De Re Atari, which—for Atari enthusiasts and professionals—quickly developed a reputation as the Bible for the Atari. It was one of biggest sellers for the Atari Program Exchange.\n\nAs blogger Atari_Ace points out, it's not that player-missile graphics et al. were unknown by third-party developers before this information was published. No doubt some reverse-engineered the secrets on their own, or had access to the knowledge via those who worked for the right companies. But the revelations of the De Re Atari authors formally introduced the technology to the computing public.\n\nStrangely enough, Atari later became known as one of the more open companies in the emerging microcomputer market. The Atari BASIC Source Book includes the complete source code for Atari's BASIC cartridge as well as a detailed explanation of its workings. Ian Chadwick in his Mapping the Atari thanks the company for its \"'open system' policy.\" Make of that what you will.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, many popular personal computers were a cross between a video game console and a practical computing device. Manufacturers generally tried to focus their advertising on the latter aspect of their machine. Even though the quality of video games for a console would be a major factor in consumers' product choices, it's important to recognize that to a much greater extent than today, computers were often purchased by parents largely for the use of their children.\n\nIf advertisements for computer #1 were to cite its ability to play great video games, but those for computer #2 were to advertise practical computing features, many parents would have insisted on buying computer #2 regardless of the child's preferences. If, however, both computers advertised practical computing features, then parents would be more likely to ask their child which machine to buy. If the games that were available for computer #1 were vastly superior to those for computer #2, the children would likely be aware of this whether or not the computer manufacturer mentioned it in their advertising."
