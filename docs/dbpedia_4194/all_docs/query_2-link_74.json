        "text": "The hits just keep on coming: Atari today announced the Atari 2600+, a retro video game console that looks just like the original VCS and will play 2600 and 7800 cartridges.\n\n“Enjoy your favorite Atari 2600 and 7800 games on one system!” the product page explains. “Not only does the Atari 2600+ pull double cartridge duty, it also features HDMI and widescreen mode for easy connectivity to modern TVs. Jump right in with the included CX40+ Joystick and a 10-in-1 game cartridge that features some of Atari’s most famous games like Adventure, Missile Command, and Yars’ Revenge.”\n\nAccording to the firm—which has had many problems selling its retro-inspired New VCS console, the 2600+ is an updated version of the iconic Atari VCS that plays “most” legacy Atari 2600 and 7800 game cartridges—you can find the compatibility list here—offers modern HDMI video-out with widescreen support and an included cable, and a light-up Atari logo. It’s powered by a Rockchip 3128 SOC microprocessor with 256 MB of DDR3 RAM and 256 MB of eMMC fixed internal storage. Power comes via a bundled USB-C cable.\n\nThe CX40+ Joystick is wired via a serial port (not USB?) and has been “lovingly recreated to the same specifications as the original.” And that 10-in-1 game cartridge also Combat, Dodge ‘Em, Haunted House, Maze Craze, RealSports Volleyball, Surround, and Video Pinball in addition to the three titles noted above.\n\nThe Atari 2600+ is available for preorder now for $129.99, and Atari says that it will ship in November 2023 in the U.S. only. And international retailer list is “coming soon.”"
