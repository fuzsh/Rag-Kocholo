        "text": "All of our systems are graded based on cosmetic condition, relative to how they came from the factory. Pluses and minuses may be assigned when a system is slightly better or slightly worse than the three grades we offer.\n\nThe grades are as follows:\n\nGrade 1: System is as new, with no more than one or two minor blemishes in places not visible when placed in the traditional position a desk. Yellowing must be non-existent or barely observable. Cases have no cracks, no nicks, and no deep scratches. All chips are original or OEM replacements. System will be fully operational. For software, all manuals and disks are present and the case has very little sign of age, wear, or use.\n\nGrade 2: System is very presentable, with few blemishes in areas visible when placed in the traditional position a desk. There may be some level of yellowing but not to the extreme. Cases have no cracks. Cases may have some minor scuffs or light scratches in visible areas. Cases may have nicks or dents in places not apparent when looking at the unit from the traditional operating position. White keys may have some yellowing. Chips may be original, OEM replacements, or third-party reproductions (ex: ArmSID or SwinSID replacements for SID chips). System will perform all key functions normally, except where third party reproduction chips may alter functionality slightly (for example replacement SID chips may sound slightly different than original chips). For software, check the item description to determine if manuals and disks are included. The packaging will be very nice, with some signs of age (rubbed spots, slight creases or tears, some fading).\n\nGrade 3: System may have cracks on the case, significant blemishes in visible areas, missing trim pieces that do not affect proper operation, or significant yellowing. White keys are probably fairly yellow. These systems are discounted significantly and intended for people who want a system but don't care that it doesn't look great on a desk, or would like to do a more extreme restoration on their own (ex: painting cases). Chips may be original, OEM replacements, or third-party reproductions (ex: ArmSID or SwinSID replacements for SID chips). System will be fully operational, except where third party reproduction chips may alter functionality slightly. For software, check the item description to determine if manuals and disks are included. The packaging will have significant signs of age or abuse (many rubbed spots, creases, tears, or heavy fading).\n\nNOTE: If you order a Condition 3 unit, please keep an eye out for an email from us confirming that you intended to do that. We won't ship until you confirm you wanted a Condition 3 and it wasn't just a mistake of picking the lowest cost option in the store! Hope you understand."
