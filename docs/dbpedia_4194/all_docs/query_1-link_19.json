        "text": "I found there only will be 10 copies of Failsafe at the Atariage Booth for the Classic Gaming Expo. This isn't a lot of copies failsafe left at the Atariage store. I don't know when the shipment comes in after the Failsafe becomes out of stock. All I know about Failsafe for sure is there\n\nThe last I heard, A long time abandoned homebrew game Froggie will be worked by the original author. Froggie actually is the arcade game Frogger. The game originally got started in May of 2005 The game was almost completed in early January 2007, when things happened in the author's life outside of the internet. the catch is Froggie was designed with the xboard in mind. Xboard wasn't that popular in the Atari 7800 community and no games were completed for it. That board was supposed to have more ram and a Atari 5200 sound chip. The catch with that was that board was the fact it would make changes to the originally Atari 7800 motherboard including 128k ram and a sound chip used on Atari 5200/Atari 8 bit computers and it was a royal pain to install to my understanding.\n\nThe good news is the game would be able to work on the Atari 7800 Expansion Module. Xboard and the Expansion are two different animals. The Atari 7800 Expansion module wouldn't the issues like the Xboard did and it actually has additional stuff that makes it easier for people to program for the Atari 7800 besides memory, I don't know when Froggie will get released and it shouldn't be asked about any updates on it due to the history of the game not being worked on.\n\nThere is a newer version of Pac-Man Collection being worked. It will have the same chip as an Atari 5200/ Atari 8bit computer does. Other improvements includes 11 more random mazes based on the NES Tengen Ms. Pac-Man, improved Pac-man shap, and more arcade accurate AI. It sounds like it is going to be an Atari 7800 expansion module game.\n\nArkanoid isn't going to be worked anytime soon. The author get married earlier this year to my understanding, and I am pretty sure the author is busy as a result.\n\nI don't know the update status on Frenzy. What I know is the author of Frenzy also helped working an updated version Pac-man Collection and will be moving in a matter of months to another state. I don't know when the person will be working on for games and the amount of time for show to program a game after moving. I don't if the Author is working on Frenzy. The person has been working at least a couple Atari 7800 homebrew games.\n\nThe first picture of the 7800 expansion module created by Curt Vendel and others is now up. The picture has a 3d drawing.\n\nPicture found: http://www.atariage.com/forums/topic/165886-7800-piggyback-ex...\n\nThere is no table when the expansion module will be completed at this time and the price isn't know yet. There is a good number of games that aren't know yet for the module before July 31st.\n\nThe first prototype of the Harmony 2 Cart is now up: Found: http://www.atariage.com/forums/topic/165892-h2/\n\nHarmony 2 Cart is a Flash cartridge that has a SD Interface. A person is would be able to download Atari 2600 and Atari 7800 games by using a SD card. Once the SD card is in the SD slot Harmony 2 cartridge, a person is able to put Harmony 2 Cart into the 7800/ expansion module slot and play games that the person downloaded. The other thing is a Harmony Cart 2 software will need to updated time to time for playing future games, support for different controllers and make games that didn't work before on a Harmony 2 cart work.\n\nThere is some things that are unknown about the Harmony Cart 2 at this time. The Original harmony Cart for the 2600 could handle that is up to 32GB in Memory. I don't know if that is the case with Harmony Cart 2. Harmony Cart 2 is supposed to different than the original since the 7800 is more advance than the Atari 2600 is.\n\nThe price of the Harmony Cart 2 is unknown right now except for the fact it is supposed to cheaper than a Cuttle Cart 2. A Cuttle Cart 2 during its production run from 2004/2005 to 2007/2008 was anywhere from $250 to $175.00 if I remembered right.\n\nI don't known when Harmony Cart 2 will be released since a timetable hasn't been set yet. There should more info on when a Harmony Cart 2 is completed or close to it.\n\nIt is announced that the Atari 7800 will be having 2 different expansion modules and their product names.\n\nThe first expansion module is now called 7800 High Score Module. product number: CX-78HSM. The module only has the the features of the High Score Cartridge in the expansion module plastics. It will cost $59.99\n\nThe 2nd Expansion module is now called 7800 Expansion Module product number: CX-78XM1 This module will have High Score/Expanded RAM/Pokey Audio/ Yamaha Audio/ I/O Expansion Ports. It was called Atari 7800 XM at CGE 2010. Price will be anywhere from $89 to $99.\n\nSource: http://www.atariage.com/forums/topic/167879-expansion-modules...\n\nI could answer what I/O expansion ports. for the Atari 7800 Expansion module is for. The ports could be used a keyboard. The Atari 7800 was supposed to have a Keyboard as an accessory back in 1984. The 1984 models of the Atari 7800 had I/O expansion ports that were sold in test market areas in 1984 and the remaining Atari 7800 setting in the warehouse until 1986. The Keyboard accessory wasn't released because Jack Tramiel bought part of Atari from Warner. Jack got the computer/home game console department of Atari. Jack was worried about costs and had no plans of releasing the keyboard and the future 7800 models didn't have a I/O expansion port as a result.\n\nTurbo+Genesis+64 wrote:\n\nThanks again for this wealth of infromation. Is there any chance the CX-78XM1 will be sold at the Atari Age store? So this little puppy (with new games too) will be ready in the Fall?!\n\nWhat I know is there is supposed to be a pre order page soon according to the creator of the CX-78xM1, Cyrt Vendel.\n\nI think Atariage will have it. I think the CX-78xM1 might be ready for late fall/early winter. It is up to when the negotiations are done with with the plastic company for when the CX-78XM1 is ready to be released.\n\nCurt Vendel is negotiating with the plastics company. The plastics company according to Curt said it'll be 45-50 days for the tooling to be made and 10 days to run the first run of plastics. Curt wants to set things up with the plastic on Sept. 15 for a Nov. 15th shipping date.\n\nI will not be able to give anymore 7800 info here after tonight up to a couple weeks due to me not having internet access for 10 days at least.\n\nI found out that it appears like Atariage store will not be having the expansion module since they weren't contacted by Curt Vendel. It appears the website to buy the Expansion Module from will be from Legacy Engineering Group once the system is done.\n\nI believe Atarige store will have the expansion module games though. Legacy Engineering Group isn't into selling game cartridges. There are more into video game hardware/accessories. The closest thing to selling video game cartridges Legacy Engineering Group did was developing the plug and play Atari Flashback 2.0. system.\n\nI goes down to the fact Curt Vendel has done products for Atari computer/game consoles in the past, and Atariage store never was contacted to sell those products. The owner of Atariage has no problem with it.\n\nI believe Curt Vendel is the owner of Legacy Engineering group and that makes sense for Atariage store not selling the module. Curt is respected through the Atariage community in the past and there shouldn't any concerns about where the module will be sold as a result.\n\nLegacy Engineering Group site is http://www.legacyengineer.com/"
