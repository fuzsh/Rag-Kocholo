        "text": "Founded in Literacy\n\nIn search of an answer, Bob Lemire took his son to his friend, Dr. Edwin Cole—noted neurologist and head of the Reading Clinic at the Massachusetts General Hospital as well as the founder of several schools for students with dyslexia. He had been a long-time colleague of Dr. Samuel T. Orton and Anna Gillingham, principal creators of the respected reading system that carries their name.\n\nAfter testing, his son was diagnosed as developmentally dyslexic and received one-on-one tutoring. Moved by his son’s success in overcoming his reading difficulties, Lemire realized many other children had reading difficulties and most of them did not have the same resources and guidance as his family. Lemire and Dr. Cole began to discuss the issue with neighbor Dr. Littleton Meeks, an expert in technology. Despite the fact that computers were still in their infancy, the three decided to create a company that would use computer technology to help students receive the explicit, systematic, and personalized instruction they needed to become successful readers and confident learners. This was the beginning of our commitment to the science of reading and Structured Literacy-based literacy solutions.\n\nToday, Lexia serves more than 6.7 million students and 360,000 across more than 23,000 schools nationwide. We continue to lead our field in developing innovative science of reading-based approaches to literacy’s biggest challenges, and are committed to leading the change that education needs."
