        "text": "Post by TrekMD on\n\nI am not sure if I have mentioned the XM here but I thought I'd share information about it. Full details and progress with the project can be found here. Essentially it is a module that is attached to the cartridge port of any 7800 console and which includes a POKEY chip, a Yamaha chip, additional RAM, and ports for a keyboard. This allows for enhanced games to be made for the system. The specs are based on the original module Atari intended to release for the system. If you are wondering why this is being done it is because certain 7800 games had additional hardware in the carts (extra RAM or a POKEY chip, for example) which added to the cost of the games. By having this module, the need for having carts with additional hardware is negated as all the extra hardware is in the eXpansion Module itself. Game developers just need to access it through the XM to make exhanced games. Several games are in development already!\n\nPost by TrekMD on\n\nAn updated was posted yesterday regarding the XM:\n\nNOV 29th - Design is locked down. No further changes, or modifications whatsoever. With the holidays coming, I will begin to order in the new boards. Mark and I will implement the firmware and after the New Year I will prepare the workshop for assembly, and begin to build out the XM's to begin shipping January 30th. So this is it, no more changes, no more attempts at further compatibility with any further games, the design is locked down and now its time to get past the holiday madness and focus on preparing to build XM's. I should be able to do 5-6 daily and get them out to first ordered first and go through the list. I will email people in batches to verify addresses, if I don't get a reply back, they get bumped to the next batch and if I still don't hear I'll keep bumping them until I'm at the end of the list and if I have to start making phone calls or posting on Atariage asking if anyone has heard from such and such a person, I will but I'm not holding anything up any further, time to move forward, everyone has waited long enough and too much time has been invested into this project.\n\nSo, now we have a shipping date! Looking forward to it!"
