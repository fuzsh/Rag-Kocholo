        "text": "29th January 2024: PLAION, a global leading publisher and developer of video games, and Atari, one of the world’s most iconic consumer brands and interactive entertainment producers, are pleased to announce that three iconic games originally produced for the Atari 7800 will be re-released on 24th May 2024. The games include Fatal Run, Food Fight and Ninja Golf, and will be released individually in new cartridges. Each game is compatible with the legacy Atari 7800 console, and the recently released Atari 2600+ console.\n\nFatal Run - In this post-apocalyptic racing game you must travel to various towns delivering medicine, while on your way to a missile base which houses a rocket that can save the world. This classic title represents the popularity of post-apocalyptic themes from when it was originally released in 1990, themes that are still prevalent today.\n\nFood Fight - You play as Charley trying to eat an ice cream cone. But first you must avoid the chefs that are out to get you: Angelo, Zorba, Oscar, and Jacques. Avoid the food thrown at you by the chefs to get the cone. You can also throw your own food at the chefs to slow them down. This much loved title has endured as a classic in retro gaming circles, and is often praised for its fast paced and straightforward gameplay.\n\nNinja Golf - The Ultimate Ninja and sporting challenge, a game of golf and fierce Ninja battle. Swing and kick away at Ninjas, duck whipping stars, pick up treasure and shoot for birdies, it's all part of a day's fun. This unconventional combination of ninja combat and golf mechanics has helped Ninja Golf stand out as one of the most unusual games for Atari consoles.\n\nDistributed worldwide, the games will be available to pre-order from 29th January 2024, priced at £24.99 (€29.99/AU$44.99/$29.99) each.\n\nFor more information visit www.atari.com"
