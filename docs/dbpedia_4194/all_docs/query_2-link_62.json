        "text": "The RetroHQ Mega 7800 is a controller adapter which allows you to use your Master System and Mega Drive controllers with your Atari 7800 or 2600. This includes Master System control pads, joysticks and also the light phaser as well as 3 and 6 button Mega Drive pads and sticks.\n\nIn normal operation the Mega 7800 lets you play 2 button 7800 and 2600 games with a more comfortable pad. In extended mode (where software has been written to take advantage of the Mega 7800) the 7800 is able to read all of the buttons available on the controller for additional gameplay control!*\n\nThe 7800 GameDrive in combination with the Mega 7800 uses the Mega Drive control pads to allow single button breaking into games (START), saving (Z) and loading (Y) of your games. This allows for the full retro gaming experience with the added comforts of an emulator! Truely the best of both worlds.\n\n* Extended operation is currently only supported on the 7800, but should be possible to access from 2600 homebrew also.\n\nHardware Compatibility\n\nAtari 7800 and 2600, NTSC and PAL\n\nMaster System control pads and sticks\n\nMaster System light phaser\n\nMega Drive control pads and sticks\n\nWireless adapters such as the 8BitDo Retro Reciever for the MegaDrive\n\nSoftware Compatibility"
