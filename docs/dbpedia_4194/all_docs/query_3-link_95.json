        "text": "If you want a practical example, big box stores were among the first establishments to implement electronic sliding doors. The idea was that their patrons were making large purchases (appliances, lawn mowers, home repair and building materials), and they would have their hands full leaving the store. While this architectural feature was designed for this purpose, it also benefits those who may be pushing a stroller, using a wheelchair, holding hands with little ones, and those who may wish to avoid touching door handles during cold and flu season.\n\nUniversal Design is all around us. It makes sure that products and environments are usable to all people, by design. In this podcast episode, we take a look at the origin of universal design and how the principles have evolved from beginnings in the built environment to all parts of society. We’ll be hearing from different perspectives how inclusivity by design can be applied in different settings, both physical and digital.\n\nPhysical access to classrooms and other educational facilities was an important first step toward accessibility within the educational process. Many schools began to embrace the philosophy of inclusion by physically including students with disabilities in the classroom. However, this did not ensure equal access to the general curriculum or opportunities for students with disabilities to benefit from what the school curriculum offered.\n\nUniversal Design for Learning (UDL) began in 1984 when Dr. David Rose and Dr. Anne Meyer, two researchers from the Harvard School of Graduate Education, incorporated CAST, Inc., The Center for Applied Specialized Technology. The goal of CAST was to revolutionize the way that students with special needs were taught by introducing technology that would allow teachers and learners to customize their learning experiences. By 1990, this goal evolved to address the “disabilities of schools” instead of the “disabilities of the individual”. This change mirrored what was happening in architecture, with buildings designed so that all people could access them regardless of their disabilities."
