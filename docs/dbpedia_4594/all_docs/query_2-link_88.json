        "text": "The Cast: Season Two\n\nIntroducing the actors who bring American Family\n\nto life.\n\nEDWARD JAMES OLMOS (Jess Gonzalez)\n\nEdward James Olmos portrays Jess Gonzalez, a Korean war veteran and conservative patriarch of the Gonzalez family.\n\nLike his on-screen character, actor, producer, director and community activist Olmos was born and raised in East Los Angeles. He has appeared in numerous stage, television and feature film roles, and is perhaps most recognized for his portrayal of dedicated, real-life math teacher Jaime Escalante in \"Stand and Deliver,\" for which he earned an Academy Award nomination.\n\nOther film credits include \"Wolfen,\" \"The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez,\" \"Blade Runner,\" and perhaps one of his most memorable roles ever, portraying Abraham Quintanilla - the strong, supportive father of singing star Selena - in the hit biographical movie \"Selena.\" In 1992, Olmos made his directorial debut with the powerful feature film \"American Me,\" in which he also starred. His first collaboration with AMERICAN FAMILY - JOURNEY OF DREAMS creator Gregory Nava was the landmark Latino-American drama \"My Family/Mi Familia,\" in which he starred with Jimmy Smits and Esai Morales. Among his many other films are \"Triumph of the Spirit,\" \"Talent for the Game,\" \"Caught\" and \"The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit,\" based on a Ray Bradbury story.\n\nOlmos' television credits include a five-year stint as Lieutenant Martin Castillo on the hit series \"Miami Vice,\" which garnered the actor an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award. He also was honored with a Golden Globe Award and Emmy Award nomination for his work in the 1994 HBO production \"The Burning Season,\" the story of Brazilian political activist Chico Mendes. Olmos also portrayed Jose Menendez, the slain father of Kyle and Erik Menendez in the CBS miniseries \"Menendez: A Murder in Beverly Hills,\" and starred in Showtime's \"Twelve Angry Men,\" which featured an all-star cast including George C.

His birthdate is Feb. 24.\n\nCONSTANCE MARIE (Nina Gonzalez)\n\nConstance Marie stars as Nina Gonzalez, the beautiful and career-minded daughter often at odds with her father Jess Gonzalez.\n\nMarie's career began when she was a teenager, dancing as part of Los Angeles' underground break-dancing scene. She was selected as one of 500 hopefuls to dance on tour with David Bowie, which led to a role in the movie \"Salsa.\" Impressed by her performance, the film's choreographer, Steve Tisch, offered Marie her very first acting job, a starring role as Penny on the CBS series \"Dirty Dancing.\"\n\nIt wasn't long before Marie was working in feature films. She starred as Toni Sanchez in the New Line film \"My Family/Mi Familia,\" directed by AMERICAN FAMILY - JOURNEY OF DREAMS creator Gregory Nava, with whom Marie has worked numerous times. Working with Nava yet again, Marie garnered praise for her portrayal of Marcella Quintanilla, the mother of Tejano music legend Selena Quintanilla in the blockbuster film \"Selena.\" Only a year older than her onscreen daughter, Marie had to undergo four hours of extensive make-up in order to portray Selena's mother. Additional film credits include the role of Yolanda, the daughter of AMERICAN FAMILY - JOURNEY OF DREAMS co-star Raquel Welch, in the celebrated film \"Tortilla Soup,\" which received a 2002 Alma Award nomination for Outstanding Motion Picture.\n\nIn addition to AMERICAN FAMILY - JOURNEY OF DREAMS, Marie currently also stars as Angie, the hard-working and devoted wife of George Lopez on the ABC family comedy \"The George Lopez Show.\" Marie also has appeared on television as Michael J. Fox's love interest Gabby on the hit series \"Spin City,\" and as Gabriella Diaz on \"Union Square,\" for which she received an Alma Award nomination for Outstanding Female Actress in a Comedy Series.\n\nAdditional television credits include the telefilm \"The Underworld,\" opposite Kevin Pollak, and appearances in \"Early Edition,\" \"Two Guys and a Girl,\" \"For Your Love\" and \"Ally McBeal,\" which brought Marie back to her dancing roots when she portrayed a salsa champion.

In addition to his recurring role on AMERICAN FAMILY - JOURNEY OF DREAMS, Morales has inked a development deal with ABC/Touchstone; starred this past summer in the critically acclaimed off Broadway play \"The Exonerated,\" directed by Bob Balaban; and recently finished filming a lead role in Cinematropical Pictures \"Isla Bella,\" directed by Martia Karrel.\n\nBorn to Puerto Rican parents in Brooklyn, New York, Morales ran away from home at the age of 13 because his mother did not approve of his desire to pursue acting. He attended New York's prestigious High School for the Performing Arts while living in a group home as a voluntary ward-of-the-state. Shortly after he finished his studies, Morales debuted on stage in \"El Hermano\" at the Ensemble Studio Theater, and Joe Papp's production of \"The Tempest\" with Raul Julia for New York's Shakespeare in the Park festival. Other theater performances include \"Tamer of Horses\" for the Los Angeles Theater Center, for which he was awarded the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award, and Oscar Wilde's \"Salome\" with Al Pacino at New York's Circle in the Square Theater on Broadway.\n\nMorales' film debut was opposite Sean Penn in the 1983 drama about youth violence, \"Bad Boys.\" His next major film role as 50s rock musician Richie Valen's half-brother Bob in the Luis Valdez directed film \"La Bamba\" (1987) caught the attention of the entertainment industry and stole the hearts of audiences. \"La Bamba\" remains the most commercially successful Latino-themed motion picture to date.\n\nAlways conscious of maintaining positive representation of Latinos in entertainment, Morales' portrayals of ordinary men struggling under extraordinary circumstances and conflicts always rise above convention. In \"Rapa Nui\" (produced by Kevin Costner), Morales is chosen to represent his servant class tribe to compete in a contest for control of the island. As an Amazonian rubber tapper, he risks his life in civil disobedience in the award-winning HBO film \"The Burning Season - The Chico Mendes Story\" (with Raul Julia).\n\nIn the Gregory Nava film \"My Family/Mi Familia,\" he joins an ensemble cast, which includes Jimmy Smits and Edward James Olmos, as a loving yet troubled son of a working class Mexican-American Family trying to achieve the American dream. And in \"The Disappearance of Garcia Lorca,\" Morales is a young journalist who returns to Spain in search of the truth behind the death of the famous Spanish poet/playwright.\n\nDescribing himself as an \"actorvist,\" Morales has combined art and activism to build bridges of understanding. In 1997 Morales co-founded the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts (NHFA), created to advance the presence and quality of Latinos in media, telecommunications and entertainment. He is a founding board member of ECO (Earth Communications Office), a global clearinghouse for environmental information. He's worked for the Wildlife Preservation Fund in Costa Rica and is active with \"alternative AIDS\" programs such as Alive and Well and H.E.A.L. (Health Education AIDS Liaison). In the late eighties, Morales used his heightened public profile to organize an Oscar night benefit for El Recate/The Rescue, a Central American refugee service agency. This contributed to the promotion of the concept of benefit events on the film industry's most important night of the year, which led to the current trend of Academy Award night benefits.\n\nMorales currently resides in Los Angeles.\n\nRAQUEL WELCH (Aunt Dora)\n\nRaquel Welch portrays Aunt Dora, Jess Gonzalez' eccentric sister.\n\nBorn Raquel Tejada in Chicago to a Bolivian father and American mother, Welch became an instant movie star when she burst onto movie screens in the science fiction classics \"Fantastic Voyage\" and \"One Million Years B.C.\" Then recognized as an international sex symbol, Welch went on to create memorable motion picture heroines in films such as \"The Three Musketeers,\" for which she won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress; \"100 Rifles;\" \"The Last of Sheila;\" \"Hannie Caulder\" and \"Mother, Jugs and Speed.\" She is perhaps best known to audiences for her dazzling performances as the roller derby queen in \"Kansas City Bomber,\" the seductress Lillian Lust in the original \"Bedazzled\" and the outrageous Myra in the cult classic \"Myra Breckenridge.\"\n\nMost recently, Welch appeared in MGM's blockbuster hit \"Legally Blonde\" with Reese Witherspoon, and with Hector Elizondo and AMERICAN FAMILY - JOURNEY OF DREAMS co-star Constance Marie in the critically acclaimed comedy \"Tortilla Soup.\"\n\nMost recognized as a film actress, Welch made a quantum leap on to the Broadway stage where she earned critical acclaim and standing ovations with her triumphant debut as star of the hit musical \"Woman Of The Year.\" She returned to Broadway again most recently in \"Victor/Victoria.\" In addition to the stage and big screen, Welch has achieved notable success in television, winning a Golden Globe nomination for her touching performance in NBC's \"A Right to Die,\" and the Nosotros Golden Eagle Award for \"The Legend of Walks Far Woman,\" also for NBC.

Through a series of chance events, he booked a lead role in the ABC after-school special, In the Shadow of Love: A teen AIDS story. The acting bug bit hard and within a year, Luis dropped out of music school and became one of the founding members of the critically acclaimed, Boston-based actors' company, The Harrison Project. After five years of theater and study, he made his move to L.A. Since then, Luis has appeared on The X-Files and Six Feet Under. Most recently, Luis guest-stars on The Shield as \"Otilio Ramirez.\" He plays the role of \"Ace\" in the yet-to-be-released, independent ensemble drama, Havoc, written and directed by Oscar winners, Stephen Gaghan and Barbara Kopple, respectively. Luis currently resides in L.A. with his faithful pit bull companion, Dexter Gordon. Yes, like the Jazz musician."
