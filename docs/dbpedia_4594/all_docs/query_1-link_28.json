        "text": "Gabriella Icely Merchandise Animated Series Gallery\n\nGo ahead, try and win me over.\n\nGabriella Icely is a 2021-introduced and all-around character. She is a student at Rainbow High that focuses in Fashion Technology/Design. We'd suggest you step aside if you see Gabriella coming down the hall. Not that she'll push you out of the way or anything, but she might have some words for you if she thinks you're standing in her way. Gabriella's not all ice though. She warms up over time, and has such a wicked sense of humor that she's the only person you want by your side. Gabriella comes from a long line of Alaskan bajillionaires, and the wealth is not wasted on her.\n\nLooks\n\nPhysical Appearance[]\n\nGabriella is a fair-skinned teenage girl with a medium build. She has ice hair styled into soft waves with a right side part, and she has pale blue eyes. Her makeup consists of an ice cut crease buffed out with a darker eyeshadow, topped with ice iridescent glitter. She wears shimmery nude pink lipstick. Her preferred style is very minimalistic and high-fashion, with details like snakeskin and silver accents.\n\nOutfits[]\n\nShe wears an ice knitted turtleneck long sleeve sweater, a metallic leather ice skirt with a silver charm belt with letter pendants that spell RAINBOW. For her shoes, she has silver and ice high heeled ankle boots printed with a snakeskin pattern. She also wears two silver safety pin barrettes but in her art it appears to be a normal barrette.\n\nGabriella's second outfit consists of an ice patterned ruched dress with strings of ribbon on the sides, a textured ice snakeskin moto jacket with leather and ribbon ties on both sleeves and ice strappy sandals with clear transparent heels. She accessorizes with a silver choker.\n\nPersonality\n\nGabriella is shown to be somewhat catty and attention seeking, which is best seen with her rivalry with Amaya Raine. In particular she is shown to want the approval of Jett Dawson and is very competitive. But, she seems nice to people she likes and are friends with them as is seen in \"Dance It Out\" with Nicole. However, she appears to be relatively intelligent, due to her love of technology and high patience, her knowledge has likely increased. During “Radiant Week”, this is shown frequently, as we see both Gabriella, along with Bella and Sheryl, assembling their final perspective piece. Her patience comes from likely being a perfectionist, and only caring about her piece looking nice. She doesn't appear to consider much about others' views on her; she likes to be unique with her ideas too.\n\nShe also had a romantic life, previously fondling over Hans Harvard, a handsome Alaskan bajillionare. However, this changed when she met Finn - who is shown to like her back. They almost had their first kiss in the episode Dance It Out, and since then they have been hanging out quite a bit showing romantic gestures to one another.\n\nEtymology\n\nGabriella[]\n\nGabriella is a rather common English and Italian girls' name that goes by many nicknames.\n\nIcely[]\n\nIcely, possibly taken from the given name Icelyn, is a surname made to reference Gabriella's icy color scheme.\n\nRelationships\n\nFriends[]\n\nStella Monroe, Daria Roselyn, Sheryl Meyer, Daphne Minton, and Georgia Bloom are her runway team members. It is assumed they are all friends but it is unknown currently.\n\nFrenemies[]\n\nEmi Vanda[]\n\nGabriella and Emi are shown to have conflict with each other as Emi first missed her cue at their runway project and replaced their couch with paper mache. Emi is shown to be the only one who's not under Gabriella's thumb. They are runway members but don't seem to be on good terms overall. In \"Roomie Drama! Featuring Gabriella and Emi!\" Violet got Emi on The Vi Life and Emi wrote a song for Gabriella with Daria, Gabriella thought her a lyrics were terrible but she didn't hate it and the girls made up.\n\nAmaya Raine[]\n\nGabriella is shown to have a negative relationship with Amaya, as she acts rather snarky and rude to her. In particular she is shown to mock Amaya for her once being on the waitlist for Rainbow High, only letting up once Jett shared that she was on the waitlist too. She is also shown to crave attention and admiration, being best seen by her competitive spirit and rivalry with Amaya. However, she also addresses Amaya's design as 'cool', in the season two episode: \"The Jett Dawson\".\n\nRomance[]\n\nFinn Rosado[]\n\nIn \"The Eclipse - Phase Two\", Finn and Gabriella hugged and Gabriella blushed when Finn waved at her. It is clear that they met at Pacific Coast High. Her roommate, and runway group member Sheryl, was apparently childhood friends with Finn; this could have encouraged Finn and Gabriella's friendship. In 'Dance it Out' they both danced together, and were very close to kissing. On different occasions during Rainbow Vision performances, they have been seen in the public hugging or holding hands.\n\nIn The Rainbow Union, she mentions that she loves Hans Harvard, a handsome, Alaskan bajillionare but she never mentioned him again after this point.\n\nOther[]\n\nJett Dawson[]\n\nGabriella, like most of the other students, has lots of admiration for Jett and her many fashion escapades; however her feelings are not very well reciprocated. Jett is shown to like Gabriella's outfits and designs, but is also shown to be upset with her mocking Amaya.\n\nTimeline\n\nJuly 16th, 2021: Gabriella was mentioned on the first Season 2 episode while Sheryl Meyer is talking about her to Bella Parker.\n\nJuly 18th, 2021: Gabriella's box with her doll inside was leaked, revealing her name on the packaging.\n\nJuly 22nd 2021: Gabriella's official stock photo was leaked with the rest of Series 3.\n\nAugust 13th, 2021: Gabriella makes her animated series debut, having a major role.\n\nDecember 3rd, 2022: A picture of her and Emi ‘s budget dolls are revealed.\n\nTrivia\n\nGabriella is one of the few characters (with Colin being this to Jade) to be introduced as a rival, in her case a rival to Amaya.\n\nDespite having a much lighter more silvery tone in her promotional artwork, her color scheme is much brighter in the animated series.\n\nGabriella is amazing with computers, kicking out Shadow High from the broadcast of Rainbow Vision TV.\n\nSome of the real-world inspirations for Gabriella's outfits include:\n\nGabriella's first outfit is inspired by Versace 90's supermodels.\n\nGabriella's sweater is inspired by Versace Cable Knit Sweater.\n\nGabriella's charm belt is inspired by Chanel Letter Charm belt.\n\nGabriella's dress is inspired by Fendi Logo Dress.\n\nGabriella's second pair of heels are inspired by Miu Miu Embellished Heel Sandal.\n\nReferences"
