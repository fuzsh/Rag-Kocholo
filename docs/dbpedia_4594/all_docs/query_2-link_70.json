        "text": "From the 1st April Meeting:\n\n\"Life at Ukulele Bedford Online is getting complicated, so this week’s mailing is having to serve a few purposes: an update on last Wednesday’s session, a request for you to add your song suggestions for this coming Wednesday to a Google Doc, and an invitation to this Wednesday’s brand new Open Mic Online session (doors open at 6:45pm for the performers’ sound check, with a 7pm start).\n\nOK, so now that you know what’s coming – here’s the update from last Wednesday… At last Wednesday’s Ukulele Bedford Online session we had 23 April fools, including a few welcome faces that we haven’t seen for a while. We never name and shame folks for not joining us, but it was great to see Graham, Cath, Ron and Ronald again. Although similar in number to the previous week, we had quite a few people that were trying Zoom for the first time. It’s great that the technology is enabling us to continue playing virtually together until we’re able to play together again in reality at the Kings Arms.\n\nInspired by Graham and Cath’s return, we started us in the Gig Book (2018 Beer Festival Corrected) with Whiskey in the Jar followed by Half the World Away. Then we switched over to Brung Strum 4 for Blame It On Me, and then into the Bumper Book for The Devil and The Deep Blue Sea, Act Naturally and Folsom Prison Blues. I had failed to keep an eye on the time, so we took our break a bit later than advertised at around 8:07pm (British Summer Time). We started up again at 8:20pm having emptied, filled and cleaned our glasses. We began Part Two with Friday I’m in Love, from the Gig Book, before returning to the Bumper Book for Daydream and Ghost Riders in the Sky (which is a song in danger of becoming popular). Then I think we may have switched back to the Gig Book for Leaving on a Jet Plane and Sunny Afternoon, before concluding our entertainment with Sway. All in all, a good evening’s playing was had by everyone. A big ‘shout out’ goes to those of you who suggested songs and those of you that lead songs – it was really great to hear a few new people leading songs and it is trend that I hope we will continue.\n\nSuper, moving on to this coming Wednesday – let’s try a Google Doc for your song suggestions…\n\nIt’s fair to say that I struggled a bit making myself heard between songs last week, so in a rather brilliant brainwave that I’ll attribute to Jon, please can I ask you to put your song suggestions into the following Google Doc, so that we don’t have so much faffing between songs this week? It is pretty easy to use – just click on the following link to open the document in your web browser, and then type the name of the song book, the page number and title of the song you want us to play. If you’d like to offer to lead us through your song, please add your name.\n\nhttp://bit.ly/ub-song-suggestions\n\nBrilliant, and finally Open Mic – we need you, as performers and appreciative audience members…\n\nThis Wednesday (April 8th), we were due to have an Open Mic session from 7pm to 7:30pm at the Kings Arms. I’ve checked with David and Jon and with some trepidation we’ve decided to give it a try Zoom style – we just need a group of volunteers to perform. David will be compering the Open Mic session, so if you’d like a spot please either contact David directly or add your name to the Open Mic table in the above Google Doc. We’ll then start our (now regular) sing-along session at 7:30pm and run through to 8pm or so, before taking the obligatory break, and returning for Part Two around 8:15pm (and finishing at 9pm).\n\nOK, Super, Brilliant – in summary…\n\nThis coming Wednesday (9th April) the virtual doors will open at 6:45pm, in case you want to do a sound check, before David starts the Open Mic session at 7pm – if you don’t want to perform this week, please come for 7pm and support those who do. Unless we get any better offers, Jon and I will lead the sing-along session from 7:30pm. Please use the above Google Doc if you’d like to suggest a few songs for us to play or put your name down for an Open Mic spot. Getting songs and names in advance should make both sessions run smoother, so please give the above Google Doc a try. I warned you it was complicated, but strange times call for strange measures (imperial and metric). If any of you read this far, I hope to see you online on Wednesday; if I lost you on the way, just click on the links and see what happens. I hope you all have a good week.\n\nP.S. I believe the 40-minute limit for our Zoom call has been relaxed, so we’ll just have the one Zoom link this week (below). Apparently security is getting tighter at Zoom HQ, so don’t forget the password in case you’re asked for it on the door (it’s the first half of the name of our group in lower-case, but don’t tell anyone I told you).\n\nP.P.S. As I mentioned last week, some of you might find it easier with a headset if you have one, but no worries if you don’t. If you’re on a Windows computer (rather than a tablet) I’d suggest you open the Settings, navigate through to the ‘Audio’ tab and press the ‘Advanced’ button, then select the ‘Enable Original Sound’ checkbox. When enabled, this stops Zoom’s voice recognition algorithm from cutting out your Ukulele.\n\nBest Wishes, Trevor.\"\n\nFrom the 25th March Meeting:\n\n\"To the 22 of us that were able to join the Zoom meeting this week for our inaugural Ukulele Bedford Online session, I just wanted to say thanks for making it such a fun and entertaining evening. If you had any technology issues that prevented you from participating this time, please drop us an email and we’ll try to help where we can. I think there was a consensus that we might prefer the Kings Arms, but until that’s open again, it’s probably better than sitting at home on your own.\n\nI noticed that my own playing sounded so much better when my microphone was muted – at least that’s my story and I’m sticking to it. A big thank you to everyone that lead us through the songs – it was fantastic for me to be able to spread the pleasure and join in with you rather than lead every song. For those that didn’t attend it is fair to say that words can’t really do it justice – it was just great fun.\n\nSo down to the actual tunes – as advertised we stuck to the path of well-known songs from the Gig Book (2018 Beer Festival Corrected edition). My note making was not quite up to par, so the following songs may not have happened in this order, but I think most of them did happen at some point during the evening. We all got comfortable and kicked off at 7:30pm sharp with Eight Days a Week, followed (I think) by Things, King of the Road and San Francisco Bay Blues.\n\nThere must have been fair bit of time spent sorting out the plumbing as I think that’s all we managed in Part One, but true to form we did have our intermission and resumed at 8:15pm for Part Two. Not that I was counting (because unfortunately I wasn’t) but I think we managed seven songs in the second half – so clearly, we had cracked the technology. More importantly we spread the love and Jon, David and Lydia helped lead us through some of them.\n\nI have us kicking off with Exs and Ohs, then Only You, Urban Spaceman (featuring the virtual Kazoo), Ghost Riders in the Sky, Lola, Dreaming and finally (although maybe there was another one) Sunny Afternoon. Some of you may have felt that our timing was not perfect, or the odd note may have been slightly out of tune, but in my defence, I changed my strings last week and they’re still settling in – I’ll try and think of a new excuse for next week.\n\nTalking of which we hope that there will be a next week – I’ll send another email on Monday or Tuesday with a fresh set of Zoom meeting links. I’m not sure if you were asked for the password this week, but next week the bouncers might get stricter, so don’t forget the first name of our group (in lower case) and if you don’t get it right first time have a second guess.\n\nUntil then, I’m hoping Jon might suggest an online Ukulele Challenge to keep your idle hands busy while maintaining a safe social distance…\n\nHi - Jon here! Three things to do to strum the hours away.\n\nNumber one: It was good that different people took the lead in different songs last night. We could expand that. If you fancy it, pick one song from any book and practice it over the week and then volunteer to lead it next Wednesday.\n\nNumber two: Let's do the list thing - we can't just play the gig book for the next three months, so send Trevor or myself a list of five or so songs you'd like to play. Either on here or by email.\n\nNumber three: If you are a FB user you might like to try https://www.facebook.com/groups/yourukulelechallenge. I think the first 'challenge' is to show your equipment. (Ooo Err Missus, Fnarr Fnarr etc.) so not too taxing!\n\nWhile I am on, our Felmersham gig in July at The Sun has unsurpisingly been cancelled - it will be next year instead. Unless we get a plague of locusts of course.\n\nNow back to Trevor...\n\nWe hope to see you online next Wednesday (1 st April) – the virtual doors will open again at 7:20pm for a 7:30pm start (no fooling).\n\nTake care, Trevor & Jon\"\n\nFrom the 18th March Meeting:\n\n\"Would you believe it, we managed to muster eight determined players last night at the Kings Arms for our weekly dose of Ukulele Bedford. It may well have been foolish to go against the government’s advice and attempt a social gathering in a pub of all places, but a few of us felt it might be our last chance for a while and health risks aside, it was really rather pleasant. We stuck pretty much to two books – the Gig Book (2018 Beer Festival Corrected) and BrungStrum 5.3. It is fair to say that with limited numbers we defaulted back to the criteria of convenience and selected songs primarily by their close proximity to the one we’d just played, but nonetheless we managed a bumper crop of 27 tunes (matching our PB).\n\nThe merriment kicked off in the Gig Book with All My Loving, quickly followed by Love Potion Number Nine, YMCA, I’m A Believer, L.O.V.E, Please Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood, It’s My Party, and It Must Be Love. I didn’t notice it at the time, but love was clearly in the air – at least looking back now, that seems to be the theme so far. Having caught our breath, we continued on a slightly less love-struck path with Sway, Lightning Bolt, Sunny Afternoon, The Tide is High/Rudy, Shimmy Like My Sister Kate, Ghost Riders in the Sky, Lola and Dreaming. We even managed a bit of reggae off-beat strumming on The Tide is High/Rudy and a bit of additional little-finger action on the F chords of Dreaming (thanks to Jon).\n\nSuddenly it was 9pm and time for a commercial break. Fortunately, there was not much of a queue at the bar and we were all back in time for the second half, which was pretty much devoted to BrungStrum 5.3. We heralded our return with It’s Raining Men, which thanks to David’s perseverance is starting to sound a bit better. We moved along to Breakfast at Tiffany’s, Don’t Look Back in Anger, Dancing Queen, Do You Love Me, Galway Girl, Golden Brown (and yes we can still play in 13/8), I Will Survive, and Hey There Delilah. It was time for the last tune of the night, so we switched back to the Gig Book and finished at the City of New Orleans.\n\nIt may well have been our last physical meet-up for a little while (who knows what will get closed next) but rest assured although we may be socially distancing ourselves in the short term, we can all still play from the same songbook occasionally. On a semi-serious note, we do need some way of maintaining our sanity in these times of madness. Playing ukulele in good company seems to help, so I think I’ll continue playing our tunes each Wednesday evening from 7:30pm to 10pm with a break 9pm to refill my glass – maybe some of you might join me spiritually from the safety of your own homes. Until we can meet again in person, let’s keep in contact via the Facebook group and we’ll send out another email if and when we’re able to gather socially at the Kings Arms for some restorative ukulele playing.\n\nTake care\"\n\nFrom the 11th March Meeting:\n\n\"Twenty or so of us braved the possible exposure to 'Captain Trips' (Stephen King's name for a global pandemic in 'The Stand') to get our weekly musical ukulele fix and I am hoping it was the pub that was very warm last night and not something I am coming down with!\n\nTo continue with the coronavirus theme, Trevor, David and I have decided that as of now we should continue running the group every Wednesday evening. This virus could be with us for months, so we'd like to keep going as long as we can before we have to suspend things. We will review that on a week by week basis and take note of what is being advised by the health powers that be. Obviously, if you have symptoms please consider others and stay at home and as always you can attend as frequently or infrequently as you like - so not coming if you are worried or have an underlying health condition is fine as well. As of the time of writing there have been no confirmed cases in Bedfordshire. Apart from Nadine Dorries who is the Health Secretary. Is 'Ironic' in any of our songbooks? Nope.\n\nAnyway - on to the music that we DO have...\n\nWe started off in the gig book, with Oliver's Army, Space Oddity and Wagon Wheel - which all went fine. Mind you, we have been playing them for a good long time, so if we can't make a decent fist of those we really are in trouble! Brungstrum 1 followed, with Country Honk, Have I The Right, Material Girl, Mr Blue Sky, Walking on Sunshine and You Say you Don't Love Me. Of those, we managed to keep a (relatively!) constant pace through Mr Blue Sky, but keeping together through the fast strumming in 16ths of Walking on Sunshine proved more problematic. As with some other songs throughout the night, the bass was missed. Martin was not with us, selflessly self-isolating at home after taking his dogs to Crufts in case he gave us all distemper. He was also knackered after winning a bronze in the agility class ('old dogs, new tricks section') which really took it out of him!\n\nBrungstrum 2 came next. Losing My Religion (nice intro from Dave S), a raucous You Never Can Tell and a version of You're So Vain which went well but produced a discussion on the merits of the transatlantic pronunciations of 'ay-pricot' or 'app-ricot'. For accuracy to the original, the latter I suppose. Tomayto, tormarto!\n\nIn a depressing nod to numerical conformity, on to Brungstrum 3. Take Me I'm Yours has always been one that we rather struggle with and this was no exception. The choruses went well, the verses were more 'abstract' - suggestive of the original without actually being very recognisable! Chelsea Dagger is one we don't often have a go at, but it was a good one, Jammin' really missed the bass (it is difficult to play off the beat when there isn't one!) and Rhinestone Cowboy was it's reliable self.\n\nWhere do you think we ventured next? Yep - Brungstrum 4. 'Almost' is another that doesn't get much of an airing. We did it competently enough - there are some bits where we could do with single strums etc. Perhaps we could try it again soon? That's what we did with Happy. Tried it last week and it was OK. This week's attempt indicated that might have been a fluke! Let's blame it on the lack of a bass and move on swiftly.\n\nOn to 5.3. Drift Away, And She Was, After Midnight, Dance Tonight and the rather interminable American Pie were the choices here. Again, nice to play some that don't get picked every week.\n\nFinally we went back to the gig book and ended the evening with Ukulele Lady and Galway Girl.\n\nAnother nice mixture of choices, thank you folks. We do have a selection from the Bumper book still to go through next week, plus some more from BS 5.3 - we don't edit the selections as they come in, but sometimes we have a few too many for one evening. So we have about ten songs lined up for next week - another three lists of five would see us through! If you aren't a regular list contributor, please consider jotting down five tunes you particularly enjoy playing (in which book and on which page is a help) and passing the list to Trevor or myself at the start of the evening.\n\nWe will keep you updated via email and on the FB page if the situation regarding holding the meetings changes - but at the moment it is as normal.\n\nRight - it's a Saturday afternoon and the football has been suspended. But never fear, I have found something else to do. I am off to Aldi to queue for toilet paper I don't need...\n\nUntil next week, stay well\"\n\nFrom the 4th March Meeting:\n\n\"It was the first meeting since meteorological winter turned into meteorological spring last night. Not that it felt any warmer, probably the opposite in fact - but that didn't stop 20 (or so, I didn't count!) hardy souls making it to the pub last night for our session. I am not as efficient as Trevor so I made no notes - the following may be entirely correct, partially correct or just wishful thinking.\n\nAfter Trevor's plea for a few more suggestion lists, you obliged - so thank you for that, it does make the evening run more smoothly. It's always interesting that a song we have managed to avoid for a few weeks suddenly pops up on more than one list! Especially given the number we have to choose from - I think we must have one of the widest repertoires of all ukulele groups - so some songs get 'lost'.\n\nAs has become the norm, we started off with a few from the gig book. I think this is a good thing for two reasons. Firstly we are getting warmed up playing something we know and secondly we are actually (by stealth!) practicing the songs we play out. This week's selection included King Of The Road, Whiskey In The Jar and Country Roads. I Wanna Be Like You and Love Potion Number 9 had also been requested on the lists, so we played those as well while we were at it.\n\nWe then moved to Brungstrum 5.3. If there was a theme for the rest of the evening (and there probably wasn't!) it was 'forgotten gems and playing things differently'. We started with 'Come On Eileen', had a go at the rarely attempted 'Don't Stop Me Know' and 'All Right Now'. The latter is actually an uncomfortable mash up of All Right Now and Wishing Well. Both great songs, but the mixture is less than the sum of it's parts in this case. 'How Do You Do It' was sprightly enough and 'I Say A Little Prayer For You' went OK - the timing is a bit tricky in places, but we just about got there. Not sure any of us can claim to have a voice 1% as good as Aretha's but you have to work with what you've got! 'Torn' was next. Have we ever played this? Once we'd worked out the strumming pattern, it was surprisingly decent - one to revisit, a sentiment I have my doubts about with both 'Missing' (with it's 'three beats then miss one one' rhythm) and 'Whiter Shade of Pale' (with it's two beats on everything all the way though)! Why? Well the former is a lovely delicate song, but I really have my doubts about it being suitable for massed ukuleles and voices. The latter can easily turn into a dirge and without the organ melody over the top is frankly not very musical. Only my opinions of course - feel free to disagree!). We were on much safer ground with 'Somewhere Only We Know' where we managed to be quite delicate and let the song breathe a bit.\n\nAfter a break, Brungstrum 4 was the order of the day. A rousing 'Blame It On Me' started us off nicely before we attempted 'Chasing Cars' - the change between the soft strumming and picking of the quiet bits and the more concerted chords of the chorus worked well here - again one we don't do often, but it sounded good to me. 'Happy'? Well, quite. We got through it (is that the first time?), not without some hiccups, but if we can get the tune, chords, strumming and backing vocals right it will be a good one!!! 'It's All About You' is becoming a favourite, and seems to suit us. 'Sweet About Me' is another less played song but again we did it quite well. It is another of those 'same four chords around and around' songs though. I think we may have to introduce some variation in vocals, or who plays what and when if we want to persist with it. Nice tune though! 'Yellow' (thanks Mike for slowing down my intro count. You were right) and 'Viva La Vida' (thanks Martin for reminding us all of the strumming pattern) were followed by an evening ending 'Galway Girl' with a quieter middle section - thanks to Marion for that suggestion - although it might sound better with single chords rather than no chords at all? One to try, I think!\n\nThanks to all for a lovely well-humoured and varied evening, with songs ranging from the well-known to the 'have we ever played this before', which seems like a good mix to me. Some other 'thank you's: to Marion for arranging for some get well flowers for Joy, to everybody to contributing towards them and to all of you for responding to Trevor's request and toning the between songs chatter and noodling down a fair bit. Again - it really does help.\n\nNext week. Open Mic (or it that Open Mike, or Open Mik? I never know) at 7pm for half an hour before the main session. Those who have not done it before will be given priority - be brave, it's a bit like a sky dive. Scary before you try it, great once you've done it. Mind you I am scared of heights.\n\nWe get through a bunch of songs every week - about 25. So as always, we need your lists. One list of 25, of five lists of five or .... well, you get the idea. Just choose something you'd like us to play!\n\nSomething to consider - are some of the new songs gig book contenders?\n\nUkulele Bedford - always the same, always different\n\nCiao (I disinfected that after I wrote it)\"\n\nFrom the 26th Febuary Meeting:\n\n\"On Wednesday (26th) 26 of us made it along to the Kings Arms, Bedford at 7:30pm for our weekly dose of Ukulele Bedford. I would like to have said we played 26 songs, but it was 26 plus one for the pot (not that anyone was counting). We played a generous baker’s double-dozen of top tunes from Brung Strum 3, the Bumper Book (2014 July) and Brung Strum 5.3, bookended rather magnificently by a few favourites from the Gig Book (2018 Beer Festival Corrected).\n\nWe got ourselves up and running with Cracklin Rosie, 59th Street Bridge Song, Mama Mia and You Got It, before switching from the Gig Book to Brung Strum 3, where we enjoyed Echo Beach, Ex’s and Oh’s, It Must Be Love and I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For. We then had a change of gear, moving over to the Bumper Book, where we started with You’ve Got Your Troubles, followed by You’re Sixteen, Without You and Til There Was You (which was an unexpected gem). We then sashayed our way up to the break with The Night Has a Thousand Eyes, The Lions Sleeps Tonight and The Last Time.\n\nFollowing our regulation interval for the cleaning and refilling of our glasses, we skipped on into Brung Strum 5.3 for a rousing rendition of Sit Down, followed by a sultry Why Don’t You Do Right (OK sultry might be stretching it), a chipper Top of the World, a harmonious Addicted to Love and a persistent Come on Eileen. By this stage, we had used up all our song suggestions for the evening, but we weren’t yet ready to go home, so we opened the floor for any suggestions, which were forthcoming – even if I had to suggest a few myself. We played Galway Girl, Golden Brown, Handbags and Gladrags, Hey Soul Sister and Hey There Delilah (all from Brung Strum 5.3).\n\nYet again, we played the 13/8 rhythm for Golden Brown, so I’m convinced now it wasn’t a one-off fluke. We were in good voice this week and our playing wasn’t half bad either, so well done one and all. We rounded the evening off with Urban Spaceman and City of New Orleans (both from the Gig Book – 2018 BFC Edition). I failed to mention it in the notices slot, but we do have an Open Mic session from 7pm to 7:30pm in a couple of weeks on 11th March, so get your duets and solos ready to perform. In the meantime, this Wednesday (4th March) we’ll be starting our weekly group practice at the regular time of 7:30pm, which will be amazing (especially if you’re able to join us).\n\nFinally, if I could ask you for a couple of small indulgences, these will make our evenings together even more amazing (and my job easier). Firstly, over the last few weeks we’ve been running a bit short of pre-meditated song suggestions, so if you’ve not put pen to paper for a few weeks to request a few songs, could I encourage you to do so this week – we need your suggestions (ideally written down and passed to me or Jon at the start of the evening). Secondly, I’ve been struggling a bit recently to make myself heard, so if you like noodling about and chatting between songs could you please do it quietly, at least until everyone hears which number we’re playing next.\n\nThanks in advance for your help with the house keeping – it maintains our sessions’ open and friendly feel if we can all share the burden of song suggestions equally and listen up between playing them. See you on Wednesday, at 7:30pm in the Kings Arms, Bedford – bring your own uke or borrow the loaner instrument from behind the bar.\"\n\nFrom the 19th Febuary Meeting:\n\n\"This week has been the half term break for schools, but we don’t have terms at Ukulele Bedford, so twenty of us met up at the Kings Arms at 7:30pm on Wednesday evening for our weekly constitutional. Jon kindly stepped in and covered for me, while I stepped out to get some cash, and you started the evening with Whiskey in the Jar from the Gig Book (2018 Beer Festival Corrected) followed by Dreaming, Hello Mary Lou and Shimmy Like My Sister Kate. Having warmed up, we switched over to a set of suggested songs from the Bumper Book (the July 2014 edition). We had Hi Ho Silver Lining, Da Do Ron Ron, Every Day, Dream a Little Dream, Mrs Robinson, and Needles and Pins. Dream a Little Dream is a lovely song to sing and includes some of the under-represented chords (e.g. Am7-5, Bm7, Bbm6 and Cm7) that encourages us to embrace the diversity of barre chords. Mrs Robinson is just a lovely song to play, especially when we sing the intro using the rhythm of the verse (i.e. ‘Dee dedee dee…’), which we did, and it sounded pretty fine.\n\nAfter dabbling in the Bumper book with a few tunes from the sixties, we switched over to Brung Strum 2 for this week’s second set of selected songs. These were mainly from the seventies and eighties. We had Baker Street, Big Yellow Taxi, I Don’t Like Mondays, I’m Yours, Please Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood and This Ole House. Admittedly, I’m Yours was from 2008 and we were a little dubious about completing it, but we managed to sing it all the way through, including the two split parts at the end. This one seems to be a slow grower. When we first started playing it, I don’t think Jason Mraz would have recognised it, but we’re warming to it. Should Jason ever call in and join us on a Wednesday evening, he might be pleasantly surprised. Always keen to promote new talent, here’s a link to the You Tube video in case you feel the need to sing-a-long with Jason https://youtu.be/EkHTsc9PU2A (other music video providers are available).\n\nHaving completed sixteen songs, our tachograph indicated it was time to pull over and take a break, so we drew the first half to a close. Following the intermission and without any further song suggestions, we went ‘off-list’ and noodled our way around Brung Strum 5.3. This was initiated by my request to play Golden Brown. About a month ago, we managed to play the 13/8 sections in the verses and I just wanted to make sure it wasn’t a dream. This time we didn’t even have the safety net of a bass to keep us together, but we were able to repeat our past glory, and again our Brown was Golden. We then had Handbags and Gladrags, Hey There Delilah and How Do You Do It before taking a side-step to try out a new version of Teenage Dirtbag that Mike brought along for us on paper. Mike did a stellar job of introducing the timing in the bridge, which made it seem a lot more playable – that and the change of key made this my favourite version so far.\n\nWe rounded out the second half of the evening by returning to Brung Strum 5.3 for Spitting In the Wind, Stuck In the Middle With You and What’s Up. It was the first time I’d heard, let alone played, Spitting In the Wind. However, thanks to some good singing from Jon, I enjoyed it and would even go as far as watching Joan Collins sing along with Badly Drawn Boy in the video (https://youtu.be/J0POI7qC0uc). Maybe we should learn it, just in case Joan ever calls in to joins us on a Wednesday evening. The request for ‘last tune of the night’ went to Make Me Smile from the Gig Book (2018 Beer Festival Corrected), which left us on a high, even if they locals weren’t calling out for more on this occasion.\n\nWe’ll be back at the Kings Arms this Wednesday from 7:30pm for more Ukulele Bedford. If you’re returning from a half-term break, don’t forget to bring a note listing your holiday song selection, we have a diverse range of songs and song books to inspire you (with or without barre chords).\"\n\nFrom the 12th Febuary Meeting:\n\n\"This week our practice was literally an Oasis between two storms. Storm Ciara and storm Dennis gave us flooding and high winds at the weekends but come Wednesday we brought our Ukulele sunshine to the Kings Arms, Bedford. We started at the earlier time of 7pm with the Open Mic session. I was not able to attend, but it looked like everyone else did and they had a great time. Thanks to the soloists and their supporting audience. Unlike the Oscars, everyone gets recognition for their contributions to our Open Mic – this has become a popular slot and we look forward to the next one (especially if you missed it this week).\n\nAt 7:30pm we switched to group mode and launched the evening’s practice with a few tunes from the Gig Book (2018 Beer Festival Corrected). This week it was a short warm up starting with I Want to Be Like You, then Lola and Sunny Afternoon. Jon and I had a bumper harvest of song suggestions, so we went straight on to Brung Strum 4 playing Blame It on Me, Hot and Cold, Its All About You, Lightning Bolt, Rule the World, Pumped Up Kicks and Starlight. Some of these songs sounded great – Blame It on Me and Starlight were my highlights (you can think of your own favourites). Rule the World is a song we don’t yet know and the consensus was that we needed to listen to it more so here’s a link to the video on You Tube (other song providers are available) https://youtu.be/CM3jcGsS0Po.\n\nThen it was over to Brung Strum 5.3 with a mixture of less played and recently requested numbers. We had Teenage Dirtbag, Abracadabra, Ain’t That a Shame, Do You Love Me and Jackson. We’ve sometimes struggled a bit with the timing of the bridge in Teenage Dirtbag, but this week it looked like we nearly cracked it – check it out at https://youtu.be/FC3y9llDXuM?t=126. Anyway, that was us up to the interval. Not that I’m counting, but that made 15 songs in an hour and 15 minutes (averaging 5 minutes a song, including chit chat). As is often said about our timing, it’s not a race, but I having your song suggestions (in advance) enables us to be both efficient and eclectic.\n\nWe followed tradition this week and refilled our glasses, stretched our legs and played nice during breaktime. Recharged, we returned to Brung Strum 5.3 for Killing Me Softly, Sorrow, Summer in The City, Summer Nights, How Do You Do It, I Will Survive, Shotgun, Sit Down, Stuck in the Middle With You and Galway Girl. That was a 10 tune blitz in about an hour, so we were holding our pace. Over the last few weeks we’ve been fortunate in that people have been bringing great song suggestions. I hope you’re getting enough variety and repetition to keep it enjoyable as well as educational. This week has been flying past, but if you get a chance to note down a few songs for us to sing this Wednesday (especially songs we’re improving or not done for a while) that would be most helpful.\n\nI was a bit worried about stepping into Mark’s shoes as compere but together we seem to be managing. Mixing things up is just one of the things that keeps us young and fresh, so please keep feeding back to Jon, David and me (or anyone else on the committee) about what works and what doesn’t and we’ll try to navigate a course that makes most of us happy most of the time. Weather permitting, we’ll be at the Kings Arms again this Wednesday starting at 7:30pm – I hope you’ll bring your sunshine with you.\"\n\nFrom the 5th Febuary Meeting:\n\n\"Another week and another episode of Ukulele Bedford – the reality show that really is a reality, every Wednesday evening from 7:30pm to 10pm in the Kings Arms, Bedford. However, unlike a reality show, we’re not chasing the ratings – we can be ourselves, playing the ukulele in public is our chosen form of self-expression, and who’s to say we’re not living the dream. This week around 23 dreamers came together at the chosen time and place, and we created our own reality, which at times sounded pretty good (even if I say so myself).\n\nMy subliminal requests for song suggestions seem to be working – we got more suggestions this week than we had time to play, which means we’ve got a head start on next week’s selection (further suggestions are still needed). Everyone contributing from time to time with a few suggested song choices, seems to be both fair and efficient. We get to play something we like and something someone else likes – these are not always the same songs, so we get to give and take. We’re not just playing for our own pleasure, but we’re playing for the pleasure of others in the group. Some might say it’s karmic, but it’s just how we roll at Ukulele Bedford.\n\nHaving annoyed you with my background chatter, let's get down to the music – we started our pre-flight checklist with a few openers from the Gig Book (2018 Beer Festival Corrected ‘BFC’ Edition). Dedicated Follower of Fashion, King of the Road, Eight Days a Week, Light My Fire and Things helped us to warm up and get comfortable, before we took off with some suggested songs from Brung Strum 1. We hadn’t played from this book for a while, so it was a welcome return. We had Country Honk, Have I the Right, Walking on Sunshine, You Say You Don’t Love Me, Africa and Mister Blue Sky.\n\nSome pitfalls we avoided, and some tripped us up, but we kept on strumming. Have I the Right even got a bit of reflective discussion and helpful steering from Martin, which on our second play enabled us to make a much better job of the contrasting rapid strumming sections at the end of the verses. Africa is a song that we come back to from time to time, and that seems to be getting better for it. My memory for intros is not the best, but David helped get us up and running, and we kept together for most of it. Walking on Sunshine is one of those jolly songs that has the potential to please a crowd, so we might even work on that a bit more in the future to get it gig ready.\n\nWe then moved to Brung Strum 3 and played Boulevard of Broken Dreams and Ex’s and Oh’s – which was nice. We may have had our intermission before or after our sojourn in Brung Strum 3, my historical notes omitted that detail, but needless to say it was a sociable break and gave us the opportunity to stretch our legs, rest our fingers and refill our glasses. The second half involved a good range of songs from the Bumper Book, which is what happens when we get multiple people suggesting songs from the same book (it’s good for our karma).\n\nWe had 500 Miles, A Picture of You, A World of Our Own, All I Have to Do is Dream, A Teenager in Love, The Boxer, California Dreaming, The Letter and Ukulele Lady. I wouldn’t say we played 500 Miles too slowly, but next time we could cover the ground in a bit less time. California Dreaming let us split the room to sing it in two parts, which we did geometrically and with style. For the last tune of the evening we switched back to the Gig Book (BFC) for the delightful Urban Spaceman. Where did the time go – we’ve only just gotten over Christmas and its suddenly February.\n\nThe good news is that this Wednesday (12th) we have an Open Mic session from 7pm to 7:30pm, followed by our regular Reality Ukulele Experience from 7:30pm to 10pm. Please come for 7pm if you can and give us a song or support those that do, otherwise try and make it for the 7:30pm kick-off. It will be Valentine’s Day this coming week, an annual celebration for loving all things Ukulele. If you’re not able to join us this week, take comfort in the knowledge that we’ll be there thinking of you (with puppy dog eyes) and hoping to see you soon.\n\nUntil then – keep strumming\"\n\nFrom the 29th January Meeting:\n\n\"Twenty-five brave souls joined us on Wednesday night at the Kings Arms for a few hours of ukulele therapy. Over the last few weeks we’ve been starting with a few songs we know very well, followed by quite a few songs ‘in development’ and finishing with one or two crowd pleasers. It might catch on, at least I’ve been enjoying it, so many thanks to everyone that provided this week’s song choices (you know who you are).\n\nSo, what did we actually play – from the Gig Book (2018 beer festival, corrected edition) we started our strumming medication with Ghost Riders in the Sky, then we had It Must Be Love, Love Potion Number Nine, I’m a Believer, Sway and It’s My Party. Having got the party started, we switched over to the Bumper Book and had a nearly perfect performance of Folsom Prison Blues. We played it slightly slower than usual but sang it particularly well, so we might try it at 45 rpm next time. In good voice, we worked our way through Friday I’m in Love, Half the World Away, Happy Together, Hotel California, I Can See Clearly Now, Maggie May and finished with Mama Don’t Allow.\n\nTime-out was awarded for good behaviour and we recharged our glasses before returning for more medcine. We started back, after the nine o’clock watershed, with two new songs (thanks to Marion). We had I Will Survive (from www.burpmusic.com) followed by You’re My World (from www.scorpexuke.com). I Will Survive was an instant hit and has potential to become a future Gig Book selection. It’s fair to say, we were less familiar with You’re My World, but for those who knew the song it's a lovely tune, and with a bit of application I’m sure the rest of us could get to love it too.\n\nHaving dabbled in the unknown, we moved on to the slightly more familiar BrungStrum 5.3 playing Breakfast at Tiffany’s, Bus Stop (where my pronunciation was challenged), Dancing Queen (for absent friends), Downtown, Venus and Video Killed the Radio Star. It was at this point that my list of provided song choices ran out and I’m sure we played something else before finishing the evening with City of New Orleans (from the Gig Book). The details of exactly what we played before our crowd pleasing finale is eluding me, but that’s this week’s quiz – no prizes for the first person to tell us the answer next Wednesday, other than the gratitude of anyone like me, whose memory isn’t as good as it used to be.\n\nAs is often the case, the health-giving benefits of Ukulele Bedford would not happen without those of you that turned up, so thanks to this week’s participants, especially those of you that brought song suggestions (hint for next week) and particularly Marion for bringing us a couple of new songs. We’ll be doing it all again on Wednesday this coming week (5th), starting at 7:30m in the Kings Arms, Bedford. On a closing note, we were missing Mark and he will be greatly missed, now that he’s moved, but we can take some comfort in that, in the same week the UK exited Europe, Ukulele Bedford entered Norfolk. We wish Mark and Chris all the best for their new life in the principality and look forward to Mark’s guest appearance the next time they’re visiting Bedford.\n\nHave a great week - see you soon\"\n\nFrom the 22nd January Meeting:\n\n\"Twenty-six of us made it along to the King’s Arms on Wednesday for this week’s Ukulele Bedford practice. We started the evening with a few known tunes from the Gig Book, before switching over to BrungStrum 2 and we finished the evening with a selection from BrungStrum 4. We kicked off with Lola, Shimmy Like My Sister Kate, Tide is High/Rudy and Sunny Afternoon to get us warmed up. We then got down to some of the suggested songs (always welcomed) with Please Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood and Paint it Black. While we were so close to it, we then included our rendition of Always Look on the Bright Side of Life in homage to Terry Jones who died on Tuesday.\n\nWe cracked open BrungStrum 2 with Baker Street (electing to play intro 2) then Country House before the politically insensitive and annoying catchy Girls, girls, girls. In the past we’ve not really gotten on very well with Jason Marz’s I’m Yours but this week he very near was ours – we managed to divide and almost conquer the split chorus / verse outro. It might even be worth giving him a listen on You Tube (https://youtu.be/EkHTsc9PU2A) someone’s bound to get the hang of it eventually. We then skipped ahead to Your So Vain, before taking a step back to play Chuck Berry’s You Never Can Tell, and then looped round to finish our first half with Blanket on the Ground.\n\nHaving sucked the obligatory orange segment, we moved into BrungStrum 4 and started our second half with George Ezra’s Blame it on Me, where we even managed to include the single strums in the fifth verse for a rather spectacular contrast. Next, we had House of Gold, which has an unusual muted string pattern in the first verse and single strums in the final bridge that we played quite well, even if I say so myself. Pumped up Kicks was the last of the requested songs, after which we went off-list with suggestions from the room. I think these may have included (although necessarily in this order) Back to Black, Human, It’s All About You, Road Runner, Somewhere Only We Know, and Yellow (which was my highlight of the week) and we finished with the rather lovely Hidden in the Sand.\n\nA few folks mentioned that some of the songs were played too slowly or too quickly, which may be true, but I think we are keeping to time even if that’s not necessarily the correct time for every song. Speeding up during a song is a common error that a lot of ukulele groups make, particularly when they’re having fun, but we seemed to avoid that this week. We are getting better at listening to the beat and to one another and playing together. The more familiar we get with each song, the better chance we’ll have of playing it at the right speed. You Tube might help a bit with that, but I think it’s when we listen to one another and stay with the beat, that we keep in time and sound like we know what we’re doing.\n\nThanks again to those that came this week and I hope this summary makes everyone else jealous of what they missed out on. The good news is we’ll be doing it all again this Wednesday from 7:30pm in the King’s Arms where Sean the barman will be welcoming us to ‘Bedford’s most versatile pub’. That’s what their website says, and I’d like to think Ukulele Bedford is nothing if not versatile. If you do have any song suggestions, requiring versatility or otherwise, please make a note of them and bring them with you on Wednesday – we look forward to seeing you then.\n\nP.S. A note for your diary – the next Open Mic Evening will be on the 12th of February (from 7pm to 7:30pm). David will facilitate the running order, so let him know if you’re up for it – we can guarantee you an appreciative and loving audience (given the close proximity to Saint Valentine’s Day).\"\n\nFrom the 15th January Meeting:\n\n\"Last night we had an amazing 29 of us turn up to my inaugural session as facilitator – thanks for coming along and making it a lovely evening. We started in the gig book with some old favourites (or at least my favourites) from the first half of the gig book: Dedicated Follower of Fashion, Bad moon rising/Deeper on Down, Whiskey in the Jar, King of the Road, Light My Fire, 59th Street Bridge Song, and I Wanna Be Like You. Having warmed up, we finished the first half of the evening with a selection from the Bumper Book (Waterloo Sunset, When you Walk in the Room, The Boxer, Pretty Flamingo, Needles and Pins, and El Condor Pasa).\n\nEven though we don’t play some of these all that regularly we made a good job of most of them. We managed to avoid speeding up, which is not as easy as it sounds – I sometimes get carried away in the moment, but you managed to keep us in check. During the course of the first half we also managed to fade at the end of a few songs – there is nothing wrong with the odd cha, cha, cha (particularly when we all do it), but it does us good to have a bit of variety in our collective endings.\n\nAfter a short intermission for some lubrication and socialisation, we started the second half of the evening in the Bumper Book with Every Day, before switching over to Brung Strum 5.3 for some newer tunes. We took our time and even repeated a few of the songs, which seemed to really improve our playing of them. Golden Brown was transformed – I never imagined that we’d be able to change time together during a song, but we did it thanks to Jon’s counting and everyone else paying attention to his lead. We then had Hey Soul Sister, Hey There Delilah, Jackson, Killing Me Softly and Miss Otis Regrets.\n\nAgain, taking our time with these and listening to the sage advice of those familiar with the songs (paid off big up to Mike). I think Hey Soul Sister is a lovely song, that some of us have played at the Berkhamstead Thrash evening, but if you don’t know it, give it a listen on You Tube. I struggle with the rhythm of the rap section, but I’m convinced we could learn it. Splitting the parts for Jackson really works well for us and can even be good fun when we get going. Our rendition of Mis Otis Regrets was probably my favourite tune of the evening – somehow Mike’s patient explanations are having an effect and I think we played it really well.\n\nWe finished the evening on a high with Galway Girl – Rex’s picking just makes us all happy and the rest of the song seems to look after itself. This is what happens when we find songs we enjoy playing and we listen to one another. Thanks again for a great evening – I’ve already had two song suggestions for next week: Lodi and Love Shack (both in Brung Strum 5.3 pages 65 and 68). If you have any other suggestions, please email them to me and Jon, or bring them with you on a bit of paper next week.\"\n\nFrom the 8th January Meeting:\n\n\"This is, sort of formally, my last email to you all from Ukulele Bedford, so please excuse any rambling. Weekly missives will continue, but mostly from other hands.\n\nLast night, as I see it, we had a session of three parts: the Special General Meeting (SGM); a good musical blast to blow away any festive cobwebs; and a bit of a thank you from me for your collective kindness.\n\nSome 17 members were in attendance for the SGM, rising to around 22 for the rest of the evening. This included a new John, who seemed to be having a good time, and we saw the welcome return of Norman, Rebecca and Pat.\n\nWe will issue formal minutes from the (rather informal) SGM separately, but the main decisions are that your new Chair is Trevor Collins; your new Membership Secretary is Andy Chinn; and your new Vice Chair is David Neale. All other Committee positions remain as previously (without me, obviously), until the AGM in the spring. I have every confidence that this just represents a changing of the guard but that what is guarded – the spirit, values and activities of Ukulele Bedford – remain intact. I intend to watch Ukulele Bedford flourish, with all your help.\n\nFollowing the election, we had a bit of a chat about the direction Ukulele Bedford may take in the future. We have come a long way with our choice of music now being as wide as any group's, but there was a feeling that we could do with a few more gigs than in 2019, so long as they were of the right sort. There was also support for the idea of more learning sessions and possibly finding more modern songs that stretch our chord repertoire (although, as Martin pointed out, most modern songs rarely exceed four chords) and perhaps encourage more vocal harmonies. There was talk about a cajon as an occasional addition, provided we could find someone who could play it well and was happy to not play it if a song didn’t warrant such accompaniment. Generally, though, people were happy with the group as it stands. Whether you were with us last night or not and have any more thoughts for the group to consider, please talk to Jon or Trevor. It’s quite rare for anyone’s concern to be individual.\n\nOn to the music. We started with Urban Spaceman as a rousing tribute to the late Neil Innes and then spent the first half of the evening in the current Gig Book, reminding ourselves that we can sing and play these little four-string wonders to decent effect. It really was suspiciously as though we had practised them before.\n\nAt the start of the break, I was ambushed by your kind generosity with leaving gifts that are right up my street – a case of Dorset beers, and engraved glass to drink them from and a deluxe bird-feeding station for my new garden to watch while drinking, and a leaving card to read between beers/birds. Just perfect! Thank you all so very much. I have my suspicions that Marion and Kathryn were behind some or all of that (an aside to the new Committee: Marion single-handedly sorted our current and previous Wednesday venues and Kathryn has responded to every plea for new songs or playlists going. They are useful people.).\n\nUkulele Bedford has been an important part of my recent life and I will think of you all fondly. I will still have some work in the area, so may be able to drop in occasionally on a Wednesday or perhaps even for a gig . . . at least until I can find a more local outlet for my ukes. There will be groups nearby, but not in Holt itself so far. Who knows, perhaps we can twin UB with UH if and when it exists. I still don’t have a moving date, so expect me to be skulking at the back for a Wednesday or two to come. But hey, I leave on good terms and won’t feel that I am crawling back after an argument where I discover I have left my car keys on the table. We all know that feeling.\n\nAnyway, the second half’s music all came from BrungStrum 5.3, and mostly went very well. We perhaps played the Five Foot Two instrumental too fast for some people, so that was a little ragged, but we made good headway with Don’t Look Back in Anger, Downtown, Do You Love Me and other songs beginning with different letters. With a bit of practice, there is plenty in this book to spice up our Gig Book for the 2020s.\n\nNext week, bring bits of paper with song suggestions, perhaps a whole list, or even a head full of ideas and enthusiasm and prepare for another great night with Ukulele Bedford. How could there be anything else?\n\nAll the best for wherever life and your ukulele take you in 2020.\"\n\nFrom the 19th December Meeting:\n\n\"You can’t say you weren’t warned – Wednesday’s second Christmas session was, well, a cracker, if we must resort to cliché. And, of course, we must. Half Man Half Biscuit say so, even if their particular festive ditty (It’s cliched to by cynical at Christmas) didn’t make the selection last night. Some 23 of us, including various jumper-wearers, three Santas, a couple of elves and various flashing baubles made merry with the Christmas book and the Gig book in an evening that just flew by. Great fun.\n\nThe only foray outside those two books was for Galway Girl (and welcome party nibbles), that we now play so often and so well that most of us looked for it in various Gig Book iterations until realising that it sits in BrungStrum5.3.\n\nOur next official gathering is the gig/ cheesefest at the Wellington Arms this Sunday. Please note that we will be on from 3.30pm, NOT 2pm as previously advertised. This will be relatively informal, with no amplification, no bass and a bunch of bright-eyed locals to help us on the vocals. We’ll carry on until we stop or get thrown out. We’ll need a handful of music stands and please bring your main music on your device, even though we may be working from a paper book, courtesy of Lisa. Judging from last night’s show hands, there should be double figures of Ukulele Bedford players, all having a relaxed time for charity. That seems like a fine way to end the year.\n\nAs we leave 2019 (the year of the impossible D7aug9 chord) and head into the much easier 2020 (the year of the Hawaiian D7), we can reflect on another good year for Ukulele Bedford. Attendance has remained at around last year’s level, averaging the low-to-mid twenties and we have had a good selection of newcomers who have stayed, irregulars who come and go, and old faithfuls, some of whom have been with us from the very start. Every last one of you has been welcome and will have contributed in some way to our enjoyment, so thank you all.\n\nWe also introduced BrungStrum 5 and quickly amended it to BrungStrum5.3, which is rapidly becoming one of our go-to books. We have been a bit lighter on gigs – and hence charity contributions – this year, but did well on those we attended.\n\nOur open mics have introduced the thrill/terror to more people and I think we are a stronger group because of that. Halloween, Pirate Day and both Christmas sessions have confirmed our penchant for dressing up and looking generally fabulous, and we are definitely stronger singers than a year ago. We didn’t manage to resurrect our learning sessions this year. Perhaps that’s something for 2020.\n\nTalking of which, don’t forget our Special General Meeting that starts the New Year at 7pm on 8th January, where you will have your chance to elect a new Chair and to help shape our vision for 2020. Will it be as clear as the phrase suggests? Only you can decide.\n\nWhether I see you on Sunday or not, I hope you have the relaxed, friendly, exciting, calorific, drunken, healthy, pleasant or downright fabulous festive season that you hope for. We’ll be in touch again after the break.\n\nHappy Christmas\"\n\nFrom the 12th December Meeting:\n\n\"Happy Christmas Part One went really well last night. Around 25 of us, many sporting at least a nod if not a full-blown head-bang towards festive regalia, made merry with our new Christmas Book. Most of it went really well and was actually much more enjoyable than I had feared. We copped out of Driving Home for Christmas but made a good fist of various other new (to us) songs, including Stop The Cavalry, Silent Night and We Wish You A Merry Christmas – I am amazed that that particular song had never appeared in our previous Christmas books. One great thing about these songs is that we all know them and that was certainly reflected well in our singing – great stuff.\n\nFortified with mince pies, sausage rolls, stollen, chestnuts and millionaire’s shortbread at least, we tackled BrungStrum 5.3 with gusto in the second half. Following a bit of discussion with Martin and Trevor at half time, we may even have cracked some of the counting-in malarkey. We promise you’ll never hear us count in 1,2,1,2,3,4, but 1,2,3,4,1,2, may make an appearance.\n\nNext week, we’ll tackle more of the Christmas book, reprising some of last night’s successes and finding more, before scoffing half-time cake and then finishing our ukulele year with Gig Book songs for the second half. If it’s anywhere near as good as last night, you really won’t want to miss it, even if you haven’t been with us much this year.\n\nAfter that, because both Christmas Day and New Year’s Day fall on Wednesdays, we will be at the Wellington Arms, Bedford 2-4pm on 22nd December for a Cheesy Christmas Charity Singalong, but our first meeting of 2020 will be on 8th January at 7pm – I’ll now explain that timing.\n\nI surprised many people last night by announcing that I am moving away from the area in the New Year. Contracts are signed, but I have no moving date yet and expect to be with you for at least the first session of 2020, but perhaps no more than that. This means that we will need to elect a new Chair, and for banking purposes at least will have to change our official address from my home to someone else’s.\n\nI will be sad to leave Ukulele Bedford but am confident that I leave it in a good, robust state that will still be around on the odd occasion that I am able to make a return visit – I will still have some work in this area, so I hope I won’t be a complete stranger.\n\nBut hey, life moves on and what better day is there to talk about elections than 12th December?\n\nUkulele Bedford is bigger than any one of us – come along to our next session next Wednesday and find out how much fun that can be.\n\nAll the best\"\n\nFrom the 5th December Meeting:\n\n\"A healthy 24 of us ploughed through a lot of songs in our last pre-festive session last night, and I think we did pretty well. In particular, our split songs and harmonies were on form. We chose songs from BrungStrums 3 and 5.3 and a few from the Bumper Book, ranging from as far back as 1925 to, just, the 21st century (thanks, Kylie).\n\nWe started with It Must Be Love – such a good song, both to play and sing – followed by Rhinestone Cowboy. Those lines, “Getting cards and letters from people I don’t even know . . . Offers coming over the phone” clearly places it in the pre-internet, pre-spam days. We’ll probably never quite polish You Took The Words Right Out of My Mouth or Jammin’ as we’d like, but Boulevard of Broken Dreams, Land Down Under and Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For all go well. Most of Fox on the Run worked better than ever, especially the harmonies on the line - Like a fox, Like a fox, like a . . . oh, you get it.\n\nIn 5.3, there are a couple of songs that we used to play a lot when we worked on paper but that haven’t graced the digital era. The three part Let It Be takes some instruction, but was deemed “rewarding”. I can take that. I think the instrumental version of Five Foot Two came as a surprise to many people and it certainly wasn’t our most accomplished, but it does at least show a bit more of what the ukulele can do. A trickier more modern number from the book was Queen’s Don’t Stop Me Now, which we did passably well, and I Will Survive which works on many levels.\n\nFrom the Bumper Book, our usual fare was supplemented by Build Me Up Buttercup – we never quite get it right, but it’s worth it for the bits we do. Remember, we are after enjoyment not perfection – and Ain’t No Sunshine. This song is worth going back to because it provides a great contrast to all the regular strumming that so many of our other tunes demand. California Dreaming is a banker.\n\nNext week, it’s Christmaaaaaaaaaas, part one. I sent the songbook out last week. If you haven’t downloaded it yet, you can find it here: http://ukulelebedford.co.uk/files/UkuleleBedfordChristmasSongbook2019.pdf Previous editions need not apply. Remember, some of these songs will also be the basis of our 22nd December Wellington Arms Cheesy Christmas afternoon, but before then will be in our club Christmas part two on 18th December. The format for the next two weeks is that we will spend the first half playing a selection of festive offerings, break for seasonal victuals (please come armed with calories), and then play what we fancy from any book in the second half. That should satisfy the sparkly Christmas people and the stripy humbuggers alike. Festive jumpers, baubly ear-rings and tinsel are optional – but good options.\n\nIt will be fun. It will be even better if you are with us.\"\n\nFrom the 27th November Meeting:\n\n\"We started quietly with the Open Mic last night, but gradually crept up to 22 souls, all enjoying a good run through the almost neglected BrungStrum2 book.\n\nIn the Open Mic itself, we had a good selection of (mainly male) performers, including Rob for the second time, showing that he wasn’t completely traumatised by his debut, Andy, as a rarity, and “David feat. Jon” doing a suitably scary Thriller. More like “David feat. Vincent Price”. Joy and Mark performed You to me are Everything, and it was a great to hear and feel the audience join in with the chorus. Thank you. I suspect the next Open Mic will be in the New Year, but we’ll let you know if we can squeeze one in before Christmas.\n\nAmong its other gems BrungStrum2 has some of our simplest songs, including two two-chorders and a couple with oft-repeated choruses. You’d think those would be easy, but when you know that you should be playing either G7 or C or perhaps F or C and nothing else, the mind wanders and can trip you up. And doesn’t it just feel embarrassing to get the chords wrong when there aren’t many of them? Perhaps there is a happy medium between the simplicity of these two-chorders and the all-chord madness of Queen or David Bowie.\n\nI don’t know whether it was because of being lulled into a state of false competence by the two-chorders or for some other reason, but we played quite a lot of songs that bit slower than usual last night. This Old House, Wild Rover and even Galway Girl felt a little more sedate than normal, and we didn’t even speed up in many songs. Perhaps we were tired after the Open Mic.\n\nMentioning Christmas, we decided last night to split our celebrations into two weeks. We’ll probably play Christmas songs in the first half and then a different selection after the break. This is for both 11th and 18th December – double jollity. What’s not to like? Before you answer that, have a listen to the first song in the new Christmas book here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxqQtUQErhQ\n\nOur new Christmas songbook is attached and will also appear on the website shortly. Any previous Christmas books can be deleted. What you need is UkuleleBedfordChristmasSongbook2019.pdf Nothing else will do.\n\nNext week, we have no Open Mic, no festive shenanigans and so far no lists, but there is all our usual potential. Come along and help us fulfil it.\n\nCheers\"\n\nFrom the 20th November Meeting:\n\n\"Two complementary lists from BrungStrum 5.3 kept 21 of us amused last night. There are still one or two songs in the book that we can sing when we get into them but can’t work out how to start, and there are a few that depend on particular leaders being present, but overall, we are getting the hang of them. Remember, these were the songs you most recently chose for the group, so it’s not surprising that we can make a good evening from it.\n\nWe started with After Midnight – one of those that is fine when you work yourself into it – and Ain’t That a Shame, followed by And She Was. Breakfast at Tiffanys is starting to gel now and Downtown was always straightforward. I suspect we know For What is Chatteris better than any other uke group and our Galway Girl isn’t bad either.\n\nFor Henry Lee, we split into picking verses and strumming choruses, which nearly worked. Some of the changeovers were a little ragged and we could perhaps settle on a particular strum, but this shows potential for bringing a nice contrast to the usual DDUUDU strums. As a song, it’s a great weapon against those people who think the ukulele is such a happy instrument. It can be, but it can be more than that.\n\nA few more songs – Hey There Delilah, Miss Otis Regrets, Lucky, Lucky, Lucky Me– followed that Mike had introduced or knew well and so led. If next week is Open Mic night (which it is), this had a touch of Mike Mic night about it. The more we can share the load, the better.\n\nMusically, the only surprise to me was that our oldest song, Moon River, was chosen by our youngest and newest members. Ah, well. You can’t knock our breadth of choice.\n\nNext week, we start early with our Open Mic from 7pm-7.30pm, followed, as usual, by your selection of songs from any of our books. Last month’s Open Mic was a cracker and we have one or two names on the list for next week already. Just remember, our aim is to make this the most open-hearted ukulele Open Mic session in the whole town. And the main rule is that no performer should apologise for anything. Come along, it will be fun.\n\nFinally, I mentioned last week that we had been invited to take part in a Cheesy Christmas Sing Along at the Wellington Arms on 22nd December in the afternoon. Posters are up. It’s going to happen, so prepare for a purely acoustic afternoon of beer, cheese and cheer. Songbook to follow. When Lisa mentioned it last week, I immediately thought of a song we could do that mentions both cheese and Christmas. I suspect I won’t get around to Open Mic-ing it even though it's only three chords, so for your listening pleasure, I simply present John Hegley’s Eddie Don’t Like Furniture: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igFkYJ_XeOY&t=28s\n\nAll the best\"\n\nFrom the 13th November Meeting:\n\n\"We sometimes seem to have a problem with counting. I am not sure whether we had 23 or 25 people last night, all enjoying a laid-back session of 21st century songs from BrungStrum4, a few extras from the Gig Book and a second half of oddities from the Bumper Book. But if my head counts in the twenties are questionable, then what does that say for our collective inability to reach two, three or four, either when counting a song in or repeating choruses and final lines? Not much, probably. There are, however, a lot of songs that we stumble through ok once we get started, but that where that initial count and the first line of melody elude us. Perhaps we should listen to our choices a bit more. Still, chaos breeds laughter, and there was plenty of that last night.\n\nWe didn’t go too obscure in BrungStrum 4, tackling only songs that we have done before. Some, like Blame it on me, It’s all about you, and Somewhere only we know are now quite respectably in our repertoire; others, such as Fidelity, Somebody I used to know, Viva la vida and Roar will all take a bit more work before we took them on the road, but they are definitely moving in the right direction. Coordinating strum pattern and singing for Vvia la vida is a trick worth perfecting.\n\nThe Bumper Book oddities took a bit more effort: Why do fools fall in love, When you walk in the room, and The night has a thousand eyes all have their merits, but we didn’t really know them very well. Streets of London and Will you still love me tomorrow were ok, but Those were the days my friend is hard to sing and play without it going either very silly or very Cossack, or both. I fear we failed, but, I repeat, chaos breeds laughter, which is a good thing. On the plus side, Wonderful tonight went well despite the fact that I don’t ever recall us playing it.\n\nNext week is a normal week. It would be good to have more than a couple of people’s selections to choose from. See what you can do. Right, now that we have had Halloween and Bonfire Night, it’s time to sneak up on Christmas. For our own do, I suggest one of two options: we simply play an evening (or part evening) of Christmassy songs on the last session before Christmas, which would be the 18th December. This can be accompanied by seasonal offerings in the form of mince pies, cake, tinselly outfits and random festive hugs (put me down - you don’t know where I’ve been). If we are happy with that, then I will circulate a new song book within a couple of weeks. The other option is something wilder, more creative and generally fabulous that one of you would need to invent, organise and arrange. If you are up for that, brilliant. Just let us know. OK. I am expecting a Silent night response. I’ll get on with that song book, shall I?\n\nHowever, we have also been invited to take part in a “Cheesy Christmas Sing-a-long” at the Wellington Arms in Bedford on the afternoon of Sunday 22nd. If you are up for that, then let us know. Lisa will be organising it as part of a fund-raising day for Bedford Hospice. It seems like a good cause and an excuse to do something slightly different. I think we’d be providing the musical backing for the pub regulars, who will have songbooks and are all expected to bring cheese. And why not?\n\nBefore all that, we have open mic on 26th November. As usual, anything goes, except apologies. You could even test audience resilience with a Christmas number if you wanted to.\n\nAll the best\"\n\nFrom the 6th November Meeting:\n\n\"It was good to see 26 or 27 of us last night enjoying music from two lists. We had Some challenging numbers from Joy’s BrungStrum5.3 selection and easier fare from the Gig Book from Jo. We were also joined for the first time by Paloma and Tom –welcome both.\n\nWe started with Super Trouper – not perhaps up there with Mamma Mia as Abba’s finest, but we made a reasonable stab at that and the Stuck in the Middle with you. Sit Down and Shotgun both behaved before we stumbled over Minnie the Moocher and Lucky Lucky Me. I think both are worth pursuing. Killing Me Softly could easily find itself in next year’s Gig Book as we sing and play it well, although we could perhaps hone our collective enthusiasm by singing some verses softer than others so that the song really builds. If we decide to take that into performance mode, then there will be plenty of time to practise.\n\nJackson is one of those songs that we just do. It’s so simple that I think we could make more of it. Listen to the Hillbilly Moon Explosion’s version to see what I mean – there is no reason to slavishly follow the originals for any of our songs, especially when the original artist had the lack of foresight not to use ukuleles.\n\nI Will Survive could be a Gig Book contender, I reckon. It’s at least as much a crowd-pleaser as YMCA and it’s quite fun to play. We’ll perhaps continue to hold I Am A Cider Drinker for cider festivals and similar. Oo-arr! Don’t Think Twice is a great song when we get into it, and we made a better first of Come on Eileen than we have before but it’s never going to be easy.\n\nOver all, there is a lot in BS5.3. There are plenty more songs that we can get to grips with and some that already look like they will become firm favourites. That’s as it should be, as you all contributed to its creation.\n\nNot surprisingly, our Gig Book songs went well, although just because we know them quite well is no reason not to practise. That way, for example, we’ll probably all remember how many choruses end Leaving on a Jet Plane or how to coordinate kazoo, uke and voice to best effect on Urban Spaceman.\n\nOne thing we didn’t try was Dave S’s Cream tribute. Rex has supplied a version whose layout may be simpler to get our heads around. It’s the same, but easier. I have attached it here and if we don’t try it next week, we can let Ginger Baker rest in peace.\n\nLists or notes for next week will be welcome as usual and don’t forget to carry on barking your open mic contributions into your hairdryers and shaving mirrors over coming weeks – 27th November isn’t far off. Sharp-eyed readers may note that’s the same date as UOGB play in Cambridge. Sorry UOGB, we win.\n\nSee you all next week.\"\n\nFrom the 30th October Meeting:\n\n\"Last night’s Halloween bash proved to be as silly, calorific and fun as usual. Some 21 lost souls found their way to the pub, more than half decked out in shades of witch, skull, Addams Family kitsch and other ghoul. You wouldn’t normally associate packets of Oat So Simple with Halloween, but when joined by granola etc, Rebecca’s “cereal killer” gave herself away.\n\nMusically, we got through most of the Halloween book very well, skipping just a few and perhaps thankfully stopping just shy of Zombies Just Wanna Be Loved, an ear worm that would have plagued you all the way home. Listen to this if you don’t believe me: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su1mv_CIyNQ\n\nCredit must go to Jon for having listened to Clap for the Wolfman well enough to drag us through it, and it was more than his skully make-up that put a smile on Trevor’s face at the way we tackled the Rocky Horror Show songs.\n\nFor much of the second half of the evening we had an audience bloke. He became steadily more appreciative as the evening progressed. I think by the end of his fifth or sixth pint he really loved us.\n\nI’d still like us to try The Pogues song Haunting and The Hanging Tree one day, and I think Ghost Town is one we should work on for general listening. That’s the trouble with these once-a-year songbooks: we play them annually. But just as with the Boat Book, there is nothing to stop anyone requesting one of our Halloween songs at other times – that’s how Psycho Killer ended up in BringStrum5.3.\n\nWe should also thank everyone for bringing assorted sweetmeats, including zombie fingers, soul cakes, mince pies and chocolate eyeballs and for the effort that so many of you went to by dressing up for the occasion.\n\nNext week, we’ll be back to usual and so we’ll be looking for song choices. Anything from a list of 15 songs emailed to me before next week to beer-mat suggestions on the night will do. We’ll also have a go at the Cream song I sent out last week. It’s not as complex as it first looks, but it somehow didn’t seem right to tackle a tribute song among all our other unfamiliar fare yesterday. The next non-standard evening will be our Open Mic on 27th November, as a 7pm start. You have plenty of time to practise Zombies Just Wanna Be Loved before then.\n\nUntil next week, stay spooky.\"\n\nFrom the 23rd October Meeting:\n\n\"There are moments at Ukulele Bedford that you really shouldn’t have missed. I gather our first Bedford Beer Festival gig was a stormer (I did miss that one); last year in Esquires was excellent (check it out on YouTube); and for anecdote potential, who could forget the fete at Cotton End where we sang from the back of a lorry to the sonic accompaniment of a stall where people could smash crockery for a quid and where we were interrupted not only to have raffle tickets read out but also for two groups of sweetly incompetent five-year-old trombone player farting single notes into their instruments with a James Bond backing track . . .\n\nI could continue, but suffice it to say that last night’s Open Mic was one of those occasions that makes the admin worthwhile. We had several of the usual suspects – David, Ian, Lydia, Mike – all doing their songs respectably and then first-timer Rob stepped up nervously to announce that he was going to sing a Bryan Adams song and dedicate it to his wife. Rob did well. Heaven, indeed. Rob has been playing for little over a year and certainly struggled with basic chords when he joined us. Now he can laugh at Bb and make a stage his own. Wonderful stuff.\n\nAfter the Open Mic, we slipped into fairly familiar songs from BrungStrums 4 and 5.3 before retiring with the comfortable slippers and briar pipe of the Bumper Book. There were 21 one of us there, including the welcome returns of Lisa and Lydia, but with neither Martin’s bass nor Jon and Trevor’s guiding voices, we kept to fairly safe ground and made it through mostly unscathed. Notable was a gentler version of Will You – a song I am keen for us to do well – Tainted Love, Diana and Happy Together. I think we went from 1912 to at least 2016. If there’s one thing beyond criticism these days, it has to be the breadth of our choices.\n\nAlso beyond criticism would be the bread pudding Jo brought. Apparently, she and her brother are in competition to reproduce their mother’s recipe. Comparisons may well be odious, but Jo’s version is sublime.\n\nNext week, blood will out. Or if not blood, then perhaps ectoplasm, green ooze or just pumpkin slime. It’s Halloween, so it’s time to get (mock) scared. Feel free to dress like pumpkins, vampires, werewolves, ghosts, ukulele players or whatever other scary apparition takes your fancy, and all spooky victuals will also be gratefully received. We’ll be using this songbook from the website: http://ukulelebedford.co.uk/files/UkuleleBedfordHalloweenSongbook2018.pdf It’s the same one as last year, but not the one from previous years that had a similar title. Check your device. If your Spookelele songbook doesn’t have Dig, Gravedigger, Dig on it then update to the new one. And if you get a chance to listen to some of the lesser-known songs before next week that would be great. There are some good songs there that would be a shame to bypass for another year. Others, of course, are just plain silly, but you’ll have to listen and play them all to sort one from ‘tother.\n\nFinally, we missed playing a tribute to Ginger Baker recently, having chosen not to play Strange Brew ever again. Dave S has supplied the attached Sunshine Of Your Love to remedy this lapse in respect. Dave describes it as a bit of a challenge, so you may want to practise before next week. Give it a try, but don’t fret if you think it’s beyond you. There will be plenty of easier fare to get stuck into.\n\nI look forward to seeing you all next week. It will be good. Come along and help us banish the evil spirits of Halloween with song and silliness.\"\n\nFrom the 16th October Meeting:\n\n\"Last night, the 17 or so of us present included a visiting grandfather/grandson duo from Glasgow and a chap with Marion that I didn’t get a chance to say hello to – “Hello, sir” – which at least saves me the embarrassment of not having talked to him before if he has been with us for weeks. We were in good voice, with the first half being mainly old faithfuls from the Bumper Book, ranging from 59th Street Bridge Song and Eight Days a Week to Blue Skies and Bye Bye Blackbird. Those two, along with The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea later in the evening probably had the most chords, but because we used to play them more regularly, certainly weren’t the most difficult songs of the evening. We ended the first half with a very creditable Under the Boardwalk, a song we haven’t played for yonks (as no one under 50 says at all).\n\nWe spent the entire second half in the Boat Book, with predictably mixed results. We Are Sailing went fine until near the end, where we encountered the same issues that nearly scuppered its inclusion in our Pirate Day contribution two years back. We cracked that one through practice then and could do again, but it’s clearly not fixed in the memory. Sitting on the Dock of the Bay was good, as was The Tide is High/Rudy. Rock the Boat was…rocky, but bearable, and we actually played the whole of Captain of Your Ship for the first time. I like it, but I suspect I am in the minority. We ended with a suitably confident Sloop John B, having been in singing form and playing well all evening.\n\nNext week, we start early with the Open Mic for the first half hour. See us there to perform from 7pm and then we will have our usual session from 7.30pm. I want our Open Mic sessions to be as warm, welcoming and potentially forgiving as possible. For performers, that means no apologies about anything, from missed chords or fluffed lyrics to just being too damned good for the rest of us to hear. For the audience, that means no hint of mockery around competence, but praise for having the guts to get up there and try. As well as being good for the individual performing, Open Mic is good for the group: we get to hear new songs often (although there is no reason why you couldn’t perform one of our group faves), we discover more about our members, and we give confidence to singers which in turn helps with our gigs. Come and give it a try and let’s make it the most open-hearted ukulele Open Mic around.\n\nSee you next week.\"\n\nFrom the 9th October Meeting:\n\n\"Last night the 21 of us started with some of the older Gig Book favourites. Mostly, as you would expect, they went fine, but at one point I found myself forgetting Bb7 in a way that I wouldn’t if we played them more regularly. It just goes to show that however well you think you know a song, practice is what proves it.\n\nAfter that we headed into my little collection of Post-it notes, scraps of paper and cards with songs on. That started with Losing My Religion which provoked all sorts of other suggestions from BrungStrum2, before moving into BrungStrum 4 with Viva La Vida among others. I think we are really starting to get the rhythm on that song and it sounds good and different. Perhaps it’s a candidate for our 2020 Gig Book.\n\nFrom there it was BrungStrum 5.3, with a slightly more mixed result, again as may be expected from the newer tunes. Most people just don’t get Angel of the Morning, which I think is a shame, but better than the Avicii song that we baulked at entirely. Moonlight Shadow went well and although A Whiter Shade of Pale went reasonably for massed ukuleles, it doesn’t really hold water as a uke song.\n\nWe had our tribute moment for Kim Shattuck with our version of Kim Wilde’s Kids in America, which the Muffs covered in the Clueless movie soundtrack – that is one of those tribute songs that could easily find its way into our repertoire in due course.\n\nThe evening ended with a rousing kazoo-tastic St Francisco Blues, where we induced one or two newer players into the joys of playing two instruments at once (while I am writing this, I have the Muffs Kids in America playing in the background, and reckon that the guitar solo could easily transfer to kazoos – just saying).\n\nNext week we’ll be needing more music on bits of paper or a full playlist, as usual, before heading in to the storm that is Open Mic the following week. It should be good. You should be there.\n\nI know it’s rude to mention the C word before Halloween or Bonfire Night, but if you fancy a playalong Christmas session with George Hincliffe's Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain, then head to the Cambridge Corn Exchange on 29th November – but get your tickets first. It could be very popular. Thanks to Dave S for alerting us to this wheeze.\n\nFinally, when I have a bunch of song suggestions on scraps of paper in front of me, I tend to chop between them so as to reduce the amount of time finding and opening new books. When we finish with one scrap, I turn it over and take it home to help with this write up. I was somewhat surprised to find the image below on the back of one of them when I got home. Was it a coded request for Something in the Air? Or Ring of Fire? Or perhaps something by Pink? Whichever, more serving suggestions are required for next week.\"\n\nFrom the 2nd October Meeting:\n\n\"Heavy traffic and perhaps the cooler autumn weather contributed to a slow start last night but we eventually reached 19 players and warmed ourselves nicely with a decent set of songs.\n\nWe started with Mrs Robinson and My Girl from the Bumper Book and continued with a few more M’s before giving Souvenir1 a close examination. As usual, this included not quite mastering Mr Blue Sky and remembering just how many words there are in Lying Eyes. A lot.\n\nAfter the break, we managed a half-hearted and half-speed tribute to the late Barrie Masters, lead singer from the energetic Eddie and the Hot Rods, by playing half of Anything You Wanna Do. I thought I had printed the whole thing, but my brain must have been only half-thinking.\n\nWe then picked out one or two songs from most of the BrungStrums, except 5.3, finishing with L.O.V.E. We had enough bits of paper and song requests for me to try not to lose one or two for next week, but we’ll need more. You know what to do.\n\nNext week will be another normal week, which is no bad thing, and then we’ll start gearing up for Open Mic on 23rd October and our Halloween bash on 30th. Expect prosthetics and pumpkins.\n\nFinally, especially for those of you not on Facebook, it’s worth saying that our performance last Saturday at Strum Like A Pirate Day was top notch. There was good harmonisation going on, our two soloists – Rex for Galway Girl and Mike for Jammin’ – did their stuff wel,l and we all looked the part, from cartoon pirate Captain to cabin boy. We were joined on stage by a few of our less regular members, so it was good to catch up with Graham, Cath and Norman. Even if pirates and dressing up isn’t your thing, it’s good to be involved in a day that brings uke groups together to enjoy playing for our own sake. For that we have Adrian Watts of Blud Group to thank – and David for UB’s part. No doubt the date for next year’s SLAP will be available to ink into your diaries soon.\n\nSee you next week.\"\n\nFrom the 25th September Meeting:\n\n\"Despite having 18 of us in the pub last night, it felt a little empty, perhaps because we lacked some of our stronger voices. Nevertheless, we made a good fist of most of BrungStrum3 and a fine selection from BrungStrum1 before heading into the calm waters of our Piratical selection.\n\nOur preparation for Saturday’s Strum Like Pirate Day seems fine - it will be a gas. Come along. We are on at 12.30, in full pirate regalia.\n\nOne or two people only had our three special songs rather than the whole of our proposed set. Please make sure you have the file “SLAP 19 UB Playbook” on your tablet as there won’t be time to chop and change between the gig book and others on the day. It would be quicker to share music. Then again, perhaps you have learned all those songs by heart now . . . me neither. This book starts with Bad Moon Rising/Deeper and Down, followed by Ex’s and Oh’s, ending with Pirates, Tramps and Thieves. If you think your book has only three songs in it, you will be disappointed/confused on the day.\n\nYou can find the correct book either attached to an email from me on 9th September or in the files section of our Facebook Group page. If you can’t get to it there or have lost that email and need it for Saturday, email me and I’ll send it to you – I don’t want to clutter everyone’s inbox with it a second time.\n\nAfter Saturday’s SLAP we have a few free weeks until the Open Mic starts again (23rd October), so it would be great if someone could come up with a playlist or you all come armed with a few songs. Why not think simply of your favourite two songs that you have ever played with us – however often or rarely we have played them before - and suggest those. Consider it a “Family’s Favourites.” We all know what some people’s top songs may be, but I bet there would be a few surprises, even within the familiar. Sounds good? Come and make it so.\n\nUntil next week – AAAARRRHHHH!!!!\"\n\nFrom the 18th September Meeting:\n\n\"There were about 16 of us on Wednesday. I'm not quite sure because I ran out of fingers, but sometimes less is more and I thought the evening was pretty excellent. As always we managed to choose some that we play regularly and some that we don't. That is always a nice mixture, I think.\n\nWe started out in Brungstrum 4 and visited the likes of (amongst others) Amy Winehouse, George Ezra, Twenty One Pilots, Rag'n'Bone Man, Lily Allen, Gabriella Cilmi and Imelda May before moving to the Bumper Book for the two chord 'Dance the night Away', the asthma-inducing 'Day Trip To Bangor' (my son went to Uni there and it never had the same effect when we visited him!) and 'Don't Fence Me In' which was originally done by Roy Rogers - presumably with backing vocals from his horse Trigger! Once that nonsense was out of the way, we went back to Brungstrum 5.3 to finish the ones we'd missed last week. From there we had a go at Abracadabra, Drift Away, Hey There Delilah, How Do You Do It and Sunday Girl (plus a few more that I have probably forgotten). We had an enthusiastic pub-goer watching us most of the evening - by the end he was joining in with those he knew. Good stuff!\n\nOne of the attendees was Rebecca who has given me a flyer to post - as well as her undoubted ukulele talents, she is in a Gilbert and Sullivan troupe (not as in Pan's People a la Gilbert O'Sullivans 'Get Down' - that's a completely different thing!) - who are doing a production of Iolanthe. Please find it attached - I am sure it;ll be great if that's your thing.\n\nI won't be with you next week - but I am sure whoever is MCing the evening would love you to provide some song choices on bits of paper. Try to find a song with something different - a picky bit, a quiet bit, parts, split between male/female, a different rhythm, much slower or faster, anything like that - to provide a bit of 'texture' for the evening. Or just pick what you like - all is good.\n\nKeep strumming!\"\n\nFrom the 11th September Meeting:\n\n\"It's always nice to welcome a new member to the group, and last night we said hello to a new Sue (hello Sue) who had travelled over from Wellingborough to see us, and had even managed to find the pub car park. I think Sue enjoyed it and hope we see her again soon, she seemed to be keeping up remarkably well whenever I glanced over.\n\nThere were 19 of us in total - certainly enough to make a decent noise! The first part of the evening was dedicated to Brungstrum 5.3 and there was a lot to be enthusiastic about here. Two Taking Heads songs (And She Was / Psycho Killer), some new favourites (Do You Love Me / Galway Girl / Summer In The City) and some more laid back Americana (Bottle of Wine / The Gambler / After Midnight) interspersed with New Order, Half Man Half Biscuit, Johnny and June Cash, Aretha Franklin, Kirsty Maccoll and many, many more. Some of these have little picky bits and some have different parts, which makes for variety. Perhaps some homework might be to look through the existing songs, select one that has a picked into and learn it. You can then suggest it and you will be the star of the show when we play it - variety is good and the more people doing different little bits the better. As a whole I thought we made a very good fist of many of the new songs and with a bit of repetition many of them will soon become group favourites. Note to self - starting Paul McCartneys 'Dance Tonight' on a note slightly adjacent to the one the writer intended might help!!!\n\nThe second part of the evening was taken up with a selection from the Bumper Book - encompassing some knowns, some slightly unknowns and a couple that turned out to be more known that we thought, and finishing up with a rousing 'City Of New Orleans'. We didn't get through all the songs suggested on the lists given to me, but don't worry there wasn't any editing being done by me (just incompetence!) - the ones we didn't get to will be played next week.\n\nIn case you want to have a practice, these will be:\n\nBS5.3 (Abracadabra, Drift Away, Hey There Delilah, How Do You Do It, Sunday Girl, Venus)\n\nBS4 (Back To Black, Blame it On Me, House Of Gold, Human, Road Runner)\n\nBumper Book (My Girl, Slow Boat To China, Streets Of London)\n\nSo have a quick look at any that are unfamiliar. We will need some more, so a few more bits of paper would be good - parts of the SLAP book might make an appearance I guess?\n\nUntil next week\"\n\nFrom the 4th September Meeting:\n\n\"We were in fine voice again last night, helped in part by the return of Lydia on her first post-baby visit, but also on account of playing stuff we know well. We started with the SLAP playbook that includes our three special songs and a few more from the Gig Book. All seems in order there.\n\nWe then moved into BrungStrum 5.3 for Addicted to Love, Breakfast at Tiffany’s and Annie I’m Not Your Daddy among others until the break.\n\nAfter half time, we slipped into the Bumper Book for Trail of the Lonesome Pine, complete with obligatory falsetto shrieking, and then World Without Love, Runaround Sue, Proud Mary and a great rendition of California Dreamin’.\n\nWe finished the night with Paint it Black and a respectable Viva la Vida – an ambitious but successful ending.\n\nDespite there being only 18 of us, I think we all had a good night and I look forward to doing it all again in a week’s time. I dare say we’ll top up our Pirate song skills again, but otherwise we’ll be looking for more scribbles on beer mats, post-it notes and similar, or a more extensive playlist for the evening if you provide one.\n\nFor those of you pining away for Open Mic opportunities (and I have lost track of whether you need to book in for the SLAP Open Mic, if interested), ours will return on 23rd October, giving you plenty of time to hone your skills.\n\nI am going to introduce a new rule for our Open Mics: no apologies. We all know how hard it is to get up and sing and play in front of even such a sympathetic audience as ours and yet we make excuses for missing chords, forgetting words and generally fluffing things even before we perform, and however well it goes. So from now on, we will assume positive intent on behalf of everyone involved even more so than before. When you get up, you can introduce the song in any way you like, except for saying “Sorry but…” or “If I had more time…” or “It’s not like the original because…”. If you have only been playing the song for a week and even had your goldfish turn their backs on your practice, that’s fine. Tell us the tale, but don’t apologise for it, and let us enjoy your fish-bothering rendition. The hope and expectation is that by focusing solely on the positive aspects of your performance, it will be better. I have seen this work elsewhere. It changes the mindset of teh performer; it’s worth a go.\n\nRemember: Open Mic on 23rd October – all welcome, any song, no apologies.\n\nSee you next time\"\n\nFrom the 28th August Meeting:\n\n\"Some 20 of us last night made almost enough sound to overcome the slightly irritating presence of a couple of drinkers – the same noisy two who had been there a few weeks ago. Anyone would think it was a pub. This did mean that we sang up (except for yours truly, who coughed and croaked a bit instead and strummed like a demon) and sang well. We started with our three SLAP day songs, where giving Mike his day in the sun for a solo during Jammin’ seemed to work much better than trying to coordinate 20 people to give single strums on the off beat. Remember, SLAP isn’t that far off now, so make sure you have 28th September fixed in your diary for some hearty fun.\n\nWe moved into BrungStrum5.3 for the rest of the evening, building on a skeleton of songs provided by Rex. There really is some great stuff in that book and we are gradually getting nearer to proving it.\n\nParticular highlights were the two split songs Let It Be and Summer Nights, a gloriously rowdy rendition of I Will Survive (there should be no other way), the near-gig-ready Do You Love Me and the opposition-drowning Galway Girl, which included a Rex solo turned up to 11.\n\nThe collection of songs on bits of paper followed by requests from the floor works well, but so does the flexible playlist approach that we used during the spring. One supposed advantage of the latter was that people liked to see what was coming up so that they could practise. How many of you really did? I rarely did, but perhaps some of you found that more useful. If so, then give us a list of about 15 songs from any books and we’ll build an evening around it. Failing that, I’ll be looking for scraps of paper again next week. Whichever route we take, you know it will be a good evening, so come and join us.\"\n\nFrom the 21st August Meeting:\n\n\"Another relaxed evening last night, with 19 of us visiting songbooks old and new.\n\nWe started off in Brungstrum 1, Jo having provided a short list. As usual we managed to find other things to play as we went through. I think the major triumph in this section was Mr Blue Sky. We managed to keep a steady pace throughout, and ended up at roughly the same speed we started. This particular tune is notorious for speeding up (apparently not just us, ELO used to do it too!).\n\nWe moved into the Part 1d book (we must do some renaming and consolidating sometime!) for 'Eleanor', 'Stray Cat Strut', 'Budapest', 'Raining In My Heart' and a rare 'Something Stupid'. All of those went well, and I wonder if it's worth taking those (and maybe a few more), dumping the ones we NEVER play and adding the decent ones from the Souvenir Book, Boat Book, Rocky Horror Book etc) to reduce the amount of songbooks we have and produce an 'all killer no filler' volume. Worth considering.\n\nThen to Brungstrum 3 for a quick SLAP practice of 'Jammin' then 'Land Down Under' and 'Rhinestone Cowboy', Brungstrum 4 for 'Blame It On Me', 'Its All About You' and 'Somewhere Only We Know', Brungstrum 5 for 'Bus Stop', 'Top of the World', 'Tubthumping' (not convinced that's a song for massed ukuleles really!), an excellent 'Galway Girl' (with amplified lead uke playing by Rex), 'Unchained Melody', 'There's a Guy Works Down the Chip Shop...', 'Vincent' and 'Wichita Linesman' ending up with 'Country Roads' from the gig book to complete the evening.\n\nI've listed the songs I remember us playing (there were others) deliberately, since very few of them are in the gig book but the vast majority of them could be with very little work. 'Galway Girl' is a shoo-in for the next revision. Great stuff.\n\nWe didn't play all of the Strum Like A Pirate Book tunes - we will next week. So make sure you have the three songs - Jammin', Pirates Tramps and Thieves and Sea of Heartbreak - that have been circulated. If you don't have them, let me know and I'll send the file again.\n\nWe don't have any more little lists left to act as seeds for next week's crop of tunes so please bring your suggestions next Wednesday.\n\nUntil then - if you don't pick it, you will never get better\"\n\nFrom the 14th August Meeting:\n\n\"Last night saw 25 of us take a bit of a wander down memory lane. We started out by playing Bumper Book songs as selected by Colin, who had provided a short six song list last week that we didn't get around to. As is sometimes the case, scrolling between the first one (on page 100 or so) and the last one (in the 300's) produced lots of \"Oooh, we haven't played that one for a while\"s. So we played them.\n\nDespite mischievous suggestions of 'Jolene' - apparently amusing because I have to sing it an octave down - and various oddities about animals or window cleaners - when challenged Dave refused to do any of them solo! - we managed to avoid those pitfalls and successfully play all the ones that weren't vetoed. It's quite revealing that a few of them were songs we'd tried in the past and failed at - but last night they were plain sailing. It shows an increased confidence and ability in the group I feel.\n\nWe then switched into the gig book and played a selection of the ones we do well, finishing with Ian's request for 'Ukulele Lady'. I think everyone enjoyed the evening thoroughly (which is the point of it, after all!). It's worth remembering that some of the gig book songs were once 'new ones' that took a while to bed in, so it's a case of constant renewal of the repertoire.\n\nWe had intended to play through the Strum Like A Pirate songs, but with the absence of a few of the leading buccaneers we decided to put that off until next week.\n\nSo - next week. More suggestions on bits of paper please, probably from other books than the Bumper Book if possible (variety being the spice of life as they say) and we'll do the piratey thing.\n\nSee you next week!\"\n\nFrom the 7th August Meeting:\n\n\"A slightly delayed roundup this week, as I thought it could also include the Moggerhanger gig.\n\nWednesday saw 20 or so of us initially running through the songbook we had decided to use for Moggerhanger - the one put together for the Esquires gig. It's sometimes quite easy to forget how well we can play the songs we have got 'gig ready' and quite reassuring when we play them that they do indeed sound very presentable! Various smatterings of applause from other pub goers confirmed that we were doing more than just OK. After running through the set, we moved on to some selections from the newly released Brungstrum 5.3 - it's nice to see some of the new songs become ones that are requested on a regular basis!\n\nWe completed the evening with a rendition of 'Galway Girl' - as the most Irish thing we have - in response to a request from a pub patron, who herself seemed to have imbibed quite a quantity of 'joy de vivre' and would have really, really"
