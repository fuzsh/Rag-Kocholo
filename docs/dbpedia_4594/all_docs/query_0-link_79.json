        "text": "Everything in motherhood is a phase. Take it hour by hour when things feel overwhelming. And remember the old cliche of trying to be present and let go of how it “should” be. It’s gone in a flash and the sleeplessness all fades away and suddenly they are big and don’t want to have 3am cuddles and fall asleep on your chest anymore. It’s been a huge lesson for me to let go of how I, or others, think things “should “ be going and accept and love exactly what is.\n\nChildren: CLASSIC CHILDREN'S SEERSUCKER NIGHTSHIRT £48\n\nGabriella : GREEN STRIPE MITFORD PYJAMAS £145\n\nBecoming a mother myself has fundamentally shifted my relationship with my own mother. Since we both moved up a generation it’s brought a lot of new challenges in our relationship but also a beautiful depth and understanding between us. I have such compassion now for how she was always doing her best and I try to accept that about myself too.\n\nI think generally I am doing things quite differently to how I was raised but one thing I have carried forward is my mother’s stories. She is a brilliant story teller and would make up wonderful funny tales for us. I am not so good at this, so she sends me voice notes with stories for the boys to play at bedtime or whenever I need a minute... They love them, as do I, laughing out loud listening to her voice in our home even when she isn’t here.\n\nChildren: CLASSIC CHILDREN'S SEERSUCKER NIGHTSHIRT £48\n\nGabriella : GREEN STRIPE MITFORD PYJAMAS £145\n\nWe wanted to raise our children somewhere beautiful and with more community. And those are the things I love about being in Somerset. I really don’t miss London at all but I do miss my friends: the women who have known me before I was a mother, and some since I was a child. I wish I could see them more but the beauty of those relationships is that when I do see them it’s like we were together only yesterday.\n\nGabriella : GREEN STRIPE MITFORD PYJAMAS £145"
