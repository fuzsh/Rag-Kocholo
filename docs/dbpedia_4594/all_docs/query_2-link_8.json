        "text": "MUSICIAN-CUM-MODEL Roo Panes proves that you can't always get what you want in the love stakes even if you are a Burberry campaign star. The 23-year-old was photographed alongside actress Gabriella Wilde for the brand's autumn/winter 2012-13 advertisements - but that wasn't enough for him.\n\n\"I'm glad Gabriella's the one I did it with,\" he said. \"She's a really nice girl with a good sense of humour. And she's gorgeous. She has a boyfriend, though - gutted.\"\n\nSEE THE COUPLE POSE FOR BURBERRY\n\nDorset-born Panes first approached Burberry last year after he sent a \"shot-in-the-dark email\" to the brand introducing himself. He received a response a few days later requesting a meeting. Before he knew it, he had been cast in the label's new campaign, shot by Mario Testino.\n\n\"I turned up at the shoot straight from music tour with my messy hair but they thought it was cool,\" he told the Evening Standard. \"I even got to keep my beard. The whole thing was completely surreal. There were smoke machines and cranes everywhere. I don't know why, but I wasn't really nervous about it. Instead of panicking, which wouldn't have done any good, I just got on with it. It was the most fun three days ever.\"\n\nHe also shed some light on his unusual first name, a derivative of the energetic kangaroo in children's book Winnie The Pooh.\n\n\"My real name is Andrew. When I was a kid I threw a stick into the river and fell in, like Roo does in Winnie The Pooh,\" he explained. \"I've not been able to shake the nickname off since then.\"\n\nSEE ALL THE BEHIND-THE-SCENES CAMPAIGN ACTION\n\nYOU SHOULD SEE: Next season's key campaigns..."
