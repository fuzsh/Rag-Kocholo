        "text": "In This Article\n\nOrigin, Meaning And History Of Gabriella\n\nGabriella is of Spanish and Italian origin and is the feminine form of Gabriel. The name comes from the Hebrew word ‘Gavriel.’ According to Hebrew theology, ‘Gever’ means strength or firmness, while ‘El’ refers to God. Hence, the name means ‘God is my strength.’ You may find it interesting that in the Abrahamic religions, the masculine representation of Gabriella, Gabriel was the archangel who was entitled to deliver the will of God to the ordinary people.\n\nIn Hebrew culture, Gabriel is considered a messenger of God and is mentioned in the Old Testament as helping the prophet Daniel interpret his visions. In the New Testament, he is the one to inform Zechariah about the birth of John and Mary about the birth of Jesus. Gabriel is revered as a saint in several Christian sects such as Eastern Orthodoxy, Anglicanism, and Roman Catholicism. In Islam, the holy text Quran is believed to have been dictated by Gabriel to Muhammad.\n\nAlthough an old name, Gabriella did not become prevalent in the English speaking world until the 20th century. Furthermore, the name has been used for boys too, such as Gabriele, Gabriela, Gabby, Gabe, and Gabie. For example, the Germans or Bulgarians use Gabriela, which is spelled as Gabrielle in Dutch.\n\nAdditionally, the name has an influence on film culture. Remember the classic ‘Little Mermaid?’ The animated series had the character Gabriella, who is the Latina mermaid. The name was again used to define the character Gabriela, the red hummingbird in the American animated tv-series ‘Danger Rangers’. You will find it in the popular TV show ‘Sid the Scientist’ as Gabriela Ramirez, who was portrayed as the most sensible and mature kid of all. The American hit sitcom ‘The Sopranos’ had Gabriella Dante who is married to the DiMeo crime family consigliere Silvio Dante. Perhaps the most well-known of them all is Gabriella Montez, the female lead in the famous American teen drama series ‘High School Musical.’\n\nHow To Pronounce Gabriella?\n\n‘Gabriella’ In QR Code\n\nNotable People Named Gabriella\n\nThis section covers people who have made the name Gabriella famous with their contributions in various fields.
