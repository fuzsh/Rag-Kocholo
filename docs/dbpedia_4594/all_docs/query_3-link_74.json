Learn more at vrc.com.\n\nJace Lacob: Iâ€™m Jace Lacob, and youâ€™re listening to MASTERPIECE Studio.\n\nWhen entitled heiress Caroline Penvenen first appeared at the beginning of the second season of Poldark, she was anything but common.\n\nCLIP:\n\nCaroline: My darling little Horace has had two fits and now heâ€™s barely breathing. Will you attend on him please?\n\nDwight: Your dog? Your footman made a mistake. It would be a farrier youâ€™d send for.\n\nCaroline: Itâ€™s not my custom to imply a horse doctor for Horace. I want the best advice and Iâ€™m willing to pay for it.\n\nJace: Caroline was breathtakingly beautiful, staggeringly wealthy â€” and unbelievably bored.\n\nCLIP:\n\nRay: How long are you intending to stay?\n\nCaroline: That depends. If my little Horace and I get bored, we may be forced to return to London.\n\nJace: But as her time in Cornwall continued, Caroline changed. She transformed from a spoiled, selfish girl calling in a doctor to attend to her sick pug into a generous and anonymous local benefactor. She paid for oranges for the scurvy-ridden poor and loaned the nearly destitute Nampara Poldarks the money to hold on to their home and land.\n\nYou could blame the Cornish way of life for Carolineâ€™s change, but you could also blame her forbidden love for Doctor Dwight Enys. She eloped with the good doctor in this weekâ€™s Season 3 premiere.\n\nCLIP:\n\nGABRIELLA WILDE Thereâ€™s a lot of ups and downs for Caroline and Dwight in this season and it is not a simple journey at all. But there is hope.\n\nJace: Gabriella Wilde plays Caroline on Poldark, and she spoke with MASTERPIECE producer Barrett Brountas about her characterâ€™s surprise elopement and other dramatic prospects awaiting us in the upcoming third season of Poldark.\n\nBarret Brountas: And weâ€™re joined this week by Gabriella Wilde who plays Caroline Penvenen, also Caroline Enys, in Series 3 of Poldark. Welcome Gabriella.\n\nGabriella Wilde: Hi.\n\nBarrett: So the Season 3 premiere was a roller coaster of emotions for Caroline as she married her beloved Dwight Enys and lost her beloved uncle, Ray Penvenen. Can you describe what Dwight and Caroline have overcome in order to arrive at this point in their relationship, and what in their characters makes it work?\n\nGabriella: I think Dwight and Caroline have overcome a lot kind of the social stereotypes. The expectations on them of who they should marry and where their lives should go. For Caroline, I think particularly she has totally gone against the grain and done exactly what she wanted which is very her nature, being so single-minded and strong-willed. And I think that is what Dwight loves in her, you know he loves her for all that she is and nothing to do with where she comes from. And I think that goes the same for him. She loves him for he is even though where he comes from is something totally alien to her too. And I think probably thatâ€™s also her fascination with him. Heâ€™s unlike anyone sheâ€™s ever met or come across.\n\nBarrett: Were you surprised by how their romance evolved and and even more so with the audience reaction to it?\n\nGabriella: I mean their romance is surprising. I think, you know, you can see from when you first meet Caroline sheâ€™s sort of pretty prickly with most men, seems to be bored by most of them as well. And so I think when she meets Dwight you sort of see this sort of curiosity perhaps in his what appears to be kind of disdain for her. And I think at first it appears almost a challenge for her just to kind of toy with him. And then it turns into something a lot softer and for some reason he manages to sort of crack her and sort of make her vulnerable. And a lot softer and itâ€™s itâ€™s a really kind of beautiful relationship to watch in that way. And then it is unexpected.\n\nBarrett: The death of Carolineâ€™s uncle Ray Penvenen marked the final appearance of actor John Nettles. And what was that like for you to film those final scenes with him?\n\nGabriella: It was really sad. John is the most charming wonderful man and I had a lot of fun filming of him through the second series. And I think his relationship with Caroline is really wonderfulâ€¦itâ€™s incredibly tender. You know it has that formality of those times yet you can see the kind of love between them and he is all sheâ€™s ever really had. And so to watch him go and have to do that scene with him dying is itâ€™s incredibly sad especially with the timing of her and just being married. But I guess thatâ€™s sort of quite true to life the sort of bittersweet sort of peaks and troughs that we all go through.\n\nCLIP:\n\nRay: Can you ever forgive me?\n\nCaroline: Uncle Ray, what if I told you there was nothing to forgive?\n\nRay: Oh, my dear girl. My dear, dear girl.\n\nBarrett: So Caroline loses her uncle and then almost immediately loses Dwight after his ship the Travail disappears in a skirmish with the French. So how does that loss shape her going forward?\n\nGabriella: Well I think thereâ€™s thatâ€™s a sort of huge moment and turning point for Caroline. I think you know she is very young especially in Series 2. She goes on quite a long journey and she grows up a bit was kind of falling in love with the way in that relationship you know really kind of stepping out for what she wants and everything. Your first love would teach you in that way and then to so suddenly lose so much with the death of her uncle and then that kind of fear of the unknown of where Dwight is. I think itâ€™s massive for her. I think it takes away potentially a lot of the naÃ¯vetÃ© that was there in her. I think sheâ€™s definitely someone whoâ€™s known loss already. You know she was an orphan raised by her uncle. But to suddenly lose the two men in her life and her sort of grounding in that way I think is pretty catastrophic for her. But sort of true to her nature I think rather than fall apart it just hardens her up again and shuts her down which is really sad to see because I think the whole of her relationship with Dwight has been all about her opening up and becoming more vulnerable and softer and not so brittle with people. And such a closed book and I think itâ€™s a itâ€™s a sort of frightening moment for her because it can it sort of could be the end of her vulnerability in a way and her charm and I think you know you donâ€™t want her to hard because itâ€™s so wonderful to see her open and the way she does.\n\nBarrett: One thing that helps to counteract that is her close friendship with Demelza which continues to develop despite their class differences. Can you talk about that friendship and how itâ€™s developed?\n\nGabriella: Yeah I think thatâ€™s a huge thing for Caroline that one of the first things I noticed in the script when I first got them was that Caroline really in the first series I was in has no female friends â€” she didnâ€™t have any women in her life at all. And it was something I was very interested in in her character that she doesnâ€™t seem to have a relationship with women. Women donâ€™t really like her. I donâ€™t think they treat her very kindly. And I think that relationship she has with Demelza is a very interesting one and in a way maybe they are so different. And it is the only kind of woman who would accept Caroline and not sort of I think maybe shut down to her and see her as a threat because sheâ€™s an heiress and she has all this money and you know sheâ€™s Demelzaâ€™s so wonderful and open hearted that she doesnâ€™t I think present any of that towards Caroline and sort of in all this loss that happens her and Demelza form this really wonderful bond that again transcends sort of where they come from and who theyâ€™re expected to be.\n\nBarrett: So Caroline able to move seamlessly between classes and enemies and enjoys close relationships with Ross and Demelza while still maintaining social contact with Elizabeth and George. Can you talk about how she negotiates these two very different factions?\n\nGabriella: I think itâ€™s funny one that because you think you know and sheâ€™s so close with Demelza, especially in this series. How did she maintain her friendship with Elizabeth and George? But I think Caroline has been brought up to be a sort of social butterfly and charming and know how to sort of keep people onside and sheâ€™s sort of master at it while also I think annoying and being rude whenever she likes. I think the relationship with Ross and Demelza is something very true, very personal and real. And I think the relationships with George and Elizabeth is a social thing and itâ€™s something that is absolutely a part of Caroline and she will always make sure that she has those relationships and she can use them to her advantage where she needs to. But I think if push came to her kind of loyalty would always lie with Ross and Demelza.\n\nCLIP:\n\nDwight: To Ross, who conceived and executed the plan. Spirited me from Falmouth, arranged the parson.\n\nCaroline: And even brought the brideâ€™s bouquet.\n\nRoss: Demelzaâ€™s handiwork.\n\nCaroline: And the feast.\n\nBarrett: Good. And so what can you tease about where Caroline and Dwightâ€™s relationship is headed this season if in fact he does survive?\n\nGabriella: Well thereâ€™s thereâ€™s a lot of ups and downs for Caroline and Dwight in this season and it is not a simple journey at all. But there is hope, but not without a rough ride.\n\nBarrett: So now you joined Poldark at the start of the second season and what was that like for you join a cast that had already been working so closely together?\n\nGabriella: It was pretty terrifying. I was one of the only kind of new main characters that year so I definitely felt like the new girl at school. However I had heard before I signed on to the job that the cast of Poldark have a reputation for being really wonderful and genuinely all getting on and being kind of wonderful family to become part of um and itâ€™s absolutely true. Everyone was so lovely and friendly and I think everyone has a really good time filming together. Theyâ€™re all really wonderful actors and really lovely people and itâ€™s a really wonderful job to work on so my fears were quite quickly put to rest.\n\nBarrett: And when we first meet Caroline sheâ€™s the spoiled and bored â€” a young woman whose only outlets for amusement seem to be toying with Unwin and tending to Horace. Can you talk about her transformation into the woman that Dwight and viewers have come to love?\n\nGabriella: I think you know her transformation I always wanted Caroline to be seen as what I saw her for which was sheâ€™s you know sheâ€™s not a nasty person. She is not kind of jaded to the world or anything like that she is chippy at the beginning and rude and she seems spoiled.. Sheâ€™s just incredibly naive and like you said sheâ€™s bored. You know I think she has a brilliant mind. Sheâ€™s very quick. Sheâ€™s frustrated by her position in life. And sheâ€™s had a hard life. Sheâ€™s an orphan. She didnâ€™t have her parents. And as I said before as well she doesnâ€™t seem to have many women in her life. And I think potentially quite a lonely existence although a very social one. I think with Horrace as well for me that was always something that I thought was charming and funny. But at the same time quite sad I saw him as a sort of almost like a child carrying around a teddy all the time, it spoke to me of potentially her loneliness. And I think her transformation really comes from understanding that deeper layer to her. That she, when she comes to Cornwall she is presented with the opportunity to rise to the occasion to be the sort of good hearted person that she really is whilst maintaining you know her wit and her charm and you know she does enjoy to sort of stir the pot and push people and see if she can toy with them. But thereâ€™s never any malice in it. I think she just sort of likes to test people.\n\nBarrett: So what else do you think in her has spurred viewers to really take a shine to her?\n\nGabriella: I think I think first you know sheâ€™s real. You know no one is perfect just sweet or just horrible. I think we all have good and bad in us and itâ€™s itâ€™s kind of watching that in her and you know sheâ€™s also sheâ€™s funny you know and sheâ€™s bright and sheâ€™s quick and itâ€™s fun to watch a woman in those days kind of talk circles around some of them. You know I love that sometimes sheâ€™s insulting people and they donâ€™t really realize until after sheâ€™s left the conversation. You know itâ€™s fun to play a character like that. You know sheâ€™s not kind of sitting there waiting to be rescued by a man you know. Sheâ€™s very much happy to rescue herself and potentially him as well. So thatâ€™s just itâ€™s refreshing to watch you know.\n\nMASTERPIECE Studio is brought to you by Farmers Insurance and their eighty-eight years of experience helping people so that they can prepare for the unexpected.

Now what do you think her appearance tells us about her character?\n\nGabriella: I think it probably tells you that she likes to cause a stir. She likes to be noticed. You know itâ€™s itâ€™s also where sheâ€™s come from. I think itâ€™s nice you know that she arrives and sticks out and has people talking about her probably immediately. You know sheâ€™s sheâ€™s definitely not a shrinking violet. You know also sheâ€™s fun. I think she is feminine in that way and enjoys the clothes and enjoys you know she does enjoy her privilege and that way and her money. And I think itâ€™s itâ€™s sort of a fun thing you know sheâ€™s a young girl and she can so she wears wonderful things. And like I said because sheâ€™s not going to wear anything different just because sheâ€™s in Cornwall or sheâ€™s going to wear what she wants to wear.\n\nBarrett: So and while weâ€™re talking about costumes and you mentioned Horace a little bit earlier but we have to talk about Carolineâ€™s most fabulous accessory of all, Horace.\n\nGabriella: Hmm.\n\nBarrett: Even though he is the prototypical lap dog, he is like a character in his own right. So what does he mean to Caroline? What does it reveal about her character?\n\nGabriella: I think Horace is a really wonderful sort of note to Carolineâ€™s character. You know beyond the comedy of him. And the sort of image that this woman with this kind of lapdog that I think nobody else really likes except for her. You know just adds to kind of the impression she likes to give and also the kind of you know she just loves to provoke people. Horace is another tool for that in one sense. Yeah. As I said before I think for me Horace kind of revealed something else to her which was this kind of childlike sort of loneliness and softness to her that she would carry this dog everywhere with her. Itâ€™s almost like a little comfort blanket she takes despite the way she appears to be. And I think and also you know her tenderness for him she really really adores him. You know thatâ€™s her attachment. Thatâ€™s her sort of family. She doesnâ€™t have much. And I think itâ€™s a sort of wonderful thing you know to have to have this little kind of friend with her all the time. And like I said you know I think the fact that Ray and other people are not so keen is sort of kind of brilliant because I think she probably really loves that as well.\n\nBarrett: So how about for you. What was it like working with the dog who plays Horace?\n\nGabriella: It was it was I mean they always say you never work with animals but itâ€™s fine. It is interesting. It doesnâ€™t always do what you want them to. But he was a very sweet dog. And the only thing is that working with a pug theyâ€™re incredibly noisy which I think all of the sound recordings had to be scrapped for the scene that I was in with him and we had to do all of the ADR after and re-record all my lines because there was a lot of snuffling over there.\n\nBarrett: And I read that Horace was recast for Season 3. So which Horace is closer to your heart?\n\nGabriella: I think Iâ€™ve probably spent less time with Horace in Season 3 than I did in Season 2 mean he is definitely still around. But the first Horace was older, and he was also kind of almost the biggest star on the show. I think heâ€™s done bigger movies than all of us. So, so he probably had a bit of a big ego. But the second Horace was a bit younger was very sweet but Iâ€™m sure that heâ€™s way bigger than the first Horace. So I donâ€™t know if anyoneâ€™s going to notice that that, but both of them were cute.\n\nBarrett: Continuity!\n\nGabriella: I know.\n\nBarrett: And then we understand that Horace solved a very specific challenge during the filming of Season 2. Can you tell us about that?\n\nGabriella: Horace was very useful here because I was a little bit pregnant at the beginning of filming Poldark and very pregnant by the end. So Horace became more and more useful and I think again thatâ€™s why I have a lot more in Season 2. Becomes a larger and larger bump to cover. So Horace was the perfect tool for that to carry him. And I think it hopefully disguised that I was I think about eight months pregnant by the end.\n\nBarrett: And so and youâ€™re even six or seven months pregnant when you filmed a fan favorite scene, where Caroline and Dwight meet in the woods and they kiss on horseback. What was it like shooting that scene in and Poldark in general throughout your pregnancy?\n\nGabriella: It was it was a challenge. Some of it you know obviously shooting period drama pregnant is an interesting one, and especially poor Luke, who plays Dwight, having to act opposite me and they kind of look like a moving truck I think most of the time and shooting these romantic scenes was kind of bizarre while I was sort of, so pregnant, but it was it was actually a really, really positive experience. You know working and being kind of trusted to work through a pregnancy when I found out I was pregnant I had a conversation with the producers and with Debbie, the writer, and I told them, you know, I was pregnant, I was obviously going to be heavily pregnant towards the end of the shoot. And they were incredibly supportive and said, you know, if you feel like you can do it then we feel like you can, which is very refreshing in this industry. And I did. And not thought of not being able to work just because I was now a mother is, as I said, refreshing and should very much be the norm. And sadly is not.\n\nBarrett: What was it like to have your newborn son on the set with you while you were filming such an emotional season. Season 3. Was it a challenge or a relief or a little bit of both?\n\nGabriella: I think it was probably in a bit of yean all of it. I think it is sort of strange to have to go and film the scene like Rayâ€™s death scene, and actually that scene they scheduled it amazingly And so I would rush away from the set to go and feed my son and then rush back again and we usually managed to have finished that scene before I had to go. But with Rayâ€™s death scene because of timing I had to go and feed my son in the middle of shooting it so that was slightly bizarre to have to kind of be that headspace and run back see my son feed him for half an hour and then run back and sort of continue crying next to Rayâ€™s bedside.\n\nBarrett: But I have to ask I canâ€™t imagine how in these elaborate costumes you could possibly dash in and nurse a baby? How do you get out of that?\n\nGabriella: Yeah, itâ€™s not easy. But again you know the wonderful people that make Poldark you know really made it work for me. And in that respect too you know I was I was very adamant I wanted to breastfeed and that they needed to make that work for me. And they did. They had a specially designed corset. I think the amazing woman who makes all the corsets for Poldark says sheâ€™s never missed anything like it. And you know, all of my dresses, they were made so that it could happen really, so that it could all sort of happen in a half an hour and I could be back on set.\n\nBarrett: That thatâ€™s magical. I think thatâ€™s yeah incredible.\n\nGabriella: Yeah I know it was, it was.\n\nBarrett: So Luke Norris who plays Dwight Enys has said of you, â€œSheâ€™s about as blueblooded as they come so we naturally have that class divide, a social disconnect. And she, like Caroline, is wonderful and lovely and thereâ€™s much, much more to her than a cutglass accent. So in fact you are a descendant of Charles the Second, and Joanna of Castille, sister of Catherine of Aragon â€” does that lineage help you better understand aristocratic characters like Caroline?\n\nGabriella: I mean I donâ€™t know. Do you know what. I donâ€™t even know if I am? I mean someone said that before now itâ€™s like okay cool. But I have no idea if I actually am.\n\nBarrett: Okay.\n\nGabriella: But I think, yeah there is an understanding of, in a way where Caroline comes from? You know it is different itâ€™s the 18th century. I donâ€™t think my life has been anything like hers. But I think maybe I do understand the sort of perception that is put on and the expectation and yeah the assumptions that she faces. And Iâ€™ve definitely come across that I donâ€™t think itâ€™s just because of where and how Iâ€™ve grown up. I think itâ€™s for many different reasons. You know itâ€™s from what I do to being a woman, to being my age, to having children, itâ€™s you know, itâ€™s everything. We all come up against you know peopleâ€™s perceived image of us and you know I think all of our desire to probably break through that and show who we actually are and playing someone like Caroline is a joy because she does that and she will not have anyone tell her who she is, which is nice.\n\nBarrett: Yes. Now, you studied fine art before pursuing a career in acting. If you had stuck with art, what might you be doing today?\n\nGabriella: I well until I started acting, I didnâ€™t start acting until I was 20, although through school and through my degree I wanted to be a painter. So I guess I may have attempted to do that.? Iâ€™m not sure if I would have been very successful but that was definitely my first love and what I thought I was going to do with my life. But acting sort of found me and I am very happy in it since.\n\nBarrett: Well weâ€™re happy it found you. So youâ€™re presently shooting Season 4 of Poldark?\n\nGabriella: Yes.\n\nBarrett: And what is next for you once you wrap?\n\nGabriella: Well we just started shooting Season 4 so about two weeks om. And with Poldark itâ€™s quite a long shoot so I wonâ€™t be done until sort of spring next year and then weâ€™ll see. I think you know Poldark takes up a lot of time and so I think for most of the actors on it itâ€™s quite hard to do things in between it. But yeah I see. Weâ€™ll see if if there is going to be a Season 5. We donâ€™t know yet. And yeah, my children are getting a little bit older now so I think Iâ€™ll be looking to maybe start doing some other things too.\n\nBarrett: Well thank you so much. Gabrielle Wilde for speaking to us, we really appreciate it.\n\nGabriella: My pleasure.
