        "text": "Poldark star Gabriella Wilde has revealed that her youngest son was rushed to hospital for treatment after suffering from a mystery illness.\n\nThe 32-year-old actress – who played Caroline Penvenen in Poldark from 2016-2019 – is married to the 37-year-old singer-songwriter Alan Pownall and together they share three sons; eight-year-old Sasha, six-year-old Shiloh, and three-year-old Skye.\n\nThe actress revealed that Skye had been rushed to hospital and was treated by medics at the NHS run Royal United Hospital Bath, in Somerset.\n\nFortunately, the young lad is now on the mend and back playing with his older brothers – with Gabriella giving details of his recovery while thanking hospital staff for caring for him.\n\nIn a since deleted Instagram post, Gabriella shared a photo of her young son lying in a hospital bed and wrapped up in sheets.\n\nIn the caption of the image she gave details of his health scare, writing: “Earlier this week my darling Skye was being cared for by the incredible team of doctors and nurses @ruhbath hospital.\n\n“I am so deeply grateful to all of those angels who looked after him and I with such grace and care. Thank you thank you thank you for everything you do and all the sacrifices you make to take care of and heal others.\n\n“I am so grateful to live in a country with national health care . It is something we must NEVER take for granted.”\n\nThe actress added: “Skye is now well and home playing with his brothers”\n\nGabs previously discussed how she balances motherhood with work – detailing how the costumers on Poldark adjusted her restrictive period drama costumes so she would be able to easily breastfeed her second son, Shiloh, when she was filming the hit show.\n\nShe told Country and Town House magazine: \"I have never been one for making demands.\n\n\"The only time I have is when I brought my baby on set. He was four months old when we started filming the third series of Poldark. Brilliantly, the entire filming schedule was laid around his feeding time.\n\n\"My costumes were especially designed so that I could feed him. He was sick on me nearly every day which gave the costume designers a bit of a heart attack since you can’t really wash these elaborate costumes.\"\n\nGabriella and Alan raise their children in the countryside in Somerset – with the actress previously telling Marie-Claire that she wanted to give her children a similar upbringing to the ‘mud-spattered, outdoorsy life she enjoyed as a child, running around with her younger sister and five half-siblings.’\n\nShe told the magazine: “I have a big, mixed family from different marriages.\n\n“So [my childhood] was always pretty colourful and wonderful. I grew up in a house full of women; I had all my sisters like an army around me before I’d even tried to make friends.”\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
