        "text": "It has become a common trope to speak of Ken Russell's films as somehow 'baroque'. But what does that really mean? This article seeks to clarify this question by looking at one of Russell's most overlooked films, Salome's Last Dance. This is a play-within-the-film adaptation of Oscar Wilde's decadent play, which calls to mind similar approaches to the theatre that are associated primarily with the baroque stage of the seventeenth century (play-within-the-play, mise-en-abîme). By looking at the way Russell uses these structural devices we will gain insight in a deeper baroque structure in his work. But in the course of the analysis we will also debunk some myths that have accrued to the figure of Salome and her dance of the seven veils. Although Russell's films are most commonly classified as baroque on account of their excessive visual style, this article shows that the real baroque is happening inside, in the way the film (and Russell's work in general) is structured. Résumé On appelle les films de Ken Russell 'baroques' presque par habitude. Mais qu'est-ce que cette\n\nThis diploma thesis deals with the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray and its main protagonist. It attempts to explore the character of Dorian Gray and the change in the attitude of the society towards him. The thesis investigates the reception of the novel in Victorian society as well as in modern society and implies some explanations as to why this former outcast of Victorian times might actually be received favorably in modern age. The first part of the thesis deals with facts about Oscar Wilde and it offers some important information about the novel as well as about the main protagonist. In the second part, which might be called the practical part, the thesis compares the main differences in reception of the novel and the character and discuses several modern adaptations of The Picture of Dorian Gray with the intention to prove Dorian Gray to be a timeless literary character inspiring many today.\n\nAuthors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms: a.
