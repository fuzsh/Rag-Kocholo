I love it when jewellery looks personalised and interesting, like it’s been collected over time.”\n\nT: What’s the most sentimental piece of jewellery you own?\n\nG: “My engagement ring. Alan chose and designed it and I couldn’t love it more.”\n\nT: What are your favourite pieces from our collection?\n\nG: “The t-bar anklet and my t-bar necklace. I’ve been looking for a good anklet for a while now and this one is perfect.“\n\nT: What do you like about our brand?\n\nG: “I love that all the pieces can be worn alone or all together and a good chain is the best place to start. Tilly’s gold chains are exactly what I’d been looking for for years, until I found her collections.”\n\nT: Gold or silver?\n\nG: “Gold if I have to choose one, but I also like to mix in both together!”\n\nGabriella’s Favourite Pieces"
