        "text": "News report suggests Meghan Markle met Duchess of Cambridge\n\nMeghan Markle, 37, rose to international fame when her relationship with Prince Harry, 34, came to light. She has now married the prince, and has taken the title of Duchess of Sussex. It is though that Dukes and Duchesses use the name of their Duchy as their last name. So Meghan may well go by Meghan Sussex for ease. It is likely their children will adopt this surname too. But, did you know Meghan is the former-actress's first name?\n\nMeghan Markle real name: Harry’s wife does not go by her original first name?\n\nThe LA-born actress played the love interest in cable drama Suits.\n\nHowever, Meghan is not the actress's real first name.\n\nMeghan is actually named Rachel Meghan Markle.\n\nThe actress was born in Canoga Park, Los Angeles.\n\nShe studied at a girls’ private school in Hollywood before going on to study at university.\n\nIt is not unusual for actors to choose different name for their career.\n\nAnother US actress, Olivia Wilde’s real name is Olivia Jane Cockburn.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nActress Portia De Rossi’s real name is Amanda Lee Rogers.\n\nOne reason that actors often choose unique and eye catching names is that the Equity union for actors requires each member to have a unique professional name.\n\nOf course, some also hope their unique names will help them stand out.\n\nMeghan Markle’s earrings for the Fiji state dinner have been priced by an expert, and they are phenomenally expensive.\n\nThe earrings were recently reported to be from Butani.\n\nDeborah Papas, gemologist from Prestige Pawnbrokers of Channel 4’s Posh Pawn told Express.co.uk: “The Duchess of Sussex never ceases to amaze us with the beautiful jewellery she wears.\n\n“She chose to wear an absolutely stand out pair of chandelier style diamond drop earrings in three strands set with white and yellow coloured diamonds.\n\n“They could easily be worth £500,000 or more.”\n\nWhere will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s baby go to school and how much could it cost?\n\nIf Meghan and Harry have a boy, they could attend Eton."
