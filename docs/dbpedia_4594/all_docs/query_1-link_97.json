Get Me Out Of Here presenter, 48, announced the birth of his first child with wife Anne-Marie Corbett on Tuesday.\n\nTaking to Instagram, the Geordie TV star revealed that they had welcomed a son whom they had named Wilder Patrick.\n\nWilder comes from Old English surname Wilde, which means “wild, untamed, uncontrolled”, according to Behind The Name.\n\nPatrick meanwhile is thought to be a tribute to Corbett’s late dad Patrick, known as “Paddy”.\n\nCorbett made sure that her beloved parent was part of her and McPartlin’s wedding day back in 2021, with a childhood photo of herself and Paddy attached to her flower bouquet.\n\n“Born, 14/05/24 at 8.54am. Baby is beautiful, Mummy’s a legend, Sisters are over the moon. Dad’s a mess!” McPartlin wrote on his joint Instagram account with TV partner Declan Donnelly.\n\nHe also gave a first glimpse of the tot in a black and white image showing him cradling his son.\n\nThis marks McPartlin’s first child while Corbin has two children from her previous marriage.\n\nMcPartlin’s Instagram image also shows off for the first time an intricate tree tattoo on his shoulder with sweet dedications to his stepchildren and their pet dogs, Milo and Bumble, with Wilder undoubtedly soon to be added."
