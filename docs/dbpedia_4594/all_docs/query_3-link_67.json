        "text": "She is one of four young British actresses who have been shortlisted by Disney to play feisty Elizabeth Swann, the role that catapulted Keira Knightley to international stardom.\n\nThe first four swashbuckling Pirate adventures took more than £3billion at the box office for the Hollywood studio.\n\nGabriella, 25, is thought to be favourite as she is the most experienced actress.\n\nShe appeared in period drama The Three Musketeers and most recently a remake of 1980s film Endless Love.\n\nWilde’s family is related to Cressida Bonas, on-off girlfriend of Prince Harry.\n\nHer full name is Gabriella Zanna Vanessa Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe.\n\nHer father John Austen, is the grandson of a baronet while her former model mother Vanessa is the ex-wife of socialite Sir Dai Llewellyn.\n\nHis younger brother Roddy was involved in a long-term relationship with Princess Margaret.\n\nMarried Wilde, who had her first child Sasha earlier this year, dropped her family name to pursue a career in Hollywood.\n\nHer competition for the role as female lead in Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales includes 24-year-old Games Of Throne star Alexandra Dowling.\n\nBritish rival number two is Lucy Boynton, at 20 youngest of the four.\n\nShe is best known for playing a young Beatrix Potter in 2006’s Miss Potter."
