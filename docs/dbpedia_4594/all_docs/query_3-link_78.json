        "text": "I enjoy creating fan art of characters from Marvel, DC, and other franchises, but the most fun I have is when I create an original character from scratch. It's no secret that I truly enjoy drawing fantasy characters, and fairies are my favorite. In this concept, I imagined a fairy with blue hair joyfully welcoming the day as if it were a special day. The point of view is from an onlooker, as if we were hiding behind the rose bushes, like a bird watcher waiting for the right time to catch a glimpse of that beautiful creature, in our case, a magical fairy creature. Her outfit is made of rose leaves and petals, and I wanted to design it to resemble a simple dress but still have a do-it-yourself feel to it. The breakdown of the illustration is simple. I usually have a pretty good idea of the concept and pose. From there, I draw it and once I'm happy with it, I clean it up and add detail to the garments. The background is always in the back of my head, and 90% of the time, I use photo references for inspiration or even use them. Let me know if you enjoyed this, and if you'd like to see some more, I'd happily take on a challenge. #ipadart #procreate #fantasycharacter #fairyillulstration #digitalart #characterdesign #conceptilllustration #inspiration #artprocess\n\nOh, the AI image irony! When we want to create old-looking photos with Midjourney, it adds flaws and 'authentic' wear and tear to look like they've been stored in someone's attic for a century. That vintage vibe, you know, like paying extra for jeans that someone pre-ripped for us. But when we find genuine black-and-white photos, the ones that actually survived attics and basements, what do we do? We download them to tools like Remini and PicMa to wipe out the scratches and color them as if they had been taken today. We've seen Great-Grandpa Joes in the 1920s looking like they have just filled their pipes for an Instagram photo. Isn't that a bit funny? We add mistakes to make things look old and genuine, then turn around and erase decades in a quest for perfection. This image below is made by Midjourney but I don't want to download a picture of my mother, who looks like an Instagram model in her wedding dress after Remini's magic touch. We have a huge longing for nostalgia, yet on the other hand, we still value authenticity and it still matters if the people in the photos existed. #foodforthought #aiart #fakedmemories #realmemories #photoprocessing\n\nAs an artist I commence most of my portraits from the face, once that is done, I believe every other parts is secondary and would fall in place eventually. Sincerely, one of my favorite part is working on props, outfits and their details, it gives me this stylist and designer vibes. However, it could be tiring ü•π. The attention to details and the patience required, that point when you‚Äôre torn in between finishing up quick and getting it right regardless! This brings me to the essence of this post which is to talk about one of the many things I‚Äôve learnt in this art journey which is that PATIENCE and PERSISTENCE is key! No doubt, for me, the joy and sense of fulfillment that comes with me getting it right and finishing well strongly overrides the feeling of giving up, the lack of fulfillment, and sense of dissatisfaction that comes with it. This is applicable to every part of our lives, we‚Äôve got to be patient with ourselves. Patient to nurture the ideas, plan, goals and persistent enough to show up always, even when it doesn‚Äôt look or feel like it. Because in the end, the grand prize is definitely for those who won, not for those who attempted. Hence, It‚Äôs an art that must be learnt in the process of becoming a better you and achieving your goals, you can‚Äôt skip it! If you got to this part of this post, I salute you and I‚Äôll really love to hear from you.

Starting with Kurama, m'y favourite character from the show. You can get to see how much I struggled with his hair. At first I wanted to braid it or make the bottom part like a creeper. Then I've tried to use the concept of the Rose wip to make the ponytail and then the bangs like a rose or a carnation, but I didn't like the result. So at the end, I went for some of his hair being soft but with really hard and pointy edges, like if it was cut with the WIP or like the bushes that are really polished and cut in an unnaturally perfect way, but still beautiful and looking fluffy. Just like a garden, beautiful and calculated, just like Kurama. Still having some fox features on his face and on his shoulders and chest. Long and sharp eyes, big and fast, analysing the movement of a prey and yet, calm. Slim lips and a wide grin, a bit playful. And a short face, but wide, just like the face of a fox and sharp nose. And really elegant. I hope you like this redesign. I hope someday I can work on his Yoko shape and make more poses and expressions for him. #anime #fanart #manga #yuyuhakusho #yuyuhakushofanart #characterredesign #doodles #art #illustration #manga #kurama #digitalart #procreate"
