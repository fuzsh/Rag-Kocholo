        "text": "The daughter of British aristocracy, Gabriella Wilde made a successful transition from top model to actress with supporting and leading performances in several moderately popular features, including \"The Three Musketeers\" (2011) and \"Carrie\" (2013). Wilde initially rose to fame as the face of numerous major advertising campaigns and layouts in her native England, which led to her first film appearance in the UK comedy \"St. Trinian's 2: The Legend of Fritton's Gold\" (2009). A supporting turn as an innocent lady-in-waiting in \"Musketeers\" introduced her to global audiences, and she soon showed both capability and versatility in her subsequent efforts, including an American high school girl in \"Carrie\" and another Stateside young woman in \"Endless Love\" (2014). The latter film marked her first turn as the star of a film, which seemed to indicate that Wilde was on the fast track to Hollywood stardom."
