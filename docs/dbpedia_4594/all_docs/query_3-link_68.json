        "text": "Poldark star Gabriella Wilde has opened up about breastfeeding on the set of the drama.\n\nSpeaking to Country and Town House magazine, the actress said that adjustments had to be made to her costumes to accommodate her breastfeeding. Speaking in the December issue of the publicaton, Wilde said: ‘I have never been one for making demands [on set].’\n\nShe continued: ‘The only time I have is when I brought my baby on set. He was four months old when we started filming the third series of Poldark.’\n\nRELATED: Breastfeeding and returning to work\n\n‘Brilliantly the entire filming schedule was laid around his feeding times. My costumes were especially designed so I could feed him. He was sick on me nearly every day, which gave the costume designers a bit of a heart attack, since you can’t really wash these elaborate costumes.’\n\nGabriella is married to musician Alan Pownall and they share three sons, Sasha, Shiloh and Skye.\n\nRELATED: Millie Mackintosh pens honest post about mum guilt and returning to work\n\nPoldark is a historical series, based on the novels by Winston Graham. It focuses on the growing relationship between Cornwall gentleman Ross Poldark (Aidan Turner) and his scullery maid turned wife, Demelza (Eleanor Tomlinson).\n\nWe think it is lovely to see celebrities speaking out about continuing to breastfeed when they return to work. Many mums feel that they have to give up breastfeeding when they return to work or that they have to supplement with formula. While they can do this if they wish, it is completely possible to keep breastfeeding."
