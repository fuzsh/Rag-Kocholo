        "text": "Lola Wilde Merchandise Animated Series Gallery\n\nThings are about to get Wilde.\n\nLola Wilde is a 2022-introduced and all-around character. She is a student at Shadow High that focuses in Cosmetology. It's no secret that nails are where Lola’s confidence really shines. Her nail art designs have already captured the eyes of thousands of followers on IG and she hopes to keep the momentum going by starting her very own line of nail poshes. Originally from Baltimore, Lola is the youngest of three sisters who already have budding careers in hairstyling and makeup. Lola’s dream is to go into business with her sisters and open an all-in-one beauty salon where people can come to get pampered from head to toe in hairstyles and everything else.\n\nLooks\n\nPhysical Appearance[]\n\nLola's hair is curly and in a high ponytail with baby hairs lining around her forehead, being a magenta color and her eyes are a blood-orange color. Her makeup consists of glittery white eyeshadow with slight specks of iridescent pink glitter, reddish-pink graphic eyeliner, glossy pink lipstick, and matching rouge blush. Her skin tone is a pale pink and she has long, sharp light pink nails.\n\nOutfit[]\n\nLola wears a pink cropped tweed jacket with a lot of pink fur on it in a different shade and a silver zipper with pink thread. The only parts that don't have fur are half of her sleeves and her collar, which are still the shade of that pink. She wears a matching furry tweed skirt with a zipper and a black and silver belt, which says \"SHADOW\" on it. She pairs this with black knee-high fishnet socks and matching brighter shiny pink clawed sneaker heels with black laces. Lola accessorizes with a black cat-ear lace headband and big silver hoop earrings spelling \"SH\" on them.\n\nFor her “Costume Ball” outfit, she wears a bright pink top and matching skirt, with magenta tinsel on both. She adorns this with a floor-length pink fur coat with pink accent rims. For footwear, she wears iridescent magenta heels that feature silver ankle bracelets and straps around them.\n\nPersonality\n\nLola is shown to be sassy and opinionated, being best seen in her competing nature during her school's costume contest. She is also shown to be a feeder of drama, and is somewhat vindictive when upset. Nonetheless, she’s shown to be rather loyal, and cares about her friends.\n\nEtymology\n\nLola[]\n\nLola is the shortened form of the popular Spanish name Dolores, with said name translating to \"sorrows\". It is also a name associated with religion, specifically with Christianity.\n\nWilde[]\n\nWilde is an English surname that borrows from the word \"wild\", having a predictably wild meaning and origin.\n\nRelationships\n\nRomance[]\n\nAsh Silverstone[]\n\nRobin Sterling after shutting down Violet Willow's idea quickly jumps to the rumor of Ash and Lola, once mentioned however Lola shuts the idea down denying she has no romantic interest in Ash.\n\nEpisodes Seen In\n\nSpecials[]\n\nCostume Ball!\n\nTimeline\n\nAugust 22nd, 2022: Images of Lola's outfit and doll are leaked on multiple social media accounts and more.\n\nAugust 23rd, 2022: Lola's doll is found on Walmart with the other Shadow High Costume Ball dolls and is available to pre-order.\n\nSeptember 4th, 2022: Her doll is officially released at a few retailers and is starting to be bought.\n\nTrivia\n\nIn the special “Costume Ball”, her outfit she wears for her doll is her main outfit, and her new dress is an altered recolor of Meline’s second outfit, while Demi and Eliza’s second outfits are their doll outfits.\n\nShe is the only character so far to have their surname be used as a pun in their quote.\n\nReferences"
