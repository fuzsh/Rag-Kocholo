        "text": "Jack and Kelly had been married for 53 years. Jack, a retired military officer, eventually retired from his second career in finance. Kelly spent decades working in healthcare. Together, they raised three children who now have families and careers of their own scattered across the nation.\n\nJack and Kelly loved animals and had three horses, four goats, six dogs, and two cats on their ten-acre ranchette. Kelly had been battling a degenerative illness for years and had become unable to care for her pets. In September, Jack was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.\n\nKeeping the Ranch Running\n\nTo keep things running, the couple hired their nephew to live on the property and care for their animals, but in June, Kelly passed away. Three weeks later, Jack succumbed to his illness.\n\nWhile the couple had a will, they didn't make provisions for their pets. Local animal care organizations stepped in to fill the gap, but since they didn't plan for their animals beyond the immediate daily care, family and friends did their best to arrange for the care of the animals left behind.\n\nPlanning for Your Pet's Future in Arizona\n\nJack and Kelly were faced with a situation they never anticipated. Have you thought about what would happen to your pets if you pass away before they do?\n\nKEEP READING: In These AZ Cities, It May Be Illegal to Own Too Many Dogs\n\nPlanning for your petsâ€™ future in Arizona is a key step to make sure they're being cared for, especially if you have large livestock like horses, which are much harder to find homes for in your absence.\n\nIn Arizona, you can create a Pet Trust. A Pet Trust will let you set aside money to care for your pets after you're gone. You'll need someone to speak on their behalf, so you'll need to designate a trustee as their voice.\n\nYou can also outline detailed care instructions in the trust and specify veterinary care, diet, and living arrangements.\n\nSetting Up a Trust for Your Pets: Best Practices\n\nIf you want to leave your pet to someone, make sure they're willing and able to care for it. Give this some thought ahead of time, select both emergency permanent caregivers for your animals, and have a few backup options in case your first choices aren't available.\n\nREAD MORE: Virus Surging in Arizona: 'It's Time to Update Vaccinations'\n\nTalk to someone with knowledge on this subject, like a lawyer or estate planner, to help you sort out some options for your pets.\n\nDecide which options are best for you. There's a difference between a will and a trust. A will lets you designate who will care for your pets and allocate funds for their care. However, a will must go through probate, which can delay the process.\n\nOn the other hand, a trust can be enacted immediately upon your death, releasing funds more quickly to care for your pet, and they're much harder to contest.\n\nIt's always best to talk to a lawyer or an estate planner to help you understand your options. Planning for your pet in advance will remove the guesswork and burden from those left behind."
