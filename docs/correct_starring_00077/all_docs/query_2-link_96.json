        "text": "There is perhaps no better way to spend a game night than rolling through some Disney trivia questions. Given the company’s been churning out classics since 1937’s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, there are more Disney trivia game questions than you’ll know what to do with.\n\nThe best way to go about hosting a Disney trivia game night is to assign someone the role of emcee. They’ll be the person who sees the trivia questions (and answers), picks the lineup, and ultimately facilitates your Disney trivia game. The emcee can also choose whether you play a round of general Disney trivia or if you divvy things up into more specific categories, because let’s face it: the wonderful world of Disney (trivia) is a big one. Luckily, we’ve done the work of creating categories for you.\n\nBelow, you’ll find themed Disney trivia questions and answers that cover a wide range of Disney and Pixar films, from mega-hits like Beauty and the Beast and Toy Story to more fringe fare. (Atlantis: The Lost Empire or Angels in the Outfield, anyone?) And, on the subject of fringe movies, we also added a section of tough Disney trivia for diehard fans. Playing with friends who don’t own 10 pairs of Mickey Mouse ears? We dedicated a category to easy Disney quiz questions and answers, too — perfect for your pals who “think they saw the ‘Let It Go’ movie once.”\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Get a Disney movie night on the calendar so everyone can prep.
