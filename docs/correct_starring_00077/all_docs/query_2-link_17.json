        "text": "PERSONALITY-\n\nDuchess is the 'aristocat' mother to three kittens, Toulouse, Marie and Berlioz. Each of the kittens have different personalities which are exemplified in the clip above. Marie is the miniature of her mother, a young lady in the making. She is also feminine, but has the playful nature of a kitten. Berlioz and Toulouse have a farther ways to go to be gentlemen, they are rougher and play a little harder than Marie does. Duchess is seen as the soft, gentle image of the nurturing mother who dotes upon her kittens. Though not seen in the above clip, O'Malley is a street smart alley cat who has a tender side when it comes to protecting Duchess and her brood.\n\nVOICE-\n\nEven though the movie is set in Paris and the French countryside, sparingly few characters have French dialects. As this is an American film, then for the audience's sake the familiar Standard American English is used (Lexiophiles, 2012). Duchess and each of her three kittens actually have different dialects from one another. This is not overly realistic as they are supposed to be related and part of a family, but it is understandable when their personality traits are compared to the way they speak. To begin with, the prim and proper Duchess is voiced by Hungarian Eva Gabor. As a celebrity in film, Gabor's instantly recognizable voice also gives the animated film the comfort of hearing a well known voice (The Disney Project, 2012). Gabor's dialect is distinctly European and foreign to speakers of SAE which gives her an air of sophistication and motherly authority over her kittens. Marie speaks a dialect similarly foreign to SAE speakers. Her dialect closely identifies with a British English. The affect that this has is it sets her apart from her brothers as not only a girl but a young lady. Toulouse and Berlioz, the brothers are both speaking forms of SAE without any recognizable dialect, in sharp contrast to their mother and sister. O'Mallley also speaks SAE with a slight Midwestern dialect due to his voice actor's, Phil Harris, Indiana birthplace. The male figures, cats, of the movie all speak easily accessible SAE while the female cats speak with European dialects. This juxtaposes their two personalities together, one of a rougher, wise male and a gentle and proper female.\n\nSOCIAL IMPACT-\n\nIt appears that Disney is gendering language through these five cats who are, not only, different genders but also exhibit various personality traits. Disney animators seem to choose the dialect that they feel will best emphasize a certain aspect of a character. Duchess and Marie are meant to be soft, gentle women who have foreign dialects which reflect their voice actors' European births. Toulouse, Berlioz and O'Malley, despite the first two characters' obviously French names, speak with a localized and familiar dialect which resembles Midwestern SAE. By looking at the two genders of cats, Disney appears to be sending the message that French females are supposed to be exotic and foreign Europeans while the French males are down-home Americans.\n\nAs this is a film for children, it is not as if Disney is maliciously gendering language and dialects as female and male, but they are influencing the associations that children make with speakers of other languages. A child may have never heard a French person speak in reality, but they have heard what they assume to be French in The Aristocats. The association that they may make is that French women are ladylike, because of Duchess and Marie's European dialects and actions, and that French men are close to American men since Toulouse, Berlioz and O'Malley do not sound as foreign as Duchess and Marie.\n\nLike most Disney movies, the hero of the story saves the heroine from destruction. When Duchess and her kittens are kidnapped and left in the French countryside, it is up to O'Malley to bring them back to Paris. From his first introduction, the viewer immediately knows that O'Malley is the hero of the movie and as soon as he speaks they can recognize a familiar dialect of SAE. This association is enforcing viewers' ideas that American males are fated to be the hero. It would be out of character for Disney to choose a recognizably foreign dialect for the hero as it would suggest that they can also be the hero. By associating hero, or the 'goody guy', with SAE Disney is able to make audiences instantly know who they should like in the film. Despite O'Malley's rougher outside, he still cares for Duchess and her kittens. This makes him a likable character.\n\nFound not only in The Aristocats, Disney animators resorting to SAE for 'good guys' is common. It allows the viewers to be familiar with the way that the character is speaking and therefore become familiar with the character. If Disney were to choose to voice a character audiences are supposed to see as good, it would be troubling for viewers. They may not like the film because it strays from what they have become familiar with."
