        "text": "Did you know one of Disney's most famous villains, Cruella De Vil, was from the Alabama? Although the 1961 film \"101 Dalmatians\" was set in London, the character of Cruella was voiced by Betty Lou Gerson, who was born in Chattanooga and raised in Birmingham.\n\nGerson, 1914-1999, always made a living from her voice, starting in the entertainment industry in the 1930s voicing characters on radio soap operas such as The Guiding Light and later voicing the narrator in 1950's \"Cinderella.\" She also acted in a few films, most notably playing Nurse Andersone in 1958's \"The Fly\" starring Vincent Price, and the uncredited role of the old crone in 1964's \"Mary Poppins.\"\n\nBut perhaps the most famous character she ever portrayed was Cruella de Vil, although few people recognized the real woman behind the wicked voice.\n\nIn a 1991 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Gerson said many people thought she was spoofing another Alabamian, Huntsville native Tallulah Bankhead, with her flamboyant portrayal of Cruella.\n\n\"We both had phony English accents on top of our Southern accents and a great deal of flair,\" she told The Times. \"So our voices came out that way.\"\n\nGerson was honored as a Disney Legend in 1996 and made one last film, voicing Frances the Fish in 1997's \"Cats Don't Dance.\"\n\nCharacters voiced by Alabama actors\n\nGerson is one of dozens of talented Alabamians who have lent their voices to well-known characters over the years.
