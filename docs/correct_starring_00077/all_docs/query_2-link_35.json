        "text": "What do you know about the voices of some of Disney’s most beloved animated stars? Let’s see what you know!\n\n1. In The Great Mouse Detective (1986), when Basil and Olivia almost get seen by Basil’s upstairs neighbor, one Sherlock Holmes, we hear him and Watson conversing. It took some time and legal dealing, but that is the voice of the OG Sherlock of cinema, Basil Rathbone. Basil already had another Disney animation screen credit as the narrator for The Wind in the Willows (1949).\n\n2. We all love Kristen Bell as the playful yet pure-hearted princess Anna from Frozen (2013). However, she also has two whole words in Zootopia (2016) …as Priscilla. (“Yes…Flash?”)\n\n3. It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963) (Distributed by United Artists) stars some of cinema’s greatest comedians, but Disney fans should keep an eye out for Stan Freberg (The beaver in Lady and the Tramp), Don Knotts (Mayor Turkey Lurkey in Chicken Little), Buddy Hackett (Scuttle from The Little Mermaid), Mickey Rooney (Tod from The Fox and the Hound), Andy Devine (Friar Tuck from Robin Hood), Nicodemus Stewart (Br’er Bear from Song of the South), Terry-Thomas (Sir Hiss from Robin Hood), and Sterling Holloway (Winnie the Pooh, among many others).\n\n4. John Cleese was approached to play Cogsworth in Beauty and the Beast (1991), but turned it down in favor of playing Cat R. Waul in An American Tail: Fievel Goes West (1991).\n\n5. Sir Patrick Stewart cites turning down the role of Jafar in Aladdin (1992) as one of his biggest career regrets, as he had obligations for Star Trek: The Next Generation at the time.\n\n6. Ed Wynn was unable to recreate the performance he did on a soundstage for the animators. Instead of using any soundbooth recordings, we can hear his lines as the Mad Hatter in Alice in Wonderland (1951) has a slight reverb.\n\n7. Jeremy Irons blew out his vocal chords singing “Be Prepared” in The Lion King (1994) Jim Cummings, already voicing Ed the hyena, took over. Irons’ last line is “YOU WON’T GET A SNIFF OUT OF ME!”, and Cummings’ first is “Be prepared for the coup of the century”.\n\n8. Ben Wright had voiced Roger Radcliffe in 101 Dalmatians (1961) and Rama, Mowgli’s wolf father in The Jungle Book (1967). However, directors had no idea who he was when he was hired as Grimsby in The Little Mermaid (1989) and had to tell them.\n\n9. Though Sterling Holloway didn’t make his big debut with Disney until Dumbo (1941), a note by Walt Disney shows even during the development of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) he had his name next to Sleepy, indicating he knew of him and wanted to hire him even back then. However, the role instead went to Pinto Colvig, who also voiced Grumpy.\n\n10. Rosie O’Donnell was happy to voice Terk in Tarzan (1999), but only under one condition: she wanted her own song. As luck would have it, Phil Collins already wrote “Trashin’ the Camp” for her.\n\n11. There are numerous traditions in staging Peter Pan. Like the crocodile played by offstage ticking or Tinker Bell played by a spotlight. Obviously, neither of these were translated over to the 1953 Disney adaptation. But one that WAS kept was casting Hans Conried as both Mr. Darling and Captain Hook.\n\n12. Chris Sanders, co-writer and co-director of Lilo and Stitch (2002) used to use his Stitch voice to call coworkers and antagonize them before it was used in the film.\n\n13. We know Stan “The Man” Lee had cameos in virtually every Marvel film right up through Avengers: Endgame (2019). But Stan not only had a voiceless cameo in Ralph Breaks the Internet (2018), but since Big Hero 6 (2014) was a Marvel property too, he makes an appearance – voice and all – as Fred’s dad in a post-credit scene. Stan even reprised the role in the subsequent TV series.\n\n14. The primary reason Goofy starred in his own series of “How-To” cartoons is because his original voice actor, story man Pinto Colvig, left the Disney studio in 1937, and the studio never found a good enough replacement. He would return in the forties and continued to voice Goofy until his passing in 1967.\n\n15. Kathryn Beaumont has her legacy secured as both Alice from Alice in Wonderland (1951) and Wendy Darling in Peter Pan (1953). But she wouldn’t let age stop her from reprising her role as Alice in 2002’s Kingdom Hearts.\n\n16. Lucille LaVerne provided the voice for the Queen in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), including after her transformation into the old hag. All she had to do was take out her false teeth.\n\n17. Mel Blanc, the legendary man known for voicing most all of the Looney Tunes, has only three credits with Disney. One is a parrot and Uncle Orville on the Carousel of Progress (“No privacy at all around this place!”). The other is in Pinocchio (1940) as Gideon. Several lines were written for the character until it was decided to try and make Gideon popular like Dopey, hence his silence. All we hear of it now is a single hiccup. Interestingly, one of the last times Blanc ever voiced Bugs, Daffy, Porky, Tweety, and Sylvester was in his third Disney credit, Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988), which was one of his last projects before his death in 1990.\n\n18. In Enchanted (2007), a news reporter reporting on the incident in the pizza restaurant signs off as Mary Ilene Caselotti. This is an homage to Mary Costa (The voice of Aurora), Ilene Woods (The voice of Cinderella), and Adrianna Caselotti (The voice of Snow White).\n\n19. Bob Peterson, a Pixar story man and the voice of several characters for the studio (Such as Mr. Ray in Finding Nemo (2003) and Roz in Monsters, Inc. (2001)), was inspired by his time as a camp counselor when a child ran up to him and said “I just met you and I love you!”. He later used this greeting for Dug the dog in Up (2009)\n\n20. Are you a Seinfeld fan? Patton Oswalt (Remy in Ratatouille) is a video rental clerk in “The Couch”. Sarah Silverman (Vanellope in Wreck-it Ralph) appeared in “The Money” as Kramer’s girlfriend, Emily. James Hong (Chi Fu in Mulan) is the seating host in “The Chinese Restaurant”. Ernie Sabella (Pumbaa in The Lion King) is the naked guy in “The Subway”. Lee Arenberg (Pintel in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise) is in “The Parking Space”. Bette Midler (Georgette in Oliver & Company) played herself in “The Understudy”. Brad Garrett (Gusteau in Ratatouille, Hook hand in Tangled, among others) played Tony, Jerry’s mechanic in “The Bottle Deposit”. Patrick Warburton (Kronk in The Emperor’s New Groove) plays Elaine’s on-again, off-again boyfriend, Puddy. Jerry Stiller (Uncle Max in The Lion King 1 1/2) played Frank Costanza. Estelle Harris (Mrs. Potato Head in the Toy Story franchise) is Estelle Costanza. Wayne Knight (Tantor in Tarzan, Zurg in Buzz Lightyear of Star Command) was Newman. Michael Richards appeared as a caveman in Epcot’s Universe of Energy (1996-2017). Jason Alexander played Hugo in The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996) and Abis Mal in the Aladdin television series. Julia Louis-Dreyfus appeared in A Bug’s Life (1998) and Onward (2020) as well as MCU’s Valentina Allegra de Fontaine. But you know who has never appeared in a Disney production? Jerry Seinfeld.\n\n21. Song of the South (1946) gets a lot of flak for its racist depictions, and it’s not unwarranted. Regardless, James Baskett pulled his weight as not just Uncle Remus, but also the voice of Br’er Fox, and when Johnny Lee was away on a USO Tour, he voiced Br’er Rabbit in the “Laughin’ Place” segment, too. The man earned his honorary Oscar, but it’s no less cringey to know before this movie… he played a crow in Dumbo (1941)\n\n22. In Aladdin (1992), where the vendor in the opening tries to sell you his wares, it was a complete improv session for Robin Williams (Originally, the movie ended to reveal the vendor was really the Genie in human guise). Given a box of props, he went nuts with the materials given, in true Robin fashion. Animator Eric Goldberg recalled when he pulled out a bra and sold it as ” a double yamulkah” and “a double slingshot”, and how it wasn’t allowed to be in the movie, despite their best efforts.\n\n23. The Producers (2005) is a beloved Mel Brooks production, starring Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane. Both men headlined in The Lion King (1994) as adult Simba and Timon, respectively. Wouldn’t it be cool if Ernie Sabella (Pumbaa) was there, too? Actually, he was! As a bartender! Too bad his scene was cut in the theatrical version.\n\n24. Ever since Figment was returned to Epcot’s Journey Into Your Imagination in 2002, he’s been voiced by Dave Goelz, best known as the puppeteer and voice of The Muppet’s Great Gonzo (In the 1983 iteration, Figment was voiced by comedian Billy Barty). However, he’s not the only Muppet performer to have done a character voice for Disney. Frank Oz (Yoda, Miss Piggy, Grover, Fozzie, Bert, and many more) played Funguss, Randall’s assistant in Monsters, Inc. (2001)\n\n25. There’s only been a few times where the voice actors portray their animated counterparts apart from their animated appearances. One of the first is Kathryn Beaumont, who played Alice on television a few times, including 1950’s One Hour in Wonderland (Though if you want, you can count Sterling Holloway wearing a bow tie as the Cheshire Cat on The Fred Waring Show, too!). Scott Weinger famously wore Aladdin’s duds in the episode of Full House where the Tanner family goes to Walt Disney World. His opponent, Jonathan Freeman, the voice of Jafar, originated the role on Broadway when the show opened in 2014. And if that Moana live action remake goes through, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson (Maui) and Auli’i Cravalho (Moana) will join the ranks.\n\n26. In Zootopia (2016), a panicked pig shopkeeper alerts Judy that Duke Weaselton just stole a bunch of flower bulbs. Hopps was voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin, and the pig is voiced by Josh Dallas; both of whom at the time were co-starring on ABC’s Once Upon a Time when the movie came out as Snow White/Mary Margaret and Prince Charming/David Nolan.\n\n27. On ABC’s Home Improvement, an episode called “I was a Teenage Taylor” provided a particularly snarky meta gag for those in the know. On Halloween, Randy (Jonathon Taylor Thomas) gives a kid in a spaceman costume one piece of candy, and a kid dressed as a lion seven. JTT played young Simba in The Lion King (1994), and his dad, played by Tim Allen, was Buzz Lightyear in Toy Story (1995)\n\n28. Three Disney princesses cameo in Enchanted (2007). Jodi Benson (Ariel) plays Sam, Robert’s secretary. Second is when Nathaniel catches a soap opera, the woman is played by Paige O’Hara, who played Belle in Beauty and the Beast (1991). Lastly, when Prince Edward stumbles onto an apartment where a pregnant woman with three kids grumbles, “You’re too late,” the actress is Judy Kuhn, the singing voice of Pocahontas.\n\n29. When Baloo tickles King Louie’s armpits to get him to drop his crumbling temple in The Jungle Book (1967), that’s not Louis Prima laughing. It’s a reused track of Br’er Rabbit’s laughter from Song of the South (1946). Specifically, when Br’er Bear shoves the beehive onto Br’er Fox’s head.\n\n30. Stephanie Beatriz was nine months pregnant while belting out her powerful number “Waiting on a Miracle” in Encanto (2021).\n\n31. Idina Menzel already made a name for herself on Broadway in Rent and Wicked, thanks to her renowned voice. When she transitioned to film, she wanted to be sure she could flex her acting chops first and foremost. Thus, one of her first onscreen roles was Nancy Tremaine in Enchanted (2007), where, despite it being a musical, she didn’t sing. And as we all know, she never sang for Disney ever.\n\n32. The famous Goofy holler was originally from 1941’s The Art of Skiing (Pronounced Shee-ing). Hannes Schroll was a professional yodeler who provided the alpine ambiance to the short, as well as yes, emphasizing Goofy’s tumbles and plummets.\n\n33. The barmaid who owns the saloon in Home on the Range (2004) is voiced by former governor of Texas Ann Richards (1991-1996). She admitted it was mostly to impress the grandkids.\n\n34. The face of Madame Leota on the Haunted Mansion is that of imagineer Leota Toombs. However, that isn’t her voice. It was too high pitched and feminine, leaving her voice to be dubbed over by a woman known for scaring others: Eleanor Audley. Who’s she? Oh, no one… just the voice of Lady Tremaine, Cinderella’s stepmother, and Sleeping Beauty‘s Maleficent.\n\n35. Billy Bletcher was the original voice of Pete, Mickey’s nemesis, as well as the Big Bad Wolf in the Three Little Pigs (1933). Pinto Colvig would co-star as the Practical Pig and – as noted earlier – was the original voice of Goofy, who’d go up against Pete in Goof Troop. Another connection between the two? Both were cast in MGM’s The Wizard of Oz (1939) as Munchkin background voices.\n\n36. Jim Cummings has provided the voice of at least one named character in virtually every show the Disney Afternoon. The Adventures of the Gummi Bears (Zummi Gummi), DuckTales (El Capitan), Chip n’ Dale Rescue Rangers (Monterey Jack, Fat Cat, and Professor Nimnul), Darkwing Duck (Drake Mallard/Darkwing Duck and NegaDuck), TaleSpin (Don Karnage and Louie), Goof Troop (Pete) Bonkers (Bonkers and Lucky Piquel), Aladdin: The Series (Rasoul), Gargoyles (Dingo), The Schnookums and Meat Funny Cartoon Show (Narrator), Timon & Pumbaa (Ed the Hyena), Quack Pack (Captain Dreadnot), Mighty Ducks (Commander Xenon), and 101 Dalmatians: The Series (The Colonel). Only the final show, Hercules: The Animated Series, lists Jim Cummings (According to IMDB) in three episodes, but characters without names. But hey…at least he was Nessuss the centaur in the 1997 film!\n\n37. If I had a nickel for every time there was a late-sixties Disney cartoon directed by Woolie Reitherman about a boy and his bear bestie hanging around a forest starring Bruce Reitherman, Sterling Holloway, Sebastian Cabot, and Clint Howard, singing Sherman brothers songs, I’d have two nickels. Which isn’t a lot, but it’s weird that it happened twice, right? (Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree (1966) and The Jungle Book (1967); Reitherman was Mowgli and Christopher Robin, Holloway was Pooh and Kaa, Cabot was the Narrator and Bagheera, and Clint Howard was Roo and Hathi Jr.)\n\n38. Vin Deisel is the only voice actor to have provided the language dubbing of his own character in international releases. Apparently, whether it’s “Yo soy Groot,” “Je suis Groot,” or “I am Groot,” it’s pretty easy to do the translations.\n\n39. It may not surprise you that the lead crow in Dumbo (1941) – whose name is Jim, by the way. Yes, really – is voiced by a white man. What you may not know is his actor was Cliff Edwards… the voice of Jiminy Cricket.\n\n40. Daws Butler is the legendary voice guy from Hanna-Barbera, as the original voice actor for Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound, Quick Draw McGraw, Snagglepuss, Elroy Jetson, Hokey Wolf, Wally Gator, and several others. His only credit at Disney is in Mary Poppins (1964) as a turtle and a penguin.\n\n41. Ever wonder why an alligator in The Princess and the Frog (2009) seems to eagerly want to eat Naveen “Basted, battered, and fried”? Probably because that’s celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse, who specializes in Cajun cuisine. If you doubt me, listen closely as he shouts his signature catchphrase, “Bam!” as he chomps after the frog prince.\n\n42. Alan Tudyk (Dodgeball, Firefly) has popped up in several Disney projects in the past decade. In Frozen (2013), he played the Duke of Weselton, where everyone keeps calling it “Weaseltown” as a running gag. In Zootopia (2016), his character’s name is Duke Weaselton…and Judy Hopps at one point calls him Duke Weselton.\n\n43. Disney tried to get the Beatles – John, Paul, George, and Ringo – into the studio to play the vultures in The Jungle Book (1967), but Lennon fiercely rejected the invite and suggested Disney go hire Elvis instead. Instead, J. Pat O’Malley, already the voice of Colonel Hathi, voiced Buzzie, the bald vulture. Chad Stuart (Flaps, the blond vulture) was part of a British invasion duo, Chad & Jeremy. Lord Tim Hudson (Dizzy, the shaggy vulture) was a DJ and band manager, and later on voiced the English Cat in Scat Cat’s group in The AristoCats (1970). And Digby Wolfe (Ziggy, the redheaded vulture) was a British comedian who appeared on several shows, including The Monkees. Close…enough…?\n\n44. In the Phineas and Ferb episode “The Curse of Candace”, Ferb’s father is watching a horror movie when he off-handedly asks “Where are all the rock n’ roll dance numbers?” Lawrence Fletcher here was voiced by Richard O’Brien…creator of The Rocky Horror Picture Show and actor for Riff Raff.\n\n45. To promote the live action 2019 Kim Possible movie on Disney Channel and announce the newly casted main characters, a a short dropped on YouTube where the original show’s creators, Mark McCorkle and Bob Schooley, are holding auditions for Kim and Ron. Christy Carlson Romano and Will Friedle, the animated characters’ voice actors, try to audition for the roles, but fail miserably due to the fact they are far too old to play the teenaged heroes. Only after this hammy bit do the showrunners reveal the actors that have already been hired to play Kim and Ron.\n\n46. Donny Osmond literally punched himself in the stomach in the line, “But you can BET before we’re through” in “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” in Mulan (1998).\n\n47. In the House of Mouse episode “King Larry Swings in”, you might have been scratching your head over “King Louie’s twin brother”, since aside from his voice, Larry is fundamentally identical to the King of the Swingers. This is because in the nineties, Louis Prima’s widow, Gia Prima, sued Disney over unpaid royalties in use of the character, even when her late husband wasn’t the one behind the microphone (Like in TaleSpin when Jim Cummings did the role.) The lawsuit settled, but Disney became so paranoid about any use of King Louie that in The Jungle Book 2 (2003) he’s absent altogether, and with King Larry, it’s Cummings doing a pseudo-Phil Hartman impression.\n\n48. Changing Mickey Mouse’s performer has been a pretty unceremonious tradition. Walt visited sound effects engineer Jimmy MacDonald and asked if he could talk like Mickey. When he did his impression, Walt told his staff to call Jimmy because he was too busy (And…you know, probably the smoking thing made it hard, too.) Wayne Allwine worked under MacDonald and filled in for him when he failed to show up for a session, after which Allwine was told “Kid, join the actor’s guild. They’re gonna use you.” Bret Iwan auditioned for the role while Allwine was dying from diabetes, leaving little opportunity for celebration.\n\n49. Even before joining the Disney family, the Simpsons cast have had turns on Disney’s payroll. Yeardley Smith (Lisa) has the least time, appearing only two episodes of Disney Channel’s Phil of the Future. Harry Shearer was a dog announcer in Chicken Little (2005). Kelsey Grammer (Sideshow Bob) was Stinky Pete in Toy Story 2 (1999) Russi Taylor and Tress Macnielle have both been longtime performers for tertiary characters, but are renowned to Disney fans as Minnie Mouse and Daisy Duck, respectively. Julie Kavner (Marge) played Timon’s mother in The Lion King 1 1/2 (2004). Nancy Cartwright (Bart) was Rufus the naked mole rat in Kim Possible and Todd in The Replacements. Dan Castellaneta (Homer) was the controversial replacement for the Genie in the Aladdin TV series. Hank Azaria seems to avoided Mickey’s reach…though he voiced Goofy in 2020’s Disney+ special, Plusaversary. And ever since Disney bought 21st Century Fox, why not count Bartok from Anastasia (1999), too?\n\n50. Megan Mulally turned down the role of Dory in Finding Nemo (2003) when she was asked to do the role in the voice she used for her character Karen for Will & Grace.\n\n51. In 2013, Disney began producing the Paul Rudish Mickey Mouse shorts. All the standard voice actors play their respective characters (Russi Taylor as Minnie and Alan Young as Scrooge have both since passed away.) The only one who got a brand new performer right from the get-go is Mickey, voiced by Canadian comedian Chris Diamantopoulos, instead of official voice Bret Iwan. The reasoning was supposedly they wanted someone who sounded more like Walt’s version of Mickey since they were harkening back to the original design aesthetic.\n\n52. When The Incredibles (2004) was released on DVD, it came with a short called The Adventures of Mr. Incredible. The short was made to look like a 60’s cheaply-animated special where Mr. Incredible, Frozone, and a rabbit named Mr. Skipperdoo stopped the villainess Lady Light bug. A commentary track was provided where Craig T. Nelson (Mr. Incredible) and Samuel L. Jackson (Frozone) reprised their roles as they discussed this supposed bit of lost media. Among other topics they discuss: why Frozone talks like a beatnik, why there’s a rabbit, why Frozone looks like a white guy, and why the animation looks so weird.\n\n53. During the eighties and nineties, Paul Winchell’s humanitarian efforts and failing health often got in the way of his recording sessions for Tigger, leaving Pooh actor Jim Cummings to take over every so often. During his last session with Winchell, Cummings asked what it all meant, to which he replied “It means I want you to take care of my little buddy”. Paul’s last time voicing Tigger is on Walt Disney World’s Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh ride, which opened in 1999.\n\n54. Jonathon Taylor Thomas needed help method acting for Simba during the wildebeest stampede in The Lion King (1994). He was advised to imagine his mom fell off her chair across the room. Of course, at the cue, young JTT shouted “MOM!”\n\n55. Donnie Dunagan was a major in the US marine corps for both Korea and Vietnam. He kept close to the vest one very understandable secret from his fellow officers…that he voiced young Bambi.\n\n56. Don’t go up to Tony Anselmo with your Donald Duck impression, no matter how good you think it is. Anselmo worked closely with OG Donald of fifty-plus years, Clarence “Ducky” Nash, and he handed the role to Anselmo literally on his deathbed. Today, Anselmo is fiercely protective of Donald’s integrity, so I’m guessing yes, he has already seen the YouTube video of the Full Metal Jacket clip you’re thinking of and he would rather you not bring it up, ever.\n\n57. The team behind Toy Story 3 (2010) humored the idea of getting back the kid who played Andy, John Morris, in the first film to play him again. When they called, they got his voice mail…and were delighted he sounded exactly like how they wanted him to sound for the movie. Not to be outdone, Erik von Detten, who played Sid in the original film, also returns. Notice his signature skull t-shirt on the garbage man jamming out to some awesome tunes.\n\n58. Jonathan “Candy” Candido was a radio performer who got his start in films as the grumpy apple tree in The Wizard of Oz (1939). His shtick was his deep, guttural, four-octave voice that got Walt’s attention. You may recognize him best as the Indian chief in Peter Pan (1953). But he was also a pig-faced goon in Sleeping Beauty (1959), the crocodile captain in Robin Hood (1973), and Fidget the bat in The Great Mouse Detective (1986), said to be his personal favorite.\n\n59. Tex Ritter was a singing cowboy from the 1930s through the 1960s, with one of his songs being “Blood on the Saddle.” He was tasked by Disney to reprise that very song in an off-key performance that would be used for Big Al in Walt Disney World’s Country Bear Jamboree. If his last name looks familiar, his son is Three’s Company actor, the late John Ritter. Tex’s grandson and John’s son is Jason Ritter: Dipper Pine from Disney Channel’s Gravity Falls.\n\n60. Donal Gibson played John Smith in Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World (1998). You might be more familiar with his older brother Mel, who was John Smith in the original 1995 film.\n\n61. Angus McLaine, the director of Lightyear (2022), explained the reason Tim Allen was not cast as the space ranger that time around was because Lightyear was intended to be the movie Andy would have seen before he got the toy. Movies often hire their A-list actors, another for their Saturday morning cartoon versions, and yet another for merchandise. Though IRL, we got the toy first (Tim Allen in the Toy Story films), the cartoon second (Patrick Warburton in Buzz Lightyear of Star Command), and the movie last (Chris Evans in Lightyear).\n\n62. Shere Khan’s voice actor, George Sanders, was asked if he wanted a drawing of his character with Walt’s signature on it. The actor, a friend of Walt’s, bemused, “How utterly absurd. Why would I want his signature? He might want mine.”\n\n63. Ellen Degeneres was inspired by a neighbor who used to listen to whale sounds to relax, while she thought they were incredibly annoying. This is what inspired her “whale speak” performance in Finding Nemo (2003)\n\n64. Alicia Keyes, Jennifer Hudson, Tyra Banks, even Beyoncé herself all expressed interest in coveting the role of Tiana in The Princess and the Frog (2009), but directors John Musker and Ron Clements preferred hiring a lesser-name star so viewers didn’t go into the movie thinking about the actress over the character.\n\n65. Ever wonder why Giselle from Enchanted (2007) is not an official Disney princess? Giselle’s design is based off her actress, Amy Adams, since her live action version is also her animated counterpart. Unfortunately, this meant having to secure lifelong rights to Adams’ likeness, which was a legal and expensive effort. Thus, Giselle never even got the invite.\n\n66. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella were originally hired to play hyenas in The Lion King (1994).\n\n67. Robin Williams was hired minimum SAG pay to play the Genie in Aladdin (1992) since animated films weren’t hugely successful at the box office at the time, so he decided to do it mostly for his kids. His one caveat was to not have the Genie in any marketing materials, mostly so it wouldn’t conflict with friend Barry Levinson’s Toys, which was releasing around the same time, but he was also morally against the concept. However, his comedy was so good that then-studio head Katzenberg kept trying to find ways to work around the stipulations, like interfering with production on Ferngully: The Last Rainforest (1992) and twisting the interpretation of “Genie on no more than 25% of the poster” clause (by having the Genie take up 25% and everyone else be much smaller.) Williams even hated his Golden Globe win, seeing it as more advertising for a project that disrespected his wishes and overshadowed Toys. While he came back for Genie a few more times before his 2014 death (like in 1997’s Aladdin and the King of Thieves), his will states no unused recordings from Aladdin can be used without permission for 25 years after his passing.\n\n68. In 2018’s Christopher Robin, Bridesmaid‘s Chris O’Dowd was hired to play Tigger, since everyone besides Pooh was recast for the film. However, test audiences disliked it so much that Jim Cummings came in to redub the dialogue instead.\n\n69. Alan Tudyk has been in every animated Disney release since Wreck-it Ralph (2012). However, because more films have been taking place in different parts of the world, and Alan is white, he’s been cast mostly as birds. Like Hei Hei in Moana (2016), a toucan in Encanto (2021), and Iago in Aladdin (2019). Hey… a paycheck’s a paycheck\n\n70. Tom Hanks will forever go down in cinema history as Woody from the Toy Story films, but the Nicest Guy in Hollywood is also one of the busiest and most expensive. For projects like video games, toys, promotional materials, and other projects where Woody has to speak, his brother Jim Hanks often gets the call from Pixar.\n\n71. Charles Fleischer is a true method actor. He had to be on set and just out of camera view to speak his lines as Roger in Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) while Bob Hoskins (Eddie Valiant), Christopher Lloyd (Judge Doom), Joanna Cassidy (Dolores) and others had to speak rubber dolls or an empty void. Unlike Kathleen Turner (Jessica Rabbit) and Lou Hirsch (Baby Herman), Fleischer dressed in a Roger Rabbit costume when he did so.\n\n72. Peter Cullen has been a prominent voice actor for decades, and voiced Winnie the Pooh’s Eeyore, mostly during the New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh series. However, Peter Cullen’s other most beloved character, in both the original animated series from the eighties through the current film franchise…is Optimus Prime.\n\n73. Sterling Holloway’s first character for Disney is Mr. Stork in Dumbo (1941), which is also a caricature of his likeness.\n\n74. Wayne Allwine and Russi Taylor, the-then voices of Mickey and Minnie Mouse, were married in 1991 until Wayne’s passing in 2009.\n\n75. In a 2018 episode of HBO’s Last Week Tonight, John Oliver ripped Venezualan dictator Nicolás Maduro a new one over his corruptive practices. According to their culture, the dead become birds. Thus, Venezualan-born actor Wilmer Vanderrama appears in a parrot costume pretending to be the deceased spirit of Hugo Chavez to pass on advice about restarting the old social welfare programs. Valderrama snarkily calls Oliver “Zazu,” but not just because Oliver always refers to himself looking like a bird. At the time, he had already recorded his lines as Zazu for the yet-to-be-released 2019 The Lion King remake. However, Valderrama shouldn’t talk… he was Disney Junior’s Handy Manny and later, Mirabel’s father, Augustine, in Encanto (2021).\n\n76. The baby who was eventually cast to say Big Baby’s one line (“Mama…?”) in Toy Story 3 was named Woody. Director Lee Unkrich was unaware of this until after the baby recorded his line.\n\n77. Before Meeko the raccoon and Flit the hummingbird, there was a turkey named Redfeather. After a string of memorable comic sidekicks, Disney looked to further the tradition in Pocahontas (1995) by having the animals talk. In Redfeather’s case, they were looking to have the late, great John Candy in the role. When Redfeather was switched out, a more realistic tone of the movie was opted for, leaving Meeko, Flit, and Ratcliffe’s pug Percy silent. It would have been Candy’s second animated Disney character after Wilbur the albatross in The Rescuers Down Under (1990).\n\n78. The legendary George C. Scott (Patton, Dr. Strangelove) was cast as two Disney villains in 1990. One was Percival C. McLeach in The Rescuers Down Under, and the other was Smoke from Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue. The latter is not a Disney movie per se, but it was released under their distribution label, and featured Winnie the Pooh, Tigger, Huey, Dewey, Louie, Baby Kermit, Baby Piggy, and Baby Gonzo alongside Alf, the Smurfs, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Slimer, Alvin and the Chipmunks, Michelangelo, and Garfield. The bizarre crossover is an anti-drug PSA for kids.\n\n79. Louis Prima loved voicing King Louie in The Jungle Book (1967) so much he headlined his own record called Let’s “Hear” it for Robin Hood, where King Louie – now a denizen of Sherwood Forest and a chum of Robin himself – recaps the movie and sings the 1973 film’s songs. He even came close to being the subject of Bernard and Bianca’s rescue operation an the original draft of The Rescuers (1977) as a polar bear – also named Louis – who wanted to leave the zoo. Story problems and plagued this plot and Prima had a debilitating heart attack, which resulted in it being cut. All that remains of that version is a brief segment where Bernard tries to take a shortcut through the zoo before being chased out by a snarling lion.\n\n80. June Foray is yet another legendary voice actress whose credits include Looney Tunes’ Granny and Witch Hazel, as well Rocky the Flying Squirrel and Natasha Badenov in Rocky and Bullwinkle, plus hundreds of other characters. For Disney, she started out as Lucifer’s hisses in Cinderella (1950), another witch named Hazel in the 1952 Donald Duck cartoon Trick or Treat, Ms. “Squaw…get ’em firewood!” from Peter Pan (1953) and the grandmother in Mulan (1998). Her best known Disney characters are Grammi Gummi from The Adventures of the Gummi Bears and Ma Beagle and Magica DeSpell, both from the original 1987 DuckTales. Even well into her nineties, she still came back for the DuckTales: Remastered video game in 2013.\n\n81. James Earl Jones was King Mufasa, and Madge Sinclair was his Queen Sarabi in The Lion King (1994). But it wasn’t the first time the two played king and queen together. King Jaffe Joffer and Queen Aoleon ruled over the fictional Kingdom of Zamunda in 1988’s Coming to America.\n\n82. Russi Taylor (Yes, Minnie Mouse) was the voices of Huey, Dewey, Louie, and Webby in 1987’s DuckTales. She was the only cast member from the original series to pop up in the 2017 reboot. In “Last Christmas!”, she voiced teenaged Donald Duck, who apparently was an insecure emo guitarist. The nephews’ signature catchphrase “Quackaroonie!” was even brought back for the episode. Sadly, Taylor passed. Away before she could reprise the role in season three’s “The First Adventure!”.\n\n83. In The Princess and the Frog (2009), Ray starts up the song “Goin’ Down the Bayou” by getting the attention of cousin Randy. Randy Newman was the composer for the film, and yes, it’s his voice and likeness.\n\n84. Sometimes voice acting is a family business. Paul Winchell, the voice of Tigger and many others, is the father of voice actress April Winchell whose had many credits over the years, such as Sylvia in Wander Over Yonder, Black Heron in the DuckTales reboot, and Baby Herman’s mother in Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988), but her most consistent character with Disney is Clarabelle Cow.\n\n85. I already mentioned June Foray’s roles with Disney, as well as her prominent characters in Jay Ward’s Rocky and Bullwinkle show as Rocky and Natasha. Bill Scott, the voice of Bullwinkle was the original Gruffi Gummi, often butting heads with Grammi in The Adventures of the Gummi Bears. Boris Badenov was played by Paul Frees: better known as Professor Ludwig Von Drake, Pirates of the Caribbean’s auctioneer, and the Haunted Mansion’s Ghost Host.\n\n86. During the song “Brand New Best Friend” in Phineas and Ferb: Across the 2nd Dimension (2011), the two Doofenshmirtzes sing “Do llamas weird you out?/Yeah, are they camels or sheep?/No, no, I meant Lorenzo/He played Meap!” Soap opera star Lorenzo Lamas played an alien named Meap in the episode “The Chronicles of Meap”.\n\n87. During the “Weirdmageddon” finale of Gravity Falls, a character known only as “The Horrifying Sweaty One-Armed Monstrosity” is credited to be voiced by comedian Louis C. K. However, when he was cited with several sexual assault charges in 2017, this…uh, “character” was dubbed over by show creator and voice of Grunkle Stan, Alex Hirsch.\n\n88. Tad Stones, the creator of Darkwing Duck and co-creator of Chip n’ Dale Rescue Rangers has been involved in reboots of these franchises as a cameo. In the 2017 DuckTales episode “The Duck Knight Returns!”, Tad is the security guard rebuffing the overzealous Jim Starling at the gate. In the 2022 Chip and Dale Rescue Rangers movie, Stones is heard over the phone as the producer greenlighting the TV show to the ecstatic young chipmunks.\n\n89. It was decided during the making of Mickey’s PhilharMagic that Donald Duck’s dialogue would be a mix of new audio tracks by Tony Anselmo and vintage ones by Clarence Nash. For example, “Doggone stubborn little…” is from Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988). Lines such as “Where’s my hat?” are the newer ones by Anselmo.\n\n90. Thurl Ravenscroft, best known to most as the original voice of Frosted Flakes’ Tony the Tiger and holiday crooner of “You’re a Mean One, Mr. Grinch” has starred in a number of Magic Kingdom attractions. On the Liberty Belle Riverboats, he can be heard calling out “Mark Twain!” repeatedly. On Pirates of the Caribbean, his deep vocals are heard singing the ride’s theme song as the town burns. Over in the Enchanted Tiki Room, he is Fritz, the German parrot. He played Buff the Buffalo at the Country Bear Jamboree. His face and voice are seen and heard distinctly as the decapitated bust, singing “Grim Grinning Ghosts” at the Haunted Mansion. Say nothing of his roles in Alice in Wonderland (1951), Paul Bunyan (1958), Mary Poppins (1964), The AristoCats (1970), The Small One (1977), The Brave Little Toaster (1987), and a heck of a lot more.\n\n91. Comedy duo Cheech and Chong have lent their comedic chops to Disney at least once each. Cheech Marin can be heard as Tito in Oliver & Company (1988), Banzai the hyena in The Lion King (1994), and Ramon in the Cars franchise. While Tommy Chong was not in any of these films, he was Yax, the guy who runs the nudist retreat in 2016’s Zootopia.\n\n92. Paul Winchell isn’t just the voice of Hanna-Barbera’s Dick Dastardly, The Smurf‘s Gargamel, and Disney’s Shun Gon (The AristoCats (1970)), Zummi Gummi (The Adventures of the Gummi Bears), Boomer the woodpecker (The Fox and the Hound (1980)), and Tigger. He was also a ventriloquist, a show host, a humanitarian, philanthropist… and a medical pioneer. With his medical training as a pre-med at Columbia University, Winchell learned acupuncture and hypnosis and owned over 30 medical patents, including one for an artificial heart in 1963.\n\n93. In Hercules (1997), Phil originally reprimanded Herc after his fight with Nessuss to not fall for “big, blue eyes”. However, after coloring, Meg’s eyes were made purple. The decision was made to keep the expensive and time consuming animation and just have Devito tell his student to not all for “Big, goo-goo eyes” so his mouth synced up with the audio.\n\n94. Chadwick Boseman’s last performance as T’Challa in the Marvel Cinematic Universe was not in Avengers: Endgame (2019), but in the animated Disney+ limited series What if…? (2021).\n\n95. Clarence Nash, a gifted impressionist of bird calls, gained his Donald Duck voice by mimicking his pet goat. He auditioned for Disney reciting “Mary Had a Little Lamb” in the voice, which he did in Donald’s second appearance, Orphan’s Benefit (1934). He voiced the character up until his appearance in Mickey’s Christmas Carol in 1983.\n\n96. The last time Walt was supposed to voice Mickey Mouse was in Mickey in the Beanstalk from Fun and Fancy Free in 1947. However, in 1955, when The Mickey Mouse Club aired short animated intros with Mickey, Walt came over and said, “Hey, I can do Mickey’s voice, too, you know.” So the actual last time Walt voiced Mickey was asking kids in the fifties if they were “Neat n’ pretty?” Among other bits.\n\n97. James Baskett (Br’er Fox) passed away in 1948, long before Splash Mountain opened in Disneyland in 1985. Johnny Lee (Br’er Rabbit) passed in 1965. Only Br’er Bear’s Nic Stewart – who died in 2000 – was around to reprise his role for the ride, leaving Animaniacs‘ Jess Harnell to take over for Br’er Rabbit and J. D. Hall as Br’er Fox. When Disney historian Jim Hill asked Stewart about any untoward racist attitudes against him while making Song of the South (1946), Stewart laughed and said “Walt treated us like kings.”\n\n98. Dave Thomas and Rick Moranis were essentially reprising their roles as Bob and Doug McKenzie from SCTV and its spinoff movie Strange Brew (1983), when performing their roles as Rutt and Tuke, the Canadian moose from Brother Bear (2003). They reprised these roles for a commentary track on the film’s DVD release, and Disney even wanted a TV series based on them.\n\n99. Clarence Nash had the studio make him a Donald Duck ventriloquist puppet so he could entertain the troops on USO tours during World War II. Until the end of his life, he toured around schools, conventions, and other events, visiting kids, adults, and fans of all ages with the puppet.\n\n100. Then-four-year-old Mary Gibbs was the voice of Boo in Monsters Inc. (2001). Even though “Boo” is the name we all know her by, her character’s real name is also Mary…as indicated by her signing her name on some of her artwork in the movie.\n\nHappy 100th, Walt Disney Company."
