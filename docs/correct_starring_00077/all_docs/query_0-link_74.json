        "text": "The film The Aristocats was released in 1970, specifically 28 December 1970. Therefore I will presume that it was made during 1970 but there’s no guarantee that that was the case. It may have been made before then and released later but I think is reasonable to presume that it was made in 1970.\n\nUntil September 7th I will give 10 cents to an animal charity for every comment. It is a way to help animal welfare without much effort at no cost. Comments help this website too, which is about animal welfare.\n\nIt was originally written to serve as a 2-part show in the TV series Walt Disney’s Wonderful World of Color. However, Disney wanted it made as a theatrical feature. It was the last animated film authorised by Walt Disney, himself, before his death.\n\nThe Aristocats – Duchess meets Amelia and Abigail (HD):\n\nEva Gabor provided the voice for Duchess. Phil Harris was O’Malley, Dean Clark was Berlioz, Liz English was Marie, while Gary Dubin was Toulouse. In addition, Sterling Holloway was Roquefort, Nancy Kulp was Frou-Frou and Scatman Crothers was Scat Cat.\n\nIn 1971 a comic book adaptation of the film was published by Gold Key. The junior cats starred in Gold Key’s The Aristokittens, 9 issues of which were published from 1971 to 1975. From 1971 to 1974 Gold Key also published 9 issues of O’Malley and the Alley Cats.\n\nBelow is another video extract from this well-known cat cartoon film. It shows the kittens."
