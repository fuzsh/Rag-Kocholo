        "text": "Picking up exactly where we left off, even though the walk back to Paris was a total breeze unlike 101 Dalmatians, the kids are exhausted so instead of taking them back in the middle of the night. Thomas makes the decision to take them back to his place which is crappy, but also appears that a human also lives there. Who is this mysterious stranger? Well, we never find out.\n\nThomas assures the family that his place is quiet, and immediately afterwards the night is disturbed by music, as Thomas realises that Scat Cat and his gang are in town, and naturally crashing at Thomas’s place. Thomas tries to explain that the gang are not Duchess’s type and suggests they find other accommodations by explaining that they are “Swingers.”\n\nPromoting Duchess to ask; “What is a Swinger?”\n\nBest Line Ever!\n\nDuchess however wants to meet the “Swingers,” as we meet Scat Cat and the Alley Cats, who are a group of multi-ethnic musicians, and I give Duchess her dues in this scene, at how much she’s changed as a character. She clearly doesn’t judge Thomas for his lifestyle and friends and is polite to all of them and pretty much throws herself into the festivities, and I do think she’s done this before.\n\nScat Cat is interesting since he’s voiced by Scatman Crothers, and ok he’s the only black cat in this film, apart from his son so I’m prepared to dismiss any accusation of racism because it’s a great voice. It was originally intended for Louis Armstrong, but again he wasn’t able to work with Disney, so they drafted in someone of the same stature and Crothers was also the voice of “Hong Kong Phooey” so let’s leave this alone.\n\nWow, they even have the same taste in bows!\n\nAlso, Jazz did exist in 1910, and was coming into the mainstream and since Scat Cat has an American accent, I just assume he brought it over with him…although why there is a hippy cat is beyond me!\n\nWe launch into “Everybody wants to be a cat,” which is a bastardisation of so many musical genres and is totally awesome. Also, I still think this scene introduces Berlioz to his biological father Scat Cat! There is a moment that is considered racist because the Chinese cat called Shun Gon plays the piano with chopsticks, but it’s one-moment and the cat is voiced by Tigger’s voice artist Paul Winchell and as it sounds like Tigger, so I’m going to let this one go.\n\nAs they party into the night, Thomas and Duchess dance and Duchess shows off her harpist skills causing all the cats in Paris to fall in love with her as they party so hard the floors collapse, and I do hope this act hurt no one.\n\nLater on Duchess is putting the kittens to bed whilst Thomas peers in from above, and you can tell he’s totally in love with this family as he talks with Duchess about how fantastic his friends are (true), and Duchess’s opinion of him is that he’s brave (very true). You can tell Duchess is tempted of a life with Thomas, but like the canine Lady before her, she knows where she belongs as Thomas actually suggests her staying with him and letting him be a father to the kitten. Duchess sadly has to go back to her human, something that Thomas doesn’t understand but respects anyway even though the kittens have overheard this entire exchange and are clearly devastated.\n\nThis is what heart looks like, when it’s breaking.\n\nAs light across the morning breaks, Thomas escorts the family home and is impressed by the location whilst inside Edger is quaffing champagne and basking in his soon to come wealth before it’s interrupted by the kittens as Duchess is sadly saying farewell to Thomas. Roachfort has realised everything and fails trying to tell the cats to run (yes again he’s failed).\n\nAs they pass through the door, and back into their lives, Edger throws them into a sack and stuffs them in an oven…ok was he intending to cook them?\n\nMadam has heard their cries, but Edger convinces her otherwise as the Aristocats tell Roachfort to find Thomas, who he finds in seconds and Thomas tells Roachfort to get the Alley Cats and is Thomas insane? Even Roachfort points out how stupid this idea is. But naturally, no doubt pleased he’s doing something right, heads over to find them. But of course Roachfort has his brain wiped with pure fear at seeing the Alley Cats, forgets Thomas’s name. Bloody typical! Thankfully his brain clicks into gear, and soon all the cats are heading off to help Thomas save the love of his life.\n\nIn the stables, Edger has a new Master plan. I guess turning the oven on was too dark even for him as he throws the kittens in a truck bound for Timbuktu. As plans go, it’s a bit…oh yeah Stupid!\n\nThankfully Thomas jumps in and what ensures is a pretty well plotted scene as the rest of the Alley Cats burst in, and Roachfort finally does something useful by breaking open the lock of the trunk. But has to yell out “Quiet,” to get a moment’s peace and for some reason Edger reacts to this…so Edger can understand the mouse…ok then!\n\nEdger heard the Mouse talk…and Hong Kong Phooey is on his head!\n\nCutting it short, the cat’s escape Edger winds up in the trunk and is bound for Timbuktu…and I’m guessing will probably be dead in a few days from suffocation.\n\nIn the final scenes, everything is sorted, the family is reunited with Madam and Thomas settles down and stays with the family, so they get the father they always wanted and Duchess gets her “Little bit of rough!” who she clearly adores. And Edger, well Madam never finds out what happened to him, and never bothered contacting the Police when he suddenly disappeared with all his stuff left behind. Ok then!\n\nMadam, because she’s Madam and a little bit nuts, has decided with no heir instead to open her home to all the Alley Cats in Paris, as the music fills the air and everyone dances as we see Roachfort on the drums, the geese have joined the party and the dogs get the last line of the film “The End.”\n\nAnd thank god.\n\nFinal Thought: The thing about a Disney film is that it doesn’t need a Villain. Lady and the Tramp doesn’t. It has antagonists but not outright villains. This film could have been good, but it’s so damn weak. As a Villain, Edgar is weak, and it doesn’t help that the animation is frankly terrible, and the characters are fillers. Voice wise, the kittens are voiced by Gary Dubin, Louise English and Dean Clark as Toulouse, Marie and Berlioz. They all do well with the material, but they are not very memorable. However hearing Phil Harris as Thomas was a highlight, just like his previous role as Baloo he managed to combine humour with real sincerity and you just believed his performance. However, Duchess is voiced by Eva Gabor, now she’s not a professional voice artist, but at times especially in the first half of the film, her voice comes across as too forced, as if she’s trying to get an idea at how Duchess should speak. It only settles when she meets Thomas, as if her barrier has dropped. It’s not a bad performance, but not as strong as it should be. A weakness that is also inherited in Roddy Maude-Roxby as Edger, I know he like everyone in the cast is trying their best, but it’s too cartoonish, too weak and not what you expect from a Disney character let alone the Villain, and even of the story wasn’t ripped from 101 Dalmatians, the animation in a few scenes certainly was.\n\nOverall, this is a weak film, with weak characters and an even weaker story and in truth a poor entry in the Disney Canon."
