        "text": "Overall Rating:\n\nOne of the best dub jobs in my opinion! The voices are so similar! I am so amazed at their Japanese counterpart to the stylized voice of Phil Harris(Thomas O'Malley, Baloo the Bear, Little John). He is perfect! I will try to get some voice clips up here soon, but until then, you can always request the music from the MP3 page. They also did a very good job at picking someone for Duchess's character. Try finding a Japanese Eva Gabor. Impressive. I had forgotten how adorable the kittens are and I fell in love with this movie all over again. I admit I laughed at the Japanese Thomas O'Malley singing, \"ABURAMU DERACY JIOSHEPI KAYSHI.\" Highly recommended version."
