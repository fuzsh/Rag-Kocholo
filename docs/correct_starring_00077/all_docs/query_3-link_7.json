You will be able to access your list from any article in Discover.\n\nYou don't have any saved articles.\n\nThe discovery of hundreds of Homo naledi fossils was the largest such find ever made on the African continent. The fossils display a unique mix of modern and archaic traits and are shaking up our understanding of the origins and diversity of our human lineage.\n\nHomo naledi highlights, once again, that we can't think of human evolution in terms of ape-like ancestors gradually evolving more modern features in a linear fashion. Instead, multiple human species evolved in parallel and coexisted, sometimes side-by-side.\n\nMany mysteries surround Homo naledi, including how the remains got into the caves, what its tools were like, and how it survived alongside bigger-brained species.\n\nHomo naledi discovery: excavations deep within a cave\n\nThe first Homo naledi finds were discovered by cavers in a remote, almost inaccessible chamber deep within the Rising Star cave system.\n\nPalaeoanthropologist Lee Berger assembled a team of excavators who proceeded to recover more than 1,500 fossil bones belonging to at least 15 individuals, ranging from infants to elderly adults.\n\nThis video by Wits University (featuring recreational caver Rick Hunter who discovered the chamber) highlights just how difficult to reach the fossils were, and why the initial team sent to search for fossils was made up of smaller women:\n\nThe surprisingly young age of Homo naledi\n\nIt took a while for the Homo naledi remains to be dated. The age published in 2017 took scientists by surprise: they were between 236,000 and 335,000 years old.\n\n'This is astonishingly young for a species that still displays primitive characteristics found in fossils about two million years old,' says Prof Stringer.\n\nDespite the young date for the H. naledi fossils, their anatomy suggests that in evolutionary terms they could lie close to the origin of the genus Homo, suggesting that this is a relic species, retaining many primitive traits.\n\nImportantly, the young age means Homo naledi was living on the African continent with a number of other bigger-brained humans, including our own species Homo sapiens.\n\nHow did the bones get into the cave?\n\nHow Homo naledi remains got to their final resting place is a matter of active debate.\n\nThe Dinaledi Chamber where they were found is located deep within the cave system - around 80 metres from any known entrance or opening to the surface - and must have always been in in darkness.Â\n\nThe discovery of at least three more individuals in the Lesedi Chamber, equally remote and dark and over 100 metres away, further adds to the mystery.\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest the humans ever lived so deep in the caves. So how did the bones get there - were they deposited there by natural means or other humans?\n\nThe authors of the first Homo naledi studies rejected scenarios such as water carrying the bones there or predators dragging them there. Instead, they favour the idea that other members of the species disposed of bodies in the caves intentionally and repeatedly.\n\nProf Stringer isn't convinced: 'Many experts, including me, consider such complex behaviour unlikely for a creature with a brain size close to that of a gorilla, particularly when a requirement for the controlled use of fire, for lighting, probably has to be added in.\n\n'I think alternatively it's possible that, now and again, individuals sought refuge deep in the cave to escape from predators or other humans. Without light and climbing equipment, once deep in the cave, there may have been no way back. Over hundreds or thousands of years, this behaviour could have led to an accumulation of bodies deep in the cave.'\n\nWhat kind of tools did Homo naledi make?\n\nThis is another of the mysteries associated with this species.\n\nHomo naledi's hands and wrists were well-suited to tool making but no stone tools have yet been found associated with its fossils. However, Prof Stringer thinks it is 'highly likely that naledi's handiwork is already present in the archaeological record we have for southern Africa, but it is currently unrecognised or attributed to another human species'.\n\nHow did Homo naledi survive against bigger-brained competition?\n\nTheÂ teeth and lower body skeleton suggestÂ Homo nalediÂ may have had a lifestyle and diet similar to other hunter-gatherers present elsewhere in Africa at the same time, such as late Homo heidelbergensis and earlyÂ Homo sapiens.\n\nAlthough we do have another example of a small-brained species surviving until relatively recently - the diminutiveÂ Homo floresiensisÂ in Indonesia - that probably survived because it was isolated on an island.\n\n'PerhapsÂ Homo nalediÂ was relatively geographically isolated for much of its evolutionary history,' says Prof Stringer.\n\n'Or did it avoid competition by continuing a different niche for feeding and lifestyle, allowing it to survive longer? It could have spent more time feeding in and around trees, as might be indicated by its upper body skeleton and curved fingers.'\n\nSmall but human-like brain\n\nRecent research, published in the journal PNAS in 2018, examined imprints Homo naledi's brain made on its skull. The findings, say the authors, indicate that the evolution of brain size in humans was not a simple pattern of gradual increase over time.\n\nThe team found that, despite the difference in size, the structure of Homo naledi's frontal lobe was similar to that of other human species rather than that of non-human hominins or great apes.\n\nOther parts of the brain also showed human-like changes compared to more primitive australopithecines with a similar brain size.\n\nThe authors point out that the areas of the brain found to be similar to other humans have been implicated in the evolution of tool use, language and social behaviour and may mean Homo naledi shared some behaviours present in other humans, despite a much smaller brain size.\n\nThis article includes information fromÂ Our Human StoryÂ by Dr Louise Humphrey and Prof Chris Stringer."
