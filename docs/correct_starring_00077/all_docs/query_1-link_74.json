        "text": "VIDEO and AUDIO\n\nThe Aristocats looks just about perfect on Blu-ray. The film's first DVD presented it in the old television standard of 1.33:1, a ratio no longer being used much theatrically by 1970. The second DVD matted the film to 1.75:1 and it felt a little cramped. Blu-ray now gives us a 1.66:1 aspect ratio, which may very well just be a compromise. While that's not a ratio American cinema has commonly used, it has been employed on a number of animated Disney films, particularly those made with CAPS. Whatever the reasoning, the mildly updated new framing looks good and still takes advantage of nearly every available pixel.\n\nThis dramatic restoration appears to be on par with Disney's top of the line Platinum/Diamond Edition efforts. The element is sharp and pristine, lines are bold, colors are vibrant. Some might consider this a step too far. Aristocats and other Disney 'toons from this era had kind of a raw, scratchy look to them, with animator pencil lines somehow featuring in the final product.\n\nWe get mere glimpses of that here, in certain single frames of moving characters. The movie looks better cleaned up, but one wonders if the scrubbing in a way betrays the original presentation. You can always hang on to the Gold Collection DVD for its relatively rough 1.33:1 transfer. And at least continuity errors (like Duchess' collar mid-scene color change) are not fixed.\n\nThe 5.1 DTS-HD master audio mix is good, though not the revelation that the picture quality is. Sound is crisp and vivacious throughout, though it is not the most expansive of presentations. Not that it should be, if the movie wasn't made that way. French, Spanish, and Portuguese dubs and subtitles are offered.\n\nThe DVD doesn't seem to update the Special Edition transfer, which gives us 1.75:1 framing and the '80s/'90s Walt Disney Pictures castle at the start of the film (the Blu-ray preserves the original Buena Vista card). The Blu-ray offers clear improvement over the Special Edition DVD's already clearly improved presentation.\n\nBONUS FEATURES\n\nAll of the Blu-ray's extras are presented in standard definition, unless otherwise noted.\n\nFirst up is \"The Lost Open\" (9:31, HD), a newly-uncovered deleted story and song sequence meant to open the film. Richard Sherman introduces and narrates storyboards, which lead into a two-part demo he made with his late brother Robert.\n\nAn HD music video is provided for D!tto's \"Oui Oui Marie\" (1:53), a new song which incomprehensibly Auto-Tunes Marie's lines and leaves untouched other spoken dialogue from the film. The kitten doesn't take to this format as smoothly as Mr. Rogers recently did.\n\nThe \"classic\" deleted song \"She Never Felt Alone\" (7:56) is presented from storyboards and Hermione Baddeley demo, with Richard Sherman introducing and elaborating the material. Sherman then plays and sings part of the song himself.\n\nWatch a clip from the new Blu-ray exclusive bonus feature \"The Lost Open\":\n\nTwo significant features fall under the heading Classic Backstage Disney (there's a lot of \"classic\" usage here). \"The Sherman Brothers: The Aristocrats of Disney Songs\" (4:24) has the two secretly estranged collaborators reflect upon their Aristocats work, with Richard playing and singing some while Robert stares into space.\n\n\"The Great Cat Family\" (12:51) is a relevant excerpt from a 1956 episode of the \"Disneyland\" anthology series. Walt himself introduces this animated history of the feline, which covers the species' journey from object of worship by the Ancient Egyptians to slayer of rats during the Black Death plague to target of prejudice and fear in the Witch Hunts. While I'm not sure how accurate it all is, it is a highly entertaining cartoon, one which demonstrates this long-running series' quality efforts (when it wasn't just promoting the newest Disney movie, anyway).\n\nClassic Music & More holds what should be a standard Disney feature: Disney Song Selection. Watch any or all of the movie's four musical numbers (10:53) with plain white subtitles providing the lyrics. There is also a clear option to watch the entire movie with song lyrics appearing.\n\nFinally, the \"classic\" bonus short Bath Day (6:40), tuxedo cat Figaro (of Pinocchio fame) gets a bath from Minnie Mouse that makes him the laughingstock of the neighborhood and the target of a tough red alley cat.\n\nAt least one of last week's Disney animated combo packs got it right. The second disc here is simply The Aristocats' 2008 Special Edition DVD, unchanged but for new disc-opening trailers and plain gray disc art. While fans usually take Disney to task for a lack of effort, in this case it was warranted. By not authoring a lame new DVD simply watering down the Blu-ray (essentially a coaster for the hardcore Disney collectors most attracted to this release), Disney has salvaged a number of bonus features that otherwise would have been lost.\n\n\"The Aristocats Scrapbook\" serves up eighteen pages of concept art, color studies, storyboard sketches, behind-the-scenes photos, publicity art, merchandise, and premiere pictures. It's valuable content that would have been nice to get in high definition.\n\nGamers meanwhile can sleep easy knowing that two items will remain in print. The set-top \"Fun with Language\" game is apparently meant for young children learning English and discovering the world. More exciting is a Virtual Kitten game, which you can enjoy in set-top form or a more elaborate DVD-ROM version. Either way, it's like a virtual Tamagotchi resembling one of the Aristocats' litter or Figaro.\n\nThe DVD also hangs onto most of the extras found on the Blu-ray, only lacking the two new items, that bizarre \"Oui Oui Marie\" remix and \"The Lost Open.\" Everything else is available on both discs.\n\nThe discs open with ads for Disney Studio All Access, Cinderella: Diamond Edition, and Finding Nemo 3D. The menu's Sneak Peeks listing repeats those and follows up with promos for Disney Movie Rewards, Disney Parks, Tinker Bell's Secret of the Wings, The Rescuers & The Rescuers Down Under: 2 Movie Collection, Beverly Hills Chihuahua 3, and Planes.\n\nWHAT'S MISSING?\n\nNone of the extras from the movie's original Gold Collection DVD were carried over to the Special Edition and none resurface here. Most missed, and least necessarily so, was a trailer from a 1980s rerelease. Also gone are an Aristocats read-along storybook, a 17-question trivia game, and -- in early copies, at least -- a \"Fun with Music\" booklet.\n\nMENUS, PACKAGING and DESIGN\n\nThe Blu-ray features a standard montage of clips set to an instrumental version of Maurice Chevalier's title song. The DVD's recycled menu scheme loops animation from the \"Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat\" scene. The Blu-ray does not resume playback or support bookmarks, but it does remember where you left off if you didn't finish the film in one sitting. It also lets you skip most pre-menu videos with a single press of the button\n\nThis set is available in both DVD and Blu-ray packaging. My review copy was the latter. The case is topped by a faintly holographic and extensively embossed cardboard slipcover with an in-case insert supplying the obligatory Disney Movie Rewards code, which will also apparently net you a free download of an Aristocats Disney Classics storybook app (retail value: $3.99). The packaging is noteworthy for assigning spine placement to two of the most minor characters in Disney history: the English and Italian cats.\n\nCLOSING THOUGHTS\n\nThe Aristocats is not as distinctive or substantial as some of Disney's other animated animal tales,\n\nbut it's a charming and fun adventure in its own right. Anyone fond of the grand tradition to which it so clearly belongs will likely agree that this little feline film holds up well.\n\nThis mid-level entry gets a pretty solid Blu-ray, one that satisfies to a greater degree than last week's slightly frustrating other animated combo packs. Unlikely and unneeded to be revisited anytime soon, this is one Disney release you can buy without reservations."
