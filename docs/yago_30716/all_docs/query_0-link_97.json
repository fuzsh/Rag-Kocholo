The continual aggrandisement of the state rendered obsolete the fundamental laws of its constitution, which became imperceptibly mod^ed in proportion as political emergencies appeared to require alterations. When the power of Bern was doubled by the conquest of the Vaud, the assembly of the burghers ceased to be thought of. The dignities of the state became hereditary in those families which had.on<ie obtained a seat in the great council. It is true thaf the other Viurghers remained eligible to public functions; but it was rarely indeed, and generally by means of intermarriages, that a new family raised itself to the rank of the rulers de facto. ^ The administration of these ruling families was, in general, not devoid of wisdom and equity; and, in fact, the principal subject of complaint was that participation in state affairs had ceased to loe open to all. It was, however, orecisely this system of aristocratic exclusion which was felt so insupportably oy many of those who were subjected to it, that so early as 1710 attempts were made to break it up. These were renewed with increased vjgour, in 1743, by six -and- twenty burghers, who combined to petition the council for the revival of a greater equality of rights in favour of the general body of cit- izens. These adventurous men incurred the censure of the authorities, and were placed under arrest in their houses or banished. Amongst the exiles was Samuel Hentzi, a man of no ordinary talent and spirit. He had fixed on Neuch^tel as the place of his banishment, the term of which was shortened by the favour of the authorities. On his iretum, the embarrassed state in which he found his domestic economy, and the ill success of his efforts to obtain a lucrative office, may have mingled with other motives in inducing him to take the lead in a desperate undertaking of a little band of malcontents, who, without money, arms, or even unity of purpose, dreamed of overturning a government strong in its own resources, and sure of support from the whole Helvetic body, and' of instituting equality of rights among all burghers, and appointment to all offices by lot. Yet, with all their root-and-branch work, the conspirators had no idea of remedying the real defects of the state, of satisfying the prevalent and increasing diccou- tents of the Vaud, or of procuring an extension of political rights to the whole people: for, in the plan of a constitution annexed to their intended manifesto, exclusive regard was paid to the burghers at Bern; and the rest of the people would hardly have been bettered by their accession to the dimities which had hitherto been engrossed by the ruling families. The 13th of July, 1749, was fixed for the execution of the plans of the conspirators; but many of their own number had opened their eyes by this time to the utter impossibility of success, produced loy the disunion and imprudence of their colleagues — to the passion and cupidity of some, and the atrocious hopes of murder and plunder entertained by others. No man felt more sensibly the criminal views of his party than the only man of ability and public spirit among them, Hentzi. He would not betray those with whom he had long pursued the same object; but he made an attempt to save himseK by flight from further participation in their jolans and foreseen destiny. It was too late: a betrayer had already done his work. Hentzi and other leaders of the party were taken and beheaded during the first exasperation of the government. Sentence of death was also pronounced upon some who had made their escape; others were imprisoned or banished, but soon afterwards pardoned. On embarking with ner two sons to quit the Helvetic territory, the wife of Hentzi exclaimed, “ I would rather see these children sink in the Rhine-stream than they should not one day learn to THE 18TH CEUTTUEY [1781 Jl.d.] , , , avenge the murder of their father/’ However, when the sons came to inari- hood they displayed more magnanimity tlian their mother; and one of thenn, who rose to distinction in the service of the Netherlaiids, ro(jiuted with Rood offices to the burghers of his native town the unmerited misfortunes whic.h in olden times, equality of rights for all burghers had heen settled as a principle — ^an aristocracy no less close than in Ih^rn, had formed itself since the middle of the seventeenth century- A tew houses, ' under the denomination of secret families, had contrived to ojtclude, not only the cduntry people, but a large proportion likewise ol the town burghers, from all' participation in public aftairs ; and, in 1684, admission into the num- ber of these secret families was rendered wholly impossible. I rom thence- forwards, constantly increasing discontent displi^ed itself both in town and country. Scvonil very moclorfito proposals for B.lloviciting’ tho prossuro of tluH oligarchy were rejected with such haughtiness by the govenimont that ttiH- affection swelled into revolt. In itSl Peter Nicholas Chenaux of la Tour de Tr^me, John Fetor Rats- caud, '>nd an advocate of Gruy^sres of the name of Castellus^:, formed a loagutj for the achievement of a higher degree of freedom, First they endoavour(‘<d to work upon the people by fair promises. Tlien Clienaux, at the head of a ^select band of fifty or sixty, undertook to terrify the govmimmt into a eoiU\" promise. But the gates being closed on the party, and the walls maniUHl with armed burghers, this undertaking ended in open revolt. Tlie loll of alarm-bells summoned up the country people from eviuy hill and valkw in the canton to assist in tie coercion of the domineering capitfil A body cif nearly three thousand men encamped before the walls of Fribourg, and further aid was hourly expected. The terrified burghers instantly (ndled for the armed intervention of Bern, and the latter tiown detached a part of its guard without delay. Three hundred dragoons marched upon Fnbtnirg, and were to be followed by fourteen hundred foot. The burghers of Fribourg now thought themselves strong enough to meet force with forcci. Thc^ gar- risoij. made a sally from the town, and on the first sight of the Berm'se ling, not to mention the heavy artillery, the malcontents solicited an ariniHlice. The surrender of their arms and of the ringleaders was <lemaiidtal an prelim- inary to all negotiation. The people refused the latter of these coiulitionn, but fled panic-struck on the first attack, without making any nwistaman The whole affair would have ended without bloodslied, had not the leader Chenaux been murdered in his flight by Henry Rosier, hirnsedf one of the pop- ular party. The two remaining heads of the insurgents got ehiiir off ; ilJlu*- naux’s corpse was delivered to the public executioner, and his hetad fixecl on a spear above the Romont gate. Sentence of death was paHStal on CasUdlas^. and Raccaud, the two fugitives. Several others wcrci visibal with Ichm degrt'os of punishment: new reinforcements from Bern, Bolothurn, and LuenH^m^ secured the town from any recurrenco of tumult, and their iimbaasiuitirH strove to promote the restoration of tranquillity. It was ordered tt) pro- claimed, from all the pulpits, that the council was well disposed to prote(‘.t the old and well attested rights of its loving subjects, as well as to hetar, with its never-failing graciousness, every suitalSle and respectful representiRioin Three days were allotted to each commune to lay their com|)laint8 and wishes before the government, through delegates. But when months elapiad with- out the popular grievances haying obtained a hear in, the loss of Clitnaux began to be appreciated. Multitudes assembled round nis tomb wecfiing and praying: pilgrimages, as if to the tomb of a saint, were made thitiier with THE HISTOHY OF SWITZERLA^STD [1707-1714 A. t>.J banners, and with crucifixes. Vainly were these demonstrations of feeling stigmatised by the government as crime against the s^ate, by the bishop as impious profanations. They were neither to be checked by posting sentinels, nor fulminating excommunications. They were the last sad consolation of the people — the last substitute for hopes that were already given up. DISORDERS AT GENEVA (1707-1782 A.D.) Shortly after the establishment of Genevan independence, it had been decreed by the general assembly, for the better suppression of hostile attempts against their hard-won freedom, that whoever should propose a change in the government of Geneva should be considered to deserve capital punish- ment. This did not, however, hinder alterations being made, at different times, in various parts of the constitution. So early as the middle of the sixteenth century, the laws were revised and improved. The advantageous situation of the town and the long duration of peace promoted the 'increase of wealth in Geneva and the rise of many families to opulence. These families aimed at separating themselves from their fellow citizens, even in their places of habitation, by settling in the upper part of the town, near the council- house, while the other burghers inhabited the lower town. The principal families already regarded themselves as a standing patriciate; and even the name of patrician came into use in the acts of council . The year 1707 witnessed an effort of the inferior burghers to wrest from the principal families a part of their usurped power, and to introduce amend- ments in the constitution.^ In this emergency, the council invoked the mediation of Bern and Zurich, received a confederate garrison, and main- tained itself by force of arms and by execution of its principal antagonists. A renewal of the disturbances which had been quelled by such violent meas- ures, was produced, in 1714, by the imposition of an arbitrary tax by the council for the enlargement and completion of the fortifications of the town. This stretch of power occasioned great discontent among the burghers; bitter attacks and censures on the government appeared in print; and the more strictly these were prohibited, they obtained the more eager perusal ' and credence. One of the arch-promoters of the rising storm was Michael Ducrest, a Genevan burgher and noble, an officer in the army, and a member of the great coimcil. This man op]posed himself with extraordinary vehemence to the building of the new fondfications, and heaped offensive charges on the parti- sans of the measure. The government condemned him to recant, and, on his evading compliance by flight, a penal sentence was pronounced against him. New attempts which he made to excite disturbance were followed by a sen- tence of perpetual imprisonment. This sentence could not be put in exe- cution, as Ducrest had taken refuge under a foreign jurisdiction, where he set at defiance the council of Geneva, and provoked that body to such a degree by his writings and intrigues against them, that sentences more and more severe were heaped upon his head, until at length the most offensive of his writings was torn by the hangman, and his effigy was suspended from the gallows. His person, however, enjoyed impunity till 1744, when he was taken into custody in the territory of Bern. ^ The government of Geneva did not thirst for his blood, and was content with his perpetual imprisonment. Even in tins situation he contrived to mix in Hentzi^s conspiracy, was con- fined in the castle of Aarburg, and closed, in extreme old age, as a state THE 18TH CENTURY 3 [1734-1783 A.D.J prisoner^ fi life which, h© had spent in incessant labours in the cause of democ\"' Meanwhile Geneva continued to be agitated by party manoeuvres and popular discontenta. In the year 1734 a body of eight hundred burghers addressed themselves to the' heads of the governnient, desiring the curtail- fnent of the projected fortifications, and the repeal of the tax levied for that object. The council ofily replied by preparations for (Icfcncc ; urcanua were transported to the council ..lall ; barricades erected in the^ approaches thither as well as in those to the upper town, where the principal class f>i burghers lived, and the garrison kept in readiness to act on the first signal. All this apparatus was regarded with mistrust by the burghers, who were still farther provoked by reports of the approach of Bernese troops, and by the removal of a part of the town artillery to the upper regions, while two and twenty other pieces were spiked. The multitude made themselveH masters of the city guard, pointed field-pieces on the road by which the troops from Bern were ex] 3 ected, and tumultuously demanded tlie convocation of the burgher assemb.ly, the sovereign authority of Geneva. The council con- trived to win over the members of this body so far that they votcnl imaiU\" mously the completion of the fortifications and the continuance of the tax for ten years. The declaration of an amnesty and improvement of the ^criminal and judicial administration formed the rest of their business. The burghers laid down their arms and returned to their ordinary vocations; so that an embassy which arrived from Zurich and Bern found Geneva in a state of apparent tranquillity. Permanent ill-will was fostered only against the syndic Trembley, com- mander of the garrison and conductor of the defensive preparations of the council. Whatever this person had done by the instruiitions of tfic council was laid to his individual account, and added to the mass of dark imputa- tions which were heaped on him, as the head of an already obnoxious family. He plumed himself on the favour of^ the confederate ambassadors, and for- feited thus the last chance of retrieving himself in the public opinion. The remembrance of the armed intemntion of Zurich and Bern, in 1707, was too recent to admit of their ambassadors doing any good to Trembley h cause through the medium of pacific intercession. The departure of these enibassies removed the only screen of the syndic: he demanded his disinisHion, whieli was refused him, in order to deprive him of his functions more ignomiruously. No resistance or artifice of a powerful connection could save him: the tumults were renewed with increased fury; and the question soon ceased to ri^gartl the person or party of Trembley, and became that of the triumph of tlie aristocratic or democratic principle at Geneva. In 1737, the council ventured several arrests, and the consequence was that the whole body of burghers rushed to arms, and the council was defeated, not without bloodshed. A garrison from Bern and Zurich was thrown into the town : the aml)a«mdora of these cantons, in concert with the French ambaaaadorH, undertook the office of mediators, and in 1738 framed a constitution which set limite to tlie assum]Dtions of the council and the principal families, and was gratefully and all but unanimously accepted as a fundamental law l)y the burgjors. After four-and”twenty years of repose and prosperity, occasion was given to new political movements at Geneva by a subject of a nature purely specu- lative. It pleased more than one government about this time to apply the doom of fire, which had been visited by inquisitors on the ilFfated victims of their zealotry, to certain of the more remarkable works of the human intellect — a proceeding highly calculated to draw the eyes of the reading public on 6 THE HISTOEY OF SWITZEELAND ® [1703-1768 A-B.] productions which seemed worthy of such simal condemnation. On the &st appearance of that work of Rousseau whiA opened views so novel and SO striking on the moral and still more on the physical education of man, the parliament of Paris had the work burned by the Jiangnaan, and sentenced Lusseau to imprisonment, which he only escaped by ^ght. Both of there decisions were immediately repeated by the council of Geneva [17b2j, improved on them by launching a like condemnatory senfence against the Cmtrat Social of the same author. It was in yam that Rousseau s connec- tions demanded a copy of the sentence against him : their reitoated demands, though supported by a large body of burghers, were rejected ^y the council. The noDulM party, which vindicated the right of the burgher as-sembly to ^ ^ ^ bring up representations or remon- strances against the council on any sub- ject under discussion, distinguished themselves by the name of representa- tives. Their claims were met by assert- ing a droit n6gatif, or-ri^ht of rejection, on the strength of which the council pretended that nothing that should not rave been previously consented to by themselves could come before the gen- eral asst^mbly. The partisans of the council were called negatives. The tranquillity of Geneva was once more disturbed to such a degree by passionate discourses, party writings, and manmuvres that the ambassadors of Zurich, Bern, and France again in- terfered, and pronounced themselves in favour of the council. The representa- tives rejected their decision, the am- bassadors left Geneva, French troops advanced on the town, and all trade and intercourse were suspended. But the French ministry speedily became luke- warm in the cause of the negatives. The latter, when they found them- selves abandoned by all foreign aid, apprehending what might ensue, patched up a peace with the representatives. By a compact closed in Marcli, 1768, the burghers acquired valuable rights, and even a third party, that of the so- called natifs or hahitans (old inhabitants, excluded by birth from taking part in public affairs), obtained extended franchises, and was flattered with a prospect of participation in all the rights of citizenship. But on recovery from the first panic, reciprocal hatred soon revived. The negatives were vexed at having made such important sacrifices, and aimed at resuming all their former ascendency. Moreover they found a favourable hearing in the French court, which had long viewed with an evil eye the trade and wealth of Geneva, desired to raise the neighbouring Versoix to a com- mercial town, and hoped, by encouraging tumult and disorder at Geneva, either to annihilate its industry and opulence, or ultim^rt^e ^o l^ri ^ the sovereignty of France. IVench emissaries therefore aided^ the negatives in spiriting the natifs up against the representatives, by promising to confer on them “me franchises withheld by the latter. But the representatives flew Jean Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778) THE 18TH CENTURY 7 [1782 i.D.] to arms, took possession of the gates, and speedily succeeded in disarming the unpractised and undisciplined mob of natifs. Well aware by what manoeuvres the natifs had been led to revolt, they prudently abstained from taking any vindictive measures against them; but, on the contrary, inipartetl to them, in 1781, that equalioy of rights which had been promised by the negatives, and endeavoured thus to win them over permanently to the com- mon cause. The coimcil, on the other hand, impelled by French influence, (kjclared the newly conferred rights illegally extorted, and invoked the mediation of Bern and Zurich. But, betwixt representative stubboriuiess and negatives assumption, tne ambassadors of these towns could exert but limitocl influence. They essayed to put an end to disputes by amicable arrangements, but W(^r(^ baffled by the intrigues of the French court, which was rcisolved to rccogniscj no deiUocratical system on its frontiers, and soon proceedcKl to open force, in support of its secret policy. The first act of aggression was to garrison Versois^; a measure which gave just offence to Zurich and Bc‘rn, who th(UXi- upon mnomiced all adhesion to the mediation of 1738, and left the (Jeiu^vans to their own discretion. France also declared she would mix no more in t.lu! affairs of Geneva; the government was overthrown and a now constitution established. Zurich and Bern now declared formally and coldly that they (‘.ould not, acknowledge .a government erected by revolt. Still more indiguaiiou was emlited by France and Savoy, who entered into a league for the coercion of the town. Bern, too, joined this league in 1782, that the dcjstiny of Gcmciva, that point d’amui of her own dominion, might not lie trusttnl altogether to the caprices of foreign powers. On the appearance of the allied troops liefore the gates of Geneva, the burghers, unaware of the bad state of their (l(!feU(^.eH, swore to bu^ themselves in the ruins of their native town rather than yield. But when the cannon of the besiegers was advanced up to their walls, and tlie alternative of desperate resistance or surrender was off(5r(Kl, tlu^ disunitcKl city opened her gates without stroke of sword, after the primupal heads of the representative party had taken to flight. Mortal dread accompanied the victorious troops as they entercMl Geneva. Many had reason to tremble for their lives, their liberty, and posHt^Bsions. No punishments, however, were inflicted, excepting only tlie banishment of iho principal popular leaders; but the rights of the burghora were all in ist entirely annihilated by the arbitrary arrangements of the viidors; thc^ governm<iid was invested by them with almost unlimiteci power, ami jiroccicdiMl umlcr tla^ir auspices to prohibit all scored societies, military cxorcnmjs, Ijooks and pfun» ©vents, ^(1 to rc-inforcc the garrison by twelves hundrcul imni reduc(!d to utter subjtjction, ami emigration.

But nothing could ITcalid H KTT'Huuut, The iniquity of tl«> destruction of their francluses, and the dis- e™ f hi maL^w«®’- wounded irrecoverably the fe«lings of this burgh- nad ever wished or expected. At length, on the death of Vorgouucs, tlio S THE HISTOEY OF SWITZEELAND [ 1748-1767 A.D.] French minister, and arch enemy of Genevan independence, the spirit of freedom awoke with all its ancient strength in Gene'^^'a, and the burghers arose to break their slavish fetters. But the recital of the subsequent occur- rences must be postponed until we come to notice the train of events fired by the French Revolution . TUMULTS IN NEUCHATEL The little principality of Neuch&tel, the succession of which had descended in the same Ime since the era of the second Burgundian monarchy, came, in 1707, into the hands of the king of Prussia, as next heir to the ancient house of Chalons. In 1748, Frederick II displayed that love of economy which dis- tinguished all his measures, by fanning out certain parts of the public revenue arising from tithes, ground rents, and the crown lands ; from the former administration of which many of the inhabitants had enjoyed considerable profits. The loss of these, of course, was felt as a grievance by the losers; but what was viewed with more concern by the mass of tlie inhabitants wfis the prospect of still further innovations. Accordingly five communes of the Val de Travers transmitted their remonstrances through a delegate to Berlin ; and their example was soon afterwards followed throughout the principality. The arrival of two commissaries, despatched by the king to Neuch^ltel, was viewed with discontent as an encroachment on its immunities. Shortly after their coming, an attempt was made to put in execution the proposed financial system, of which the only result was to provoke a tumultuous poi> ular movement. On the 7th of January, 1767, the burgher assembly of Neuchitel passed a resolution of exclusion from the rights of citizenship, against all who should farm or guarantee the farming of the revenues. On this the royal commissary, Von Derschau, brought a suit before the council of Bern, against the town of Neuchtel; and the advocate-general, Gaudot, who had formerly been a popular favourite, much to the surprise of his fellow- citizens, seceded to the royal side, and thenceforwards gave his active assist- ance to the commissary. ^ The cause was decided^ at Bern (with some limitations) in the royal favour. With regard to the resolutions of the Neuch^tel burghers, already referred to, it was decreed that they should be cancelled in the presence of the burgher assembly, and a public^ apology made to the vice-governor. The costs of the whole process to be paid by the town. Gaudot, who had attacked the civic immunities both by word and writing, naturally became an object of popular indignation. By way of compensation, however, he received a lucrative government office, along with the functions of procurator-general, from which another man had been removed who possessed the popular favour. He returned to Neuch^tel from Bern with the royal plenipotentiaries. These and the vice-governor advised him to take up his residence in the castle; but, in spite of taeir recommendations, Gaudot thought fit to repair to his own residence. The same evening, clamour and disturbance took place around the house, which the magistrates were forced to protect by military force. The next morning the mob returned in increased numbers, and was still further exasperated by missiles being thrown down upon them. A carriage, escorted by servants in the royal livery, which had been sent by the king's commissary for Gaudot, was Imocked to pieces by the infuriated multitude. Gaudot and his nephew now imprudently fired from the windows, and their shots took effect, fatally for themselves. The exasperated populace forced its way into the house; Gaudot was killed by three shots, and the mob dis- THE 18TH CBNTIJEY ® persed after the deed, with cries of ^'Long live the king!” The chief in this tragedy esc 9 ]oed, and could be executed only in effigy. f! ^ p xUa affair was ultimately compromised by the benevolent moderation of the ereat Frederick; and terms of pacification were accepted by the communeH, vffiich provided alike against' ar Ditrary government and popular ;; On this occasion, Frederick displayed more generosity than would hay been shown by any cantonal government; and his conduct seeiueil t() justify the general reflection, whicfi must often occur to the student of Swiss history , that when administrative abuses are introduced into a monarchy , it re- quires a well-disposed and enlightened prince to crush the g^uig of ofhcia opprecsors and extortioners; because such a prince is powerfully backed m such measures by the public ojDinion. Whereas, when the majority oi t u ruling class in misnamed republics is corrupted so far to speculate on tlui profits of malversation, it generally takes care to recruit its ranks with nisw accomplices; or, at all events, only to promote to public offices siich men as will at least shut their eyes to public abuses. The magnammity of h a 'nek was but) ill repaid to his successor by the tumults which ensucul in N<ui(‘.hat(‘l on the commencement of the French Revolution; and we have latiuy seen the same misunderstandings, as in the last century, arise betwetm the now canton of Neuchfitel and its Prussian sovereign. ARISTOCRACY AND DEMOCRACY The democratical cantons, where the assembled population ex(‘rciHed the supreme power in their laTidsgcrneiTidef hold the lowest station, iu^ nluiost every respect, amongst the confederates. Narrowness of miiul and ignorant hatred of all innovation withstood every proposal of improwunont; while passion and prejudice, aided by the artifices of demagogues, often ocy.asicmed acts of crying injustice. Judicial proceedings werti in the liighcst dt‘gren arbitrary; confession of crimes was extracted by torture, which, indeed, was often employed when nothing more remained to confess. ^ Capital |)unishmcnt, even for minor offences, was by no means rare. Public officijs, particularly that of bailiff or land-vogt, were commonly conferred not on the worthiest hut on the highest bidder; and the proceeds of this ignominious^ traflk^ wiuit to the public treasury. Was it to be wondered at if thes(V functi<)nari(‘s in \\hm turn set justice up to auction in their bailiwicks, and (mdeavtmrc(l io rcu^ovtu* their advances to the government by every sort of oppression of its suhjectH? .Mental cultivation was extremely neglected in these, cantons, Hc.hmtillc establishments were rare, and those for education W(n*e, for the most pari, in the hands of the capuchins; whose esj^it de corfw was at k^asi (jn pme. omi- sion beneficial, by preventing the admission of the Jesuits into tlu^ eanion of Schwytz in 1758. Elsewhere, however, similar indiKsnces procluciul worH<^ effects. ‘In Glarus, so late as 1780, an unfortunate servant girl was (*xecideil as a witch, on the charge of having lamed the leg of a chiltl by magh*., and having caused it to vomit pins. Credulous aouls wims even found to the affirmation that the girl had administen^d pin-seed^ throuifh tlie mislium of a magical cake, which had afterwards borne its fruit within tlu^ body of the. child. The political relations of these cantons, in the pinlod now us, were of little importance. The constitutions of the arisiocratical cantons had all of tlunn thin cir- cumstance in common, that not only the capital towns asHumed th(^ of the whole canton, but the burghers of those towns thetrisfjves wer(‘ <lividcd into ruling and non-ruling families, of which the forme.r monopolisiul admis- 10 THE HISTOKY OF SWITZERLAND [1780 A. D.] sion to all places of honour. But the governments of these cantons deserve to be treated of more at length. Bern, which, in the first period after its foundation, bad no domains of any importance outside its walls, possessed in that immediately preceding the French revolution a territory containing more than 400,000 inhabitants. This considerable tract of land was administered by 260 ruling families, of. which, however, only about sixty were hi actual possession of the government; and these again were divided into so-called great and small families, and did not easily suffer others to rise to an equality with them. The sovereign [lower resided in 299 persons, of whom the great council was composed. A little council or senate of five-and-twenty formed the executivu. Th:i rural districts and the Pays de ^^aud wore governed by land-vogts or bailiffs. It was chiefly there that discontent prevailed against the Bernese government. The nobles of the Pays de Vaud were rendered wholly insensible to the real and solid advantages secured to them by that government, by resentment of their exclusion from all public employments. The peasants of that district, for the most part subjects or bondsmen of the nobles, sighed under the weight of feudal oppression and its accustomed offspring, poverty, neglected culture, mental and moral abortion. Davel A singular attempt at revolt was made in 1723 by Major Daniel Abraham Davel, a well-intentioned man, of excellent character, but a decided political and religious enthusiast, possessed with the idea that he was called by inspira- tion to emancipate the Vaud from Bern. He assembled the regiment of militia which he commanded, under the pretext of a review, and with these troops, who were altogether ignorant of his real design, and unprovided with stores or ammunition, he surprised the town of Lausanne at a point of time wlieii ^1 the Bernese land-vogts had gone to Bern for the annual installation. Davel offered his aid for the restoration of independence to the hastilv assembled towm council. He found, however, no kindred spirit in that body; and the cautious citizens put him off with fair words till a force was undc*r anns sufficient to crush him. Meanwhile his troops had discovered the real object of their commander, and shrank from him in surprise and con- sternation. He himself was arrested, cruelly tortured for the discovery of accomplices, of whom he had none, and lastly beheaded. A certain contempt of scholastic acquirements seemed the prevailing tone at Bern; and school education naturally came to deseiwe the low esteem whi(m it met with. Accordingly those patrician youths who did not serve in the army remained for the most part unemployed until they obtained places ui^er government. The establishment of what was called the exterior state afforded but a superficial substitute for more solid attainments, and initiated youth only too early in the petty intrigues and jealousies of faction, ihis institution, which was also known by the name of the '\"shadow state,” was intended to give the youth of the ruling families opportunities for acquaint- ing themselves with the forms at least of public business, and of acquiring an imembarras^d address, so important for republicans. It parodised the dignities and offices of the state, the election of avoyers, councillors, and senators, had its secretanes and functionaries of all ranks, and distributed by lot 120 vogtships, which for the most part took their names from ruined castles. Without any sufficient evidence, some would refer to the era of the THE 18 TH CENTURY 11 <1 ' . 5 war the origin of this institution, which received tlie sah'c^^n' ' of gOTcrnment in 1687, and for which a council-house, far than that which belonged to the actual government, was built in 17^.1. ^rof Uir'‘exS state” bore an ape astride on a lobster, and looking.

With regard to intellectual cultivation, ^'*1^ dictory features were observable at Lucerne. On the one hand, kaiinng, ^Ithtenment, and patriotism were hereditary distinctipiis of sonic fainihra; whire on the other hand, the mass was imbuecl with ignorant jiinaticisni. On tlie one hand, the encroachments of the papacy were rcHi.sted with udh'xi- ble firmness: while, on the other hand, the clergy kept posse.ssion of a highly mischievous influence in the state.

The whole population was plunged in conHteruatiou anti aHtonish- ment by thundering sermons and rigorous prohibitions of llit^ obnoxiqUH work. Free-thinkers were fulminated against by name from the pulpits; and Schinznach, which had witnessed the formation of th(‘ llt‘lveiic soendy, was denounced as the focus and headtiuarters of heresy. This society, which aimed at the dhTusiou of useful knowledge, public spirit, and union throughout the Helvetic body, without ndt'nmct* to vari^tiies of religion, rank, or political system, was fountletl by a knot of patriotht and instructed men, in the pious liop(‘, of arresting the d(‘cliue of^ the con- federation.

The aristo-dcmocratical governments lu^xt c.ome under our notice, and 12 THE HISTOEY OF SWITZEEMND i 1780 .IJ) i in these, as in most of the purely aristocratical, the metropolis had obtained unlimited power over the whole canton. In these, however, particular families die. not engross the sovereign power; the collective body of citizens had maintained themselves by means of the regulations of their guilds in the possession of considerable influence over the ' public affairs. Accordingly the magistracy favoured the monopolies which enriched the metropolitan traders, and imposed restraints on the industry and invention of the sur- rounding country. Thence the subjects of these towns were much inore harshly governed than those of the aristocratical cantons. Their ancient charters fell into oblivion, and were withdrawn as far as possible from public inspection; they were not only excluded from civil and military, but even from ecclesiastical functions; and the exercise of many br^tnehes of industry, and the sale of their productions in the towns, was wholly cut off by corpora- tion privileges. Moreover, since the commencement of the century of which we are treating, no mode of acquiring the rights of burghers remained open ; they were only conferred on extremely rare occasions to reward emixient merit; or when the times became troublesome to conciliate influential bur- ghers. Hence that discontent and disaffection which broke out at the ylose of the century found a principal focus in the heart of the mixed aristocracies. In the larger cantons the public administration was for the most part incorrupt; and that of justice was liable on the whole to fewer complaints than in many other European countries. The pay of public servants, with fe-w exceptions, was extremely moderate. Men who had devoted their whole lives to public affairs, and who had filled the highest offices in the state, lost more than they gained by the bounty of their country. At Zurich, the expenses of the government were wholly defrayed without the imposition of taxes, properly so called, from the revenues and interests of the national lands and capital, from ground-rents, tithes, the salt monopoly, and the produce of the premium paid by the several guilds of traders in return for their exclusive privileges. The same description is applicable to the govern- ment of Bern, excepting that here the course of jastice was tedious and expen- sive. The superior financial resources of the latter canton enabled hortto execute more for public ends than Zurich. Bern invested considerable sums in foreign securities, particularly in the English funds; and, besides, amassed a treasure amounting to some millions of dollars, which became, as we shall ]^resently see, and as Mably had predicted, the booty of rapacious and power- j:ul neighbours. Very different was the condition of the free or common bailiwicks, par- ticularly those of the democratical cantons; here most of the land-vogta sought by every species of extortion to indemnify themselves for the sums for which they had in fact bought their places from the general assemblies of their respective cantons. Many made an open traffic of justice; took presents from both parties; helped delinquents to evade deserved punish- ment who could pay for exemption, and exacted contributions from the wealthier class whenever and wherever they could. Even farther than in the German domains of Switzerland were abuses of this kind carried in the Italian bailiwicks, and most of all in those of the Orisons. The inevitable tendency of such treatment was to debase the popular character in thpse districts, and its effects have left unequivocal traces even to this day. In those towns of which the constitution was grounded on corporate bodies, the privileges of the burghers and their guilds received progressive extensions. Propositions were made which would hardly have been con- ceivable in monarchical states, and could only, in fact, take place where THE 18 TH CENTURY 19 [1780 A.D.) particular classes had to decide upon the destiny of tlie rest of their f(?l low- countrymen. In BAle it was several times propos(jd, muler tlie prtflex.t of protection to agriculture^ that the exercise of certain manufacturcH should pe prohibited a\\together in the rural part of the canton.^^ FEDERAL BEL ATION8 OF THE SWISS BTATKB The federal bond which united the various cantons and tlaur allies was very loose, and far different from that which fastencHl together t/hc* united provihees of Holland, or even from the federal compact of the United of North America. There was not in Switzerland any permanent sovtTeigii body, no standing federal magistrate equally acknowledged by all, no cen- tral government having its own establishment, its own treasury, its own servants, civil and military. The general diets could not d(H*idc upon any important question, unless it had been previously d(‘bat(H! and d(‘(‘ided oh in the\" councils of each of the cantons, who were applied to by thtar own deputies for fresh instructions at every new case which w/is brought, before^ the diet. The cantons were not even each allied to all TIk* (ughi older cantons had arnong them a federal compact for their common defence, am I even of these eight the first five only, viz. Zurich, Schwyz, Uri, Untcrwaldc^ii, and Lucerne, were bound to enter into no other alliance without each oilKa‘’« coni^ent; while the other three, Glarus, Zug, and Bern, W(‘re at lila^rty to form alliances with other states or foreign prince's, prcwidcnl sucdi allianex'ii contained nothing prejudicial to the federal liond. The eight (cantons wer«' also bound, by the convention of Stanz, to assist one another in supporting the form of government established in each of them. The five junior cantons, viz, Fribourg, Solotlmrn, Bliley SchafThaus(a), and Appenzell, had no federal bond with the whole of tlu^ rc'st, nor among themselves, but every one of them was allied to Hotm one or mor<'. of the others. The three forest cantons alone were allied to imwy one of th<j other cantons. By these means, however, the guiirantec^ of common defenc'e was secured to each ; for, as any canton attacked had the right of calling some other cantons to its assistance, and as these were entitled to cuill oiht'rH, all would be brought in to take a part, in virtue of tlnur partkmlar bomls. The general diets of the confederation were oitlier ordinary or extra- ordinary. pe ordinary diets met once a year at h'rammh'ld in llmrgau, instead of Baden, where, until the i,reaty of Aarau in 1712 , thew had hmi from Zurich presidc'd: he brouglit for- w^ard the matters to be discussed, collc^cted the votes, framed thf' reHolutions, etc. men canton associate had one vote and cpK'stions mm dcM-ick'd by a simple majority.

I he foreign muuster, at whose n'cpK'st an (cttraordi- 14 THE HISTORY OE SWITZERLAND [1780 A.B.] nary diet was convoked, was bound to pay the expenses of the deputies who were thus called from their homes at an unexpected seas®n. The partial diets were held by the Protestant cantons at Aarau, and by the Catholic ones at Lucerne. There was no fixed time for their meeting, but they were summoned as the occasion required it. A regulation, called the ^'defensionale/' was, as we have seen, agreed ' upon at a general diet held at Baden in 1668, for^providing^against sudden emergencies, such as an attack from foreign powers, when the proceedings of the diet would have proved too slow for the common safety. In such a case deputies were to be named by all the members of the Helvetic body, and inyested with full powers to direct the military force of the nlition, Vhich was to be raised by contingents from the militia of each state. This body consisted of 9600 men for the thirteen cantons, 1400 for fhe associates, and 2400 for the subject bailiwicks — in all 13,400 men; which number, however, might be doubled and trebled if required. The militia of each canton consisted of all the males from sixteen tg sixty years of age, and these received military instruction at certain periods. Only one-third of the whole, however, consisting of the youngest and strongest, ivere enrolled into regiments, the other two-thirds supplying them with recruits if necessary. The regiments were divided into fusileers and electionaries, the fusileers being all young unmarried men, who were considered as always ready to march at a moment’s notice; the electionaries were composed of the mar- ried men, of an age and size proper for service, and these were called out after the fusileers. When in active service they received regular pay; but every man was boimd to provide his own uniform, arms, and accoutrements. The Swiss, it is well known, furnished troops to several European powers, according to certain treaties or capitulations, as th^ were called, agreed upon between those powers and the various cantons. The chief power having Swiss troops in its service was France, who had retained them ever since the treaty made between the Swiss and Louis XI. Under Louis XIV the number of Swiss troops in the French service amounted to 28,000 men; but, in 1790, at the beginning of the French Revolution, there were not more than 15,00.0, who were divided into twelve regiments. Six Swiss regiments were in the service of Holland, four were serving in Piedmont, four at Naoles, and four in Spain: the pope had also a small body guard of Swiss. Tiere has been considerable misconception abroad upon this subject; the cantons have been represented as selling their countrymen as if they were cattle, while the truth is that the men were not sold, but enlisted of their own accord for a certain period of time, receiving the bounty money ^ Agriculture was advanced by the cultivation of clover and of other arti- ficial gr^ses, and by the consequent increase of pasturage and manure. Many districts which had formerly been regarded as unfruitful were thus rendered remarkable for fertility. The processes of manuring, and many other processes in Swiss cultivation, became a model for foreign agricul- turists. Arts and manufactures were extended more and more widely. In the canton of Bern, in the Thurgau, and elsewhere, industry was employed on native inaterials in the linen manufacture; in Zurich, St. Gall, and Appen- zell, m working up imported wool in spinning, weaving, and cotton printing. •1 occupied Zurich and Bile, and the latter town enriched it^lf by its riband manufacture. Trade in all its branches throve at Geneva, where a wholesale watch manufacture was conducted, and from whence watchmaking was soon spread through the district of Neuchitel, where it suggested many other mechanical processes. THE IBTH CENTtTRY u [1780 A.b.J Intellectual culture and social refinements inarclxed abreast with com- mercial wealth. Not only the towns were embelliHluHl with architectural structures, but in the Emmenthal, and around the lak<^H of !Z.urich ami (huuwa, arose new and splendid edifices which bespoke incr(^asin|^; opuk^mv*. In Neuch^tel, which a century before had been inhabited by Hlu^plu^nlK, the villages assumed the appearance of towns; and the wealthy marts of l'kig« land or the Netherlands were recalled to the mind of the travider by the principal street of Winterthur. Intercourse with other states in tnule or m foreign services naturalised new wants and desires, yet niany still adhered to the old usages and manners. In whole districts, esrxudaUy in tlu^ denno- cratic cantont*, public opinion imperiously set limits to tlie advance of luxury. In other places sumptuary laws maintained a struggle with the various arts of invention; and a wholesome state of simplicity wfis preserved in Zurich, St. Gall, and BMe, in which celibacy became a rarity Although in political matters dissensions prevailed, yet in intellectual ami scientific life a sense of the unity of the fatherland was beginning to arista notably in the reformed towns, where intellectual life had made great ntrides since the success of the war of Toggenburg. Men began to ntudy their own position, learned to know the individuality of Switwuiiind, am! drew thence the hope of a brighter future. The pioneers of tins movement, Scheuchzer of Zurich and Haller of Bern. J. J. Bcheuchzer (l072-!7db), physician and naturalist, made himself famous by various journey.s into the t^wiss Alps, wrote the first natural history of Switzerland, and aho c(iin- pleted a large map of Switzerland, by whiesh labours he put new life into patriotism. ^brecht von Haller fob, 1777), the great poet and natural ist, hj unrivalled industry acciuired an extensive and kuirncd (‘ducalion; !u^ also possessed a strong poetic vein, and a warm and patriotic heurrt. Among lis poems which appeared in 1732, Die Alpen f'Phe Alps) made a gn-at impres* Sion by its poetic depth and the novelty of its ideas. Full of imlignalion at the depravity of the time, and yearning for natural and unspoiled con- ditions, he there depicts with vigorous touches thcj life of natims and of men in the Alps, the simple, beautiful customs of the Alpine folk, witli a patriotic warmth and enthusiasm before unknown.

On the whole, the century was not worse than those which had preceded it. Even if the forms of government favoured many abuses, a more extended spirit of activity prevailed amongst the people than in previous generations; and though it is true that no extraordinarily great actions were performed, ' it is also true that no great occasion called for their performcjice. It cannot be denied that too much jealousy prevailed between the cantons, and that more reli- ance was often placed on strangers than on fellow confederates. But Germany, which united might have given law to Europe, had been even more distracted by like errors, reduced to a mere battle-field for foreigners, and robbed of its most valu- able dependencies.® Seldom during the eighteenth century did the confederates act together. Only once did the confederation appear as a unit toward the outside. That was in 1777, when an alliance was concluded with France which well expressed the subservi- ency of the Swiss at this period to that country. The members of the diet con- vened at Solothurn went through a hu- miliating ceremony. They appeared in a body at the ambassador's hotel, followed him to church and thence to the place of the deliberations. By this treaty the Hel- vetic body was bound to render a levy of six thousand men to France in case her ter- ritory was invaded, and in return the king of France promised the Swiss help in danger and to maintain the privileges accorded them by his predecessors J. C. Lavatejr (im- 1801 ) SWITZERLAND PEELS THE SHOCK OP THE FRENCH REVOLUTION The Swiss government, as well as that large portion of their subjects who were contented with their condition, and d.esired no alteration in it, were startled out of a state of perfect tranquillity by the first shock of the French revolution. The shiftine of the whole political scenery of Europe surrounded them with entirely new embarrassments. They resembled st^rsmen toler- ably capable of guiding their bark safely through the tempests of their native lakes, but who found themselves now on unknown seas without chart or compass. The situation of the Swiss regiments engaged in the French ser- vice afforded the first reason for disquietude; the next was the apprehension of infection from the principles predominant in France,^ Alarming political movements soon began in the interior; and the solution of the problems which were set before Swiss politicians by the progress of events in tlae neigh- bouring countries was the more difficult the more various were the views, wants, and relations of the cantons, and the lands which were subject to them. It was in the latter districts, as might have been expected, that the new ideas gained the greatest currency, and that the first attempts were made for THE imi CENTUliY 17 [1780-1704 their refilisation. Educated and thinking men in the nubject townB and terri- tories brooded resen tfrally on their exclusion from all public posts and dig- nities. In those cantons where trade and manufactures were most cultivat^^ch it was regarded m an intoleralj^le hardship by the enterprising and wealthy rural propietor, that lie was hindered by oppressive regulations from pur- chasing tne requisite raw materials, or from disposing of the products of his industry in any\\iuarter exoept to a wholesale dealer of tlia eapitol Similar resentments were excited by corporate privileges. Neverthelemi, in the Ger- man regions of Switzerlancf, a longer time elapsed before the new modes of thinking, and ^he comparisons which they suggested, set the public mind in motion. “This took place much sooner in the west, where the French language and neighbourhood made communication easier; above all, in Geneva, where nothing Dut an auspicious hour was waited for to burst asunder a yoke irnponed by foreigners. A rise in the price of bread, which was imputed to the government, gave occasion (or the long-prepared explosion. On the 26th of February, 1781), the 1 1 (*111 ^ it # j 1 ii* 111 1%^, trust and exasperation received continual new aliment, and tlie dism teres ted If ■ ^ -Jl ^ _ Jt ...Ill 11 t ^ ^ ^ IrJlitWzSIl were gamed to a proposed new constitution, by the hope of eecairing order and repose; and in the beginning of 1794 it was adopted by a large majority, In April, syndics and council were again installed in their former functions, and the event was announced to Zurich and Bern with expressions of hope and confidence.

Of eight of the prisoners first examined, a revolutionary tribunal contented itself with sentencing one to death; but the clamour and threats of the multitude worked on these unsteady judges to retract their verdict, and extend the same condemnation to all the others^. The doom of four of these was commuted for banishment by the general assembly; but a band of wretches again collected, stormed the pris- ons, and the bloody tribunal now sentenced their victims to be shot; and afterwards endeavoured to excuse itself on the plea that this had only been done to prevent worse atrocities. More executions followed, which included several persons who had actively promoted revolution. Nurhbers i;» ere ban- ished, in order to secure the ruling party a majority in^the general assembly. The large sums required by a revo!.utionary government for the j^ayinent of public officers, and the arihed force of the pojpulace, were defrayed by impos- ing heavy contributions on the possessors of property; indifferentists being made to pay double, aristocrats a treble amount. Party spirit, however, cooled by degrees; apiproximations and concessions took place between all classes of citizens, who felt, in common, the, general ruin of public and private happiness; and the disappointment of all the hopes which had formerly found indulgence. In 1796, a return to the old constitution was agreed upon, on condition of equality of rights being con- ceded to the old and new burghers, and the town ana country inhabitants. The exiles returned home, and all rejoiced that they could again breathe freely. For two years more, the little republic dragged on an infirm exist- ence; till it was finally united with France in 1798, and forced to partake, for fifteen years, the destinies of that country. Of the men who had at different times been banished for political offences from Switzerland, many had taken refuge in the French metropolis, and endeavoured to persuade the republican statesmen that their enemies were equally those of France. [Notable among them was La Harpe of Vaud, who published a treatise on the situation of the Pays de Vaud and demanded its restoration from Bern.] Their representations found the easier audience, as Switzerland was ahead y regarded with greedy eyes by their hearers. '' At an early period of the Revolution,” observes an English writer,^ ^'the views of France were directed towards Switzerland, as well from its importance as a barrier on her eastern frontier, as from its central position between the German Empire and Italy. The reduction, therefore, of Switzerland, was a favourite object of the republican rulers, and was only susjDended by the dread of adding its people to the host of enemies who menaced France on all sides; they accordingly temjporised under the mask of friendship, and suc- ceeded in preserving the neutrality of the Helvetic confederacy, by fomenting the national antipathy to the house of Austria. Yet even during this spe- cious display of friendship, their agents industriously spread disaffection, and prepared the mine which was ready to explode on the first favourable oppor- tunity: such an opportunity presented itself at the conclusion of the treaty of Cainpo Formio, which left the Swiss without an ally on the Continent, At this period the French RejDublic had acquired a colossal strength. The king of Sardinia, deprived of lialf his territory, was the vassal of France; the ]3ope, and the king of Naples, owed the possession of a precarious sceptre to i:he forbearance of the directory; Prussia pertinaciously maintained her close connection with the new republic; and Austria, vanquished by the genius of Bonaparte, had concluded a dishonourable peace. But the French rulers were not content with planting the tricoloured THE ISTH CENTUKl\" 10 [1T!)6 A.D ] flag on the summit of Mont Blanc, on the left bank of the Rhine, and at the mouth of the Scheldt, and with establishing the limits of their empire by the natural boundaries of the Pyrenees, the Alps, the Mediterranean and the ocean. With a view to secure their territories against the future aggressions of the continental powers, they purposed to forma series of dependent repub- lics along the line of their frontiers, as a kind of outwork, to remove the point of attack. At the extremities of this line they had already catablishou the Ligurifin and Batavian republics j the Cisalpine soon followed. A connect- ing link of this chain Was Switzerland, winch covered the most vulnerable parts of the French territory; and, from its natural strength and central position, formed the citadel of Europe.” , , ^ . Besides these motives, acknowledged by the hrench themselves, their rapacity was stimulated by the treasures known to exist at Bern and else- where, the amount of which, as usual, was enormously exaggerated. What was required, in short, was not a motive but a pretext for intermeddling with the internal regulations of the Helvetic bot.y. That body had with the utmost caution avoided giving offence; had recognised every successive form of government in France; and had turned out of their territories the unfor- tunate French dmigrds who had fled thither for refuge from tlie rage of their own countrymen. The triumphs of Napoleon in Italy were concluded by tlie construction of the Cisalpine Republic. The Swiss subjects of the Valteliue, Cliiuvenna, and Bermio, were tempted to desire participation in the freedom thus entab • lished on their borders; and Napoleon offered the Orisons the alternatives of conceding equal rights to these districts, or of seeing tliein includetl in the new Cisalpine state. Parties ran so high on this proposal, that no friemlly understanding was possible; and when the tenn allowoil for reply elaps(Hl without any being given, Napoleon put his threat into effect, and confiscadeil all property belonging to the Orisons contained in the above-montioiUMl dis - tricts. Such was the first encroachment on the ancient limits of Switzerland: shortly afterwards the bisho]3ric of Bdle was annexed to France. Onait con- sternation was caused by tnese proceedings in the confederation; but still more serious evils were at hand. In the canton of Bitle the pciusantry mur- mured loudly against the town: in the Aargau several towns advanced tumul- tuous claims against Bern, for the recovery of their old and chartered riglits; and the Pays de Vaud reclaimed its freedom with more impatience than ever. It was said besides, that a French army was already mandiing on Switzerland; ostensibly to support the claims of the malcontents, but really to make themselves masters of the land for their own puroosea. Bern and Fribourg hastily levied forces for the coercion of their turoulent dependen ■ cies; and a diet of the confederacy was summoned at Aaraii. Much was said and nothing done at this meeting, as the cantonal governments neither trusted each other nor their subjects. The members of the diet renewed the original league of the cantons, as if urged by the presentiment of its com- ing dissolution. The oath had hardly been taken, when a messenger froni BSe brought the intelligence that the mansions of the land-vogta were in flames; that a lai^e body of peasantry had entered the town, and tbit all the subject districts had declared themselves free. The spectacle of feebleness and fear in the authorities combined witli dogged resistance to the wishes of the people, of course diffused, iiiatearl of auelling, the spirit of revolt. As in the thirteenth and succeeding century, the prerogatives of the nobles had been forced to yield to th© claims of a class 20 THE HISTORY OF SWITZERLAE^B [IT97-1T98 of burghers and of shepherds so soon as the example of the Lombard towns, and the growth of public prosperity, had excited independence of feeling; so likewise, in the times of which we are treating, it had ceased to be within the power of a privileged class to contend with success against the claims of the so-called third order, encouraged as it was by the example of France. Some districts, indeed, took no part in the prevalent agitations, and pertinacipusiy adhered to the accustomed order of things; others, more distinguished for enlightenment and enterprise, demanded an equality of rights in town and country; others, again, required the restoration of ancient franchises: some regarded nothing as attainable but by French interference; while nobler minds retained an insurmountable abhorrence for the agency of strangers in the internal affairs of their country. It became more and more evident that the poliev of the French directory led them to foment intestine discord in Switzerland. For several years past it had been observed that foreign emissaries set themselves to work upon the public opinion. A person of the name of Mengaud made his appearance at B41e, under the unusual and equivocal title of commissary, ana set /bis seal on the papers of the French embassy: this individual not only madd no secret of his intelligence with the malcontents in Switzerland, but affected to display it ostentatiously. He went to Bern on the 10th of October, 1797, where he demanded, in a note addressed to the government, the dismissal of the English ambassador Wickham, who had certainly exerted himself openly against France, but had done so as the envoy of a power at war w^'th that country. Bern referred the demand of Mengaud to the then directing can- ton, as a matter which concerned the whole confederacy. Wickham relieved for the moment the embarrassment of the Helvetic body, while he deprived the French directory of a present pretence for violence, by taking his departure on a tour into Germany; but he left an able (^'iplomatist behind him in the person of his secretary Talbot. Mengaud was received at Zurich and Bern with undis^ised aversion, and no diplomatic 'Visits were paid him at either of these places. In the month of November, an embassy :;roin the latter town had b^n sent to Paris; which, though admitted fo an audience of the director Barras, soon received a rude dismissal homewards. Great were the hopes infu^a into the disaffected party by th^ jpromises of Mengaud, and other subordinate agents of France; and propdniional fears were excited amongst the friends of the old system, including the greater number of public functionaries. In order to increase their uneasiness, Men- gaud threatened the diet of the confederation in January, 1798, with tlxe entrance of French troops into Switzerland, should Austria be suffered to occu]3y the Grisons. He travelled to the place of meeting at Aarau, with tricoloured flags flying from his carriage; and, on his arrival there, hung out an immense banner in front of his house. The triumphant revolutionists of BMe had already formed a tricoloured -flag of their own, by the addition of green to their formal cantonal colours, black and white, and their delegate at Paris, Ochs, had hastily sketched what he called an Helvetic constitution, on the model of that of the French Republic. This document was printea in Italian, French, and German, and distributed by Mengaud, not in official quarters only, but throughout the whole population of the cantons, FEENCH TROOPS IN SWITZERLAND In the mean time, a division of the French army, under Menard, aopeared on the western frontier; and the Pays de Vaud, protected by it, dec axed its THE 18TH CENTURY [1798 independence of Bern. The Bernese government saw the necessity of trying the force of arms on its subjects; and the command of the forces haying been declined by councillor Erlach of Spiez, who had hitherto been one of the strongest assertors of aristocracy, it was conferred on Colonel Rudolf Weiss, who had, till then, sustained the character of a champion of the opposii.e system; and had contributed, by a published work, (7 to the favourable tem- per of the partisans of Robespierre towards the Swiss confederation. An . unusual delegation of full powers placed in his hands the whole military gov- ernment of the Vaud. The new commander held conferences with the lead- ers of the malcontents; published a treatise ^ intended to conciliate them, but intermixed conciliation with menace. Chillon was recovered by surpriHC from the insurgents, ?^nd the German troops of Bern were moved on the fron- tiers of the Vaud. Meanwhile, General Menard was already on the lake of Geneva, with ten thousand men of the conquering anny of Italy; and to him the insurgent leaders, alarmed for their own safety, addressed themselves. Menard replied, that he was instructed to give them aid and protection; and threatened Colonel*Weiss that he would repel force with force, if the former should per- sist in drawing troops around a territory already declared independent, and ip arming the communes against each other. Without taking any measures of defence — without even attempting to maintain himself on the high grounds — Weiss withdrew to the neiglibourhood of Yverdun. It happened, accidentally, that two French hussars were shot on the outposts of the Bernese army, because they had not immediately answered the cliallenge of the sen- tinels. This incident was taken up by Menard, and afterwards by the direc* tory, as an infringement of the law of nations, and the commencement of hostilities. The revolution of Bdle, and the entrance of French troops into the Fays de Vaud, rendered it impossible for reflecting men any longer to doubt that sweeping social changes were inevitable. Yet the Swiss democracies wouhl not be persuaded that anyone could shake their constitutions, or forcie on them n new species of freedom. The numerous friends of things as they were still hoped to steer themselves through the crisis without any great sacrifices, by mere dint of tenacity and delay. Many, moreover, flattered themselves with the notion that the plans of France were levelled at no wider mark than the Vaud; and were prompted by a petty feeling of jealousy towards Bern [the stronghold of the aristocracy], to see nothing in the affair but a morti- fication to that envied canton. It could hardly be conceived at Bern, that the French should have advanced without meeting any resistance up to Yverdun, while the head- c uarters of Colonel Weiss were withdrawn behind Avencho. He Wim instantly cismissed from his command, which was transferred to General Erlach of Hmdelbank; but the evil effects of exorbitant discretionary powers hiwi b^n so sensibly felt, that the opposite extreme was now adopted. Mean- while the leading statesmen of Bern had, at length, become convinced that concessions must be made to the people. Fifty-two members were added to the great council from amongst the burghers, citizens of the minor towns, and _ ^ , 1 . . edi 0 mtrodiice, v/'ithiin a year’s time, a new conatitution; m which admission to every public function should bo open to all, Md d^ proportion should be observed in the emoluments of all public wrvices. These resolutions were laid before the directory, together with a demand for the withdrawal of the French troops. The government also stooped to make a like communication to Mengaud, to acquaint him with 22 THE HISTORY OF SWITZERLAND [im A.».] the actual political system of Bern, and inform him of the wish of that canton to preserve peace with France. Mengaud made ,‘ust such an answer as ought to nave been expected from him. He demanc.ed a prompt and complete change of the old! political system, declared that further de!.ays could not be suffered by the majesty of the French Republic; and designated the perse- vering defenders of the existing order as a handful of inveterate tyrants. Disregarding their own positive engagemente, the French, on the 8th ^ February, took possession of the town of Bienne. Yet the confederates still hoped to conciliate France, and were encouraged in this illusion by General Brune, who now commanded the French troops, reinforced by several thou- sand men, and fi.xed his headquarters at Payeme. This subtle leader, who, without having experienced a lengthened public career, to borrow a diplo- matic expression, row nu dans les affaires, proposed, with artful blandish- ments, and with hinted, hopes of peaceful adjustment, an armistice of fourteen days; during which the discipline and enthusiasm of the Bernese army had time to abate, indecision anci distrust to increase, and recruits to join the French amiy. Meanwhile General Schauenburg had collected a division of trcops on the frontiers of Solothum and Bern, equal in strength to that of Brune. The latter announced, on the 26th of Februa^, that he had received full power^ to treat from the executive directory. He proposed his ultimatum to the Swiss delegates, that without farther delay they should introduce a provi- sional government, take measures for the establishment of a new constitu- tion, with securities for freedom and equality, liberate all prisoners for political offences, and withdraw their own troops, as well as those of the other can- tons. On the due fulfilment of these conditions, the French troops should be drawn off likewise; and should not again enter the Swiss territory, unless the government called for their assistance. On the very day w^hen Brune had given his insolent ultimatum, Erlach entered the great council at Bern, accompanied by eighty of his officers, .who were membera, like himself, of that body. In a moment of unusual resolu- tion, he was invested with full powers to commence hostilities on the cl*se of the armistice. However, two days afterwards, the delegates returned from Brune’s encampment at Payeme. Erlach and his brothers in arms were no longer present in council; the rest of that body were paralysed by the immi- nent and gigantic danger; and the full powers which !aad just been given the general were taken away. The same evening, Erlach received instructions not to attack the French, which fired his troops with anger and suspicion, and tended to confirm the belief in the treachery of their leaders, already widely prevalent in the army. Bmne’s ultimatum, in all its principal features, was accept^. The delegates of Zurich, Wyss, and Tscharner sought a conference with him, when he renewed his former offers in cold and peremptory lan- guage; but now added a novel stipulation to them, namely, that, even after the confederate troops were disbanded, his should remain till the new con- stitution should be established. It w^as affirmed, truly or otherwise, that he granted, without difficulty, an extension of the truce for twenty-four hours; notwithstanding which, the delegates, on their return, saw his troops already in motion for the attack. Orders for the commencement of hostilities had also been forwamed from the council of war at Bern to the army, and two hours afterwards retracted. In o^dience to the first of these contradictory instructions, the Bernese colonel Gross had given notice to the French outposts that the truce would come to an end at ten in the evening of the 1st of March; but when he with- THE 18TH CBNTUEY [1798 X.D.] drew his former announcement on the arrival of counter-orders* Schauenburg would admit no further parley. He had already attacked, without warning, the old castle of Dornach, in the neighbourhood of Bdle, which sustained a siege of twenty-four hours. The attack of a Bernese division near Vingels was rejDulsed with 'loss, and the French surprised the Bernese posts at Leng- nau, which they carried after an obstinate resistance. The town of Solothurn capitulated, on Schauenburg’s appearance before it. The passage across the Aar now lay o|Den to the Frencii troops. Fribourg was attacked and taken, tho^h a stand was made by the Bernese garrison. Erlach was now compelled to withdraw his troops behind the Aar and the Sense; ishough'it was not without extreme reluctance that the men of Bern abanaoned Morat. On the 3rd of March, Brune destroyed one of the finest monuments of Swis^ courage and union, the Ossuary of Morat; and the French, among whom were many natives of Burgundy, honoured the bones of their ancestors with a grave, after an interval of more than three hundred years. Now at length, Bern, Solothurn, and Fribourg proclaimed a levy en masse of ^he able-bodied men within their territories. Tlie Bernese amay was in a dreadful state of confusion; particularly that division which stood directly oppos^ to Brune, in which the distrust and exas peration of the soldiers were at their highest pitch. Officers were dismissed by their soldiers, and othere Jut in their place. Colonels Stettler and Eyhiner were bayoneted and shot before the very gates of Bern; and Colonels Crusez and Goumoens fell beneath the sahre-atrokes of their own dragoons. Nevertheless, the troops were teain / assembled under command of Grafenried, who was admirably support, by his officers, and repulsed the French in every attempt to charge them at the ]Doint of the bayonet. Eighteen cannons were taken from tlie enemyi s.rid their loss in men besides was very considerable. The Capitulation of Bern ; the Constitution Vnilaire (1798 The native troops had now fully recovered spirit and confidence; but just as Grafenried prepared to cross the Sense at Neueneck, the decisive intelligence arrived that liern was in the hands of the enemy 1 Early on the 6ta, an attack had been made by Schauenburg on Solotnurn. His force was far numerically superior to the Bernese; his horse artillery terrified the native militia by its novelty, and his cavalry was nearly eight-fold that of Beni in numbers. At Fraubrunnen, the French turned the left flank of t/he Bernese: in the Grauholz and at Breitenfeld their militia under Erlach offered a brave resistance, armed with scythes and other agricultural implements. Men, women, and even children mixed, and fell in the mortal struggle. On its unsuccessful issue ensued the capitulation of Bern. All was lost: the armed bands of the peasantry dispersed in every direc- tion with loud accusations of treason against their officers, many of whom were slain by their own men. Amongst these was the general Erlach, an illustrious name in the annals of Bern. That unfortunate commander, and the avoyer Steiger, when the fortune of the day was decided, retreated towards the Oberland, whither they knew that arms and money had already been despatched by the government, and where they still ho^ed to offer an effec- tive resistance. But Erlach was murdered on the way by the enraged fugi- tives, who breathed nothing but revenge for their imaginary betrayal; and It was only by chance that Steiger did not meet a similar fate. Even public extremity could not restore public spirit. Every little canton treated, armed, and cared for itself exclusively, totally regardless of the rest. 24 THE HISTORY OF SWITZERLAND [1798 A.B.] Wherever the authorities had, till then, withheld freedom from their subjects, they no longer delayed to grant it; but bestowed emancipation with so ill a grace as to indicate how gladly they would have refused it had they dared.
