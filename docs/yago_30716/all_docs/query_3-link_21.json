        "text": "Commemorated on December 16\n\nSaint Sophia (in the world Great Princess Solomonia Yurievna) was born around 1490, the daughter of the noble Yuri Saburov. Her mother died when she was young, and she was raised by her aunt Eudokia (her father's sister). In the year 1505 she was chosen as the bride of the heir to the throne, the future Great Prince Basil III. She was selected from among 500 girls from all over the country, who were presented at court for this purpose.\n\nThe wedding of Prince Basil and Solomonia took place on September 4, 1505, in the presence of the groom's father, Ivan III. Metropolitan Simon blessed the couple at the Dormition Cathedral in the Moscow Kremlin. When she married Basil, her father was raised to the rank of boyar. For the first time in Moscow's history, a Great Prince took neither a foreign princess nor a Russian princess as his wife, but a bride who came from a boyar family.\n\nAfter twenty years, it became apparent that Solomonia was unable to conceive a child. Basil understood perfectly that if he died childless his brothers would inherit the throne. In order to preclude that possibility, they were imprisoned or forbidden to marry until his own son was born. In the end, this led to the extinction of the Rurikid dynasty, and to the succession crisis known as the Time of Troubles.\n\nDespite her radiant beauty, exemplary morals, and mild character, Solomonia's failure to produce an heir must have weighed upon Basil's relations with his wife, who turned to foreign doctors for help. In 1525, the Great Prince decided to divorce Solomonia, with the approval of Metropolitan Daniel and the boyars, although other Church authorities declared the divorce was unlawful.\n\nIn order to obtain an heir, Great Prince Basil decided to marry Elena Glinska, the daughter of the Lithuanian prince Basil Glinsky. This action of the Great Prince Basil was condemned by all the Patriarchs, and Patriarch Mark of Jerusalem even predicted that of this second marriage a \"cruel child\" would be born, who would fill Russia with blood and horrors. Ivan the Terrible was born in 1530, and Basil's second son, Yuri, was feeble-minded. All the best Russian people of that time stood up for the blameless and miserable Great Princess: i.e. Metropolitan Barlaam, Saint Maximos the Greek (January 21) and others. But all their protests were in vain. For the first time in Russian history, a Great Prince removed a Metropolitan from office and imprisoned him in a monastery. Saint Maximos was not allowed to serve, and others were persecuted as well. Prince Andrew Kurbsky called Princess Solomonia \"innocent and holy.\"\n\nOn November 25, 1525 Basil ordered Solomonia to become a nun. Forcibly tonsured with the name Sophia, she was sent under guard to the Nativity Monastery in Moscow. Later, she was moved to the Protection Monastery in Suzdal, one of the many churches established by Basil and his wife, where prayers were offered for the birth of an heir.\n\nThrough her ascetical struggles, Saint Sophia banished all worldly thoughts from her heart, and dedicated herself entirely to God. She reposed on December 18, 1542, after living as a nun for seventeen years.\n\nRumors concerning Sophia's holiness quickly spread throughout Russia. In a letter to Tsar Ivan, Prince Andrew Kurbsky calls the Right-believing Princess “a Monastic Martyr.” In a manuscript of the Lives of the Saints she is called “Holy Venerable Princess Sophia the Nun, the Wonderworker, who dwelt in the Protection Monastery.” In the reign of Tsar Theodore (the son of Ivan the Terrible) she was revered as a Saint. Tsaritsa Irene sent to Suzdal, “to the Great Princess Solomonia, also called Sophia, a velvet veil depicting the Savior and other Saints.” Patriarch Joseph wrote to Archbishop Serapion of Suzdal instructing him to have Panikhidas and Molebens served for the Nun Sophia.\n\nThe sacristan Ananias of Suzdal speaks of several miraculous cures at her grave. In 1609, during an invasion by the Poles, she saved Suzdal from destruction, appearing in a frightful form to the Polish military commander Lisovsky. Paralyzed with fear, he swore to spare the city and monastery. In 1610 a peasant woman named Theodosia was healed after being afflicted with blindness for a year and a half. In 1646 a girl, Irene Popova, was healed after being paralyzed for several years. That same summer a woman named Juliana was cured of amnesia. The Nun Theodora was healed in 1647 after being blind for two and a half months. That same year Julitta Ivanova, a resident of the village of Kideksha, was healed after being deaf for two years. Febronia of Suzdal was healed of paralysis in 1648 after several years. In 1649 the Nun Alexandra (Trusov) of the Protection Monastery was healed after losing her sight. Many other miracles took place, and continue to take place, through the intercession of Saint Sophia.\n\nIn 1650, Patriarch Joseph told the Archbishop of Suzdal to permit her local veneration as a Saint. In the middle of the XVIII century, the question of her canonization arose. Her icon, painted in the XVII century, has survived to this day and is considered a wonderworking icon. Finally, with the blessing of the Holy Synod, her name was included in the Orthodox Church Calendar in 1916. In 2007, her Church-wide veneration took place, and her Service was included in the Menaion.\n\nSaint Sophia's tomb in the Protection Monastery was highly revered. On August 14, 1995, the solemn uncovering of her relics took place. On that day, a Moleben was served at her tomb. With the blessing of Metropolitan Eulogios, the Church Archaeological Commission made excavations, and the Saint's relics were found and transferred to the Protection Cathedral.\n\nSaint Sophia is also commemorated on June 23, the Synaxis of the Saints of Vladimir."
