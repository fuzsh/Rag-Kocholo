        "text": "Career\n\nOne of her relatives later became the wife of Ivan IV\"s son and heir, Ivan Ivanovich, and another lady of the Saburov-Godunov clan was Irina Feodorovna, the wife of the last Rurikid tsar, Feodor I. One other relative Boris Godunov reigned as Tsar Boris I of Russia. The wedding of Solomonia and Vasily III took place on 4 September 1505, in presence of the groom\"s father, Ivan III. Metropolitan Simon blessed the newlyweds at the Cathedral of the Dormition in the Moscow Kremlin. After twenty years, it became apparent that Solomonia was barren.\n\nIn the long term, this led to the extinction of the Rurikid dynasty and to the succession crisis known as the Time of Troubles.\n\nIn 1525, the grand prince decided to divorce Solomonia with the approval of Metropolitan Daniel and the boyars, although Vassian Patrikeyev, Maksim Grek, and some other ecclesiastical authorities declared the divorce unlawful. In November of 1525, the marriage was annulled and Solomonia was forced to take the veil under the name of Sophia at the Nativity Monastery of Moscow.\n\nSigismund von Herberstein asserts in his Notes on Muscovite Affairs that she was forcefully taken to the convent, whereas the Russian chronicles tend to underline Solomonia\"s submission to the sovereign\"s will. There were rumors that Solomonia had given birth to a child named George within the walls of the monastery.\n\nShe died in Suzdal in 1542."
