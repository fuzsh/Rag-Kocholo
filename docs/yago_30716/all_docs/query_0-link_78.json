I have carried out no original research in Russian archives for this book, but have relied entirely on published sources and historical works. Among older historians I have drawn often on N.M. Karamzin whose Istoria gosudarstva rossiikogo appeared between 1814 and 1824 – the last of the Chronicles and the first of the histories, as Pushkin put it. It is invaluable not just for the simplicity and humanity of its moral approach, but also for the richness of the sources quoted in the footnotes, some of which have now been lost. I have also made ample use of S.M. Solov’ev’s Istoria Rossii s drevneishikh vremen (1851–79), for he also quotes extensively from sources, though I do not share his reliance on the state as the motor of history. V.O. Kliuchevsky, one of the most balanced of Russian historians, does not attribute any ultimate political significance to Ivan’s oprichnina, and sees it as the ‘product of the excessively fearful imagination of the Tsar’. His conclusion that it was directed against persons and not against a system revived the conception of the moral rather than the political role of the Tsar, but though Kliuchevsky’s judgments are always valuable, he has not devoted so much of his time specifically to writing about Ivan IV. A ‘bourgeois’ historian stands out as bestriding the transition from\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage xi\n\nForeword xi anti-tsarist history to full-fledged Marxist history: S. Platonov developed the theory that Ivan set up the oprichnina in order to destroy the boyar and princely aristocracy and establish a new ruling class, the dependent military servitors, the future dvoriane, who served from the land and who would support the Tsar. It was an interpretation which made up for the deficiencies of Kliuchevsky, for it portrayed Ivan’s policy as clearly directed not at persons but at the system, and in Platonov’s view it led to a profound social, economic and political crisis, culminating in the Time of Troubles. It proved a very influential theory, and in one form or another continued in use until the fall of communism. But Platonov, one of the major historians of Russia, had not hesitated to stress the atrocities of Ivan and his moral culpability, and he succumbed to academic plotting against his position and was arrested in 1930, possibly at the instigation of the historian M.N. Pokrovsky, and exiled to Samara in miserable conditions, where he died within two years.2 While historiography floundered in ideological rapids, the Russian intelligentsia, and intellectuals in general, developed their own unprofessional, but human views of the Tsar. The Decembrist Kondratii Ryleev called him a tyrant, and Mikhail Lunin wrote of the mad Tsar who for twenty-four years bathed in the blood of his subjects. Belinsky wrote of a ‘fallen angel . . . who revealed at times both the strength of an iron character and the strength of an exalted mind’.3 Soviet historiography presented particular problems, such as the need to apply rigid Marxist criteria to the analysis of what had actually happened, without agreement having been reached on what the Marxist criteria actually were or on what had actually happened. Platonov’s rival in the transition period was Pokrovsky himself, a committed Marxist and a bolshevik, who dominated the historical scene until the mid-1930s. His Russian History from Earliest Times, was published before the Revolution. He attributed the institution of the oprichnina to the victory of the monetary economy over the feudal natural economy, leading to an alliance between the service gentry and the merchant bourgeoisie and disregarding the personal influence of Ivan IV. By 1936 (after his death) he was denounced as anti-Marxist and anti-Leninist. More important, though difficult to classify, was the work of R. Wipper, which in different versions appeared in 1922 and in 1942, when it glorified Ivan as a leader and statesman. But it would be unjust to assume that historians and for that matter playwrights or historical novelists were all cast in one ideological mould, and new interpretations of Ivan’s reign emerged into history and literature, reflecting individual judgments and the twists and turns of Soviet foreign policy and alliances.\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\nxii\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage xii\n\nIvan the Terrible\n\nVictim of these changes of direction was S.B. Veselovsky, one of the greatest scholars of mid-sixteenth century Russia, who reverted, midtwentieth century, to the position of Kliuchevsky, that the oprichnina served no political purpose, and who was therefore attacked as nonMarxist and whose work was stifled. At this point Stalin’s interest in Russian history becomes more noticeable, and it culminated in his influence on the novels of A.N. Tolstoy and the films about Aleksander Nevsky and Ivan Groznyi, of Eisenstein, the second of which was commissioned by Stalin in 1941 before the German invasion of Russia, during the period of the NaziSoviet pact.4 The treatment of the subject reflects the changing political situation, and Ivan, though a Tsar, is depicted, in Part I of Eisenstein’s film, as a wise statesman, leader of his people, opposed by treacherous boyars and supported by the common people. The trials which Eisenstein’s film of Ivan met with have been analysed in an exemplary manner by Maureen Perrie,5 and there is no point in recounting them here. However, there is one interesting feature in her account of Eisenstein’s original screenplay, the emphasis on the sea, for which there is no evidence in the sixteenth-century sources. As a boy, Ivan’s nurse sings to him the song: Ocean Sea, Sea of deepest blue Glorious sea The Russian rivers run towards you Towns stand on your shores There stand our ancient towns Captured by a dark foe . . .6 The musical theme and the song recur throughout the screen play, where Ivan’s right to the Baltic Shore is emphasized repeatedly to its strains, right to the end where Ivan carries the dying Maliuta Skuratov in his arms to the sea shore, and the waves obey his commands. This reflects Stalin’s personal commitment to the conquest of the Baltic states lost by Russia after the First World War and the Bolshevik Revolution,7 but though access to a port seems an obvious Russian political aim, there is no specific mention of it in sixteenth-century sources, other than references to the efforts to keep or recover Narva. Ivan’s atrocities are shown, up to a point, in the film (by permission: ‘“yes, murders did happen” said Stalin’8) but they are justified as necessary in view of the constant treason which surrounded the Tsar. The first part of the film\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage xiii\n\nForeword xiii was shown publicly from January 1945. The second part was shown in the Kremlin in March 1946 and met with some criticism among the intellectuals but Stalin, when he saw it, was revolted and described it as a nightmare, with the oprichnina reminding him of the Ku Klux Klan, and Ivan as a weakling, a ‘sort of Hamlet’.9 The oprichniki were ‘portrayed’ as a gang of bandits, ‘cannibals’ who called to mind the Phoenicians and the Babylonians, whereas they were a progressive force which Ivan needed to forge the unification of Russia. By now Ivan had to be portrayed as a ‘state-building’ ruler, a farseeing, wise statesman, and a brilliant war leader and diplomat, regardless of the previous critical attitude of all historians towards all tsars, who were ipso facto negligible and negative factors in history. Ivan’s executions had to be explained as rendered necessary to uproot treason, a justification of Stalin’s own terror, and the identification of Stalin with Ivan was encouraged openly though at times the authors subverted it by using Aesopian language – possibly including Eisenstein himself. The image of Ivan as a ‘progressive’ ruler, was useful also during the Second World War, and it lasted until the death of Stalin, when it was undermined by the rejection of ‘the cult of the individual’, opening the way for a far more wide ranging debate on what was the correct Marxist interpretation of the policies of Ivan. Pokrovsky and Veselovsky were both gradually rehabilitated, and the image of Stalin as Ivan Groznyi served only to discredit Stalin. Historians free of the ideological burden of the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, though in many cases still wedded to Marxism, came forward, and made good use of the increasing number of sources which were being discovered and edited. There is now genuine debate between historians, in part fuelled by the availability in Russia of English originals or Russian translations of many works published by Western historians, and of free communication on the internet. In this book I have drawn to a great extent on the great Russian stalwarts of the history of Ivan IV who published in the twentiethcentury. Veselovsky and Sadikov go back to the 1940s. The doyen of Russian historians of Ivan IV was for many years, until his death in 1988, A.A. Zimin; his major work on the oprichnina appeared in 1964, and was reprinted after his death in 1988, edited by A.L. Khoroshkevich, in 2001. There are some changes, of fact and of emphasis, in this new edition which have been carefully pointed out and assessed in a review by S.N. Bogatyrev.10 Others who have taken up the torch are S.O. Schmidt, N.E. Nosov, I.I. Smirnov, R.G. Skrynnikov,\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage xiv\n\nxiv Ivan the Terrible B.V. Kobrin and many more all of whom have contributed to the pursuit of the elusive truth. I have relied very greatly on their work for factual information, reserving my right to differ on interpretations. I have also drawn upon the work of American and German scholars in this field and here acknowledge my debt to them. The present book is not about Russia in the age of Ivan the Terrible. It is an attempt, on the evidence at present available, to understand and explain Ivan the man and the ruler, whose personal reign, lasting from 1547 to 1584, had such a devastating impact on his people and his expanding country. Any such attempt faces formidable difficulties. First of all the uneven nature of the surviving evidence, so much of which has been destroyed by fire. There is no written trace of Ivan’s personal relationship with any of his seven wives or his children. There is no original written record of any letter, or order, given by the Tsar; there are a few records of private discussions in which he took part, but they are mostly with foreigners, such as the Englishmen Anthony Jenkinson or Sir Jerome Bowes, or the Austrians Count Cobenzl and Daniel Prinz von Buchau, or the Jesuit Antonio Possevino. There are no records of meetings of the Boyar Council, or of any other administrative body, though there are formal records of Ivan’s participation in public assemblies and in occasional formal discussions such as the sessions of the joint meeting of the Boyar Council and the Church Sobor to discuss the major reform programme of the Church and of canon law, known as the Stoglav (Hundred Chapters) in 1551. Formal documents are thus usually very impersonal, when compared with the lively exchange of letters between kings and their counsellors in other countries. There are however very many records, which have survived in a haphazard way, of the organization of military campaigns, the raising of revenue, the distribution of estates, the execution of alleged traitors, and the barbarities committed by and for the Tsar. More source material is continuously being discovered and put into circulation, so that there is a vast amount of material to read. The scholarship, the ingenuity and the assiduity in interpreting this source material displayed by Russian historians over many generations, can only arouse admiration. Nevertheless, the uneven nature of what has survived conduces to a great diversity in its interpretation, and leads the historian to hesitate between possibilities, forcing him or her to lay a number of suppositions before the reader, thus weighing the narrative down with analysis. Much of this discussion has been relegated to the footnotes, which in this case are of greater relevance to the general tenor of the narrative than is usually so. Moreover excessive reliance has had to be placed on foreign sources,\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage xv\n\nForeword xv which have been discovered little by little. The accounts of the two Livonian nobles, Kruse and Taube, were already known at the end of the sixteenth century but were not translated into Russian until 1922.11 The account of the German Schlichting was only translated into Russian in 1934.12 Foreign written sources have been supplemented by foreign prints and engravings, allegedly portraits of Ivan or illustrations of the atrocities committed by his troops. There is no authentic portrait of the Tsar in existence and all those reproduced in books about him are imaginary. The same applies to his father Vasily III. Portraits are printed allegedly of Ivan IV, but facing the other way they are used of the Jesuit Antonio Possevino.13 The engravings of Russian atrocities are all imaginary. What they illustrate may well have happened, because warfare was terribly cruel everywhere at that time, and there is no doubt that Ivan was utterly ruthless towards his enemies, real or imagined. But pictures of atrocities can intensify the impact on the reader and leave a distorted picture on the mind. It is thus infinitely more difficult to study Russian sixteenth-century history than, say, that of Elizabethan England, where the correspondence between the Queen’s advisers, Burleigh, Leicester and Walsingham, for instance, or between her enemies, has survived and enables the historian to associate personality with policy. There has also been in the last thirty years a major assault, in the West, on one of the hitherto most important sources on which historians have depended, namely the correspondence between the Tsar and Prince Andrei Mikhailovich Kurbsky, and the History of Ivan IV, attributed to the latter. Professor Edward Keenan of Harvard University has argued at length that these two works are in fact forgeries, or ‘apocrypha’ as he prefers it, produced in the seventeenth century.14 In addition Professor Keenan has argued that during the reign of Ivan the Terrible, as before and after, Russia was governed by an oligarchy, composed of members of aristocratic clans, closely interrelated by marriage; they governed in the name of the Tsar, who had no power and in the case of Ivan IV, was in fact illiterate. In addition an abyss separated the culture, such as it was, of the secular court society from that of church and monastic society. These latter arguments are expressed in an essay entitled ‘Muscovite Folkways’, originally drafted in 1976 as part of a Department of State contract, rewritten several times, and finally published in 1986, and ‘meant to stimulate and provoke rather than to convince’.15 However, Keenan has recently reiterated his view that Ivan was illiterate.16\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage xvi\n\nxvi Ivan the Terrible This particular reader has not been convinced of the validity of any of these propositions. I am not qualified in linguistic and textual analysis. But as a practising historian I cannot accept the validity of Keenan’s theories on historical grounds. There may be no evidence that Ivan was literate, but there is also no evidence that he was not. And there is no doubt that many boyars were literate – they had to be literate in order to negotiate treaties and truces.17 I cannot accept either that Ivan was the illiterate tool of an oligarchy. It is really wildly improbable that the institution of the oprichnina in 1565, or the destruction of Novgorod and its inhabitants in 1570, were carried out merely on the initiative and authority of princes and boyars, and it certainly was not in their interests. Such policies would have to be imposed by someone with overwhelming authority. There is also too much similarity between the language of Ivan in his first letter to Kurbsky, of 1565, and the letters written to King Sigismund II, Augustus of Poland–Lithuania in 1567; these were ostensibly written by three great magnates in Russian service, and in fact by Ivan himself, and the texts have survived in the records of the Posol’sky Prikaz (Office of Foreign Affairs), and later in the archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.18 It is in my view quite probable that Ivan had learnt to read (it is after all not so difficult); it is equally probable that he did not write himself but dictated his most important missives, as most rulers did. Daniel Prinz von Buchau, imperial envoy in 1575, states positively that it was beneath the dignity of boyars to write themselves.19 The theory of the separation of the two cultures, religious and secular, is also unconvincing, when every line that was written in Russia as part of the formulation or implementation of policy by members of governing bodies is imbued with religious thought and feeling and couched in religious language. Even the lengthy disquisitions of ambassadors are replete with quotations from the Old and New Testaments. Priests were present at births, marriages, and deathbeds, they played a big part as confessors, and in pilgrimages to monasteries, often on foot, which were a frequent and normal part of life. They drew up wills. The Orthodox liturgy repeated familiar sounds to the faithful who probably knew much of it by heart. It is partly for this reason that I have included many quotations from writings attributed to Ivan, whether political or religious or, as so often, both. It is the way into his mind, the only way to understand his personality. In the circumstances, I do not propose to attempt to refute Professor Keenan’s theories, but will confine myself to referring the interested reader to the extensive literature covering the debate which he has launched.20\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage xvii\n\nForeword xvii I have however adopted a few general principles of research and interpretation which I will state here. First of all, I have tried to write the history of Ivan IV, standing in Moscow and looking out over the walls of the Kremlin towards the rest of Europe, and not looking in – and down – into Russia, over its Western border, from outside. Adopting such an approach makes it easier to avoid supercilious judgments, to grasp what happened in Russia in Russian terms, to feel its full tragedy. This may explain why throughout I speak of Russia and not Muscovy. Ivan IV was Tsar vseya Rusi, of all Russia, and he considered himself to be the heir of Kievan Rus’. In the titulature of the Tsar, Vladimir came before Moscow. The emphasis on Moscow derives from the fact that it was the first big city which Westerners of all kinds came across, and by the time they became acquainted with Russia the history of Kievan Rus’ was unknown to them, except of course to the Poles and Lithuanians. I do not believe one can read the present back into the past without distorting the past. Sixteenth-century Russians did not know that four centuries later the Ukraine would be an independent country with its capital in Kiev, nor that Russia would have conquered and then lost the Crimea. At the same time I have pursued a comparative approach, for I think that many of the problems which faced Russia were of the same nature as those which France, Germany and, to a lesser degree, England had to contend with – though not necessarily at the same time as Russia. Both German emperors and French kings had had to struggle to have their authority accepted throughout their lands, a struggle in which Germany failed, and Russia had only partly succeeded by the sixteenth century. England had been forcibly unified under William the Conqueror, but it too had had to struggle to extend its borders to the coasts of the whole island, and to the whole archipelago, and was successful in Wales; partly so, for part of the time, in Scotland, and only partly so in Ireland.21 The Trastámaras and the Habsburgs too had failed to unify the Iberian peninsula, where local fueros or constitutional rights survived, and the realm consisted of a union of crowns: it was a composite state.22 The extension of a central royal authority throughout the realm was only achieved by the Bourbon dynasty in the eighteenth century. The Habsburgs and their predecessors on the imperial throne had dismally failed to unify the German lands. Sweden broke away from Danish control and asserted its independence. These various polities which emerged over time in Europe and turned into nations, share many common problems and it is up to the historian to detect them in the various disguises which they assume because of cultural, religious,\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage xviii\n\nxviii Ivan the Terrible geographical and political differences. England is an island and enjoys the blessings of the Gulf Stream; Russia has mainly infertile soil and an abominable climate; some European countries had been part of the Roman Empire of the West and formed a community which spoke Latin; others formed part of or were influenced by the Roman Empire of the East, practised their common Orthodox Christian religion, adopted much later, in the vernacular, and did not acquire a common language. But all these peoples have an underlying, common, Christian culture and shared political concepts, not always easy to detect, but which it is the duty of historians to seek out and define. Finally I come to the question of the nature of evidence. Here I think that the advice given by Paul Bushkovitch in his ‘The Life of Saint Filipp’ is well worth following. He sets out a number of ‘rules of reading’, recommending them particularly for research into the study of Russian religion. The first and principal rule, which is most relevant to my research is: ‘A text is what it says it is about. Thus the life of Saint Sergei of Radonezh is not about the development of national consciousness in Russia. It is about the life of a monastic saint. It is about monasticism.’ I have tried to follow this thoroughly sound recommendation. I can only hope that I will have satisfied my readers that I have done so. I have also adopted a number of expressions which may seem idiosyncratic to my readers, but which are based on my determination not to mislead them by using words which distort what they meant at the time. The first of these is the word ‘autocracy’, used everywhere now as the translation of the Russian samoderzhavie. In the sixteenth century, and later, samoderzhavie signified sovereignty. Samoderzhets was translated into English as ‘self-upholder’.23 Secondly, I use Russia, not Muscovy to describe the realm of the Tsars, and Russian as an adjective for both Rus’ and Russia. Muscovy was only one principality forming part of Russia, and its Riurikovich Grand Princes maintained their dynastic claims to the principalities on the Dnieper which had been absorbed by Lithuania after the Mongol conquest. Thirdly, I have tried to evade the use of the name ‘Byzantium’. Thanks to Gibbon, It has become associated with deviousness, intrigue, and corruption, and leads readers to forget that Constantinople was founded by a Roman emperor, that for a thousand years it was the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire, using first the Latin, then the Greek language. Not that the Roman empire of Augustus, Tiberius, Nero, Heliogabalus was not also corrupt – but then we are less critical of our own fathers. Finally, faced with the real difficulty of finding suitable terms for the cavalry of Russia, I have borrowed from Professor Valerie Kivelson the designation\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage xix\n\nForeword xix ‘service gentry’ to describe the boyarskiye deti, and the later dvoriane of Russia because as a class they seem to me closest to the English landed gentry at a time when the latter were not at all genteel.

In the first place I must thank the Leverhulme Trust for a generous grant for research assistance to enable me to complete it. I also wish to thank Professors Michael Branch and George Kolankevich, successively Directors of the School of Slavonic and East European Studies, now part of University College London, for the facilities which they granted me, as an Honorary Research Fellow, and which enabled me to make use of the rich collection of the Library of the School. My thanks also go to the Librarian, Dr Lesley Pitman, and the staff of the Library, for their kindness and patience with me, and to Vladimir Smith Mesa for extra special attention. I must also record my gratitude to the London Library, a centre of excellence if ever there was one, and to Raj Khan who looked after my computer. I must single out five people whose help was invaluable. My old friend and colleague, Professor W.F. Ryan, who helped me with offprints and suggestions, read the whole work, and saved me from many infelicities. Needless to say he is not to be blamed for any which remain. Secondly, my new friend (made on the Internet!) Dr Sergey N. Bogatyrev, who was generosity itself, supplying me with offprints, photocopies of his articles, and suggestions for reading, read the whole of my MS, and allowed me to pick his brains in endless conversations. He too, however, must be absolved of responsibility if I have occasionally wilfully refused to follow his lead. And to my old friend, Professor H.M. Scott, who also read the early chapters and gave me sound criticism and advice. Fourthly, Mrs Gwyneth Learner, who took on the chore of being my research assistant and gave me invaluable help in areas beyond my reach. And finally Mrs Vlasta Gyenes, Senior Library Assistant at SSEES, without whose constant friendly and kind assistance I would not have been able to complete my work in the Library now that I can no longer\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage xxi\n\nAcknowledgements xxi climb stairs or ladders.

Until the Mongol conquest in 1238–42, the Orthodox Christian Slavo-Scandinavian1 princes in Russia had maintained relations with the kings of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Poland, Moldavia, Hungary and France, and the Holy Roman Emperor, and there had been frequent intermarriages. Harold Hardrada, king of Norway, married a daughter of Vladimir Yaroslavich; the first wife of Grand Prince Vladimir Monomakh, whom he married in 1067, was a daughter of King Harold Godwineson of England; and the Kievan princess Anna, daughter of Iaroslav the Wise, married Henry I, King of France, in 1051.2 The Mongol Conquest The Mongol conquest profoundly affected the natural evolution of medieval, or Kievan, Russia, but there is no agreement among the experts as to the nature and extent of its impact.3 It was a traumatic experience, coming only thirty-eight years after the fall of Constantinople to the Latin crusaders in 1204. This was also a considerable shock to the Orthodox Rus’, whose religious capital was now in the hands of schismatics, and who had to look to Nicaea for ecclesiastical direction until 1296. The Mongol conquest destroyed the remaining unity of Kievan Rus’.4 A good deal of the south-western part of the old Kievan grand principality, including Kiev itself, which had been devastated, came under direct Mongol rule, and by the fourteenth century had been absorbed, mainly by conquest, into the Grand Principality of Lithuania. As a result\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage 2\n\n2 Ivan the Terrible Kiev went one way and the city of Vladimir on the Kliaz’ma, founded in 1108 by Prince Vladimir Monomakh, went another, with consequences which will be discussed below. The principalities gravitating around the city of Vladimir, in the north-east, and the republic of Novgorod in the north continued under their own princes, subject to Mongol approval. The character of the north-eastern principalities defined the new community which arose around it. The climate was harsher, the winter was longer, the forest was denser, the days were shorter in winter though longer in the brief summer than in Kievan Rus’. Communication with the Eastern Roman Empire or central Europe was more difficult, and settlement was more recent in the north-east. The independent city republic of Novgorod was held by the Mongols on a somewhat loose rein, but it too formed part of the Mongol empire since its trade was of considerable importance to these rulers of the steppe. Not only was the zemlia or land of Rus’ thus divided, the north-east and the south-west losing touch with each other, but the fairly continuous contacts with eastern and central Europe which had marked the old ruling élite and the merchant class were much reduced – except for the city republics of Novgorod and Pskov, which continued to trade with the Hanseatic League, and the trade with the West which trickled through Smolensk. Vladimir and Moscow now participated more in trade ventures to the Middle East. There were no more Riurikid marriages with European royal and princely houses. There were some marriages with the Mongol ruling house, but not many after the conversion of the Golden Horde to Islam in 1340. The Mongols did not settle in Rus’, since the land was not suitable for the nomadic life which was the basis of the economy on which their huge cavalry army relied. Khan Baty established his capital in Saray, on the lower Volga, and summoned the Russian princes repeatedly to Saray, or sent them on to the Mongol capital Karakorum, in Mongolia, to have their iarlyki (patents to rule) renewed. This long journey was so exhausting that several princes, notably Alexander Nevsky, died on the way or the way back. The khan of the Mongol empire had to be chosen among the descendants of Genghis Khan, the Golden Kin. Hence the Mongols were quite prepared to accept the Russian principle of confining the choice of princes to a ruling family, the Riurikids, descendants of the semimythical Scandinavian prince Riurik, and frequently accepted the choice made by the Russians, though they did not hesitate to reject it when they preferred another candidate. Their policy broadly was not to allow any principality to become too strong. They delegated the task of collecting\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage 3\n\nThe Historical Background 3 the heavy tribute imposed on the Russian lands to the princes, and eventually to the ruler of Moscow, though the assessment was made by Mongol officials. It is estimated that in the late fourteenth century the principality of Moscow paid between five and seven thousand rubles a year, a very large sum bearing in mind that this was not the only financial burden.5 There has been much debate among historians on the scale of the physical destruction inflicted by the Mongol invasion, on the nature of Mongol influence on Russian social and political development, and the extent of Mongol responsibility for the perceived backwardness of sixteenth-century Russia. To understand the initial impact of this calamity on the Russians many factors must be considered: its suddenness, the destruction of the economy, the depopulation by death and enslavement and by the conscription of potential soldiers and craftsmen, the loss of skills, the plundered cities and devastated fields, all occurring with the speed of a whirlwind, and recurring whenever the Mongols thought the Russians needed a reminder of their subordinate status. The princes, who may well have been relatively protected from the worst effects of the conquest, had to learn to manoeuvre, to intrigue, lie and bribe, in order to achieve their ends, to submit to the demands of their masters, however humiliating. Inevitably most of the Russian written sources dealing with this period are biased against a people whom they saw as a cruel and destructive oppressor belonging to an alien faith, the Ishmaelites or sons of Hagar.6 Yet Russians and Mongols frequently cooperated on the battlefield, there was some intermarriage, and judging by relationships in the sixteenth century, there was no deep-seated racial prejudice. Moreover, the Russian ulus7 was but a small and relatively unimportant part of the vast lands ruled over by the Golden Horde. Hence most of the political and diplomatic activity of the Khans was oriented towards the East, where their power originated. The portrayal of the Mongols at this time as barbarians living in tents does not do justice to the sophistication of the imperial administration in the west, based on the capital Saray, on the lower Volga, where there was a luxurious court, the streets were paved and there were mosques for the Moslem Mongols and a Russian bishop to minister to the Russian community of craftsmen and soldiers in Mongol service, as well as caravanserais to lodge the vast trading expeditions. However, from the latter part of the fourteenth century the Mongol hold on Russia was affected by discord within the Golden Horde. The victory of Dmitri Donskoi, Grand Prince of Vladimir and Prince of\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage 4\n\n4 Ivan the Terrible Moscow, supported by some other princes, over a Mongol force in 1380 at the Field of Kulikovo raised the prestige of Moscow among the Russian princes, though it was followed by a Mongol revival under Tokhtamysh, who razed Moscow in 1382. Tokhtamysh and his Russian allies in turn were destroyed by Tamerlane who, from his base in Samarkand, devastated Saray, but refrained from destroying Moscow. In the early fifteenth century the Golden Horde broke up into the Khanate of Crimea, the Khanate of Kazan’ and the Great Horde. The two sons of the Khan Ulug-Mehmed of the Golden Horde became vassals of Grand Prince Vasily II, and founded, under Russian protection, the Khanate of Kasimov, on the Oka river. Its Mongol ruler helped Vasily II to regain his throne in the Russian civil wars of 1430–36 and 1445–53, which arose out of the conflict between the traditional Russian principle of lateral succession to the throne (to the next eldest brother) and hereditary succession from father to son, the principle which emerged victorious from the struggle.8 It was against this background of conflict and confusion, of occasional alliances and occasional strife, that the final confrontation took place in 1480, on the River Ugra, between the remnants of the Mongol Great Horde, with its allies in the Crimea and in Poland–Lithuania, and a Muscovite army, with its Mongol allies, the khanates of Kazan’, Astrakhan’ and Kasimov, under Grand Prince Ivan III of Moscow. There was actually no battle, since both sides withdrew before the armies could engage. But from this date Moscow ceased to regard any Mongol horde as its overlord, though it continued to collect the tribute within Russia and distribute it as presents among its Tatar allies on a smaller scale.9 Muscovite leadership in the two major confrontations between Russians and Mongols, at the Field of Kulikovo in 1380 and on the River Ugra in 1480, as well as its victory in the fifteenth-century civil wars, reinforced the Russian perception that the Grand Duchy of Vladimir/Moscow had become the leading principality in Rus’, and Ivan III gradually asserted his sovereignty (samoderzhavie) over the remaining independent Russian principalities including, in a notional sense, those which now formed part of the Grand Principality of Lithuania (see below). The theological interpretation of this ‘victory’ also served to increase the authority of Moscow, for as the Tverian author of The Tale of the Death in the Horde of Michael Yaroslavich of Tver tells it, ‘God gave Jerusalem to Titus not because he loved Titus but to punish Jerusalem’. Thus victory came to Moscow to punish the unbelievers.10 What, if any, influence did Mongol suzerainty have on the development of Muscovite absolutism? The idea of a universal empire instituted\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage 5\n\nThe Historical Background 5 by God was fundamental to the Mongol conception of the world order and there was therefore, in their view, no point in resisting the Mongol army. Once the universal Mongol empire was established everyone would be compelled to serve it. The basic principles of Mongol rule were laid down in the Great Iasa, or Code, attributed to Genghis Khan, which regulated the universal service of subjects in the army and the administration, and proclaimed their duty to care for the sick and the old, to offer hospitality, and to produce their daughters in the beauty contests in which the ‘moonlike girls’ would be selected as wives or concubines of princes.11 The code also dealt with civil, commercial and criminal law, naming as offences acts against religion, morals and established customs, and those against the life and interests of private persons. The usual penalty was death. The practical aspects of Mongol administration and the etiquette in use at the Mongol court were familiar to the Russians who visited Saray; Russians learnt to speak Turkic, and the Mongols probably learnt some Russian. It was perhaps the arbitrary nature of Mongol decisions which most affected Russians, but it may be that this apprenticeship in subservience prepared them for the obsequiousness they are alleged to have shown to the tsars of Moscow. Moreover, Russian grand princes, and many appanage princes, learnt subordination to the Mongols the hard way: between 1308 and 1339 eight princes were executed in the Horde, including four who had become grand princes of Vladimir.12 The Mongol presence was not ubiquitous in Russia, and usually consisted of a limited number of officials, tax collectors, recruiting officers and platoons of cavalry. Yet by the sixteenth century many Russian princely families were stressing their descent from Mongol tsarevichi (sons of khans) or other nobles. The tsarevichi who descended from Genghis Khan took precedence over other princes in Moscow and ranked above or immediately below Riurikovichi until the end of the dynasty in Russia. Russian aristocrats could be proud of their descent from princely Mongol families, where they would have kept silent about descent from commoners.13 It is not easy to be precise about the nature of Mongol influence, for it extended over more than two centuries and the Golden Horde itself went through many changes during that period, including the vital conversion to Islam. But the Russian aristocracy did have fairly close contact with the nomads of the steppe, and by a process of osmosis may well have acquired many habits and adopted assumptions about the objects of a state, the nature of government, relations between lords and vassals, masters and servants, that are difficult to detect today. There are\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage 6\n\n6 Ivan the Terrible two specific aspects of this contact which may have rubbed off on the Russians, namely the degree of cruelty which they actually felt and saw in the executions or in the inflicting of punishment practised in the Golden Horde, and the absence of orderly judicial procedures (they did not usually see Byzantine practices). Not that the Riurikid princes of Russia (or their Viking ancestors) were not capable of great barbarity, but on several occasions, recorded in the Chronicles, such barbarity is clearly regarded as wrong in a Christian country. The Russian Orthodox Church When they conquered Russia in the thirteenth century the Mongols were pagans, and they seem to have treated all religions with tolerance.14 The Russian Church did not suffer under the Mongol regime, but this did not make Christians tolerate Islam after the Mongol conversion in 1340. Inevitably the Russian ecclesiastical establishment was at first almost entirely composed of Greek churchmen from the Eastern Roman Empire. It was drawn from the celibate ‘black’ clergy or monks. Marriage was compulsory for the parish priests or ‘white’ clergy. The metropolitans were chosen and consecrated by the patriarch of Constantinople, and they in turn appointed and consecrated the bishops. The Church was maintained by fees and contributions, by the proceeds of legal fines in areas under its jurisdiction, and by the income from original grants of landed property, which increased gradually as a result of princely and boyar donations to ensure prayers for the souls of the departed, and by monastic purchases. Many churches and monasteries were founded, the most famous of which was the Monastery of the Caves in Kiev. The Trinity monastery was founded in 1337 by St Sergius of Radonezh, not far from Moscow, as an isolated hermitage ‘beyond the Volga’; it grew into the largest landowning community in Russia, with many churches and fortified walls. Another monastery founded on the same system was the Kirillo-Beloozersky (St Cyril of the White Lake), which in turn gave rise to many more such settlements in the northern lands. Further north still was Solovki, the formidable, fortified monastery in the Solovetsky islands in the White Sea which was used also as a prison, certainly by Ivan IV and equally certainly by the later tsars and by the communist regime. Monks, and monasteries, played an important cultural role in Russia. The monks acted as scribes, letter writers, copyists and illuminators of manuscripts; they collected materials for and edited many of the Chronicles; they organized scriptoria, icon and fresco painting studios, and provided what teaching there was as well as some medical care and\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage 7\n\nThe Historical Background 7 a refuge for the poor, sick and destitute. The Church was also present at all the main events of mortal life, birth, marriage and, above all, death. Monasteries were places of pilgrimage. Sums were deposited for monks to say prayers for the dead (though the Orthodox Church did not believe in Purgatory) and to remember the departed on his name day with services and feasting. Nunneries cared for women and girls, and maintained schools of weaving and embroidery. There were no teaching orders. Monks also built churches and oversaw their adornment with icons and frescoes, and they surrounded the monasteries with elaborate fortifications. As in western Europe, monasteries started out in poverty and austerity, and gradually they grew rich and became lax about observing the rules. They benefited from the respect shown by the Mongols for religion, they were not taxed and they prayed for their Moslem overlord. The Church also played an important political role in Russia. It was the only pan-Russian institution, after the Mongol conquest had split Kievan Rus’ in two. Indeed, the metropolitan of Kiev and All Russia (the original designation of the see) was also the ecclesiastical head of all the Orthodox population of the neighbouring Grand Principality of Lithuania for a great deal of the time, though his see had ceased to be in Kiev in 1299 and had moved to Vladimir and eventually to Moscow. The Kingdom of Poland–Lithuania A word must be said here about the complex relations between the two grand principalities, Muscovite Russia and the Grand Principality of Lithuania. A glance at the map on pp. xii–xiii will show the extent to which Kievan Rus’ lay on both banks of the Dnieper and how much territory it lost to Lithuania as a result of the Mongol invasion. The Grand Principality of Lithuania eventually comprised a nucleus of Lithuanian lands, the voevodstva, or provinces, of Troki and Vilna which, under a series of able rulers, extended slowly to the east and south, conquering, annexing and absorbing ex-Rus’ principalities. Polotsk fell into Lithuanian hands when the Riurikid line died out in 1307, Kiev was conquered from the Mongols in 1362, and the Lithuanian advance continued under Grand Prince Vitovt (1393– 1430), down the right bank of the Dniester until it reached the shores of the Black Sea and was finally stopped by the Mongols in 1399. To the east, Lithuania now had also swallowed the central basin of the Dnieper, spreading from the old Kievan principality of Smolensk to Lutsk. All these lands were now the property of Gediminovich15 or Riurikid princes of Lithuania, the latter sometimes holding on to their hereditary\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage 8\n\n8 Ivan the Terrible lands, sometimes being granted new lands as patrimonies by the grand princes of Lithuania. The language of government was a form of Slavonic. As in Kievan Rus’, succession from father to son was not automatic in the Grand Principality of Lithuania: a surviving brother or cousin of the reigning prince would often lay claim to the throne and factional wars were frequent and bloody. Relations with Muscovite Rus’ were fairly close, though not always friendly. Novgorod often looked to Lithuania for princes; discontented Lithuanian princes would desert their grand prince and move to Russia or back to Lithuania, taking their lands with them or being granted lands there. There was in fact no reason why the unification of the Russian lands should not have taken place under Lithuanian leadership. But a decisive event, affecting the future of the whole area of Poland, Lithuania and Russia, occurred in the 1380s. A treaty of 1384 had provided for the marriage of Jagiello, the pagan Grand Prince of Lithuania, with a daughter of Dmitri Ivanovich Donskoi, Grand Prince of Vladimir Moscow. The marriage did not take place. In 1384 Jagiello turned west and was converted to Catholicism in order to marry the Catholic heiress to the crown of Poland, Jadwiga. The possibility that Russia might unite around the huge, mainly Orthodox, Lithuanian and ex-Russian lands, instead of around Moscow was lost for ever. The Lithuanian dynastic union with Poland precluded Lithuanian union with Russia, though Grand Prince Vasily I of Moscow later married Sophia, daughter of Vitovt of Lithuania. As long as Vitovt was alive (and he lived to be eighty) a certain stability prevailed, but he died in 1430, and the constant intriguing between various branches of the princely families in Lithuania, coupled with the civil war in Muscovite Russia, led many princes on either side to desert to the other, moved by religious or political reasons. Although only a loose dynastic union at first, the Lithuanian union with Catholic Poland exacerbated religious differences within the Grand Principality which became more acute with the coming of the Reformation. To a great extent the conflict between the Gediminovichi, the Lithuanian Riurikid and the Muscovite Riurikid princes16 reproduced for years features of the strife over the succession within the Riurikid dynasty itself, and all sides sought the assistance of outsiders like the Livonian Order17 or, even more frequently, the Mongol khans and the khans of the Crimea, one of the successor states of the Golden Horde, who naturally enough pursued their own aims. What, by the sixteenth century, may have attracted the Lithuanian princes to Russia was a latent anti-Catholicism and anti-Polonism (fostered by the\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage 9\n\nThe Historical Background 9 Reformation); what may have attracted the Russian princes to Lithuania was the increasing power of the magnates as expressed in the Sejm and the sejmiki,18 at the expense of the king. What attracted the grand princes of Vladimir Moscow (the official title of the principality) was the possibility of dynastic union with the Grand Principality of Lithuania, leading to a recovery of the Kievan lands in the south, something which Ivan III did not forget when he gave his daughter Elena in marriage to Alexander, Grand Prince of Lithuania, in 1495; nor did Vasily III forget it when on the death of Alexander in 1506 he took advantage of the elective nature of the Polish-Lithuanian throne to put forward his candidacy as prince at any rate of Lithuania.19 The grand princes of Lithuania attempted at intervals to obtain the consent of the Patriarch in Constantinople to the establishment of a separate metropolitanate for Kiev and Lithuania, or Kiev and Little Russia (the name given to the southern borderlands), in order to withdraw their Orthodox, mainly Russian, subjects from Muscovite religious control, but they achieved only short-lived successes. Several of the really powerful and forceful Russian metropolitans also threw their political weight, and sometimes even their spiritual authority, behind the policy of supporting the grand princes of Moscow at Saray in their pursuit of supremacy over the remaining free principalities of Rus’. The Union of the Churches and the Fall of Constantinople The Ottoman onslaught on Anatolia and the Balkans encouraged the rump of the Eastern Roman Empire to seek alliances in the West by pursuing the union of the Catholic and Orthodox Churches, which had been estranged since 1054. Union had already been discussed in a Church Council in Basel in 1433, and discussions were resumed in 1438 in Ferrara. The Metropolitan of All Russia, a Greek named Isidor, was appointed by the Patriarch of Constantinople, but he had not been the choice of the Russian bishops, who had proposed a certain Iona. Isidor proved to be willing to bow to the arguments of the Latins over the filioque clause – the clause in the creed which proclaimed the descent of the Holy Ghost from both the Father and the Son, in the Catholic version, as distinct from the Father only, in the Orthodox version – and to accept the Union of the Eastern and Western Churches. The Council moved to Florence in 1439, to avoid the plague, and the Act of Union with Rome was signed there in July of that year. The Union was unpopular, both in Constantinople and in Russia, and it did not help the Eastern Emperor to secure military assistance against the Turks (though Metropolitan Isidor was given a cardinal’s hat). Isidor arrived back in\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage 10\n\n10 Ivan the Terrible Moscow in 1441, but both the Union and the new cardinal were eventually rejected by Grand Prince Vasily II, and Isidor escaped through Lithuania back to Rome. Both imperial and ecclesiastical governments in Constantinople were in disarray, and in Moscow, Grand Prince Vasily sought to have Iona, the Russian bishop originally chosen, appointed metropolitan. But Vasily was caught up in the disasters of the Russian civil war with his cousin, and blinded, and he was only restored to his throne in 1447. Finally, in December 1448 Iona was appointed Metropolitan of Kiev and All Russia, including Lithuania and Little Russia, on the authority of four Russian bishops and the Grand Prince of Vladimir Moscow, without any reference to the Patriarch in Constantinople. The Russian Orthodox Church had now shaken off the authority of Constantinople and had become autocephalous, with fateful consequences in the long run. The Russian rejection of the Union of Churches in 1439–41 deepened the cultural gulf between the Greeks and the Latins. The fall of Constantinople in 1453 was another great catastrophe and affected the relationship between the Russian Orthodox Church and the Grand Prince. The Emperor (Mehmet II) now reigning in Constantinople was no longer a Christian, and the relationship between the Church and the secular power could no longer be envisaged as a ‘sinfonia’ between two equal powers. And if the Russian Church was now autocephalous, the Grand Duchy of Muscovy was by far the most powerful and wealthy remaining Orthodox realm, able to weigh the scales down against the Church. The patriarchate still survived in Ottoman Constantinople, but it had no power. As the only independent, sovereign, Orthodox power (except for beleaguered Moldavia), Russia was in a position to step into the gap. Inevitably, the fall of Constantinople would enormously increase the prestige of the Grand Prince of Moscow in the whole Orthodox world. The Russian Orthodox Church could find in the concept of translatio imperii a Byzantine authority for an autocephalous church of which the Metropolitan of Moscow was the head. The idea of the translatio imperii, of the transfer to Moscow of the role of religious capital of the Orthodox world (though not of its political domination), lurks behind the titles of tsar and sovereign (samoderzhets) used intermittently by Ivan III. This was not an automatic transfer undertaken immediately after the fall of Constantinople – it was a gradual assertion of the new status of Russia after it had thrown off the remnants of Mongol suzerainty. It could be argued that just as Constantinople had been punished by God for veering towards the Latin Church, so Moscow had been rewarded for rejecting the Union of\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage 11\n\nThe Historical Background 11 Churches. Moscow had also incidentally provided some financial assistance to the Orthodox Church within the Ottoman Empire in the last decades of the fifteenth century. The first exponent of the new theory of Moscow as the third Rome was the Metropolitan Zosima, in the prologue to the new Paskhalia or calendar of religious events for the next millennium, starting in 1492, which he had drawn up in that year. He recorded that the Emperor Constantine had founded a city named Constantine after him, which is Tsargrad, the new Rome, and today God had blessed the new Constantine (Ivan III) and the new city of Constantine, Moscow. The next stage in the evolution of the religious status of Moscow occurred in the reign of Vasily III.20 The Consolidation of Moscow A change had also come over the relative situations of the Grand Prince and the appanage princes in the course of the second half of the fifteenth century which further elevated the former above other princes. Ivan III had gradually succeeded in incorporating into the principality of Moscow most of the remaining independent principalities whose princes still enjoyed some sovereign rights. His most remarkable achievement was the destruction of the independent republic of Lord Novgorod the Great in two successive assaults, in 1471 and 1478. With his Tatar and Tverian allies, Ivan III defeated the forces of Novgorod and executed their leaders in 1471, forcing the defeated to pay a large tribute, to accept Muscovite rule and to cease any direct relations with foreign powers, i.e. Lithuania. In 1478 Ivan III attacked again. The defeated Novgorodians gave up their right to choose their prince, accepted the suzerainty of Ivan III, lost the great bell which had been used to summon the veche (popular assembly), and were eventually subjected to massive confiscation of private and church lands and to huge population transfers. The Grand Prince had now acquired enormous wealth in land, some of which he proceeded to distribute to men-at-arms in service tenure (pomest’ya; hence landowner, pomeshchik). He was to absorb the principality of Tver’ by force in 1485. Tver’ had been the great rival of Moscow in the early fourteenth century, and it continued throughout the fifteenth century to consider itself as a grand principality on a level with Moscow. Its spokesman was the monk Foma, who had been the delegate of Tver’ to the Council of Ferrara/Florence. Its Grand Prince Boris Alexandrovich was chosen by God, according to Foma. He was the great sovereign (samoderzhets), crowned with the tsar’s crown; his city was the new Israel, or the new\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage 12\n\n12 Ivan the Terrible Jerusalem. It was Prince Boris Alexandrovich who used a formula to describe his power identical with that used by Ivan III and which Ivan IV was to use later: ‘I, Grand Prince Boris Alexandrovich am free to reward whomsoever I wish, and to execute whomsoever I wish.’21 The similarity leads one to suppose that this formula expressed a general conception of the rights of a sovereign lord, and did not apply only to the ruler of Moscow. This same prince, Boris Alexandrovich of Tver’, Ivan III’s principal rival, was also known as Groznyi, and the words groznye ochi, or terrible eyes, are used of other princes, as, for instance, in the extremely moving lament for the destruction of Russia after the death of the Grand Prince Yaroslav. This dates from the period of the Mongol conquest, and describes the beauties of the Russian land, its great cities, its monastery gardens, its temples to the Lord, its awesome princes (‘knyazya groznye’, the word used of Ivan IV), its honourable boyars etc. The word groznyi is probably one of those many words which have changed their significance over time. We do not know precisely what it signified, therefore, in the time of its most famous bearer, Ivan IV.22 But there is a nuance between dread and terrible: dread is what one is; terrible refers to what one does.23 Political Ideas The closest the Kievan polity could come to an exposition of the nature and rights of governments was in the Old Testament accounts of the kingdom of Israel and in the history of David and Solomon, with Vladimir as David and Yaroslav the Wise as Solomon, or in the New Testament accounts of the rule of Herod and the relation of the kingdom of the Jews to the Roman Empire. The exposition of theoretical ideas on the East Roman conception of the derivation of power from God, and its relationship with ecclesiastical authority, came later, mainly in collections of Byzantine wisdom such as Melissa or ‘The Bee’, which were translated into Church Slavonic from the twelfth century onwards. The change in the status of Ivan III as Grand Duke of Vladimir Moscow in relation to the remnants of the Horde and to other foreign powers, as well as to other previously independent Russian princes, obviously affected his conception of his power. After the fall of Constantinople and the encounter on the Ugra he assumed the title of samoderzhets, or sovereign, which had already been used by Boris Aleksandrovich of Tver’. Today samoderzhets is always translated as ‘autocrat’, which is, of course, closer linguistically to the original Greek, but completely distorts the sixteenth-century Russian sense of the word, which was ‘sovereign’, an independent ruler who has no overlord.24 Yet,\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage 13\n\nThe Historical Background 13 although the nature of Ivan III’s power in internal matters remained as yet undefined, one can trace in him a gradually more authoritarian, even arbitrary exercise of power. This gradual change was supported by the Russian Church. For some time the Church had been serving the political ends of the principality of Moscow (which seemed the best situated to protect it) and wished to increase its authority and power by adopting East Roman models. It was concerned less with the nature of power and more with how it was exercised, its moral rather than its political dimension. This trend is associated with the writings of Iosif Volotsky, the abbot of the monastery of Volokolamsk, who is often credited with being the father of Russian absolutism. He was one of the earliest to formulate his view of the power of the grand duke and of the relationship between the ruler and the people. Yet Iosif was not an unconditional supporter of the unlimited power of the ruler. In his view, the grand duke’s power came from God, and was given by God to him. But if the grand duke allowed himself to be ruled by evil passions, anger, love of money, injustice, pride, violence and lack of faith, ‘then he was not a servant of God, but of the devil, not a tsar but a torturer’ (‘muchitel’, which also translates the Greek word tyrannos). There was no need to obey such a tsar. A true tsar had to observe the interests of the ‘land’. For Iosif the power might be holy, but not the man, who could be unworthy. Moreover, power was not unlimited but had to be bound by ‘precepts and justice’ (zapovedi i pravda). The concept of the king’s two bodies had entered Russian religious and political thought from the Byzantine deacon Agapetus by the beginning of the twelfth century and it began to pop up in unexpected places.25 In the funeral eulogy pronounced on the death of Vasily III in 1533, the orator exclaimed: We know that in his natural body our ruler is the same as all men; but in his power is he not the equal only of God? He is inaccessible in the glory of his earthly kingdom; but there is a higher, heavenly kingdom, for which he must be accessible and indulgent to people . . . A real tsar rules his passions, in the crown of holy wisdom, in the purple of law and justice.26 The preacher was quoting almost word for word the saying of Agapetus.27 Iosif died in 1515, but his followers developed his ideas later into a systematic support of the absolute power of the ruler as given by God.\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage 14\n\n14 Ivan the Terrible The Court The growing complexity of the administration in the course of the gradual annexation of Russian lands by the Grand Prince of Moscow had led to a considerable evolution of his court whence major decisions now issued throughout the realm. The relationship between the increasingly powerful Grand Prince and the political and social élite has, however, to be reconstructed from what actually happened, from what was tolerated by the magnates around him. His court was, in the words of one of the leading Russian historians of the period, A.A. Zimin, the fundamental social force on which rested the power of the rulers of Moscow. Courts had existed before, and they continued to exist in some of the appanage principalities for some time, where princes still had their own boyars. But the Grand Prince’s court produced the military leaders and the administrative personnel now required to rule the country. It is probably around this time, with the gradual incorporation of so many appanage principalities, and the accompanying loss of sovereign powers by the previously ruling princes, that the grand princes of Vladimir and Moscow began to claim the whole land of Rus’ publicly as their votchina, or patrimony.28 The appanage princes had owned and ruled over their appanages, exercising sovereign power in financial and judicial matters. These powers were taken over and used by the grand princes of Moscow as the appanages were absorbed. This process of integration was for some time the principal internal administrative problem which faced the grand princes of Moscow, and is usually described by Soviet and western historians as the ‘centralization of the Russian state’.29 It involved the extension of the prince’s authority uniformly throughout the land in judicial, financial and military matters, at a time when most of the population was illiterate, communications were extremely slow and difficult, there was still considerable resistance to the Grand Prince’s authority, and there was almost no administrative machinery. The problem was at this time (fifteenth and sixteenth centuries) common to most European polities, in many of which royal power was even less centralized than in Russia, because of constitutional structures (as in Poland–Lithuania), fragmentation (as in Germany), religious warfare (as in France and the Netherlands) or dynastic separatism and local rights (as in the Iberian peninsula). In fact the two most advanced countries in this respect were the Ottoman empire and England, in both of which power was in the hands of a new dynasty by conquest, and the power of the Crown was being extended. The social pyramid resulting from the fusion of the principalities consisted of the appanage princes, in the north-east of Russia, who\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage 15\n\nThe Historical Background 15 owned land by inheritance from a previous Riurikid princely ancestor, and who still occasionally enjoyed a degree of independent and sovereign power over their lands, and might even have a claim to the grand princely throne. A similar position was held by the ‘upper’ princes on the River Oka, who served the grand princes from the west Russian lands bordering on Lithuania (at times in Lithuania), both Riurikid and Gediminovich.30 They sometimes served with their own forces, and preserved a greater degree of autonomy in their internal affairs than the Moscow princes; so did the one-time appanage princes of Suzdal’ (the Shuiskys, Rostovskys, Yaroslavskys etc). In addition there were the nontitled nobles, of whom the highest in rank were the old Moscow boyars, who supplied the leading military commanders and the top governors, and as a group manoeuvred for position and precedence with untitled nobles from other principalities. The aristocracy as a whole was considerably weakened by the practice of partible inheritance, which led to the multiplication of title-holders and the division and subdivision of estates between siblings, until there was not enough left to divide. The lack of hereditary titles associated with posts, or of hereditary posts of any kind,31 also considerably weakened the aristocracy and impeded its consolidation into a political class as distinct from a series of clans. The title of boyar was not hereditary, though the family might inherit a claim to be promoted to the rank. It depended on the grant of the tsar. The title of prince could not be granted; princes were born, and all their children inherited the title. Precedence at court and in service was regulated by the practice of mestnichestvo, which is dealt with below.32 Finally there were the so-called deti boyarskie, or boyars’ children, called service gentry for convenience here. These were a mixed bag, originally comprising descendants of princely or noble families who had multiplied to such an extent that they were compelled by poverty to serve for a fairly low reward; minor landowners, foreigners and immigrants from other principalities who received allotments of land for their service; as well as occasional sons of priests or even ex-slaves.33 Institutions A striking feature of Russian political structure was its lack of institutionalization. Carrying on from the early tradition of the prince consulting his war band, the grand princes’ retinues had taken part in the duty of giving advice to the ruler in the commonwealth of Rus’.34 These families of princes and untitled long-serving aristocrats were called by the generic name of boyar, which gradually became identified also with membership of the Grand Prince’s Council, a body which grew\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage 16\n\n16 Ivan the Terrible out of the topmost level of the court. The practice of governing by council was traditional and still survived in some of the appanage principalities in the sixteenth century. The Grand Princess Sofia even had her own council, and so did many appanage princes in the reigning family. The princely council is a most elusive body, which has left no record of its setting up, its functions, debates or decisions, its active membership at any time, or its constitutional status or role, if any. Its members were appointed by the grand prince and were placed in one of two ranks at its emergence in the late fifteenth century: the boyars proper, or highest rank, and the okol’nichi, a word which derives from okolo, or ‘near’, and evidently defined a man near the prince. The rank is first recorded in the thirteenth century, sometimes in conjunction with other court ranks such as cupbearer.35 There were not many of these okol’nichi, and according to Herberstein, they were a ‘sort of praetor or judge, placed near the lord’ and always with him.36 Ivan III made more changes to Russian titulature, which reflect the maturing of a political conception and which probably developed out of his marriage to the niece of the last Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, Constantine Paleologus. He began to use, frequently, but not always, the title Tsar (Caesar), which may have indicated an intention of claiming imperial status. Now that there was no longer an Orthodox tsar in Constantinople, he could put forward a claim to inherit the religious mantle and almost a hereditary right to the imperial title (the translatio imperii). He adopted, possibly in imitation of the Habsburgs, the device of the two-headed eagle (believed by some to be the coat of arms of the Paleologi), and used it on his coinage. He added to his titles the words ‘of all Russia’ (vseia Rusi), stressing his dynastic claim to sovereignty over all the Russian principalities, and therefore the right to reconquer those principalities of Kievan Rus’ which were now in Lithuania. He was even able to force acceptance of this claim on the Grand Prince of Lithuania in a treaty of 1494.37 Ivan III also added to his title a long list of the various principalities and kingdoms over which he ruled. This is often interpreted as the self-advertisement of a parvenu among crowned European heads, but it is more likely to be an imitation of the general European practice.38 Grand Prince Ivan III firmly asserted his independence of all superior secular and ecclesiastical authority, on an occasion that has often been viewed as typical of Russian arrogance but is really perfectly understandable. When the imperial envoy Nicolas Poppel proposed in 1489 that his master the Emperor Frederick III should grant Ivan III the title\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage 17\n\nThe Historical Background 17 of ‘king’, as an inducement to join an alliance against the Porte, the Grand Prince replied that he and his ancestors had been lords in their lands from time immemorial, that their lands had been granted by God, and that he needed no help from the Emperor.39 Rus’ had never after all been part of the Holy Roman Empire, nor even of the Eastern Roman Empire. It had now also, incidentally, ceased to be part of the Mongol Empire. Sofia Paleologa More difficult to explore adequately is the extent of the personal influence – if any – of Zoe Paleologa, the ‘Despina’ herself.40 Many Russian historians have rejected any such influence for reasons that seem anachronistically nationalistic.41 Having lost his wife, Princess Maria Borisovna of Tver’, Ivan III sought a new bride. There was some talk of a Saxon princess, but after the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks, the niece, even of a dead Roman emperor, might provide an attractive proposition and would raise the position of the Grand Prince of Moscow even further above the shoulders of his kin and his rivals and strengthen his international position. Sofia, as she was called in Moscow, was the daughter of Thomas, brother and heir of Constantine Paleologus, the last East Roman Emperor, who died on the walls of Constantinople in 1453. Her father had been Despot of Morea and died in Rome in 1460, leaving also a son, Andrei. Born in 1440 or 1449, Sofia herself was brought up in Rome, and though Orthodox by birth she may have been a Catholic by upbringing. The initiative for the marriage came from Pope Paul II, through Cardinal Bessarion of Nicaea, a supporter of the Union of Churches.42 The Pope, needless to say, hoped to secure Ivan III as a powerful ally against the Turk, as well as his consent to the Union of Churches. Agreement on the marriage was soon reached and Sofia left Rome in June 1472. She travelled with a large retinue by land and sea to Pskov’, where she was greeted with a banquet, and where the first signs of strain between Latins and Greeks were noted when her escort, Cardinal Antonio Bonumbre, allowed himself to be preceded by a crucifix held aloft. (The body of Christ did not appear on Russian Orthodox crosses at that time.) 43 Sofia was evidently quite accustomed to public appearances and knew how to thank the Pskovites gracefully for their welcome. She arrived in Moscow on 12 November 1472, and the wedding took place the next day in order to evade the impending church fast. There was no coronation ceremony. It took considerable courage and character for a young woman to embark on a marriage to the ruler of a country about which so little was\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage 18\n\n18 Ivan the Terrible known, and it is fair to assume that Sofia was a woman of parts. Ivan’s physical presence was overwhelming: he was tall, lean and a fine figure of a man, but women looked away from him, frightened by his eyes. He was a formidable drinker, and after the long midday meal, lay in a drunken stupor, according to Herberstein’s gossip (the traditional siesta, as recommended by Grand Prince Vladimir Monomakh).44 It is also probable that Sofia evaded the complete seclusion imposed on high-born Russian women. She received foreign envoys, for instance. According to Herberstein, ‘they say that she was a very cunning woman, and the prince acted very often on her suggestions’.45 Certainly her arrival, accompanied by a number of Italians and Greeks who settled in Russia, led to a remarkable opening to the West in many fields. According to one account, she was ashamed to see her husband standing before the seated envoys of the Mongol Horde to pay the tribute, and it was she who urged him to make the final stand on the Ugra in 1480 which put an end to the official suzerainty of the Mongols over Russia. S.M. Solov’ev puts forward the theory that the Church, anxious to assist the grand princes of Moscow in the achievement of sole power (edinovlastie), had for a long time been endeavouring to raise them above the other princes, but for the successful conclusion of their undertaking they had to draw on the traditions of the Roman Empire of the East. These traditions were brought to Moscow by Sofia Paleologa. ‘He [Ivan III] was the first to be called Groznyi, because he seemed to the princes and to his druzhina like a monarch.’46 He raised himself to an unattainable height, and compelled the descendants of Riurik and Gedimin to bow before him like the lowliest of his subjects. It was he who introduced the habit of kissing the grand duke’s hand, of using the word ‘kholop’ (bondsman or slave) to describe oneself in relation to the grand prince, and expected reports and petitions to be signed with the demeaning diminutive, for instance Ivashka, for Ivan. Ivan’s contemporaries, continues Solov’ev, believed that this was due to Sofia’s influence, ‘and we have no reason to disbelieve them’.47 It seems that perhaps we may have many reasons to disbelieve them, yet Prince A.M. Kurbsky, writing in the reign of Ivan IV, lamented that the devil had sowed evil habits in the excellent clans of Russian princes, just like the kings of Israel had done, by means of their evil and sorcerous wives, particularly those whom they took in marriage from foreigners. Elsewhere Kurbsky accuses ‘the Greek’ of having been instrumental in the death of Ivan III’s eldest son.48 But possibly a more perceptive critic of Sofia was Bersen’ Beklemishev (of noble family but not officially a boyar), who in the reign of Vasily III allegedly said to the monk and man\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage 19\n\nThe Historical Background 19 of letters Michael Trivolis, known in Russia as Maksim Grek (Maxim the Greek):49 ‘When the Greeks came here, our land fell into confusion. Until then our land had lived in peace and quiet. But as soon as the mother of the Grand Prince, the Grand Princess Sofia, came here with your Greeks our land fell into confusion and great disorder, like with you in Tsargrad [Constantinople].’ When Maksim objected that Sofia descended on both sides from great families, Bersen’ continued: ‘Whatever she may have been she brought discord to us. A land which gives up its own customs will not stand for long, and the Grand Prince has changed the old customs here; what good can we hope for from that?’50 Ivan III’s new political conceptions found visual expression in the remodelling of the city of Moscow on a far grander scale in brick and stone. He rebuilt the three cathedrals, to record births (Annunciation Cathedral), coronations (Dormition Cathedral) and death (Archangel Cathedral) within the Kremlin; he built himself a new palace fit for a tsar (the Palace of Facets); he reconstructed the walls of the Kremlin, using Russian builders as well as Italians who had come in the train of Sofia; and he drew on the best artists of the time to decorate the churches with frescoes. The new palace would also serve as the base for a new and far more elaborate and carefully regulated court, with new ranks, a far more ceremonious treatment of both Russians and foreigners and the extension and depersonalization of court service.51 Sofia almost certainly had her say in matters of the succession. She bore Ivan III five sons and three daughters, and there was doubtless some pillow talk, even if she lived in the women’s quarters. We do not know where she in fact lived. She clearly helped to give external shape and form to Ivan’s aspirations to sovereignty and provided him and Vasily III with information on court ceremonial in Constantinople and Rome. In the years from 1470 to the death of Vasily III in 1533 there were many foreigners in Russia, but Sofia was better placed than anyone to inform the Grand Prince and the court about the way things were done abroad. The End of the World The political crisis of the last decade of Ivan III’s reign is shrouded in mystery and was played out against the background of a religious crisis which saw the appearance of the first translation of the Bible as a whole into the Church Slavonic language, and the first executions for heresy in Russia. Briefly summed up, in 1497 the Grand Prince, having lost his son and heir, Ivan, by his first wife, appointed his grandson, Dmitri Ivanovich, by his daughter-in-law the Princess Elena of Moldavia,52 as\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage 20\n\n20 Ivan the Terrible his heir and had him crowned as co-ruler. Two years later the most prominent boyars at the Grand Prince’s court, Ivan III’s uncle by marriage, the ex-Lithuanian Gediminovich Prince Iuri Patrikeevich, and his son Vasily, were arrested. Others arrested at the same time were executed, but the Patrikeevs were spared though forced to take the cowl, Vasily under the name of Vassian. The arrests seem to have been connected with tension between the supporters of the young Dmitri, Ivan III’s grandson, and Vasily, the eldest of his sons by Sofia, as heirs to the throne. The mother of Dmitri, Princess Elena, was in addition closely linked to a group of so-called ‘Judaizers’, heretics of a sort difficult to define. Russian scholars have argued endlessly about the interpretation of these events without reaching any satisfactory conclusion.53 The ‘Judaizing’ heresy, about which very little is known, was first detected in Novgorod, where according to the story a number of local people had been converted to Judaism by an alleged Jew, Zechariah, brought in the train of a Lithuanian prince, Mikhail Olel’kovich.54 No one knows what the tenets of the Judaizers actually were, but it is very possible that they were influenced by latent anti-clericalism, rationalism and iconoclasm, a desire for simplification, and ultimately antiTrinitarianism or even Arianism. There may have been some reflection of Hussite ideas. On the other hand there may also have been elements of Jewish mysticism, possibly even Kabbalistic studies or some acquaintance with the substantial quantity of translations from the Hebrew available in the Grand Principality of Lithuania.55 Identifiable members of the heresy are very few, but it is known that there were converts at the court of Ivan III, where his daughter-in-law Elena of Moldavia seems to have been one of the most prominent, and where Fedor Kuritsyn, a leading diplomat, the man who is said to have transmitted the Tales of Vlad the Impaler to Russia, and even Ivan III himself were said to be sympathizers. The apparent flourishing of heresy led the Archbishop of Novgorod, Gennadi, a man of considerable intellectual calibre, to pursue heretics with their own weapons and to set up a centre for the study of ‘Latin’, i.e. Catholic, culture while at the same time driving forwards the preparation of what he regarded as the main weapon against heretics, namely the translation of the complete Bible into Church Slavonic.56 (His hope that Ivan III would introduce an institution on the lines of the Spanish Inquisition was disappointed.) Some, but not all, of the books of the Old and New Testaments and the Apocrypha were available in the form of separate manuscripts or collections of different and often incomplete books; among those that were not available were the\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage 21\n\nThe Historical Background 21 Chronicles (Paralipomenon) the first, second and third books of Esdras, parts of Ezekiel and other apocryphal books. 57 The Judaizing movement flourished against a background of religious turbulence caused by the widely held belief that the world was coming to an end in the year 1492, the end of the seventh millennium in the Orthodox calendar, calculated from the creation of the world, and by the circulation of popular millenarian texts. The apprehension caused by the continuing advance of the Ottomans, culminating in the overthrow of the last remnant of the East Roman Empire, and the loss of Constantinople, was bound to have an extremely unsettling effect on all those living within the spiritual and physical radius of these dramatic events. By some the Ottomans were identified with Antichrist, as described in Revelations, and it had now become possible to draw upon the accounts in a Slavonic Bible to express these fears. Not less unsettling was the fact that the world did not come to an end in 1492. Russia and Europe The collapse of the Golden Horde, the advance of the Ottomans on the Black Sea and in Europe, and the Church Councils of Basel and Ferrara/Florence led in the second half of the fifteenth century to a considerable enlargement of the range of contacts between Russia and other European countries, particularly in south-east Europe, where the two dynastic houses, the Habsburgs and the Jagiellos, were in conflict over the lands of Bohemia, Poland and Hungary, all now threatened by the Ottoman advance. This explains the initiation of diplomatic exchanges with the Holy Roman Emperors (Frederick III and Maximilian I), the Papacy, the Ottomans and the semi-independent countries in the Balkans. Both emperors approached Russia in attempts to secure an alliance with the Grand Prince against the Ottomans. But Ivan was not to be diverted from his principal foreign policy problem: relations with Poland–Lithuania over their competing claims to the lands of the Dnieper basin, and the policy of each power of calling on the help of the khans of Crimea against the other. During the reign of Ivan III, the Grand Prince had managed to maintain an alliance with Mengli-Girey, Khan of the Crimea, which safeguarded his southern frontier during intermittent warfare with Poland–Lithuania.58 The diplomatic usages and ceremonial of Moscow had developed in relations with the Tatar Moslem khanates, which perpetuated the inferior status of Moscow and which exacted the exchange of elaborate gifts. Russian envoys abroad also frequently indulged in trade in goods they had brought with them – a practice regarded as beneath their\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage 22\n\n22 Ivan the Terrible dignity in the West. During the reign of Ivan III problems of precedence with Western countries were not frequent, though the Russian practice of conducting negotiations with Sweden and the Livonian Order through the governor in Novgorod and not in Moscow continued. Direct negotiations also occasionally took place between boyar members of the Russian Council and members of the Lithuanian Council, and negotiations with the Porte usually took place in Kaffa, not in Istanbul. By the death of Ivan III, Russia was well established on the diplomatic circuit, though its presence is largely ignored by Western historians.59\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage 23\n\nChapter II The Reign of Vasily III\n\nIvan III died in 1505, and his son Vasily acceded to the throne, as the result of his victory in a struggle for the succession between 1502 and 1505. On 14 April 1502, Ivan had transferred the Grand Principalities of Vladimir and Moscow to Vasily as samoderzhets (sovereign), thus depriving his grandson Dmitri, who had been arrested three days earlier with his mother, Elena, of his inheritance. This was clear proof of Ivan III’s earlier assertion of the underlying instability of the principle of succession in Russia: ‘Am I not free to decide between my children and my grandchildren? I will give my principality to whom I wish.’1 Ivan’s final will had apparently been written between late 1503 and June 1504. In it he had ‘blessed his son Vasily’ with the principalities which his father had left him and which God had given him, and he had left minor appanage lands to his younger sons, enjoining them to obey their elder brother. Sofia had died on 17 April 1503, and it is very probable that Vasily now became all-powerful in a court in which his father’s health was deteriorating, possibly to the extent of total incapacity.2 Ivan III had strengthened Vasily’s hold on the throne by preventing any of his own younger brothers (Vasily’s uncles) from marrying and having children.3 Sofia gave Ivan III five sons, and Vasily too, when he became Grand Prince, did not allow his younger brothers to marry until he had a son, and two of his brothers died in prison before him. The rules for the succession adopted by Ivan III clarified one issue: in order to inherit, the heir had to be the son of a Grand Prince (like Vasily).4 There remains a curious doubt about the general acceptance of Vasily’s legitimacy as ruler. According to Herberstein, Vasily came to the throne as regent until the death – in prison – of Dmitri in 1509, when he entered into his full inheritance, but without a coronation. Grand Prince Dmitri, who had been crowned, was still alive when Ivan III died, and his coronation evidently gave him some protection.5\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage 24\n\n24 Ivan the Terrible One of the last concerns of Ivan III before he died was the marriage of Vasily, now in his early twenties, which was late for Russian dynastic marriages. Efforts to find a princely bride outside Russia failed, though until then grand princes had made dynastic marriages with princesses from appanage families and often from Lithuanian families in the hope of inheriting a principality, or at least making a claim to an appanage. The marriages of Ivan III’s son and daughter to a Moldavian princess and a Grand Duke of Lithuania (Catholic at that) respectively were again clearly designed with foreign policy in view and to raise Russian prestige. But such marriages were now no longer possible: there were few appanages apart from those granted to immediate members of the grand princely family, which put them within the prohibited degrees, and Orthodox Europe was in Ottoman hands. It seems, therefore, that it was for Vasily that the practice was introduced of summoning a ‘brideshow’, or beauty parade of all suitable young ladies from noble families for him to choose among them. The logistics of such a beauty parade seem on the surface to make it a quite improbable performance. But Herberstein, who was in Russia twelve years after Vasily’s wedding on 4 September 1505, reports that some 1,500 noble girls were brought together in the summer of 1505, and Vasily chose Solomonia Iur’evna Saburova, the daughter of a boyar from a relatively modest family. The thought of 1,500 nobly born young ladies being trundled through the muddy roads of Moscow in the huge wooden carriages without springs (kolymaga) used at the time makes one wonder if the numbers were not wildly exaggerated. The custom was probably recommended by Sofia as a solution to the problem of selecting a wife for a member of the grand princely family, though she died before the wedding. The marriage, alas, was not a success, for Solomonia failed to perform her principal function. She had no children. The problem of Vasily’s childlessness became crucial for the Grand Prince at almost the same time as a similar problem arose many miles away, and in both cases the solution profoundly affected the relationship between the Crown and the Church. Vasily was some twelve years older than Henry VIII of England, but it was roughly at the same time, in the early 1520s, that their common problem became acute.6 However, Henry was faced with a far more complex situation, because not only was he in love with another woman, but his wife was the aunt of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Moreover, he belonged to the Catholic Church and needed to obtain the approval of its ecclesiastical head, the Pope, who lived out of his reach, for an annulment. Vasily, too, was forced to manoeuvre carefully, for the Orthodox Church did not\n\n1645 Ivan... pp i-xxii,1-490\n\n11/1/06\n\n2:57 pm\n\nPage 25\n\nThe Reign of Vasily III 25 approve of the divorce of an innocent wife. According to one account, he sent to the Patriarch in Constantinople for consent, which was refused. The elders of Mount Athos also rejected his pleas. Thus Vasily needed to build up support in the Russian Church and to win the concurrence of the Metropolitan in office, Daniel, who would have to ensure that the Church Council summoned to pronounce the annulment would override the Patriarch of Constantinople.7 A new marriage had also to be carefully considered because it would lead to the introduction into the magic circle of the court and council of members of the family of the new wife, and upset the existing balance between families and clans. The divergences within the Church and in society already apparent under Ivan III now began to emerge in a new and more effective form. The heresy hunt against the Judaizers of the late fifteenth century had become associated with a theoretical dispute over landownership which had been rumbling for some tim"
