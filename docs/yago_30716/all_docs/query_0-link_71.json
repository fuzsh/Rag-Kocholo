        "text": "MOSCOW\n\nPrince Yuri Dolgoruki.\n\n\"Priidi brat'e ko mne na Moskov, l'udi, brat'ya ko mne na Moskvu,\" (come brothers to me on the Moskov, come one come all to me, to Moscow), thus the chronicle mentions Moscow for the first time in 1147; the message sent by the first builder of the ancient Suzdal land, first because heretofore, the Suzdal land was as it were without a ruler. And thus prince of Suzdal, Rostov and Vladimir and son of Vladimir Monomakh, Yuri (Georghi) Vladimirovich Dolgoruky, invited his ally, prince Svyatoslav Ol'govich Seversky of Chernigov, \"Posyval zvat' na sebya nachisnye pev,\" ( come and join me in a celebration at Moscow ) to a meeting there. He was taken by the natural beauty of the hills and the village which dominates the confluence of the two rivers, Moskva and Neglinaya, and found it suitable for his new town of Moscow. The town is named for the river Moskva, which in turn got its name from the old Slavic (Mordavian) root \"mosk\" which means \"moisture,\" or \"marches.\" The legend says that the entire area was a domain (several settlements) of a wealthy boyar, Stepan Ivanovich Kuchko, who obviously resented the visit of the powerful prince. The potent Yuri on the other hand was displeased with Kuchko for not showing him the proper respect, and ordered that the refractory (village tavern) owner be executed and all his property confiscated and annexed to the Suzdal principality. Another account says that the main reason for the elimination of Kuchko was a brief love affair between his wife and Yurii. The historical fact, however, is that Kuchko died, and that his sons and beautiful but evil daughter Ulita were sent to Vladimir. There Yuri's son Andrey fell in love with Ulita and married her in 1156. Irked by the unresponsiveness of her husband and vengeful for the loss of her father, Ulita plotted with her brothers a conspiracy that ended in the assassination of Prince Andrey, one of Vladimir's most prominent rulers.\n\nIn acknowledgment of his founding of the future Russian capital, Moscow erected an impressive equestrian monument to Prince Yurii Dolgoruky. It is located just opposite the city Hall on Tverskaya street. The legacy of Boyar Kuchko if anyone cares to remember is that before Yurii, he established the first settlement, which was named Kuchkovo, a name that was used for centuries to refer to the \"Pasage\" of a great meadow across the river, where large cow herds grazed, and mustangs roamed. The surrounding meadows, fields, and clearings, this blessed land where farmers tilled the soil, where gardens grew plenty, and fruit groves flourished is how the name Kuchkova polya, meaning huge bales of hay, came to be irrevocably tied to the land; that field that ran from the Kremlin hill, that is now Lyubyanka square. In all probability the area was populated before Kuchko. The spot was indeed beautiful. When in 1847, the Kremlin' Armory was being built, close to the first in antiquity church of Ioan the Precursor, several artifacts of the pagan era where found. These were two large silver plated bronze hoops, heavy and tightly wound garlands, with pendants, ear-rings, and rings. These are generally present in ancient burial mounds. In another village of the same era in the place where in the last century the cathedral of Christ Our Savior was built, at the source of the river Chertoryiya, when the foundation for the enormous cathedral was excavated, amongst other items were two silver Arabian coins. It was determined that these were dirgem, one of which was stamped in 862 in the city of Merve (on the territory of present Turkestan), the other in 866 in the city of Armenge (Armenia). We know that at that time and before, Viatichi, one of the Slavic tribes, populated the Moscow region. To the north of the Viatichi lived the Krivichi, another Slavic tribe. Both tribes established themselves in the area of the rivers Oka, Moskva and where the Volga begins, before history records their existence. Obviously the presence of rivers has always been important detail in the life of any people, and Moscow itself owes to a large extent its prosperity to its three rivers: Moskva, Neglinaya and Yauza. Later it was discovered that Moscow has not only three rivers but rises on seven hills, exactly the same as Rome and Constantinople; destiny was thought to have decreed it the tsar's capital city after the successful unification of all the people and their lands. The names of the seven hills are: Borovitski, Sretenski, Tverskoi, Trekhgorye (on presna), Vorobyevy Gori, Vagankievsky and Lefortovo. Moscow was considered to be a \"Third Rome.\" During Stalin's time Moscow was often called \"the Capital of the World,\" a term that has not been forgotten in communist times. Moscow's importance has considerably risen after the second World War, mainly due to the ever-increasing role that the Soviet Union continues to play in international policy and trade. Its face is rapidly changing and so is the composition of its population. It is acquiring cosmopolitan traits as have most other metropolises, though not so rapidly as New York, Paris, London and others. With the exception of the Kremlin and a few other spots, old Muscovy is gone and Karamzin's words: \"He who wants to know Russia, should visit Moscow,\" are hardly valid any longer.\n\nThe Kremlin.\n\nBefore he left his new little village for Suzdal, Yurii ordered that wooden walls be built around it. This marked the beginning of the Kremlin's existence on the Borovitski Hill. The hill was an ideal natural spot for defense, located right at the juncture of the two rivers. It is bounded on the north and west by the Neglinaya and on the south by the Moskva. A deep moat dug on the east side and flooded by water diverted from the Neglinaya closed the triangle and completed the protection of the hill from all sides. A high and strong palisade of strong oak was the additional protection that surrounded the village.\n\nThe origins of the word \"Kremlin\" (kreml') remain unclear. One story says that it comes from a Tatar word, pronounced similarly, which means \"stronghold,\" the other more patriotic version is that it derives from the old Slavic word \"kremen\" which means primarily \"flint,\" but also \"strong,\" or \"strong as flint' and , consequently, could describe a 'stronghold.\" It is of interest to note that the early chronicles used the words \"grad' and \"detinets\" instead of \"kremlin.\" Both mean \"village,\" \"settlement\" and also \"fortified place.\" Almost all Russian Kremlin followed the same pattern of construction, and in most cases they were built close to a river, preferably a bifurcation of two, a brook or lake, for better protection and insure water supply in case of a prolonged siege. Until the 14th century oak tree trunks were used in most cases to build the walls around the Kremlin, but there were also a few that were made of stone, such as the one in Novgorod, which got its first stone \"detinets\" in the 11th century. When the early Russian grand dukes and tsars started to build a series of stone Kremlins in major outpost towns along the borders to better defend the country from foreign invasions, the use of stone for any other purpose was forbidden because of its scarcity and a capital punishment was imposed on those who broke the tsar' ukaz.\n\nMoscow became an appanage (udel) of Yurii's descendants and nobody before Vladimir Vsevoldovich, son of Vsevolod III Yuryevich, or \"Big Nest,\" agreed to go there to live. Neither did Vladimir stay there a long time; his brother Yurii chased him out. The Russia of that time was divided into numerous small independent principalities, usually inherited as appanages or taken from a brother or a cousin in a continuous internecine struggles. It is not surprising that they became easy prey for the Tatars, who just at that time started their invasions. In 1238 Moscow too shared the fate of other Russian cities and towns and was pillaged and burned to the ground by the horsemen of Chingis Khan's grandson, Batu (Batia) Khan. This marked the beginning of the Tatar yoke for the Russian nation, but the princes continued their internal struggles under foreign tutelage.\n\nDaniil Aleksandrovich.\n\nThus, when in 1272 the sons of Alexander Nevsky, Grand Duke of Vladimir, partitioned among themselves the territories that their father controlled, the youngest, Daniel, (Daniil) 1272-1303 received Moscow as his appanage. He went there and soon realized the possibility that Moscow could play an important role in preventing further dissolution of the country and eventually emerge as a new capital city in the subsequent struggles against the Tartars and in the fulfillment of the national aspirations of the entire people. In 1296 he proclaimed Moscow a principality and officially made himself the first prince of Moscow. His importance among Russian princes considerably increased, when in 1302 he took under his control the ancient principality of Pereiaslavl-Zalessky and a few regions around Moscow including Kolomna. Daniel enlarged his capital and laid foundations for its rapid growth. Its convenient geographical position offered many advantage for political expansion and for the development of local and foreign trade. With this came increased cultural relations with other principalities and neighboring countries. Daniel organized an army, built new fortifications around the Kremlin, and established several strategic forts around Moscow, including the Danilov monastery, which he founded. The Chronicle mentions that he built two wooden churches in the Kremlin: The Church of the Transfiguration and the Church of Archangel Michael. Daniel was canonized by the Church and history recognized him as the founder of the dynasty of Moscow princes.\n\nYurii (1303-1325) succeeded his father in 1303. When the grand duke of Vladimir, Andrey III Alexandrovich, died in 1304, Yurii claimed the vacant throne of his uncle for himself as the only direct descendant of Alexander Nevsky. However, after prolonged conflicts and undignified conduct by both contenders at the Golden Horde, Khan Tokhty gave the \"yarlyk\" (a written decree issued by khans designating a prince to hold a certain title) to the nephew of Nevsky, Prince Michael Yaroslavich of Tver, (1305-1318) because he offered more tribute money than Yurii; he was the first to assume the title of \"The Grand Duke of All Rus\" (Russia). In the beginning the boyars and the Orthodox Church gave full support to Michael. In 1299 Kiev Metropolitan Maxim moved to Vladimir, where he assumed for the first time the title of \"Metropolitan of All Russia.\" The Orthodox Church's cooperation with Michael was cut short when at the end of 1304 Maxim died. To replace Maxim, Michael had his own candidate, but the Patriarch of Constantinople appointed metropolitan Peter (1305-1306) to the Russian see. When Peter reached Vladimir in 1309, Michael showed open hostility towards the new head of he Orthodox Church. Yuri, of course, did just the opposite, making Peter one of his most ardent supporters. After a while, Peter even moved his see to Moscow. Michael blundered even more when Novgorod invited Yuri to become its prince. To impose his rule over the free city Michael needed the help of Tatar troops; he then imposed ruthless repression, and finally lost the war when Tatar support was withheld. At this time changes took place at the Golden Horde too; Khan Uzbek replaced Kahn Tokhti, who died. Yuri rushed to pay respect to the new khan and stayed at his court for two years. After marrying the khan's sister there and promising to collect even higher tribute for the khan from his subjects, he was appointed grand duke of Vladimir (1318-1322).\n\nMichael organized resistance, and not far from Tver, at Bortenovo in 1317, inflicted on Yuri a humiliating defeat and even took his Tatar wife prisoner. Both Russian dukes were ordered to come to the Horde. A run of bad luck continued for Michael. The sudden death of Yuri's wife in captivity, and an accusation of insubordination to the khan, carried the death penalty, and Michael was beheaded in 1318. Considering him a martyr, the Orthodox Church canonized him too. Internecine struggles continued, and Yuri's luck did not last long. Implicated of improprieties in the collection of tribute for the Tatars, he was deprived of the grand ducal yarlyk, which went to Michael's son Dimitri (1322-1324. Again both dukes were summoned to the Horde where, after heated incrimination, Dimitri assassinated Yurii. Avenging the death of this father. He was himself executed by the Tatars. Both were succeeded by their brothers: Dimitri by Alexander of Tver and Yurii by Ivan. When in 1327 the Khan's first cousin Chol-Khan was assassinated in Tver and a rebellion erupted there, Alexander fled to Pskov to escape a punitive Tatar expedition, which was headed by none other than his cousin Ivan I. Tver, was pillaged and many of its citizens massacred, and Ivan became the Grand Duke of Vladimir.\n\nIvan I Kalita.\n\nIvan I (1325-1340) was nicknamed \"Kalita\" by the people (Moneybag) for the bag he always carried with him. He was clever and rich, and a skilled collector both of taxes from the people and of duties from domestic and foreign merchants, who increasingly used Moscow as a transit city and later as a trade center. The process of unification of the country becomes visible from the end of the 13th century. In the beginning of the 14th there are only two rival principalities, almost of equal strength vying for domination: Moscow and Tver. They fought also for inheritance of the principality of Vladimir. Although Tver was favored by the Golden Horde, Ivan Kalita proved to be very capable diplomat and stubborn leader. He became the Khan's trusted agent for collecting tribute, which he extracted pitilessly from his own people. A persistent and canny man, Kalita managed, in most cases, to get what he wanted from the Golden Horde. Helped by the Khan, he got rid of his local enemies, or forced them to accept his rule. Slowly but steadily the importance of Moscow kept growing. Kalita made an important move to strengthen Moscow's primacy when he induced the archbishop Peter to move his see from Vladimir to Moscow. This coincides with the appearance of the new title for the archbishop as the primate of :All Russia.\" Kalita also held the title of \"Grand Duke of All Rus' (the name of ancient Russia), and chose Moscow to be capital city, thus marking its beginning as the capital of all Russia.\n\nTo replace Metropolitan Peter, who died in Moscow in 1325, as the head of the Russian see, the Patriarch of Constantinople sent Theognostus (Geognost), a Greek prelate. Since Kalita was already Grand Duke, Theognostus went directly to Moscow which thus became the official ecclesiastical capital of \"All Rus'.\" The humiliated Russian people who suffered morally and physically more than anybody else, saw in this a new spark of freedom and were primed to rise up and fight the invaders.\n\nDuring his reign Kalita enlarged the size of the Kremlin and built a new wooden wall around it. A thrifty ruler, he spent little money on stone constructions, which were very expensive at that time. He, as well as other grand dukes, preferred to use more inexpensive wood, which in turn burned very easily; this is why no architectural monument belonging to Moscow's early history has survived. In 1325, on the insistence of Metropolitan Peter, an icon painter himself, who was greatly interested in the cultural development of Moscow, Kalita laid the foundations for the first stone church in the Kremlin, the Cathedral of the Assumption, but it collapsed before it was finished. He had better luck when construction resumed in 1336, but by that time the Kremlin already had its first stone church, the Cathedral of Archangel Michael, built in 1333. The churches of Vladimir, Suzdal and Novgorod from which the young Moscow drew all that was best for its cultural development, served as models for the two cathedrals. By 1343 the interior of the Archangel Michael cathedral was covered with frescoes, painted by the Russian iconographers Zakhari, Denisei, Nicholas and others. In the same year Metropolitan Theognostus commissioned Greek artists to cover the Church of the Virgin with frescoes. Soon after this Moscow started using its own builders and painters for some works. When a lime stone quarry was discovered near the village of Myachkovo, some twelve miles from Moscow, it was an incentive for stone construction within the Kremlin. The stone, though relatively soft, proved resistant to the severe Russian winters because it is very porous and permits water to run out easily before it freezes. Its whiteness gave rise to the name \"white stone Moscow\" for the Kremlin and the area around it, where gradually stone construction prevailed. This term also originally indicated the tsar's part of the city, as distinguished from the rest, where wood remained for many years the only building material. Later, hundreds of churches throughout Russia were built with lime stone for it served just as well for ornamentation of brick constructions. Some of them are over five centuries old, and still in very good shape.\n\nDmitrii Ivanovich (Donskoi)\n\nWhen Dimitri Ivanovich Donskoi (1359-1389) succeeded his father to the Moscow throne he was still a minor. Fortunately his regent, who governed the country for a while during very difficult times, was the very patriotic, capable and unselfish Metropolitan Alexis (Alexei, 1354-1378). Later canonized by the Orthodox Church, he became one of the most venerated Russian saints. He was known for his close identification of the interests of the Orthodox Church with those of the Moscow secular power, and probably this contributed to the success of Moscow in the struggle against Tatar domination and in its endeavor to bring all Russian lands under the leadership of the new grand duchy. Saint Alexei himself came from an old boyar family named Biakont, from Moscow, and this detail helped him rally the support of the boyars in his policy of strengthening the position of Dimitri Donskoi. His influence over the Tatars was also considerable, particularly after he, as the legend says, miraculously healed the wife of Khan Chanibek.\n\nAfter the devastating fire of 1365 that almost wiped out Moscow and the Kremlin, Dimitri Donskoi decided in 1367 to replace the wooden fence around the Kremlin with stone walls and towers, with iron gates at the entrances, to strengthen the defenses of his capital. Russians often use the term \"stone\" in construction terminology as opposed to \"wood,\" and also for an object made of bricks or bricks and stone, which is usually called stone. This applies to the Kremlin's first \"stone wall\" of 1367. The stones used for building it must have been of a poor quality because the wall started to crumble not even a century after its construction. Used to wood construction, Russian builders lacked experience in stone building; several objects in the Kremlin later had to be rebuilt.\n\nDimitri Donskoi's primary aim was the emancipation of Russian lands from the Golden Horde, and his endeavors in this direction were at times partly successful in their unification under Moscow leadership. To bolster his personal prestige Dimitri abolished the title and the function of \"Tisatskii,\". This was the leader of the 'thousand' in other words the city militia. They were chosen by the people to prevent rulers from taking much power into their hands. Ivan Veliaminov was the last Moscow Tisatskii. His opposition to Dimitri cost him his life in 1378.\n\nKulikovo Battle.\n\nThe battle of 1380 at the Kulikovo field, marked an important victory by the Russians over the Tatars, and was one of the most decisive moments in Russian history, bringing confidence to the people and helping them to regain their independence. It also marked the beginning of a renaissance in the arts and a revival in all aspects of life.\n\nDimitri Donskoi showed interest in monumental architecture. During his reign several monasteries were built, among which the most important were Chudov, Spaso-Androniev, Nikolougreshsky, Simonov and the Voznesensky and the (Ascension) convent, founded by his wife Yevdokia in 1387 in the Kremlin. Yevdokia was a daughter of Suzdal's Prince Dimitri Constantinovich, himself also a very religious man. The Ascension convent had its own cathedral of the same name. Here Yevdokia took the veil in 1407, and was buried when she died. The cathedral has since become the burial place for grand duchesses and, later, for tsarinas. The Ascension convent was demolished in 1928 and some royal remains moved to the basement of the building next to the Archangel's cathedral. During the transfer of the body of Martha Sobakina, the third wife of Ivan the Terrible, the workers noticed that she was excellently preserved and almost looked to be merely sleeping. Martha, an exceptionally beautiful girl, was chosen by the tsar from among some two thousand contestants who were brought to Alexandrovo, where the tsar moved at the height of the oprichnina in 1571. Martha mysteriously died after being married to Ivan only fifteen days. Only through the carelessness of the archaeologists was Martha's body not preserved or even photographed.\n\nChurch of the Raising of Lazarus.\n\nThe oldest architectural monument in Moscow that has reached us is the Church of the raising of Lazarus in the Kremlin, located under the Church of the Nativity of the Virgin. It was built by Yevdokia in 1397 but was later sealed on all sides by stone walls and for centuries completely forgotten. The chronicles are silent about the church for the duration of 200 years. It was discovered by workers in 1842 when the ground floor of the Terem Palace was under repair, a wall was torn down and to their surprise there was the darkened arches of the Church of the raising of Lazarus supported by two thick pillars, the apse where the altar was, with three narrow windows (v' polukruzhii gornyago mesta, s prestolom I chetvernnikom,) made from heavy bricks. At the behest of his highness Emperor Nicholas Pavlovich, the church was restored to its past glory to which it had been constructed 450 years before. In the church on the wall of the arch, there is an ancient depiction of God's Angel with the inscription: \"The Lord's angel heralds the earthly dwellers.\" In one of the pillars of this church there is a nook in the shape of a niche for a prince's privacy. During construction of the emperors palace, under the church in the ground, human bones were found which proves that this church, prior to the construction of the Ascension monastery was a burial place for princesses; and adjacent to the Terem.\n\nChurch of the Nativity of the Virgin.\n\nTo commemorate the victory of her husband over the Tatars at the Kulikovo field, Yevdokia built in the Kremlin on the spot of the old wooden Church the Raising of Lazarus, the Church of the Nativity of the Virgin, (chto na Senyakh), in 1393. Two years later Theophan the Greek was invited to Moscow to paint the icons for its iconostasis and to decorate the church. He has already gained fame and it was not surprising that Moscow wanted him to decorate or repaint the old Kremlin's churches. It should be noted that it existed at that time not on the second floor as the Terem ( upper living quarters of the tsar' family) as it is today, but down below. The Church of the Nativity burned to the ground in 1473, together with the icons painted by Theophan, and the vaults collapsed. At the time of the reign of Ivan III the Terem buildings were re-built and raised one story higher, and in 1514 grand duke Vassili III ordered Alevis' Friazin (the Russian name given to Italians), to erect the presently standing church of the Nativity of the Virgin but now on the upper level. The Chronicle also records that in 1399 Theophan repainted the frescoes of the old cathedral of the Archangel Michael, also in the Kremlin, built by Ivan Kalita. First damaged by lightning and whirlwind in later Theophan's frescoes perished in the fire that swept through the cathedral in 1475. A new cathedral was built by Alevis' Novi in 1505-1509.\n\nIncreased concern for the churches was not limited to Moscow. It was under Dimitri that the old cathedral of the Assumption in Vladimir was also restored, probably for the first time since its reconstruction by Vsyevolod in 1183.\n\nVasilii I\n\nThe interest in preservation and restoration of ancient churches was even greater under Vasilii I (1389-1425). His mother, as we have seen, was also greatly interested in the restorations. Religious fervor also was on the increase; in fact, when in 1395, the Mongol conqueror Tamerlane invaded Russia, church dignitaries hurriedly brought from Vladimir to Moscow the famous icon, the \"virgin of Vladimir.\" A mass was held at the Kuchkovo field, where the icon was met by the people. A holiday to mark the date, the Meeting of the Virgin (Sretenie), was established; later, on the same spot where the icon was met, a new monastery (Sretenski) was built. We do not know what prompted Tamerlane to turn back, but the Russians believed for centuries that God heard their prayers and stopped the invader before he reached Moscow.\n\nIn 1404 Grand Duke Vasilii commissioned a Serbian monk from Mount Athos to build the first striking clock in the Kremlin. According to the Chronicle the clock did not have figures but letters written on the rim, which turned around instead of hands. Lazarus (Lazar) was the name of the inventive monk, who also constructed a bell and a mechanical map for the clock. Each hour on the hour the rim moved one twelfth of the semi-circle and the mechanical man hit the bell with the hammer that he held in his hands. There were daily and night hours, the first beginning with the sunrise, and the hours of sunrise and sunset were reset each fortnight. The clock was a great wonder to Muscovites, who could not understand how the mechanical man could be so precise, and do his job without being told or pushed by anybody. Then it was agreed that the gadget was \"somehow the product of man's dexterity and governed by his wits.\" Before he left Moscow, Lazarus trained a Russian watchmaker to service the clock and twice a month to make the necessary time adjustments.\n\nIn 1397 Grand Duke Vasilii Dimitrieveich laid the foundation of the new wooden Church of the Annunciation in the Moscow Kremlin, which he meant to serve as his private family chapel. The chronicle says that in 1405 the following artists took part in painting of the icons for the iconostasis: Theophan, the Greek iconographer, Prokhor, the old man from Gorodets, and the monk (chernets) Andrei Rublev. This was the first time that the name of Rublev was mentioned: Nobody could have guessed, not even Vasilii, that together with Theophan, Prokor and Daniil Chernii, the simple monk was about to start the greatest period of Russian iconography, create the classic form of the iconostasis and become the founder of the Moscow school of painting.\n\nAndrei Rublev\n\nThere is very little information about the man who is by now generally accepted as the greatest Russian painter. The mystery obscures his origins, date and place of birth, his family, education, etc. His birth is variously dated between 1360 and 1370, and we only know for sure that he died in 1430 and was buried inside the Andronikov monastery in Moscow. His family name is Russian and quite common, particularly in and around Moscow. There is a village Rublevo to the west of Moscow just behind the outermost highway circle. In all probability Rublev joined the orders at the Andronikov Monastery, where he learned icon painting. According to some sources his teacher was the monk Daniil Chernii. They became close friends and worked together most of the time.\n\nAndronikov Monastery\n\nThe monastery was founded by Moscow Metropolitan Saint Alexis in 1360, but received its name from its first abbot, Andronik, a follower and pupil of Saint Sergius. Rublev's popularity grew rapidly and invitations to work came from several places. Grand Duke Vasilii was one of the first to appreciate his way of painting, and when the time came to decorate his private chapel,. Rublev's name was one of the three top painters. The Chronicle mentions his name only twice to say a few words about him in biographies of prominent clergymen who knew him. They say the most about a particular church that he decorated, but with the exception of the \"Trinity\" icon, they never specified actual works. Since his name is mentioned with other iconographers, they obviously worked as a team; but some Soviet art critics doubtfully ascribe certain icons in the iconostasis of the Cathedral of the Annunciation to Theophan the Greek and certain to Rublev, leaving the elder Prokhor almost completely out.\n\nIt is more or less accepted practice to ascribe to Theophan the three most important icons from the Deisus Chin, namely, Christ, the Virgin and Saint John, and to Rublev several icons from the \"Holiday\" tier, such as the \"Annunciation, the Nativity, the Transfiguration, etc. There is no doubt that at that time Theophan was Russia's top artist, and it would be normal for him to have dominated the scene and reserved for himself the most important icons of the Deisus tier. Regardless who painted what, the iconostasis of the cathedral of Annunciation, and particularly its \"Deisus Tier,\" is a superb collection of beautiful icons. Though each one shows only the figure of a saint, as an entity they show a very festive and masterfully done composition.\n\nCathedral of the Annunciation\n\nIvan III, already a powerful ruler with vast aspirations, considered the church too modest for him, and in 1484 ordered that it be pulled down and a new Cathedral of the Annunciation built on the same site. Soviet scholars claim that some of the icons from the original iconostasis, painted by Theophan and Rublev, were preserved, and there is no reason to question their assumption. The old church was pulled down, and destroyed by fire in 1548, and traditional Orthodox custom forbids the destruction of icons. On the contrary, the older the icon the more it is venerated, and both Theophan and Rublev were well known that hardly anybody would consciously destroy their works. In similar cases it would be normal to use old icons, repainted or as is, for the new iconostasis or simply to transfer the entire old iconostasis into the new church. In either case it is the icons that count, and not the frame of the iconostasis. The Chronicle for 1547 notes that Rublev's icon \"Deisus\" was destroyed in the fire. There is no record of any other \"Deisus\" that could have burned than the one painted by or with Theophan for the old iconostasis. The logical assumption is that old icons were incorporated into the new church iconostasis, and that only \"Deisus\" burned and not necessarily the other icons. Besides all this, some of the icons that we see today in the Cathedral of the Assumption are such extraordinary examples of Russian iconography that only great masters could have painted them, and at that time there were no masters other than the three that we have named: Theophan, Rublev and Prokhor.\n\nTheir three-tiered iconostasis: \"Local,\" \"Deisus,\" and \"Holiday\" tiers in the Church of the Annunciation, with specifically arranged icons in each tier, is the first known of its kind, and it is possible that this very iconostasis marked the beginning of what has become known as the Russian classic iconostasis.\n\nCathedral of the Assumption in Vladimir\n\nIn May of 1408 the Chronicle records that Monks Daniil and Andrei Rublev started redecorating the interior of the big stone Cathedral of the Assumption in Vladimir; which had recently been ransacked by the Tatars' Khan Edigei who passed through Vladimir on his way to besiege Moscow and exact tribute. We know that the Cathedral was built in the 12th century by Prince Andrei and rebuilt and enlarge by his brother Vsyevolod after a fire destroyed it in 1183. The two iconographers were chosen and commissioned by the Grand Duke Vassilii, who must had been satisfied with their work on his private chapel in the Kremlin, and decided to send them to Vladimir. Fragments of Rublev's frescoes on the western wall of the Cathedral were discovered in 1859. They were part of a large fresco representing the Last Judgement that covered the entire wall.\n\nArt historians and critics seldom mention Daniil, as if he had done nothing. They tend to forget that his name was mentioned first in the Chronicles probably because of his seniority, and the fact is that he must have painted a sizeable portion of the frescoes and icons that are rather hurriedly ascribed to Rublev. Discovered fragments remained more or less intact until 1880 when an untalented iconographer, Safonov, instead of simply cleaning them and protecting them from deterioration, for three years redrew over the originals and covered a large part of the old frescoes with his own colors. Thus beautiful frescoes painted with rich colors and delicate lines, were turned, according to P. Muratov and practically all other critics, into \"Dull colors and dry contours.\" Soviet restorers partially succeeded in remedying the damage done by Safonov. In their work they also discovered and cleaned additional fragments of the old frescoes. What we see today in the Cathedral is as close to the original Rublev's and Daniil's paintings as could be expected under the circumstances.\n\nWhile in Vladimir Rublev and Daniil also painted another, fourth, tier of icons, the \"Prophets,\" in the Cathedral of the Assumption. The entire iconostasis was removed from the Cathedral in 1773 and replaced with a new gilded one which was offered by Catherine II. According to Soviet sources, Rublev's old iconostasis was found in the church of the nearby village of Vasilevskoe. The icons were cleaned and restored; some of them are now in the Tretiakov Gallery in Moscow, and some in the Russian Museum in St Petersburg. The question of their authorship should remain open in the absence of more positive proof. Perhaps they were painted later by some of the many who followed Rublev' style.\n\nCathedral of the Assumption in Zvenigorod\n\nAbout fifty miles west of Moscow is the town of Zvenigorod, the ancient capital of Zvenigorod princes. After the death of Dimitri Donskoi this territory went to the youngest of his four sons, Yurii. Here in 1396-1399 on a hill above the river Moskva, which dominates the valley, Yurii built the Cathedral of the Assumption. The entire spot was a outpost fortified by a wall, and the bells of the Cathedral served to warn Moscow of the approach of invaders. Presumably this was the reason that the nearby town was named Zvenigorod - the town of bell ringing.\n\nAbout a mile from the Cathedral is the Savior in Storozhevski Monastery, founded at the end of the 14th century by Saint Savva, a follower of Saint Sergius, whom Prince Yurii chose as his confessor. The name of the Monastery comes from the founder and the hill, \"Strorozha,\" on which it was built. The Prince helped Saint Savva build his first wooden church, followed in 1405-1407 by the new stone Cathedral of the Nativity of the Virgin (Rozhdestvo Bogomatery). Both cathedrals are fine examples of Vladimir-Suzdal architecture, with a single cupola that rests on four pillars.\n\nMost probably the same builders constructed them. The fame of the new monastery grew rapidly, primarily because of miracles that were ascribed to its founder. Here also the entire territory of the monastery was fortified by a wall. Several tsars and members of their families visited the Monastery and made large donations. Pious Tsar Alexei was often there, and even built a new stone wall around the Monastery. Around the middle of the 17th century the monastery received its new bell-tower, for which the founder, Alexander Grigoriev, made a thirty-five ton bell, famous for its beautiful tone. Shaliapin went to Zvenigorod to hear it and was delighted.\n\nWhen the revolution started in 1917, the monks refused to cooperate with the Bolsheviks. The following year the Monastery was first ransacked and pillaged, including the tomb of Saint Savva, made of gold plated silver, then the monks were chased out and finally the cathedral was left to ruin. Both cathedrals were entirely covered with frescoes and until the revolution had five-tiered iconostasis. Presently only a few fragments of the original frescoes remain. When, after the revolution, some artists visited Zvenigorod, they found several beautiful icons not far from the Cathedral under a heap of firewood used to protect them from laying directly on the wet ground. Three icons salvaged from here, the Deisus, Apostle Paul and Archangel Michael, were cleaned and are now in the Tretiakov Gallery in Moscow. After being examined by Soviet art students, and without any proof that Rublev made a journey to Zvenigorod, the three icons and the fragments of the frescoes were declared to have been painted by the great Russian iconographer sometime between 1408 and 1412. The icons are now called \"Rublev's Zvenigorod Chin.\" The figure of Christ departs slightly from the traditional way artists paint his face, and slightly resembles a Russian man. These icons too are masterfully executed and their color scheme resembles Rublev's.\n\nTrinity Icon.\n\nThere is one detail regarding Rublev on which everybody agrees, that is, that he painted the famous icon \"Trinity\" (Troitsa), the finest masterpiece of Russian painting. The icon depicts the biblical story of the visit of the three angels to Abraham and Sarah. The Old Testament Trinity was always the symbol of the Church unity and a popular subject in religious painting. The picture shows the three angels sitting around a table, on which we see in the middle the sacrificial chalice. The entire composition is executed with exceptional tenderness and love, portraying the readiness of the angels to offer their lives for man's salvation. Delicate lines gracefully contour the angels. Their bent heads and bodies form a harmonious silhouette, strongly expressing their unity of endeavor. Their faces transmit solemnity and peace. Soft, fresh, almost transparent colors of golden pink, pale green, cherry red, blues, warm grays and straw yellows intermix harmoniously. This is indeed a great painting.\n\nThe icon was commissioned by the Abbot of the Trinity and Saint Sergius Monastery, Reverend Nikon, who succeeded Saint Sergius in 1392. Nikon is shown as an art-minded man who wanted Rublev to paint the \"Trinity Icon\" as a praise to father Sergius and as the best way to show Saint Sergius' ideal of unity among Russian princes as the only way to free themselves from Tatar domination. Rublev, obviously, fulfilled the request with great mastership and love, producing his best work. Rublev's \"Trinity\" became one of the most venerated icons, and was almost covered with gold, silver and precious stones. Whoever came to the Monastery to see it and pray in front of it, tsar or peasant, left his donation, a flower, half penny or an expensive diamond. This was the custom.\n\nIn 1904 Church authorities decided to clean the old icons in the Cathedral of the Monastery. An experienced icon painter, V.P. Gryanov was entrusted for the job. When he removed the golden trappings and jewels from Rublev's \"Trinity\" he was shocked to see that it differed very little from many icons painted by Palekh iconographers. His disappointment did not last long: The real Rublev was on some parts of the icon under several layers painted over the original. Guryanov cleaned most of the icon but not all of it and, for the first time after five centuries, the real Rublev's painting was visible. Its effect was tremendous, but most of those who saw it were surprised; even among the top art authorities very few expected Rublev to paint the way he did, Guryanov too in the beginning found that his style was \"Greek.\" After the Revolution the icon was taken from the Monastery, cleaned completely where Guryanov had missed and also of his own retouchings; it is now on display in the Tretiakov Gallery in Moscow. A copy was made and sent to the Monastery, to fill the empty space left when the original was removed. There is another reproduction, painted in the sixties, in Rublev's Museum in the Andronikov Monastery. It was so perfectly done that if the original was put side by side with the copy it would be difficult to distinguish one from the other.\n\nSt. Sergius Radonezh\n\nSaint Sergius (Sergei Radonezhski) (1314-1392) was a young nobleman who renounced his title and wealth to become a simple Russian monk. He dedicated his life to bringing unity among Russian princes and helping Moscow to lead the fight for the liberation of the country from Tatar rule. His father, boyar Kirill (Cyrill), was one of the first to side with Ivan Kalita in his efforts to put an end to internecine struggles. To demonstrate his preferences, he even moved from Rostov to Moscow, sometime around 1330. Ten years later his son, then already monk Sergius, went about forty miles east from Moscow, and there, by himself, built a little wooden church, on a hill in the woods and dedicated it to the Trinity, the symbol of unity. This was the first of many monasteries that Saint Sergius founded or helped establish. He clearly saw that many monasteries, built throughout the country, far from administrative centers, not only could serve as religious centers but also as strongholds in the future battles against Tatars, which he knew were bound to come.\n\nThe developments that followed proved him right. Around monasteries mushroomed new settlements and villages, and their population rapidly increased. The monastery that Saint Sergius founded became one of the strongest military fortifications in Russia, and at the same time the most important religious center. Word of the virtues and piety of Saint Sergius spread throughout the country and attracted many monks. His disciples later founded new monasteries and kept his teachings and ideas alive, and the movement indeed became national. The esteem he enjoyed among the people helped him to induce several Russian princes to try to throw off the Tatars' suzerainty. At the same time he raised the hopes of the people and gave them much-needed encouragement to begin the fight. He inspired and convinced the hesitant Grand Duke Dimitri Donskoi to go and face the Tatars. The Chronicle says that Saint Sergius told Dimitri: \"The moment has come to show the enemy the strength of your kingdom with the sword.\" He blessed the Grand Duke and Russian units before they marched south to the Kulikovo field and the river Vozha, where in 1380 they gained their first victory over the Tatars, a battle which played an enormous role in the history of the nation.\n\nDefeated Khan Mamai was soon chased out of the Golden Horde by Khan Tokhtamysh, the ruler of the White Horde, who already, in 1382, on his way to Moscow, had destroyed and burned several Russian towns, as well as Saint Sergius' Monastery. Legend says that when the Tatars left the Monastery, Nikon, who succeeded Saint Sergius as Abbot, found the body of the Saint, who had been dead for several months, almost intact. Nikon decided to build a new stone church where the first wooden church, built by Saint Sergius had stood, and to bury his remains there.\n\nTrinity Cathedral\n\nThe small, modest, single-domed, four-pillared Trinity Cathedral was finished in 1422. Originally it was a fine example of the early Moscow version of the Vladimir-Suzdal architecture. It was later deformed with annexed chapels, Nikon's in 1548 on the south side and a four-sloped roof that covered almost one third of the drum. As the result of the alterations, the silhouette of the church considerably changed. To decorate it, Nikon invited Rublev and Daniil, who covered the inside walls entirely with frescoes. When this happened is not known, but it must have been sometime between 1422 and 1427.\n\nAbout two centuries later, the original frescoes were in very poor condition, and the Monastery authorities decided to repaint them entirely. The frescoes were renewed again on several occasions and in 1855 painted over with oil colors. There are only a few fragments and contours, of the original Rublev's and Daniil's designs that survive. The icons painted by the two masters and their assistants for the iconostasis of the Trinity Cathedral had better luck. Here also Rublev added a fourth tier, \"The Prophets,\" to the iconostasis. The fifth tier, \"The Forefathers,\" was added not long after by Rublev's followers, making the iconostasis of the Trinity Cathedral the only one which dates from the 15th century that has not been changed since then, with the exception of a few icons that had been replaced with later copies, without change of subject, as with the \"Trinity\" icon. It is commonly accepted that the \"Deisus\" tier icons were painted by Rublev and Daniil, others by their pupils, and certain icons by Dionisii, Ushakov and others. In all it is a remarkable collection of beautiful icons, which shows Russian iconography through three centuries, 15th through 17th.\n\nTo the right of the iconostasis is a double silver sarcophagus, containing the remains of Saint Sergius. The inside of the sarcophagus was a gift of Tsar Ivan Vasilievich, and the outside a gift of Empress Anna Ivanovna. Prayers at the sarcophagus are offered, continuously, day and night, with a monk on duty who conducts the service.\n\nTrinity, St Sergius Lavra\n\nIn 1919 as part of their anti-religious propaganda the Bolsheviks desecrated the remains of Saint Sergius by opening the sarcophagus so that the public could see \"The Saint,\" and filming the entire episode. When he heard about this, Lenin was very pleased and ordered that the film be shown in all movie theaters in Moscow and throughout the country, to show to the people \"...What kind of \"Saints\" have been kept in these rich sarcophaguses which for centuries they venerated...,\" expecting that it would alienate hundreds of thousands from religion. It is a pity Lenin cannot see himself in his own mausoleum. Another disrespect was shown to Saint Sergius and the Russian people humiliated when in 1930 the name of the town in which the Monastery is located was changed from Serghievo to Zagorsk. V. M. Zagorsk, Bolshevik party propagandist, happened to be in the premisses of the Moscow committee when in 1919 a counter-revolutionary threw a bomb. Twelve people were killed including Zagorsk, but only Zagorsk was remembered. Many Russians with whom I talked felt that out of thousands of towns, Serghievo was purposefully chosen to be renamed after a Jew, to debase the Orthodox Church and humble the Russian people. Zagorsk never had anything to do either with the town or with the Monastery, and to make the story even more ridiculous, his real name was not Zagorsk but Lubotzky.\n\nThroughout its long history, the Monastery played a very important role in the destiny of the Russian nation, and kept alive the tradition that Saint Sergius initiated. When a combined army of Poles and Lithuanians took Moscow, they knew that Russian resistance would continue unless the Monastery was captured and destroyed. An army of 15,000 soldiers was sent to take it, but the Monastery fought back repeated attacks, and endured a siege that lasted sixteen months. The defenders knew that the end of their resistance would mean the end of Russian independence. In January, 1610, the Poles abandoned the siege and two years later were chased out of Moscow.\n\nThere is hardly any Russian monarch who did not pay a visit to the monastery, some of them under special circumstances. Thus Vassilii II hid unsuccessfully in the Trinity Cathedral from Dimitri Shemiaka, his cousin and rival for the throne. When captured, Vassilii promised to renounce his claims and remain in the Monastery as a monk, but he was taken to Moscow and blinded. From this came his nickname Vasilii the Dark. Peter the Great was luckier. When streltsi came to the Monastery to search for him, he hid twice in the Cathedral of the Assumption, in 1682 and again in 1689, and both times was not found. When he became Tsar, Peter came back to the Monastery, but this time he was searching for a fugitive, his former brother-in law by his first wife Yevdokia, Prince Lopukhin. When he was told that Lopukhin had died as a monk, Peter ordered that his body be taken out of the tomb and beheaded. The Abbot refused to obey the Tsar's orders, reminded Peter of his own experience and the hospitality he had received in the Monastery and beseeched him not to desecrate the holy soil of the Monastery. A compromise was reached, and instead of chopping off the head of the dead man, the dale that covered his tomb was cut just at the place where his neck was supposed to be.\n\nThough primarily built to propagate Christianity, defend national aspirations and to a certain extent serve as outposts against enemy attacks, many Russian monasteries also became cradles of high intellectual and artistic life. If art and beauty had ever existed in ancient Russia, and to a considerable extent in the present Soviet Union, then they could be primarily found in the churches and monasteries which like jewels dotted the hills and valleys of the country. The Trinity - Saint Sergius Monastery has been the leader most of the time. For its contributions it received over two centuries ago the title of \"lavra\" - an honorable name for a highly distinguished monastery. There were only four lavras in all Russia out of over a thousand monasteries. Almost from the first days of its existence the Monastery concentrated its efforts on the propagation of literacy and handicrafts. Special attention was paid to the copying of books, and the first manuscripts appeared in the beginning of the 15th century. Some of them were decorated with interesting miniatures. The Monastery also had one of the first libraries and museums, which later became a very rich collection of various religious objects. After so many centuries, and regardless of anti-religious propaganda by the communist party and the government, thousands of Russians from all parts of the country continue to make their pilgrimage to the Monastery and bow to Saint \"Sergius's remains.\n\nBefore the revolution the Monastery's sacristy and treasury contained hundreds of sacred utensils, vestments and various objects that were donated to the Monastery, some of them of great artistic value. There was hardly any Russian tsar or tsarina who did not contribute something. Boris Godunov was particularly generous. The small Trinity Cathedral contained hundreds of pounds of silver and gold items. Hundreds of various precious stones were used to decorate the icons, the altar and Saint Sergius' sarcophagus. Many are not their any longer, and what was left is now in what is officially called \"The Zagorsk State Museum of Art and History.\" The Museum is still worth seeing, to get at least a notion of what existed there before 1917. Of particular interest are the collections of icons, needlework (which served either as cons or coffin covers and were in most cases made by tsarinas themselves) vestments, robes, miters, crosses and all sorts of religious utensils.\n\nThe legend says that Saint Sergius liked woodcarving and that he made toys for the peasant children of the nearby villages. Regardless of who was the first wood-carver, the fact is that many people in the region have since practiced this craft, which gradually turned the villages around the Monastery into the \"Center of Russian toy industry.\" Thousands of toys are produced there of all sorts, shapes and sizes. Very popular are horses that move on wheels, bears, rabbits, geese, scenes from Krilov's fables and many complicated gadgets. In most cases they are naively done, but it is their coloring and originality that makes them attractive, and few of them are of some artistic value.\n\nCathedral of the Savior\n\nIn the last few years of their lives Rublev and Daniil lived in the Andronikov Monastery. They returned to it to decorate the new stone Cathedral of the Savior, presumably built in 1420-1427. The Cathedral is one of the most remarkable monuments of Vladimir-Suzdal architecture of the 12th century. Several rows of \"Zakomar,\" with their pointed arches, arranged in receding and diminishing tiers, form a beautiful pyramid which supports a large, tall, single drum and a Byzantine-type cupola. The builder is unknown. Information about the iconographers who covered the entire inside walls with frescoes exists, though it will need further research and clarification as to the second artist who, together with Rublev, participated in the work. Pakhomii Lagofet, a Serbian monk who went to Russia sometime before the middle of the 15th century and became its first professional writer, speaks of Andrei the iconographer as the man who decorated the cathedral \"With his marvelous hands.\" However, Chety-Miney Chronicle, when it narrates the life of Saint Sergius, mentions that Andrei Rublev and Simeon Chernii painted the frescoes.\n\nThe question is: Who is Simeon? Some historians say he was Daniil's brother, the others would like to see that \"Simeon\" (Semen) is just a mistake made by the chronicler and that we have just one Chernii and not two. But the name Simeon was also mentioned among the painters who decorated the church of the Nativity in the Moscow Kremlin. So there would have to have been not one but two mistakes make by two different historians, and this makes the error look more improbable. Some Soviet authors went even further in complicating the conjectures about Simeon's mystery by simply assuming that the elder Prokhor from Gorodets is nobody else but Daniil Chernii, who changed his name to Daniil when he became a monk. The skeptics profited by the confusion of names to cast some doubts even about Rublev's existence. At any rate, the monk-painters never sought publicity, and probably not even thanks; they voluntarily withdrew from the world and Did not expect history to commemorate them.\n\nWe have no idea how the original frescoes in the Cathedral of the Savior looked. First, they were restored several times and completely destroyed during the final \"restoration\" in the last century. There are just a few very small ornamental fragments in the windows that survived and they are too small to help estimate the overall appearance. The Andronikov monastery was closed after the revolution and neglected for years. The churches of which there were seven prior to 1917, were turned into workshops or used for housing. Some of them were so dilapidated that they had to be torn down. Now most of the remaining buildings house the Museum of Ancient Russian Art, named after Andrei Rublev. The strange thing is that the exhibited icons come from various parts of the country, and none was painted by Rublev. There are a few copies of his works, including the very successful reproduction of his \"trinity\" icon. Of interest are several icons by unknown artists. Among them is \"The Virgin of Tikhvin,\" salvaged from the dilapidated monastery, which carried the same name and was located near the town of Tiknvin, once famous for its church builders and icon painters. The icon was painted in 1680. Around the Virgin and infant Christ there are twenty four \"Kleima\" - panels with individual pictures that show the major holidays and events in the history of the Monastery, from the building of the first wooden church to the defeat of the Swedish army which invaded the region in 1613. Rimsky-Korsakov lived for some time opposite the Monastery, which he often visited.\n\nBy the end of his life Andrei Rublev had become an esteemed artist and his icons and frescoes were highly praised by everybody. For almost two centuries they served as models to generations of Russian iconographers but Russian artists have never been able to repeat the beauty of his masterpieces. When in the middle of the 16th century the Stoglav Council was convened to denounce pagan tendencies in the old customs and beliefs, it recommended to the icon painters to take Rublev as example for their work. These facts speak strongly about the fine artistic taste that most of the high clergy and boyars had at that time. It is true that Lenin and the Bolsheviks picked Rublev too as a model for their socialist realism in art. In their ukhaz of July, 1918, Rublev was the first on the list of men declared meritorious and deserving of a monument erected in their honor. Since then Rublev has been accepted as painter-realist and advertised very much as such, particularly after the nineteen sixties when the Soviet government decided to let all Russian ancient art take its rightful place in the history of the cultural development of the people. However, its religious meaning has been completely eliminated, and today they speak of icons primarily as products of art. Surprisingly enough, quite often we learn now that another Rublev icon was discovered somewhere. From just a few before the revolution, by now their number has increased to over thirty. Not all precautions were taken in each instance, and if this trend continues, this case may become similar t those of Matisse and Renoir, and many other famous painters, who allegedly painted about five hundred paintings in their life-time, and yet just in the museums throughout the world there are over three thousand of their \"Original\" canvases.\n\nCULTURAL DEVELOPMENT DURING THE FORMATION OF THE UNIFIED RUSSIAN STATE (1460-1533)\n\nKiprian's Chronicle\n\nPolitical unification of Russian lands, under the grand dukes of Moscow, facilitated the establishment of close economic connections between former independent principalities, and made possible the formation of all of Russian literature and art. Hundreds of builders, craftsmen, and artists from all parts of the country came to Moscow to participate in the construction and embellishment of the new capital. Many foreigners came too, some invited, the others on their own. Increased contacts with the western worked and the Slavic peoples considerably influenced the new all-Russian cultural trend. Their literature, which consisted largely of translations, depended in the beginning on texts received from the South Slavs. The number of Russian educated men with some knowledge of western culture kept increasing, and the people as a whole, realizing that they spoke one language, began thinking of themselves as one nation. A new Russian culture started to appear. It continued to have its roots and to draw its sources from Kiev, Novgorod, Vladimir-Suzdal but, for the first time, it was conceived of on an all-Russian scale. The new unifying trend manifested itself even earlier, when the first Moscow Chronicle was written. It was initiated by Metropolitan Kiprian, who gathered most of the material for it. Under his direction the existing ancient chronicles and documents were compiled into a unified work which, could be considered the first written history of the entire Russian nation. It was completed in the first decade of the 15th century, already after the death of the Metropolitan. It became known also as Kiprian's Chronicle. Out of this intensive cultural activity came new literature and the Moscow School of Arts, the first to represent the entire Russian nation. All this could hardly have been possible if not for the interest and support given by the Moscow Grand Duke Ivan III. He liked power and splendor, and realized that by turning Moscow from an oversized wooden Russian village into an interesting town, and the Kremlin into a magnificent fortified city, he could enhance his prestige both at home and abroad. To become an absolute ruler of a great country was his aim, and he knew the value of power to achieve its. He was severe with his own brothers and merciless with all others, particularly with the boyars. The encounter with the Tatars came soon after he became Moscow Grand Duke ....\n\nIvan III (1462-1505)\n\nThe second half of the 15th century was the turning point for any military, cultural and political activities undertaken in Russia by its capable and ruthless ruler Ivan III (1462-1505). His success was facilitated by the intestinal fights between Mongol khans which resulted that once powerful Golden Horde was now broken into several independent Khanate. Ivan III even had his Mongol vassal, the khan of Kasimov who entered his services and helped him repeatedly keep the reduced Golden Horde divided from the other khanates. The coalition of the khan of the Golden Horde, Ahmad, and the Polish and Lithuanian King, Casimir, aimed to force Ivan III to recognize Ahmad's suzerainty never materialized because Casimir had to rush his troops to the part of Ukraine which he controlled and which had been attacked by Ivan's ally the Crimean khan, Mengly-Geray. The two armies, Ivan's and Ahmad's never went into action. On the contrary they both hastily retreated from the two sides of Ugra river where they faced each other after Ivan's cavalry detachment raided Ahmad's harem near Saray. This rather curious, uncharacteristic event, which happened in 1480, represents historically the end of the Mongol yoke domination.\n\nWhen Tatar Khan sent a mission to Ivan III to collect tribute and, as was the custom, to invite the new Grand Duke to the Horde to receive the \"Yarlik,\" instead of complying with the Khan's wish, Ivan tore the \"Basma,\" (written credentials of the Khan's delegation) into pieces, and ordered all members killed with the exception of one, whom he let go back to tell the Khan what had happened and that \"The hen which used to lay golden eggs for the Tatars has died.\" In 1480 Tatars' domination was thrown off; Russia became an independent and powerful state with Moscow as its center.\n\nThe Mongol invasion of Russia, amongst other things, brought an end to the existence of \"Veche\" - the only democratic Russian form of government, in all central and southern principalities. However in Novgorod and Pskov and some other northern and western localities, Veche survived the Tatar invasion and functioned until these provinces were annexed forcefully to his realm . Ivan III, grand duke of Moscow, took advantage of the internal fights between various parties and of Novgorod's dependance on imported bread from the southern Russian provinces If appears that the unification of Russian principalities was possible only if imposed by a strong central hand. The representative of this new force was Ivan III and the system he introduced resembled the one which the Golden Horde practiced. The majority of Russian scholars call it Moscow autocracy. Under his rule the voice of the people was less and less heard and it disappeared completely when people acquired the habit to be governed without rasing its head and without questioning anything or anybody. It is also true that the primitive democracy, as practiced by the Veche could not last for ever.. New time need new forms of government preferably better, for the people but neither Ivan III nor his son made a great effort to find it, and Russians had to wait until \"Zemskii sobor\" came into existence.\n\nOn the local front Ivan III did very much to speed up the process of unification of the country. His expeditions, some of them punitive, put the end to Novgorod and Tver independence and both were annexed to Moscow. Many Novgorod boyars and rich merchants were simply executed and many more together with middle class families were deported to eastern parts of Russia and replaced by Muscovites. Their confiscated lands were turned over to new settlers conditionally, depending on the services they would render to the Grand Duke which, of course, further increased his authority. Speaking about the \"unification\" of Russian lands, both Lenin and Stalin praised Ivan for not delaying his actions. Ivan III also neglected the boyars. Most of Ivan's counselors and members of his government belonged to faithful to him families or individuals, the class which is known in Russia under the name of \"Dvorianstvo,\" which will continue to play an ever increasing role in the Russian history. In order to reward them for their services, Ivan III introduced a new system of military fiefs (pomestie). Of course many boyars also volunteered and took part in the government, but the majority became the first Russian opposition in the broad sense of the word.\n\nIvan III was married for the first time when he was only twelve. His bride Maria Borisovna, was the nine-year old daughter of the Prince of Tver. This political marriage, arranged by the parents, was intended to bring together the two powerful and important principalities. When the young couple grew-up they had one son who was also baptized Ivan Ivanovich. Maria died suddenly in 1467. To make sure that the son, tsarevich Ivan, would succeed to the Moscow throne, and thus that the principle of primogeniture would be preserved, Ivan III named his son Grand Duke and ordered that in all official documents both names appear, one next to the other. This did not last long, for in 1490? The son also died and left an infant child Dimitri. The father, Ivan III was already married to his second wife Princess Zoe Paleologue, daughter of the brother of the last Byzantine Emperor. Her family moved to Rome after the fall of Constantinople, where the former Byzantine princess, a contemporary of Leonardo Da Vinci and Bramante, received an excellent education. In Italy the Renaissance was already in full swing. Ivan III and Zoe married in 1472, and she officially became Grand Duchess Sophia Fominichna. This marriage with one of the Paleologues marked the beginning of Moscow's ambition to replace the defunct Byzantine empire.\n\nThe Pope blessed their union, in the hope that it would help the Catholic Church to establish some religious and eventually, political influence, in Russia. It did not work this way, though, and Sophia, though educated in Catholic schools, returned to her Orthodox faith. Ivan, however, took his new role seriously, and adopted the Byzantine coat of arms - the double headed black eagle as Russia's new emblem. Then he introduced the coronation ceremony for Grand Dukes. It was similar to the Byzantine ceremony, and was used later for the coronation of Russian tsars up to Peter the Great.\n\nThe crown of Vladimir Monomakh, (Shapka Monomakha), meaning cap allegedly received from Emperor Constantine, but actually looking very much like the caps of Tatar Khans, served to crown the head of each new ruler. The entire ceremony was performed for the first time in 1498, in the newly built cathedral of the Assumption in the Moscow Kremlin, after which Ivan III decided to \"crown\" his grandson Dimitri as his rightful successor. Fortune would soon abandon the tsarevich, when the grandfather started forgetting about the right of inheritance which he wanted so much to preserve before. In 1502 both Dimitri and his mother Helen were put under house arrest. This change of heart was not without Sophia's's back-stage interference. She found that her eldest son by Ivan, Gabriel (Gavril), had more right to succeed the father than the grand-son Dimitri. Despite the opposition of several influential boyars, some of whom were liquidated or forced to enter monasteries, Gabriel, the future Vasili III, was proclaimed heir to Moscow's throne. Dimitri and his mother died in prison in 1509.\n\nThe complete insecurity and exasperation of occupation by Tatars, prompted many to look for \"Uteshenie\" in the monastical life where one worked and meditated. In the 14th and the 15th centuries many new monasteries were opened and they became the only source of knowledge for all those who cherished literacy and books. Many chronicles and lives of the recent saints and prominent persons were recorded, and old chronicles compiled and many important books rewritten. Thanks to these monasteries some old books and chronicles were saved. Within their walls some rich people found shelter and offered all their fortunes to the monastery. This negatively reflected on the intellectual level of the monks, some of them spoiled by the rich life in the monastery. Later heated discussions took place regarding moral and judicial qualifications of the monasteries to possess big estates, fortunes and serfs. Amongst those who entered monasteries was boyar Vasili Ivanovich Patrikeev, better known as monk Vasian Kosoy, one of the leading Russian intellectuals of the time.\n\nLanguage and Literature.\n\nWithin some of the most prominent Greek and South Slav monasteries in Byzantium and at Mount Athos, a new mystic theory started to be shaped. Known under the name of \"Isikhiya,\" it propagated moral self-perfection which, if thoroughly and sincerely practiced, could bring the man during his life-time to total perfection, in other words it would enable him to become divine (bozhestvo), to achieve sainthood.)?) The followers of this new trend insisted that monks must not possess any valuable item or property, that they must work to feed themselves and not live from the work of somebody else, and that their prayers should not follow the ceremonial pattern but consecrate heir time to meditation and individual internal prayers. Most of them were too intellectuals within their monastery and as such they developed a very high literary style, especially when writing biographies of the saints. While the new approach to monastic life was debated chiefly between the two ardent and able opponents: The abbot Iosif of the famous Volokolamski Monastery, defending the official position of the church that monasteries are the main pillars of the state and as such must be assisted to survive, and Nil Sorski the head of ascetic monks, who left Kirillo-Beloserskii monastery, and went to Mount Athos where he learned about the mystic theory of :isikhiya\" and became its fervent supporter and propagator. A new style of writing was soon introduced to Russia and abundantly used in their literature until the end of the 16 The century. Cultural relations, and particularly literary exchanges, between the South Slavs and the Russians considerably expanded between the 11 The and the 16 The centuries. At the end of the 14 The century starts again a long period of particularly strong literary influence exercised by south Slavs, and especially by the Serbs, over the Russian literary life. Under Tsar Dushan Serbia got rid of Byzantine tutelage, became powerful country, spread its influence to the Mediterranean and Adriatic seas and got in touch with the western countries and their civilizations. Very progressive, as we would say today, Dushan did very much for the Serbian literature to achieve its golden age (renaissance). The greater part of newly translated books are of Serbian origin or retranslated from Serbian. The Russian authors or translators copy even the agyographic style, so typical of the Serbian 14th century literary works. The emerging new Russian center, Moscow, was particularly receptive to the Serbian influence. At that time all Orthodox Slavs and the Bulgarians shared just one literary language - the old church Slavic and just one alphabet, the Cyrillic. The ancient authors, Serbian or Russian, once they had written their work or had made a translation form a foreign non-Slavic language, it could be read in Kiev, Moscow or Serbia. It is not surprising the most of the literature of that time, was written in The same language over the entire Slavic Orthodox world. Two prominent men who played an important role in spreading Serbian influence and the new Style in Russia, and also whose works were amongst the most important Russian literary products of that period, were Kiprian and Logofet, both of Serbian origin.\n\nKiprian managed to become Russian archbishop as we have seen, but is better known as an author of dealing with the devastating consequences of the invasion by the Tatar and for writing the biography of the famous archbishop Peter, and for initiating and writing the first Moscow Chronicle which included also for the first time, all Russian lands. The latter gives the survey of all major events during the last hundred years from an outsiders and not the all-Russian point of view, and as such represents the history of Russia during that period. In the same chronicle archbishop Kiprian deals with some moral characteristics which adorn Russian rulers and recommends them to refrain from drinking alcoholic beverages.\n\nThings began to change when in the 16th century a national literary language appeared in Russia developing gradually from spoken dialects. With time the difference increased, and if we take into consideration the changes in the alphabets that also occurred during this period, we can speak today of different languages, Russian, Ukrainian, Serbian, etc. The flow of literature and art was mainly from the Balkans to Russia, but there were also a few instances in which Russian manuscripts found readers among the South Slavs. Some Russian biographies (zhitia) and stories about the life and work of saints, the chronicles, \"The Be' - a collection of sayings of proverbial nature, and some other works were recorded in the South Slavs' documents.\n\nThe writing of chronicles, as we know, was highly developed in ancient Russia and usually interestingly presented. The common ancestry, language and religion were sufficient to make them worthy of and pleasing for any Slavic reader. The invasion of the Balkans by the Turks, which threatened to completely annihilate the local population, resulted in migration of entire population of the provinces. The Serbs were hit hardest; their monasteries were ransacked or burned. Some Serbs went to Russia in search for new work and homes. In many instances they were learned monks, considered at that time to be highly educated, who specialized as writers, chroniclers, iconographers, miniaturists, craftsmen, etc. In the 15th century the writers brought to Russia changes in orthography and style which were enthusiastically accepted and introduced into the Russian written language, known as \"Poluustav,\" (Half-ustav). The ancient Russian chronicles were hand written with vertical and rather square letters, which looked much like printing. This manner of writing was called \"Ustav,\" the same word presently means regulations, or statutes, and the original \"Ustav\" was a set of regulations that governed the writing.\n\nPakhomii Logofet\n\nThe man who did the most to give Russian literature a new style was Pakhomii Logofet, also known a Pakhomii the Serb. Logofet was not his family name. It is most probably a nickname given to him because of his talents. In Byzantium \"Logofet\" was the name for the prime minister. He quit his native land and went to Russia around 1430, where he lived for over fifty years. During this long. this long and fruitful period Pakhomii produced over forty works, mostly \"Zhitia,\" in which he narrated the life and deeds of Russian saints, church or state dignitaries, among them Saints Sergius, Aleksei and Cyril (Belozersky), Prince Michael Chernigovskii, and others. Pakhomii traveled extensively through Russia, and lived in various localities, collecting documentation or interviewing those whom he was to write about or who lived or knew something about these personalities. Not everything in his works corresponded to historical fact, but Pakhomii should neither be blamed for these lapses, nor for his sometimes exaggerated poetic and panegyric style which delighted the Russians so much. They did not wait long to embrace Pakhomii's style which, despite so many \"Serbisms,\" had tremendously influenced the development of Russian literature.\n\nThe very first contacts with the west European literature were made when the novel about Alexander the Great was translated into Russian. The novel appeared under the name of \"Serbian Alexandria\" just because it was translated from the Serbian text. Although the original was written in Greek and in the typical Byzantine style, the translation was softened by stressing the love affairs between Alexander and Roxanna and by showing Alexander more as a western \"Ritsar') knight, a Christianized and ideal type of leader. Serbian Alexandria was what we would call the best seller for many years and remained one of the most popular books to be read even in the 17th century.\n\nAnother two popular translations which also reached Russia via Serbia were the oriental stories: The Tale of an Indian Kingdom and The Twelve Dreams of Cha-Hai-Shi. The fact that the Twelve Dreams which talks much about the disappearance and destruction of a country, reached Russia at the time when she was devastated and enslaved by the Mongols, made this book very popular. Ordinary people took it as granted that it was actually written about Russia and this new version reached orally the remotest villages. Its impact was tremendous and many later popular Russian tales were modeled on the Twelve dreams of Cha-Hai-Shi.\n\nDespite all these efforts the Russians were not a peoples to be so easily influenced. Most of the acts and official correspondence that sultans sent to Moscow\"s grand dukes were written in Serbian, which became for over a century the second most important language in the Turkish Empire, pushing Greek to third place despite a very large Greek minority.\n\n\"The Legend Of The Princes Of Vladimir.\"\n\nTowards the end of his life Pakhomii wrote his most important work, entitled \"The Legend of the Princes of Vladimir,\" in which he reviewed the life and genealogy of the world's greatest emperors and rulers, pharaohs included. Pakhomii found that Russian grand dukes were directly related to the first Roman emperor Augustus, and that as such they qualified to become a possible successors. Then, to make the entire picture more suitable for the occasion, he wrote that Byzantine Emperor Constantine had sent his crown of laurel and cape to the Grand Duke of Kiev, Vladimir Monomakh. In the Orthodox world, including Russia, Constantinople was considered to be \"New Rome.\" When the Turks ransacked the city and put an end to the existence of the Byzantine Empire, the temptation of power became great, and the grand dukes began to dream of the world-wide role that they eventually could play. The image Pakhomii constructed was intended to show, as he put it, the \"Future unbounded splendor of Moscow\" - the \"Third Rome.\" In his works Pakhomii called the Moscow Grand Duke \"Tsar and autocrat,\" and the Metropolitan Zosima regarded Ivan III the \"Sovereign and autocrat of all Russia,\" \"A new Tsar Constantine.\"\n\nPakhomii's discoveries found several practical applications during the reign of Ivan the Terrible. His tent-shaped throne for the Cathedral of the Assumption in the Kremlin was made in 1551 of finely carved walnut. Several receding tiers of kokoshniki and steep gables form the octagonal canopy (khatior) above the throne. It was named after Vladimir Monomakh because engraved reliefs depicted major events of this life. One of them shows how Monomakh's crown (Shapka Monomakha) reached Kiev from Constantinople, a detail clearly inspired by Pakhomii's \"Legend.\" Then in some official documents and letters sent to foreign kings Ivan IV found it necessary o remind them of this imperial ancestry by beginning them with: \"We , descendant of Augustus Caesar ...\"\n\nReconstruction of the Kremlin.\n\nConsiderably influenced by his western-educated wife Sophia, Ivan III decided to bring his country out of the \"Shades of dusk,\" as Karamzin put it and move it closer to European culture. Moscow opened its doors, and many Italians and Greeks, masters of various professions came to Russia with Sophia. Special attention was paid to The embellishment of the Kremlin, and construction begun on a series of magnificent churches and palaces and, of course, he new Kremlin walls, making it one of he most fortified cities in the world. With time the Kremlin turned into a superb architectural ensemble, destined to become the center not only of a large city but also of a vast empire. Ivan obviously wanted to make Moscow a beautiful capital, and probably harbored thoughts that it might one day become\" new Constantinople, \" and match the importance of his new, powerful state.\n\nThe Cathedral of the Assumption.\n\nIvan III was present when in 1472 two Russian builders from Pskov, Krivtsov and Mishkin laid down the first stones for the new cathedral of the Assumption, to re place the old one built in 1327. They worked for two years and had almost finished the job when, suddenly, the walls crumbled down. Some Soviet architects now blame the disaster on an earthquake, and on the poor quality of the mortar, which also had not had time to completely dry out and harden. The furious grand duke ordered that foreign architects be brought to Moscow to rebuild the cathedral. Italians were chosen, not without Sophia's suggestion, as the most suitable to finish the work. In Russia, Italy already had the reputation of being land of talented architects, painters and sculptors. A special mission headed by Boyar Tolbuzin went to Italy to search for the best architect.\n\nRidolfo Fiorvanti\n\nThe choice fell on Ridolfo Fioravanti, (1415-1486), an architect from Bologna, who agreed to go to the mysterious country for a salary of ten Rubles per month, equivalent at that time to the price of two pounds of silver. He arrived in Moscow in 1475 and was advised to visit first the city of Vladimir and several other places, including the charming little church on the Nerli, to familiarize himself with the best examples of Russian church architecture. He finished the new Kremlin cathedral in 1479, and left no doubt that he had instantly caught the Russian spirit and that the cathedral in Vladimir served as this main inspiration. The two cathedrals do resemble each other very much,, and at the consecration, Ivan III, the boyars, the church prelates and the people were delighted. The first \"Crowning\" ceremony that was held in the cathedral was when in 1498 Ivan III invested his grandson Dimitri as his crown prince. Later Ivan the Terrible chose to be crowned there as Russian tsar, establishing a custom for those to come. Some architects consider its plan and its basic features a harmonious combination of Renaissance and Russian traditional styles. The cathedral was built of white stone; it has high round pillars, cross shaped arches that carry five cupolas and by Russian standards, plenty of open space inside. The windows are narrow and placed relatively high. The walls are bare and decorated only with high pilasters and a band of blind ornamental arcatures. This rather laconic exterior sharply contrasts with the ostentatious interior with all walls covered entirely with frescoes. The cathedral was completely embellished for the first time in 1514, presumably by painters trained by Dionisii. With the exception of a few fragments in the chapel of the Virgin, all the original frescoes perished in the flames that so often swept though Moscow. Its first iconostasis, with icons painted, as the Chronicle says, by Dionisii the priest, Timophey Yarets and Konia, who probably did some wall painting too also disappeared.\n\nThere are several contradictory reports concerning the year they worked in the cathedral. When the vaults started cracking, tsar Mikhail Romanov ordered that all frescoes be repainted during the restoration. The best painters from all parts of the country were called to Moscow to participate in the work. Among them were two brothers from Pskov, Ivan and Boris Paisiin, Sidor Pospeev, Bazhen Savin and others, in all almost a hundred painters and assistants. It took them two years, 1642-1643, to repaint everything and cover almost fifty thousand square feet with pictures and gold background. They worked under the control of a special commission, headed by Boyar Boris Repnin, which took care that the new frescoes be as close to the originals as possible. But some forty rears later they were already damaged by fire, and damaged again when Napoleon took Moscow. In the last century they were repainted with oil colors. The first attempts to restore he original frescoes were made in the beginning of our century. This process of cleaning, refreshing and retouching was finished in 1950, and today they give us an idea how he empty cathedral originally looked. We say empty because the valuable things, and there were hundreds of them, were taken out during and after the revolution. The walls are covered with hundreds of silent and staring figures. Legend says that even Napoleon became frightened when he entered the cathedral in 1812. The very intricate composition of the last Judgement covers the entire west wall. The north wall shows scenes from the life of the Virgin, and the south, the seven councils of the Orthodox Church. In the window embrasures are the figures of Saint Vladimir and Saint Olga. Martyrs, angels, saints and other personages are painted on the round columns, each divided into five tiers. In the central cupola is a large image of God, in the other four we see Jesus, The Virgin Sabaoth and Emmanuel. .The iconostasis is one of the tallest in Russia. It has five tiers of icons and a silver royal door and was last renovated in the eighteen eighties. There was hardly any Moscow grand duke or tsar who did not contribute to it an icon. They were brought from Vladimir, Novgorod, Pskov and other cities; and some supposedly came from Constantinople. The most famous among them were the Virgin of Vladimir and \"Tsar Tsarem,\" allegedly painted by the first Russian iconographer Saint Alimpii. Many of the icons were framed in gold and adorned with precious stones. The most valuable were taken out and put into museums. The entire look of the iconostasis and the altar offered a fabulous, and in a way also barbaric, picture of hundreds of glistening diamonds, rubies, sapphires etc. There was said to be over five tons of gold in various items, decorations, frames etc in the cathedral. The disposition of icons in the iconostasis follows a certain order aimed to elucidate the idea of the universal church, namely the union of the Old and New Testaments. The icons in the first, top, tier shows God in the middle and the forefathers and patriarchs on his sides; in the second are prophets, from Moses to Christ, each holding in his hand a scroll containing his prophecy, and in the middle is the Virgin with the child Jesus, on her lap; the third, with usually the smallest icons, shows major church holidays and events; the fourth, illustrates the Christian church with Christ sitting on the throne in the center and the Virgin, Saint John and the apostles on his sides. The bottom row had the most venerated, and usually the most precious icons. The first, to the left of the Royal doors, was the Virgin of Vladimir, followed by the image of the Savior and the icon \"Tsar Tsarem.\" To the right, another Savior, sitting in his throne, the Assumption of the Virgin, allegedly painted by Metropolitan Peter, the Annunciation of the Virgin, and Saint Dimitri (Demetrius of Saloniki). There were several other old icons in the Cathedral, including the one depicting Emperor Constantine as Saint George. The legend says that it was given by the Pope to a Russian prince at the time when union with Rome was considered possible. As we know, Moscow Metropolitan Isidor was of Greek origin, and after attending the Eight church council at Florence in 1438 he had ordered that in the liturgy a short prayer be said for the life of the Pope and his name be mentioned. When in 1440 a papal bulletin was read in the cathedral of the Assumption in the presence of Vasili II, the grand duke jumped from his seat and accused Isidor of heresy and put him under house arrest in the nearby Chudov monastery. A few years later in 1488, the council of Russian prelates, independently from the Patriarch of Constantinople, chose the Bishop of Riazan Iona as the new Metropolitan of all Russia. Not long afterwards the Ukrainian Metropolitan of Kiev in his turn declared the Ukrainian Orthodox Church independent from Moscow.\n\nThe Cathedral of the Assumption in the Kremlin soon became the main sanctuary of Russia. Its architectural features, style, cupolas, iconostasis, practically everything, served as a model for hundreds of churches throughout the country. The square in front of it was named Cathedral square and became the heart of the Kremlin. Surrounded by two more cathedrals, a palace, a belfry and churches, it was there that coronations, processions and most of the festivities took place.\n\nRidolfo \"Aristotle\" Fioravanti was indeed a very gifted and versatile man. Besides teaching Russians how to make better bricks, how to use lime in construction and how to build solid stone churches, he taught them several other until then not well-known skills, such as how to cast big bells and cannons in molds. Amazed by Fioravanti's knowledge and obtrusiveness, the Russians nicknamed him Aristotle, after the famous Greek, considered to be the highest compliment that could be made to a scholar. Not only the people were pleased with Fioravanti; Ivan III liked him too and often consulted him. The ingenious Italian particularly impressed him with his masterly knowledge of how to cast big cannons, which Ivan needed so much both against the Tatars, Lithuanians and Swedes, and to put the still-independent Russian provinces under his rule. By 1479, Moscow already had its first artillery foundry, jokingly named \"cannon's izba,\" which produced the cannons to defeat Novgorod and other principalities, and the bells to greet the Moscow grand duke upon his return from his military campaigns. Before coming to Moscow, according to some sources, Fioravanti was involved in some affair with counterfeited papal money. The fact is that he knew how to mint coins and he helped Ivan's minters to improve their primitive methods and make better \"denga,\" at that time considered an important prerequisite to increasing and improving trade.\n\nCathedral of the Annunciation.\n\nThe construction of the cathedral of the Assumption was only the beginning of an unprecedented era of building and embellishment of the Kremlin that was launched by Ivan III. a new cathedral of the Annunciation was begun in 1484, to replace t he old one, built in 1397. Ivan gave the two Pskov builders, Krivtsov and Mishkin another chance; this time they were indeed successful. Instead of using semicircular \"Zakomari\" for the roof superstructure, they introduced (for the first time in Moscow architecture), corbeled arches arranged in receding tiers. The arches carry the drums and the cupolas, and the entire superstructure had an impressive pyramidal silhouette. The ogee-shaped arch became popular throughout Russia and found extensive use in decorative art. It became known in Russia as \"kokoshnik,\" a name primarily given to a woman's headdress, which is very similar in form to the kokoshnik that we often see in church architecture. Originally the cathedral had only three cupolas and an open gallery with a parvis around its three sides. A fire seriously damaged it in 1547. Under Ivan the Terrible it was reconstructed in 1562-1564; the cathedral received two more cupolas on the western side, the galleries were rebuilt and restored, and each corner was turned into a chapel with a cupola on it, to commemorate the four main Christian holidays. From the first days the cathedral served as a private family chapel for the grand dukes and later the tsars. Many members of the royal family were married or baptized in it. Without galleries, the cathedral is indeed small, just the size of an average chapel. The four square pillars that carry the superstructure are disproportionately large and take up quite a lot of space, much reducing the view of the iconostasis. The cathedral is connected to the palace through a special passage in its western side, leading to the gallery. Ivan the Terrible often attended services there and legend says that in 1584 he saw through the window a large comet which formed an enormous cross. He became frightened and exclaimed: \"This is the sign of my death.\"\n\nIn 1508 Feodosii, son of the well-known iconographer Dionisii, helped by several assistants, covered the entire cathedral with wall paintings. The question of who painted the frescoes in the four chapels and the galleries that were rebuilt in the time of Ivan the Terrible remains open. According to some art historians they were painted by Feodosii; others argue that they were the work of an unknown artist who painted them in 1547 after the fire. The main frescoes depict several subjects from the Apocalypse, and also Byzantine emperors and Russian princes, but together with saints on the walls of the galleries we see the figures of Aristotle, Ptomomei, Anaharis, Menandre, Senon, Plutarch and others. It is hard to accept that Feodosii or any other Russian iconographer would venture to introduce Greek philosophers so boldly in to the tsar's private chapel. Nevertheless, it did happen, and though the frescoes were renovated and repainted several times, the Greeks remained on the walls. This was an unusually liberal stand, taken by the Russian Church hierarchy.\n\nEach time a service is held in an Orthodox church a great many candles are lighted, while icon-lamps are supposed to burn continuously. The smoke they produce in a century or two is sufficient to cover the icons and the frescoes with soot and make them look dark. This is why at least cleaning if not renovation was necessary. We know that the cathedral of the Annunciation was entirely renovated in 1697 and 1770, and its frescoes have since been renewed in 1835 and 1882. An academic painter, V.D. Fartusov, was commissioned in 1882 to renew the frescoes in the parvis; his work soon stirred a controversy, followed by his dismissal and the apparent total loss of the original frescoes, and a mystery that may never be clarified. From the description that was published in 1909 by A.I. Uspensky we learn that after cleaning the sealing of the central cupola and the walls of the parvis, Fartusov found that they were covered with fine frescos of exceptional beauty and mastership. He reported his findings to the commission for protection of monuments. The members of the commission went to the cathedral to examine the old frescoes and to the astonishment of Fartusov and some other art students, reported to the president of the commission that the \"discovered frescoes did not at all resemble the accepted type of old Russian church wall paintings, and accused the restorer of altering them with his own drawings. Though Fartusov pleaded innocent and maintained that it would be impossible for him to produce such marvelous work, he was dismissed in 1885. However, before he left the cathedral he made some fifty photos of the discovered frescoes, which clearly show that only an experienced master familiar with western art, or else a foreigner, could have painted them. There are several details that speak for this conclusion, particularly the faces of the persons painted and the Roman noses which are especially visible on the fresco\"In Thee Rejoiceth.\" In the absence of specific information, some critics tend to assume that these particular frescoes were painted by a foreigner; there were many who came to Moscow after Fioraventi. They base their assumption on the fact that the great incendiary that ravaged Moscow and the Kremlin in 1547 also damaged the Cathedral of the Annunciation, and they conclude that many frescoes painted by Feodosiii perished at that time. Consequently, the frescoes that Fartusov discovered were painted after 1547. In support of this they add that here is clear indication that the impressive portals were built by an unknown Italian at the time of the construction of the galleries and the chapels. To \"restore the damage\" made by Fartusov, the commission picked Safonov, an awkward restorer who had already mishandled other master-pieces, and instructed him to replace the old with his own. He did it, fortunately, without destroying the old. In 1947 former Palekh iconographers cleaned and restored some of the frescoes. Additional work was done in 1961 and today we are assured that the frescoes we see in the cathedral of the Annunciation are those painted by Feodosii and his assistants. Needless to say, this cathedral also had many beautiful old icons, richly decorated with gold and precious tones; an exceptional collection of crosses that once hung around the necks of princes, grand dukes and tsars, including two gold crosses that allegedly belonged to Vladimir Monomakh; several extraordinary chasubles, real masterpieces of gold, silver and pearl embroidery, one of which had over forty pounds of pearls alone; and many religious objects. Of interest also is the floor of the cathedral, which was paved with slabs of jasper, agate and other colorful and semi-precious stones sent by the Shah of Persia as a gift to Tsar Aleksei Mikhailovich; and the beautiful crosses on the tip of each cupola in the form of a fine wrought iron tracery. As another mark of his victory over the Tatars, Ivan the Terrible ordered that a defeated crescent be put at the bottom of each cross. They are still there. Under Vassili III in 1508 not only the icons were covered with silver and fold repousse plates, but all the cupolas and the entire roof of the cathedral were gold plated. The work was done by the well-known silversmith Fyodor Yedikeev and his assistants. In 1963 the Soviet government ordered that the cupolas and the roof be regilded, so that now, indeed, they shine perhaps too much.\n\nThe Kremlin Walls and Towers.\n\nTo adequately protect the Kremlin against foreign invaders Ivan III needed, besides the cannons that Fioraventi made for him, new walls and fortifications to replace the old dilapidated ones which Dimitri Donskoy had built over a century before. Muscovites knew something about bricks before the arrival of Fioraventi. Their bricks were called \"Plinfa;\" they were of poor quality and crumbled easily. They were thin and their size was not suitable for solid constructions. Fioraventi found a good clay for bricks not far from the Andronikov monastery; the Russians readily followed his advice about how to mold them and harden them by fire, but refused to change their dimensions. This came considerably later. Fioraventi used his new bricks for the vaults of the cathedral of the Assumption, and this was the first time that real bricks were used in Moscow. Being cheaper and stronger than the deficient Russian lime-stone, bricks became by the end of the 15th century, the principal construction material for the major edifices, and the lime-stone was used primarily for decorations. With the exception of the Kremlin, and a very few houses around it and the churches, Moscow would continue for a long time to use wood for its construction, including most of the boyars' mansions. For erecting any privately owned stone building, the prospective owner needed a special permission from the grand duke to get stones or bricks, so scarce was this material at that time. By the middle of the following century, Saint Basil's cathedral was built - the masterpiece of the Russian brick architecture.\n\nAntonio Solari and Marco Ruffo\n\nTo proceed with his ambitious plans of rebuilding and embellishing his capital, Ivan needed more foreign architects, artists and craftsmen of all sorts. Several missions were sent to Italy to recruit them. Good salaries and the experience that Fioraventi already had encouraged many to come. Among them was Pietro Antonio Solari, a "
