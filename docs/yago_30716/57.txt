Rozhdestvensky Convent, or the Convent of Nativity of Theotokos is a female cloister in Moscow, Russia, located on the left bank of the Neglinnaya River.

Rozhdestvensky Convent was founded in 1386, probably by Maria Konstantinovna, mother of Prince Vladimir Andreyevich the Bold of Serpukhov. According to some accounts, the convent used to be located in the Moscow Kremlin until 1484. Rozhdestvensky Convent was severely damaged by fire in 1500 and 1547. In 1525, Solomonia Saburova, the first wife of Grand Prince Vasili III, was forced to take the veil under the name of Sophia.
