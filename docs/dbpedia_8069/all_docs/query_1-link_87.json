        "text": "BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- McDonald's has not only survived the stones of angry Serb mobs, a 78-day bombing campaign, a tattered local economy and massive anti-American hysteria -- it's become an unlikely success story in a country devastated by war.\n\nWhile other Belgrade restaurants gape empty, only occasionally attracting rich Serbs in the evening, constant crowds at McDonald's keeps cashiers' tills ringing steadily at prewar levels and satisfied customers munching on burgers and cartons of fries.\n\n''We are beyond politics, people come here for the unique McDonald's experience,'' says manager Dragoljub Jakic.\n\nThe 40-year-old Jakic is the driving force behind the concept that not only kept the burger chain going despite heavy anti-American sentiment during NATO's 78-day bombing campaign against Yugoslavia, but made it the only Western venture that really works in today's internationally isolated and economically depressed Serbia.\n\n''Our marketing strategy was to preserve the original American brand by giving it a local touch -- temporarily making McDonald's more international, if you like, rather than an exclusively American trademark,'' says Jakic. ''We convinced the people we were sincere in sharing their destiny -- they had no reason to hate us.''\n\nZorica Serdarevic certainly doesn't. Gulping down spoonfuls of chocolate-covered vanilla ice cream at a Belgrade branch, she says McDonald's is simply ''the best.'' Since the end of the war, the 12-year-old is a twice weekly regular, usually accompanied by grandmother Jelena, 60.\n\nAnd while her grandmother doesn't share Zorica's enthusiasm for McDonald's -- known here simply as Mac -- she nevertheless joins other customers in sampling the chain's latest local hits: garden salad with tropical island's dressing and the McFresh sandwich with peppers and tomatoes.\n\nIn March, the scene was dramatically different. As NATO launched air raids to force Milosevic to accept a peace deal for Kosovo, pounding sites in the capital, anti-Western emotions erupted with angry crowds trashing the U.S. and Western European embassies.\n\nMcDonald's -- for many the epitome of Americana -- was also attacked. Vandals -- many of them crewcut young men uniformly dressed in black leather jackets and jeans -- smashed everything, from the restaurants' windows to chairs.\n\nThe Belgrade restaurant was forced to close down.\n\nLess then a month later, with Belgrade still under attack, McDonald's reopened its doors, plastered with cardboard and plastic sheeting and posters adamantly telling Serbs: ''McDonald's is yours!''\n\nThe repainted golden arches of the company logo were adorned with a traditional Serbian cap, the basement floor was turned into an air-raid shelter, prices were lowered and free burgers were handed out to anti-NATO demonstrators marching past the restaurant.\n\nSlowly, the customers returned. Now, three months after the end of the bombing campaign, McDonald's has been restored to its former glory.\n\nIn a country where the average salary is $80, the scene at a McDonald's restaurant in downtown Belgrade resembles a mirage.\n\nGone are the wartime Serb symbols. The protective cardboard sheeting and the bullet-riddled wall at one of the restaurants have been replaced by shining new windows, tables and chairs.\n\n''We feel the economic crisis, it's true, but to be a part of McDonald's is to be eternally optimistic,'' Jakic said.\n\nTo back his confidence, many old customers, hesitant to eat here during the bombardment, are back.\n\nHolding hands and lucky to find a free table in the midday rush, a student couple explain why they keep coming.\n\n''I don't mind Mac being an American company, I have nothing against America, on the contrary,'' says Nenad Stajic, 20. ''I enjoy the atmosphere -- no domestic Serbian restaurant could create anything quite like it.''\n\nKosara Vasovic, 43, still bitter about the months of NATO bombings, says she didn't buy Mac's ''Serbian gimmick period'' despite occasionally treating daughter Marija, 20, to a meal here.\n\n''Time passes and you forget,'' Vasovic says. ''After all it's our people who work here so Mac is really ours, too.''"
