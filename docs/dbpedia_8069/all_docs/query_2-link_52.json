Gallis, Coordinator\n\nSpecialist in European Affairs\n\nForeign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division\n\nCongressional Research Service Ë The Library of Congress\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis report, originally prepared as a memorandum for Senator William Roth, examines the\n\nâlessons learnedâ of Operation Allied Force, NATOâs effort to make President Milosevic of\n\nYugoslavia yield to its demands over Kosovo. The report analyzes NATOâs political and\n\nmilitary objectives; examines why Milosevic accepted NATOâs terms; and evaluates Russiaâs\n\nrole in the conflict. The report also assesses European/Canadian shortcomings in military\n\ncapabilities made evident by the conflict; reviews the performance of the three new allies and\n\nthe implications of their performance for possible further enlargement of the alliance; and\n\nencapsulates the range of allied viewpoints during the conflict and the political importance of\n\nmaintaining a unified NATO position. Finally, the report analyzes the implications of the\n\nconflict for non-Article V missions for NATO, and the conclusions that potential NATO\n\nadversaries might draw from the war. This report may be updated as further information on\n\nthe conflict becomes available.

Questions arising from the conflict about\n\npolitical objectives, strategy, command arrangements, NATO-Russian relations, allied\n\ncapabilities, future enlargement, allied unity, non-Article V operations, and the\n\nresponse of potential adversaries remain under debate. This report provides brief\n\nâlessons learnedâ from Operation Allied Force.\n\nNATO had limited political objectives in the conflict, most of which were at least\n\npartially met. Key considerations, such as avoiding civilian casualties and losses to\n\nNATO forces, affected design of the military strategy supporting these objectives.\n\nNATOâs restrained escalation of force, with no threat of ground attack and a gradual\n\napplication of increased air power, violated conventional U.S. military doctrine to\n\nmaximize shock. A desire to sustain allied unity largely caused this restraint, and\n\nceded time and initiative to Milosevic. Subsequent proposals to streamline allied\n\ndecision-making, including an âintervention committee,â are discussed.\n\nWhy Milosevic decided to accept NATO terms and withdraw his forces remains\n\nunclear. Damage caused by NATO bombing, sustained allied unity, possible allied\n\nplanning for a ground war, a desire to preserve his forces, and desertion of Russia as\n\na possible protector were likely principal reasons.\n\nNATO sought to maintain political engagement with Russia, which sharply\n\nopposed the air war. Russia sought to undermine NATOâs objectives, but in the end\n\nacceded to allied desires to assist in achieving a diplomatic solution.\n\nThe conflict revealed a significant gap in military capability between the United\n\nStates and its allies, which were deficient in key areas such as lift, precision-guided\n\nmunitions, and night combat. These shortfalls may have spurred European interest\n\nin developing greater capabilities, an interest not yet reflected in defense budgets.\n\nThe three new allies gave political support to NATO goals, but did not send combat\n\nforces. Their restrained involvement raised issues for a possible next round of\n\nenlargement, such as candidate statesâ military preparedness and political will.\n\nNATO maintained unity, but a range of views was evident in allied governments.\n\nLeftist or center-left governments supported the conflict, Britain took a leading role,\n\nItaly bore a heavy burden, and the Greek government, despite vigorous popular\n\nopposition, maintained its political support for the war. The conflict broke new\n\nground in that the allies went to war in part for humanitarian reasons.\n\nPotential adversaries learned that NATO may no longer regard claims of\n\nsovereignty as a shield against allied intervention in their affairs. They may also have\n\nlearned useful lessons from Milosevicâs tactics intended to divide the allies, and that\n\nNATO may be more likely to take decisive action to protect interests near Europe,\n\nthan when interests at a greater distance are affected.\n\nThis report, in the form of a memorandum, was originally prepared for Senator\n\nWilliam Roth, and is being made available to Congress as a whole with his permission.\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1\n\nOperation Allied Force: The Strategy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nPolitical Objectives of Operation Allied Force . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nMilitary Goals of Operation Allied Force . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3\n\nApplication of Military Force: Escalate or Overwhelm? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4\n\nExclusion of a Ground Force Option . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6\n\nWhy Did Milosevic Agree to Withdraw His Forces from Kosovo? . . . . . . . 7\n\nNATO Decision-Making and Command Arrangements . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9\n\nPerformance of the NATO Chain of Command . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9\n\nRussia . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11\n\nRussiaâs Goals During the Kosovo Conflict . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11\n\nThe Kosovo Conflict and NATO-Russia Relations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14\n\nNATO Capabilities and Burdensharing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15\n\nGaps in U.S.-European Military Capabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15\n\nSpeed of U.S. Ground Force Deployments and Employments . . . . . . . . . 16\n\nNATOâs New Members . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17\n\nNATO and Future Threats . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19\n\nThe Implications of Allied Force for U.S. NATO Leadership . . . . . . . . . . 19\n\nContinuing Importance of Unity . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20\n\nA Range of Viewpoints . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20\n\nESDI . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 22\n\nAllied Force and Non-Article V Missions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 22\n\nNon-Article V Missions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23\n\nConsensus-building . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23\n\nRole of the U.N . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24\n\nFuture Missions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24\n\nLessons that NATOâs Possible Future Adversaries\n\nMight Take from Operation Allied Force . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25\n\nConclusion . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 26\n\nKosovo: Lessons Learned from\n\nOperation Allied Force\n\nIntroduction*\n\nOperation Allied Force ended with the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces from and\n\nthe return of most refugees to Kosovo. The conflict, however, raised many questions\n\nabout broader issues affecting the future of the NATO alliance. This memorandum\n\nexamines a number of âlessons learned,â with the realization that any conflict is\n\nunique and only elements of Allied Force may have relevance for future operations.\n\nDuring the war, there were questions about NATOâs strategy, particularly\n\nPresident Clintonâs announcement that the use of ground forces was not being\n\nconsidered as an option, and the need for an escalation of air operations. Bringing\n\ntogether 19 allies with disparate histories and interests, and often different political\n\ncultures was a formidable task. How did that task affect formulation of political goals\n\nand military objectives? Were the allies consistent in those goals and objectives? The\n\nfirst section of the memorandum examines these questions.\n\nIn the second section, CRS examines decision-making and command\n\narrangements. Did the chain of command operate as expected by the allies? Was\n\nAllied Force âwar by committee,â with a least common denominator determining final\n\ndecisions, or was greater flexibility in reconciling national sentiments with strategic\n\nrequirements apparent?\n\nIn the third section, Russiaâs role is examined. NATO has sought for several\n\nyears to engage Russia in security issues on the continent, without giving Moscow a\n\nveto over decision-making. From the allied perspective, did Russia play a\n\nconstructive role? Does the conflict indicate a need for different ways to engage\n\nRussia in the future?\n\nThe fourth section examines NATO capabilities and burdensharing. It is clear\n\nthat the United States bore the brunt of the air campaign. Given this fact, how\n\nsignificant was the role played by European allies in Allied Force? What did the war\n\nindicate about strengths and shortcomings of NATOâs military forces? How did the\n\nnew member states, which joined the alliance only two weeks before the conflict\n\nbegan, respond to their initial, and undoubtedly difficult, test? Does their performance\n\nin the conflict have implications for a possible next round of enlargement?\n\nThe final section analyzes the implications of the conflict for NATOâs future.\n\nWere the allies satisfied with the outcome of Allied Force? How well did NATO\n\n*Prepared by Paul E. Gallis, Specialist in European Affairs.\n\nCRS-2\n\ntolerate a range of sentiments in allied governments, and how important is consensus-\n\nbuilding and unity in such a conflict? Does the war indicate a need for greater\n\nEuropean military capability, particularly for non-Article V operations? What insights\n\nmight potential adversaries have learned about NATO from the conduct of Allied\n\nForce?\n\nOperation Allied Force: The Strategy\n\nPolitical Objectives of Operation Allied Force*\n\nNATOâs political goals in first threatening, then engaging, in air strikes against\n\nYugoslavia were limited. In essence, NATO utilized air strikes as a means to compel\n\nYugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to change his behavior in Kosovo, which was\n\nviewed to be unacceptable to the international community on humanitarian grounds\n\nand threatening to neighboring states, and to promote a peaceful resolution to the\n\nconflict. Outside of Kosovo, NATO also sought to stabilize neighboring countries,\n\nmaintain allied unity, and limit damage to relations with Russia. The air campaign did\n\nnot have as stated objectives taking Kosovo away from Serbia by force, providing\n\ndefense for the Kosovo Liberation Army, or removing Milosevic from power.\n\nNATO first threatened air strikes against Yugoslavia in October 1998 as a means\n\nto enforce agreements reached between Richard Holbrooke and Milosevic on a cease-\n\nfire and Serbian force levels in Kosovo. The NATO threat theoretically remained in\n\nplace during the peace negotiations at Rambouillet in early 1999, providing an\n\nâincentiveâ for the parties to reach an agreement. After Yugoslavia rejected the\n\ninterim agreement, NATO publicly renewed its threat of air strikes in March 1999.\n\nAt the start of the operation, U.S. and NATO leaders said that the action was\n\nintended to stop the killing in Kosovo and compel Milosevic to accept the interim\n\npolitical settlement negotiated at Rambouillet. On March 24, President Clinton\n\noutlined three objectives of the mission: to demonstrate the seriousness of NATOâs\n\npurpose; to deter an even bloodier offensive by Yugoslavia against innocent civilians\n\nin Kosovo; if necessary, to seriously damage the Serbian militaryâs capacity to make\n\nwar in Kosovo.\n\nInstead of capitulating or reversing course, however, Milosevic immediately\n\nintensified his massive ethnic cleansing campaign to drive out most of the ethnic\n\nAlbanian population from Kosovo. Hundreds of thousands of Kosovar refugees fled\n\nor were driven out to neighboring countries. Although NATOâs objective of\n\ndeterring such violence failed, NATO resolved to continue the air campaign until\n\ncertain conditions were met. In April, NATO established five core demands on\n\nMilosevic: stop all military action, violence and repression in Kosovo; withdraw from\n\nKosovo his military, police, and paramilitary forces; agree to the stationing in Kosovo\n\nof an international military presence with NATO at its core; agree to the return of all\n\nrefugees and access to them by humanitarian aid organizations; and provide assurance\n\n*Prepared by (name redacted), Specialist in International Relations.\n\nCRS-3\n\nof willingness to work on the basis of the Rambouillet Accords to establish a political\n\nframework agreement for Kosovo.\n\nNATO held to these objectives through the rest of the campaign. Some proved\n\nto be more controversial than others. Regarding the withdrawal of Serb forces,\n\nNATO subsequently specified that all of Belgradeâs forces had to leave Kosovo, in\n\ncontrast to earlier agreements that would have allowed Belgrade to retain some forces\n\nin the province. U.S. officials asserted that only a full withdrawal would allow for the\n\nreturn of a substantial number of refugees. In an apparent concession, however,\n\nNATO said, at the April 1999 summit in Washington, that it would consider a pause\n\nin the air campaign if Milosevicâs forces âbeganâ to withdraw.\n\nWith regard to the international military presence, NATO asserted that it should\n\nprovide the âcoreâ of the force. The May 6 statement adopted by the Group of 8\n\ncountries, however, referred only to âeffective international civil and security\n\npresencesâ endorsed by the United Nations, making no mention of NATO and\n\nimplying possible U.N. command and control. However, the June 3 statement\n\npresented to Milosevic by the Russian and Finnish envoys restored NATOâs\n\nâsubstantial participationâ and united command in the international security presence.\n\nMilosevicâs agreement to the statement and the subsequent Military Technical\n\nAgreement worked out between NATO and Yugoslav military leaders, with terms\n\nmeeting NATOâs requirements, enabled the alliance to end Operation Allied Force\n\non June 10. NATO later reached a de-militarization agreement with the Kosovo\n\nLiberation Army.\n\nWith these agreements and the passage of U.N. Security Council Resolution\n\n1244 (June 10), NATO claimed that the stated political objectives of the Allied Force\n\noperation had been met. These objectives, limited in scope, could only provide\n\nconditions for peace to take hold in Kosovo. The larger objective of securing peace\n\nand security in Kosovo and southeastern Europe would depend on other operations\n\nand international efforts.\n\nMilitary Goals of Operation Allied Force*\n\nWithout access to NATO military planning documents, any discussion of military\n\nobjectives is limited to public statements, and consequently must be generalized. It\n\nis impossible to separate the military goals of Operation Allied Force from their\n\npolitical context, given that they were crafted and adjusted to maintain a political\n\nconsensus among the allies. In announcing the onset of the air campaign, NATO\n\nSecretary-General Solana stated:\n\nAlliance military action is intended to support its political aims. To do so,\n\nNATOâs military action will be directed towards halting the violent attacks being\n\ncommitted by Yugoslav army and security forces and disrupting their ability to\n\nconduct future attacks against the population of Kosovo...\n\n*Prepared by (name redacted), Specialist in National Defense.\n\nCRS-4\n\nFrom the onset, however, there appeared to be a disconnection between this\n\nobjective and the conduct of the air campaign. Targeting was restricted almost\n\nentirely to air defense and infrastructure facilities, destruction of which appeared not\n\nto hamper Serb ethnic cleansing operations in Kosovo. In addition, Operation Allied\n\nForceâs design as a campaign of phased escalation indicated that hopes of âsignalingâ\n\nNATOâs resolve took precedence over solely military concerns. As it became\n\napparent that air strikes could not stop Serb operations, public military objectives\n\nwere brought more in line with what could be achieved. On April 15, before the\n\nSenate Armed Services Committee, Secretary Cohen stated:\n\nOur military objective is to degrade and damage the military and security structure\n\nthat President Milosevic has used to depopulate and destroy the Albanian majority\n\nin Kosovo.\n\nNow the military objectives were drafted in relative terms (e.g., âdegradingâ\n\ncapabilities), and hence achievable almost by definition. Outright destruction of Serb\n\narmed forces and halting the attacks in Kosovo were no longer included as a military\n\nobjective, because they could not be achieved solely though an air campaign, and a\n\nground offensive was politically unacceptable for the allies.\n\nThough NATO spokesmen emphasized that all targets had military significance,\n\nthe air strikes were increasingly targeted against economic and political infrastructure\n\n(e.g., bridges, power plants, TV stations, presidential residences). These were targets\n\nof value to the Milosevic regime, and reflected an intensified effort to force a political\n\ncapitulation from President Milosevic, rather than an effort to wipe out operating\n\nground forces in Kosovo.\n\nHence from the outset, Operation Allied Force was a unique type of operation,\n\nand not guided by normal military doctrine. There appears to have been no confusion\n\non military objectives among NATO military forces. The significant differences in\n\nperspective were rather on the national political level, where short-term military\n\nobjectives were affected by political adjustments in target lists, strong aversion to\n\ncasualties on either side of the conflict, and concerns over domestic public reactions.\n\nNATO military leaders, including General Clark, General Naumann, and General\n\nShort have criticized the extent to which they were unable to conduct the operation\n\nbased upon military objectives, and have called for an examination of the allianceâs\n\ndecision making processes once a military operation has been undertaken. Gen.\n\nNaumann has also noted that while the Yugoslavs prepared for a war, NATO\n\nâprepared for an operationâ; a distinction marking the inherent constraints on\n\nNATOâs military leaders.1\n\nApplication of Military Force: Escalate or Overwhelm?*\n\nNATOâs military strategy for forcing Milosevic out of Kosovo, based on the\n\ngradual application of military force, received considerable criticism from military\n\n1Defense News, July 26, p. 30.\n\n*Prepared by (name redacted), Specialist in National Defense.\n\nCRS-5\n\nstrategists and others despite the fact that it ultimately did compel his withdrawal at\n\nno cost in NATO lives. The use of force was restrained in several dimensions: first,\n\nthere was no confrontation or serious threat by allied ground forces; second, air\n\npower was applied gradually; third, some strategic civilian targets were kept off limits;\n\nand fourth, air power was restricted to high altitude delivery in order to reduce danger\n\nto allied pilots. This restrained escalation of force appeared to violate conventional\n\nU.S. doctrine to apply optimal joint forces for decisive results.2 It also contradicted\n\nU.S. Air Force doctrine to maximize shock with simultaneous effects-based targeting,\n\nwhether one preferred strategic paralysis of Serbia or destruction of its combat forces\n\nas the aim.3\n\nThe advantages of gradual escalation were primarily political. An over-riding\n\nconsideration was to sustain allied unity throughout the military campaign against\n\nYugoslavia.4 Key participants such as Italy and Greece might have been hard-pressed\n\nto control public dissent in the face of perceived NATO heavy-handedness, especially\n\nif it resulted in sizable Serbian civilian or NATO military casualties; all Western\n\ndemocracies, currently, place a high priority on avoiding casualties. Many Western\n\npolicy-makers expected that modest air strikes would quickly bring Milosevic to the\n\ntable â per the precedent of the Bosnian Serb reaction in 1995. As a practical\n\nmatter, beginning with limited operations demonstrated NATO resolve immediately\n\nwhile avoiding a long, possibly awkward, wait for more massive forces to be\n\nassembled. Militarily, the incremental approach allowed a conservative attack and\n\nassessment of Serbian air defenses to minimize dangers to allied air crews. Bad\n\nweather and Serbian dispersal and camouflage of forces also constrained effective\n\ntargeting.\n\nThe disadvantages of gradual escalation were that it ceded time and initiative to\n\nMilosevic. Whereas massive strikes might have damaged Serbian military capabilities\n\nand shocked the leaders and public into early capitulation, limited strikes permitted\n\nphysical and psychological accommodations and adjustments to be made on a daily\n\n2In 1984, Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger set forth six tests for use of U.S. combat\n\nforces, including that they should be committed âwholeheartedly.â Congress, in the 1986\n\nGoldwater-Nichols Act, underlined that U.S. forces should fight jointly. In 1993, General\n\nColin Powell restated the Weinberger Doctrine as, â... we should always execute for decisive\n\nresults.â See (name redacted) and Nina Serafino, CRS Report 94-805, The Use of Force:\n\nKey Contemporary Documents, October 17, 1994.\n\n3Many points on air operations in Kosovo derive from materials presented at an Eaker\n\nColloquy on Aerospace Strategy, Requirements, and Forces held on August 16, 1999 in\n\nWashington, D.C., titled Operation Allied Force: Strategy, Execution, Implications.\n\n(Subsequently cited as Eaker Colloquy.) Theoretical background is described by Howard D.\n\nBelote, âParalyze or Pulverize? Liddell Hart, Clausewitz, and Their Influence on Air Power\n\nTheory,â Strategic Review, Winter 1999, pp. 40-46.\n\n4General Clark, â...the cohesion of the alliance was more important than any single target we\n\nstruck...â Quoted by Erin Q. Winograd, âClark Says Air Campaign Wasnât Slowed by\n\nCoalition Requirements,â Inside the Army, August 9,1999, p. 2. In a different interpretation,\n\nanother journalist reported that General Clark said, â...the alliance was hamstrung by\n\ncompeting political and military interests that may have prolonged the conflict.â See William\n\nDrozdiak, âWar Effort Restrained By Politics,â The Washington Post, July 20, 1999, p.14.\n\nCRS-6\n\nbasis and allowed Serbian military and security forces to concentrate on their ethnic\n\ncleansing missions. Allied forces per se were not under serious threat and could\n\nafford to take as long as necessary to prosecute incremental attacks against\n\nYugoslavia; the same was not true, of course, for the Kosovo Albanians â each day\n\nof the campaign meant added deaths and displacements for them. Whether an\n\nalternative, âoverwhelmingâ strategy could have been mounted and concluded within\n\nless than the 78 days of Operation Allied Force will never be known for certain. It is\n\nlikely, however, that looser political constraints on civilian targeting and operating\n\naltitudes would have allowed air strikes to create greater damage sooner to both\n\nSerbian infrastructure and combat forces.\n\nExclusion of a Ground Force Option*\n\nThe element of NATOâs strategy of force escalation that was most visibly and\n\nheatedly debated was the decision to exclude participation of ground forces. Special\n\ncriticism was reserved for public declarations of that policy, such as President\n\nClintonâs statement on March 24 that âI do not intend to put our troops in Kosovo\n\nto fight a war.â5 The political justification for such a militarily unwise statement was\n\nto reassure any skittish NATO allies that the United States was serious about keeping\n\nthe Kosovo operation limited and as bloodless as possible. It became increasingly\n\napparent that, should the air campaign fail to compel Serbian withdrawal from\n\nKosovo, NATO would either have to use ground forces or define down its objectives.\n\nBy May 18, the President said, âI donât think we or our allies should take any options\n\noff the table,...â6 In the end, ground forces were not used, but the debate continues\n\nabout the efficacy of using or threatening to use them.\n\nThe decision to deploy ground forces generally evidences more serious intent\n\nthan does high-altitude bombing alone. The strategic advantage, in this case, was that\n\nMilosevic would have been less able to wait out and ignore NATO air actions â he\n\nwould lose the initiative; the disadvantage was that all the allies would have to face\n\nthe risk of military casualties and many other uncertainties and potential consequences\n\nflowing from a commitment to invade Yugoslavia. Although NATO unquestionably\n\ncould have mustered a ground force capable of defeating the Yugoslav Army,\n\ngeography and politics complicated planning for its insertion.7 A major effort might\n\nhave taken many months to prepare. Even without a specific plan, however, had\n\nNATO not ruled out ground forces, Milosevic would surely have felt threatened by\n\nthe strong NATO combat formations already deployed in neighboring Bosnia,\n\nMacedonia, and Albania and logistics bases in Hungary. Had Milosevic and his\n\ngenerals not felt safe from ground attacks that could potentially strike from eight\n\n*Prepared by (name redacted), Specialist in National Defense.\n\n5See R.W. Apple Jr., âNimble Security Juggler: Sandy Berger, The Strategist And Politician,â\n\nNew York Times, August 25, 1999, p.1.\n\n6Ibid.\n\n7For a discussion of military and geographic planning factors, see (name redacted), Kosovo:\n\nPossible Ground Force Options, CRS Report RS20188, May 4, 1999, 6 pp.\n\nCRS-7\n\ndifferent surrounding states, they might have held out less long or have devoted\n\nmilitary resources to preparing defenses rather than to ethnic cleansing.8\n\nAt the tactical level, there were indications that forces on the ground â working\n\njointly with air forces â enhanced the overall operation beyond their direct\n\ncapabilities. NATO high-altitude, precision bombing seemed quite successful against\n\nfixed, infrastructure targets. It was much less successful against Serbian combat\n\nforces that were dispersed, hidden, and camouflaged. NATO air operations enjoyed\n\ntheir greatest success against Serbian combat forces in the last days of the campaign\n\nwhen ground incursions by the Kosovo Liberation Army forced the Serbs to mass and\n\nmove forces, providing lucrative targets. Task Force Hawk, a U.S. Army unit based\n\non Apache attack helicopters and long-range rocket systems, was assembled close to\n\nKosovo in Albania. Although TF Hawk was not committed, it appears that its\n\nreconnaissance and surveillance assets, intelligence processing capability, and ground-\n\noriented analysts were effective in providing useful target data for NATO air forces.9\n\nAt both the strategic and tactical levels, therefore, it appears that threatening to use,\n\nor actually introducing, ground forces early in Operation Allied Force could have\n\nhastened Milosevicâs withdrawal from Kosovo and diverted effort from his campaign\n\nof ethnic cleansing. Whether all allies and neighboring countries would have\n\nsupported such a strategy remains uncertain.\n\nWhy Did Milosevic Agree to Withdraw His Forces from Kosovo?*\n\nA definitive explanation for Milosevicâs decision to withdraw his forces from\n\nKosovo is not possible at present, given that Milosevic has yet to explain publicly the\n\nreasons for the withdrawal, and that archives and memoirs that could shed light on the\n\nquestion are unlikely to be available for some time. However, observers have offered\n\nseveral plausible explanations. One factor may have been the damage caused by 11\n\nweeks of allied bombing. According to press accounts, the bombing appeared to be\n\nsuccessful in destroying military bases and government installations, as well as dual\n\nuse infrastructure within Serbia proper, including bridges, oil refineries and power\n\nplants. Perhaps most importantly, NATO targeted factories, television stations and\n\nother assets of Milosevicâs key supporters, including the influential Karic brothers.\n\n(Milosevicâs cronies may have also been discomfited by an EU travel ban that\n\nprevented them from gaining easy access to their overseas bank accounts.) Although\n\nMilosevic may have at first received a political boost from public outrage at the\n\nNATO bombing, he may have feared that the extensive damage caused by large-scale,\n\nopen-ended bombing would sharply erode his public support and the loyalty of his\n\ninner circle.10\n\n8At one time or another, Macedonia, Greece, and Hungary did state opposition to staging a\n\nground offensive from their territories. They cooperated in all NATO military activities short\n\nof that, however, and were never pressured for a definitive decision.\n\n9Theodore G. Stroup Jr., âTask Force Hawk: Beyond Expectations,â Army Magazine, August\n\n1999, pp 8-10.\n\n*Prepared by (name redacted), Specialist in European Affairs.\n\n10Evening Standard (London), August 19, 1999, 8; New York Times, June 6, 1999, 1.\n\nCRS-8\n\nDamage inflicted on Serbian and Yugoslav forces may not have been a key factor\n\nin forcing the withdrawal; dispersal of forces and expert camouflage reportedly\n\nmoderated their losses. However, the allied air presence may well have hindered\n\nYugoslav forces in their campaign to stamp out the KLA, which had been a key\n\nobjective of Milosevicâs ethnic cleansing effort. While the KLA did not seriously\n\nthreaten Serbian control of the province during the bombing, Milosevic may have\n\ncalculated that time was not on his side in the long run. The tactical stalemate with the\n\nKLA could eventually have turned to his disadvantage, particularly if a NATO ground\n\noffensive would have been launched.11\n\nIt is unclear the extent to which Milosevic took seriously the threat of a ground\n\noffensive. NATO countries never began serious preparations for an invasion, in part\n\ndue to concern about the negative political impact of likely Western casualties.\n\nGeneral Clark has said that he believes that Milosevic had received intelligence that\n\nthe United States and other NATO countries were likely to begin serious\n\nconsideration of a ground assault in the near future. Milosevic may have calculated\n\nthat his ability to secure a deal would deteriorate rapidly if that occurred. Clark said\n\nthat he believes Milosevicâs military advisors told him that if NATO ultimately did\n\ndecide on a ground assault, Yugoslav forces would be defeated.12 Milosevic may\n\nhave calculated that such a defeat, and the heavy losses Yugoslav forces would suffer,\n\ncould be politically fatal for him. Relatives of reservists demonstrated against the war\n\nin several towns in southern Serbia in May 1999, after a modest number of bodies\n\nwere returned from the battlefields of Kosovo. Some reservists in Kosovo\n\nabandoned their posts. In addition, Milosevic could not rule out the possibility that\n\nNATO forces might not stop at taking Kosovo, and could move on Belgrade in order\n\nto oust him from power.\n\nMilosevic may have also been swayed by his increasing international isolation.\n\nHe believed that NATO countries would not be able to maintain the unity and resolve\n\nto carry out military operations of the necessary duration and intensity to force him\n\nto quit Kosovo. On April 30, Milosevic said that âwe never thought we could defeat\n\nNATO...[However,] you are not willing to sacrifice lives to achieve our surrender.\n\nBut we are willing to die to defend our rights as an independent sovereign nation. The\n\nU.S. Congress is beginning to understand that bombing a country into compliance is\n\nnot a viable policy or strategy.â13 However, the NATO allies remained unified during\n\nthe conflict, in part due to public outrage in the West over the brutality of the Serbian\n\nethnic cleansing campaign in Kosovo. Another important factor was the possible\n\nconcern among many allied leaders that a failure to achieve allied objectives in\n\nKosovo would deal a devastating blow to NATOâs credibility. Finally, and perhaps\n\nmost critically, there were no combat losses among allied pilots, as Milosevic had\n\nhoped.\n\n11Anthony Cordesman, âThe Lessons and Non-Lessons of the Air and Missile War in\n\nKosovo,â Center for Strategic and International Studies, August 3, 1999.\n\n12AP news wire dispatch, September 1, 1999.\n\n13UPI news agency dispatch, April 30, 1999.\n\nCRS-9\n\nA related consideration for Milosevic may have been his perception that Russia\n\nhad abandoned him. Perhaps buoyed by the reports of his brother Borislav, who was\n\nYugoslav Ambassador to Russia, Milosevic may have been counting on Russian\n\nsupport to deter allied action against him, or if that failed, for Russia to provide him\n\nwith concrete military assistance. However, it became clear that no such assistance\n\nwas forthcoming. Press accounts of the June 3 meeting between Milosevic, Russian\n\nenvoy Viktor Chernomyrdin and Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari agree that\n\nChernomyrdin supported Ahtisaariâs insistence that the plan, which was based on the\n\ncore NATO demands for ending the conflict, was non-negotiable. Given the\n\nconstellation of international political forces against him, Milosevic may have seen the\n\nChernomyrdin/Ahtisaari peace document as the best offer he was likely to get.14\n\nSome observers have raised the issue of whether Milosevic in fact wanted to get\n\nrid of Kosovo all along. They speculate that given the unfavorable demographic\n\nsituation in the province, and continuing Western demands for autonomy for Kosovo,\n\nMilosevic may have felt that Serbian control of Kosovo was doomed in the long run\n\nanyway, and that having it taken away from him by force at acceptable cost was more\n\npolitically palatable than to give it up without a fight.15 Moreover, the Chernomyrdin-\n\nAhtisaari document recognized Yugoslaviaâs sovereignty over Kosovo, while giving\n\nthe U.N. the unenviable task of governing the province. Skeptics argue that such a\n\nstrategy would appear convoluted, even by Balkan standards. They add that if such\n\nwas Milosevicâs strategy, it has not been a great success; the defeat in Kosovo has\n\nlanded him in the most difficult domestic political situation of his rule.\n\nNATO Decision-Making and Command Arrangements\n\nPerformance of the NATO Chain of Command*\n\nGiven the generally smooth execution of the air campaign and its favorable\n\noutcome â particularly with no casualties to airmen â NATOâs military chain of\n\ncommand for Operation Allied Force has suffered little criticism. NATO has a great\n\nadvantage in its long-standing and often-exercised chains of command and\n\nstandardized procedures. Coordinating the military efforts of nineteen nations on\n\nshort notice without that advantage would have been a daunting task.\n\nOn the other hand, concern has been expressed about political influence over or\n\nwithin the NATO chain. NATO has the built-in tension of most democratic societies,\n\nincluding the United States: how to insure civilian control over military operations\n\nwithout harmful micro-management of the generals.16 Questioned on the extent of\n\n14Interview with JUL party leader Liubisa Ristic, Il Giornale (Milan), June 7, 1999, 1; U.S.\n\nNews and World Report, June 14, 1999, 32. ; Time, June 14, 1999, 42.\n\n15New York Times, June 6, 1999, 1.\n\n*Prepared by (name redacted), Specialist in National Defense.\n\n16For distinctive historical reasons, some allies, such as France, have acquired in the 20th\n\ncentury much tighter civilian control over their military establishment than the United (cont.)\n\nCRS-10\n\npolitical interference, Secretary of Defense Cohen told the Senate Armed Services\n\nCommittee, âThere were restraints placed on ... General Clark.â Cohen then noted\n\nthe difficulty in getting 19 nations to think through their roles without hindering\n\nmilitary planning, â... consistent also with making sure there is always civilian control\n\nover the military.â17 In discussing the incremental nature of the campaign, General\n\nClark â...acknowledged that he was compelled to sacrifice basic logic of warfare to\n\nmaintain the political cohesion of the alliance.â18 As an example, he cited the\n\nnecessity for concern with anti-war pressures felt by coalition governments in\n\nGermany and Italy. In the final analysis, however, nineteen sovereign and diverse\n\ndemocracies were able to retain their political prerogatives through to a united\n\nmilitary victory. The question is open whether any structural change to NATO could\n\nmake the process easier.\n\nIn a war limited to air strikes, many questions were raised about NATO target\n\nselection and approval. Secretary Cohen testified that President Clinton did not select\n\ntargets, although he did review recommendations and target lists. It was also clear\n\nthat Air Force generals would have preferred to receive political guidance on the\n\neffects desired by bombing, and then select appropriate targets and timing, rather than\n\nsimply servicing an approved list of targets. For maximum effect, a number of targets\n\nmight be attacked near-simultaneously; a political veto of just a few of those targets\n\ncould disrupt the whole plan. Air Force generals were allowed to make their case for\n\npreferred strategies, but accepted political judgements. As the campaign progressed,\n\nit appeared that nations became more comfortable with the targeting and the\n\nperception was that nations tended to veto only sensitive targets assigned to their own\n\npilots. It is claimed, however, that governments did from time-to-time intercede and\n\nurgently request postponement or withdrawal of selected targets; their wishes were\n\nusually â but not always â respected.19\n\nTo streamline decision-making over targeting, some have suggested a small\n\nâintervention committeeâ representing the governments in a âcoalition of the\n\nwilling.â20 Such a proposal might well sacrifice allied unity. In the Kosovo conflict,\n\nfor example, key allies such as the German and Italian governments were urging\n\nrestraint in attacking targets that they believed might cause high numbers of civilian\n\ncasualties. Exclusion of such governments from the decision-making process would\n\nhave robbed NATO of the important tool of a united political front. And in a\n\ncomparable parallel, small countries such as the Netherlands â an important\n\nStates.\n\n17Secretary of Defense William Cohen before the Senate Armed Services Committee on July\n\n20, 1999.\n\n18Drozdiak, op.cit.\n\n19Eaker Colloquy.

A force of 180-200 Russians\n\npainted KFOR on their vehicles and dashed from their station in Bosnia to Pristina\n\nbefore KFOR entered Kosovo. It is alleged that SACEUR Clark ordered British\n\nLieutenant General Jackson, Commander of KFOR, to intercept or preempt the\n\nRussian occupation of the airfield. He did not, or perhaps could not, carry out the\n\norder (if it was indeed an order). In any event, NATO treated the Russian stunt as a\n\npolitical rather than a military problem.21 Even from a purely military perspective, no\n\nharm was done and neither NATO nor U.S. interests would have been served by an\n\narmed confrontation with Russian troops. The United States has not criticized LTG\n\nJacksonâs judgment in this matter. According to President Clintonâs policy, a U.S.\n\ncommander in a multilateral force retains the option of not acting on an order\n\nexceeding the agreed mandate for that force, and could refer his action to the\n\nPresident for review; he could also act to protect his forces if they were endangered.22\n\nIt could be presumptuous to reserve such safeguards to the United States and deny\n\nthem to other nations; and, it is unlikely that such policies will be reviewed by NATO.\n\nRussia\n\nRussiaâs Goals During the Kosovo Conflict*\n\nNATOâs air campaign during the Kosovo conflict aroused intense opposition\n\nacross the entire political spectrum in Russia as well as in the general public.23 It also\n\nposed a serious dilemma for Moscow: how to oppose NATOâs military action without\n\nprovoking a confrontation with the U.S. and NATO Europe. The two prongs of this\n\ndilemma encompass Russiaâs apparent goals during the conflict â and the tension\n\nbetween those goals seriously weakened Moscowâs position.\n\n21Toni Marshall and Bill Gertz. âSubordinate Quashed Clarkâs Orders,â Washington Times,\n\nAugust 3, 1999, p.1.\n\n22Presidential Decision Directive 25.

See below.\n\nCRS-12\n\nRussiaâs cultural, religious, and historical affinity with Serbia24 was mistakenly\n\nhighlighted by most western media as the prime factor behind Moscowâs opposition\n\nto NATOâs bombing. Other factors were almost certainly more important. Until\n\nrecently, the Russian public had been largely unconcerned with foreign policy issues\n\nsuch as NATO enlargement, despite the agitation of political elites. NATOâs bombing\n\nof Yugoslavia, however, stirred deep popular anger,25 to the delight of communists\n\nand ultranationalists who capitalized on it, and to the chagrin of the government and\n\nmoderate politicians who were/are threatened by this development. Besides\n\nemotional and domestic political factors, some Russian leaders are worried by what\n\nthey perceive as a growing NATO military threat approaching their borders while\n\nRussian conventional armed forces are in ruins. Particularly alarming, from this\n\nperspective, is NATOâs decision to use military force without U.N. or OSCE\n\napproval (where Russia would have veto power), to address a human rights situation\n\nin Kosovo that reminds many Russians of their own recent conflict in Chechnya (or\n\nDagestan).26 âRussia could be next,â warn the hardliners. Other Russian leaders\n\nprobably realize that NATO does not pose a threat of military aggression against their\n\ncountry, but are concerned that NATO will act militarily elsewhere without Russian\n\nconsent and possibly against its interests.\n\nFrom this it follows that Russiaâs goals in the conflict were substantially, though\n\nnot entirely, at variance with NATOâs. Russia wanted to bring about a halt to NATO\n\nmilitary action and have the alliance accept the principle that out-of-area military\n\noperations require U.N. approval. Moscow tried to use the Kosovo conflict to divide\n\nand weaken NATO and to strengthen its own ties with China on an anti-U.S. basis.\n\nThese all contradicted U.S. and NATO objectives and policies. Russia also tried to\n\nuse the conflict to demonstrate that it too is an âindispensableâ world power. At the\n\nsame time, Moscow absolutely wanted to avoid being drawn militarily into the conflict\n\nand to prevent escalation or expansion of the conflict that would increase military\n\nrisks to itself â goals shared with NATO. Finally, Russia wanted to avoid having the\n\nKosovo conflict lead to a crisis in relations with the United States and NATO Europe\n\nthat would deny Russia the economic assistance it so urgently needed. NATO also\n\nwanted to maintain stable relations with Russia. Russiaâs warnings to NATO about\n\nKosovo were blunted by its military weakness and its continuing pleas for economic\n\nassistance and debt relief. As NATO unity over Kosovo continued to hold, Moscow\n\nshifted emphasis from its maximal goals (directed against NATO) to the more modest\n\nones (of avoiding worst-case outcomes), through active diplomacy. In the end,\n\nMoscow became a significant player in the diplomatic maneuvering that brought an\n\nend to the conflict, ultimately distancing itself from Belgradeâs positions (and\n\n24Although Russia was central to Serbiaâs winning independence from the Ottoman Empire\n\nin the 19th century and they were allies in both world wars, throughout the most of Cold War\n\nMoscow and Belgrade were enemies. After 1948, the Tito regime viewed the U.S.S.R. as its\n\nmain military threat. Yugoslav military doctrine was based on organized small unit and\n\npartisan warfare in response to a Warsaw Pact invasion.\n\n25This too was largely due to inflammatory anti-NATO reporting by Russian media.\n\n26The comparison between Chechnya and Kosovo is strained. Although Russian conduct in\n\nChechnya, was brutal, it did not involve deliberate âethnic cleansingâ of the local population.\n\nCRS-13\n\nabandoning many of its own loudly proclaimed âprinciplesâ), and perhaps thereby\n\ncontributing to Milosevicâs decision to withdraw his forces from Kosovo.27\n\nThere is ample evidence of Russian cooperation with Serbia. In the early weeks\n\nof the NATO air campaign, Russian news coverage was almost indistinguishable from\n\nSerbian â which helped inflame Russian public opinion in ways that the governing\n\nelites probably soon regretted. (Russian news coverage later became less stridently\n\none-sided, although it was never objective.) There are conflicting accounts as to\n\nwhether Russiaâs electronic intelligence vessel in the Adriatic provided information\n\nto Belgrade, or only to Moscow.28 Two Russian truck convoys of âhumanitarian aidâ\n\nto Yugoslavia were mainly symbolic. But its diplomatic support of Belgrade (until\n\nthe end game) was quite significant. U.S. and NATO sources accused Russiaâs\n\nBalkan envoy and purported intermediary,29 Viktor Chernomyrdin, of colluding with\n\nMilosevic until the final stage of negotiations, leading to Finnish President Ahtisaari\n\nbeing brought in by the West as a more reliable intermediary.\n\nThere is debate and uncertainty in Russia and the West over the June 12 âdashâ\n\nof Russian paratroopers to the Pristina airport. Russian accounts differ as to whether\n\nYeltsin specifically authorized the move in advance.30 Seizing the airport may have\n\nbeen aimed at exerting pressure on NATO to agree to Russian terms for participation\n\nin KFOR, an issue then in heated dispute. Some say the Russian military launched\n\nthe dash to the airport as an expression of disgust at the governmentâs diplomatic\n\nabandonment of Belgrade. The move may reflect a struggle for control among\n\nfactions in Moscow under a weak and disengaged President Yeltsin. Some U.S. and\n\nRussian sources claim that the 200 paratroopers were the vanguard of a much larger\n\nRussian force meant to âdictate facts on the ground,â that was headed off at the last\n\nminute by Washington persuading Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria to cancel or deny\n\noverflight permission for Russian troop transport planes.31\n\n27Some might argue that the above assessment attributes more coherence to Russiaâs policies\n\nthan is warranted. Yeltsin may have made Chernomyrdin his special envoy primarily to\n\nundercut Premier Primakov, who was viewed increasingly by the Kremlin as an enemy.\n\nChernomyrdinâs acquiescence in NATOâs key demands appeared to contradict the Primakov\n\ngovernmentâs policy.\n\n28See, for example, âRussia ... Verifying Yugoslav Intelligence Reports?â Jamestown\n\nMonitor, April 8, 1999.\n\n29Neither Washington nor Brussels were pleased with Moscowâs self-intrusion as an\n\nintermediary, but apparently felt obliged to accept a diplomatic fait accompli.\n\n30âYeltsin Knew of Armyâs Kosovo Plan,â UPI, June 15, 1999; Gennady Charodeyev\n\nâVladimir Lukin: Order Could Have Been Given By One Man Only â President,â Izvestia,\n\nJune 15, 1999.\n\n31Robert Kaiser and David Hoffman, âRussia Had Bigger Plan In Kosovo; U.S.\n\nThwarted a Larger, Secret Troop Deployment,â Washington Post, June 25, 1999, p.\n\nA1; âRussian Intentions in Kosovo Questioned,â Jamestown Monitor, July 6, 1999.\n\nCRS-14\n\nThe Kosovo Conflict and NATO-Russia Relations*\n\nFrom NATOâs perspective, aspects of Russiaâs role in the Kosovo conflict were\n\nboth hostile and helpful. Russiaâs harsh criticism of the NATO air campaign and its\n\nveiled threats almost certainly increased apprehension of some NATO allies and\n\nweakened alliance cohesion (though probably less than Moscow expected, adding to\n\nRussian frustration). This was likely one of Moscowâs objectives. On the other hand,\n\nMoscowâs decision to participate in NATO/EU diplomacy as an intermediary with\n\nBelgrade tended to dampen those fears among allies. Assessments vary as to the\n\nimportance of Russiaâs role in bringing Milosevic to accept NATOâs terms, but there\n\nseems little doubt that Russiaâs active diplomatic engagement enhanced NATO\n\nsolidarity as the bombing campaign continued and collateral damage and civilian\n\ncasualties increased.\n\nThe Kosovo conflict laid open a key contradiction in NATOâs relationship with\n\nRussia, i.e., although the NATO-Russia Founding Act and the Permanent Joint\n\nCouncil create the veneer of treating Russia and NATO as equals, in reality, NATO\n\ndoes not regard or treat Russia as its equal. As the Kosovo conflict continued, it\n\nfurther damaged already strained relations between NATO and Russia. On one side,\n\nyears of NATO efforts to convince Moscow that the alliance was not a military threat\n\nto its security were undermined. On the other side, western concerns about Russian\n\nintentions and reliability were reinforced. Russian political leaders assert that the\n\ncountry must increase defense spending and preparedness to counter the alleged\n\nNATO threat.32 Russia has âfrozenâ most military relations and cooperation with\n\nNATO.33 Russian officials state more baldly than ever, their intention to try to use the\n\nNATO-Russia Joint Council as a means of expanding Russian influence over NATO\n\nmilitary decisions, and failing that, to withdraw from the Joint Council. Russian\n\nparticipation in KFOR, if it follows the Bosnian model, could over time help ease\n\nsome of the tension in military cooperation. Also, in recent weeks the Putin\n\ngovernment seems to have toned down Moscowâs rhetoric about a âred lineâ that\n\nNATO dare not cross by admitting former Soviet republics such as the Baltic states\n\nto alliance membership.34\n\nSome would argue that Russiaâs response to the Kosovo conflict raises larger\n\nquestions about the compatibility of Russian and U.S./NATO interests and the long-\n\nterm prospects for cooperation with Russia in bringing stability and reconciliation to\n\nCentral and Eastern Europe. Advocates of this view maintain that there were strong\n\nelements of Soviet-style âold thinkingâ in Moscowâs approach to the conflict.\n\n*Prepared by (name redacted), Specialist in Soviet Affairs.\n\n32It is unclear whether Moscow has the financial means to implement these plans at this time,\n\ngiven its economic weakness, heavy debt burden, and need to satisfy IMF conditions to\n\ncontinue receiving urgently needed credits.\n\n33In late July, Russiaâs Ambassador to NATO returned to Brussels and resumed Permanent\n\nJoint Council meetings, primarily to deal with KFOR issues. Most other Russia-NATO\n\ncontact is still on hold.\n\n34Moscow still strongly opposes the accession of former Soviet states to NATO.\n\nCRS-15\n\nNATO Capabilities and Burdensharing\n\nGaps in U.S.-European Military Capabilities*\n\nMany military leaders, both U.S. and European, have pointed out significant gaps\n\nin the capabilities between the U.S. and allied military forces. Lieutenant General\n\nMichael Short (USAF), who commanded the air operation over Kosovo, and both the\n\ncurrent and former Chairmen of NATOâs Military Committee, Italyâs Admiral\n\nVenturoni and Germanyâs General Naumann have all warned that NATO is in danger\n\nof becoming a âtwo-tieredâ alliance. Gen. Short has noted that capability shortfalls\n\naffected targeting assignments in Operation Allied Force, and necessitated greater\n\nreliance on U.S. assets â particularly for accurate night bombing runs.35 Both\n\nGeneral Naumann and Admiral Venturoni have stated that, given their current military\n\ncapabilities, the European members of NATO could not have undertaken the Kosovo\n\nmission without U.S. participation. This is an assessment that places the viability of\n\nthe European Joint Combined Task force, and indeed the concept of a European\n\nSecurity and Defense Identity, in question.\n\nThe shortfalls that have been identified in the initial assessments of Operations\n\nAllied Force include:\n\n! Precision-guided munitions;\n\n! Laser-designator capability;\n\n! Secure interoperable communications;\n\n! High-fidelity Identification Friend or Foe systems;\n\n! Electronic warfare capabilities;\n\n! Air defense threat warning systems;\n\n! Intelligence collection and dissemination (operational and tactical);\n\n! Heavy airlift;\n\n! Aerial refuelers;\n\n! Night-vision capability.\n\nDuring its 50th anniversary Summit in April 1999, NATO undertook the Defense\n\nCapability Initiative (DCI) to identify capability shortfalls and recommend remedies.\n\nNATO headquarters intends to feed the Kosovo after-action assessments into this\n\neffort. Looking at the areas the DCI was directed to examine, it is clear that many of\n\nthe shortfalls had been identified before Operation Allied Force, but it is not clear that\n\nthe European allies will be able to correct them, if current defense budget trends (flat\n\nor declining) continue. At present, the combined defense procurement for Canada and\n\nNATOâs European allies is about one-half the U.S. procurement budget, while\n\ndefense research and development is only about one-third of the U.S. investment.\n\nEuropean defense investments also suffer inefficiencies owing to duplicative national\n\nprograms, the failure to harmonize national defense requirements, and differing\n\napproaches to defense industry ownership and investment. A recent General\n\nAccounting Office report does not offer an optimistic assessment of the NATO alliesâ\n\n*Prepared by (name redacted), Specialist in National Defense.\n\n35âAllies Need Upgrade, General Says,â Washington Post, June 20, 1999, p. 20.\n\nCRS-16\n\nability to improve military capabilities without significant national budget\n\nrestructuring.36\n\nSpeed of U.S. Ground Force Deployments and Employments*\n\nThe only major deployment of U.S. ground combat units during Operation\n\nAllied Force was Task Force Hawk. The deployment was initially announced April\n\n4, 1999 and was expected to take 10 days. It took, however, until April 21st to\n\ncomplete, and its offensive core â AH-64A Apache helicopters and the ATACM\n\nmissile systems â were never employed. Once announced, the Task Forceâs\n\ndeployment and activities became a focus of the press, and a subject of controversy.\n\nGen. Wesley Clark, SACEUR, requested the AH-64s shortly before the air campaign\n\nbegan, and initially their deployment time was estimated at 10 days. It eventually took\n\nalmost three weeks for the unitâs full deployment to Tirane, Albania. The Apache\n\npilots then underwent an intensive training program to familiarize them with the\n\nterrain and the combat load for their aircraft. The order to employ the Apaches was\n\nnever given, and Allied Force ended without their participation.\n\nA variety of reasons have been offered for the delays in Task Force Hawkâs\n\ndeployment. The AH-64s alone were capable of deploying from Germany to Albania\n\nwithin 72 hours, however they were only a portion of the task force. Gen. Clark\n\nreportedly requested the AH-64s prior to the onset of the air campaign.37 They were\n\nto be based in Macedonia along with other NATO ground forces preparing for\n\nKFOR. The Macedonian government, however, objected to the presence of attack\n\nhelicopters, and the deployment was changed to Albania. This change had several\n\nconsequences. First, force protection became a more important consideration.\n\nAlbania was judged a less secure environment than Macedonia, and consequently\n\nTask Force Hawk was beefed up to include mechanized infantry, armor, and the\n\nArmyâs ATACMS surface-to-surface missile system. This, in turn, increased the\n\nassembly time, and increased the number of air transport sorties required three-fold.\n\nThe inadequacies of the Tirane, Albania airport created a major chokepoint. The\n\nairport could accommodate only one C-5 or two C-17 transport aircraft on the\n\nground at one time, and Task Force Hawk required over 150 aircraft sorties. Initially,\n\nit was also unable to handle night landings or take-offs. Then hardened helipads had\n\nto be constructed because heavy rains had turned the base area into a sea of mud.\n\nFurther complicating the situation, the flow of refugees from Kosovo into Albania had\n\nmade refugee assistance the first priority for Tiraneâs limited air cargo capacity.\n\nWith the press closely following Task Force Hawkâs deployment, its arrival in\n\nAlbania led to the expectation that it would be immediately employed. It was assumed\n\nthat the Apacheâs would move against the Serb ground forces in Kosovo which had\n\nproven difficult for the Air Force to locate and destroy. Here again the last-minute\n\ndecision to base the helicopters in Albania rather than Macedonia played a role.

Helicopters become much more difficult to fly at higher\n\naltitudes, particularly with the additional fuel tanks that would be required for\n\nmissions into Kosovo. Consequently, several weeks of intensive training were\n\nundertaken. Also, more experienced pilots from U.S.-based units were added to the\n\ntask force. It should be noted that in testimony before the House Armed Services\n\nCommittee, Brig. Gen. Cody of Task Force Hawk, acknowledged that only Army\n\nSpecial Operations helicopter pilots are trained to operate âfrom a standing start,â so\n\nthat Task Force Hawkâs training period was not necessarily unusual.38\n\nEven with the completion of this training, the AH-64s were not employed, and\n\npress reports indicate that resistance within DOD and the Army staff was a factor.39\n\nReportedly, Pentagon officials were not convinced that Gen. Clarkâs intended mission\n\nfor the Apaches â to attack dug-in Serb ground forces â was appropriate or worth\n\nthe risk. There had been some resistance to the mission from the first, indicated by\n\nDODâs agreeing to the deployment, but insisting the AH-64s not be employed without\n\nPentagon approval. The mountainous terrain, the fact that Serb forces knew where\n\nthe helicopters were based and which approaches they would have to use, and the\n\ndensity of air defenses in the region, all contributed to this caution. The ATACMs\n\nhad been included in Task Force Hawk to suppress air defenses prior to Apache\n\nmissions, but there was a concern that significant collateral casualties could result\n\nfrom their use, which further complicated the employment decision.\n\nSome elements of Task Force Hawk, however, did participate in offensive\n\noperations. Artillery/ATACMS support radars and ground intelligence assessment\n\nelements were able to pinpoint Serb artillery positions for Air Force strike aircraft.\n\nThe AH-64s and other elements of Task Force eventually transferred to Macedonia\n\nand Kosovo to participate in Operation Joint Guardian (KFOR).\n\nIn sum, Task Force Hawkâs experience was affected by political concerns that\n\naltered basing arrangements, inadequate transhipment facilities at its destination (and\n\ncompeting priorities for those facilities), severe terrain challenges, and concerns within\n\nDOD over the risk/benefit analysis of their intended mission.\n\nNATOâs New Members*\n\nPoland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic became full members of NATO on\n\nMarch 12, 1999. Less than two weeks later, NATO embarked on Operation Allied\n\nForce against Yugoslavia, catching some of the new membersâ governments and\n\npopulations by surprise. Although the three new members provided only modest\n\nmaterial support to the U.S.-dominated air operation, their positions and roles during\n\nthe NATO operation have been viewed by many as their first test as new NATO\n\nmembers, with possible consequences for NATOâs further enlargement. None of the\n\nthree countries contributed combat forces or support aircraft to the air campaign. All\n\n38House Armed Services Hearing, June 29, 1999.\n\n39Army Times, August 16, 1999.

Of the three, Poland was arguably the most enthusiastic, but\n\nalso the most removed from the Kosovo conflict. The Polish government gave strong\n\nsupport to the NATO mission, backed by strong public approval ratings (ranging from\n\nabout 50% to over 60%)40 and consensus across the political spectrum. The Polish\n\ngovernment stated that NATOâs military action was justified, after diplomatic efforts\n\nhad been exhausted, in order to stop the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo and halt Serbian\n\naggression. In April, Poland deployed a unit of 140 troops to NATOâs humanitarian\n\noperation in Albania. The Polish government offered full access to Polandâs airports\n\nby NATO aircraft participating in Allied Force.\n\nHungary, the only NATO member sharing a border with Yugoslavia and having\n\ndirect national interests at stake, had a mixed response to NATOâs action against\n\nYugoslavia. After some hesitation, Hungary provided NATO with use of its airspace\n\nand air field facilities, which NATO used to launch some of its air strikes. During the\n\nJune standoff between NATO and Russian peacekeepers at the Pristina airport,\n\nHungary was the first country to deny Russia overflight rights to reinforce its\n\npeacekeepers. At the same time, the Hungarian government remained highly\n\nconcerned about the fate of the substantial ethnic Hungarian minority in the northern\n\nSerbian province of Vojvodina. It objected to (but did not block) NATOâs air strikes\n\nagainst Serb targets located in the Vojvodina. It has appealed for NATO protection\n\nof the Vojvodina Hungarians and for the issue of autonomy for Vojvodina to be\n\naddressed at an international level. Beyond air strikes, the government and parliament\n\nremained openly opposed to participating in or approving a possible NATO ground\n\ninvasion of Yugoslavia, part of which was expected to be launched from Hungary.\n\nA majority of Hungarians supported the NATO air campaign in public opinion polls,\n\nalthough a majority also opposed a NATO ground invasion of Yugoslavia and feared\n\nthat the conflict could spill over into Hungarian territory.\n\nPolitical leaders in the Czech Republic expressed conflicting views of the NATO\n\nair campaign. In April, the Czech government publicly rejected the possibility of\n\nCzech army participation in a possible NATO ground operation in Yugoslavia. In\n\nMay, Foreign Minister Jan Kavan and his Greek counterpart proposed a Kosovo\n\npeace initiative that included, among other things, a pause in the air strikes before all\n\nof NATOâs demands were met. Some NATO officials reportedly viewed that\n\ninitiative as counter-productive.41 Within the opposition, former premier and current\n\nparliamentary leader Vaclav Klaus was outspokenly opposed to the NATO air\n\ncampaign. Opinion polls showed the Czech public to be either divided equally for or\n\nagainst, or with a majority against, the NATO operation during the course of the air\n\ncampaign. In contrast, President Havel expressed strong support for the NATO\n\n40Opinion surveys showed that Poles were more divided on the question of introducing NATO\n\nground combat troops into Yugoslavia.\n\n41CTK news agency, in FBIS-EEU, May 26, 1999.\n\nCRS-19\n\ncampaign and criticized the government for creating an ambiguous impression of\n\nCzech support. In June, Havel became the first head of state to visit Kosovo after the\n\nend of the NATO operation. Notwithstanding the wobbly political rhetoric, the\n\nCzech Republic granted NATO use of its airspace, transit through its territory, and\n\nairports and other transportation facilities during the air campaign. It also contributed\n\na field hospital to Albania in response to the refugee crisis in that country.\n\nIn contrast to the air campaign, the three new NATO members fully expected to\n\nparticipate in an eventual NATO-led peacekeeping operation in Kosovo. Three and\n\none-half years of experience serving a similar mission in NATOâs Stabilization Force\n\n(SFOR) in Bosnia, prior to attaining full NATO membership, provided a key\n\nprecedent. To KFOR, Poland offered an 800-strong landing battalion, Hungary a\n\n320-man engineering battalion, and the Czech Republic a company of 150 personnel.\n\nKFOR contributing nations each assume the costs of their deployments. Some or all\n\nof the three may also contribute personnel to the international police force or to other\n\ninternational civilian missions. In addition to the troop and personnel contributions,\n\nall of the new NATO members accepted Kosovar refugees (either directly or through\n\norganized evacuations from Macedonia), and have provided humanitarian aid. Polish\n\nForeign Minister Bronislaw Geremek has urged a concerted and massive international\n\neffort to reconstruct and transform southeastern Europe.42\n\nOperation Allied Force offered several possible lessons to the new NATO\n\nmembers. The operation demonstrated to the new allies the risks, obligations, and\n\nexpectations, not just the security benefits, associated with alliance membership.\n\nLevels of political and popular support for the operation varied, a phenomenon similar\n\nto the experience of other NATO member states. The governments of the new allies\n\nmay consider doing more to prepare their populations in advance of future such\n\noperations. They may consider developing combat forces that could participate\n\ndirectly in similar campaigns. The new NATO members appear to be better prepared\n\npolitically and militarily for peacekeeping missions, as demonstrated by their\n\nparticipation in KFOR as well as SFOR in Bosnia. In turn, many observers consider\n\nthat the participation of these countries and other NATO partner countries in such\n\noperations enhances their military integration into the alliance. However, some\n\nobservers question whether future new members should have already developed\n\nadditional capabilities that could contribute to NATOâs future missions.\n\nNATO and Future Threats\n\nThe Implications of Allied Force for U.S. NATO Leadership*\n\nThe Kosovo conflict evoked a range of responses from the European allies,\n\nwhich nonetheless remained unified during the operation. Each of the 19 allies\n\nendorsed the objectives of the war. All the key allies â Britain, France, Germany,\n\nand Italy â have left or center-left governments, which until recently might have been\n\n42âHow to Rebuild Bridges,â The Financial Times, June\n\n*Prepared by Paul E. Gallis, Specialist in European Affairs.\n\nCRS-20\n\nreluctant to engage in allied combat operations for any purpose other than collective\n\ndefense. At the same time, unease over U.S. leadership was apparent in some\n\ngovernments, and a European security and defense identity (ESDI) received measured\n\nimpetus.\n\nContinuing Importance of Unity. Despite the end of the Cold War, NATO\n\nmembers continue to view the alliance as central to their security, given the inability\n\nof the European Union (EU) to build a credible defense and foreign policy capability.\n\nThe European allies saw the threat from Kosovo, as with the conflict in Bosnia and\n\nCroatia in the early and mid-1990s, to be instability caused by virulently nationalistic\n\nideas emanating from Yugoslavia, and by refugee flows that have caused social\n\ntensions and exacted significant budgetary outlays. A moral dimension â revulsion\n\nto ethnic cleansing â also caused them to act. Even governments leading countries\n\nwith the luxury of geographic distance from Yugoslavia, or with populations\n\nunsympathetic to NATOâs objectives, maintained a unified front over Kosovo because\n\nthe alliance remains central to their security.\n\nA Range of Viewpoints.43 Among the allies, questions abound over U.S.\n\nleadership of Allied Force. Some allies had raised questions about U.S. leadership\n\nover Balkan issues in the early 1990s. Then, French and British officials criticized\n\nU.S. reluctance to place peacekeeping forces on the ground in Bosnia to prevent\n\nviolence against the civilian population, and the U.S. decision to use air power alone\n\nagainst Yugoslav forces to achieve allied objectives. For some European countries,\n\nthe potential repercussions of instability in the Balkans are sufficient justification for\n\nsending ground forces for peacekeeping into the region.\n\nAmong governments strongly supportive of Allied Force, the perception is\n\ncommon that British Prime Minister Blairâs government, and not the Clinton\n\nAdministration, provided the key political leadership. As the air campaign wore on\n\nwithout clear results, the Blair government pressed for an introduction of NATO\n\nground forces. While most allied governments may not have supported the use of\n\nground forces, they gave high marks to Blair and his foreign and defense ministers for\n\nforceful articulation of European interests at stake in the Balkans. Blair also carried\n\nhis message to smaller NATO countries, where he spoke on a number of occasions\n\nto bolster several governments, a step that raised his profile as a leader. In Britain one\n\ninfluential strategist who has long supported the alliance contended that the war\n\ndemonstrated that Europeans are âfar too dependent on the United States.â He noted\n\nthat while the United States was supplying the strategy and firepower, âAmerica does\n\nnot have the same interests in the outcome of a European war as those living in the\n\nregion.â The Clinton Administration, in his view, had become a âhesitantâ leader, not\n\nfully sharing its alliesâ long-term risks, and would not send the ground forces essential\n\nfor victory. If the war failed in its objectives, the Europeans would be left with over\n\none million refugees and a highly destabilized region.44 The Blair government remains\n\nstrongly committed to NATO, but Blair, unlike his predecessors, has become a\n\n43See also Library of Congress.

The conflict evoked a candid assessment in France of the\n\ncountryâs distinctive relationship to NATO. France, not a member of NATOâs\n\nintegrated command structure and long critical of aspects of U.S. leadership of the\n\nalliance, nonetheless placed its forces under SACEUR. French government officials\n\nand journalists alike acknowledged that the United States provided the military\n\ncapability key to successful resolution of the conflict. The French altered a\n\nlongstanding view that a U.N. mandate was necessary for all non-Article V NATO\n\nactions. At the same time, some concluded that Franceâs effective participation in the\n\nconflict proved that the country need not join the integrated command structure, and\n\nthat U.S. hesitancy in leading the alliance demonstrated the need for ESDI.45\n\nGermanyâs participation in NATO air strikes marked the first time since World\n\nWar II that German forces have engaged in combat operations. Of central concern\n\nin Germany was the flow of refugees and moral issues raised by ethnic cleansing. At\n\nsubstantial expense, Germany housed over 300,000 refugees during the conflict in\n\nBosnia; their presence caused social tensions. Today, of particular importance,\n\nChancellor SchrÃ¶derâs government includes the traditionally pacifist Greens, whose\n\nleader Joschka Fischer, now foreign minister, vigorously supported Allied Force.\n\nGerman leaders strongly opposed the use of ground forces in Kosovo. The German\n\ngovernment also claims substantial credit for involving Russia in mediation efforts and\n\nthe resulting peace accord. A clear consensus in Germany continues to view both\n\nNATO and the EU as indispensable to a stable and prosperous Europe.\n\nThe Italian government faced difficult issues in participating in Allied Force. The\n\ncenter-left government of former communist Massimo DâAlema had within it elements\n\nsharply critical of the United States and of the use of military force; at the same time,\n\nItalyâs geographic position made it highly vulnerable to refugee flows. After wavering\n\nearly in the conflict, the DâAlema government strongly supported Allied Force,\n\nparticipated in the air campaign, and took a leading role in the care of refugees in\n\nAlbania and Macedonia. The defense minister stated during the war that Italy would\n\nsupport a NATO decision for a ground campaign, even at the cost of losing coalition\n\npartners. DâAlema ultimately saw resolution of the conflict as a key to ensuring\n\nintegration of the Balkans into a democratic, stable Europe, and NATO (and the EU)\n\nas important instruments in that process.46\n\n45Jean-Michel Boucheron (rapporteur), âLe CoÃ»t de la participation de la France aux\n\nopÃ©rations menÃ©es en vue du rÃ¨glement de la crise au Kosovo,â Committee for Finances,\n\nEconomy, and Planning.

At the\n\nsame time, Greek officials warned that the war raised the broader implication of\n\nâchanging borders on behalf of minorities,â should Kosovo ultimately seek\n\nindependence. In the Greek governmentâs view, such a development could spur\n\ninstability in Europe.47\n\nESDI. While some governments were quietly critical of the Administration for\n\nnot providing more public, forceful leadership of Allied Force, there remains a clear\n\nconsensus that the campaign could not have been carried out without the United\n\nStates formulating a strategy and leading allied militaries. The United States remains,\n\nalone among the allies, both capable and willing to undertake large-scale military\n\nconflicts. Nonetheless, U.S. hesitancy to use ground forces has left some allied\n\ngovernments â most clearly Britain, France, and Italy â with the sentiment that the\n\nUnited States does not share equally European concerns about such destabilizing\n\ndevelopments as the flow of refugees and ethnic nationalism. A clear impetus for\n\nESDI is the recognition among European governments that there is a gap in capability\n\nbetween their militaries and that of the United States, and that they must improve their\n\ncapability in the event that U.S. forces may not join them in a future conflict. Several\n\ncountries are building multinational units and more mobile forces both for NATO and\n\nfor possible use by the European Union.\n\nSignificant obstacles to ESDI remain. The Europeans have no clear leaders in\n\nforeign and security policy. Most smaller NATO and EU members, concerned about\n\ndomination by one of the larger member states, greatly prefer U.S. leadership from\n\nafar to political elbowing from a neighbor. Several EU countries, are not in NATO,\n\nare non-aligned, and oppose close coordination of defense policy. A commitment to\n\ngreater defense spending or to a convergence of defense industries to build more\n\ncapable mobile forces is lacking; the defense spending of all European allies amounts\n\nto only 60% of the U.S. defense budget. Finally, the EU decision-making process\n\nremains cumbersome, given the weight provided to smaller states and the absence of\n\nconsensus over a leader.48\n\nAllied Force and Non-Article V Missions*\n\nA clear consensus in the alliance supports collective defense, enshrined in Article\n\nV of the North Atlantic Treaty, as NATOâs central mission. In the new Strategic\n\nConcept, adopted at the NATO summit in April 1999 in the midst of the Kosovo\n\nconflict, the allies also expressed support for new (or ânon-Article Vâ) missions, such\n\nas humanitarian assistance and crisis management.

Gallis, Specialist in European Affairs.\n\nCRS-23\n\nnew missions raises the issue of whether the allies will be as committed to supporting\n\nthem as they have been in support of collective defense.\n\nNon-Article V Missions. In the year preceding the summit, Administration\n\nofficials raised the possibility that NATO should undertake missions in the Middle\n\nEast and elsewhere beyond Europe to combat international terrorism or meet the\n\nthreat of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. This viewpoint was also\n\nexpressed in the U.S. Senate during the NATO enlargement debate in the form of the\n\nKyl Amendment, which passed by a wide margin.49 In general, the Europeans oppose\n\nmissions beyond Europe, fearing dilution of NATOâs original purpose and voicing\n\nconcern that NATO might become the âglobal instrumentâ of the United States. They\n\nprefer to confront such issues as terrorism and proliferation through political\n\ninitiatives rather than military action. The Strategic Concept ultimately reflected the\n\nEuropeansâ more guarded view of the allianceâs new missions. To most European\n\ngovernments, the Kosovo conflict underscored that principal threats to security come\n\nfrom close at home, in the form of instability in the Balkans. European governments\n\njoined Allied Force due to concern over instability and in response to the âmoralâ\n\nissue of stopping ethnic cleansing.\n\nConsensus-building. While consensus over collective defense remains strong,\n\nit is more difficult to achieve for missions such as crisis management. Defense\n\nSecretary Cohen has said that there was no consensus in the alliance for anything\n\nmore than an air campaign to contain ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, and that any effort\n\nto launch a ground war would have led to a âfractious debate,â with a possible loss\n\nof allied unity.50 Milosevicâs inability to split the allies in waging the air campaign was\n\nlikely a key factor in his governmentâs decision to abandon the conflict.\n\nFrom a military perspective, allied unity was clearly important for winning the\n\nwar. That unity allowed NATO to stage most of its air strike missions from Italy, to\n\nsend air support missions from Hungary, and to prevent Russian forces from securing\n\noverflight rights into Kosovo at the end of the war from states friendly to the alliance.\n\nItalian, Czech, and Hungarian leaders expressed early reservations about the\n\nconflict, and Greek public opinion remained critical of NATO. While a supposition\n\nthat cannot be proven, it is possible, should the air campaign have failed to achieve\n\nallied objectives, that an absence of unity fostered by a need to send ground forces\n\nunder a âcoalition of the willingâ would have seen countries such as Italy deny the use\n\nof its air bases, and Greece the use of its ports â both close to the area of operations.\n\nFurther, such opposition might have made more difficult NATOâs effort to secure\n\noverflight rights from Bulgaria and Romania, which proved of significance during\n\nAllied Force. In missions short of collective defense involving combat forces,\n\nconsensus may prove difficult to achieve, but if achieved its corresponding political\n\neffects could be central to success.\n\n49See Library of Congress.

Unpaginated manuscript.\n\nCRS-24\n\nRole of the U.N. As in the conflict in Bosnia and Croatia in the early 1990s, the\n\nEuropeans have sought a U.N. imprimatur for non-Article V missions. The recent\n\nhistory of two world wars in which flimsy rationales were given for crossing borders\n\nhas led the European allies to be extremely cautious in approaching issues that might\n\nrequire violation of another countryâs sovereignty. Hence, âlegitimizationâ by the\n\nU.N. for a military operation in a sovereign country has been important to the allies.\n\nIn addition, the U.N. is a forum where NATO countries may engage Russia in matters\n\nof European security, yet another interest of the allies. The United States has opposed\n\nany requirement of U.N. approval for non-Article V missions, in part due to concern\n\nthat Russia or China might veto actions intended to protect critical allied interests.\n\nThe Kosovo conflict saw the European allies step away from their insistence of\n\nU.N. approval for non-Article V missions. The French government, for example,\n\nstrongly supported U.N. resolutions in the fall of 1998 condemning the FRYâs\n\nviolence against civilians in Kosovo, but reportedly concluded that returning to the\n\nSecurity Council at a later point for endorsement of NATO military action would have\n\nled to a Russian veto. Prime Minister Jospin, in explaining the French decision to go\n\nto war in March 1999, said: âSince the Security Council was not able to act, we must\n\nact on our responsibilities.â Similarly, a French parliamentary report after the conflict\n\ndismissed the U.N. as an âoldâ institution once useful in maintaining the Cold War\n\nbalance, but now tied up by political maneuvering and bureaucratic delay. The report\n\ngave its guarded approval to the âpolitical revolutionâ allowing NATO to intervene\n\nin a sovereign country to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe.51 Such sentiments were\n\nnoticeable in several other key NATO states.\n\nAt the same time, an interest remains among the allies in securing U.N.\n\ninvolvement in international issues that may not require a rapid response to a crisis,\n\nfor example in the administration of post-war Kosovo.\n\nFuture Missions. While military action against the FRY was unlikely without\n\nU.S. leadership, the Kosovo conflict did signal that most European allies were willing\n\nto use their militaries on the continent to prevent âhumanitarian catastrophesâ such\n\nas ethnic cleansing. However, it remains unclear that there is a consensus in the\n\nUnited States that engagement in Kosovo was in the U.S. interest. Increased\n\ndiscussion in Europe of ESDI is a manifestation of the alliesâ recognition that\n\nsignificant elements of U.S. political leadership are hesitant about the use of American\n\ncombat forces for such a mission, and that Europeans must be prepared to act alone.\n\nA political result of the Kosovo conflict may be that consensus in the alliance is\n\nstrengthened over the need to develop Combined Joint Task Forces, where a\n\nâcoalition of the willingâ might borrow NATO (primarily U.S.) assets such as lift and\n\nsatellite intelligence to fight a military engagement, perhaps without involvement of\n\nU.S. combat forces.52 Still lacking in Europe is the political will to marshal the\n\n51Claire TrÃ©an, âLes rÃ©solutions de lâONU donnent une base lÃ©gale Ã lâintervention,â Le\n\nMonde, March 28-29, 1999, p. 2; and Boucheron, op. cit., p. 4.\n\n52Lt.

Since the last chapter in\n\nKosovo and Yugoslavia has not been written, any current perceived lessons might\n\nnot be the final ones.\n\nNATO is in transition and its future role is still being defined. Therefore,\n\nNATOâs performance is likely to have been watched with keen interest by potential\n\nadversaries. The lessons drawn are important, especially since other countries in the\n\nBalkans, Europe, and the world have volatile mixes of racial and ethnic groups living\n\nin uneasy coexistence. The combination of ethnic tensions, competing historical claims\n\nand grievances, and economic problems makes many countries and regions susceptible\n\nto potential strife that could severely undermine regional stability and international\n\nsecurity. One of NATOâs seeming aims in Yugoslavia was to discourage other\n\npotential perpetrators of ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.\n\nThe alliance has achieved its primary objectives in Yugoslavia. Ethnic cleansing\n\nhas been reversed by NATOâs military action. Yugoslavia has been forced to pay a\n\nhigh price for the actions of the Milosevic regime. If the alliance had not prevailed\n\nin Yugoslavia, many observers believe that this would have seriously damaged its\n\ncredibility with friends and foes alike. If NATO had failed to muster the political will\n\nto prevail over a relatively small and weak opponent, other potential adversaries might\n\nhave calculated that NATO would not act against future serious challenges.\n\nNATOâs success and the overwhelming condemnation and isolation of\n\nYugoslavia by the world community (only China, Russia, and India sought to block\n\nmilitary action against Milosevic) could give pause to any regime that might be\n\ntempted to challenge significant NATO interests, especially any regime attracted to\n\nthe notion of dealing with racial and ethnic problems along the Milosevic lines.\n\nPotential adversaries may no longer feel safe behind a shield of sovereignty, free\n\nto carry out any actions in violation of international norms inside their own borders.\n\nNATO took military action against Yugoslavia without ever disputing its claim to\n\nsovereignty over Kosovo, thereby reinforcing an emerging consensus against viewing\n\nsovereignty as a single overriding international principle.\n\nPotential adversaries are likely to be deterred by the fact that NATO was able\n\nto agree on military action and maintain unity throughout the campaign despite\n\ndifferent perspectives and interests among member nations and hesitancy by most to\n\nspur to military role for EU,â IHT, April 30-May 1, 1999, p. 2.\n\n*Prepared by (name redacted), Specialist in International Relations.\n\nCRS-26\n\nuse military force. They are also likely to be impressed by NATOâs ability and\n\nwillingness to bring in massive air power once the decision was made.\n\nHowever, the deterrent effect of Operation Allied Force is likely to be uneven.\n\nThe impact is likely to be greatest in and perhaps even limited to Europe where\n\nNATO is most willing and able to act. NATOâs success may make less of an\n\nimpression in other parts of the world, especially where significant U.S. or allied\n\ninterests are not perceived to be at stake. The alliance has not acted in the face of\n\nhumanitarian tragedies in Africa and elsewhere and potential adversaries probably\n\nwould not expect any different NATO reaction as a result of Kosovo.\n\nSome potential adversaries might be encouraged by the difficulty that NATO had\n\nin building the political consensus to act, its hesitancy to escalate the war, and its\n\nextreme reluctance to commit ground forces. Some countries might calculate that\n\ngiven the difficulty NATO faced in carrying out the Yugoslav operation, the alliance\n\nwould be even more reluctant than before to take military action outside of Europe.\n\nFuture adversaries may study the tactical successes Milosevic gained because\n\nNATO adopted tactics emphasizing casualty avoidance. He was able to preserve\n\nYugoslav air defenses and to hide many other weapons systems. They may wonder\n\nif Milosevic could have used other asymmetric measures to weaken allied unity, such\n\nas threatening attacks or the use of weapons of mass destruction against other\n\nnations.\n\nFinally, the notion that the international community can take action against\n\ngovernments for their acts inside their own territory when they involve crimes against\n\nhumanity are not universally shared. Russia, China, and India opposed NATOâs\n\naction primarily on sovereignty grounds. India actually used the example of\n\nYugoslavia as justification for its own decision to develop nuclear weapons. Some\n\nhave suggested that NATOâs action could be an impetus for nuclear and chemical\n\nwarfare proliferation by other countries seeking to deter outside interference.\n\nConclusion*\n\nNATO members clearly placed a high priority on political unity in the effort to\n\nachieve the objectives of Allied Force. Political unity limited Milosevicâs freedom of\n\naction, put pressure on Russiaâs capricious leadership structure to accede to allied\n\ndemands, and helped to build a network of support among non-allied states bordering\n\nYugoslavia. At the same time, the emphasis on preserving political unity meant that\n\nU.S. military leaders could not fight the war in a manner that would have followed\n\nU.S. military doctrine, in hopes of bringing about a rapid resolution of the conflict.\n\nNATO fought the Kosovo war as a limited conflict, in which measured\n\nobjectives and operational restraint gave the adversary freedom to maneuver for time,\n\n*Prepared by Paul E. Gallis.\n\nCRS-27\n\nexploit openings, destabilize neighboring countries, and brutalize Kosovoâs civilian\n\npopulation.\n\nThe allies fought for a diversity of interests, of greater importance to some than\n\nto others. The moral issue of preventing, then reversing, a humanitarian catastrophe\n\nwas a new interest, at least in the sense of one prompting military action. But it was\n\na limited interest, one that did not seem to require to most allies the need to risk\n\ncasualties by engaging ground forces or fighting the air war at lower altitudes. For\n\nEuropean allies, concern over refugee flows and instability was also clearly an interest,\n\nbut again not one that demanded more than a measured military response. Critics from\n\nwithin NATO countries of the way the war was fought were troubled that the passion\n\nof allied rhetoric was not matched, in their view, by an intensity of military tactics and\n\ndegree of risk. Some concluded that NATOâs strategy and tactics allowed President\n\nClinton to engage the United States in a conflict without clear, preliminary support\n\nof Congress and the American people.53\n\nNATOâs decision to attack Yugoslavia signalled that the allies would consider\n\nmilitary action in response to a governmentâs violence against its own people. Most\n\nallies, led by Britain, clearly no longer regard a claim of sovereignty as a shield against\n\na military response by other states. This principle is far from universally accepted,\n\nparticularly in countries such as Russia, China, and India that have restive populations\n\nwithin their territory, and which demand U.N. approval for NATO action.\n\nPotential adversaries were clearly put on guard by Allied Force. While some\n\nadversaries may be deflected from aggressive action that challenges NATO interests,\n\nothers, especially states more powerful than Yugoslavia, may have gathered lessons\n\nof their own about how to weaken NATO unity, or to build on Milosevicâs military\n\ntactics to protect forces, or even be encouraged to obtain weapons able to deter the\n\nalliance. States beyond the European region may be less intimidated by Allied Force.\n\nThe conflict left the allies with a range of military needs and political challenges.\n\nMore clearly than before, some allies acknowledged the need for more sophisticated\n\nweaponry and more mobile forces, and even called for a commitment to a stronger\n\nEuropean security and defense identity as an imperative to ensure greater\n\nburdensharing and to permit European military engagement in crises in which the\n\nUnited States might not wish to engage combat forces\n\n53Freedman, op. cit.; Heisbourg, op. cit.\n\nEveryCRSReport.com\n\nThe Congressional Research Service (CRS) is a federal legislative branch agency, housed inside the\n\nLibrary of Congress, charged with providing the United States Congress non-partisan advice on\n\nissues that may come before Congress.\n\nEveryCRSReport.com republishes CRS reports that are available to al Congressional staff.
