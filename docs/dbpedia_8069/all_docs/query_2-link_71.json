        "text": "March 24, 1999--Samuel Berger, National Security Adviser:\n\nWe have indicated that our intent [is] to deter him from launching a major offensive on Kosovo...to deter that kind of an attack....\n\nOur mission is...to deter an even bloodier offensive against innocent civilians in Kosovo....\n\nThe Record:\n\nYugoslav forces continue to kill in Kosovo. According to refugee accounts, mass executions and brutal atrocities are ongoing. NATO reports that at least 4,600 people have been killed in mass executions. It is not at all clear that the Administration's strategy has done anything to halt or restrain the killing of ethnic Albanian Kosovars.\n\nMarch 29, 1999--Jamie Shea, NATO spokesman:\n\nOur objectives are...to stop the violence in Kosovo [and] to prevent humanitarian catastrophes....\n\nThe Record:\n\nSince Operation Allied Force began, more than 750,000 Kosovars have become refugees, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The atrocities continue to occur at an alarming pace, and food shortages are becoming widespread. Even if the conflict were to stop now, Operation Allied Force would not have prevented a humanitarian catastrophe--that has already occurred.\n\nApril 25, 1999--Samuel Berger, National Security Adviser:\n\n[F]or the bombing to stop, there'd have to be an agreement by Mr. Milosevic for the Kosovars to come back.... [T]here would have to be verifiable, demonstrable beginning of that actually happening before we could consider a pause.\n\nApril 26, 1999--Ken Bacon, Department of Defense spokesman:\n\nNATO remains highly committed...to making it clear that there is no sanctuary for murderers and their forces in Yugoslavia.\n\nThe Record:\n\nThe Serbs are still in Kosovo. In the weeks before the NATO campaign, Milosevic increased the Serbian troop presence in Kosovo from its normal level of 11,000-12,000 to 40,000 in and around the province, and he claims that those numbers have increased. The Bonn agreement calls for the \"withdrawal from Kosovo of military, police and paramilitary forces\" as one of its principles, but is unclear on details. It makes no reference to when the departure will take place or to whether all forces must be expelled. Whether this war aim eventually will be achieved remains uncertain.\n\nApril 5, 1999--William Cohen, Secretary of Defense:\n\n[We must] deter Slobodan Milosevic from carrying out his campaign of ethnic cleansing, and failing that, to make him pay a serious substantial price for doing so and to take his military down as best we can through the air power.\n\nApril 28, 1999--General Hugh Shelton, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff:\n\nI believe that bombing can accomplish the military objectives that we've laid out, which is to reduce his [Milosevic's] capabilities, his military capabilities, as well as his special police capabilities.\n\nThe Record:\n\nThe air campaign has achieved modest success against the military targets of the Serb armed forces. For example, 25 percent of Serbia's tanks and over 80 aircraft have been destroyed. But the Serbs are not fighting a tank war and are putting up only token resistance in the air. The Serb war against the Kosovar Albanians is taking place on the ground. It is the Serb forces' ability to fight that war that needs to be destroyed; by that standard, this war aim has not yet been achieved.\n\nApril 13, 1999--Bill Clinton, President of the United States:\n\nWe want the refugees to be able to go home, protected by an international security force, as they work toward self-government.\n\nApril 25, 1999--Samuel Berger, National Security Adviser:\n\n[F]or the bombing to stop, there'd have to be an agreement by Mr. Milosevic for...the Serb forces to leave. [T]here would have to be [a] verifiable, demonstrable beginning of that actually happening before we could consider a pause.\n\nThe Record:\n\nIt is too early to make a judgment on the return of the Kosovars to Kosovo. To date, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, there are more than 750,000 refugees, many of whom were driven from their homes after Operation Allied Force began. NATO's ability to guarantee the safe return of all refugees will be the sticking point of any agreement. The achievement of that goal will go far toward defining victory in Kosovo.\n\nThe Record:\n\nThe war in Kosovo has already spread. Serb forces have begun ethnic cleansing in Montenegro, have entered Croatia, and are attacking border towns in northern Albania. The fact that so-called front-line states, such as Bulgaria, have sought security guarantees from NATO indicates that the war could spread even further. Thus far, the Administration's actions in Kosovo actually have increased the chances of a wider war in the Balkans.\n\nApril 2, 1999--Bill Clinton, President of the United States:\n\nI believe we have quite a good chance of achieving our objectives of the return of the Kosovars to live...with a measure of self-government that they enjoyed under the old Yugoslav Constitution....\n\nApril 4,1999-- Madeleine Albright, Secretary of State:\n\nMilosevic can...stop these atrocities [by working] out an agreement...that...would allow for there to be a multiethnic, democratic, autonomous region of Kosovo that would allow for there to be security with an implementing force in a peaceful environment, and would have the V.J. forces [Yugoslavia armed forces] get out.\n\nApril 13, 1999--Bill Clinton, President of the United States:\n\nWe want the refugees to be able to go home, protected by an international security force, as they work toward self-government.\n\nThe Record:\n\nAutonomy would necessitate Serb rule over Kosovo with Kosovo retaining a degree of self-government. This has not been achieved, although it seems to be an objective of the Bonn agreement. NATO is very unclear, however, about how to reach a political settlement that includes the disarming of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). The problem is that Milosevic will be hard-pressed to agree to an arrangement that puts armed NATO forces in Kosovo, and the KLA may not disarm even if there is an armed NATO presence in Kosovo.\n\nApril 26, 1999--Bill Clinton, President of the United States:\n\nWe're in Kosovo because we want...Southeastern Europe to travel the same road as Western Europe half a century ago, and Central Europe a decade ago.\n\nThe Record:\n\nThe Bonn agreement makes clear that NATO is prepared to accept Slobodan Milosevic as the leader of Yugoslavia. By extension, it seems that mainstream Europe is going to accept him as a negotiating partner. The community of Western nations, however, will not welcome a dictator as an equal. Therefore, it is difficult to imagine a Yugoslavian \"transition\" into the European mainstream any time soon.\n\nApril 19, 1999--Samuel Berger, National Security Adviser:\n\nApril 20, 1999--Madeleine Albright, Secretary of State:\n\nThe Record:\n\nOperation Allied Force has done more to strengthen Slobodan Milosevic's dictatorship than to bring about democracy in Serbia. The NATO air campaign has driven the Yugoslavian military to rally around its leader and has restored the long-strained relationship between Milosevic and the Yugoslavian officer corps. As a result, Milosevic's grip on power has tightened. Furthermore, the Bonn agreement implicitly ensures the survival of Milosevic's dictatorship by accepting Milosevic as Yugoslavia's legitimate leader.\n\nApril 5, 1999--William Cohen, Secretary of Defense:\n\n[We must] deter Slobodan Milosevic from carrying out his campaign of ethnic cleansing, and failing that, to make him pay a serious substantial price for doing so and to take his military down as best we can through the air power.\n\nThe Record:\n\nThis war aim has been partly achieved. According to the Administration, Yugoslavia will pay a \"serious substantial price\" for what it has done. However, the cost to the United States also has been very high. So far, it has taken NATO well over 17,000 missions to inflict that level of punishment. Moreover, even though this war aim is being achieved, as \"defined\" by the Clinton Administration, its overall utility is questionable because it has not had much effect in terms of the achievement of other, more substantive aims.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Clinton Administration launched Operation Allied Force with a confusing array of often contradictory war aims, and progress on achieving these aims has been mixed at best. In some cases, it has been very slow; in others, it has been non-existent. To have any hope of achieving a positive outcome in its war on Slobodan Milosevic--a war for which it clearly was unprepared--the Administration will have to do a better job of anticipating the consequences of its aims and strategy.\n\nJack Spencer is a Research Assistant in The Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis International Studies Center at The Heritage Foundation."
