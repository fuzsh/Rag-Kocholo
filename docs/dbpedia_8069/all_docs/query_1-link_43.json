        "text": "On the edge of town, in a sprawling industrial park that held an oil refinery, a petrochemical plant and a fertilizer factory, lie the twisted pipes, scorched storage tanks, crumbled roofs and jagged detritus left by NATO bombs.\n\nYet it is not these ruined factories that are the worst scourges of war in this river town, many people here say, but the tons of toxic material that poured out of them.\n\nFarm workers, plunging their fingers into the earth, say they come away with rashes that burn and blister. Those who eat the river fish and vegetables or drink the tap water, which trickles out of faucets because of the damage to the purification plant, come down with diarrhea, vomiting and stomach cramps.\n\nChildren, many of whom were sent away to Slovakia by local Red Cross officials for several weeks to escape the clouds of noxious gasses that hovered for days over Pancevo, still suffer headaches and dizziness. The war's lingering, ghoulish touch could be affecting even the unborn. There are twice as many miscarriages as there were during the comparable period last year, doctors here say.\n\nThere is no independent assessment of the medical effects of the exposure to chemicals that the bombing caused. The scientific studies conducted by the Yugoslavs in Pancevo, by their own admission, have been carried out with outdated methods and inferior, antiquated equipment.\n\nThe results of such testing, said Dr. Predrag S. Polic, the chemist who conducted many of the tests, are three or four weeks away.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
