        "text": "In May 2000 Dragiša Krsmanović, the Serbian Public Prosecutor, began the indictment for war crimes of the leaders of the United States of America, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, and the former Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), Javier Solana. These charges, laid in the Serbian Supreme Court, related to alleged violations by NATO forces of the Geneva Convention on the conduct of war. These violations were alleged to have occurred in the course of NATO attacks upon Serbia during 1999, operations which were undertaken to persuade the Yugoslav Government to comply with United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1160, 1199 and 1203. These resolutions had required Yugoslavia’s withdrawal from the province of Kosovo. During enforcement operations conducted from 24 March to 8 June 1999, NATO was alleged to have breached the Convention by using cluster bombs, and by attacking civilians, residential areas, and non-military targets. Ironically, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and four other Yugoslav Serbs have themselves since been indicted by the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, also for war crimes and crimes against humanity. In this case these crimes were allegedly committed against the Kosovo Albanians. A situation such as the collapse of the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is one fraught with dangers and difficulties for the international community. Not least of the difficulties have been legal, including the prosecution of political and military leaders by international courts. As with the trial of Libyan suspects in the Lockerbie case, the development of rules and procedures of international criminal trials has been influenced more by political considerations than by legal. But we can say with some confidence that a system of international criminal law is slowly developing. This is consistent with a growing sophistication in public international law, originally confined to interstate relations. It was unusual to prosecute war leaders in international courts, but they were always liable to sanctions of some kind, however ineffective. Perhaps more problematic however is the question whether the Serbian public prosecutor had a good case. Was NATO guilty of war crimes? The most serious war crime was traditionally levying war without just cause. Although the basis of Serbia’s action against NATO and the allies was more narrowly focused, alleging the illegal use of cluster bombs, and attacking civilians, residential areas, and non-military targets, the whole basis of NATO’s actions may possibly be challenged. For most purposes, the law of war may be divided into two parts: the legitimacy of the resort to force, and the rules governing the conduct of hostilities, often called jus ad bellum and jus in bello respectively. Both changed markedly in the course of the 20th century. This article will consider the broader question of whether NATO’s actions in attacking Yugoslavia were lawful (jus ad bellum). It will also look briefly at some of the legal ramifications of the more recent US-led global war on terrorism, which also raises questions of the legality of the use of force in non-traditional military operations. The narrower question of a breach of the law of war, by attacking civilian targets (jus in bello), will be left to other writers.\n\nIn May 2000 the Serbian Public Prosecutor, Dragisa Krsmanic, began the indictment of the leaders of the USA, the UK, France and Germany, and former NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, for war crimes. These charges, laid in the Serbian Supreme Court, relate to alleged violations by NATO forces of the Geneva Convention on the conduct of war. These violations were alleged to have occurred in the course of NATO attacks upon Serbia, intended to persuade the Yugoslav Government to comply with United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1160, 1199 and 1203, which required its withdrawal from the province of Kosovo. From 24 March to 8 June 1999 NATO was alleged to have breached the Convention by using cluster bombs, and by attacking civilians, residential areas, and non-military targets. Ironically, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and four other Yugoslav Serbs have been indicted by the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, also for alleged war crimes. In this case it is against the Kosovo Albanians. The situation is one fraught with dangers and difficulties for the international community. As with the trial of Libyan suspects in the Lockerbie case, the development of rules and procedures of international criminal trials have been influenced more by political considerations than by legal. But we can say with confidence that an international criminal legal system is developing.\n\nAbstract Military intervention is a crucial tool used to compel nation states to abide by the principles of international law. The United Nations, through its Charter (Chapter VII) authorises the use of force by the UN and or regional organisations as a legitimate method of settling international disputes. Numerous interventions have therefore been carried out ever since the end of the Second World War. A closer look on the majority of these interventions however shows that the conduct of the forces taking part in these interventions turn to violet some other crucial principles of international law. Additional protocol 1 of 1977 to the 1949 Geneva protocols provides for the regulations in terms of the conduct of forces in an armed conflict. The protocol provides for the means as well as the methods of war which parties to a conflict should consider so as to minimise civilian carnage and injuries as well as damage on civilian objects. In 1999, from March 24 to June 09, thirteen of the nineteen North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) members intervened militarily in the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to curb the orchestrated Serb persecution of the Albanian ethnic population. On the 10th of June the same year, United Nations Security Council (UNSC) passed the UNSC Resolution 1244 which resulted in the formation of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) which was to stay in Serbia to monitor peace in the nation. During the period starting from the 24th of March 1999 when NATO bombing campaign code-named Operation Allied Force started and during the stay of the UN peace keeping forces in the selected parts of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the humanitarian situation changed considerably in the host nation. Although international law do provide for the regulations with regard to the conduct of hostilities, it should be noted that war by its nature makes it difficult for the forces involved to follow some of the restrictions as these may at times affect their chances of success. An assessment of the military intercourse in FRY helps notice these challenges and some of the violations that may have been experienced while at the same time providing with technical knowledge on what military forces in an armed conflict should conduct themselves.\n\nIn the text, the author criticizesattitudes and conclusions in the document ofthe Hague Tribunal under the title ``FinalReport to the Prosecutor by the CommitteeEstablished to Review the NATO Bombing CampaignAgainst the FRY&#39;&#39;. At the beginning of thepaper, it is indicated to what extent generallegal estimation on damage inflicted to naturalenvironment, the use of projectiles withdepleted uranium, cluster bombs as well aslegal questions related to the choice oftargets for attacks are controversial andhardly maintainable.Also, it is given a comment on thegeneral estimation of the bombing campaign withan attitude that a number of killed civilians(around 500) ``does not indicate that NATO mayhave conducted a campaign aimed at causingsubstantial civilian casualties either directlyor incidentally&#39;&#39;, by which an interestingcriterion for the estimation of somebody&#39;sintention – the number of victims – isintroduced.Considering ``specific incidents&#39;&#39;,it is stated which of them the Commission didnot explain. Those mentioned in the Report arecommented as well as the estimations related tothem. It is especially done in the case of thebombing of the RTS building in Belgrade, untilthen, without precedent in the history of wars.The author considers that only dueto the stated negligence, the anonymousCommission could conclude ``that neither anin-depth investigation related to the bombingcampaign as a whole nor investigation relatedto specific incidents are justified&#39;&#39;."
