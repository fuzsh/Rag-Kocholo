On the evening of March 24, 1999, the first NATO bombs fell on targets in the then rump Yugoslavia, made up of Serbia and Montenegro, after peace talks between Belgrade and Pristina failed.

Kosovo representatives signed an internationally-brokered agreement in Paris, while Serbiaâs President at the time Milan Milutinovic refused to accept the deal.

The bombing was justified with Belgrade violent intervention to prevent then its southern province from succeeding from Serbia.

Serbiaâs Defence Ministryâs data said that during the 78 days of non-stop bombing, 1,031 soldiers and police officers and 2,500civilins died, including 89 children. Some 6,000 civilians and 5,173 soldiers and policemen were slightly or seriously wounded, while 25 people are still officially missing.

The decision to punish the then Yugoslavia was taken by the UN Assembly, avoiding the UN Security Council meeting and possible veto by either Russia or China, as the Councilâs permanent members.

Â Ahead of the bombing, the two-week peace talks at the French town of Rambouillet ended in Pristina delegations accepting the offered solutions, while Belgrade officials rejected it.

Milutinovic told the AP the signature to the proposed solution would have meant the de facto capitulation with NATO forces unrestricted access to Serbiaâs roads and barracks.

âWho would sign something like that,â he said then.

During the 11 weeks, NATO carries out Â 2,300 airstrikes dropping 22,000 tonnes of different projectiles, including some 30,000 cluster bombs, said to be banned. Many infrastructure objects were destroyed or damaged beyond reparation â roads, bridges, factories, military premises, some hospitals, radar sites, and civilian targets such as radio and TV transmitters.

On April 23, early morning, NATO bombs hit the state RTS TV main building in down-town Belgrade killing 16 technical staff on duty at the time. The justification for bombing the TV station was it had âspread propaganda.â

Some six hours later, RTS resumed broadcast from another location.

Yugoslav Army was in a poor state to put up any serious resistance to NATO planes which dropped projectiles from the sky, some 5,000 meters above the targets. But it managed to shot down the then most modern said to âinvisibleâ NATO Stealth aircraft, designed to avoid detection using various technologies reducing radar reflection/emission, infrared, visible light, radio and audio frequencies.

Defiant Serbs made badges reading âSorry, we didnât know you are invisible,â put a drawing of targets on their backs, wrote âFâ¦ you F16â on roofs and gathered on Belgradeâs bridges, singing, every night before the warning sirens went off.

The bombing ended on June 10, 1999, after Yugoslavia signed a peace agreement in northern Macedoniaâs Kumanovo town, accepting the NATO-led KFOR Â to take military control of Kosovo and the European Union mission EULEX to be in charge of civilian issues.

Yugoslav Army and Serbiaâs police withdrew from the then province, the Kosovo Liberation Army, a guerrilla group that fought the Belgrade forces, was disarmed, and the UN Security Council brought the 1244 Resolution, which remained neutral regarding the final Kosovo status.

The UNHCR data say that after Kosovo came under the international jurisdiction, 230,000 Serbs and Roma left the territory, while 800,000 Albanians returned.

Kosovo declared independence in February 2008 and has so far been recognised by some 100 countries worldwide, including the US, UK and all but five EU member states.

This yearâs anniversary will be marked with a serious of manifestations across Serbia.
