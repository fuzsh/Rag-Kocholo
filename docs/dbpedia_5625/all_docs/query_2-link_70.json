        "text": "At first I was afraid, I was petrified\n\nKept thinking I could never live without you by my side\n\nBut then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong\n\nAnd I grew strong, and I learned how to get along\n\nAnd so you're back from outer space\n\nI just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face\n\nI should have changed that stupid lock\n\nI should have made you leave your key\n\nIf I had known for just one second you'd be back to bother me\n\nGo on now, go. Walk out the door\n\nJust turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore\n\nWeren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?\n\nDid you think I'd crumble?\n\nDid you think I'd lay down and die?\n\nOh, no, not I\n\nI will survive\n\nOh, as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive\n\nI've got all my life to live\n\nI've got all my love to give\n\nAnd I'll survive\n\nI will survive, hey, hey\n\nIt took all the strength I had not to fall apart\n\nKept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart\n\nAnd I spent, oh, so many nights just feeling sorry for myself\n\nI used to cry but now I hold my head up high\n\nAnd you see me somebody new\n\nI'm not that chained-up little person still in love with you\n\nAnd so you felt like dropping in\n\nAnd just expect me to be free\n\nAnd now I'm saving all my loving for someone who's loving me"
