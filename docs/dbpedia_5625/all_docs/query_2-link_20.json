It’s a song about personal strength and empowerment to get over any dark situation.\n\nA Song About Strength\n\n“I Will Survive” – Gloria Gaynor\n\nGloria Gaynor is an American singer from Newark, New Jersey. She is best known for her disco hits in the 1970s and 80s era. Within months of releasing “I Will Survive,” it reached number 1 on the Billboard Top 100 songs and won a Grammy for Best Disco Recording in 1980. The song describes Gloria’s personal journey and strength after a breakup and is now regarded as a symbol of female empowerment. The lyrics tell the story of someone who was broken and afraid and built themselves back up.\n\nDespite the song being about a breakup, it can also apply to many other aspects of life. It is an empowering song for anyone and motivates the listener to believe in themselves and find the strength within.\n\n“…it took all the strength I had not to fall apart.”\n\nLyrics"
