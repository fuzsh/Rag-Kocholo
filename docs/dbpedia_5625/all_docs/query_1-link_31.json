        "text": "When Gloria Gaynor’s record company asked her to record a new single of the song “Substitute,” she was intrigued about the record’s potential B side. “My producers asked what kind of songs I liked,” recalls Gaynor whose song “Never Can Say Goodbye” had been a massive disco hit. “I said, ‘I like songs that are meaningful, have good lyrics and touch people's hearts.’”\n\nThe producers handed her a song that they had written and scribbled on a brown piece of paper and said, “We think that you are the one we have been waiting for to record the song that we wrote two years ago.”\n\nThe lyrics were for the song called “I Will Survive.”\n\nGaynor was instantly smitten with the song. She also knew it didn’t belong hidden on her record’s B side. “I said, 'You have got to put this on the A side. It's a timeless lyric. People will relate to it.’” Gaynor deeply understood the strength of the words, which inspired such a ferocious sense of inner power. At the time, Gaynor was dealing with her own struggles. She was in a neck brace after suffering from a bad fall backwards on stage. She had been in a hospital for months. Her mother passed away the year before.\n\nDetermined to bring the song front and center she brought it to her record company. They refused to listen to it. Undeterred, she recorded “I Will Survive” for her record’s B side, brought it to Studio 54 and handed it to the DJ. “The audience immediately loved it,” says Gaynor. “I thought, this is a hit song. New York audiences Don't immediately love anything. So I gave the DJ a stack of the record to give to his DJ friends.”\n\n“I Will Survive” caught on. The song was played in clubs and heavily requested on the radio. Released in October 1978, by 1979, it hit number 1 on the Billboard charts. Since then “I Will Survive” has sold more than 14 million copies, was ranked by a Rolling Stone poll as one of The Best Disco Songs of All Time and The Library of Congress deemed Gaynor's recording to be culturally significant enough to be preserved in the National Recording Registry.\n\nThis anthem of empowerment changed Gaynor’s life. “It encouraged me, uplifted me and took me around the world,” she says. “I Will Survive” also won Gaynor the only Grammy ever awarded for Best Disco Recording. So this past week it was only fitting when she attended a celebration for the 62nd Annual Grammy nominations. The shindig was hosted by the Recording Academy’s New York Chapter, which honored the nominees. Many Broadway show cast members up for Best Musical Theater Album were there to celebrate their nominations from shows including Moulin Rouge!, Hadestown, Ain’t Too Proud and Oklahoma!.\n\nJawan M. Jackson, Ephraim Sykes, Saint Aubyn and Derrick Baskin, some the performers who play The Temptations in Ain’t Too Proud reflected on the impact of getting a Grammy nomination. “Music has been a part of my life. When nothing else was around, music has always been there for me. So to have this honor and be included in a category with other legends who are nominated before me is an amazing experience,” said Jackson. “I think of what The Temptations sacrificed and went through. The music that created that brought us all together as a nation. And to be recognized in this moment by the Grameen committee is out of control,” added Sykes. “You dream of something of this happening, and when it actually happens, it's breathtaking,” offered Aubyn “Just when you thought you could have gotten everything being in this hit Broadway show—playing these icons, going to the Tony awards and all the accolades from that, you think that is where it stops. To translate that to the Grammy awards and to be nominated for portraying these musicians, these iconic artists, it was a dream that I never thought I would actually have,” shared Baskin.\n\n“I feel like a little kid. I’m geeking out a little bit,” said Karen Olivo at the event. She is nominated for Moulin Rouge! The Musical. “Musical Theater is its own beast. And when we are included in a larger scope of music, it really does feel like a dream,” added the Tony-winning performer. “Our storytelling is a lot like the storytelling of Beyoncé and Kanye but it’s in a different format.” Her costar, Aaron Tveit was also in awe. “I never in a million years expected to be nominated for Grammy. I watch the Grammys every year and the talent always blows me away.”\n\nFor Gaynor being at this special Grammy celebration was an opportunity to offer thanks to the people who voted for her, offer her congratulations to the nominees and to reminisce about the song that changed her life. People continue to share how the song has helped them survive a dark time. “I think of the quote, “…people may forget what you said, but they will never forget how you made them feel,’” said Gaynor. “This song makes makes people feel uplifted and encouraged. To have them think of that song, feel all of that and think of me is a such a privilege.”"
