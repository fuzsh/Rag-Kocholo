If it's big, the data spreads out far.\n\nIf a number's more than 1.5 IQR from the box,\n\nIt gets a star, and you can call it an outlier.\n\nAnd now I'm done. My summary,\n\nIs more appropriate for data that is lacking symmetry\n\nThe mean and the SD may be affected by the skew.\n\nBut my way's strong: It's more robust and it's not wrong....\n\nStat 51, I will survive\n\nAs long as I can pass this class, I know I'll be alive,\n\nI've got all my life to live,\n\nOne semester's time to give:\n\nI will survive, I will survive,\n\nHey, Hey...."
