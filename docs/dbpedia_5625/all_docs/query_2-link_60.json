        "text": "News of singer Gloria Gaynor’s death spread quickly earlier this week causing concern among fans across the world. However the August 2024 report has now been confirmed as a complete hoax and just the latest in a string of fake celebrity death reports. Thankfully, the singer best known for her hit song I Will Survive is alive and well.\n\nUPDATE 29/08/2024 : This story seems to be false. (read more)\n\nGloria Gaynor death hoax spreads on Facebook\n\nRumors of the singer’s alleged demise gained traction on Tuesday after a ‘R.I.P. Gloria Gaynor’ Facebook page attracted nearly one million of ‘likes’. Those who read the ‘About’ page were given a believable account of the American singer’s passing:\n\n“At about 11 a.m. ET on Tuesday (August 27, 2024), our beloved singer Gloria Gaynor passed away. Gloria Gaynor was born on September 7, 1949 in Newark. She will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page.”\n\nHundreds of fans immediately started writing their messages of condolence on the Facebook page, expressing their sadness that the talented 74-year-old singer was dead. And as usual, Twittersphere was frenzied over the death hoax.\n\nWhere as some trusting fans believed the post, others were immediately skeptical of the report, perhaps learning their lesson from the huge amount of fake death reports emerging about celebrities over recent months. Some pointed out that the news had not been carried on any major American network, indicating that it was a fake report, as the death of a singer of Gloria Gaynor's stature would be major news across networks.\n\nA recent poll conducted for the Celebrity Post shows that a large majority (70%) of respondents think those Gloria Gaynor death rumors are not funny anymore.\n\nGloria Gaynor Death Hoax Dismissed Since Singer Is ‘Alive And Well’\n\nOn Wednesday (August 28) the singer's reps officially confirmed that Gloria Gaynor is not dead. “She joins the long list of celebrities who have been victimized by this hoax. She's still alive and well, stop believing what you see on the Internet,” they said.\n\nSome fans have expressed anger at the fake report saying it was reckless, distressing and hurtful to fans of the much loved singer. Others say this shows her extreme popularity across the globe.\n\n© 2024 MediaMass All rights reserved.
