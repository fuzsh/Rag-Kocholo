        "text": "With all the excitement of last Saturday’s World Book Night (I was involved in a Book Sale and Giveaway, amazing how hard it can be to give away free books- “but I’m already reading one at home” somebody said!) there was another celebration that, although did not creep by unnoticed by any means, was something I did not have the time nor energy to do anything about. That was the 400th anniversary of the death of William Shakespeare or, for the less morbid amongst you, 452nd anniversary of his birth, for Will was one of those unfortunates who died on their birthday. Joseph Fiennes suggested that it was as a result of a drunken binge, which I didn’t know, although I can identify with birthday celebrations getting out of hand (my 30th springs to mind but I’m sure that’s a story for another day). So, sitting on my planner and waiting to be watched was this Shakespearean extravaganza from the BBC so last night I spent a lengthy two and a half hours plus in the company of the Bard.\n\nComing live from the RSC in Stratford-upon-Avon I was initially a little unconvinced about what I would be letting myself in for. I was wary of cultural overload. I thought it might be luvvies doing their Shakespearean party pieces without a great deal of context and that I might watch half an hour before resorting to the fast forward button or abandoning it altogether but I should have had more faith in the BBC’s abilities to cover these showpiece events.\n\nPresented by David Tennant and Catherine Tate and attended by Prince Charles and Camilla we were plunged into drama students performing “Tonight” from West Side Story, inspired, of course, by Romeo and Juliet. This set the tone for the evening as it was very much a performing arts events with pieces inspired by Shakespeare as well as his words. My luvvie sensitivity did put up the hairs on the back of my neck when Catherine Tate launched into the “All The World’s A Stage” from “As You Like It” together with walk-on parts from individuals chosen to illustrate the seven ages of man. For me this sort of staging takes me back to coming up with school assemblies I also have this thing about “As You Like It”. I studied it at college and for some reason took against it so much that it still causes the barriers to come down- this is the only Shakespeare play that has had that effect on me (not that I’m familiar with all of them!)\n\nTate and Tennant looking moody\n\nWe moved out of the confines for the studio now and then for the aforementioned Joseph Fiennes to wander around places associated with Shakespeare in pieces to camera representing the seasons of Shakespeare’s life and this was always followed by a song. We had The Shires, Ian Bostridge, the ubiquitous Gregory Porter but best of all was Alison Moyet with a song from “Much Ado” (a play I like very much indeed) a lady of such prodigious talent that she could make “Hey Nonny Nonny” sound convincing.\n\nI was beginning to get into this and I liked the interplay of the different art forms. The balcony scene from “Romeo and Juliet” was followed swiftly by the pas de deux from Prokofiev’s ballet and a sparring Beatrice and Benedick scene (from real life husband and wife Meera Syal and Sanjeev Bhasker) was moved on by a scene from Berlioz opera about the characters. I’ve decided that I’m not really at ease with out-of-context ballet- I do switch off. I think I need to be led into the ballet in order to suspend my disbelief a bit. I felt the same about an Othello/Desdemona ballet scene and that ended with the dramatic strangulation. I think it is to do with context rather than me just being unappreciative. Paradoxically, during this production I realised I felt the opposite about opera. I actually prefer it out of context in an extract form as presented as a whole opera it just gets too much and I end up wanting to go home. But here, the operatic sections were actually amongst my favourites. I really enjoyed Emma Carrington and Rhian Lois doing Berlioz. It was a superb combination of voices and I had never heard the piece before and a section from Verdi’s “Falstaff” performed by the English National Opera was splendid fun. The sound quality of the musical pieces was very good indeed. This was particularly the case with the Midland Youth Jazz Orchestra who performed “Such Sweet Thunder” a Duke Ellington piece I was not familiar with. The Duke was inspired by a Shakespeare festival when he was touring in Stratford, Ontario. This was an extremely likeable section.\n\nI have made it sound like “Shakespeare Live!” was mainly music but of course there were sections from the plays. The piece I enjoyed most of all was from Henry V, which I have never read and wasn’t expecting to be funny but it was performed very endearingly by Alex Hassell as the King trying to persuade Katherine to marry him. In fact of all the top class actors this was the performer I enjoyed the most. He came back later to do a scene with Anthony Sher as Falstaff. I’ve just had to Google him and have discovered that his performance as Henry V was very well received last year. I also found out I remembered a really charming performance from him in an ITV series called “Bonkers” starring Liza Tarbuck from 2007. Just the other day I was wondering what had happened to him- and now I know. Elsewhere we had Sir Ian McKellan tackling the unfamiliar with a speech from “Sir Thomas More” attributed to Shakespeare, Judi Dench and Al Murray (!) performed brilliantly from “Midsummer Night’s Dream” and Anne Marie Duff and Rory Kinnear got all bloody with “Macbeth”.\n\nAlex Hassell\n\nThe talking point of the evening was when Paapa Essiedu came on to do the “to be or not to be” soliloquy from “Hamlet”. He was interrupted by Tim Minchin who wanted the stress put on different words and then was joined by an increasingly A-list group of actors who were all advising a different emphasis on the line. In came Benedict Cumberbatch, David Tennant, Rory Kinner, Harriet Walter, Ian McKellan, Judi Dench clutching a skull (“no it’s not that speech”) before they were all upstaged from a certain visitor from the balcony – His Royal Highness himself who made a scene which was getting just a little irritating into one of the highlights of the night.\n\nOne of the joys of watching live performances is looking out for things going wrong but there wasn’t very much wrong with this lengthy show. Henry Goodman and an unrecognisable Rufus Hound fluffed lines towards the end of the Cole Porter“Brush Up Your Shakespeare” song from Kiss Me Kate (based on “Taming Of The Shrew”) but by this time they had the audience eating out of the palms of their hands and it wouldn’t have mattered what they did. They went done a storm as did Rufus Wainwright with his own arrangement of the sonnet “When, In Disgrace with Fortune and Men’s Eyes” and a very funny sketch from The Horrible Histories team which, I am sure, the Bard himself would have adored.\n\nSir Ian McKellan\n\nBy the end I was, I admit, fairly Shakespeared out but it was left to David Suchet (magnificent voice- had never noticed that about him before) and Judi Dench as the Fairy King and Queen bidding us adieu and a glimpse of fireworks outside the building to the most familiar piece of Shakespeare influenced classical music, “Theme From The Apprentice” or Prokofiev’s “The Montagues and The Capulets” for all us non-Alan Sugar fans.\n\nIt’s his birthday and somebody in this house has written on his head!\n\nHappy Birthday William Shakespeare! You certainly provided us with a varied evening of entertainment on Saturday. Here’s to the half a millennium celebrations!\n\nShakespeare Live from the RSC was shown on BBC2 on Saturday 23rd April as part of the BBC’s ongoing Shakespeare birthday celebrations.\n\nWhitney–Whitney Houston (Arista 1987)\n\nUK Chart Position – 1\n\nUS Chart Position – 1\n\nI remember buying this album on the day it was released, picking the vinyl copy off a vast pile in “Our Price”. It was Whitney’s second album. In the UK the first album had been a slow burner and had been initially hard to find in record stores. I remember I had to order a copy because it was proving hard to track down. That was before, however, the release of “Saving All My Love For You” which catapulted the debut to the top of the charts in the UK and US, with world wide sales of over 30 million and recognition from Billboard as the 11th biggest album of all time. By the release of the second album Whitney was a household name worldwide. She had scored three UK Top 10 singles (including one chartopper) and 4 US top 5 hits (including three number 1’s “Saving All My Love For You”, “How Will I Know” and “The Greatest Love Of All”). This follow-up certainly wouldn’t need ordering.\n\nAt the time of release I loved the debut, but listening to it as a whole now it is a bit of a mish-mash of sounds. Arista were still searching for an identity for Whitney. There are some great singles on it including a couple which are amongst my favourite singles of all time, but I have never purchased it on CD. For me, a greatest hits compilation will have all the best tracks. However, I think this second studio album is even better than any greatest hit compilation and is the most essential of Whitney’s releases. It is perhaps one of the greatest examples of pop-based R&B ever.\n\nThe album opens with the lead single and perhaps Whitney’s finest moment. Things had been pretty serious on the first album and this had the result of her sounding much older than she was but here the emphasis is on fun and a much younger sound. “I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)” was produced by Narada Michael Walden who had himself had a UK Top 10 hit as a solo artist in 1980 with “I Shoulda Loved You”. There’s a real effervescence to this track which matches the look of the album (the sophisticated model sarong and swimsuit shots of the first album is replaced with a cover photo of Whitney in t-shirt with piled-up hair looking young, fun and beautiful). It was an obvious attempt to broaden her appeal to a younger market – in fact, toddlers get their own-pin up as on the back cover we get a snapshot of Whitney as a baby.\n\nThis opening track is a frothy sing-along dancer which was aided by a tongue-in-cheek video. The range and power is certainly there but it is all presented with a good-to-be alive feeling. Unsurprisingly the lead single topped the charts in both the UK and US.\n\nWalden remains on production duties for “Just The Lonely Talking” which is a complete change of pace and is probably my favourite non-single track by Whitney. This is a slinky, almost jazzy mid-tempo ballad which counterbalances the fun of the first track with a controlled, mature performance with a soft and sensual vocal. The song was written by Soul artist Sam Dees and there’s a lovely tenor sax solo from Kenny G, which makes it very much this album’s “Saving All My Love For You”.\n\nThe pace is certainly stepped up again for “Love Will Save The Day” introducing a producer making his debut with Whitney. “Jellybean” Benitez was hot in 1987 and after the release of this album would go on to score three top 20 UK hits and one US Top 20 hit as a solo act and a Top 20 album “Just Visting This Planet” at the tail-end of the year . He had also been instrumental in the early hit career of Madonna and so was a good choice to become the only new name to work on this album. His track “Love Will Save The Day” rattles along from the introduction. It is a hard-hitting, exciting little dancer which benefits from some excellent vibe sections from the master of vibes, Roy Ayers as well as some great percussion work throughout by Paulinho Da Costa, Bashiri Johnson and Sammy Figueroa. The chorus is almost gospel-esque in its fervour and the excitement is genuine. It was chosen as the fifth (!) single from the album and managed to get to number 9 in the US and 10 in the UK over a year after “Whitney” was released, despite almost everyone owning the album. It is the third gem in a row.\n\nJellybean and Roy Ayers\n\nThe voice of Whitney Houston was suited to the big ballads of Michael Masser and we have a perfect example of this next with “Didn’t We Almost Have It All” . Written by Masser alongside Will Jennings this was chosen as the second single and gave the singer her fifth consecutive US number 1 single (in the UK it reached number 14). It does feel a little similar to “All At Once”, which was the non-single highlight from the debut. The performance is exemplary and once again underlines her versatility. What was the closing track on the vinyl edition is a track which didn’t really grab me when it came out but I think it has grown on me over the years. Produced by Walden there is a spoken intro “I don’t why I like it I just do” and with its crashing beat and sliding rock-guitar it feels like we are in Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis territory with a track which could have almost fitted on Janet Jackson’s breakthrough “Control”. It hits a definite groove but in the chorus the vocal is a little shrill and doesn’t really go with the low-down funky sound. I may be in the minority here as it was chosen for the third single and became her 6th consecutive US number 1. In the UK it made number 5 and I seem to remember the single mix was a little different and a little more clubby than this original version.\n\nNext up is the pretty “Where You Are” where Whitney trills quite amusingly over the word “magazine”. Lyrically, I’ve always felt this track is a little dodgy but production from Kashif (his only contribution to the album) is excellent and there’s a sterling sax solo from Vincent Henry. It’s back to the clubs with “Love Is A Contact Sport” which begins with a nod to the great Edwin Starr with the boys chanting “Contact”. Produced by Walden it does have the feel of the type of rocky dance track that the Pointer Sisters had been scoring with but it is all done with great charm. It’s a good fun track which survives every cull on my MP3 player so it must have a great deal going for it.\n\n“You’re Still My Man” sees Michael Masser writing with veteran songwriter Gerry Goffin and is another quality ballad. It has a lovely orchestral sound courtesy of Gene Page who had worked alongside Barry White to get that Love Unlimited sound. The Isley Brothers song “For The Love Of You” was always quite a complex track and had given them a number 22 US hit in 1975. Narada Michael Walden has given it quite a chunky sound and has birds tweeting in the background but once you get used to that it’s actually rather delicious and mature-sounding. It’s not the most immediate track on the album but has perhaps a stronger R&B flavour than what has gone before. “Where Do Broken Hearts Go” was reminiscent of the tracks Jermaine Jackson produced for the first album although it is the sixth of the seven Walden tracks. Single number 4 it became the 7th consecutive US chart-topper for Whitney (a chain that was broken by 1988’s “Love Will Save The Day”). In the UK it made number 14. It’s one of those cases of mis-heard lyrics – I remember Capital Radio DJ Chris Tarrant had a thing about this record when Whitney sings “I love you desperately” it does sound like “I love you Dennis Bradley” and Chris phoned up people he could find called Dennis Bradley to find out what was going on with the superstar singer. This is another track co-penned by a veteran soul act, this time Chuck Jackson who was an early interpreter of Bacharach and David songs and had recorded for classic R&B labels Scepter, Motown and All Platinum.\n\nWhitney and Cissy\n\nThe album’s closer is interesting and a surprising highlight. Was it Arista head honcho Clive Davis’ idea to finish a fun, young sounding album with a broadway ballad from “Chess” written by Tim Rice and Benny and Bjorn from Abba? In the UK we know this track so well as it had been a 1985 chart-topper for Elaine Paige and Barbara Dickson and the decision was made to revive this pairing Whitney up with her mum, the hugely under-rated Cissy Houston. Because the production is close to the original and the song is so familiar and by 1987 seemed somewhat hackneyed it has to rely on the vocal performance and these two come up trumps. Cissy’s voice is full of the warmth and soul she passed onto her daughter. Whitney’s voice is the lighter but when the two come together the combination is explosive. There is a note where they sing “apart” which is just terrific. This is another track which is a constant on my I-pod. I love it when Cissy sings “he needs his fantasy and his freedom”. Whoever had this idea, it was a great one. At the time I needed convincing as I’d never been a fan of “I Know Him So Well” but their version has certainly warmed me to it.\n\nSo a number 1 album with one UK number 1 single and no less than four US number 1’s. Only seven albums in US chart history have equalled that. In the US it went 9 times platinum, in the UK where it spent 101 weeks on the album chart, seven times platinum. It was a record breaker from the word go as it was the first ever album by a female artist to go straight to number 1 in the Billboard charts. It was a commercial blockbuster and is the most satisfying of Whitney’s studio albums. Under the surface, however, there were simmerings and Whitney suffered the backlash which often comes with huge success. Had Whitney distanced herself from her African-American heritage by making such a pop sounding album and where would she go from here? I’ve not finished with Whitney Houston yet so hopefully we will find out soon……………………\n\n“Whitney ” is currently available from Amazon in the UK for £4.63 ,used from £0.01 and as a download for £5.99. In the US it can be purchased for $8.04, used from $0.01 and as a download for $9.99. It is available to stream in the UK on Spotify.\n\nI love Scott and Bailey. I had thought that with Suranne Jones’ success in “Dr Foster” that we might have seen the last of this Manchester-set Police drama so I was delighted to see it back for Series 5. There are only three episodes but I know that for the next three weeks this is going to be the highlight of my television viewing.\n\nThere have been changes. Amelia Bulmore is no longer in it as Scott and Bailey’s boss, DCI Gill Murray and I still haven’t got over the departure of Tracie Bennett who was absolutely brilliant as Rachel Bailey’s Mum. Also, Sally Wainwright, writer of the exemplary “Happy Valley” who created this alongside Diane Taylor has handed on the script-writing duties. The whole conception of the show is fascinating, if a little complex. The idea was originally drawn up by Suranne and co-star Sally Lindsay, who plays her sister, who were lamenting the lack of strong parts for women. They took it to Nicola Schindler of Red Productions who commissioned Sally Wainwright to produce a script. ITV felt it needed a bit more work before they green-lighted it so Wainwright joined up with Diane Taylor, an ex Detective Inspector from Greater Manchester Police to add that touch of authenticity. It shows that it is very much a labour of love from all the women concerned and its strength has always been in its depiction of women, aided by a superb cast. By the last series Amelia Bulmore had written a number of episodes and put her character very much through the wringer as she struggled to cope with alcoholism.\n\nScott and Bailey’s two Sallys – Wainwright and Lindsay\n\nThis is a drama which has always held its “Coronation Street” credentials close. Set in Manchester with Jones and Lindsey and Bulmore all much- loved Street alumni. This connection goes further as writer of this episode (and a number of others) is Lee Warburton, who apart from being the first man I have mentioned in relation to this programme also took his turn in the Street as Tony Horrocks (1995-8).\n\nAt the start of the episode Rachel (Surrane Jones) has returned after a year in London, where if the brief montage shown was anything to go by she had a good time. She turns up back at her old job after her secondment in vice without having told best friend Janet Scott (Lesley Sharp) that she was back. I was initially a little concerned because what you need in this programme is someone to rankle Rachel and put her back up as this is what Jones is so superb at (cf: “Dr Foster) and I thought that their boss had always served this role but new character Anna (Jing Lusi) will fill this gap with aplomb. There was (as there was in “Happy Valley”) a wonderfully excruciating moment when someone takes banter too far . In this case it was Anna who had got inappropriate by saying “the bitch is back” about Rachel and got the Suranne Jones hard stare which may even eclipse the force-field of a Sarah Lancashire “Happy Valley” hard stare.\n\nKeeping the comparisons with “HV” going is that both shows have real humour in the blackness and the humour is driven by the writing and characterisation. When Rachel arrives at the crime scene after a year away she is greeted by the on-site pathologist, Scary Mary, with “Hello stranger. Put on weight? We need to crack on.” Rachel, whose sister is staying with her at her flat has a fondness for air fresheners, Bailey tells Scott, “The other morning I woke up, I thought I’d been embalmed” and when Rachel is appointed Acting Detective Inspector for the case she is told by her superior, Supt. Julie Dodson (Pippa Haywood), “Be ready to brief a Gold meeting at 12 and don’t come dressed like Little Mix”. Warburton in his scripts has not abandoned the two locations which really brings out the best in the characters – the ladies loo (about 20 mins in) and having a cigarette in the alley (about 30 mins). These are Scott and Bailey essentials as it is the scenes between Jones and Sharp which add much to its greatness.\n\nThere’s a pretty explosive plot going on as well, it’s not all fag and loo breaks. This is intense, modern crime where phones and computers play a part. There’s serial killing going on, fairly randomly and it becomes evident from the Dark Net (still never sure what that is although as Rachel says “It’s not illegal to use the Dark Net” it always seems to bring up things that are) that someone is killing and filming and it could be a grisly version of “Dare” that the police officers are dealing with. Technology is moving so fast that the police cannot keep up with it. A potential love interest for Rachel if the twinkle in his eye is anything to go by SCAS Neil Simpson (Gregg Chillin who despite his name previously smouldered throughout “Da Vinci’s Demons”) tells her, “In terms of internet crime the police are like your granny trying to programme the video player.” How our use of modern technology is impacting our lives is also brought home dramatically for Janet whose family is plunged into chaos caused by boundaries being overstepped.\n\nI would imagine (although I don’t want to know) that this plot line will continue for the three episodes as it is a crime spree which has continued for seven years I don’t imagine it will be solved too quickly but I will be there hanging off every line and watching the best girl-cop duo ever (yes, it far eclipses “Cagney and Lacey”) and some of the best performances you’ll see this year on television.\n\nScott and Bailey Series 5 began on ITV at 9.00 pm on Wednesday 13th April. It is available on catch-up on the ITV hub\n\nYesterday I did something new. I visited the London Book Fair for the first time. I was invited by the good people of AMS Digital Publishing who run the Nudge website and newbooks Magazine, both of which I contribute to. The Fair is running this week at London Olympia. Coincidentally, just this weekend I watched a Clint Eastwood Hollywood movie from 2010 “Hereafter” starring Matt Damon where the plot climax came as the main characters encountered one another for the first time at …The London Book Fair. Now Hollywood had relocated this at Alexandra Palace (very familiar to me as I used to be Headteacher of the Primary School which borders the Palace’s grounds) and envisaged the event as Derek Jacobi (playing himself) reading Dickens whilst a handful of people stood around clutching a book to be signed. Now, I knew it wasn’t going to be like this but somehow the image must have crept into my brain as when I entered the conference hall I was quite overwhelmed by the size and scale of the event. It was a perfect opportunity for me to meet for the first time Guy, Mel and Alastair from AMS Digital and Paul and Mike who are the “Community Voices” for the Book Life and Book Noir strands of Nudge, if only I could find them…….\n\nWell, I did and it was great to meet them and gave us a chance to sit around the table and talk about books –so a very productive way to spend a few hours. The Fair itself was fascinating, although most of the time I did not know what was going on! Many publishers were there seemingly all having meetings, there was a lot of talking around desks about things like distribution rights and other deals going on which need not disturb the minds of us humble readers. There were lots of books on show but quite often out of reach of the grubby mitts of the Festival goers- I only picked up a couple of books the whole time I was there. I did, however, get a number of very useful catalogues which will let me know what is happening in the world of books over the next few months. I also did not know that there is now a Foyles Bookshop in Waterloo Station where I spent a happy quarter of an hour or so whilst waiting for connections. I’ve probably had my little fix of London now and am back on the Isle of Wight where the pace is considerably…………(exhales)….slower.\n\nWhilst on the subject of my good friends at newbooks. Timed beautifully with the London Book Fair is the latest issue (nb88) which is out now and can be purchased from the Nudge website by following this link. Featuring Peter James on the cover (who looks different in my imagination) it is full of many good things which need your serious consideration. The winners of the various books of the year are revealed in the genre categories and also the Reading Group Book of the Year. There are also interviews with the above mentioned Mr James, Chris Cleave (whose new book sounds fascinating) and Holly Seddon and there’s a considerable amount of me as well, most of which you will have not read on reviewsrevues.com. If you are familiar with the Nudge site you will know that it is divided up into sections and now each section has its own champion –a community voice. I am that person for the Bookhugger section (literary fiction) and there’s also Reg (Book Chap), Jade (Book Geek), Paul (Book Life), Sheila (Book Diva) and Mike (Book Noir) ready to be introduced to you. We have all produced a piece for the magazine for you to get to know us a bit better as readers. I have also written a piece especially for the “Script” section which compares the film version of “Atonement” to the book (my review of the book is here).\n\nThere’s also the chance to get hold of for free (just p&p to pay) the recommended reads, which is a particularly impressive selection this issue- “Black Eyed Susans” by Julia Heaberlin (racing up the Bestsellers chart as I write this- Top 5 in the Official UK Top 50 books), Chris Cleave’s latest “Everyone Brave Is Forgiven”, Laline Paul’s “The Bees” and Eva Holland’s “The Daughter’s Secret” – something for everyone there.\n\nThe Very Best Of– Gloria Gaynor (Polydor 1993)\n\nA compilation album from the lady who back in 1976 was officially crowned “Queen Of The Discos” and who is still with us today, probably performing one of her hit songs somewhere on this planet as I write this. Her “coronation” was performed at the nightclub “Club Des Jardins” in New York City and received a lot of publicity. Disco was then a hot, still evolving form of popular music which was just beginning to take the world by storm. Some may say that others who came after her eclipsed her reign but she was the original “Disco Queen”.\n\nGloira became one of the early protégés of American music mogul Clive Davis, then President for Columbia Records who has overseen the early career of so many superstars (Whitney Houston, Earth Wind & Fire, Barry Manilow, Billy Joel, Aerosmith, Alicia Keys –the list goes on and on). Her first single released on Columbia embraced the new disco craze and was a huge success in nightclubs but failed to set the pop charts alight. This was “Honey Bee” which appears on this CD in its full six minute glory. It’s a catchy enough track and garnered enough interest for Gloria to be hooked up with a production team to produce an album which changed the face of popular music. The production team was Meco Monardo (later to top charts in his own right with his disco-fied “Theme From Star Wars”), Tony Bongiovi and Jay Ellis. The decision was made to fill the first side with three songs which seamlessly moved from one to the other without any breaks providing 19 minutes of uninterrupted dancing. First up was the tried and tested “Honey Bee” but the second song of the three was the one that changed everything.\n\n“Never Can Say Goodbye” was a song written by Motown song-writer Clifton Davis, originally for the newly Ross-less Supremes but actually given to the Jackson Five to record. As a dreamy mid-tempo track it became their 6th Top 3 single in a row in the US in 1971 (#2) although in the UK it was their least successful to date only reaching 33. Perhaps the fact that the song was less familiar in its original format for us Brits may have explained how well we received Gloria’s version. From its unforgettable swerling introduction to its outstanding production I just had to have a copy of the single and played it so much I virtually wore it out. Gloria’s debut hit got to number 2 in the UK (held off by the very likeable but surprise number 1 “Ms Grace” by veteran US Pop/Soul Group The Tymes) and number 9 in her homeland. The version on this CD is the one you really need to hear- the full length album version of over 6 minutes which follows on from “Honey Bee” just as it did on the original studio album (although not continuous as on that). The recording technology at the time meant that single releases had to be edited to fit the 7 inch single (and to be played on radio). The twelve inch single was some years away which allowed for longer tracks but placing a full version on an album side also did the business too. This allowed for what became the staple of disco music the instrumental “break”. I had an Uncle who we used to subject these records to and he’d always say of Ms. Gaynor “Oh, she’s gone off on her tea-break again” when the instrumental section kicks in and I always think of that every time I hear this.\n\nThis dance trilogy of tracks was completed with another Motown track . Much more familiar to us Brits was the Holland-Dozier-Holland Four Tops track “Reach Out I’ll Be There”. This had topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic and unsurprisingly Gloria in her version beefed up the clip-clop beat. It’s not as good a track as “Never Can Say Goodbye” but sounded brilliant in the context of the album and here we get it in its full-length version (with the odd tea-break for Gloria in the middle). Somewhat hastily released as a single in the UK it reached number 14. Probably 99% of the people who bought Gloria’s debut album did so for the three tracks segued together. The second side was a less explosive selection of songs with a more traditional R&B feel. It was as if they were hedging their bets somewhat – one side the new-fangled disco tracks the other appealing to an older audience. The album made the Top 40 in both UK and US, which was at the time unusual for a debut African-American female artist. A further track from the album which was the lead track on Side 2 “All I Need Is Your Sweet Lovin’” sounded very much like a Motown track and just missed out on the Top 40 when released in the UK in the summer of 1975. This is also included on this “Best Of” CD.\n\nTowards the end of 1975 Gloria was back again with a second album which, unsurprisingly, followed the pattern of the first. In my opinion, the first side of “Experience Gloria Gaynor” was better than its predecessor and contains three of Gloria’s greatest tracks. This album, released in time of Christmas, and at the very top of my Christmas list had two original tracks in its pack of three and one old standard which dated from 1940. What is unusual about these early disco tracks on the first two albums is that they are very much songs which tell a story. Within a short space of time the actual song part of a disco track took increasingly a back seat, often becoming chants over the disco beat (think “Le Freak” by Chic or “In The Bush”by Musique, both great disco tracks but not great songs). Gloria was always keen to tell a story. The story begins with “Casanova Brown” a super-cool dude who picks Gloria up against her better judgement when she is in a nightclub “sipping on some wine”. This is a great track with a feel of what girl groups like First Choice (“Armed And Extremely Dangerous/Smarty Pants”) had been hitting big with. There’s a great sax solo when things get a bit much for Gloria and her head is spinning all around by this charmer. I’ve seen other compilations which does not feature this track so it is great to have it hear in its full-length version. The second track is even better and features Gloria’s maxim for life because “this is what my Daddy used to say”. The message he gave her was “If You Want It (Do It Yourself)” and the instrumental section of this is an absolute dream. Both this and the track which comes after it are my two all-time favourite tracks. Gloria’s version of “How High The Moon” a song best known in its 1951 version by Les Paul and Mary Ford rattles along at a galloping pace. If I can remember the sleeve notes of the vinyl edition the string section (real orchestra, no synthesizers in these days) was the fabulously named Tony Posk Strings and the job they do is absolutely amazing as this has probably the best string work on any pop track (with perhaps Cilla Black’s “Love’s Just A Broken Heart” an exception). Tony Posk has his string players sawing away like mad to keep up with this track and the whole thing is quite sublime and very exciting. Once again Side 2 of this album featured a range of slower tracks which allows Gloria’s vocals to shine but ends up with a very good version of Bacharach and David’s “Walk On By” given the “Never Can Say Goodbye” treatment with a great “Stop!” hook.\n\nThis second album was not as successful. Only “How High The Moon” made any impression on the Top 40 (UK#33) and it did look like the writing was on the wall for Gloria’s brand of orchestral disco, especially when the electronic sounds of Donna Summer took over that Disco crown.\n\nGloria continued to record and in 1978 needed a b-side for her cover version of an unlikely UK chart-topper, the rather lumbering “Substitute” from South African girl-group one-hit-wonders, the attractively named Clout. Producers Freddie Perren and Dino Fekaris (of Tavares and Peaches and Herb fame) quickly came up with a tune which might have been fitting as Gloria was in pain and wearing a back brace at the time of recording. That song “I Will Survive” was rumoured to have been written on the back of an envelope and recorded. Public demand got the record label to flip the single, making the B side the A side and the rest is history. Millions of copies sold, the most sung song in Karaoke history, this tale of female empowerment floored everyone. It became a gay anthem and has inspired so many people that Gloria herself has written a book about it. “We Will Survive: True Stories Of Encouragement, Inspiration and the Power Of Song” (2013) collects together the tales people have told Gloria over the years as to how this song has touched their lives. It’s a great song whose greatness has really grown over the years. When it was released it sounded a little old-fashioned, it had the crisp, clear orchestral sound which had largely by then gone out of vogue – it was far more of a song than disco tracks had become, there were none of the ubiquitous backing singers or changes in pitch and rhythm which were disco music staples. There are two versions of this song on this CD. It opens with the single version and closes with a 12” remix by Phil Kelsey which (showing the longevity of this song) reached number 5 in the UK Charts in 1993. I personally would have preferred a track from her “I Got You” album’s disco sequence, “Let’s Make A Deal”, which rarely appears on compilations but the 1993 remix is one of her biggest hits so probably deserves its place here.\n\n“I Will Survive” topped the chart on both sides of the Atlantic and became the first and only winner of the “Best Disco Recording” Grammy. By 1980 in the US there was a backlash against Disco – known as the “Disco Sucks” movement which was more motiviated by racisim and homophobia than anything else which led to Dance music going underground and ended the chart career of Gloria Gaynor and many others.\n\nWhat a line-up! Sister Sledge, Gloria Gaynor, Grace Jones and Chaka Khan\n\nFor the UK and European market Gloria had more tricks up her sleeve. Embracing the gay fans who had supported her from the very beginning (although at times there has been reported tension with her religious beliefs) came “I Am What I Am”. Taken from the Drag Queen musical “La Cage Aux Folles” Gloria certainly knew what she was singing about when it was “time to open up your closet” although there have been the odd interview over the years when she has reportedly wanted to give it a broader spectrum. Gloria would have known better than to alienate her loyal gay following (Donna Summer’s career suffered from something she was reputed to have said) as fans wanted to hear those hit songs over and over again. In the early nineties I saw her perform in the early hours of the morning in a nightclub called “Paradise” in Islington where she went down a storm. She’s a hard worker. Perhaps she’s not the greatest performer on-stage but she knows how to sell her back catalogue and the voice is still in great shape.\n\nThis 14 track CD is a generous 78 minutes long and is essential because it features hard to find full length versions. Length is not always a good thing, however, in the case of the longest track (8min 21) “Let Me Know (I Have The Right). The cut-from-the-same-cloth follow-up to “Survive” (#32 in the UK) was perfectly good in its single release length but this version is too long and runs out of ideas some time before it finishes. There’s a couple of less than essential tracks towards the end which show there is more to Gloria than a disco beat – “Let’s Mend What’s Been Broken” from a 1981 album and “We Can Start All Over Again from 1977. Anyone wanting more Gloria Gaynor than this might well consider the eighteen tracker “The Collection” which has edited single versions of a lot of the above together with some more of her disco-fied cover versions “Going Out Of My Head”, “Substitute” and “Tonight” from “West Side Story”. A treat of a studio album was released in 2002 (her 17th!) “I Wish You Love” perfectly married the uptempo dance sound with contemporary R&B and if it had a hit single on it could have done very well for her indeed. It was well received and is certainly worth a listen but for Gloria in her glorious, glory days this “Very Best Of “ CD is a must.\n\nIn early 2016 Gloria Gaynor was chosen to open the British National Television Awards, proving she is still going strong. Her “I Will Survive” is mixed with Destiny’s Child’s “Survivor” to good effect.\n\n“The Very Best Of Gloria Gaynor” is currently available from Amazon in the UK for £6.40 and used from £1.21. In the US it can be purchased for $10.73 and used from $3.52."
