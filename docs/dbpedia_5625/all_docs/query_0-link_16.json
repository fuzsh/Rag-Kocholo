        "text": "Last night I stopped by the Flying Saucer around 9:30. There is trivia there on Tuesdays at 7:30 and 10. Graham who runs the event was running short on people to play the late game, so he asked me to do him a favor and join the late game as a team of one. I haven’t played trivia at the Saucer since 2012, but I figured, why not? After all, I won as a team of one back in 2005, and that win led me to invite two of my neighbors, the beginning of the legendary Rapscallions team that is probably the all-time money leader at the Saucer. Let’s see how I did:\n\nAfter question 15 (of 30, three rounds of 10) I saw no need to continue. There were a ton of movie questions and that is my weak subject.\n\nCongratulations to Memphis Grizzlies forward Tony Allen, who has earned a place on the NBA All-Defensive First Team for the third time in his career.\n\nThere will be an International Ceviche Competition at Cafe Keough Sunday, June 7. Celebrity chefs from all over the city will compete to see who can create the best ceviche, a raw fish dish prepared with lemon or lime and spiced peppers. Having lived in San Diego where it was served at damn near every restaurant, I can tell you it is GOOD if you have never tried it. Admission is $15 and along with ceviche sampling, you get live music and drink specials. Part of the proceeds benefit Church Health Center.\n\nThere was a media sampling of Capriccio’s new modern Southern comfort lunch menu yesterday. That’s comfort food inspired by the South, not food made with the alcoholic beverage Southern Comfort, although that would be a good menu too. I didn’t make it to the tasting due to my job in Horn Lake, but Holly did and she has lots of good photos.\n\nI worked from home this afternoon, so I am out a bit early today. Time for a PBR!"
