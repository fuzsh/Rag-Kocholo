        "text": "The life of Gloria Gaynor has hit some amazing peaks, and some difficult valleys. But it is a life story that is still being written.\n\nGloria today is as active as ever - performing live concerts, appearing on national TV, releasing new CDs - and she's more positive than ever. Whatever Gloria sets out to do, you can be sure it will reflect the same deep spirit and transformative ability as the music and life within her.\n\nShe is still very much a survivor.\n\nShe was 19 when she signed her first record contract. In 1973, Gloria made history as Billboard gave birth to the Disco Action Charts. \"Never Can Say Good-Bye\" bowed at #1 on the charts and became the first Dance Song to reach #1 status in dance music. Ever since that time, for more than 30 years, Gloria keeps setting the standard. In March of 2001, her single, \"Just Keep Thinkin’ About You,\" topped the Billboard Dance/Club charts at #1, while her international hit \"Last Night\" with Giorgio Moroder debuted at #1 throughout Europe. In keeping with the theme of #1, Gloria Gaynor was the first to record an album especially for clubs, and the first to do a mega-extended dance medley party mix, releasing 12\" dance singles that are now high-end collectors items.\n\nIn September 2002, Logic Records/BMG released the highly anticipated U.S. LP entitled \"I Wish You Love.\" That was her first worldwide release in 15 years. It gave birth to 4 #1 dance singles on Billboards Dance Charts as well as her first top ten, \"I Never Knew\", on Billboard's Adult Contemporary Charts. She also recorded a new version of \"I Will Survive\" in Spanglish, recorded live in Brazil.\n\nHer popularity has continuously flourished into the new millennium. In 2002, she was honored at the World Music Awards in Monte Carlo with the coveted LEGEND award presented by long time fan Prince Albert. She made a splash on Broadway in the longest running musical revue, \"Smokey Joe’s Café\", and on national TV, as a guest star on such popular programs as \"That ‘70’s Show\" , \"Ally McBeal\" and more, introducing her to a whole new generation of fans.\n\nThe film industry continues to feature \"I Will Survive,\" on the soundtrack of more than a half dozen major motion picture releases. VH-1 honored Gloria Gaynor with the number one spot during their countdown of the Top 100 Dance Records of All Time for \"I Will Survive\".\n\nOn September 19, 2005 Gloria, along with her Hit song \"I Will Survive\" were inducted into the Dance Music Hall of Fame during a ceremony that took place in New York City.\n\nGloria even found time to write an autobiography entitled, \"I Will Survive\" (St. Martin’s Press) that is a revealing trip through her journey in life.\n\nShe also lends her support to numerous charities, ranging from the likes of The Rita Hayworth Gala for Alzheimer’s to Revlon’s Annual Walk for Life.\n\nAt first I was afraid\n\nI was petrified\n\nKept thinking I could never\n\nlive without you by my side\n\nBut then I spent so many\n\nnights thinking how you did\n\nme wrong and I grew strong\n\nAnd I learned how to get along\n\nAnd so you’re back from outer space\n\nI just walked in to find you here\n\nwith that sad look upon your face\n\nI should a changed that stupid lock\n\nI should a made you leave your key\n\nIf I had known for just one second\n\nyou’d be back to bother me\n\nGo on now go\n\nWalk out the door\n\nJust turn around now\n\nYou’re not welcome anymore\n\nWeren’t you the one who tried to\n\nto hurt me with goodbye?\n\nYou think I’d crumble?\n\nYou think I’d lay down and die?\n\nOh no, not I\n\nI will survive\n\nAs long as I know how to love\n\nI know I’ll stay alive\n\nI’ve got all my life to live\n\nAnd I’ve got all my love to give\n\nAnd I will survive\n\nI will survive\n\nHey\n\nHey\n\nIt took all the strength I had\n\nnot to fall apart\n\nAnd trying hard to mend the\n\npieces of my broken heart\n\nAnd I spent oh so many nights\n\njust feeling sorry for myself\n\nI used to cry\n\nBut now I hold my head up high\n\nAnd you’ll see me\n\nSomebody new\n\nI’m not that chained up little girl\n\nwho’s still in love with you\n\nAnd so you felt like dropping in\n\nand just expect me to be free\n\nBut now I’ m saving all my loving\n\nfor someone who’s loving me\n\nGo on now go\n\nWalk out the door\n\nJust turn around now\n\nYou’re not welcome anymore\n\nWeren’t you the one who tried to\n\nbreak me with goodbye?\n\nYou think I’d crumble?\n\nYou think I’d lay down and die?\n\nOh no, not I\n\nI will survive\n\nAs long as I know how to love\n\nI know I’ll stay alive\n\nI’ve got all my life to live\n\nAnd I’ve got all my love to give\n\nAnd I’ll survive\n\nI will survive\n\nOh\n\nOh, now go\n\nWalk out the door\n\nJust turn around now\n\nYou’re not welcome anymore\n\nWeren’t you the one who tried to\n\nbreak me with goodbye?\n\nYou think I’d crumble?\n\nYou think I’d lay down and die?\n\nOh no, not I\n\nI will survive\n\nOh, as long as I know how to love\n\nI know I’ll stay alive\n\nI’ve got all my life to live\n\nAnd I’ve got all my love to give\n\nAnd I’ll survive\n\nI will survive\n\nI will survive"
