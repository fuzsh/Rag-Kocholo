        "text": "Update, 1:20 p.m. Nov. 3: Traveling foodie Anthony Bourdain (who grew up in Leonia) got a nod in the enterprise category, but asked that he not be included because he would not be able to attend the induction ceremony. The hall of fame erroneously listed Bourdain on the ballot before replacing him with Joseph Buckelew (Lakewood/Manasquan), chairman of Conner Strong & Buckelew, an insurance and risk management firm, and a GOP powerbroker who has a history of media ownership.\n\n\"Late Show\" host Stephen Colbert may soon be able to add \"New Jersey Hall of Famer\" to his resume, if the people of the state see fit to vote him through.\n\nColbert, who lives in Montclair, is just one of 50 nominees for the state hall of fame, whose 2017 class is now open for voting at njhalloffame.org/2017-nominees. (You can see photos of all the nominees in the gallery above.)\n\nThere are 41 men and 10 women nominated this year for the New Jersey Hall of Fame (one of the nominations, for Ozzie and Ricky Nelson, includes two people) in five categories, encompassing business greats, athletes, actors, musicians and politicians. Living or not, those who claim the most votes will be inducted in May. The 2016 class had 13 inductees.\n\nIn the sports category, soccer great, World Cup Champion and gold medalist Carli Lloyd of Delran is up for a vote alongside longtime Giants quarterback Phil Simms and linebacker Harry Carson. Also nominated: Star-Ledger columnist emeritus Jerry Izenberg, one of two columnists to attend every Super Bowl.\n\nIn the performing arts category, actors Ed Harris (Tenafly), Nathan Lane (Jersey City) and Tom Cruise (onetime Glen Ridge resident) are in the running alongside actor and comedian Flip Wilson (Jersey City), singer Gloria Gaynor (Newark), the E Street Band's Steven Van Zandt (Middletown), guitarist and singer George Benson (Englewood) and the Four Seasons (Newark).\n\nSteve Forbes (Far Hills) and Paul Volcker (Teaneck), former chairman of the Federal Reserve, are nominated in the enterprise category.\n\nFormer Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia is a nominee in the public service category of the hall as well as Clara Maass, a nurse who died in 1901 as a volunteer test subject in a yellow fever study, and Dorothea Lynde Dix, an advocate for the mentally ill and superintendent of Army nurses during the Civil War. Several former governors of New Jersey are also in the mix, including the first governor, William Livingston, and Alfred E. Driscoll.\n\nLast year, Kelly Ripa, Ray Liotta and Chuck Wepner were among the hall's inductees."
