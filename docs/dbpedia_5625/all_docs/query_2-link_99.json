        "text": "Song Meaning of I Will Survive by Gloria Gaynor, and what it is about\n\nBy the mid-Seventies, Gaynor’s career was falling apart. Donna Summer had replaced her as the leading disco diva, and 32-year-old Gaynor had suffered the death of her mother and had recently undergone spinal surgery after tripping onstage and triggering temporary paralysis.\n\nSo when she belted out “I Will Survive,” she brought extra attitude. The track was originally a B side, but after enterprising DJs started to play it at discos, it turned into a smash.\n\n“I never tire of ‘I Will Survive,’” Gaynor told Rolling Stone in 2016. “I love doing it for the audience.”\n\n\"I Will Survive\" is a song by American singer Gloria Gaynor, released in October 1978 as the second single from her sixth album, Love Tracks in 1978. It was written by Freddie Perren and Dino Fekaris. A top-selling song, it is a popular disco anthem.\n\nThe song's lyrics describe the narrator's discovery of personal strength following an initially devastating breakup.\n\nAccording to Dino Fekaris, the principal writer of the song, \"I Will Survive\" has its genesis in his experience getting fired by Motown Records in the mid-1970s after seven years working there as a staff writer.\n\nNow unemployed, Fekaris turned on the TV in his room, and a theme song he had written for the film Generation, performed by Rare Earth, happened to be playing.\n\nHe took it as a good omen, and jumped up and down on the bed saying, \"I'm going to make it. I'm going to be a songwriter. I will survive!\".\n\nFekaris teamed up with his collaborator Freddie Perren, another former member of the Motown production team, to write the song; however, the song remained unrecorded for two years as no suitable singer was available.\n\nIn 1978, Perren was asked by Polydor to produce \"Substitute\" for Gloria Gaynor, which he agreed on the understanding that he could also produce the B-side.\n\nWhen Gaynor was asked what kind of songs she liked, she said she liked \"songs that are meaningful, have good lyrics, and touch people's hearts.\"\n\nThe producers then handed her the song lyrics of \"I Will Survive\" scribbled on a piece of brown paper, Gaynor recognized the song as a hit immediately.\n\nAccording to Robert \"Boogie\" Bowles who played guitar on the song, in the three-hour recording session, the session musicians spent most of their time recording the A side, \"Substitute\".\n\nAs a result, they only had 35 minutes to record the B-side \"I Will Survive\".\n\nThey also did not even know the song title or the melody of the song, but they were fairly relaxed recording it in the belief that the B-side would likely not be played.\n\nBased only on the chord changes and a few notes, they improvised freely much of the backing track, and Bowles filled in the bare bone of the tune with jazzy blues licks.\n\nDue to the difference in the intro from the main body of the tune which made a smooth transition difficult, it was recorded in two parts and then spliced together.\n\nGaynor then recorded the vocals wearing a back brace, having just had a surgery due to a fall at a concert. The injury and a recent bereavement made Gaynor identify with the sentiment of \"I Will Survive\": \"That's why I was able to sing the song with so much conviction\".\n\nIt received heavy airplay in 1979, spending three non-consecutive weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 as well as topping the UK Singles Chart and Irish Singles Chart. The song is also frequently recalled as a symbol of female empowerment. In 2016, the Library of Congress deemed Gaynor's original recording to be \"culturally, historically, or artistically significant\" and selected it for preservation in the National Recording Registry.\n\nI will Survive lyrics by Gloria Gaynor\n\nAt first, I was afraid, I was petrified\n\nKept thinking I could never live without you by my side\n\nBut then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong\n\nAnd I grew strong, and I learned how to get along\n\nAnd so you're back from outer space\n\nI just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face\n\nI should have changed that stupid lock\n\nI should have made you leave your key\n\nIf I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me\n\nGo on now, go. Walk out the door\n\nJust turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore\n\nWeren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?\n\nDid you think I'd crumble?\n\nDid you think I'd lay down and die?\n\nOh, no, not I\n\nI will survive\n\nOh, as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive\n\nI've got all my life to live\n\nI've got all my love to give\n\nAnd I'll survive\n\nI will survive, hey, hey\n\nIt took all the strength I had not to fall apart\n\nKept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart\n\nAnd I spent, oh, so many nights just feeling sorry for myself\n\nI used to cry, but now I hold my head up high\n\nAnd you see me somebody new\n\nI'm not that chained-up little person still in love with you\n\nAnd so you felt like dropping in\n\nAnd just expect me to be free\n\nAnd now I'm saving all my loving for someone who's loving me\n\nGo on now, go. Walk out the door\n\nJust turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore\n\nWeren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?\n\nDid you think I'd crumble?\n\nDid you think I'd lay down and die?\n\nOh, no, not I\n\nI will survive\n\nOh, as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive\n\nI've got all my life to live\n\nI've got all my love to give\n\nAnd I'll survive\n\nI will survive\n\nGo on now, go. Walk out the door\n\nJust turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore\n\nWeren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?\n\nDid you think I'd crumble?\n\nDid you think I'd lay down and die?\n\nOh, no, not I\n\nI will survive\n\nOh, as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive\n\nI've got all my life to live\n\nI've got all my love to give\n\nAnd I'll survive\n\nI will survive"
