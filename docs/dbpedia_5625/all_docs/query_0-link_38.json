        "text": "An icy wind cut through the Lower East Side last Thursday outside a screening of “Three Christs” at the Regal Essex Crossing cinema.\n\nRichard Gere kept his coat and scarf on for the red carpet, as did Peter Dinklage, his co-star, who wore a snug woolen cap. Bundled-up guests, including Edie Falco, Debra Winger and Chris Noth, came in behind them.\n\nThe film is adapted from “The Three Christs of Ypsilanti,” a 1964 book about three patients with paranoid schizophrenia, each of whom claimed to be Jesus. Despite the serious subject matter, Jon Avnet, the director and co-writer, said the cast subjected him to a fair amount of ribbing on set.\n\nWhat did they pick on him about? “You name it,” Mr. Avnet said. “Imitating my behavior, my mannerisms, how I speak. I’m a very easy target.”\n\nJulianna Margulies, whose red lip and nails popped against her Nili Lotan leopard coat, identified Mr. Gere as one of the culprits. “There wasn’t a moment when one of them wasn’t teasing the other one, all the time,” she said.\n\nMr. Gere, grinning broadly, said he needled the director about “everything.” “He’s pedantic and he’s kind of dizzy, but he’s dizzy like a fox,” he said.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
