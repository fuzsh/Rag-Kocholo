        "text": "I grew up in a single-parent home with a single mother and six siblings—therein lay the crux of my problems. Too few people know the devastating long-term effects that can ravage the life of a child raised without a father—or at least a good father figure. I had no uncles—my mother was an only child—and my father had two sisters but no brothers.\n\nWhen I was five years old, we moved from an apartment building to a two-family house. There was a young, childless couple, John and Mary, who lived on the second floor. I often visited them, and they played with me every day.\n\nOne day Mary went to the hospital to deliver their first child. I had come to think of them as an aunt and uncle, so it was not strange to me when John invited me up to their apartment to have cookies and milk. I innocently allowed him to lead me into the bedroom, where he proceeded to lift me onto the bed and remove my panties. As he began to molest me, I looked up at him and said, “My mommy’s not gonna like this!”\n\nHe responded angrily: “Your mother’s not gonna know!” “Yes, she will, cuz I’ll tell her,” I timidly said. At that he hurriedly replaced my panties, snatched me from the bed, and dragged me to the front door of the apartment, where he shoved me out with a growl: “Git on back downstairs. You make me sick.” Looking back on it now, I think he probably meant, “You make me scared.”\n\nMy mother was a no-nonsense, take-no-crap-from-anyone kind of person, and John knew it. Because of that, I never told her what happened that day. I believed she would probably have hurt him seriously, which would have meant jail time and that I would be left without a mother as well as a father. I had no way of realizing then that John had stolen my innocence that afternoon and had reinforced the low self-esteem and abandonment issues I already suffered, born of fatherlessness.\n\nFatherlessness, coupled with this incident, set the stage for my behavior in male relationships from then on. I grew up feeling that every rejection or maltreatment from any man for any reason was because I wasn’t worthy of better treatment. When I was twelve, my mother had a relationship with a man she grew to love. For two years she kept him away from my siblings and me, so as not to have someone around who might, in some way, harm her daughters. Eventually he came to live with us, and we grew to like him a lot. He was a father figure—until one day he sexually molested me while I was asleep in my bedroom and my mother was asleep in hers.\n\n“Why are you doing this?” I asked as I awoke. “I was just trying to see if you were messing with those little boys,” he answered. “You could have asked me that,” I snapped back. I stopped him before he had gone too far, but the damage to my psyche had already been done. Again I didn’t tell my mom, even though her greatest fear had come to pass. I had seen her alone and lonely for years, and I didn’t want to get in the way of her happiness with the man she loved. I also didn’t want her to get into trouble for trying to seek retribution against him.\n\nThe incidents with my stepfather and John, as well as my reactions to them, set the tone for my future relationships with men and became par for the course. I ended up being rejected, disrespected, and neglected in every relationship, from puberty up to and including my marriage. When I was eighteen, I was naïve enough to trust the cousin of an ex-boyfriend. I allowed him to take me to visit his girlfriend—only to find that not only was she not home, there was no one there at all. He raped me. “Don’t even think of screaming,” he threatened. “No one else is here, no one will hear you, and you will only piss me off. So, act like you like it!”\n\nWhen I got home that night, I went straight to the bathroom and tried to scrub away the guilt and shame I felt. It did not work. I never told anyone about it because, again, I didn’t want anyone to get in trouble for trying to defend me. Legal recourse never crossed my mind. Again, I just considered it all par for the course.\n\nWhen I met my husband, Linwood, I thought he was my knight in shining armor. He was handsome, intelligent, gallant, chivalrous, generous, and so much fun. After two years I made him my manager. As artist/girlfriend and manager/boyfriend, our relationship was great for two years that was followed by a not-so-terrific one. In the midst of my trouble in paradise, I received a notice from my record company. For no apparent reason, they were not renewing my recording contract, which would expire at the end of the year.\n\nOne night, at one of my shows, I had an accident onstage and woke up the next morning paralyzed from the waist down. I ended up in the hospital for spinal surgery. People were going around the record company saying, “The Queen is dead.” Was I simply a one-hit wonder with “Never Can Say Goodbye”? During the three-month hospital stay that followed, God got my attention. Gripped with fear of abandonment, physical handicap, and showbiz obscurity, I reached out to Him for help.\n\nTrue to form, the Lord didn’t fail me. Within a year I had a massive hit with “I Will Survive,” and Linwood and I were married. Like so many innocent women, I thought, now that we’re married, things will be different; our focus will be on building a happy family together. I wasn’t the perfect wife, but I was attentive, trusting, reassuring, supportive, affectionate, loving, caring, and faithful. Linwood wasn’t all that bad as a husband. He was supportive as far as my career was concerned—physically protective and affectionate. But he took disrespect and disregard to a whole new level. I think he became so self-absorbed that he didn’t care if he was being hurtful to me. He had no concept of commitment and thought a grown man should be free to do whatever he wanted, stay out all night as many nights as he liked—so he did. It’s enough to say, as I often do, that I stayed at that party way too long.\n\nWhat Linwood didn’t count on was the impact of “I Will Survive” and how much it would do for me. When I recorded the song, I thought of it concerning the courage it produced in me regarding my career, my mom’s passing, and the surgery I’d just had, and how it would encourage and inspire other people as well.\n\nNow it became my mantra. It guided me in holding on to my faith and trusting God to bring me victoriously through all my trials and tribulations. I learned that internal scars—like those caused by fatherlessness, my stepfather, my ex-boyfriend’s cousin, and Linwood—put holes in your soul. Those scars can be just as deep as physical ones. They are just as painful and damaging, and generally hurt longer and are more debilitating. It took a while, but I grew strong, and I truly learned how to get along. My courage grew, and I began to recognize my own strength and the power God had placed in me. I spent several more years trying to make my marriage successful. But, as I told my husband on several occasions, “The problem with pushing a person to her limit is that no one knows what her limit is until she reaches it, and then it’s too late.”\n\nIndeed, it became too late. I had reached my limit and came to the conclusion I couldn’t make the marriage work on my own and it was time to end it. My husband had taken up permanent residence in the state of denial and it was time for me to make a move as well. When I told my pastor I was getting a divorce, he asked me how I felt about it. After a long pause, I said, “Free at last, free at last, thank God Almighty, I’m free at last!”\n\nI never missed Linwood because, to tell the truth, he had left me years before the divorce. But it was great getting to know the new me, the me so many abusive men had caused to hide deep down inside. Well, she’s out now. I love her, and God loves her, and she’ll never go into hiding again.\n\nIndeed, I will survive.\n\nI grew up in a middle class Long Island neighborhood with both parents and two siblings. When I was 13 my dad choked to death in front of me and that’s when my problems started. I was heavily involved in sports and my friends and I would drink on the weekends. I never talked about my dad’s death, it was easier to numb my feelings in alcohol. I met my future husband who was 7 years older than me and worked as a butcher and at night in a bar. I would go with all my friends to his bar and it became the local hangout.\n\nMy drinking escalated at that time and the weekend drinking turned into weekdays. I was drinking about 4 days a week. I got engaged and got pregnant so we decided to marry quickly. My husband then became a police officer working evening hours which enabled me to continue partying even after I had my first child.\n\nI was stricken with Rheumatoid Arthritis and the drinking helped cover the pain. I was unable to work because of the pain and my drinking got worse as time went on. I was put on biologic meds and self injections and that coupled with my drinking made my life a living hell. I became pregnant with my second child but unfortunately because of all the meds my son was born with severe eye problems. It was harder and harder to get out of bed every morning and my family was horribly affected. I left my family, moved in with my mom and continued this path of self-destruction. It got to the point where I was so sick and was going to die. I was in and out of detoxes until one day I finally surrendered and went to Long Island Center for Recovery.\n\nI continue to go to meetings every day for the past 8 years which has helped me tremendously in all aspects of my life. It has taken many many years for me to fix my relationship with my kids, my children had to work so hard in order to forgive me and trust me once again. I go one day at a time, sometimes a minute at a time. It took all the strength I had not to fall apart, and you see me, somebody new, did you think I would crumble, did you think I would lay down and die, oh no, not I, “I Will Survive”!\n\nI hate meetings.\n\nI hate your higher power.\n\nI hate anyone who has a program.\n\nTo all who come in contact with me,\n\nI wish you suffering and death.\n\nAllow me to introduce myself…\n\nI am the disease of addiction.\n\nAlcoholism, drugs and eating disorders.\n\nI am cunning, baffling and powerful. Thats me!\n\nI’ve killed millions and enjoyed doing it.\n\nI love to catch you by surprise.\n\nI love pretending I’m your friend and lover.\n\nI’ve given you comfort.\n\nWasn’t I there when you were lonely?\n\nWhen you wanted to die, didn’t you call on me?\n\nI love to make you hurt.\n\nI love to make you cry. Better yet…\n\nI love it when I make you so numb,\n\nYou can’t hurt and you can’t cry.\n\nYou feel nothing at all.\n\nI give you instant gratification.\n\nAll I ask for in return is long term suffering.\n\nI’ve always been there for you.\n\nWhen things were going right, you invited me back.\n\nYou said you didn’t deserve to be happy.\n\nI agreed with you.\n\nTogether we were able to destroy your life.\n\nPeople don’t take me seriously.\n\nThey take strokes seriously.\n\nThey take heart attacks seriously.\n\nEven diabetes, they take seriously.\n\nYet, without my help, these things wouldn’t be possible.\n\nI’m such a hated disease, yet I don’t come uninvited.\n\nYou choose to have me.\n\nMany have chosen me, instead of love and peace.\n\nI hate all of you who work a 12step program.\n\nYour program, your meetings, and your higher power weaken me.\n\nI can’t function in the manner I am accustomed to.\n\nI am your disease.\n\nFor now I must lie here quietly.\n\nYou don’t see me, but I’m growing more powerful everyday.\n\nWhen you settle for mere existence, I thrive.\n\nWhen you feel fully alive, I weaken.\n\nBut I’m always here waiting for you.\n\nUntil we meet again,\n\nI wish you continued suffering and death.\n\nAuthor Unknown\n\nGloria Gaynor entered my life in 1973. I had just scored a volunteer DJ position at a local community centre. The gay community of Toronto at the time was very small but I grew many friendship by joining the activist group that ran the community centre. In late 1973 the popular local all ages discotheque “The Manatee” was buzzing with a mysterious new singer. I peered over the DJ’s shoulder to find out who this was and what it was called … Honeybee by Gloria Gaynor! I rushed to my local small urban R&B record store that imported from Buffalo and got 2 copies. My dance floor buzzed for 5 years to that song. That DJ whose shoulder I peered over once played it 6 times in a row.\n\nWe were all amazed at the success when Never Can Say Goodbye was released the following year, reaching #2 on the local radio charts. The subsequent album of the same name and it’s ground breaking disco suite on one side (along with Real Good People from B) dominated our dancing for years to come. Just about every Gloria Gaynor release in the 70s got heavy disco play & chart action (remember Billboard Disco Chart?) but then 1978 happened. Gloria’s anthem I Will Survive took the world by a storm beyond the discos. Everywhere I went I heard my favorite. I pushed many quarters into the jukebox.\n\nThe turn of the decade was not good to disco, as we all know but in 1983 Gloria brought it all back with I Am What I Am. Joy filled the air again. I lost track of Gloria during the 80s but by the late 80s she was back again with Love Is Just A Heartbeat Away (remix) and continued through the 90s with hits like Perfect World and Oh What A Life. When Oh What A Life was a big club hit I took some chocolate bars to a club and handed them out. I put a label over the name after Oh adding What A Life. In 1998 I joined the internet and the first I searched for was Gloria Gaynor. I fondly remember an early ground break live chat she had at time wherein I expressed to her that she was my #1 to which she replied “I am honored.” My reply was “No I am honored.” I danced in the new year at the turn of the century with Last Night and people in the club would come up to me and ask “Who is singing that?”. The surprise on their faces and declaration that they were going out to buy it made my joy.\n\nThe early 21C brought more happiness with Just Keep Thinking About You when I would shout out to the DJ during the intro “GLORIA!” just before Gloria would chime in “Oh yes it is!” is a cherished memory. Taking the train to visit my parents and playing I Never Knew on my headphones (discman anyone?) while displaying the CD for those who wanted to see or having it on my rental car stereo as I entered my parent’s driveway are forever in my mind. Gloria Gaynor came to Toronto and performed her hits including I Never Knew and one of the high points of my life was when she reached out to me from the stage and invited me to give her kiss on the cheek. Of course I did!\n\nToday I look forward to Gloria’s new Testament. I have always respected her convictions and honesty and her love. As she has said herself, her songs are all about love. Through these decades I have had my losses, my trauma and my joy and through each and everyone of those events a Gloria Gaynor song has been there to see my through.\n\nIn December of 2011 I was diagnosed with a rare disease, Chiari Malformation. Chiari Malformation (CM), which is a neurological disorder. Those with CM have structural defects of their cerebellum where part of their brain descends out of the skull into the spinal area.\n\nMy health journey however started long before December of 2011. Those with rare diseases struggle with finding proper diagnoses. This can lead to many months and or years of hopelessness. Throughout this time people are either treated for something they don’t have or told there is nothing that can be done for them. I experienced both ends of the spectrum.\n\nFor 2 years, starting in the summer of 2009 before my senior year in high school, I was misdiagnosed. I remember going to numerous different doctors appointments receiving the run around and no answers. I began to lose hope and at one point I even felt as if maybe I was just a hypochondriac. However, I was blessed with parents who believed me and never stopped fighting. They didn’t take no for an answer.\n\nThese were two of the hardest years of my life. I had no understanding of what was going on with me. All I knew was I didn’t feel good and nothing would help. I would describe the pressure in my head as a balloon in a jar that you kept putting air into even though it could expand no further. I had to stop all types of physical activity, including dance, which was my passion and outlet. My life came to a complete halt out of the blue.\n\nFast forwarding to December of 2011, I went for my bi-yearly MRI and we received the ominous news that I had Chiari Malformation. We now knew what was affecting me for the past 2 years of my life which was somewhat of a relief but we had no idea of what it was which began a whole new element to my health journey. And since knowledge of rare diseases is not abundant it takes time to find the right place to get help. My family and I found the Chiari Institute, in New York and we booked an appointment for July 23rd. We found out on that day that I was a candidate for surgery and that was my only hope of finding relief, but that the choice was ours. After talking about all of the pros and cons we decided the pros won out and I would purse a surgery date.\n\nFeeling a range of emotions we patiently awaited August 14th to come. As I went back for surgery we could of never anticipated what happened next. I actually ended up having 2 brain surgeries 2 weeks apart, August 14th and August 28th. There were some complications after my first surgery and 12 days later I started to leak cerebrospinal fluid out of my incision, which had me on an emergency flight back to New York and the OR with my life in jeopardy and my future unclear.\n\nToday, almost 5 years later, I am doing great. I do not simply have my passion of dance back in my life, but I am blessed with a dream come true everyday dancing for the NBA and the Detroit Pistons. I no longer am just going through the motions much like I was, but I am LIVING and LOVING life.\n\nLife happens and we can either run from it or run with it. Running from it seems like the easiest route but running with it helps us to become the person we are meant to be. I personally choose to embrace whatever is given to me. It is not always easy and I have my days, which are a struggle, but when it comes down to it I have never regretted facing a challenge. Challenges help us grow and develop into the people are we meant to become. They test us and push us to our limits, sometimes until we break, but the key is that to come through it you have to go through it. I’ve learned through this journey that everything has a purpose and a time even though we may not understand why at the time and sometimes we never will. Most importantly, I’ve learned that life is worth fighting for. I promise if you keep pushing through the tough times, even when all hope seems lost, you will be thankful you did.\n\n“I Will Survive” was beautifully sung just for me by a male survivor friend at my “Celebrate With Me” Book Signing Party. Writing my book, “Listen to the Cry of the Child,” took courage and strength but just hearing those powerful words of Gloria Gaynor’s song, “I was petrified & afraid” made me think over the many things that had transpired in my life when I was a victim. I suddenly realized that I had survived so many severe very dark traumas! As my friend continued to play the piano he looked at me and sang, “Spending so many nights feeling sorry for myself and “thinking about my broken heart” helped me realize that because of my God-given gifts with deep faith and empathy towards those with broken wings, I was a prime target for domestic violence!\n\nI began to think about why I had gone down the path of co- dependancy rescuing people who were just like me. Wow, I heard him sing, “I’ll stay alive”because “I’ve got my whole life to live”and give back to others who are domestic violence survivors. I questioned, perhaps those strengths can become my purpose in helping others who are broken? Gloria’s words cut deep into my soul and I began to have hope for the first time in my life. I honestly didn’t think that I was a survivor but I wept when I heard “I Will Survive” because I knew that he was singing not just for me but for survivors everywhere.\n\nAs a child of a violent crime, I lived with a silent scream for thirty eight years. Growing up as the daughter of a pastor, the sexual abuse began when I was a little child. The “secret” of my grandfather’s incest while treating me to ice cream was unthinkable! He was a Deacon in his church and hid who he really was from everybody.\n\nHe entered my bath time, exposed himself to me and took me alone with him in his car where he asked for sexual favors. He molested me while treating me to ice cream. I found out later that he had also violated my cousins and my mother. She could not protect me & I was unable to tell. He told me not to. I was too little to understand anyway. I wanted nothing to do with him. At age eight, I decided never to get near him again. That stopped his abuse. I was thankful when he died at 101 years of age but sorry that I never got the courage to confront him with what he did to me.\n\nYears later, I discovered the truth when I faced the minister who molested me as a preteen at a Bible camp. He was twenty seven years old, preaching by night and molesting the pastor’s daughters by day at various places at the camp. He singled me out as if picking the sweetest, ripest, freshest, undefiled oranges at the supermarket, fondling me underneath my bathing suit while he laughed and joked at the swimming hole. Those secrets shut me down with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder much like amnesia.\n\nBecause of the memory blocks, school became difficult. I was introverted, shy, had few close friends, panic attacks & nightmares. Like a deaf mute, I became silence about it for decades, desperately wanting to tell someone what was happening in my silent world of memories but unable to do so. Like the silent falling of the snowflakes, no words about it came out and no voice was heard. I screamed but no sound came out of my mouth. There were only tears late at night when no one but God was listening.\n\nThe pain of keeping these dirty secrets buried took a tremendous toll on my body. As I grew into pre-adolescence, I looked undernourished, suffered with anorexia and thought I was ugly. The signs are all there in my pictures I don’t like seeing. I didn’t go through puberty when my friends did. I was mortified when at age sixteen, I hadn’t started my monthly cycle. Not knowing why, my mother took me to the doctors for hormone shots to make my body begin doing something that should have normally happened by then. Who would have suspected it was because of the sexual abuse, least of all me?\n\nAs I grew into young adulthood, I felt as if a wrecking ball had come down on my head and shattered my life like a mirror into a million pieces all over the road of life. I have been trying to pick up the pieces of my life ever since. Just like all the king’s men in “Humpty Dumpty,” I had no idea how to put myself together again. Even though I knew I was created in the image of God, in my shattered state it was impossible to realize that image.\n\nUnable to trust and afraid of men, I didn’t date much but at a small college where I worked, I met the love of my life. Looking into my husband’s eyes at age nineteen, saying our marriage vows on our wedding day, I meant them forever. He was my lover, my protector and my best friend. I trusted him fully. I never dreamed in a million years that I would personally be faced with an affair by my husband after only nine years of marriage. I walked in on him and his lover. I was devastated! Within a year it happened again with someone in our small church. Any form of infidelity requires us to be dishonest with ourselves, with others and with God.\n\nHe tragically lost his father to suicide two years into our marriage. I also believe pornography played a part in his betrayals. I never thought I could trust him again because my trust in people, particularly in men who abused me had shattered me personally as well as my marriage.\n\nYears of emptiness and infertility led to adopting our first born son. I wept when I welcomed another mother’s baby into my arms and home. Five months later I found out I was pregnant with our second son. God answered our prayers, but neither of us knew how to deal with our losses. Seven years later I discovered that I was pregnant with our third son. He was a sweet, gentle baby but because I hadn’t grieved my losses, Postpartum Depression robbed me of the ability to cope. An abuse victim suffers in silence. By remaining silent, and with the fear of anyone discovering my “secret,” the effects of the abuse on my adult life were something far more devastating than the actual abuse!\n\nFreedom came as I was willing to slowly come clean with my secrets. With the support of pastor’s from my childhood denomination, I courageously faced and confronted the clergy who long ago had violated me. He was in complete denial but I chose to forgive him. Seven weeks later I learned that he fell down the stairs and broke his back and died! Writing my memoir from the depths of my soul I was finally able to grieve all my many losses. Reading the chapter with my husband about our marriage betrayal in my book, “Listen to the Cry of the Child” brought closure and healing.\n\nI chose to take the step of forgiveness on my journey to freedom as I went through the grieving process. My husband has too. The best years of our marriage was after writing my book when he acknowledged and owned his part in his marriage betrayals that devastated me! Because he was willing to look at what he did to me, himself and to God, we have finally come to fullness in a love for one another once again. We are very much still in love with one another and will celebrate forty eight years together May 1st, 2013.\n\nForgiveness does not mean forgetting because the pain is so deep and the scars remain. Fear chokes the soul just as weeds choke the most beautiful flowers in the garden. As this fear was beginning to be released, I realized that this the garden of my life could now bloom in the mission I am now on. We can’t change our past but as we begin to heal the wounded child within, the pain will lessen and can become ‘gifts in disguise’ and a purpose in my life. When fear comes uninvited, it needs to become an offering to God and to ourselves to work through that fear in order to free our souls to live!\n\nI am giving back to other’s with broken wings who have not yet found their voices. I teach battered domestic violence survivors, speak in prisons to sex offenders and facilitate a trauma support group called Beauty Out of Ashes. I would never have fulfilled my purpose had I not been able to forgive! I have learned that to forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner is you.\n\nNow, when I hear Gloria Gaynor’s song, “I Will Survive”, I am reminded that I not only am a survivor but have moved from victim to victorious survivor. Yes, “it took all the strength I had not to fall apart and mend the pieces of my broken heart” but because “I grew strong and learned how to get along, I will survive!”"
