        "text": "According to Joel Whitburn's Dance/Disco singles book (2003 edition), Gloria's bio ends with 'The first true disco superstar'. I can't help but agree. Sure, she had maybe 2 well-known hits, but if you look at her long discography and chart positions you'll discover she actually did have a respectable career. Hall-of-fame worthy? Maybe. The more they are putting in dance/disco acts than there's probably a chance. I don't like her signature song 'I Will Survive' (though I understand why people consider it uplifting) but apparently I'm in the minority :)\n\nPosted by Jason Voigt on Sunday, 07/14/2013 @ 12:58pm\n\nGloria Gaynor's song \"I Will Survive\" was the #1 song on a VH-1 show that was 100 Greatest Dance Songs. I also saw her on TV on the 4th of July in Washington, D.C. singing \"I Will Survive.\" She was really good at that performance. I don't know if Gloria Gaynor would get inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame, but \"I Will Survive\" could be an inducted song if it was the top song on a VH-1 list of 100 songs.\n\nPosted by Brian Schonour on Monday, 07/18/2022 @ 22:06pm\n\nGloria featured in the world famous Vi√±a Del Mar festival in the country of Chile as a headliner. She has toured and continues to tour internationally. She is very much loved, and her music is beyond good!\n\nPosted by Gabriela on Monday, 04/22/2024 @ 07:30am"
