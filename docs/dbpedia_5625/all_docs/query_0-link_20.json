        "text": "Gloria Gaynor shares approval for Madonna‘s cover of her 1978 disco hit “I Will Survive.” The 65-year-old pop queen performed her own rendition of the record at her London concert on Saturday (Oct. 14). Gaynor uploaded the clip with a heartwarming message on social media the following day.\n\n“@Madonna congratulations on the launch of #TheCelebrationTour at the @TheO2,” wrote the 80-year-old musician on X. “So happy that you are in good health and ready to have a holiday with fans around the world! By the way, you have excellent taste in music!”\n\nThe message in the song holds true for Madonna as the tour was postponed due to a serious health scare. According to the New York Times, the Celebration Tour kicked off at the O2 Arena in London on Saturday (Oct. 14), three months after the previously scheduled date. The “Material Girl” suffered from a serious bacterial infection, leaving her in the intensive care unit for multiple days.\n\n“I forgot five days of my life, or my death,” she announced on stage. “I don’t really know where I was, but the angels were protecting me.\n\nShe continued, “If you want to know my secret, and you want to know how I pull through and how I survive, I thought, ‘I’ve got to be there for my children. I have to survive for them,’” before performing the aforementioned hit.\n\nThe 78-date tour continues through April 2024 with additional European stops as well as North American concerts in cities including Chicago, New York, Cleveland, Los Angeles, and Mexico City. Due to rescheduling, shows in Tulsa, Nashville, San Francisco, Las Vegas, and Phoenix were canceled.\n\nCheck out the other tour dates below.\n\nUnited Kingdom and Europe Leg\n\nOct. 14 — London, England, at The O2\n\nOct. 15 — London, England, at The O2\n\nOct. 17 — London, England, at The O2\n\nOct. 18 — London, England, at The O2\n\nOct. 21 — Antwerp, Belgium, at Sportpaleis\n\nOct. 22 — Antwerp, Belgium, at Sportpaleis\n\nOct. 25 — Copenhagen, Denmark, at Royal Arena\n\nOct. 26 — Copenhagen, Denmark, at Royal Arena\n\nOct. 28 — Stockholm, Sweden, at Tele2 Arena\n\nNov. 1 — Barcelona, Spain, at Palau Sant Jordi\n\nNov. 2 — Barcelona, Spain, at Palau Sant Jordi\n\nNov. 6 — Lisbon, Portugal, at Altice Arena\n\nNov. 7 — Lisbon, Portugal, at Altice Arena\n\nNov. 12 — Paris, France at Accor Arena\n\nNov. 13 — Paris, France, at Accor Arena\n\nNov. 15 — Cologne, Germany, at Lanxess Arena\n\nNov. 16 — Cologne, Germany, at Lanxess Arena\n\nNov. 19 — Paris, France, at Accor Arena\n\nNov. 20 — Paris, France, at Accor Arena\n\nNov. 23 — Milan, Italy, at Mediolanum Forum\n\nNov. 25 — Milan, Italy, at Mediolanum Forum\n\nNov. 28 — Berlin, Germany, at Mercedes-Benz Arena\n\nNov. 29 — Berlin, Germany, at Mercedes-Benz Arena\n\nDec. 1 — Amsterdam, Netherlands, at Ziggo Dome\n\nDec. 2 — Amsterdam, Netherlands, at Ziggo Dome\n\nDec. 5 — London, England, at The O2\n\nDec. 6 — London, England, at The O2\n\nNorth American Leg\n\nDec. 13 — Brooklyn at Barclays Center\n\nDec. 14 — Brooklyn at Barclays Center\n\nDec. 16 — Brooklyn at Barclays Center\n\nDec. 18 — Washington, D.C., at Capital One Arena\n\nDec. 19 — Washington, D.C., at Capital One Arena\n\nJan. 8 — Boston at TD Garden\n\nJan. 9 — Boston at TD Garden\n\nJan. 11 — Toronto at Scotiabank Arena\n\nJan. 12 — Toronto at Scotiabank Arena\n\nJan. 15 — Detroit, Michigan, at Little Caesars Arena\n\nJan. 18 — Montreal at Bell Centre\n\nJan. 20 — Montreal at Bell Centre\n\nJan. 22 — New York City at Madison Square Garden Arena\n\nJan. 23 — New York City at Madison Square Garden Arena\n\nJan. 25 — Philadelphia at Wells Fargo Center\n\nJan. 29 — New York City at Madison Square Garden Arena\n\nFeb. 1 — Chicago at United Center\n\nFeb. 2 — Chicago at United Center\n\nFeb. 5 — Pittsburgh at PPG Paints Arena\n\nFeb. 8 — Cleveland, Ohio, at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse\n\nFeb. 13 — Saint Paul, Minnesota, at Xcel Energy Center\n\nFeb. 17 — Seattle, Washington, at Climate Pledge Arena\n\nFeb. 18 — Seattle, Washington, at Climate Pledge Arena\n\nFeb. 21 — Vancouver at Rogers Arena\n\nFeb. 24 — Sacramento, California, at Golden 1 Center\n\nFeb. 27 — San Francisco at Chase Center\n\nFeb. 28 — San Francisco at Chase Center\n\nMarch 1 — Las Vegas at T-Mobile Arena\n\nMarch 2 — Las Vegas at T-Mobile Arena\n\nMarch 4 — Los Angeles at Kia Forum\n\nMarch 5 — Los Angeles at Kia Forum\n\nMarch 7 — Los Angeles at Kia Forum\n\nMarch 9 — Los Angeles at Kia Forum\n\nMarch 11 — Los Angeles at Kia Forum\n\nMarch 13 — Palm Desert, California, at Acrisure Arena\n\nMarch 16 — Phoenix, Arizona, at Footprint Center\n\nMarch 19 — Denver, Colorado, at Ball Arena\n\nMarch 24 — Dallas, Texas, at American Airlines Center\n\nMarch 25 — Dallas, Texas at American Airlines Center\n\nMarch 28 — Houston, Texas, at Toyota Center\n\nMarch 29 — Houston, Texas, at Toyota Center\n\nApril 1 — Atlanta, Georgia, at State Farm Arena\n\nApril 4 — Tampa, Florida, at Amalie Arena\n\nApril 6 — Miami at Kaseya Center\n\nApril 7 — Miami at Kaseya Center\n\nApril 14 — Austin, Texas, at Moody Center\n\nApril 15 — Austin, Texas, at Moody Center\n\nApril 20 — Mexico City at Palacio De Los Deportes\n\nApril 21 — Mexico City at Palacio De Los Deportes\n\nApril 23 — Mexico City at Palacio De Los Deportes\n\nApril 24 — Mexico City at Palacio De Los Deportes"
