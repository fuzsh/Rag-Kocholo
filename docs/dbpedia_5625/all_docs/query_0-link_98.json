        "text": "Category Archives: Blog\n\nVered, where have you been?\n\n“Hello? Vered? Are you still there?”\n\nYes, dear Tunie. I am. And it’s time I check in and let you know where I’ve been, why, and what I’ve learned in the process.\n\nIf you’ve taken a Baby in Tune class before you know that we always do Check-Ins where parents say wonderful and challenging moments they had with their baby during the week.\n\nWell, here’s mine:\n\nAfter the road trip across the US we decided to knock another item off our bucket list – living in Israel for a year. One year turned into a wonderful two, and during that time we had Friday night dinners with the grandparents, my kids got in touch with their Israeliness (absolute authenticity along with a complete disregard for standing on lines,) and I learned how to surf (or at least how to overcome my fear of it, and keep trying again and again).\n\nProfessionally, I allowed myself to take a big fat break from the hustle. The pandemic threw a monkey wrench into my business, and moving across the world lodged it in deeper. Slowly I felt myself losing interest in writing another blog, creating another reel, scrambling to fill classes. I stepped off the fast train and took a look around.\n\nInstead, I went inward; I spent more time with the kids, meditated more regularly, wrote songs with no audience in mind. I also worked on a book based on all the years I’ve worked with YOU all. The quiet mornings spent writing in a coffeeshop suited me perfectly, and led to a book that will be published in 2025 by Countryman Press/ W.W. Norton!\n\nAnd now we’re back. And two things happened:\n\n1. The achievement bug is back. My word for 2024 is CREATE. I’ve got renewed energy to learn more, create more, help more. It felt right to let the hustle go while I was in Israel. And as I suspected might happen, coming back to the US cracked that door open once again.\n\nAnd antithetically,\n\n2. The war. The terrorist attack in Israel and the war in Gaza following have had me feeling mute in shock and despair. The anti-semitism unearthed as a result has been a terrible wake-up call.\n\nBut this post isn’t about politics. It is about my internal conflict, confronted once again, between a private life and a public one.\n\nAnyone who wants to make stuff these days must also use the platforms we have. And to really be effective at it, you have to enjoy it 🙂 I knew I couldn’t while I was away, but the detective part of me, intrigued by figuring out what grabs people’s attention, how to best word a post, and what parenting problems need solving, is back. It’s a roller coaster, and can be disheartening, but I’m ready for it again.\n\n[Important to note – the fact that I’ve had time or energy to explore whether I’m in the game or out of it is because my kids are a little older. They don’t need as much from me. It’s not like when they were little and it was almost impossible to access the non-mom parts of me. That might be where you are right now. If so, I just wanted to say that you won’t be there forever.]\n\nSo now that I’m back in it, I have more perspective on what I learned while I was away. I hope I don’t forget these lessons as I get back on the achievement ladder:\n\nLife is pretty great without the hustle. You do your work, focus on in-person connection, have more time for the kids, and are less stressed about the future. Without the focus on the demonstrative aspects of what you do, there’s much more energy left over.\n\nAt the same time, the hustle is fuel. If you’re like me and you have an itch to create stuff, you also want people to receive it. Recently I read a great book by Seth Godin called The Icarus Deception. He says that today’s world champions connection over industry, and that social media is a means to getting your ART (broadly defined as anything done artfully, with intention, innovation, creativity) out into the world. He says:\n\n“We built this world for you. Not so you would watch more online videos, keep up on your feeds, and lol with your highschool friends. We built it so you could do what you’re capable of, without apology and without excuse. Go” Social media is not all bad. It can also can charge us to make more, make better, change things.\n\nYou can step out of it. You don’t have to keep running on the hamster wheel if it doesn’t feel right. There are other ways to make ends meet. It took me a while to shed the belief that if I stepped off I’d never find my way back on. But lo and behold, the wheel is right where I left it.\n\nIt’s not just me. My step away was not just a function of where I personally am with my life (hello, midlife crisis), but is part of the gestalt of this era. Covid was a harsh reminder of what’s actually important, leaders of countries are more extreme and polarizing, climate change disasters are right in front of our eyes. There’s a growing pressure in the air that we all feel. I did flight. Now I’m back for fight.\n\nMeditation helps. I can’t stress this one enough. The past few years have been wonderful but also very challenging – the kids acclimating to a new language and culture, starting life in a new country and now in a new town, processing the horrors of the war. Over and over I notice that when I drop my meditation practice I have a harder time breathing and dealing with it all. When I start up once again I’m more at ease, creative, and patient. I love Tara Broch on Insight Timer. In addition, two podcasts help me access the part of me that’s more meditative, feels more expansive, less focused on the grind of it all: Poetry Unbound. This is the quickest dose of perspective you can get. In these 10-12 minute episodes you’ll connect to a deeper calmer part of yourself . 10% Happier. This series where Dan travels to interview the Dalai Lama is worth a listen. He’s cynical and skeptical in a way that makes the material that much more accessible.\n\nSay yes to the kids. This began in Israel but has really been hammered home since the war – when my kids ask to play a game I say YES, I stop and gaze when my daughter is cutting something and the tip of her tongue sticks out between her lips, I marvel at my son’s long fingers as he plays piano, I give my son a massage before bed even when I’m exhausted. I hope to hold on to this even as I step back in to the hustle.\n\nSo what now?\n\nBaby in Tune is in Jersey, baby. And also Brooklyn and Manhattan, of course. You can find classes in Montclair, Maplewood, Livingston, Tenafly, etc. Check out the schedule HERE.\n\nKnow anyone in those areas? Let them know.\n\nI’ll keep making stuff. I usually post them on Instagram and TikTok. Please follow me on those platforms so I feel the connection and not just a reach in vain. Not sure yet if I’ll write a weekly blog again but for now you can get good tips on the socials.\n\nThe book! Here’s how you can help – I’m looking for big names to write a foreword. Know any? Dr. Becky? Daniel Stern? Aliza Pressman? Janet Lansbury? If so, please do connect me.\n\nOk dear Tunies, I’m glad to be back. I missed you even while I didn’t feel like writing to you lol.\n\nLove,\n\nVered\n\nPs. Do you really want to help me with the roller coaster of social media that can be so dismally discouraging? Here’s how. It’s easy- If you see a post of mine, like this one, make a comment. It can be ANYTHING. You can write oatmeal muffins if you like. When you comment it helps others see the post. Also, share it with your friends who have babies.\n\nMy Resolution for 2023 (and what I’ve learned about parenting in Israel)\n\nDear Tunester, Today I give you my resolution for 2023 and what I learned about parenting from living in Israel for the last year and a half.\n\nHappy new year dear Tunester! It’s 2023! Do you have a resolution for this year? Here’s mine…\n\nA friend of mine was over recently when she asked my eldest, whose arms were crossed in front of his chest, what was written on his shirt. He grunted and didn’t make a move to bring his arms down.\n\nI waited a second, and then instinctively reached over and opened his arms.\n\nMy friend shot me a disapproving look and said- “Why did you do that?”\n\nAnd I thought – Why had I done that? It’s not like my friend had a burning curiosity about the shirt (which, by the way, was adorable. It had a picture of a guitar and a ukulele and the guitar was saying to the uke – “Uke, I am your father.”) She was just trying to engage him in a non-threatening way.\n\nMeanwhile, I was stuck in a moment of anxiety – I so wanted him to be personable with her, for her to love him, for him to love her, that without realizing it I intervened and possibly made him feel uncomfortable.\n\nAnd that leads me to the lesson I’ve learned during my last year and a half in israel – let the kids be.\n\nSo My Resolution for 2023 –\n\nLET THE KIDS BE.\n\nAnd along with it, because our attitude to our kids is completely intertwined with our attitude to ourselves,\n\nLET MYSELF BE.\n\nThis lesson is contrary to every grain in my body – I was raised in a family where success is expected and prowess is to be displayed. I was also raised in the US where life is showy. Instagram perfectly showcases family success, parenting wins, vacation fun, career accomplishments.\n\nI come by it honestly. It’s in my genes and my Levi’s jeans. But being in Israel has challenged that.\n\nLetting the kids be means not getting caught up in how my son’s behavior looks to others, what he should or shouldn’t be doing.\n\nIt means having a clear sense of where my job begins and where it ENDS. As a mom, my job is to keep the kids safe, give them love, and slowly teach skills that will help them live independently and have a gratifying life.\n\nIt is NOT to ensure their success or achievements, to manipulate how others see them, or to make them seem cool, smart, beautiful, charming, talented, in the eyes of others.\n\nLetting the kids be means trusting their process completely. When your baby cries through dinner at a restaurant, your toddler whines at music class, your kid is challenged at school, or your pre-teen doesn’t have a social life or is acting out at home, it means accepting them AS IS while continuing to do your job (safety, love, teach skills.)\n\nIt’s tempting to make a sweeping, Bringing Up Bebe-type statement about Israeli culture and the way they raise their kids, but my research sample is narrow.\n\nI can say that from what I’ve seen, Israeli parents are very trusting of their kids. School age kids roam around the neighborhood on their own, and highschoolers have co-ed sleepovers. My son’s highschool gives them 3 “mental health days” that they can use any time during the year to skip school.\n\nAlso, if you’ve never been to Israel, you might be shocked to see teenagers in the army wielding rifles on the crosstown bus 😳\n\nIn America, from my experience, the child is held under the parents wing for longer, and along with it comes the feeling that the kids’ successes are interlinked with the parents’.\n\nWhen I was living in New York I remember feeling a need for my kids to be perceived a certain way – smart, active, social. It probably had a lot to do with my stage of motherhood, my community, and everything to do with who I am.\n\nBut this year I’ve been available to learn a new way. My husband has played a big part. He’s been instrumental in teaching me to let myself be because he does it so effortlessly. Here’s a song I recently wrote about it.\n\nEven in the midst of my current midlife identity crisis, I’ve been able to be more patient and compassionate to myself.\n\nThat’s why you’re only getting this New Years post now, two days after 2023 began. Because I let myself be. I didn’t disrupt our family’s weekend or end of year celebrations. I knew there would be time to circle back around and connect to you all.\n\nSo dear Tunester, what can you do this year to let your kids be? To trust their process and growth even if it looks different from what you expect? They’re wonderful, they’re doing exactly what they need to be doing, and your love is allowing them to be exactly who they are.\n\nLove,\n\nVered\n\nP.S. After I wrote this I went back and looked at my resolution for 2022 to see how/if I’ve grown. It’s similar, I take it a step further this year in a way I couldn’t have imagined.\n\nFeeling second child guilt? Try THIS\n\nDear Tunester, today let’s talk about what to do when you’re feeling second child guilt – that you’re not giving attention to your eldeset once the baby comes along.\n\nIf you have more than one kid you know the torture of Attention Divided. The guilt! The yearning!\n\nEvery minute feels like a modern parent’s Sophie’s Choice – do I tend to the toddler crying by the slide or the baby who needs to nurse asap? Do I leave the toddler in the living room and spend the time I know it will take to put the baby down in the crib? Do I play another game with the toddler while ignoring the baby in the bouncy seat?\n\nThe constant weighing is enough to drive a mama insane.\n\nThere is only one cure for this predicament:\n\nReducing your attention to ONE – spending time with each kid one on one.\n\nPerhaps right away you’re thinking – impossible! I don’t have time for that! I barely have enough time to make dinner, never mind a blessed yoga class.\n\nBut dear Tunester, your date can be short. And with the hack I’m about to give you, it will still be impactful for all.\n\nHow to make a date with your kid count\n\nYour date doesn’t have to be long for your kid’s love cup to be filled, and for YOUR cup to be filled so you can do away with some of the guilt.\n\nOf course, excursions like going to a museum or movie are exciting. But they’re not practical on a weekly basis.\n\nHere are some short mini-date ideas:\n\nGoing to have a hot chocolate at the coffee shop.\n\nGoing to the park to collect leaves.\n\nSitting in a separate room and drawing together.\n\nTaking a bikeride.\n\nEven going food shopping.\n\nNow here’s the important part.\n\nYour date needs to FEEL special. It has to give your child the feeling that you’re putting down everything to be with them. They want your undivided attention whether it’s for 15 minutes, 30 minutes or an hour.\n\nHow to make a shift from normal day to day to Date Time.\n\nThe best way to kick off your date and make it clear to your child that you are theirs for the next period of time is with a SONG.\n\nYour song will do many things. It will:\n\nMake the transition clear from regular life to date time.\n\nMake things feel light and happy.\n\nPut YOU in the mood and remind you to shift your focus.\n\nDevelop a “together song” that you’ll share with this child and will have forever.\n\nHaving a song that you only sing every time you start your Together Time will make it feel special and will help you both shift your mood and your focus to each other.\n\nSo what’s your song going to be?\n\nHere are some ideas:\n\nYou are my sunshine (my version 🙂\n\nTogether at last (Annie)\n\nWe go together (Grease)\n\nBetter Together (Jack Johnson)\n\nTogether Forever (Rick Astley)\n\nHappy Together (The Turtles)\n\nI Want to Hold Your Hand (Beatles)\n\nThe More We Get Together (Rafi)\n\nA Bushel and a Peck (Doris Day)\n\nJust the Two of Us (Bill Withers)\n\nMake one up!\n\nHere’s my promise to you:\n\nIf you actually do this, and sing your song every time you set out on a date together, no matter how long it is, this song will become magical for you both.\n\nIt will set the tone for togetherness for years to come.\n\nOnce you’re on your date, try this game to make your child feel adored and appreciated.\n\nSpeaking of siblings, do you need some ways to help your kiddos get along? Try these 10 hacks.\n\nSo dear Tunester, what do you think? will you try to have a date song to kick off your time together? Which will you use?\n\nDo you have a friend riddled with second-kid guilt right about now who needs to hear this? Send this their way!

I scrambled to find new ways to stretch my baby’s mind and, more importantly, amuse us both.\n\nSo today I’ll offer 3 new ways to keep you both happily busy. But first – a question to figure out their stage of development –\n\nIf you take something away from your baby – do they look for it?\n\nIf they’ve started to show some signs of searching for a hidden toy, then they’ve hit an important milestone that psychologists call Object Permanence.\n\nWhat does it mean to become aware of object permanence?\n\nThat your baby is learning and sensing that something continues to exist even when they can no longer see it.\n\nThat’s a big deal!! This development affects their cognitive, emotional and social development.\n\nHere’s a quick rundown and how it affects their development. Then, scroll down to learn three activities your baby will love right about now.\n\nSocial.\n\nKnowing an object continues to exist means knowing that YOU continue to exist even after you leave. Has your baby been crying more as you leave? If so, they may no longer accept it as a given. Now they have the knowledge that when they don’t see you you’re somewhere, just not with them.\n\nYour baby’s disovery might be distressing for them at fist (and for you to hear their crying,) but its a necessary leap in their growth.\n\nCognitive.\n\nWhen your baby was an infant they were completely egocentric. Meaning, they couldn’t conceptualize a world that existed separate from their experience and point of view.\n\nAs they’ve grown your baby has been able ot develop a mental representation of things. Meaning, when you say banana they can imagine a banana in their mind even though they don’t see one in front of them.\n\nEmotional.\n\nWhen you take a toy away form your baby they might not cry as they did before. Instead, they’re able to contain they’re frustration and set about looking for where the toy went. That’s a big step in starting to manage difficult emotions and problem solve.\n\nNow let’s talk about activities you can do that will spark your baby’s interest, develop their curiosity, and help them manage emotions that come with this new burgeoning awareness.\n\nThe Magician\n\nStep 1 – put a small object on the table. Let your baby see it and touch it. then cover it with an upside down cup. Can your baby find the object? If not, teach your baby what happened. Show them the steps again. Reveal the object underneath. Your baby might need several repetitions of this activity.\n\nIf your baby can find the object underneath, try step 2.\n\nStep 2 – Take 3 cups and 1 small object. Now bring out your inner streetside magician. Put all of the cups upside down with one of them over the small object. Let your baby explore and find the object.\n\nPeekaboo Variation\n\nPeekaboo is wonderful for helping your baby practice object permanence and separation and reunion with you. Let’s try it a little differently this time.\n\nInstead of you or or baby hiding behind a scarf as you usually do, use a doll or puppet and put the scarf over the puppet. Let the puppet say – “where is baby? Where are you?” And let your baby reveal the doll.\n\nTo add animals and even more fun to your peekaboo, try using this song.\n\nHidden Treasure\n\nFor this activity you need is a box/basket/bowl. You’re going to fill your box with various objects – a beloved toy, day to day objects your baby doesn’t often see or play with, a book they love.\n\nFor the younger babies who are just learning object permanence, leave an object exposed so your baby knows to look under the cloth.\n\nFor the older babies cover the basket completely and hand it to your baby. Let them discover and explore the objects one by one. Then, put them all back in and do it again.\n\nWhich of these activities did your baby respond to most? Could you see their wheels turning as they were trying to understand where the objects went? Comment below and let me know.\n\nIn the middle of playing and your baby needs a diaper change? Try this hack to make it much easier and more enjoyable for you both.\n\nHow to hack diaper changing\n\nDear Tunester, today you’re going to learn a way to make diaper changing go from struggle to smooth sailing.\n\nI bet you didn’t realize how deep in shit you would be as a parent, in more ways than one. But today let’s focus on the literal.\n\nHow many times a day do you deal POOP? Checking, smelling, changing, and cleaning…A LOT.\n\nNow if you’ve got a pre-crawler diaper changing might still be somewhat chill. But if your baby is on the move it may have already turned into a wrestling match.\n\nSo what do you do? It’s simple.\n\nUse a Diaper-Changing Song.\n\nYup, sing while you wipe. It can be about pee, poop, diapers or anything really. A Diaper-Changing Song is part-reminder, part-timer.\n\nHere’s why it will work:\n\n1. It lets your baby know that changing is about to happen.\n\nIf you start to sing your diaper-changing song as you are bringing the diaper and as you start to undress the baby, then your baby will know it’s coming. Part of what they hate so much is that you are interrupting their play. It’s like my kids protesting when I call them to dinner – “Wait a minute! I’m in the middle!” A song can let your baby know that they’re about to be changed.\n\n2. It can be a time keeper.\n\nBabies are intuitively musical. Whithin a few times of singing your song, your baby will start to recognize it. Not only that, they’ll understand know the beginning, the middle and the end. Babies seem to understand song structure. Often in my groups, babies as young as eight months old start to clap toward the end of the song because they know it’s about to end. Use the song as a way to tell your baby how long the diaper changing will take. It will behave like a sand timer and your baby will feel a bit more in control.\n\nDon’t have a Diaper-Changing Song? Let’s make it happen.\n\nIt’s possible that you already have a song but you don’t think about it as one. Do you ever find yourself singing silly ditties about poop, not peeing in your face or staying still? That’s all I’m talking about.\n\nDon’t overthink it. You can write a silly ditty on your own. Start by noticing what you say as you’re changing your baby’s diaper. If you usually say, “Please don’t pee on me” or “You are a poopy head,” then put that in the song. It could look something like this:\n\n“You’re my little poopy head\n\nLet’s go get you clean\n\nBut baby hold still –\n\nAnd please don’t pee on me”\n\nI am sure you can come up something better than that. It’s really about noticing the melody you already use in your speech when you’re speaking to your baby.\n\nImagine how you would say – “Come here stinky pants.” Probably with a little sing-song in your voice. Use that for your ditty!\n\nRemember – it doesn’t have to win a Grammy. But if you’re able to write a short song that you sing every time you go to change your baby’s diaper, the task will become so much easier. Not only that, you’ll be one step ahead and ready for the squirmy stage.\n\nSo dear Tunester, what song makes your life easier at the changing table? COMMENT below and let me know.\n\nCan it top: “Wipe wipe wipe your butt / gently wipe the stream”? Do tell. I love to hear what little ones respond to. Comment below.\n\nWant to use a changing song I wrote? Try this one.\n\nDid you catch last week’s post in which I shared the 5 things I would never do as a therapist of babies and parents?

There are so many things I know today that I was clueless about back then. Important things! If I could only go back and talk to that frazzled and overwhelmed mama with an infant in her hands and a toddler jumping on the sofa…\n\nBut dear Tunester, I can’t do that. So the next best thing is to tell YOU all and hope that my wisdom, born of my professional experience and my never-ending search to be a better mama can help you through this time a bit.\n\nA recent trend on TikTok had professionals giving short bits of useful advice from their years of experience in the field. I learned that doctors in the ER would never let their kids jump on a trampoline, and that a dentist would never drink out of a beer bottle in a crowded bar.\n\nSo here are mine (To see the post on Tik Tok click here):\n\n5 things I would never do as a therapist who works with parents and babies.\n\n1. I’d never get too obsessed about my baby’s schedule.\n\nI really wish I could have told myself this one years ago when I had my first. I approached my baby’s schedule like an army general grasping for some order.\n\n15:00 – Meal time!\n\nT-4 – Sleep time!\n\nWho was I kidding? The baby was my commander.\n\nBy my third I realized that the schedule eventually falls into place. The real work is finding the balance between following the baby’s lead and nudging their sleep and eating windows into consistent times when possible. Until of course they shift their schedule once again.\n\nWhat I’ve seen from myself and you all over and over is that obsessing over ANYTHING baby related takes away from our bonding with our baby. Meaning, it shifts our focus from a flexible, open minded approach to a goal-oriented one.\n\nObsessing over the schedule is like being on a nature hike and burying your head in the map instead of enjoying the way the sun flickers through the trees and the salamander scurrying across your path\n\n2. I’d never take on all the baby parenting tasks because I don’t like the way my partner does it.\n\nI’ve seen this one over and over. One parent (often the mom but not always), feels that the other doesn’t know how to put the baby to sleep, change the diaper the right way, or soothe effectively. Usually the parent giving the critique is the one who spends more time with the baby and has had more opportunities for trial and error. They’ve figured out what works and what doesn’t, and when their partner tries the method that has failed, they can’t help but intervene – “not like that! Forget it, I’ll just do it myself”.\n\nBut what happens is disaster – the main parent takes on more and more tasks and the other parent slowly gives over control – having even less chance to practice and losing even more confidence.\n\nThe only way to avoid this pitfall is for the main parent to step away for stretches of time and let their partner become an expert in their own way. The more time they’ll have alone with the baby, the more empowered they’ll feel.\n\n3. I’d never keep my feelings about isolation, depression and anxiety to myself.\n\nEven with increasing awareness about postpartum depression, moms still feel shame when it rolls around. It’s so hard to parse apart – are we overwhelmed because of lack of sleep? The extreme lifestyle change? The monotony of the day? The isolation? Or the hormones? Our internal voice often says – that’s just how motherhood is I guess.\n\nBut keeping it to ourselves makes us feel even more isolated and anxious as the days go on, which makes us plummet even further. The fact is that all new parents feel some degree of anxiety, depression and isolation when their baby is born. Post partum depression can look very different for each person. For me, it showed up as anxiety. For someone else, it may look like sadness. Not sharing how we feel with others can increase our feeling that something is wrong with us and make us feel even worse in an already difficult time.\n\n4. I’d never judge another parent for doing something that seems wrong to me.\n\nOver the years, I’ve found that the things that we feel most strongly about when it comes to parenting, the declarations we make about how we’ll behave as parents (when I’m a parent, I’ll never do… or my kids will be…) are the ones that come back to bite us in the diaper.\n\nOnce we’ve actually got the unsoothable baby in our arms, or have experienced our 24th night in a row of poor sleep, we surprise ourselves with the decisions we make just to stay afloat. parenting a baby is hard and everyone is just doing their best.\n\nThat said if you see someone doing something concerning ask questions. See if your assumptions are justified.\n\n5. I’d never insist on one philosophy or one approach.\n\nYou know why there are so many books on parenting? Because there is not ONE WAY that is best. For instance, you can find endless approaches for how to get your baby to sleep. At this point we don’t have the magic answer.\n\nNot only that, your baby is constantly changing, and their needs shift daily . Taking care of a baby demands that we be flexible all the time and be sensitive to our own needs as much as the baby’s. Committing to one parenting approach means listening to a book created for the average baby instead of taking cues from the very unique baby in your arms and the relationship unfolding between you both.\n\nTo read the 9 things I wish someone had said to me when I had my baby, click here.\n\nSo there you have it. That’s my list. What would you add to it? Comment below and let me know.\n\nDo you have a friend who could use these 5 Don’t Dos right now? Send them this post and tell them to sign up for more to come.\n\nWhat it’s like to think like your baby\n\nDear Tunester, today let’s dive into the minds of our babies and see how it is to think like them.\n\nImagine you just entered a wild costume party, in a circus, with musicians playing music in every corner.\n\nSenses overload! What do you look at first? Your eyes dart from one costume to the next, you gaze up at the trapeze artists, and your ears strain to hear the different types of music.\n\nThat’s how babies feel in the world all the time.\n\nIt’s hard for us to imagine it because we’ve learned how to focus on one thing at a time. Not only that, we’ve become accustomed to most things in the world. It takes a lot to surprise us. But your baby is in a state of constantly taking in ALL of the newness around them.\n\nAlison Gopnick, a researcher who looks at child development, says that babies are bad at narrowing down their focus to just one thing but very good at taking in lots of information from different sources at once.\n\nThey’re flooded with neurotransmitters that induce learning and plasticity but don’t have inhibitory parts of their brain activated yet.\n\n“When people say that babies can’t pay attention it’s more that they’re bad at paying attention to one thing”. Gopnick says. Babies are taking in all things at once.\n\nAdult brains behave differently.\n\nIf you entered that circus scenario, your consciousness would expand to take in everything at once too. That’s why new experiences like those feel so memorable and full of adventure.\n\nBut we can’t survive in that realm all the time. Adults need to get stuff done! And that takes planning, narrowing down our focus, and a lot of executive function.\n\nYour baby is a scientist collecting data.\n\nYour baby is not concerned with planning for the future. They’re concerned with figuring out how the world in front of them works. I’m sure you’ve noticed this. You can actually see them weighing objects, feeling shapes, assessing temperatures, experimenting with gravity, and identifying patterns.\n\nIn an organization babies would be part of the Research and Development team – they’re constantly learning and gathering information. We adults, on the other hand, are here to put that information to good use.\n\nHow can we use this information?\n\nBecause babies learn through observation, imitation and experimentation, we need to give them plenty of hands on opportunities to do so.\n\nSo Parent, don’t worry if you’re not showing them alphabet flashcards and giving them math drills. Your job is simply to give them space to explore the world, to speak to them (or read to them like this), sing to them, and delight in their surprise with them.\n\nThey’ve got their senses open and are ready to take it all in. But don’t be surprised when they meltdown after short periods of time or wake up after short bouts of sleep. Their brains are on overload.\n\nSo what’s it like to think like a baby?\n\n“It’s like being in love in Paris for the first time after you’ve had three double espressos. That’s a fantastic way to be but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at 3 oclock in the morning.”\n\nAlison Gopnick\n\nDo you have a friend who’d like to know more about how her baby thinks? Send her this blog and tell her to sign up for more below.\n\nAre you on TikTok? Come find me! I post daily videos there on how to connect with your baby.\n\nHave you noticed how your baby thinks? Comment below and let me know.\n\nWhat instruments to buy for your baby\n\nDear Tunester,\n\nYou know by now that music-making with your baby doesn’t require any instruments. You’ve got it all in your body, voice, and hands.\n\nThat said, instruments can be a great way to get your baby excited about music. It can be surprisingly delightful to blow into a harmonica and hear a chord, or tap with a mallet on a xylophone and hear a bell tone. Your baby’s delight in hearing these sounds can inspire more and that’s what we want.\n\nBelow is a list of some of my favorite instruments for babies and toddlers.\n\nImportant tips to keep in mind:\n\nYour baby will love music if YOU enjoy music with them and in front of them.\n\nThere’s no wrong way to play instruments! And you want to also convey to your baby that all music is “experimental.”\n\nTry not to get cheap stuff that sounds bad and falls apart easily. If it makes you want ot sit and play with it, it will probably do the same for your baby.\n\nAll of these instruments will say 3+ on them. That doesn’t mean that your baby can’t use them, it just means that she/he should be supervised when they do.\n\nWhat instruments to buy for your baby:\n\n*I am not affiliated with any of these brands.\n\n1. Shakers\n\nThis a great first instrument for your baby. As soon as your baby starts to grasp, and doesn’t seem jarred by the sound, you can hand them one of these. Most likely they’ll end up in their mouths at first and that’s totally fine.\n\nThere are very cheap shakers out there that don’t sound great to me and can bust open, spreading small beads everywhere. Avoid those.\n\nMy favorites are these wooden shakers. They are slightly bigger than the plastic ones which makes them harder to put into little mouths. That said, never give your baby a shaker if you’re not around to watch.\n\nThese colorful plastic Shakers have a great sound and don’t fall apart easily. These fruit-shaped Shakers are fun and sound good too.\n\n2. Drums\n\nIf you’ve been in a Baby in Tune class for older babies, you know that we often dive into drum circles and learn drumming rhythms and styles from other cultures. For years I’ve been looking for drums that don’t take up too much space and still sound good. I finally found them! These nested Frame Drums are perfect for pulling out and having a family drum circle and then being able to store them away.\n\nAs another option – these Djembes sound great and come in different sizes.\n\nIt’s really fun to play drums along to your baby’s favorite songs. Try Peekaboo, Little Bit Tough, and You Are My Sunshine for some fun songs of mine to play drums with.\n\n3. Harmonicas\n\nHarmonicas are a great first instrument for your baby. They’re are built in one key, so if you are playing a song on the speakers or on the guitar, you can easily play a song in the key of your harmonica.\n\nShowing your baby how to play a harmonica can be a great motivator for them to learn how to blow. Sometimes it helps to blow on their cheek or to blow bubbles and then blow into the harmonica in order to illustrate the concept.\n\nI used to recommend these colorful, plastic Harmonicas, which can take a beating and have a decent sound. But there is a risk of the screws coming out and being a choking hazard.\n\nI love this one which is made fully baby safe (I actually haven’t had a chance to try it yet so please let me know how it sounds if you do.\n\n4. Glockenspiels\n\nThis is an arrangement of metal bars laid out in a scale (often in C) that sound like bells. It resembles a piano or small xylophone.\n\nI like this Glockenspiel set because you can use as bells separately and as a scale. It might be fun for your baby to take it apart and put it back together. If your child is older, there is this Glockenspiels with musical note boards, and this one.\n\n5. Uke\n\nYou can find some very cheap ukuleles out there and they sound pretty awful and fall apart in a day. I’m sure you’ve had that experience already. So it’s worth investing a bit more to get something that will last a bit longer. These Kala Waterman Ukes come in different colors and sound great. I enjoy playing my daughter’s even more than she does.\n\nSo there is your list, dear Tunie.\n\nNow, make me a promise: When you buy instruments for your baby, sit with them, play with them, make music together. Let them feel that the magic of music comes when instruments , voices, and ears interact.\n\nWhich instrument have you tried and loved or hated? COMMENT below and let me know.\n\nWho’s your most (or least) musical parent friend?

I need some quiet time in the house without running a food stand and a cleaning service.\n\nThat said, I’m bracing myself, because no matter how much I promise that this year will be different, September always arrives like a tornado swirling the pieces of me along with it. “I won’t lose my north this year! I’ll stay calm! I’ve learned from the past!” I say, and then it happens, once again.\n\nBut dear parents of babies, don’t think you’re spared just because you don’t have school aged kids. We all go back to school in September. It’s been ingrained in us since childhood, and the storm’s a-comin’ for you too.\n\nHere’s how you know: Have you been feeling itchier? Searching your home trying to remember what you were even looking for? feeling like you’re supposed to be busy doing something but don’t know what?\n\nIt’s natural. We’re like animals in the wild feeling the winds about to shift and getting antsy. But have no fear, I’m here to empathize and provide some wisdom from seasons past.\n\nHow to Weather the September Storm:\n\nThe Inevitable Mess.\n\nPrepare as you may, the storm will hit, and your plans will most likely deviate. So think of planning not so much as an effort to keep things operating perfectly as a way to make everything slightly less of a shit show. Preparing for the inevitable mess won’t make it easier but at least it will reduce the element of surprise.\n\nIdentity Crisis.\n\nMaybe I’m the only one, but I find that September tends to bubble up big questions like – who am I again? What am I doing with my life? What do I feel passionate about (besides the baby)? And then – why don’t I know the answer to these questions at this point? I should KNOW!\n\nKnowing that an annual midlife crisis is inescapable is like greeting your PMS after years of experience. You’re no less irritable, but you know that within a couple days you won’t want to kill every person in sight anymore.\n\nSuper Mama Syndrome.\n\nSeptember seems to plug in my Super Mama chord that’s been laying dormant behind the heater during the summer. Suddenly it’s activated, and I have to make changes, things need to improve – the kids can’t watch so much screens! They need more sleep! We need a new evening routine! Mornings should have a work flow! And all the discarded mantras, prayers, rose buds and thorns, are resolutely initiated once again.\n\nAfter years of this I’ve come to accept that October can be the month of all my parenting goals. In September I only go for the acheivable bare necessities.\n\nFor more on how to keep your own sanity this month check out this post.\n\nBaby Bonding Perk.\n\nHere’s a September bonus – re-bonding with the baby. Whether you have a toddler going back to school, or a partner whose work is picking up again, you’ll relish in the quiet mornings with your sweet baby who may have gotten ignored under the beach umbrella as you chased your toddler down the beach or allowed yourself a moment of actual relaxation.\n\nNow you get to stare at your baby once again, study how their lips move and their nose scrunches, guilt free, without anyone else vying for your attention.\n\nWant a baby bonding cheerleader? I’m your girl. Follow me on TikTok and Instagram for daily activity tips and emotional support.\n\nIsolation Desperation.\n\nAlong with the sweetness of peace and quiet also comes loneliness. Yes, you’ve got time with your baby, but now you hark back to those chaotic family filled evenings when you craved alone time. Your afternoons get a little longer, the witching hour starts earlier and earlier.\n\nI’ve got a simple cure for this one – I invite you to join our Baby in Tune classes. Beyond learning great tips on how to have easier nights and joyful days with your baby, its a place to make your best mama friend. We’ve got in person classes in NY and a Zoom class starting in October that I’ll be teaching. Click here to find our schedule.\n\nSo dear Tunie, do you feel the September Storm coming on? HOw do you handle it? Comment and let me know below.\n\nDo you have a friend who could use some September Support? Send her this post and tell her to sign up for more.\n\nMy baby is growing too fast!\n\nDear Tunester, you’re doing it. Your connection with your baby is growing daily. You feel it deeply as you lay together on the floor, sunlight dancing on the rug, making faces to each other and giggling and cooing. You inhale the moment. It’s beautiful and magical.\n\nBut the moment is suddenly broken. Into your mind enters an unwanted guest: Lady Bittersweet.\n\nNothing jolts you out of the present like Lady Bittersweet. “This moment is so fleeting, enjoy it as much as you possibly can.” she whispers. “Don’t they look bigger already? They’re going to outgrow that onesie soon, you know”. She knows exactly what weepy buttons to push.\n\nAnd suddenly you’ve gone from enjoying a sweet moment of connection with your baby to feeling guilty for reading an article during your morning coffee. What a waste! You should have been staring into their eyes, smelling their breath, and memorizing every new strand on their head!\n\nWhy is it that sometimes, the deeper we are in the moment, the harder Lady Bittersweet can hit? And next thing you know you’re feeling a longing for what you’re currently enjoying?\n\nToday’s thoughts are about how you can acknowledge her, give her a gentle nod, and go back to enjoying your baby . Or in other words, how can you avoid spiraling into parent guilt and mentally leaving your baby to lash out at yourself?\n\nI have a few ideas that have helped me in those moments. Hopefully they can help you as well.\n\nHow to usher Lady Bittersweet out the door\n\n1. Yes, AND\n\nWe tend to make order of the chaos by dividing and contrasting. It’s this or that… maybe this, but probably that…definitely this, not that. But rarely do we allow ourselves to say yes, this…and that. “Yes, my baby won’t be a baby forever, and I can still enjoy this beautiful moment while allowing myself my own peace”. If we try to push aside or stifle Lady Bittersweet, she’ll just come back stronger. But we can hear what she has to say, appreciate it, and go back to enjoying the moment that’s here.\n\n2. Balance!\n\nDo you have a favorite food? I could eat smoothies, popcorn, and an excellente guacamole all day every day. But that would be a terrible idea! Not only would I be ignoring other things that my body needs, my enjoyment of those foods would soon wane.\n\nIf you force yourself to spend every moment of every day in hyperfocus on and appreciation of your baby – it will become a chore (as many baby caring moments are), instead of a priviledge. Enjoy your morning coffee and article, or whatever your practice is, knowing that it will allow you to approach your connection to your baby refreshed and in earnest.\n\n3. Make your own peace with time\n\nYour baby grows from nothing to a full person in the first year and witnessing that can feel like a clock constantly held up in front of your face saying- Time is going by so fast!\n\nAnd you now what that reminds you? That YOU’RE getting old!\n\nOne of the ways you can combat Lady Bittersweet about your baby is to acknowledge and quiet that voice about yourself. What would that look like for you? It means something different for everyone. For me it means doing Invisalign this year. It’s my way of saying to myself – You’re young! You have many years of smiling ahead.\n\nWhat action can you take that will be your way of saying – time can pass but I’ll be young forever.\n\n4. Open your senses to your baby\n\nTo retether yourself to the moment with your baby, focus on how your baby feels, sounds, smells, tastes. Touch them, listen closely, Imitate what they are doing, the expressions and sounds they’re making. Don’t think about reaching a developmental milestones, don’t worry if you’re doing things right, the smaller and seemingly insignificant sesation you focus on, the better. For more on how to do this, check out this post.\n\nLastly, give yourself grace. We all have these moments, it is a universal experience – be gentle with yourself. Even when it doesn’t feel like it, you are moving mountains.\n\nHow do YOU overcome your longing for the very moment you’re in?

Instagram is also a good way to find more tips to help you through your day with your baby.\n\nWhen to respond to your baby’s cries\n\nThe perfect mother responds to her baby every time they cry.\n\nWRONG!\n\nBy now you know that that’s impossible. Not only that, it’s not even what’s best for your baby.\n\nThe question is – how can you know when to respond and when to let your baby work it out on their own?\n\nIt comes down to these three steps:\n\nPause\n\nObserve\n\nRespond\n\nLet’s break it down.\n\nFirst, the obvious. Why is it important to respond?\n\nAttachment theory teaches us that in order to develop a secure bond with your baby you need to be (somewhat) consistently responsive to their needs. When your baby is distressed and you help them regulate they learn two crucial lessons:\n\nThey can count on you to be there when they need you.\n\nHow to co-regulate so that they can eventually regulate themselves (to learn more about co-regulation check out this post.)\n\nThese lessons allow your baby to develop independence and create close relationships with others.\n\nBut responding doesn’t always mean ACTING. It may mean giving your baby an understanding glance. Knowing HOW to respond is the tricky part.\n\nWhy is it important to observe?\n\nWhen your baby is a newborn, responding to them mostly means feeding, soothing, and providing close physical contact. But as they grown their reasons for being fussy and distressed become more complicated.\n\nBy three or four months your baby is not just complaining about phyiscal needs but about emotional ones too. Suddenly they’re frustrated that they can’t reach a toy, or upset that you’re leaving, or angry when something is taken away. And as they grown their needs become more and more complicated.\n\nThe only way you can learn more about what your baby needs and their subtle cues is by OBSERVING.\n\nThat’s where the pause comes in.\n\nWhen we hear our baby cry to want to act fast. We want to quickly satisfy their needs so that they stop fussing. But that isn’t always the best thing for your baby. As your baby grows and their ego develops they also need to start to learn how and when to soothe themselves or solve a problem on their own.\n\nIn order to figure out how to respond, you need to PAUSE and OBSERVE your baby.\n\nHere are some examples of times during your day when it would be beneficial to you both to Pause and Observe before immediately responding with action:\n\nThe First Whine\n\nThey’re playing with something and start to whine. You see that the toy they want is out of reach. Pause, Observe. Was the complaint momentary? Are they simply uncomfortable and need to roll over? Did they fivure out how to reach the toy on their own? Are they over it and on to something else?\n\n2. The Helpless Glance\n\nYour baby is trying to do something like put a toy into a hole, stack blocks, or open the door on their own. They keep trying and failing and now they’re getting a little frustrated. They look up to you. Pause, observe. The glance might mean – help me! But it can also mean – look at this annoying thing! See what happens if you assume it’s the second and only act when they need you to.\n\n3. The Questionable Fall\n\nIf your baby is on the move they probably fall 27 times a day. Most of the time the falls aren’t serious and are usually followed by your baby looking up at you. In that glance they’re asking – is this something to cry over? Or – was this surprising and a bit painful but I can keep going? Pause, Observe, see what they need. Do they come to you? Do they just need an empathizing glance? Or do they need you to come to them?\n\nWith all of these situations, if you see your baby becoming more distressed you RESPOND. But when you hit these flagpoints you can pause a second and learn more about what your baby needs in that moment.\n\nThe more you do this, the more you’ll learn the body language, facial expreessions and tone they use when they absolutely need you to resond with action.\n\nImportant – if we don’t pause and observe we run the risk of teaching our baby that they are not capable of soothing themselves or figuring out things on their own. They’re looking for your cues. And every now and then, your desire to respond might be born out of your own need more than your baby’s.\n\nDo you have a friend who’s wondering when to respond to her baby’s crying and when to step back and let her baby figure it out?

Follow me on Instagram and Tik Tok.\n\nHelp your baby develop emotional intelligence\n\nDear Tunester, develop emotional intelligence by being your baby’s first “therapist”.\n\nHave you ever been to therapy? If you have then you know that one of the things they try to do is to help you make sense of how you behave and why you do what you do. Often we’re playing out patterns of behavior that we developed in our past, and undersanding how they serve us, or once served us in some way, can help us move beyond them and develop new ways of being.\n\nGuess what. YOU can do the same for your baby. The more you help your child make sense of their reactions and big emotions the more emotionally intelligent they’ll be.\n\nEmotional Intelligence is what will help them know how to act in a new group, how to make a new friend, how to have strong relationships, and how to be aware of and control their own emotions.\n\nSo how can you give a mini therapy session to your baby that will help calm them in the moment and will develop their EI?\n\nBy doing what I call CONNECTING THE DOTS.\n\nConnecting the dots helps your child understand what led to their tantrum or melt dow and gives them insight into their own emotional process.\n\nHow to help your baby Connect the Dots:\n\nWhen babies (and kids, and adults,) have meltdowns it’s usually not just about the last thing that happened to them. There is often a sequence of events that led to the final straw. Connecting the dots is pointing out to your baby the hitches that happened along the way that might have upset them so that they understand what led to the final breakdown.\n\nFor younger babies you’ll connect the dots of one or two events. For bigger babies who’s memory is more developed and who have more complex emotions you’ll connect more dots.\n\nHere are two examples from my home when my kids were babies:\n\nExample 1:\n\nMy daughter was about 9 months when she hit her head on the faucet in the bath one day. She immediately started to scream and held her hands up to be taken out.\n\nShe had only just gotten into the bath so I wasn’t keen on pulling her out right away. So after consoling her I wanted to see if she could push through if I helped her connect the dots.\n\nI said – “You were playing and then you slipped and hit your head on this faucet.” I mimed what I was saying, pointing to the faucet and giving myself a little hit on the head. Then I pretended to cry and said “that really hurt you.”\n\nYou know how sometimes you can almost see your baby’s brain working? It was one of those moments. She stopped, looked back at the faucet, and touched her head.\n\nThen, since she didn’t have words yet, she told the story in her own way. She pointed to the faucet,brought her head closed to it, and gave her head a bonk.\n\nI said – “that’s right. You hit your head and it hurt.” Then she mimed it a few more times.\n\nAnd then miraculously, she went back to playing in the bath. Once she had made sense of her experience, and had processed it in her own way, she was ready to move on.\n\nAs our babies grow they’ll have more complicated emotions often caused by multiple events. They’ll need more help connecting the dots.\n\nExample 2:\n\nWhen my son was a toddler he hit his sister one night. In my anger I instinctually asked him – “Why did you do that?” “You!” he said. “What do you mean?” I said. He sat still and finally said: “you got dressed!”\n\nI stopped and took a moment to follow the sequence of events as he had experienced them and it dawned on me. Once I had connected the dots for myself I did it for him (slowly and with emphasis):\n\n“You were angry when I told you we were going out tonight. You and I played ball but then you got upset because I stopped the game and went to get dressed. You were angry at me for leaving you tonight and for leaving the game. And then you hurt your sister who is smaller and can’t hurt you back. But really you were angry at me.”\n\nWhen I finished he took a big breath. I always know I’ve reached them when they sigh big.\n\nThe more we can help our kids connect the dots now the more they’ll be able to do it for themselves as they mature. And that will help them develop self awareness about their own patterns and processes.\n\nDoes that mean they won’t be on that therapy couch down the road? Probably not. But they’ll have a good head start to understanding how their dots connect.\n\nFor more on how to respond to the three different types of tantrums, check out this post.\n\nDo you help your baby connect the dots to develop their emotional intelligence? How does it look?\n\nDo you have a friend who needs some encouragement in helping her baby develop EI?

Sure, you’ve got a baby or two, but if there’s one thing we’ve learned its that you never know when that boarding ramp is going to retract and the flight attendant is going to give you a slow shake of the head to all your beach fantasies.\n\nLast week, I gave you a Road Trip Survival Kit complete with a road trip playlist to reduce tears and increase sunny memories in the car.\n\nToday, let’s talk flights.\n\nAre you braving a journey on a jet plane with your diapered companion anytime soon?\n\nThis one is for you.\n\nKeep reading for my tips and watch this video of my kids and I on a flight.\n\nWhy am I an authority on flights with babies? Because almost every year since my kids were born we’ve taken a looooooong 12 hour flight to Israel to see the grandparents. I’ve flown with them at every age and sometimes on my own.\n\nAlright, let’s get to it.\n\nHow to Survive a Flight with Baby\n\nExpectation setting:\n\nAccept that its going to suck a little. The worst times we have as parents is when we expect our kids to behave a certain way and they don’t. For the flight, expect that you won’t sleep, the kids will whine and you’ll get to the other side.\n\nLoosen the rules. Allow stuff you wouldn’t otherwise. For me, that means unlimited screens, more junk food and less sleep.\n\nYou’re going to be moving more than you’d like. With little babies, you’ll be bouncing them to sleep in the carrier. WIth new walkers, you’ll be walking up and down the aisles feeling terrified with every turbulent bump that your baby will crash into an arm rest. It goes with the territory.\n\nSurrender to jetlag. No matter how much you try to time the naps just right, it won’t really matter. Jetlag is hard. But it only lasts 5 days or so. Knowing this helps you to not stress about whether they sleep or not on the flight.\n\nTiming:\n\nThe hardest ages for travel are 9-18 months. Your baby is so excited to be mobile and just wants to move. But I couldn’t avoid travel during these ages either.\n\nAim for a flight time about 2hrs before you want them to sleep. There is a lot of activity in the first two hours (takeoff, drinks, food, etc) and you don’t want to miss your bedtime window. Our preferred time was a 5:00-7:00pm flight.\n\nClothing:\n\nWear slip-on shoes. When the baby is in the carrier you’ll thank yourself for not needing to bend over to go through security and go for a bathroom trip.\n\nWear pants with big pockets. This is a life saver. Try not to wear yoga pants or tight pants that won’t store key items like a boarding pass, pacifier, tissues and EVERYTHING else.\n\nWear socks. It gets cold on flights and you won’t be able to fix yourself that perfect blanket/pillow cocoon that you once could before baby.\n\nPacking:\n\nPack backups. Pacis, bottles, change of clothes on top of the extra change of clothes, an extra blanket. Whatever you can reasonably carry.\n\nPrep relieve ear compression:\n\nFor younger babies – Feed during take off and landing to make sure your baby is swallowing often which will relieve ear compression.\n\nFor older babies – Bring lollipops for take off and landing. My kids still ask for them even now that they are older. Sort of a mini-party during the worst parts of a flight.\n\nHave wipes handy. They will be your best friend on a flight.\n\nTake empty plastic bags. For dirty diapers, garbage, etc.\n\nSnacks and more snacks. For long flights, bring lots of options – Sandwiches, goldfish, bars, apples. Don’t forget to bring snacks for yourself. Critical!\n\nBring the changing pad. It is almost impossible to do it in the tiny bathroom cabins. I’ve done it but it’s no picnic. If you can, best to do it on your lap in your seat. Have a lightweight changing pad ready to go.\n\nPlaying (for toddlers):\n\nStickers. These are the best because they are a clean activity and don’t have things that roll away and get lost.\n\nPainters tape. My favorite trick was always to bring painters tape and put little pieces all over the seat. My babies would spend hours taking it on and off.\n\nMarkers or pencils. If you do bring these, have them in a zippered case and be prepared to lose half.\n\nWater-marker books. These are great.\n\nBooks. Lots of them. Soft cover are ideal so you can fit more in the bag and they’ll be lighter.\n\nSeating:\n\nBassinet. For international flights its very nice to have the bassinets for babies under 6 months. Book your ticket way in advance for that because they tend to fill up.\n\nAnywhere but the back. Book a seat not too close to the bathroom because of noise/odor/light. Once your baby is finally asleep you don’t want the bathroom door to wake them.\n\nAisle vs window. If you are enough people to take the full row by the window, put baby toward the inside and you sit on the aisle. If you are traveling solo with the baby, go with the aisle so you can get up easily to soothe, etc.\n\nAre you nervous? Don’t be. You can do this. Most of the time you will be pleasantly surprised that it was easier than you thought it would be.\n\nIt is a short run and then you’re done.\n\nYOU CAN DO THIS!!\n\nI know because I did it. Seriously watch the video of me doing it alone with my three kids. Smooth travels!\n\nWhat has been your saving grace on a flight with a child? Comment below to add to this list.\n\nKnow someone flying to visit friends, family or just for vacation? Send them this post if they love lists as much as I do.\n\nFamily RoadTrip Survival Kit\n\nDearest Tunesters,\n\nYou know what I miss? Being on the road.\n\nAs hard as it was to be on a year long road trip, as many times as I had to say “stop touching her!”, as angry as I was when my husband had to stop to see “one more thing,” as heartbreaking as it was when our ski clothes had flown out of the trunk on top of the car, and and as exhausting as it was to pack and repack that van, I would do it again tomorrow.\n\nWhen I look back on our Big Adventure, I think about my happiest moments, sitting with my legs up on the dashboard, the sun warming me through the window, and singing along to music. I loved the feeling of leaving one town behind us and heading to an unknown place ahead. That in-between was my favorite.\n\nDear Tunie, you might not be driving across the country but you’re probably going to take a few good drives this summer. So today I’d like to help you have your own feet on the dash moments.\n\nMy family is quite experienced at this point. So here is our Road Trip Survival Kit. It comes complete with a Roadtrip Playlist to make your drives even sunnier.\n\nRoad Trip Survival Kit\n\nFOOD\n\nAs you know, if your child is cranky they’re probably either tired or hungry. Our worst moments in the car came when we were out of snacks and the next town miles away (can someone build a restaurant between Colorado and Santa Fe?). If you can win the snack prep, you’ve won the road trip.\n\nHere are some tips:\n\nMilk – If your baby is nursing you’ll have no choice but to stop along the way. I’ve done the ‘lean over the car seat breastfeed trick’ but if you can avoid it that’s best. Bottles are SO much easier on a road trip.\n\nHealthy Snacks – car rides are actually not a bad place to try to get your kid to eat fruits and veggies. They’re captive and they want something to munch on. Before we pushed off each day on our road trip I peeled about 20 carrots and 20 cucumbers. They all got eaten during the day. Apples and grapes are also great. Juicy fruits like peaches and watermelon should be avoided.\n\nSnacky snacks – We usually had a big bag filled to the top with snacks. Our go-tos were – seaweed, Bamba, pretzels, popcorn, goldfish, crackers, Clif Bars.\n\nWater – We went through so much water on drives especially because they ate all of those salty snacks. Bring lots of reusable bottles (that won’t overheat in the sun.)\n\nSmoothies – we had a tradition of getting a smoothie from whatever town we were leaving and taking them on the road. It was a good way to start the drive with a full stomach and get some nutrients before sitting all day.\n\nMUSIC\n\nMusic makes everything ok. It’s what makes a simple drive on a crowded highway feel like a poignant moment to be remembered forever.\n\nThere were times in the car that were so turbulent I thought we’d never make it to the other side. Everyone was annoyed, yelling, hitting, and sulking including my husband and I. Music brought us to calm like a bridge over troubled water.\n\nWhen the kids were exhausted and needed to sleep I put on Classical, especially piano. Two good options for that are Chopin or Bach’s Goldberg Variations. It had the effect of calming them without drawing too much attention to lyrics or dynamics.\n\nMusic marked our journey like flags on a map. In each place we’d play the music of that location – In Los Angeles- Frank Sinantra, the Eagles, and Hip Hop, in Seattle – Grunge, in St. Louis – Miles Davis, etc.\n\nWe had a tradition of starting our drives with Willie Nelson’s “On the Road Again.” Now when we hear it we’re all instantly brought back to our drives together last year.\n\nIn order to make your music listening simple and accessible, here’s a curated playlist for your drive with Kindie artists and all around good music.\n\nClick Here for Your Roadtrip Playlist.\n\nBOOKS ON TAPE\n\nThis got us through MANY hours. To be precise, 31.5 hours of Laura Ingalls describing her family’s journey west meticulously. We often felt like we were passing the exact spot where their potato crops were demolished by grasshoppers, or where they lived in a dugout while Pa worked on the railroad.\n\nIt’s a good reminder that what takes us 4 hours to drive, on cushy seats, with snacks galore, and heat and AC in the car, took them 4 months sitting on a wagon freezing and wrapped in blankets.\n\nThe readers of books on tape are often the writers themselves or actors and actresses. It’s so very enjoyable. If you’ve got older kids who can focus for a long book hours can go by without anyone noticing.\n\nPODCASTS. By miracle, we found some podcasts that all of my kids agree on despite their wide range of ages. There are such great ones out there! Our favorites are Wow in the World, Smash Boom Best, Radiolab for kids, and their absolute favorite – Greeking Out.\n\nGAMES\n\nWe played many. Here are our faves:\n\nDJ. Each person chooses a song and we go around. We’re all grateful my daughter grew out of her Sofia the First phase.\n\n20 questions. Which in our family really means 43 questions at least. So many hours of playing actually taught my daughter to ask general questions and narrow them down.\n\nAssociation. This is a simple game we came up with on one of our drives. One person says – I’m thinking of ____ and the next person goes purely off association and says – and I’m thinking about ____. The mind trick here is to accept that we all have different associations and you have to let go of your own direction.\n\nI Spy. Nuff said.\n\nCloud Shapes. This is just finding shapes in clouds and pointing them out to each other.\n\nOpposites. You say tall, they say short. You say hot, they say cold.\n\nAlphabet Game with categories. Let’s say it’s fruit – A, apples. B, Bananas, etc.\n\nMAPS, ROAD ACTIVITY BOOKS\n\nEvery now and then the kids liked to pull out the maps and see where we were and where we’re going. We keep them in the seat pockets in front of them. The Doodle Pad is good, Water painting books. My daughter also has activity road trip books that she liked.\n\nFinal tip – Remember that the drive is as important as the location. Last year when my kids would say – are we there yet? I’d always say – YES.\n\nfind times to stretch back and hold your kids’ hand. Take a moment to stare at them while they peacefuly sleep in their seat. Part of why I loved being in the car on our way to someplace new is because we were all together. I knew where everyone was and that made me feel safe, happy and content\n\nHow to develop fine and gross motor movement\n\nDear Tunesters,\n\nToday let’s talk about the best ways to get your baby moving and to develop their fine and gross motor movement.\n\nMy second kid was a physical child from day 1. From the minute he could roll over, he was on a mission to MOVE. My first wasn’t that way at all. He was quite content to sit in one spot and pull the Playmobil captain in and out of the boat. While my second was focused on developing his gross motor movement, my first was all about his fine motor movement.\n\nBut guess what – they need both! And you know what the best way to get your baby moving both with their fingers and their body is? Can you guess what my answer will be?\n\nYup – through songs.\n\nIt’s a no brainer really. Think about yourself when you’re doing exercise or when you’re dancing. You’re probably a million times more motivated to move when Stevie Wonder is playing his harmonica.\n\nThis morning I was so UNmotivated to do my workout until I heard my latest favorite song. And then I was rearing to go.\n\nBefore we go into WHICH movement songs to do with your baby, let’s talk WHY.\n\nBenefits of movement songs with your baby:\n\nFine AND gross motor skills.\n\nYou might just be favoring one depending on the gender of your baby. This study found that parents of male babies often encourage play that promotes more gross motor movement like walking, running and jumping and parents of female babies encourage fine motor movements like grasping and reaching. We want to do both!\n\nIncrease cooperation.\n\nMoving together, to the rhythm of the song, teaches your baby that there is a sequence and that you both do it together. Meaning, your baby learns that there are social rules to the game. And that’s an important lesson!\n\nHand eye coordination.\n\nEvery time you do the Itsy Bitsy Spider or Flying Hands with your baby they’re learning how to control their movements\n\nListening skills.\n\nYou might not have considered this benefit but when you do movement and gesture songs with your baby you’re teaching them to listen closely and follow instructions. I know you want your baby to learn that 🙂\n\nOk so now let’s get some ideas for which songs to do and how:\n\nMovement activities to do with your baby TODAY:\n\nGo on a Bikeride!\n\nThis song and others like it such as Head Shoulders Knees and Toes or Rocking in the Boat encourage moving and stretching your baby which develop awareness of their body and increases their flexibility.\n\nFocus on Tummy Time!\n\nTummy time has been shown to be so important for your baby’s gross motor movement and acquisition of sitting, standing and walking. To encourage your baby to stay longer in tummy time by making the floor more interesting, Try this song.\n\nTake an Airplane ride!\n\nIf you’ve learned one thing from my posts it’s how much our babies mirror us. When your baby sees you being active physically, they will be too! Engage in songs in which you both move together, like Open Shut Them It or this Airplane song.\n\nJump around!\n\nTo encourage gross motor movement sing songs that involve big motions like jumping, running, and clapping. Another example is If You’re Happy and You Know it.\n\nExcercise those fingers!\n\nDo songs that involve finger and hand control such as Flying Hands, Itsy Bitsy Spider and New Words.\n\nOther ideas to encourage movement that don’t involve songs:\n\nCreate an Indoor Obstacle Course.\n\nPut down an enticing spread of pillows and blankets for your baby to crawl in and out of. When they get older you can do obstacle courses in the field by saying something like – run to that pole, spin around it, then jump over that stick, clap three times…\n\nOutside Play.\n\nGoing outside has been shown to increase your baby’s movements because they have more space. So get out there! To the park, to the playground, or just outside the door.\n\nWhat movement songs do you do with your baby?

Tantrums can be relentless, and I might be a therapist and all but my fuse can be short as anyone’s when it comes to a screaming toddler who won’t put on a coat in the dead of winter when we need to leave the house NOW.\n\nI hope that when the tantrum tornado hits, keeping these three types in mind will help you figure out your game plan. Often the most torturous part of our baby’s tantrum is our own conflict about how to react.\n\nHere are the three types of tantrums your toddler might be having, and how to handle each kind:\n\n3 Types of Toddler Tantrums:\n\nCan’t Express Needs\n\nThis happens when your toddler has a basic need – to eat, sleep, drink, change diaper, but doesn’t know how to express it. Not only that, they’re at the point where the need has overwhelmed them – they’re overtired, starving, or uncomfortable.\n\nHow to handle it:\n\nEmpathize with what’s going on. “I see that you’re tired and hungry. Your stomach must be growling!”\n\nTry to give them what they need.\n\nIn an ideal world we’d preempt these situations and not get to the point where our babies are tired and hungry. But after 13 years of parenting I can say I miss the mark at least once a day. Don’t beat yourself up. There are also plenty of times when you’re on it, you’ve packed the perfect snacks and your baby napped exactly when planned. But we don’t hear about it when that happens.\n\nThe takeaway here is that when your baby is tantruming because of basic needs, try to satisfy their needs asap.\n\n2. Power Play\n\nPower play tantrums happen when your toddler pushes against a limit you’ve set. It might be a safety limit, like touching an outlet, holding scissors, or getting into the carseat, or it might be a boundary you need to keep for other reasons, like not going outside before dinner, or not having another cookie. Either way, its a rule you’ve instated and think is important.\n\nHow to handle it:\n\nEmpathize with their anger – “I know you don’t want to be in the car seat right now and that you’d rather play.”\n\nAnd then HOLD YOUR GROUND – “…but it’s my job to keep you safe and that means sitting in a carseat.” Sticking to your limit is not only important for your baby’s safety but it also gives your baby the feeling of security they need. They want to know that your limits are dependable and that they don’t have too much power over you.\n\nThat said, every now and then we’re in a situation when we realize we might have made a mistake with a particular limit. That’s ok! Let yourself be flexible and pivot if need be, just not most of the time 🙂\n\nThe takeaway here is that once you’ve set a limit, try to stick with it. You’ll thank me years from now.\n\n3. Impossible Demands\n\nThis one is unique to toddler land – It’s when you give your toddler their sippy cup but they wanted the other cup, and you give them the other cup but they wanted the bottle! With the Impossible Demands tantrum you can’t win. There is no rational way out of these tantrums. Your baby simply needs to emote. They are overwhelmed and most likely can’t be pleased by an action you take.\n\nHow to handle it:\n\nMake sure your baby is safe.\n\nShow them that you are there for them if they need you.\n\nAllow them the space they need to express their range of emotions unless it is harming them or someone else in which case you intervene and set a limit.\n\nBe sure to take care of your own needs. These tantrums can be very stressful for parents. Know that the storm will pass.\n\nThe takeaway here is to truly let your baby have their tantrum and express their emotions. Being a baby is hard. Being human is hard. Hell, I want to have a tantrum all the time. Give them space to do so.\n\nDear Tunester, I personally found that keeping these three types in mind helped me figure out what to do when my own babies were in the eye of the storm. I hope it helps you too.\n\nOne of my favorite podcasts for dealing with this stage is Unruffled by Janet Lansbury. If you haven’t already, I highly recommend emulating her approach and calming style when it comes to dealing with toddlers.\n\nFor more info on how to deal with tantrums, especially type #1, check out this post.\n\nOk dear Tunie that’s it for today.

Apparently we’re doing the ‘rona in stages. During that week I missed him terribly.\n\nWhen he travels for work, I rally. I turn into power mom and get it all done. The kids are in bed with time to spare and dinner even gets stepped up a notch. But because that week he was home, only quarantined, I still felt a lingering expectation that he would do the dishes after the kids went down like he normally does.\n\nWeeks like those make me realize how much of an equal partner he is in all of this kid rearing business.\n\nFathers are different these days than they were during our parents’ generation. They’re not the only ones bringing home the bacon and we’re not the only ones changing diapers. Beyond the daily tasks that they take on, they’re also more open to learning from and delighting in their children.\n\nIn many ways, fathers are simply parents. We expect them to love our children unconditionally, support them and guide them, and help with all of the endless to-do list involved in raising kids, just as moms do.\n\nOn the other hand, they’re men. And history is changing before our eyes. Our generation is shifting how fathers behave with their kids. Corporations now give fathers paternity leave because they share the burden of diaper changing and 2am feedings, and because they deserve a chance to bond with the baby just as much as the mama does.\n\nAnd yet there’s still a ways to go.\n\nToday’s post is a love letter to the modern father who is finding their way to be simply parents, not necessarily fathers.\n\nOne day maybe we won’t even have holidays specifically celebrating Mothers or Fathers rather days celebrating all Parents, regardless of their titles and pronouns.\n\nBut for now, as we live through the transition, let’s honor the dads who are changing the construct of parenthood by being present, open to learning from their kids how to be a better parent, and are willing to take on half of the load.\n\nHere’s a poem I wrote to the dads we love. I’ll be posting a video version today on Instagram too.\n\nLove Letter to the Modern Father\n\nYou sit at the basketball game dying to coach but are careful not to squash,\n\nYou doze with the baby on the couch but wake up for a 3am feed\n\nYou play games while dinner is being made and automatically do the dishes after,\n\nYou encourage them to try again but give a long hug when they just can’t,\n\nYou’re stern when needed but soften to console\n\nYou laugh when your child surprises you and when they’re angry you teach them how to talk it through.\n\nYou’re not afraid to show vulnerability but are unshakable in your desire to protect.\n\nYou encourage your child to ask and admit when you don’t know.\n\nYou’re a jungle gym to jump on and a cocoon to hide in.\n\nYou’re stern when boundaries need to be kept but flexible when rules need to be broken.\n\nYou let your child find their way but gently guide when needed.\n\nYou encourage your child to jump and hold your arms out if they need you to catch,\n\nYou strive to be a good dad and know that it often means being a good partner\n\nYou vow to be different from your father but also choose when to be the same,\n\nWe see you.\n\nWe know you’re changing history.\n\nNeed tips on how to rekindle the romance with your partner/modern father?

Bouncing? Shushing? Driving? Singing? Feeding? Most likely you have a few methods that work fairly well for your baby, but nothing that works all the time. That’s ok, there’s no such thing! But there are definitely things you can do to make your soothing go more smoothly.\n\nThe fact is that the soothing method you establish with your baby now will be the same method you use for years to come. In a couple of years you might not be able to fit them in the crook of your arm, but they’ll still need plenty of soothing.\n\nSo let’s talk about the three reasons your soothing method might not be working as well as you’d like.\n\n3 Reasons Your Soothing Method Isn’t Working\n\n1. It isn’t soothing you at the same time.\n\nHere’s the hard truth – if we aren’t feeling calm our babies won’t calm down either. Your baby is constantly looking to you to understand how to feel. If fact, they’re super power is picking up on your emotional state like a sensitive antenna.\n\nYou know what that means. It means we have no choice but to relax ourselves first, like putting on that oxygen mask in the airplane before we put it on our babies.\n\nSo now let’s think about your soothing method. Ask yourself: is it soothing me at the same time?\n\nThe best soothing method will be the one that makes you feel calmer, makes your shoulders fall, makes your eyes settle on one spot instead of darting around, makes your belly relax and your breath easier.\n\nIf your soothing method isn’t making you feel that way you might want to try the Baby in Tune method (click on the link to get a video explaining how to do it.) There is no one method that will work all the time. But the benefits of using our method is the use of VOICE. When you incorporate your voice into your method you are sending a message to your nervous system to regulate. The mantra like melody in the soothing method is ilke an inner massage to your organs, and forces you to take regular deep inhales.\n\nOther ways to soothe you both at the same time are singing a lullaby or putting on a song you love and dancing around with your baby.\n\n2. Your aren’t being consistent with it\n\nBabies are creatures of habit. We all are! Have you noticed that after only a couple days of doing something – waking at a certain hour, drinking from the bottle, or playing a certain game, your baby starts to expect it to happen again. It’s quite amazing how quickly our babies fall into patterns.\n\nThis is good news and bad news. It’s bad news because it means that your baby can easily develop bad habits that then will need ot be broken. But the good news is that it takes a short time to pivot and create better habits as well. Often it just takes our determination.\n\nWhen it comes to soothing, your baby needs to associate your method with regulating. The more consistent you are with the way you soothe, the more your method will become a behavioral cue.\n\nFor instance, if you use the vocal soothing method consistently, every day, every time you soothe, within a few weeks your baby will be accustomed to it. They’ll know that when you start to sing “Ohohoh” and you bounce to the rhythm, that it’s time for you both to co-regulate.\n\nThe trick is to be as consistent as you can. That goes for almost everything we do with our babies and kids.\n\n3. You aren’t using your voice effectively\n\nIn #`1 we talked about how we need to be somewhat relaxed in order for our baby to calm as well. But the fact is that when you’re baby is screaming on your shoulder adn you’re running around trying to figure out what’s wrong, you’re not feeling very relaxed. So what do you need to do?\n\nFake it till you make it, parents.\n\nTake deep breaths, relax your belly, try to drop your shoulders. And there is another way taht you might not always consider – focus on relaxing your VOICE.\n\nOur voice can convey tension when we don’t even realize it. When we are stressed our voice tends to crack more, make us feel out of breath when we speak, and it is usually higher in tone.\n\nIn order ot fake it til you make it and convey calm to your baby, you can alter your voice by doing these things:\n\nTake in deep breaths between phrases.\n\nLower your tone. Imagine you’re a celebrity who has a low voice who you find soothing. Emulate their voice.\n\nSpeak or sing SLOWER.\n\nIs your baby soothed and now you need sleep hep? Check out this post to get some practical tips that work.\n\nOk Dear Tunie, that’s it for today. I hope these tips will bring a little more calm to your day today.\n\nDo you have a friend who needs some soothing help asap?

A pandemic, a shooting, a formula shortage, a war, all on top of what is already an extremely challenging time. It’s always hard to parent babies. But these days it feels like the walls are caving in.\n\nAfter I had my daughter I had a phase when I would see something in the corner of my eye, like a piece of fuzz or a shadow, and I’d spring out of my seat feeling my heart painfully quicken. I was so on edge.\n\nTurns out, it was normal. It was my primal brain geared up to fiercely protect my baby. It’s the same instinct the bird has as she sits on her nest watching for threats, or the octopus as she feeds her offspring with one eye out for sharks.\n\nIn our section-couched carpeted modern world there are usually no animals threatening to attack our baby and there’s less of a need for us to be on guard in that way. But with everything going on your natural protective stress hormones might be working overtime, keepng you in a hieghtened state of fight or flight. I know I feel it.\n\nSo today I want to offer you a few strategies to deal with the intensity of the moment.\n\nAcknowledge Your Mama Bear.\n\nNotice your fierce protective hormones Does your belly feel a bit tighter these days? Is your chest a bit heavier? Do you find your head or eyes darting to your sides to see what’s there? If you do, it’s normal. Just take notice.\n\nFocus on the Micro.\n\nWhen we feel overwhelmed by things beyond our reach and control, the best remedy is to focus on what IS ok, what IS going right, and what we DO have. Ask yourself – in this very moment, am I ok? Is my baby ok? Most likely the answer will is yes. Now be HERE. Use the techniques we use in class. Focus on how it feels to touch your baby, notice their smell, their sounds, and even their taste. Narrow down your vision to what is right in front of you and through that you’ll expand your vision and experience.\n\nBOND.\n\nYou know what reduces our stress level and the stress level of your baby? Connection. Find more moments to hold your baby. Let your baby hold you back. Bonding is the key to our happiness, our soothing and healing.\n\nUse a Mantra.\n\nLast month my son was having some medical issues that had me worrying all night long. The only thing that got me through it was a mantra I said over and over – He’s going to be ok, I’m going to be ok, it’s going to be ok. I even wrote this little ditty about it (I post my latest ditties to Instagram HERE.)\n\nIt’s OK, not You’re OK.\n\nHere’s one last tip to use with your babies and others around you. When people tell you what they’re going through most of the time they don’t need you to fix it rather for you to listen and acknowledge. Your kids might be feeling heightened intensity right now too. And that’s on top of all the feelings their body is learning to process just by being babies. Next time they fall, cry, tantrum, whine, try not to say “You’re Ok” because sometimes they’re not and it can feel negating. They’re hurt or sad or angry. What you can say is “It’s Ok.” Because it’s ok for them to have all the feelings they have.\n\nSo dear parents, I want to say to you – It’s ok. It’s ok to not to be ok, it’s ok to have all the feelings you might be having. It’s also ok to be ok despite everything going on in the world. You’re carrying an awful lot right now. You’re doing everything you can to be the best parent you can and it shows.\n\nAnd at the same time, notice what is OK right at this very moment. And as you do it, you might even want to sing it like I did.\n\nWhat have you been doing to get through the stress of these days?

This week, let’s spend some time talking about tuning in to them BEFORE they arrive into your arms. Specifically, let’s see how music in the womb can effect your baby once they’re born.\n\nThis is for all your friends out there who are staring at their belly wondering – will a baby actually come out of my body?? It’s for any of you who are pregnant with your first, second, third, or eighth baby.\n\nRemember how it felt when you were pregnant for the first time? You had all the time in the world to feel the changes in your body. Every new centimeter was noticed and measured, every bit of heaviness meant a slower step, hunger was tended to and nausea was acupunctured.\n\nWith any pregnancy following, there is no time for that. Discomfort must be tolerated and we plod on, dealing with our toddlers as best we can. But no matter what number you’re on, everyone can benefit from taking a pause and tuning in before the shit hits the fan (and seeps through the onesie).\n\nAnd what should you do in that pause? Two things-\n\nTune in to the changes in your body.\n\nConnect to your fetus.\n\nLet’s talk body:\n\nIt can feel very scary and exciting for your body to be changing so drastically. I remember the moment I realized I couldn’t suck in my stomach as I walked into a party trying hard to feel my best (before letting it all hang out by the end of the party.)\n\nHere’s a reminder – Take the time to run your hand compassionately over areas that are changing. Allow your body to do the work of growing a human inside you with all the beauty and discomfort that comes with it.\n\nNow let’s see how you can connect to your fetus. Why? Because the more you feel connected to your fetus now the more you will once they arrive in your arms. And it just so happens that MUSIC is a direct phone line straight to your little nugget.\n\n4 ways to use music to connect to your baby during pregnancy\n\nPlay music you love for your baby.\n\nUntil about 30 years ago, we didn’t know how much the fetus could hear. We now know that by 16 weeks, they can hear sounds outside of the womb. A 2013 article shows that babies at birth and at four months old noticed changes in the melodies that were played to them in utero.\n\nSo take the time to put something on that makes you feel GOOD. It can be that song your teenage self jammed to or your wedding song. It could just be “Groove Thang” – don’t judge it! Just play it. There is a good chance your baby will remember that music on the outside.\n\nSing! Even early on.\n\nDid you know that singing to your baby in utero can have an affect on their behavior post birth? This 2017 study published in “Women & Birth” showed that babies who were sung to in utero cried less after they were born!\n\nThat’s a pretty good reason to do it. Not only that, When you sing, your body relaxes and vibrates and it’s like an internal massage that affects everything on the inside, as well.\n\nWhere to start? Find some time during your day to take in deep breaths and use your lowest voice.\n\nPut your hand on your chest and see if you can make it vibrate even more. Let all of your breath come out as you sing so that you take in deep breaths in between phrases. This is called vocal toning. You are using your voice to align with your vocal vibration.\n\nStart to search for your lullaby.\n\nOnce the baby is here, you are going to want to have a lullaby prepared. Your lullaby will be KEY to helping your baby fall asleep and helping you create a dependable sleep routine. I didn’t have one ready to go and I wish I did. It is so nice to start singing your lullaby from day 1.\n\nAnd if you start to sing your lullaby while you are pregnant, your baby will become familiar with it and it will work even better.\n\nTune in to the sounds within your body.\n\nThis means sitting still and quiet and tuning in to your heartbeat. This 2015 study showed that pre-term babies who listened to recordings of their mothers heartbeat and recordings of their mother singing had improved neural processes. So tune in with your baby!\n\nConnecting with your fetus now means taking your first step toward bonding once they’re here. And as you know, that is crucial for your baby’s well being and your own.\n\nI know, it’s almost impossible while you hae a toddler or more to run after at the same time. But if you can, take a few moments a day especially in the last month of pregnancy to connect. Your body will probably start telling you to turn inward, to start slowing down, go out less, do less things, and LISTEN, and SING.\n\nDid you pick out your lullaby while pregnant (unlike me)? How did you find it? Comment below.\n\nHave a pregnant friend? Forward them these 4 ways to connect and eliminate one of many Google searches.\n\nThe baby is already here and you need sleep help ASAP? Check out this post for some tried and true strategies that I’ve collected over my many years of work with parents and babies.\n\nMy daughter wasn’t musical…here’s what happened\n\nDear Tunester,\n\nToday we’re going to talk about whether your child can develop musical talent or if it’s hopless if they weren’t born with it.\n\nMy son came out of my belly singing. He could follow a tune by the time he was a year old. My second was the same and seemed to have a knack for rhythm. My daughter, however, was NOT.\n\nWhat?! We thought. How could it be that our child isn’t musical?! How will we harmonize on road trips?\n\nBut it was undeniable. When she sang it sounded sort of monotone, as if her voice was cutting corners and moving only slightly higher or lower from her speaking voice.\n\nWe wondered – could she hear the difference in notes but wasn’t putting in the effort to match them? Or maybe she couldn’t hear the contours of the melody and was singing what she heard?\n\nWas she simply not born with the music gene? We hadn’t changed our behavior from one kid to the next as far as we knew. In fact, if anything, we sang even more because of the other two.\n\nThe question this week is this: Is musical talent innate or not? And – Can musical talent be learned?\n\nMany parents who don’t feel musical wonder about this question. I remember a couple in one of my classes saying – we’re not musical and can’t sing. Is it hopeless for our baby?\n\nLet’s dive into the research and see what we can find.\n\nIs musical talent innate or can it be learned?\n\nFirst of all, we’re ALL MUSICAL, especially your baby\n\nMusic is innate for ALL humans. We all respond to rhythm, melody, and pitch and have always done so through history. Here’s how we know.\n\nResearch shows that infants are born with a wide range of musical capacities. For instance, they prefer listening to music that is harmonic rather than dissonant, they can recognize the omission of a downbeat in a simple rhythm, and they prefer bouncing to the rhythm of the song they are hearing rather than out of rhythm. They also have a memory for music that is stored long term.\n\nWhat about musical talent? Is that innate too?\n\nThe short answer is yes. But that’s not the full answer.\n\nThe growing consensus among scientists seems to be that people are born with varying degrees of musical sensitivity and proclivity.\n\nBut that’s just the beginning. It all comes down to who STICKS with it.\n\nIt’s true that those who are born with a greater aptitude toward music may have an easier time learning how to play an instrument or how to sing. That ease and comfort may encourage them to continue.\n\nBut ALL kids can get to the same point if they put the work in. We now know how plastic the brain is. This study showed that with long term and repeated rehearsal of a musical instrument we can alter the brain’s gray matter.\n\nThink of it like a marathon – imagine all kids standing at the start line. They are all about to run the same track. The kids born with musical sensitivity are given a head start. For them, playing an instrument will be easier at first. But throughout the race, some may drop out and some may persevere. And it doesn’t always have to do with musical talent. It may even be more related to GRIT (to learn more about that check out this post.)\n\nSo what is the biggest factor in my baby becoming musical?\n\nThe fact is, whether your baby learns and sticks with music largely depends on YOU.\n\nThis study of 257 children showed that the successful music learners were the ones with musically involved parents.\n\nWhy? Because musical development is a result of genes interacting with environmental stimulation.\n\nI’ve got the proof to go with all this. Let’s go back to my daughter.\n\nWe’ve been working hard with her. When I sing to her I accentuate the melody and her brothers sometimes do too. A few months ago we were singing You Are My Sunshine and she had the rhythm down but wasn’t matching the pitches of the melody.\n\nWhen she didn’t make it to a note of the song I’d repeat that note with gusto a few times patiently letting her try it. Eventually, she started catching on. And then she started singing full melodies on key!\n\nThe other day she sang Somewhere Over the Rainbow and was able to sing all the hard notes on her own.\n\nIt all came down to the fact that we kept rooting her on in the marathon, no matter where she started and how far she had to go.\n\nNow, she can run on her own and she’s in line with all the other marathon runners.\n\nSo what should you do to give your baby the nurture to compliment their nature?\n\nKeep making music – singing, drumming, playing instruments together. The more you do it the more your baby will associate music with fun and togetherness and will start to develop that head start that the musically talented had.\n\nListen to music – lots of it. In the car, at home, sing with it, dance to it. Let music be a part of your baby’s every fiber. And if you’re looking for easy to sing along to music, listen to mine!\n\nSo how about you dear Tunie? Do you feel musical? Are you concerned that your baby might not end up musical if you aren’t?

In this post you’ll get some examples of listening to your inner voice and a quick but powerful exercise for teaching your kids how to locate that voice when they’re in a bind.\n\nSo many times life throws us an opportunity or a situation that might feel benign or even exciting on the surface, but doesn’t feel quite aligned with where we’re at.\n\nHere’s an examples: A couple of years ago, when I started working on my online course, I spoke to someone who offered to pay for the production of my next album. Making an album costs A LOT. My head said YEEEESSSS!\n\nBut my stomach said Nooooooooo.\n\nI sat with it for a while and realized that I needed to turn him down. It just didn’t feel like the right time. I had to trust that my intuition was guiding me in the right direction and that when I was ready to make an album I would have the opportunity I needed.\n\nThat was an instance when I was able to listen to my inner voice but there are so many times when I just can’t seem to hear it.\n\nOne of our jobs as parents is to help our kids exercise their intuition muscle so that it will be easier for them to make the right decisions throughout their lives. Don’t we wish someone had done the same for us?\n\nSo how do we do it?\n\nBasically we need to help our kids distinguish between the voice that speaks out of intuition and the one that speaks out of FEAR.\n\nTo do this I turned to some of the current smart, creative, motivated and accomplished women who teach us how to be true to ourselves, like Elizabeth Gilbert, Luvvie Ajayi Jones, Glennon Doyle, Brene Brown and Marie Forleo.\n\nThey teach that the inner voice is steady and calm. We may ignore it sometimes but it is unwavering. It has a quiet confident nature to it.\n\nOn the other hand the voice that contradicts our inner voice speaks f"
