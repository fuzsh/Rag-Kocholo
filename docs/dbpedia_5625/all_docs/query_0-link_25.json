        "text": "BEVERLY JOHNSON: The Grace Behind the Face\n\n((c)2023 David Lefkowitz. This article was commissioned by Long Island Woman magazine for publication in their Aug/Sept. 2023 issue.)\n\nBeverly Johnson’s 2015 memoir begins with memory of a party at the home of fashion designer Halston in 1973. Amidst the astonishing opulence, Johnson also witnessed naked dancers, gallons of champagne, acres of cocaine, Liza Minnelli eating on the staircase, and Liz Taylor loaning Johnson the million-dollar diamond ring gifted to her by her soon-to-be ex, Richard Burton.\n\nWhat was your last party like?\n\nOf course, Johnson, then just 21 and plunged into a world far removed from her middle-class upbringing in Buffalo, NY, couldn’t guess that her own life would be filled with similar levels of wealth, decadence, drama, and sheer wonder. But being beautiful and (often) lucky goes a long way in this world, and the now-70-year-old icon has much to reflect on as she approaches the 50th anniversary of being the first black face to grace the cover of Vogue magazine. (It was the November 1974 issue, and Vogue was founded in 1892 so, yeah, it was time). Johnson told BBC News years later that when her cover hit the stands, “I was interviewed by people from Africa and from Europe. They were saying, ‘It’s about time that America woke up!’ It was just life-changing.” It also awakened her to the level of racial bias in America from which her parents tried to shield her. And although the country has come a long way, color and background remain barriers and sometimes battlegrounds.\n\nComparatively light-skinned, with lush hair and an aquiline nose, Johnson’s features may be said to fit the European model of beauty—which may have gained her early entry into the magazine world but also point to divisions within the black community itself over the aesthetics of more traditionally African traits. “It’s so interesting,” Johnson tells Long Island Woman in our springtime Zoom chat. “When I started modeling, I was not light-skinned. I was a brown-skinned model. Golden-brown. I have a baby sister who’s light skinned, but my mother is dark-skinned, and I’m in between. In fact, as a little girl I didn’t know my mother was dark-skinned! There was no `pretty’ in our house; you get good grades and try to win on the swim team. And you’re just a kid.\n\n“But when I went to New York City,” continues Johnson, “that was an awakening for me.” Eileen Ford, who, with her husband co-founded the Ford agency, dismissed aspiring models with instant insults: “Too light. Too dark,” and for young Johnson, “Too fat.” Days later, seeing Johnson’s pictures in other magazines, Ford would about-face, call her back to the office, and hire her, saying, “Beverly, you’ve lost weight!” As Johnson and co-writer Allison Samuels added in The Face that Changed it All, Johnson responded with her “best and brightest smile…to the very best of [Ford’s] bullshit.”\n\nHowever, Johnson points with pride at how the needle has moved: “What’s wonderful about the industry now is that you do see this diversity in skin color. It goes the spectrum from the lightest of the light to Asian colors to the darkest of the dark. And, of course, my granddaughter is a dark-skinned little girl. I’m so happy the industry shows these beautiful dark-skinned women and that my granddaughter will not be in the old kind of world. It still exists, but not the way it used to.”\n\nTime and changing tastes are often enemies in a model’s life, but Johnson neither rests on her laurels nor dials back her activities being a vision people wish to see wearing spectacular clothes. “I did Fashion Week two years in a row,” she notes. “It was a wonderful experience, but it’s hard. Can you imagine what I had to do to get ready for that? But, wow, Bibhu Mohapatra did this incredible show with only black models. And you know what? I’m five-eight, but all of them were six-foot-one. Not some, all of them. At that height, you couldn’t model in my day. At least not on a runway. I guess people are taller now.”\n\nStill, says Johnson, short(er) people got reason to live: “I was the Queen of the White Party in Palm Springs. It’s the biggest gay party in the world, and let me tell you, I walked out as a queen! It was so much fun! So you still celebrate, and there are still parties. Plus I have many exuberant, extroverted friends, like my fiancé. He gets me out of the house.”\n\nSaid fiancé is big-time investment banker Brian Maillian, who has been Johnson’s steady for more than a decade. “When I was breaking barriers in the fashion industry in the 70s and 80s, he was breaking barriers on Wall Street,” explains Johnson. “He was, like, the first black guy at Salomon Brothers. And we lived 10 blocks from each other and never met! He was even married to a model who I knew. Astrologists used to tell me, `You’re not gonna meet the man of your dreams till really late in your life.’ I denied it, but sure enough!”\n\nJohnson’s life before Maillian was not short of male company, ranging from romances with record executive Benny Medina and sports legends Arthur Ashe and Mike Tyson to single dates with Jack Nicholson (very nice) and Eddie Murphy (not so much). But then there were the negative experiences, including a weed-selling, philandering first husband and a vindictive, manipulative, mob-linked second hubby whose gaslighting led to a custody battle and a sedated Johnson waking up in a psychiatric hospital. Go figure that she would still be good friends with her first ex (real-estate agent Billy Potter, who is invited to all her major events) and that she would help her second when he neared the end of his life. To be fair, Johnson had to consider that Danny Sims was the father of her only child, model Anansa Sims. “He was a bad guy,” admits Johnson. “There’s no way you can get away from that. But my daughter loved him.” Which is why Anansa’s music-producer dad, who helped make Bob Marley a superstar but also may have taken more than his fair share of the reggae legend’s profits, came to live in Johnson’s house for two weeks before passing in 2012. “We really learned a lot,” the model recalls. “For instance, my daughter bought a lot of homes, so I told Danny, `Yeah, I put the downpayment on that one.’ And he said, `No, I put the downpayment on that house.’ We looked at each other and realized that we both had been giving her money! We laughed together so hard, and I said, `She’s her father’s daughter.’”\n\nJohnson recalls her own father with much respect and fondness. “I owe my dad everything,” she says. “He was a very interesting, hard-working man who worked in a steel plant. He spoke all these different languages because he went to war. (We’re still trying to figure out which war that is, but I’m pretty sure it was Korea.) But because he was a master of languages, he had a worldly way about him. People were attracted to him—his good looks and his whole manner. A terrific, strong man and disciplinarian who thought he was the boss. Actually, mom was the boss, but we let him think he was the boss!”\n\nAs for Johnson’s mother, the model remembers “how she carried herself with dignity. We did a photo shoot together, and they said, `Oh, your mother’s beautiful—now I see where you got it.’ And my whole existence is because of my mother—philosophical, spiritual, how I present myself to the world.”\n\nWhile that presentation may be outwardly flawless on magazine covers, Johnson isn’t afraid to share her life’s dirty laundry along with its golden gowns. Her book covers her mistakes with men, early-career abortion, eating disorders, petty tussles with other models, and—no shock here—need for AA when substance abuse dug her a hole too deep to climb out of. Echoing the mantra of so many alcoholics, Johnson intones, “You’re always just one drink away from not being sober anymore. It’s one day at a time, and I don’t take it for granted. My father and his father were alcoholics, so I think it most certainly is a gene, since so many people can drink and not get addicted. But my sobriety is a gift, it’s sacred. And it’s been decades.”\n\nNot that those years were all carefree; sometimes old wounds were torn open. Her 1990s relationship with Law & Order and Sex in the City star Chris Noth—which allegedly escalated to violence and ended with Johnson getting a restraining order keeping him 500 yards from her and Anansa—may have felt like ancient history, until several women came forward in 2022 and accused the actor of sexual assault. At the time, she told the New York Post’s Page 6, “I feel bad for his wife and his family, his kids. I just hope everything works out.” Asked now if she feels Noth should have been ostracized years ago owing to his domestic behaviors, Johnson plays it cool: “I am not a person who goes around wishing or hoping or trying to figure out cancel culture. I have too much going on my life to give time or respect to things or people that don’t deserve my time. I believe whatever will happen will happen; I have no control over that.”\n\nBut can she feel the same way about Bill Cosby—the man who invited Johnson to his home for a “rehearsal” of a Cosby Show scene and allegedly prodded her to drink a special cappuccino, one laced with a drug whose effects were quite the opposite of caffeine? Cursing and resisting Cosby until he furiously dragged her downstairs to a cab, Johnson escaped to tell the tale and lived long enough to see the comedy legend jailed in 2015 for sexually assaulting athlete Andrea Constand a decade earlier. However, Johnson also heard the news, in June 2021, that Cosby had been released from prison early, with the verdict overturned (on a legal technicality involving due process). Reminded of this madness, Johnson takes a long pause and then says with pride, “That moment, the whole Cosby issue, moved the needle. It really made a huge difference. We have a long way to go, but it was so major. You can’t put the toothpaste back in the tube; it was done.”\n\nHappily, not all males in Johnson’s sphere proved reprehensible. She lauds Arthur Ashe as “amazing” and “even more dynamic than people would expect.” (Yes, he dumped her brusquely after seven dates, but in finding Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe, “he married the right woman”). For Mike Tyson, who was barely 20 when he dated Johnson in 1986, the model has only fond memories. In her memoir, she calls him “a true hero to the average guy” and essentially blames Robin Givens for the ugliness that would ensue in his next relationship. Says Johnson of Tyson’s later problems, “People make mistakes, and sometimes you have to pay the consequences. I tell my grandsons when they cry after losing a game, `You will learn more from this failure, this loss, than you will ever learn from winning.’ And that is the absolute truth.”\n\nWith 70 years of her own successes and failures to draw from, Johnson is sharing what she can with future generations. Apart from her philanthropic work with the Barbara Sinatra Children’s Center and Global Down Syndrome Foundation, Johnson is doubling down on her commitment to the Model Alliance, an advocacy organization formed by models who were sent to Europe as teenagers, used and abused there, and came back traumatized but determined to change the game. Says Johnson, “I couldn’t give all I could to the Alliance when it started because I’d just come out of all that Cosby stuff and was reeling. But these spectacularly intelligent young ladies have a dream that we in the fashion industry can be protected. Where we can report something that happened to us or maybe even have a union, or health insurance. That would be nice! Or the modeling agencies would finally have to be transparent about how much money we’re getting—we don’t know; we take their word for it. I always had the passion for this organization, but now I have the freedom and energy to be more involved.”\n\nAs for the future of modeling in a business that is replacing airbrushing with full-on digitizing, Johnson waxes philosophical. “My dear friend Steve Kamifuji, the creative director of GenLux fashion magazine, sent me the latest issue [Spring 2023] online. He created the cover—with a model called `Aileen.’ But it was A.I.! It was stunning. You would not be able to realize that this was not a living person. I mean, I even copied her makeup. So I told Steve that I would never do another GenLux cover—unless it’s an A.I. cover of me!\n\n“Seriously, people might say, `Oh, they’re going to be replacing models now,’” Johnson acknowledges. “But this is the way it is. The fax machine replaced letters.” Still, Johnson doesn’t see the human subject going extinct. Instead, it’s just important “to keep up with all the going iterations of what it means to be a fashion model.”\n\nJohnson’s experiences have also gone into a solo show she’s developed with Joshua Ravetch (who co-wrote Carrie Fisher’s Wishful Drinking). Following a successful workshop of the monologue in West Hollywood—and then a two-year pandemic pause—Beverly Johnson “IN VOGUE” is getting back on its feet, including a one-nighter at this year’s Palm Springs Film Festival. “You laugh, you cry, there’s videos,” laughs Johnson. “It’s a fun hour and a half. And it’s my journey.”\n\n*\n\nSIDEBAR:\n\nBEVERLY JOHNSON – SNAPSHOTS\n\nALL-TIME FAVORITE SONG\n\nJames Brown’s “Say it Loud, I’m Black and I’m Proud.”\n\nFAVORITE BOOKS AND AUTHORS\n\nDavid McCullough’s John Adams and anything by Toni Morrison. I’ve gotten to listen to them on Audible, and now I really understand her brilliance.\n\nFAVORITE PAINTER\n\nOne of my longest relationships was with Daut Berisha, an Albanian artist who didn’t speak English. My daughter helped him learn it, and as soon as he did, we broke up. But he was a genius, and his paintings are everywhere on my walls.\n\nFAVORITE TV SERIES\n\nI think I’ve watched The Crown six or seven times.\n\nLOWEST GOLF SCORE\n\nI almost shot par (73 on a 72). I missed a short putt on the 18th hole and sobbed like a baby. I’m tearing up now just thinking about it!\n\nHEALTHY EATING HABITS\n\nFor models, eating disorders are an occupational hazard. I still have it—it never goes away. But the idea of “pleasure eating” rather than a strict diet has been working for me. I’m writing a book on it.\n\nFAMOUS PERSON YOU WISH YOU’D MET\n\nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nFAVORITE QUOTE\n\nDiana Vreeland telling me, “Dahling, you should always wear red.”\n\nWOULD YOU MARRY AGAIN?\n\nBrian and I plan on getting married. But he’s an extrovert, so he wants 1,500 people at the wedding. I want a hundred. We’re working it out.\n\n****\n\nORIGINAL BYLINE:\n\nDavid Lefkowitz (davelefkowitz.org), an award-winning playwright, teaches courses in English and film at two universities.

This article was published in Long Island Woman magazine, June/July 2023.)\n\nIt’s been a quarter century since, with flaming red hair, a deceptively healthy-looking glow, and a gold-selling solo album already behind her, Belinda Carlisle told the world (via the lyrics of Rick Nowels and Ellen Shipley), “Ooh, heaven is a place on earth.” In the years since, the songstress has often been startlingly outspoken about her hellish childhood and the demonic grip of drugs and drink on her adulthood through middle age. Nevertheless, Carlisle’s ability to persevere, manifest good luck at just the right time, and deliver music that climbs the charts and engages a legion of longtime fans, has put her in a place that can legitimately be called heavenly. She lives in Mexico with her husband of 36 years, film producer (and son of renowned actor James Mason) Morgan Mason; she chants daily and travels often, and she pours her creative energies only into projects she can’t resist.\n\nConsider that Carlisle’s last album, 2017’s Wilder Shores, put lush pop tunes to lyrics that were Punjabi Sikh chants, and the disk before that, 2007’s Voila, saw her covering French chansons by the likes of Gainsbourg and Brel. In other words, one could hardly imagine the 64-year-old former Germ and Go-Go trying to climb back on the Tilt-A-Whirl of American Top-40—the place “Mad About You” reached #3 in 1986, “I Get Weak” grasped #2 in 1988, and the aforementioned “Heaven” hit #1 the year in between. And yet, here Carlisle is, starting a round of press and tour dates to back a new single and EP.\n\n“It’s so weird, the singer explains in her late-winter Zoom chat with Long Island Woman, “because I’d been thinking of slowing down and living a really quiet life with a donkey sanctuary in Mexico or something like that.” But then her son Duke was at an L.A. Starbucks and ran into “I Get Weak” songwriter Diane Warren (whose credits also include Cher’s “If I Could Turn Back Time,” Chicago’s “Look Away,” Starship’s “Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now,” and Celine Dion’s “Because You Loved Me”). Warren asked Duke what his mom was up to, and when Duke wasn’t sure, the songwriter, whom Carlisle warns “has the foulest language in the business,” FaceTimed her. Carlisle picked up the phone to hear: “Bitch, get down to the studio. I have some some hits for you.”\n\nEven in 2023, success in the music industry is more than just laying down some tracks in your bedroom and waiting for the Spotify royalties to pour in. “It’s a big commitment,” explains Carlisle. “A year and a half or two years out of my life. But I happened to be in L.A. when Diane called, so I went down to the studio, and she played me the songs. And I freaked out. It was a gift—especially since she could have given them to someone much younger than me. There’s a lot of `em out there, and those songs could have meant a guaranteed Top Ten. So I said, `Okay, let’s go!’ and recorded five songs for an EP, which is called `Kismet.’ The whole thing was really enjoyable.”\n\nCarlisle, whose tour will reach the NYCB Theater in Westbury on July 18, waxes only slightly nostalgic for the older days of the music biz. “When I started, it was 8-Tracks—well, no, maybe cassettes!” she laughs. “I won’t date myself that much. But sure, I miss something tangible, in my hand, with artwork, credits, and thank yous—which is why vinyl and even CDs are coming back. But it’s all about streaming now; that’s just the way it is. I’d been resistant at first, but I have to say, I love it, too.”\n\nIt took many years for Carlisle to open up and love any aspect of the music business, as she spent most of her Go-Go’s and early solo period coked to the gills offstage, and feeling like an objectified, imposter-syndrome fraud when actually performing. Her can’t-put-it-down 2010 autobiography, Lips Unsealed, goes into surprising detail, not only about the singer’s unhappy childhood of an abandoning father and a drunken, physically abusive (in the guise of discipline) stepdad, but also her efforts to make sure that drugs were available at each stop of every tour. If she started looking whacked out and bloated—with the press relentlessly remarking on whether she was looking svelte or chubby— that was just a cue for her eating disorders to kick in.\n\nPerhaps the bio’s saddest anecdote involved John Belushi, a Go-Go’s fan who became part of their circle when the group were staying in New York. Recounting the story to LIW, Carlisle recalls, “John was the nicest guy and so generous. He had a minder with him all the time that would control his impulses—the food and drugs. So we were recording [debut album] Beauty and the Beat and staying at the Wellington Hotel in New York, and one of the other girls and I decided to buy some coke. We couldn’t find anybody in New York, so we had somebody FedEx it to us. And we were thinking, `Yeah, we’re gonna go out on the town.’\n\n“Then John came along,” continues Carlisle, “so we offered him some. He went nuts on us! He said, `You’re gonna be famous one day, and everyone’s gonna be offering you drugs. You’re gonna ruin your lives!’ We were taken aback and just went, `Okayyy…’”\n\nA week later, Belushi called their room near midnight—“which felt strange,” Carlisle remembers. “We were all in our pajamas, but we said, `Come on up.’ He did, and he was out of his mind. He wanted us to go out on the town with him, and we were like, `John, are you okay?’ That was kind of the beginning of the end.” Beauty and the Beat was recorded in spring 1981 and released in July. Eight months later, the destroyed body of 33-year-old John Belushi was carried out of the hotel Chateau Marmont.\n\nAsked why the comic actor’s death didn’t serve as an abrupt wake-up call to the group, Carlisle avers, “We were young and stupid. And arrogant. You don’t ever think like that. And John always seemed a lot older, even though it was just ten years’ difference. We were in our early twenties and still felt immortal, that nothing bad could happen to us, so it didn’t scare me at all.”\n\nBad things did happen to Carlisle over the years, including panic attacks, unwanted contact from her suddenly reappearing birth dad, marital problems when she covered up her insobriety, and typical musician tensions when the Go-Go’s matured from punky teens into women with a band and a brand but diverging individual (and financial) interests. And yet, Carlisle can’t deny being born under a lucky star, having smoothly off-ramped from being lead vocalist for an iconic pop group to instant, and even greater, commercial success via her 1980s solo records. And not only didn’t her nose fall off after all that blow, she’s somehow maintained her signature wiggly vibrato that one “friend” dismissively compared to a goat’s bleat but pop fans have recognized and appreciated for five decades.\n\nShe’s also in a good headspace in terms of family. Though she sometimes regrets that, because of her career, the raising of Duke often fell to her husband, she avows that when she was there, “she was very present as a mother.” Her current relationship with Duke is “amazing,” and she remains proud of his courage to come out as gay when he was only 14 years old. “We’re very lucky to have a son who knew who he was at an early age. We’re a close-knit family, and one of the great things about living in Mexico is that it’s only three hours from L.A., so we see him more often.”\n\nAs for her own parents, Carlisle’s mom is 84 and suffering from Parkinson’s. “I talk to her every single day,” says the singer. “And what’s weird is that I don’t think I’ve been as close to her since I was a teenager. That could be owing to her illness and my promise to take care of her the best I could.” Carlisle has long come to terms with Joanne Carlisle allowing her daughter’s early life to be steeped in poverty, violence, and chaos. “Yes, that was hard to let go of—the enabling,” admits Belinda, “but my mom had me when she was seventeen. She did the best she could given the circumstances.” Carlisle even worked things out with Walt, her late stepfather, who was a gent when sober and a tyrant when frequently not. “We’d been fine since the late 80s,” she notes. “He got sober. And there were `sorries’ without him ever actually saying `I’m sorry,’ since my dad kept a lot of things inside and didn’t wear his heart on his sleeve. I like to think he was at peace when he passed away.”\n\nAsked the invariable question about her other family-like relationship, Carlisle nixes any idea of a reunion. “The Go-Go’s are finished,” she affirms. “But we’ve all been through so much together that we’ll always be in each other’s lives. I mean, we’re friendly, and we still have emails going back and forth. I talked to Charlotte [Caffey] a couple of weeks ago.\n\n“To be honest” she continues, “some of the girls wanted it to go on, and some of us didn’t. But I thought it would be great to go out on a high note—which we did: the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction. That’s about as good as it gets; it cemented our legacy. Anything we would do now would just be for the money. And I don’t like to see bands going on past their sell-by date. Why not just quit while we’re ahead?”\n\nDisappointed fans should keep in mind that had the Go-Go’s stayed together, Carlisle might not have had five decades of her own career, including the opportunity to work with such luminaries as Beatle George Harrison and Beach Boy Brian Wilson. “With George,” remembers Belinda, “you never know if you don’t ask. So we asked. And he played on a couple of songs.” In fact, a 1992 Guitar World magazine interview quotes Harrison as saying his all-time best slide-guitar solos were on “Leave a Light On” and “Deep Deep Ocean” from Carlisle’s Runaway Horses album.\n\nAs for Wilson, “I worked with him quite a bit. I sang background vocals on two of his albums, and he sang on my A Woman and a Man album—and did the vocal arrangements. That included his coming into the studio and singing it all, which was maybe the most amazing moment in my career.\n\n“Brian is deaf in one ear,” Carlisle elaborates, “so he’s doing everything in the studio on a little cassette player. And because he’s very eccentric, he’s also hard to follow. So he started singing the parts over the basic tracks that we gave him. We listened back, and it didn’t sound good. We didn’t know what he was doing. And, I mean, he would belch between lines. We thought, `Oh, my God. This is so horrible. What are we gonna do?’ That’s when the producer, who was also horrified, said, `Just put him in the vocal booth, and we’ll see what happens.’ Well, all of a sudden, all the things Brian was singing to us in the control room…it turned out he was layering, and it just came to life. I have goosebumps talking about it now. It was like watching Mozart. Just the most beautiful and amazing experience. When he left, I burst into tears. Nobody could work for the rest of the day. For everybody there, it was one of the most emotional days of our lives.”\n\nCarlisle has little doubt that life will bring more beautiful and emotional days, whether it’s from music-making, traveling to exotic locales, or enjoying her Mexican home. Clocking my skepticism about security south of the border, she laughs. “I feel safer here than I do in L.A. You’re just hearing propaganda and a pissing contest going on between America and Mexico. I mean, there are things you don’t do in any big city. I can’t wear nice watches anymore on the street in L.A. or New York, and you can’t here, either. And if you go where the cartel is, you’re gonna have problems. But otherwise, we laugh at these State Department announcements of, ‘Oh, don’t go to Mexico with all the kidnappings.’ We’ve always loved Mexico, and I don’t ever want to leave.”\n\nAnd why should she? “Life is even more exciting now than it ever was,” Carlisle gushes. “Sure, I was dreading turning 50. And then at 60, you start feeling your mortality a little bit. But I’m not a typical 64-year-old. I’m glad I went through those amazing decades of the Sixties, Seventies, and Eighties and am still here. I’m very active and creative and work as much as I like, which is a blessing. And I’m truly present in my life.”\n\nIt’s clear that in more ways than one, Belinda Carlisle has found big big love.\n\n*\n\nSIDEBAR – SHORT SHORT QUESTIONS\n\nWhat’s on your current playlist?\n\nOasis, Blur, Radiohead, and a lot of Indian devotional music, like Krishna Das and Snatam Kaur. I’m a big Kirtan [chanting] person and chant every day myself. I also love Maria Callas and Miles Davis. It’s pretty eclectic.\n\nWho’s on your bookshelf?\n\nStefan Zweig’s Beware of Pity, Marjan Satrapi’s graphic novel, Persepolis; Sybille Bedford, Lesley Blanch (my husband’s godmother), and Martha Gellhorn, who was a war correspondent married to Ernest Hemingway and who wrote a lot of great non-fiction. I also read Hollywood biographies, like Gary Cooper and Joan Crawford.\n\nFavorite places to visit in the world?\n\nOld Delhi in India, and Paris.\n\nFavorite painter?\n\nBernard Buffet. He’s pretty big in France, and I have quite a few of his lithographs.\n\nFavorite meal?\n\nItalian. Honestly, I can just have a loaf of bread, salt, and olive oil.\n\nFavorite television?\n\nI don’t really watch much—I read mostly. but there’s an interesting Netflix series on “MH370-The Plane that Disappeared.” Also, the series You, about the serial killer, is great. During the pandemic, thank God for 90-Day Fiancé, which is super trashy but super good.\n\nFavorite Go-Go’s song lyrics?\n\nFrom “Lust to Love” (written by Charlotte Caffey & Jane Wiedlin).\n\nIf you could have dinner with an icon, alive or dead, it would be…?\n\nMartha Gellhorn, Maria Callas, or Marcello Mastroianni, who’s my all-time favorite anything. I had the biggest crush on him. When I was a teenager, I saw La Dolce Vita. After that, I wanted to smoke cigarettes and ride on the backs of scooters with cute Italian boys. It changed my whole idea of what I wanted to do and how I wanted to live my life.\n\n*\n\nBYLINE:\n\nDavid Lefkowitz (davelefkowitz.org) is an adjunct English professor and award-winning playwright whose short comedies, Restoration Playhouse, and Three Percent, were both produced virtually in theater festivals.

This article was first published in the Oct/Nov 2022 issue of Long Island Woman magazine.)\n\nGloria Gaynor: On Surviving and Looking Ahead: Exclusive Interview with Gloria Gaynor\n\nIf you’ve been swimming in the sea of troubles that currently roil American life—violence, inflation, divisive politics, infectious diseases—one classic song has probably come into your head at some point. Or maybe you’ve lived through earlier ordeals, from wars to the World Trade Center, and the same song swelled in your soul. Or perhaps you dealt with a more personal tragedy—abuse, health scares, divorce, losing a loved one—and at the lowest point, you heard this lyric in your head:\n\n“I’ve got all my life to live\n\nAnd I’ve got all my love to give\n\nand I’ll survive\n\nI will survive.”\n\nIt’s the song that keeps on giving, be it to gays in the AIDS era, women in the #MeToo movement, front-line workers during COVID, or wage slaves one paycheck away from homelessness. Penned in the mid-1970s (by Dino Fekaris and Freddie Perren) and released in 1978 at the height of disco, “I will Survive” has managed to stay beloved well into the post-millennial hip-hop era. Throughout, the anthem has given its singer a long-lasting, ever-replenishing career — even as struggles throughout Gloria Gaynor’s life forced her into what can only be ca"
