        "text": "What is a Human Design Projector? Projectors are here to help us grow and evolve through unusual methods of leadership. For this month’s podcast, hear about Gloria Gaynor, Human Design Projector and owner of 9 different voices.\n\nTo listen to this podcast on Youtube, go here.>>\n\nWhat Is a Human Design Projector?\n\nThere are 5 types to Human Design and Gloria Gaynor is a Projector type.\n\nWhat is a Human Design Projector? They are the new leaders and guides of human development as we currently know it.\n\nSo what does Gloria Gaynor’s story have to do with being a Human Design Projector?\n\nIf her birthdate is indeed 7th September 1943, then according to the software I use to calculate her Human Design, she is a Projector Type.\n\nA Human Design Projector is a type of human that has been incarnating since the mid-1700s in our most recent human history.\n\nProjectors are designed to be a new type of leader and guide for humanity, replacing Manifestor (types like me).\n\nA Projector is someone who can connect with the energy of a group or an individual to help them achieve a goal, project or even a movement.\n\nSome Famous Examples\n\nSome examples of famous Projectors from the recent past are: –\n\nWinston Churchill\n\nQueen Elizabeth II\n\nNelson Mandela and\n\nNapoleon.\n\n(Napoleon wasn’t a particularly evolved example of a human being, since he carried out some war atrocities during his time, but he definitely knew how to lead and get people to follow him).\n\nHuman Design Projectors – More Examples\n\nSome examples of present-time Projectors are: –\n\nBarack Obama\n\nPablo Picasso\n\nSteven Spielberg\n\nPrincess Anne Princess Royal\n\nTaylor Swift and, of course,\n\nGloria Gaynor.\n\nProjectors are non-Sacral beings, like Manifestors.\n\nMore or Less Sacral Chakra Energy?\n\nIf you are a non-Sacral being (about 30% of the population), it means you must work with your energy differently to be effective than other types who have a defined Sacral Chakra.\n\nProjectors and Manifestors have less consistent energy than the majority of people on Earth, such as Generators and Manifesting Generators.\n\nGenerator Types have consistent access to their Sacral energy and can work continuously until they drop.\n\nNon-Sacral Types like Projectors and Manifestors can experience burn out more easily, even if sometimes they can act as if they have lots of Sacral Chakra Energy.\n\nThis access to extra energy usually comes from their involvement with another person or group.\n\nBack to Gloria Gaynor – Guess This\n\nIf I asked you for one thing Gloria Gaynor is well known for, I think I might know what you would say the song: –\n\nI will survive!\n\nGloria Gaynor’s keynote hit has long been a favorite, but when she first released the song, it was seen as only good enough for a B side, when we had such a thing!\n\nGloria knew that this song appealed to people on many levels from the audience response when she sang it. Her then-husband, who was her manager, was not in agreement with her that it should be a hit.\n\nSo, it was released as the B-side to a Righteous Brothers Song called ‘Substitute’.\n\nRead the original story at: –\n\nThe Story of… ‘I Will Survive’ by Gloria Gaynor – Smooth (smoothradio.com)\n\nGloria Gaynor’s Throat Chakra\n\nWhat amazed me when I looked at Gloria Gaynor’s chart was the amount of voice gates that she has activated in her Throat Chakra.\n\nI wrote a post a while about Life Purposes and mentioned Paulo Coehlo, a famous writer who you may know as the author of the best-selling spiritual book called The Alchemist.\n\nI thought Paulo had plenty of throat gates open and active, but Gloria Gaynor has even more!\n\nThroat gates relate to 11 different energetic archetypes in human design, and gates in the Throat Chakra have unique energetics and feel, sensation or tone.\n\nThese gates function differently than gates in any other Chakra. Our Throat Chakras help us to manifest things.\n\nSo, how does Gloria Gaynor fit into all of this from the perspective of understanding her impact on the modern music industry as a leader and guide?\n\nA Human Design Projector with Many Voices\n\nGloria has lots of ‘voices’ in her throat.\n\nFrom the illustration of her chart (see below for her chart), you’ll notice that out of 11 potentially active gates or voices in her throat, Gloria Gaynor has 9 out of the 11 potential gates defined.\n\nThe brown square represents the Throat Chakra in the chart below.\n\nThis number of active gates creates an energetic potential of thousands of connections with people through the expression in her voice.\n\nThis manifestation energy is primarily powered by two other active Chakras, her sense of Self (the green diamond shape below the Throat, and her Ajna, or Third Eye Chakra.\n\nThe Ajna is the darker green triangle above the Throat Chakra.\n\nThink of voice gates in the Throat Chakra as different energetic tones or sensations of expression. Gloria Gaynor’s 9 active voice tones are: –\n\nGate 56 – the Wanderer, creating the energy of curiosity.\n\nGate 35 – the gate of Progress, being versatile.\n\nGate 12 – Standstill, the gate of openness and reflection, sociability.\n\nGate 33 – Retreat, the gate of witnessing.\n\nGate 8 – Contribution – having something to contribute to the conversation.\n\nGate 31 – the gate of Influence, or leadership.\n\nGate 20 – the gate of the Now, manifestation, where thoughts must become deeds.\n\nGate 16 – Selectivity, or the gate of talent.\n\nGate 62 – the gate of Expressing Details, organizing things.\n\nSo, it’s not surprising that a song like ‘I Will Survive’ resonates with many of us and inspires us too.\n\nOrigins of I Will Survive\n\nThe song I Will Survive was written by Dino Fekaris and Freddie Perren.\n\nFekaris wrote most of the lyrics, and his motivation for writing the song was about getting fired by Motown Records.\n\nThe words themselves can be interpreted as an empowerment anthem by many different people in very different situations, and this factor contributes to the unique appeal of the song.\n\nMix this empowerment anthem with the power of the many active gates in Gloria’s Throat Chakra as previously mentioned, and you have a song which connects with many of us on many different levels.\n\nAs Gloria Gaynor herself once said about I Will Survive: –\n\n“I love the empowering effect; I love the encouraging effect. It’s a timeless lyric that addresses a timeless concern.”\n\nGloria Gaynor\n\nThere’s a Movie Out About Gloria, Too\n\nI shall be waiting to see Gloria Gaynor’s movie, which was only shown for one night in Theatres recently (what a travesty!).\n\nI’m looking forward to watching the story of this magnetic and talented Projector sometime soon.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this short insight into the nature of Human Design.\n\nI offer Human Design Readings for anyone who is interested in connecting energetically with their chart.\n\nThrough Human Design you can learn about anything from: –\n\nyour Life Purpose.\n\nYour unique way of making decisions.\n\nIdentifying Shadows and blocks that hold you back.\n\nEven the energies that color and influence your personal success, and much more.\n\nIf you enjoyed this post, you might also enjoy: –\n\nHow to Know If I’m a Human Design Manifestor?\n\nNot Sure About Your Life Purpose?
