        "text": "Disco diva and Newark native Gloria Gaynor of “I Will Survive” fame was in her hometown Friday to donate a collection of Disney-themed paintings that will hang in the hospital where Gaynor was born 80 years ago.\n\nThe singer, born Sept. 7, 1943, at University Hospital on Bergen Street, visited the pediatric ward there to announce the gift of seven paintings by Thomas Kinkade, an artist as popular in his genre as she was in hers.\n\n“I’ve always loved Disney, and then the artist was commissioned to do a Disney Collection,” said Gaynor. “I decided I would get into collecting for myself, so I just bought them as they came out one at a time. Some of them I kept for myself down in Myrtle Beach (South Carolina), where I have a summer home. So, the rest I just decided to donate.”\n\nThe singer gathered with University Hospital President Ed Jimenez and others in the ward, where several of the paintings hung in the main corridor.\n\n“You are so selfless to think of us, to think of our patients and their families, and on behalf of University Hospital, we really appreciate it,“ Jimenez told her. “You’re going to bring light and hope to them and to bring a smile to them or their mom or dad.”\n\nEach work is a limited edition reproduction of a Kinkade original oil painting in his colorful, luminescent style, representing a Disney classic film: Cinderella, The Little Mermaid, Bambi, The Lion King and others. In addition, Gaynor said, all of them have hidden Disney figures from other films that children can try to identify.\n\n“I had fun trying to find them,” Gaynor said.\n\n“I Will Survive,” one of disco music’s biggest hits, is a tale of triumph over adversity, a woman’s defiant vow to carry on despite a broken heart.\n\n“As long as I know how to love/I know I’ll stay alive,” Gaynor sings on the 1978 recording, which 22 years later topped a VH1 ranking of the “100 Greatest Dance Songs” of all time, just ahead of Thelma Houston’s 1976 hit, “Don’t Leave Me This Way.”\n\nThe song became an anthem for successive civil rights movements, first for women seeking independence and equality and later for an LGBTQ+ community amid an AIDS crisis that threatened the literal survival of so many.\n\nGaynor comes from a musical family like other Newark-born divas, including Queen Latifah and Whitney Houston.\n\nBorn Gloria Fowles, Gaynor loved to sing from a young age, and her older brothers sang together as a gospel quartet. But Gloria and her younger brother, Arthur, weren’t welcome in the group, so she eventually began to build a career with Arthur as her manager.\n\nA key break came after she agreed to babysit for a coworker at Newark’s old Bamberger’s department store.\n\n“The first day that I was babysitting for her, I heard somebody walking in the apartment upstairs,” she recalled. “ I wanted somebody to hear me sing. So I began to follow this person’s footsteps, and when they would stop, I would stop and sing. And I did that every day for the two weeks that I was babysitting for my friend.”\n\nA few weeks later, she and Arthur stopped into the Cadillac Club to check out a band.\n\n“And then someone goes up on the stage, and someone goes, ‘Ladies and Gentlemen, there’s a young lady in the audience, and she’s got a really wonderful voice, don’t know her last name, but her first name is Gloria. Maybe if we give her a nice round of applause, we can get her up to sing a song,’” Gaynor recalled, adding the man upstairs was the club owner.\n\n“I sang the song, got a standing ovation, went back to my table, the band comes over and says, ‘Can you sing with us?’ ”\n\nThe rest, as they say, is history.\n\nGaynor lives in Englewood Cliffs but still visits her old hometown, sometimes to see her niece, Hasanna Proctor, a housekeeper at University Hospital who attended Friday’s presentation.\n\nThe singer spent time in Newark filming a documentary about her life, I Will Survive, that premiered in June at the Tribeca Film Festival and will be shown next month at a festival in Nashville, where Gaynor is collaborating with songwriters who’ve penned tunes for Miley Cyrus, Taylor Swift and others, according to her management company.\n\nThe paintings Gaynor donated made up about half of her collection of works by Kinkade, who died in 2012 at 54 after achieving an extraordinary volume of sales through marketing and mass re-production of his works.\n\nDr. Onajovwe Fofah, head of pediatrics at University Hospital, said the paintings would have a therapeutic effect on young patients.\n\n“It helps brighten their day,” Fofah said, “and that translates into wellness.”\n\nNobody knows Jersey better than N.J.com.
