        "text": "Gloria Gaynor shared a TikTok video demonstrating how to scrub up to her disco hit \"I Will Survive.\"\n\nAs the coronavirus continues to spread in the U.S. and around the world, health experts are extolling the benefits of adequate hand-washing technique.\n\nGaynor's video is the latest in a series of musical \"wash your hands\" memes.\n\nAs each day brings news of more confirmed coronavirus cases (including those of Tom Hanks and his wife, actress Rita Wilson), the urge to panic may be tempting, but it isn't productive. What we can do is make sure we're washing our hands correctly to minimize risk of transferring of the virus from person to person. Singer Gloria Gaynor's \"I Will Survive\" challenge is here to help you make it fun, because singing the \"Happy Birthday song\" twice in a row gets old quickly.\n\nAt first we were afraid, we were petrified; mostly because the frantic 24-hour news cycle has made us feel that way. But, as Gaynor points out in a TikTok video re-shared to her Instagram this week, \"It only takes 20 seconds to 'SURVIVE'!\" In the clip, Gaynor stands at a sink and shows of her own hand-washing technique while she lip syncs to her Grammy-winning 1978 hit.\n\nYou definitely know the words—you've been to an American wedding before—but in case you forgot the lyrics, it goes:\n\nOh no, not I, I will survive\n\nOh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive\n\nI've got all my life to live\n\nAnd I've got all my love to give and I'll survive\n\nI will survive, hey, hey\n\nRinse, wash, repeat.\n\nHere's an enthusiastic #IWillSurviveChallenge entry to inspire you. He's not messing around with that hot water steam! Is anyone else feeling like hand-washing is getting borderline-competitive at public bathroom sinks these days? It's a trend we can get behind, though; just don't forget to moisturize those scrubbed-raw paws with plenty of lotion."
