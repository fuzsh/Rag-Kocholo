        "text": "Next week we'll proudly launch our brand new website, a home not only to informed and constructive reviewing but also to video, sound, music and other works for you to experience, whether on computer, tablet or phone, with each accompanied by a critical appreciation. As well, we're reinvigorating RealTime Traveller and RealTime TV, commissioning new video works for our Gallery and video essays about diverse art practices, highlighting video art by emerging artists in Critical Video, and digging into RealTime's treasurehouse of review for the revelatory Deep Archive. Next week's RealTime will take you straight to the new site. In the meantime, enjoy this edition in which the body is the vehicle for self-examination, historical reflection and new dance, and the subject of a visual artist's probing gaze. Keith, Virginia, Lauren\n\nThis week come with us to the UK to meet provocative dance duo Project O, to Mexico for a travelling film festival that confronts corruption, to the US for a film by an Australian that casts citizens as participants in the scenario of a legendary murder, to the Gold Coast for a young artist's take on globalised culture and to Brisbane for a possibly self-mythologising performance by a Sydney ensemble. Visiting Australia from New York, photographer Lili Almog challenges our perceptions of the veiling of women and Japan's techno-wizards teamLab reveal four new works for you to contemplate on this very screen if not in reach of the Sydney gallery where they, and Almog, are exhibiting. From suburban Carlton, Shopfront presents potent new work by young theatre artists at Belvoir and we urge you to take a look at Conor Bateman's video essay Cameraperson to person, widely viewed when it premiered in last week's RealTime. Keith and Virginia\n\nRealTime in real time: change is on the way. In coming weeks we'll launch a new website with special features including commissioned and critiqued video and audio works. As a prelude, we present the first of our commissioned video essays, Cameraperson to person, in which Conor Bateman deploys video to appreciate the workings of Kirsten Johnson's significantly inventive film. It's a joy for us at RealTime to be able to present and respond to art with a greater range of means while sustaining the power of the word at a time when criticism is seriously embattled, giving way to a deluge of likes, stars and tweeted one-liners. The image above is from a percussion work by Australian composer Kate Neal, Never Tilt Your Chair, an exemplar of art's capacity to endlessly invent and mutate, fusing the everyday, theatre and high precision playing from three skilled musicians. Keith & Virginia\n\nNature and the internet: two kinds of plenitude, one of its own making (it bred us) and one of our technological own. They offer commonality, solace and inspiration; exploited, they turn against us. The good news in this edition is that our inherent art-making continues to be succoured by nature in the beautiful bush of Bundanon and its artist residencies where Trevor Flinn becomes Arthur Boyd's Nebuchadnezzar and Next Wave's Kickstarter emerging artists become one with nature and each other. In Kandos, artists populate the NSW country town and adjacent countryside with art. Conor Bateman reveals an astonishing internet wealth of streamed video art that will both challenge and inspire [Ben Russell's experimental film Atlantis, above]. Rogue Agents, at Firstdraft, projects a new wave of cultural and biological evolution while the horror film Raw confronts us with our fears—and regressive temptations. Much to chew on. Keith & Virginia\n\nMost of my encounters with contemporary art and film over recent weeks haven’t happened by visiting a gallery, museum or cinema. Rather, contact's been made via my laptop, smart phone, a giant screen in a public transport space and reflections on the future of film festivals. In RealTime this week I interview the curatorial director of Wynscreen, which delivers moving-image art to travellers passing though Wynyard Station. Ever preoccupied with the horror genre, Katerina Sakkas reviews Olivier Assayas’ technological arthouse ghost story, Personal Shopper, in which a grieving woman (Kristen Stewart) interacts with a mysterious presence via text messaging. Cameron Williams considers the ways that video-on-demand platforms are changing Australian screen culture and challenging film festivals. And in the theatre work Passenger, John Bailey finds himself immersed in a kind of live cinema. The contemporary screen is a radical shape-shifter. Lauren, Acting Assistant Editor\n\nTranslation looms large in RealTime this week as our reviewers tackle the relationship between experience and its distillation into art. Is failure of translation fundamentally more likely than success, asks Andrew Fuhrmann, confronted with the strengths and weaknesses of works in this year's Dance Massive. How meaningful is Asia TOPA's invitation for its audiences to witness or enter heightened states in works that blur the line between lived experience and art [image above: Attractor]? Jana Perkovic is disturbed by abstraction not anchored to any palpable materiality in Chunky Moves' Anti—Gravity and Luke Goodsell perceives a gap at the centre of Rosie Jones' The Family: a failure to explore the life of the woman who led that destructive cult. Matthew Lorenzon enjoys Chamber Made Opera and the Sichuan Conservatory of Music 's Between 8 and 9, which deals directly and playfully with how we can speak about music. Reviewers are translators too, transforming art experiences into their own art, failing or succeeding in expanding and intensifying the looping conversation that art prompts. Keith & Virginia\n\nThere are times when we all need backbone, literally and skilfully displayed in Gravity & Other Myth’s Backbone [image above] and metaphorically in shapeshifting Silvia Calderoni's performance in MDLSX, a wild and frank declaration of a transgender self. Also in the Adelaide Festival, Indigenous performer-composers William Barton and Deborah Cheetham strengthen Australian contemporary music with their innovations. Next up in post-festival Adelaide is Long Tan, a product of the resolve of playwright Verity Laughton, Brink and STCSA to bravely face the realities and myth-making that constellate around the Vietnam War battle. In Melbourne, artist Ash Keating submits his vast new paintings to theatrical lighting design and in Hobart the fascinating Unconscious Collective sync our heartbeats. Next week we boldly plunge into Dance Massive and Asia TOPA. Keith & Virginia\n\nWith the Adelaide Festival's sense of celebration (as in the image above from Barrie Kosky's wondrous Saul) and gravitas still resonating, it was a pleasure to hear that Arts Minister Mitch Fifield has shut down the Catalyst Fund. The return of $61m to the Australia Council was cautiously welcomed by the small to medium arts sector, hoping that funds will definitely now go directly to those for whom they were originally intended. Some 60 arts organisations have gone unfunded, some barely sustained by state government funding, others not, careers floundering, while Catalyst became an electoral slush fund and lucky dip for large arts organisations, festivals, academics and questionable arts ventures benefitting from the suffering of others. The return of funds might look like a victory for art in the culture wars, but there's a lot of catch-up to do, funding levels are less than adequate and Coalition arts policy set at zero. At the very least, we can be thankful that we still have an Australia Council for the Arts while we feel for US artists as President Donald Trump goes gunning for the NEA. Keith & Virginia\n\nWelcome to our International Women’s Day E-dition, which includes Lauren Carroll Harris’ report on promising new directions offered filmmakers and audiences by female-focused film festivals. Above, the team at Women in Film & TV NSW pose in the outfits they wore for their funny and forceful “End the Sausage Party” protest against the low number of nominations for films made by women in the 2016 AACTA Awards. Elsewhere in this E-dition, a cohort of female RealTime writers respond to a variety of out-of-the-ordinary works in the Perth International Arts Festival (Jana Perkovic), Supercell Contemporary Dance Festival (Kathryn Kelly) and Asia TOPA (Sally Sussman and Madeline Roycroft). Demands are rapidly escalating for gender equity and freedom from discrimination and violence in the face of surging dictatorial politics overtly hostile to women's rights. RealTime celebrates women's creative capacity to prevail. We’re off to the Adelaide Festival! See you again on 22 March. Virginia & Keith\n\nPlastic shopping bags in hand, cast members, including a cohort of NIDA students, each become Tiananmen Square’s Tank Man in the much-anticipated Sydney Theatre Company production of UK playwright Lucy Kirkwood’s Chimerica. (Listen to our interview with director Kip Williams about his approach to this epic play.) The title conjures, first, the chimera—a beast from Greek mythology with a lion’s head, a goat’s head rising from the creature’s back and a tail ending in the head of a snake—and then its embodiment as a hybridised China and America. These nations are dangerously co-dependent: mutually hostile and intricately entwined economically. Australia’s foreign policy is habitually oriented to the US while our economic dependency on Chinese purchasing power grows daily. How will we position ourselves as ‘Chimerica’ threatens to unravel? Cultural groundwork is being laid by Asialink, APT, OzAsia, Asia TOPA and others, but the Australian Government faces a major political challenge. Keith & Virginia\n\nLike journalists, documentary filmmakers are increasingly having to compete with the dictatorial purveyors of \"alternative facts.\" Worse, it's happening at the very moment when adept deployers of social media technologies can promulgate blatant untruths with viral ease. Spin doctors emerged in the 1990s and then, a decade ago, satirist Stephen Colbert outed gut-feeling, evidence and logic-free \"truthiness,\" which has now come totally into its own. Outright lies and glaring contradictions are served up without even the gloss of spin. So it's timely for the 2017 Australian International Documentary Conference to address the challenges for the documentarian in a \"post-truth\" world and, at the same time, assay the—at first glance unlikely—potentials of gaming and VR technologies for generating honest, immersive, interactive engagements with eras, cultures and ideas. Keith & Virginia\n\nAs we wrap up our intensive Sydney Festival coverage—looking back with pleasure on a finely curated, richly themed program of memorable works—we turn to Asia TOPA, an exciting new triennial festival in Melbourne centred on Asian performance and promising works that will challenge the senses and widen Australian horizons. Also in this E-dition, Chris Reid travels to Hobart to take in MOFO's excellent electronics-focused program. Next week we anticipate the Australian International Documentary Conference [AIDC], also in Melbourne, at ACMI, and preview the Adelaide Festival's dramatically distinctive 2017 program. Keith and Virginia\n\nEDITORIAL\n\nWesley Enoch's first Sydney Festival was buoyant with the sense of occasion anticipated in our interview last December. Some festival-goers have been excited by what they've experienced as \"a decolonising of the festival,\" with its strong programming of Indigenous artists. Others have been thrilled by the sensory and formal adventurousness of a range of works. This E-dition is the first of two focused on the festival. Next week Nikki Heywood will respond to Still Life and Institute, Vick Van Hout to Prize Fighter, Blood on the Dance Floor and Huff and James Whiting to King Roger. We'll also address The Encounter, SHIT, The Season, Champions and have another look at Biographica. Elsewhere this week we take you to Venice, Pakistan and then Adelaide for something international from Lloyd Cole. Good to have you with us for 2017! Keith and Virginia\n\nOh what a year! As the rise of dictatorial state capitalism and the conservative push for a one-size-fits-all culture suggest, we can expect hard times ahead. Our editorial image is from Dmitry Krymov's Opus No. 7, a powerful imagistic account of the fate of Russia's Jews and the compromised composer Shostakovitch under Stalin; it's featured in the 2017 Perth International Arts Festival. We look back over a year in which our coverage ranged across the country, from OzAsia and Liveworks to small regional festivals and hundreds of individual works. Take the holiday season to revive your spirits. We look forward to keeping you in touch with the art that sustains us in 2017. Keith & Virginia\n\nRemembrance & Forgetting. English psychoanalyst Adam Phillips, writing about Oscar Wilde in his book Unforbidden Pleasures (2015), notes that \"great art, in Wilde's view...enables us to forget ourselves, our rational, conforming, intelligible, law-abiding, too-timid, explaining selves, and this forgetting makes things possible.\" Within a constellation of works ('great' or not) in an arts festival, we can even more intensely lose ourselves to reverie, joy, passion and bewilderment. Phillips extrapolates: \"What we don't know, what we haven't understood, can be the realest thing about us.\" A good festival demands such openness. But it can also enact remembrance, of what we have forgotten or will forget or never knew, as Wesley Enoch looks to do with his 2017 Sydney Festival, celebrating the 1967 Referendum (which acknowledged the humanity of the Indigenous peoples of Australia), cultural continuity (in the lives of Tasmania’s muttonbirders; image above, Trevor Jamieson in The Season), and with sadness, the art of Myuran Sukumaran. Keith & Virginia\n\nThe world opens and contracts. The image above is of dance artist Matt Shilcock in his 2015 work The Likes of Me, which he co-directed with mentor Dean Walsh. In For All We Know (or thought we knew) Part II, Dean reflects on what he's learned from his collaborations with artists who have a disability. The exponential growth of talented artists in this field reflects a growing openness in our society to their assertion of worth and our acceptance and acknowledgment of those once considered incapable of autonomy. But there are signs of contraction—a narrowing and potential erasure of hard-won human rights to equality, unexploited labour, asylum and freedom from prejudice. I recall my primary school years in the 1950s when schoolyard-segregated \"deaf and dumb\" students were the subjects of derision and taunts. The growing call from the right for the freedom to insult with impunity denies freedom from prejudice to those too easily defined as different. Keith\n\nThe new abnormal. The international trend towards demagoguery and the diminution of democracy moves closer to home with, among other things, Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act under threat from an increasingly right-swinging Liberal-National Government. RealTime this week includes reviews of works that address old norms—rape culture, racism, masculinist popular culture, fear of immigrants—which are finding cancerous new life as they fuse with fact-free, empathy-challenged alt-right, libertarian and One Nation populism. At least now, thanks to Prime Minister Turnbull doing a Howard, we know who we are, part of the “media elite,” oblivious to the concerns of ordinary Australians. Next on the list? Artists? Keith and Virginia\n\nPerformance Space’s 2016 Liveworks attracted loyal fans, hungry for experimental art and many others, attracted by the unusual. This E-dition features reviews of most of the festival’s diverse works that occupied Carriageworks in a way that made sense of the building. There’s an overview from us of the ‘bigger picture’ that Liveworks offers of our culture, its connections with Asia, the self, Indigeneity and community. It’s a festival well worth celebrating in dark times. Keith & Virginia, Oztrayah, Trumpistan\n\nThis week we traverse, celebrate and reduce distances at the very moment the Turnbull Government attempts to push refugees ever further beyond Australia and our consciousness—out of empathy’s reach. In Sydney’s Fairfield, women of diverse cultures take to the streets in artworks and ethnic celebrations that engender visibility and reduce the gap that is gender inequality. Further west, Casula Powerhouse draws together wonderfully eccentric sculptures from across Australia prior to touring to eight regional galleries. The Book of Daughters places women at the centre of the sonic arts, anticipating future equality and bringing together Australian and Asian performers. Next week, our feature coverage of Performance Space’s Liveworks Festival of Experimental Art. Keith & Virginia\n\nResilience & Resistance. Resilience is a strikingly recurrent theme in this E-dition. In Project Xan, a woman appears as herself in performance, reflecting on the consequences of being raped and blamed for it at age 12. Emma Beech in Life is Short and Long conjures intimate conversations she’s had with people facing crises, personal, social and economic. For reviewer Francis Russell, Gosia Wlodarczak’s A Room Without A View (Extended) suggests the power of drawing as a kind of refrain for containing chaos. French-Algerian choreographer Nacera Belaza, performing The Shout in Dancehouse’s Border Lines, writes of being “grounded in the rhythms of Gnawa, a kind of ancient African spiritual music based on the chant-like repetition of refrains and phases.” As Andrew Fuhrmann observes, The Shout and (in the same program) Sarah-Jane Norman’s Take This For It Is My Body, resiliently secure tradition against disintegration but are equally acts of bodily resistance, as are all the works, in their own ways, mentioned here. We’ll be back 9 November; see you then. Keith & Virginia\n\nSigns of Life. Will Sydney, Perth and Adelaide’s summer festivals breathe new life into an over-tired, hyperactive, fuzzy formula? Relatively small, artform or theme-focused arts festivals (BIFEM, OzAsia, Next Wave, Dance Massive, Liveworks) offer cogency, communality and a sense of difference with works that collectively take you out of the ordinary. The gigantism of their large peers—international arts and fringe festivals—limits shared appreciation and buries significant works amid all too familiar festival fare. But much can be forgiven if an overarching sense of purpose—social, political and aesthetic, whether or not themed—is evident. From what we’ve learned (details in coming weeks) two of Australia’s forthcoming international arts festivals are showing the signs of life we yearn for. In the meantime, we have reports from idiosyncratic festivals in the Ruhr and Riga, reviews of distinctive works in this year’s Melbourne Fringe and previews of the much anticipated Liveworks—including Thunderhead (image above)—an artstorm about to break. Keith & Virginia\n\nOZASIA FESTIVAL SPECIAL EDITION\n\nWith intensive coverage of 18 of its shows, we celebrate the success of this year’s festival, OzAsia’s 10th. The annual event was initiated by Adelaide Festival Centre CEO Douglas Gautier, who had previously worked in Hong Kong, and taken to a new level in 2015 and 2016 by OzAsia’s Artistic Director Joseph Mitchell whose eye for innovation and diversity in Asian art and performance of all kinds has given us works with which to see the world and ourselves anew. According to our Adelaide correspondents Ben Brooker and Chris Reid this was the best OzAsia yet. For us it was our first, a storm-defying, mind-bending and sense-expanding experience. One of our great pleasures is to live-in at a festival, responding to it in detail, as RealTime has done this year with Next Wave and the Bendigo International Festival of Exploratory Music, and many others over 22 years of arts publishing. We’re eager for even greater cross-cultural insights from and immersion in 2017’s OzAsia Festival. Keith & Virginia\n\nOzAsia 2016 is a festival on fire, right now in Adelaide. Hong Kong digital media artist Kingsley Ng’s Gallery Express (image above) is one of the event’s immersive highlights, a surreal journey back to the present from a future, uninhabitable Earth. Chris Reid reviews three of the festival’s engrossing exhibitions in this edition, including Ng’s Record Light. Sensory transformation figures elsewhere as audiences find themselves directly engaged in Lee Serle’s MULTIMODAL and Ohad Naharin’s Decadance. Another kind of transformation is recorded in dancer Dean Walsh’s deeply personal account of coming to a profound understanding of how he relates to the world, to art-making and disability. We’re off to the wonderful OzAsia and will regale you on 12 October with extensive coverage of the performances, public events and visual arts which are transforming the Australian-Asian relationship. Keith & Virginia\n\nTHE SUSTAINABILITY OF RENEWABLE ANXIETY\n\nAnxiety is an invaluable coping mechanism, but exploitable. How can we sustainably manage our concerns—crank up the fear voltage, invent new horrors or seek out alternative visions and possible solutions? These are the kinds of questions asked by Lyndon Blue and Francis Russell on seeing exhibitions about art and ecology at PICA in Perth and apocalypse at Success arts space in Fremantle. Hugh Davies reviews Screen Ecologies, an Australian book we’d love to read about the variety of screen-based artist responses to climate change in our Asia-Pacific region—art that’s actually close to home. Often we feel left out of the action—when did our own government last engage us directly in sustainable environmental programs in the everyday? Anxiety is perpetually renewable but only sustainable when rooted in an evolving, nuanced exchange between research, fact and fine imaginings.\n\nArtistic Director David Chisholm’s Bendigo International Festival of Exploratory Music (BIFEM) again proved itself to be one of Australia’s boldest, intensive arts events. In a mere two and half days, committed audiences, professional, student and community players came together with egalitarian spirit to embrace thrillingly demanding contemporary music, opera, dance and sound art in the city’s centre. The unnervingly brilliant ELISION ensemble, celebrating its 30th birthday, provided three key concerts, two of them involving superb performances from Australian National Academy of Music students, and two with gripping compositions by leading Australian composer Liza Lim, whose 50th birthday was also celebrated. Today, we’re publishing a selection of reviews from the festival’s Music Writers’ Workshop. There’ll be more next week. In our ongoing Arts Education feature, we focus on acting at the Adelaide College of the Arts and on the educational damage being wrought on the Sydney College of the Arts and the culture of Sydney by the NSW Government. Keith & Virginia\n\nWe’ll be brief. There’s so much weird and wonderful reading in this E-dition, taking you from the Darwin Festival to Australia’s newest dance festival, Salamanca Moves (UK artist Liz Aggiss above) in Hobart, from Keith Armstrong’s imaginary ecologies to Tim Darbyshire’s human stress-test, from Toshiki Okada’s critical paean to baseball in the OzAsia Festival to ELISION ensemble’s celebratory exhibition in Melbourne and performances in Bendigo and Sydney Chamber Opera’s revelatory take on Dostoevsky. Our ongoing Arts Education feature focuses this week on Adelaide Central School of Art. While art revels in nuance, complexity and passion, the angry forces of absolutism in the new federal parliament line up to do their worst. It’s time to care. We’re off to the Bendigo International Festival of Exploratory Music—follow us on Partial Durations—and will be back with you on 14 September. Keith and Virginia\n\nThe naked truth E-dition. Revealed this week, Performance Space’s 2016 Festival of Experimental Art features a stellar line-up of Asian and Australian innovators, including Mish Grigor [cover] whose The Talk, about the family and sex, is one of the featured works. In Off the Record, Force Majeure’s performers expose themselves to uncomfortable truths. In Tribunal, Powerhouse Youth Theatre’s stark revelations about our oppression of Aboriginal Australians and refugees render us naked. In Down Under, writer-director Abe Forsythe strips bare the perpetrators of the Cronulla Riots, would-be emperors of the Australian beach. As concerns for refugees and Aboriginal Australians escalate in the face of undeniable facts, the naked truth must displace the lies, denialism and “truthiness” (thanks Stephen Colbert) at which governments excel. Keith & Virginia\n\nIn our ongoing Arts Education feature, you’ll read about media artist George Khut in-residence at the National Portrait Gallery, his take on digital portraiture and his teaching at UNSW Art & Design; while actor and writer Jane Griffiths tells us about music theatre’s great leap forward at Monash University. We pay special tribute to Australian dance artist Philippa Cullen. As a member of Sydney’s exploratory art community from the late 60s until her death in 1975, she vigorously engaged in cross-artform performance and public dance, visited Africa and India, worked with Stockhausen in Europe and, above all, created works in which dancers triggered music via elegantly sculpted theremins. Young artists today might find inspiration in Cullen’s vision and the communal passion with which she pursued it. Keith & Virginia\n\nArts & Education\n\nThe image above is of lecturer Cath McKinnon’s production of Tom Holloway’s Lyrebird, written for and performed by students at the University of Wollongong. In an interview, fellow lecturer Chris Ryan reveals the strange new worlds that UOW Theatre and Performance students will enter on their way to fascinating careers. UNSW senior lecturer Erin Brannigan talks about her Reviewing the Arts course at UNSW, a timely initiative as criteria, standards and platforms undergo radical change. JR Brennan’s The Chat, Andrea James’ Winyanboga Yurringa and Eastern Riverina Arts’ Basin provide this E-dition with exciting evidence of the ongoing inventiveness of Australia’s performance culture. Keith & Virginia\n\nArts Education 2016\n\nWelcome to our annual arts education feature, an informal survey of issues, courses, teachers, works and students over coming weeks. As a prelude, WAAPA’s Jonathan Marshall reports on the 2016 Performance Studies International Conference hosted by the University of Melbourne and Rennie McDougall at NYU addresses the complexities of positioning himself as a critic, reflected in Sally Smart’s The Choreography of Cutting (above). In our next E-dition Erin Brannigan describes the workings of her new Reviewing the Arts course at UNSW and Christopher Ryan reflects on the nurturing of performers at the University of Wollongong. Join us in this celebration of the making of a new generation of artists.\n\nAs we sense the world crumbling around us, environmentally and politically, it’s some relief to see artists in the 2016 OzAsia Festival and others appearing here attempting to rebuild through understanding the nature of suffering, nurturing empathy and envisaging new ways of thinking and being. They play with form, media and mood, but speak with a directness that is increasingly evident in the arts in testing times. On the other hand, there’s pleasure to be had from works that disconnect us from the intensifying demands of the everyday, such as the must-see media art works of dancer Hiroaki Umeda, teamLab, Mikuni Yanaihara and Kingsley Ng featured in the 2016 OzAsia Festival. They’re not frivolous, revealing instead the potential for creative responses to the same technologies that produce our assumed reality. Keith & Virginia\n\nChange and transformation are pivotal to this E-dition. In Unseen, performance artist Lauren Simmonds uses illusion to reveal an unseen world behind the everyday, uniting us all. An injury compels circus artist Emma Serjeant to reinvent her practice for a new work, Grace. Actor Raoul Craemer becomes both troubled grandson and fascist grandfather in his play Pigman’s Lament. To duel with his animated self as The Ramayana’s Jatayu, Raghav Handa transforms into Ravana in Mens rea: The Shifter’s Intent. On seeing Ranters’ Come Away with Me to the End of the World and Anni and Maude Davey’s Retro Futurismus, John Bailey reflects on how we render others, the past and future as eccentric. PACT, Sydney’s Centre for Emerging Artists, runs programs that turn eager young practitioners into confident artists, but Australia Council defunding threatens to defuse that transformative power. Director Katrina Douglas and supporters are determined to push on: continuity is the foundation for transformation. Keith & Virginia\n\nIt’s a painful time. The LNP won the election, narrowly. Artists lost, enormously. But the sector and supporters fought hard, creating a unanimity of purpose with which to hold governments to account from now on. Students and staff at Sydney College of the Arts are hurting with the announcement of their college’s absorption into UNSW Art & Design. They’re fighting it, transforming pain into action. Suffering and its management are directly addressed in this E-dition in a Virtual Reality experience created by Eugenie Lee which simulates chronic pain (image above) and in an Irish dance work about angst wrought by separation. Other works reviewed look back to the arts politics of the 20th century (Colin Bright Syzygy Band and Julian Rosefeldt’s Manifesto) for inspiration and a sense of continuity while the Manifesta 11 biennale treats its host city, Zurich, as a socio-political art site and Terrapin Puppet Theatre and playwright Angela Betzien tackle a dysfunctional future with the ancient arts of clowning, tale-telling and puppetry. In Croatia, Jana Perkovic experiences intimate, deeply engaging performances that resolve in joy. Where there’s art, there’s hope. Keith & Virginia\n\nIn her review of the Sydney Film Festival’s Virtual Reality program, Lauren Carroll Harris encounters a work about incipient blindness which is at once wonderfully immersive and deeply empathic. We turn to art for the sustenance with which to understand and face reality, or to evade it. We often do both at once, finding in art a refuge from which we can reflect on painful reality at a distance. In Britain, a Prime Minister, in appeasing the right-wing of his party, has made real the rank nationalism, xenophobia and racism of Brexit. Artists will suffer, losing access to the EU’s £1.3 billion Creative Europe funding program, to visa-free movement, training programs and the benefits of “the largest export market for the UK's creative industries, totalling 56% of all overseas trade in the sector.” In Australia, we face the harsh reality of the Turnbull Government’s depredation of culture and its cowardly, non-binding, right-wing accommodating gay marriage plebiscite. We hope that the brave art we respond to in this e-dition will provide some solace and strengthen our collective resolve to fight for art beyond the 2016 election. Keith & Virginia\n\nIn his Q&A appearance on Monday night, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull revealed a profound ignorance of his government’s mishandling of arts funding when quizzed by singer Katie Noonan. He insisted that the Australia Council has been better funded under the Abbott-Turnbull Government, that most Catalyst Funding went to regional arts (37% in fact) and used Geelong’s Back to Back Theatre (he clearly didn't know who they were) as an example of a regional company that might not otherwise have been funded had it not been assisted by Catalyst. Browse Catalyst funding results and you’ll see familiar names of organisations usually funded by the Australia Council, some now additionally advantaged, while some larger players have taken the opportunity to source funds that were once the province of the small to medium sector which now faces a bleak future. Former Arts Minister George Brandis envisaged a broader and more competitive funding model; instead, he and his successor have catalysed an aberration: brutal, chaotic and divisive. Make your vote count, but not for an out of touch, uncaring Turnbull. Keith & Virginia\n\nReality takes a hit. Vancouver’s Fight with a Stick immerses its audience in the immensity of non-human “vibrant matter.” Chunky Move’s Anouk van Dijk teasingly tests the real/virtual borderline. Cassandra Tytler’s I’m Sorry subjects the gallery-goer to the rantings of a domestic violence perpetrator as performed by the artist. Yirra Yaakin (image above) conjures the ghosts of rebels who lost their heads to a colonialism that haunts us still. Meanwhile we’re spooked by Arts Minister Mitch Fifleld, a smooth decimator of arts ”jobs and growth.” Only the electoral defeat of the Turnbull Government on 2 July will deliver arts jobs and growth—freed of ministerial manipulation.\n\nEDITORIAL\n\nClick on the image above to read about the June 8 Artspeak National Arts Election Debate, growing arts industry unanimity against the Government over its treatment of artists, and the June 17th Arts Action Day. Neither the future of Australia’s Indigenous peoples nor the environment yet figure in the election campaign. In this E-dition reviews of political visual arts exhibitions and documentary filmmaking (image above from Kelrick Martin’s Prison Songs) keep us mindful of this, but art is busy now protecting itself too from government.\n\nThe appalling news of the defunding of Australia’s premiere national festival for emerging artists—alongside other crucially innovative organisations—did not prevent Next Wave Festival from excelling nor dimmed its spirits. It played to full houses, delighting audiences and triggering invaluable conversations about mutating artforms and key cultural issues. With five emerging arts writers and mentors Andrew Fuhrmann and Jana Perkovic in our DanceWrite workshop, we experienced the pleasures and provocations Next Wave engenders, all working day and night for each participant to produce a set of reviews. This involved intensive group discussions, shared reading and close editing. We thank our participants and mentors for their energy, commitment and company, and Hannah Matthews of Sharing Space for inviting RealTime and Next Wave to collaborate on this venture.\n\nThe 2016 Next Wave Festival is underway. Jane Howard reviews eight of its opening productions. We’ll be responding to more performances, visual arts shows and the festival’s dance program with reviews by RealTime’s DanceWrite workshop participants. To date it’s been a dancing year for RealTime, and for good reason, given the choreographic focus of Stephanie Rosenthal’s Biennale of Sydney and the remarkably diverse dance works we’ve reviewed in Hobart, regional Tasmania, Campbelltown, Townsville, Perth, Adelaide, Vancouver and New York. The Keir Choreographic Award has provoked even greater debate the second time around, with a valuable focus on the criteria for selection and judgment and what these indicate about the nature of contemporary dance. We also report on PROPELLED in Newcastle, a much smaller but significant program supporting emerging artists and also, like the Keir, with a focus on interdisciplinarity.\n\nAUSTRALIANS, END THE INCARCERATION OF ASYLUM SEEKERS. End sickness, mental illness, self- and sexual abuse. End suicide, torture, manslaughter and murder. End hopelessness. AUSTRALIANS, ADMIT RESPONSIBILITY. For first making war on Iraq. For creating refugees, denying them basic human rights, treating them as criminals. AUSTRALIANS, END ‘THE PACIFIC SOLUTION.’ It is no solution. Move beyond compassion. Exercise imagination, strategise and act. AUSTRALIANS, CLOSE OFFSHORE DETENTION CENTRES. Respect the rights of refugees. Bring them to Australia. Invite those whose claims have been processed to live and work among us. Treat other asylum seekers rapidly with new, humane processing. AUSTRALIANS, END THIS REFUGEE HELL OF OUR MAKING. THIS HELL WE TOO INHABIT, WITH GUILT AND SHAME FOR THE HURT WE DO. Keith & Virginia\n\nChildren and young people are at the centre of this E-dition. Triggered by research into the negative effects of electronic tools on the bodies and minds of children, Dancenorth transforms confined digital manipulation into vivid, expansive physical play. At London’s Tate Modern the young, and adults too, dig into the history of live art by recreating seminal works. In Stephen Page’s feature film Spear, a young man seeks reconciliation with his own culture by finding a place in men’s business. Margot Nash’s The Silences, a beautifully crafted film memoir, returns the filmmaker to her childhood to grapple with her fraught relationship with her mother.\n\nIn this e-dition, Nikki Heywood and Rennie McDougall, both writers and performers, find their states of being altered by idiosyncratic dance works. McDougall’s patience is tested as he struggles to engage with a performance by NY dancer Heather Kravas, acknowledging the challenge to reviewing that the work presents and the complexity with which its theme, “Women are not objects,” is realised. Heywood watches naked Australian dancers working with French choreographer Xavier Le Roy become animals and plants, their gaze implicating and reorienting the audience. Digital art, with VR now back in the picture, can reconfigure our perceptions, but so can dancers performing in unadorned spaces. Keith & Virginia\n\nSoon after the revelatory Victory Over the Sun, the 20th Biennale of Sydney produced another striking performance, Manger, a profoundly visceral work featuring Musée de la danse, from Rennes in France, in a one-off performance. The Biennale’s keynote address was delivered by the company’s director, choreographer Boris Charmatz, an apparently unusual choice but one in tune with the Biennale Artistic Director Stephanie Rosenthal’s passion for bringing ephemeral works into the art museum, if from a very different position and raising critical questions about current threats to public space. In another foray into motivation and vision, RealTime presents a substantial interview with Phillip Keir, founder of the Keir Choreographic Award and an artist who turned to publishing the Australian Rolling Stone magazine for 20 years before returning to the arts as a benefactor. Also in this edition, Philip Brophy takes glorious exception to Lady Gaga’s 'tribute' to David Bowie at the 2016 Grammys. Keith & Virginia\n\nThe promotional image heading this week’s E-dition is from Amrita Hepi (Bundjalung NSW/Ngapuhi NZ) and Jahra Wasasala’s (NZ) Passing, a collaboration in hip hop and contemporary dance with costumes styled by installation artist Honey Long. Passing “maps two bodies under pressure from the responsibility that comes from being of mixed cultural background,” and is one of a number of works in 2016 Next Wave featuring Indigenous artists in a program rich in diverse forms and invention.\n\nCome with us. Follow this train track deep into a world at once familiar but rendered anew by leading Australian video artist Daniel Crooks in his new work, the installation Phantom Ride. The artist has generously prepared a selection of excerpts for RealTime readers around Australia and beyond—just enough in which to immerse yourself, and if you’re in Melbourne, to take you to ACMI where the work is showing. Also this week, our final reports from the Adelaide Festival, focused on adventurous music and provocative dance, and Melbourne’s Festival of Live Art in which remarkably diverse works co-inhabit the ‘live art’ realm, some perhaps contestably, but all revealing the increasing number of ways artists are engaging with audiences. On the Gold Coast video works by performance art duo Clark Beaumont comprise an immersive installation and, on the south-eastern NSW coast, participants of differing abilities have collaborated to realise Hyperreal Tales, a five-screen video installation that reflects their lives and dreams. We’re taking an Easter break and will be back with you on 6 April, ready, with an election likely looming, to take the Abbott-Turnbull Government to task for its destructive mishandling and manipulation of the arts and artists’ lives. Make sure you read the ArtsPeak letter sent to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull this week.\n\nIn these un-nuanced times, we desperately need to pay attention to the lives of others or submit to our undoing at the hands of heartless neo-liberals, wildcard demagogues and more and more dictators. There’s a lot, explicitly and implicitly, about empathy in this edition, about going beyond sympathy to understanding. It’s explicit in works like A Mile in My Shoes at the empathy-themed Perth International Arts Festival. Sometimes we need to be displaced or disoriented to come to understanding: No Guts, No Heart, No Glory places its audience in a Perth gym to hear British Muslim women boxers tell how the sport gives them strength and meaning. In Romaine Moreton and Alana Valentine’s One Billion Beats, our understanding of an individual Aboriginal life is radically juxtaposed with excerpts from 100 years of Australian film and 150 years and more of pseudo-science that have long crippled our sense of empathy. There’s much more in this edition about art that encourages our attentiveness to each other, the world and, not least, how we react to an astonishing variety of art experiences in a time of great mutability.\n\nThis week we go regional, to Albury’s wonderful, new media rich MAMA and to a new work featuring Circa inspired by a Wollongong undergoing transformation. We guide you through the dance-led performance terrain of the 20th Biennale of Sydney, applaud musician Adam Simmons’ fusion of durational performance and research, query the high standing of Sue Brooks’ Looking for Grace, and feel the power of Romeo Castelluci’s Go Down, Moses in Ben Brooker’s report from the Adelaide Festival. Can Malcolm Turnbull do a David Cameron and seize the upper and lower houses of Parliament, even if he has to conduct a double dissolution to pull it off? What he might not anticipate is the steadily accumulating anger of artists, many already cheated of their futures by the George Brandis funding heist and Mitch Fifield’s favouring, with the plunder, of a commercial business in the first Catalyst round. The first challenge of the year to this policy-free disgrace has come from ANU’s Sasha Grishin and, rightly, is directed at the Prime Minister. It’s just the beginning.\n\nListen up! In a world of encroaching noise, of forest felling, the grind of failed mining ventures, of wars and demagoguery, sound art can take us into places of mindful attentiveness to the environment. Sound artist Philip Samartzis heads this E-dition with his engrossing account of a visit to Antarctica. You can hear some of the sounds he recorded. We’ve also provided links to other polar artistic ventures, should you feel tempted to explore. Sounds are precious, especially those of challenged environments; but so are instruments with which humans make sound, not least a generation of analogue synthesisers. Rapid technological progress constantly banishes equipment to the rubbish tip and diminishes the arts archive by leaving many works unplayable. However, sound artists Robin Fox and Byron J Scullin are keeping a huge collection of such machines alive and available, preserving the past and opening up sonic possibilities for the future of Australian art.\n\nSeeking depth? Come with us into Spanish-Australian artist Dani Marti’s visceral exploration of objects and bodies; South African artist William Kentridge’s collaged excavation of Modernism’s big hits; Montreal choreographer Daniel Léveillé’s dig into the histories and possibilities of the dance duet; Charlie Kaufman’s in-depth animated account of a failure to sustain intimacy; and works in the PuSh Festival that demand and reward deep attentiveness. Images and video links, with which you can gain some further sense of these works, accompany a number of our writers’ evocative reports. Dig in. Virginia & Keith\n\nGet knotted! And enjoy it in the hands-on bondage performance of BUNNY. Or immerse yourself in the luscious entwinings of Dani Marti’s art at the Perth International Arts Festival. Or, yell it at the Australian Government for their cruel mishandling of the refugee crisis, the non-debate they’ve engineered on tax reform and Arts Minister Mitch Fifield’s Catalyst outcomes, revealed to be nothing more than the kind of work the Australia Council already funds.\n\nRT Profiler 5\n\nIf Winter is getting you down, the waft of jasmine and arts festivals in the air should remind you Spring is on its way. In Profiler 5 we get the run down on both the Melbourne and Darwin Festivals from their dynamic directors and so much more.\n\nrealtime traveller: glasgow, scotland, uk\n\nrobert walton\n\n\"I cringe at using “cultural” as Scotland is so caught up in its own distinctiveness from England and its proud history (and there’s lots to be proud of) that everything can become a little tartan-tinted.
