        "text": "A devoted fan of opera, he was attending a concert in Carnegie Hall in 1958, where the audience was eagerly waiting for the great Swedish tenor Jussi Björling to sing his signature aria \"Nessun dorma\" from the opera Turandot, but it wasn't happening. Then a clarion voice rang out in the audience, \"Nessun dorma!\" Millions of the concert recordings were sold, but who was that audacious young man? It was in fact a young actor already making his name on the stage, Jon Cypher.\n\nBoth his first and his last credits, as listed on this site, were as the Prince in productions of Cinderella."
