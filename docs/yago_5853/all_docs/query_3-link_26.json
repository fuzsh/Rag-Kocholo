        "text": "Gerry Black\n\nGerry took up acting when a voice coach suggested he had potential. This lead him eventual to a number of Shakespearian roles. He also had some success in the world of advertising commercials, an area where he is still active today.\n\nAs well as appearing on TV in shows like Starsky and Hutch, NYPD Blue, ER and The King of Queens, he is also credited with several movies.\n\nDet Alf Chesley\n\nPromoted to Lieutenant in the second series at Goldblume's expense, he is credited with 13 episodes mostly in the first season.\n\nA very powerful actor with a gaze that holds you until he has said his line.\n\nTaurean Blaque\n\nIt seems very odd that this excellent actor has never made the 'big time'. After HSB Taurean has been in the odd movie and has had supporting parts in TV series.\n\nHe is also active in the world of Theatre, but somehow has not yet had the big star role his talent deserves.\n\nDet. Neal Washington\n\nPlayed so brilliantly the partner and friend to J.D. LaRue. A 'cool dude' and a joker, who could chew on a sliver of wood for hours. and was nearly always right about things.\n\nHowever when he shoots an innocent man, he has a hard time adjusting to it, showing his sensitive side.\n\nRobert Clohessy\n\nHis career really started with Hill Street, having done little before apart from fight in the 1975 Golden Gloves in Madison Square Garden.\n\nSince then he has been working almost non stop, appearing in a number of popular TV shows and movies\n\nOfficer Patrick Flaherty\n\nBrought in for the last series as a new partner for Sgt. Lucille Bates, after Joe's death.\n\nGrace Gardner returns to the Hill as Sister Chastity, she eventual gives in to his undoubted charm and tries to seduce him.\n\nMichael Conrad\n\nMichael won two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Support Actor, for his short time in this role. He died from cancer in November 1983, aged just 58. It was his request that when writing him out the show, it would be said he had died of a heart attack during sex with Grace Gardner.\n\nIt was thought his role could not be filled by anyone and so a new duty Sergeant (Sgt. Jablonski), was cast to take his place and did a good job in his own style.\n\nSgt. Phil (Freemason) Esterhaus\n\nHis 'roll call' was usually the start of each episode. He was one of the most loved characters and his catch phrase was \"Let's be careful out there\" has endured down the years\n\nIf you want to see the first time he said it go here\n\nJon Cypher\n\nBorn in New York and a live long Opera lover Jon stared acting in 1956 and had roles in Knots Landings and Dynasty, before joining HSB.\n\nHe is also well known as his role's in Major Dad and Santa Barbara and was in the Movie Masters of the Universe, Murder She Wrote, Tour of Duty and Walker Texas Ranger.\n\nChief Fletcher P. Daniels.\n\nThe role of Chief of Police was one that Jon made his own A pompous self-opinionated man, but he was also going to be one of life's survivors.\n\nThroughout his time as Furillo's boss, he made the man's job so much tougher with his ability to listen intently to what Furillo has to say and then completely ignoring it.\n\nRene Enriquez\n\nNicaraguan-born Rene first started acting in the sixties appearing in NYPD and first played a Lieutenant in the TV series Police Women and reappeared it as different characters in later years.\n\nAfter HSB he appeared in a couple more TV series bur sadly passed away in March 1990 the same year as Kiel Martin\n\nCapt. Ray Calletano\n\nA fiery 'Latino' Lieutenant he often crossed swords with his colleagues, but never fell out with them. He later became a police captain. One of the highlights of the series is when he serves at work, some tea sent by a relative, that was mixed with marijuana. As a result most of the station gets high\n\nDennis Franz\n\nDennis Franz Schlachta known professionally as Dennis Franz, was popular with Steven Bochco and later worked again with him and fellow HSB actor Caruso in NYPD Blue, after Caruso moved on many said he made the show his own.\n\nHe also turned his hand to Writing, Producing and in recent years House Design.\n\nDet. Sal Benedetto & Lt. Norman Buntz\n\nDennis played Sal Benedetto, in the first series. He was written out of the program, but later returned playing Lt. Buntz (and we all pretended not to notice).\n\nThe character of Norman Buntz was kept alive after Hill Street stopped, in the short-lived spin-off Beverly Hills Buntz (1987/8) in which Buntz becomes a Private Eye\n\nCharles Haid\n\nStill acting, but also producing and directing TV Drama, including episodes of NYPD Blue. Charles was originally just a 'guest star' in the pilot, as a favour for his friend Steven Bochco. He has shot a pilot for a proposed NBC hospital dramatic series, but this was never picked up NBC. So he asked Bochco if his character could be resurrected and made into a regular in the series.\n\nHe was booked for one episode but the executives at NBC had seen the strong connection with his partner Michael Warren and decided there was a future for the Hill and Renko team.\n\nOfficer Andy Renko\n\nThe tough 'red neck' officer sometimes lets his temper get him into trouble. Quick to judge a situation, he often got it wrong, but underneath the tough exterior was a gentle and caring man.\n\nHis relationship with partner Bobby Hill was explored throughout the series and his catch phrase was \"Lordy, Bobby Hill\"\n\nDan G Hedaya\n\nDan quickly established himself as a supporting actor, often playing sleazy villain and was so perfectly cast to play the sleazy 'bent cop' Macafee. He went on to appear in a huge number of productions on both the big and little screen as well as stage.\n\nHe even had the 'honour' of being Carla's husband in Cheers and Richard Nixon the former president for the film Dick\n\nDet Sgt Ralph Macafee\n\nWhat us English call a 'Bent Copper' (corrupt) who causes Furillo much aggravation, but finally is brought down.\n\nHe also sneaked back three years later for a single episode, to play a bum that is involved in a fight with Belker.\n\nRobert Hirschfeld\n\nAfter Hill Street. Robert appeared in several TV series including Law & Order and the Sopranos. He was also a published Food Critic. Sadly he passed away in December, 2009.\n\nRobert's Widow Nancy has been a great supporter of this website. This is a brief quote from a friend of his that says a lot about him: \"Amazing guy, always the smartest in the room with a heart of gold.\"\n\nStation Officer Leo Schnitz\n\nFor 80 plus episodes Robert Brilliantly 'under played' the lovable Leo Schnitz (the man that somehow keeps the station house working from crises to crises ).\n\nFor a short while there was romance in the air, between Desk Officer Natalie Deroy (Ellen Blake) who brought a sparkle into his life. It also brought a sparkle to the series, with viewers wondering if the bashful pair would get together.\n\nPeter Jurasik\n\nPeter is a American character actor, who in his own words has played \"a number of fruits and nuts\" throughout his acting career.\n\nLike so many others he also turned up in Bochco's LA Law and NYPD Blue, but his most famous other role was as Londo Mollari in Babylon 5. He also stared in the short lived series Beverly Hills Buntz with Dennis Franz.\n\nSidney (The Snitch) Thurston\n\nLt. Norman Buntz's top informant and sometimes friend. Famously said \"I am a snitch .... it's what I do\"\n\nWhen Buntz eventually hits Chief Daniels he is fired and with Sid as his partner they go to LA and set up as Private Investigators in the short lived series Beverly Hills Buntz\n\nVincent Lucchesi\n\nVincent big break was HSB having started acting some five years earlier. He appeared in 15 episodes in total and later had parts in Cheers, The Incredible Hulk, Night Court and the movie Blue Collar.\n\nIn 1973 he had married Dean Martin's daughter Claudia Martin, but it only lasted a year. Claudia was previously married to Kiel Martin (LaRue) and had a son by him.\n\nCapt. Jerry Fuchs\n\nFriend and confidant to Capt. Frank Furillo from Midtown Vice and Special Narcotics which was later learn is corrupt and out of control. When he learns it is to be shut down Fuchs quits rather than be fired leaving to set up his own private investigation firm.\n\nFuchs latter attempts to kill Mayor Cleveland and then suffers a heart attack while trying to escape\n\nEd Marinaro\n\n'Big' Ed was a former Minnesota Vikings Running Back before going into Television.\n\nHe was only supposed to last four episodes before perishing, but his chemistry with Betty Thomas allowed him to last five seasons.\n\nHe went on to appear in Falcon Crest, Dynasty and Monk.\n\nOfficer Joe Coffey\n\nJoe a Vietnam veteran,was often teamed with Lucille Bates and their love-hate friendship sometimes threatened to get in the way of the job, but never did.\n\nDuring the series we find out he is a compulsive gambler and he finally loses his life when he stumbles on a robbery. He was also meant to die earlier on in the series, but it was change to a serious injury, because the relationship worked so well with Bates.\n\nKiel Martin\n\nIt has been said he did not act in HSB, just played himself. It is true that just like JD, Kiel was a recovering alcoholic and he was married 3 times (including to Dean Martins daughter Claudia), but they all ended in divorce after a couple of years.\n\nHe had been a stand-up comedian, dockworker and musician before acting. He sadly died in 1990 of lung cancer, aged just 46 and was working to the end.\n\nDet. Johnny (J.D.) LaRue\n\nKiel brilliantly played, the recovering alcoholic 'JD'. What many did not know at the time, was that he was in his real life as well.\n\nNicknamed 'Lover' by his partner Washington, because that was how he saw himself (although the ladies did not always agree). A regular practical joker especially when the target is Howard Hunter, somehow he is the only officer to be able to aim insults and abuse at Belker and get away with it!\n\nGary Miller\n\nFirst TV role was playing Rick in Family Affair and he only seems to have had a few other roles including three different characters in JAG and some early comedy roles. If anyone knows more please email in.\n\nHe appeared in 30+ episodes, but was not always credited for some reason!\n\nOfficer Ballantine\n\nHe rarely has much to say except in response to his commander Lt. Hunter's orders or theories. This however, leads to him harbour deep resentment toward Lt. Hunter.\n\nHoward Hunter is of course completely unaware of this until petty thefts of Howard's property start to happen. Once caught, Ballantine has a complete psychotic break that includes armed hostage-taking.\n\nKen Olin\n\nKen came late to Hill street blues and left before the end to appear in Falcons Crest.\n\nHe will perhaps be best remembered for his staring role between 1987 and 1991 as Michael Steadman, in Thirty-something. He has also Produced and Directed a number of productions\n\nDet. Harry Garibaldi\n\nHarry is a young good looking detective with a gambling addiction, usually paired with the delectable detective Patsy Mayo, with whom he continually flirts.\n\nHe studies at night for a degree in law so he can get away from being a policeman, but ends up heavily in debt to loan sharks and is stabbed to death He was in some 27 episodes over 2 seasons\n\nJames Allen Preston\n\nBeing 6ft 2 inches J A has often ended up cast as a person of authority, like a Judge, Officer and Mayor.\n\nHe has appeared in Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins, A Few Good Men, Air Force One. Dallas, 21 Jump Street and Lois and Clark: the New adventures of Superman, as well as the A Team.\n\nOzzie Cleveland\n\nOzzie meteoric raise to power is chronicled throughout the series At the start he is a Homicide Lieutenant as the president of the Black Officers' Coalition.\n\nHe rises to become Commander and by the end of the fourth series is Mayor. He survives an assassination attempt by the disgraced former Captain Jerry Fuchs.\n\nRobert Prosky\n\nTo replace Michael Conrad was an unenviable task for any actor, but Robert was up to the job. Never trying to be Esterhaus, he filled the gap and slowly found his way into viewers hearts, in his own right.\n\nHe was offered the part of Coach in cheers, but turned it down because of other commitments. He died just short of his 78th birthday in December 2008.\n\nSgt. Stanislaus 'Stan' Jablonski\n\nCharacter actor Robert was brought in to replace the much loved actor Michael Conrad, when he died in 1984.\n\nHe brought his own catchphrase to the show \"Let's do it to them before they do it to us:\" This is used by many people to show how the attitude of police had changed in the eighties.\n\nNick Savage\n\nLittle seems to be documented about Nick's later life, after his 12 episodes in HSB. He certainly 'crops up' playing small parts in series like Matlock, Knight Rider and Hunter, with an amusing scene with his friend Redd Foxx in Sanford where he plays a Krishna devotee. He also appeared in films like Friday the 13th Part III Fright Night and Harlem Nights but seems to have stopped acting in the nineties\n\nJames Logan\n\nBelker's adversary, the bald pickpocket. Week after week he would be caught and booked, usually while Belker is taking a phone call from his mum. Each time he would use a different made up name like 'Curtis Interruptus'. We only find out his real name when he lies dying in Belker's arms and asks him to phone his mum.\n\nJames B Sikking\n\nJames had already had a successful career before his shrewd selection to the cast of HSB, although he would agrees it was this that made him a star and household name. His career continued into his eighties when he appears to have stopped acting in 2012.\n\nHis son Andrew followed him in to acting and worked with Steven Bochco and David Milch, along with other actors from HSB playing a sergeant in NYPD Blue. His portrayal of Lt. Howard Hunter was based on a drill instructor he knew in the military (poor man!).\n\nLt. Howard Hunter\n\nOften the brunt of many jokes Howard a decorated Marine and veteran of the Vietnam War, 'heads up' the EAT (Emergency Action Team) Squad (today a SWAT team) and is always 'up for the fight' (even when there is none).\n\nAs the series develops so does Howard, who always listens to Furillo, even if it does sometimes take a while to agree.\n\nJoe Spano\n\nAn excellent character actor and supporter of this website, he has appeared in many films and TV shows and worked again with Bochco in Murder One and NYPD Blue and has had a recurring role in \"NCIS.\" He is also involved with Children's Charities including Families with Children from China and Half the Sky Foundation. He has two adopted Chinese children. Very active in theatre (helping founded the Berkeley Repertory Theatre), in 2008 he did a one-man show about Buckminster Fuller\n\nLt. Henry Goldblume\n\nHenry is the exact opposite of Howard Hunter. A sensitive and deeply dedicated community affairs officer, he sometimes suffered as much as the victims he was helping. Known for his bow tie and desire not to draw his gun, he is married with 3 children, but his wife divorces him after he is shot. After a brief affair with Fay Furillo, he unexpectedly ends up a rich man when a very sexy mobsterâs wife he was in love with is murdered and leaves him a fortune.\n\nJeffrey Tambor\n\nBorn in 1944 California Jeff has been acting since 1977 and is always at his best when playing off-beat characters like Judge Wichtel, or many of the other rather odd authoritative figures he has played. He also had a recurring role in Bochco's LA Law He has also been involved in a number of productions, as a voice actor and received four Emmy nominations for his performance as Hank Kingsley, on The Larry Sanders Show.\n\nJudge Alan Wachtel\n\nThe bizarre character of Judge Wachtel was expanded through the series, often bring high comedy to the moment (do you remember him in a dress, smoking a pipe conducting a case?).\n\nAs a student he studied law with Joyce Davenport. Appearing at first as an unscrupulous and suspect attorney he becomes a judge and appears to mature.\n\nDaniel J. Travanti\n\nAn almost perfect character part made him a star and Emmy winner, although at times Mr Travanti has given the impression, he does not appreciate what the program did for him (Perhaps one day we will hear from him on the subject), but few can doubt his ability and achievements. He went on to appear in numerous films and TV shows, but seems to enjoy working on the stage more. Recently he has had a reoccurring role in NCIS: Los Angeles.\n\nCapt. Francis Xavier Furillo\n\nThe boss of Hill Street and the guy who held everyone together. Nicknamed Pizza Man by his lover (and later wife) Joyce Davenport. His also a recovering alcoholic and the protÃ©gÃ© of Chief Daniels, with whom he regularly does not agree.\n\nMany people (the webmaster included) will happily admit that when one of life's problems occurred, they would think \"how would Frank handle this?\"\n\nMichael Warren\n\nMichael played basketball at UCLA before becoming an actor. He played on 2 NCAA title teams with Lew Alcindor, later Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, as the star. (Info from Steve Kelman). Inducted into the Pac-10 Men's Basketball Hall of Honour in 2009. He is farther in law to Jessica Alba.\n\nAmazingly he has never received the star billing many feel he deserves although he has appeared in many TV series since HSB! However he has built a new career for himself in Photography and image editing, as can be seen in this video and on Instagram.\n\nOfficer Robert 'Bobby' Hill\n\nPartnered with 'Cowboy' Renko, the two survived a first episode shoot out, by popular demand and went on to become 'mainstays' of the series. A complicated character, he wins $100,000 in the lottery and then loses $30,000 of it gambling!\n\nHis Ball skills were used in the series in a cops verses gang members basketball game, where Bobby takes the would-be game winner only to have a gang member in the crowd shoot the ball off the rim?\n\nBruce Weitz\n\nDespite always being thought of as Belker, Bruce has managed to build a career as the great actor he is. He has had numerous other roles including appearing in Half Past Dead and Deep Impact and is known by a whole new generation as Anthony Zacchara from General Hospital appearing in some 250 episodes. Bruce went to the audition for HSB dressed as he thought the character may dress and behave Once in the room he jumped up on the desk of MTMâs co-founder Grant Tinker and tried to lead him off by the nose. Grant is rumoured to have said âThere's no way we can offer him a job\".\n\nDet. Mick Belker\n\nFor many of us, the 'other' star of the show. Belker is as tough as they get (except where his mum and sister are concerned). Usually undercover, he is a great success because no one would believe he was a policeman. Prone to calling people \"dog breath\" or \"hair bag and occasionally biting people,\n\nHe also had a soft side and was especially fond of large white Alsatians! During the series after a short romance he marries and has a son with Officer Robin Tataglia.\n\nAsst. D.A. Irwin Bernstein\n\nThe incorruptible A.D.A. who refers to himself as\"Mrs. Bernstein's son\". He later becomes part of Furillo's Commission on Corruption.\n\nAlthough on opposite sides Irwin is clearly attracted to Joyce Davenport and even risks a kiss towards the end of the series. Soon after he moves to LA to enter private practice.\n\nDavid Caruso\n\nAlthough he only had a small but recurring part in HSB he played it for all that he could and many people could see he had star potential This would later lead him to work again with Bochco and Franz in NYPD Blue.\n\nThis was of course followed by a string of Film and TV appearances, the latest being of course a ten plus years run in CSI: Miami\n\nTommy Mann\n\nLeader of an Irish street gang called the Shamrocks, Tommy was always as ready to listen as he was to fight, as long as there was something in it for him and the Shamrocks.\n\nHis warm Irish smile could light up any Gang Conference, at least until Martinez realised he was not laughing with you, but at you!\n\nTroy Curvey Jr.\n\nTroy was a solid actor who also turned his hand to directing. He started acting at M.C. Williams High School Drama Department and everyone could see he was a natural he landed his first part aged 24 in Palmerston USA next year he joined the cast on the hill and stayed for four years.\n\nHe also found a regular roll in Rhythm & Blues. He directed Up Against the 8 Ball 2004. Sadly he passed away in 2009 aged just 51\n\nBobby Ellerbee\n\nBobby trained at American Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco. After seven appearances in HSB he has also managed to find the odd acting role in series like Knots Landing and the Fall Guy.\n\nSince 2006 he has been the voice of the Sheriff in Squidbillies (\"an impoverished and dysfunctional family of anthropomorphic, air-breathing, red-neck squids who live in a rural Appalachian community in the state of Georgia\").\n\nAbdul Hussein\n\nLeader of the Blood Gang he attended multiple gang meetings at the Precinct House to negotiate \"turf\" boundaries and truces, in exchange for less police attention.\n\nHe had little love, but a fair amount of respect for his fellow gang leaders\n\nTrinidad Silva\n\nKilled in a car accident aged just 38 July 1988, while making the film 'UHF'. The film was later dedicated to his memory.\n\nMichael Warren adds: Trini had just completed working on a television pilot (Home Free) that I helped create and produce in 1988 for NBC. He was magnificent in it, because he was such a fine actor. I believe Trini, was on the verge of becoming a big star. Fortunately his wife and his son survived the automobile accident.\n\nJesus Martinez\n\nLeader of the Diablos and later to became a lawyer (Ehh, Frankie only in America!) Jesus became a strong ally and friend of Frank, who could see his strengths and understood his position in the gang world.\n\nWatch his first bust up with Frank in The 'Garbage' clip (Ehh! Frankie)."
