        "text": "David Casper, Cuba City, Wisconsin\n\nM.S. dairy production, 1985\n\nPh.D. dairy production, 1989\n\nCurrent Position: Dairy Nutritionist, Furst-McNess, Freeport, Illinois\n\nCasper received his B.S. degree in animal science from the University of Wisconsin-Platteville, and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in dairy production from SDSU. He continued conducting dairy cattle research at SDSU prior to accepting a position as research dairy scientist with USDA-ARS in Beltsville, Maryland, where his research focus was on the energy metabolism of dairy cows. He joined Cargill in 1994 as a dairy innovation development manager conducting research for the development of new products and feeding programs. in 1997, he joined Agri-King, Inc., as a consulting dairy nutritionist and was promoted to director of nutrition in 2003 and vice president of nutrition in 2006 prior to joining SDSU in November 2011. Casper’s research has focused in the areas of forage digestibility; feed additives to improve forage quality and utilization; and feed efficiency. Casper’s background is unique; his initial research training was a combination of basic and applied nutrition and management of dairy cattle. His work at USDA-ARS at Beltsville was top level basic research. This was followed by a career in the feed industry where he was able to analyze and utilize information to help the ultimate end user of research i.e. the dairy producer. Back in academia, he is rapidly developing a sound research and teaching program. During his industry career he was constantly looking at ways to develop products that could help dairy producers. He used sound scientific approaches in developing and testing these products, reporting these results to the scientific public, dairy producers, and industry consultants. He has published more than 35 referred journal articles, 60 abstracts, and numerous popular press articles.\n\nMemberships include the American Dairy Science Association (ADSA), American Society of Animal Science, American Registry of Professional Animal Scientists, and Agricultural Institute of Canada. In 2012 he was the recipient of the Pioneer Hi-Bred Forage award from the American Dairy Science Association. This award recognizes outstanding research and/or educational contributions in the area of forage production, processing, storage, or utilization. Previously he received ADSA’s Richard M. Hoyt Award for the practical application of research to the dairy industry. In 2016 he joined Furst-McNess as technical services leader/nutritionist.\n\nJames Drackley, Tracy, Minnesota\n\nB.S. dairy production, 1981\n\nM.S. dairy production, 1985\n\nCurrent Position: Professor of Animal Sciences and Nutritional Sciences, University of Illinois. Champaign, Illinois\n\nDrackley received his Ph.D. in nutritional physiology from Iowa State University in 1989, and joined the faculty of the University of Illinois in 1989. Drackley's research program centers on nutrition and metabolism of transition cows, metabolism in the liver of ruminant animals, lipid utilization and metabolism in domestic animals, factors affecting fatty acid composition of bovine milk fat, and aspects of calf nutrition and management. Drackley has edited two books and authored one book, three book chapters, 78 scientific articles in refereed journals and over 150 abstracts, technical reports, articles in conference proceedings and popular press articles. He has trained over 20 graduate students.\n\nHe is a member of several professional and honorary societies, including the American Dairy Science Association, American Society of Animal Science, and the American Society of Nutritional Sciences. Dr. Drackley was awarded the 1997 Agway, Inc. Young Scientist Award from the American Dairy Science Association, the 1998 College Award for Excellence in Research from the University of Illinois College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences, the 1998 Young Scholar Award from the American Dairy Science Association Foundation, the 2000 Mitchell Award for Excellence in Graduate Teaching and Research from the Department of Animal Sciences at the University of Illinois, and the 2002 American Feed Industry Award for Excellence in Dairy Cattle Nutrition Research from the American Dairy Science Association. He is the Past-President of the Midwest Branch of the American Dairy Science Association and is active in the affairs of the American Dairy Science Association. Drackley resides in Champaign with his wife, Janelle, and three sons, Patrick, Michael and Andrew.\n\nJohn Gross, Madison, South Dakota\n\nB.S. dairy production and animal husbandry, 1954\n\nCurrent position: Retired Dairy Farmer\n\nJohn graduated from SDSU with a double major in dairy production and animal husbandry in 1954. By this time he had already developed a strong commitment to the dairy industry. This combined with his leadership skills (he was president of the student body at SDSU), loyalty to SDSU, commitment to education and the desire to strive for excellence formed the critical ingredients for pursuing a path of excellence in the profession for the next 50 years.\n\nIn the spirit of his belief, \"Holsteins are the most important part of my life, next to my family.\" John's professional achievements can be demonstrated primarily in his efforts in the breeding and development of the Holstein breed of cows. He accomplished this through his own herd and later as a Holstein Association classifier for 14 years and technical supervisor of classifiers for two years. John has been a member of the South Dakota and National Holstein Association for more than 50 years. He served as president of the State Association and as a director of the National Association. Through these and other activities John has traveled extensively around the world for judging and classifying Holsteins, delivering papers, and marketing embryos and breeding stock. Genetics of a partnership-owned bull have been sold to virtually every country in the world where Holstein cattle exist. His outstanding professional achievements ultimately led to opportunities for service to the state through appointments to the South Dakota Conservation Commission board and the South Dakota Farm Service Agency committee, the latter by the USDA.\n\nHe has supported the dairy and animal science judging teams through funding. These judging teams depend on such funding for their activities. The success of these teams has been well recognized nationally. Most importantly, John funded an embryo transfer program at the Dairy Research and Training Facility at SDSU. This allowed for the training of students in the area of Embryo Transfer as well as to develop high quality dairy animals in the herd. John was also a past member of the SDSU Foundation board. It is also noteworthy that John and his wife have held season tickets for SDSU basketball for the last 30 years and have attended most home games. He has further supported the SDSU athletics program by funding a perpetual athletic scholarship, of which Adam Timmerman (now with the NFL) was a recipient.\n\nKenneth I. Gross, Madison, South Dakota\n\nM.S. dairy production, 1952\n\nCurrent position: Retired Dairyman, Valleyford, Washington\n\nKen grew up on the Gross family farm in South Dakota where his grandpa had brought some of the first Registered Holsteins to the area in 1906. Registered Holsteins and the dairy industry have been part of his life ever since those early years. As a young man he was active in 4-H and FFA, having one of the first 4-H projects in his county and winning a trip to the National 4-H Congress at Chicago in 1939 for his state championship demonstration. He served as state 4-H President in 1940 and in 1941 he was honored by the Holstein Friesian Association of America as the State Champion 4-H Holstein Calf Club boy – similar to the current DJM program.\n\nKen received his B.S in agricultural education in 1948 and M.S. in dairy science in 1952. He was a student body class president, active on the dairy judging teams and involved in numerous other organizations, while working at the college dairy. WWII interrupted his schooling and Ken served in the Army K-9 corps. It was also during the war years that he married Molly (also an SDSU alum), his wife of 61 years. They had met during their freshman year of college. Following college, he taught vo-ag for a year in Parker and then served as director of inspections and later as Extension dairy specialist in South Dakota. In the early 1950's Ken started to dairy on his own and began developing a herd of Registered Holsteins. This small herd was only in operation for a couple of years but left a long term impact through the likes of Whitey K-G Pabst Brule (VG) who has several all state offspring and a grandson in A.I. and Marian K-G Beier Brule (VG) who became a state fat class leader. These, and other animals Ken bred, were the foundation of a herd that became the high BAA herd in the state.\n\nThe family moved to Washington in 1954 when Ken accepted the position of King County Agent. He conducted dairy management, breeding and forage education programs for producers in the area and was responsible for 4-H dairy programs, including working with the Enumclaw Spring Dairy Show volunteers. In 1956 Ken moved to Pullman and became Washington State Extension Dairy Specialist. In that capacity he was responsible for statewide DHIA programs and heavily involved in early efforts to incorporate the Washington State DHIA in 1957. He also developed and conducted numerous educational workshops and publications and judged shows throughout the state.\n\nFrom 1962 through 1967 Ken took a WSU US/AID assignment working in Pakistan helping establish, organize, develop and operate the Department of Agricultural Extension at the West Pakistan Agricultural University. He made many international friends and continued to spread the word about the United States dairy industry.\n\nUpon returning from Pakistan in 1967, Ken became area Extension dairy agent and chairman of the Spokane County Extension Office. While in this role he led the effort to establish the first electronic DHIA testing lab west of the Mississippi. The lab served Northeast and Central Washington and was the model for the statewide lab that followed. He also pioneered the Washington Small Farm Extension Program in 1976 and with the county commissioners established the Spokane County Agricultural Center in 1979. Ken also hosted many international visitors.\n\nThe many projects Ken led for the benefit of others resulted in his being named an Honorary State Farmer by the Washington State FFA in 1976 and receiving the National Agricultural Agents Association Distinguished Service Award in 1982.\n\nUpon retiring from WSU in 1982 Ken and Molly spent another two years in Pakistan with a private consulting firm before retiring to Mica View Farm in Valleyford, WA. On the farm Ken raised Registered Holstein replacement heifers, enjoyed grandchildren and served on several volunteer boards.\n\nIn 2004, Ken and Molly moved into town where they remain active and follow Registered Holsteins through the next generations. Ken is a lifetime member of the Holstein Association USA and an honorary lifetime member of the Inland Empire Holstein Club. He was a buyer at the Carnation dispersal in 2004. In 2005, Ken was inducted to the Washington State Purebred Dairy Cattle Association Hall of Fame. Ken's brother John (1954 graduate) has also been a long-time contributor to the dairy industry. Ken and Molly's son, Randy is the 2005-2006 President of the National Holstein Association and their grandson, Randy Jr. is managing a 3000-cow dairy in Flandreau.\n\nMegan Hickey (Rice), Minco, Oklahoma\n\nB.S. dairy production, 2012\n\nCurrent position: U.S. Quality / Farm Services Manager, a2 Milk Co, Boulder Colorado\n\nMegan Hickey grew up on a dairy farm in Firth, Nebraska, worked at the SDSU dairy farm and plant as a student and began a career in the dairy industry at Prairieland Dairy. After graduating in 2012 with a B.S. in dairy production and dairy manufacturing, Hickey now serves as the U.S Quality / Farm Services Manager for a2MC where she oversees all a2 certified herds in the U.S and monitors a1 quality of milk from farm to table.\n\nHickey’s career with Prairieland began at young age. She knew she would return to the dairy at some point in her career by the time she was a freshman in high school. The opportunity presented itself upon completion of her degrees at South Dakota State. Prairieland purchased a milk bottling plant in 2009. With the expansion of business the herd manager position at the dairy was where she fit. In October, after graduation Hickey was fully responsible for managing the herd and employees at Prairieland. She was also responsible for all internal audits and new product development at Prairieland Foods.\n\nIn 2019, Megan’s husband’s career moved to Oklahoma. She had a previous relationship with a2MC since Prairieland was the first dairy to sell a2 Milk. Hickey worked as a contractor for a2MC for two years before securing a full-time position in 2020. She works with a2 co packers and farmers to procure a2 milk and ensure 100% a2 purity. Hickey has developed systems for whole herd testing, segregating, maintenance and a2 herd growth based on a2 protein results. Hickey works from her home office in Minco, Oklahoma and travels to a2 dairies around the U.S.\n\nW. Lee Kucker, Strandburg, South Dakota\n\nB.S. dairy production, 1965\n\nM.S. dairy production, 1967\n\nCurrent position: Senior Vice President, Morgan Stanley, Modesto, California\n\nAfter graduation in 1965 in dairy production, Lee continued his study at SDSU and completed his M.S. in 1967. While at working on his degree he assisted in coaching the Dairy Cattle Judging Team. Upon completion of his M.S. he moved to Michigan State for his doctorate study in dairy genetics. During his study at MSU he coached the all species judging team that competed at the Royal Winter Fair in Toronto, Canada. His teams won the competition two of the three years he coached the team.\n\nAfter receiving his PhD in 1970 Kucker moved to Columbus, Ohio where he was employed by Select Sires, Inc. as a Sire Analyst in charge of the young sire program. He was responsible for establishing the first progeny testing program through member herds in the seven member organizations at Select Sires. In 1974 Kucker moved to Cary, Illinois and joined Curtiss Breeding Service as Vice President in charge of both dairy and beef sire programs. He travelled extensively and in 1976 he was appointed by USDA/FAO to a task force that negotiated the standards for cattle and semen importation in Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria. He also was a guest speaker at symposia in Brazil and Argentina. In 1977 he headed to California on a private venture—which led to a career change into financial services.\n\nIn 1979 he got his license on the New York Stock Exchange and was employed by Bateman, Eichler, Hill & Richards. He brought Prudential Securities into Modesto, California in 1984, the same year he was awarded his Certified Financial Planner (CFP) designation by the College for Financial Planning. Prudential Securities combined the Modesto office with their Stockton office in 1992, as his client base was in the Oakdale/Modesto area, Lee decided to keep his office in Modesto and he joined the local firm of Shearson-Lehman-Hutton. After several mergers and name changes, that office is now part of the Morgan Stanley organization.\n\nLee is married to Mary Louise Christensen—who calls Dell Rapids home. A graduate of Augustana University, Sioux Falls, she founded her own executive recruiting business in 1984 and works primarily in the wine and food industry in California. They have two children, Heather and Todd and seven grandchildren. Lee and Mary have many outside interests having worked with local pastors in organizing and leading tours to Israel. They have assisted in founding a mission in Kenya and, most recently, have led Civil War tours through the eastern theater. Lee is an avid golfer and has served as president of the Oakdale Golf and Country Club where they have belonged since 1977. The education that was provided at SDSU has played an important role in Lee’s career path. It has opened doors of opportunities that otherwise would have remained closed. Lee states—“I will always be grateful to SDSU, my parents, professors and family that have played such an important role in my life—in addition I give thanks to God for blessing me far beyond anything I could have imagined when I entered SDSU in 1961.”\n\nHenry Lardy, Roslyn, South Dakota\n\nB.S. dairy production, 1939\n\nCurrent position: Retired from University of Wisconsin-Madison, WI as chair of a section of the Enzyme Institute from 1950 to his retirement, and as Vilas Professor of Biological Science since 1966.\n\nHe has had a fruitful career in biochemistry and he has maintained close ties with his Alma Mater.

But he had an interest in animals and intended to pursue a pre-vet degree. However, after taking a dairy science class as an elective, Leedom found his calling. Leedom describes that course — and professor Shirley Seas who taught it — as \"fascinating,\" and he quickly switched his major to dairy science. That was the stepping stone for Leedom's 30-plus year career in dairy manufacturing. He ascended to his first plant manager position at age 25 — just three years after graduating from SDSU's dairy program. Over the years, Leedom progressed to larger dairy plants throughout the region and more responsibility. Today, he is plant superintendant for Dean Foods in Sioux Falls, a national leader in the production of dairy products under the Deans, Land O Lakes and Country Fresh brand names. Of his career achievements, Leedom says, \"This speaks highly of the education that I received from the Dairy Science department at SDSU.\" Leedom credits the hands-on learning opportunities that were available to students as a driving factor in the program's long-standing success. As an example of that, Leedom tells of working in the dairy bar and the freedom that was given to experiment. \"Professor Seas encouraged us to come up with different flavors, as long as we were able to sell what we made,\" Leedom says. One concoction that Leedom was involved with creating was the first-ever batch of cookies and cream flavored ice cream in 1979. Leedom tells, \"I remember it was in the fall of the year and fellow student Joe Van Treeck and I were visiting with Shirley Seas about making different flavors with cookies. Van Treeck and I went down to the Fareway grocery store that was located on Main and Medary and bought all of the Oreo cookies they had on the shelf. Our thinking was that Oreos and milk were good together so they would also be good in ice cream.\" After mixing up their first batch, Leedom describes his first taste of the black and white creation as \"darn good\" — and says cookies and cream is still his favorite ice cream flavor today. A few tweaks were made - including making the cookie chunks smaller and changing the initial name from Oreo ice cream to cookies and cream, but today the flavor is still one of the most popular of the now more than 60-flavors offered by the SDSU Dairy Bar. Leedom is humble about his involvement in the history of this \"invention.\" He says, \"It was never something that I recognized as a personal milestone but rather another typical new development at SDSU for the good of the entire dairy industry.\" Leedom's fondest memories of his SDSU experience were the close-knit relationships among students and faculty. \"We were a small group — a graduating dairy science class at that time was about eight people — so you got to know everyone including the professors quite well. I very much appreciated the close-knit setting and the life-long relationships that were fostered.\" He adds, \"There was a great deal of support by the dairy science faculty and department head to make sure we had the experience needed to go out into the industry. From my perspective SDSU is a school with a lot of great traditions and that commitment to students at SDSU has not changed. It is a tradition that is still being handed down to the next generation of faculty and department heads.\"\n\nTerry Schmitz, Sanborn, Minnesota\n\nB.S. dairy manufacturing, 1989\n\nCurrent Position: Senior Manager, Ecolab, Navasota, Texas\n\nTerry’s first position after graduation was with AMPI in Stephenville, Texas as a production supervisor.
