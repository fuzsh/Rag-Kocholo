        "text": "Beverly Archer (Born July 19, 1948) is an American actress who is perhaps best known for her television roles as Iola Boylen on Mama's Family and as Gunnery Sgt. Alva Bricker on Major Dad.She appeared in other programs such as The Young and the Restless, ALF, and the movie Project ALF, along with many other guest appearances. She also wrote three ALF episodes. She played a thieving teacher in The Brady Bunch Movie, who was caught by Bobby Brady. She also appeared in two episodes of Married... with Children as Miss Hardaway, a sexually repressed librarian and abstinence counselor who is in love with Bud. In addition, she appeared in a 1994 episode of Full House, where she played the role of an unsympathetic SAT test monitor. She made guest appearances on episodes of Grace Under Fire, Family Ties and The Fall Guy. She portrayed Nancy Walker's daughter in The Nancy Walker Show. Aside from acting, Archer wrote episodes for both Mama's Family and ALF. She retired from acting in 2002.\n\nOne of the small screen's most reliable heavies during the 1970s, veteran television actor Gerald McRaney successfully made the daunting shift from bad guy to good guy roles beginning in the early part of the following decade. Best known as the street-smart and elder brother Richard \"Rick\" Simon on the popular 1980s detective drama, \"Simon & Simon\" (CBS, 1981-88), the lovably strict \"Major Dad\" (CBS, 1989-1993), and for his long, successful marriage to actress Delta Burke, this mustachioed TV actor boasted an enviable TV résumé, including \"Promised Land\" (CBS, 1996-99), \"Deadwood\" (HBO, 2004-06) and the hit nuclear drama, \"Jericho\" (CBS, 2006-08). McRaney also enjoyed a big screen success as Liam Neeson's boss, General Morrison, in the action smash \"The A-Team\" (2010). Thirty-plus years into his career, McRaney continued to work on the stage and on screen, a low-key, likable actor respected for his skill and professionalism."
