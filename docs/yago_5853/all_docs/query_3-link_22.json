        "text": "When did you know you wanted to become a professional dancer?\n\nI suppose forever, because each year my family would ask if I wanted to take ballet again and each year I could never imagine life without it. I continued that way until I realized the next step was to pursue a professional career.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite roles you have performed?\n\nIt is so difficult to choose, because every role is unique and special, but if I had to pick five of my favorites they would be Odette/Odile in Ben Stevenson’s Swan Lake, Sylvie’s role in William Forsythe’s In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated, Aurora in Ben Stevenson’s The Sleeping Beauty, the principal pas de deux in Glen Tetley’s Voluntaries, and the third pas de deux in Christopher Wheeldon’s Danse à Grande Vitesse.\n\nDo you have any pre-show rituals?\n\nTwo things: for one, I say a short Hebrew prayer, and usually while the orchestra tunes—this makes me feel connected, to the moment and the music. Two, I read once about how ballerinas from long ago would spit on their ribbons in order to keep them secure, so I will very lightly put my hand to my mouth and then to my ribbons to honor that tradition—it makes me feel connected to those ballerinas who came before me.\n\nBest advice you've ever been given?\n\nIn the midst of all the movement, don’t be afraid to be still on stage. It gives you the opportunity to establish yourself in the space and for the audience to see you. Also, spend time visualizing how you want yourself to look on stage. Creating a mental image is a powerful tool for confidence in the actual movement.\n\nTell us a fun fact about yourself. Something people wouldn't suspect!\n\nI love clocks—I have 9 in my house as of now, although only 5 of them are running. But all of the running ones are 3-5 minutes fast. They keep me guessing!\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about ballet?\n\nIt’s hard to pick one thing! I think one of my favorites is that I get to be part of something so much bigger than myself. Every ballet we do is made up of so many parts. No matter what role I have, I get the privilege of participating in the big picture that the audience then gets to enjoy and react to.\n\nWhat do you enjoy outside of dance?\n\nTraveling! During our weeks off, my husband, fellow company member Joamanuel Velázquez, and I love to go on adventures together. We really enjoy camping and wildlife as well as experiencing new cities. Also, we really cherish the time we get to spend when we visit our families. During work weeks I really love spending time with our Bible study group. And we really cherish the time we spend at home with our newborn daughter.\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about ballet?\n\nThere’s no one favorite thing about it for me, so I will round down to 5. First, the aspect and opportunity for sharing (whether with the audience or fellow dancers), dedication, the endeavor of exploring a different aspect of your persona, the all-around craft inherent in it from rehearsal in the studio to the process on stage, and lastly that it can very often be a sort of conglomeration of all the other art forms in addition to being highly athletic and demanding physically.\n\nTell us about yourself and your career as a dancer.\n\nI started training in Argentina under Sara Rzeszotko, and she has always inspired me. At the age of 14, I moved to the United States to train at Houston Ballet Academy. I trained there for three seasons with Andrew Murphy and Claudio Munoz. In 2015 I went to Orlando Ballet and spent 2 seasons there. I’ve been with TBT since September of 2017.\n\nWhen did you know you wanted to become a professional dancer?\n\nWhen I was 11, I was accepted into the Teatro Colon School. There, I was more exposed to the art form and it made me realize that’s what I wanted to do.\n\nWhat do you believe is necessary to be a great performer?\n\nI believe that in order to be a great performer you have to have an open mind and absorb information like a sponge. We are lucky enough to be surrounded by so many artists with different strengths. I love seeing what makes that particular dancer’s specialty look so effortless, strong, emotional, etc. It’s inspiring!\n\nTell us about yourself and your career as a dancer.\n\nI grew up in the Chicago suburbs and attended the same dance school from when I was 3 to age 18. I dabbled in a few other hobbies growing up, but dance was always my first love—and the only thing I ever stayed seriously committed to. Towards the end of high school, I didn’t feel ready to audition for ballet companies but also didn’t want to give up my dreams of dancing professionally, so I decided to attend college as a dance major to further my training and get my degree at the same time. Those four years in college truly shaped me into the dancer I am today and I joined TBT the summer after I graduated. At first it was a bit intimidating starting my career a few years later than many of my fellow dancers, but now I’m confident that college was the right path for me.\n\nBest advice you've ever been given?\n\nOne of my professors in college, Caleb Mitchell, encouraged me to find a company where I would continue to receive training to keep me improving, instead of being left to figure things out on my own. I’m thankful to have found a place like TBT where I’m challenged both technically and artistically.\n\nWhat do you believe is necessary to be a great performer?\n\nConstant learning! It is wonderful to be able to observe each of the dancers and to nurture ourselves when it comes to contributing something more to our personal dance. Every time we perform a scene we can show the public, even through the same choreography, a different way of feeling our movements and interpretation.\n\nDo you have any pre-show rituals?\n\nI will usually listen to some rap/hip hop music and get in my zone. I will hype myself up to build the energy and confidence I need and possibly go over any lifts or anything I will do with a partner.\n\nBest advice you've ever been given?\n\n“There’s no such thing as can’t; you either don’t want to, or you don’t know how.” – Edward Bayhi, my father. This goes for life and not just ballet. I was always taught by my parents that no matter what happens to us, we never stop pushing to be our best. This principle is the thing that separates good dancers from great dancers.\n\nWhen did you start dancing?\n\nI started dancing at 5 years old and was convinced I was going to be a tap dancer until I earned my first pair of pointe shoes at the age of 11. After my first pointe class I was sold, and my love of ballet continues to this day.\n\nWhen did you know you wanted to become a professional dancer?\n\nI remember, when I was still in my pre-professional training, walking around backstage after a performing the lead in the story ballet, Coppelia, and a mom and her two kids walked up to me. The kids, one boy and one girl, were so excited to tell me about how much they loved the ballet and “could understand the story without anyone talking!” Their mother told me that she had never seen her young kids sit that still for that long and said that she herself felt inspired and moved by the show. I think in that moment, after seeing how excited those kids were, I realized that I wanted to continue making audiences FEEL something human though dance, whether it was joy, or sadness, or simply thought provoking.\n\nTell us a fun fact about yourself. Something people wouldn't suspect!\n\nI have three other siblings and we all danced growing up. My two brothers are actually both dancing with professional companies as well! Also, I really wanted to be the first female professional baseball player when I was young, but I ran the bases on my toes…\n\nWhat do you believe is necessary to be a great performer?\n\nYou need to be able to let go of the outside world, and put yourself in that moment on stage. You need to not only dance beautifully, but to show your heart whether you are portraying a character or just getting the chance to show your true love for dance.\n\nDo you have any pre-show rituals?\n\nBefore I do anything to get ready I make sure I take off all my jewelry and put it in a special little box my mom gave to me. Also, before I go on stage I do an exercise in the wings to help establish my balance.\n\nDo you have any pre-show rituals?\n\nIf I have time, I will do a three minute plank while listening to “Countdown” by Beyoncé. It gets me in the zone and gets me centered before a show. I’ve been doing it for years!\n\nWhat do you believe is necessary to be a great performer?\n\nYou have to know it’s okay to feel ridiculous. Whenever you’re performing a role that requires a lot of acting, you have to go all out, or else the audience won’t fully understand what’s going on. You have to perform so that not just the front row of the audience can see, but also the very top row of the balcony can see.\n\nWhat's the best advice you've ever been given?\n\nOne of my teachers once said to always remember why you started dancing—to remember the joy in ballet and to have fun while dancing. I bring this with me into the studio each day.\n\nTell us a fun fact about yourself. Something people wouldn't suspect!\n\nI love animals of all kinds. At one point, my family and I had a total of 10 pets, including four guinea pigs, three cats, one dog, one bearded dragon, and a bunny.\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about ballet?\n\nI love the sense of accomplishment, personally and amongst my fellow dancers, that comes after putting in all the hard work, dedication, and passion for our craft and our moments on stage. The applause and the backstage cheers after the curtain closes are the best."
