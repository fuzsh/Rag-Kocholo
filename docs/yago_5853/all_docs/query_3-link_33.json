This year’s Festival lineup delivers 186 feature-length films, documentaries and shorts from across the globe, including Oscar submissions from 15 countries.\n\nServing as the official kickoff for Visit Denver’s annual Denver Arts Week, the DFF46 curtain rises Nov. 3 with the Opening Night Red Carpet presentation of American Fiction at the Ellie Caulkins Opera House. Cord Jefferson’s hilarious directorial debut is generating significant awards season buzz and, most recently, was recognized as the People’s Choice Award Winner for Best Film at the Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nThe DFF46 Centerpiece delivers two presentations over two nights. Filmmakers Gelila Bekele and Armani Ortiz bring us Maxine’s Baby: The Tyler Perry Story, presented Nov. 7 at Denver Botanic Gardens.

Jeffrey Wright stars as Monk, a\n\nfrustrated novelist who’s fed up with the establishment profiting from “Black” entertainment that relies on tired and offensive tropes. To prove his point, Monk uses a pen name to write an\n\noutlandish “Black” book of his own, a book that propels him to the heart of hypocrisy and the madness he claims to disdain.\n\nOpening Night /Friday, Nov. 3, 8 p.m., Ellie Caulkins Opera House\n\nCENTERPIECES:\n\nMaxine’s Baby: The Tyler Perry Story\n\nDirected by Gelila Bekele, Armani Ortiz\n\nUSA (2023) 115 min.\n\nWriter, actor, filmmaker, studio head, and media titan, Tyler Perry, is America’s consummate multihyphenate.
