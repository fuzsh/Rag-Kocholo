        "text": "Jerome Kamen is a financial adviser who embezzled from the wealthy Blanchard family and allowed their daughter to die of a drug overdose to cover up his crimes.\n\nBackground[]\n\nKamen was a high-priced financial adviser whose main clients were the wealthy Blanchard family, having been patriarch Ken Blanchard's oldest friend. After Ken died, Kamen became a father figure to his children, Katey and Matthew, managing their trust funds to pay for their education and filling the parent role that their mother Meryl, a cold, self-centered alcoholic, failed to provide them. He also helped them when they got into trouble, such as pulling strings to get Matthew into medical school after he was expelled from his prep school for smoking marijuana. When Katey became addicted to heroin, Kamen repeatedly bailed her out of jail and paid for her stays in rehab clinics, only for her go right back to using again.\n\nWhen Kamen's wife left him, she took a great deal of his assets in the divorce settlement. Desperate for money, he started embezzling from Katie's trust fund, ultimately stealing $375,000. Katie found out about his embezzlement, and threatened to go to the police unless he gave her money for drugs. He quietly paid for her drug habit for a year, recording the withdrawals as money for food and rent. One day, Matthew called Kamen in a panic and said that Katey had overdosed after shooting up with him. Kamen picked her up in a shooting gallery and put the unconscious girl in his car and told Matthew to go home and pretend nothing had happened. When Katey began choking on her own vomit, Kamen did nothing to help her, letting her die to get rid of the one person who could expose his crimes. He then placed her dead body behind a dumpster near a daycare facility.\n\nGuardian[]\n\nWhen Katey's body is found, NYPD Homicide Detectives Lennie Briscoe and Mike Logan investigate her death as a murder after deducing from her expensive clothes and dental work that she was not a run of the mill street junkie. They speak to Meryl, who tells them that she had cut her daughter off financially in an attempt to force her to get clean, but directs them to Kamen, who was still helping her. Kamen tells them that he had been letting her stay in another client's empty apartment and had paid for her to have an abortion but denies having been present when she died. Crime scene technicians eventually discover Katey's vomit in Kamen's car, however, which proves that she was in his car while overdosing. Because he did not take her to a hospital while she was dying, Briscoe and Logan arrest him for manslaughter.\n\nExecutive Assistant District Attorney Jack McCoy and Assistant District Attorney Claire Kincaid's case against Kamen is endangered when the trial judge rules that the contents of his car are inadmissible as evidence. After examining Kamen's financial dealings, however, they discover that he had been stealing from Katey's trust fund and charge him with larceny to give themselves more time to find evidence proving his culpability in Katey's death. They question Matthew, who tells them that Kamen drove away with Katey after her overdose, promising to \"take care of her\". McCoy and Kincaid then raise the charges against Kamen to murder in the second degree."
