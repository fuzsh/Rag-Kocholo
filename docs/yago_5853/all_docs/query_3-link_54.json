MacGillis, whose life completely changed when he met, fell in love with, and married reporter Polly Cooper who had come to interview him for an article critical of the marines. They were opposites: he was orderly, she was not, he was conservative, she was liberal, he was a lifelong bachelor, she had three daughters; however, their undeniable chemistry and the love between lead them to the desire to start a new family life together.\r\n\r\nBut not everything was as easy as it looked! Polly (and her kids from a previous marriage) had to learn how to deal with being a Marine family, while Major MacGillis had to learn how to be a Dad and balance his hectic family life with his even more chaotic career.\r\n\r\nMajor Dad enjoyed a four year run on CBS (1989-1993), before it's cancellation in April of 1993, after it's fourth and final season.\r\n\r\n\r\nCBS Broadcast History\r\nSept 1989 Sun 8:30-9:00 (Premiere) \r\nSept 89-Sept 90 Mon 8:00-8:30\r\nSept 90-Jun 91 Mon 8:30-9:00\r\nJun 91-Jul 91 Mon 8:00-8:30\r\nJul 91-Sept 92 Mon 8:30-9:00\r\nAug 92-Apr 93 Fri 8:30-9:00",
