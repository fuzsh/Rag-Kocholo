Not only with its vast number of affiliates, but also from its powerful flagship station AM 750 in Atlanta, the network gives coverage to Bulldog hoops that is unmatched by any program nationwide.\n\nIMG Sports provides radio network production for more than 30 major college athletic programs in the SEC and other prominent conferences across the United Stats. The network flagship is News/Talk 750 WSB — Atlanta’s 50,000-watt, clear-channel station — which provides coverage with a signal that reaches more than 35 states and Canada. Scott Howard and Chuck Dowdle will again handle the play-by-play and color analyst duties, respectively. Coach Tom Crean can also be heard on weeknights during the season on the Bulldog Hotline, heard over most of the network stations.\n\nSCOTT HOWARD\n\nThe voice of Scott Howard has become synonymous with Georgia sports and in particular, with Bulldog football and basketball. Howard returns for his 28th season behind the microphone at Georgia basketball games. First a color analyst with legendary voice Larry Munson, Howard will be working his 24th season as the Bulldogs’ primary play-by-play announcer.\n\nHoward was the sports director at Athens radio stations WNGC-WGAU for 14 years before joining IMG Sports in 2009.\n\nA 1984 Georgia graduate, Howard began his association with Bulldog football as a color analyst alongside Munson in 1994. In 2007, he broadcasted play-by-play action in all of Georgia’s road football games, and the next season he became the program’s primary radio voice by the third game. Howard was also play-by-play announcer for Georgia baseball from 1990-96.\n\nCHUCK DOWDLE\n\nNative Atlantan Chuck Dowdle, one of the most prominent figures in the Atlanta sports scene, will return to the Georgia Bulldog Radio Network for the his 11th season as color analyst for basketball broadcasts.\n\nDowdle retired from WSB-TV in 2009 after 24 years as weeknight sports anchor with the top-rated station. Dowdle also worked for WPLG in Miami from 1973-85. During\n\nScott Howard (right) and Chuck Dowdle will work their 11th season together in 2022-23. that time, he hosted the Don Shula TV Show and also announced football for the Miami Dolphins and the Miami Hurricanes, as well as the NASL’s Ft. Lauderdale Strikers.\n\nDuring his time at WSB, Dowdle was involved with almost every aspect of Atlanta sports, from announcing Falcons’ preseason games to hosting UGA football and basketball coaches’ shows. He was also the host of “High-Q”, a game show pitting some of the Atlanta region’s brightest high-school students against one another in academic competition.\n\nDowdle attended UGA in his freshman year, where he played for the basketball team. He then transferred to Georgia State, where he was a pitcher for the baseball team in his junior and senior years, before graduating in 1972.\n\nADAM GILLESPIE\n\nAfter serving as the back-up producer/ engineer for the Georgia Radio Network last season, Adam Gillespie took over in a fulltime role beginning with the 2020-21 campaign.\n\nAn Athens native who attended high school in Augusta, Gillespie joined the production staff at 680 The Fan in Atlanta in 2005. His role expanded to include producing the postgame show on the Atlanta Braves Network when the stationed the team’s broadcast rights in 2010. That same year, 680 became the official sports-talk partner of Georgia Athletics and Gillespie began producing Bulldog Roundtable, the station’s 30-minute show devoted exclusively to UGA Athletics which airs on Tuesdays and Thursdays.\n\nNETWORK AFFILIATES\n\nMarket Station Signal Albany WALG-AM 1590 Albany WALG-FM 99.3 Athens WRFC-AM 960 Athens WNCG-FM 106.1 Athens WTSH-FM 107.1 Atlanta WSB-AM 750 Atlanta WSBB-FM 95.5 Augusta WGAC AM 580 Augusta WGAC FM 95.1 Bainbridge WGMK-FM 106.3 Brunswick WGIG-AM 1440 Brunswick WHFX-FM 107.7 Calhoun WJTH-AM 900 Calhoun WJTH-FM 101.7 Carrollton WLBB-AM 1330 Carrollton WBTR-FM 92.1 Clarkesville WCHM-AM 1490 Clarkesville WCHM-FM 96.7 Claxton WCLA-AM 1470 Claxton WCLA-FM 93.7 Cleveland WRWH-AM 1350 Cleveland WRWH-FM 93.9 Columbus WBOJ-AM 1270 Columbus WBOJ-FM 102.5 Dalton WBLJ-AM 1230 Douglas WPNG-FM 101.9 Dublin WEDB-FM 98.1 Gainesville WXKT-FM 103.7 Greensboro WULK-FM 94.7 Hartwell WKLY-AM 980 Hartwell WKLY-FM 104.1 Jasper WLJA-FM 101.1 Louisville WPEH-FM 92.1 Macon WXFM-FM 93.1 Milledgeville WKRZ-FM 102.3 Pinehurst WCEH-FM 98.3 Rochelle WWKM-FM 93.1 Sandersville WSNT-FM 99.9 Savannah WSEG-AM 1400 Savannah WSEG-FM 104.3 Statesboro WMCD-FM 106.5 Thomaston WTGA-FM 101.1 Thomasville WPAX-AM 1240 Thomasville WPAX-FM 103.7 Trenton WKWN-AM 1420 Trenton WKWN-FM 101.3 Valdosta WVGA-FM 105.9 Vidalia WTCQ-FM 97.7 Vienna WKTF-AM 1550 Warner Robins WXKO-AM 1150 Warner Robins WXKO-FM 105.9 Waycross WWUF-FM 97.7 Young Harris WJUL-AM 1230 Young Harris WJUL-FM 97.7"
