(Nasdaq: BBGI) (“Beasley” or the “Company”), a multi-platform media company, today announced operating results for the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2023. For further information, the Company has posted a presentation to its website regarding the fourth quarter highlights and accomplishments that management will review on today’s conference call.\n\nSummary of Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results\n\nIn millions, except per share dataThree Months Ended\n\nDecember 31,Twelve Months Ended\n\nDecember 31,2023202220232022Net revenue$65.7$72.0$247.1$256.4Operating income (loss) 17.6(31.7)(82.0)(34.3)Net income (loss) 16.4(24.5)(75.1)(42.1)Net income (loss) per diluted share 1$0.21($0.83)($2.51)($1.43)Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)$4.7$9.9$20.6$25.1\n\n1 Operating income (loss), net income (loss) and net income (loss) per diluted share in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023 include $1.0 million and $99.8 million, respectively, of non-cash impairment losses and a $6.0 million gain from the Overwatch e-sports league franchise fee extinguishment. Operating loss, net loss and net loss per diluted share in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022 include $42.4 million and $52.9 million, respectively, of non-cash impairment losses and a $3.4 million gain on exchange.\n\nNet revenue during the three months ended December 31, 2023 reflects a year-over-year decrease in cyclical political advertising as well as in commercial advertising, related to continued softness in the agency business.\n\nBeasley reported fourth quarter operating income of $7.6 million, an increase of $39.3 million compared to an operating loss of $31.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The year-over-year improvement in fourth quarter 2023 operating income largely reflects a year-over-year decrease in operating expenses and non-cash impairment losses, as well as a $6.0 million gain from the Overwatch e-sports league franchise fee extinguishment, compared to a $3.4 million gain on exchange in the 2022 fourth quarter.\n\nBeasley reported net income of $6.4 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, in the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to a net loss of $24.5 million, or $0.83 per diluted share, in the three months ended December 31, 2022. The year-over-year improvement was primarily attributable to the impact of the aforementioned non-cash impairment losses in the comparable prior year period.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) was $4.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $9.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The year-over-year decrease is primarily attributable to lower net revenue compared to the prior year period.\n\nPlease refer to the “Calculation of Adjusted EBITDA” and “Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA” tables at the end of this release.\n\nCommenting on the financial results, Caroline Beasley, Chief Executive Officer, said, “Beasley’s fourth quarter and full year financial results reflect the impacts of cyclical political revenue and ongoing advertising market softness, partially offset by the continued success of our revenue diversification strategy and cost management initiatives. Net revenues for the 2023 fourth quarter and full year decreased by $6.3 million and $9.3 million, respectively. Excluding the impacts from a decrease in political advertising and the Company’s dispositions of WWWE-AM, WJBR-FM and the Houston Outlaws in 2023 and WWNN-AM and KDWN-AM in 2022, partially offset by the Company’s acquisitions of KXTE-FM and Guarantee Digital in 2022, revenues would have decreased by $0.2 million and $1.3 million in the 2023 fourth quarter and full year, respectively.\n\n“For the 2023 fourth quarter and full year, net income (loss) was $6.4 million and $(75.1) million, respectively. We made meaningful progress throughout the year in lowering our operating expenses and growing our digital, network and other revenue sources, and generated fourth quarter and full year Adjusted EBITDA of $4.7 million and $20.6 million, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA for the 2023 fourth quarter and full year decreased by $5.1 million and $4.5 million, respectively. Excluding the impacts from a decrease in political advertising and the Company’s dispositions of WWWE-AM, WJBR-FM and the Houston Outlaws in 2023 and WWNN-AM and KDWN-AM in 2022, partially offset by the Company’s acquisitions of KXTE-FM and Guarantee Digital in 2022, Adjusted EBITDA would have increased by $0.1 million and $6.0 million in the 2023 fourth quarter and full year, respectively.\n\n“For the better part of the year, we continued to execute on our successful growth agenda for our digital business that capitalizes on the value of our strong local brands, unique local business relationships and proven marketing capabilities. While macroeconomic pressures held fourth quarter digital revenue flat compared to the prior year, Beasley delivered meaningful full-year digital revenue growth, up 11.4% year-over-year. Our digital business represented 18.4% of full year 2023 revenue. We remain laser focused on prioritizing the growth of our digital platform as a means to diversify our revenue in a cash flow positive manner, and we expect digital revenue to account for between 20% and 25% of total revenue in 2024. Our dedicated sales teams also continue to leverage the tremendous audience reach and engagement of our local multi-platform content to attract new advertisers, resulting in fourth quarter and full year new local business revenue growth of 52% and 20%, respectively. Additionally, the actions we have taken to reduce costs drove a year-over-year decline in operating expenses of 3.3% in the fourth quarter and 2.3% for the full year.\n\n“Throughout the year, we further refined our media platform and completed several strategic transactions in order to prioritize investments in key growth areas, with an emphasis on digital. In the fourth quarter, we closed the sale of WJBR-FM in Wilmington to a non-commercial buyer for $5.0 million. Upon the completion of Activision’s sale to Microsoft, the Overwatch e-sports league was discontinued, and our Houston Outlaws team was dissolved. In December, Activision paid Beasley $6.0 million in exchange for the return of our franchise license. As a result, we made the strategic decision to pivot our focus toward higher-margin gaming content creation under our new Outlaws Entertainment brand.\n\n“Consistent with Beasley’s commitment to enhancing financial flexibility and cash flows through debt reduction, we used the proceeds from these transactions, along with cash on hand, to repurchase $20 million of our senior secured notes at a discount. In 2023, we reduced debt by $23.0 million, strengthening our balance sheet and lowering our quarterly interest expense. With the return of the political advertising cycle and expectations for further digital growth in 2024, we intend to continue to opportunistically repurchase our senior secured notes this year.\n\n“In summary, we are proud of the commitment of our teams in delivering exceptional content and services to millions of listeners, advertisers, digital users and sports fans, and remain confident that the actions we are taking to transform our company are laying the foundation for future growth and success. While macroeconomic uncertainty persists, we are cautiously optimistic about our 2024 growth prospects given our solid foundation, including powerful brands, leading audience share, effective strategies, and anticipated strong political spending in the back half of the year.”\n\nConference Call and Webcast Information\n\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast today, February 12, 2024, at 11:00 a.m. ET to discuss its financial results and operations.

See “Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA” for additional information.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA can also be calculated as net revenue less operating and corporate expenses. We define operating expenses as cost of services and selling, general and administrative expenses. Corporate expenses include general and administrative expenses and certain other income and expense items not allocated to the operating segments.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a measure widely used in the media industry. The Company recognizes that because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, it is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. However, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides meaningful information to investors because it is an important measure of how effectively we operate our business and assists investors in comparing our operating performance with that of other media companies. The Company also presents Net revenue, excluding the impacts of political advertising, acquisitions and dispositions, and Adjusted EBITDA, excluding the impacts of political advertising, acquisitions and dispositions, to provide meaningful information to investors regarding how political advertising and acquisition and disposition activity impacted certain key performance measures.\n\nNote Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n\nStatements in this release that are “forward-looking statements” are based upon current expectations and assumptions, and involve certain risks and uncertainties within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
