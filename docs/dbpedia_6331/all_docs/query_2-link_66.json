It is broadcast live on WYBO 92.9 FM in Burke County and surrounding areas and WGAC 95.1 FM/580 AM in the Augusta Area.\n\nThe show is live every Saturday morning from 7:05 to 8 a.m. with multiple current and retired ANR agents as the hosts. Listeners can call the radio station to ask their lawn and garden questions live on the air and the hope is the ANR Agent/host is able to answer the question for you.\n\nCollins said, “My hope is that the citizens of Burke County will use this resource, no matter which ANR agent is the host for that week. To get on the air and ask questions, simply call 706-863-5800 or *580 from the Verizon Wireless Network. Even if you do not have any questions, tune in to the radio station on Saturday Mornings to listen to what others ask, there may be something you learn!”\n\nA few recent questions from callers have been regarding the cicadas, early blight in tomatoes, soil testing, which types of trees to plant in full sun, just to name a few.\n\nFor additional information call the Burke County Extension office at 706-554-2119."
