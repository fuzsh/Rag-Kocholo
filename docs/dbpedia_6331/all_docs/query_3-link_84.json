        "text": "The Naples-based Beasley Broadcast Group, Inc. announced today it will swap five of its stations, in Miami and Philadelphia, for 14 CBS Radio stations in Tampa-St. Petersburg, Charlotte and Philadelphia.\n\nThe swap involved no other cash or other consideration. The Beasley stations to be swapped are WPOW-FM, WKIS-FM, and WQAM-AM in Miami and WXTU-FM and WRDW-FM in Philadelphia.\n\nReturn, Beasley will receive six Tampa area stations, seven in Charlotte and one in Philadelphia.\n\nThe sale is expected to be final in the fourth quarter, pending regulatory approval.\n\nUpon closing, the transaction will increase Beasley's portfolio of stations to 53, including 33 FM and 20 AM stations, in 12 markets with approximately 7.7 million weekly listeners. Today, Beasley owns and operates 44 stations, including 28 FM and 16 AM stations, in 11 markets with approximately 7.1 million weekly listeners."
