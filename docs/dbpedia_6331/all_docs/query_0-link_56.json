Beasley Mezzanine Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Guarantor (Borrower), the lenders listed therein (each individually referred to herein as a Lender and collectively as Lenders) and Bank of Montreal, Chicago Branch, as administrative agent for Lenders (in such capacity, Administrative Agent) have entered into that certain Credit Agreement dated February 27, 2004, as amended by that certain First Amendment to Credit Agreement dated June 18, 2004, that certain Second Amendment to Credit Agreement dated June 27, 2005, that certain Third Amendment to Credit Agreement dated January 30, 2006, that certain Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement dated February 1, 2007, and that certain Fifth Amendment to Credit Agreement dated April 13, 2007 (as it may hereafter be amended, restated, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, being the Credit Agreement; the terms defined therein and not otherwise defined herein being used herein as defined in the Credit Agreement).\n\nB. Borrower may from time to time enter, or may from time to time have entered, into one or more Interest Rate Agreements, currency agreements and other swap agreements (collectively, the Lender Interest Rate Agreements), with one or more Persons that are or were Lenders or Affiliates of a Lender at the time of entry into such agreement (in such capacity, collectively, Interest Rate Exchangers) in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, and it is desired that the obligations of Borrower under the Lender Interest Rate Agreements, including, without limitation, the obligation of Borrower to make payments thereunder in the event of early termination thereof (all such obligations being the Interest Rate Obligations), together with all obligations of Borrower under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, be guarantied hereunder.\n\nC. Guarantor is the sole member of Borrower and thus the Guarantied Obligations (as hereinafter defined) will inure to the benefit of Guarantor (which benefits are hereby acknowledged).\n\nD. Borrower, the Guarantied Party and the Lenders desire to enter into a Sixth Amendment to Credit Agreement (the Sixth Amendment) to effect certain additional amendments to the Credit Agreement, and it is a condition precedent to the Guarantied Party and the Lenders entering into the Sixth Amendment that Borrowers obligations under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents be guarantied by Guarantor.\n\nE. The Guarantied Party and Lenders will not enter into the Sixth Amendment unless and until Guarantor executes and delivers this Guaranty.\n\nF. Guarantor is willing irrevocably and unconditionally to guaranty Borrowers obligations.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, based upon the foregoing and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and in order to induce Lenders and Guarantied Party to enter into the Sixth Amendment and to continue to make Loans and other extensions of credit thereunder and to induce Interest Rate Exchangers to enter into the Lender Interest Rate Agreements, Guarantor hereby agrees as follows:\n\n1. Certain Defined Terms. As used in this Guaranty, the following terms shall have the following meanings unless the context otherwise requires:\n\nBeneficiaries means Guarantied Party, Lenders and any Interest Rate Exchangers.\n\nGuarantied Obligations has the meaning assigned to that term in Section 3.\n\nGuaranty means this Holdings Guaranty as it may be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time.\n\npayment in full, paid in full or any similar term means payment in full of the Guarantied Obligations, including all principal, interest, costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) of Beneficiaries in respect thereof as required under the Loan Documents and the Lender Interest Rate Agreements.\n\n2. Interpretation of Defined Terms. References to Sections and subsections shall be to Sections and subsections, respectively, of this Guaranty unless otherwise specifically provided. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms, conditions and provisions of this Guaranty and the terms, conditions and provisions of the Credit Agreement, the terms, conditions and provisions of the Credit Agreement shall prevail.\n\n3. Guaranty of the Guarantied Obligations. In order to induce Lenders to extend credit to Borrower pursuant to the Credit Agreement and the entry by the Interest Rate Exchangers into the Lender Interest Rate Agreements and subject to the provisions of Section 4, Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guaranties, as primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the due and punctual payment in full of all Guarantied Obligations when the same shall become due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, declaration, acceleration, demand or otherwise (including amounts that would become due but for the operation of the automatic stay under Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)). The term Guarantied Obligations is used herein in its most comprehensive sense and includes:\n\n(a) any and all Obligations of Borrower and any and all Interest Rate Obligations, in each case previously, now or hereafter made, incurred or created, whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, whether due or not due, and however arising under or in connection with the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the Lender Interest Rate Agreements, including those arising under successive borrowing transactions under the Credit Agreement that shall either continue the Obligations of Borrower or from time to time renew them after they have been satisfied and including interest which, but for the filing of a petition in bankruptcy with respect to Borrower, would have accrued on any Guarantied Obligations, whether or not a claim is allowed against Borrower for such interest in the related bankruptcy proceeding; and\n\n(b) those expenses set forth in Section 10 hereof.\n\n4. Limitation on Amount Guarantied; Contribution by Guarantor. Anything contained in this Guaranty to the contrary notwithstanding, if any Fraudulent Transfer Law (as hereinafter defined) is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be applicable to the obligations of Guarantor under this Guaranty, such obligations of Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to a maximum aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render its obligations hereunder subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under Section 548 of Title 11 of the United States Code or any applicable provisions of comparable state law (collectively, the Fraudulent Transfer Laws), in each case after giving effect to all other liabilities of Guarantor, contingent or otherwise, that are relevant under the Fraudulent Transfer Laws (specifically excluding, however, any liabilities of Guarantor (x) in respect\n\n2\n\nof intercompany indebtedness to Borrower or other affiliates of Borrower to the extent that such indebtedness would be discharged in an amount equal to the amount paid by Guarantor hereunder and (y) under any guaranty of Subordinated Indebtedness which guaranty contains a limitation as to maximum amount similar to that set forth in this Section 4, pursuant to which the liability of Guarantor hereunder is included in the liabilities taken into account in determining such maximum amount) and after giving effect as assets to the value (as determined under the applicable provisions of the Fraudulent Transfer Laws) of any rights to subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification or contribution of Guarantor pursuant to applicable law or pursuant to the terms of any agreement.\n\n5. Payment by Guarantor; Application of Payments. Subject to the provisions of Section 4, Guarantor hereby agrees in furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right that any Beneficiary may have at law or in equity against Guarantor by virtue hereof, that upon the failure of Borrower to pay any of the Guarantied Obligations when and as the same shall become due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, declaration, acceleration, demand or otherwise (including amounts that would become due but for the operation of the automatic stay under Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)), Guarantor will, upon demand, promptly pay, or cause to be paid, in cash, to Guarantied Party for the ratable benefit of Beneficiaries, an amount equal to the sum of the unpaid principal amount of all Guarantied Obligations then due as aforesaid, accrued and unpaid interest on such Guarantied Obligations (including interest that, but for the filing of a petition in bankruptcy with respect to Borrower, would have accrued on such Guarantied Obligations, whether or not a claim is allowed against Borrower for such interest in the related bankruptcy proceeding) and all other Guarantied Obligations then due and owing to Beneficiaries as aforesaid. All such payments shall be applied promptly from time to time by Guarantied Party as provided in subsection 2.4C of the Credit Agreement.\n\n6. Liability of Guarantor Absolute. Guarantor agrees that its obligations hereunder are irrevocable, absolute, independent and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance that constitutes a legal or equitable discharge of a guarantor or surety other than payment in full of the Guarantied Obligations. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, Guarantor agrees as follows:\n\n(a) This Guaranty is a guaranty of payment when due and not of collectibility.\n\n(b) Guarantied Party may enforce this Guaranty upon the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default under the Credit Agreement or the occurrence and continuance of an early termination date or similar event under the Lender Interest Rate Agreements notwithstanding the existence of any dispute between Borrower and any Beneficiary with respect to the existence of such Event of Default.\n\n(c) The obligations of Guarantor hereunder are independent of the obligations of Borrower under the Loan Documents or the Lender Interest Rate Agreements and the obligations of any other guarantor (including any of the Subsidiary Guarantors) of the obligations of Borrower under the Loan Documents or the Lender Interest Rate Agreements, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against Guarantor whether or not any action is brought against Borrower or any of such other guarantors and whether or not Borrower is joined in any such action or actions.\n\n(d) Payment by Guarantor of a portion, but not all, of the Guarantied Obligations shall in no way limit, affect, modify or abridge Guarantors liability for any portion of the Guarantied Obligations that has not been paid. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if Guarantied Party is awarded a judgment in any suit brought to enforce Guarantors covenant to pay a portion of the Guarantied Obligations, such judgment shall not be deemed to release Guarantor from its covenant to pay the portion of the Guarantied Obligations that is not the subject of such suit, and such judgment shall not, except to the extent satisfied by Guarantor, limit, affect, modify or abridge Guarantors liability hereunder in respect of the Guarantied Obligations.\n\n3\n\n(e) Any Beneficiary, upon such terms as it deems appropriate, without notice or demand and without affecting the validity or enforceability of this Guaranty or giving rise to any reduction, limitation, impairment, discharge or termination of Guarantors liability hereunder, from time to time may (i) renew, extend, accelerate, increase the rate of interest on, or otherwise change the time, place, manner or terms of payment of the Guarantied Obligations, (ii) settle, compromise, release or discharge, or accept or refuse any offer of performance with respect to, or substitutions for, the Guarantied Obligations or any agreement relating thereto and/or subordinate the payment of the same to the payment of any other obligations; (iii) request and accept other guaranties of the Guarantied Obligations and take and hold security for the payment of this Guaranty or the Guarantied Obligations; (iv) release, surrender, exchange, substitute, compromise, settle, rescind, waive, alter, subordinate or modify, with or without consideration, any security for payment of the Guarantied Obligations, any other guaranties of the Guarantied Obligations, or any other obligation of any Person (including any of the Subsidiary Guarantors) with respect to the Guarantied Obligations; (v) enforce and apply any security now or hereafter held by or for the benefit of such Beneficiary in respect of this Guaranty or the Guarantied Obligations and direct the order or manner of sale thereof, or exercise any other right or remedy that such Beneficiary may have against any such security, in each case consistent with the Credit Agreement or the applicable Lender Interest Rate Agreement and any applicable security agreement, including foreclosure on any such security pursuant to one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, and even though such action operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of Guarantor against Borrower or any security for the Guarantied Obligations; and (vi) exercise any other rights available to it under the Loan Documents or the Lender Interest Rate Agreements.\n\n(f) This Guaranty and the obligations of Guarantor hereunder shall be valid and enforceable and shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment, discharge or termination for any reason (other than payment in full of the Guarantied Obligations), including, without limitation, the occurrence of any of the following, whether or not Guarantor shall have had notice or knowledge of any of them: (i) any failure or omission to assert or enforce or agreement or election not to assert or enforce, or the stay or enjoining, by order of court, by operation of law or otherwise, of the exercise or enforcement of, any claim or demand or any right, power or remedy (whether arising under the Loan Documents or the Lender Interest Rate Agreements, at law, in equity or otherwise) with respect to the Guarantied Obligations or any agreement relating thereto, or with respect to any other guaranty of or security for the payment of the Guarantied Obligations; (ii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any consent to departure from, any of the terms or provisions (including provisions relating to events of default) of the Credit Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents, any of the Lender Interest Rate Agreements or any agreement or instrument executed pursuant thereto, or of any other guaranty or security for the Guarantied Obligations, in each case whether or not in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement or such Loan Document, such Lender Interest Rate Agreement or any agreement relating to such other guaranty or security; (iii) the Guarantied Obligations, or any agreement relating thereto, at any time being found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect; (iv) the application of payments received from any source (other than payments received pursuant to the other Loan Documents or any of the Lender Interest Rate Agreements or from the proceeds of any security for the Guarantied Obligations, except to the extent such security also serves as collateral for indebtedness other than the Guarantied Obligations) to the payment of indebtedness other than the Guarantied Obligations, even though any Beneficiary might have elected to apply such payment to any part or all of the Guarantied Obligations; (v) any Beneficiarys consent to the change, reorganization or termination of the corporate structure or existence of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries and to any corresponding restructuring of the Guarantied Obligations; (vi) any failure to perfect or continue perfection of a security\n\n4\n\ninterest in any collateral that secures any of the Guarantied Obligations; (vii) any defenses, set-offs or counterclaims which Borrower may allege or assert against any Beneficiary in respect of the Guarantied Obligations, including failure of consideration, breach of warranty, statute of frauds, statute of limitations, accord and satisfaction and usury (other than payment in full of the Guarantied Obligations); and (viii) any other act or thing or omission, or delay to do any other act or thing that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of Guarantor as an obligor in respect of the Guarantied Obligations.\n\n7. Waivers by Guarantor. Guarantor hereby waives, for the benefit of Beneficiaries:\n\n(a) any right to require any Beneficiary, as a condition of payment or performance by Guarantor, to (i) proceed against Borrower, any other guarantor (including any of the Subsidiary Guarantors) of the Guarantied Obligations or any other Person, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security held from Borrower, any such other guarantor or any other Person, (iii) proceed against or have resort to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of any Beneficiary in favor of Borrower or any other Person, or (iv) pursue any other remedy in the power of any Beneficiary whatsoever;\n\n(b) any defense arising by reason of the incapacity, lack of authority or any disability or other defense of Borrower including, without limitation, any defense based on or arising out of the lack of validity or the unenforceability of the Guarantied Obligations or any agreement or instrument relating thereto or by reason of the cessation of the liability of Borrower from any cause other than payment in full of the Guarantied Obligations;\n\n(c) any defense based upon any statute or rule of law that provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the principal;\n\n(d) any defense based upon any Beneficiarys errors or omissions in the administration of the Guarantied Obligations, except behavior that amounts to bad faith;\n\n(e) (i) any principles or provisions of law, statutory or otherwise, that are or might be in conflict with the terms of this Guaranty and any legal or equitable discharge of Guarantors obligations hereunder, (ii) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting Guarantors liability hereunder or the enforcement hereof, (iii) any rights to set-offs, recoupments and counterclaims, and (iv) promptness, diligence and any requirement that any Beneficiary protect, secure, perfect or insure any security interest or lien or any property subject thereto;\n\n(f) notices, demands (other than as specifically set forth herein), presentments, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and notices of any action or inaction, including acceptance of this Guaranty, notices of default under the Credit Agreement, the Lender Interest Rate Agreements or any agreement or instrument related thereto, notices of any renewal, extension or modification of the Guarantied Obligations or any agreement related thereto, notices of any extension of credit to Borrower and notices of any of the matters referred to in Section 6 and any right to consent to any thereof; and\n\n(g) to the fullest extent permitted by law, any defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by law that limit the liability of or exonerate guarantors or sureties, or that may conflict with the terms of this Guaranty.\n\n8. Guarantors Rights of Subrogation, Contribution, Etc. Until the Guarantied Obligations shall have been paid in full and the Commitments shall have terminated and all Letters of Credit shall have expired or been cancelled, Guarantor hereby waives any claim, right or remedy, direct or indirect, that Guarantor now has or may hereafter have against Borrower or any of its assets in\n\n5\n\nconnection with this Guaranty or the performance by Guarantor of its obligations hereunder, in each case whether such claim, right or remedy arises in equity, under contract, by statute, under common law or otherwise and including (a) any right of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification that Guarantor now has or may hereafter have against Borrower, (b) any right to enforce, or to participate in, any claim, right or remedy that any Beneficiary now has or may hereafter have against Borrower, and (c) any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any collateral or security now or hereafter held by any Beneficiary. In addition, until the Guarantied Obligations shall have been paid in full and the Commitments shall have terminated and all Letters of Credit shall have expired or been cancelled, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Guarantor shall withhold exercise of any right of contribution Guarantor may have against any other guarantor (including any of the Subsidiary Guarantors) of the Guarantied Obligations. Guarantor further agrees that, to the extent the waiver or agreement to withhold the exercise of its rights of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification and contribution as set forth herein is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void or voidable for any reason, any rights of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification Guarantor may have against Borrower or against any collateral or security, and any rights of contribution Guarantor may have against any such other guarantor, shall be junior and subordinate to any rights any Beneficiary may have against Borrower, to all right, title and interest any Beneficiary may have in any such collateral or security, and to any right any Beneficiary may have against such other guarantor. If any amount shall be paid to Guarantor on account of any such subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification or contribution rights at any time when all Guarantied Obligations shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall be held in trust for Guarantied Party on behalf of Beneficiaries and shall forthwith be paid over to Guarantied Party for the benefit of Beneficiaries to be credited and applied against the Guarantied Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms hereof. NO PERSON SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENT, ANY SUCCESSOR, ASSIGNEE OR THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY OF SUCH PERSON OR ANY OTHER PERSON ASSERTING CLAIMS DERIVATIVELY THROUGH SUCH PARTY, FOR INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHICH MAY BE ALLEGED AS A RESULT OF CREDIT HAVING BEEN EXTENDED, SUSPENDED OR TERMINATED UNDER ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR AS A RESULT OF ANY OTHER TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER OR THEREUNDER.\n\n9. Subordination of Other Obligations. Any indebtedness of Borrower or any other guarantor (including any of the Subsidiary Guarantors) now or hereafter held by Guarantor (the Obligee Guarantor) is hereby subordinated in right of payment to the Guarantied Obligations, and any such indebtedness collected or received by the Obligee Guarantor after an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing shall be held in trust for Guarantied Party on behalf of Beneficiaries and shall forthwith be paid over to Guarantied Party for the benefit of Beneficiaries to be credited and applied against the Guarantied Obligations but without affecting, impairing or limiting in any manner the liability of the Obligee Guarantor under any other provision of this Guaranty.\n\n10. Expenses. Guarantor agrees to pay, or cause to be paid, promptly, and to save Beneficiaries harmless against liability for, (i) any and all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable fees, costs of settlement and disbursements of counsel) incurred or expended by any Beneficiary in connection with the enforcement of or preservation of any rights under this Guaranty, and (ii) any and all costs and expenses (including those arising from rights of indemnification) required to be paid by Guarantor under the provisions of any other Loan Document.\n\n11. Continuing Guaranty. This Guaranty is a continuing guaranty and shall remain in effect until all of the Guarantied Obligations shall have been paid in full and the Commitments shall have terminated and all Letters of Credit shall have expired or been cancelled. Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any right to revoke this Guaranty as to future transactions giving rise to any Guarantied Obligations.\n\n6\n\n12. Authority of Guarantor or Borrower. It is not necessary for any Beneficiary to inquire into the capacity or powers of Guarantor or Borrower or the officers, directors or any agents acting or purporting to act on behalf of any of them.\n\n13. Financial Condition of Borrower. Any Loans may be granted to Borrower or continued from time to time, and any Lender Interest Rate Agreements may be entered into from time to time, in each case without notice to or authorization from Guarantor regardless of the financial or other condition of Borrower at the time of any such grant or continuation or at the time such Lender Interest Rate Agreement is entered into, as the case may be. No Beneficiary shall have any obligation to disclose or discuss with Guarantor its assessment, or Guarantors assessment, of the financial condition of Borrower. Guarantor has adequate means to obtain information from Borrower on a continuing basis concerning the financial condition of Borrower and its ability to perform its obligations under the Loan Documents and the Lender Interest Rate Agreements, and Guarantor assumes the responsibility for being and keeping informed of the financial condition of Borrower and of all circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guarantied Obligations. Guarantor hereby waives and relinquishes any duty on the part of any Beneficiary to disclose any matter, fact or thing relating to the business, operations or conditions of Borrower now known or hereafter known by any Beneficiary.\n\n14. Rights Cumulative. The rights, powers and remedies given to Beneficiaries by this Guaranty are cumulative and shall be in addition to and independent of all rights, powers and remedies given to Beneficiaries by virtue of any statute or rule of law or in any of the other Loan Documents, any of the Lender Interest Rate Agreements or any agreement between Guarantor and any Beneficiary or Beneficiaries or between Borrower and any Beneficiary or Beneficiaries, in each case, relating to this Guaranty. Any forbearance or failure to exercise, and any delay by any Beneficiary in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall not impair any such right, power or remedy or be construed to be a waiver thereof, nor shall it preclude the further exercise of any such right, power or remedy.\n\n15. Bankruptcy; Post-Petition Interest; Reinstatement of Guaranty.\n\n(a) So long as any Guarantied Obligations remain outstanding, Guarantor shall not, without the prior written consent of Guarantied Party acting pursuant to the instructions of Requisite Obligees (as defined in Section 31), commence or join with any other Person in commencing any bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency proceedings of or against Borrower. The obligations of Guarantor under this Guaranty shall not be reduced, limited, impaired, discharged, deferred, suspended or terminated by any proceeding, voluntary or involuntary, involving the bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization, liquidation or arrangement of Borrower or by any defense that Borrower may have by reason of the order, decree or decision of any court or administrative body resulting from any such proceeding.\n\n(b) Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that any interest on any portion of the Guarantied Obligations that accrues after the commencement of any proceeding referred to in subsection (a) of this clause 15 above (or, if interest on any portion of the Guarantied Obligations ceases to accrue by operation of law by reason of the commencement of said proceeding, such interest as would have accrued on such portion of the Guarantied Obligations if said proceedings had not been commenced) shall be included in the Guarantied Obligations, because it is the intention of Guarantor and Beneficiaries that the Guarantied Obligations that are guarantied by Guarantor pursuant to this Guaranty should be determined without regard to any rule of law or order that may relieve Borrower of any portion of such Guarantied Obligations. Guarantor will permit any trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors or similar person to pay Guarantied Party, or allow the claim of Guarantied Party in respect of, any such interest accruing after the date on which such proceeding is commenced.\n\n7\n\n(c) In the event that all or any portion of the Guarantied Obligations are paid by Borrower, the obligations of Guarantor hereunder shall continue and remain in full force and effect or be reinstated, as the case may be, in the event that all or any part of such payment(s) are rescinded or recovered directly or indirectly from any Beneficiary as a preference, fraudulent transfer or otherwise, and any such payments which are so rescinded or recovered shall constitute Guarantied Obligations for all purposes under this Guaranty.\n\n16. Notice of Events. As soon as Guarantor obtains knowledge thereof, Guarantor shall give Guarantied Party written notice of any condition or event that has resulted in (a) a material adverse change in the financial condition of Guarantor, or (b) a breach of or noncompliance with any term, condition or covenant contained herein.\n\n17. Set Off. In addition to any other rights any Beneficiary may have under law or in equity, upon the occurrence and continuance of any Event of Default, if any amount shall at any time be due and owing by Guarantor to any Beneficiary under this Guaranty, such Beneficiary is authorized at any time or from time to time, without notice (any such notice being hereby expressly waived), to set off and to appropriate and to apply any and all deposits (general or special, including, but not limited to, indebtedness evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured but excluding trust accounts) and any other indebtedness of such Beneficiary owing to Guarantor and any other property of Guarantor held or any Beneficiary to or for the credit or the account of Guarantor against and on account of the Guarantied Obligations and liabilities of Guarantor to any Beneficiary under this Guaranty.\n\n18. Intentionally Omitted.\n\n19. Survival of Warranties. All agreements, representations and warranties made herein shall survive the execution and delivery of this Guaranty and the other Loan Documents and the Lender Interest Rate Agreements and any increase in the Commitments under the Credit Agreement.\n\n20.

Waiver of Trial by Jury. GUARANTOR AND, BY ITS ACCEPTANCE OF THE BENEFITS HEREOF, EACH BENEFICIARY HEREBY AGREES TO WAIVE ITS RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS GUARANTY. The scope of this waiver is intended to be all encompassing of any and all disputes that may be filed in any court and that relate to the subject matter of this transaction, including, without limitation, contract claims, tort claims, breach of duty claims and all other common law and statutory claims. Guarantor and, by its acceptance of the benefits hereof, each Beneficiary (i) acknowledges that this waiver is a material inducement for Guarantor and Beneficiaries to enter into a business relationship, that Guarantor and Beneficiaries have already relied on this waiver in entering into this Guaranty or accepting the benefits thereof, as the case may be, and that each will continue to rely on this waiver in their related future dealings and (ii) further warrants and represents that each has reviewed this waiver with its legal counsel, and that each knowingly and voluntarily waives its jury trial rights following consultation with legal counsel. THIS WAIVER IS IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT MAY NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY OR IN WRITING (OTHER THAN BY A MUTUAL WRITTEN WAIVER SPECIFICALLY REFERRING TO THIS SECTION 27 AND EXECUTED BY THE GUARANTIED PARTY AND GUARANTOR), AND THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY\n\n10\n\nSUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS GUARANTY.

Delivery of any executed signature page of this Guaranty by facsimile transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof.\n\n31. Guarantied Party as Administrative Agent.\n\n(a) Guarantied Party has been appointed to act as Guarantied Party hereunder by Lenders and, by their acceptance of the benefits hereof, Interest Rate Exchangers. Guarantied Party shall be obligated, and shall have the right hereunder, to make demands, to give notices, to exercise or refrain from exercising any rights, and to take or refrain from taking any action, solely in accordance with this Guaranty and the Credit Agreement; provided that Guarantied Party shall exercise, or refrain from exercising, any remedies hereunder in accordance with the instructions of (i) Requisite Lenders or (ii) after payment in full of all Obligations under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the holders of a majority of the aggregate notional amount (or, with respect to any Lender Interest Rate Agreement that has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the amount then due and payable (exclusive of expenses and similar payments but including any early termination payments then due) under such Lender Interest Rate Agreement) under all Lender Interest Rate Agreements (Requisite Lenders or, if applicable, such holders being referred to herein as Requisite Obligees). In furtherance of the foregoing provisions of this Section 31, each Interest Rate Exchanger, by its acceptance of the benefits hereof, agrees that it shall have no right individually to enforce this Guaranty, it being understood and agreed by such Interest Rate Exchanger that all rights and remedies hereunder may be exercised solely by Guarantied Party for the benefit of Beneficiaries in accordance with the terms of this Section 31.\n\n(b) Guarantied Party shall at all times be the same Person that is Administrative Agent under the Credit Agreement. Written notice of resignation by Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection 9.5 of the Credit Agreement shall also constitute notice of resignation as Guarantied Party under this Guaranty; and appointment of a successor Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection 9.5 of the Credit Agreement shall also constitute appointment of a successor Guarantied Party under this Guaranty. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent under subsection 9.5 of the Credit Agreement by a successor Administrative Agent, that successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Guarantied Party under this Guaranty, and the retiring or removed Guarantied Party under this Guaranty shall promptly (i) transfer to such successor Guarantied Party all sums held hereunder, together with all records and other documents necessary or appropriate in connection with the performance of the duties of the successor Guarantied Party under this Guaranty, and (ii) take such other actions as may be necessary or appropriate in connection with the assignment to such successor Guarantied Party of the\n\n11\n\nrights created hereunder, whereupon such retiring or removed Guarantied Party shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Guaranty. After any retiring or removed Guarantied Partys resignation or removal hereunder as Guarantied Party, the provisions of this Guaranty shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it under this Guaranty while it was Guarantied Party hereunder.\n\n* * * * *\n\n[THE REMAINDER OF THIS PAGE IS INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK; THE NEXT PAGE IS THE SIGNATURE PAGE]\n\n12\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned Guarantor has caused this Holdings Guaranty to be duly executed as of the day and year first written above."
