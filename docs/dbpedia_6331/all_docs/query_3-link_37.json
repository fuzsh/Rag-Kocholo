(Nasdaq: BBGI) (“Beasley” or the “Company”), a multi-platform media company, today announced operating results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024. For further information, the Company has posted a presentation to its website regarding the first quarter highlights and accomplishments that management will review on today’s conference call.\n\nFirst Quarter Financial Highlights\n\nIn millions, except per share dataThree Months Ended\n\nMarch 31,20242023Net revenue$54.4$57.8Operating income (loss)(1.1)0.4Net income (loss)10.0(3.5)Net income (loss) per diluted share1$0.00($0.12)Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)0.72.6\n\n1 Net income (loss) and net income (loss) per diluted share in the three months ended March 31, 2024 include a $6.0 million gain on sale of an investment in Broadcast Music, Inc.\n\nNet revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased 5.9% to $54.4 million, primarily reflecting a year-over-year decline in audio advertising and other revenue due to Beasley’s Wilmington station and esports divestitures as well as ongoing softness in the commercial advertising business, partially offset by growth in digital and political advertising revenue.\n\nBeasley reported an operating loss of $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to operating income of $0.4 million in the first quarter of 2023, largely reflecting the year-over-year decrease in net revenue.\n\nBeasley reported net income of approximately $8,000, or $0.00 per diluted share, in the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to a net loss of $3.5 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in the three months ended March 31, 2023. The year-over-year improvement was primarily due to the $6.0 million gain on sale of an investment in Broadcast Music, Inc. holdings and lower interest expense.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) was $0.7 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $2.6 million in the first quarter of 2023. The year-over-year decrease is primarily attributable to lower net revenue compared to the prior year period.\n\nPlease refer to the “Calculation of Adjusted EBITDA” and “Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA” tables at the end of this release.\n\nCommenting on the financial results, Caroline Beasley, Chief Executive Officer, said, “Beasley continues to advance our core initiatives, which are focused on driving revenue and cash flow, including our digital transformation, revenue diversification and expense management initiatives. We expect digital to account for between 20% and 25% of total revenue in 2024, driven by the ongoing growth and success of our premium content creation and digital services. On the new business front, our dedicated sales teams are leveraging the tremendous audience reach and engagement of our platform to attract new advertisers.\n\n“In summary, Beasley’s underlying fundamentals—mainly, our local audio and digital platforms and audience engagement—remain strong. We are proud of our teams’ steadfast commitment to delivering exceptional content and services to our listeners, advertisers, online users and sports fans, and remain confident that the actions we are taking to transform our company and strengthen our balance sheet, are laying the foundation for future growth and success.”\n\nFirst Quarter 2024 Highlights\n\nRevenue from new customers grew 53% year over year\n\nGenerated $548,000 in political revenue\n\nLocal revenue, including digital packages sold locally, accounted for 69% of Total Revenue\n\nDigital revenue grew 10% year-over-year, or 20% year-over-year on a same station basis, to $11,000,000\n\nDigital revenue accounted for 20% of total company revenue\n\n38% of our total audience listens via the company’s digital platforms\n\nConference Call and Webcast Information\n\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast today, May 8, 2024, at 11:00 a.m. ET to discuss its financial results and operations.

See “Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA” for additional information.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA can also be calculated as net revenue less operating and corporate expenses. We define operating expenses as cost of services and selling, general and administrative expenses. Corporate expenses include general and administrative expenses and certain other income and expense items not allocated to the operating segments.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a measure widely used in the media industry. The Company recognizes that because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, it is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. However, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides meaningful information to investors because it is an important measure of how effectively we operate our business and assists investors in comparing our operating performance with that of other media companies.\n\nSame station revenue excludes revenue from all divestitures and other operations that were exited in the prior 12 months.\n\nNew business revenue is defined as revenue from an advertiser that has not advertised in the prior 13 months before the start of the current quarter.\n\nNote Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n\nStatements in this release that are “forward-looking statements” are based upon current expectations and assumptions and involve certain risks and uncertainties within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
