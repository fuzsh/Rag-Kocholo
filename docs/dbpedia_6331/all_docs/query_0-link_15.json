The radio veteran previously held the role of Vice President and Market Manager of company’s cluster of radio stations in Augusta, GA. He joined Beasley in 1991 and worked in the Augusta market as general manager and/or market manager from 1993-2014.\n\n“Kent leads by example in everything he does,” said Beasley Media Group Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Brian Beasley. “We look forward to Kent returning to his roots and once again overseeing the cluster and enjoying the similar success he had both in Augusta and Tampa. It’s a privilege to have him on our team.”\n\n“I am very grateful to the Beasley family for providing me with the opportunity to move back home near my family and once again lead the company’s Augusta-based stations,” said Dunn. “I look forward to working with Mark and the cluster’s outstanding team in expanding our presence in the community.”"
