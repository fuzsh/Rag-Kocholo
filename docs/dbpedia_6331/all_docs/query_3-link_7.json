        "text": "Beasley Media Group has entered into an asset exchange agreement with Audacy, whereby Beasley will exchange the radio station 720 AM KDWN-AM and the translator for 101.5 FM for Alternative 107.5 KXTE-FM in Las Vegas.\n\nAs part of the agreement, longtime Las Vegas-based syndicated morning personalities Dave and Mahoney will continue on KXTE-FM weekdays from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. under Beasley’s ownership.\n\nBeasley Media Group says the asset exchange highlights its focus on premium local programming and content, and complements the company’s four other radio stations and digital operations in Las Vegas, the 31st largest designated market in the United States.\n\nCommenting on the proposed transaction, Caroline Beasley, chief executive officer, said, “Throughout Beasley Broadcast Group’s 61-year history, we have actively managed our station portfolio with the goal of serving the communities where we operate with the best local programming and brands, diversifying our operations, managing risk and improving financial results. The agreement to exchange KDWN AM/FM translator for KXTE-FM addresses all these strategic objectives. Upon completion, it will complement our Las Vegas market presence and content with five strong signals in the market.”\n\nThe parties expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of 2022, subject to Federal Communications Commission approval and other customary closing conditions."
