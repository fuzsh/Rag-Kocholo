Cues to call may include specific contest sounders, a “song of the day” aired in a specific hour as instructed by the Station, or the announcement of an entrant’s name which may require him/her to call the Station.

Station may also require additional information from callers in order to win the prize such as answering a trivia question correctly or identifying the title and/or artist of a certain song. Station will deem callers’ answers correct in their sole and absolute discretion. Calls may be recorded and/or broadcast on-air. In the event that the designated caller is disconnected prior to completion of the call, the next caller taken may be deemed the prize winner.
