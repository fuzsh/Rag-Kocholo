        "text": "ENCO Systems, Inc., Benztown, and Compass Media Networks have announced that they have entered into an agreement with Beasley Media Group, LLC, to provide their SPECai product to Beasley’s local advertising executives companywide. The deal will bring the award-winning AI-powered spec spot creator to all 59 owned and operated radio stations in 11 U.S. markets, including Augusta, GA; Boston, MA; Charlotte, NC; Detroit, MI, Fayetteville, NC; Fort Myers, FL; Las Vegas, NV; Philadelphia, PA; and Tampa, FL.\n\nSPECai uses advanced AI technology to generate fully produced spec spots in English and Spanish, including regional accents. SPECai was honored with a Radio World “Best of Show Award” at the 2024 NAB Show in Las Vegas.\n\nBeasley Media Group joins a growing list of over a dozen radio companies that have signed with SPECai, enabling their account executives to create compelling spec spots in seconds.\n\n“We are very excited to be among the early users of SPECai,” said Caroline Beasley, Chief Executive Officer, Beasley Media Group. “The technology is a game-changing tool for our sales teams to quickly and easily produce great-sounding spec spots for clients in minutes that don’t sound AI-generated, making them very compelling for advertisers. It’s amazing technology for our industry.”\n\nTo experience SPECai firsthand, contact Nancy Abramson at nabramson@compassmedianetworks.com for a demo.\n\nFor more information about SPECai, visit: www.enco.com/specai."
