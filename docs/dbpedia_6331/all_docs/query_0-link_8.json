        "text": "About\n\n2021 marks John Patrick’s 44th year in broadcasting. John’s first four years in radio were spent in Martinsville, Virginia doing afternoons of WFIC-AM, before making the move to join WHSL-FM, a Jefferson-Pilot owned radio station in Wilmington, North Carolina in 1982. After two years on the North Carolina coast, John arrived in Augusta in April of 1984.\n\nFor the next ten years, John worked for WZNY (SUNNY 105). During his tenure at SUNNY, John was at times, the Morning Show Co-Host, the Mid-Day personality, the Music Director and the Program Director. He held those titles through four different ownership groups and numerous General Managers.\n\nIn 1994, Savannah Valley Broadcasting’s WBBQ bought WZNY and John made the switch to those heritage Augusta call letters. John continued to do mornings on WBBQ as the station was purchased by Clear Channel in 2000, at which time he added the duties of Program Director and Operations Manager for the seven-station cluster.\n\nHe remained in that role until September of 2003 when he was named Community Relations Director and Non-Traditional Revenue Manager of the cluster. John left Clear Channel in October of 2007.\n\nIn 2008, John created The Murto Group. His company provides content to radio stations on several media platforms. In June of 2008, his company created “The Augusta Golf Show with John Patrick”, which currently airs in five markets across the Southeast, Augusta, Savannah and Brunswick, Georgia, Tallahassee, Florida and Norfolk, Virginia . The show also airs on the I-Heart Radio platform, the Radio.com app, and on all of your connected devices. The show was named the “Best Radio Golf Show in America in 2012, 2014 and 2015 by The International Network of Golf. John has also “guest hosted” for Peter Kessler on his daily SIRIUS/XM radio show, “Making The Turn”. John has also hosted “Talk Of The Tour” on www.pgatour.com in 2014.\n\nIn June of 2008, John received the Lifetime Achievement Silver Medal award from the Augusta Advertising Federation for his more than thirty years of broadcasting and Community Service.\n\nJohn served as the Master Of Ceremonies for the annual Georgia Golf Hall Of Fame induction banquet from 1992 to 2010.\n\nHe has also served as Master Of Ceremonies for the annual Ray Guy award banquet. The Ray Guy award is given to the nation’s best college punter each year and named for the former Oakland Raider punter and native of nearby Thomson Georgia, Ray Guy.\n\nSince 2004, John has been the Master of Ceremonies for the annual Mayor’s MASTERS reception, which through the years has honored Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Raymond Floyd and Ben Crenshaw, among others.\n\nJohn has served twice on the Board of Directors of the Imperial Theatre and has served as its President. He has also served two terms on the Board of Directors of the local Ronald McDonald House.\n\nIn 2001, John began a yearly radiothon for MCG Children’s Medical Center. Since its inception, the radiothon has raised over one million dollars for the hospital.\n\nIn 2018, John became a co-host of the morning news on Beasley Media’s NewsTalk station in Augusta, WGAC AM & FM\n\n2021 will also mark John’s 37th MASTERS golf tournament. He covers the tournament for the 600 stations nationwide. His reports through the years have also been heard on the BBC, the Australian Radio Network, FOX NEWS RADIO and KMOX radio in St. Louis."
