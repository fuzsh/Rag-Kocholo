        "text": "While Beasley Broadcast Group, Inc. ( ) might not have the largest market cap around , it saw a significant share price rise of 25% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGM. Shareholders may appreciate the recent price jump, but the company still has a way to go before reaching its yearly highs again. Less-covered, small caps tend to present more of an opportunity for mispricing due to the lack of information available to the public, which can be a good thing. So, could the stock still be trading at a low price relative to its actual value? Let’s examine Beasley Broadcast Group’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity.\n\nWhat Is Beasley Broadcast Group Worth?\n\nThe stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It’s trading around 19% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Beasley Broadcast Group today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $1.05, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Beasley Broadcast Group’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\n\nWhat kind of growth will Beasley Broadcast Group generate?\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Beasley Broadcast Group's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 97%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in BBGI’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on BBGI, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nSo if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing. To that end, you should learn about the .\n\nIf you are no longer interested in Beasley Broadcast Group, you can use our free platform to see our list of over"
