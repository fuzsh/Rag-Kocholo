        "text": "For 60 years, George Beasley led a successful radio business.\n\nHe became synonymous with radio, as the founder of Beasley Broadcast Group.\n\nHis name — and his trailblazing achievements in the radio industry — will live on, in his memory and through his company and children.\n\nThe Naples-based company announced that Beasley died on Wednesday. He was 89.\n\nAlthough he stepped back from his role as the publicly-traded media company's CEO in 2016, Beasley continued to serve as executive chairman, overseeing its board of directors.\n\nHis daughter, Caroline Beasley, took over the helm as chief executive, following in his footsteps, while continuing to tap his years of wisdom and expertise.\n\nToday, the company is more commonly known as the Beasley Media Group, reflecting its digital transformation and revenue diversification initiatives that have transformed it into more than just a radio business.\n\nIn a statement, Caroline said her father's unconditional love for her mother and his passion for the radio industry \"helped to guide him throughout his lifetime.\"\n\n\"A loving father, mentor and friend, I will especially miss his incredible wisdom, keen insight and gentle smile,\" she said.\n\nIn a news release, the company stated its stalwart, innovative founder would be most remembered for his humility, kindness, integrity and work ethic, as well as his love of family and friends.\n\nIn case you missed it: Beasley Broadcast Group sees tough first quarter amid pandemic\n\nMore: Naples' Beasley Broadcast took big blow from COVID-19 in 2020, but swings to profit in Q4\n\nFrom farmer to broadcaster\n\nBorn April 9, 1932, George Beasley grew up working in tobacco fields in his hometown of Ararat, Virginia. In an interview with the Naples Daily News about a decade ago, he said it's where he learned his first lessons in entrepreneurship.\n\nWhen he was 8, George's father died in a hotel fire. His grandparents helped raise him.\n\nIn high school, his grandfather gave him a quarter acre to farm tobacco, which grew to an acre by the time he graduated. He got to keep any profits.\n\nUltimately, George decided farming wasn't for him.\n\nAfter four years in the Army, he went on to become a teacher, a coach, an assistant principal and a principal. He joined the military, so he could pay for college.\n\nAlthough he loved education, he told the Daily News he made only $12,000 a year as a principal and quickly realized he needed a \"sideline business\" to support his growing family.\n\nThat sideline business? Radio.\n\nIn 1961, George launched his first radio station, a 500-watt AM station, in Benson, North Carolina. When he was younger, he used to hang around his uncle's radio station and it intrigued him.\n\n\"He let me do air work for free,\" he recalled in his sit-down interview with the Daily News in 2011. \"When I say for free, it means he didn't pay me.\"\n\nHe saw radio as a way to provide a voice for the voiceless.\n\nFrom our archives: George Beasley enters National Radio Hall of Fame\n\nMore: Caroline Beasley named CEO of Beasley Broadcast\n\nA pioneering spirit\n\nGeeorge Beasley built his company from the ground up, selling his first station for a profit and buying another with a more powerful signal in a larger market.\n\nHe introduced radio to smaller cities and towns throughout the country after the technology became available to take it beyond larger markets.\n\nAs he grew his radio business, George set goals and achieved them. He always looked to jump a little higher and push a little harder.\n\n\"You know there's a limit at some point,\" he told the Daily News years ago. \"But you don't know exactly where it is.\"\n\nWith that can-do attitude, the company continued to make waves in the radio industry.\n\nOver six decades, Beasley's company has carried on a strategy of buying underperforming stations in growth markets.\n\nToday, Beasley Broadcast has 62 radio stations in 15 large and medium-sized markets with digital offerings and a blossoming esports division.\n\nAfter growing up in their family's radio business, four of Beasley's five children joined the company in the 1970s and '80s, taking on leadership roles. The four of them still work for the company (his other son became a doctor).\n\nIn a phone interview, Caroline said her father understood the strengths his children could bring to his company, strategically putting them in spots where he knew they could thrive, from sales and operations to management.\n\n\"I was the more serious one and business-oriented. He mapped this out in his mind,\" Caroline recalled.\n\nEven when he stopped coming into the office every day, George had a keen interest in keeping up with the business, Caroline said, perking up whenever she brought it up in conversation and still sharing his life lessons.\n\n\"Never forgetting where he came from, he always understood the value of a dollar,\" she remembered.\n\nRadio was his true love, outside of his family, which he cherished.\n\nThe company's corporate headquarters relocated to Naples from Benson, North Carolina, in 1988, mostly so George and his wife could be closer to their grandchildren.\n\nA visionary leader\n\nAs deregulation unfolded after the passage of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, George sought to build station clusters in large and mid-size markets, including Miami, Philadelphia and Fort Myers-Naples. He took the company public in February 2000.\n\nIn the mid-2000s Beasley once again took a leadership role in the radio industry with an investment in HD Radio, a technology that allows stations to broadcast digitally.\n\nIn 2009, the company introduced its free app, so listeners could access its stations whenever and wherever they wanted.\n\nGeorge wasn't just a successful entrepreneur and radio pioneer.\n\nHe eagerly shared his time and talents as a mentor to many.\n\nAs an avid philanthropist, he gave back to his community and industry in countless ways.\n\nFor eight years, he served on the board of the North Carolina Association of Broadcasters, including a stint as president. The association honored him with a Distinguished Service Award in 1996 and inducted him into its Hall of Fame a few years later.\n\nGeorge received many other awards and honors over his lifetime.\n\nIn 2020, he made it into the Country Radio Broadcasters Hall of Fame and he earned the Broadcasters Foundation of America's Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nThe Florida Association of Broadcasters named him \"Broadcaster of the Year\" in 2011.\n\nIn 1990, his alma mater, Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina, honored him as a Distinguished Alumni. For many years, he served as a member of the university's board of trustees, as well as the chairman of its foundation's board.\n\nHe graduated cum laude with a bachelor's degree in business and social studies from ASU.\n\nProfessionally, his proudest accomplishments included receiving an honorary doctorate at ASU and the unveiling of a media complex on the university's campus that bears his name. The complex will provide future generations with the opportunity to chase their entrepreneurial dreams in broadcasting, as he did.\n\nLocally, he made it into the Junior Achievement Hall of Fame in Collier County in 2011, recognizing his efforts to promote entrepreneurship and to serve as a role model to youth. At the event, he shared a story about one of his first experiences as a \"business owner,\" addressing the 60 students who attended.\n\nThe story goes something like this: In high school, he received a 3-month-old pig for free through a National FFA Organization program. His job was to care for it, until it could be bred. After the pig had a litter, he had to give one of the babies back, but he sold the rest for $15 each. He then sold the mother pig to his uncle for $85, instead of taking it directly to market.\n\nLater, he learned his uncle sold the sow for $100 to a middleman and the middleman sold it for $115. His grandfather consoled him, pointing out that he'd made more than anyone else in the deal. The young Beasley stopped sulking.\n\nGeorge Beasley will be missed by the many people he touched in his lifetime, including his long-time employees, who considered him family.\n\nSharing his thoughts with Radio Ink magazine, longtime-employee Danny Highsmith, a regional vice president for the company in Fayetteville, North Carolina, said: \"George Beasley was my mentor, my teacher and my friend. I will forever be grateful to him for giving me the opportunity to be a leader in the Beasley Media Group. I learned much from him by watching him and the decisions he made. He set the example for the family-like culture we enjoy in our company.\"\n\nHighsmith has worked for Beasley Broadcast for 50 years.\n\nMac Edwards, a market manager, who worked with George for more than 30 years, told Radio Ink he was \"the true American success story.\"\n\n\"George was humble and kind and a highly astute businessman,\" he said. \".A true southern gentleman who was willing to work hard and loved to WIN! He was loyal, warm, direct, and genuine.\"\n\nEdwards also shared that Beasley was a big fan of The Masters in Augusta – attending every year until more recently, when he became too ill.\n\nThe radio industry as a whole is mourning the loss of such a great broadcaster and man.\n\nIn a statement, Gordon Smith, president and CEO of the National Association of Broadcasters, said he and his group were deeply saddened by the news.\n\n\"George was a pioneer in broadcasting and a giant in his field, building Beasley into one of the premier radio station groups over the course of 60 years and serving the radio industry with distinction,\" he said. \"We join with the entire broadcasting community in mourning our friend.\"\n\nIn its news release, Beasley Media Group stated George's legacy \"serves as a reminder that anything is possible with dedication, hard work and respect for one another.\"\n\n\"He was just a real special man,\" Caroline said. \"That impacted a lot of lives.\"\n\nGeorge is survived by his wife of 67 years Ann, as well as his five children, 16 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.\n\nA memorial service for family and friends will be held in Naples. The details are still to come.\n\nA private burial service for family will also be held in Ararat, Virginia."
