Jamie Lynn Spears and her boyfriend, Casey Aldridge, could be one step closer to tying the knot, Access Hollywood has learned.

A source close to the Spears family told Access, getting married "has been (Jamie Lynn's) goal."

She was "dead set from the beginning" and has gone "head to head" with her parents over the issue, the source added.

Aldridge has reportedly given Spears an engagement ring, which she has been showing off to friends and family in Louisiana and Mississippi, according to People.

Popping the question to Spears was not an out-of-the-blue proposal from Aldridge.

"He's been asking all along," the Spears family source told Access.

Additionally, "She's been asking (her parents)" to marry him for some time, and he has repeatedly asked her parents.

No word from the young couple on a possible wedding date.

The mom-to-be and her 18-year-old fiance are expecting their first child this summer.
