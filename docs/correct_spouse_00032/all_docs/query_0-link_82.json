        "text": "Jamie Lynn Spears felt like a “crap mom” for leaving her two daughters to film Fox’s military training reality show, “Special Forces: World’s Toughest Test.”\n\n“I miss my children if I’m away from them for like, you know, a couple of hours,” the “Zoey 101” alum, 31, admitted in a confessional interview on Wednesday night’s episode.\n\nSpears — who shares 14-year-old daughter, Maddie, with ex Casey Aldridge; and 4-year-old daughter, Ivey, with husband, Jamie Watson — then broke down in tears to one of the Navy SEALS on staff.\n\n“My babies,” she whispered to Remi Adeleke, explaining why she wanted to quit the show.\n\n“It probably goes back to a lot of things, and not only do I just love them and want to be with them, but also being away from them like this even just for myself it makes me feel like a crap mom,” the “Sweet Magnolias” star added.\n\n“They didn’t ask for their mom to be gone.”\n\nIn a previous episode, Spears spoke about how she signed on to do the show to try and break out of her superstar sister Britney Spears’ shadow.\n\n“I’m so proud of her, love her to death, but I don’t know. Sometimes I feel like I don’t really have anything for myself,” the Nickelodeon alum said during the show’s premiere.\n\nShe then added that she is “extremely proud” of Britney’s success, but she yearned to have her “own identity” and “be seen as [her] own person.”\n\nThe on-camera confession did not bode well with Britney, 41, who took to Instagram shortly after the series aired to call out her younger sister.\n\n“Are we gonna say it was hard being my sister ???? Hmmmmmmmmmmm …. really ???” the “Stronger” singer wrote in a since-deleted post on Instagram.\n\n“We teach her the MEANING OF MEAN and then throw her away in the end with no self rights !!!! You want me to share it on Telly ??? I’d rather spit in their faces and trash them on Instagram cause that’s all my family has ever been to me !!!!”\n\nDespite running the risk of upsetting her older sister, Jamie Lynn looked back positively on her experience on “Special Forces.”\n\nThe “Things I Should Have Said” author told Page Six at the show’s red carpet premiere last month that she felt “so grateful” to have gained a family while filming.\n\n“Everyone felt like family after this. You’re instantly bonded when you walk on [set] that first day,” she added. “I would not have been able to get through [this] without the support of all these amazing new people in my life.”\n\nSpice Girls member Mel B appears to have been one of the cast members who bonded most with Spears.\n\nOn Wednesday night’s episode, she was seen comforting the Netflix star when she shared she was ready to leave the show.\n\n“Being part of the Spice Girls, I’d like to think I’m very much part of a group, where you can be relied on and you can rely on other people,” Mel B, 47, said after Spears’ departure, “but when somebody you absolutely love leaves, that’s a really tough thing.”\n\n“Special Forces: World’s Toughest Test” airs Wednesday on Fox at 9 p.m. ET/8 p.m. CT."
