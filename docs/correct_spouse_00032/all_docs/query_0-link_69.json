        "text": "Jamie Lynn Spears' baby daddy got arrested for burglary after police say he was linked to a rash of thefts.\n\nCops in Mississippi busted Casey Aldridge back on Dec. 30, and he's now been charged with 5 counts of burglary of a storage house and one count of burglary of a dwelling.\n\nPolice say Casey was arrested after he was linked to the burglaries of several campsites in the areas surrounding Gloster, MS.\n\nAs you know ... Casey and Britney Spears' younger sister have one daughter together, 11-year-old Maddie.\n\nJamie Lynn was only 16 when she got pregnant way back in 2007. Casey was 18 at the time, and they were briefly engaged before breaking things off.\n\nTMZ broke the story ... Casey was also arrested for drug possession last February when cops say they found him passed out behind the wheel of a vehicle.\n\nWhile Casey's been on a tough streak, Jamie's the exact opposite. She's now married to Jamie Watson, and in 2018 they had a little girl, Ivey Joan, together."
