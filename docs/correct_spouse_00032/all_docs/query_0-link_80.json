        "text": "- has been hospitalised after being badly injured in a car accident in Louisiana.\n\nSeveral reports say Aldridge, 19, was injured in a single-car crash at 1:30am on Sunday in Louisiana, and has subsequently been charged with careless operation of a vehicle, a misdemeanor under US law, according to\n\nTMZ.com\n\nThe website claims that Aldridge lost control of his Ford F-150 truck while returning home from a fishing trip with two of his pals. Unverified reports claim the truck went off the shoulder of a road, and that no other vehicles were involved in the incident.\n\nThe extent of Aldridge's injuries has not been confirmed, however, initial reports say he has \"a cracked skull\" and has been \"in and out\" of consciousness since being admitted to the University of Mississippi Medical Centre.\n\nHowever, a family snitch tells people.com that \"It's not as serious as we thought at first.\"\n\nAnother\n\nwebsite reports\n\nthat Aldridge has a hematoma and doctors are worried he may have a blood clot in his brain. As we say, these claims have yet to be substantiated.\n\nJamie Lynn and Aldridge's sister are reportedly at his bedside.\n\nOne of the passengers in the truck is believed to have suffered a broken collar bone.\n\nStory developing...\n\nUpdates:\n\n3:00PM\n\n-E! News has unearthed fresh details about the crash. Louisiana State Trooper Mark Dennis tells the website that \"there were four occupants in addition to the driver in the truck, all male, and three of the five total people were ejected from the vehicle in the crash. One of those was indeed Casey Aldridge.\"\n\nEarlier reports speculated that Aldridge had sustained serious injuries, including a \"cracked skull\", and one of the other passengers had broken a collarbone.\n\n\"The other passengers reported minor injuries. It's my understanding that none of them required treatment at the scene and refused to be taken to a medical facility,\" Dennis adds.\n\nCommenting on previous reports that Aldridge was not tested for alcohol or drug use, he said: \"The trooper investigating the scene had no probable cause to request chemical tests so at this time there's no reason to suspect alcohol or drug use on the part of the driver.\"\n\nA family snitch tells people.com that Aldridge is awake and talking to family members at his bedside. \"The doctors are pretty positive he's going to be okay,\" the source says. \"He should recover fully. Of course you never know, but they're not expecting him to get any worse.\"\n\nThe source says Aldridge is likely to be kept in hospital for three days to \"to keep a close check on him,\" adding that medical staff are not planning any surgery \"unless something happens.\"\n\n1:00PM\n\n- Fresh reports say there were five people riding in Aldridge's truck at the time of the accident on Sunday - and three of them were ejected from the vehicle during the crash.\n\nPolice tell TMZ that Aldridge was purportedly driving the truck, swerved off the right side of the road and into a ditch. The cops believe he over-corrected his turn when he swung the truck back onto the road and caused the vehicle to flip. At that point 3 people - including Aldridge - were ejected from the truck.\n\nA Louisiana State Troopers spokesperson told Access Hollywood that Aldridge suffered \"moderate injuries\" during the incident.\n\nAldridge remains in a stable condition in hospital.\n\n10:50am\n\n-TMZ reports that Aldridge is now in a stable condition and will recover from the car crash. Contrary to earlier reports, Aldridge did not have any surgery but did suffer mild brain trauma. He will be kept at the medical centre for 2-3 days.\n\nPeople.com claims that Aldridge was involved in a car accident after attending a bachelor party for his cousin. The truck he was driving went off the road and flipped over.\n\nThere is no indication that Aldridge was tested for drug or alcohol use at the accident scene.\n\nNo comment as yet from the police or Spears.\n\n10:30am\n\n- New reports say that police believe there were three other passengers in the truck driven by Aldridge. It's believed he sustained the most injuries.\n\nBBB\n\n*nzherald.co.nz is not responsible for the content of external websites\n\nRock the vote\n\nThe\n\n2009 Web Awards\n\nare upon us.
