        "text": "Jamie Lynn Spears said she's bring more than new music into the world in 2018.\n\nI'm \"happy to announce that Maddie is FINALLY going to be a big sister,\" the singer wrote on Instagram, with a photo of her daughter Maddie, husband Jamie Watson and herself with a very pregnant belly. \"2017 was filled with some of the biggest challenges of my life, as well as some of the biggest blessings, so I made a choice to lay low this year to focus on truly becoming my best self as a person and as an artist.\"\n\nBritney Spears' younger sister went on to explain that during her eventful year, she \"continued working on my music and telling my story, which has created some of my most honest work,\" and will be released in 2018. She has posted more year-in-review posts on Instagram with the hashtag \"12DaysOfJLS.\"\n\nAnother major event that happened to the Spears family this year: Maddie got into a serious accident with an all-terrain vehicle in February that put her in the hospital and out of school. The 9-year-old has since recovered.\n\nSpears welcomed first daughter Maddie with then-fianc√© Casey Aldridge in 2008. She married Watson in 2014."
