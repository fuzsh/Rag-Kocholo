Jamie Lynn denied these allegations and claimed to be supportive of her sister’s freedom and happiness.\n\nThe feud escalated when Jamie Lynn released a memoir titled Things I Should Have Said, which Britney slammed as a way of profiting from her misery. The sisters have also exchanged insults and accusations on social media, with Britney calling Jamie Lynn a “scum person” and Jamie Lynn saying Britney could “tell the truth” instead of making vague and accusatory posts.\n\nThe feud has caused a rift between the fans of the two sisters, as well as between them and their other family members.\n\nIs Jamie Lynn Spears married and does she have kids?\n\nJamie Lynn Spears is married and has two children. She married Jamie Watson, a businessman and communications entrepreneur, in 2014.\n\nThey have a daughter named Ivey Joan Watson, who was born in 2018.\n\nJamie Lynn also has another daughter named Maddie Briann Aldridge, who was born in 2008 when Jamie Lynn was 17.\n\nMaddie’s father is Casey Aldridge, Jamie Lynn’s former boyfriend and fiancé. Jamie Lynn stepped away from her acting career to focus on being a parent after her teen pregnancy, which caused a scandal at the time."
