        "text": "Casey Aldridge is fighting back against rumors he cheated on fiancee Jamie Lynn Spears.\n\nIn a new interview with OK! magazine, Casey, the father of Jamie Lynn’s newborn daughter, Maddie, claims the rumors he engaged in an affair with a local woman are categorically untrue.\n\n“I never had a relationship with her,” Casey told the magazine. “My only relationship with her was as a friend, and me and Jamie were both friends with her.”\n\nCasey said the woman who has claimed in the media to have had an affair with him, is the sister of his best friend’s girlfriend.\n\n“Me and Jamie would see her randomly,” he said.\n\n“She was one of my friends too, supposedly,” Jamie Lynn, who also took part in the interview, added.\n\n“In a small town, everybody knows everybody. But when money’s involved, you find out who your friends are,” Casey noted.\n\nCasey also lashed out at rumors he got the woman pregnant.\n\n“There was never another girl pregnant, ever,” he stated. “I’m 19. Jamie’s the only girl I’ve ever had pregnant. In a small town, rumors do get started. A lot of people throw up a lot of crap. Somebody’s happy, and [when another person is] not, they’re going to make up a lot of stuff.”\n\nThe couple also addressed rumors they are to walk down aisle shortly.\n\n“We both agree that we want Maddie to be a little bit older so that she can be a part of it, so that she won’t just be sitting there the whole time,” Jamie Lynn said. “We want her to be old enough so that we can enjoy it. We are engaged, and we are really happy with where we are right now. There is no rush for anything.”\n\n“Some people think that you should just get married if you have a baby and you’re young. I think you should try it out and see,” Casey added."
