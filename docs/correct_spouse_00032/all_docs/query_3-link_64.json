        "text": "Jamie Lynn Spears has shared gorgeous pictures of her eldest daughter as she marks a major teenage milestone.\n\nMORE: Britney Spears reveals the truth about her Instagram posts at court hearing\n\nHer daughter Maddie,13, rocked a fluorescent yellow minidress for the homecoming dance, paired with silver sequin block heel sandals, and Jamie revealed that her eldest even had a date who gifted her a matching corsage.\n\nWATCH: See the trailer for season one of Sweet Magnolias\n\nIn a series of pictures, Maddie posed with her date, her mom and even her grandma Lynne. Her younger sister also joined in the festivities, holding Maddie's hand for several snaps.\n\n\"HOCO 2021, don't worry, I also can't believe my baby's growing up and going to her first dance and doing all the things that make time zoom by and stand still all at the same time,\" she captioned the post.\n\nMORE: Britney Spears' sister Jamie Lynn Spears shocks fans with surprising new announcement\n\nMORE: Britney Spears reveals she felt 'embarrassed' by documentary of her life – 'I cried for two weeks'\n\nJamie Lynn welcomed Maddie when she was 16 with ex-boyfriend Casey Aldridge. She is now married to husband Jamie Watson and they have a three-year-old girl, Ivey.\n\nThe wonderful family milestone comes, however, as a mental health charity turned down a donation from the Zoey 101 actress. In mid-October Jamie Lynn shared with fans she would be donating to This Is My Brave.\n\nMaddie, 13, attended homecoming\n\n\"I'm so happy to announce that a portion of my book proceeds will be going to @thisismybrave, because I know how scary it can be to share personal struggles, especially if you don’t feel you have the support or a safe space to do so, and they are doing amazing work to support and encourage people as they bravely share their experiences,\" she wrote.\n\nHowever, in response the charity revealed that they had declined the offer.\n\n\"We hear you. This Is My Brave was recently recommended to be a beneficiary organization for the proceeds from Jamie Lynn Spears' upcoming book,\" the organization wrote on their Instagram page.\n\n\"We have made the decision to decline the offer of receiving proceeds from the book sales.\"\n\nHer grandma Lynne was also there to celebrate\n\nThey also apologized \"to anyone we offended\".\n\nThe controversy comes after months of allegations against Jamie Lynn surrounding her sister Britney Spears' conservatorship.\n\nFans of the singer have taken to criticizing Jamie and her family, including mom Lynne and father Jamie, for their behavior over the past 13 years as Britney finally reaches a settlement that will see her exit the ongoing conservatorship.\n\nThis Is My Brave turned down the donation\n\nThe relationship between Britney, 39, and 30-year-old Jamie Lynn came under scrutiny after Britney spoke for the first time in a public court regarding her conservatorship.\n\nShe made several bombshell claims about the \"abusive\" conservatorship, and said she wanted to \"sue\" her family. \"It’s enough and it makes no sense at all,\" Britney said in court.\n\n\"I’m done. I want to sue my family, to be totally honest with you.\" She made no mention of Jamie Lynn specifically.\n\nRead more HELLO! US stories here"
