        "text": "So, what do we know about her so far?\n\nMaddie Watson’s family background\n\nJamie Lynn, 33, has two daughters: Maddie and Ivey Watson. According to Popsugar, Maddie Briann was born in June 2008 to a then-17-year-old Jamie Lynn and her childhood sweetheart Casey Aldridge.\n\nAfter stepping away from the limelight following the birth of her baby girl, Jamie Lynn later had her second daughter Ivey in April 2018, with her current husband Jamie Watson, per Women’s Health.\n\nThe same source states that her kids were raised in rural Mississippi and were rarely seen in public until recent years.\n\nIt seems like Maddie has changed her last name from Aldridge to Watson based on her Instagram handle. And, of course, she has familial roots in pop royalty with her aunt being the iconic Britney Spears.\n\nShe was a baby cover star\n\nSure, she might not remember it having been an infant at the time, but Maddie can say that she was once a cover girl. A few weeks after giving birth to Maddie, Jamie Lynn posed in a mama-baby shoot with her newborn for OK! Magazine. “I had a perfect pregnancy and a perfect delivery. I was very blessed,” teen mum Jamie Lynn shared at the time.\n\nShe’s an athlete\n\nMaddie is a natural sportswoman who specialises in softball. In July last year, the youngster’s team won a World Series championship, as seen on Instagram.\n\nHer talents extend to academics too, with proud mum Jamie Lynn bragging about her clever daughter’s 4.0 GPA score in an Instagram post – an impressive feat to say the least. “So proud of her work ethic as an athlete and as a student,” said the doting mama.\n\nShe has a cameo in Zoey 102\n\nMaddie can already tick off her first acting gig with her debut in none other than Zoey 102 – a follow-up from Zoey 101, the Nickelodeon show that kick-started her mum’s career over a decade ago. The sequel was released in July 2023.\n\nA fashionista in the making\n\nMaddie seems to have inherited her mum’s – and aunt’s – effortless style.\n\nFrom a blue tweed Staud two-piece set and a neon yellow strapless dress, to sparkling bodycons, the teen has been switching up her looks lately from sportswear to evening-ready attire.\n\nWhat’s her relationship with aunt Britney Spears like?\n\nIn an interview with Variety, Jamie Lynn shared how this affected her kids’ relationships with their famous aunt, who they used to be very close to, per The Things: “It makes me sad. I don’t want my daughter to feel that way. So I have to say I will absolutely not allow my children – especially my oldest daughter [Maddie], who was very affected by all of it – I will not allow her to feel this way in her life.”\n\nShe continued by stating that her advice to Maddie was to stay proud, even when other kids talk about her aunt. “Look at what your family’s done and accomplished. We came from a small town, and now everybody’s fascinated by the good and, especially, the bad. But look at what an example of a strong female you have,” she told Variety."
