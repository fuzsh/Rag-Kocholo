        "text": "Jamie Lynn Spears has signed on to Dancing with the Stars, and we reckon her husband, Jamie Watson, will be supporting her from the sidelines. Back in March, the couple celebrated their ninth wedding anniversary, and after 13 years together, they're still going strong. Keep reading for all the details…\n\nWho is Jamie Lynn Spears' husband Jamie Watson?\n\nUninterested in the spotlight, Jamie described himself as a \"normal guy with a normal job,\" during the 2016 TLC special, Jamie Lynn Spears: When the Lights Go Out. \"I did not know about the family,\" he added. \"I didn't know she had a TV show. I didn't know anything about her.\"\n\nAccording to PEOPLE, the 41-year-old reportedly works for a company that sells electronics to corporations. He also appears to have no social media presence and only occasionally attends red carpet events with his wife.\n\nHow did Jamie Lynn Spears meet her husband Jamie Watson?\n\nLast year, Jamie Lynn penned the sweetest message to mark her eight-year wedding anniversary with Jamie. Revealing that she met her husband when she was 18, the Sweet Magnolias actress recalled feeling \"a sense of peace\" when they started dating.\n\nBeneath a carousel of snaps from their 2014 wedding, Jamie Lynn wrote: \"I was an 18 year old single mom, when this guy came into my life, he made me laugh more then I ever had before, and his never changing consistency gave me stability for the first time in my life.\n\n\"Maybe, it was just because he was 10 years older, and had already established a successful life for himself both personally and professionally, but nonetheless, I felt a sense of peace with him, and I think that's what being in love is supposed to feel like, just feeling at peace.\"\n\nShe added: \"Who knows though, I am definitely not an expert, but I do feel lucky to have found that with my husband, even on the days I hate him. Happy 8 years of marriage to us, also we still need to go on our honeymoon.\"\n\nMORE: Sweet Magnolias' Jamie Lynn Spears' rollercoaster year filming show - involving sister Britney Spears\n\nREAD: 7 celebrities who were teenage parents: Sofia Vergara, Stacey Solomon & more\n\nJamie Lynn Spears and Jamie Watson's engagement\n\nIn 2013, Jamie Lynn announced that she and Jamie had gotten engaged. Taking to Instagram, the 32-year-old flaunted her sparkling engagement ring in a romantic snap. The caption read: \"Guesssss what????? #Hedidgood.\"\n\nFollowing the news, Jamie Lynn's sister Britney Spears tweeted: \"So excited and happy for my sister, congrats @jamielynnspears – love you.\"\n\nJamie Lynn Spears and Jamie Watson's wedding\n\nAfter a short engagement, the loved-up couple married on March 14 2014 at the Audubon Tea Room in New Orleans. For her big day, Jamie Lynn chose a Liancarlo lace gown from I Do Bridal Couture in Baton Rouge, while her husband opted for a dark gray suit.\n\nJamie Lynn's daughter, Maddie, whom she shares with ex-boyfriend Casey Aldridge, took on the role of flower girl, and proudly stood by her mom as she exchanged vows with Jamie.\n\nDo Jamie Lynn Spears and Jamie Watson have children?\n\nPrior to meeting her future husband, Jamie Lynn welcomed her daughter, Maddie, with her ex-partner Casey Aldrige on June 19, 2008. After stepping away from acting to look after her little girl, Jamie Lynn knew that finding the right person meant finding someone who loved Maddie as much as she did.\n\n\"Just seeing the way he was with Maddie and the way he just fit right in — it wasn't like I ever had to tell him anything. Their relationship is so sweet,\" the actress gushed to PEOPLE in 2018.\n\n\"He's the kind of dad that every little girl deserves to have. When I saw that, I was like, 'Oh my gosh, this is the man I love.' You fall in love with the people who fall in love with the people you love,\" she said.\n\nBy 2018, the pair had welcomed their daughter, Ivey Joan, together. A happy family of four, Jamie Lynn often posts photos of their sweet life together in Tennessee, and we love seeing what they're up to on Instagram."
