        "text": "Jamie Lynn Spears' boyfriend Casey Aldridge will not be facing statutory rape charges for getting the 16-year-old pregnant as speculated.\n\nIt had been reported that under Louisiana state law, where Jamie Lynn claimed the baby was conceived, Aldridge could be imprisoned for up to ten years.\n\nThe law in the state dictates that it would be unlawful if a pair engaged in \"sexual intercourse with consent between someone age 19 or older and someone between age 12 and 17.\"\n\nIt was reported that Aldridge is 19, but his uncle has spoken out and clarified that he is in fact 18, which was confirmed by DMV records.\n\nUncle Odus Jackson told CelebTV: \"Well, weâ€™ve heard those [rape] allegations and Iâ€™m not really that up on the technicality of that law, [but] I know he is 18 not 19 as some were saying, which would take him out of the area of statutory rape, I believe.\"\n\nThe sheriff's department in Kentwood, Louisiana confirmed that no complaint had been lodged against Spears' boyfriend and that \"no criminal investigation is currently underway\"."
