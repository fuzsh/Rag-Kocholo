        "text": "Casey Aldridge has split from yet another baby mama. RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal the father of Jamie Lynn Spears’ youngest child Maddie has divorced his wife April Watson.\n\nA clerk from Amite County Court in Mississippi exclusively revealed to RadarOnline.com that Watson filed for divorce from Aldridge on September 1, 2017.\n\nThe divorce was finalized on June 8, 2018.\n\nThe couple share daughter Skylar Brooke, 4, who they welcomed together in July 2014.\n\nWatson did not respond to RadarOnline.com’s request for comment.\n\nDespite the split, Aldridge and Watson appear amicable. Watson commented on a series of photos of their daughter on Aldridge’s Instagram, “My baby girl.” He responded, “She is a little beach bum!!! Lol.”\n\nThe divorce comes after legal troubles for Aldridge.\n\nBritney Spears’ sister’s ex-fiancé was charged with driving under the influence, possession of paraphernalia and reckless driving on May 25, 2016 in Amite County, Mississippi, RadarOnline.com previously reported.\n\nAldridge, 29, appeared in court on June 1, 2016, where he was found guilty on all three charges. He was sentenced to 12 months probation.\n\nSpears announced her pregnancy with Aldridge in 2008 when she was only 16 years old. The pregnancy resulted in the cancelation of her hit Nickelodeon show Zoey 101. They split in February 2010.\n\nOver the years, Watson posted many photos with Spears, 27, and Aldridge’s daughter Maddie.\n\nThe 10-year-old was involved in a freak ATV accident in 2017 when she accidentally drove into a pond and was stuck under water for several minutes before paramedics arrived. She remained in critical condition for days. She was released from the hospital less than a week later.\n\nSpears moved on with husband Jamie Watson, who she married in 2014. They welcomed daughter Ivey Joan in April 2018.\n\nWe pay for juicy info! Do you have a story for RadarOnline.com?
