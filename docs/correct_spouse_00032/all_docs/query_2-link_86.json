        "text": "This year’s I’m A Celebrity has a host of high-profile stars in attendance, including popstar Britney Spears’ sister, Jamie Lynn, 32. The two famous siblings have been in the news a lot this year, with the One More Time singer, 41, openly criticising Jamie Lynn for how she treated her during her years in a conservatorship.\n\nHowever, it hasn’t always been fraught between the sisters. When Jamie Lynn married her husband Jamie Watson, 41, in March 2014, her older sister was there by her side. The stunning ceremony took place in New Orleans, and the whole Spears family turned out for the special event.\n\nIn photos of the big day, Jamie Lynn can be seen wearing a beautiful white gown, with an intricate lace overlay and plunging neckline. Showing off her beautiful face, the bride wore her blonde hair up in an elegant twist and pinned her floor-length train in. Finishing the look, Jamie Lynn added dangling earrings and perfectly applied make-up.\n\nSurrounding the Nickelodeon star was her family, including Jamie Lynn's daughter Maddie, with her ex-partner Casey Aldridge. The little one looked adorable in a mini version of her mum’s dress to be flower girl, while her aunt Britney acted as bridesmaid.\n\nLooking unrecognisable with dark red locks, the mum-of-two poured her curves into a fitted grey gown with lots of bling. Completing the wedding party, Jamie Lynn and Britney's mum Lynne wore an embellished off-white dress. Their father Jamie, 71, matched the groom in a dark grey suit with a pastel pink tie.\n\nJamie Lynn and her husband Jamie met in 2010 after being introduced by a mutual friend. The couple got engaged in 2013 and hitched not long after. They welcomed their daughter, Ivey Joan Watson, five, in 2018.\n\nThe TV star shot to fame starring in Nickelodeon's Zoey 101 but left when she was 16 years old after announcing she was pregnant with Maddie.\n\nIt's not completely clear if Britney and Jamie Lynn are still in communication, but Britney doesn't seem to have a lot of kind words to describe her younger sister. She opened up about their relationship in her memoir, The Woman In Me.\n\nIn her autobiography, Britney wrote: \"My little sister - well, when I tell you she was a total b***h, I'm not exaggerating. It was clear that girl ruled the roost. Meanwhile, it was like I was a ghost child.\"\n\nThe Stronger singer also described Jamie Lynn as having \"erratic,\" \"moody,\" and \"paranoid\" behaviour. Jamie Lynn was also a trustee of Britney's conservatorship which was controlled by their father, Jamie.\n\nBritney reached out to her little sister for help, asking her to do something about their father's tyrannical ways. Jamie Lynn reportedly texted Britney: \"stop fighting it.\"\n\nJamie Lynn also released her own memoir a year before Britney did. It was titled Things I Should Have Said and she was slammed by Britney and her fans for releasing it while Britney was fighting to get her conservatorship overturned."
