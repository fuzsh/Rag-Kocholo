        "text": "JAMIE Lynn Spears’ baby daddy says it's just a question of time before she and older sister Britney put their differences aside and reconcile.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with The U.S. Sun, Casey Aldridge, 34, gave his views on the sisters’ estrangement in recent years.\n\nHe also spoke of his fears for Britney now that her ex Kevin Federline has moved their two sons to Hawaii.\n\nCasey, who got Jamie Lynn pregnant with her eldest daughter Maddie when she was just 16, revealed for the first time how “s*it hit the fan” when they told her family.\n\nBut he says Britney was “always supportive” despite fears from her family that Jamie Lynn’s teen pregnancy would harm her career.\n\nHopes that Britney will be able to put her heavily-publicized family feuds behind her were raised after her mom Lynne attended her 42nd birthday celebrations earlier this month.\n\nBritney also appeared to give a nod to her dad Jamie, who she has very openly slammed for his role in her 13-year mental health conservatorship, which ended in November 2021.\n\nAfter it emerged that Jamie had a leg amputated due to an infection following a knee replacement procedure, the Toxic singer shared an old picture of them together on social media.\n\nIt has also been suggested that Britney is back on speaking terms with her younger sister again, despite branding the 32-year-old a \"total b***h” in her explosive recent memoir, The Woman in Me.\n\nDespite the fallout between the sisters, Casey exclusively told The U.S. Sun that he believes they will find common ground and repair their bond.\n\n“Britney and Jamie Lynn are really very similar,\" he said.\n\n“They love family, they love doing everyday things.\n\n“They may have issues because of the conservatorship but they’re family and they will always go back to one another, it’s just a question of time.”\n\n'SUPER MOM'\n\nCasey, who is currently single and living in the small town of Gloster, Mississippi, spoke after Jamie Lynn returned to the U.S. following a stint on UK reality TV show I’m a Celebrity.\n\nThe former Zoey 101 star left the show early and Casey said he believes it was partly because being away from Maddie, younger daughter Ivey, 5, and husband James Watson was too much for her.\n\nHe compared it to the situation Britney finds herself in now that her ex Federline has taken their kids Sean Preston, 18, and Jayden James, 17, to live in Hawaii.\n\nCasey, who works as a welder, said: “Jamie Lynn loves her kids like a super mom, really.\n\n“Being apart from them and James by thousands of miles would tear her apart, make her distraught.\n\n“She should never have taken part in the show really, as it would have tore her up.\n\n“Jamie Lynn couldn’t bear to be apart from her kids and Britney is the same, which is why her kids being in Hawaii is going to hurt her.”\n\nCasey and Jamie Lynn began dating when they were both teenagers attending the same Baptist church.\n\nThe pair got engaged but the relationship came to an end in June 2008, two years after Maddie was born.\n\nCasey - who has made headlines in recent years due to his problems with addiction and the law - says he is now drug free and asked for a second chance to be in his daughter’s life.\n\n“I’ve seen Maddie playing softball, as recently as two months ago. She’s a great player. I’m proud of her,\" he said.\n\n“And I know Jamie Lynn’s husband James Watson, and he is a decent guy.\n\n“I haven't spoken to Jamie Lynn for some time but I have tried.\n\n“If I could speak to Jamie Lynn right now, I would ask for her forgiveness for how things ended.\n\n“I hope we can put the past behind us and move on.\n\n“I would like to see Maddie and play a role in her life.\n\n“I just want the chance to get that relationship with my daughter right.\"\n\n'S**T HIT THE FAN'\n\nCasey also reminisced about his shock when he first found out that Jamie Lynn was pregnant at age 16.\n\n“We were in Louisiana driving back to our homes and I pulled over into a gas station when she told me,” he said.\n\n“I’ll never forget that moment. My world span right round. I didn't know what to do or when to do it.\n\n“All I could think about was trying to support her and do the right thing.\n\n“By then, I had graduated high school and was working but she was still 16 and we were both living at home with our parents.”\n\nHe said the phrase “s**t hit the fan” applies to when they told Jamie Lynn and Britney’s parents at their Kentwood, Louisiana, home.\n\n“Not that night, but soon after, we told James and Lynne at Jamie Lynn’s home,\" he said.\n\n\"The s**t hit the fan, it definitely did after that.\n\n“We told them together and it was a little chaotic there for a while.\n\n“They were worried for Jamie Lynn, for her future, and they were worried what it would look like for Britney, too, to have a teenage sister pregnant.\n\n“They were saying it ‘probably wasn’t the best,’ or stronger words to that effect, but things simmered down after a while.\n\n“Britney wasn’t there but Jamie Lynn called her to tell her. Britney never reacted negatively or badly.\n\n“She was always, always supportive.\n\n“I always remember, she was never negative about it, despite her fame and what it might mean.”\n\nCasey explained that following his own personal problems in recent years, he has a better appreciation of what Britney went through with the conservatorship.\n\n“I managed to come out of it and, thank God, Britney came out of her troubles, too. That conservatorship was hard for her,\" he said.\n\n“Her family and Jamie Lynn were hit hard by that and they wanted the best for her.\n\n“I had struggles like Britney and we have both shown you can get through it.”"
