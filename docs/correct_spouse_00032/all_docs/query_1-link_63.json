        "text": "Jamie Lynn Spears is best known for her hit show Zoey 101 and for being the younger sister of Britney Spears.\n\nThe pair have engaged in an online feud in recent years, but the siblings were once very close.\n\nThe actress has been making her rounds on reality television shows in 2023, including I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! and Dancing with the Stars.\n\nRead more: Eight of the most frightening secrets Britney Spears revealed in conservatorship court battle\n\nHow old is Jamie Lynn and where is she from?\n\nJamie Lynn was born 4 April 1991, making her 32 years old. She is originally from McComb in Mississippi, United States.\n\nShe was named after her parents James and Lynne Spears, and has two older siblings - Bryan and Britney.\n\nHer relationship with Britney\n\nJamie Lynn and her family spent time travelling around the world touring with Britney as a child. She even made her acting debut in her sister’s 2002 film Crossroads.\n\nBritney and Jamie Lynn had a close relationship during the latter’s younger years, and were often pictured together on red carpets. The ‘Baby One More Time’ singer has said she felt protective over her younger sibling.\n\nHowever, in Britney's recent autobiography ‘Woman In Me’, she wrote about struggles in their relationship: “It felt like I was a ghost child. I can remember walking into the room and feeling like no one even saw me.\n\n“Jamie Lynn only saw the TV. My mother, who at one time had been the person I was closest to in the world, was on another planet.”\n\nShe shared that she was surprised by how Jamie Lynn spoke to their mother, adding: “I’d listen to her spew these hateful words, and I’d turn to my mother and say, ‘Are you going to let this little witch talk to you like that?’ I mean, she was bad.”\n\nJamie Lynn and Britney have exchanged heated words over social media in recent years, with the pop icon accusing her sister of actively and knowingly being involved in her conservatorship, while not taking actions to help terminate it.\n\nThey also have another sibling, Bryan, who is more private. He was previously a co-manager of Britney's conservatorship and was a co-producer of Zoey 101.\n\nJamie Lynn's romance life\n\nJamie Lynn announced on 20 December 2007 that she was expecting her first child with then-boyfriend Casey Aldridge. She was 16 years old, while Casey was 18. They had been dating for two years by that point.\n\nThe pair announced their engagement in March 2008, and welcomed their daughter, Maddie Briann Aldridge, on 19 June 2008.\n\nJamie Lynn and Casey ended their engagement in March 2009, but they reconciled in August 2010. Their relationship ended for a second time in November 2010.\n\nShe went on to date Jamie Watson, a businessman who owns communications service Advanced Media Partners.\n\nThey got engaged two years later, announcing it in March 2013. They tied the knot in New Orleans on 14 March 2014.\n\nThe couple welcomed their first child together, a daughter named Ivey, on 11 April 2018.\n\nGet the latest RSVP headlines straight to your inbox for free by signing up to our newsletter"
