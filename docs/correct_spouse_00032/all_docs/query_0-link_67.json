        "text": "What TV shows has Jamie Lynn Spears been in? Who are her husband and children? Here's everything you need to know as she settles into the I'm A Celebrity jungle.\n\nAmerican actress and singer Jamie Lynn Spears is in the Aussie jungle for I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! 2023. She's most famously known for starring as 'Zoey' in Zoey 101 and of course for being Britney Spears' younger sister.\n\nTaking on one of her biggest work challenges yet, Jamie Lynn has been cosying up to the likes of ex-MEP Nigel Farage, JLS' Marvin Humes, Made In Chelesa's Sam Thompson and many more.\n\nRead more: Watch The Moment JLS' Marvin Humes Serenaded Jamie Lynn Spears In I'm A Celeb Bathtub\n\nRead more: What Year Did I'm A Celeb Start And Who Was On The Original Line Up?\n\nRead more: What Has Britney Spears Said About Sister Jamie Going On Iâ€™m A Celeb 2023?\n\nThanks to her controversial relationship with her big sister, one of the most famous pop stars in the world, Jamie has certainly been one of this year's most interesting celebs. From opening up about her teen pregnancy to how her daughter nearly died, the American star has certainly embraced her co-stars and new way of life.\n\nSo what do we need to know about Jamie Lynn Spears? Here's all the most important facts from her age, to her husband and children and much more.\n\nHow old is Jamie Lynn Spears?\n\nBorn in Mississippi in 1991, Jamie Lynn is 32-years-old. She is named after her parents Jamie Spears and Lynne Spears. The actress has two older siblings, Britney and Bryan.\n\nWho is Jamie Lynn's husband?\n\nJamie is married to 41-year-old Jamie Watson who she met in 2010 after her split from Casey Aldridge, who she had her first child with.\n\nUnlike the singer and actress, her husband stays out of the limelight and in the 2016 TLC documentary Jamie Lynn Spears: When the Lights Go Out he described himself as \"a normal guy with a normal job\".\n\nJamie Watson is the owner of Advanced Media Partners which is a Louisiana-based communications service. The pair got engaged in 2013 and married in 2014. They celebrated their ninth wedding anniversary in March 2023.\n\nRead more: Inside Britney And Jamie-Lynn Spears' Feud And Complicated Relationship\n\nHow many children does Jamie Lynn have?\n\nJamie Lynn is a mum of two daughters; Maddie and Ivey. Jamie had her eldest, Maddie Briann Aldridge, with her childhood sweetheart Casey Aldridge in 2008 and ten years later had Ivey Watson with Jamie Watson.\n\nJamie Lynn's first pregnancy shocked the world as she announced she was expecting at 16-years-old and at the time she was starring in Nickelodeon's Zoey 101. The TV series ended soon after but Jamie has squashed claims that it was due to her pregnancy and instead says, the show had run it's course.\n\nSpeaking to Nylon she said: \"I didn't become pregnant until probably six months after we wrapped or something like that, but some of the episodes had not aired yet.\"\n\nWhat TV shows and films has Jamie Lynn been in?\n\nJamie Lynn Spears is known for the popular Nickelodeon show Zoey 101 which aired 2005-2008 but she has also starred in the 2020 Netflix series Sweet Magnolias. In 2023 she premiered a reboot of Zoey 101 with a film called Zoey 102 which she had her daughter's star in it.\n\nThis year Jamie Lynn is delving into the realty show world, but I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! 2023 isn't her first taste as she was on Dancing With The Stars in 2023. Whilst on the show she was partnered with Alan Bersten and was voted off second.\n\nAs well as her dancing debut she starred on Special Forces: World's Toughest Test, which is much like SAS: Who Dares Wins in the UK. The mum-of-two left the show after only 48 hours in training because she missed her kids.\n\nWhat is Jamie Lynn Spears' Net worth?\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, Jamie Lynn Spears' net worth is estimated at around $6 million which is over Â£4.8 million."
