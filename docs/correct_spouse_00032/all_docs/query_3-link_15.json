Casey Aldridge's wife April Watson revealed more details on the near-fatal crash.\n\n\"This has been one of the most influential weeks of my life,\" April captioned a collage of photos of her stepdaughter. \"We have received the scariest news of our lives, and then received the BEST news of our lives!\"\n\nApril then praised her husband for his strength throughout the devastating time.\n\n\"Now my sweet husband is gone off for work, all within 7 days,\" she wrote. \"We have been through so much together in the past few years. But this is what I have learned: God favors us, he cares so much for our heart, and he has HUGE plans that are far better than our own. I can honestly say that I have consistently and faithfully prayed on a daily basis for the past 6 months, for my family to be restored and living out God's will for our life.\"\n\nShe ended the post with, \"I can rest now in strong faith, knowing that God's hand is undeniably upon us, even when we don't deserve it.\"\n\nMaddie's grandmother, Lynne Spears, also gave an update regarding the 8-year-old's condition.\n\n\"I really don't know how to express my heartfelt thanks to all of you who have prayed continuous prayers for Maddie at this very difficult time,\" she wrote. \"Thank you, God bless you and I know that the huge outflow of Prayers created this miracle and has humbled my family and I! Maddie is doing great and getting better everyday!!\"\n\nJamie Lynn then posted a bible reading on her Instagram, \"Be joyful always; pray continually. The way to rejoice at all times is to find moment-by-moment pleasure in your relationship with Me – the Lover of your soul. The relationship is so full of comfort and encouragement that it's possible to be joyful in hope even when you're in the midst of adversity.\"\n\nMaddie was left in critical condition when she drove her ATV into a pond and was submerged underwater for minutes. Jamie Lynn and her husband Jamie Watson failed to rescue Maddie before paramedics arrived and freed her."
