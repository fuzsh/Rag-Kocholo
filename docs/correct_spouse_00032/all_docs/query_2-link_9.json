        "text": "JAMIE Lynn Spears is currently battling bugs in the I'm A Celebrity jungle - yet she's had just as tough a time on home turf.\n\nThe Zoey 102 actress' bad blood with sister Britney is well-documented, though there's a darker past with her criminal ex, too.\n\nSinger and actress Jamie Lynn is the mother of two daughters and she announced her first pregnancy in December 2007.\n\nAt the time, she was with Mississipi man Casey Aldridge, and the pair confirmed that they were expecting a child together when Jamie Lynn was 16 and Casey was 18.\n\nThe pair became engaged in March 2008 shortly before welcoming their daughter Maddie Briann Aldridge on June 19, 2008.\n\nYet despite setting up a happy family unit, they split shortly after.\n\nJamie Lynn previously told how her reputation went from \"child star to s**t\" overnight when news of her baby with Casey broke.\n\nCrying to First Dates’ Fred Siriex on I’m A Celebrity earlier this week, Jamie Lynn, now 32, said: “They didn’t want me to have the baby. A lot of people around me.”\n\nIn her 2022 memoir Things I Should Have Said, Jamie Lynn claimed her parents even tried to convince her to get an abortion, telling her a baby would wreck her work.\n\nSince her break-up with Casey, Jamie Lynn has gone on to have a second daughter.\n\nShe shares Ivey Joan Watson - born in 2018 - with husband Jamie Watson, who she met in 2010.\n\nYet her ex Casey's life has taken a downward spiral.\n\nSince their split, he has been arrested for burglary as well as for drug possession.\n\nBack in 2020, TMZ reported how Casey broke into a campsite with the intention of stealing rifles.\n\nHe was charged with the felony of burglary breaking and entering a commercial building after the publication claimed he \"tried stealing two rifles.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in 2019, he was arrested for drug possession.\n\nAt the time, police claimed he had been found passed out behind the wheel of his car.\n\nA report obtained by US Weekly at the time confirmed he was in the \"driver's seat\" and found \"with the vehicle still in drive.\"\n\nThe publication reported he was arrested for possession of oxycodone, Xanax, lorazepam and drug paraphernalia.\n\nHe was taken to jail but released four days later.\n\nAt the time, he appear intent on changing his ways.\n\nHe told the publication: \"I’m going to do everything in my power to better myself and not have to go through situations like this and make sure it never happens again.\n\n\"Whatever I need to do to do that — to not let it happen again.\"\n\nHe told of his fears of the arrest affecting his custody arrangement for his daughter with Jamie Lynn.\n\nPrior to this, in 2016, Radar Online told how Casey was arrested back in May 2016 for driving under the influence, possession of paraphernalia and reckless driving.\n\nHe was found guilty and sentenced to 12 months of probation.\n\nEarlier this month, Jamie Lynn entered the jungle alongside fellow stars like Made In Chelsea's Sam Thompson, former EastEnders actress Danielle Harold, and YouTuber Nella Rose.\n\nShe has threatened to quit the camp during her short stay Down Under - stating she is missing her kids.\n\nMeanwhile, The Sun exclusively reported how Britney is watching Jamie's antics in camp."
