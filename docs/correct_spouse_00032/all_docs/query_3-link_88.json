        "text": "Britney Spears' younger sister Jamie Lynn Spears is about to head into the jungle for the latest series of I’m A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!\n\nBut away from her celebrity life, the 32-year-old actress is a married mum of two daughters. While she shares her youngest, Ivey, who is five with her businessman husband Jamie Watson, who she married in 2014, Jamie Lynn also has 15-year-old Maddie from a previous relationship.\n\nThis means Jamie Lynn was just 16 when she got pregnant and 17 by the time she gave birth for the first time. Maddie’s father is Jamie Lynn’s childhood sweetheart Casey Aldridge, who was 19 when their daughter was born. The couple were previously engaged but split in 2010 when Maddie was just 19 months old.\n\nAfter announcing her pregnancy, Jamie Lynn stepped out of the spotlight and went to live in the “middle of nowhere Mississippi” for a bit, but says the paparazzi still found her. She stayed there for most of her pregnancy and the birth was a private affair with only family members present, including big sister Britney, who flew in to meet her niece.\n\nWhen Jamie Lynn and ex Casey split, her and Maddie moved back to the Spears’ home state of Louisiana and this is where she eventually met her now husband Jamie. They married in New Orleans when Maddie was five years old and she was a bridesmaid at the wedding. These days the family live in Tennessee.\n\nReflecting on her teenage pregnancy, Jamie Lynn previously told Nylon magazine: “You have your first love, or what you call love, in high school. You think it’s forever, and then oh my gosh, I’m pregnant. I am mortified to have to tell my parents and my family this. I do not care what TMZ thinks about this. All I was thinking about was ‘These are the people I love that I have to tell, and also, I’m pregnant. There’s a human being growing inside of me and I’m so young, I’m almost a baby myself.”\n\nAlthough she admits to “hiding away” during her pregnancy, Jamie Lynn introduced Maddie to the world when she was just three weeks old when she graced the cover of OK! magazine in July 2008 with her smiling mum holding her. The headline read ‘Jamie Lynn’s baby Maddie! Being a mom is the best feeling in the world.’\n\nIn the interview, Jamie Lynn revealed that Maddie was born “right on schedule” and she had a four-hour labour and natural birth. But she gave her mum a scare when she didn’t cry immediately after being born. “She just looked at me and she didn’t really cry at first. I was scared, and then she started screaming.”\n\nJamie Lynn took to motherhood quickly and says Maddie was a “very good baby”. But in 2017, she was rushed to hospital after the quad bike she was on flipped into a pond at her family’s home. At the time she was eight years old and submerged underwater for several minutes before she could be freed from her seatbelt. In her 2022 memoir Things I Should Have Said, Jamie Lynn recalled the moment they “thought they had lost” Maddie and said she was “eerily blue” when she was pulled from the water. Miraculously, she was released from hospital after a week and suffered no permanent damage.\n\nThe near-death incident made Jamie Lynn look at life differently and she later told PEOPLE magazine: “When you have the worst thing you can think of in your life happen to you, it makes you look at everything else differently. You have a lot more gratitude. That was a miracle. That should be heard. There are a lot of dark things in this world today and I think that putting something out there like that, that is so wonderful, is something that should be shared, especially when it made so many changes in a lot of lives for the better.”\n\nAs well as being a big sister to Ivey, Maddie is a straight A high school student and skilled softball player and has even appeared in Jamie Lynn’s film, Zoey 102. Maddie makes an appearance too. Jamie Lynn said: “Having my two girls be a part of this film and get to make their little debut cameo was so special because they got to do it together. Just seeing those two worlds collide, it was a really proud moment for me as a mum.”\n\n*I'm A Celebrity...
