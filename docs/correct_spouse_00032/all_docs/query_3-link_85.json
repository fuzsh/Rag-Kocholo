So when I do start singing, buy my album! - upon starting her career in show business\n\nI'm more honest in my lyrics than I am in anything else. It's where I feel the most safe to express myself. I write about growing up, my family, Maddie and getting pregnant. If I've lived it, why wouldn't I talk about it? I guess that's been the coolest thing-realizing that it's OK to just be myself and really tell my story.\n\n[On why Britney chose to sing pop music and Jamie chose country] Every person in this world has a different outlet for them where they release their creative energies or whatever energies they need to release. It's just the way she chose to release hers and this is how I chose to release mine."
