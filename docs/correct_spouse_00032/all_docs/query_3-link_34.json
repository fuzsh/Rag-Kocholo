        "text": "JAMIE Lynn Spears ex-boyfriend Casey Aldridge has been charged by Mississippi cops for burglary.\n\nThe 30-year-old was arrested on December 30 and the police department has now charged him with five counts of burglary of a storage house and one count of burglary of a dwelling.\n\nAmite County Sheriff's Department confirmed the charges on their Facebook page, and shared that the arrest comes amid a wave of burglaries at campsites near Gloster, MS, close to the Louisana stateline.\n\nCasey and Jamie Lynn met when they were teenagers; she later fell pregnant at the age of 16.\n\nThe pair welcomed daughter Maddie, and Casey proposed to the singer but they split a year later.\n\nThe charges come less than a year after he was arrested when Mississippi police found him passed out in a vehicle in Natchez, about an hour west of Gloster.\n\nOxycodone, Lorazepam, Xanax and drug paraphernalia were all found in the car.\n\nHe was released on $1,500 bond but was later handed one felony charge for possession, and three misdemeanor charges for the paraphernalia and other two possessions.\n\nAfter his arrest he told Us Magazine: \"I’m going to do everything in my power to better myself and not have to go through situations like this and make sure it never happens again.\n\n\"Whatever I need to do to do that — to not let it happen again.\"\n\nHe was also arrested in 2016 in the state in connection with driving under the influence, reckless driving and possession of paraphernalia.\n\nHe went on to serve a year's probation after he was found guilty of the charges.\n\nJamie-Lynn, now 28, has been married six years to Jamie Watson.\n\nThe pair welcomed their daughter Ivey in 2018.\n\nThe former Zoey 101 star told People magazine: “We are beyond excited to welcome this beautiful baby girl to our family!\n\n\"Her middle name, Joan, is to honour my Aunt Sandra, who passed away 10 years ago from ovarian cancer. She was the most graceful woman I’ve ever known.”\n\nIvey was born in Covington, Louisiana, and weighed in at 7 lbs 8 oz, with a length of just over 19 inches."
