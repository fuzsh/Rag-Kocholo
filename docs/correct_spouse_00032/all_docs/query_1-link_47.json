        "text": "Jamie Lynn Spears’ status as an unwed mother is soon coming to an end. The Nickelodeon star and her fiancé Casey Aldridge have begun to plan their wedding.\n\nOK! magazine reports that the nuptials will take place this fall at Spears’ new home in Liberty, Miss.\n\nDon’t expect any last-minute change of venue — Spears, 17, is more Jamie from the block than Hollywood glam.\n\n“Her own backyard with just the people who matter most is more Jamie Lynn’s style,” a friend of Spears’ told the magazine.\n\nThe friend also says that Spears, who will likely have big sister Britney serve as maid of honor, is planning on eschewing couture in favor of a gown from “one of the better stores in Baton Rouge.” The friend says of the gown, “it will be strapless but not figure-hugging — she’s too young for that — and fairly traditional in style.”\n\nBritney Spears ‘unfazed’ by McCain ad\n\nParis Hilton and Britney Spears both have the briefest of cameos in the newly released ad from Senator John McCain's campaign. While Hilton is “happy to feel relevant,” according to a source close to her, Spears is said to be “unfazed” by the inclusion.\n\n“She visits gossip sites on the Internet,” says a source close to Spears. “She’s not exactly glued to campaign news. She’s unfazed by this. If not for Googling her own name she probably wouldn't have noticed.”\n\nWill Justin and Jessica wed?\n\nCould Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel soon be hearing wedding bells?\n\nTimberlake is always careful not to reveal too much about his personal life, but a friend of the couple’s is saying knot-tying might be in his future.\n\n“I can see him marrying her,” the source told Us Weekly. “She is what he needs right now — a grown-up relationship.”\n\nIn 2004, when he was dating Cameron Diaz, Timberlake told Ellen DeGeneres he wouldn’t marry until he was nearly 40 (he's now 27). What changed?\n\n“With Jessica, he got what he wanted, and I think it will stick,” the source told the magazine.\n\n{ \"type\": \"Slideshow\", \"element\": null, \"html\": null, \"ecommerceEnabled\": false }\n\n“Eva asked me to teach her how to cut hair,” Paves told Life & Style.\n\nThe magazine says that Longoria Parker “sectioned, clipped, twisted” and eventually cut and styled Paves’ hair.\n\nPaves says the “Housewife” did a stellar job: “I am a little worried about my job, though,” he joked to the mag."
