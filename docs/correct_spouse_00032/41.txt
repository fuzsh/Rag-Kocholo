The gist:

Jamie Lynn Spears and her ex-fianc√©, Casey Aldridge, made headlines in 2007 when she announced that at 16 years old, she was pregnant with his child.

The couple got engaged in 2008 and had a daughter, Maddie Briann Aldridge, together. However, their relationship fizzled in 2010 before they ever tied the knot.

If you were a kid in the mid-2000s, you may be familiar with a little show called Zoey 101.

Jamie Lynn Spears starred as the titular character Zoey in the popular Nickelodeon series, which made her a household name alongside her mega-famous older sister Britney Spears.

But in late 2007, when the show was in its prime, Jamie Lynn announced the news that she was pregnant at age 16. Zoey 101 ended abruptly after that.

Despite speculation that her pregnancy prompted Zoey 101 to end, Jamie Lynn claimed that the show had run its course months before she even knew she was going to become a mom.
