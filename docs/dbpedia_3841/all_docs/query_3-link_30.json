        "text": "Description\n\nJust Released – A Full Color Edition of Jim DuFresne’s Classic Guidebook\n\nWith more than 200 square miles of wilderness and 400 islands, Isle Royale National Park offers a unique outdoor experience. Located in Lake Superior, the island is known for its secluded solitude as a rare place without roads, cars or strip malls. What it does have is 165 miles of trail, chains of inland lakes to paddle and portage and miles of rugged coastline best explored in a kayak.\n\nIsle Royale National Park: Foot Trails & Water Routes is Jim DuFresne’s classic to Michigan’s first national park, known on the Lake Superior island as the “backpacker’s bible.” The guidebook to the wilderness areas of Isle Royale has been in publication for more than 30 years but in this edition has been coverted to full color and paired up with downloadable maps.\n\nIsle Royale National Park: Foot Trails & Water Routes provides everything you need to know for an island adventure. The 192-page book contains chapters on the park’s flora, fauna, fishing opportunities and history as well as complete directions for trails and waterways, including mileage, difficulty and amenities at each destination. More than 70 color photos and 35 maps of the park’s backcountry round out the guidebook.\n\nIsle Royale National Park: Foot Trails and Water Routes is the first to blend a printed guidebook with digital, downloadable content. Trail maps in this book are accompanied by a QR code that will link you to the same section of the trail on the MichiganTrailMaps.com website where you will find a much more detailed map that can be downloaded onto your mobile device or printed and used while hiking. Also on the website page are links to the Avenza Map Store that will enable you to download the same map with georeferencing.\n\n“In a day when few travel guides are well written – and that is even more the case with outdoor guides – author Jim DuFresne gives us a book that is a joy to read. He understands the special love that binds hikers, fishers, and canoeists to the things of nature; dewy mornings, mischievous wildlife, lonely shorelines. And he describes those things endearingly.”- Chicago Tribune"
