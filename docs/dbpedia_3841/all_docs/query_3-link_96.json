It departs from Copper Harbor at the tip of the Kennewa Peninsula. Just getting to -and staying in- Copper Harbor can be an adventure This small seasonal town is supported by Isle Royale traffic and a nationally know set of mountain bike trails. If you have extra time in town and are a mountain biker you will want to plan to stay an extra day. Loading the Queen is quick and easy, and in all of our trips, has never been a problem or hassle. The trip over takes about three hours and has away been more or less smooth. It is thrilling to see the main land fade away and get a sense of the true size of being out on the big lake. It is also very exciting to see the island slowly come into focus as you near. The Queen is a great place to spread out maps and double check your itinerary or talk with those around you to gather some insights on the Island. The chances are someone sitting near you is on their 3rd or 4th trip to the island and will be a wealth of information. The Queen also is one of the cheaper ways to get to the island. While in the off season it is not usually crowed, during the peak season you will need reservations. Taking the time to boat to the island helped me to understand how remote and isolated Isle Royale really is.\n\nIsle Royale Sea Planes\n\nVoyager II\n\nThe Voyager II is based out of Grand Portage, MN and hold around 40 passengers, making it the smallest passenger ferries to Isle Royale. However, what it lacks in size, it makes up with in versatility and seaworthiness. (See blog). Scheduling the Voyager is a bit tricky as it leaves Grand Portage and journeys to Windigo and the North Shore, then overnights in Rock Harbor and brings passengers around the southern shore to Windigo and then on to Grand Portage in its 48 hour circuit. To add even more complexity to this circuit, the Voyager commonly stops of at a variety of docks to pick up and drop off passengers who have scheduled ferry service from these starting and ending points on their hikes. The Voyager can carry canoes and kayaks as well, for an additional fee. The flexibility of the Voyager's stops makes it a possible for creative adventurers to access all parts of the island.\n\nRanger III\n\nWe have seen the Ranger III Rock Harbor and unloading at Snug Harbor, but have never actually used this boat as it leaves from Houghton and is the longest of the ferries at 6 hours. It is, however, the largest vessel and offers the most flexible seating and is the most stable in the big lake. It is staffed with an interpretive ranger for programming en route. This ship also has the largest cargo capacity and even carries small passenger boats on its deck. It also resupplies the island for most of the park service, lodge, and concessions supplies at Rock Harbor and Windigo. It is not uncommon to see this impressive vessel and it's blue hull steaming down Rock Harbor.\n\nLinks to Isle Royale Transportation Services\n\nThe Queen IV in Copper Harbor, Isle Royale National Park\n\nLoading the Voyager II in Rock Harbor, Isle Royale National Park\n\nSeeing the North Shore from the Voyager II's back deck, Isle Royale National Park\n\nCampsites & Shelters\n\nDuncan Bay Narrows camp site, Isle Royale National Park\n\n​​​Key features:\n\n-Ample space (shelves and hooks to hang gear)\n\n-Clean (equipped with a broom)\n\n-Bug free zone\n\n​-Interesting graffiti\n\n-Fog and moisture rolling in can seep through gear\n\n-First come, first serve​​\n\nA shelter at McCargo Cove, Isle Royale\n\nCooking dinner at Lane Cove, Isle Royale\n\nUnloading a West Caribou island, Isle Royale shelters\n\nThe Malone Bay shelter is setup for optimal views of the big lake, Isle Royale\n\nA dry shelter at Siskiwit Bay, Isle Royale\n\nGeneral Information\n\nOne of our favorite features on Isle Royale is the convenience and bug-free space of the camp shelters. These 3 sided screened in home away from homes offer you the ability to spread out your gear, dry out, and fully stand up to dress or pack. We have always found them to be fairly clean and stocked with a broom to brush out any dust or boot debris before laying out your sleeping pads and gear. Waking up with a view directly out of the shelter to the water is really what the experience on Isle Royale is all about.\n\n​The shelters are first come, first serve and can fill quickly in the peak season, many locations have several shelters, but not all, some are tent campgrounds are tent only. There are a few things to consider when setting up your shelter. 1. Sometimes the fog can roll right in and soak your gear in a chilly mist. 2. The open sided shelter leaves no sound barrier or privacy. 3. The squeaking, slamming doors might wake you up in the middle of the night if your shelter-mate is forgetful when using the outhouse. While I am not a fan of visitors marking up the national park, there is some interesting graffiti and art work inside most shelters. Most of the shelter locations have an outhouse, in the past they were stock with toilet paper but this is not longer the case so plan accordingly. They aren't the worst outhouses I've ever used, but it is a typical stinky experience.\n\nCamping is only allowed in camps sites, unless you have made arrangements with a ranger and a have a permit to camp outside a campground. The park service typically allows only one party per section or zone of the island to camp outside a camp site every day. As a result, almost everyone camps in camp sites. You may camp in a tent, or in a shelter, or in a tent inside a shelter. Inland campsites do not have shelters and some campsites only have 1 or 2 shelters, so always pack a tent on Isle Royale as the shelter is not a sure thing. Check out this blog post on our favorite campsites and shelters on the island as we have visited nearly everyone of them.\n\nA campsite at South Lake Desor, Isle Royale\n\nA shelter at Moskey Basin, Isle Royale\n\nA shelter at Daisy Farm, Isle Royale\n\nRock Harbor Trail\n\nMe and my hiking buddy looking back down Rock Harbor, Isle Royale National Park\n\n​Key features:\n\n-Some areas are wet\n\n- Some boardwalks\n\n-Rocky uneven surfaces on first three miles\n\n​-May be the most used trail in park\n\n- Multiple camping options\n\n- Views of Rock Harbor\n\nRock Harbor Trail between Moskey & Daisy, Isle Royale National Park\n\nRock Harbor Trail near 3 mile campground, Isle Royale National Park\n\nSussy cave between Rock Harbor and 3 mile, Isle Royale National Park\n\nThe view from Moskey Basin, Isle Royale National Park\n\nThe trail near 3 mile, Isle Royale National Park\n\nRock Harbor Trail\n\nThe main thoroughfare of the island, the Rock Harbor Trail is most hikers' launching point for a week of adventure. Mostly rocky, this path takes on very different personalities depending on which section you are hiking. At times, it is an easy stroll, while at others it is a rugged rock climb. Most of the trail maintains views of the harbor, but a few sections pull in and climb some rocky outcroppings and into the forest. The views are perhaps what most consider \"classic\" Isle Royale.\n\nRock Harbor Trail: Rock Harbor to Daisy Farm\n\nThe Rock Harbor to Daisy Farm section of the Rock Harbor Trail embarks from the Rock Harbor Visitor Center and is one of the most well maintained sections of trail in the park. The trail begins as a nice walk in the woods until taking a turn leading to the rocky shores of Lake Superior. The deep blue waters churn in the wind and the craggily pines show wear and tear from the harshness of the northern winters. Rocky outcropping angle toward the waters edge and are streaked with low shrubs and lichens. In springtime, small wildflowers precariously hang to the cracks in the boulders offering hikers an occasional splash of purples, pinks, and yellows against the grayish backdrop of the basalt. Some people might find these steps angles difficult on their ankles and feet, but with fresh feet this impact is often unnoticed until the next day.\n\nAfter the first mile, you will be in near constant view of the lake while navigating these rocky outcrops. About 1.8 miles from Rock Harbor, the Suzy'’s Cave turn off appears. This is a remnant of an ancient sea cave. This is worth checking out on your first visit to the island. Continuing on for another mile and a half over the rocky out crops to reach the three mile campground this trail remains fairly dry and navigable.\n\nThe 3 Mile campground is the first stopping off point for some backpackers after the long journey to get to the island. However, most backpackers press on to Daisy Farm for their first night. From here, the trail levels out and becomes a flat, muddy scramble in areas. The mud of Isle Royale is a deep black tar like substance, but is usually never very deep. Rock hopping and tree limb balancing acts can be required after rains or in early spring. In lucky spots, the trail crews have installed boardwalks to bypass these hazards, but there often seems to be no rhyme or reason to where these have been located. Daisy Farm is the largest campsite with 16 shelters and is a common jumping off point for many hikers. Even in the shoulder season, it can fill up quickly due to its location and proximity to starting or finishing your adventure.\n\nRock Harbor Trail: Daisy Farm to Moskey Basin\n\nThis section of trail is unlike the first two section of the Rock Harbor trail and is not usually combined in to a single hike like the first two sections of the Rock Harbor Trail are. A Hike from Moskey to Rock Harbor is doable but it is long. This section of the trail lacks the lake views and cool breezes found on the previous two sections. This section is rocky and has numerous small ups and downs, some of them steep and on smooth rock. This section is typically dry and water is not available anywhere on this trail. Once you reach the Intersection with the Lake Richie Trail in is only a quick bridge crossing ans short walk into the popular Moskey Basin campground.\n\nThe trail can be rocky and rough between Rock Harbor and 3 mile campground, Isle Royale National Park\n\nThe Rock Harbor Trail gets wet between 3 mile and Daisy Farm, Isle Royale National Park\n\nRock Harbor Trail West of Daisy Farm, Isle Royale National Park\n\nMinong Trail\n\nTypical views along the Minong, Isle Royale National Park\n\n​Key features:\n\n-The hardest trail in the park\n\n-A thirty mile multiday backpack is required to complete it\n\n-Some sections can by doubled up by strong backpackers\n\n​-The surface ranges from knobby rock to soft dirt\n\n-The trail is very up and down\n\n​-It will require multiple beaver dam crossings\n\nAn easy section of the Minong Trail, Isle Royale National Park\n\nWalking the Minong Trail looking for the next cairn, Isle Royale National Park\n\nA beaver dam crossing on the Minong Trail, Isle Royale National Park\n\nA little Todd Campsite along the Minong Trail, Isle Royale National Park\n\nSome of the many ups and downs of the Minong Trail, Isle Royale\n\nMinong Trail\n\nThe Minong Trail has been called the most challenging trail in the Midwest by some. If you talk to a park ranger on Isle Royale, they will most likely gently guide you toward an easier trail. That said, if you are in good shape, experienced and prepared, you can most likely backpack this trail. The trail is very up and down in sections, very rocky in sections, and not as maintained as other trails in the parks. On a single, 6 mile section, we crossed over 76 different trees that had fallen across the trail. Yes, trail crew will get to this, but it is last on their list of trails to maintain. If you choose to backpack the Minong, do your homework and be prepared.\n\nMinong Trail from McCargo to Todd Harbor\n\nThe Minong Trail begins as clearly marked and wide as any trail you’d expect on Isle Royale. It continues on for .8 of a mile until it get near the sites of the old copper mines. Many visitors stop to explore this area. Just after this point, the Minong transitions into what this trail is best known for: a series of short, ups and downs along rocky ridges and deep, lush forests. While often times you are not gaining huge amounts of elevation, these changes occur very frequently. While on the rocky ridge tops, many opportunities abound to view the Canadian shore and Gitchigoomee. Occasionally rocky sections are marked with cairns, so it helps to keep a sharp lookout. As in all ridgetop trails on Isle Royale, expect hotter conditions and little to no access to water. The last mile of this trail departs the rocky ridges and descends toward Todd Harbor. During this descent, an astute hiker will notice the changes in vegetation and feel the temperature shift as you approach the cold waters of the big lake. The last obstacle hikers will encounter on the trail before reaching Todd harbor is a 4-5 foot wide deep creek that lacks a permanent structure or bridge. After crossing this creek, you are within 100 paces of the Todd Harbor campground.\n\nMinong trail from Todd to Little Todd\n\nThis section of trail was much like McCargo to Todd Harbor. The trail was easy to follow, and for the most part a soft dirt and not too rocky. The trail did have many ups and downs, while not large the trail seemed to never be level. The most notable part of this sections was very industrious beaver family that had made several dams that resulted in several small terraced ponds. Luckily, the trail passed just behind a beaver dam; however, some hikers miss this detail and end up crossing the dam when it is unnecessary. As you near the intersection with the Little Todd campground spur, the trail drops rapidly down a few switch back and then comes to a significant creek to cross. In the spring, it looked to be 15 feet wide and 1-2 ft deep; however, later in the season it may be much smaller. The park service had a red ribbon or two showing us where the trail was on the other side. We were able to cross this obstacle and keep our feet dry by walking across two different logs. It was a shaky crossing and the logs were not too solid, but we made it. Hiking poles would be a real help crossing this creek. After crossing a marshy area and then a short uphill, we came to the Little Todd campground trail spur, This half mile spur to Little Todd was very marshy and was slow going stepping from log to log to avoid the worst of the spongy black mud. However, Little Todd was worth the effort with it's personal fire rings and North Shore views.\n\nMinong from Little Todd to North Desor\n\nThe Minong wastes little time jumping up to rocky ridges after it passes the turn off to Little Todd. The trail crosses grayish black rock that is often on an angle. The rock is rarely gravely or loose, but instead is a solid piece that looks to be randomly cast into odd and angular shapes. At times, a square chunk is in just he right place to boost you up to the next ledge. At other times, triangular slopes makes footing unsure. During the course of this section of trail, it is estimated that we went up and over over 14 rocky outcrops. The trail atop these outcrops was marked with cairns, however, often times these cairns lacked much size or structure due to the fact that the trail is one giant rock. Downed trees are common on this trail and often require work arounds, as are large clumps of juniper which has overlapped the trail obscuring it from view in several sections. As in other section of this trail, the views of the big lake and Canada are amazing at times. AS the trail begins to move away from the pine and cedar trees and the forest transitions to sugar maples, you will approach the turn off for the North Lake Desor campground.\n\n​Minong Trail from North Lake Desor to Windigo\n\nAfter the slightly but uphill and smooth and soft trail headed out of Lake Desor, the Greenstone once again was a series of ups and down over clunky gray basalt ridges offering uneven and uncomfortable footing. However, as expected on this ridge, the views are outstanding. This continues for slightly more than a mile, then unexpectedly dipped slightly and began a long section of trail through the birches, aspen, and maples that was cool, shady, and rock free. During this section, it was easy to make up for lost time. As the trail progress you will still encounter an occasional a rocky section or hump, but never in long continuous stretches like prior on the trail. The trail crossed two swampy sections that are clearly marked with flags of orange and red by the NPS. Eventually the trail will come to one of three beaver dams you have to cross. After reading many accounts from online, we were expecting the worst, but found the beaver dam wide enough that moose prints were found in the mud crossing it.\n\nThe trail eventually dipped to cross the large swampy area on the Minong Trail. This was the one and only boardwalk on the whole trail, but was quite new and luxurious. If it had not been there, we could see how it would be disastrous to hikers and cause them to wade through knee deep mucky waters. The trail continued to pass through 2 more drainages, each with a beaver dam to cross. Neither beaver dam was much of an obstacle and seemed anticlimactic after all of the other obstacles along this trail. Washington Creek lies ahead and the trail will follow it for several miles, leading up to an intersection with he Huginnin Trail. Further on you will connect with the campground on your way into Windigo proper. These last sections were smooth and easy walking, but felt incredibly longer than anticipated after hiking so long all day.\n\nAt times the Minong Trail is bare rock, Isle Royale\n\nA small creek just before Todd Harbor on the Minong Trail, Isle Royale\n\nThe only board walk on the Minong cross a deep section swamp a few miles from Windigo, Isle Royale\n\nGreenstone Trail\n\nThe Greenstone Ridge, Isle Royale National Park\n\nKey features:\n\n- Outstanding views in many locations\n\n- One of the dryer trails\n\n- Bring water, it many not be readily available\n\n- Around 36 miles in length\n\n-A multiday backpack will be required to complete it\n\n- The main highway through the park\n\nOne of the few wet areas on the Greenstone, Isle Royale\n\nThe Ishpeming Fire tower lack the great views of others, Isle Royale\n\nA stone bench on the Greenstone, Isle Royale\n\nBlue bead flower along the Greenstone, Isle Royale\n\nThe typical Greenstone trail on the west in of the island, Isle Royale\n\nGreenstone Trail\n\nThe Greenstone Trail is the premiere long distance hike on the island, covering approximately 36 miles up the backbone of the island. To truly cover the entire trail, hikers must be willing to commit sometime on the island or coordinate their entry/exit points carefully. Most hikers will use the Rock Harbor Trail to 3 Mile Campground and leave out the eastern tip- where it truly ends or begins depending upon perspective. Taking a water taxi to Lookout Louise Trail and up to the the start of the Greenstone will allow a backpacker to see the whole trail. This first section of trail is not as heavily traveled as other parts and is a good area for moose sightings.\n\nFull disclosure... we have not hiked the Greenstone from end to end even though we have visited the island four separate times and have hiked a numerous chunks of it. Unless you plan to hike it end to end, you are frequently just utlizing chunks of the Greenstone. We have only included information on the sections we have hiked in this website. Based on what we have hiked so far, we have found the trail as a whole is well maintained and easy to follow it has a fair number of ups and downs in the sections we hiked but these are long gradual grades and not too tough compared to others on the island.\n\n​Greenstone (Daisy Farm to East Chicken Bone)\n\nThe Greenstone Trail was a smooth and easy walk compared to many other trails in the park. It acts as the main highway from one end of the park to the other. As can be expected on any highway, the travel for the most part is easy. The trail is smooth, well worn and easy to follow. However, it is high up on the ridge and offers less sun protection, warmer temperatures, and unreliable water sources at best. Much to our surprise this trip, we encountered a beaver who built a damn over one of the boardwalks in one of the lower section, causing us to have to reroute and path find through rough, wet terrain. The Greenstone Trail twists and rapidly looses elevation as it dips down toward the Chicken Bone intersection. One key feature of the Greenstone is the change in flora, with towering white birches swaying in the wind. These stark white trunks and green tops contrast the blue skies and make for a picturesque walk. Note it can be very hot and dry up on the Greenstone Trail.\n\n​Greenstone from Island Mine to Ishpeming Point Fire Tower\n\nCompared to many of the other trails on the island, this portion of the Greenstone was a smooth, soft walk through the forest. The trail was wide and rarely muddy and free of rocks and roots that plague so many of the other trails. Only on rare occasion did it crest up onto the ridge onto bare rock. The vast majority of the time, you walked through a lush maple and birch forest with a low undergrowth. At no point was the trail brushy or hidden. While the Greenstone has many ups and downs, these elevation changes were for the most part very gradual. Even the drop down to the intersection with the turnoff with Lake Desor South was not very steep. Likewise, climbing out of this valley up out of this ridge, while a long a steady climb and somewhat more marshy, was unremarkable. Eventually, you will reach the Ishpeming fire tower. This fire tower is much short than others we have encountered on the island and lacks any view due to the trees that have grown up around it. Overall, we found this section of the Greenstone to be fast and easy backpacking and a good place to get some miles in.\n\nA beaver build its dam right over the board walk, Greenstone trail, Isle Royale\n\nThe other side of the trail entering the beaver pond, Greenstone, Isle Royale\n\nThe Green Stone and Lane Cove Trail Intersection, Isle Royale National Park"
