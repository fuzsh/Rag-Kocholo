LOCATION\n\nMichigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota, USA; and Ontario, Canada. 46:5-48:0N, 84:0-92:5W; 183 m above sea level.\n\nB. DESCRIPTION\n\nLake Superior is the second largest lake in the world next to the Caspian Sea, and has more surface area than any other freshwater lake. Its surface area (82,367 km2) is larger than the State of Maine. The lake was formed approximately 14,000 years ago by the retreat of continental ice-sheet together with the other Great Lakes. It is surrounded by hills and cliffs which offer the most spectacular landscape of any of the Great Lakes. The largest island, Isle Royale, is a United States National Park.\n\nThe Apostle Islands of Wisconsin are now a National Lakeshore, with beautiful scenery and geological features. The long, hooked arm of the beautiful Keweenaw Peninsula is also a National Lakeshore of Michigan. The lake water flows out to L. Huron through the St. Mary's River from the eastern end.\n\nThere are no large cities along the Canadian northern shore of this lake except for Thunder Bay, Ontario. Twin cities, Duluth and Superior, are situated at the western end of the lake. A large amount of ore and grain is loaded for transport abroad in the harbors of these cities. The 1,900 km journey from Duluth, Minnesota, to Kingston, Ontario, is the longest inland water transportation route in the world. The lake water is still oligotrophic and transparency at the centre of the lake is generally around 9m.\n\nC.

Ice formation in Lake Superior begins in November; however, it never freezes shore to shore. The ice normally begins to break up in April but may not be completely melted until May. Mixing type: Dimictic. Notes on water mixing and thermocline formation Thermocline generally develops January-March and July-September. Mixing efficiency to lake bottom is fairy low due to great depth. Thermal cycle is similar throughout the lake but with variations resulting from differences in latitude and depth. While the water temperature in the lake is nearly homothermous from November to late May, slight inverse stratification often occurs in middle winter. Thermal stratification in Lake Superior begins to occur in early or middle July.\n\nE. LAKE WATER QUALITY (Q, 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14, 15, 23, 30)\n\nE1 TRANSPARENCY [m] Nearshore, 1973*: 8.5 (0.5-15).

Supplementary notes on the biota Phytoplankton assemblages originally dominated by diatoms have been altered dramatically, first from oligotrophic diatoms to more eutrophic diatoms and more recently, from diatom dominated assemblages to phytoplankton assemblages with increasing proportions of blue-green and green algae has occurred (Conway et al., 1977; Schelske et al., 1976; Stoermer et al., 1974; Schelske and Stoermer, 1971). Phytoplankton growth is phosphorus limited and increased inputs of this nutrient have stimulated growth of diatoms to the extent that, in summer, silica becomes the limiting nutrient. The result is that the phytoplankton assemblages are shifting from diatoms to physiological forms of phytoplankton which do not require silica (Schelske and Stoermer, 1972).\n\nF3 PRIMARY PRODUCTION RATE Carbon fixation rates [mg C m-3 day-1] 1973 Open water: 0.37 EO.18.

DETERIORATION OF LAKE ENVIRONMENTS AND HAZARDS\n\nI1 ENHANCED SILTATION (Q) Extent of damage: Not serious. Supplementary notes Local siltation in Duluth/Superior harbor and in Thunder Bay from mining. High water levels (1987) have led to increased siltation in some shoreline areas due to shore erosion. Presently, the problem is not serious, because the area is very lightly farmed and there is little open area; however, it could become serious if not controlled.\n\nI2 TOXIC CONTAMINATION Present status (Q): Detected but not serious.

The U.S. standards are: PCB 2 mg kg-1 DDT 5 mg kg-1, Dieldrin 3 mg kg-1 and mercury 1 mg kg-1 (Federal limit) and 0.5 mg kg-1 (State limit).\n\nRestrict consumption Do not eat Important* Lake Superior (applies to Michigan, Wisconsin and Lake Trout up to 30\" Lake Trout over 30\" Minnesota waters)\n\n* Nursing mothers, pregnant women, women who anticipate bearing children, and children age 1 and under should not eat the fish listed in any of the categories listed above.\n\nEnvironmental quality standards for contaminants in the lake (Q) IJC 1978 Agreement objectives are \"no-effect levels, for the protection of aquatic life, human consumers of fish, or fish-consuming aquatic birds.\" Objectives have been recommended for approximately 40 organic and inorganic chemicals, including persistent toxic substances, nonpersistent toxic substances, physical materials, microbiological and radiological contaminants. Examples of specific objectives include: Dieldrin, less than 0.001 micro g l-1 in water and less than 0.3 mg kg-1 in edible portions of fish; DDT and metabolites, less than 0.003 micro g l-1 in water and 1.0 mg kg-1 in fish ; PCB should not exceed 0.1 mg kg-1 in fish, while the mercury content of filtered water should be less than 0.2 micro g l-1 and 0.5 mg kg-1 in fish flesh. Supplementary notes (Q, 37) Critical pollutants in the Great Lakes ecosystem include: PCB, 2, 3, 7, 8-TCDD, mirex, 2, 3, 7, 8-TCDF, hexachlorobenzene, benzo-a-pyrene, dieldrin, alkylated lead, DDT and metabolites, toxaphene, and mercury. The worst problems associated with contaminated sediments occurs in bays, harbor mouths and connecting channels. For example, the sediments in some of the drainage ditches emptying into Waukegan Harbor near Chicago contain as much as 500,000 mg/kg PCB. Heavy urban and industrial development and use of connecting channels as a transportation corridor have contributed to the degradation of the water quality of the St. Mary's River connecting Lake Superior and Lake Michigan. Past experience with persistent toxic chemicals such as PCB, DDT, mercury, dieldrin and mirex show that once they are introduced into an aquatic ecosystem, they are extremely difficult to remove, especially in sediments which become a source for their remobilization into the water column. Therefore, the emphasis of regulatory officials has been directed toward preventing their release and the development of effective and efficient responses to identified problems. Both the United States and Canada monitor atmospheric deposition for a range of organic chemicals and heavy metals of concern to the Great Lakes Ecosystem. An estimated 20% to 25% of the pollutants into the Great Lakes come from atmospheric fallout. The latest data relative to the total deposition of airborne trace metals and organics are attached. No effective countermeasures have been implemented to date. Total deposition of airborne trace substances to Lake Superior [metric tons year-1](28).\n\nMetal Total deposition Zn 8,210 Pb 1,230 Cu 821 Cd 82 Ni 328 Fe 8,210 Al 14,000 Mn 1,640\n\nSubstance Total deposition Total PCB 9.8 Total DDT .58 alfa-BHC 3.3 ganmma-BHC 15.9 Dieldrin .54 HCB 1.7 p,p'-methoxychlor 8.3 apfa-endosulfan 7.9 beta-endosulfan 8.0 Total PAH 163 Anthracene 4.8 Phenanthrene 4.8 Pyrene 8.3 Benzo (a) anthracene 4.1 Perylene 4.8 Benzo (a) pyrene 7.9 DBP 16 DEHP 16 Total organic carbon 200,000\n\nOther hazards include the input of toxic inorganic and organic chemicals from municipal point sources, combined sewer overflows, rural and urban nonpoint sources and leachates from municipal and hazardous waste landfill disposal sites. Problems from these sources are most apparent in highly industrialized harbors and embayments and nearby areas. The IJC areas of concern include locales where environmental degradation and impairment of beneficial uses is severe and those where some environmental degradation is obvious and where uses may be impaired. The Lake Superior areas of concern are attached.\n\nFig. NAM-04-15\n\nAreas of concern in Lake Superior.\n\nI3 EUTROPHICATION Nuisance caused by eutrophication (Q) Others: Not a significant problem except in urban areas, bays and river mouth.\n\nI4 ACIDIFICATION Extent of damage (Q): No information. Kinds of damage (Q ) Evidence of damage to Lake Superior from acidic deposition is not discernable at this time. Supplementary notes (Q) Data relating the amount of airborne acid deposition and stream effect are highly variable depending on the total stream alkalinity. For very soft water streams in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan (i.e., alkalinity less than 10 mg l-1 as CaCO3), pH decreases of 1 to 2 units (from stream pH values of 7 or 8 to 6 or 7) have been observed in the headwaters area. To date, no studies have demonstrated detectable ecosystem trends which can be totally ascribed to acidification. The effects of increased acidic deposition, especially over terrestrial watershed with little alkaline character, may be more discernable. Mean monthly value of pH (Washington Creek, Isle Royale National Park, 1967- 1980)(58).\n\nMonth O F M M J J A S 7.28 7.47 7.41 7.20 7.33 7.57 7.38 7.19\n\nBecause of its size, Lake Superior possesses a large buffering capacity and apparently is able to neutralize the airborne acid deposition it receives. Consequently, Lake Superior doesn't appear to be directly affected. This is not true for many of the streams and tributaries and smaller lakes that surround and feed Lake Superior and the other Great Lakes.\n\nJ.
