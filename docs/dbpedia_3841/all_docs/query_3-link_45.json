In this guide, we’ll go over everything you need to know to plan your trip, including how to get to Isle Royale, where to stay in the park, what to do once you’re there, costs, Isle Royale itineraries, and more!\n\nNational Parks these days are crowded. But what if I told you there is still one park out there where crowds aren’t a thing, where you can see more wildlife than people on the hiking trails, and where solitude is practically a guarantee. Sound good? We thought so…\n\nLet us introduce you to Isle Royale National Park.\n\nYou may not have heard much about it. Maybe because it’s the least visited National Park in the lower 48. And maybe because it gets overshadowed by many of the more “epic” parks like Zion and Yosemite. But that’s a-okay with us, because this means that this remote island wilderness remains a crowd-free hidden gem where you can really find solitude in nature.\n\nAll of Isle Royale National Park is designated wilderness. It’s so isolated that you can’t take cars here, and there are no roads. The only way to get around the park is by boat or on foot. While this helps to make it a place we absolutely love, it also makes the park a bit complicated to get to. In fact, figuring out the best way to get to Isle Royale National Park was the hardest part of planning our trip there! With multiple different transportation options that all have different schedules, costs, and departure and arrival locations, figuring out how to get to Isle Royale is a bit daunting.\n\nBut we want to make the planning process easier for you! In this guide, we’ll go over exactly how to get to Isle Royale National Park, and break down and compare all the options for you in one place. We’ll also give you more general information for planning your trip, including where to stay, places to go in Isle Royale, what to bring, how much time you need in Isle Royale, and more, which will all help you in figuring out which way to get to Isle Royale is best for you.

Interested to know more about Isle Royale before booking your ferry tickets? Learn all about things to do in Isle Royale National Park in our complete guide!\n\nWhere is Isle Royale National Park?\n\nBefore you figure out how to get to Isle Royale National Park, it’s helpful to know where it is! Isle Royale is actually an archipelago of over 400 islands located in the middle of Lake Superior. The main island that most visitors will go to that has all the facilities, visitor centers, and hiking trails is an island that’s about 50 miles long and just 9 miles wide. This island is technically a part of Michigan, but it sits closer to Minnesota. You can get to Isle Royale from either Michigan or Minnesota, but we’ll get to that in just a bit…\n\nIsle Royale National Park map\n\nWe wanted to include this map of Isle Royale to orient you a bit to the island and where the main areas are.\n\nThere are two main areas in Isle Royale where most people will visit when they go to Isle Royale.\n\nRock Harbor is on the eastern end of Isle Royale and is kind of the main hub of the island. Here, you’ll find a visitor center, lodging, a restaurant, tours, boating services, a campground, and the start of several hiking trails and backpacking trips.\n\nWindigo is on the western end of Isle Royale and is a bit more quiet and laid back than Rock Harbor, mostly because there isn’t as many services and facilities here. Here, you’ll find a visitor center, a small campstore with basic supplies and snacks, a campground, boat services, and limited lodging. While both Rock Harbor and Windigo felt remote, quiet, and isolated, Windigo felt even more so, and truly gave off “on an island in the middle of nowhere” vibes.\n\nMost people will visit either Rock Harbor or Windigo on their visit to Isle Royale, since they are located on opposite ends of the island, about 50 miles away from each other. Each has their own transportation options from the mainland, so deciding which part of Isle Royale you want to visit will help you narrow down what way you choose to get to Isle Royale National Park.\n\nWe’ll go over things to do in both Rock Harbor and Windigo and which is best in a bit, but first let’s go over the big question and the most important part of your trip planning…how do I get to Isle Royale National Park?\n\nHow to Get to Isle Royale National Park\n\nOf all the National Parks we’ve been to so far, figuring out how to get to Isle Royale has been one of the most complicated. But trust us when we say that it’s totally worth all the hassle. Plus, after it’s all broken down and you look at all the information in one place, it’s not so bad…so that’s what we want to do for you here!\n\nWhen deciding on the best way to get to Isle Royale National Park, there are a couple of questions you need to ask yourself:\n\nHow long do I want to spend on Isle Royale?\n\nHow long am I willing to travel to get to Isle Royale?\n\nHow much am I willing to spend to get to Isle Royale?\n\nWhich part of Isle Royale do I want to go to?\n\nWhat time of year will I be travelling to Isle Royale?\n\nDepending on your answer to these questions, you can narrow down your Isle Royale transportation options to fit your plans. We hope as you read through this guide it will help you answer these questions!\n\nWays to Get to Isle Royale\n\nThere are three main ways to get to Isle Royale National Park:\n\nIsle Royale ferry – There are four different options for ferries to get to Isle Royale that leave from different locations and have different schedules. This is a common way to get to Isle Royale because it’s the most cost-effective.\n\nIsle Royale seaplane – There are a few different departure points for seaplanes going to Isle Royale. It’s definitely the quickest option for getting to Isle Royale, but also definitely the most expensive.\n\nPrivate boat – If you have your own boat in the area, you can avoid public transportation and head there yourself!\n\nThe ferry is definitely the most common way to get to Isle Royale, followed by seaplane, as many people don’t have or will bring their own personal boat to the island, but we’ll talk about all the options of getting to Isle Royale here.\n\nOn top of the three ways of getting to Isle Royale, there are four different departure points from the mainland when using the ferry or sea plane: Houghton, Michigan; Copper Harbor, Michigan; Grand Portage, Minnesota; and Grand Marais, Minnesota.\n\nEach of these four places has their own set of transportation options when it comes to getting to Isle Royale, and each option has its own set of schedules, costs, and travel times. Let’s go over each option for how to get to Isle Royale National Park now.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE! Michigan and Minnesota are in different time zones! Michigan uses eastern time while Minnesota uses central time. So be sure to pay attention to the time zone listed on ferry and sea plane schedules for departure and arrivals! Since Isle Royale is in Michigan, all times there will be eastern time.\n\nHow to get from Houghton, Michigan to Isle Royale National Park\n\nTo get from Houghton to Isle Royale, you’ll have the option of taking a ferry or a seaplane.\n\nRanger III ferry\n\nThe Ranger III is the only National Park Service-operated ferry that goes to Isle Royale. It goes mainly to Rock Harbor, but once a month during the summer it makes a trip to Windigo and back.\n\nSchedule of the Ranger III ferry to Isle Royale\n\nThe Ranger III ferry to Isle Royale usually starts running at the very end of May, and ends mid-September. Currently it is operating from May 20th to September 13th, but check here for updated dates each year.\n\nGenerally, between these dates, the Ranger III ferry goes from Houghton to Rock Harbor on Tuesdays and Fridays, and then comes back from Isle Royale to Houghton on Wednesdays and Saturdays. However, one trip a month is designated for travel to Windigo instead Rock Harbor. See the specific dates for Windigo trips here.\n\nImportant note: Because of the schedule of the Ranger III ferry to Isle Royale, you cannot use this ferry to take a day trip to the island. The ferry always goes to Isle Royale and docks for the night before returning back to Houghton the next day. If you plan to use the Ranger III ferry to get to Isle Royale, your options for the number of days you spend in Isle Royale are:\n\n1 night/2 (very brief) days\n\n4 nights/5 days (if you choose to come on Tuesday and leave on Saturday)\n\n5 nights/6 days (if you choose to come on Friday and leave on Wednesday)\n\nOf course, you can stay in Isle Royale longer, but these are the minimum number of nights and days you would have to spend on the island if your sole means of transportation to Isle Royale was via the Ranger III ferry.\n\nYou can reserve a spot on the Isle Royale ferry and check availability for each date throughout the year. We found that not many dates sell out and we were able to easily make ferry reservations just a few days in advance of our trip.\n\nHow much is the Ranger III ferry to Isle Royale?\n\nA one way fare on the Ranger III ferry to Isle Royale is $80, so $160 for a round trip (children are less). You can also bring over a boat, canoe or kayak on the Ranger III for additional costs.\n\nA bonus for taking the Ranger III ferry to Isle Royale is that you won’t have to pay for parking…it’s free! The parking for all the other options for Isle Royale transportation can really add up, so this will definitely save you some money.\n\nHow long does it take to get to Isle Royale on the Ranger III ferry?\n\nThe ferry takes 6 hours to get to Isle Royale National Park (to both Rock Harbor and Windigo). It leaves Houghton or Isle Royale at 9 am EST and arrives in Isle Royale or Houghton at 3 pm EST.\n\nThis may sound like a long time, but it actually went by fairly quickly. From Houghton, the first hour or so is just leaving the Keweenaw Waterway, so I spent most of that time sightseeing off the deck of the ferry, which helped pass the time.\n\nA perk about taking the Ranger III ferry to Isle Royale is that since it is run by the park service itself, once you’re underway you get a full briefing and orientation to the park, and you can request and get any camping permits for your time in Isle Royale. This is super nice and convenient so that you can skip this process once you arrive on the island and just start your trip! This makes the otherwise long ferry ride go by pretty fast, too.\n\nIsle Royale seaplane\n\nThe second option to get from Houghton to Isle Royale is via seaplane.\n\nTaking the seaplane to Isle Royale definitely provides more flexibility for traveling to the island, but at a greater cost.\n\nFrom Houghton, you can fly to either Rock Harbor or Windigo on a round trip flight, or you can choose to be dropped off at one location and picked up from another. And you have more flexibility with the number of days you spend on Isle Royale because you can schedule flights on any day you’d like (depending on availability of course).\n\nSchedule of the Isle Royale Sea Plane from Houghton\n\nPlanes run to Isle Royale every day from May 21st to September 16th, giving you a lot of flexibility to get to Isle Royale. You could even plan a day trip by scheduling a same day round trip flight. Flights run every day at the following times:\n\nHoughton to Rock Harbor or Windigo: 8 am, 10 am, 2 pm, and 4 pm EST\n\nRock Harbor or Windigo to Houghton: 9 am, 11 am, 3 pm, and 5 pm EST\n\nHow much is the seaplane to Isle Royale?\n\nA one way trip to either Rock Harbor or Windigo costs $250, while a round trip flight to either, or a drop off at one and pick up at another is $360.\n\nYou’ll also have to pay to park your car at the seaplane lot, which is $6 per day.\n\nHow long does it take to fly to Isle Royale on a sea plane?\n\nIt will take about 40 minutes to get to Isle Royale by plane, a significant time savings from the ferry!\n\nHow to get from Copper Harbor, Michigan to Isle Royale National Park\n\nCopper Harbor lies at the tip of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula and is a good take off point for Isle Royale. To get to Isle Royale from Copper Harbor, you’ll take the Isle Royale Queen IV ferry. This ferry goes to Rock Harbor only, and not Windigo.\n\nSchedule of the Queen IV ferry to Isle Royale\n\nThis Isle Royale ferry operates from about May 15th to September 29th (can vary from year to year- be sure to check their website for current dates of operation), and the schedule changes depending on the time of year:\n\nMay 15th to June 2nd: Runs Mondays and Fridays\n\nJune 5th-June 30th: Runs Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays\n\nJuly: Runs every day except Wednesdays\n\nAugust 1st- September 9th: Runs every day (with some exceptions)\n\nSeptember 11th- September 29th: Runs Monday and Fridays\n\nOn days that the ferry runs, it makes a round trip, leaving Copper Harbor at 8 am EST and leaving Isle Royale back to Copper Harbor at 2:45 pm. So this ferry provides a bit more flexibility than the Ranger III, allowing you to pretty much stay as long as you need or want to on the island, even for just a day.\n\nREAD MORE: Looking to head to Isle Royale for just a day?

You can also pay to have any canoes, kayaks, or bikes taken over.\n\nYou’ll also have to pay for parking in their lot, which costs $10 per night ($50 max).\n\nHow long does it take to get to Isle Royale on the Queen IV ferry?\n\nThe trip to Isle Royale on this ferry is about 3 hours and 45 minutes. It leaves Copper Harbor at 8 am and arrives around 11:45 am in Rock Harbor.

Windigo is the most convenient place to go using this ferry as it is much closer to Minnesota than is Rock Harbor, but the major benefit of this Isle Royale ferry is that it entirely circumnavigates the main island over the course of two days, stopping at multiple points, including both Rock Harbor and Windigo, but also at several points in between. This is the only Isle Royale ferry that does this, and is a big advantage for people looking to do a point-to-point backpacking trip that begins or ends at a point that’s not Rock Harbor or Windigo. If you are looking to do this, you schedule one round trip service on the same ferry and get back to your starting part where your car is parked in Grand Portage.\n\nBecause it makes this circumnavigation of the island, the schedule of this Isle Royale ferry is a bit more complicated…\n\nSchedule of the Voyageur II ferry to Isle Royale\n\nThis Isle Royale ferry typically runs from early May to October. This year it is May 13th to October 1st, but check their site for current dates and schedules. The ferry makes an entire trip around Isle Royale in two days, stopping at Windigo, McCargoe Cove, Belle Island, Rock Harbor (where it stays overnight), Daisy Farm, Chippewa Harbor, Malone Bay, and back to Windigo before returning to Grand Portage.\n\nThe Voyageur II schedule looks something like this:\n\nThe first day of the ferry’s circumnavigation is the outbound route from Grand Portage to Windigo and along the north side of the island to Rock Harbor:\n\nLeaves Grand Portage: 7:30 am CDT\n\nArrives at Windigo: 9:30 CDT\n\nArrives at McCargoe Cove: 1:00 CDT\n\nArrives at Belle Island: 1:30 CDT\n\nArrives at Rock Harbor: 3:00 CDT\n\nThe next day of the trip is the inbound trip back to Grand Portage via the south side of the island from Rock Harbor:\n\nLeaves Rock Harbor: 8 am CDT\n\nArrives at Daisy Farm: 8:30 CDT\n\nArrives at Chippewa Harbor: 9 am CDT\n\nArrives at Malone Bay: 10 am CDT\n\nArrives at Windigo: 12:30 pm CDT\n\nArrives at Grand Portage: 3 pm CDT\n\nNote that since this ferry starts in Minnesota it runs on central time, even though Isle Royale is on eastern time!\n\nThe schedule of the outbound and inbound trips varies depending on the time of year.\n\nFrom May 13th- May 28th, outbound trips are Wednesdays and Saturdays, while inbound trips are Thursdays and Sundays.\n\nThis means that taking this ferry to Windigo this early on in the season means you can either spend 2 days/1 night in Windigo, or you would have to spend either 4 or 5 nights minimum before the next inbound ferry comes back around to pick you up.\n\nFrom May 29th to September 17th, outbound trips are Monday, Wednesday, and Saturdays, while inbound trips are Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays. So there is a bit more flexibility here with the number of days you can spend on Isle Royale.\n\nFor the rest of the season, outbound/inbound trips are only on Wednesdays and Thursdays, meaning you’d have to spend either one night on the island, or a full week.\n\nDay trips with the Voyageur II: There are select weekends at the end of the season where this Isle Royale ferry runs a day trip from Grand Portage to Windigo and back. This year, those dates are September 23rd, 24th, 30th, and October 1st. They depart Grand Portage at 8 am CDT, arriving in Windigo at 10 am CDT and departing back to Grand Portage at 1 pm CDT, so you would have about 3 hours to spend on the island.\n\nHow much does the Voyageur II ferry to Isle Royale cost?\n\nA one way trip from Grand Portage to Windigo is $87. Going from Grand Portage beyond Windigo and up to Rock Harbor is $110 (children are less). You can also pay extra to transport any canoes or kayaks with you.\n\nIf you do one of the day trips offered in the fall, the rate is only $99 round trip instead of paying two separate and higher one way fares!\n\nYou’ll also have to pay for parking here, which is $5 per day.\n\nHow long does it take to get to Isle Royale on the Voyageur II ferry?\n\nFrom Grand Portage to Windigo, it only takes two hours on the ferry. If you want to go all the way to Rock Harbor, it will take 7.5 hours, which is why Minnesota is the best starting point for Windigo trips rather than Rock Harbor trips.\n\nThe Sea Hunter III ferry to Isle Royale\n\nThe Sea Hunter is the second option to get from Grand Portage to Isle Royale. This Isle Royale ferry goes to Windigo only, so is a bit less complicated.\n\nSchedule of the Sea Hunter III ferry to Isle RoyALe\n\nThis ferry doesn’t start running until a little later in the season. This year’s dates are June 7th to September 2nd (check their site for any updates, changes, and schedules).\n\nFrom June 7th-July 8th, and from August 16th to September 2nd, the ferry runs round trips from Grand Portage to Windigo on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays.\n\nFrom July 12th to August 13th, the ferry runs round trips from Wednesdays to Sundays.\n\nEach day that it runs, this ferry leaves Grand Portage at 8:30 am CDT and arrives in Windigo at 10 am CDT. Then it leaves to head back to Grand Portage at 2 pm CDT.\n\nThis Isle Royale ferry makes it very easy to do day trips to Windigo, but you’ll only have about 4 hours to spend on the island. It’s also easy to do shorter overnight trips as well because of how often the ferry runs back and forth.\n\nHow much does the Sea Hunter III ferry to Isle Royale cost?\n\nThe one way fare from Grand Portage to Windigo on the Sea Hunter is $87. However, if you are only doing a day trip with the ferry and heading there and back on the same day, the total round trip fare is only $99!\n\nYou’ll also have to pay for parking here, which is $5 per day.\n\nHow long does it take to get to Isle Royale on the Sea Hunter III ferry?\n\nThe ferry ride from Grand Portage to Windigo is a quick 1.5 hours on the Sea Hunter III.\n\nHow to get from Grand Marais, Minnesota to Isle Royale National Park\n\nThe only option for getting from Grand Marais to Isle Royale is by seaplane (the same concessionaire that runs from Houghton). The seaplane is a quick but expensive option to get to the park, and from here, you can go to either Windigo or Rock Harbor. It’s easy to be flexible with your time on the island, because you can arrange for a day trip or any number of nights you wish, depending on availability of the flights.\n\nThe schedule for the Isle Royale seaplane\n\nThe seaplane runs daily from May 21st to September 16th. Your options for departure times are either 9 am CDT or 3 pm CDT from Grand Marais and 8 am CDT and 2 pm CDT from Isle Royale.\n\nYou can request a reservation for an Isle Royale seaplane here and will be booked based on availability for your requested dates and times.\n\nHow much does the seaplane to Isle Royale cost?\n\nFrom Grand Marais, one way trips are $230 to Windigo and $300 to Rock Harbor. Round trip fares are $340 and $440, respectively. You can also choose to be dropped off in one location and picked up in another, which would cost $390.\n\nParking at this location is free!\n\nHow long does it take to get from Grand Marais to Isle Royale on the sea plane?\n\nTo get from Grand Marais to Rock Harbor is about 45 minutes, and only 25 minutes from Grand Marais to Windigo.\n\nHow to get to Isle Royale National Park: A complete summary\n\nOkay, we know we hit you with a lot of information here, well, because figuring out how to get to Isle Royale can get complicated. But we hope we can simplify it all here for you by giving you a direct comparison of all the options for how to get to Isle Royale by ferry and seaplane. We’ll compare costs, travel times, points of departure and arrivals and more to help you decide which way to get to Isle Royale is best for you.\n\nHow to get to Isle Royale National Park- FAQs\n\nSince getting to Isle Royale is complicated, you might have a few more questions. Here are the most commonly asked ones!\n\nWhat is the cheapest way to get to Isle Royale?\n\nThe cheapest way to get to Isle Royale is on the Ranger III ferry out of Houghton, Michigan. It costs $160 round trip, and you don’t have to pay any parking fees. While it is the cheapest option, you pay in terms of travel time and flexibility…it takes 6 hours to get to the island, and your options for the number of nights you can stay on the island is limited due to the ferry schedule.\n\nAn even cheaper option is if you want to only do a day trip to Isle Royale and don’t mind only visiting Windigo. You can do a day trip for just $99 on the Voyageur II or Sea Hunter III out of Grand Portage, Minnesota. You’ll be limited to just 3-4 hours on Isle Royale, though.\n\nWhat is the shortest ferry ride to Isle Royale?\n\nThe shortest ferry to Isle Royale is 1.5 hours on the Sea Hunter III, which goes from Grand Portage, Minnesota to Windigo.\n\nHow much does it cost to take the ferry to Isle Royale?\n\nDepending on which ferry you take (there are 4!), you will pay between $80- $110 for a one-way fare. This still beats taking a seaplane, which starts at $230 for a one way trip!\n\nHow long is the ferry ride to Isle Royale?\n\nFrom Minnesota, the ferry to Windigo will take between 1.5 to 2 hours.\n\nFrom Michigan, the ferry to Rock Harbor will take about 3 hours and 45 minutes on the Queen IV, or 6 hours on the Ranger III.\n\nWhat should I bring onto the Isle Royale ferry?\n\nWe took the Ranger III ferry to Isle Royale, so can speak from experience here, but regardless of what ferry you take, be sure to read your booking confirmation and the associated website thoroughly, as these will tell you everything you need to know for taking the Isle Royale ferry.\n\nBefore we boarded the ferry, our packs were collected and stored below the boat, and they couldn’t be accessed at all during the ride, so make sure you take anything you’d want to have with you onto the ferry!\n\nIn our experience, you’ll definitely want to bring layers. If you want to stand outside on the deck to take in the views of the island as you approach (we highly suggest you do!), then you’ll want to have warm layers as it can get chilly out there!\n\nMake sure to bring snacks and drinks. When we went, the ferry had no onboard food services other than some hot tea and coffee.\n\nLastly, make sure to have your camera, and things to keep you busy, such as a book or park maps for planning.\n\nCan you drive to Isle Royale National Park?\n\nNope! You cannot take a car to Isle Royale. There are no roads or motor vehicles on the island and all transportation to and from the park is by boat and plane. Once you’re on the island, the only option of getting around from place to place is by boat, seaplane, or hiking.\n\nWhat is the closest major airport to Isle Royale National Park?\n\nDuluth International Airport in Minnesota is about 2 hours and 15 minutes from Grand Marais and almost 3 hours from Grand Portage, MN. If you want a closer airport, you can fly into Thunder Bay, but this is in Canada and would require passports and border crossings.\n\nSawyer International Airport in Michigan is about 2 hours and 15 minutes from Houghton and 3 hours from Copper Harbor. A closer regional airport is right in Houghton.\n\nHow to get to Isle Royale with a private boat\n\nIf you have your own boat in the area, then it’s much easier to get to Isle Royale without having to deal with arranging complicated public transportation. This isn’t the most common way people get to Isle Royale, but it is certainly possible. Plus, it will give you the most flexibility for coming and going as you please, and you can visit the park outside of public transportation operating dates, meaning you can visit Isle Royale completely crowd-free!\n\nBoaters can come in for the day and anchor at docks, or they can spend the night at boat-accessible campgrounds along Lake Superior.\n\nWe don’t have any experience with this but check out the National Park Service site for information for boating in the park, rules and regulations, where you can dock and anchor, permits, services, and more.\n\nHow to get around Isle Royale National Park\n\nSo, you’ve figured out the complicated transportation and made it to Isle Royale…yay!\n\nBut now the question becomes, how do you get around Isle Royale once you’re there? There are no cars or roads on the island, so where can you go?\n\nHere are your options for getting around Isle Royale:\n\nHiking: The main way to get around is on your own two feet! Tons of hiking trails start out of Rock Harbor and Windigo, and they can be connected in infinite ways to make a backpacking trip around or across the island. You can make it a loop and start and end in the same place, or you can do a point- to- point hike if you’ve arranged the proper transportation. For ideas on how to arrange transportation for a point-to-point hike, check our guide to hiking the Greenstone Ridge Trail, which goes from Rock Harbor to Windigo and requires a lot of transportation logistics.\n\nSeaplane: The Isle Royale seaplane offers inter-island travel between Windigo and Rock Harbor daily for $142 one way.\n\nFerry: The Voyaguer II circumnavigates the island and provides pick up and drop off at various locations. You can reserve a spot on this Isle Royale ferry to take you between Windigo and Rock Harbor and back, or to take you to a different drop off point where you can begin a backpacking trip to a different pick up point around the island. Be sure to make reservations in advance, as this ferry might not stop at a given location if there are not advanced reservations in place!\n\nWhere to Stay in Isle Royale National Park\n\nNow that you know how to get to Isle Royale, the next question is, where do you stay in Isle Royale?\n\nSince the island is all designated wilderness, there aren’t actually many accommodation options in Isle Royale, but there are plenty of opportunities for camping, which is what most visitors to Isle Royale do.\n\nWhere can you camp in Isle Royale National Park?\n\nThere are 36 campgrounds in Isle Royale National Park. Most of them are accessed via backpacking or by boat, however, there is one campground right in Rock Harbor, and one right in Windigo that can be accessed basically right from the ferry/seaplane docks. The thing to note about these Isle Royale campgrounds is that because they can be quite popular (since they are so accessible), they have limits on the number of consecutive nights you can stay at them. In Rock Harbor, you can only stay for one night, making your time quite limited here, but in Windigo you can stay for three consecutive nights.\n\nAll other campsites are in the backcountry and are accessed by backpacking or portaging, and some are located along Lake Superior and can be accessed by boat.\n\nLEARN MORE: Learn more about camping and backpacking in Isle Royale in our complete Isle Royale National Park backpacking guide!\n\nIsle Royale National Park lodging\n\nThere are two lodging options in Isle Royale – one in Rock Harbor and one in Windigo.\n\nThe Rock Harbor Lodge is the most substantial of the two. It offers several different kinds of accommodation, and has an on-site restaurant. It also offers tours and canoe/kayak rentals (though you don’t have to stay here to use these services). You can make a reservation in advance to stay here.\n\nIn Windigo, the lodging option is a bit less substantial. It consists of just two Camper Cabins, which are small rooms with mattresses, a couch, and table. You’ll still have to use outhouses outside, and there’s just an outdoor grill for cooking, so really, it’s a slightly glamorized version of camping.\n\nWays to Plan a Visit to Isle Royale\n\nGiven the type of transport to and around Isle Royale and the limited accommodations in the park, there are a few ways to plan your time in Isle Royale National Park.\n\nBackpack. Many people visit Isle Royale to go on a backpacking trip across the island. They arrive on the island and immediately set out on a hike to their first camp, and continue hiking from campsite to campsite until they leave on the ferry back to the mainland. Check out our Guide to Backpacking on Isle Royale to learn more about how to plan for an Isle Royale backpacking trip!\n\nDay hiking from base camp. If you’re not up for backpacking, it’s possible to set up a base camp on one side of the island (Rock Harbor or Windigo) and explore from there each day. People choose to camp right in Rock Harbor or Windigo, or stay in one of the lodging options, and then go on day hikes and tours or simply relax. Learn more about all our favorite day hikes in Isle Royale!\n\nDay trip. As you read above, some ferry options as well as the seaplanes allow for just a day trip to Isle Royale (either Windigo or Rock Harbor), so you can explore for a bit without having to worry about accommodation or camping on the island. Check out how to arrange transportation and how to plan your time with one day in Isle Royale.\n\nIs it better to visit Windigo or Rock Harbor on Isle Royale?\n\nThis is a tough question because we wouldn’t say that one area is better than the other! They both offer solitude and access to great hiking trails and viewpoints that make Isle Royale so special.\n\nIf you are looking for a bit more in the way of facilities and services, Rock Harbor may be better to visit. You can stay in a lodge, eat at a restaurant, and take tours around the area.\n\nIf you are looking for a bit more of a rugged feel, Windigo is the better place for this. The lack of facilities here really gives it a peaceful vibe, and it feels a bit less crowded here (although really, no place on the island ever feels crowded).\n\nTo help you decide if you’d rather visit Rock Harbor or Windigo, or maybe even both, let’s get into some of the top sights in Isle Royale in each area.\n\nThings to Do in Isle Royale National Park\n\nIf you’re thinking that there might not be a whole ton of things to do on a small island in the middle of Lake Superior, you might be kind of right. There isn’t a ton of activities to choose from, but what there is to do is more than worth the trip out here.\n\nWe have a whole separate guide on things to do in Isle Royale, so be sure to check that out, but we’ll go over the top sights in Isle Royale here to give you an idea of where you might want to visit!\n\nREAD NEXT: Check out all the best things to do in Isle Royale National Park!\n\nThings to do in Rock Harbor\n\nGo on a day hike. There are a handful of great day hike options that begin in Rock Harbor that take you along the moody rocky shoreline of Lake Superior, bring you up to beautiful viewpoints over the island and lake, and take you through marsh and swampland with opportunity for wildlife sightings (like moose and beavers!). Our favorites include the hike out to Scoville Point, and the hike to Mount Franklin.\n\nISLE ROYALE DAY HIKES: Check out our favorite day hikes on Isle Royale!\n\nGo backpacking. With 36 campgrounds connected by over 160 miles of trails, there are endless opportunities to connect these trails into an amazing backpacking route, whether you just want a quick overnight trip or one that lasts an entire week or more. One of the most popular backpacking routes in Isle Royale is the Greenstone Ridge Trail, which runs the entire length of the island and connects Rock Harbor to Windigo.\n\nLEARN MORE: Find out everything you need to know about backpacking in Isle Royale, including information on route planning, permits, and packing. If you’re interested in a point-to-point hike across the island, check out our complete guide on how to backpack the Greenstone Ridge Trail in Isle Royale National Park!\n\nTake a tour. The Rock Harbor Lodge offers a handful of different half day tours to places near Rock Harbor that you otherwise couldn’t access, including to nearby lighthouses.\n\nGo for a paddle. Rent a kayak or canoe from the Rock Harbor Lodge and paddle along the shores of Lake Superior or in Tobin Harbor.\n\nRelax! When you’re on an isolated island in total wilderness, there’s really nothing that beats just relaxing and taking a break from reality for a bit. Sit by Lake Superior and enjoy the sounds of the water lapping onto shore while you spot eagles flying overhead, or relax by the dock and watch the ferries come and go.\n\nThings to do in Windigo\n\nGo on a day hike. Like Rock Harbor, there are plenty of options for day hikes that take you both along the shore of Lake Superior and up to view points over the island.\n\nVisit the moose exclosure. This is a cool and unique sight on Isle Royale where a piece of land has essentially been blocked off from moose. It really showcases the effect that the moose population has had on the island!\n\nGo backpacking. A number of backpacking trails can be started in Windigo, including the Greenstone Ridge Trail.\n\nGo for a paddle. You can rent a kayak or canoe from the Windigo campstore. Use it to visit the nearby Beaver Island or to explore Washington Creek.\n\nRelax. Hang out by the dock and watch the seaplanes come and go. Or, hang out by Washington Creek and spot moose wading in the water or groups of otters swimming in the river.\n\nHow Many Days Do You Need For Isle Royale National Park?\n\nWhen you’re figuring out the best way to get to Isle Royale National Park, an important question to ask yourself is, how many days will I need in Isle Royale?\n\nYou can spend as little as a day in the park, or up to a week, and still find plenty to do… it really just depends on what you’re looking to do. If you want to just relax and see some of Isle Royale’s top sights, one to three days in Isle Royale is plenty. If you’re looking for an epic backpacking trip, you can spend five or more days hiking through the wilderness.\n\nISLE ROYALE ITINERARIES:\n\nFor more information on how to plan a day trip to Isle Royale and things to do with your limited time, check out our Isle Royale National Park Day Trip Guide.\n\nFor suggestions on Isle Royale itineraries for two to five days in the park, make sure to read our Things to Do in Isle Royale National Park Guide!\n\nWhen is the Best Month to Visit Isle Royale National Park?\n\nWell, first things first. Isle Royale National Park is only open from April 16th to October 31st every year. However, most public transportation to Isle Royale only operates between mid-May and September, giving you a small window of time that you can visit Isle Royale.\n\nThe busiest months on Isle Royale are definitely July and August, which is no surprise, as school breaks and warm summer weather coincide. Also, all the facilities and services on the island are up and running. During these months, you might be a little more hard pressed to find the solitude that you can get during other times of the year, and the park service warns that campsites may have to be doubled up to accommodate everyone. However, we have heard that despite crowded campsites, trails still tend to seem pretty empty.\n\nSpring in Isle Royale (May and early June) has its pros and cons. If you come really early (in May), not all facilities will be operational. For example, visitor centers may be closed or limited in their hours, the restaurant in Rock Harbor may not be open, and drinking water will not be available. Also in the spring, weather in Isle Royale can be unpredictable and variable, and you’ll have to be prepared for everything- cold nights, rain, wind, even snow. The trails may be pretty muddy, and you might also experience quite a bit of blowdown from the previous winter, as trail crews will not have had a chance to get out there to clear it up. Finally, spring, particularly June, but sometimes even in July, means bugs. And lots of them. Black flies and mosquitoes can get horrendous on the trails and at campsites. Trust us, we speak from experience!\n\nDespite all these cons to visiting Isle Royale in the spring, this is when we visited and we absolutely loved it and would do it again! We did experience the bugs, trail blowdown, and chilly nights, but what absolutely made up for it all was the fact that we barely saw anyone out there! The trails and campsites were basically empty, and we felt like we got a true wilderness experience. It’s what made Isle Royale so special for us.\n\nFall in Isle Royale (September to October) we would guess is a really great time to visit Isle Royale National Park. The weather may be a bit more unpredictable and cooler, but there will the same low crowds as in spring, but without the bugs and rougher trail conditions.\n\nWeather in Isle Royale\n\nSince it’s an island in the middle of the largest Great Lake, weather on Isle Royale can be a bit unpredictable, so always be prepared for rain, wind, and even snow if coming early or late in the season. Winter can be super harsh out here, which is why the island closes. Make sure to check conditions and weather forecasts before your trip so you can plan out your time and see if you need to make any changes. Weather and marine conditions can also delay or cancel your transportation out to Isle Royale, so just keep that in mind and be prepared to be flexible or have to cancel your trip altogether.\n\nIn spring, temperatures on Isle Royale are generally in the 50s-60s during the day and high 30s to 40s at night. In July and August, temperatures are generally in the 70s in the day and low 50s at night. In September, the temperatures quickly start cooling to 60s during the day and 40s at night and by October it drops to 50s in the day and 30s to high 20s at night.\n\nHow Much Does it Cost to Go to Isle Royale National Park?\n\nAfter everything is factored in, Isle Royale National Park can be quite an expensive park to visit. Just getting to Isle Royale will be the most expensive factor in your visit. As we talked about above, the ferry and/or seaplane costs can run you upwards of $160 or more, which is an unusually hefty price tag for a National Park!\n\nIn addition to the Isle Royale transportation costs, there are other costs associated with visiting Isle Royale National Park that can quickly add up.\n\nEntrance fees to Isle Royale National Park don’t work like most other National Parks. Instead of having one flat fee that lasts for a week, Isle Royale charges $7 per person per day on the island. You can pay this in advance online, which is preferred. Otherwise, you can pay at one of the visitor centers once you’re in Isle Royale. This is by credit card only.\n\nIf you are going to be in the park longer than a week over the course of the year, it might be best to get a season pass, which costs $60, and can be bought online as well.\n\nIf you plan on going to any other National Parks in the same year, we highly recommend getting a National Parks Annual Pass, which is just $80 and gets you into all parks throughout the year. This pass will cover up to four people’s daily fees in Isle Royale, so it will quickly start paying for itself if you plan on spending several days on the island.\n\nFortunately, permits to camp are free for small groups! If you have a group over 6 people, you’ll have to apply for a permit and pay $25.\n\nWhat Should I Bring to Isle Royale National Park?\n\nBecause you’ll be on a rugged island in the middle of Lake Superior with not much cell service or resources, you’ll have to come particularly prepared and self-reliant for this National Park. Here are some things we specifically recommend you bring to Isle Royale.\n\nWater bottle/water filter and/or purification system. The only two places with potable water in Isle Royale are in Rock Harbor and Windigo. If you plan on going for long hikes, or if you will be backpacking, be sure to pack something to filter and purify water with (the park recommends filtration along with chemical or UV treatment). All of the park’s campsites are next to a water source that you can filter from. Even if you just plan on staying in Rock Harbor or Windigo but come very early or late in the season, you’ll have to filter water as potable water will not be available then.\n\nFood. There is a restaurant in Rock Harbor, and a small campstore in Windigo with basic snacks, but many people bring food to Isle Royale since the options are limited, especially if they plan on hiking and backpacking. Also bring an adequate storage container for food and trash when hiking and backpacking on the trails. You don’t necessarily need a bear cannister or hard sided container for this, but the park recommends double bagging food and scented items to keep smaller critters out.\n\nFirst aid kit. Help can be far away if you happen to get injured on the trail, so make sure you have a first aid kit with basic supplies and the ability to treat minor and common injuries.\n\nSatellite phone or emergency device. If you will be backpacking into more remote places on the island, having a way to call for help is key, since you really will be in the middle of nowhere with not many other people on the trails.\n\nHiking boots. We would recommend shoes specifically for hiking as the terrain can be muddy, rocky, slippery, and rugged.\n\nLayers and rain gear. Definitely be prepared for cooler nights and any kind of weather.\n\nToilet paper. If you plan on camping, campsites have outhouses, but they may not always be stocked with toilet paper!\n\nBug spray and head net. If you’re coming in June and July especially, you’ll want bug spray. Trust us. They get pretty bad. Head nets will also be helpful if you plan on hanging out outside a lot at camp. Also, in the summer, the wasps apparently can be pretty bad, so if you’re allergic to stings, make sure you have any necessary precautions with you.\n\nBinoculars or a good zoom camera. There is lots of wildlife on Isle Royale! But it’s important that you keep your distance and give them space. Use binoculars or a high zoom lens to get those up close looks.\n\nPark map. The National Park service website has basic maps you can use to give you a general idea of trails/locations. The National Geopgraphic Isle Royale map has more detail regarding mileage and topopgraphy that we recommend you have if you plan on doing any substantial backpacking while in Isle Royale.\n\nBackpacking itinerary. If you plan on backpacking on Isle Royale, you will have to register with a ranger with a preplanned route. Come to the island with one in mind so that you can discuss with the ranger and grab a permit!

Very early in the season (May) and later (mid-September and after), this water may not be available, so it’s important to come prepared with some sort of water filter and/or purification system.\n\nIs there cell service on Isle Royale?\n\nCell service should basically be considered non-existent on Isle Royale. We loved it because we really felt disconnected! The only time we got a few bars was at a high point along the Greenstone Ridge Trail. While it’s nice to disconnect, it also means you have to be extra prepared for emergencies and be able to self-rescue from a trail if necessary. Help can be a long way away. It’s good to carry some sort of satellite phone or emergency device to contact help, but make sure to carry first aid with you to deal with any minor injuries or problems.\n\nAre there bears on Isle Royale?\n\nThere are no bears on Isle Royale! Instead, there are moose, wolves, beavers, otters, hares, birds, snakes, foxes, and other little critters. Always keep a safe and respectful distance from any wildlife, and while there aren’t bears and you don’t necessarily need a bear can on Isle Royale, make sure to store your food properly enough (in some sort of hard sided container or double bagged and secured ziplocks) to keep the other curious critters out!\n\nIs Isle Royale worth visiting?\n\nFiguring out how to get to Isle Royale and planning out your time there may seem complicated, but we promise you it’s totally worth it. Experiencing true solitude and peacefulness out in this remote island wilderness was really something special, and really makes it different from many other National Parks that have become very crowded. We left feeling like we truly got a much needed reset. But we’ll let this one fun fact speak for itself…\n\nIsle Royale may be the least visited National Park of the lower 48, but it is the most revisited National Park! Meaning, the few who do manage to experience Isle Royale find themselves coming back again and again. So there’s definitely something special about Isle Royale! It’s a true hidden gem and was quite an unexpected surprise for us…and by the end, we were quite surprised to find ourselves being among those who couldn’t wait to plan our next trip back!\n\nMore Information for Your Isle Royale National Park Trip\n\nIf you’re heading to Isle Royale, then check out all our other guides to help you plan!\n\nWHAT TO DO IN ISLE ROYALE – Check out all the best things to do in Isle Royale National Park, plus get some itineraries to help you plan your time!\n\nISLE ROYALE DAY TRIP – Only have one day to spend in the park?
