        "meta_description": "Abstract. The timing of the Laurentide Ice Sheet's final retreat from North America's Laurentian Great Lakes is relevant to understanding regional meltwater routing, changing proglacial lake levels, and lake-bottom stratigraphy following the Last Glacial Maximum. Recessional moraines on Isle Royale, the largest island in Lake Superior, have been mapped but not directly dated. Here, we use the mean of 10Â new 10Be exposure ages of glacial erratics from two recessional moraines (10.1âÂ±â1.1âka, one standard deviation; excluding one anomalously young sample) to constrain the timing of Isle Royale's final deglaciation. This 10Be age is consistent with existing minimum-limiting 14C ages of basal organic sediment from two inland lakes on Isle Royale, a sediment core in Lake Superior southwest of the island, and an estimated deglaciation age of the younger of two subaqueous moraines between Isle Royale and Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula. Relationships between Isle Royale's landform ages and Lake Superior bottom stratigraphy allow us to delineate the retreat of the Laurentide ice margin across and through Lake Superior in the early Holocene. We suggest that Laurentide ice was in contact with the southern shorelines of Lake Superior later than previously thought.",

        "text": "Following the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the southwest margins of the Labrador Dome of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) retreated, exposing the Laurentian Great Lakes of North America (hereafter referred to as âthe Great Lakesâ; Fig.Â 1). Initial retreat of the LIS from LGM margins in the Great Lakes region is associated with increased summer boreal insolation (Clark et al., 2009; Ullman et al., 2015), and much of meltwater from the melting LIS drained through the Great Lakes throughout the late Pleistocene and early Holocene (Carlson et al., 2007; Fisher, 2020; Teller and Thorleifson, 1983; Teller et al., 1983). Overall, meltwater from the LIS accounts for â¼â50â%â60â% of the late-Pleistocene sea-level budget (Clark and Mix, 2002). Constraining spatial and temporal retreat patterns of the LIS retreat, including along its southern margins through the Great Lakes, improves our understanding of meltwater routing from proglacial lakes to the oceans and proglacial lake organization (Breckenridge, 2013; Broecker, 2006; Broecker et al., 1989; Carlson et al., 2007; Farrand, 1969; Fisher, 2020; Fisher and Breckenridge, 2022; Leydet et al., 2018; Teller, 1990; Teller and Mahnic, 1988; Teller et al., 2002, 2005).\n\nAlthough previous work has investigated the age and rate of ice retreat through the Great Lakes region (Dalton et al., 2020; Dyke, 2004), geochronological constraints on the timing of ice retreat are sparse, especially within lake basins, and Dalton et al.Â (2020) note that the chronology of Laurentide ice retreat through the Great Lakes has not received as much attention by researchers as other margins of the LIS over the past 20Â years. The existing chronology of ice retreat from the Great Lakes is constrained primarily by minimum-limiting 14C ages, most of which come from the southern LGM margins of the LIS (Dyke, 2004; Dalton et al., 2020; Fig.Â 1). Additional constraints on the timing of ice retreat from the Great Lakes region include 10Be exposure-age dating (Fig.Â 1; Ceperley et al., 2019; Colgan et al., 2002; Leydet et al., 2018; Lowell et al., 2021; Ullman et al., 2015) and in some cases, optically stimulated luminescence burial-age dating (e.g., Fisher et al., 2020; Schaetzl et al., 2017). As a note, all ages in this study with units of calâkaâBP are published 14C calibrated ages and were rounded to the nearest 100Â years; none are significantly different than those recalibrated using CALIB rev.Â 8 (Stuiver and Reimer, 1993).\n\nLake Superior is the largest and northernmost of the Great Lakes and the largest freshwater lake by surface area in the world (IAGLR, 2012). Despite decades of geochronological efforts mapping ice margin positions across Lake Superior (e.g., Bajc et al., 1997; Black, 1976; Leydet et al., 2018; Lowell et al., 1999, 2005, 2009, 2021; Saarnisto, 1974), the long distances between shorelines and the paucity of dateable organic material retrieved from lake-bottom sediments has hampered development of a detailed history of LIS retreat across the lake (Breckenridge, 2007; Breckenridge et al., 2004; Hyodo and Longstaffe, 2011). Thus, uncertainties about LIS retreat across the lake following the LGM, and hence meltwater routing and proglacial lake organization, remain. Ice retreat from western Lake Superior appears to have been mostly continuous across the late-Pleistocene-to-Holocene transition (Lowell et al., 2021) with some clear exceptions of moderate ice re-advance during the Younger Dryas stadial (Carlson, 2010; Loope, 2006; Lowell et al., 1999, 2009). The timing of this advance, known as the Marquette Readvance, is well constrained at the Lake Gribben forest-bed site in Michigan's Upper Peninsula (UP) to â¼â11.9âcalâkaâBP (Fig.Â 2a; Lowell et al., 1999), and it is known to have produced the Grand Marais I moraine complex across the UP and the Marks moraine in Ontario (Fig.Â 2; Carlson, 2010; Hobbs and Breckenridge, 2011; Loope, 2006; Lowell et al., 1999, 2009). There is less agreement regarding how far ice advanced in the western Lake Superior basin during the Marquette Readvance (Fig.Â 2b; Black, 1976; Clayton and Moran, 1982; Colman et al., 2020; Drexler et al., 1983; Farrand and Drexler, 1985; Peterson, 1985). This uncertainty results from little dateable material in Lake Superior sediments, the lack of well-defined ice-marginal deposits associated with the Marquette Readvance around the western Lake Superior basin, and ongoing discussion about how some 14C ages and the stratigraphy they come from should be interpreted (Colman et al., 2020; Hobbs and Breckenridge, 2011).\n\nMuch of the recent geochronological work around Lake Superior focuses on retreat of the LIS's Superior Lobe along the northwest shore (the North Shore; Fig.Â 2a) leading up to and following the Marquette Readvance, rather than establishing cross-lake relationships between the North Shore and Wisconsin or Michigan's UP (Fig.Â 2). For example, near-constant retreat of the Superior Lobe along the Lake Superior North Shore uncovered eastward-draining outlets from glacial Lake Agassiz to the Lake Superior basin via Lake Nipigon (Fig.Â 2; Fisher, 2020; Kelly et al., 2016; Leydet et al., 2018; Lowell et al., 2009, 2021; Teller and Mahnic, 1988). Organic 14C and 10Be exposure ages of landforms along the North Shore constrain deglaciation of these outlets from Lake Nipigon to Lake Superior at Black Bay at â¼â10.7âka (mean of 10Be ages; Fig.Â 2a; Leydet et al., 2018; Lowell et al., 2021; Teller and Mahnic, 1988). Meltwater from proglacial lakes flowed through western Lake Superior to eastern Lake Superior and drained first to Lake Michigan through the Au TrainâWhitefish outlets across Michigan's UP and later through the St. Mary's River (Fig.Â 2; Breckenridge, 2013). However, the path meltwater took through Lake Superior during this drainage is unclear because ice margin positions remain less well constrained since there is less recent research and few numerical deglaciation ages across Michigan's UP and none along the Keweenaw Peninsula (Fig.Â 2a; Drexler, 1981; Huber, 1973; Hughes, 1963).\n\nIn the absence of quantitative dating across much of the Lake Superior region, much of our knowledge of the chronology of LIS retreat here comes from analyses of the Lake Superior lake-bottom stratigraphy, which primarily consists of pre-Marquette Readvance outwash or till, then red glaciolacustrine sediment (i.e., varves; Breckenridge, 2007), gray varves, and lastly post-glacial Holocene sediments (Farrand, 1969). The older red varves are sourced from red clay, till, and/or bedrock in the southwest Lake Superior region, compared with the younger gray varves, which are sourced from the bedrock of the Canadian Shield (Breckenridge et al., 2021; Farrand, 1969). Lake Agassiz drainage into the Lake Superior basin is associated with the onset of red varve deposition in areas that were ice-free at the time (Fig.Â 2b; Breckenridge and Johnson, 2009), most likely when lake levels were between Duluth and Minong stages (Breckenridge et al., 2004; Colman et al., 2020; Teller and Mahnic, 1988). In the western Lake Superior basin, red varves are identified north of Isle Royale, in some inland lakes on Isle Royale's northern margin (Figs.Â 2b, 3a), and down-ice of the IR2 moraine (Fig.Â 2b; Breckenridge, 2007; Breckenridge et al., 2004; Colman et al., 2020; Maher, 1977; Raymond et al., 1975; Teller and Mahnic, 1988). Red varves are also observed in parts of the eastern Lake Superior basin (Fig.Â 2b; Breckenridge et al., 2004; Fisher and Whitman, 1999; Mothersill, 1985), indicating the western and eastern parts of the Lake Superior basin were hydrologically linked. Red varves have not been clearly or consistently reported for areas of the northern Lake Superior basin. Varves are ubiquitous in the northern Lake Superior basin, however, but are gray in color, if any color is reported at all, and are usually associated with ice retreat from the lake basin altogether (Fig.Â 2b; Breckenridge, 2007; Breckenridge et al., 2004; Colman et al., 2020; Dell, 1973, 1976; Farrand, 1969; Halfman and Johnson, 1984; Hyodo and Longstaffe, 2011; Johnson, 1980; Johnson and Fields, 1984; Kemp et al., 1978; Landmesser et al., 1982; Maher, 1977; Mothersill, 1979, 1985, 1988; Mothersill and Fung, 1972; O'Beirne, 2013; Raymond et al., 1975; Teller and Mahnic, 1988; Thomas and Dell, 1978; Yu et al., 2010). Where red varves are absent in Lake Superior, gray varves directly overlie pre-Marquette Readvance till or outwash, including at a shallow rise just northeast of Isle Royale (gray square in Fig.Â 2b; Mothersill and Fung, 1982).\n\nIsle Royale is the largest island in Lake Superior (Fig.Â 2), and it is proximal to, and strikes parallel with, the well-constrained North Shore deglaciation chronology (Fig.Â 2; Kelly et al., 2016; Leydet et al., 2018; Lowell et al., 2009, 2021). Isle Royale's position within Lake Superior offers the opportunity to extend the limits of the existing deglacial chronology and draw chronological relationships between the north and south shores of the Lake Superior basin and the lake bottom stratigraphy therein. In this study, we present 11Â new 10Be exposure ages of glacial erratics from the crests of recessional moraines on Isle Royale (Huber, 1973), which are broadly constrained by one existing 14C age from each of two inland lakes on Isle Royale northeast and southwest of these moraines (Flakne, 2003). We place our interpretation of this new 10Be exposure-age dataset in the context of the existing Lake Superior deglaciation chronology, various Lake Superior bottom stratigraphy records, relationships drawn between regional subaerial and subaqueous glacial landforms, and the organization of proglacial lakes that occupied the western Lake Superior basin following the Marquette Readvance.\n\nSamples were collected in 2018 from the tops of quartz-bearing glacial erratics situated on the highest-elevation recessional moraines on Isle Royale (Fig.Â 3; TableÂ 1; AppendixÂ A). Nine samples were collected from the Mt. Desor moraine (IR-18-01 through IR-18-09), one sample was positioned on the small Sugar Mountain moraine (IR-18-10), and another (IR-18-11) was positioned on an upland till plain between the Sugar Mountain and Mt. Desor moraines. (Since there are no known oral traditions or archival records of Indigenous Ojibwemowin names for these moraines, we refer to them by their proximity to local geographic names.) Sampled moraines are relatively higher than the surrounding landscape (Fig.Â 4) and targeting the highest-elevation moraines on Isle Royale minimizes the potential of prolonged subaqueous erratic emplacement under lowering proglacial lake levels (Breckenridge, 2013). To this end, all samples collected are higher in elevation than Lily Lake, which was isolated from proglacial lakes in the Lake Superior basin by â¼â10.7âcalâkaâBP (median age; Flakne, 2003) while lake levels dropped from glacial Lake Duluth to post-Minong levels â¼â10.8â10.6âcalâkaâBP (Figs.Â 3, 4; median ages presented in Breckenridge, 2013). If any of the samples were initially exposed from beneath retreating ice while underwater, they experienced less than â¼â100Â years of subaqueous exposure, which is not long enough to significantly affect 10Be production and thus exposure ages. The tops of all erratics were >25âcm above the forest floor and 8Â of theÂ 11 were >40âcm above the forest floor (TableÂ 1).\n\nQuartz was isolated from samples using froth-flotation and acid etching at the Purdue Rare Isotope Measurement (PRIME) Laboratory. Be was isolated and purified from quartz at the National Science Foundation/University of Vermont Community Cosmogenic Facility following established procedures (Corbett et al., 2016). We dissolved between 6.1 and 21.5âg of quartz and isotopically diluted each sample with â¼â250âÂµgâ9Be using an in-house carrier, termed UVM-SPEX, created from dilution of SPEX 10â000âppm Be standard, with a resulting concentration of 304âÂµgâmLâ1 (TableÂ 2). The 11Â samples were processed alongside one process blank. 10Be/9Be ratios were measured at PRIME in March 2022 and normalized to primary standard 07KNSTD3110, with an assumed ratio of 2.850âÃâ10â12 (Nishiizumi et al., 2007). We corrected the measured 10Be/9Be ratios with the ratio and uncertainty of the one process blank and propagated uncertainties in quadrature (TableÂ 2).\n\nExposure ages of erratics were determined in FebruaryÂ 2023 using Balco et al.'sÂ (2008) exposure-age calculator (versionÂ 3, default production rate) based on present-day elevations, and Lifton et al.'sÂ (2014) LSDn 10Be production rate scaling scheme. Topographic shielding for each sample was calculated in ArcGIS Pro using Li'sÂ (2018) point-based shielding tool and LiDAR imagery; the sloped surface of IR-18-11 required self-shielding calculations (see footnote in TableÂ 1). 10Be exposure ages presented in this study assume no post-glacial erosion. Although a 70-year monthly snowfall record exists for Isle Royale (see AppendixÂ B), its location is not near sampled sites, and it comprises <1â% of the duration of the Holocene, so we do not apply a snow shielding correction on reported ages. Erratic exposure via exhumation through degrading moraine crests is not considered to be significant on Isle Royale because the moraines are small (<30âm in height), younger than the Younger Dryas, and are relatively prominent and geomorphically well defined above the surrounding landscape, all of which greatly reduce the likelihood of long-term erratic exhumation (Putkonen and Swanson, 2003). The normality of the dataset was assessed using a ShapiroâWilk WÂ test in JMP software (versionÂ 16), and we subsequently use Chauvenet's criterion to identify potential age outliers from the dataset (Clark et al., 2009; Rinterknecht et al., 2006).\n\nNew 10Be ages of erratics from Isle Royale's Mt. Desor and Sugar Mountain moraines indicate they share a similar history of exposure at â¼â10.1âÂ±â1.1âka (1âSD). This date provides new insights to the timing of LIS retreat from Isle Royale and the western Lake Superior basin following the Marquette Readvance (Fig.Â 7a). We interpret this age as the mean 10Be exposure age of the Mt. Desor and Sugar Mountain moraines, recognizing that exposure ages of individual erratics, or the whole dataset, could be shifted older if factors like snow shielding or exhumation could be reasonably accounted for. Exposure ages could likewise be shifted younger if our measurements include inherited 10Be, which is possible (Briner et al., 2016).\n\nThe 10Be-constrained timing of LIS retreat from the Mt. Desor and Sugar Mountain moraines is chronologically and geographically consistent with the timeline of presently known deglaciation events on and around Isle Royale. For instance, the stratigraphy of the LS00-3P core southwest of Isle Royale has been interpreted to suggest ice-free conditions by â¼â10.7âka (Breckenridge, 2007), which is coeval with the timing of Lily Lake's isolation from proglacial lakes at â¼â10.7âcalâkaâBP (minimum-limiting median age; 11.1â10.5âcalâkaâBP, 2Ï age range; Fig.Â 6; Flakne, 2003). The mean 10Be age of ice retreat from the Isle Royale's moraines (â¼â10.1âka) is consistent with the estimated timing of ice retreat from the subaqueous IR2 moraine south of Isle Royale (â¼â10.5â10.2âka; Colman et al., 2020), which links the island to the Keweenaw Peninsula on the Michigan UP mainland. The earlier timing of ice-free conditions at the LS00-3P core and Lily Lake sites is reasonable given that they are positioned down-ice of the Mt. Desor, Sugar Mountain, and subaqueous IR2 moraines. We take this regional consistency among datasets to be an indication that, despite the 1.1âkyr uncertainty we report, the mean 10Be age of ice retreat of â¼â10.1âka is meaningful within the context of existing datasets and the deglaciation history of the western Lake Superior basin around Isle Royale.\n\nBased on the similarity between the mean 10Be age of Isle Royale's moraines reported here (â¼â10.1âka) and the age of formation of the subaqueous IR2 moraine south of the island (â¼â10.5â10.2âka; Colman et al., 2020), we suggest that the LIS retreat from the western Lake Superior basin south of the island occurred later than it did along Lake Superior's North Shore (â¼â10.7âka; mean of 10Be ages from the Nipigon moraine and nearest sites west of Lake Nipigon; Fig.Â 7; Leydet et al., 2018; Lowell et al., 2021) as these sample sites and ours are likely to share similar snow cover and inheritance histories. Near-constant modeled ice retreat rates of â¼â40â60âmâyrâ1 are reported along Lake Superior's North Shore (Lowell et al., 2021); a similar retreat rate of â¼â45âmâyrâ1 can be inferred between Lily Lake and Lake Ojibway on Isle Royale (â¼â42âkm) from minimum-limiting 14C bulk-sediment ages (Fig.Â 3; Flakne, 2003). However, ice retreat south of Isle Royale from the LS00-3P core site (â¼â10.7âka; Fig.Â 2; Breckenridge, 2007) to the Mt. Desor and IR2 moraines (â¼â10.1âka; â¼â60âkm; this study; Colman et al., 2020) indicates a mean ice retreat rate of â¼â100âmâyrâ1. Although the ice retreat rate south of Isle Royale appears to outpace the North Shore retreat rate and that between inland lakes on Isle Royale, ice retreat south of the island must have paused long enough to construct the â¤â20âm high subaerial Mt. Desor moraines (profile X in Fig.Â 4) and the â¼â60â100âm high subaqueous IR1 and IR2 moraines during a time when proglacial lake levels were similar to those of glacial Lake Duluth (Colman et al., 2020).\n\nSubaqueous moraines were not identified in Lake Superior north of Isle Royale during multiple seismic surveys (Colman et al., 2020; Johnson, 1980; Landmesser et al., 1982). Neither the â¼â45âmâyrâ1 retreat rate between Isle Royale's inland lakes nor the â¼â100âmâyrâ1 retreat rate south of Isle Royale we infer based on new 10Be exposure ages account for periods of standstill during which time these large moraines were constructed. Therefore, the estimates of ice retreat south of Isle Royale should be considered minimum average retreat rates, with rapid retreat before and after periods of standstill, perhaps being facilitated by high rates of iceberg calving over deeper water (Colman et al., 2020; Hanson and Hooke, 2000). This interpretation of ages and retreat rates in the western Lake Superior basin supports the previously proposed hypothesis that the topography of Isle Royale and the Keweenaw Peninsula provided lateral stability to the retreating ice margin in relatively shallow waters, which delayed its overall retreat, relative to ice retreat long the North Shore (Colman et al., 2020).\n\nEarly work, based on the relative positions of subglacial, ice marginal, and proglacial landforms on Isle Royale, suggests that moraines on Isle Royale formed in a subaerial environment, likely associated with the Beaver Bay stage of glacial Lake Duluth (Huber, 1973). The mean 10Be exposure age (â¼â10.1âka), however, implies that moraine exposure may have been later, postdating the drawdown of glacial Lake Duluth beyond the Beaver Bay stage, at least to post-Minong stages (â¼â10.8â10.6âcalâkaâBP, median ages; Breckenridge, 2013). In support of this reinterpretation is the observation that strandlines of early proglacial lakes (e.g., Highbridge to Shelter Bay; Figs.Â 3b, 4) are present at high elevations on the island, but only on northwest-facing slopes, whereas strandlines of younger proglacial lakes (e.g., Huron Mountain and younger; Figs.Â 3b, 4) are found on northwest- and southeast-facing slopes at lower elevations (Breckenridge, 2013; Farrand, 1969). All striae, crag-and-tail structures, and ice-marginal landforms are found at elevations above the younger strandlines and were thus formed by ice that covered southeast-facing slopes late into the drawdown history of proglacial lakes (Huber, 1973). Similarly, strandlines older than post-Minong stages appear to be absent from northwest-facing slopes on the Keweenaw Peninsula across from Isle Royale (Breckenridge, 2013), though they do exist down-ice of the IR1 moraine (Hughes, 1963).\n\nThe apparent absence of strandlines older than post-Minong on southeast-facing slopes on Isle Royale and northwest-facing slopes along the Keweenaw Peninsula further points to long-lasting ice cover between the two landforms until ice retreat in the early Holocene. Post-Minong and younger strandlines are found along Isle Royale, including northeast (up-ice) of mapped moraines. The emergence of Lake Ojibway on Isle Royale's northeast end at â¼â9.8âcalâkaâBP (minimum-limiting median age; 10.1â9.7âcalâkaâBP, 2Ï age range, Flakne, 2003) places a minimum age limit on ice retreat from the island's moraines and the subaqueous IR2 moraine. Together, these ages imply that the timing of LIS retreat from Isle Royale's moraines, abandonment of the IR2 moraine, and the presence of post-Minong stages of glacial Lake Duluth are roughly coeval sometime between â¼â10.6 and 10.1âka (this study; Breckenridge, 2013; Colman et al., 2020).\n\nDivision of the retreating LIS margin into two separate retreating fronts, northwest and southeast of Isle Royale in the early Holocene, has implications for meltwater routing and the Lake Superior lake-bottom stratigraphy. Red varves associated with influx of meltwater from glacial Lake Agassiz (Breckenridge et al., 2004) were identified down-ice of the subaqueous IR2 moraine south of Isle Royale, but not up-ice (Fig.Â 2b), and Colman et al.Â (2020) interpreted this to mean gray varve deposition across Lake Superior was associated specifically with ice retreat from the IR2 moraine, not from the Lake Superior basin itself (Farrand, 1969). Following Colman et al.'sÂ (2020) interpretation, the similar ages of Isle Royale's recessional moraines and IR2 implies that the presence and absence of red varves across the Lake Superior basin delineates a regional ice margin when ice was last present on Isle Royale. Previously drawn maps place the LIS margin across the northern Lake Superior basin by â¼â10.5âka (Fig.Â 2; Breckenridge, 2007), but red varves do not appear to be present in Nipigon Bay nor the northern Lake Superior basin, and gray varves are identified directly overlying till (i.e., no red varves) at a shallow rise northeast of Isle Royale (Fig.Â 2; Mothersill and Fung, 1972).\n\nThe absence of red varves in the northern Lake Superior basin is most likely a result of earlier ice retreat to the Nipigon moraine by â¼â10.7âka north of Isle Royale (Leydet et al., 2018; Lowell et al., 2021) where the ice margin paused in its retreat along the divide between Black Bay and Nipigon Bay (Fig.Â 7b; Teller and Mahnic, 1988). We suggest that water in the western Lake Superior basin was blocked from draining north around both Isle Royale and the Keweenaw Peninsula by the presence of ice spanning from the Keweenaw Peninsula to the Nipigon moraine via the outer subaqueous IR1 moraine and Isle Royale (Fig.Â 7b).\n\nIn this case, the initial influxes of meltwater from glacial Lake Agassiz, which carried the reddish varve-forming sediment, would have first drained into the western Lake Superior basin at Black Bay and then drained across the Keweenaw Peninsula to the eastern Lake Superior basin via the Portage and Allouez outlets (Fig.Â 7b, c). The Portage and Allouez gaps are known to have previously carried water, but neither has been dated (Hughes, 1963), and we propose that these outlets were abandoned following the rapid ice retreat from Isle Royale and IR2 after â¼â10.1âka (Fig.Â 7d). Ice retreat from Michigan's UP in the eastern Lake Superior basin occurred by â¼â10.5â10.2âka (Breckenridge, 2007; Fisher and Whitman, 1999) and quickly retreated north, perhaps to the vicinity of the Chapleau moraine â¼â10.2âka (Saarnisto, 1974).\n\nFollowing retreat from Isle Royale and the IR2 moraine, the LIS ice retreated to the Nakina moraine, exposing the entirety of the northern Lake Superior basin and small lakes between Lake Superior's North Shore and the Nakina moraine in less than 1âkyr (Fig.Â 7d; Bajc et al., 1997; Breckenridge, 2007, 2013; Breckenridge et al., 2004; Colman et al., 2020; Hyodo and Longstaffe, 2011; Kelly et al., 2016; Lowell et al., 2021; Saarnisto, 1974; Teller and Mahnic, 1988). During this retreat, gray varves were deposited across all of the Lake Superior basin, terminating in a series of 36 anomalously thick varves that are associated with the final pulses of meltwater from the LIS before it retreated from the Nakina moraine at â¼â9âka (Breckenridge et al., 2004; Fig.Â 7). This inferred retreat timing, extrapolated over the >300âkm distance from Isle Royale and the IR2 moraine to the Nakina moraine, means ice retreat rates south of Isle Royale nearly tripled to a mean retreat rate of â¼â270âmâyrâ1 as the ice margin retreated across deep waters of northern Lake Superior (Hanson and Hooke, 2000; Colman et al., 2020). This rapid retreat accounts for the lack of glacial deposits on the northeasternmost two-thirds of Isle Royale where Precambrian bedrock is exposed (Fig.Â 3; Huber, 1973).\n\nBajc, A. F., Morgan, A.
