        "text": "Michigan is full of natural hidden gems â€” and there's a big one travelers across the country haven't fully discovered yet.\n\nIsle Royale National Park in Lake Superior ranked as one of the least visited national parks in 2023, according an annual report based on recreation visits.\n\nIsle Royale ranked 59th out of 63 national parks last year with 28,965 recreation visits.\n\nIn comparison, two national lakeshores in Michigan, Sleeping Bear Dunes in Benzie and Leelanau counties and Pictured Rocks near Munising had 1,598,248 and 910,939 visits, respectively.\n\nThe only national parks with fewer visits were Kobuk Valley in Alaska, Lake Clark in Alaska, National Park of American Samoa in American Samoa, which is located midway between Hawaii and New Zealand in the South Pacific Ocean, and Gates of the Arctic National Park in Alaska.\n\nMore: Warm weather forces officials to suspend Isle Royale wolf count for first time in decades\n\nThe most visited national park was the Great Smoky Mountains with 13,297,647 visits. It was followed by Grand Canyon National Park with 4,733,705 visits and Zion National Park with 4,623,238 visits.\n\nIsle Royale's isolated location requires more effort to get to, requiring a boat or seaplane. It also has a limited visitation window, closing from Nov. 1 to April 15 each year.\n\nThe rugged island is known for its natural beauty and has a strong American Indian, fishing, mining, maritime and logging history.\n\nThe island is home to two resorts, the Rock Harbor Lodge and the Windigo Camper Cabins. Visitors can also tent camp on the island.\n\nAmerica's least visited national parks in 2023"
