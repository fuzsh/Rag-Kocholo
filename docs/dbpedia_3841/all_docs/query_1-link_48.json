        "text": "1.4K\n\nIsle Royale National Park was designed to remain a wilderness. And so it hasâ€”a wild place with no roads, few services, many foot trails, and a network of water routes for canoes and sea kayaks.\n\nIsle Royale, 45 miles long and 9 miles wide, sports one hotel for overnighters, the homey, comfortable Rock Harbor Lodge. Beyond that accommodations consist of dozens of rustic campgrounds scattered on the shores of bays and lakes, and along the promontories.\n\nIslands are defined by the water around them. Isle Royale includes a lot of water; its boundary stretches 4.5 miles from any exposed land. Shipwrecks ring the island as grim monuments to rocky reefs and shifting fog. The forest, drenched by rain and frequent mist, stands in spongy carpets of moss and lichen.\n\nTea-colored creeks pour off the ridges, filling wetlands. Animals include, most famously, wolves, plus moose, foxes, river otters, snowshoe hares, beavers, bald eagles, and loons.\n\nUS National Parks Map\n\nAbout the Guide"
