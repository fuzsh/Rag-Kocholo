        "text": "One thousand feet below us, Isle Royale National Park was all we could see. From the vantage point of a seaplane, the park looked like a geological washboard, its basalt ridges and 400 islands rising above Lake Superiorâs surface, calm and mirror-like on this August afternoon. I saw my husband Bruce shift his weight in the airplane seat. Was he angling for a better view? Or was he nervous?\n\nBruce and I had visited Isle Royale before. But previous visits had been weekend treks centered on day hikes. This time, we would thru-hike the Greenstone Ridge, a 43-mile trail that traces the length of the parkâs largest island, Isle Royale. And our hike would be compounded by physical limitations. Bruce was just months removed from a serious accident, a collision with a pick-up truck on a morning walk that had rendered him briefly wheelchair bound. His left leg still was recovering from a severe fracture and reconstruction.\n\nâIâm planning to thru-hike Isle Royale this summer,â Bruce had informed his surgeon weeks before our departure. âWhat do you think?â\n\nâWell, that will test you,â smiled the surgeon. âI think you should go.â We trusted the doctor and packed our bags.\n\nThe westernmost end of Isle Royale revealed a landscape accustomed to heavy snow and rain, and as if to prove the point, the clouds broke open on our first full day on the trail. A dense overstory of conifers offered meager relief from the driving rain. In low-lying areas, thimbleberry bushes and hip-high ferns reached out to us, constant reminders of a forest ready to reclaim this trail once the hikers left. And thick mud sucked at our hiking boots.\n\nâHow much longer before we reach the campground?â complained Bruce as we wound our way downhill toward the shores of Hatchet Lake and the eveningâs campsite. His knee had begun to ache.\n\nâThe weather can be intense here,â said Isle Royale National Park Chief of Information and Cultural Resources Liz Valencia, who has worked at the park since 1992. âAnd Isle Royale is very isolated.â The nearest Michigan town is Copper Harbor, 3Â½ hours by ferry to the south, and the national park is fully closed to humans six months of the year.\n\nâVisitors can find themselves really immersed in the wilderness at Isle Royale,â\n\nValencia said. âBut that isolation and the presence of Lake Superior are also what makes Isle Royale so special.â\n\nIf outdoor enthusiasts represent the vast majority of todayâs 18,500 annual visitors, Isle Royale hasnât always been deemed a leisure getaway. As early as 2500 B.C., Native Americans extracted the islandâs copper, followed by miners of European descent in the early 19th century. Commercial fisheries dotted the islandâs shores with weather-beaten shanties for a century beginning in the 1830s. And in 1935, logging crews affiliated with the Civilian Conservation Corps exported Isle Royaleâs first 18,000 cords of pulpwood to Wisconsin paper mills.\n\nIt wasnât until the early 1900s that tourism became a force on Isle Royale, as industrialized Midwestern city-dwellers escaped for the islandâs idyllic lighthouses, boating excursions and picnics on the banks of Lake Superior. Isle Royaleâs designation as a national park in 1931 promised âto preserve a prime example of Northwoods wilderness,â according to the National Park Service (NPS), further upping the number of leisure travelers and preserving the landscape that Bruce and I hiked through on this August day.\n\nA light breeze and early morning sunshine filled our tent and lifted our spirits the next day. A good nightâs sleep seemed to have worked magic on Bruceâs aching leg, and any doubts about our fortitude seemed to have vanished with the clouds.\n\nBy midday, we reached the open ground of Mount Siskiwit, a 1,200-foot promontory that offered views of Isle Royaleâs northern shore. Soaking up the heat of the mountainâs sun-warmed basalt, we shielded our eyes from the bright rays of the sun as it glanced off Lake Superiorâs smooth surface. Already, yesterdayâs rain seemed a distant memory.\n\nAs the miles passed, we noticed a gradual change in the islandâs landscape, signs that we were approaching Isle Royaleâs leeward side. The tortured firs so prevalent on previous days began yielding to birch and sugar maples, and the Greenstoneâs hard-packed ferny route had transformed into a gravel path that snaked through wind-blown grasses and wild asters. The sun continued to shine, the temperature rose and we began to search for one of the 1,600 moose synonymous with Isle Royale.\n\nItâs a subject of much discussion here on Isle Royale, the increasing number of resident moose, the declining number of wolves and the precarious ratio of predator to prey. In the late 1940s, gray wolves are thought to have first arrived via ice bridge from Ontario, helping to maintain the stability of Isle Royaleâs moose herd. But Lake Superiorâs warming waters and inbreeding have since depleted the wolf population, bringing the total number of animals from a high of 50 in 1980 to a low of two in 2016. In June 2018, concerns of a serious wildlife imbalance led the NPS to approve reintroduction of gray wolves, releasing the first four animals in September 2018 and 11 more in early 2019.\n\nâMost visitors are excited about the reintroduction of wolves to Isle Royale,â Valencia said. âOthers think that nature should just be left alone. Reactions vary.â The NPS plans to relocate a total of 20 to 30 wolves to Isle Royale within the next three to five years.\n\nWe wouldnât see any wolves on this trek, nor moose, the latter inclined to gather in Lake Superiorâs protective harbors. And so, we hiked onward, up and over rocky accordion folds until we reached Mount Ojibway and our first glimpse of civilization.\n\nThe mountainâs bald top and 1,130-foot altitude revealed glimmering Lake Superior to the south, the water streaked by boat traffic. Rock Harbor Lighthouse thrust its white head above the trees, and we could just make out the buildings of Rock Harbor Lodge, the end of the Greenstone Ridge Trail.\n\nBruce wasnât content to take in the view from here, not when Mount Ojibwayâs mountaintop fire tower promised a broader view. My fear of heights kept me grounded, but I watched him bound up the 50 steps to the lookout. Whether his limberness came of the previous dayâs exercise, the warmth of this summer day or the prospect of a great view, he had all but forgotten his weak leg.\n\nâWe should make plans to come back,â Bruce said, returning again to terra firma. âThere are over 100 miles of trails on Isle Royale, and we could make a goal of hiking all of them: Minong Ridge, Feldtmann Ridge, the Ishpeming Trail. Wouldnât that be fun?â\n\nTomorrow night, weâll have hot showers and cold beers. Weâll sleep in real beds and gaze heavenward after dark for a look at the Milky Way. But for now, we lingered in the sunshine. Here in the middle of Lake Superior, summer is fleeting. Best to enjoy the day while it lasts.\n\nIf You Doâ¦\n\nTransportation: Ferry prices to Isle Royale begin at $55 one way from Houghton or Copper Harbor; seaplane rates begin at $220 one way from Houghton.\n\nPermit: National Park entrance fees cost $7/person per day or $80 for an annual National Park pass that allows as many as three adults to accompany the pass holder.\n\nLodging: The Rock Harbor Ranger Station hosts Isle Royaleâs only lodge and fully furnished housekeeping cabins. Camper cabins are in Windigo, at the trailâs western terminus and at a few backcountry campgrounds. Backpackers must obtain free backcountry camping permits upon arrival and be prepared to filter and carry each dayâs water. Island campsites are first come, first served but large enough to share.\n\nSeason: Isle Royale is open to the public April 16-Oct. 31, with June through September considered prime hiking and camping months. nps.gov/isro\n\nRoyal Day Hikes\n\nVisitors can easily enjoy Isle Royaleâs natural beauty via spectacular day hikes from Rock Harbor.
