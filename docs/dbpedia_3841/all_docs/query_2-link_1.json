        "text": "The following is a list of islands of Michigan. Michigan has the second longest coastline of any state after Alaska. Being bordered by four of the five Great Lakes—Erie, Huron, Michigan, and Superior—Michigan also has 64,980 inland lakes and ponds, as well as innumerable rivers, that may contain their own islands included in this list. The majority of the islands are within the Great Lakes. Other islands can also be found within other waterways of the Great Lake system, including Lake St. Clair, St. Clair River, Detroit River, and St. Marys River.\n\nThe largest of all the islands is Isle Royale in Lake Superior, which, in addition to its waters and other surrounding islands, is organized as Isle Royale National Park. Isle Royale itself is 206 square miles (530 km2). The most populated island is Grosse Ile with approximately 10,000 residents, located in the Detroit River about 10 miles (16 kilometres) south of Detroit. The majority of Michigan's islands are uninhabited and very small. Some of these otherwise unusable islands have been used for the large number of Michigan's lighthouses to aid in shipping throughout the Great Lakes, while others have been set aside as nature reserves. Many islands in Michigan have the same name, even some that are in the same municipality and body of water, such as Gull, Long, or Round islands.\n\nOnly Monroe County and a very small portion of Wayne County have boundaries within the westernmost portion of Lake Erie. The lake has a mean surface elevation of 571 feet (174 m). The islands in the southern portion of the county are part of the North Maumee Bay Archeological District of the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge, while northern islands are part of Pointe Mouillee State Game Area at the mouth of the Huron River and Detroit River. Turtle Island is the only island in the state of Michigan that is shared by another state, as it is divided with the state of Ohio.\n\nIsland Municipality County Coordinates Ref Dalhka Island Brownstown Township Wayne [1] Gard Island Erie Township Monroe [2] Indian Island Erie Township Monroe [3] Rat Island Brownstown Township Wayne [1] Smiths Island Monroe Township Monroe [4] Turtle Island Erie Township Monroe [5] Waterman Island Berlin Township Monroe [1]\n\nLake Huron is the second largest of the Great Lakes (after Lake Superior) with a surface area of 23,010 square miles (59,600 km2). Michigan is the only state to border Lake Huron, while the portion of the lake on the other side of the international border belongs to the province of Ontario. The vast majority of Michigan's islands in Lake Huron are centered around Drummond Island in the northernmost portion of the state's lake territory. Another large group of islands is the Les Cheneaux Islands archipelago, which itself contains dozens of small islands. Many of the lake's islands are very small and uninhabited.\n\nAs the most popular tourist destination in the state, Mackinac Island is the most well known of Lake Huron's islands. Drummond Island is the state's second-largest island (after Isle Royale) and is the most populous of Michigan's islands in Lake Huron, with a population of 1,058 at the 2010 census. While Mackinac Island had a population of 492, there are thousands more seasonal workers and tourists during the summer months.\n\nMichigan only has islands in Lake Michigan in the northern portion of the lake. There are no islands in the southern half of Lake Michigan. The largest and most populated of Michigan's islands in Lake Michigan is Beaver Island at 55.8 square miles (145 km2) and 551 residents. Some of the smaller islands surrounding Beaver Island are part of the larger Michigan Islands National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nIsland Municipality County Coordinates Ref Bassett Island Peninsula Township Grand Traverse Beaver Island Peaine / St. James Charlevoix Bellow Island Leelanau Township Leelanau Butlers Island Gladstone Delta Epoufette Island Hendricks Township Mackinac Fisherman Island Norwood Township Charlevoix Garden Island St. James Township Charlevoix Grape Island St. James Township Charlevoix Gravel Island Hudson Township Mackinac Gravelly Island Fairbanks Township Delta Green Island St. Ignace Mackinac Gull Island Fairbanks Township Delta Gull Island St. James Township Charlevoix Hat Island St. James Township Charlevoix High Island St. James Township Charlevoix Hog Island St. James Township Charlevoix Horseshoe Island St. James Township Charlevoix Ile Aux Galets Cross Village Township Emmet Little Gull Island Fairbanks Township Delta Little Hog Island Hudson Township Mackinac Little Island St. James Township Charlevoix Little Summer Island Fairbanks Township Delta Naubinway Island Garfield Township Mackinac North Fox Island Leelanau Township Leelanau North Manitou Island Leland Township Leelanau Pismire Island St. James Township Charlevoix Poverty Island Fairbanks Township Delta Power Island Peninsula Township Grand Traverse Rocky Island Fairbanks Township Delta Round Island Ford River Township Delta Round Island Bay de Noc Township Delta Sand Island Escanaba Delta Shoe Island St. James Township Charlevoix Snake Island Fairbanks Township Delta South Fox Island Leelanau Township Leelanau South Manitou Island Glen Arbor Township Leelanau Squaw Island St. James Township Charlevoix Stroughbury Island Rapid River Township Delta St. Helena Island Moran Township Mackinac St. Martin Island Fairbanks Township Delta St. Vital Island Bay de Noc Township Delta Summer Island Fairbanks Township Delta Temperance Island Bliss Township Emmet Trout Island St.James Township Charlevoix Waugoshance Island Bliss Township Emmet Whiskey Island St. James Township Charlevoix\n\nLake Superior is the largest of the Great Lakes, and the coastline is sparsely populated. At 206 square miles (530 km2), Isle Royale is the largest Michigan island and is the center of Isle Royale National Park, which itself contains over 450 islands. The following is a list of islands in Lake Superior that are not part of Isle Royale National Park. For those islands, see the list of islands in Isle Royale National Park.\n\nIsland Municipality County Coordinates Ref Au Train Island Onota Township Alger [6] Garlic Island Powell Township Marquette [7] Grand Island Grand Island Township Alger [8] Granite Island Powell Township Marquette [9] Gull Island Powell Township Marquette [10] Huron Islands Powell Township Marquette [11] Iroquois Island Bay Mills Township Chippewa [12] Larus Island Marquette Township Marquette [13] Lighthouse Island Powell Township Marquette [14] Little Presque Island Marquette Township Marquette [15] Manitou Island Grant Township Keweenaw [16] McIntyre Island Powell Township Marquette [17] Middle Island Marquette Township Marquette [18] Naomikong Island Whitefish Township Chippewa [19] Partridge Island Marquette Township Marquette [20] Picnic Rocks Marquette Marquette [21] Porters Island Grant Township Keweenaw [22] Presque Isle Marquette Marquette [23] Presque Isle Point Rocks Marquette Marquette [24] Ripley Rock Marquette Marquette [25] Tahquamenom Island Whitefish Township Chippewa [26] Traverse Island Houghton Township Houghton [27] Williams Island Grand Island Township Alger [28] Wood Island Grand Island Township Alger [29]\n\nLake St. Clair connects Lake Huron and Lake Erie through the St. Clair River in the north and the Detroit River in the south. At 430 square miles (1,100 km2), it is one of the largest non-Great Lakes in the United States, but it only contains a small number of islands near the mouth of the St. Clair River, where all of the following islands are located. The largest of these islands is Harsens Island, and all the islands are in Clay Township in St. Clair County.\n\nIsland Municipality County Coordinates Ref Bruckner Island Clay Township St. Clair [30] Club Island Clay Township St. Clair [31] Dickinson Island Clay Township St. Clair [32] Green Island Clay Township St. Clair [33] Gull Island Clay Township St. Clair [34] Harsens Island Clay Township St. Clair [35] McDonald Island Clay Township St. Clair [36] Middle Island Clay Township St. Clair [37] Muscamoot Ridge Clay Township St. Clair [38] North Island Clay Township St. Clair [39] Russell Island Clay Township St. Clair [40] Sand Island Clay Township St. Clair [41] Strawberry Island Clay Township St. Clair [42]\n\nThe Detroit River runs for 24 nautical miles (44 km; 28 mi) and connects Lake St. Clair to Lake Erie. For its entire length, it carries the international border between the United States and Canada. Some islands belong to Ontario in Canada and are not included in the list below. All islands on the American side belong to Wayne County. Portions of the southern portion of the river serve as wildlife refuges as part of the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge. The largest and most populous island is Grosse Ile. Most of the islands are around and closely connected to Grosse Ile.\n\nIsland Municipality County Coordinates Ref Belle Isle Detroit Wayne [43] Calf Island Grosse Ile Township Wayne [44] Celeron Island Grosse Ile Township Wayne [45] Cherry Island Brownstown Township Wayne [46] Edmond Island Gibraltar Wayne [47] Elba Island Grosse Ile Township Wayne [48] Elizabeth Park Trenton Wayne [49] Fox Island Grosse Ile Township Wayne [50] Grassy Island Grosse Ile Township Wayne [51] Grosse Ile Grosse Ile Township Wayne [52] Hall Island Gibraltar Wayne [53] Humbug Island Gibraltar Wayne [54] Hickory Island Grosse Ile Township Wayne [55] Horse Island Gibraltar Wayne [56] Main Island Gibraltar Wayne [53] Mamajuda Island Grosse Ile Township Wayne [57] Meso Island Grosse Ile Township Wayne [58] Mud Island Ecorse Wayne [59] Powder House Island Grosse Ile Township Wayne [60] Round Island Grosse Ile Township Wayne [61] Stony Island Grosse Ile Township Wayne [62] Sturgeon Bar Brownstown Township Wayne [63] Sugar Island Grosse Ile Township Wayne [64] Swan Island Grosse Ile Township Wayne [65] Zug Island River Rouge Wayne [66]\n\nThe St. Marys River connects Lake Superior and Lake Huron at the easternmost point of the Upper Peninsula. It carries the international border throughout its length, and some of the islands belong to neighboring Ontario. The largest of Michigan's islands in the river are Sugar Island and Neebish Island. Wider portions of the river are designated as Lake George, Lake Nicolet, and the Munuscong Lake. The whole length of the Michigan portion of the river is part of Chippewa County.\n\nIsland Municipality County Coordinates Ref Advance Island Sugar Island Township Chippewa [67] Bass Reef Island Raber Township Chippewa [68] Chicken Islands Soo Township Chippewa [69] Cook Island Sugar Island Township Chippewa [70] Duck Island Sugar Island Township Chippewa [71] Edward Island Raber Township Chippewa [72] Gem Island Sugar Island Township Chippewa [73] Gull Island Raber Township Chippewa [74] Hart Island Soo Township Chippewa [75] Hen Island Soo Township Chippewa [76] Hog Island Sugar Island Township Chippewa [77] Island Number Four Soo Township Chippewa [78] Island Number One Soo Township Chippewa [79] Island Number Three Soo Township Chippewa [80] Island Number Two Soo Township Chippewa [81] Lime Island Raber Township Chippewa [82] Love Island Raber Township Chippewa [83] Moon Island Raber Township Chippewa [84] Munuscong Island Pickford Township Chippewa [85] Neebish Island Soo Township Chippewa [86] Pilot Island Raber Township Chippewa [87] Pine Island Raber Township Chippewa [88] Pipe Island Raber Township Chippewa [89] Rains Island Soo Township Chippewa [90] Rock Island Sugar Island Township Chippewa [91] Round Island Superior Township Chippewa [92] Round Island Raber Township Chippewa [93] Sand Island Soo Township Chippewa [94] Steamboat Island Raber Township Chippewa [95] Sugar Island Sugar Island Township Chippewa [96] Twin Island Raber Township Chippewa [97] Two Tree Island Raber Township Chippewa [98]\n\nMichigan has numerous inland lakes and rivers that also contain their own islands.

While it is not the largest inland lake in Michigan, it does contain the most inland islands that are officially named. At its shortest distance, it is located less than one mile (1.6 kilometres) from Lake Huron, but the two are not connected. Grand Lake contains 14 islands, of which Grand Island is by far the largest.\n\nIsland Municipality County Coordinates Ref Allen Island Krakow Township Presque Isle [99] Applegate Island Krakow Township Presque Isle [100] Bear Island Krakow Township Presque Isle [101] Brown Island Presque Isle Township Presque Isle [102] Burnt Island Presque Isle Township Presque Isle [103] Cedar Island Presque Isle Township Presque Isle [104] Crescent Island Presque Isle Township Presque Isle [105] Grand Island Presque Isle Township Presque Isle [106] Horseshoe Island Presque Isle Township Presque Isle [107] Indian Island Presque Isle Township Presque Isle [108] Macombers Island Krakow / Presque Isle Presque Isle [109] Round Island Presque Isle Township Presque Isle [110] Tanglewood Island Presque Isle Township Presque Isle [111] Three Sisters Island Presque Isle Township Presque Isle [112]\n\nGeography of Michigan\n\nGreat Lakes\n\nIslands of the Great Lakes\n\nPopulated islands of the Great Lakes\n\nIslands of the Midwest\n\nList of islands in Isle Royale National Park\n\nList of islands in the Detroit River\n\nList of Michigan islands in Lake Huron\n\nFerries in Michigan"
