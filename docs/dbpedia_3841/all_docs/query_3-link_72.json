        "text": "Some Comments:\n\n\"I had a chance to read the book while on the ferry ride home. It is amazing! Far more thorough and informative than anything I've seen from the park service.\" Calvin C.\n\n\"We saw your book on the Voyageur last year and thought it was a fantastic resource.\n\nThanks for putting it together!\" Nancy B.\n\n\"I read your book on the Sea Hunter a few weeks ago and decided I needed to have it. We are planning to go back in September. Thanks so much, I wish I had read it before I attempted the Feltdmann loop in 3 days (direction really would have been key).\" Katt P.\n\n\"I purchased another book on the island a couple of years ago and I thought it provided all of the information I needed. That was until I saw your book and read some of the samples. I purchased it and I was amazed at the amount of detail on everything having to do with the park and planning a trip. It is truly a âComprehensive Guideâ to the park!\" Rick N.\n\n\"I received my DVD, thank you so much - what a great collection of information and pictures. I am planning a trip to Isle Royale with my Dad, my Son, Brother-in-law, Uncle, and a Friend in August of 2013. This information will be most valuable.\" Bob S.\n\n\"I just thought I would follow up with you and say thank you for the information provided in your book. It was very helpful to me for knowledge of the island and the trails.\" Eric C.\n\n\"Wow, what a beautiful resource book! It has info I didn't even know I wanted! It definitely shows that Isle Royale is a passion, not just a destination. I am very happy with this book. I can read it on my android with no problem, so it can follow me anywhere for some good reading.\" Jason P.\n\nI have just returned from Isle Royale and wanted to say thank you! Your guide and the info provided within was an incredible resource as the need to change my itinerary arose. I'd recommended your packages to any first time visitor planning to hike the island. It made a great experience even better! Thank you again! Mark M.\n\nThe Book\n\nThis is a compilation of journals, walking, reading, paddling, notes, photos, memories and video over a period of over 20 years of planning, hiking, canoeing and untold hours of putting it together. It will be a living document until I die, when my work at least, will be complete. I would appreciate it if you would think about that before sharing it with people for free and at least let them know it is available and someone has given up a good portion of their life to share it with you.\n\nI began writing this in the fall of 2001 and it has been an ongoing project since then. Its first complete release was in December, 2010. There was more to add and fine tune, but 9 years of work finally got into the public eye. The second release was March, 2012 and it was re-released with many additional features and all of the major gaps filled. The third release was April, 2013 and included several improvements along with the addition of a program called \"Isle Royale - Base Camp\" and a utility called \"Isle Royale - Trip Planner\". These are detailed in program description.\n\nI am quite confident this will stand as the most complete guide to the park for many years. I hope you find it useful.\n\nThe book contains a total of twelve sections which are described below. Most of the sections have a sample PDF file that is included in the \"Demo\" program if you download it. Just click on the Sample button where shown to see that sample. In the samples, the pictures do not link to larger ones like they do in the document if you have the \"Ultimate\" package. There are also some images shown from the book in a reduced size. If you click on them, the full size image will be shown. The book is available in various packages and price levels. For a description, go to the store page.\n\nSection 1: About This Book - Details on me, legal stuff, thank yous, my trips to the island, how the book is laid out and a park map. This section is 6 pages with 11 pictures, 1 chart and 1 map.\n\nTop"
