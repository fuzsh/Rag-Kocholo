        "text": "Isle Royale National Park is a bear-free wilderness, a poison ivy-free fairy garden often pummeled by an unforgiving and unpredictable Lake Superior, the largest island in the largest freshwater lake in the world.\n\nThe National Park Service’s 100th anniversary likely won’t change its status as the least-visited national park. Last year, 18,684 recreational visitors made it to Isle Royale for its 75th anniversary year. In the past 10 years, the average has hovered just under 16,000.\n\nIt’s not just difficult to reach Isle Royale in the winter; it’s illegal to go there Nov. 1 through April 15.\n\nIsle Royale’s 400 islands have been a playground for the rich, who built resorts and cabins. An inspiration for painters such as Grand Marais-based Howard Sivertson. A lightly trodden backpackers’ destination worth the price of the ferry ride.\n\nIf the phrase \"island in Lake Superior\" doesn't immediately grab your attention, the attraction may seem elusive — until you visit. The attraction is the whole place. And it’s the tiny, exquisite parts.\n\nA ranger, a researcher and a family shared what drew them — and, in some cases, held them.\n\nAt most parks, Isle Royale National Park ranger Val Martin said, visitors ask what to see and rangers point them to specific attractions. The tallest tree. The highest waterfall. The iconic landmarks.\n\n“You go to the Grand Canyon and you’re just like, ‘Waaah! The Grand Canyon!’ It’s like so big. It’s like shouting: I am the Grand Canyon! It’s like this incredible thing. But Isle Royale is all about the whispering. Everything around you is whispering to you, and the way you’re experiencing place, you’re ready to listen to it,” Martin said.\n\n“For the visitor, that’s what makes this place special is the intimacy. It’s small enough to know it a little bit,” Martin said.\n\nJoan Edwards, whose Isle Royale research since 1974 has focused on plants, suggests experiencing the park this way:\n\n“I think it’s just this amazing, jaw-dropping scenery and it’s constantly changing all the time. So I’d focus on the big, and then I’d also focus on the tiny — looking at flowers closely is something I get great pleasure from.”\n\nHer husband, David Smith, who researches boreal chorus frogs, considers time in his approach to enjoying the island:\n\n“When we’re back there (in Massachusetts) we’re news junkies. Here, you’re separated from that. So the scale of time just stretches out, and you have time to reflect about things,” Smith said. “There’s something about looking at the landscape that’s calming.\"\n\nMartin suggests visitors tuck their watches away while they’re on the island.\n\nWhen Martin was in her second year at Isle Royale, stationed in Rock Harbor, a visitor came in, asked what to see. Martin pondered, and then responded:\n\n“You wait until sunset, then you wander over to Tobin Harbor. You find yourself a rock that you like the look of. And then you sit and you watch, and the sun will go down. Perhaps the loons will call in the background. And then you will be at Isle Royale.”\n\nOther national parks boast postcard attractions. Isle Royale is more about the experience as a whole, the interaction. It’s about noticing the orange snowshoe hares that have popped up in the past couple of years; the garter snakes in blue or red stripes or checkered patterns; the red squirrels’ scolding, delivered in a higher pitch than that of their mainland counterparts.\n\n“For many people, it ends up being a real place that’s very much full of magic,” Martin said.\n\nVal Martin knows how to find moose.\n\nAfter 18 seasons as an Isle Royale National Park ranger, she knows lots of park secrets. Like where to see 300 Canada swallowtail butterflies in the spring. Where to scout out rare orchids.\n\nWhat visitors really want to know: Where can I see a moose?\n\nThe answer: Sit in one place.\n\n“Staying in one place and just watching what happens on the landscape is the way that you see wildlife on Isle Royale,” Martin said.\n\n“Many people are having these big huge hikes and they’re doing the whole Greenstone Trail. That’s such a typical Isle Royale thing to do. They get up and they hike and they hike and they hike and they hike. Each day they travel to somewhere new. They arrive. They’re relatively tired. They eat, they sleep, they get up and they hike again.\n\n“When they get here, they often say, ‘Well, we didn’t really see any wildlife.’ The big error they made is they didn’t stay somewhere for two nights,” Martin said. “Stay somewhere for two nights, and spend a day that you just are there exploring without anything else in mind besides taking in everything around you.”\n\nMartin never expected to take in any one park for this long.\n\nShe calls herself an island girl. She started her NPS career 26 years ago at Hawaii Volcanoes. Moved on to California’s Channel Islands, Cumberland Island National Seashore in Georgia, Acadia in Maine and a couple of other places before landing at Isle Royale. She’d never been to the Midwest.\n\n“The dynamism of the place is maybe the secret that people don’t see when they’re here. They anticipate it being a wild place, a wilderness — 99 percent of the land protected federally — and as an isolated place somehow separate from the rest of the world. And that really couldn’t be further from the truth,” Martin said.\n\n“Isolation gives this place its character, but it is still incredibly connected to all the things that are around it. It’s connected because everything we do at home probably has an influence on this place.”\n\nIt’s connected by climate. (Isle Royale National Park supports species more susceptible to climate change because they're at the northern or southern edges of their ranges.) By what’s in the atmosphere. (Five of the inland lakes contain high concentrations of mercury plus other chemicals that here could only be deposited by precipitation.)\n\nBy human travels.\n\n“We come with seeds in our boots and an insect in our pack, and we have the ability to change the place. So we’re driving change. It shouldn’t be that it’s for better or for worse or for good or for bad, necessarily. But we need to recognize that we do affect this place,” Martin said.\n\n“While it feels separate and it is separate, it’s not completely separate,” Martin said.\n\nLiving on the island for six months of the year provides a different kind of separation for the 12 park and concession workers based at the Windigo ranger station. (Most park staff — about 45 people, including biology technicians, archaeologists, mechanics and enforcement — live on Mott Island.)\n\n“Let’s face it: Once you come out here to live, you lose a lot of the things that maybe you have from home. But I think that’s the benefit. Because the one thing that you have when you are here is you have time,” Martin said.\n\n“There are so many things that I do not have to do out here. I don’t have to ever go on any errands. I don’t have to shop. I don’t have a TV.”\n\nMainland visits are reserved for necessities. Workers send grocery lists, receive food and mail by boat. Martin misses two things: Riding a bike (bikes and motorized vehicles are banned on the island) and going to the grocery store.\n\n“One year I forgot that there was such a thing as celery,” Martin said.\n\nJoan Edwards once spent 14 hours following a moose in Isle Royale National Park, stopping when it stopped, moving when it moved, recording how many bites of what kinds of plants it ate.\n\nEdwards, chair of the biology department at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, has missed only one summer research season on Isle Royale since 1974, the year she studied what effect moose have on the park’s plants for her doctorate thesis.\n\nThe 1974 trip wasn’t her first to the archipelago.\n\nEdwards Island is named for her great-grandfather, a minister who arrived in the 1800s and gave sermons at the lodge. In 1912, he built a cabin on the three-quarter-mile-long island off Scoville Point east of Rock Harbor. When Isle Royale became a national park, Edwards' great-grandfather was given a choice: Sell the island for $500 or enter a life lease. The lease will expire when its holder, Edwards’ 93-year-old aunt, dies.\n\nBecause her mother didn’t think Isle Royale was a proper place for a girl, Edwards didn’t visit until she was a teenager. She introduced her husband, David Smith, now a senior lecturer in evolution and ecology at Williams College, to Isle Royale. He’s been studying boreal chorus frogs there every summer since 1978.\n\nThis season, Edwards and Smith are spending six weeks at Isle Royale with three research students. They live in the cabin. There’s no email. No phone. No running water. The solar panel powers only their computers.\n\n“It’s a pretty simple life,” Smith said.\n\nCook in the morning. Work during the day. Cook in the evening.\n\nThey’d been on the island for 10 days when we met at the Washington Harbor dock, where they pick up their mail from the ferry. They’d already adjusted to the break from cellphones and civilization.\n\n“You see the world around you, and I think that’s really important. I think that’s one of the best things about doing research out here,” Edwards said.\n\n“Even though we have a camp that we live in, we basically sleep indoors, and we spend the rest of the time outside. We eat on an outdoor porch with no screens. You see things and you hear things that you wouldn’t see and hear otherwise. ...\n\n“Your different senses come into play. You really pay attention to the weather, because you have to deal with it every day. But you hear the birds, and you see the birds, and you notice the flowers. And the longer you spend, the more attuned you are,” Edwards said. “I think for scientific discovery, that’s really important. You tend to make unexpected discoveries and see things that other people haven’t seen.”\n\nOne student’s discovery on Isle Royale made the Guinness Book of World Records.\n\nThe bunchberry, AKA Canada dogwood, holds the record for the world’s fastest-opening flower. The exploding flowers open in less than half a millisecond.\n\nThe actual flowers are clustered in the center of four white, modified leaves that look like petals. Prompted to take a closer look at the structure, student Sarah Klionsky got in close.\n\n“Something went pouf,” Edwards recalled her saying during the 2002 research season. Sure enough, tiny puffs shot out of the flowers. Turns out the flower catapults pollen, sending it into the wind and onto the bumblebees or long-horn beetles that brush the flowers’ trigger hair, according to a piece in Williams College’s 2005 Faculty in Focus publication.\n\n“We think they do it so they preferentially place pollen on heavy insects. If an ant comes by, it doesn’t explode open. But if a bumblebee comes by, it explodes open and then it throws its pollen onto the underside of the bumblebee and the bumblebee carries it on to the next plant. It’s a way for the plant to selectively place its pollen on fast-flying, heavier insects that are going to visit more flowers and go a longer distance, which ultimately would be better for the plant from an evolutionary standpoint,” Edwards said.\n\nThis season, Edwards’ research focuses on three areas:\n\n• Pollinator networks for Isle Royale plants, which asks how flora splits up and shares or competes for pollinators. “I’m not sure they’re necessarily sharing. We’re looking at how flowers are pollinated in the broader community,” Edwards said.\n\n• Arctic plants, a project since 1988, which maps the subpopulations and samples DNA to determine if populations differ from island to island. Many of the 18 Great Lakes Arctic disjuncts (closely related species widely separated geographically) are threatened or species of concern in Michigan.\n\n• A neighborhood model, which trains cameras on three patches of bunchberries, no more than 300 meters apart. The insects' overlap from one patch to the next was low, meaning the gene flow between patches was probably low. Like people, Edwards said, insects might stick to “neighborhoods” where the food, shelter and safety are certain.\n\nThe data could help researchers understand vulnerabilities in plant populations and determine how robust the pollinators are. Collectively, it could inform management decisions.\n\nAmong the surprises: Some plants thought to be pollinated by only a couple of insects are pollinated by many. Bunchberry, for example, was visited by more than 60 classifications of insects. That's good news for plants' long-term survival.\n\n“I think most flowers have a backup system in some way,” Edwards said.\n\nThe Conlin family of Chicago visits a different national park every summer.\n\nThey started with Great Smoky Mountains, the most-visited national park, in 1993. They’ve missed only two years since.\n\nJessica Conlin, 29, who teaches fifth-and sixth-grade science in inner-city Chicago, vividly recalled that first trip — probably because the family took a glass-bottomed helicopter tour over the Smokies. Brother Daniel, 25, was too young to remember. Sister Megan, 19, wasn’t born yet.\n\nThis year, the Conlins visited the least-visited national park: Isle Royale.\n\nThe park has received a grand total of 1,046,648 visitors since 1940. Some perspective: Great Smoky Mountains received 10,712,674 recreational visitors in 2015 alone.\n\nThe Conlins considered logistics, not visitation numbers, when they planned their trip.\n\n“We treasure these moments. It’s an escape from reality. It’s bonding. It’s nature. It’s serenity,” Jessica said.\n\nThis trip was likely their last as a nuclear family. Both Jessica and Daniel are engaged to be married.\n\nDaniel, a biology teacher at DePaul College Prep, will be married in August. The East Coast (possibly a return to Great Smoky Mountains) is next on his travel list.\n\nIn mid-June, they were headed back to Grand Portage on the Voyager II ferry after four days based at Windigo ranger station. They watched the island disappear from the back deck, and then disappeared inside.\n\nJessica returned a while later with a list.\n\nThey’d tallied their national park visits. Her parents — Patrick, 58, a kitchen designer, and Therese, 56, an educator to parents of children up to 3 years old — have visited 24 national parks together. Jessica has visited 21. Daniel’s been to 19. Megan has been to 18.\n\nThey'd reminisced about fireworks over Mount Rushmore, Jiffy Pop popcorn, packing lists, and the one trip that would change their idea of adventure.\n\n“It’s a camaraderie that we share. It goes deeper than Disney World. If you get hurt, you rely on each other,” Jessica said.\n\nThe Grand Canyon rim-to-rim hike in 2012 was their first break from car-camping. It was the trip where Therese got sick and the rest of the family divvied up her gear and kept on hiking.\n\n“The Grand Canyon was where we backpacked and went into the great unknown and relied on each other the most,” Jessica said.\n\nWith her own family, Jessica said she planned to pass along the love of the outdoors that her parents learned from their mothers, both Boy Scout leaders.\n\n“It’s a way of life. Camping and hiking and nature is a culture you don’t find that in other places,” Jessica said.\n\nBackpacks outnumbered suitcases 8:1 on the Voyageur II.\n\nDeckhand Kirk Johnson and Capt. Ben Silence tossed the bags from dock to ferry as if they were pillows. Travelers bound for Isle Royale National Park pulled stocking caps tighter, mugged for photos in front of the 65-foot-long craft they waited to board.\n\n“There is a very big sense that you are going somewhere that is different from where you were. Part of that is the journey,” said Val Martin, an Isle Royale ranger based at the Windigo station.\n\n“We leave behind the security of knowing we can get back home again on the schedule we would like to,\" Martin said. \"So there is a sense of risk involved. Sometimes there’s really a sense of risk involved when Lake Superior’s not so friendly.”\n\nIsle Royale isn’t a place easily visited on a whim. It’s a 6.5-hour drive from St. Cloud to Grand Portage. It requires a ferry reservation (about $170 to and from Windigo; about $240 if you circumnavigate the island, with an overnight stop at Rock Harbor). It takes time.\n\nThe ferry moves about 12 mph. Getting to Windigo takes about two hours in calm waters. Rock Harbor is another five hours.\n\nHappily, both passengers and scenery proved interesting. There’s coffee on board, and books about island hiking and history.\n\nIn mid-June, passengers included a bluegrass musician, a group of teachers, a Michigan woman visiting her ranger-daughter, 14-year-olds from the Twin Cities-based Venture Crew 93 (a co-ed scouting organization), a few young couples, two teenage sisters backpacking on their own while their father photographed moose.\n\nWe passed Rock of Ages Lighthouse, anchored to rock not much bigger than the structure itself. On the way back, under clear skies we stopped at the America, a 1928 shipwreck just under the surface, marked by buoys just outside Washington Harbor.\n\nThe engines were loud, but some passengers managed to sleep on the way — at least until the deckhand banged the coffee pot filter against the garbage can to free the grounds.\n\nIn mid-June, it was cool enough to wear three layers plus gloves. Only a few braved the deck, most of them only briefly.\n\nTravel details\n\nPARK SITE: Find maps to backcountry requirements (camping is free, $25 or $50, depending upon group size), lodging options, interpretive programs, fishing refulations and transportation options (In Minnesota, ferries launch from Grand Portage. In Michigan, a ferry and seaplane launch from Houghton; a ferry launches from Copper Harbor.) at www.nps.gov/isro/index.htm.\n\nNEARBY LODGING: If you don’t want to camp or drive 30 miles to catch a 6:45 a.m. ferry, Grand Portage Lodge & Casino is your one option. In mid-June, it offered discounts to guests bound for Isle Royale. The casino was under construction. Besides hotel-style rooms, it's got cabins and an recreational vehicle park. Details: www.grandportage.com.\n\nIsle Royale is nearly synonymous with the Greenstone Ridge Trail, a 40-mile-long backpacking route.\n\nBut there’s more to this national park than the Greenstone. And even that trail is easily hiked in segments.\n\nWindigo proved the perfect base for hiking in mid-June, when the waterproof comfort of a remarkably clean camper cabin was more than welcome. Described as a shelter with a screened front, it was actually a four-walled structure with windows, electricity (but no heat or running water), a front porch, indoor table and outdoor picnic table.\n\nSituated just behind the camp store (up the hill from the bay and the ranger station), two camper cabins, run by Rock Harbor Lodge, shared a water spigot and biffy. The “comfort station” at the bottom of the hill near the docks had running water in the restrooms and a pay-shower ($5 per five-minute, token-operated shower; one of three was in working order).\n\nWith only one full day to hike, my sister and I took the ranger’s advice and struck out on the 10-plus-mile Huginnin Cove Loop Trail, counter-clockwise.\n\nAgain following the ranger’s advice, we took our time during the first half of the hike, which crossed uncounted streams and slippery, one-plank boardwalks, meandered through shoulder-high thimbleberries on muddy trails, passed through flooded stretches under a canopy that changed from a maple-heavy inland mix to cedars closer to the Lake Superior shore.\n\nFinally, we rounded a corner and entered a magical, mile-long stretch where a gray and brooding Lake Superior stretched beyond weather-stunted trees and moss-covered boulders crowded by bunchberries and topped by springy lichens.\n\nHere, where the undulating trail dipped to water-level, was Huginnin Cove Campground, a well-spaced line of campsites that could set the standard for wilderness camping with a view.\n\nAs promised, the western half of the loop didn’t call for as many photos. It was a lot of up-and-down, through less diverse scenery filled with tall shrubs that swallowed hikers whole. It was the sort of trail that got a person thinking about the term self-rescue and the lack of cellphone service, wondering exactly what a rampaging moose sounded like and pondering the great abundance of moose evidence.\n\nThe up-close moose encounter came later, on the gravel lane between Washington Creek Campground and the comfort station. Two moose emerged from the trees as a pair of campers approached, seemingly oblivious, from the direction of the shower building. My sister and I crashed into the brush to get behind a tree, signaled to the pair coming up behind us. Eventually, the campers noticed the moose. There was a bit of a stare-down, but no flattened moose ears, a sign an animal might be on the verge of charging.\n\nThe moose eventually ambled off into the brush.\n\nThe fact that 1,300 more roamed the island, unseen, made me wonder what else I was missing, underscored the need to return.\n\nAdventure options\n\nIF YOU WANT TO BACKPACK WITH KIDS: With three campgrounds relatively close (Washington Creek is a short jaunt; Huginnin Cove is about five miles; Feldtmann Lake is about 8.5). All three campgrounds are good for wildlife-watching. Windigo makes an easy base for exploration. The island is free of bears, poison ivy, deer ticks, woodticks and raccoons. Elevation gain is manageable. Other easily accessible trails include Feldtmann, Minong and Greenstone ridge trails. Here, you can hike as far as you want, but you don’t have to push to meet a ferry.\n\nWINDIGO, REVISED: If I had it to do over again with only four days’ time, I’d stay at Windigo three nights (camper cabins, $52; pay showers, $5). Doing so would save time and money (in lodging and ferry fare), and allow more time on the trail. The camper cabins provided welcome, secure shelter on some rainy, cold nights. Later in the season, I might consider camping. But this June, the cabin was the place to be. My biggest regret was not getting onto the Greenstone Ridge Trail.\n\nCOMFORT, AT A PREMIUM: The suitcase-toters on the ferry tended to be a bit older, and destined for Rock Harbor. From the 60-room lodge or surrounding cabins (both run about $250 a night), it’s possible to catch a sightseeing ferry to a nearby island, explore a lighthouse, soak in a bit of copper mining history, do some paddling (rentals are available), fishing or hiking. A dining room serves three meals a day; housekeeping cabins come with equipped kitchens.\n\nIF YOU WANT DISTANCE: The 40-mile Greenstone Ridge Trail draws serious backpackers and groups bent on traversing the backbone of Isle Royale. Those who mark accomplishment in miles wind up here, taking in expansive views. The trail shares a name with the park newspaper, which describes the volcano-formed ridge-and-valley topography. The ridge itself is part of the Greenstone flow, the largest known lava flow in the world, the newspaper states.\n\nPractical advice\n\nBring a watch. If you must know what time it is to catch a ferry, for example, bring a watch. Grand Portage is on Central Time, and the ferry service stays in that zone. Isle Royale is on Eastern Time. On the island, my phone switched between the two.\n\nYou’re on your own. Bring a first aid kit and other emergency supplies, and know how to use them. There is zero cellphone service; you can’t call for help. Getting out with an injury, or helping someone else, on a narrow path rushing with water would be difficult.\n\nDon’t bother too much with the forecast. Aside from being aware of severe weather, don’t waste time checking a forecast that could change many times throughout the day. Bring rain gear.\n\nMind the footwear. Small plastic shopping bags make great boot liners, keeping socks dry when boots remain soaked from the day before. Tying your laces through the tab of a tent zipper will prevent fox from making off with your boots.\n\nBring duct tape. For everything. Including a friction-free fill-in for moleskin.\n\nWolves\n\nPhotograph evidence of wolves, rangers tell everyone during a mandatory introduction, and report the location of scat, pawprints or wolf sightings. Only two, inbred wolves are believed to be on the island. (That’s based on tracks, not sightings.) A decision on an environmental impact statement that will guide wolf management is expected by fall 2017. The predator-prey relationship between moose and wolves has been studied since 1958.
