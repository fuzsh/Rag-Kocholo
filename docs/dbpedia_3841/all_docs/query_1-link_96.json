        "text": "Planning Your Trip to Isle Royale\n\nThe National Park Service boasts that 99.9% of the land area on Isle Royale is federally designated wilderness, and I say this to tell you that the best way to see Isle Royale National Park is, without a doubt, in the backcountry!\n\nBeing the case, donâ€™t book the ferry around the island and expect that to be your Isle Royale visit.\n\nRiding the ferry is quite literally the worst part about visiting Isle Royale, and I donâ€™t say this to talk bad about the ferry business.\n\nHow to Decide What to Do in Isle Royale?\n\nSome of the best advice I can give is to simply look over the map below and decide what looks fun. Itâ€™s amazing how random an itinerary can get on these lakes, islands, and trails.\n\nThat being said, an average stay on Isle Royale is anywhere from 7 to 12 days, which made our 5-day trip seem like nothing.\n\nHowever, planning your trip is truly dependent on getting on and off the island, so even if you only plan on taking the Voyageur II around Isle Royale, youâ€™re still committed to staying on the island for one night in Rock Harbor before you return back to Grand Portage.\n\nThis all means that depending on where you want to get dropped off and picked up, you may need to commit to a few extra days, depending on the ferryâ€™s schedule. For example, we started our trip on June 1st and got picked up at Malone Bay on June 5th. If we even wanted even just one more day on the island to move a little slower while taking this same route, then we would have had to commit to at least three more nights because our next pick up wouldnâ€™t have been until June 8th.\n\nThis is all to say that whenever the Grand Portage ferry leaves for Isle Royale, they only circle half of the island in one day, staying overnight in Rock Harbor every time because the journey takes that long.\n\nWhat are Some Common Isle Royale Trip Itineraries?\n\nSimply by talking with other groups, some of the most common trip itineraries were hiking visitor center to visitor center, or some groups would hike the Greenstone Ridge one way and return back to Windigo on Minong Ridge.\n\nIf youâ€™re considering either of these two options, I recommend starting at Windigo, so that you can have a much shorter ferry ride both to and from the park.\n\nThat being said, other groups would get much more creative, making the most random routes on the trails around the island. Some people would get dropped off at one place for a few days, then wait for the ferry to come back around and take it to the next stop as they worked their way around Isle Royale. For example, one person wanted to start at Belle Isle, then continue onto Rock Harbor a few days later, and so on.\n\nWhen other groups heard of our itinerary, we were looked at like the crazy ones for wanting to take a canoe onto Isle Royale. However, after two trips to the BWCA and one to Voyageurs National Park, there was no doubt in my mind that if we were going to do the Chain of Lakes, we had to have a canoe.\n\nHaving a canoe also gives you access to paddle-only campgrounds that are not otherwise accessible from any other trail, like Wood Lake. Furthermore, campgrounds that are off of the main trail tend to be incredibly busy, and it kind of ruins the backcountry experience at places like West Chickenbone or Lake Richie. However, I am spoiled after first visiting Voyageurs a few years earlier, where the campsite you reserve is 100% yours, and you will be the only group on that lake for your entire visit.\n\nWhat is the Best Time of Year to Visit Isle Royale?\n\nIn my opinion, I answer this question around the mosquitoes and biting flies, which can be horrible whenever the temperatures start to reach the mid-50s and 60s.\n\nBeing the case, I would only ever visit Isle Royale, Voyageurs, or the BWCA at the end of May/ beginning of June or mid-September through October. The latter would be incredible for amazing fall fishing, and the beautiful changing colors.\n\nHowever, the busy season begins in July and if this is you, plan on bringing a bug net.\n\nGetting to Isle Royale National Park\n\nThe most practical and popular option is to take one of the four ferries from either from Grand Portage, MN, Houghton, MI, or Copper Harbor, MI.\n\nHowever, if you want to get to Isle Royale faster, sea planes can be the better, more expensive option, but a sea plane limits the amount of weight you are allowed to take with you on your trip.\n\nIn any case, should you are decide to begin at any of the niche trailheads, like McCargoe, Belle Isle, Daisy Farm, Chippewa Harbor, or Malone Bay, then you are restricted to the Voyageur II, which leaves from Grand Portage. This is because all of the other ferries are only good for roundtrip transportation to the two visitor centers.\n\nTo this point, take either the Ranger III or the Isle Royale Queen IV from Michigan if you want to begin from Rock Harbor. If not, you will be on the Voyageur II, which will take much longer, as the boat stops at all of the niche trailheads along the way. They say they will skip these trailheads 'if' they donâ€™t have people getting off, but it seems like they will always have people getting off at each stop.\n\nAs a side note, if you want a canoe on the inland waters, the ferries will transport a canoeâ€”either rented or personally ownedâ€”on the ferries. However, the canoes that the National Park Service rents out on the island are only intended for the immediate areas near the visitor centers in which they are rented, not the backcountry.\n\nIsle Royale Ferry\n\nThe Voyager II out of Grand Portage, Minnesota is a very good, professional, and knowledgable business to get you to and from Isle Royale safely. However, I mentioned previously that taking the ferry is the worst part about the trip, and thatâ€™s because of how slow it is.\n\nIt took longer to get where we were going than the times posted, and the slow trip feels even worse when youâ€™re leaving the island and youâ€™re tired, hungry, and in need of a shower!\n\nHowever, the ferry is a necessary evil, which is why I recommend that you bring some small headphones and download a movie or two because whether you leave from Minnesota or Michigan, you will be bored and possibly sea sick for the majority of the transit.\n\nGoogle Maps Directions: Grand Portage Ferry Pier\n\nHow to Get Isle Royale Backcountry Permits?\n\nPermits in Isle Royale National Park are issued only once you arrive in the park, at either Rock Harbor or Windigo. This means one cannot reserve a site ahead of time, and the same goes for off-trail or what they call 'cross-country permits.'\n\nAt first, I was wondering how we would get the permit for where we wanted, but as long as your ferry ride is scheduled for your desired drop-off and pick-up, then you should have no issue explaining your itinerary once you get off at either visitor center.\n\nI believe they do it this way because of the parkâ€™s remote nature and high chance that individuals wonâ€™t undertake the proper planning before visiting. From what I could gather, it seems that there are many people who would like to visit the park, but they never actually follow through because visiting Isle Royale is not like driving up to Zion and paying your entrance fee.\n\nHow to Pay Isle Royale National Park Entrance Fees?\n\nIsle Royale National Park entrance fees can either be paid in advance online, which is what the National Park Service recommends, or in person once you get to the island.\n\nHowever, if you have a valid park pass, bring it to the island; they will verify your pass at the same time they issue your permit.\n\nPay Here: Isle Royale National Park Entrance Fee\n\nAfter breakfast and a stunning sunrise, we set off for the portage to Lake Livermore. We knew that we were going to pass over a few lakes with our amount of days, so Lake Livermore was our first of three that we didnâ€™t stay at.\n\nThis didnâ€™t bother me too much because from what I read out of a fishing guide, the fishing on Livermore is really take it or leave it. There are better lakes to fish on Isle Royale, but you can expect to catch Northern Pike on Livermore if you do fish it.\n\nIn any case, the paddle from West Chickenbone to the Lake Livermore portage is about 0.8 miles (1.3 km), which is located right in the middle of the smallest strip of land between both Chickenbone Lake and Lake Livermore.\n\nChickenbone-Livermore-Greenstone Ridge Junction\n\nOn this portage, we crossed over Greenstone Ridge, so itâ€™s important to know exactly what turn to make because it can be confusing.\n\nWhen you come to the split at the stream, cross over the stream and head uphill after the stream crossing. If you end up following the stream, you will actually be on the Greenstone Ridge and hiking in the wrong direction.\n\nWhen we first hiked over to Siskiwit Lake with our bags, the waves were pretty mild.\n\nHowever, by the time we returned with the canoe, the wind picked up, and the lake was averaging at least one-foot swells. This wouldnâ€™t have been so bad with only two people and two bags, but with three people and three bags, we were sitting very low in the water.\n\nThis inevitably meant a number of waves came over the top and nearly swamped our canoe, which likely would have meant lost bags on top of trying to swim to shore to get everything back in order. In addition, Siskiwit Lake was not warm in early June, which also could have meant hypothermia with the strong winds we were fighting.\n\nTake a look at our route below, as we hid behind every island that we could on the east end of Siskiwit to get to Wood Lake.\n\nNevertheless, we thankfully made it to Wood Lake safely after a number of close calls and fighting the wind to keep the canoe the way we wanted it.\n\nThis route was about 2 miles (3.2 km) of paddling from the portage to the Wood Lake campsite.\n\nFishing on Sikiwit Lake\n\nAfter trying for about 5 hours on the water, we caught nothing, despite trying many different spots, depths, and lures. Fishing Siskiwit Lake during the first week of June was extremely tricky, as it seemed like nothing was working, and it appeared as if the fish were still waiting for things to warm up.\n\nAfter our first time out, I took a short break only to return 30 minutes later by myself to keep trying. The amazing thing was that you could see at least 30 ft. (9.1 m) down when the water was calm because of how clear it was, but I could not find a single fish in the first 30 ft. (9.1 m) of water. I was wondering how successful the loons must have been because I couldnâ€™t even find any bait fish swimming around.\n\nThen, at around 5:45 p.m., I was fishing with a spoon, casting it out into some pretty deep water. When I cast, I let the spoon sink for about 30 seconds before I started to reel it in slowly. Thatâ€™s when I felt a couple of taps and figured I was just on the bottom. However, it started to pull the line out, which was the most action I felt all day. After fighting the fish for about 30 seconds, it broke free, which was pretty heartbreaking to lose the one fish I had on the line after nearly 8 hours of fishing by that point!\n\nThen, two casts later using the same technique, I had it on again. This time I was trying to be much more careful because I didnâ€™t know what I was hooking into. I barely set the hook to try not to fight back too hard, like when I lost it the first time. After over a minute of fighting, I had it about 10 ft. (3 m) below the canoe, and I could see that it was a beautiful Lake Trout. However, just as I was starting to try to bring it in, it broke free for a second time!\n\nThis was was my first Lake Trout that I had ever hooked into, so everything about catching one was unfamiliar to me. Unlike a Northern Pike, Walleye, or Bass that gets on the line and fights against you by swimming away, these Lake Trout donâ€™t just swim away from you, but rather, they twist and turn in every direction, as they thrash and try to get off of the line. Therefore, I consider catching Pike, Walleye, and Bass to be pretty easy compared to one of these Lake Trout.\n\nAfter it got off the second time I didnâ€™t feel anything using the same technique for a while after. However, after about 20 minutes, I was onto a fish again. This time I was being as delicate as I have ever been trying to reel in a fish, and when I finally got it about 10 ft. (3 m) below the canoe, I could see that I barely had it hooked with only one hook on the treble of my spoon. When I finally had it close enough to reach for my net, it dove back down below the canoe. Then, when I had it back up again, I tried netting the trout only for it to thrash back out and dive below the canoe again. On my third attempt with the net, I finally landed this beautiful Lake Trout that you see in the photo here, and I can honestly say that Iâ€™ve never worked so hard to catch one fish!\n\nThereâ€™s no way catching it would have been possible without the net, and I estimate that I hooked into the trout at least 40-50 ft. (12-15 m) down after looking at a depth chart of Siskiwit Lake at the time of writing this post.\n\nShortly after catching the trout, I headed back to Malone Bay to clean the catch and make dinner.\n\nThere is a fish-cleaning station at Malone Bay to the right of the dock behind the fuel tank on the point, but I couldnâ€™t figure out where it was when I needed to fillet the trout.\n\nFishing on Inland Lakes in Isle Royale\n\nFishing on any of the inland waters in Isle Royale National Park does not require a fishing license. However, a Michigan fishing license is required if you fish on any of the Lake Superior waters.\n\nPlease follow all Isle Royale Fishing regulations, and any regulations that are not specifically mentioned on this website fall under the general Michigan fishing regulations.\n\nFor example, keeping any of the small pike that we caught on Lake LeSage would have been far too small, not to mention how tedious it would be to fillet something that small.\n\nMy Fishing Experience in Isle Royale\n\nSince we were visiting so early in the season, fishing was a challenge in Isle Royale compared to the rest of my trips in the BWCA and Voyageurs National Park, where the temperatures were a bit warmer.\n\nWith temperatures, on average, around the mid-50s during the day and in the high 30s at night, we only caught fish on two of the four lakes we camped on. If you visit any later in the summer, the fishing should ideally be much more active, but you sacrifice the temps with biting insects.\n\nNevertheless, I previously mentioned that I was fishing Siskiwit Lakeâ€”extremely deep for most types of fishingâ€”and I believe we were having luck on LeSage because that was our nicest and warmest day on our entire trip.\n\nIn all, I believe we were riding a fine line between it being too cold and a waste of weight carrying the fishing gear, and some of the best and most active fishing in the country on these lakes that donâ€™t have high fishing pressure.\n\nIsle Royale vs. Voyageurs National Park\n\nRegardless of my opinions below, do not let my thoughts steer you away from visiting one park over another. They are both incredible National Parks if you get into the backcountry.\n\nThat being said, if you are looking to hike/ backpack, visit Isle Royale. Voyageurs National Park is much more renowned for its beautiful, secluded backcountry lakes than its trails. However, backpacking across Isle Royale is just one of the many adventures that you could choose.\n\nWhile itâ€™s very popular to hike from visitor center to visitor center on Isle Royale, you can see from our trip on the Chain of Lakes that we choose just one of countless different combinations for a trip.\n\nIn any case, if backcountry fishing interests you more, then Voyageurs National Park is more of the park for you. Even though we did a lot of backcountry fishing on Isle Royale, I believe that Voyageurs is better suited for it because on the inland lakes in Voyageurs, portaging a canoe is not required, whereas we had to portage across the Chain of Lakes on Isle Royale.\n\nWhen it comes to choosing between either Isle Royale and Voyageurs National Park, my overall recommendation is Voyageurs, and I say this for a number of reasons, centered mainly around the ferry, how each park operates their permitting, and how busy each park gets.\n\nFirst and foremost, the ferry is pain. The ferry is very slow, annoying, and it makes visiting Isle Royale one of the most expensive National Parks in the lower 48.\n\nFor three people transporting and renting 1 canoe, it cost us $889 (2022 prices), and we were lucky to not have to cover the park entrance fee. Thatâ€™s a massive barrier to entry over many other National Parks, and the cost only goes up from here if you choose to fly in by sea plane.\n\nThe second reason I choose Voyageurs over Isle Royale is because Isle Royale is busy! They like to tell you that visiting a secluded hard-to-get-to island on Lake Superior is its own barrier to entry, but Isle Royaleâ€™s backcountry was by far, more crowded than Voyageurs.\n\nVoyageurs may have more visitors overall, but that is mainly because of the large lakes surrounding the backcountry, meaning that the backcountry in Voyageurs National Park is, by and large, less visited than the backcountry on Isle Royale.\n\nAs previously mentioned, when you reserve a backcountry site in Voyageurs, itâ€™s yours, and you will be the only group on that lake because there is only one campsite per lake. Therefore, after this experience in Voyageurs, I thought it was a little annoying to arrive at what youâ€™d think would be a quiet backcountry site on Isle Royale, only to be hunting to find a spot to camp, like our experience at West Chickenbone, and keep in mind that we werenâ€™t even visiting during the busy season.\n\nIt seems that as long as you pay for your way to Isle Royale, they will issue any number of backcountry permits needed, which is what I meant by how the park operates. I donâ€™t believe that Isle Royale should be restricting visitors, but finding a way to prevent overcrowding in the backcountry at popular spots should be a priority."
