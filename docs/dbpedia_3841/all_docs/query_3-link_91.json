        "text": "Isle Royale National Park is often forgotten; undeservedly so. Located above Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, this half-million acre park consists of 400 islands with a variety of hiking and camping options. Isle Royale camping is only allowed at 36 wilderness campgrounds, all of which can only be reached by watercraft. But in northern Lake Superior, being on the water is as much a part of the experience as the land. One of the best trails in Isle Royale National Park is the Scoville Point Loop, while the Island Traverse is perfect for longer hikes. You may not see many other people during your stay: Isle Royale is one of America’s least-visited national parks. In our opinion that makes it all the more special."
