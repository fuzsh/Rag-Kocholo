One of very few island national parks, it features dense wilderness, picturesque harbors, many gorgeous inland lakes, and high rocky ridges with broad vistas of Lake Superior. The second largest island in the Great Lakes, Isle Royale is about 45 miles long and 9 miles wide at the widest. There are no roads of any kind or condition. All travel is by foot or boat. The island is surrounded by hundreds of smaller islands, outcroppings, reefs, and shoals. 99% of the island is federally protected wilderness. Isle Royale is well known for its wildlife, particularly populations of moose and wolves living in natural balance.\n\nARRIVING in COPPER HARBOR\n\nIf you plan to stay overnight in Copper Harbor before or after your trip a list of places to stay can be found below.

This area features the charming Rock Harbor Lodge, the Lodge's popular duplex cottages, and other amenities, such as a gift shop, the Lodge Dining Room, the Greenstone Grill, the Lodge General Store, and the NPS Visitors Center. Washington Harbor, which is at the other end of the island features a snack bar and Visitors Center. Visit Captain Ben's Visiting Isle Royale Blog,which has an introduction to Isle Royale National Park and lots of information on what to do and see on Isle Royale.\n\nThere are over 165 miles of foot trails, numerous of inland lakes with outstanding fishing, and fjord-like harbors off Lake Superior that are perfect for boating, canoeing, and kayaking. The island is also an educational experience for young and old. At some campsites, the rangers provide nightly lectures about Isle Royale and the very delicate balance of nature the island supports. One of the most famous wildlife research studies in the world takes place on Isle Royale, where Michigan Tech researches study the balance of predator and prey between the wolf and moose populations. Most backpackers will see a moose or two on the trail, and several have been spotted by day passengers while on their short walks near the Rock Harbor Lodge. A few wolves have been seen during the summer in recent years. Often, at night when the moon is bright, their haunting howling can be heard.\n\nRock Harbor Lodge Guest Activities, Day Trip Guide, Trail & Hiking Routes (PDF)\n\nGUIDE to ISLE ROYALE\n\nCaptain Ben Kilpela has written an excellent pamphlet on visiting IR, \"Exploring Northeast Isle Royale.\" It's available at www.lulu.com or from our offices by phone.\n\nOTHER ITEMS of NOTE\n\nNATIONAL PARK SERVICE\n\nFor more information about the Isle Royale National Park and policies governing the park visit the park's official website www.nps.gov/isro/\n\nOther interesting and useful information can be within the park's newspaper \"The Greenstone\".\n\nPLEASE NOTE:"
