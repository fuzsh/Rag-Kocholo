Our village has become the principal port of departure for visitors to America’s great island national park, currently on the 100-foot ferry the Isle Royale Queen IV. The Queen is a fast, comfortable, and safe ship that makes one of the longest ferry runs across open waters in the United States. The Donald Kilpela family has held the franchise for this national park service since 1971. Crossing time on the Queen is 3 hours and 45 minutes. Conditions on Lake Superior in summer are mostly favorable for enjoyable crossings to the magnificent Isle Royale wilderness.\n\n>Website | 906-289-4437 | Brockway & Waterfront Landing (5th Street)"
