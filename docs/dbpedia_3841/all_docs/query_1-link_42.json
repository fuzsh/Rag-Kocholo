        "text": "How to Do a Day Trip to Isle Royale National Park\n\nLooking to spend just a day in Isle Royale National Park? We’ve got you covered! We’ll go over everything you need to know to take a day trip to Isle Royale, including options for getting there, when to go, and how to plan your time.\n\nIsle Royale National Park is a pristine island wilderness that sits in the middle of the country’s largest freshwater lake – Lake Superior. It can be quite a challenge, and also quite expensive, to organize transportation to get to this hidden gem of the National Park System, so many people often wonder, is it possible to go to Isle Royale for just the day?\n\nWe’re here to tell you that yes…you can do Isle Royale in a day! Depending on the mode of transportation you use to get there, your time may be very limited, but regardless, you’ll still get to experience some of the top sights of Isle Royale and get a glimpse into the beauty and solitude that makes this park so special.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll go over everything you need to know to take a day trip to Isle Royale National Park. We’ll cover where you can go, how to get there, things to do, and how to plan out your limited time by giving you some Isle Royale day trip itineraries.\n\nSo, let’s dive right in!\n\nBUT FIRST! If you’re planning a trip to Isle Royale and looking for more in depth information about all the things to do, all the ways of getting there, and more, check out all of our Isle Royale guides to help you plan!\n\nIn this Isle Royale day trip guide:\n\nIs a day trip to Isle Royale worth it?\n\nWhere to go in Isle Royale in a day\n\nIsle Royale National Park map\n\nIsle Royale day trip: How to get there\n\nIsle Royale day trip from Copper Harbor, MI\n\nIsle Royale day trip from Houghton, MI\n\nIsle Royale day trip from Grand Portage, MN\n\nIsle Royale day trip from Grand Marais, MN\n\nIsle Royale day trip with a private boat\n\nThings to do in Isle Royale in a day\n\nIsle Royale one day itinerary: Rock Harbor\n\nIsle Royale one day itinerary: Windigo\n\nIs it better to visit Rock Harbor or Windigo on a day trip to Isle Royale?\n\nBest time to take an Isle Royale day trip\n\nMore information for your day trip to Isle Royale National Park\n\nIs a Day Trip to Isle Royale Worth It?\n\nOrganizing a trip to Isle Royale can be quite daunting, as there are so many different ways of getting there and all of these options can be quite expensive. So it makes sense to really want to maximize your time on the island and try to see as much as you. Many people visit Isle Royale to spend several days in the Isle Royale wilderness, soaking up the solitude, camping, backpacking, and just generally getting away from it all for a bit.\n\nBut we get it, not everyone has a lot of time to visit Isle Royale, and not everyone may be into camping and backpacking. So, it is still worth it to visit Isle Royale for just a day?\n\nWe think so! It may not be ideal, but if that’s all the time you have, it will still allow you to experience the island and get a taste of what makes it so special. As you will see in our Isle Royale day trip itineraries below, you’ll still be able to hike a trail or two, maybe spot some wildlife, relax by the lake, and maybe go for a paddle around the harbors. You might not get to spend days on the trail hiking from camp to camp, but since all of Isle Royale is designated wilderness, as soon as you step onto the island you’ll experience the solitude and peacefulness that makes Isle Royale the most revisted National Park in the country.\n\nWhere to Go in Isle Royale in a Day\n\nIf you only have a day in Isle Royale National Park, there are two main areas you can choose from to spend your time…Rock Harbor and Windigo.\n\nRock Harbor is on the eastern tip of Isle Royale. It has a visitor center, along with lodging that has a restaurant, tour services, and boat rentals. Plus, several of Isle Royale’s best day hikes start from here.\n\nWindigo is on the western side of the island. There’s less going on here, making it have a bit more of an isolated and wild feel to it. There’s a visitor center and small camp store, and several day hikes and backpacking trips begin here.\n\nBecause they lie on different ends of the island, you’ll have to choose either Rock Harbor or Windigo to spend your one day in Isle Royale. Which one you decide to visit will in part dictate which mode of transportation you take to Isle Royale and where you will be leaving from (Michigan or Minnesota).\n\nIsle Royale National Park map\n\nThis map shows a general overview of Isle Royale in relation to the mainland.\n\nAs you can see, it sits in the middle of Lake Superior, with four different access points from the mainland…two in Michigan and two in Minnesota. Each departure point has its own options for transportation (ferry and/or seaplane) and where they arrive on the island.\n\nBelow, we get into how to choose which mode of transportation to take to do a day trip to Isle Royale.\n\nIsle Royale Day Trip: How to Get There\n\nAs you saw above, there are four different departure points to Isle Royale from the mainland. Each departure point has its own set of transportation options to the island, with their own distinct schedules, costs, and destinations on the island. Not all of them allow for a day trip to Isle Royale, so below, we’ll go over only those options that you can use to visit Isle Royale for a just a day.\n\nYou can choose which option is the best for you based on how much time you want to have in Isle Royale, how much money you want to spend, which part of the island you want to visit, and what the most convenient departure point is for you.\n\nREAD MORE: For more in depth information on all the ways to get to Isle Royale, check out our complete Isle Royale National Park guide!\n\nIsle Royale day trip from Copper Harbor, MI\n\nIf you’re looking to visit Isle Royale for the day from Copper Harbor, Michigan, then your option will be to take the Isle Royale Queen IV ferry. This will bring you to Rock Harbor only, not Windigo.\n\nThe Queen IV ferry runs from about mid- May to end of September each year, and its schedule varies depending on the time of year.\n\nThis year the ferry’s schedule looks like this:\n\nMay 15th to June 2nd: Runs Mondays and Fridays\n\nJune 5th-June 30th: Runs Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays\n\nJuly: Runs every day except Wednesdays\n\nAugust 1st- September 9th: Runs every day (with some exceptions)\n\nSeptember 11th- September 29th: Runs Monday and Fridays\n\nHow long will you have on the island if you do a day trip to Isle Royale from Copper Harbor?\n\nEvery time the ferry runs, it makes a same day round trip, leaving Copper Harbor at 8 am EST and getting there at about 11:45 am. Then it leaves the island at 2:45 pm, returning to Copper Harbor around 6:30 pm. This gives you just three hours to spend on Isle Royale.\n\nHow much will a day trip to Isle Royale cost from Copper Harbor?\n\nThe cost of a round trip ferry ride from Copper Harbor is $160 (less for children). There is also a daily parking fee of $10 in their lot.\n\nIsle Royale day trip from Houghton, MI\n\nTo take a day trip to Isle Royale from Houghton, Michigan, you’ll have to take the Isle Royale seaplane.\n\nTaking a seaplane provides way more flexibility than a ferry, and you’ll have more of your day to spend on the island. Plus, you can choose to go to either Rock Harbor or Windigo from here.\n\nThe seaplanes run every day from May 21st to September 16th. You have a variety of times to pick from to get to and from the island, with advanced reservation based on availability.\n\nHow long will you have on the island if you do a day trip to Isle Royale from Copper Harbor?\n\nIf you decide to take a day trip to Isle Royale on a seaplane, you’ll get to spend much more of your day on the island.\n\nFlights run every day to Isle Royale at the following times:\n\nHoughton to Rock Harbor or Windigo: 8 am, 10 am, 2 pm, and 4 pm EST\n\nRock Harbor or Windigo to Houghton: 9 am, 11 am, 3 pm, and 5 pm EST\n\nFlights last about 40 minutes. Therefore, if you take the earliest flight in and the latest flight out, you’d get a full 8 hours in Isle Royale!\n\nHow much will a day trip to Isle Royale cost from Copper Harbor?\n\nThis greater time and flexibility for your Isle Royale day trip comes with a price.\n\nA round trip flight to either Rock Harbor or Windigo costs $360. You’ll also have to pay to park your car at the seaplane lot, which is $6 per day.\n\nIsle Royale day trip from Grand Portage, MN\n\nThere are two ferries that run from Grand Portage to Isle Royale. One offers day trips to Isle Royale all season, while the other offers limited options for day trips in the fall.\n\nFrom Grand Portage, you’ll be able to take an Isle Royale day trip to Windigo only, not Rock Harbor.\n\nThe Sea Hunter III ferry\n\nThis Grand Portage ferry offers nearly daily round trip rides to Windigo during peak season. Its schedule varies by the year, but this year’s schedule looks like this:\n\nFrom June 7th-July 8th, and from August 16th to September 2nd, the ferry runs round trips from Grand Portage to Windigo on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays.\n\nFrom July 12th to August 13th, the ferry runs round trips from Wednesdays to Sundays.\n\nThe ferry departs Grand Portage at 8:30 am CDT and then leaves Windigo at 2 pm CDT the same day.\n\nThe Voyageur II ferry\n\nThe Voyageur II runs all season long, however it only offers the option for Isle Royale day trips in select weekends at the end of the season. This year, those dates are September 23rd, 24th, 30th, and October 1st.\n\nOn these days, the ferry departs Grand Portage at 8 am CDT, arriving in Windigo at 10 am CDT and heads back to Grand Portage at 1 pm CDT, arriving at Grand Portage at 3 pm CDT.\n\nHow long will you have on the island if you do a day trip to Isle Royale from Grand Portage?\n\nIf you take a day trip to Isle Royale on The Sea Hunter III, the ferry arrives at Windigo at 10 am CDT and departs back to Grand Portage at 2 pm, meaning you have roughly 4 hours to spend in Isle Royale.\n\nWith the Voyageur II, the ferry arrives in Windigo at 10 am CDT and leaves at 1 pm, meaning you only have three short hours to spend on the island.\n\nHow much will a day trip to Isle Royale cost from Grand Portage?\n\nA perk to doing a day trip to Isle Royale from Grand Portage is that the ferries here offer discounted rates for a same day round trip ferry ride. Normally, a one- way ticket price costs $87, but scheduling a day trip to Isle Royale costs only $99 for the whole roundtrip ride!\n\nYou’ll also have to pay for parking here, which is $5 per day.\n\nIsle Royale day trip from Grand Marais, MN\n\nTo do a day trip to Isle Royale from Grand Marais means you’ll have to take the Isle Royale seaplane. This is the same company that operates out of Houghton, MI, and from here, you can choose to go to either Windigo or Rock Harbor.\n\nYou can request a reservation for an Isle Royale seaplane for dates between May 21st and September 16th and will be booked based on availability for your requested dates and times.\n\nHow long will you have on the island if you do a day trip to Isle Royale from Grand Marais?\n\nThe seaplane from Grand Marais doesn’t provide you with quite the time advantage as the one out of Houghton does.\n\nDeparture times for Isle Royale are 9 am and 3 pm CDT while flights from Isle Royale back to the mainland are at 8 am and 2 pm CDT.\n\nFlights to Windigo are about 25 minutes long and flights to Rock Harbor are about 45 minutes long. This means you’ll have about 4 hours or so to spend on Isle Royale.\n\nHow much will a day trip to Isle Royale cost from Grand Marais?\n\nFrom Grand Marais, round trip fares are $340 to Windigo and $440 to Rock Harbor. It’s a pretty significant cost over the ferry for not too much more time on the island.\n\nParking at this location is free.\n\nIsle Royale day trip with a private boat\n\nIf you’re lucky enough to have your own boat in the area, then you can absolutely bypass the hassle of relying on public transportation schedules and go on your own. This is the most flexible way to do a day trip to Isle Royale as you can maximize your time on the island. Check out all the information you need from the park service about bringing your own boat to Isle Royale.\n\nThings to Do in Isle Royale in a Day\n\nThough your time might be pretty limited, there are still quite a few things you can do and see if you only have a day on Isle Royale.\n\nThings to do on a day trip to Isle Royale include:\n\nGo on a day hike- Both Windigo and Rock Harbor have a handful of shorter day hikes that you can do with just a few hours on the island. The Scoville Point Loop is in Rock Harbor and is one of our favorites! In Rock Harbor, others include a hike to Suzy’s Cave or to Lookout Louise. In Windigo, your best bet for a quick day hike would be either the Windigo Nature Trail or Grace Creek Overlook.\n\nLEARN MORE: For more information about all the day hikes in Isle Royale National Park, check out our complete Isle Royale hiking guide.\n\nGo for a paddle- Canoes and kayaks can be rented in both Rock Harbor and Windigo. While it’s not necessarily recommended that you paddle out in Lake Superior itself, each side of the island has quiet and calm harbors where you can paddle along the shoreline and hopefully spot some wildlife.\n\nCheck out the visitor center and ranger programs- Both Rock Harbor and Windigo have their own visitor centers where you can learn a lot about the island and about both its natural and maritime history. Short ranger programs are also offered throughout the year. Their schedules are posted in these centers daily, so be sure to check it out to see if there’s one going on during your visit.\n\nTake a sightseeing tour- These guided tours are only offered on the Rock Harbor side of the island through the Rock Harbor Lodge. Those taking the ferry won’t be able to take advantage of these because of the timing, but those taking the earliest 8 am seaplane from Houghton might be able to snag a spot on a morning 9 am tour. Spots on these tours cannot be reserved in advance and you have to sign up for them only once you’re on the island, so you might be cutting it very close here and spaces may be filled for the day by the time you arrive, but it’s worth a shot! Of course, if you are using a private boat to get to Isle Royale, you can get here earlier in the morning to sign up for a spot.\n\nCheck out the Rock Harbor Lodge site to see which tours are available each day.\n\nUse the Rock Harbor water taxi to sightsee- If you can’t get on a tour, then the Rock Harbor Lodge also offers a water taxi service to get you to areas near Rock Harbor! And the good thing about this taxi is, unlike the tours, spaces on here can be reserved in advance through the lodge.\n\nIf you only have a short amount of time on the island, we would recommend taking the taxi to the Hidden Lake Dock, and from here, you can do a short day hike up to Lookout Louise.\n\nAnother option would be to take the taxi to Three Mile Dock and take the short hike up to Mount Franklin, which gives a gorgeous view from the Greenstone Ridge Trail.\n\nThe cost of the one-way trip to Hidden Lake or Three Mile is:\n\nOne Person: $38.00\n\nTwo People: $57.00\n\nThree People: $61.00\n\nFour People: $65.00\n\nFive People: $69.00\n\nSix People: $73.00\n\nAnother option on an Isle Royale day trip is to take the taxi to Daisy Farm to do a shorter day hike up to Ojibway Tower. Or, take it to Passage Island or the Rock Harbor Lighthouse to go on short walks to see historic lighthouses.\n\nThe cost of a one way trip to either of these places is:\n\nOne Person: $114.00\n\nTwo People: $116.00\n\nThree People: $125.00\n\nFour People: $134.00\n\nFive People: $143.00\n\nSix People: $152.00\n\nWhile it’s a bit more of an expensive option, utilizing the water taxi is a great way to get the most out of your one day in Isle Royale National Park.\n\nRelax! One of the best things you can do on an isolated island filled with solitude and nature is to simply relax! Stroll along the shore of Lake Superior, find a hidden nook, and just enjoy the sounds of the water lapping against the shore as you try to spot eagles flying overhead. Or hang out in Washington Creek over in Windigo and watch for otters playing in the water or moose feeding by the shore.\n\nIsle Royale is such a peaceful place, and we left really feeling like we got the reset we needed away from the hustle and bustle of daily life. So if this is your goal, then a day trip to Isle Royale won’t disappoint!\n\nREAD MORE: We have a more complete guide on all the best things to do in Isle Royale National Park, so make sure to check that out for more information as you plan your trip!\n\nKeeping these things to do in mind, let’s get into some possible one day Isle Royale itineraries to help you plan out your time on the island!\n\nIsle Royale one day itinerary: Rock Harbor\n\nDepending on how you choose to get to Rock Harbor, you’ll have either 3 hours (from Copper Harbor), 4 hours (using the seaplane from Grand Marais) or up to 8 hours (using the seaplane from Houghton). We’ll show you examples of how to plan your one day in Isle Royale with each of these time frames.\n\nThree to four hours in Rock Harbor\n\nThree hours is not a lot of time. You won’t be able to hop on a tour or take advantage of the water taxi, but you can still pick from one of the following activities to get a taste of life in Isle Royale:\n\nHike either the Scoville Point Loop or out to Suzy’s Cave. Both are roughly four miles and are relatively flat hikes so can be completed in about two hours or so (so you won’t have much time to linger or relax!). The Scoville Point hike was one of our favorite hikes on the island. It runs along the Lake Superior shoreline out to a rocky outcrop overlooking the lake and harbor, and there are good chances of spotting wildlife. If we had to choose between the two, this is the one we would pick. The hike to Suzy’s Cave is still a good option, though. It runs the other way along Lake Superior, and then cuts briefly inland to get to an old sea arch that was formed back when the lake levels were much higher.\n\nRent a kayak or canoe and paddle through Tobin Harbor for a few hours.\n\nWith any additional time at the end of the hike or paddle, check out the visitor center to learn more about the park and see exhibits. Or grab lunch at the Rock Harbor Lodge restaurant and simply relax on the Lake Superior shore.\n\nEight hours in Rock Harbor\n\nWith a full day in Isle Royale, there are a few ways you can spend your time based on your interests.\n\nIsle Royale itinerary for hikers\n\nIf you’re looking to spend your one day in Isle Royale on the trails, then there are a few good options that will take up most of your day. We would recommend choosing between the following:\n\nMount Franklin: This is a 10 mile round trip hike out of Rock Harbor that will take you up to a high point along the Greenstone Ridge Trail that runs across the island. From here, you get amazing views over the island, lake, and out to Canada on a clear day. We hiked the entire Greenstone Ridge Trail and can say that the views from Mount Franklin were our favorite from the entire hike.\n\nLookout Louise to Mount Franklin: If you want a loop trail with multiple viewpoints, this nearly 10.5 mile hike is a great option. You can catch the water taxi to Hidden Lake, hike to Lookout Louise for an amazing viewpoint, then continue hiking along the Greenstone Ridge to Mount Franklin. From there, you can hike off the ridge and back to Rock Harbor.\n\nMount Ojibway: Take the water taxi to Daisy Farm and climb up to the ridge to get views from the Ojibway Fire Tower. This hike is only 3.5 miles roundtrip from Daisy Farm, but to make it longer, you can take a one-way ride to Daisy Farm and then hike back to Rock Harbor via Mount Ojibway for a full day 11 mile hike.\n\nWith any spare time after your hike, we recommend checking out the visitor center to learn more about the park, and relaxing and grabbing some food at the Rock Harbor restaurant. Or, if you still want to hike and maybe spot some more wildlife, take a gander down the Stoll Memorial Loop Trail. This is an easy and flat 1.8 mile loop through the forest and along Lake Superior, but you can go as far as you’d like. It can also be good for spotting wildlife. We saw tons of moose prints and droppings along the trail, but sadly no actual moose, but you may get lucky!\n\nIsle Royale itinerary for sightseers\n\nWith a longer time in Isle Royale, you can take advantage of some of the tours and the water taxi. If you get there in time and you are able to, we suggest joining a morning tour. Depending on the day, you can choose between going on a guided hike from Hidden Lake up to Lookout Louise, to Passage Island to hike and see a lighthouse, or to the Rock Harbor Lighthouse to see the lighthouse as well as an historic commercial fishery.\n\nIf you can’t catch a tour, take a water taxi that will allow you to basically go to any of the places a tour would go to. You can catch a ride to Hidden Lake to hike out and back to Lookout Louise, or you could visit one of the lighthouses.\n\nIn the afternoon, we would recommend either hiking the Scoville Point Trail or paddling for a few hours in the harbor. After, we recommend checking out the visitor center, grabbing a bite to eat at the restaurant, and just relaxing by Lake Superior!\n\nIsle Royale one day itinerary: Windigo\n\nAgain, depending on whether you take a ferry or seaplane for your Isle Royale day trip, you’ll have roughly 3-4 hours to spend on the island, or up to 8 hours.\n\nHere are some examples of Isle Royale one day itineraries for Windigo.\n\nThree to four hours in Windigo\n\nWith a short time in Windigo, we think the best hike you can do is the Grace Creek Overlook trail. This hike takes you along the quiet shoreline of Lake Superior before turning inland to hike to a ridgeline viewpoint over the island and Lake Superior. It’s about 3.6 miles but pretty easy so should only take about 2 hours, but we would recommend a more leisurely pace to enjoy the sights.\n\nIf you don’t want to hike, another option would be to rent canoes or kayaks for a few hours and paddle either out to Beaver Island across the harbor, or paddle up Washington Creek to search for otters, moose, and loons.\n\nWith extra time at the end of the hike or paddle, check out the Moose Exclosure, which is located at the end of the Windigo Nature Trail. This is a unique place on the island that has been blocked off from moose, and really showcases the effect that the moose population has had on the island!\n\nWith any extra time, check out the exhibits at the visitor center, and just relax by Washington Harbor, watching the seaplanes come and go.\n\nEight hours in Windigo\n\nWith a longer day in Isle Royale, you can opt for a longer day hike. We would recommend the 9.4 mile Huginnin Loop Trail which will take you to a secluded cove along Lake Superior, but you can also hike the more rugged and challenging Minong Ridge Trail to the Minong Ridge Overlook, which would be a 6 mile round trip hike.\n\nIn the afternoon, go for a paddle in the harbor, or hang out by Washington Creek for a bit to try to spot moose wading in the river or otters swimming upstream. Check out the visitor center exhibits, and walk along the Windigo Nature Trail, making sure to stop at the Moose Exclosure.\n\nIs it better to visit Rock Harbor or Windigo on a day trip to Isle Royale?\n\nIf we had to choose the best place to visit for an Isle Royale day trip, I think we would pick Rock Harbor. Both places offer great hikes and give a taste of the Isle Royale wilderness and solitude (and actually, maybe even moreso in Windigo because of the fewer services and facilities), but Rock Harbor has a bit more to do to help you experience more of the island with a limited time. Especially if you have a more full day on the island because you took the seaplane or have a private boat, you can take advantage of tours and the water taxi that will bring you to different sights and experiences around the park. With that said, if you can only make it to Windigo, still do it! The sights and solitude of the Windigo wilderness will not disappoint.\n\nThe Best Time to Take a Day Trip to Isle Royale National Park\n\nIsle Royale National Park is only open from April 16th to October 31st every year, and as you can see above, most public transportation typically runs only from mid- May through September.\n\nJuly and August are peak season to visit Isle Royale, but since you won’t have to be fighting for accommodation or campgrounds, it’s not that big of a deal to visit at this time on an Isle Royale day trip. You might see a bit more people on the trails and at the boat docks, and you might have to reserve all transportation, including the water taxi, a bit more in advance.\n\nWe went in the spring (early June) and loved it for the quiet and solitude. However, this time of year brings lots of bugs, mud, trail blowdown, and variable weather. We think fall might be a better time to visit Isle Royale because while the weather might still be a bit more variable and cooler, there will be less people, bugs and trail obstacles.\n\nREAD MORE: Be sure to check out our complete Isle Royale National Park guide for more on when to come, what to pack, and more.\n\nMore Information for Your Trip to Isle Royale National Park\n\nIf you’re planning a day trip to Isle Royale National Park, these guides might be helpful:\n\nISLE ROYALE DAY HIKES: Our complete guide to day hiking in Isle Royale goes over all our favorite hikes on the island in both Windigo and Rock Harbor.\n\nSCOVILLE POINT LOOP TRAIL: The Scoville Point Loop was our favorite hike in Rock Harbor!
