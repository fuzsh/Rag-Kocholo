        "text": "As Isle Royale grows larger from the deck of the boat, so too does the excitement. Travelers gather their packs and lace up their hiking boots in anticipation. They're headed to Isle Royale National Park, off the coast of Michigan's Upper Peninsula in the heart of Lake Superior. This isn't a park for the adventure-averse: Isle Royale is one of the least-visited national parks in the U.S. and one of the country's last bastions of remote wilderness. Ferries, running from both Michigan and Minnesota, take hours to reach the main island. Once you arrive, be ready to rough it.\n\nUpon your arrival, a park ranger lays out the rules, hazards and expectations in the park. After getting a backcountry permit, it's time to head out. Nervous energy builds as you head toward the trail. With every step, the noise and nonsense that define life on the mainland drift further away. (Cell service is rare.) Some times of year, it's possible to spend all day on an interior trail surrounded by fir, spruce, and ash forest and not see another human being. And when you finally reach camp and sling your backpack off your tired shoulders, you know you'll sleep well.\n\nHere's everything you need to know to plan a trip to Isle Royale National Park.\n\nPlan Your Visit\n\nIsle Royale isn't a spur-of-the-moment park; a trip here requires meticulous preparation and planning. The only way to arrive is by boat or seaplane. Transportation often sells out, so book as early as possible. Likewise, accommodations within the park—the Rock Harbor Lodge and Windigo Camper Cabins—fill early. If you plan to backpack and camp, you will need a rough idea of your route to obtain a backcountry camping permit. And make sure to adhere to park rules: No open fires without a metal fire ring. No collecting souvenirs, like flowers or antlers. Pack out all your waste. (And they mean all your waste.) If you encounter a moose on the trail, give it a wide berth.\n\nWhat to Pack\n\nIf you're not staying at Rock Harbor Lodge, plan to bring everything you might need, including food, a camp stove and a good water filter. (Potable water is only available in Rock Harbor and Windigo.) Forgot something on the mainland? Cross your fingers that the small store next to the ferry dock has what you need. Due to extremely spotty cell service, an emergency SOS beacon, like the Garmin inReach, is also key. And bring good hiking boots for rugged, rocky trails.\n\nHow to Get There\n\nFerries run seasonally from Copper Harbor (the primary gateway) and Houghton in Michigan, as well as Grand Portage, Minnesota (along the North Shore). But you'll have to get there first. United has daily flights into Houghton County Memorial Airport on the Upper Peninsula. For those flying into Minnesota, Duluth International Airport is the best bet. There are no roads to or on Isle Royale, so you'll park your car at one of the ferry lots for a small daily fee. Find the ferries and schedule links here. Expect to spend three to six hours crossing Lake Superior.\n\nFor a speedier (and spendier) option, you can take a seaplane to the island from Hubbell, Michigan or Grand Marais, Minnesota. Isle Royale Seaplanes is the only concessionaire, and prices start at $350 for a round-trip ticket.\n\nGreat Hikes\n\nIsle Royale really is best explored via hikes. The rugged terrain makes it more suited to experienced hikers and most trails leading into the interior of the 206 square miles of the park are meant to help backpackers get from one campground to another. However, there are some shorter options easily accessible from Rock Harbor Lodge.\n\nRock Harbor to Daisy Farm Campground\n\nThis trail almost entirely follows the coast for 7 miles, with a soundtrack of lapping waves, trilling loons and the occasional outboard motor. The trail undulates a bit over rocky rises and occasionally detours into the woods, but experienced hikers shouldn't have any problems. From Daisy Farm, you can do a 1.7-mile hike to Mt. Ojibway Observation Tower for a 360-degree view of the island.\n\nStoll Trail to Scoville Point\n\nPerhaps the most popular hike for lodge guests, a 4-mile round-trip trail to the tip of the island winds through forest and coastline, past bluffs and cliffs.\n\nRyan Island\n\nOne of the park's weirder claims to fame is that it's home to the largest island (Ryan Island) in the largest lake (Siskiwit Lake) on the largest island (Isle Royale) in the largest freshwater lake (Lake Superior) in the world. Getting to Ryan Island takes a lot of advance planning and skill—which means you shouldn't undertake this adventure without the necessary experience. The route requires paddling several lakes and crossing multiple portages, sometimes carrying your boat as far as 2 miles across difficult terrain. (Most folks who attempt this use a lightweight inflatable pack raft.) But for those prepared, the interior lakes are incredibly beautiful and worth the effort. (For a less harrowing adventure, rent a kayak from Rock Harbor Lodge and paddle to the Lookout Louise Trail, which takes hikers about a mile up to a scenic viewpoint.)\n\nWhat to See and Do\n\nIf you're not big on hiking, there are other ways to experience the island.\n\nKayak the Lake(s)\n\nAfter hiking, kayaking is probably Isle Royale's most popular activity. Rent one at Rock Harbor Lodge or bring your own on the ferry for a fee. While paddling on Lake Superior should only be done by experienced kayakers (or with a guide), there are several inland lakes and waterways that are more manageable.\n\nTake a Boat Cruise\n\nAn easier way to see the national park by water is from the relative comfort of a boat tour. Cruises sail six times a week from Rock Harbor on different routes to smaller islands and sights not accessible from the mainland (like Raspberry Island and Passage Island Lighthouse). You can find the schedule and destinations here.\n\nGo Fishing\n\nThe amount and variety of fish in Lake Superior boggles the mind. Catch trout, salmon, walleye, pike and more. (Be sure to buy a Michigan fishing license beforehand!)\n\nLook for Wildlife\n\nIsle Royale is known for having moose and wolves. Moose frequently appear on the trails—they can be quite surly, so keep your distance—but it's still a thrill to spot one. It's rare to see their main predator though; wolves tend to hunt at night and shy away from humans. And don't forget your binoculars: You'll find dozens of bird species nesting in trees or swimming in Lake Superior.\n\nWhere to Stay\n\nHotels\n\nLodging options are limited and only open from June to September, typically. On the northeast end of the island, Rock Harbor Lodge has 60 rooms, each accommodating up to four people, all with Lake Superior views. An additional 20 Housekeeping Cottages, sleeping up to six, are available at the lodge. Two Windigo Camper Cabins on the southwest end are primitive: neither have indoor plumbing, and amenities like bed linens and cookware aren't provided. (Though they can be rented at the Windigo camp store.) These cabins usually book up very early. All reservations can be made via Rock Harbor Lodge.\n\nCampsites\n\nMost visitors camp in one of 36 campgrounds across the island. Some campgrounds have wooden shelters—basically tiny cabins with a screen door and no furniture. These shelters can't be reserved and are highly sought after. Bring a tent, just in case.\n\nExplore Further\n\nAdd a few days to your trip for exploring on your way to or from the ferry ports.\n\nRide Singletrack\n\nIf you enjoy mountain biking, Copper Harbor, Michigan, is a huge destination for bikers. The surrounding area offers tons of singletrack routes, as well as guided rides via Keweenaw Adventure Company. If you're coming from Minnesota, Duluth has several award-winning trails that are awesome as well.\n\nExplore Lighthouses and Waterfalls\n\nSlow down and enjoy the scenic drives in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Visitors can find eight different lighthouses along the UP's Keweenaw Peninsula shoreline, as well as several waterfalls within a short drive. You should be able to pick up a brochure with locations at any visitors center.\n\nVisit Grand Portage\n\nThose taking the ferry from Grand Portage shouldn't miss Grand Portage State Park. Situated on the United States-Canada border, the park has the state's highest waterfall. Nearby, Grand Portage National Monument preserves a historical center of fur trade activity and Anishinaabeg Ojibwe heritage. It's also the first National Park Service unit to be co-managed with a Tribal Nation (the Grand Portage Band of Lake Superior Chippewa).\n\nWhere To Eat in Copper Harbor\n\nSince options in the park are limited, be sure to enjoy a solid meal and stock up on groceries before boarding the ferry in Copper Harbor. (Once on the island, you'll be grateful for Greenstone Grill's basic all-day fare—and Keweenaw Brewing Company beer.)\n\nHarbor Haus\n\nThe primary fine-dining option in Copper Harbor, Harbor Haus serves traditional Bavarian specialties as well as classic American fare. Dessert choices (like warm bread pudding with maple ice cream) are as tasty as the view of Lake Superior from the dining room and deck. For years, the staff has performed a dance on the restaurant's dock welcoming back the Queen IV ferry from Isle Royale. Make a reservation for dinner—waits can be long during the high summer season.\n\nThe Mariner North\n\nLow-key, unassuming and friendly , this is the quintessential Michigan UP restaurant. Order a steak, and you'll know why this is a favorite for locals.\n\nJamsen's\n\nThis waterfront bakery (right near the ferry dock) is the best spot to grab a coffee and a turnover stuffed with fresh Keweenaw berries before heading to the island.\n\nGroceries\n\nYou can find a lot of basics at The Gas Lite General Store in Copper Harbor, but the closest real supermarket is in Calumet, about 45 minutes away.\n\nWhere to Eat Near Grand Portage\n\nYou won't find many dining options in Grand Portage, but here are the best ones in town or en route:\n\nIsland View Dining Room\n\nLocated in the Grand Portage Lodge and Casino (a 5-minute drive from the ferry dock), this is a good option for one last hearty meal before leaving the mainland.\n\nThe Fisherman's Daughter\n\nMake a pit stop in Grand Marais on your way to Grand Portage for freshly caught seafood. The restaurant is known for its fish and chips, but you can also buy smoked fish by the pound.\n\nGroceries\n\nWhen leaving from Grand Portage, Grand Marais will be your best bet for groceries, about 35 miles away."
