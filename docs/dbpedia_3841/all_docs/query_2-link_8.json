        "text": "Lake Superior\n\nThe iron that built a nation was mined around and shipped across Lake Superior.\n\nEarly voyager traders overcame obstacles like the St. Marys Falls by hauling tons of beaver pelts around the falls. Such barriers limited the amount of natural resources that could be moved and brought to commercial centers. Engineers later built canals that permitted large boats to transport thousands of tons of resources to market.\n\nMinerals like copper and iron ore were essential ingredients in the formation of a modern industrial economy. Their widespread availability in the Lake Superior region and their cost effective transportation to urban centers encouraged businessmen to risk everything in hopes of financial success. Many did, many failed, but some, like Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan harnessed these mineral resources to create the greatest economy in world history.\n\nLake Superior, the largest and northernmost of the Great Lakes, is full of fascinating facts and features. Here are some cool facts about Lake Superior:\n\nLargest Freshwater Lake by Surface Area: Lake Superior is the largest freshwater lake in the world by surface area, covering approximately 31,700 square miles (82,100 square kilometers).\n\nMassive Volume: It holds about 2,900 cubic miles (12,100 cubic kilometers) of water, making it the third largest by volume after Lake Baikal and Lake Tanganyika.\n\nGreat Depth: The lake has an average depth of 483 feet (147 meters) and a maximum depth of 1,333 feet (406 meters), making it the deepest of the Great Lakes.\n\nCold Waters: Lake Superior’s waters are notoriously cold, with an average annual temperature of 40°F (4.4°C). Even in summer, surface temperatures rarely exceed 55°F (13°C).\n\nRocky Shorelines and Clear Water: The lake is known for its rocky shorelines and exceptionally clear water, with visibility often reaching over 20 feet (6 meters) and sometimes as much as 100 feet (30 meters) in certain areas.\n\nIsle Royale National Park: Located in the middle of Lake Superior, Isle Royale is a remote island national park known for its wilderness, moose, and wolf populations. It is one of the least visited national parks due to its remote location and challenging access.\n\nNumerous Shipwrecks: The lake has claimed many ships over the years, earning it the nickname “Graveyard of the Great Lakes.” The most famous shipwreck is the SS Edmund Fitzgerald, which sank in 1975.\n\n4th Largest Lake Island: Lake Superior contains several islands. The 4th largest is Isle Royale, which itself has inland lakes.\n\nHistorical Significance: The lake has been significant in the history of the Native American tribes, particularly the Ojibwe people, who have lived in the region for centuries. It was also an essential part of the fur trade route used by European explorers and traders.\n\nWater Flow: Lake Superior’s water flows out through the St. Marys River into Lake Huron. It takes about 191 years for water to completely replace itself in the lake, the longest retention time of the Great Lakes.\n\nPictured Rocks National Lakeshore: Located on the southern shore of Lake Superior in Michigan, this national lakeshore is known for its stunning multicolored sandstone cliffs, sea caves, and waterfalls.\n\nThunder Bay: The lake is home to Thunder Bay, one of the largest cities on its shores, located in Ontario, Canada. Thunder Bay is known for its vibrant cultural scene and access to outdoor activities.\n\nApostle Islands: Located off the coast of Wisconsin, the Apostle Islands are a group of 22 islands known for their natural beauty, sea caves, and historic lighthouses. They are part of the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore.\n\nLongest Freshwater Sand Dunes: The lake is bordered by some of the longest freshwater sand dunes in the world, particularly in the Grand Sable Dunes area of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula.\n\nExtensive Ice Cover: Lake Superior can develop extensive ice cover in the winter, with some years seeing over 90% of the lake frozen. However, it rarely freezes completely due to its vast size and depth.\n\nEnvironmental Stewardship: Efforts to protect and preserve Lake Superior’s natural environment are robust, involving international cooperation between the United States and Canada. The lake is part of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement aimed at reducing pollution and protecting water quality.\n\nThese facts highlight the unique and awe-inspiring characteristics of Lake Superior, making it one of the most remarkable natural features in North America.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nNative Fish: Lake whitefish, yellow perch, cisco or lake herring, kiyi, spawning grounds for brook trout, walleye, and lake sturgeon\n\nMammals: Moose, woodland caribou, black bear, and gray wolves\n\nBirds: Terns and plovers\n\nForests: Spruce, fir, pine, and paper birch\n\nDimensions: 350 miles long x 160 miles wide\n\nDepth: Average 483 feet; max 1,332 feet\n\nSurface Area: 31,700 sq miles, approx. the size of South Carolina\n\nVolume: 2,900 cubic miles\n\nElevation: 600 feet above sea level\n\nShoreline Length: 2,726 miles, including islands\n\nOutlet: St. Mary’s River to Lake Huron\n\nRetention/Replacement Time: 191 yrs\n\nPopulation: 444,000 Us/ 229,000 Canada\n\nSeveral museums near Lake Superior offer insights into the region’s rich history, culture, and natural environment.
