        "text": "The rocks of the Isle Royale archipelago (group of islands) are more than 1 billion years old. The Greenstone Ridge, a high ridge that forms the backbone of the island, was formed by one of Earth’s oldest, largest, and longest-lasting lava flow events. This event occurred about a billion years ago. Today the island measures about 45 miles (72 kilometers) long and 9 miles (14 kilometers) across and holds many lakes and streams. Chlorastrolite, the Michigan state gem, is a very rare stone found only on Isle Royale and the northern tip of the Upper Peninsula.\n\nIsle Royale is in a transition zone between two biomes: the temperate forest and the taiga. Plant and animal life are typical of both the taiga and temperate forests. Trees include various species (or kinds) of maple, birch, pine, ash, and spruce. Lichens, mosses, flowering plants, shrubs, and ferns can be found in the various habitats around the island.\n\nThe waters surrounding Isle Royale support one of the only populations of coaster brook trout in the world. Clam populations thrive in some of the lakes on the island, and the wetlands are the ideal habitat for many species of amphibians. Spring peepers are the most abundant frog on the island. Salamanders and newts are present but rarely seen. There are only three species of reptiles in the park: the western painted turtle, the northern red-bellied snake, and the common garter snake. Birds that live on the island either temporarily or permanently include the belted kingfisher, scarlet tanager, and about 80 other species. Mammals on Isle Royale include river otters, beavers, foxes, wolves, and moose. The gray wolf arrived on Isle Royale in 1948 when an ice bridge formed between the island and Canada. For more than 50 years, the moose-wolf relationship on Isle Royale has been studied, making it the longest predator-prey study in the world.\n\nIsle Royale was visited by Native Americans as long as 4,500 years ago. They mined and worked with the copper they found there. Stone tools, pottery, ceramics, and arrow points have been found on the island. The artifacts found on Isle Royale suggest that groups from the entire Lake Superior basin traveled to the island. The first European to visit was probably the French explorer Étienne Brûlé in 1622. The island’s first known name was Minong (Ojibwa for “Good High Place”). French missionaries changed it to Isle Royale to honor their royal patrons. Commercial copper mining and commercial fishing began in the 1800s. The island had become a popular resort area by the beginning of the 1900s. It was designated a national park in 1931 and a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1980."
