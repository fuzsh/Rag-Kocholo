        "text": "In partnership with Isle Royale National Park, the Institute offers education and collaborative research to teachers, students, and researchers. We focus on science and education in the remote northwestern Lake Superior archipelago waters, designated a national park in 1931, and an international biosphere in 1980.\n\nIsle Royale and surrounding waters are a living lab.\n\nThe wilderness is home to long-running research on wolf-moose ecology, boreal chorus frogs, nutrient cycling, and climate change. It is rich with artifacts—prehistoric mining, commercial fishing, the resort industry, and shipping.\n\nA Natural Fit\n\nThe partnership between Michigan Technological University and Isle Royale National Park, a component of our Ecosystem Science Center, expands lifelong learning and research opportunities. We design, fund, and offer long-term programs and short-term projects. We collaborate with universities, government agencies, and the private sector for research and education that brings people of all ages and backgrounds into this spectacular one-of-a-kind environment.\n\nAbout Isle Royale\n\nThe park, composed of one large island and about 400 smaller, is prized by backpackers, boaters, paddlers, anglers, shipwreck divers, and researchers—but it is the least visited in the national park system's lower 48 states. The only way to get there is by boat or seaplane.\n\nIsle Royale is 45 miles long, and nine miles at its widest point.\n\nLearning for All Ages\n\nMoose watches, fishery trips, and camping—so many things to see and do on the roadless island! Here are some of the programs we've offered for children, adults, families, and educators.\n\nResearch Support\n\nNational park, federal wilderness area, and international biosphere reserve, Isle Royale offers a superlative living laboratory and field site for research in a broad range of disciplines, from the natural sciences to geology, archaeology, and wilderness ethics.\n\nThe archipelago's natural history tells the tale of ancient lava flows and glaciers, extreme climates, human impacts from mining and logging, and the ongoing influence of fluctuating moose populations.\n\nSpruce-fir-birch forests dominate the east end of the main island; northern hardwoods dominate to the west.\n\nBut habitats are diverse, including more than 40 inland lakes, a wide variety of wetlands and forests, and microhabitats within the crevasses and splash pools of exposed rocky shorelines.\n\nIsle Royale is home to fewer animal and plant species than the Canada, Michigan, and Minnesota mainlands closest to it. But it hosts an unusual concentration of rare and protected species, including rare plant and insect species more commonly found in arctic, alpine, and western regions (such as crow berry, butterwort, devil’s club, and the dragonfly Aeshna juncea).\n\nLocated in the transition zone between the northern hardwood and boreal forest, Isle Royale acts as an early indicator of global climate change for the species of these environments farther north in their range.\n\nIn 2008-2009, the Institute helped convene a blue-ribbon panel of academic experts to assess scientific research at Isle Royale National Park.\n\nScientific and popular publications are available from the Isle Royale and Keweenaw Parks Association (IRKPA).\n\nMoosewatch Expeditions"
