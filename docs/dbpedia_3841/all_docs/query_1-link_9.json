        "text": "Lake Superior is home to several islands.\n\nMichigan's Isle Royale, Wisconsin's Madeline Island and Ontario's Michipicoten Island, just to name a few.\n\nBut did you know that early maps of the region included several imaginary islands scattered throughout Lake Superior? Such maps, created by renowned early cartographers such as Jacques Nicolas Bellin, Robert Morden and John Senex, all feature several of the fictitious land masses.\n\nBellin's 1744 map, Carte des Lacs du Canada, is particularly interesting. Isle Royal is there, sure. But places such as Isle Anne and Isle Pontchartrain shown to exist to the east of the national park, have never existed. Nor has Isle Philippeaux to the south or Isle Maurepas to the northeast.\n\nBellin's map also depicts a small chain of islands jetting off of Isle Royale and any geographer will tell you that Islos du Tonnerre, Isle Roch and Islas a la Carpe have never seen one of the Great Lake's famed Gales of November.\n\nThe map also features an elevated plain down the center of the Lower Peninsula. Obviously, there is no such plain. In fact, the center portion of Michigan is commonly known as the flattest part of the state.\n\nBoth fictitious features had been seen before in British maps. Lake Superior had many large islands in Robert Morden's 1698 map and John Senex' similar map of 1719. Even Guillaume de l'isle's map of 1718 showed an elevated plain.\n\nAccording to staff at the Michigan State University Map Library, which is displaying several of the historic maps all week long, Bellin's map of the region was published as the French were enjoying the pinnacle of their influence in the Great Lakes.\n\nAs a highly regarded mapmaker, his work helped shape many people's perceptions of the region. And Bellin's reputation was such that both myths persisted in Great Lakes mapping for many decades afterward.\n\nThe map, despite being partially inaccurate, was a great improvement in Great Lakes mapping, according to MSU.\n\nBy 1832, as you can see on this map based on British Admiralty Charts, all the fictitious islands had been removed."
