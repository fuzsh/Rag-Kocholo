        "text": "Photo by Cory Morse | MLive.com\n\nThere's a reason people write songs about islands. They are magical pieces of land. That's especially true in Michigan, where our many, many islands are surrounded by precious fresh water. Islands in the Great Lakes, that is what these are, Kenny Rogers.\n\nHere are a dozen of our favorite islands for summertime fun. Whether you are looking for an island full of other vacationing Michiganders or you want a slab of land all to yourself, there is something for you on this list. From day trips to extended vacations, for solo trips or family gatherings, these islands offer it all.\n\nWhat Michigan island is your favorite for a warm weather getaway?\n\nPhoto by Mark Tower | MLive.com\n\n1. Mackinac Island\n\nLet's start with the obvious. Mackinac Island is everyone's favorite summer destination. There are adorable shops, horse-drawn carriage tours, scenic beauty, historic landmarks, delicious foods, thirst-quenching cocktails and FUDGE! The whole family loves it and you don't even have to drive. Bonus: You get to ride a ferry to get to Mackinac Island. That means you get to go on an adventure to get to another adventure. Make sure to bring a loved one who is willing to pedal a tandem bicycle with you.\n\nWhere is it?: 5 miles off the coast of St. Ignace (Duh!)\n\n14 things you must eat on Mackinac Island\n\nMackinac Island: 20 nightlife spots you need to visit\n\nCan you find these hidden gems on your next trip to Mackinac Island?\n\nPhoto by Tanya Moutzalias | MLive.com\n\nDon't forget to check out the world's longest porch at the Grand Hotel.\n\nAnd you have to visit Arch Rock.\n\nPhoto by Jim DuFresne | MLive.com\n\n2. Drummond Island\n\nKnown as the \"Gem of the Huron,\" Drummond Island is the easternmost spot in the Upper Peninsula. Only about a mile off mainland U.P., you can take a short ferry ride to get to one of the largest islands in Lake Huron. You'll find beaches, parks, golfing, fishing, shopping and more. Fans of off-roading, cycling, birding and kayaking will all be in paradise here. There are campgrounds, resorts, cabins and hotels, if you are looking to stay for a night or two. Much of the scenic island is owned by the state, but about 1,000 residents call this place their permanent home.\n\nWhere is it?: Just off the eastern coast of mainland U.P. in Lake Huron, bordering the Michigan/Canada dividing line.\n\nDid we mention kayaking?\n\nPhoto by Kim Schneider | MLive.com\n\n3. Beaver Island\n\nIf you are looking for a beautiful dark sky view of the stars, Beaver Island is where you should head this summer. But the large Lake Michigan island is a destination for many other reasons too. Bring a dirt bike to explore the beauty of the island on two tires. Make sure you spend time taking in the magical view at Paradise Bay where you will find one of the two lighthouses on the island. Make full use of the big lake by scuba diving or renting a jet ski. Beaver Island fancies itself one of the more affordable vacations destinations in the region. A ferry shuttles visitors to and from Charlevoix. While you are there, ask the locals about the island's interesting history. (Hint: It involves a king.)\n\nWhere is it?: About 32 miles northwest of Charlevoix in Lake Michigan.\n\nHere's a view of one of Beaver Island's inland lakes, Font Lake, near the northern edge of the island.\n\nPhoto by Cory Morse | MLive.com\n\n4. Isle Royale\n\nWe'll just say it -- Isle Royale isn't for everyone. It takes a while to get there and, once you're there, you really won't get much enjoyment unless you have a love for exploring the wilderness. If you are a fan of hiking through unmarred terrain that is as lovely as you'll likely find, we urge you to take this trip. You will never forget the serene feeling you'll get watching the sunset over Lake Superior from the natural beach at Rainbow Cove. There are 165 miles of trails to explore and more than 30 campgrounds. This a serious backpacker's dream. The ferry ride is 3.5 hours each way to and from Copper Harbor.\n\nWhere is it?: About 60 miles northwest of Copper Harbor in Lake Superior\n\nRelated: Meet all 5 (yes, 5) of Michigan's National Parks\n\nPhoto by Cory Morse | MLive.com\n\nMake sure to add Suzy's Cave to your itinerary.\n\nPhoto by Cory Morse | MLive.com\n\nAnd don't miss Rock Harbor Lighthouse.\n\nPhoto by Cathy Layman | MLive.com\n\n5. Charity Island\n\nThe largest island in the Saginaw Bay, we suggest a boat trip to Charity Island this summer on a day when you really need to get away from it all. The island is perfect for meditating and contemplating the meaning of life. Or you could just have a fun little trip to see the lighthouse and check out the limestone on the shoreline. You can take a dinner cruise to Charity Island or plan an overnight trip at the Charity Island Lodge. Just make sure you don't venture onto the large area of Charity Island that is closed to the public to protect its natural resources.\n\nWhere is it?: About 10 miles from the mainland of Arenac County's Whitney Township\n\nRelated: The charming Michigan island you haven't visited but should\n\nYou can skipper your own boat to Charity Island and check out the scenery.\n\nSay \"hello\" to the Gravelly Shoal Light on the way.\n\nPhoto by Lance Wynn | MLive.com\n\n6. North Manitou Island\n\nBrave the 12-mile ferry ride from Leland (even if it is choppy) to experience the distinct loveliness that is North Manitou Island. It's eight miles long, four miles wide and features 20 miles of shoreline. You'll find 23 miles of trails here to explore. Fans of opportunities for rugged camping will want to pitch a tent here. Bring your hammock along and take a nap next to Lake Michigan, as the beautiful sounds of waves hitting the shore lull you to sleep. Make sure to hike to the inland Lake Manitou, a perfect place to relax and cast a fishing line. The island is populated with zero people these days but lots of animals make their homes here. You'll find beaver, chipmunk, deer, bald eagles and the endangered piping plover.\n\nWhere is it?: About 12 miles from Leland in Lake Michigan\n\nPerhaps you'll discover a Petoskey stone on the beach.\n\nPhoto by Kim Schneider | MLive.com\n\n7. South Manitou Island\n\nDid you expect us to leave out the other member of the Manitou Islands? You also need to visit South Manitou Island, where you can experience the wreck of the Francisco Morazan without even diving into the water. It's the perfect destination for a day trip while you are vacationing in the northwest Lower Peninsula. Check out the South Manitou Lighthouse and sunbath on the beach. Take a hike here to check out inland Florence Lake and maybe discover some huge white cedar trees.\n\nWhere is it?: 16 miles from Leland in Lake Michigan\n\nLike many of these islands, it's a great place to bring your kayak.\n\nDon't forget your hiking shoes.\n\nPhoto by Mark Tower | MLive.com\n\n8. Government Island\n\nSome of the islands included here give you a little getaway from the hustle and bustle of the real world, but if you really, REALLY want to get away from society, Government Island is your summer vacation destination. Also known as Island No. 6 in the Les Cheneaux Islands, this is a completely public island only accessible by the use of a small boat, kayak or canoe. This is a trip only for a self-sufficient person who is willing to map out a route and bring some simple supplies for their stay. There are campsites on the island that are first come, first served, but it wouldn't be strange if you found you were the only person out here. Use the boat launch at the end of South Lakeside Road in Cedarville and navigate around Coryell Island to get here. If you paddle out, you will need a little upper arm strength. Your reward is the ability to paddle out to a gorgeous sunset and then enjoy your solitude on the island. When you are ready to return to civilization, check out the little community of Cedarville.\n\nWhere is it?: The Les Cheneaux Islands are south of Cedarville in Lake Huron\n\nWhile paddling around the Les Cheneaux Islands, just make sure not to head onto private property. Many of the islands are partly or wholly owned by private owners.\n\nPhoto by Matt Weigand | MLive.com\n\n9. Belle Isle\n\nYou can spend a whole day exploring this nearly 1,000-acre island park. There's an aquarium, an amazing fountain and the only marble lighthouse in the U.S. on Belle Isle. The Anna Scripps Whitcomb Conservatory is a must-see destination. It's the oldest continually running conservatory in the country and is home to exotic and rare plants you'll want to see up close. The only way to end your day at Belle Isle is to head to Sunset Point to enjoy a beautiful sunset falling over the Detroit skyline. Oh, and we almost forgot, there's a beach! And a golf course! For attraction hours and more info, check out the Belle Isle Conservancy's website.\n\nWhere is it?: You'll find the bridge to Belle Isle at the intersection of Jefferson Avenue and East Grand Boulevard.\n\nThere is that view we mentioned.\n\nPhoto by Tanya Moutzalias | MLive.com\n\nYou'll find some lovely daffodils here too.\n\nPhoto by Jim DuFresne | MLive.com\n\n10. Grand Island\n\nJust off the coast of Munising, Grand Island is part of the Hiawatha National Forest. Less than 10,000 people visit each year to enjoy kayaking, hiking and camping. This is a destination for mountain bikers, who enjoy hitting the more than 20 miles of trail around the island. You can even rent a bike, if you don't have your own. The ferry that shuttles visitors here runs from the Friday before Memorial Day through early October. You can also just paddle out to the island. You will pay a $2 Hiawatha National Forest fee, but it is a small price to pay for these sandy beaches, deep woods and sandstone cliffs on Lake Superior.\n\nWhere is it?: Right off the coast of Munising in Lake Superior\n\nRelated: Ship looking for Great Lakes pirates to set sail this summer\n\n11. Bois Blanc Island\n\nNear Mackinac Island, you'll find a larger, less-busy patch of land where you can explore a quaint community. Simple living is the way on Bois Blanc Island, where you'll find the essentials -- a general store, a small school for the children of year-round residents and a little airport. If work or normal life is stressing you out, this is a great place to relax. Just bring your camera and a fishing pole to enjoy some time away from the pressures of the real world. From May through November, you can take a ferry in and explore for the day or rent a room on the island.\n\nWhere is it?: About 7 miles from Cheboygan in Lake Huron\n\n12. Harsens Island\n\nLocated on the largest freshwater delta in North America, Harsens Island is almost as far east as you can go without leaving Michigan. On the north side of Lake St. Clair, this island is full of diverse wildlife. The sapphire water here is perfect for kayaking and the recently popular sport of paddleboarding. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources manages much of the island, while other property is owned privately. This is a popular summer destination and you'll see residents and visitors taking advantage of the water and wilderness by boating, birdwatching and partaking in various outdoor activities.\n\nWhere is it?: Clay Township, south of Algonac\n\nHarsens Island is part of the St. Clair Flats.\n\nYou might also enjoy ...\n\nA Michigan city to visit for each holiday\n\nThe most unusual place in each of Michigan's 83 counties"
