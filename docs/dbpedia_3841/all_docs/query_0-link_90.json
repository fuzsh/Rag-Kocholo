        "text": "For some, the magic of Isle Royale doesn't necessarily reside in the boat trip to the island.\n\nTwo days before Rebecca Williams and I left on our reporting trip, a friend and I were having lunch together.\n\n\"You're not riding on the 'Barf Barge' are you?!\"\n\n\"The boat from Copper Harbor?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I took that trip. We were on Isle Royale for a week. The first half of the week, all we could talk about was the boat trip over. And the second half of the week, all we could talk about was the boat trip back!\"\n\nOn her trip, as the ship pulled out of Copper Harbor, the captain came on the loudspeaker.\n\n\"O.k., folks,\" the captain started. \"We have the forecast for our crossing. And I just want to say... we're all in this together. We can get through this.\"\n\nThe snack bar was not open on that crossing.\n\nBut the snack bar was open for our trip.\n\nThe seas got a little rough (I saw a few eight footers roll by). And a trip to the restroom wasn't a straight walk to the door. You had to ping-pong yourself from table, to wall, to other passenger (excuse me), to the door.\n\nEmergency cups and plastic grocery bags were deployed by some, but their \"green-around-the-gills\" condition didn't spread throughout the cabin.\n\nThe owners of the Isle Royale Line from Copper Harbor tell me the round-bottomed \"Barf Barge\" was retired in 2004. Their new boat, the Isle Royale Queen IV, rolls a lot less in heavy seas, and the new boat cut an hour off the trip.\n\nWhat once took around four hours, now takes around three.\n\nTo get a sense of the crossing, I mounted a time lapse camera near the bridge. So here's the 54 mile crossing in less than two minutes.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zanClqRYj20\n\nCell phones don't work on the island. Senses that can be overwhelmed by a connected, electric lifestyle are freed to look up, and take in the wind, waves, rock, and soil.\n\nWhat makes the Isle Royale so special? We asked the Isle Royale Line's retired Captain Donald Kilpela that question:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnpM-rHqzBQ&feature=relmfu\n\nKilpela first made the trip to Isle Royale in 1945. And he and his family have been running the ferry service in Copper Harbor since 1971. His sons Ben and Don Jr. now run the boat. The family has been crossing Lake Superior to Isle Royale every summer since they started the business.\n\nTwo other people who know the island well have spent a good part of their lives here.\n\nRolf Peterson has been studying the interactions of wolves and moose on Isle Royale for more than 40 years. He and his wife Candy spend around eight months of each year on the island, and they raised their two kids on Isle Royale while living in the tiny Bangsund Cabin.\n\nIsle Royale became a National Park in 1940, and was designated as a wilderness area in 1976. Humans are not in control here. It's an ideal laboratory for Peterson and the other researchers studying wolves and moose here.\n\nMuch of what scientists around the globe know about wolves and their behavior comes from Michigan's Isle Royale. The research project here is the longest running continuous study of any predator-prey system in the world.\n\nAll this week, we'll bring you stories about this research and about the people who make it happen - online and on-air.\n\nYou can find all the stories we produce on our series page Lessons from Isle Royale's Wolves and Moose.\n\nIsle Royale is the least visited National Park, but as Captain Kilpela pointed out, it's the most re-visited one.\n\nMany of you have had your own personal experiences with the island. We invite you to share your experiences about Isle Royale in the comment section below. In six words or less - tell us - what's so special about Isle Royale?"
