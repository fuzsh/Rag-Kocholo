        "text": "– The denouement of a 14-year drama produced by Ridley Scott with nary a “Good Year”* for his neighbors. –\n\n– “This gentleman harasses us; we’re a blot on his postcard (of Provence), laments Rose. –\n\nClassy Petit Chalet: located outside of Bonniuex. Modern decor, smartly decorated. 1 br., 1 bath. Can sleep 2 to 5. Contemporary kitchen and bath. TV. Internet. AC. Peaceful. Hosted by Rose and Christophe Orset.\n\nPlease use website for photos and contact for availability. Merci.\n\nThe Proem\n\nI was born into the industry (Hollywood), and thus free not to love it.\n\n“Movies are an authoritarian medium. They vulnerabilize you, and then dominate you,” reasoned the writer David Foster Wallace.\n\nYou find yourself sitting in front of the screen for a couple of hours, in the hands of a director, who may or may not be trusted.\n\nThese latent sentiments reasserted themselves as I browsed press accounts of the daily upheavals of a couple in the Luberon, who were cast in roles they refused to play. The narrative threatened their means of subsistence.\n\nThe mis-en-scène: Oppede, a peaceful village on the northern slope of the Petit Luberon bordering Ménerbes. In 2004, the couple, Rose and Christophe, purchased a one-hectare plot of land that Rose could use for organic poultry farming to augment the family income for their children.\n\nThe metteur-en-scène of the drama: Ridley Scott, their neighbor, a wealthy mega producer and master director, who acquired a former military hospital in the early 1990s. Mr. Scott owns a vineyard that bottles his wine under the label Mas des Infermières. The house grounds and the vineyard are manicured, magnificently.\n\nAt the end of 2009 and in 2010, a wave of lively press reports profiled the drama. Here are passages from three sources, the links of which can be found at the end of this article.\n\nPress Clips\n\nLe Dauphine – 1/21/2010\n\nIn Oppède, in the Vaucluse, Ridley Scott can’t stand Rose’s chickens. The illustrious director of “Gladiator” crosses swords with poultry, multiplies complaints and procedures. But justice, until now, has not ruled in his favor…”This gentleman is harassing us, we’re a blot on his postcard”, she explains (Rose), listing the worries that overwhelm her. It all started with a scathing letter from the “British,” sent by special carrier: “I love the Luberon. What you are doing is disfiguring it. You do not respect the beauty of these places.”\n\nLa Provence: 11/21/2009\n\nScott – who lives two weeks a year in the Vaucluse – brings in a battery of bailiffs and straw men to observe and demand the dismantling of what he considers to be blemishes in his landscape: greenhouses, gates, trenches, shrub hedges, sheds, moveable buildings. Even the children’s playhouse made of pallets and a shed on the neighbor’s land are listed!\n\nLe Journal de Dimanche (JDD): 12/20/2009:\n\nA new emissary a few months later: Julie Payne, a second-tier American actress, accompanied by a translator. “Mr. Scott,” she explains, “finds that the trees you planted to screen the greenhouses are not growing fast enough.” The filmmaker offers to finance a 4 m hedge. Rose blurts out: “Such a shadow over our greenhouses would be the death of our gardens!” The actress returned with another demand: “And a check for 70,000 euros to settle you elsewhere?” Seated in their little house, where we slalom between buckets filled with fresh eggs, the Orset couple still have not digested this humiliation. “I work sixteen hours a day,” says Rose. “I’ve already loaded two cars, and I’m so tired by the end of my rounds when I go to the Amaps [Associations for the Maintenance of Rural Agriculture].”\n\nLe Dauphine – 1/21/2010\n\nHer husband, Christophe – a design teacher in Avignon – confirms: “Mr. Scott considers himself a lord and treats us like his commoners. He never deigned to meet us. We could have discussed among civilized people, especially since my wife speaks English well… The truth is that he covets our plot to install a wine cellar.”\n\nThe director, in contrast to the subtleties of local life, puts up a procedural frenzy. “He’s the type to sue the mistral because the wind bothers him,” sneer some local residents.\n\nLa Provence: 11/21/2009\n\nOne thrust to contest a building permit, another to complain about the cackling of chickens (sic): Scott is on his 6th court summons in five years. He lost three; the 3 others were judged yesterday for the construction of a hangar, and two building permits, never issued. “He watches us every time we move a finger. We live through hell,” says Christophe Orset, who has lived in the village for more than 30 years.\n\nSix procedures are being carried out against the town hall at a cost of 2,600 euros each. Result of the trial before the administrative court of Nîmes, as of December 12, again dismissed, and (Scott) ordered to pay a total of 4,000 euros to the municipality of Oppède for legal costs!\n\nLe Journal de Dimanche (JDD): 12/20/2009:\n\n“He was really looking for any stupid thing,” comments a neighbor. This is the time when the village gradually takes Rose’s side. Until then, when at the market, if she said that a billionaire was trying to trouble her, she was considered “a mythomaniac”. Everyone thought that Scott was suffering from a classic “Parisian syndrome”: “After two or three summers, the owners of second homes band together to block the slightest project that might disrupt the postcard they have gifted themselves with,” quipped an elderly Oppédois.\n\nDENOUEMENT\n\nThe years passed, and more years, without any reporting on the situation in Oppède.\n\nIn the summer of 2022, during a long stay in Provence, I tried to contact Christophe to get some news. We missed meeting. Instead, we exchanged emails.\n\nSuddenly, in 2018, after Christophe and Rose had endured 14 years of legal proceedings, Ridley Scott calmed down given a tragedy that beset them 12 years earlier.\n\nFurthermore, at that time, the situation was becoming untenable for them, especially with the agricultural authorities, City Hall…etc., and, I might add an ontological fatique.\n\nA cordial understanding coalesced among parties, as if by enchantment. Following a financial agreement with Ridley Scott in 2018, Rose and Christophe’s family settled in nearby Bonnieux.\n\nChristophe reports that they have found a “haven of peace” in Bonnieux; where they have completely transformed their lives – one good year after another.\n\nIn short, an agonizing drama that gashed the couple with misery for 14 years arrived at a Happy Ending. Only in Hollywood!\n\n*A Good Year\n\n*A Good Year is a 2006 film directed and produced by Ridley Scott, adapted from a book by his friend Peter Maybe written expressively for the film. Genres: Romance . Comedy. Drama.\n\nThe film is a clone of what the erudite writer Michael Jacobs dubbed the “Good Life Abroad Book,” a subspecies of the travel genre wherein expats, armed with marginal language skills and a slightly condescending tone, fructify fantasies of a Mediterranean lifestyle rarely realized by others. The film performed poorly at the box office, and it underwhelmed critics.\n\nSources\n\nLa Provence: Publié le 21/11/2009: https://bit.ly/3YVgSec\n\nLe Journal de Dimanche (JDD): Publié le 20/12/2009: https://bit.ly/3PeXeH2\n\nLe Dauphine: Publié le 21 / 01/ 2010: https://bit.ly/3sA7MaF\n\n##\n\nOscars Alert: In 1989, the Irishman Gay McGuinness wandered up the hill to the Domaine des Anges, captivated by the ethereal beauty of the place. Denuded of any knowledge of viticulture, he bought the vineyard when Malcolm Swan retired in 1992. Mr. McGuinness is the father-in-law of Cillian Murphy, nominated for Best Actor for “Oppenheimer.”\n\nIn those days and nights in 1973, his phone rang, incessantly. Their voices were scornful, menacing. They uttered threats to sabotage his vineyard. Their violent words conjured up physical harm. His supposed transgression: producing and bottling wine under his estate’s name.\n\nThis was not the dutiful winegrower, who toed the traditional line. It was not someone whose roots were in the region, some local farmer bereft of ambition.\n\nHe was a new breed, a foreigner, someone buoyed by freshness and animation, determined to make his mark in the wine world. Have no doubt about his courage. His character was defined by it.\n\nHis name: Malcolm Swam, a Brit. His winery: Domaine des Anges, which he purchased in 1973, in the AOC Côtes-du-Ventoux.\n\nMalcolm Swan: Intrepid Trailblazer\n\nI ran across Malcolm by a chance encounter in 2010, in Carpentras, at a vernissage for Ruth Middleton, an American artist, who was a neighbor of mine in the perched village of Venasque. I was keen on meeting local winegrowers, having harvested grapes the previous fall at Saint Jean du Barroux, the vineyard of Philippe Gimel.\n\nIt was mid-summer, the roads filled with tourists and cyclists. I made my way to the domaine, spread out over a hillside at 1200 feet near the village of Mormoiron, 50 miles northeast of Avignon.\n\nFrom the main building, under a blemishless and wide sky, your eyes glide across country, as flat as a playing field, to the Olympian view of the southern flank of the majestic limestone-capped Mont Ventoux.\n\nAtop the hill above the property, you make out the gauzy gray silhouette of a Chapel, the Notre Dames des Anges, from which the domaine takes its name.\n\nUpon arrival at an apartment at the Domaine des Anges where he was living in retirement, I was unprepared for the riveting scenes that Malcom summoned up about his initiation to the region.\n\nI thought I would hear the benign repetition of the daily acts of the wine grower, coupled with the unwelcome frustrations of storms, mildew, and ravaging sangliers. To my surprise, the first time we spoke it occurred to me that Malcom was like a revolutionary, having led a visionary existence by going all in for a cause.\n\nMalcolm Swan, a lover of opera, had a bold Celtic charm. He possessed a calm reverence for the art of winemaking one only achieves from intimate tending to and treating of the vines.\n\nThe First Ventoux Estate\n\nIt was in 1973 that the Ventoux earned the designation as an AOC (appellation d’origine contrôlée). At that time, Mr. Swan explained, all the growers in the appellation sold their grapes to the caves coopératives. There were no estate-bottled wines carrying the name of the winery on the label.\n\nMalcolm Swan had other ideas. As a newcomer to the region, he declared that he was going to produce wines as an independent producer, vinifying his wine in his own cellar.\n\nWine growers in the Ventoux treated him like an apostate, a traitor.\n\nMalcolm said it was useless to try to explain his motives. He did not let the danger of their threatening phone calls distract him. He was more concerned with producing fine wines than with being rejected. After all, he said, he was already a foreigner, a Brit.\n\nHis response to the invective and the insults, he told me, was as simple as simple can: “Wait and see.”\n\nIn 1987, Robert M. Parker Jr. published an epic book, Wines of the Rhone Valley, that introduced drinkers to the pleasures of Rhone wines. Parker saluted the wines of the Domaine des Anges:\n\n“Lastly, an Englishman, Malcolm Swan, has settled in France and makes one of the best Cotes du Ventoux at his property called Domaine des Anges. Recent vintages of this wine have exhibited exceptional charm and delicious fruit.”\n\nToday, there are more than 155 independent producers in the AOC Ventoux, offering great variety and quality.\n\nMalcolm Swan, an intrepid pioneer of Ventoux wine, passed away in September, 2017. He was aged 89. He had, always, the satisfaction of knowing, whatever the struggles, that he had made a distinguished name for himself and the Domaine des Anges.\n\nNaked Blends of Grenache-Syrah\n\nAs an appellation, the Ventoux, once known as Côtes du Ventoux before 2008, seems more like a concept due to its expansive reach across 15,000 acres of varying terrains and micro-climates.\n\nThere are three distinct regions in the AOC Ventoux: the basin of Malaucène east of Gigondas, the plains extending to the east from Carpentras, and an area southeast of Carpentras that borders the AOC Luberon in the northwest Luberon.\n\nThe Ventoux has been known as the land of caves coopératives (wine co-ops). There are 16 coopératives and 35 négociants that buy grapes directly from growers. Of total production, independent producers account for about only 20%.\n\nThe AOC Ventoux wines are dominated by the red grape varieties of Grenache and Syrah, with smaller portions of Mourvèdre, Cinsaut and Carignan in some blends. Growers have increased their production of rosé in the past ten years to meet increased demand. Today, the AOC produces 68% red, 26% rosé and 6% white.\n\nFrom time to time, wine writers come out with an article touting the wines of Ventoux, premised on estates turning out quality vintages in the appellation. Spot on: there exists a plentitude of quality.\n\nAn exemplar is an article in the Financial Times by Jancis Robinson, who covers the Ventoux landscape in admirable fashion.\n\nAs Ms. Robinson notes, the higher elevation in the Ventoux, along with the winds flowing down from Mont Ventoux, contribute to lower nighttime temperatures. Thus, the growing season is longer and the harvest for the late-ripening Grenache a week to ten-days later in the Ventoux than at lower altitudes along the Rhône.\n\nFurthermore, there is no vinification in new oak: you taste only the juice of the vines. As Robert M. Parker Jr. said, “I call them naked wines. There is no makeup.”\n\nMs. Robertson lists six AOC Ventoux estates for distinction:\n\nClos de Trias, Vieilles Vignes: Ch de Fondrèche, Divergente and Persia. Ch Juvenal, Les Ribes du Vallat and La Terre du Petit Homme, Ch Pesquié, Ascensio, Artemia and Quintessence, St-Jean du Barroux, La Pierre Noire, and Dom du Tix, Cuvée Bramefan.\n\nBy their vision, talent and dedication, these domaines, along with many others, are carrying out the legacy of Malcolm Swan in the Ventoux.\n\n##\n\nNote: Luma Arles opened June 26. Obtain Tickets to reserve time slots to visit Frank Gehry’s tower from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 pm (last entry). Ticket includes entry to all exhibitions and public garden:\n\nThe Backstory\n\nImpatience is a particular hazard for world class architects who strive to design art institutions. The competition is strenuous. Then upon being selected, getting the structure built is an even more strenuous bovine affair. It is axiomatic among architects and builders in France that nothing comes easy, and never on time.\n\nAlmost any perfervid admirer of architecture who tracks the “grands projets” in France has, down the last decade, endured aggravation over the delays in Frank Gehry’s immense 15-story structure covered with glass canopies for the Louis Vuitton Foundation in the Bois de Boulogne, Frank’s first French renaissance, which opened to blaring fanfare in October, 2014,\n\nYet, the legal wrangling for that project did not approach the interminable delays bordering on bewilderment over Luma Arles where the centerpiece is Frank Gehry’s luminous tower – his second French renaissance.\n\nHere is Frank’s voyage from inception, to approval, to celebration at the groundbreaking, aided along the way by the engagement of the arts patron Maja Hoffmann, founder of the Luma Foundation that funded the vast 24-acre complex. Ms. Hoffmann drove herself to achieve something of consequence that endures. It is an engagement that fueled her persistence, her intractability in pushing ahead against unforeseeable arduous circumstances.\n\nVoilà, the curtain opens.\n\nAn Attachment to France – The early 60’s\n\nIn 1960, Frank Gehry moved with his family to Meudon, a Paris suburb. Outside of his work with architects in Paris, there were tours arranged by the architect Mark Biass, a lifelong friend from his days at Harvard Graduate School of Design.\n\nThe visits made up a kind of gazetteer, places and their structures, old and modern, each with their own aura and style. Modern buildings in Paris, the icons of Notre Dame and Chartes, the cathedrals of Autun and Tournus, the creations of Le Corbusier in Paris, the monastery La Tourette in Évreux, and the Chapel at Ronchamp.\n\nIn France, Gehry fell under the spell of great architecture. The grandeur of its exalted structures dizzied him. The creations were an epiphany, confirming what he sought to feel about architecture, that it was an art of its own.\n\nIn the summer of 1961, there were things that mattered and things that one must do. Turning away a job offer in Paris, Frank Gehry yielded to the gravitational pull of Los Angeles where he was to set up his own office and pursue a singular identity.\n\nFrance was vital in this rite de passage, as well as revealing to Frank Gehry that creating great works is, in a sense, to rescue them from time.\n\nParis: The American Center – the 1990’s\n\nIn 1991, the American Center in Paris accepted an offer to relocate to Bercy, a French quarter along the Seine where wine warehouses were being refashioned for shops and restaurants.\n\nThe Board of the American Center commissioned Frank Gehry to design a new building facing the Parc de Bercy. Opened in 1994, with sweeping curvilinear surfaces and a jutting Cubist profile, the building was shuttered in 1996 due to financial overreach and mismanagement.\n\nThe structure stood ghost-like for the next nine years. The Ministry of Culture acquired the building, and extensively refurbished the interior to house, since 2005, La Cinémathèque Française. The exterior and key public interiors are virtually unchanged, and the building serves its new program as if designed for it, expressively.\n\nNote: The American Center was one of the last structures designed by Gehry and Partners before the firm adopted its CAITA software. (Source: Building Art: The Life and Work of Frank Gehry, Paul Goldberger)\n\nA Pang of Melancholy: 2003\n\nOn April 25, 2003, at Bard College, about an hour’s drive up the Hudson Valley from Manhattan, a throng of notable and cultured people gathered in a pastural setting to commemorate the Richard B. Fisher Center for the Performing Arts, designed by Frank Gehry, the famed harbinger of formless structures.\n\nThe stories of Frank Gehry’s architectural masterpieces preceded him, most notably of Guggenheim Bilbao and the Disney Concert Hall. His volcanic talent connects him to an upper world, an aristocrat of his profession.\n\nWhile everyone at Bard was quavering in excitement at the architect’s creation – undulating canopies of stainless steel, reflecting light skyward, and others caressing two concert halls – Frank Gehry was, for a transitory moment, gripped with a pang of melancholy, the recognition of France having passed him by.\n\nThis uninvited emotion asserted itself in a conversation between Frank Gehry and Frédéric Edelmann, the architecture critic of Le Monde, the leading French daily newspaper. As Edelmann recounted their exchange, Gehry said that he harbored regrets about never being invited to design a structure in France since the American Center in Paris, his only commission on French soil.\n\nNote: At this time, Frank Gehry’s renewal in France was in his line of sight. In 2002, Bernard Arnault, chairman of the French luxury group LVMH, met with Frank in New York City. Shortly afterwards, Bernard proposed to Frank to take on a commission to design a structure for the LV Fondation in the Bois de Boulogne in Paris. Design work would begin in earnest in 2005. (Source: Goldberger ibid).\n\nSketches of Frank Gehry: 2005\n\nMaja Hoffmann, the Swiss-born a pharmaceutical heiress (Hoffmann-La Roche) and patron of the arts, meets Frank Gehry during the filming of Sketches of Frank Gehry, directed by Sidney Pollack, a documentary she co-produced. Maja tells Frank that she has an idea en tête for him in Arles. Without any details, Frank signaled that he would be on board.\n\nArles Delegation meets Frank Gehry in New York: 2007\n\nIn 2007, Frank invited Maja to a dinner celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao. In Nov. 2007, Maja organized a trip to New York where Frank Gehry would meet with the Mayor of Arles Hervé Schiavetti and power brokers in the art community. In an exchange with the Mayor, Frank assures him that “I will be worthy of your Roman heritage.”\n\nIn December, 2007, the Luma Foundation announces a proposed project at the Parc des Ateliers, a 24-acres site that was once clusters of workshops (ateliers) for railroad maintenance and repair, near the center of Arles.\n\nMaja Cuts a Deal – 2008\n\nOn June 20, 2008, the Luma Foundation signed an agreement with AREA PACA concerning financial arrangements and costs. The Foundation was identified as an “acquisition candidate” for the Parc des Ateliers.\n\nAn Initial Design Gets Sabotaged – July 2008\n\nOn July 6, 2008, Maja Hoffmann and Frank Gehry presented the project in Arles in the presence of the Minister of Culture Christine Albanel and Arles mayor Hervé Schiavetti. Frank Gehry proposed structures of varying heights located near renovated clusters of ateliers (workshops).\n\nThe Grande Halle, the largest industrial building on the site, had been renovated with a budget of 5.8 million euros by the region, and inaugurated in October of 2007. The design presented called for the Grande Halle to be cut into two structures. The architects who directed the renovation mounted a public protest: media interviews along with threatening legal action. A revised design was mandated.\n\nSecond Design Shown in Paris and Venice Biennale: 2010\n\nIn 2010, Maja and Frank go on the road to present a second design for Luma Arles at the Pavillon de l’Arsenal in Paris from July 1 to 3, with Frank hosting a conference on July 1. On August 25, the Luma Foundation presented maquettes of its project at the Venice Architecture Biennale, with Frank reminding the audience that the design was a work in progress. Photos of Maja Hoffmann and Frank Gehry in Venice on ArchDaily.\n\nThe design featured two linked towers located near the Grande Halle.\n\nLe Choc. A Rejection: 2011\n\nIn an unnerving decision, in March, 2011, the National Commission for Historical Sites and Monuments rejected two of the five building permits because the towers siting over an ancient Roman cemetery could threaten Arles’ Unesco World Heritage classification. In addition, the towers obstructed views of a medieval church. The French Ministry of Culture concurred and recommended that the towers be repositioned on the site.\n\nSteeling herself, Maja Hoffmann stated, “We are convinced that large-scale cultural projects involving private and public partnerships are possible in France and we want to find ways to make them workable.” The way to make Luma Arles workable was strenuous: a third redesign by Frank Gehry of the tower, and relocating it on the site.\n\nThe Last Time: Third Design Presented in 2012\n\nA beleaguered, yet determined, Maja Hoffman told a French photography website, that “twice,” and “without consultation,” public authorities have changed the criteria of the building permit and the area concerned. In a minatory bark she said, “It goes without saying that this time will be the last.”\n\nIn December 2012, the “last time” arrived when a third revised design of Gehry’s tower and the Parc was formally presented by the project director Eric Perez, and Maja Hoffmann of the Luma Foundation.\n\nThe new design featured a single soaring 170-foot tower with a stone backbone, enveloped by a 54-foot glass rotunda and a landscaped courtyard, with 230 underground parking spaces. The tower was moved from its original proposed site close to the Avenue Victor Hugo.\n\nMaja Hoffmann, hardened as she was (or is undoubtably is) by five years of delays and tedious negotiations, refused to release to the press the final designs until such time that the construction permits were issued.\n\nThe Green Light: 2013\n\nOn July 10, 2013, Arles Mayor Hervé Schiavetti announced that the construction permits for the Luma Foundation had been approved and signed. There remained various administration procedures and the sale of land to complete before construction could proceed.\n\nA Joyous Groundbreaking: 2014\n\n“Arles is such a beautiful city. I have tried not to blemish its beauty.” Frank Gehry (Les Inrocks)\n\nOn April 5, 2014, a large crowd assembled in the Parc des Ateliers for a groundbreaking ceremony to hear accolades from Maja Hoffmann, Frank Gehry and the mayor of Arles. It had been nearly six years since Maja and Frank had unveiled the original design in July, 2008.\n\nThe sentiments they expressed that day had a melodic tone, rather than celebratory. Getting through the whole arduous experience produced an evocation of immense relief (soulagement), like marathon runners at the finish line, breathless. Les Inrocks magazine quoted a sardonic Frank Gehry, “The French are a complicated people. Maja knows how to get it done.”\n\nAnd get it done, she did.\n\nParis – It was like an apparition, the photograph of Marilyn Monroe. Her regal features: the Bambi eyelashes, the moist parted lips, the seductive open mouth, a vulnerable and welcome glance, and the slow-burning sensuality of America’s sexy waif-goddess.\n\nThe vivid colours – rich hues of ruby, raspberry and cherry – bathed me in the warmth of life, rising up like glowing flames whose images rained over me like a first love affair. Then, suddenly, it came to me, an epiphany: Marilyn Monroe is a rosé incarnate, a Tavel rosé mind you, the most carnal of all rosés. What they share, Marilyn and Tavel, is an archetypal beauty evoking the colour of love.\n\nChanel No. 5\n\nOn your palate, Tavel rings with berry and cherry flavours, with a hint of Marilyn’s lustiness triggered by a velvety spiciness. An elegant discreet ‘nose’ greets you with aromas of berries, dried flowers, peach, tangerine and rose. The latter is a heart note of Chanel No. 5, Marilyn’s favourite fragrance.\n\nAs Luca Turin reminds us, “We do not wear Chanel No. 5 because Marilyn Monroe wore it; we wear it for the same reason that Marilyn did: because it’s gorgeous.” Voilà: you don’t drink Tavel because it’s Marilyn Monroe incarnate; you drink it for the same reason we all do: because it’s a gorgeous rosé.\n\nTavel wines once wetted the lips of Popes, who resided in Avignon in the 14th Century rather than in Rome. The parched scrubby landscape and worn sun-bleached structures are like a ghost of an earlier, more glorious world.\n\nCenturies have bleached the inexhaustible stones of Provence, yet Tavel brings forth with each new vintage a gleaming rosé of irresistible rapturous sensuality, an aura of Marilyn’s purest beauty. When stationed on a Provencal table along with a few roses, the bottles shimmer with an amorous, muted raspberry glow.\n\nTavel Rosé: A Voluptuous Color\n\nThe voluptuous color of Tavel is born from a centuries-long tradition, a vinification process unique to the appellation.\n\nThe so-called cold maceration is the softening of grapes by soaking. The soaking endures from 12 to 48 hours, whereby the color, flavor and tannins are transferred from the grape skins to the wine juice. The weight of the skins and the must release the ‘free-run juices’ that are drained off into a vat.\n\nThen, the juices are separated from the skins by a light pressing of the grapes. The free-run juices contribute aromas, fruit, and acidity, with the pressed juices providing richness, structure and color.\n\nA temperature-controlled alcoholic fermentation lasts about 20 days in cement cuves, followed by the wine being aged in enamel-lined, stainless-steel cuves for 18 to 20 months.\n\nThe result: a rosé more powerful, more tannic and darker than other rosés. The trend today is to produce blends that are a lighter shade of pale.\n\nSome producers tout the absence of color in a rosé as modern-day hip sophistication. They go further. Paleness connotes quality, so they say. Don’t be taken in. These blends are mere whispers compared to the clean whistle of a Tavel rosé.\n\nTavel: A Gastronomic Rosé\n\nIn many appellations, rosé is made from parcels of lower quality, whereas in Tavel – the only appellation in France devoted uniquely to rosés – winemakers include grapes from the mature parcels in their blends.\n\nTavel winemakers choose from among nine grape varieties (cépages) for blending vintages, with Grenache the predominant grape (up to 60%). Tavel rosés do not require guzzling before the summer fades; their structure allows for a year or two of cellaring, their freshness ever present.\n\nEnriched with smooth tannins and lingering spiciness, the rosés of Tavel are a gastronomic delight. Marry Tavel with grilled fish and chicken dishes, Asian cuisines, ratatouille, a goat cheese salad, and Provencal cuisine.\n\nThere’s more to Tavel than a late afternoon insouciant buzz. It is a rosé enjoyed “a table” in the soft darkness of limpid nights, flooding your palate with the immaculate flavors of the sun-drenched terroir of Tavel.\n\nTavel: Richness Bestowed by Three Distinct Terroirs\n\nTavel, a tidy tract of 2,300 acres on the west bank of the Rhone. Marginally higher and somewhat drier than Châteauneuf-du-Pape (CDP) to the east, Tavel would have yielded red wines lighter than CDP. Consequently, rosés offered a promising niche.\n\nThere are three terroirs in Tavel: each of which has distinct attributes of soil, stone and mineral deposits, each of which contributes to the richness of the Tavel cuvées (blends).\n\nOlivet (1): A terrain on the map of gray greenish hues lying to the southeast of the village where the oldest estates in Tavel first cultivated vines on the accessible terraces and gentle slopes of light and permeable sandy soil with small pebbles. This terroir produces wine with a smooth texture, subtle aromas, and a strong bouquet. Yields are higher and alcohol is lighter than wine of the other two terroir.\n\nVallongue (2): North of the village, this terrain appears in brownish tones on the map, sharing with neighboring Chateauneuf-du-Pape the “galets ronds” – the round quart-sized pebbles brought by the Rhone during the Quaternary era. Wines feature higher alcohol, distinct pigments, and a firm and smooth structure.\n\nVestiges (3): West of the town, this terroir, which is slate-colored on the map, is one of the most arid in the region, with impoverished soil that requires a deep root system The terrain is covered by lauzes, flint-shaped white stones. The wines are dense, taut, and high in minerals, blended for fruity aromas and complexity.\n\nAmong attributes of wine, minerality is one of the most difficult attributes to define. I defer to the brilliance of Steven Spurrier, the UK wine legend:\n\n“I suppose it (minerality) is easier to describe what it is not, that is, it is not fruity, nor acidity, nor tannins, nor oak, nor richness, nor fleshiness. I think it (minerality) is just there, a sort of lifted and lively stoniness that brings a sense of grip and a sense of depth, but it is neither grippy (which is tannin) nor deep (which is fruit).”\n\nVoila, the diversity and complexity of Tavel to explore. Estates produce cuvées from grapes of all terroirs, as well as ones exclusively from a single terroir.\n\nTavel: A Rosé of Intimacy\n\nThe usual approach to drinking rosé is that it be seen first, and then sipped. Tavel, however, can not be seen that way. It demands an examination by sight, sniffing and tasting.\n\nTavel is luxurious and luminous, yet not precious. Approachable and affordable, it can take awhile to work its way into your consciousness.\n\nOnce it does, Tavel is a rose of intimacy, by which I mean it is filled with the detail of history, of elegant aromas and of a smooth richness that lingers in your mouth. And in your memory.\n\nWhere Tavel stands among roses is where it has always stood, and you carefully place its heritage where it belongs, before the rest.\n\nLooking for Tavel Rosé\n\nDomaine Maby has top-rated vintages. Recent tastings of a sublime Cuvée Tavel Roc-Epine from Domaine Lafond, and a gracious Domaine Corne-Loup Tavel Rosé by Geraldine Saunier. For a grower producing a single cuvée, Prieuré de Montézargues. The Château de Manissy offers a Cuvée des Lys blended exclusively for the U.S. market. A lovable drink is Château de Trinquevedel, imported by Kermit Lynch. Château d’Aqueria appears on many shelves and wine lists. Feeling stylish, the cuvée La Reine des Bois from Le Domaine de la Mordorée is worth swiping your plastic.\n\nThere are dozens of other estates. Learn more about Tavel here.\n\nCouleur Tavel: Celebrating the Essence\n\nCouleur Tavel is an annual festival when the town of Tavel quivers with excitement: music, art, theater, sublime cuisine and tastings galore of Tavel rosés from the appellation’s producers.\n\nThe festival runs from 4:00 p.m. until midnight on the third Saturday in July. Facebook here.\n\nBreaking:\n\nJune 2024: Tickets to reserve time slots to visit Gehry’s tower from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 pm (last entry). Ticket includes entry to all exhibitions and public garden:\n\nSpring, 2020: Luma Arles and Les Rencontres d’Arles entered into a partnership on exhibition space for the photography festival at Luma Arles beginning in 2020, announced former mayor Hervé Schiavetti at Paris press event announcing the 2020 festival program. Agreement is for five years. Alas, agreement delayed until 2021.\n\nGehry in Arles\n\nAt first approach from the Avenue Victor Hugo in central Arles, there is something about Frank Gehry’s stainless steel-cladded tower glistening amid the faded camel, umber, rose colors of a timeworn landscape. It sits defiant, like a remonstrance.\n\nPerched on a plinth and rising from 54-foot glass atrium, the soaring 170-foot tower is a 53,000 square-feet surface of metal panels supporting more than 10,000 blocks of gleaming hammered stainless steel.\n\nThe nexus of a complex, known as Luma Arles, the structure will be home to the Luma Foundation, created by Maja Hoffmann, a pharmaceutical heiress (Hoffmann-La Roche) and high-spirited (fougueuse) patron of the arts.\n\nThe Luma Foundation supports independent artists, and facilitates discourse and inventiveness by sponsoring cultural, educational and the environmental initiatives.\n\nYou can take Frank Gehry’s tower as a twisting tornado, as one architecture critic put it, or you can dismiss it as a beer can (une canette) like certain locals do who don’t get anything.\n\nOr you come to understand it as I do, as the legacy of an indissoluble engagement to art and to the environment — the empowerment to create and preserve unalterable beauty.\n\nEngagement: The Environment\n\nA Swiss doctoral student, Luc Hoffmann (1923-2016) came after the war to the Camargue, the wild humid delta of brine lagoons and marshes, that stretches from the south of Arles to the Mediterranean sea. At first sight, he was in its thrall. For his thesis, he studied the chicks of the common tern. So, it began. A lifelong engagement. His dedication to the Camargue was pure, even angelic. Luc Hoffmann was like a revolutionary: one gave, everything, for the cause. His visionary existence required a base: he acquired the Tour de Valat estate in the heart of the Camargue. In 1954, he set up there a biological research institute that incarnates today the founder’s incorrigible determination. His passion for nature never faltered. Luc Hoffmann co-founded the World Wildlife Fund, and set up the Mava Foundation to fund conservation projects. 2012 saw the advent of the Luc Hoffmann Institute devoted to sustainable development.\n\nEngagement: Art and Culture\n\nIn 1956, Luc Hoffman relocated the family to the Camargue. Over the course of the years, he exemplified to his children a life that had always been lived in accordance with a passion for engagement. For them, it must have been like learning some heroic language. Maja Hoffmann attended a school that her father established on the estate. She had a stint working at La Tour du Valat. Her father revealed an engagement to the world of nature to her, call it conservation; she came to add the universes of art, culture, education and human rights. In the end no one of them less precious than another. These values assert themselves in the Luma Foundation, which may be appreciated as a vital part of Maja Hoffmann’s own self-concept — deep convictions that are emotional and visceral, borne at a young age. Among the inhabitants of Arles, Maja Hoffmann is, simply, une fille du sud. (a girl of the south). For them, this trait is the predominant element in the donnée of her biography. As someone framed it to me in Arles, “Tout s’explique,” (explains everything). Her engagement is the ineluctable emotional force that drove her to do something of consequence that endures, as her father devoted his fortune to preserving the Camargue and the environment. It is an engagement that fueled her persistence, her intractability in pushing ahead against unforeseeable arduous circumstances — the impersonal and the personal. Among the ways of her family that Maja Hoffmann brought to Luma Arles are: discretion is good taste; words, well-chosen, are important, and the slightest ostentation is classless. So, our narrative begins. Voilà, the mis-en-scene.\n\nArles: Overwhelming Antiquity\n\nOn warm and muggy nights in Arles, the pace is languid. People sit at ease on the terrace, in awe of no one. There are no temptations as much as consolations of a leisurely evening.\n\nIn Arles, vestiges of an ancient past dismantles modern memory into sepia tones. The weary antediluvian panorama seems resistant to any fresh coat of modernism.\n\nPerched on the Rhone in Southern France, Arles is a town where every public surface wears a patina of antiquity – cramped lurid biscuit-colored edifices and decaying gray stones.\n\nArles sided with Caesar over Pompey (Marseille), an alliance that brought prosperity in the 4th and 5th centuries. During 1888-89, van Gogh resided in Arles, memorializing the town in 300 paintings. Once a thriving port, Arles was relegated to a backwater with the arrival of the railroad.\n\nLacking any industrial base, Arles has struggled to prosper. Inhabitants refer to the town as broke (fauchée), its institutions starving (au pain sec).\n\nUnemployment, which ran over 15% in recent years, now has dipped below 14%. Among the youth, the out-of-work tops 30%. A quarter of residents are retired. The haute bourgeoisie of Arles live elsewhere, in villages in the Alpilles like Saint Etienne du Grès and Mausanne.\n\n“Arles is a town which is often forgotten..One time a year it reawakens for the photography festival.” Maja Hoffmann (Le Monde)\n\nI know three Arles: One, the first ten days of July when the photo festival has splashy events; two, the other summer weeks when the festival brings in a steady stream of visitors, and the last, in the winter, a mirthless town of cold naked stones where inhabitants measure out the days in exact portions.\n\nJournalists write about Luma Arles from afar, forgoing a visit. For one, Paul Goldberger, biographer of Frank Gehry (see below). And Art News, whose reporter last month misidentified Arles as “marshy wet lands” and as home to the Tour du Valat. No, it’s the Camargue.\n\nArles: Photography Magnificent\n\n“To collect photographs is to collect the world.” Susan Sontag, On Photography\n\nWith art, inspiration is everything. One knows that instinctively. It hung over Lucien Clergue (1934-2014), and his friends in Arles like an unpronounced duty (un devoir). Lucien Clergue, a lifelong resident of Arles, was the first photographer to be elected to the Paris-based l’académie des Beaux-Arts, and to serve as its president.\n\nIn the late 1950’s, Clergue began to pester his childhood friend Jean-Maurice Rouquette, the curator of Arles’ Musée Réattu, about the absence of any museum in France with a dedicated collection of photography. In 1961, Clergue traveled to New York. His first stop was at the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) to view Guernica by Picasso. As Clergue recounted in an oral history:\n\n“At MOMA, to my great surprise, you had to go through rooms displaying black and white photographs to reach Guernica. I said to Jean-Maurice that to view the world’s greatest contemporary painting, you have to walk through photography. That moment in New York was capital in making us move forward.”\n\nIn 1965, the two men organized a mailing to photographers worldwide asking them to donate prints for the photography collection at the museum. Only two photographers refused to donate: Cartier-Bresson and Avedon. Other prints of Edward Weston were donated by Jerome Hill. With enough prints to display in a room, the Mayor of Arles was persuaded to give his consent for the the second floor of the Musée Réattu to be dedicated to photography. Before long came an opportunity for Arles to enlarge its footprint in photography. The annual Festival of Arles, caught up in the revolutionary fervor of 1968, was the target of calls to revamp its dull format. In an oral history, Roquette reminisced:\n\n“We said that the only thing we have that is free is photography. We proposed bringing three photographers to present slides of their work in the reception room at City Hall. There were lines out the door until 3:00 a.m. The next year we set up about 400 chairs in the courtyard of the Musée Réattu. And it took off like that.”\n\nWith a photography festival in gear, Clergue began to network with photographers. In 1971, he made a world tour. In Carmel (CA), he met Ansel Adams. With its sparse resources, the nascent festival sponsored a trip for Ansel Adams. In 1974, Adams taught a workshop at the festival. When he returned home, Adams gave a press conference at which he applauded Arles for doing amazing things for photography . Adams’ participation at the festival was an imprimatur, a watershed moment that bequeathed Arles an unalterable destiny: a fervid summer festival for world photography – Les Rencontres d’Arles – that attracts today over 100,000 visitors. In the beginning: folding chairs.\n\nLuma Arles: A Timeline\n\n2004: Luma Foundation\n\nZurich-based Maja Hoffmann launches the Luma Foundation, named after her children Lucas and Marina.\n\n2005: Frank Gehry\n\nMaja Hoffmann meets Frank Gehry during the filming of Sketches of Frank Gehry, directed by Sidney Pollack, a documentary she co-produced.\n\n2006: Economic Development Zone\n\nOn July 17, the City of Arles approves the creation of an economic development zone – ZAC des Ateliers – for the development of the Parc des Ateliers.\n\n2007: AREA PACA\n\nOn June 12, the City Arles appoints AREA PACA, a regional manager of large public projects, to oversee and manage the development of the Parc des Ateliers.\n\n2007-2008: A Bright and Shining Future for Arles\n\nIn 2007, Frank invited Maja to a dinner celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao. She saw the “Bilbao effect” au premier rang. In Nov. 2007, Maja organized a trip to New York with the Mayor and others to meet with Frank Gehry. In December, 2007, the Luma Foundation announced a proposed project at the Parc des Ateliers, a 24-acres site that was once clusters of workshops (ateliers) for railroad maintenance and repair, near the center of Arles. On June 20, 2008, the Luma Foundation signed an agreement with AREA PACA concerning financial arrangements and costs. The Foundation was identified as an “acquisition candidate” for the Parc des Ateliers.\n\nLuma Arles will be anchored by a 170-foot structure designed by Frank Gehry. This structure would serve as the headquarters of the Luma Foundation, and include exhibition space, a library, classrooms, archive storage, artists’ residences, and a cafe. Six existing structures will be renovated for exhibition space by Selldorf Architects in New York. The landscape architect, Bas Smets in Brussels, will design a 10-acre public park with hundreds of trees. The project at the Parc des Ateliers will be financed by the Luma Foundation with an original contribution of €100 million ($115M). Note: The investment today approaches €200 million. In July, 2008, Maja Hoffmann and Frank Gehry presented the project at Les Rencontres d’Arles, in the presence of the Minister of Culture Christine Albanel and Arles mayor Hervé Schiavetti. Frank Gehry proposed two-linked towers on varying heights located next to the renovated clusters of ateliers. The Luma Foundation’s campus will accommodate exhibitions during the annual summer photography festival.\n\n2010: Venice Biennale\n\nThe Luma Foundation presented the maquette of its project at the Parc des Ateliers at the Venice Biennale. Photos of Maja Hoffmann and Frank Gehry, and of the presentation on ArchDaily.\n\n2011: Le Choc. A Set Back\n\nIn an unnerving decision, in March the National Commission for Historical Sites and Monuments rejected two of the five building permits because the towers siting over an ancient Roman cemetery could threaten Arles’ Unesco World Heritage classification. In addition, the towers as obstructed views of a medieval church. The French Ministry of Culture concurred and recommended that the towers be repositioned on the site.\n\nSteeling herself, Maja Hoffmann stated, “We are convinced that large-scale cultural projects involving private and public partnerships are possible in France and we want to find ways to make them workable.” The way to make Luma Arles workable was strenuous: redesign of the tower by Frank Gehry, and relocating it on the site.\n\n2012: Le Parc des Ateliers\n\nThe Parc des Ateliers is drab and dreary vista. A grid of washed-out buildings and burned-out workshops stretch across a parched dirt surface sprinkled with scruffy haphazard plant life and weedy stubble. Many artists have complained about exhibiting in the worn-down ateliers which are at times flooded by summer storms or turned into furnaces on hot days. In 2012, the German photographer Andreas Gursky refused to exhibit at the festival in protest to the conditions.\n\n2012: The Last Time\n\nA beleaguered, yet determined, Maja Hoffman told a French photography website, that “twice,” and “without consultation,” public authorities have changed the criteria of the building permit and the area concerned. In a minatory bark she said, “It goes without saying that this time will be the last.”\n\nIn December 2012, the “last time” arrived when a revised design of Gehry’s tower and the Parc was formally presented by the project director Eric Perez, and Maja Hoffmann of the Luma Foundation.\n\nThe new design featured a single soaring 170-foot tower of twisted aluminum foam with a stone backbone, enveloped by a 54-foot glass rotunda and a landscaped courtyard, with 230 underground parking spaces. The tower has been displaced from its original proposed site, moved closer to the Avenue Victor Hugo.\n\nMaja Hoffmann, hardened as she was (or is undoubtably is) by five years of delays and tedious negotiations, refused to release to the press the final designs until such time that the construction permits were issued.\n\n2013: The Green Light\n\nOn July 10, Arles Mayor Hervé Schiavetti announced that the construction permits for the Luma Foundation had been approved and signed. There remained various administration procedures and the sale of land to complete before construction could proceed.\n\n2013: François Hébel\n\nOver the course of several years, I thought that I was watching some mordant tragedy playing out in Arles in which two driven individuals, both uncommonly self-possessed, were symbolically opposed. It was not merely that the world had set the two of them at odds. The end game meant that one of them must lose if the other were to win. In 1986, François Hébel took command of the Les Rencontres d’Arles. He launched the display of photographs in the dilapidated railroad workshops. The Parc des Ateliers evolved into a distinctive terrain at the festival. In 1987, Hébel brought to Arles the personal narrative of love and loss of Nan Golden: “The Ballad of Sexual Dependency.” The iconic show brought a sunburst of aesthetic esteem to the festival. Despite two smashing years in Arles, Hébel left to direct Magnum Photos. François Hébel returned to Arles in 2001 as director of a festival heavily in debt with 95 percent of its funding from public sources. Attendance was averaging 9,000 per season. Maja Hoffmann supported the arrival of Hébel by creating, in 2002, the Prix Découverte, an annual prize recognizing young talent in photography. By 2013, Les Rencontres d’Arles had a robust balance sheet with 40 percent of funding coming from visitors, 40 percent from public funds, and 20 percent from sponsors. Attendance was exceeding 90,000.\n\n2013: The Unraveling\n\nThe Parc des Ateliers, a thread woven into the tissue of the festival, became the cause of a long unraveling. Turning backwards to my visits to Arles before 2013, I recall hearing murmurs in the wings (les coulisses) that Hébel’s attitude towards the Luma Foundation had calcified into mistrust (méfiance). What haunted François Hébel was losing control over exhibition space in the renovated ateliers. Aggravated he was by Maja Hoffman’s intention to display at Luma Arles art from her private collection and from the family collection stored in Basel, and works acquired by the Foundation. There was another source for his pent-up frustrations. Hébel saw Arles as an orphan, ignored by carriéristes in the Culture Ministry who channel funds to glitzy festivals. In July, 2013, he put his sentiments, sarcastically, to Le Monde:\n\n“The Cannes Film Festival has its Palace. We are boy scouts camping on the ground.”\n\nFrançois Hébel fought back. He pitched an International Center for Photography that would occupy the ateliers, permanently, sustained by a budget of 34 million euros. In effect, his audacious project would banish the Luma Foundation from the ateliers. I heard a gallery owner remark, “Quel culot!” (What nerve!) The denouement: construction permits were approved in July, and in the fall PACA, the regional government authority, agreed to sell the land of the ateliers to the Luma Foundation for 10 million euros. The coup humiliant (a humiliating blow) came on October 22 when the Culture Ministry rejected Hébel’s alternative proposal, preferring the private initiative of the Luma Foundation. Anti-climatic the moment was on Nov. 5 when Hébel shot off an impassioned five-page letter to Jean-Noël Jeanneney, president of the Festival, in which he announced his departure after the 2015 season, and elaborated on his frustrations and discontents.\n\nSome exits are unforeseeable, even unimaginable. I submit that it was François Hébel’s hubris that put him in an untenable position. It blinded him to how unforgiving the machinery is behind progress. Alas, his letter to Jeanneney came off as petulant, his resignation as poignant, since his reign in Arles had an Athenian brilliance. A prince had fallen from the heights.\n\n2014: The Groundbreaking\n\n“Arles is such a beautiful city. I have tried not to blemish its beauty.” Frank Gehry (Les Inrocks)\n\nOn April 5, a large crowd assembled in the Parc des Ateliers for a groundbreaking ceremony to hear accolades from Maja Hoffmann, Frank Gehry and the mayor of Arles. It had been nearly six years since Maja and Frank had unveiled the original design in July, 2008.\n\nThe sentiments they expressed that day had a more melodic tone, rather than celebratory. Getting through the whole arduous experience produced an evocation of immense relief (soulagement), like marathon runners at the finish line, breathless.Les Inrocks magazine quoted a sardonic Frank Gehry, “The French are a complicated people. Maja knows how to get it done.”\n\n2014: Sam Stourdzé Named New Director\n\nIn the community of French photography, you can pile the elite directors of festivals, museums and exhibitions into a minivan. Among those with a reserved seat was Sam Stourdzé, director of the Élysée Museum in Switzerland, an institution dedicated to photography.\n\nHis appointment as the new director of Rencontres d’Arles was announced in April, 2014, a week after the groundbreaking.\n\nWhile Stourdzé lacks Hebel’s narcissism and quirky talent for publicity, he brought to Arles the impassioned, yet rigorous, management style of a museum director. In his first festival season, 2015, he reduced the number of exhibitions to 35 from 50.\n\nIn 2016, Stourdzé more than doubled the number of artists exhibiting, from 113 to 250, at 25 locations. Attendance remained glorious, topping more than 100,000 visitors.\n\nOf tantamount importance is a harmonious relationship between Les Rencontres d’Arles and the Luma Foundation, which has assured Stourdzé and his team of the festival’s autonomy.\n\n2015: Arles’ Clout in French Photography\n\nIn the winter of 2015-16, I caught myself saying that it’s not hard to see how the surging currents of French photography all flow through Arles.\n\nThe Jeu de Paume, Paris, had an exhibit of Philippe Halsman, co-curated by Sam Stourdzé. One stop on the Paris Métro put me at the Grand Palais for a retrospective of the Arlesian Lucien Clergue, co-curated by Christian Lacroix, a native of Arles, and François Hébel.\n\n2016: Frank Gehry Structure Named\n\nThe building designed by Frank Gehry was designated the working title of “The Center for Human Dignity and Ecological Justice” to embrace the intertwining principles of human rights and the right to a healthy environment.\n\n2017: Annie Leibovitz Exhibit\n\nThe Luma Foundation acquired the archives of the American photographer Annie Leibovitz – The Early Years, 1970-1983. The photographs were on display in the Grande Halle of the ateliers from May until 24 September. A mild irony: François Hébel hung some photos of Annie Leibovitz in 1986 when the ateliers were first used as exhibit space.\n\n2017: Les Rencontres d’Arles\n\nLes Rencontres d’Arles organized exhibits in the Parc des Ateliers in L’Atelier des Forges, and La Mécanique Générale. The numbers: 125,000 visitors (up 20% from ’16), 250 artists, and 40 expositions in 25 locations.\n\n2018-19: Les Rencontres d’Arles\n\nRencontres d’Arles wrapped up its 2018 season by announcing a record attendance of 140,000 visitors, an increase of 12% from 2017. There were 36 exhibitions in the formal program, along with another 24 in associated programs.\n\n2019 was a record shattering summer with 145,000 visitors at 51 exhibits to celebrate the festival’s 50th anniversary.\n\nPaul Goldberger: The Frank Gehry Biography\n\nDown through four decades from his perch at the New York Times and The New Yorker, the architecture critic Paul Goldberger covered Frank Gehry, who was…”arguably the most famous architect in the world…” he wrote. His intimacy with the man and his work made him a natural to pen a biography. With a pleasant flowing style that is an expression of his congenial personality, Goldberger chronicles, with entertaining details, the journey of Frank Gehry in “Building Art” (September, 2015). Goldberger reveals the gift France gave Frank Gehry: a glimpse of what architecture could be. Gehry spent a year in Paris in the early 1960’s working with architects. The Romanesque and Gothic cathedrals, and the creations of Le Corbusier were an epiphany, confirming what he sought to feel about architecture. The American Center in Paris was Frank Gehry’s first project in France. Opened in 1994 with sweeping curvilinear surfaces and a jutting Cubist profile, the building was shuttered in 1996 due to financial mismanagement. It now houses a national museum of cinema. In 2004 came the opportunity for Frank Gehry to renew his attachment to France. Bernard Arnault, chairman of the French luxury conglomerate LVMH, approached him to design a museum for the Fondation Louis Vuitton in the Bois de Boulogne in Paris. The Foundation Louis Vuitton was inaugurated in October, 2014, six months after construction began on Frank Gehry’s structure in Arles.\n\nIn his book, Goldberger’s noted Luma Arles in a compact 220-word summary.\n\nTributes: The team of curators and artists who are working with Maja Hoffmann to actualize Luma-Arles are: Tom Eccles, Bard College Director (New York), Hans Ulrich Obrich, co-Director of the Serpentine gallery (London), Beatrix Ruf, director of the Stedelijk Museum (Amsterdam), and artists Philippe Parreno (Paris) and Liam Gillick (New York).\n\n##\n\n“No one gets over anything.” Jim Harrison\n\nN.D.L.R.: This article published pre-Covid\n\nAlexis Lichine: The Pope of Wine\n\nI can not count the times, down the years, to come across a memoir by an unfamous offspring of a famous personage in the literary or art world, premised on some anger at the real or perceived shortcomings of the father.\n\nI never thought of a twist on this phenomena asserting itself in the wine world. An ambitious son, Sacha Lichine, who leveraged a heritage into unimaginable riches, emoting on the memory of his wine industry legend father, Alexis Lichine, in the French newspaper Le Monde. At first read, I was bouche bée (astonished).\n\nIn the early 80’s, at a café on the rue Saint Honoré, I met up with a strawberry blonde actress in from Hollywood. She thought that I, with my minor roles in French cinéma, could lead her to an audition with an A-list director like Bertrand Blier.\n\nSuddenly, she had to run to the gare to catch a train to Bordeaux. Her destination: Château Prieuré-Lichine. Her host: Alexis Lichine. When crossing streets, her beauty crushed hearts beneath her heels.\n\nAuthor of the Wines of France\n\nA Russian-born naturalized American, Alexis Lichine seized the wine world by its trunk. He commanded at various times every branch: retail salesman in NY, leading importer of French wines, author of “Wines of France” and “Encyclopedia of Wines and Spirits,” owner of Château Prieuré-Lichine in Bordeaux, and other properties. He was an incessant advocate for French wines in the U.S. and on French TV.\n\nAlexis Lichine had a reputation, even at un brave âge, as a noceur, a lover of parties and beautiful company – “les demoiselles,” as he told People Magazine.\n\nKnown as the “Pope of Wine,” Alexis Lichine could be brash. And difficult, to which he confessed: “Of course I am difficult. Marlene Dietrich once told me that people who know what they want are always accused of being difficult.”\n\nWhen I relocated to Manhattan to sell wine at an upscale shop near Central Park, one spoke there of Alexis Lichine in the hushed tones reserved for kings.\n\nThe great Frank Prial of the New York Times gave this salute to Lichine upon his death in 1989. “We had come in the end to think of him as a kind of Monument Historique, dominating the wine scene the way the Eiffel Tower dominates Paris…Imperious, querulous, egotistical…He was one of a kind and we shall not see his like again.”\n\nSacha Lichine: To the Château Born\n\nSacha Lichine grew up in Manhattan, attending the Lycée Français, and spending summers in Bordeaux. Alexis and his mother divorced in the early 1960’s.\n\nAt an early age, Sacha came to know the wine world and its ways. He organized tours to posh restaurants in France and was a sommelier. Assignments followed at a wine brokerage and a wine importer, and setting up a distributorship for Louis Roederer Champagne in the Caribbean.\n\nAll the while, a self-absorbed Alexis reveled in the social frenzy and the grandeur. He split his time between a 14-room apartment on the Upper East Side and Bordeaux. Father and son were like two neutral countries: occasional friction but no combat.\n\nSacha had worked his way up, and seemed to know everything about wine. Yet, there was a yearning for more attention and affirmation. With the years came a mellowing that, as Frank Prial noted, brought a coming together in Bordeaux.\n\nSacha returned to the Château in 1987. When Alexis passed away two years later, Sacha was well-armed to assume control of the Château Prieuré Lichine.\n\nSacha expanded production and upgraded the cellars at the Château. He diversified his investments in other wineries and a wine brokerage. Whatever passion there was, it became used up. With Bordeaux no longer lustrous, Sacha moved to Switzerland. In 1999, the Château was sold for a reported $28.8 million. There were debts.\n\nIt was to be in the Var, the sun-parched département between Provence and the Riveria, where his true ambition found its place. Sacha’s destiny would remain in wine, rosés rather than reds.\n\nThe Pasha of French Rosé\n\nIn 2006, Sacha Lichine purchased the Château d’Esclans near the the village of La Motte in a vast area of Le Var known as L’Arriere-Pays Varois.\n\nSacha’s first move was to launch a rosé called Whispering Angel. It is a négociant [nay-goh-SYAHN] wine produced by purchasing grapes from multiple vineyards. Whereas production at an estate is limited by the surface area of vines, a négociant may increase supply by buying more grapes from other vineyards.\n\nWhat mild irony comes calling when one recalls that Alexis Lichine urged French vineyards in Burgundy, Alsace and Beaujolais to produce estate-bottled wines by not selling their grapes to négociants.\n\nThe rage for French rosés is manifest in a 55% sales growth in two consecutive years, with more than 800,000 cases from the Provence appellations. Wildly poured (pre-COVID) in South Beach, New York City, and in the Hamptons, Sacha Lichine’s wines represent 20% of all Provence rosés sold, and 25% of their value. Anthony Bourdain loved to quip that rosé is “Hampton’s Juice.”\n\nWhispering Angel: Pale Rosé\n\nSnazzy promotional images for Whispering Angel feature playful young women, who are “the best agents for the brand,” Sacha told Le Monde. The wine’s other seductive selling point: paleness, the paler the better.\n\nFrom an initial 160,000 bottles, production of 2016 Whispering Angel is nearing a stupefying 5 million. Sacha exports more than 2.4 million bottles to the U.S. He aims to do 12 million. His only frustration is supply – French laws limit the planting of vines. On the Chateau’s website, the ever humble Sacha makes a rather dubious claim that Whispering Angel is “reputedly become the world’s greatest rosé.”\n\nThe Chateau d’Esclans vinifies three estate-bottled rosés of distinction. If you ever catch a woman sipping the estate’s Garrus rosé, she is either well-loved or very rich ($95.00 a bottle).\n\nShunning his father’s taste for bespoke suits, Sacha favors pink shirts, owning a closet-full, mind you. In Town and Country Magazine, Jay McInerney lauded Sacha’s festive side:\n\n“…an irresistible force, a Falstaffian figure who probably drinks more Château d’Esclans than any of his customers and who savors every meal as if it were his last. After spending a long night with him in Miami, I can vouch for his joie de vivre and endurance.”\n\nWith his fantastic success and supreme independence comes a certain edge that is dismissive of the wine world, as Sacha told Le Monde:\n\n“It’s the snobbism that I don’t like. All these people who talk about wine in a pretentious way that one cannot understand”\n\nSuccess Is Not Enough\n\nSacha learned to swim in the turbulent waters of sheer ambition, and to stay erect amid gusts of narcissism and megalomania.\n\nThere were traits of the father that the son took on, among them not to mince words, defiance in ignoring conventions, and the cordial European art of hospitality (l’art de recevoir). To these one can add an essential trait: to sell wine, one must faire du charme (be charming).\n\nIn Le Monde, Sacha remarked that his days in Bordeaux have left a sour aftertaste:\n\n“I am from Bordeaux, but I do not like their mentality, the incestuous side. One talks behind your back; everyone wants to take the wife of another.”\n\nThese sentiments resonated with those of Alexis who, according to Frank Prial in his book Decantations, “mocked and raged at what he considered the secrecy, the snobbery and the petty jealousies” in the Bordeaux wine scene.\n\nThere were early hurts, never forgotten, like fading scars never quite vanished. During the interview with Le Monde, Sacha emoted about intimate details, the dregs of his inheritance.\n\n“I have much respect for him, but he was a very bad father. He was too tough, emotionally abusive*. He did not care for his wives, nor for his children. The world turned around him and his affairs.”\n\nThen another eruption, this one more graphic:\n\n“I have a selective memory. At 14, one pushed my head down into a toilet, and flushed it. That I do not forget.”\n\nSacha, like Alexis, lives life in accordance with success, relishing its intensity, its pleasures, and its boundlessness. That said, for any son or daughter of a great man, one always exists, in a large or small part, in the shadow of the one gone before.\n\nSuccess is not enough for breaking free from the iron chains of memory. The writer Jim Harrison cautioned us: “One never gets over anything.”\n\n##\n\n*The term Sacha employed was “pratiquait le tabassement émotionnel.” Tabassement is derived from the verb tabasser, which means to hit repeatedly with force, to thrash, literally, to beat up. Pratiquait means practiced.\n\nThe waves of beautiful faces, of bright mouths and of perfect limbs washed over the riveting gazes of admirers at the Earl Carroll Theatre in Hollywood, the flashy theater-restaurant that, in the 1940’s, prefigured the glamour of Vegas.\n\nUndamaged and innocent, the beautiful women on stage evoked an overwhelming desire that their moment would come, soon, before they would have to scatter and discover random fates when the spotlight was no longer.\n\nA beauty among beauties at Earl Carroll, Beverly was uncommonly radiant: silken legs, golden blonde locks, and blue oceanic eyes. Elegant, eloquent and breathing self-esteem, her destiny had a focus, a place: Paris.\n\nIn the 1950’s, Paris, reawakened and abounding with Americans of talent and ambition, was a city that she had been bred for. There, she came into the orbit of the celebrated illustrator and storyteller Ludwig Bemelmans.\n\nHer beauty, her irresistible charm, and her love affair with Armand, a French count, inspired Bemelmans’ dazzling imagination when he was living on the banks of Seine.\n\nBemelmans published, in October, 1957, a novel, The Woman of My Life. Beverly is the woman. Her identity – revealed to me at by surprise – I am now obliged to share.\n\nThere is another story, a tranche of her life, that I place, carefully, alongside his. Like some ravishing women, she would trust her life to men, alas, foreboding trouble.\n\nBeverly becomes a conduit for the stories of others who touched her life in Paris in the 1950’s: Le beau monde, art, and the implacable power of love.\n\nVoilà, the stage is empty. The curtain rises. The actors take their places.\n\nLudwig Bemelmans\n\nWe all have access to the donnée of the life of Ludwig Bemelmans, the gifted illustrator and author of more than forty books. Millions know him through the creation of Madeline, a French gamine, and her adventures in a series of children books.\n\nNew Yorkers, with a hint of society, relish his delightful murals of Central Park that grace Bemelmans Bar at the Carlyle Hotel.\n\nBemelmans was un homme déraciné. A tumultuous childhood: born in the Austrian Tyrol, raised by a French governess who became pregnant by his father and commited suicide, abandoned by his father, shuffled off with his pregnant mother to her family in Germany, kicked back to his uncle, and then sent off to New York in 1914, at the age of 16, for a brief failed reunion with his father. Stupefying.\n\nHis youth endued him with the will and energy that Hemingway had written about to F. Scott Fitzgerald, “You just have to go on when it is worst and most helpless.” Going on was Bemelmans’ distinction.\n\nHotels would harbour him. He spent 15 years at the Ritz Carlton. In 1947, the murals at the Carlyle paid for 18 months of his family’s room and board. He would own no property in New York.\n\nHe was an autodidact. Bemelmans dedicated himself to the craft of writing and drawing. He incarnated Nora Ephron’s credo that “everything was copy.” Moreover, everything was scenes to illustrate.\n\nThe forces that shaped Bemelmans, and the trajectory of his artistry, are chronicled in Bemelmans: The Life and Art of Madeline’s Creator, written by his grandson John Bemelmans Marciano. A pleasurable read, the countless illustrations affirm a joyous talent.\n\nAs Forbes reported, the curators of Bemelmans’ brand – John Bemelmans Marciano and his mother Barbara Bemelmans – have leveraged Bemelmans’ creative gifts into a family business now worth millions.\n\nIf there is a great deal of the personality of Bemelmans, as revealed in his writings and in his sublime illustrations, there is very little in the book that is personal.\n\nI want to contextualize the arc of Bemelmans’ days in France. In the case of Paris, the danger of it was financial and emotional dissolution.\n\nParis: La rue Gît-le-Cœur\n\nYearning for his own nest in Paris, Bemelmans, in the early 1950’s, found a penthouse on the Left Bank of the Seine on the Quai des Grands-Augustins at Rue 1 Git-le-Coeur.\n\nIn his illustrated memoir My Life in Art, Bemelmans wrote: “It was the color of cold salmon….It had a two-person elevator, a statue of Rodin in the entrance hall. and the top floors were furnished like a country home in Westchester.” He sketched the “sweeping panorama of the city” from the penthouse’s terrace.\n\nThe penthouse belonged to a friend, Alice Antoinette DeLamar (1895-1983), who inherited, at the age of 23, a massive fortune. Was ascribing the decor to a Westchester home a gesture of privacy? Actually, Alice DeLamar had a residence in Weston CT.\n\nThe luxury of the setting, and the glorious views, are revealed in photographs in The Manuscript Hunter, a website dedicated to documenting the life of Alice DeLamar.\n\nThe rue Git-le-Coeur is part of Beat Generation lore, as at No. 9 is the Beat Hotel that took in Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs, Gregory Corso, and Brion Gysin, among others.\n\nOn the Quai, a few paces down from 1 Git-le-Coeur, is La petite Ecluse des Grands-Augustins, a Bordelais wine bar that was, during my days on rue Dauphine, the mise en scène for intimate hours etched fiercely in memory.\n\nLa Colombe: A Bistro and a Home\n\nThere is a feeling Bemelmans had — I have had it myself— that living in Paris is inspiring, though it is not sufficient. You desire to possess something to achieve a sense of belonging there.\n\nIn 1953, something in Bemelmans responded to this need. He purchased a building on the north edge of L’Ile de la Cite on rue Colombe, the entrance facing onto the Quai des Fleurs.\n\n“It was precisely what I had been looking for—a lovely house, half palace, half ruin, an old house covered partly with vine,” Bemelmans wrote in My Life in Art. “It had a bistro on the ground floor frequented by clochards and a small garden in front in which people sat.”\n\nHis dream, vivid to the point of ecstasy, was to revel in an artistic, social and culinary existence amidst the glamour of Paris, all under one roof.\n\nIt was a building dilapidated by neglect, a financial sinkhole. Costs skyrocketed due to delays in acquiring construction permits, and to extensive renovations.\n\nThe most frustrating obstacle was the lack of sewer lines. There were no bathrooms. Bemelmans rigged up a taxi with doors designated “Mesdames” and “Messieurs” for transporting guests to relief nearby.\n\nBemelmans’ dream of entertaining Le Tout Paris, and its posh English-speaking counterpart, was destined to vanish. La Colombe closed after a few months. The building passed into the hands of Michel Valette (1928 – 2016) and his wife Beleine.\n\nThe Paris Murals: Rescued\n\nBemelmans decorated the walls of La Colombe with lively images of la bonne table. In contrast to fanciful images of animals posing as humans in Central Park on the walls at Bemelmans Bar in New York, the walls of La Colombe evoked the gaiety of les dîners en ville.\n\nA variation on the Paris frescoes appeared on the cover of The New Yorker – the magazine featured many covers by Bemelmans over the years – in June, 1954.\n\nIn October, 1954, Michel Valette and his wife Beleine opened La Colombe as a cabaret bistro. In 1962, there was a change in labor laws whereby artists were classified as employees. The social charges and taxes were onerous, forcing La Colombe, in 1964, to close down as a cabaret.\n\nFrom 1964 to 1985, La Colombe was a 3-star restaurant with Beleine Valette as chef. When the space was sold in 1985, Michel and Beleine preserved the frescoes of Bemelmans, placing them in storage. Michel Valette describes this rescue operation in his book, yet to be published.\n\nThe frescos would have passed from sight if not for the vigilance of Jane Bayard Curley, the curator of a 2014 exhibition at New York Historical Society: “Madeline in New York: The Art of Ludwig Bemelmans.”\n\nThe year: 2012. How Jane must have trembled with pure excitement, like finding a precious jewel in an old drawer, when, at a public auction, she discovered five frescoes of Bemelmans from La Colombe.\n\nJane’s heightened sensitivity to Bemelmans’ artistry was shared by the fervid art collectors Charles and Deborah Royce. The frescoes underwent a six-month restoration at the Center Art Studio in New York where conservators restored the original vibrant brushwork.\n\nIt was to the Ocean House Hotel in Watch Hill, Rhode Island, that Charles and Deborah Royce joined the La Colombe murals with 21 illustrations of Bemelmans, as well as two panels, from a total of fifteen, that were originally commissioned by Aristotle Onassis in 1953 for the playroom of Onassis’s yacht Christina O.\n\nAt the Ocean House Hotel, you have the satisfaction of knowing that, despite any misfortunes, these delightful artistic creations were fated to reside in a common space.\n\nLudwig Bemelmans Enraptured\n\nIn My Life in Art, Bemelmans’ elaboration on how he found La Colombe is incompatible with a someone of his station in high society. After several interchanges with Bemelmans, a clochard (a vagrant) leads him to the decrepit property.\n\nMichel Valette provided me with some nuance. Bemelman’s decision to sell La Colombe, at what Valette referred to as a bargain basement price, was precipitated by a désespoir d’amour – the lose of a love object that shattered all hope and all joy.\n\nIn retrospect, it was this younger woman who had led Bemelmans to La Colombe. The entire project was a grand romantic adventure. It was out of that excitement, finding love where he thought there had been none, that Bemelmans envisioned a rhapsodic passage to a new life.\n\nHe must have had the sensation that Hemingway felt it in the Sun Also Rises: “of things coming that you could not prevent happening.” That Bemelmans would never arouse her love in return was a discovery that made the sale of La Colombe unavoidably poignant.\n\nHer name was Régine, according to Jane Bayard Curley. Worse still, Jane messaged me, was the suitor that Régine eloped with: Henry Freund, the younger brother of Bemelmans’ wife. Shattering.\n\nIn escaping emotional and financial ruin, Bemelmans was emboldened by the company of Count Amand. By 1957, when they passed time together at the artist’s studio outside of Paris, Bemelmans was preparing for a one-man show of his oil paintings at the Galerie Durand-Ruel that fall. A new dawn, as a painter.\n\nArmand II de La Rochefoucauld\n\nAmong the French nobility, La Rochefoucauld is among the most illustrious families, their origins dating to the 10th and 11th centuries.\n\nThe Count Armand de La Rochefoucauld (1902-1995) befriended Ludwig Bemelmans in Paris in the late 1940’s. In The World of Bemelmans, published in 1955, Armand is identified as a habituée of the chic bistro Le Montana on the left bank, and an investor in a seedy bistro, Le Petit Balcon.\n\nAlthough single at the time, Armand had a son, Armand III, born in Lisbon in 1944, out of wedlock to Renée Brandt, whom he never married and whom never took a noble title.\n\nArmand was, as his son attested, un fétard, a man who was fond of drink, bars and clubs, and women, preferably vivacious.\n\nMichel Valette informed me that Armand was a bit louche, having made several appearances at La Colombe, in 1954, after Michel had reopened it as a cabaret.\n\nArmand had been engaged to Beverly, an American identified as Evelyn in The Woman of My Life. A strong current of emotion passed through them, a profound attraction. She marked him with an indissoluble appreciation for high tone women whose langue maternelle was English.\n\nA cocktail of beauty, ambition and wealth, Esther Millicent Clarke intoxicated Armand at first sight. Born to a British father and Japanese mother in Tokyo, interned by the Japanese in the Philippines at the outbreak of World War II after which time she emigrated to the United States. Divorced, Esther had been married to a rich Californian.\n\nThe youthful Esther, 35, came to Paris in 1956. Her daughter, Cheryl Nesbitt, attended a posh private school in Switzerland. At last, a beautiful woman who had seen more of the world than Armand, 54, had.\n\nShunning disfavor by Armand’s kin, they snuck off to Saanen, Switzerland where they wed on Feb. 5, 1957. A daughter Lise was born in 1958.\n\nThe year is 1957. In photographs with his close friend Ludwig Bemelmans at Ville D’Avray, Armand, now married, appears relaxed in a sport coat and tie. A catered lunch. A stroll along a pond.\n\nTheir turmoils were behind them. They appear at ease with life and drawn close to its essence.\n\nArmand had finally turned to a life in the tranquil broad wake of French nobility that he had envisioned. The seas had calmed. His course was fixed.\n\nArmand III – L’Enfant Terrible of French Nobility\n\nTurbulence of la première classe: Count Armand III de La Rochefoucauld lived on the lam, as a wanted man, in the 1990’s.\n\nA swindler extraordinaire, listed by Interpol in about 90 countries, he was convicted four times in several countries for passing fake travelers cheques and false identities.\n\nIn the states, Armand III’s notoriety would have spawned his own version of “Celebrity Aristocrat,” have had him on late night chat shows, and giving motivational speeches at addiction clinics.\n\nThe French harbour no such sentiments for royals. In 2015, police raided his property and discovered passports with a photo of Armand III in numerous false identities, 3,000 euros in his pocket, and more than 1 million in fake travelers cheques.\n\nDespite his protest that all this was vestiges of a former life, he was jailed. I imagine he was mouthing words of F. Scott Fitzgerald: “It’s happened to me before but never like this – so accidental – just when everything was going well.”\n\nAfter 14 months, he was freed without charges being filed. Upon his return, he learned that the court was confiscating his cherished classic cars: a 1952 Cadillac Eldorado, and a 1955 Buick that had been owned by Cary Grant.\n\nIt was a deep dormant wound, waiting to be evoked by opportunity, that led to his impossible behavior.\n\nThe resentment, he opined, of being declared a “bastard” at the age of twelve when his father, who never wed Armand III’s mother, Renée Brandt, married Esther Millicent Clarke.\n\nHe was barely 12. His family refused to acknowledge him in public. His grandfather deemed in his will for Armand III to remain childless so that his illegitimate birth would result in no heirs. His uncle became his paternal figure.\n\nA conjugal life arrived in 2007 when he married Anne Caroline Landal des Essars, 25 years his junior. They decamped to a manor house in Normandy.\n\nArmand III settled a score with his grandfather. He became a progéniteur: three daughters, the youngest was only ten days old when he was hauled off to la tôle (jail).\n\nIn interviews, he has a condescending casualness towards his persecutors, as if his transgressions were mere adolescent pranks.\n\nArmand III’s fashion style is “monogrammed slippers”: dated opulence, with a dash of decadence. Fragrance? My hunch: Guerlain’s Habit Rouge.\n\nHe is sustained indomitably by his wife Anne Caroline. I place his story here with the belief that he may have viewed, during his childhood, the gracious silhouette of Beverly. On March 23, I received an email from Armand III, who wrote:\n\nI very well remember Beverly. Beautiful woman, living rue de l’Université, ground floor, on the right. I even remember the furniture, very 1930/1940. I often pass by, asking myself what became of her. My father wasn’t “engaged” to her, but very much in love.\n\nThe Woman of My Life\n\nPublished in October, 1957, The Woman of My Life recounts the adventures of Armand, a French Duke, in his search for the love of his life.\n\nThe opening passage is a reverie to Evelyn, which fills an entire page in John Bemelmans Marciano’s book. However, this tribute could represent Bemelmans’ channeling his devotion for Régine.\n\nAlong the way, the Duke has to overcome a fear of women, and perhaps an inborn indifference to females. Towards the end of the book, he loses a woman, who was “the woman of his life,” to a younger suitor, a situation that mirrors his rejection by Régine.\n\nEvelyn, the American beauty, is the ever-present force who perseveres in her devotion. The narrative closes with Armand and Evelyn boarding a boat at Le Havre for America, a marriage to follow on board.\n\nJohn Bemelmans Marciano asserts that the book is “loosely based on the life of Armand de la Rouchefoucauld (sic). This strikes me as dubious. It’s more of an imaginative tribute to Armand, and to Beverly, inspired by common experiences.\n\nThe New York Times accorded The Woman of My Life cheerful praise.\n\nBeverly\n\nAmong the ephemera that my mother left in boxes, I discovered the book The Woman of My Life. Instantly, I recognized the author from evenings of merriment at Bemelmans Bar in my days, those endless days, in New York.\n\nI opened the book. Letters and cards fell to my feet. I felt a tinge of excitement. Fragments of an inner life revealed to me. Et voila, Beverly writes:\n\n“The Woman of My Life is about my Paris adventures (I am Evelyn) and Armand is my ex-fiancé.”\n\nBeverly was a dear friend of my mother at the time when they both performed at the Earl Carroll Theater.\n\nRadiant with ambition, savage with youth, and armed with beauty, they came to Hollywood full of brave illusions. They ran together, and ran away from men who were no good. The mobster Mickey Cohen, for one.\n\nBeverly was seductive, and at the same time untrusting, as life had already taught her some hard lessons. She had two young daughters to support, and, as a consequence, she devoted herself to men of a certain standing.\n\nHow she arrived in Paris in the early 1950’s is a mystery. She must have known that the move marked a turning point in her life, out of line with everything that had preceded it. According to Armand III, Beverly knew Esther Millicent Clarke prior to Esther’s marriage to Armand II.\n\nIn Paris, she reveled in hosting cocktails and dinners for American expats. She kept up with the gossip on celebrities in from New York and the coast.\n\nBeverly wasn’t into boozing coupled with venery of the Paris Review crowd, rituals that co-founder George Plimpton imported back to his native city. She did not hang out in cafés. Hers was a more serious world where her daughters, and love, were all consuming.\n\nArmand is a “gentleman.” She knows that there is real passion there, yet she realizes that whatever splendor she evokes in his heart is inadequate for him to become a father for her girls.\n\nIn 1957, there was trouble:\n\n“Well, I have had no luck. I married an Arabian prince in the Mosquée, but before we could have a civil marriage, he was sent off to prison for I don’t know how long. (Being one of the leaders of the rebellion.) And I’m told the marriage isn’t legal – I don’t know what to do.”\n\nThe truth is in the stars. They had lost their shimmer. I am confidant that Beverly regained their light again, incandescent as ever.\n\nThe Girls\n\nIt is Christmas, 1957. Her girls at the doorway to adulthood, eager to launch themselves into the world, and she, dangling, suspended in time. In Beverly’s own tender hand:\n\n“Delylle is 15 now and very pretty. She thinks she is Brigit Bardot for the moment. She is very French in her ways – but an Elvis Presley fan and did you know that the James Dean cult and Elvis Presley mania has crept into the continent.\n\n“Sharon is very lovely and serious. She has decided to study medicine and will enroll later La faculté de Médecine. She is now 17.”\n\nNote: Since publication of this article, Beverly revealed as Beverly McKie (née O’Brien), AKA O’Brien-Samana. Her daughters: Sharon Diane McKie and Delylle Ann McKie.\n\nParis: Le Dôme\n\nAn early evening in January last year, when an eerie calm draped over terror-weary Paris, I dined with an esteemed American attorney, of the art world, in the front room of Le Dôme in Montparnasse.\n\nSitting on a banquette, while the attentive waiter explained the wine list, a young woman walked in, and slipping out of an elegant black coat, looked back toward us, exposing an open face, warm, unhurried, her watery blonde hair brushing her soft features. I saw her smile.\n\nI flinched, and recognized her instantly: Beverly, at twenty-six, at the Earl Carroll Theater, fresh, vital, and totally unaware of what one day she would come to experience in Paris.\n\nI was plunged into panic trying to imagine what Beverly did become, and how her girls, Sharon and Delyelle, got on with their lives in Paris, or elsewhere.\n\nI thought of the city that lay all around me in dawn and darkness, the lights dancing off of the Seine. Down through the years, among the thousands of passive faces in the Metro, the expressions of wonder at vernissages and of joy at restaurants, did I gaze, uninformed, for a fleeting moment, at Beverly, Sharon or Delyelle?\n\nA sentimental notion. I yield to the remorseless truth: I came too late to the party. Paris holds secrets that it never unveils.\n\n##"
