        "text": "In print for over 35 years, Quest is the monthly journal of New York’s elite—covering their causes and careers, the passions that drive them, and the unions that unite them. Based in New York City, Quest encompasses The Hamptons, Palm Beach, Greenwich, and beyond. Known as a family magazine, Quest is equally devoted to shining a light on the glamour of past generations, and admiring the sun rising over a new one. Readers enjoy extensive coverage of “the rich and powerful” in today’s social scene, and are always delighted to reminisce over snapshots portraying their family and friends from yesteryear."
