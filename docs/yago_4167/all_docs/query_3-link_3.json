        "text": "I\n\nTravel Memoirs\n\nFOREWORD\n\nIN glancing through these notes, which cover a long series of oft-repeated visits to foreign countries, I find myself ashamed of being so little acquainted with the most interesting regions of my own native land. Yet how often have I resolved to take a trip to Jutland and a little detour to Bornholm, to admire the natural wonders of these places which I have heard and read so much about, but which, like Møns Klint,* no description–and scarcely the finest painting–can reproduce. I have only recently visited the latter, and confess that it not only appears unique of its kind but bears comparison with the most enchanting coasts of southern Italy.\n\nI must acknowledge the truth of our excellent Holberg’s words when, in his three epistles dealing with his travels abroad, he reproaches his contemporaries for their indifference to the curiosities which their homeland offers. But just as he undertook his journeys partly in order to learn and partly in order to see his works reproduced in foreign lands, and for that reason was not a landscape but a genre and historical painter, it may also serve my humble self as a consolation and an excuse that the métier in which I was called to work did not lead me to Jutland or Bornholm. But now, when I have ceased to compose ballets, which alternately fall into one of the above-mentioned categories of pictures, the landscape must attract me with greater force, and if my advanced age does not forbid me such excursions, I hope to make up for what I have hitherto neglected.\n\nAfter having led my readers through several of my study trips in the first and second parts of My Theatre Life, and having attempted to reproduce in my ballets a variety of pictures from reality as well as from fantasy, there now appear (since I have exchanged the stage for rural retirement) a host of episodes, personalities, and character traits which are all more or less connected with my artistic development and which, as they complete the description of my theatre life, might possibly interest not only theatre and ballet lovers but every perceptive observer of art and of the times.\n\nBERLIN (1836)\n\nTHE success which attended my first balletic attempts in a larger and broader genre evoked a laudatory response in a number of German papers. These reports came from travelers who with great delight had attended the performance of Faust and Valdemar. This caused me to contemplate the possibility of using our summer holiday to reproduce my compositions on the larger stages of the Continent, an undertaking that was zealously prompted by my friends here at home. Since I was already known in Berlin, where ballet as a scenic branch of art enjoyed universal favor and was especially patronized by King Frederick William III, I considered it fitting to begin with this city; and I cherished the hope of finding in my honorable colleagues, Balletmaster Hoguet and soloist Paul Taglioni, vigorous support for my enterprise.\n\nI was kindly and hospitably received by my fellow-artists as well as by Chief Intendant Herr von Redern. But experience had not yet taught me that once a terrain has been settled, occupation by a foreigner is reluctantly tolerated, be it for ever so short a time. They would have been delighted to see me appear as dancer and actor in the ballets that were currently in their repertoire, but they would hardly make room for my original compositions without the liveliest opposition. Besides, I saw only too clearly that my whole poetic and choreographic direction was not in accordance with the Berlin audience’s ideas of mimed representations. At this time they were presenting Hoguet’s most recent composition Der Polterabend. This was a sort of adaptation of Scribe’s Le plus heureux Jour de ma Vie, where, on the eve of the wedding, a number of festivities take place in the bride’s house with tableaux, dancing, and surprises of various kinds, the whole thing blended with domestic scenes and interrupted by a conflagration which brings the fire brigade rushing to the spot to sprinkle the bridegroom, a poor fish, who in his Sunday best becomes wet as a drowned rat!\n\nThis ballet, despite the richest variety, lacked both plot and meaning. But it was the favorite spectacle of the moment and the old King’s evening delight, which he never neglected. Consequently, for the present and perhaps for the future, there was nothing for me to do here, and I therefore contented myself with enjoying Berlin en amateur. I saw the city’s curiosities, visited Potsdam, and attended a number of performances at the Opera as well as the Playhouse. On the former stage, Henrietta Sontag (now Countess Rossi) guested with great bravura as Desdemona in Rossini’s Othello, and it was with real delight that I saw Charlotte von Hagn, as talented as she was pretty, in the comedy Der Ball zu Ellerbrunnen.\n\nFor the rest, I passed a couple of unusually pleasant weeks here and was not at all affected by the tedium which this large, magnificent city cannot shake off despite, or perhaps because of, its barracks and its military reviews. I delighted in attending the latter because of the excellent regimental bands, and had not the faintest suspicion of the bitterness which was one day to fill my soul at the injustice Prussia has inflicted upon Denmark.\n\nAlthough I had apparently failed to achieve the goal to which I had aspired, I derived one not unimportant benefit from this whirlwind tour. This was my encounter with a troupe of French players who were engaged by Royal patronage and performed under the direction of M. Delcour at the Schauspielhaus, alternating with the German drama. In the previous year there had been question of a guest appearance in Copenhagen, but nothing had come of it. Now the suggestion was renewed, especially since I could carry back information and a sure eyewitness account of the company’s excellent composition and superb ensemble. I succeeded in bringing the matter to a conclusion that was as favorable for Delcour as it was delightful to that part of the Copenhagen public which was knowledgeable in French. It was also most useful for our own dramatic personnel, who received a strong incentive to imitate this masterly teamwork.\n\nThe Royal Theatre was given over to French comedy from the eleventh to the thirty-first of August, 1836. And since people had still not tired of this rare enjoyment, they played several more times at the Vesterbro Theatre. Delcour, Francisque-Lallement, together with Mmes. Brice, Deschanel, and Lancestre, are mentioned with merited praise in Overskou’s Danske Skeuplads; but Messrs. Isidore, Marius, and Kime and the graceful Mlle. Edelin are also worthy of note, although they were not so outstanding as the former premiers sujets.\n\nTwo years later this same troupe appeared again, augmented by an outstanding leading man, M. Pechena, who became the ladies’ darling and contributed greatly to the ever increasing applause. Unfortunately, I was unable to attend these last performances, for I was just then preparing to leave on an excursion.\n\nLONDON AND PARIS (1838)\n\nAN Imperial visit (namely, that of Russia’s present autocrat, the Grand Duke Alexander,* then Heir Apparent, who on his first trip abroad was a guest in Copenhagen where he was festively received by Frederik VI and his Court) set the entire capital and its closest environs astir. A grand military review, with a considerably reinforced band, was held on the Slotsplads, and the gala performance which was prepared at the Royal Theatre kept the personnel busy during part of the summer holiday. The ballet Valdemar seemed to please the exalted guest, who had a diamond ring sent to me accompanied by a most flattering note. A brilliant Court ball was likewise promised but had to be canceled because the Grand Duke was taken ill. This kept him in Copenhagen longer than had been intended and interfered with so many well-laid plans.\n\nThe Theatre personnel, however, were given leave to disperse, and I used this opportunity to attend Queen Victoria’s coronation ceremonies in London. Unfortunately, I arrived a couple of days too late and enjoyed only the echo of all the festivities which had embellished the magnificent ceremony, whose splendor is said to have surpassed all description. But oddly enough the hero of the day was the French Ambassador, the old Duke of Dalmatia, Maréchal Soult! In the beginning, when there was talk of his mission, people had almost found it offensive of King Louis Philippe to let himself be represented by this famous general, who had fought against the English auxiliaries in Spain and inflicted a defeat on Wellington at Toulouse.† But The Times, London’s political oracle, approached the issue from the noblest side and pointed out to the public how lovely it would be to see two aged heroes like Soult and the Victor of Waterloo shaking hands as a symbol of the heartfelt understanding (entente cordiale) which now bound Great Britain and France to each other.\n\nPeople were not slow in grasping this interpretation, and the enormous crowds who thronged the road from St. James’s Palace to Westminster Abbey saluted with thunderous cries of “Marshal Soult forever!,” calling out to him “How do you do?” and almost neglecting the official cheer for the crowned “Maiden Queen” who had in her retinue not only Great Britain’s and the Continent’s most distinguished magnates, but also a selection of young princes from among whom she could choose a consort. Our handsome Prince Christian of Glücksburg too was on the list, and might have become another Prince George to a new Queen Anne, but Providence, whose decisions still lay veiled in a fateful future, had chosen him to one day adorn Denmark’s throne, and his mild and humane nature was, I dare say, better suited to our ways and customs than to rigid British Court etiquette. I received proof of this in London itself when, in his joy at meeting his dancing teacher, he took me into his carriage and drove me to his hotel to the great astonishment (aye, almost the scandalization) of his aristocratic cavaliers.\n\nI visited my old friends from my former stay, and did not neglect the house in Great Pultney Street where I had gone through a school which, hard as it was, had given me a useful experience. Mr. Court now lived alone, abandoned by his wife who had accompanied Miss Louisa out into the theatre world on the great Continent.\n\nOn the stage where I had danced ten years earlier I now encountered the two rivals, Marie Taglioni and Fanny Elssler. The former had just finished her engagement and was replaced by the latter, who captivated her public with a piquant bagatelle, La Cachucha, which she infused with a charm whose characteristics I have sought to describe in My Theatre Life, Part I.‡\n\nThe Italian Opera was just then in its fullest bloom: Rubini, Lablache, Tamburini, and Mmes. Grisi, Persiani, and Albertazzi performed, respectively, Don Octavio, Leporello, and Don Giovanni; Donna Anna, Zerlina, and Elvira in Mozart’s immortal masterwork which pleased the audience to such a degree that no less than eleven numbers were “encored,” i.e., demanded da capo–which even included the reawakening of the dead Commandant, who had to get up and sing again his dying part in the terzetta of the first scene of Act I. La Prova d’un Opera seria gave the ingenious Lablache the occasion to display his comic spirit and divert John Bull with some outbursts in broken English in the midst of the Italian recitatives. I also got to see a bit of ballet. But whether it was the weakness of the composition, or because I fancied my approach to be the only correct one, suffice it to say that my expectations were far from satisfied, and I was involuntarily seized with the fear that I would resemble actors and singers (both ladies and gentlemen) who return from their foreign travels firmly convinced that performances at home are far superior to those abroad, especially when given by themselves!\n\nOn a pleasure trip to Richmond, which is charmingly situated on the Thames, I witnessed the singular spectacle of a lay preacher, who from the opposite shore of the river delivered a sermon to Sunday guests assembled in the tea gardens and to the merry passengers on the pleasure boats. As has been said, he was one of the latter-day saints, who, with a stentorian voice that echoed from the old oak trees in the park, raged against the pleasure-seeking of the present day–which, God knows, is modest enough in England, since music, drama, and every public exhibition are strictly forbidden on Sundays and holy days. Some merry young chaps began to parody him, but now he really tasted blood and accompanied his shouts with gestures and kicks as if he would give a portrait of the Devil in his own person. It was almost a scene like that delivered by the Capuchin in Wallenstein’s Camp.\n\nRailroads were now to be found throughout England, the elegant stagecoaches with their stately horses and coachmen had disappeared, and one proceeded with furious speed from London to the various port cities, Dover, Brighton, and Folkestone. Nevertheless, competition between Channel steamers was so great at this time that for an extremely cheap price, one could not only come the shortest way across the Channel, but directly from London to Boulogne. Two stock companies continued to underbid each other until free passage was offered; but when one company gave lunch into the bargain, the other was forced to declare itself defeated and bankrupt.\n\nNow the normal rates were once more in effect, and thus I traveled to Boulogne and from thence to Paris, where I planned to meet with my pupil and ward, Ferdinand Hoppe, for whom I had secured a little travel stipend and a leave of absence for a year and a half, which he had used for a temporary engagement at the Vienna Opera and to appear in Paris, without any binding obligations however. At the same time, Lucile Grahn made her debut in a graceful pas de deux and won much applause. For a few months she had enjoyed the guidance of the skillful teacher Barrez, who advertised her as his pupil, and it is with a queer feeling that I have since seen her identified in Nordisk Conversations Lexicon as being a product of Larcher’s school, even though it is well known that from her tenth to her eighteenth year she enjoyed my careful teaching, and under my special direction performed her most outstanding roles at Copenhagen’s Royal Theatre.\n\nI was once again charged with being cicerone for Instructeur Nielsen, who was this time accompanied by his spirited wife, our unforgettable Anna Nielsen! Together we visited everything worth seeing both in and outside of Paris, but lingered most at the Théâtre Français, where Mlle. Mars, although already advanced in years, played Louise de Lignerolle and Célimène in Molière’s Misanthrope with perfect mastery, which was fully acknowledged by our Danish artiste. Still, we did not neglect the minor theatres, where Nielsen and I almost caused a scandal by our irrepressible laughter at the matchless comedy with which the vaudeville Moustache (after Paul de Kock) was performed.\n\nMy dear countrymen were delighted over everything that their short stay had offered. But the situation was completely different with Sweden’s greatest dramatic celebrity, Lars Hjortsberg. He came to Paris for the first time in his old age, and, as a veteran from the days of Gustav III, he found Frenchmen, Parisian life, and the theatre itself to be far below the ideal picture he had formed of France’s widely known capital. His basically prosaic son, who had recently married the young actress Mlle. Westerdahl (an aspiring talent with innate gifts but without much formal training), fully shared the old man’s opinions; and since all three were agreed in finding Paris tiresome, they spent most of their stay in their hotel rooms, playing vira [a card game] to while away the time.\n\nThe description I had given my countrymen of London and its glories induced them to venture a flying visit across the Channel, and I once again had to be their guide since none of them knew English. Therefore Nielsen, his wife, and Hoppe followed me to Boulogne and up the Thames, which could not but astound them with its swarm of ships, its enormous shipyards, and crowded steam vessels which with resounding cheers sailed past us by the score to land at Greenwich near the elegant tea gardens. We arrived in London only late in the evening, and since it was a rather long way to my old hotel in Leicester Square, en route I heard Nielsen repeatedly exclaim: “O, immortal London!”\n\nOur stay lasted only a few days, which we industriously spent in seeing St. Paul’s Cathedral, with the monuments to Nelson and many other famous warriors, and venerable Westminster Abbey from the time of Edward the Confessor, which was still adorned with the coronation decorations. But here we found ourselves especially pleased by Shakespeare’s, Garrick’s, and Mrs. Siddons’ sepulchral monuments, which were all the more precious to us theatre folk, as they bore witness to the honor and esteem which the dramatic art has maintained in free England.\n\nThe major theatres had vacation in summertime, but we nevertheless had the opportunity to attend a concert which was given for a charitable purpose at the Drury Lane, where Rubini delighted us with his wonderful voice. But what made this evening especially illustrious was the entrance into a box by Wellington and Soult! They were immediately perceived and the entire audience rose, those in the stalls standing on their seats. Kerchiefs of all colors were waved and thousands of voices, accompanied by the orchestra’s fanfares, joyously greeted the heroes with “Honour, Honour to the Braves!”\n\nThe historically remarkable Tower was likewise visited, and left behind mixed impressions: The Prisoners’ Towers, with memories of political victims who were led to their deaths on the scaffold through the arched gateway (The Traitor’s Gate)! The Crown Jewels, which twinkled like stars through the repository protected with iron latticework and, finally, the splendid Armory, where not only valuable collections of old and new weapons were symmetrically placed, but numerous victory trophies from land as well as sea battles were theatrically grouped–among others, one in memory of the Battle of Copenhagen in 1801. But here we discovered a curious thing: two six-pound bronze cannon which bore the date 1806 (consequently stemming from a campaign which the British–out of an easily understandable modesty–would prefer to have the rest of the world forget), were also included in the pyramid!* Nielsen forced me to call this ridiculous anachronism to the attention of the guard, who was dressed in the costume of a medieval halberdier; and, shrugging his shoulders, the man replied: “You will find several mistakes of that kind.”\n\nThe trip now turned homeward via Hamburg, where I met with the sorrowful news that whooping cough had carried off my infant son, Theodor, and as happily as I had set out from home, as sadly I now returned.\n\nSTOCKHOLM\n\nI have discussed my three years as Intendant for the Swedish stage at length in the second part of My Theatre Life. But abandoning for a moment descriptions of a scenic nature, I shall venture to give a brief sketch of the various impressions with which Sweden’s old capital has left me, both as a Dane and as a worshiper of the beautiful and the memorable.\n\nFrom time immemorial there has prevailed between Swedes and Danes a rivalry which has now, thanks to the spirit of the times and the evidence of common interests, been transformed into a noble contest. People have often tried to make comparisons between Stockholm and Copenhagen. But, apart from the partiality that every race has for its native land, one is confronted by the same dilemma as if one were to compare a brunette with a blonde, two beauties of highly different appearance. For the charm that Copenhagen possesses in her more regular streets and larger public squares is compensated for in Stockholm by its picturesque situation and its abundance of water, which separates the most important parts of the city. The expansion which Copenhagen has received in recent years by the destruction of the ramparts has deprived us of the few heights from whence one could enjoy a distant view; whereas Stockholm, in a number of spots, affords enchanting prospects such as few European cities are capable of offering.\n\nIt is true there is not to be found a museum of the same sort as Thorvaldsen’s, nor such precious collections as those contained in the Prince’s Palace and lovely Rosenborg; but in return, Stockholm has an Academy for Swedish Language and Literature and a second Academy for the art of music in its entirety. In addition, its National Museum contains invaluable treasures of art as well as historical relics.\n\nCopenhagen has an unmistakable advantage in the presence of a University, which unconsciously affects the rest of the population by its Attic salt, without the students forming a predominant group, as is the case at Uppsala and Lund. Although the military class is numerously represented in Stockholm, one misses the stimulating element of the navy, which has its seat in Karlskrona. But as a substitute for the fleet of warships they have an enormous number of larger and smaller steamships that pass one another in every direction and produce at sea a kind of bustle like that which we find in the streets of Copenhagen. On the whole, the Stockholmers are not industrious walkers; for oddly enough, though Sweden is not lacking in granite, the streets are mostly paved with small pebbles which are a real torture for pedestrians. A trip to nearby Djurgården is therefore most frequently undertaken by water. This delightful oak forest, praised in song by the unique Bellman, offers an inevitable contrast to our Dyrehave. And indeed, one is uncertain as to which of them to give the prize; for while we Danes emphasize our leafy beech woods, our blooming hawthorn, and the numerous herds of hart stag and roe deer, the Swedes point out the fjords and creeks that cut in among the wood-clad hills and every moment provide a lively prospect of the ships sailing by.\n\nAt a crossroads, in the midst of a circle of the most varied kinds of trees, stands a granite base with the bust of Bellman cast in bronze after Byström’s model; unfortunately, more like a half-drunken faun with a garland of vine leaves about his head than the singer of ironic songs in praise of Bacchus and the enthusiastic worshiper of beautiful nature. On an appointed summer day, from the splendid restaurant at Hasselbacken, where a centuries-old oak tree bears Bellman’s name, a procession of merry members of a fraternal order strolls to this place of pilgrimage to pay homage to the poet’s memory with banners whose emblems in no way correspond to our conception of the spirit that pervades the singular tones of those dithyrambs.\n\nThis festival, like so many others, is celebrated with grand libations; for it must be granted our Nordic brethren that every single one of them can tolerate a larger quantity of drink than three of our countrymen put together. In this connection it has struck me more than once when people complain that Sweden is a lean and poverty-stricken country unable to reward art according to its deserts, especially so far as the theatre is concerned, that if they were to reduce the yearly consumption of arrack, wine, and the customary Svenske Sup to one-half of the usual abundance, without causing undue privation a handsome allowance could be granted to the theatre and the other liberal arts and an armored ship built every other year from the accumulated capital. If one adds to this the numberless opportunities that are sought and furnished for parties and large banquets, it is plain to see that in such areas Sweden displays a luxury which is not to be found in any other country.\n\nStockholm and its closest environs contain historical memories of great importance, some of them even belonging to the darkest drama. When one steps ashore at Riddarholms Brygga, one immediately perceives a colossal edifice without any architectural character. This is Kungshuset, where nowadays the colleges of government have their seat, but where Charles XII resided after the burning of the old Trekrona Slott from whose tower Sten Sture’s heroic widow Christina Gyllenstjerna defied the advancing Danes, and from whose burning stairs the body of Charles XI was carried down from his “lit de parade”!\n\nAt Riddarholmenstorg a statue of Birger Jarl, the founder of Stockholm, stands opposite the church which in his time belonged to the Gray Friars’ cloister but which later became the shrine of the Royal graves. Here were laid the earthly remains of the great Gustavus Adolphus and the knightly Charles XII, both fallen in battle, and with the suspicion of assassination–highly unwarranted, I dare say, for only a few years ago Charles’ skull was discovered and they found that the bullet which had pierced it was of a caliber that only a rampart gun and not a pistol could have fired. Here the hand of Fate was present rather than that of a traitor. It was a different matter with Gustav III, who had also heard the whistle of bullets on both land and sea, but was to fall before a fanatic assassin’s blow amidst a crowd of merrymakers.\n\nSeveral other famous heroic kings of the Vasa family rest here in their marble sarcophagi, and beneath the arches hang hundreds of embroidered banners and standards whose colors and emblems have been blanched and dimmed by time, but which bear witness to a brilliant martial history, rich in great exploits. Only a few years ago there stood between each of the pillars of the church a steel-clad equestrian statue with armor which was said to have once belonged to several of Sweden’s kings, among them the Danish monarchs of the Kalmar Union, Christian I, Johan I, Christjern II! The most priceless of these harnesses was that of Charles IX, artfully executed by Benvenuto Cellini. These curiosities are now housed in the National Museum.\n\nAcross Munkebron, the road leads into the real city, the old Stockholm, where the eye first meets the goodly Riddarhuset, in front of which the excellent statute of Sweden’s liberator Gustavus Vasa appears in an awe-inspiring attitude (a glorious composition by the French sculptor Larchevesque, who was summoned to the North at the same time as Sally and Falconet). One now wanders through small and crooked streets, past long dark and dank alleys, and arrives at Stortorget, a comparatively small square, from whose Town Hall balcony a Danish king once ordered the Stockholm Bloodbath–which, in spite of equally numerous executions under the sons of Vasa, has never been forgotten by the inhabitants of Stockholm. Down to the tiniest child, they could show us the gutters from which the blood flowed down into the streets lying below.\n\nWe shall turn our eyes away from this nook of terror and proceed to the nearby Storkyrka, a magnificent house of worship, whose choir has been entirely cut off in order to make room for the present Palace, which disturbs the religious harmony to a considerable degree. Here are to be found several large paintings by the German artist Klocker, who was honored by Charles XI with the name of Ehrenstrahl, and who has given us near the altar a representation of the Last Judgment, where the eye is involuntarily dazzled by a host of extraordinarily voluptuous female creatures who turn backward somersaults down into the fire and brimstone of Hell! Directly beneath the vaulting of the church hang (hardly to the edification of sensitive Norwegians) the helmet and spurs of their patron, St. Olaf–a relic of the great spoils from Trondheim Cathedral!\n\nWe now approach the Palace, which in size is inferior to our Christiansborg, but which carries off the prize as far as style and situation are concerned. From the imposing drive, the so-called Lejonbacke (where, according to legend, one lion is supposed to have lost its iron cannonball at the very moment Charles XII was killed before Frederiksteen), one overlooks the northern part of the city. This quarter, the newest and most elegant, is traversed in its whole length by Dronning and Regerings Gatorna, and is built upon the southern slope of Brunkebjerg, whose ominous name is linked to the bloody memories of a younger generation and which conjures up for us Danes memories of the battle where Christian I, after displaying the greatest personal valor, was forced to retreat before Sten Sture’s victorious host. Not far from the spot where the battle raged, there now stand the noble Gustavus Adolphus’ equestrian statue and the Opera House which the art-loving Gustav III consecrated to the Fatherland’s Muses, Patriis Musis. But farther to the right, where shady allées surround the statues of Charles XII and Charles XIII with Molin’s splendid fountain in their midst, there was, in olden days, a deep and open waterway that separated the hill from Blasieholmen, situated directly opposite to it. Here seven hundred Danish cavalrymen met death in the waves when the bridge, whose wooden supports had been sawn in half, gave way beneath the thundering of their horses’ hooves. This chasm is now filled in and presents a pleasant promenade past the lovely Museum, across the new railway bridge out to Skeppsholmen, whence one has on the right a prospect of the busy Norrbro, beneath whose arches the waters of Lake Mälaren plunge with tearing speed into the Saltsjo that forms Stockholm’s harbor. This magnificent bridge rests in the middle of the little island of Helgeandsholm, on whose outermost point, in the so-called Strömparterre, music and the clinking of glasses resound from tables occupied by the pleasure-loving public; while on the opposite side of the bridge the Royal Stables give echo of horses’ neighing on the very ground where King Birger’s and Merete’s son, the young Prince Magnus, had to die under the headsman’s axe! Directly in front of the spectator extends the harbor quay, with Logårdstrappan leading up to the Palace and the steep hill whereon stands the obelisk which Stockholm’s citizenry erected in honor of Gustav III, whose statue, in an attitude imitating that of the Apollo Belvedere, stands further down at the seaside. Here a vigorous commercial life is in motion, and this whole stretch undeniably belongs to the loveliest and liveliest part of the city. To the left, the sodra or southern city rises in the form of an amphitheatre, crowned by the dome of the Katarinakyrka. On the site whereon it is built the bodies of the numberless victims of the Stockholm Bloodbath were burnt.\n\nFrom this tragic scene it is but a few steps to one of the most wonderful panoramas any city in the world can offer: the view from the widely known Mosebacke! Here the spirit thrills and one might even sink into a poetic–not to say “divine”–ecstasy if the bustling waiters along with the clinking of cups, glasses, and the sound of bottles being uncorked did not remind one that this enchanting spot was farmed out as a barroom. Thus the most beautiful illusion is often disturbed by prosy reality, and it cannot be denied that the life of Stockholm as well as the Swedish national character produce a number of sharp contrasts. But however that may be, one must admit that Stockholm is an especially “trevlig” [pleasant] city, and if the words of the ballad can truthfully be applied to the Swedes:\n\nThis people is good to its core,\n\nAnd if you go toward them, they’ll come to you,\n\nAnd then you win more than halfway.\n\nMY ARTISTIC TRAVELS IN SWEDEN\n\nTHE reputation which the Danish Ballet School had been fortunate enough to acquire abroad gave the management of the Royal Theatre in Stockholm the idea of sending me time and again some of its finest pupils for further training.\n\nFirst in the series was the young Johansson, who after one year of diligent study had progressed so far that he successfully made his debut on our stage and, provided with a small repertoire, returned to Stockholm where he immediately acquired a prominent place as soloist. The hospitable reception he had enjoyed in Copenhagen, and the friendship he had consolidated with his Danish artistic colleagues, made him desirous of working with them at Stockholm’s Theatre. He therefore invited my best pupils, Ferdinand Hoppe, Caroline Fjeldsted, and Augusta Nielsen, to come up there in order to give a series of performances, under my direction, at the Opera Theatre. We took our chances and accepted his invitation without any official offer at all. He declared that we should be received with open arms, nor did he fail to keep his word.\n\nIn the last days of May 1839 we sailed for Stockholm (the young ladies accompanied by my wife). We traveled by way of Goteborg, my mother’s birthplace, which I regarded with special interest; and here, in a most amiable family circle, I discovered a wonderfully beautiful soprano, who, at my urging, was sent to Paris to be trained under the famous singing teacher García and later won a certain degree of celebrity, especially as a concert singer. This young lady was named Henriette Nissen!\n\nFrom thence the journey proceeded in the most agreeable company to the Gota Canal, past the Trollhattan, and through the great lakes until, after sailing for four days among the most picturesque regions, we reached the imposing entrance from Lake Malaren to Stockholm. We stepped ashore at Riddarholmen, where Johansson, surrounded by friendly comrades, met us and led us to our previously reserved lodgings. Only an hour after arrival, I was presented to the triumvirate of the Opera–Colonel Backman, Krigsraad Forsberg, and Secretary Schyberg–and an agreement was concluded on honorable terms. To great applause, we gave several divertissements, fragments from The Tyroleans, La Sylphide, and The Isle of Fantasy, and all of The Sleepwalker. But the climax in this series of performances was the “Fanny Elssler Cachucha” in which Mlle. Fjeldsted harvested curtain calls, flowers, and a number of romantic verses.\n\nIn addition to the satisfaction we derived from our onstage achievements, offstage we encountered a kindness and cordial hospitality which, as everyone knows, are characteristic of the Swedes. Instead of paying one’s respects to the journalists as in other countries, the editor and owner of Aftonbladet, Lars Hjerta, greeted us personally and not only sang our praises in his reviews but brought us into his family circle, where my wife and I cemented a friendship which, founded upon heartfelt sympathy, has continued to this day.\n\nA few words of recommendation from my noble patron, Adam Oehlenschläger, to the poet Baron Beskow procured us the acquaintance of this distinguished man, and through him a most interesting visit with the sculptor Bystrom. This fine artist lived in Stockholm in true Roman fashion and had built himself a marble villa with a breathtaking view on one of the heights at Djurgården. Because of our activity and numerous invitations, we got to see very little of Stockholm’s curiosities. But my wife heard a sermon by the great hymn writer Archbishop Wallin–one of his very last, I dare say, for at that time he was already suffering from his fatal illness. I, on the other hand, had the honor of meeting several times with the famous singer of Frithiof, Esaias Tegnér, but to little edification, unfortunately, since His Reverence carried on in extremely dissolute phrases and had apparently had a bit too much to drink. His Excellency, old Count Jakob Pontusson Delagardie, who had known my father from the happy Gustavian days, showed us most flattering attention and invited us to visit him at his estate in Skåne.\n\nThe Royal Family, including the Crown Princess Josephine’s sister, the Empress of Brazil, were frequent guests at the Theatre, but King Carl Johan was not to be lured thither. He had recently returned from Norway in a rather bad humor, and, grieving over the poor appreciation he believed to exist in the Swedish nation, it sometimes happened that when he approached the balcony window which faced the northern part of the city, he stretched out his clasped hands and cried out in a tormented voice: “Les ingrats!”\n\nOur ballet performances, which were as usual accompanied by a spoken drama, alternated every other evening with the opera Robert of Normandy, which was at that time a novelty in Stockholm’s Theatre. The role of Alice was performed by nineteen-year-old Jenny Lind with an inspiration and an already developed talent which aroused general attention and earned her the public’s undivided sympathy. Even then she possessed those qualities which later, enhanced by a greater technique, were to make her world-famous, especially the inexplicable ability to electrify her listeners by the power of her voice and to grasp both feeling and illusion through an extraordinary dramatic perception pervaded by psychic purity. Without suspecting the future celebrity that awaited her, she was at this time a pupil of the skillful singing teacher Berg, with a scanty beginning salary; and, in spite of the reputation which had preceded her to Göteborg, in this wealthy commercial city she was forced to reduce the highest ticket price for her concert from 48 to 32 skillings, since people had agreed to stay away if she insisted on the requested rixdollar!\n\nAmong the many proofs of kindness we received in hospitable Stockholm, I must mention first of all the comfortable haven we had in the parsonage of St. Jakob’s Church with the Pastor Primarius, Abraham Pettersson, who had known my wife from her earliest days in Landskrona and had given her away at our wedding in the Christiansborg Slotskirke. We were regarded by him and his amiable wife with a warmth and sympathy which shall always remain indelible among my travel memories.\n\nWith a farewell as flattering as it was enthusiastic, on the part of the public as well as our friends, we left Stockholm to give some well-attended and well-applauded performances in Göteborg with a talented trio from the dramatic stage (Almlöf, his wife, and the outstanding actress Fru Eriksson).\n\nOn the journey from Halland down to Skåne we visited, after repeated requests and friendly invitations, at Delagardie’s manor house, the delightful Löberöd, where we enjoyed a pleasant rest after the exertions of our artistic tour. Here as well as at Övedskloster, the home of Baron Ramel and his amiable wife (née Delagardie), the old Swedish aristocracy greeted us in a most urbane manner.\n\nEight years passed before I once again performed in Stockholm. In the meantime, we had given some performances in Malmö, and there enjoyed the same benevolent reception as in the capital. However, this time I brought with me a Swedish dancer, Mlle. Charlotte Norberg, who, like Johansson before her, had been sent down to Denmark to partake of my instruction and had developed her innate sylphlike lightness to a considerable degree of virtuosity. After having appeared with much applause in several of my compositions, and having rehearsed the role of Célèste in The Toreador, that of the Sylphide, and Margaretha in Faust, she returned to her native city, accompanied by me and two excellent assistants, our irreplaceable mimes Stramboe, Sr., and Andreas Füssel.\n\nOur undertaking, which was this time based upon an official engagement, was crowned with the most brilliant success. Mlle. Norberg reaped lively applause, and my talented colleagues increased their renown in the roles that were entrusted to their skills. As for myself, I assisted my pupils in all the bravura dances that we performed together, acted my Toreador with the usual effect, and passed for “a thousand devils” as Mephistopheles. But what surpassed anything I have experienced on any stage was my appearance as Bellman in The Polska at Gröna Lund. One can hardly imagine the kind of emotion that arose in the Swedish public when I came strolling into “Djurgården” with the lute slung over my shoulder. My resemblance to their favorite poet struck all of them with astonishment, and when I pulled off my coat, and in my shirtsleeves began to strum “Hvila vid denna källa,”* there burst forth a storm of applause mingled with tearful bravos. Bellman had come alive before his successors’ eyes, and it seemed as if the jubilation would never end. The vivacious Ulla Vinblad soon appeared, represented by the lovely Johanna Gillberg, and was received with cries of joy. Mollberg (Füssel) and Mowitz (Stramboe) were greeted as old familiars, and were followed by the whole company from Fredman’s Epistles. The Minuet and the Polska recalled favorite melodies, and “the fray” itself was reminiscent of the motley pictures. But the allegory with Cupid, Bacchus, the Graces, the Revelation of Anacreon, and the gods of Olympus led the audience to a more idealistic view of the great lyricist than that which had prevailed in Sweden for a number of years; and I heard it said that only in Denmark did they fully understand how to interpret Bellman from the truly poetic side.\n\nSome time later, this reversal of their conception of Bellman led to an extreme which aimed at portraying him as an elegist and discovering a deep melancholy in even his lightest dithyrambs! In place of the portrait which shows him in shirtsleeves, playing on his lute, they now brought forth another Bellman, enveloped in a traveling cloak, with his head resting on his hand! A popular writer had described his Muse as “Sorrow clad in rose color,” while his contemporaries well knew that his periodic despondency arose only out of momentary financial embarrassment. Suffice it to say that when in 1858 I once again presented the ballet on the Swedish stage and from the younger generation won a lively though less enthusiastic and thunderous applause than I had from the older one (upon whom I had made so strong an impression), the very critics who eleven years before thought that I had elevated the concept, now alleged that Bellman’s memory had been profaned!\n\nFor me, Stockholm was the same “trevlig” city it had been in 1839, and I found my loyal friends and honorary brothers unchanged. Carl Johan had now gone to his adoptive fathers in the burial vaults of Riddarholms Kyrka, and the art-loving Oscar I, gentle and popular, was now King. The Theatre was under the management of an oustanding director, Baron and General Postal Director Hugo Hamilton, to whom the Fatherland’s Muses had given the honor of being one of the first to strongly encourage native dramatic literature. However, the Theatre’s finances were on an extremely weak footing, and among other experiments to help these miserable conditions they had hit upon the idea of arranging the salaries of the actors and singers “på lott”; that is to say, they were allotted shares in the eventual proceeds rather than fixed salaries! Attendance during the 1846–1847 season had been very poor. The opera had long since lost Jenny Lind, who had been denied the modest salary of 3000 Rbd. banco (6000 francs), and the shares gave only poor prospects of realization, when our dancing reinforcements arrived at the end of the season and brought one full house after another. It was not without a certain bitter feeling that the “stars” in this dramatic and lyrical “partnership” had to acknowledge that this time the ballet had been responsible for the fact that “Lotterna” realized not only the normal proceeds, but even a small profit.\n\nThey were most anxious to secure a return engagement for the following spring. An agreement was concluded, Mlle. Gillberg was entrusted to my further instruction, and Napoli was readied for performance in Stockholm. But just about the time the journey was to take place, there occurred the great events which moved all Danes and made it impossible for me, in this feverish excitement, to abandon my threatened homeland. I immediately wrote Baron Hamilton in order to be released from the obligations I had contracted the previous year. He willingly agreed to this, and, since we were in the habit of corresponding in French, he asked if I might possibly furnish him with a frank circumstantial account of Copenhagen’s emotional climate and the Slesvig-Holsten revolt. I recounted my experiences for him as clearly as was possible in this tangled web of political questions, and received the reply that King Oscar had read my report and expressed his praise, saying that he did not receive such dispatches even from his diplomats.\n\nThis flattering statement was followed by a series of confidential communications on Hamilton’s part, all to the effect that Sweden would consider the crossing of the Eider as a casus belli and furnish strong help against any aggression from the German side! What halted this “élan” of Royal neighborliness is not easy for lay politicians to discover, but the result limited the promised contribution to the very shabbiest. Now whether Hamilton had gone too far in his zeal or had spoken all too frankly to Oscar, who had been his childhood playmate and schoolfellow, the result was that he submitted his resignation from both the Theatre and Postal Department and retired to his activity as owner of an ironworks and a member of the Rigsdag.\n\nAfter I had once again resumed my duties at the Danish Royal Theatre in the 1856–1857 season, and by the terms of my contract secured leaves of absence during April and May for a certain number of years, the new Director of the Swedish Theatre, Herr Hyltén-Cavalius, came to Copenhagen to confer with me about the establishment of a reading school for the ballet children similar to that which I had won for our dancing pupils, and at the same time to engage a soloist who could also serve as a kind of balletmaster. I recommended Sigurd Lund, who immediately received a favorable appointment. There was, however, the matter of providing a ballet repertoire, and to this end I was asked to stage several of my lighter compositions. Consequently I went up there in April, accompanied by my wife and a new Swedish pupil, Mlle. Jenny Hjorth.\n\nI had but weak forces with which to secure the ballet’s admittance to the Swedish stage, for Mlles. Norberg and Gillberg, upon whom I had been counting, were now Mmes. Tørner and Sundberg, and both were listed as “unavailable” for stage duty at this time. Fortunately there was a young dancer, Mlle. Arrhenius, a lovely talent, and a pair of secondes danseuses, who, together with Herr Lund and a young German, Theodor Marckl (who had for some time frequented my school in Copenhagen), constituted my main corps. With them I produced La Sylphide, The Festival in Albano, and Conservatoriet–all of which, oddly enough, came off with a certain rondeur and aplomb but survived only a few performances since the audience did not display a feeling for this type of art and, besides, allowed itself to be influenced by a somewhat less than benevolent press.\n\nTo this was added the fact that my old friend Nielsen, who the previous year had created a furor in Stockholm as a reciter, was this year engaged to appear in guest roles at Stora Theatern. In return for my having blown the horn for his eminent talent, he now spread the rumor that the ballet had been a cancer for the Danish Theatre; and such a testimony, although completely false, was not without a harmful effect on the outcome of my endeavors. The fact that the Danish stage had at that time lost several of its strongest pillars, artists as well as writers, could certainly not be blamed on the ballet. But the cancer which corroded Nielsen’s whole spiritual existence, despite all the gifts Our Lord had bestowed on him and notwithstanding the universal recognition and temporal advantages his great talent had procured for him, was his jealousy, which had degenerated into an almost ridiculous passion. Since he had not given definite promise of his coming, Cavalius had reached an agreement with another famous guest, namely, the Negro tragedian Ira Allridge,† who, like a vulgar copy of Edmund Kean, gave Othello and Shylock–in English, of course–while his fellow-actors spoke Swedish! But Nielsen, who to be sure had given his lovely Danish tongue a hint of a Scandinavian accent, did not find this black neighborliness fitting, and after a couple of performances of The Castle in Poitou broke with the management of the Opera and returned to Mindre Theatern, where he had reaped laurels and profits the previous year. Here the practical Director, Stjernström, gave him abundant opportunity to appear in his finest roles.\n\nThe nuptials of Crown Prince Oscar (the present King) and Princess Sophie of Nassau, upon the royal couple’s homecoming, furnished the opportunity for a gala, at which an occasional piece by the talented actor and writer Johan Jolin was performed. Since the Rigsdag was sitting at the same time, Cavalius chose this moment to obtain from “the Estates” a more abundant subsidy for the Royal Theatre. He had a ceremonious presentation arranged for the country’s deputies, using all the facilities of the Opera: the comptoirs, storehouses, schools, as well as the Library and Musical Archive. In the latter place, the score of an ancient opera, The Charitable Peasant, lay tossed aside as if by accident! Struck by the sight, a young member of the Rigsdag from Dalecarlia, who was strong as a horse and not particularly keen on expenditures for aesthetic pleasures, exclaimed: “Well, that’s easy to believe!” But when the learned political economists had been conducted to their seats in the stalls and filled the balcony, the curtain rose on a lyrical-dramatic Apropos that ended with an allegorical tableau depicting Svea sheltering Muses and Graces, while the four Estates of the realm were represented in the most glorious fashion. It goes without saying that here, as well as at the gala performance, I was assisted by the finest talents, and the zealous Director of the Theatre had the satisfaction of seeing the Rigsdag accept his proposal to double the annual subsidy.\n\nHyltén-Cavalius (the third to head the theatre since Hamilton’s retirement) was a man of noble mind and firm aesthetic principles. He possessed an extensive literary education and was, moreover, Scandinavian in the best sense of the word; for during his administration not only Swedish dramatic products but also a number of the finest Danish plays were performed to great applause and staged with artistic care. Unfortunately, the Stockholm audience demanded such a constant variety that it had to be continually furnished with novelties (often of rather inferior substance) from the German as well as the French repertoire. The opera, on the other hand, remains Stockholm’s favorite spectacle, and since in Sweden there is never any lack of beautiful voices, the musical portion usually gets its full deserts while the dramatic portion is usually treated with indifference.\n\nThe ballet, which had in earlier times enjoyed great favor and stood upon a respectable footing at the Swedish Theatre, now had the utmost difficulty in keeping afloat. Cavalius’ efforts to regain for it an honorable place among the other scenic branches of art were greeted by both the remaining personnel and a large part of the daily press with a dislike that was aired in the most bitter attacks against his administration as a whole. Nevertheless he still wished to venture several attempts in this area, and therefore reserved for himself my cooperation for the following spring.\n\nMy daughter Charlotte, whose irrepressible desire for the art of the stage, combined with a singular musical gift and a harmonious alto voice, seemed to portend a successful and honorable future in the theatrical field, had already decided upon this career. Since I did not feel entitled to oppose such a firm vocation, and also had my reasons for preferring to see her develop her talent abroad, I took her with me to Vienna and later to Milan, where she received her further training under the guidance of the finest masters. In Paris she appeared in a number of public concerts, to great applause; but it was in Stockholm that she first set foot upon the stage in Meyerbeer’s The Prophet, and by her performance of the important role of Fidès harvested not only thunderous applause but general recognition for her dramatic interpretation and superb rendering of the Swedish language.\n\nShe was immediately engaged for the 1857–1858 season and participated in the opera repertoire with several outstanding alto parts. Weber’s glorious Oberon, arranged after a text adapted from the French, was just about to go into rehearsal, when in April of 1858 I learnt that I was to undertake the arrangement of various dances and groupings in the same opera. At that time I had the pleasure of experiencing with what tragic intensity my daughter represented the tender mother in The Prophet and also received proofs of her many-sided talent by her humorous interpretation of the role of the slave Fatima, which singing part was superbly suited to her voice. One will perhaps object that in judgments having taste and sympathy as their object, even the artistically skilled father is incompetent where it concerns his beloved child. I have therefore confined myself to quoting simple facts which cannot be brushed aside and which both deserve and need to be recorded.\n\nSince my activity during this eleven-week season was divided between the instruction of pupils and the rehearsal of ballets, the latter did not progress as quickly as they had in the previous season. But since I once more had my prima donnas Mmes. Tørner and Sundberg at my disposal, the smaller compositions that I had presented were judged to be far better in the public’s taste, and Bellman, La Ventana, and The Prophecy of Love were received with lively approbation. The Kermesse in Bruges was fully rehearsed, but since the season was already far advanced, the ballet’s performance was postponed until the following season under Sigurd Lund’s direction. Since opera performances generally continued well into the month of June, special efforts were necessary to draw the public and it had therefore become the custom to summon foreign guests. This speculation had been successful with our ballet performances, but since these too were in need of lyric variety, the opera obtained reinforcements, usually from Vienna. The outstanding singer Alois Ander had enraptured the Stockholm audience for two summers, and in addition to his own considerable honorarium, earned the box office a handsome profit. But the golden days were gone, for neither the baritone Beck nor Frau Dustmann-Meyer was able to indemnify the management for the great expenditures these guest appearances entailed. This last lady gave Norma, Donna Anna, and Linda di Chamounix (in which role she was beautifully assisted by my daughter as Pierrotto) with much talent; but the memory of Jenny Lind stood in the way of her success, and both applause and attendance remained meager.\n\nThe same native talents that I have mentioned with deserved recognition in the second volume of My Theatre Life were already gracing the Swedish stage in 1857–1858. With regard to the spoken drama, Mindre Theatern, under Stjernstrom’s direction, gained control of public opinion, though, I dare say, most unjustly and hardly to the commendation of the prevailing taste, since Overskou’s The Devil’s Superior (adapted into The Vanquisher of the Evil One) excited the whole public and enjoyed over a hundred performances in a short time.\n\nA joyous celebration also took place during this springtime, heralded by the thundering of cannon. It was the first-born prince of the marriage concluded the previous year who now entered the world, and whose horoscope seemed to indicate a future king of the united kingdom of Sweden and Norway! Unfortunately, King Oscar I, whom I had seen and known in the fullness of his strength and beauty and with a look of intelligence, was now but a shadow of himself! Lethargic in both mind and body, he sat in the coach like a wax figure beside his consort, who was endowed with every feminine and royal virtue. With gentle pressure she moved his arm and head to return the greeting of his affectionate people, who bared their heads along the entire route to Djurgården, whither May Day called the Stockholmers to greet the approaching spring and “drink to put some marrow in the bones”–a ceremony conscientiously observed by high and low, each in his own way.\n\nWe did not, however, wish to leave “trevlig” Stockholm without having visited the lively “Leaf Market” at Munktorget in the neighborhood of Riddarholms Kyrka, on Midsummer Day. Here the newly sprouted birch tree plays a principal role, as does the fir tree at Christmas. Large and small Maypoles decorated with leaves, flowers, and gilt gewgaws are bought by the more or less well-to-do and presented to the poor, for every Swedish man and woman must have his door, his courtyard, his horse, his carriage, and his boat adorned with the fresh fronds of rebirth–the green birch boughs! On this day Stockholm resembles a large bower, and from the steamship, whose masts and yards were resplendent with the bounty of the woods, we too waved the green branches in farewell and thanks for all the kindness, friendship, and hospitality.\n\nTo those memories which my repeated visits in Stockholm’s capital have left me, I think I ought to add some features that I have not touched upon in the account of my “Three Years in Stockholm” (from October 1861 to June 1864) and which will perhaps be of some interest to my good readers.\n\nAs Intendant for the stage, I had a concurrent influence upon the acceptance of pieces and the casting of roles, while the actual theatre censorship was carried on by the Director, Baron v. Stedingk, and Hofintendant Hwasser. On the other hand, as far as the judgment of the composition itself and especially the practical staging aspects of the mise-en-scène were concerned, my voice carried no small weight. With regard to original Swedish pieces, dramatic literature was on a significant rise, and national dramas like Beskow’s Torkel Knutson, Børgesen’s Erik XIV, Blanche’s Engelbrecht, Hedberg’s Fru Martha and Day Waxes, together with Jolin’s Young Han’s Daughter, formed a repertoire that any stage would be proud to perform. In the face of such talented authors my critical opinion was out of the question, [and] the more so as these pieces had been accepted before I began my duties. All the same, Hedberg and Jolin willingly accepted my modest suggestions, and I had the great satisfaction, both as friend and experienced adviser, of contributing to the success which later attended their careers.\n\nIt was more difficult for me when, as so often happens, eccentric young characters decided to submit the first fruits of their dramatic productivity in the hope that their brain children would be accepted with acclamation. Then Messrs. Censors, to avoid the unpleasantness of passing a sentence of rejection, attempted to thrust the responsibility onto me by requesting that I dismiss the authors, either verbally or in writing.\n\nThese latter have generally treated the most bloodstained episodes of Sweden’s history and painted it in such thick and glaring colors that not only the customary instruments of murder are used, but the executioner’s axe set in motion to the point of excess; and in one of the submitted dramas, with such effect that by means of an ingenious machine the severed heads appeared to be rolling downstage toward the prompter’s box!\n\nThe youth of Charles XII as well as his campaigns have often been the subjects of more or less unsuccessful adaptations in dramatic form; and one of these, of which I had taken special notice, portrayed Swedish soldiers with gangrenous feet marching forward on the snow-covered plains of the Ukraine! To touch upon the aesthetic side of these dramatic monstrosities would have been more than daring of me, both as a Dane and as a ballet poet. I therefore confined myself to mentioning the difficulty of making such scenes lucid and, above all, of getting the public to follow along; and, as I tried to encourage young geniuses to continue their dramatic studies in order to later undertake the necessary corrections with calm self-criticism, I sometimes succeeded in easing the pain of disappointed expectations. Most of those unsuccessful dramatists gave up the difficult work begun, and just as in other countries, developed into didactic dramaturgists.\n\nHowever, I had my worst troubles with a fanatical Ritmester B––, who many years before had written a play called The Kalabalik, or Charles XII at Bender, which he continually submitted with every change of administration (such a thing occurred every fourth or fifth year). Each time, however, it had been returned with protest. In order to get his hero portrayed onstage he had gone in vain from one actor to another and had come at last to the comedian Sevelin, who excused himself on the ground of his genre, but offered, if it should be requested, to play Charles XIII!\n\nIn despair at all this opposition, he decided to translate his play into French, and then journeyed to Paris to get it performed. But first he turned to Scribe in order to hear his opinion. The famous playwright, in an especially polite and encouraging letter, referred him to the Opéra-Comique so that he might have the play adapted for the lyric stage. But there it was found to be better suited for the Théâtre de la Porte-Saint-Martin, which, even without the payment of royalties, would not dare to get involved in producing it. Finally, when I had been appointed Intendant for the Swedish stage, he renewed the assault, and The Kalabalik wended its way from the Theatre Chancellery down into my workroom. Like all the previous readers of the unfortunate manuscript, I too was forced to admit that the heroic Charles XII had been made into nothing more than a supernumerary role, surrounded by a mass of dull and tasteless episodes. One of the significant features was the burning of the headquarters at Bender, where the Swedish cavaliers ran about trying to extinguish the fire, but by mistake drew from a cask which instead of dampening augmented the fury of the blaze, whereby the act ended with the tutti line: “My God! it was brandy!”\n\nSince this Ritmester, so persecuted by Fate, had written me in quite lovely French and had in his letter enclosed Scribe’s flattering testimonial, it was all the easier for me to coat the bitter pill by pointing out to him in the same language that Charles XII was as little suited for scenic representation as Napoleon the Great, and that one would hardly be able to find a single actor tolerably fit to portray such an outstanding historical figure. The Ritmester was naturally furious, and had my French letter printed in one of the papers with a lot of sarcastic remarks about my aesthetic competence! At long last, however, he got his play performed at Sodra Theatern, with as complete a fiasco as could have been forseen.\n\nOne peculiar feature of Swedish society as a whole is the prevailing system of fraternal orders, which, with the exception of Freemasonry (whose public activity takes the form of charity on a grand scale), comprise over half a score of societies with partially secret bylaws; their ostensible goal is to promote fraternal communication and foster the spirit of chivalry and piety, which is the basis of the Swedish national character. These associations, whose half-mystical forms are so far removed from the Danes’ understanding of social and club life, nevertheless have an essential advantage and a particularly lovely side; namely, that of bringing the various social classes closer to one another than is the case in Denmark. Even though Sweden possesses an aristocracy of true historical significance, class distinction is reduced, at least in daily intercourse, to the common denominator of personal character without regard to station in life, and it was with astonishment that we discovered the use of the familiar “thou” on the most varied rungs of the social ladder. There sometimes arises confusion as to the sincerity and steadfastness of such sworn brotherhoods, since their meetings are frequently concluded with the clinking of cups. But I, together with countless others, have received satisfactory proofs of a loyalty that requires only an opportunity to be put to the most self-sacrificing test.\n\nThe fact that I found such brothers in the circle in which I traveled in my official capacity gives me pride and joy, and outside the theatrical domain I have also met with a sympathy and affection which I shall always bear in grateful memory. At the home of the well-known novelist August Blanche, who owned a house with a garden on the outskirts of the city, I often met with the writers Braun, Adlersparre (Albano), Carlén, and Bjurstén, all brothers of the Order of the Society P.B., into which I was also admitted by its unforgettable president, Westerstrand. My noble patron, Baron Beskow, honored me by inviting me every year on the anniversary of the founding of the Swedish Academy to the festive dinner that he, in the capacity of spokesman, gave for its eighteen members, among whom were to be found the writers Malmström and Strandborg (Talis Qualis), Bishop Franzén and Archbishop Reuterdal, Minister of State Manderstrom and several notables, as well as some members of the diplomatic corps and our Danish Ambassador Count W. Scheel-Plessen. All these names are now stricken from the Book of Life, but not the Book of Memory; and as in these lines I dedicate a modest wreath to their memory, I shall fulfill a sacred duty by singling out Count Scheel-Plessen as a man who in the most worthy manner represented Denmark to her neighboring kingdoms. Not only was he esteemed for the richness and magnificent hospitality which gave him superior influence above all the other accredited ministers, but for his loyal Danish spirit, which, although a Holsteiner and a Helstats man,‡ he preserved in a time so fateful for all of us. He was popular with rich and poor alike, and only abandoned his responsible post when the weakness of old age forced him to seek rest and peace on his estate.\n\nIt now remains for me to mention the favor I enjoyed from H. M. King Charles XV, whose amiable personality captured my heart. His all too short reign, which was marked by Sweden’s increasing prosperity and civilization as well as the important reform of the country’s internal representation, did not give him the opportunity for the great deeds that his lively spirit craved. He was not lacking in governmental wisdom, and his many-sided talent cultivated both art and poetry; but his mind and thought were, above all, concentrated upon exploits that could secure him a name among Sweden’s heroic kings, and his oft expressed wish, like that of Gustavus Adolphus, was to meet death upon a victorious battlefield! This favor was not to be granted him. He had interpreted the guarantee, which Sweden together with three Great Powers had entered into at the London Conference of 1852 for the ratification of the inviolability of the Danish monarchy, as a promise of an active defense for Denmark, which was troubled by the superior force of the enemy. His sympathy for the Danish cause was therefore both sincere and unselfish, leading him to resist the tempting suggestions for expansion made from several quarters. When in the heat of enthusiasm he promised the zealous Scandinavian, Magister Solman, to appear at the Eider with a 22,000-man Swedish army, as reinforcement for the fighting Danes, this was his firm intention, which was echoed by the greater part of the population; and at the musical soirées that were given at Court, he confided to the opera singers that “it’s going to blow up next week!”–so certain was he of his cause. But “next week” came, and with it War Minister Reüthersköld’s appearance in the Rigsdag with the explanation that an expeditionary army such as the one proposed required several months’ preparation, for neither army nor navy was fully equipped, and the mobilization of the army would require an immediate grant of 17,000,000 Rbd. in addition to a monthly allowance of 7,000,000 for salaries and maintenance! But in the face of these crushing figures, the most magnanimous intentions had to fall to the ground, and with folded arms and bleeding heart Sweden was forced to witness the violence and injustice that were inflicted upon the sorely tried neighboring country.\n\nDuring these months, so agonizing for me, I was witness to the feverish emotion that ran through the entire population. The news of the first conflict at Mysunde was received with jubilation, but the streets resounded with furious war-cries at the announcement concerning the desertion of the Dannevirke. However, in the face of the material impossibility, the most sincere volition was reduced to the fact that some courageous volunteers took up arms to participate in the Danes’ hopeless but honorable struggle.\n\nCHRISTIANA (1840)\n\nTHE mourning for Frederik VI had ended, and his paternal rule, based upon the principles of absolute monarchy, had given way to the breeze which blew in a liberal direction through the whole of Denmark upon the accession of Christian VIII. Unfortunately, the hope for a chartered constitution was disappointed, and the dissatisfaction which thereby erupted and was especially expressed in the press contributed in no small degree to embittering the King’s short reign.\n\nThese eight years* were also a time of flowering for Denmark, in both material and spiritual respects. Science, Art, and Freedom itself–within certain limits–had a warm and sincere friend in King Christian. The strict Court etiquette was loosed from its obsolete bonds, and the dazzling festivals to which the various classes of society were admitted were distinguished by the most pleasant atmosphere and the most tasteful arrangements. It has been said, not only by me but by every artist who in those days had something to do for the King, that a more knowledgeable and discriminating patron was not to be found.\n\nThe fact that I begin my account of an artistic journey to Norway with a bit of Danish history is essentially founded upon an encounter I had while sailing into Christiania Fjord with some “Ultra-Norwegian” students who, with no provocation on my part, began to make derogatory remarks about Denmark, the Danish people, and especially about our new Danish King! I tried to keep as cool a head as the circumstances permitted, and repudiated their unmotivated attacks with the clearest arguments I was able to present; but when their spokesman, a certain Candidate O––, asked me in a most naïve fashion: “Why we had not gotten a constitution like the Norwegian one,” I replied on the spur of the moment, without suspecting how dearly we ourselves were one day to pay for our free constitution: “If we could get it as cheaply as the Norwegians, we would have nothing against accepting it.” Now they all chimed in unison, “that they had gotten it with little or no effort,” and from now on we became faithful friends. Champagne was brought up on deck, and with a hearty skaal we drained a glass to the success of our theatrical venture.\n\nA few days later the above-mentioned Candidate appeared at my lodging and offered to present me to the poet Henrik Wergeland, in whom I found a friendly man and a loving père de famille instead of the fantast I had imagined. He received me with the most amiable hospitality and I spent an especially pleasant evening in his home. When leaving he pressed my hand, asking whether I really believed he was such a bear as his opponents made him out to be.\n\nBut it is high time I came to the real purpose of the trip; namely, a series of ballet performances at the Christiania Theatre together with the three talented pupils who the previous year had been a success in Stockholm. Some twaddlings, which are not worth mentioning in this chapter, reduced our quartet to a single couple–that is, Jomfru Fjeldsted and the author. We were accompanied by Edvard Helsted as orchestra leader and by my sister-in-law as chaperone for our young “sylphide.” They were a little surprised to see the expected company cut in half, and we had to modify our contract accordingly, so that the number of performances depended upon the public’s sympathy.\n\nEverything, however, surpassed expectation: lively applause and packed houses crowned our endeavors. We presented bravura and character dances, and I undertook the venture, with the willing assistance of the dramatic personnel, of staging both Soldier and Peasant and The Sleepwalker! It went remarkably well. The choreography and dramatic art joined hands in sisterly fashion, and, in addition, it was a pleasure to see our supernumeraries from the Akershus chasseurs participate in the most important moments of the action with commendable zeal and precision.\n\nThe splendid impression I received during my stay of Norway’s glorious scenery and characteristic folk life I have both described and extolled in the first two parts of My Theatre Life. But in the capital itself the old, historically curious Akershus inspires feelings of the most varied kind. Public attention at this time was focused mainly on two notorious, almost celebrated, master thieves, Ole Høiland and Jess Bårdsen, whose exploits were like something out of a Romantic novel. Every day, columns of chained convicts marched through the main streets leading from the fortress to the harbor, where among the bastions one noticed a most singular type of forced laborers, who, without irons and with regulation leather caps on their heads, wheeled pushcarts about under military guard. They were called “Crown laborers” and formed a tragicomic element amidst the misery of slavery. These were reckless chaps who in playing the Lothario had neglected to pay the necessary contribution toward the maintenance of their illegitimate children. This now had to be taken care of by means of compulsory day labor for six months at a time, during the milder seasons of the year, until the liquidation was complete.\n\nThe political and literary celebrities whose acquaintance I was fortunate enough to make through our dear countryman, the bookseller Johan Dahl, and who were at that time in the full force of their talents, have now for the most part gone to that rest where polemical rivalries no longer exist. They had not yet begun to assemble the various dialects into a so-called “national tongue,” and we delighted in seeing young Norway’s enthusiastic writers join the series of famous countrymen who had contributed so mightily to the development of a common language.\n\nAt that time Danish actors still formed the core of the Norwegian theatre personnel, and talents such as Jørgensen and his wife, Hagen, Mme. Schrumpf, and later on, Wilhelm Wiehe, Adolf Rosenkilde, and his wife, represented in a worthy manner both their art and the country which was once fraternally united to Norway in language and in outlook.\n\nITALY (1841)\n\nFOR what reasons and with what intentions I left Copenhagen in the spring of 1841 to set out upon an extended journey abroad, I have discussed in detail in the first part of My Theatre Life; and in the chapters “Napoli” and “Raphael,” I have attempted to describe the impressions I received at that time in Naples and Rome, where art, antiquity, and the Middle Ages confronted me at every step but where the folk life and beautiful scenery in particular captivated my imagination and restored to my mind the equilibrium I so sorely needed. There I gathered a host of living pictures that gradually unfolded in my memory and enriched my fantasy. But when I had discovered for myself that the same troubles which had hampered and embittered my work here at home would confront me at theatres abroad, on an even larger scale, I armed myself with a measure of philosophy and went home to my good Danish public, who joyously hailed my return and accorded my efforts a sympathy that convinced me that I had now entered into a new and more successful period.\n\nI had gathered abundant material for scenic adaptation and wished to bring as much variety as possible into my compositions, but neither subjects from the history of art, from classical antiquity or its mythology would find favor with the prevailing taste; whereas The Flower Festival in Genzano, Ponte Molle, and especially Napoli became favorite ballets because they reproduced the colorful folk life, transported those who were already seasoned travelers back to unforgettable days, and awakened in others the desire to visit those Hesperidean regions.\n\nHowever, considerable changes have taken place since 1841. The Italian scenery invariably remains the same; the wondrous creations of the Renaissance continue to arouse our admiration, while the mighty ruins from the time of our Redeemer emerge ever more clearly from the hiding places of the centuries; but the folk life has faded considerably with regard to manners and customs as well as costume. Progressing civilization, the influx of traveling foreigners, but above all the revolutions and their magnificent result, “Italian Unity,” have remarkably dimmed the distinctive and characteristic element which in all its motley confusion was so extraordinarily picturesque and, to a certain degree, “poetic.” But before we reach this more recent point in time, may I beg my good readers to accompany me a little of the way, via Hamburg, whose loveliest and liveliest quarters lay in ruins after the fire,* and where I embarked by night in order to sail at dawn on the English steamer. In Elbhavn, which was densely packed with ships, hymns resounded from the emigrants, while aboard our own vessel sailors in pitch darkness beat time to a merry “hornpipe” played on an invisible violin.\n\nIn the most desirable weather we crossed the unruffled North Sea on the same Countess of Lonsdale which had the year before carried Louis Napoléon from England to the fantastic Boulogne tour. I had myself put ashore at the delightful little city of Gravesend, whence the next forenoon I intended to take the London packet to the above-mentioned Boulogne. It happened to be Palm Sunday and spring was already in full bloom. Splashing about in a little boat on the Thames, I waited for the steamer that was to pick me up in passing but failed to turn up at the appointed time. My “waterman” grew restless and said that there must be “something wrong!” in London. He was not mistaken, for the ordinary packet had gone up in flames. Otherwise, there was “nothing amiss,” for an hour later a reserve steamer appeared, called “All right!,” and I and my portmanteau were hoisted up on deck, while the ship took off at tearing speed.\n\nLate that same evening I was in Paris, where I remained for several weeks, visiting my old friends, training with Vestris, laying plans for a future career, and studying Italian energetically. I had free admittance to performances as well as ballet rehearsals at the Opéra. Here I heard the celebrated new tenor Duprez (who replaced the unfortunate Nourrit but could in no way compensate for this eminent artist) and attended a rehearsal of Giselle,† where Théophile Gautier and Balletmaster Coralli shared the idea and the arrangement with the dancer Perrot, whose supposed wife, Carlotta Grisi, performed the title role with a perfection, in choreographic respects, the like of which was not to be found in any other ballerina; but in the area of “the poetry of grace” she was greatly inferior to Marie Taglioni.\n\nAt the musical soirées of the singing teacher García, I met my Goteborg discovery, his talented pupil Henriette Nissen, who in a year and a half of study had made remarkable progress and acquired great skill in technical respects; but I no longer found in her voice the silvery sound that had once astounded and moved me when her talent was still like an unpolished diamond. It had now been absorbed by a more artistic training.\n\nAt the same time, my friend and faithful colleague, Holger Paulli, arrived from his study trip to Vienna. He had come to learn what Paris had to offer in the area of music, and was especially pleased with the Conservatoire’s excellent concerts. We agreed to celebrate Easter at a Communion Service in the Lutheran church (Rue des Billettes). But the German sermon of preparation was so exceptionally stern and pressed so hard upon the doctrine of Original Sin, which placed all mankind in an alien and hostile relationship to God, that the solemn feeling left us and we decided to search our souls more thoroughly before we dared to approach the Lord’s table under such discouraging requirements.\n\nWith my French colleagues I enjoyed the most pleasant intercourse, and since I had decided to accompany my former pupil, M. Edouard, to Naples, where he had been engaged and I intended to make a guest appearance, I took part in a jovial farewell dinner where there unfolded a novel in the modern style. For a young seconde danseuse from the Opéra, Mlle. Albertine‡ by name, who harbored a violent passion for my rather phlegmatic young friend and had for his sake given up extremely valuable connections, was now to be kept in the dark as to the date of his departure. She regarded me with a suspicious eye, as the one whose advice had lured her lover away from her. The company parted after having drained numerous glasses to all the gods and goddesses of Olympus.\n\nThe following morning found Edouard and me sitting atop the diligence to Chalon-sur-Saône, from whence we traveled by steamship to Lyon (my father’s birthplace!) and, after a brief stay, farther down the picturesque Rhone, past the romantic cities of Tarascon, Avignon, and Beaucaire, to Arles. There we spent the night and used the following morning to view the ancient relics from the time of the Romans: the Amphitheatre (which was first converted into a fortress by the Saracens and later filled up with houses but finally restored to its original form by Napoleon I), the Temple Ruins, and the Elysian Fields, a burial place where among other Roman epitaphs I found one for a sister of Caius Marius!\n\nThat same evening we reached Marseilles, and were to depart from the famous seaport the next day. We did everything we could hastily manage to do to see as much as possible of the city. We visited the harbor, with the colorful commercial life resulting from its multinational ships, and also enjoyed an excursion to the rocky coast. To my surprise, I read upon a theatre poster that Mlle. Louisa,* the unfortunate flame of my fair youth, was engaged at the ballet, and since I was interested in meeting her again after the vicissitudes of fourteen years, I had myself taken to her residence to pay a polite and friendly visit. She, unfortunately, was not at home, but her mother received me in the more than humble dwelling. Here there could be found no trace of the splendor she had envisioned for herself in her fantastic dreams. But a cradle with a darling little baby girl served as an explanation of all that had happened, and without expressing my thoughts in words, the old woman and I understood each other perfectly. Nineteen years later, during a short stay in London, I learnt that there was a dancing mistress by the name of Madame Louise who lived in Lincoln’s Inn Street. I went there on the assumption that it might be my old dancing partner from the King’s Theatre (1827). Quite right! But only by her eyes and her sonorous voice could I recognize this worldling, who now sat like an old woman in a not very comfortable sitting room. Her portrait as a child in the impish role of Cupid hung upon the wall, just as it had in her parents’ home; now, however, smoky and covered with coal dust, like the rest of the surroundings. The meeting was, in fact, sad; but her face brightened when an outstandingly pretty young girl entered. It was her nineteen-year-old daughter, at the moment an aspiring actress at the Princess Theatre. We were introduced to each other, I as an old friend and fellow-artist, she with the remark that she was most proud and had firmly decided to marry a very rich man. Despite the sorrowful experiences of thirty-four years, the old illusions had cropped up again! I heaved a sigh, silently thanked God, and said good-bye forever.\n\nBut to return once more to 1841. We were just about to board the large steamship when we received the highly unwelcome news that Mlle. Albertine had arrived by post chaise and had already boarded the ship to accompany us to Naples. Edouard, who was usually so calm, flew into the most violent passion and wavered for a moment between breaking his engagement and returning to Paris or behaving as a complete stranger to his ruthless pursuer. The latter course was, naturally, preferred; but the resolution scarcely lasted longer than the same evening when, in the loveliest moonlight, we glided over the Mediterranean’s rippling surface where the phosphoresence flashed before the bow of the ship and beneath paddlewheels. While the reunited lovers privately (but with highly different feelings) settled their amorous accounts, I strolled up and down the deck in conversation with a young French cleric who, as vicar, was accompanying an older priest who good-naturedly and jovially remained at the richly decked table in the saloon.\n\nThe young man, on the other hand, was step by step entering the religious domain, and left no stone unturned in trying to convert me to the one saving Catholic faith, and especially to acceptance of the Pope as the rightful head of Christendom. At this time, there was still no talk of any solemn proclamation of the Virgin Mary as the Queen of Heaven nor of the infallibility of the Holy Father, although both propositions were included in the Roman Catholic creed. But Gregory XVI was a jovial old gentleman, who is said to have been fond of the juice of the grape and enjoyed reading the novels of Paul de Kock. He therefore did not bother to encumber the consciences of the faithful with reconsidered dogmas. All the same, I held valiantly to my evangelical Confirmation teachings and, while I respected the young priest’s convictions, I wished to retain my own. He certainly could not deny that I was close to what he called being “illuminé,” but it deeply hurt him that such an apparently good man should be lost to eternal salvation as a “hérétique” ! In spite of that we parted as good friends and turned in, each with his own convictions.\n\nWe were awakened upon entering the harbor at Genoa and were informed that the stopover would last six hours. We used the time to tour this curious city, guided by an old occasional waiter who many years before had been a garçon at Comestabile’s café in Copenhagen and now regaled me with morsels of Danish. We visited the splendid marble palaces on the Strada Nuova and, filled with historical memories from the time of the Dorias and the Brignolis, everywhere admired the art treasures and costly furnishings. In the Cathedral dell’Annunciata, above whose portal stands a written promise of a hundred days’ “indulgence” for everyone who enters the sanctuary, we were shown its golden treasure of sacred vessels and reliquaries, richly set with pearls, rubies, and diamonds. All of a sudden, I felt a light tap on my shoulder, and on turning around discovered my young tempter from the steamship. His eyes were glowing with excitement at all this magnificence and he addressed me with the following words: “What do you say now? Isn’t it a wonderful religion?” I had to admit he was right as far as the outward display was concerned. But he got no further with me, and left with a sigh, abandoning me to perdition, or in the mildest case, to a severe overhauling in the cleansing flames of Purgatory.\n\nThe lower and upper city are separated by a deep rock chasm, over which a bridge or viaduct leads to the Church of the Madonna di Cavignano, whose cupola and situation are highly reminiscent of Stockholm’s Katarinakyrka på söder. But uppermost lies the Citadel, which, with its yawning cannon mouths, is designed to keep the revolutionary tendencies of the Genoese in check. Mlle. Albertine followed us everywhere, hanging upon her Edouard’s arm, and presented such a living picture of les inséparables that we barely managed to get rid of her when we wished to take a swim in the salty waves of the Mediterranean.\n\nThe steamer’s bell called us aboard to a well-served dinner. We put off from shore and stood out beyond the little Sardinian fleet and nearby sea forts. We stayed in sight of the coast until darkness fell, and after a gentle night’s sailing, early in the morning reached Livorno, where everything in the harbor bespoke the busiest commercial activity. In this quite pretty and populous city there did not appear to be any special dividends for tourists with an appetite for art and poetry. But since we had eight hours’ shore leave, we seized this opportunity to visit ancient and famous Pisa.\n\nAlbertine, who was not exactly mad about antiquities, stayed behind in Livorno together with her “ami enchaîné,” who consoled himself by practicing and putting himself en train for his debut in Naples. I joined several of the steamer’s passengers in hiring a veturin, and through a countryside that resembled a series of fruitful gardens we drove to the old city, which lies about a [Danish] mile and a half from Livorno and is traversed by the River Arno, which for twelve centuries was navigable all the way to the sea. By this route the Pisan fleet guided the Crusaders’ army to the coast of Syria. This was in Pisa’s prime, when as an independent republic it rivaled Genoa’s might. Now it is quiet and, in relation to the city’s size, rather empty. Of the proud memories of the past only the University, with Galileo’s renown, and the splendid marble buildings of the churches and palaces remain. Among these, it is chiefly the Cathedral’s quadruple complex that arrests the traveler’s attention, together with a little jewel: the Church of the Madonna della Spina, by the banks of the Arno.\n\nInnumerable travel descriptions have discussed in detail the Cathedral, with its splendid chapels adorned with pictures and its roof beams made of cedar trees from Lebanon; the Baptistry with its marble font, wherein baptism was formerly given by immersion; the Campo Santo, the curious burial place surrounded by arcades in which are to be found frescoes by the famous masters of the Renaissance (the soil in this Garden of the Dead is said to have been brought as ballast in the transport ships returning from the Holy Land in the time of the Crusaders); and finally, the Leaning Tower, familiar from all pictorial works, which is thirty ells higher than our Round Tower and tilts about fifteen feet from southwest to northeast!\n\nIt is still uncertain whether the master builders of the twelfth century might actually have had the bizarre idea of erecting such a splendid monument in so unfortunate and threatening a position, reckoning its midpoint and center of gravity so accurately that it could defy the stress of time and tempest; or if the soil has gradually yielded to the enormous mass of stone, which had probably not been reinforced with pilework or built with any more solid a foundation than that, for example, of the Asinelli and Garisendi towers in Bologna and La Ghirlendaja in Modena, all of which tilt to a certain degree. Suffice it to say that on ascending to the observation platform, I found the Tower’s core and gangway or spiral staircase so lopsided that I was seized with an unpleasant vertigo. For the rest, I will refer my good readers to the aforementioned travel descriptions to obtain a fuller account of Pisa than the one which I, by such a fleeting visit, have been able to present.\n\nWe steamed out of port that evening to moor at the quay of Civitavecchia. I simply had to go ashore in order to discover, if possible, the ruins of a Roman aqueduct from the time of Trajan, but I failed to ask how long our stay in this port was to last. I therefore took my time, just as in Genoa and Livorno, and strolled out to the fortifications where I chatted a bit with the Papal soldiers…. All of a sudden, I heard the cry “Il vapore! Il vapore!” and saw the smoke from the departing steamer! I rushed down to the harbor, where I was met with terrified shrieking and gesticulation! Several crazy marinari, with eyes flashing beneath their Phrygian caps, offered to row me out to overtake the ship. I had my doubts, but they forced me down into the boat and “a Brio!” they pulled out with violent strokes.\n\nI had no idea how they could possibly achieve any results, but I soon perceived that we were taking a shortcut over the ground that the steamer, because of a longer turn, had to avoid. Hope dawned anew. But about halfway out to the ship my guides suddenly demanded their pay. I readily produced a five-franc piece … “Aah!” But with long faces they dropped their oars. “Ten francs, or back to Civitavecchia!” It was now truly a case of “out that way or out the window.” A louis d’or changed hands on the thwart, and they set off again with chanties and vigorous strokes. In the meantime, the Captain had discovered us and ordered the engine stopped. We reached the ship to the great delight of my traveling companions, and as I received a gentle but well-deserved reprimand from the Captain, he ironically remarked that I was the first traveler to linger behind in wretched Civitavecchia!\n\nIn the first part of My Theatre Life I have spoken with all the life and warmth that flowed from my pen of the wondrously beautiful entry into Naples and of the impressions I received from the folk life and everything that this city and its environs have to offer. Therefore I now have only to relate those minor episodes attached to my guest appearance at the Teatro San Carlo and to the pleasant intercourse I enjoyed with my fellow-artists and countrymen during my six weeks’ stay.\n\nThe San Carlo is considered the largest theatre in Europe. But although it is a regal edifice and, like our Theatre, bears the title of “Royal,” it has been handed over to private enterprise and engages its personnel on a seasonal basis. Despite the fact that the drama certainly labored under oppressive clerical censorship, at this time both opera and ballet shone on the aforesaid stage; and while Mercadante elevated music to an honorable place by his magnificent compositions, choreography and the mimed drama possessed an outstanding master in Salvatore Taglioni, successor to the worthy Gioja.\n\nAlmost every evening during May and June they gave the opera Belisario, in which Fraschini and Tamburlick (Danieli), together with the bass, Collini, performed the principal roles. The ballet Marco Visconti offered much excellence and gave the nondancing mimes Démathia and Bolognetti, as well as Signora Brioli, the opportunity to display their expressive acting. This was, to be sure, according to the same conventional gesticulation that my Italian predecessor, Galeotti, had used in his ballets but with a singular rhythmic effect that formed a method quite far removed from the natural.\n\nThe dances were in part performed by foreign artists, among them my friend Edouard and Mme. Saint-Roman. With both this lady and the balletmaster’s daughter, Mlle. Louise Taglioni, I danced my grand pas de deux from Valdemar and the bolero from The Toreador, both of which won lively applause with curtain calls, and great recognition on the part of my comrades. But since the Director had his complement of dancers he could not offer me an engagement for this season, though he did wish to make a deal for Carnival season next year. I could not give him a firm commitment and thus had to limit myself to these few guest appearances, at the end of which I completely gave myself up to the life of a tourist and the pleasantries of social intercourse.\n\nOur former Ambassador, Conferentsraad Voght, showed me the greatest kindness, and I passed many a happy evening at his villa in the neighborhood of Capo di Monte. There I often met an eighty-year-old Kammerjunker, Brockenhuus, who had lived in Naples since the days of Christian VII. What was a genuine treat for me, however, and an elevation in my oppressed state of mind, was my meeting with the poet H. P. Holst, who had taken up his abode on the isle of Ischia so as to be able to write his loveliest odes and stanzas in peace. He came to visit me in Naples, recited for me his poem “The Runes,” and invited me to share the delights of his locanda, run by the winegrower Vincenzo, in delightful Casamicciola. I accepted his invitation and spent eight unforgettable days in the most picturesque surroundings and in the midst of a family whose patriarchal naïveté and good nature reminded one of the long-gone golden age. Here the painter Marstrand and the musician Rung had once lived; the latter was remembered by the name of Don Enrico, just as Holst was called Don Giovanni, an ominous name of whose significance the good people had not the slightest idea, since they had never heard of either Mozart or his masterwork.\n\nIn my “Ischia Ballad” I have sung of how I traveled round the island with my excellent countryman and climbed the old extinct volcano, Epomeo, which has been renamed San Nicolo; and my poem “The Might of Runes” I improvised while riding up the mountain, penning the strophes on the pommel of my long-eared Pegasus.† But never has my vanity as a dancer been given such a jolt as on the day when our host’s pretty daughter Carolina and her brother Francesco played and sang a tarantella (for they did not dare to dance it out of fear of the priests’ anger). They had learnt from Holst that I was a famous ballerino and wished to see a proof of my art; but since neither the locale nor the costume allowed of any real performance, I engaged Holst in a gallopade which was done to the beat of the tarantella. We danced gaily about to the family’s great delight, and it was now asked how much a Maestro di Ballo such as I could earn as a yearly salary. When the reply was “About one thousand scudi,” Carolina clapped her hands together and called out to my honorable countryman: “Then how much shall you get?” In her eyes, Holst was evidently my choreographic superior!\n\nOn Ischia I had the patriotic pleasure of hearing our former Ambassador Voght’s name mentioned with blessings because of the help he had given the residents of Casamicciola when an earthquake had overthrown their houses. He just happened to own the lovely villa “La Sentinella,” which had remained unharmed. In Castellamare I had yet another delight in seeing the bathhouse “all’uso di Danimarca,” a memory from the time (which the old fishermen remembered very well) when as Prince, Christian VIII had stayed there with his beautiful consort.\n\nLetters recalled me to the bosom of my family and my old sphere of activity, which, compared to what I had seen on this trip, no longer appeared to me as thorny and thankless as it earlier had. I now bade a fond farewell to Ischia and Naples, to friends and well-wishers, to artistic brothers and sisters–and, lest I forget, Edouard and Albertine. The scenes that were continually called forth by her impetuosity and his coolness had gradually alienated me from their company. Her sudden departure from her duties with the ballet in Paris had led to a public inquiry and threats of a considerable fine. The police had demanded identification, whic"
