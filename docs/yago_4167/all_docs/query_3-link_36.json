        "text": "forty years younger than himself, and is, of course, although I believe absolutely without cause, horribly jealous.\"\n\n\"And the lady?\"\n\n\"The Countess is, I believe, in every way worthy of so good a man,\" he answered, a little drily. \"I think I heard her sing this evening.\"\n\n\"Yes, I daresay; she is very accomplished.\" After a few moments' silence he continued.\n\n\"I must not lose sight of you, for I should be sorry, when next you meet my friend Lord R----, that you had to tell him you had been pigeoned in Paris. A rich Englishman as you are, with so large a sum at his Paris bankers, young, gay, generous, a thousand ghouls and harpies will be contending who shall be the first to seize and devour you.\"\n\nAt this moment I received something like a jerk from the elbow of the gentleman at my right. It was an accidental jog, as he turned in his seat.\n\n\"On the honour of a soldier, there is no man's flesh in this company heals so fast as mine.\"\n\nThe tone in which this was spoken was harsh and stentorian, and almost made me bounce. I looked round and recognized the officer whose large white face had half scared me in the inn-yard, wiping his mouth furiously, and then with a gulp of Magon, he went on:\n\n\"No one! It's not blood; it is ichor! it's miracle! Set aside stature, thew, bone, and muscle -- set aside courage, and by all the angels of death, I'd fight a lion naked, and dash his teeth down his jaws with my fist, and flog him to death with his own tail! Set aside, I say, all those attributes, which I am allowed to possess, and I am worth six men in any campaign, for that one quality of healing as I do -- rip me up, punch me through, tear me to tatters with bomb-shells, and nature has me whole again, while your tailor would fine -- draw an old coat. Parbleu! gentlemen, if you saw me naked, you would laugh! Look at my hand, a sabre-cut across the palm, to the bone, to save my head, taken up with three stitches, and five days afterwards I was playing ball with an English general, a prisoner in Madrid, against the wall of the convent of the Santa Maria de la Castita! At Arcola, by the great devil himself! that was an action. Every man there, gentlemen, swallowed as much smoke in five minutes as would smother you all in this room! I received, at the same moment, two musket balls in the thighs, a grape shot through the calf of my leg, a lance through my left shoulder, a piece of a shrapnel in the left deltoid, a bayonet through the cartilage of my right ribs, a sabre-cut that carried away a pound of flesh from my chest, and the better part of a congreve rocket on my forehead. Pretty well, ha, ha! and all while you'd say bah! and in eight days and a half I was making a forced march, without shoes, and only one gaiter, the life and soul of my company, and as sound as a roach! \"\n\n\"Bravo! Bravissimo! Per Bacco! un gallant' uomo!\" exclaimed, in a martial ecstacy, a fat little Italian, who manufactured toothpicks and wicker cradles on the island of Notre Dame; \"your exploits shall resound through Europe! and the history of those wars should be written in your blood!\"\n\n\"Never mind! a trifle!\" exclaimed the soldier. \"At Ligny, the other day, where we smashed the Prussians into ten hundred thousand milliards of atoms, a bit of a shell cut me across the leg and opened an artery. It was spouting as high as the chimney, and in half a minute I had lost enough to fill a pitcher. I must have expired in another minute, if I had not whipped off my sash like a flash of lightning, tied it round my leg above the wound, whipt a bayonet out of the back of a dead Prussian, and passing it under, made a tourniquet of it with a couple of twists, and so stayed the hæmorrhage and saved my life. But, sacrebleu! gentlemen, I lost so much blood, I have been as pale as the bottom of a plate ever since. No matter. A trifle. Blood well spent, gentlemen.\" He applied himself now to his bottle of vin ordinaire.\n\nThe Marquis had closed his eyes, and looked resigned and disgusted, while all this was going on.\n\n\"Garçon,\" said the officer, for the first time speaking in a low tone over the back of his chair to the waiter; \"who came in that travelling carriage, dark yellow and black, that stands in the middle of the yard, with arms and supporters emblazoned on the door, and a red stork, as red as my facings?\"\n\nThe waiter could not say.\n\nThe eye of the eccentric officer, who had suddenly grown grim and serious, and seemed to have abandoned the general conversation to other people, lighted, as it were accidentally, on me.\n\n\"Pardon me, Monsieur,\" he said. \"Did I not see you examining the panel of that carriage at the same time that I did so, this evening? Can you tell me who arrived in it?\"\n\n\"I rather think the Count and Countess de St Alyre.\"\n\n\"And are they here, in the Belle Étoile?\" he asked.\n\n\"They have got apartments upstairs,\" I answered.\n\nHe started up, and half pushed his chair from the table. He quickly sat down again, and I could hear him sacré-ing and muttering to himself, and grinning and scowling. I could not tell whether he was alarmed or furious.\n\nI turned to say a word or two to the Marquis, but he was gone. Several other people had dropped out also, and the supper party soon broke up. Two or three substantial pieces of wood smouldered on the hearth, for the night had turned out chilly. I sat down by the fire in a great armchair of carved oak, with a marvellously high back that looked as old as the days of Henry IV.\n\n\"Garçon,\" said I, \"do you happen to know who that officer is?\"\n\n\"That is Colonel Gaillarde, Monsieur.\"\n\n\"Has he been often here?\"\n\n\"Once before, Monsieur, for a week; it is a year since.\"\n\n\"He is the palest man I ever saw.\"\n\n\"That is true, Monsieur; he has been often taken for a revenant.\"\n\n\"Can you give me a bottle of really good Burgundy?\"\n\n\"The best in France, Monsieur.\"\n\n\"Place it, and a glass by my side, on this table, if you please. I may sit here for half-an-hour.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Monsieur.\"\n\nI was very comfortable, the wine excellent, and my thoughts glowing and serene. \"Beautiful Countess! Beautiful Countess! shall we ever be better acquainted?\"\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE NAKED SWORD\n\nA MAN who has been posting all day long, and changing the air he breathes every half hour, who is well pleased with himself, and has nothing on earth to trouble him, and who sits alone by a fire in a comfortable chair after having eaten a hearty supper, may be pardoned if he takes an accidental nap.\n\nI had filled my fourth glass when I fell asleep. My head, I daresay, hung uncomfortably; and it is admitted that a variety of French dishes is not the most favourable precursor to pleasant dreams.\n\nI had a dream as I took mine ease in mine inn on this occasion. I fancied myself in a huge cathedral, without light, except from four tapers that stood at the corners of a raised platform hung with black, on which lay, draped also in black, what seemed to me the dead body of the Countess de St Alyre. The place seemed empty, it was cold, and I could see only (in the halo of the candles) a little way round.\n\nThe little I saw bore the character of Gothic gloom, and helped my fancy to shape and furnish the black void that yawned all round me. I heard a sound like the slow tread of two persons walking up the flagged aisle. A faint echo told of the vastness of the place. An awful sense of expectation was upon me, and I was horribly frightened when the body that lay on the catafalque said (without stirring), in a whisper that froze me, \"They come to place me in the grave alive; save me.\"\n\nI found that I could neither speak nor move. I was horribly frightened.\n\nThe two people who approached now emerged from the darkness. One, the Count de St Alyre, glided to the head of the figure and placed his long thin hands under it. The white-faced Colonel, with the scar across his face, and a look of infernal triumph, placed his hands under her feet, and they began to raise her.\n\nWith an indescribable effort I broke the spell that bound me, and started to my feet with a gasp.\n\nI was wide awake, but the broad, wicked face of Colonel Gaillarde was staring, white as death, at me from the other side of the hearth. \"Where is she?\" I shuddered.\n\n\"That depends on who she is, Monsieur,\" replied the Colonel, curtly.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" I gasped, looking about me.\n\nThe Colonel, who was eyeing me sarcastically, had had his demi-tasse of café noir, and now drank his tasse, diffusing a pleasant perfume of brandy.\n\n\"I fell asleep and was dreaming,\" I said, lest any strong language, founded on the rôle he played in my dream, should have escaped me. \"I did not know for some moments where I was.\"\n\n\"You are the young gentleman who has the apartments over the Count and Countess de St Alyre?\" he said, winking one eye, close in meditation, and glaring at me with the other.\n\n\"I believe so -- yes,\" I answered.\n\n\"Well, younker, take care you have not worse dreams than that some night,\" he said, enigmatically, and wagged his head with a chuckle. \"Worse dreams,\" he repeated.\n\n\"What does Monsieur the Colonel mean?\" I inquired.\n\n\"I am trying to find that out myself,\" said the Colonel; \"and I think I shall. When I get the first inch of the thread fast between my finger and thumb, it goes hard but I follow it up, bit by bit, little by little, tracing it this way and that, and up and down, and round about, until the whole clue is wound up on my thumb, and the end, and its secret, fast in my fingers. Ingenious! Crafty as five foxes! wide awake as a weazel! Parbleu! if I had descended to that occupation I should have made my fortune as a spy. Good wine here?\" he glanced interrogatively at my bottle.\n\n\"Very good,\" said I. \"Will Monsieur the Colonel try a glass?\"\n\nHe took the largest he could find, and filled it, raised it with a bow, and drank it slowly. \"Ah! ah! Bah! That is not it,\" he exclaimed, with some disgust, filling it again. \"You ought to have told me to order your Burgundy, and they would not have brought you that stuff.\"\n\nI got away from this man as soon as I civilly could, and, putting on my hat, I walked out with no other company than my sturdy walking-stick. I visited the inn-yard, and looked up to the windows of the Countess's apartments. They were closed, however, and I had not even the unsubstantial consolation of contemplating the light in which that beautiful lady was at that moment writing, or reading, or sitting and thinking of -- anyone you please.\n\nI bore this serious privation as well as I could, and took a little saunter through the town. I shan't bore you with moonlight effects, nor with the maunderings of a man who has fallen in love at first sight with a beautiful face. My ramble, it is enough to say, occupied about half an hour, and, returning by a slight détour, I found myself in a little square, with about two high gabled houses on each side, and a rude stone statue, worn by centuries of rain, on a pedestal in the centre of the pavement. Looking at this statue was a slight and rather tall man, whom I instantly recognized as the Marquis d'Harmonville: he knew me almost as quickly. He walked a step towards me, shrugged and laughed:\n\n\"You are surprised to find Monsieur Droqville staring at that old stone figure by moonlight. Anything to pass the time. You, I see, suffer from ennui, as I do. These little provincial towns! Heavens! what an effort it is to live in them! If I could regret having formed in early life a friendship that does me honour, I think its condemning me to a sojourn in such a place would make me do so. You go on towards Paris, I suppose, in the morning?\"\n\n\"I have ordered horses.\"\n\n\"As for me I await a letter, or an arrival, either would emancipate me; but I can't say how soon either event will happen.\"\n\n\"Can I be of any use in this matter?\" I began.\n\n\"None, Monsieur, I thank you a thousand times. No, this is a piece in which every rôle is already cast. I am but an amateur, and induced solely by friendship, to take a part.\"\n\nSo he talked on, for a time, as we walked slowly toward the Belle Étoile, and then came a silence, which I broke by asking him if he knew anything of Colonel Gaillarde.\n\n\"Oh! yes, to be sure. He is a little mad; he has had some bad injuries of the head. He used to plague the people in the War Office to death. He has always some delusion. They contrived some employment for him -- not regimental, of course -- but in this campaign Napoleon, who could spare nobody, placed him in command of a regiment. He was always a desperate fighter, and such men were more than ever needed.\"\n\nThere is, or was, a second inn in this town called l'Écu de France. At its door the Marquis stopped, bade me a mysterious good-night, and disappeared.\n\nAs I walked slowly toward my inn, I met, in the shadow of a row of poplars, the garçon who had brought me my Burgundy a little time ago. I was thinking of Colonel Gaillarde, and I stopped the little waiter as he passed me.\n\n\"You said, I think, that Colonel Gaillarde was at the Belle Étoile for a week at one time.\"\n\n\"Yes, Monsieur.\"\n\n\"Is he perfectly in his right mind?\"\n\nThe waiter stared. \"Perfectly, Monsieur.\"\n\n\"Has he been suspected at any time of being out of his mind?\"\n\n\"Never, Monsieur; he is a little noisy, but a very shrewd man.\"\n\n\"What is a fellow to think?\" I muttered, as I walked on.\n\nI was soon within sight of the lights of the Belle Étoile. A carriage, with four horses, stood in the moonlight at the door, and a furious altercation was going on in the hall, in which the yell of Colonel Gaillarde out-topped all other sounds.\n\nMost young men like, at least, to witness a row. But, intuitively, I felt that this would interest me in a very special manner. I had only fifty yards to run, when I found myself in the hall of the old inn. The principal actor in this strange drama was, indeed, the Colonel, who stood facing the old Count de St Alyre, who, in his travelling costume, with his black silk scarf covering the lower part of his face, confronted him; he had evidently been intercepted in an endeavour to reach his carriage. A little in the rear of the Count stood the Countess, also in travelling costume, with her thick black veil down, and holding in her delicate fingers a white rose. You can't conceive a more diabolical effigy of hate and fury than the Colonel; the knotted veins stood out on his forehead, his eyes were leaping from their sockets, he was grinding his teeth, and froth was on his lips. His sword was drawn in his hand, and he accompanied his yelling denunciations with stamps upon the floor and flourishes of his weapon in the air.\n\nThe host of the Belle Étoile was talking to the Colonel in soothing terms utterly thrown away. Two waiters, pale with fear, stared uselessly from behind. The Colonel screamed and thundered, and whirled his sword. \"I was not sure of your red birds of prey; I could not believe you would have the audacity to travel on high roads, and to stop at honest inns, and lie under the same roof with honest men. You! you! both -- vampires, wolves, ghouls. Summon the gendarmes, I say. By St Peter and all the devils, if either of you try to get out of that door I'll take your heads off.\"\n\nFor a moment I had stood aghast. Here was a situation! I walked up to the lady; she laid her hand wildly upon my arm. \"Oh! Monsieur,\" she whispered, in great agitation, \"that dreadful madman! What are we to do? He won't let us pass; he will kill my husband.\"\n\n\"Fear nothing, Madame,\" I answered, with romantic devotion, and stepping between the Count and Gaillarde, as he shrieked his invective, \"Hold your tongue, and clear the way, you ruffian, you bully, you coward!\" I roared.\n\nA faint cry escaped the lady, which more than repaid the risk I ran, as the sword of the frantic soldier, after a moment's astonished pause, flashed in the air to cut me down.\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nTHE WHITE ROSE\n\nI WAS too quick for Colonel Gaillarde. As he raised his sword, reckless of all consequences but my condign punishment and quite resolved to cleave me to the teeth, I struck him across the side of his head with my heavy stick, and while he staggered back I struck him another blow, nearly in the same place, that felled him to the floor, where he lay as if dead.\n\nI did not care one of his own regimental buttons, whether he was dead or not; I was, at that moment, carried away by such a tumult of delightful and diabolical emotions!\n\nI broke his sword under my foot, and flung the pieces across the street. The old Count de St Alyre skipped nimbly without looking to the right or left, or thanking anybody, over the floor, out of the door, down the steps, and into his carriage. Instantly I was at the side of the beautiful Countess, thus left to shift for herself; I offered her my arm, which she took, and I led her to the carriage. She entered, and I shut the door. All this without a word.\n\nI was about to ask if there were any commands with which she would honour me -- my hand was laid upon the lower edge of the window, which was open.\n\nThe lady's hand was laid upon mine timidly and excitedly. Her lips almost touched my cheek as she whispered hurriedly:\n\n\"I may never see you more, and, oh! that I could forget you. Go -- farewell -- for God's sake, go!\"\n\nI pressed her hand for a moment. She withdrew it, but tremblingly pressed into mine the rose which she had held in her fingers during the agitating scene she had just passed through.\n\nAll this took place while the Count was commanding, entreating, cursing his servants, tipsy, and out of the way during the crisis, my conscience afterwards insinuated, by my clever contrivance. They now mounted to their places with the agility of alarm. The postilions' whips cracked, the horses scrambled into a trot, and away rolled the carriage, with its precious freightage, along the quaint main street, in the moonlight, toward Paris.\n\nI stood on the pavement till it was quite lost to eye and ear in the distance.\n\nWith a deep sigh, I then turned, my white rose folded in my handkerchief -- the little parting gage -- the\n\nFavour secret, sweet, and precious,\n\nwhich no mortal eye but hers and mine had seen conveyed to me.\n\nThe care of the host of the Belle Étoile, and his assistants, had raised the wounded hero of a hundred fights partly against the wall, and propped him at each side with portmanteaus and pillows, and poured a glass of brandy, which was duly placed to his account, into his big mouth, where, for the first time, such a Godsend remained unswallowed.\n\nA bald-headed little military surgeon of sixty, with spectacles, who had cut off eighty-seven legs and arms to his own share, after the battle of Eylau, having retired with his sword and his saw, his laurels and his sticking-plaster to this, his native town, was called in, and rather thought the gallant Colonel's skull was fractured; at all events, there was concussion of the seat of thought, and quite enough work for his remarkable self-healing powers to occupy him for a fortnight.\n\nI began to grow a little uneasy. A disagreeable surprise, if my excursion, in which I was to break banks and hearts, and, as you see, heads, should end upon the gallows or the guillotine. I was not clear, in those times of political oscillation, which was the established apparatus.\n\nThe Colonel was conveyed, snorting apoplectically, to his room.\n\nI saw my host in the apartment in which we had supped. Wherever you employ a force of any sort, to carry a point of real importance, reject all nice calculations of economy. Better to be a thousand per cent. over the mark, than the smallest fraction of a unit under it. I instinctively felt this.\n\nI ordered a bottle of my landlord's very best wine; made him partake with me, in the proportion of two glasses to one; and then told him that he must not decline a trifling souvenir from a guest who had been so charmed with all he had seen of the renowned Belle Étoile. Thus saying, I placed five-and-thirty Napoleons in his hand: at touch of which his countenance, by no means encouraging before, grew sunny, his manners thawed, and it was plain, as he dropped the coins hastily into his pocket, that benevolent relations had been established between us.\n\nI immediately placed the Colonel's broken head upon the tapis. We both agreed that if I had not given him that rather smart tap of my walking-cane, he would have beheaded half the inmates of the Belle Étoile. There was not a waiter in the house who would not verify that statement on oath.\n\nThe reader may suppose that I had other motives, beside the desire to escape the tedious inquisition of the law, for desiring to recommence my journey to Paris with the least possible delay. Judge what was my horror then to learn that, for love or money, horses were nowhere to be had that night. The last pair in the town had been obtained from the Écu de France by a gentleman who dined and supped at the Belle Étoile, and was obliged to proceed to Paris that night.\n\nWho was the gentleman? Had he actually gone? Could he possibly be induced to wait till morning?\n\nThe gentleman was now upstairs getting his things together, and his name was Monsieur Droqville.\n\nI ran upstairs. I found my servant St Clair in my room. At sight of him, for a moment, my thoughts were turned into a different channel.\n\n\"Well, St Clair, tell me this moment who the lady is?\" I demanded.\n\n\"The lady is the daughter or wife, it matters not which, of the Count de St Alyre -- the old gentleman who was so near being sliced like a cucumber to-night, I am informed, by the sword of the general whom Monsieur, by a turn of fortune, has put to bed of an apoplexy.\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, fool! The man's beastly drunk -- he's sulking -- he could talk if he liked -- who cares? Pack up my things. Which are Monsieur Droqville's apartments?\"\n\nHe knew, of course; he always knew everything.\n\nHalf an hour later Monsieur Droqville and I were travelling towards Paris in my carriage and with his horses. I ventured to ask the Marquis d'Harmonville, in a little while, whether the lady, who accompanied the Count, was certainly the Countess. \"Has he not a daughter?\"\n\n\"Yes; I believe a very beautiful and charming young lady -- I cannot say -- it may have been she, his daughter by an earlier marriage. I saw only the Count himself to-day.\"\n\nThe Marquis was growing a little sleepy, and, in a little while, he actually fell asleep in his corner. I dozed and nodded; but the Marquis slept like a top. He awoke only for a minute or two at the next posting-house where he had fortunately secured horses by sending on his man, he told me. \"You will excuse my being so dull a companion,\" he said, \"but till to-night I have had but two hours' sleep, for more than sixty hours. I shall have a cup of coffee here; I have had my nap. Permit me to recommend you to do likewise. Their coffee is really excellent.\" He ordered two cups of café noir, and waited, with his head from the window. \" We will keep the cups,\" he said, as he received them from the waiter, \" and the tray. Thank you.\"\n\nThere was a little delay as he paid for these things; and then he took in the little tray, and handed me a cup of coffee.\n\nI declined the tray; so he placed it on his own knees, to act as a miniature table.\n\n\"I can't endure being waited for and hurried,\" he said, I like to sip my coffee at leisure.\"\n\nI agreed. It really was the very perfection of coffee.\n\n\"I, like Monsieur le Marquis, have slept very little for the last two or three nights; and find it difficult to keep awake. This coffee will do wonders for me; it refreshes one so.\"\n\nBefore we had half done, the carriage was again in motion.\n\nFor a time our coffee made us chatty, and our conversation was animated.\n\nThe Marquis was extremely good-natured, as well as clever, and gave me a brilliant and amusing account of Parisian life, schemes, and dangers, all put so as to furnish me with practical warnings of the most valuable kind.\n\nIn spite of the amusing and curious stories which the Marquis related with so much point and colour, I felt myself again becoming gradually drowsy and dreamy.\n\nPerceiving this, no doubt, the Marquis good-naturedly suffered our conversation to subside into silence. The window next him was open. He threw his cup out of it; and did the same kind office for mine, and finally the little tray flew after, and I heard it clank on the road; a valuable waif, no doubt, for some early wayfarer in wooden shoes.\n\nI leaned back in my corner; I had my beloved souvenir -- my white rose -- close to my heart, folded, now, in white paper. It inspired all manner of romantic dreams. I began to grow more and more sleepy. But actual slumber did not come. I was still viewing, with my half-closed eyes, from my corner, diagonally, the interior of the carriage.\n\nI wished for sleep; but the barrier between waking and sleeping seemed absolutely insurmountable; and, instead, I entered into a state of novel and indescribable indolence.\n\nThe Marquis lifted his despatch-box from the floor, placed it on his knees, unlocked it, and took out what proved to be a lamp, which he hung with two hooks, attached to it, to the window opposite to him. He lighted it with a match, put on his spectacles, and taking out a bundle of letters began to read them carefully.\n\nWe were making way very slowly. My impatience had hitherto employed four horses from stage to stage. We were in this emergency, only too happy to have secured two. But the difference in pace was depressing.\n\nI grew tired of the monotony of seeing the spectacled Marquis reading, folding, and docketing, letter after letter. I wished to shut out the image which wearied me, but something prevented my being able to shut my eyes. I tried again and again; but, positively, I had lost the power of closing them.\n\nI would have rubbed my eyes, but I could not stir my hand, my will no longer acted on my body -- I found that I could not move one joint, or muscle, no more than I could, by an effort of my will, have turned the carriage about.\n\nUp to this I had experienced no sense of horror. Whatever it was, simple night-mare was not the cause. I was awfully frightened! Was I in a fit?\n\nIt was horrible to see my good-natured companion pursue his occupation so serenely, when he might have dissipated my horrors by a single shake.\n\nI made a stupendous exertion to call out, but in vain; I repeated the effort again and again, with no result.\n\nMy companion now tied up his letters, and looked out of the window, humming an air from an opera. He drew back his head, and said, turning to me:\n\n\"Yes, I see the lights; we shall be there in two or three minutes.\"\n\nHe looked more closely at me, and with a kind smile, and a little shrug, he said, \"Poor child! how fatigued he must have been -- how profoundly he sleeps! when the carriage stops he will waken.\"\n\nHe then replaced his letters in the despatch-box, locked it, put his spectacles in his pocket, and again looked out of the window.\n\nWe had entered a little town. I suppose it was past two o'clock by this time. The carriage drew up, I saw an inn-door open, and a light issuing from it.\n\n\"Here we are!\" said my companion, turning gaily to me. But I did not awake.\n\n\"Yes, how tired he must have been!\" he exclaimed, after he had waited for an answer. My servant was at the carriage door, and opened it.\n\n\"Your master sleeps soundly, he is so fatigued! It would be cruel to disturb him. You and I will go in, while they change the horses, and take some refreshment, and choose something that Monsieur Beckett will like to take in the carriage, for when he awakes by-and-by, he will, I am sure, be hungry.\"\n\nHe trimmed his lamp, poured in some oil; and taking care not to disturb me, with another kind smile and another word of caution to my servant he got out, and I heard him talking to St Clair, as they entered the inn-door, and I was left in my corner, in the carriage, in the same state.\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nA THREE MINUTES' VISIT\n\nI HAVE suffered extreme and protracted bodily pain, at different periods of my life, but anything like that misery, thank God, I never endured before or since. I earnestly hope it may not resemble any type of death to which we are liable. I was, indeed, a spirit in prison; and unspeakable was my dumb and unmoving agony.\n\nThe power of thought remained clear and active. Dull terror filled my mind. How would this end? Was it actual death?\n\nYou will understand that my faculty of observing was unimpaired. I could hear and see anything as distinctly as ever I did in my life. It was simply that my will had, as it were, lost its hold of my body.\n\nI told you that the Marquis d'Harmonville had not extinguished his carriage lamp on going into this village inn. I was listening intently, longing for his return, which might result, by some lucky accident, in awaking me from my catalepsy.\n\nWithout any sound of steps approaching, to announce an arrival, the carriage-door suddenly opened, and a total stranger got in silently and shut the door.\n\nThe lamp gave about as strong a light as a wax-candle, so I could see the intruder perfectly. He was a young man, with a dark grey loose surtout, made with a sort of hood, which was pulled over his head. I thought, as he moved, that I saw the gold band of a military undress cap under it; and I certainly saw the lace and buttons of a uniform, on the cuffs of the coat that were visible under the wide sleeves of his outside wrapper.\n\nThis young man had thick moustaches and an imperial, and I observed that he had a red scar running upward from his lip across his cheek.\n\nHe entered, shut the door softly, and sat down beside me. It was all done in a moment; leaning toward me, and shading his eyes with his gloved hand, he examined my face closely for a few seconds.\n\nThis man had come as noiselessly as a ghost; and everything he did was accomplished with the rapidity and decision that indicated a well-defined and pre-arranged plan. His designs were evidently sinister. I thought he was going to rob and, perhaps, murder me. I lay, nevertheless, like a corpse under his hands. He inserted his hand in my breast pocket, from which he took my precious white rose and all the letters it contained, among which was a paper of some consequence to me.\n\nMy letters he glanced at. They were plainly not what he wanted. My precious rose, too, he laid aside with them. It was evidently about the paper I have mentioned that he was concerned; for the moment he opened it he began with a pencil, in a small pocket-book, to make rapid notes of its contents.\n\nThis man seemed to glide through his work with a noiseless and cool celerity which argued, I thought, the training of the police department.\n\nHe re-arranged the papers, possibly in the very order in which he had found them, replaced them in my breast-pocket, and was gone. His visit, I think, did not quite last three minutes. Very soon after his disappearance I heard the voice of the Marquis once more. He got in, and I saw him look at me and smile, half-envying me, I fancied, my sound repose. If he had but known all!\n\nHe resumed his reading and docketing by the light of the little lamp which had just subserved the purposes of a spy.\n\nWe were now out of the town, pursuing our journey at the same moderate pace. We had left the scene of my police visit, as I should have termed it, now two leagues behind us, when I suddenly felt a strange throbbing in one ear, and a sensation as if air passed through it into my throat. It seemed as if a bubble of air, formed deep in my car, swelled, and burst there. The indescribable tension of my brain seemed all at once to give way; there was an odd humming in my head, and a sort of vibration through every nerve of my body, such as I have experienced in a limb that has been, in popular phraseology, asleep. I uttered a cry and half rose from my seat, and then fell back trembling, and with a sense of mortal faintness.\n\nThe Marquis stared at me, took my hand, and earnestly asked if I was ill. I could answer only with a deep groan.\n\nGradually the process of restoration was completed; and I was able, though very faintly, to tell him how very ill I had been; and then to describe the violation of my letters, during the time of his absence from the carriage.\n\n\"Good heaven!\" he exclaimed, \"the miscreant did not get at my despatch-box?\"\n\nI satisfied him, so far as I had observed, on that point. He placed the box on the seat beside him, and opened and examined its contents very minutely.\n\n\"Yes, undisturbed; all safe, thank heaven!\" he murmured. \"There are half-a-dozen letters here that I would not have some people read for a great deal.\"\n\nHe now asked with a very kind anxiety all about the illness I complained of. When he had heard me, he said:\n\n\"A friend of mine once had an attack as like yours as possible. It was on board-ship, and followed a state of high excitement. He was a brave man like you; and was called on to exert both his strength and his courage suddenly. An hour or two after, fatigue overpowered him, and he appeared to fall into a sound sleep. He really sank into a state which he afterwards described so that I think it must have been precisely the same affection** as yours.\"\n\n\"I am happy to think that my attack was not unique. Did he ever experience a return of it?\"\n\n\"I knew him for years after, and never heard of any such thing. What strikes me is a parallel in the predisposing causes of each attack. Your unexpected and gallant hand-to-hand encounter, at such desperate odds, with an experienced swordsman, like that insane colonel of dragoons, your fatigue, and, finally, your composing yourself, as my other friend did, to sleep.\"\n\n\"I wish,\" he resumed, \"one could make out who the coquin was who examined your letters. It is not worth turning back, however, because we should learn nothing. Those people always manage so adroitly. I am satisfied, however, that he must have been an agent of the police. A rogue of any other kind would have robbed you.\"\n\nI talked very little, being ill and exhausted, but the Marquis talked on agreeably.\n\n\"We grow so intimate,\" said he, at last, \"that I must remind you that I am not, for the present, the Marquis d'Harmonville, but only Monsieur Droqville; nevertheless, when we get to Paris, although I cannot see you often I may be of use. I shall ask you to name to me the hotel at which you mean to put up; because the Marquis being, as you are aware, on his travels, the Hotel d'Harmonville is, for the present, tenanted only by two or three old servants, who must not even see Monsieur Droqville. That gentleman will, nevertheless, contrive to get you access to the box of Monsieur le Marquis, at the Opera, as well, possibly, as to other places more difficult; and so soon as the diplomatic office of the Marquis d'Harmonville is ended, and he at liberty to declare himself, he will not excuse his friend, Monsieur Beckett, from fulfilling his promise to visit him this autumn at the Château d'Harmonville.\"\n\nYou may be sure I thanked the Marquis.\n\nThe nearer we got to Paris, the more I valued his protection. The countenance of a great man on the spot, just then, taking so kind an interest in the stranger whom he had, as it were, blundered upon, might make my visit ever so many degrees more delightful than I had anticipated.\n\nNothing could be more gracious than the manner and looks of the Marquis; and, as I still thanked him, the carriage suddenly stopped in front of the place where a relay of horses awaited us, and where, as it turned out, we were to part.\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nGOSSIP AND COUNSEL\n\nMY eventful journey was over at last. I sat in my hotel window looking out upon brilliant Paris, which had, in a moment, recovered all its gaiety, and more than its accustomed bustle. Everyone had read of the kind of excitement that followed the catastrophe of Napoleon, and the second restoration of the Bourbons. I need not, therefore, even if, at this distance, I could, recall and describe my experiences and impressions of the peculiar aspect of Paris, in those strange times. It was, to be sure, my first visit. But often as I have seen it since, I don't think I ever saw that delightful capital in a state, pleasurably so excited and exciting.\n\nI had been two days in Paris, and had seen all sorts of sights, and experienced none of that rudeness and insolence of which others complained from the exasperated officers of the defeated French army.\n\nI must say this, also. My romance had taken complete possession of me; and the chance of seeing the object of my dream gave a secret and delightful interest to my rambles and drives in the streets and environs, and my visits to the galleries and other sights of the metropolis.\n\nI had neither seen nor heard of Count or Countess, nor had the Marquis d'Harmonville made any sign. I had quite recovered the strange indisposition under which I had suffered during my night journey.\n\nIt was now evening, and I was beginning to fear that my patrician acquaintance had quite forgotten me, when the waiter presented me the card of \"Monsieur Droqville\"; and, with no small elation and hurry, I desired him to show the gentleman up.\n\nIn came the Marquis d'Harmonville, kind and gracious as ever.\n\n\"I am a night-bird at present,\" said he, so soon as we had exchanged the little speeches which are usual. \"I keep in the shade during the daytime, and even now I hardly ventured to come in a close carriage. The friends for whom I have undertaken a rather critical service, have so ordained it. They think all is lost if I am known to be in Paris. First, let me present you with these orders for my box. I am so vexed that I cannot command it oftener during the next fortnight; during my absence I had directed my secretary to give it for any night to the first of my friends who might apply, and the result is, that I find next to nothing left at my disposal.\"\n\nI thanked him very much.\n\n\"And now a word in my office of Mentor. You have not come here, of course, without introductions?\"\n\nI produced half-a-dozen letters, the addresses of which he looked at.\n\n\"Don't mind these letters,\" he said. \"I will introduce you. I will take you myself from house to house. One friend at your side is worth many letters. Make no intimacies, no acquaintances, until then. You young men like best to exhaust the public amusements of a great city, before embarrassing yourselves with the engagements of society. Go to all these. It will occupy you, day and night, for at least three weeks. When this is over, I shall be at liberty, and will myself introduce you to the brilliant but comparatively quiet routine of society. Place yourself in my hands; and in Paris remember, when once in society, you are always there.\"\n\nI thanked him very much, and promised to follow his counsels implicitly. He seemed pleased, and said:\n\n\"I shall now tell you some of the places you ought to go to. Take your map, and write letters or numbers upon the points I will indicate, and we will make out a little list. All the places that I shall mention to you are worth seeing.\"\n\nIn this methodical way, and with a great deal of amusing and scandalous anecdote, he furnished me with a catalogue and a guide, which, to a seeker of novelty and pleasure, was invaluable.\n\n\"In a fortnight, perhaps in a week,\" he said, \"I shall be at leisure to be of real use to you. In the meantime, be on your guard. You must not play; you will be robbed if you do. Remember, you are surrounded, here, by plausible swindlers and villains of all kinds, who subsist by devouring strangers. Trust no one but those you know.\"\n\nI thanked him again, and promised to profit by his advice. But my heart was too full of the beautiful lady of the Belle Étoile, to allow our interview to close without an effort to learn something about her. I therefore asked for the Count and Countess de St Alyre, whom I had had the good fortune to extricate from an extremely unpleasant row in the hall of the inn.\n\nAlas! he had not seen them since. He did not know where they were staying. They had a fine old house only a few leagues from Paris; but he thought it probable that they would remain, for a few days at least, in the city, as preparations would, no doubt, be necessary, after so long an absence, for their reception at home.\n\n\"How long have they been away?\"\n\n\"About eight months, I think.\"\n\n\"They are poor, I think you said?\"\n\n\"What you would consider poor. But, Monsieur, the Count has an income which affords them the comforts and even the elegancies of life, living as they do, in a very quiet and retired way, in this cheap country.\"\n\n\"Then they are very happy?\"\n\n\"One would say they ought to be happy.\"\n\n\"And what prevents?\"\n\n\"He is jealous.\"\n\n\"But his wife -- she gives him no cause.\"\n\n\"I am afraid she does.\"\n\n\"How, Monsieur?\"\n\n\"I always thought she was a little too -- a great deal too ----\"\n\n\"Too what, Monsieur?\"\n\n\"Too handsome. But although she has remarkable fine eyes, exquisite features, and the most delicate complexion in the world, I believe that she is a woman of probity. You have never seen her?\"\n\n\"There was a lady, muffled up in a cloak, with a very thick veil on, the other night, in the hall of the Belle Étoile, when I broke that fellow's head who was bullying the old Count. But her veil was so thick I could not see a feature through it!\" My answer was diplomatic, you observe. \"She may have been the Count's daughter. Do they quarrel?\"\n\n\"Who, he and his wife?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"A little.\"\n\nOh! and what do they quarrel about?\"\n\n\"It is a long story; about the lady's diamonds. They are valuable -- they are worth, La Perelleuse says, about a million of francs. The Count wishes them sold and turned into revenue, which he offers to settle as she pleases. The Countess, whose they are, resists, and for a reason which, I rather think, she can't disclose to him.\"\n\n\"And pray what is that?\" I asked, my curiosity a good deal piqued.\n\n\"She is thinking, I conjecture, how well she will look in them when she marries her second husband.\"\n\n\"Oh? -- yes, to be sure. But the Count de St Alyre is a good man?\"\n\n\"Admirable, and extremely intelligent.\"\n\n\"I should wish so much to be presented to the Count: you tell me he's so ---- \"\n\n\"So agreeably married. But they are living quite out of the world. He takes her now and then to the Opera, or to a public entertainment; but that is all.\"\n\n\"And he must remember so much of the old régime, and so many of the scenes of the revolution!\"\n\n\"Yes, the very man for a philosopher, like you! And he falls asleep after dinner; and his wife don't. But, seriously, he has retired from the gay and the great world, and has grown apathetic; and so has his wife; and nothing seems to interest her now, not even -- her husband!\n\nThe Marquis stood up to take his leave.\n\n\"Don't risk your money,\" said he. \"You will soon have an opportunity of laying out some of it to great advantage. Several collections of really good pictures, belonging to persons who have mixed themselves up in this Bonapartist restoration, must come within a few weeks to the hammer. You can do wonders when these sales commence. There will be startling bargains! Reserve yourself for them. I shall let you know all about it. By-the-by,\" he said, stopping short as he approached the door, \"I was so near forgetting. There is to be next week, the very thing you would enjoy so much, because you see so little of it in England -- I mean a bal masqué, conducted, it is said, with more than usual splendour. It takes place at Versailles -- all the world will be there; there is such a rush for cards! But I think I may promise you one. Good-night! Adieu!\"\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTHE BLACK VEIL\n\nSPEAKING the language fluently, and with unlimited money, there was nothing to prevent my enjoying all that was enjoyable in the French capital. You may easily suppose how two days were passed. At the end of that time, and at about the same hour, Monsieur Droqville called again.\n\nCourtly, good-natured, gay, as usual, he told me that the masquerade ball was fixed for the next Wednesday, and that he had applied for a card for me.\n\nHow awfully unlucky. I was so afraid I should not be able to go.\n\nHe stared at me for a moment with a suspicious and menacing look, which I did not understand, in silence, and then inquired rather sharply. And will Monsieur Beckett be good enough to say why not?\n\nwas a little surprised, but answered the simple truth: I had made an engagement for that evening with two or three English friends, and did not see how I could.\n\n\"Just so! You English, wherever you are, always look out for your English boors, your beer and 'bifstek'; and when you come here, instead of trying to learn something of the people you visit, and pretend to study, you are guzzling and swearing, and smoking with one another, and no wiser or more polished at the end of your travels than if you had been all the time carousing in a booth at Greenwich.\"\n\nHe laughed sarcastically, and looked as if he could have poisoned me.\n\n\"There it is,\" said he, throwing the card on the table. \"Take it or leave it, just as you please. I suppose I shall have my trouble for my pains; but it is not usual when a man such as I takes trouble, asks a favour, and secures a privilege for an acquaintance, to treat him so.\"\n\nThis was astonishingly impertinent.\n\nI was shocked, offended, penitent. I had possibly committed unwittingly a breach of good breeding, according to French ideas, which almost justified the brusque severity of the Marquis's undignified rebuke.\n\nIn a confusion, therefore, of many feelings, I hastened to make my apologies, and to propitiate the chance friend who had showed me so much disinterested kindness.\n\nI told him that I would, at any cost, break through the engagement in which I had unluckily entangled myself; that I had spoken with too little reflection, and that I certainly had not thanked him at all in proportion to his kindness, and to my real estimate of it.\n\n\"Pray say not a word more; my vexation was entirely on your account; and I expressed it, I am only too conscious, in terms a great deal too strong, which, I am sure, your good nature will pardon. Those who know me a little better are aware that I sometimes say a good deal more than I intend; and am always sorry when I do. Monsieur Beekett will forget that his old friend Monsieur Droqville has lost his temper in his cause, for a moment, and -- we are as good friends as before.\"\n\nHe smiled like the Monsieur Droqville of the Belle Étoile, and extended his hand, which I took very respectfully and cordially.\n\nOur momentary quarrel had left us only better friends.\n\nThe Marquis then told me I had better secure a bed in some hotel at Versailles, as a rush would be made to take them; and advised my going down next morning for the purpose.\n\nI ordered horses accordingly for eleven o'clock; and, after a little more conversation, the Marquis d'Harmonville bade me good-night, and ran down the stairs with his handkerchief to his mouth and nose, and, as I saw from my window, jumped into his close carriage again and drove away.\n\nNext day I was at Versailles. As I approached the door of the Hotel de France it was plain that I was not a moment too soon, if, indeed, I were not already too late.\n\nA crowd of carriages were drawn up about the entrance, so that I had no chance of approaching except by dismounting and pushing my way among the horses. The hall was full of servants and gentlemen screaming to the proprietor, who in a state of polite distraction was assuring them, one and all, that there was not a room or a closet disengaged in his entire house.\n\nI slipped out again, leaving the hall to those who were shouting, expostulating, and wheedling, in the delusion that the host might, if he pleased, manage something for them. I jumped into my carriage and drove, at my horses' best pace, to the Hotel du Reservoir. The blockade about this door was as complete as the other. The result was the same. It was very provoking, but what was to be done? My postilion had, a little officiously, while I was in the hall talking with the hotel authorities, got his horses, bit by bit, as other carriages moved away, to the very steps of the inn door.\n\nThis arrangement was very convenient so far as getting in again was concerned. But, this accomplished, how were we to get on? There were carriages in front, and carriages behind, and no less than four rows of carriages, of all sorts, outside.\n\nI had at this time remarkably long and clear sight, and if I had been impatient before, guess what my feelings were when I saw an open carriage pass along the narrow strip of roadway left open at the other side, a barouche in which I was certain I recognized the veiled Countess and her husband. This carriage had been brought to a walk by a cart which occupied the whole breadth of the narrow way, and was moving with the customary tardiness of such vehicles.\n\nI should have done more wisely if I had jumped down on the trottoir, and run round the block of carriages in front of the barouche. But, unfortunately, I was more of a Murat than a Moltke, and preferred a direct charge upon my object to relying on tactique. I dashed across the back seat of a carriage which was next mine, I don't know how; tumbled through a sort of gig, in which an old gentleman and a dog were dozing; stepped with an incoherent apology over the side of an open carriage, in which were four gentlemen engaged in a hot dispute; tripped at the far side in getting out, and fell flat across the backs of a pair of horses, who instantly began plunging and threw me head foremost in the dust.\n\nTo those who observed my reckless charge, without being in the secret of my object, I must have appeared demented. Fortunately, the interesting barouche had passed before the catastrophe, and covered as I was with dust, and my hat blocked, you may be sure I did not care to present myself before the object of my Quixotic devotion.\n\nI stood for a while amid a storm of sacré-ing, tempered disagreeably with laughter; and in the midst of these, while endeavouring to beat the dust from my clothes with my handkerchief, I heard a voice with which I was acquainted call, \"Monsieur Beckett.\"\n\nI looked and saw the Marquis peeping from a carriage-window. It was a welcome sight. In a moment I was at his carriage side.\n\n\"You may as well leave Versailles,\" he said; \"you have learned, no doubt, that there is not a bed to hire in either of the hotels; and I can add that there is not a room to let in the whole town. But I have managed something for you that will answer just as well. Tell your servant to follow us, and get in here and sit beside me.\n\nFortunately an opening in the closely-packed carriages had just occurred, and mine was approaching.\n\nI directed the servant to follow us; and the Marquis having said a word to his driver, we were immediately in motion.\n\n\"I will bring you to a comfortable place, the very existence of which is known to but few Parisians, where, knowing how things were here, I secured a room for you. It is only a mile away, and an old comfortable inn, called the Le Dragon Volant. It was fortunate for you that my tiresome business called me to this place so early.\"\n\nI think we had driven about a mile-and-a-half to the further side of the palace when we found ourselves upon a narrow old road, with the woods of Versailles on one side, and much older trees, of a size seldom seen in France, on the other.\n\nWe pulled up before an antique and solid inn, built of Caen stone, in a fashion richer and more florid than was ever usual in such houses, and which indicated that it was originally designed for the private mansion of some person of wealth, and probably, as the wall bore many carved shields and supporters, of distinction also. A kind of porch, less ancient than the rest, projected hospitably with a wide and florid arch, over which, cut in high relief in stone, and painted and gilded, was the sign of the inn. This was the Flying Dragon, with wings of brilliant red and gold, expanded, and its tail, pale green and gold, twisted and knotted into ever so many rings, and ending in a burnished point barbed like the dart of death.\n\n\"I shan't go in -- but you will find it a comfortable place; at all events better than nothing. I would go in with you, but my incognito forbids. You will, I daresay, be all the better pleased to learn that the inn is haunted-I should have been, in my young days, I know. But don't allude to that awful fact in hearing of your host, for I believe it is a sore subject. Adieu. If you want to enjoy yourself at the ball, take my advice and go in a domino. I think I shall look in; and certainly, if I do, in the same costume. How shall we recognize one another? Let me see, something held in the fingers -- a flower won't do, so many people will have flowers. Suppose you get a red cross a couple of inches long -- you're an Englishman -- stitched or pinned on the breast of your domino, and I a white one? Yes, that will do very well; and whatever room you go into keep near the door till we meet. I shall look for you at all the doors I pass; and you, in the same way, for me; and we must find each other soon. So that is understood. I can't enjoy a thing of that kind with any but a young person; a man of my age requires the contagion of young spirits and the companionship of someone who enjoys everything spontaneously. Farewell; we meet to-night.\"\n\nBy this time I was standing on the road; I shut the carriage-door; bid him good-bye; and away he drove.\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTHE DRAGON VOLANT\n\nI TOOK one look about me.\n\nThe building was picturesque; the trees made it more so. The antique and sequestered character of the scene contrasted strangely with the glare and bustle of the Parisian life, to which my eye and ear had become accustomed.\n\nThen I examined the gorgeous old sign for a minute or two. Next I surveyed the exterior of the house more carefully. It was large and solid, and squared more with my ideas of an ancient English hostelrie, such as the Canterbury Pilgrims might have put up at, than a French house of entertainment. Except, indeed, for a round turret, that rose at the left flank of the house, and terminated in the extinguisher-shaped roof that suggests a French château.\n\nI entered and announced myself as Monsieur Beckett, for whom a room had been taken. I was received with all the consideration due to an English milord , with, of course, an unfathomable purse.\n\nMy host conducted me to my apartment. It was a large room, a little sombre, panelled with dark wainscoting, and furnished in a stately and sombre style, long out of date. There was a wide hearth, and a heavy mantelpiece, carved with shields, in which I might, had I been curious enough, have discovered a correspondence with the heraldry on the outer walls. There was something interesting, melancholy, and even depressing in all this. I went to the stone-shafted window, and looked out upon a small park, with a thick wood, forming the background of a château which presented a cluster of such conical-topped turrets as I have just now mentioned.\n\nThe wood and château were melancholy objects. They showed signs of neglect, and almost of decay; and the gloom of fallen grandeur, and a certain air of desertion hung oppressively over the scene.\n\nI asked my host the name of the château.\n\n\"That, Monsieur, is the Château de la Carque,\" he answered.\n\n\"It is a pity it is so neglected,\" I observed. \"I should say, perhaps, a pity that its proprietor is not more wealthy?\"\n\n\"Perhaps so, Monsieur.\"\n\n\"Perhaps?\"--I repeated, and looked at him. \"Then I suppose he is not very popular.\"\n\n\"Neither one thing nor the other, Monsieur,\" he answered; \"I meant only that we could not tell what use he might make of riches.\"\n\n\"And who is he?\" I inquired.\n\n\"The Count de St Alyre.\"\n\n\"Oh! The Count! You are quite sure?\" I asked, very eagerly.\n\nIt was now the innkeeper's turn to look at me.\n\n\"Quite sure, Monsieur, the Count de St Alyre.\"\n\n\"Do you see much of him in this part of the world?\"\n\n\"Not a great deal, Monsieur; he is often absent for a considerable time.\"\n\n\"And is he poor?\" I inquired.\n\n\"I pay rent to him for this house. It is not much; but I find he cannot wait long for it,\" he replied, smiling satirically.\n\n\"From what I have heard, however, I should think he cannot be very poor?\" I continued.\n\n\"They say, Monsieur, he plays. I know not. He certainly is not rich. About seven months ago, a relation of his died in a distant place. His body was sent to the Count's house here, and by him buried in Père la Chaise, as the poor gentleman had desired. The Count was in profound affliction; although he got a handsome legacy, they say, by that death. But money never seems to do him good for any time.\"\n\n\"He is old, I believe?\"\n\n\"Old? We call him the 'Wandering Jew,' except, indeed, that he has not always the five sous in his pocket. Yet, Monsieur, his courage does not fail him. He has taken a young and handsome wife.\"\n\n\"And she?\" I urged --\n\n\"Is the Countess de St Alyre.\n\n\"Yes; but I fancy we may say something more? She has attributes?\"\n\n\"Three, Monsieur, three, at least most amiable.\"\n\n\"Ah! And what are they?\"\n\n\"Youth, beauty, and -- diamonds.\n\nI laughed. The sly old gentleman was foiling my curiosity.\n\n\"I see, my friend,\" said I, \"you are reluctant ---- \"\n\n\"To quarrel with the Count,\" he concluded. \"True. You see, Monsieur, he could vex me in two or three ways, so could I him. But, on the whole, it is better each to mind his business, and to maintain peaceful relations; you understand.\"\n\nIt was, therefore, no use trying, at least for the present. Perhaps he had nothing to relate. Should I think differently, by-and-by, I could try the effect of a few Napoleons. Possibly he meant to extract them.\n\nThe host of the Dragon Volant was an elderly man, thin, bronzed, intelligent, and with an air of decision, perfectly military. I learned afterwards that he had served under Napoleon in his early Italian campaigns.\n\n\"One question, I think you may answer,\" I said, \"without risking a quarrel. Is the Count at home?\"\n\n\"He has many homes, I conjecture,\" said the host evasively. \"But -- but I think I may say, Monsieur, that he is, I believe, at present staying at the Château de la Carque.\"\n\nI looked out of the window, more interested than ever, across the undulating grounds to the château, with its gloomy background of foliage.\n\n\"I saw him to-day, in his carriage at Versailles,\" I said.\n\n\"Very natural.\"\n\n\"Then his carriage, and horses, and servants, are at the château?\"\n\n\"The carriage he puts up here, Monsieur, and the servants are hired for the occasion. There is but one who sleeps at the château. Such a life must be terrifying for Madame the Countess,\" he replied.\n\n\"The old screw!\" I thought. \"By this torture, he hopes to extract her diamonds. What a life! What fiends to contend with -- jealousy and extortion!\"\n\nThe knight having made his speech to himself, cast his eyes once more upon the enchanter's castle, and heaved a gentle sigh -- a sigh of longing, of resolution, and of love.\n\nWhat a fool I was! and yet, in the sight of angels, are we any wiser as we grow older? It seems to me, only, that our illusions change as we go on; but, still, we are madmen all the same.\n\n\"Well, St Clair,\" said I, as my servant entered, and began to arrange my things.\n\n\"You have got a bed?\"\n\n\"In the cock-loft, Monsieur, among the spiders, and, par ma foi! the cats and the owls. But we agree very well. Vive la bagatelle!\"\n\n\"I had no idea it was so full.\"\n\n\"Chiefly the servants, Monsieur, of those persons who were fortunate enough to get apartments at Versailles.\"\n\n\"And what do you think of the Dragon Volant?\"\n\n\"The Dragon Volant! Monsieur; the old fiery dragon! The devil himself, if all is true! On the faith of a Christian, Monsieur, they say that diabolical miracles have taken place in this house.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? Revenants?\"\n\n\"Not at all, sir; I wish it was no worse. Revenants? No! People who have never returned -- who vanished, before the eyes of half-a-dozen men all looking at them.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, St Clair? Let us hear the story, or miracle, or whatever it is.\""
