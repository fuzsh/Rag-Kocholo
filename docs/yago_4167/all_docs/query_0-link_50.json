It was felt that the college's increasing emphasis on Latin\n\nAmerican specialities, its new two-quarter History of the Americas\n\ncourse, its federal grant to bring a Latin American curriculum specialist\n\nto the campus for a year, Georgia's proximity and generally increasing\n\nawareness of our neighbors to the South, prompted this review. The\n\npublication was made possible by a grant from Sears.\n\nThe papers herein were delivered at the XIV Annual Meeting\n\nof the Southeastern Conference on Latin American Studies (SECOLAS)\n\nin Atlanta on April 14, 15, 1967, Alfred B. Thomas, Emeritus, Depart-\n\nment of History, University of Alabama, 1966-1967 president. The\n\nsessions of three papers each were followed by a criticism. The first,\n\nsession, \"Economics and the Carribean,\" was presided over by Jack D.\n\nL. Holmes, College of General Studies, University of Alabama in Bir-\n\nmingham. Some liberty was taken in the personification of the United\n\nFruit company. The second grouping on \"Mexico's Enigmatic Caudil-\n\nlos,\" was chaired by J. Leon Helguera, Graduate Center for Latin\n\nAmerican Studies, Vanderbilt University. The third meeting, conducted\n\nby S. Herbert Cockburn, Director, Latin American Studies Program,\n\nCampbell College, was on \"Brazil: Some Forceful Figures.\" The article\n\non Hassaurek was the luncheon address and the dinner address was a\n\nslide lecture on the \"Development of the Amazon Basin\" by State Sena-\n\ntor McKinley Conway of Conway Research, Inc., of Atlanta. A paper\n\non Victoriano Huerta by William Coker, University of Southern Missis-\n\nsippi, was not included in this publication at his request.\n\nAppreciation is given especially to the authors for their papers\n\nand permission to publish as well as to the members of the Division\n\nof Social Sciences. Particular thanks go to Dean John M. Martin,\n\nClyde D. Ware of the Sears Foundation, Melvin Ecke for local arrange-\n\nments, lone S. Wright as President-elect of SECOLAS, and Gail Adams\n\nand Joan Johnston as secretaries.\n\nEugene R.

Arbena*\n\nThe permanent loss of a portion of national territory as potentially\n\nsignificant as the Isthmus of Panama was to Colombia 1 could conceiv-\n\nably contribute directly to later important historical developments. At\n\nbest, the separation of Panama might have stimulated in Colombia a\n\nrejuvenation of nationalistic dedication, a spirit of bi-partisan unity\n\noverriding the suicidal conflicts which had caused such bloodshed and\n\ndestruction throughout the nineteenth century. At worst it might have\n\naccelerated the disruptive forces of party and section to the extent of\n\ncomplete national disintegration. At the least, one might justifiably\n\nhave expected either a serious effort to displace the incumbent Conserva-\n\ntive administration in Bogota, or an attempt by that administration to\n\nemploy the current crisis as a means to strengthen and perpetuate its\n\nposition; and, in either case, we might have predicted the beginning\n\nof a lengthy period of popular and official hostility toward the United\n\nStates.\n\nYet, an examination of events since November, 1903 shows the\n\nabove assumptions to be generally inaccurate and raises some major\n\nquestions for the student of Colombian history. Why, for example, did\n\nColumbia fail to break diplomatic relations with the United States\n\nwhen the latter refused to satisfy even the most limited Colombian de-\n\nmands for settlement? More important, why has Colombia continued\n\nto be one of the most consistent friends of the United States in Latin\n\nAmerica, despite the fact that, with the possible exception of Mexico,\n\nshe has suffered as much at the hands of the Northern Colossus as any\n\n*Department of History, Clemson University.\n\ni For Colombian views of the value of Panama to Colombia see Felipe Perez,\n\nJeografia fi'sica i politica del Estado de Panama (Bogota, 1862), p. 78; Lorenzo\n\nMarroquin, El Canal (Bogota, 1903), pp. 115-116; and, Eduardo Posada,\n\nDiscursos y conjerencias (Paris, 1908), p. 135.\n\nof her Latin neighbors? Third, why was there in Colombia neither a\n\nrevolutionary or reactionary movement which might be viewed as a\n\nconsequence of the loss of Panama? And, last, considering the manner\n\nin which the previous questions are framed, what impact, if any, did\n\nthe Panama affair really have on Colombian national politics and\n\ncharacter?\n\nThese questions are clearly too broad to be treated adequately in\n\nthis paper. One must, however, consider some tentative answers in these\n\nareas in order to provide a framework for examining a more specific\n\naspect of the Panama question: that is, Colombian views of the role\n\nof Theodore Roosevelt in the Isthmian independence revolution.\n\nThe end of the Guerra de los Mil Dias in late 1902 found the\n\nColombian nation physically and spiritually exhausted. The estimates\n\nof material . and human destruction 2 do not reflect the pessimistic\n\nspirit which gripped Colombians for many months after that conflict.\n\nDeath and other horrors of war were topics of frequent discussion, 3 and\n\n\"peace at any cost\" was a popular slogan in many circles. 4 News of the\n\nloss of Panama, fatalistically accepted as permanent surprisingly early, 5\n\ndid not obliterate the memories of the Mil Dias. Rather, the events of\n\nNovember, 1903 intensified the sense of fatigue and depression. 6\n\n2 Jorge Holguin, Desde cerca (Paris, 1908), pp. 112, 148-150; Jorge Sanchez\n\nCamacho, El General Ospina (Bogota, I960), p. 96; Rafael Granados, Historia\n\nde Colombia (Bogota, I960), pp. 265-267.\n\n3 Max Grillo, Emociones de la guerra (Bogota, 1903), pp. 9, 24-25; Correo\n\ndel Sur (Manizales), 23 May 1903, p. 4; El Conservador (Cali), 18 Nov. 1903.\n\np. 8; La Gruta (Bogota), 29 Aug. 1903, pp. 92, 94; Ibid., 7 Nov. 1903, p. 183.\n\n4 El Esfuerzo (Zipaquira), 13 Apr. 1902, p. 1; El Reporter (Barranquilla).\n\n12 Mar. 1903, p. 2; El Dia (Honda), 14 Aug. 1903, p. 6; El Combeimu\n\n(Ibague), 7 Nov. 1903, p. 1; El Conservador, 11 Nov. 1903, p. 2.\n\ns El Trabajo (San Jose de Cucuta), 14 May 1904, p. 3; Eduardo Lemaitre.\n\nReyes (Bogota, 1952), p. 211; Raimundo Rivas, Historia diplomatica de\n\nColombia (Bogota, 1961), p. 610.\n\n6 El Conservador, 11 Nov. 1903, p. 1; La Gruta, 28 Nov. 1903, p. 227; Ibid..\n\n8 Feb. 1904, pp. 301-302; La Organization (Medellfn), 3 Dec. 1903,' p. 3;\n\nIbid., 9 Feb. 1904, p. 2; El Trabajo, 12 Dec. 1903, p. 3; El Adalid Catolico\n\n(Pasto), 18 Feb. 1904, p. 167; Jorge Holqufn to Rufino Jose Cuervo\n\n24 Aug. 1904, Jorge Holguin MSS, Correspondencia Oficial, 1904-1908, Aca-\n\ndemia Colombiana de Historia (hereinafter referred to as Holguin MSS).\n\nAnother war, even a holy one, made fine talk, but poor policy. 7 Both\n\nthe government and the citizenry knew the consequences of pushing\n\nfor another war.\n\nReports from Panama failed not only to rejuvenate Colombian\n\nspirits; they failed likewise to overcome the forces of disunity which\n\nhad for so long hindered national development. 3 Despite a superficial\n\nclosing of ranks, partisan and regional strife continued to prevent con-\n\ncerted, vigorous action. Colombians blamed each other for their coun-\n\ntry's compounded ills. 9 Only a few were willing to suggest that perhaps\n\nthe entire nation was at fault. 10 General criticism of the treasonous be-\n\nhavior of the Isthmians\" and of the immoral and illegal actions of the\n\nUnited States 12 failed to suppress the dissention.\n\nAlso detracting from any forceful response was the fear of further\n\nnational disintegration. 13 Rumors ran rampant that leaders in other\n\ndiscontented regions, not satisfied with criticizing or obstructing gov-\n\n7 Enrique Cortes to Jose Manuel Marroquin, 13 Nov. 1903, Belosario Palacios\n\nto Marroquin, 1 Jan. 1904, B.

This was Reyes, a self -expressed admirer of Porfirio Diaz, 31 who\n\ndominated the closing months of the Marroquin administration and\n\ninitiated his own in August 1904. 32 Reyes believed, above all, that Co-\n\nlombian progress depended on the continuance of domestic stability, 33\n\nthe maintenance of peaceful relations with the United States, 34 and\n\nthe opening of the Panama Canal on terms favorable to Colombia. 35\n\n28 A brief sketch in English of Reyes' life is in J.

His ultimate mistake\n\nwas a failure to realize that pursuit of such goals, however commenda-\n\nble and popular, must be confined to certain limits. 36 But in June 1909,\n\nReyes could leave quietly for Europe, having inaugurated a lengthy\n\nperiod of domestic \"orden y progreso\" 37 and an even longer period\n\nof improving relations between Colombia and the United States and\n\nColombia and the Republic of Panama.\n\nThe various factors outlined above provide a useful beginning in\n\nexplaining the failure of Colombians to act decisively in response to\n\nthe separation of Panama. But, an attempt to answer more fully the\n\nbroad questions posed at the outset of this paper requires an examina-\n\ntion of both Colombian views of the United States in general and of\n\nColombian interpretations of the specific yanqui role in the Isthmian\n\ndebacle. While such views were probably not the major element in\n\ndetermining overall Colombian policy, or lack of said, certainly they\n\nhave given a special tone to Colombian-United States relations and\n\nto the historiography of the entire Panama question.\n\nThat the United States had an active part in the Panamanian in-\n\ndependence movement few Colombians have doubted. Since the mo-\n\nment news of the Isthmian revolt first reached Colombia proper, com-\n\nmentators have agreed that United States policy violated the accepted\n\nstandards of international law and morality. 38 By encouraging, perhaps\n\neven financing, the revolution the United States improperly interfered\n\nin Colombian domestic affairs and promoted a treasonous act which\n\n36 For a brief discussion of the factors, domestic and foreign, which led to\n\nReyes' resignation see Henao and Arrubla, History of Colombia, pp. 523-527;\n\nLemaitre, Reyes, pp. 309-320; and E.

In an open letter\n\nto the people of the United States, President Marroquin referred to \"la\n\nbandera estrellada,\" always beloved by all republicans in the Americas. 51\n\nAn editor in Barranquilla affirmed his admiration for the United\n\nStates, \"destined by its institutions and by its exuberant elements of\n\ncivilization and life to be the greatest nation on the earth.\" 52 Raul Perez,\n\nappealing in the United States press for sympathy for his country's\n\nposition, promised that\n\n47 El Espectador (Medellin), 2 Jan. 1904, pp. 248-249; El Conservador, 9 Dec.\n\n1903, p. 18; Ibid., 6 Jan. 1904, p. 34; Carlos Uribe, Colombia, p. 16; Reyes,\n\nPor Colombia, pp. 35-36; Raimundo Rivas, Relaciones internacionales entre\n\nColombia y los Estados Unidos. 1810-1850 (Bogota, 1915), p. 169; Osorio,\n\nVision de America, p. 213.\n\n48 Antonio Jose Uribe, La reforma administrativa en Colombia (Bogota, 1917),\n\npp. 23, 318-319; El Dia, 24 Dec. 1903, p. 1; El Combeima, 24 Dec. 1903, p. 1;\n\nReyes, Mision, p. 23; Borda, Derecho international, pp. 50, 53, 69; Antonio\n\nJose Uribe, Cuestiones internacionales, economicas, politicas y sociales (Bogota,\n\n1925), p. 4.\n\n49 See text and notes below.\n\nso Ernesto Murillo, Estudio sobre la historia de la diplomacia en Colombia\n\n(Bogota, 1910) p. 18; A.

We\n\nhave continued to love our great sister republic and to wish\n\nthat we could imitate her in many ways, because we attributed\n\nher mistakes in her dealings with us to ignorance of true\n\nconditions. 53\n\nAnd, in most eloquent fashion, Rafael Uribe Uribe, leader of the\n\noft- persecuted Liberal Party, proclaimed the following:\n\nAs men, as republicans, and as Americans we are all\n\nproud of your nation, because she honors humanity, because\n\nshe supports free institutions, and because the very existence\n\nof the great republic to the north of our continent is by itself\n\nsuch a colossal geographical and political fact that, even with-\n\nout such a controversial doctrine as Monroe's, it infuses re-\n\nspect and fear into a world that awakens so many antipathies\n\nand misgivings. 54\n\nSince the ratification of the Thomson-Urrutia Treaty, 55 Colombians\n\nhave been more generous in speaking favorably of the United States.\n\nEven such critics of the events of 1903 as Luis Alfredo Otero and\n\nAlvaro Rebolledo commented respectively on the \"tie of sincere and\n\nloyal friendship\" which bound Colombia to \"la potencia del Norte\" 56\n\nand the lack of Machiavellian techniques in American diplomacy. 57\n\nOther observors have labeled the United States the spiritual and mili-\n\ntary leader in the fight for liberty 58 and \"the country which has acquired\n\n53 Perez, \"The Treacherous Treaty,\" p. 944.\n\n54 Por la America del Sur, I, pp. 136-137.\n\n55 For a summary of negotiations and debate surrounding this treaty see Rivas,\n\nHistoria diplomatic a, pp. 617-621, 661-662; German Cavelier, La politica in-\n\nternational de Columbia (Bogota, 1959), III, pp. 85-106.\n\n56 Otero, Panama, p. 112.\n\n57 Alvaro Rebolledo, Resena historico-politica de la comunicacion inter-ocednica\n\n(San Francisco, 1930), p. 325.\n\n58 Antonio Jose Uribe Portocarrero, En torno de los Estados Unidos de America\n\n(Bogota, 1944), pp. 61-62.\n\n13\n\ntoday the highest level of civic culture.\" 59 In September 1964, President\n\nLeon Valencia summed up what is apparently the conviction of many\n\nof his countrymen:\n\nColombia has always maintained optimum relations with\n\nthe great northern democracy. These relations have been\n\ncut by only one deplorable and iniquitous act, the wound from\n\nwhich has left on us an unforgettable impression. But we\n\nbear no grudge, because the Americans found a satisfactory\n\nway to make amends, not by the exiguous indemnification\n\nthey offered us but rather by the rectitude and honesty of\n\ntheir conduct. Later, the natural and fruitful power of the\n\nUnited States . . . put in their hands, and their hands alone . . .\n\nthe enslaving and incontrastable power of the atomic bond. 60\n\nBut, Valencia recalled, the United States remained loyal to its tradi-\n\ntional principles and did not use this tool for world conquest. It put\n\nthat force instead to the use of right; for this behavior it deserves\n\nthe gratitude of all men of good will.\n\nMore indicative of the continued Colombian faith in American\n\nconcepts of justice in the wake of the events of 1903 were the fre-\n\nquent expressions of confidence in the ability of the American people\n\nto understand Colombia's grievances and to take steps to rectify the\n\nobvious wrong. Private citizens and government officials alike, having\n\nno hope for cooperation from the Roosevelt administration, 61 saw\n\n\". . . no other course left but to appeal to the people of the United\n\nStates and to their undoubted sense of honesty.\" 62 The Colombian\n\npeople were certain, wrote Marroquin, that the American people,\n\npossessing \"sentiments of equity and justice\" would never permit \"the\n\nviolation of treaties and the rejection of glorious traditions.\" 63 These\n\nsame Americans, declared Juan Perez y Soto, president of the patriotic\n\n59 Jesus Maria Yepes, Una politica international para Colombia (Bogota,\n\n1956), p. 16.\n\n60 El Tiempo (Bogota), 23 Sept. 1964, p. 24.\n\n6i La Gruta, 5 Dec. 1903, pp. 241-242; Reyes to Holguin, 23 Dec. 1903, AH\n\nde LMD; Reyes to Rico, 8 Jan. 1904, Ministerio de RR.

The members of the Reyes Commission, 65 which\n\narrived in Washington in late November 1903, received instructions to\n\nconduct an active campaign for the sympathies of the American public\n\nand the support of anti-administration politicians. 66 Through the press,\n\npublic meetings, and private conferences, the Colombian representatives\n\nstruggled to arouse criticism of United States policy. 67 And in this\n\nstruggle they found sufficient favorable response to keep their hopes\n\nalive. Any condemnation of Roosevelt, however slight, served the\n\nanxious Colombians as justification of their position. 68\n\nThe fact that the bulk of the anti-Roosevelt feeling in the United\n\nStates was concentrated in the Democratic Party led Colombians, in\n\nturn, to look at the American presidential election of 1904 with great\n\nexpectations, seeing in the desired election of that \"alta figura,\" Judge\n\nAlton B. Parker, the \"recovery of the rights and privileges of the South\n\nAmerican nations.\" 69 (One optimistic observor gave Parker a 909v-\n\nchance of winning.) 70\n\nThe Republican victory in 1904 did not permanently destroy\n\nColombian hopes that the American people would eventually elect an\n\nadministration which would treat justly and honorably with an agrieved\n\n64 Perez y Soto, 1NRI, p. 100.\n\n65 For details and initial instructions see Ministerio de RR.

It was Roosevelt, the \"godfather\" 88 of\n\nPanama, who \"composed and decreed the act of separation,\" and, in\n\nso doing, wrote Marco Fidel Suarez, \"set himself in contrast to his\n\nillustrious predecessors, heroes of wisdom, honor, and patriotism, such\n\nas Adams, Lincoln, Seward, Garfield, and Blaine.\" 89 Over the years\n\nRoosevelt personally has been accused of \"contriving,\" \"inspiring,\"\n\n\"fomenting,\" \"sponsoring,\" and \"commanding\" the revolution. 90 H/\n\nis reported to have \"usurped\" Panama; \"ferociously offended a weak\n\nnation;\" pursued a \"Hitleristic\" and \"savage\" international policy,\n\nlabeled \"palo grande\" or \"gran garrote;\" extended over Panama his\n\n\"pirates claws;\" and, \"looked upon the little countries of Latin America\n\nas mice.\" 91 Colombians have classified him \"the hunter of nations,\"\n\n87 Printed in Velez R., Asuntos, pp. 32-33.\n\n88 Enrique Perez, Causa y efecto (Bogota, 1910), p. 42.\n\n89 Doctrinas internacionales, pp. 149, 151.\n\n90-9A El Combeima, 24 Dec. 1903, p. 2; Aristizabal, Dos tests, pp. 3, 53; Ortiz\n\nand Galvis, Estados Unidos, p. 41; Lozano y Lozano, La cuestion de Panama,\n\np. 36; Otero, Panama, pp. 13, 36, 38, 43; Martinez D., A proposito, pp. 454-\n\n455; Nieto C, Por que, pp. 177-178; Rivas, Historia diplomdtica, pp. 580-597,\n\npassim.; Puentes, Historia del Partido Liberal, p. 556; Victor M.

Alvaro\n\nRebolledo summarized resentment of such treatment in these sharp\n\nwords: After the events of November, 1903, there followed \"... a\n\ncampaign of injuries and diatribes against the Colombian government\n\nand people, which Mr. Roosevelt undertook without even a token of\n\njustice or gentlemanliness.

But, the supreme confirmation of the Colombian position came\n\nfrom the lips of Roosevelt himself, in a speech of March 23, 1911,\n\nwhen he boasted that \"I took the Canal Zone and let Congress de-\n\nbate.\" 96 One can easily lose count of the Colombian writers who quoted\n\nthis \"shameless,\" \"proud,\" \"unmuffled\" confession as the final word\n\non Roosevelt's role in the revolt. 97 But, had the other factors not\n\n95 Resena, p. 255.

Some, as suggested above, have\n\nskirted the problem by referring impersonally to \"the Americans,\" \"the\n\nUnited States,\" or \"the American government.\" Only a restricted few,\n\nhowever, have specifically linked Roosevelt's policy to the will of the\n\nAmerican majority. Daniel Ortiz and Rafael Galvis, writing in 1920\n\nbefore the ratification of the Thomson-Urrutia Treaty, noted that those\n\nColombians who sought to label Roosevelt the exclusive planner and\n\nperpetrator of the \"crimen monstruoso\" overlooked the fact that later\n\nadministrations, despite the efforts of a few honest diplomats, had\n\nnot made reparation and therefore had aligned themselves with Roose-\n\nvelt, \"before God and History,\" in the completed robbery. 98 Alavaro\n\nRebolledo and Raimundo Rivas both conceded that some Americans\n\ncontinued \"to raise eloquent voices in defense of justice,\" 99 but like-\n\nwise observed that the American people had given Roosevelt \"a vote\n\nof confidence\" by returning him to the Presidency. 100\n\nIn contrast, I have found only one Colombian, an anonymous\n\neditor in Manizales, who has attempted to see Roosevelt in any context\n\nother than that of the narrow story of Panama or in the almost as\n\nnarrow history of American imperialism. Commenting on Roosevelt's\n\nsuccess at Portsmouth in ending the Russo-Japanese War, this lonely\n\nsoul wrote:\n\nHow strange are the vicissitudes of destiny! Never did I\n\nimagine that he who humiliated my country would one day\n\nawaken in me a spirit of admiration and respect.

It is not that the Colombians\n\nhave failed to react vigorously toward the United States because they\n\nhave believed that Roosevelt was totally guilty and all other Americans\n\ntotally innocent of complicity in the \"rape of the Isthmus.\" Traditional\n\nsympathy for American ideals, institutions, and achievements, has\n\nweighed heavily against the incongruous behavior of an American\n\nadministration which, Colombians have argued, did not represent the\n\nAmerican people. Rather, it seems, that the embodiment of Colombian\n\nfrustrations in the personage of Theodore Roosevelt has permitted\n\npast and present generations to vent their hostilities toward the United\n\nStates without taking up arms or displaying open bitterness and has\n\nprovided them, at the same time, with an implicit explanation for the\n\nlack of just such a vigorous anti-American policy a lack which, if\n\nallowed to go unexplained, would represent a blot on Colombian na-\n\ntional character and honor.\n\nA clearer understanding of the true' extent of American support\n\nfor Roosevelt might have created greater tensions in United States-\n\nColombian relations for a while. One doubts that this would have\n\nmattered much in the long run. In fact, a judicious appraisal of\n\nRoosevelt as scholar and statesman, as well as scoundrel, might have\n\ngenerated some appreciation among Colombians for the American point\n\nof view. Of more importance is a wide-spread, realistic awareness of\n\nthose domestic factors, discussed in the opening paragraphs, which\n\nhampered effective, concerted action. If understood they might have\n\nunited Colombians and stirred them to more selfless, constructive\n\nefforts at national progress.

Castroism (or Fidelismo to the Latin Americans)\n\nembodied much that was longed for by the frustrated Latin American\n\nintellectuals and masses. There is no doubt that the impact of Castro\n\nhas lessened notably since the 1959-60 period but there is also no doubt\n\nthat he has significantly contributed to the fundamental altering of poli-\n\ncies in Latin America and he remains a force that must be reckoned\n\nwith.\n\nCastro's policies have produced both advantageous and unfavorable\n\neffects and reactions within Latin America. Some of the developments\n\nthat have occurred in Latin America since the rise of Castro are rather\n\nreadily traceable to Castroism, but in others the relationship is more\n\ntenuous and perhaps the trend or development would have occurred\n\nregardless of Castro but his presence has served as a catalyst to ac-\n\ncelerate the particular process.\n\nDespite the fact that Castro has had some fundamentally adverse\n\neffects on the economies of the Latin American countries, his programs\n\nand policies, and the reactions that they have engendered, have con-\n\ntributed substantially to the amelioration of certain socio-economic con-\n\nditions in the region. The beneficial effects: (1) greatly augmented\n\nUnited States assistance and interest in Latin America, (2) increased\n\nattention to social services and attempts at socio-economic reforms,\n\n( 3 ) revision of the United States sugar quota and some expansion as an\n\nexport market, and (4) increased tourism.\n\n*Chairman, Department of Geography, University of Calgary,\n\nAlberta, Canada.\n\n22\n\nUnited States Assistance & Interest in Latin America. In the post-\n\nWorld War II period the United States became actively involved in\n\nthe reconstruction of Western Europe and Japan in the late 1940's\n\nand this was followed by the Korean conflict and the organization of\n\nmilitary alliances. For about the first decade and a half of the post-war\n\nperiod the economic and military resources of the United States were\n\ndirected to the Eurasian region with scant interest given to Latin Ameri-\n\nca. This was a notable letdown to the latter region because of the atten-\n\ntion it had received in the pre-war and war periods. As a result of\n\npost-war circumstances, Latin America received a gradually declining\n\nshare of both United States foreign trade and foreign investments. In\n\nthe 1945-52 period less than 2 percent of foreign assistance was devoted\n\nto Latin America and nearly a fifth of this aid was military (Table 1).\n\nDuring the Eisenhower Administration (1953-60) total assistance\n\nto Latin America increased to more than 6 percent of the world total\n\nbut the proportion of military grants remained about the same high\n\nlevel as during the Truman Administration (1945-52). Until relatively\n\nrecently the United States government placed the emphasis for economic\n\ndevelopment in Latin America on private capital and private business\n\nefforts. Stress was placed on establishing stability and a favorable in-\n\nvestment climate, even to the degree of supporting military and dicta-\n\ntorial regimes. In the realm of socio-economic development little leader-\n\nship was provided in helping Latin America alleviate its fundamental\n\nproblems and little attention was given (e.g., at the 1954 Caracas\n\nconference) to these pressing problems. The United States, in turn,\n\nwas more interested in the hemisphere problems of stability, security\n\nand anti-communism.\n\nThe deteriorating political and economic conditions of the 1950s\n\ncombined with United States policy in Latin America also exacerbated\n\nsocial conditions. The degree of alienation from the Latin American\n\nmasses was dramatically illuminated with the attacks on Vice-President\n\nNixon in Lima and Caracas in May, 1958. In the remaining two and\n\na half years the Eisenhower Administration moved (apparently reluct-\n\nantly in view of its attitude toward economic development and com-\n\nmitments to other world regions) toward a greater involvement and\n\ncontribution to Latin American affairs. Although immediate significant\n\n23\n\noutlays of funds were not made available, the United States finally ac-\n\ncepted the concept of the Inter- American Development Bank and was\n\nalso prepared to provide loans for social development programs. Latin\n\nAmerica had long favored the establishment of a regional development\n\nbank and had pressured the United States government to provide assist-\n\nance for necessary social development projects. Because of the urgent\n\ndemands for capital and the difficulties encountered in loan repayment,\n\nLatin America (along with other underdeveloped regions) favored the\n\nestablishment of \"soft\" loans and fewer restrictions on where loan ex-\n\npenditures could be made. To satisfy the demands for \"soft\" loans\n\nand less conventional terms for loans to underdeveloped regions, the\n\nUnited States established the Development Loan, Fund in 1958. In 1961\n\nan international institution, the International Development Association\n\nwhich was affiliated with the World Bank was founded. However,\n\nUnited States loans have become increasingly more tied to purchases\n\nwithin the higher-priced United States market due to United States\n\nbalance-of-payments difficulties and Congressional reluctance to pro-\n\nvide more liberalized aid conditions.\n\nA few months before Castro gained control of Cuba, President\n\nJuscelino Kubitschek promised (August 1958) a grandiose long-range\n\nplan \"Operation Pan America\" that proposed to rapidly increase both\n\nprivate and public investment and stimulate economic development of\n\nthe region. This idea was received with some United States interest but\n\nCastro's proposal in April 1959 at Buenos Aires that Latin American\n\ndevelopment be underwritten by $30-40 billion over a decade was\n\nrejected by the United States delegation.\n\nBy the time Castro assumed power, the United States had liberal-\n\nized its attitude somewhat regarding assistance to Latin America and\n\nhad made some concessions in the direction that they favored. With\n\nthe rise of Castro the pressure for socio-economic reforms and develop-\n\nment became considerably greater and as the Cuban revolution assumed\n\nan ever-more radical posture the threat of similar revolutions erupting\n\nin Latin America became a paramount consideration in Latin American\n\npolicy. By the Act of Bogota in September I960 the United States was\n\nformally committed to contribute to Latin America's social progress\n\nand Latin America, in turn, promised to undertake basic socio-economic\n\n24\n\nreforms. In March 1961, President Kennedy announced the Alliance\n\nfor Progress and the program was formally inaugurated at the Punta\n\ndel Este conference that August.\n\nIn the 1961-65 period the amount of net United States foreign\n\nassistance to Latin America amounted to $3.4 billion and slightly exceed-\n\ned all aid given by the United States in the post-war period through\n\nI960 (Table 1). The proportion of the total world assistance by the\n\nUnited States that Latin America received doubled to more than 14 per-\n\ncent from the Eisenhower period. Latin America was receiving under\n\nthe Alliance more than $350 million annually above the level received\n\nunder President Eisenhower and military grants to Latin America ex-\n\ncept for the 1960-62 period were no greater than those received during\n\nthe latter part of the Eisenhower Administration. Despite this increased\n\nassistance, Latin America still does not reecive as much non-military\n\nassistance as the Middle East to say nothing of the Orient (Table 2).\n\nPrivate business was to contribute approximately $300 million\n\nannually (of the United States' $1 billion annual share of the Alliance\n\nfor Progress total annual investment of $10 billion) in investment in\n\nLatin America. 1 However, the net capital outflow from the United\n\nStates of direct investments in Latin America in the 1961-65 period\n\naveraged only about $100 million annually or one-third of the private\n\ninvestment projected as necessary (Table 3). This reluctance to invest\n\nin Latin America in the early 1960s stems in large part from the in-\n\nstability generated by Castroism. The nationalization of nearly one\n\nbillion dollars of United States investments in Cuba (one-ninth of\n\nLatin American total) was a potent factor in discouraging capital flow\n\ninto the region. Although gradually, with State Department encourage-\n\nment and stimulus, net private capital outflow to Latin America gradu-\n\nally increased from 1962 onward so that by 1965 about half of the\n\n1 Simon G. Hanson, \"The Alliance for Progress: The Fourth Year.\" Inter-\n\nAmerican Economic Affairs. Vol. 20, No. 2 (Autumn 1966), p. 71; J. War-\n\nren Nystorm and Nathan A. Haverstock, The Alliance for Progress. (New\n\nJersey, 1966), pp. 22-23.\n\n25\n\nprojected target investment of the Alliance was achieved. More than\n\never, United States investors in Latin America in recent years have been\n\nrelying on undistributed subsidiary earnings (i.e., reinvestment of\n\nprofits) rather than on net capital inflow (i.e., investment of new capi-\n\ntal). Furthermore, in the 1954-59 period about one-tenth of all United\n\nStates net capital outflow to Latin America for direct investments was\n\ndestined for Cuba ($40 million) and as a result of Castro this capital\n\ncan now be diverted to other countries. During the 1950's overall,\n\nthe average annual net inflow of all foreign capital into Cuba was more\n\nthan $70 million ( less than 7 percent of the total entering Latin Ameri-\n\nca), so that Cuba no longer competes for a significant portion of foreign\n\ncapital that would be invested in Latin America.\n\nClearly the greatest beneficiaries of United States non-military\n\nassistance under the Alliance for Progress have been Brazil and Chile\n\nwhich have accounted for one-half of all United States net assistance\n\nto Latin America ( Table 2 ) . A second group, including Colombia, the\n\nDominican Republic, Bolivia, Venezuela, and Argentina, has received\n\nnearly one-third of United States assistance in the 1961-65 period.\n\nMexico, which is frequently cited as a model for development and an\n\nexample for the remainder of Latin America, has received very little\n\nUnited States assistance indeed under the Alliance.\n\nAnother side effect perhaps of Castroism is that in Latin America\n\nthere is increasing national participation in the control of foreign in-\n\ndustries. Probably the most significant example of this is the current\n\nprocess of the \"Chileanization\" of the copper industry under the Chris-\n\ntian Democratic President Eduardo Frei Montalva.\n\nSocio-Economic Reforms & Social Services. One of the fundamen-\n\ntal cornerstones of both Castroism and the Alliance for Progress is the\n\nformulation of basic socio-economic reforms. Relatively little attention\n\nwas given to these basic necessities of modernization until the Cuban\n\nRevolution centered upon radical measures to change the structure of\n\nboth society and the economy. The need for basic change was recog-\n\nnized in the Alliance and by early 1966 fairly extensive agrarian reform\n\nprograms, all initiated prior to the Alliance, had been implemented in\n\nMexico, Bolivia, and Venezuela and nine other Latin American coun-\n\n26\n\ntries had undertaken initial measures in this direction, 2 However, even\n\nthe more established programs are not comprehensive enough and are\n\nseriously lacking in capital and technical assistance. The best they have\n\nbeen able to do so far is prevent the rural situation from deteriorating\n\nas rapidly as it had been in the past. For example, Venezuela in more\n\nthan seven years (1958-65) has only distributed 6.25 million acres\n\n(less than a tenth of the farmland) to about 114,000 families (less\n\nthan a third of all rural families). 3 The near futility of these endeavors,\n\nin view of the very rapid population growth, can be viewed in the\n\nperspective that during the above period the number of rural families\n\nin Venezuela probably increased by about sixty thousand. In Mexico,\n\nwhere a significant and profound land program was implemented\n\n( at least that appears to be a belief widely held in the United States ) ,\n\nless than 2 percent of the landholdings account for more than three-\n\nquarters of the total farmland in I960. 4\n\nAt least nine Latin American countries had adopted tax reform\n\nlegislation by early 1966 in order to establish a more equitable fiscal\n\nsystem. Apparently this has resulted in improved tax structures and\n\nsignificantly increased collected governmental revenues. 5 Virtually all\n\nof the countries for which central government budget accounts are\n\navailable (excludes Nicaragua, Cuba, Paraguay, and Uruguay), indi-\n\ncate a generally greater reliance on taxes on income and wealth ( except\n\nArgentina, Ecuador, and Brazil) in the mid-1960s than during the\n\nprevious decade. 6 The inequities in the fiscal structure of Latin Ameri-\n\nca generally are of a large magnitude. It was estimated in late 1965\n\nthat the top 5 percent income group in Latin America overall accounted\n\nfor two-fifths of the total income and although this group should con-\n\n2 Agency for International Development, Proposed Economic Assistance Pro-\n\ngrams: FY 1967: Summary Presentation to the Congress.

Peru, Mexico, and Venezuela have exhibited the\n\nmost marked increases devoted to the social services and these have\n\njoined Panama, Honduras and Costa Rica as the only countries of the\n\nregion that contribute more than one-third of the central governmental\n\nbudget to the social services. In all of the above countries the budget\n\nfor education alone exceeds that of the military and the same holds\n\ntrue for El Salvador, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile, and probably Guatemala.\n\nOnly two countries, Colombia and Haiti, during the 1960s moved in\n\nthe direction of further sacrificing social services for greater military\n\nexpenditures.\n\nUnited States Sugar Quota & Trade. One of the major steps in\n\nthe escalation of the United States-Cuban conflict that had important\n\neconomic repercussions for Latin America was the suspension of the\n\nCuban sugar quota in July I960 by President Eisenhower. Cuba, by\n\nfar the world leading sugar exporter, had been providing slightly more\n\nthan a third (35.3 percent in the 1955-59 period) of all the sugar\n\nconsumed in the United States. 6 The seven other Latin American coun-\n\ntries exporting sugar to the United States prior to I960 (Table 5)\n\ncontributed less than a tenth of the Cuban tonnage. This sugar entered\n\nthe highly preferred market at a price (\"quota premium\") approxi-\n\nmately 2c more per pound than the world market price. This is in\n\nreality a subsidy to all sugar producers selling under the United States\n\nquota, although it was intended to protect domestic producers. This\n\nextra premium payment in 1959 to Cuba amounted to $153 million\n\n7 \" 'Social Development' and 'Social Planning': A Survey of Conceptual and\n\nPractical Problems in Latin America\" in Economic Bulletin for Latin America.\n\nEconomic Commisson for Latin America.

As a result of this action against\n\nCuba the United States domestic (high cost) producers have gradually\n\nincreased their share of the total United States market from approxi-\n\nmately half in the late 1950's to three-fifths in 1964-65 (Table 5).\n\nThe Latin American countries have benefited significantly from\n\nthe suspension of the Cuban quota and have contributed between one-\n\nfifth and one-quarter of the United States total supply in 1961-63\n\nbut in the following years this proportion was reduced to less than\n\none-fifth. Obviously, Latin America was not the only region to benefit\n\nfrom this largesse because the Philippines increased its large quota and\n\nnew countries were added, notably the European West Indies, Austra-\n\nlia, South Africa, India, and Taiwan.\n\nThe permit to enter the United States sugar market presented\n\nLatin America with a nearby and relatively stable market for its third\n\nmost valuable export (after petroleum and coffee). The market is\n\nespecially lucrative if the sugar enters under the special sugar quota\n\n(generally 2-4c per pound above world market price, except in 1963),\n\nrather than the \"global\" quota (special import fee absorbs the differ-\n\nential between the United States and world market prices). This latter\n\nwas used in the 1962-65 period for the suspended Cuban quota\n\n(which by then had been reduced from approximately 3.1 million to\n\n1.6 million tons). The Latin American countries, the main beneficiaries\n\nof the reassigned Cuban quota, complained (and lobbyied persistently)\n\nand the \"global\" quota was eliminated from the Sugar Act of 1965.\n\nThe Dominican Republic, despite an augmented quota due to the\n\nreassignment of Cuba's quota, had to pay the special import duty in\n\nlate I960 and in 1961 because the United States severed relations with\n\nthe Dominican Republic in August I960 in accordance with the OAS\n\nresolution that same month condemning her for involvement in the\n\n9 Congressional Quarterly Service, Inc., Congressional Quarterly Almanac-\n\n1962. (Washington, 1963), p. 130.\n\n29\n\npolitical affairs of Venezuela. Relations were not restored until Janu-\n\nary 1962.\n\nThe greatest beneficiaries, in Latin America, of the suspension of\n\nthe Cuban sugar quota have been the Dominican Republic, Mexico,\n\nPeru, and Brazil. These four countries generally provide four-fifths of\n\nthe Latin American sugar shipped to the United States (Table 5) which\n\nwill be the case under the 1965 quota system, until it expires in 1971.\n\nThe relatively stable New York wholesale price has remained between\n\n6c and 7c per pound while the world sugar price was less than 3c per\n\npound in 1966. As a result the \"quota premium\" was between $60-70\n\nper ton and the quota for Latin America exceeded 1.6 million tons\n\nannually. This subsidy to Latin America probably is on the order of\n\n$100-115 million annually but, of course, will fluctuate with the\n\nprice differential. Not all of these payments go to foreign purses be-\n\ncause American interests control significant segments of the sugar in-\n\ndustry in at least three Latin American countries with quotas:\n\n% of milling capacity oumed by United States interests 10\n\nDominican Republic 30\n\nPeru 25\n\nHaiti (small quota) 84\n\nCuba (up to 1959) 36\n\nThe cessation of trade between Cuba and the United States also\n\nprovided the opportunity, although a relatively small one, for other\n\nLatin American countries to substitute other commodities for those for-\n\nmerly supplied by Cuba. However, since four-fifths of Cuba's export\n\ntrade consisted of sugar, other export commodities from Cuba were\n\nrelatively of minor importance. However, for some other products\n\nthat Cuba supplied to the United States probably some of the other\n\nLatin American countries have been able to benefit to some degree by\n\nnow exporting increasing amounts of these commodities to the United\n\nStates. The more significant of these commodities would be tobacco\n\n(Cuba's second export), and some strategic minerals, e.g., nickel, cop-\n\nper, manganese, chromium, and iron ore.\n\n10 ibid., p. 130.\n\n30\n\nTourism. Travel expenditures by Americans was a significant\n\nsource of income for the Cuban economy in the pre-Castro period. In\n\nthe 1956-58 period, a quarter of a million American tourists annually\n\nvisited Cuba and their total yearly expenditures on the island amounted\n\nto nearly $40 million. ' ' There apparently was a decline of American\n\ntourism in Cuba during 1959 and it ceased in I960. It would be diffi-\n\ncult to ascertain as to where Cuba-destined tourists would now visit.\n\nIn comparing the immediate post-Castro period ( 1960-62) with that of\n\nthe late 1950's, the number and expenditures of American travelers to\n\nthe West Indies increased by one-half. During the 1950's and early\n\n1960's the average expenditure per traveler was on the increase so that\n\nit seems fairly safe to assume that the isolation of Cuba permitted an\n\naddition of at least $40-50 million to be spent by tourists in Middle\n\nAmerica. The Bahamas and, especially, Puerto Rico seemed to have had\n\nthe most marked increase in tourists following the rise of Castro 12\n\nThere was a relatively slight increase in the tourist trade in Barbados,\n\nJamaica, and Trinidad. It is also very possible that Mexico may have\n\nalso benefited in this way also. Haiti and the Dominican Republic\n\nhave apparently not benefited significantly from the diversion of the\n\ntourist trade from Cuba because of the political nature of the regimes\n\nand their instability. They have had difficulty or have not been able to\n\nmaintain their earlier levels of tourism.\n\nConclusion & Prospects\n\nPrecisely how much effect Fidel Castro and his policies have had\n\non the economies of the Latin American countries is difficult to gauge.\n\nThat he has basically altered or helped modify economic conditions in\n\nthe region appears to be abundantly clear.

This con-\n\nstituted a considerable drain on the region's resources combined with\n\nincreasing demands for greater military expenditures and assistance\n\nin order to preserve stability and counteract \"communism\" (i.e., almost\n\nany movement advocating fundamental change and threatening the\n\nstatus quo, especially if an authoritarian regime is in power). On the\n\ncredit side, one must consider the significant increase in United States\n\nforeign assistance (more than a third of a billion dollars more an-\n\nnually), despite the fact that one-ninth of all net assistance consists of\n\nmilitary grants. The reallocation of the sugar quota provides Latin\n\nAmerica with a quota premium of at least $100 million in addition to\n\nreceiving the world market price for the sugar and diversion of United\n\nStates tourism from Cuba probably adds about half again that amount.\n\nThere already was an evolving growth and commitment of United\n\nStates assistance to Latin America during the last stage of the Eisen-\n\nhower Administration and probably under President Kennedy this\n\ntrend would have accelerated. How willing Congress would have been\n\nto appropriate large sums to Latin America without the threat of Castro\n\nis questionable. In the spring of 1967, despite the waning of the\n\nthreat of Castro, the Johnson Administration is willing to allocate\n\nconsiderably larger sums for Latin America, but Congress does not\n\nconcur. In recent years appropriations to Latin America have increased\n\nslightly but the augmenting pressures of the Vietnam conflict, balance-\n\nof-payments difficulties, and increasing Congressional disquietude\n\nregarding the efficacy of foreign economic assistance is certainly not\n\nencouraging from the Latin American perspective.\n\n32\n\nThe philosophy of the Alliance for Progress has deviated from its\n\noriginal conception in two important respects. The multilateral leader-\n\nship, such as it was, has in practice been notably restricted during the\n\nJohnson Administration. The resignation in April 1966 of the Panel\n\nof Nine which reviewed national development plans and provided ad-\n\nvisory planning assistance was a result of the apparent approach of the\n\nJohnson Administration and the prevailing Congressional attitude that\n\nfavored greater United States assertion in the hemisphere. The other\n\nfounding and more important concept that has been relegated to a\n\nsecondary role in recent years is that of fundamental socio-economic\n\nreforms. Undoubtedly, given the socio-economic structure of Latin\n\nAmerica, basic reforms of this nature are extremely difficult to im-\n\nplement, although numerous reform acts have passed many of the\n\nnational legislatures. The current emphasis for the solution or im-\n\nprovement of Latin American problems is that of a common market.\n\nThis approach was strongly advocated at Punta del Este (April 1967)\n\nbecause of augmented trade among five small Central American coun-\n\ntries. However, the Latin American Free Trade Association has en-\n\ncountered considerable difficulties of both a political and economic\n\nnature.\n\nDespite the renewed interest in Latin America the region continues\n\nto receive a declining share of United States foreign trade and invest-\n\nment. Latin America, through the Alliance for Progress and other pro-\n\ngrams, now receives a larger share of United States foreign assistance\n\nbut like many other programs may be subject to reductions and re-\n\nstrictions should the Vietnam War continue and escalate. Although\n\nLatin America has sought United States economic assistance, in the\n\nform of the long-term, low-interest, \"soft\" loans, one of Latin Ameri-\n\nca's most pressing and persistent requests has been for the price stabili-\n\nzation of primary commodities the United States has been reluctant or\n\nunable to provide. Price fluctuations of these commodities combined\n\nwith the general downward trend since 1954 and the general upward\n\ntrend of prices of industrial goods has produced a severe strain on Latin\n\nAmerica. If in 1964 the price levels of 1954 had prevailed for Latin\n\nAmerica's exports and imports, the additional regional income would\n\n33\n\nhave amounted to $2.2 billion. 13 In contrast, in 1964 total net United\n\nStates capital outflow for direct investments and economic and military\n\nassistance to Latin America was approximately $800 million. The loss,\n\ntherefore, to Latin America because of fluctuations in commodity\n\nprices is prodigious, especially in view of the importance of the foreign\n\ntrade sector to underdeveloped regions as a potential source of securing\n\ncapital.\n\nCuba has no chance of securing a sugar quota or receiving Ameri-\n\ncan tourists until the relations between the two countries improves.\n\nHowever, the benefits accruing to Latin America from the United\n\nStates sugar quota may not last indefinitely. Although it will be a\n\nlong time before Cuba regains its former sugar quota the increasing\n\nopposition to the present sugar quota system due to expire in 1971 and\n\nthe defeat of Representative Harold D. Cooley (D, NC, longtime\n\nChairman of the House Agriculture Committee) in the spring 1966\n\nprimary, may lead to the revamping of the quota system. Perhaps\n\nthe largesse will not be passed on to foreign producers and prices to\n\nthe United States consumers will decrease.\n\nPressure in many parts of Latin America continues to increase as\n\nthe population growth is relentless and the rate of increase will proba-\n\nbly be augmented still further before meaningful fertility control can\n\nbe implemented. The very rapid urban influx, without corresponding\n\neconomic opportunities, creates a serious social and political problem\n\nthat will erupt sporadically and may actually produce more profound\n\nupheavals such as occurred in Mexico, Guatemala, Bolivia, and Cuba.\n\nThe rate of economic development is inadequate in many countries,\n\nespecially (among the larger countries) Brazil and Colombia, and\n\nseveral small countries (viz., Dominican Republic, Haiti, Uruguay,\n\nCosta Rica, Ecuador, and Paraguay). The race between food and\n\npopulation is even more crucial and more immediate. Here the problem\n\nis most critical in Haiti, Dominican Republic, Chile, Costa Rica, Bolivia,\n\nis Economic Survey of Latin America: 1964. Economic Commission for Latin\n\nAmerica. 1966. Based on data from Table 224. Primary commodity prices (ex-\n\nports from Latin America) were slightly higher in 1963 and 1964 than in pre-\n\nceding years.\n\n34\n\nBrazil, Paraguay, and Peru. Inflation is a serious problem in Brazil,\n\nChile, Argentina, and Colombia, while balance-of-payments problems\n\nespecially plague Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Uru-\n\nguay, Costa Rica, and Haiti. The hope is that United States assistance\n\ncombined with the programs of the more democratic and popularly\n\nsupported regimes in Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Uru-\n\nguay, and Costa Rica, will be sufficient to restrain the radical and\n\nreactionary extremist elements. There is apparently guerilla and terrorist\n\nactivity in Guatemala, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, and the\n\nDominican Republic but other countries are always vulnerable. Perhaps\n\nthe next charismatic leader with a radical program will convince the\n\nLatin American elite and the United States of the dire necessity of\n\nfundamental reforms so that for the Latin American upper classes to\n\nhave things remain the way they are they must change.\n\n35\n\nTABLE 1\n\nUNITED STATES NET FOREIGN ASSISTANCE (1945-65)*\n\n($m)\n\nWorld Lat.

Alternatively, such forces\n\nmay be instrumental as the impetus which triggers subsequent action.\n\nBut in spite of the great improvements in growth, decay, and cycle\n\nmodels which have resulted from inclusion of random shocks through\n\nthe application of probability theory, we know little about such shocks\n\nthemselves. An understanding of the nature and magnitude of shock\n\nforces can be obtained only from case analysis provided by these\n\nevents themselves.\n\nThis paper records almost entirely from primary sources' the\n\nshock forces and their aftermath from \"the North Coast Strike\" which\n\ntook place in 1954 against operations of the United Fruit Company in\n\nHonduras. In that country the events of this year are remembered as\n\ncatastrophes which underlay the subsequent development of serious\n\nbottlenecks in supply, temporary inflation, and a lack of investment\n\n*Professor and Chairman, Department of Economics and Finance, Louisiana\n\nState University in New Orleans.\n\n' The author is indebted to the Social Science Research Council for fellow-\n\nship support which allowed for field work in the affected zones of Honduras\n\nduring the summer of 1957.

This section specified eight hours\n\nas a normal work day and six such days as a normal work week. Women\n\nand children were excluded from unhealthful and dangerous work\n\n(although definitive standards for \"unhealthful\" and \"dangerous\"\n\nwere not provided) and from night work. Children under twelve years\n\nof age were forbidden to work, and those between the ages of twelve\n\nand sixteen years were limited to working not more than six hours\n\nper day. In order to curtail the practice of paying in kind or in script\n\nredeemable only at the commissaries owned and operated by the em-\n\nployer, payment of all wages in the national currency was required. A\n\nfinal article specified that large industrial enterprises were obligated\n\nto establish hospitals at the site of their operations in order\n\nto care for workers who became ill or who met with accidents. No pro-\n\nvisions were included for a supervisory agency to enforce these articles,\n\n2 Banco Central de Honduras, Memoria, 1954 (Tegucigalpa: Banco Central\n\nde Honduras, 1955), especially pp. 5-10 and 22-23, and the following report,\n\nBanco Central de Honduras, Memoria, 1955-1956 . . . , pp. 7, 16, 18-24, and\n\n30-32.\n\n3 See Richard A.

This\n\ndecree provided that holiday workers would receive double time pay.\n\nDuring 1952 two new labor laws were added which further defined\n\nworking conditions for women and children (Ley de Trabajo de Men-\n\nores y Mujeres) and which provided indemnization for certain occu-\n\npational hazards and for accidents resulting from the negligence of em-\n\nployers (Ley de Acrid entes de Trabajo). Separate legislation estab-\n\nlished the Direction General de Trabajo y Prevision Social, which spent\n\nmost of its early years hearing workmen's compensation cases.\n\nIn spite of these enactments the Honduran labor market remained\n\nlargely laissez-faire. Prior to 1955 unions had no legal standing, and\n\ngovernment officials sided strongly with management. In the banana\n\nzones the United Fruit Company's Honduran subsidiary, the Tela\n\nRailroad Company, conducted its labor relations entirely through the\n\nsupervisors directly in charge of each job. There was almost no senior\n\nsupervision from management as long as output of the appropriate\n\nquality arrived on schedule. Grievances were settled by the immediate\n\nsuperior of the complaining worker. Most issues never even reached the\n\nears of higher administrators because the workers feared, not without\n\nreason, that going over the heads of immediate supervisors eventually\n\nmight cost them their jobs.\n\nIndeed, the management compounded its problems by sending\n\nsome of its tactless foreign employees to the Honduran Division, where\n\n4 Jorge Fidel Duron, A Statement of the Laws of Honduras in Matters Af-\n\nfecting Business in Its Various Aspects and Activities (Washington: Inter-\n\nAmerican Development Commission, 1947), p. 49; Praxedes Martines Sifva.,\n\n\"El problema economico del trabajo en Honduras,\" Tesis de grado, Univer-\n\nsidad de Honduras, agosto de 1955, p. 63, citing [Honduras], Constitution\n\nPolitica y Leyes Constitutivas (Tegucigalpa: Talleres Tipograficos Nacionales,\n\n1936), pp. 32-33, \"Titulo XII Del Trabajo y de la Familia.\"\n\n43\n\ncourteous treatment of the common worker appeared to be unnecessary.\n\nIn Company circles it was said that if a man were thrown out of Guate-\n\nmala, Costa Rica, or Panama, he always could be given a job in Hon-\n\nduras. To their credit most of the managerial personnel of the Tela\n\nRailroad Company were willing by 1957 to admit the deficiencies of\n\ntheir labor policy (or lack of one) prior to May, 1954. As one of the\n\nsuperintendents put it: \"I can't blame these people. We were just ask-\n\ning for a strike, but none of us really thought they could do it!\"\n\nThe Strike\n\nWhen the author visited the Tela Railroad Company during May\n\nand June, 1957, Company officials still spoke with awe of the efficiency\n\nwith which the strike had been organized three years before. The dispute\n\nbegan early in April, 1954, when wharf workers at Puerto Cortes ad-\n\nvanced the claim that the double time holiday pay provided by Decree\n\nNumber 96 of March, 1949, applied also to Sunday work. Company\n\nofficials rejected this claim and dismissed one of the workers who had\n\nbeen most active in pressing it. In protest the workers left their jobs.\n\nThe Company's response was an attempt to re-route its foreign trade\n\nthrough the nearby port of Tela, but the longshoremen and stevedores\n\nat Tela struck in sympathy with those at Puerto Cortes. At this juncture\n\nthe government intervened with a promise to settle the question satis-\n\nfactorily within fifteen days. The workers returned to their jobs, but\n\nafter a lapse of fifteen days no solution was in evidence.\n\nIn the meanwhile separate dissatisfactions were brewing among\n\nworkers in the Company hospital at Tela. These workers left their\n\njobs over a grievance with the medical superintendent. Again the gov-\n\nernment intervened with the promise of a solution in fifteen days. This\n\ntime there was opposition to the proposal, and those who were unwill-\n\ning to accept it were imprisoned.\n\nToward the end of the month workers in other departments joined\n\nin protesting their working conditions, and several letters were dis-\n\npatched to the manager's office requesting wage and salary increases,\n\n44\n\nfree hospital care, and numerous other fringe benefits. None of these\n\nletters received a reply. Workers in the construction and engineering de-\n\npartments at Progreso then sent a joint petition to the manager in which\n\nthey indicated that relations would be worsened greatly if they were\n\nnot given the courtesy of a reply to their previous demands. An oblique\n\nreply appeared on April 28, when the manager's office issued a state-\n\nment that further work in the construction and engineering depart-\n\nments would be purchased by the piece, not by the hour or by the\n\nmonth as previously. The next day workers in those departments dis-\n\npatched notes to their respective superintendents saying that they would\n\nnot work under the new system.\n\nOn May 1 Honduras' first celebration of Labor Day was held in\n\nProgreso's Parque Ramon Rosa. It began as a small, informal gathering.\n\nBy afternoon it was a massive crowd which marched through the city's\n\nstreets singing patriotic songs and chanting anti-American slogans. One\n\nglowering group surrounded a Protestant mission on the outskirts of\n\nthe city. When the minister protested that he had nothing to do with\n\nthe Company, their sullen answer was: \"Yes, but you speak their lang-\n\nuage!\"\n\nThe next day the construction and engineering workers agreed\n\nto amplify their demands and to stop work. The strike began on Mon-\n\nday, May 3. By May 6 only the railroad workers remained on the job in\n\nProgreso. Large numbers of farm laborers began to migrate into the\n\ncity to join the strikers, and by May 9 an estimated 13,000 persons had\n\nbeen added to Progreso's normal population of 5,000. The railway\n\nworkers joined the strike, and the movement generali2ed rapidly to the\n\nother Company centers at La Lima, Bataan, Tela, and Puerto Cortes.\n\nOnce again the government offered to settle all strike issues within fif-\n\nteen days. The offer went unheeded.\n\nBy this time the strikers were highly organized. Workers in each\n\ndepartment had met to select their strike committees {Comites de\n\nHuelga) , and these representatives in turn had met at Progreso to elect\n\na Comite Central de Huelga. The speed and efficiency with which the\n\norganization progressed led some observers to believe that the strikers\n\n45\n\nwere receiving assistance from labor leaders in Guatemala. 5 Timing\n\ncontributed to their suspicions, for during this same period the forces\n\nof Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas were massing in northwestern Hon-\n\nduras for their June invasion of Guatemala. To have paralyzed any\n\npart of the area in which they were concentrating would certainly have\n\nbenefited the Arbenz regime.\n\nHowever, the available evidence is all circumstantial. The author\n\nwas unable to find anyone who could give specific names, dates, and\n\nplaces for the supposed aid from Guatemala. Honduran labor leaders\n\ncategorically deny that there ever was any. They attribute the efficiency\n\nof the strike organization to the presence of many semi-skilled and\n\nskilled workers in its leadership. Regardless of the truth, it is known\n\nthat the Honduran government feared the possibility of a revolution\n\nstemming from the strike, and the administration of President Juan\n\nManuel Galvez acted rapidly to create a mediatory commission to meet\n\nwith the parties to the dispute. The talks were held in San Pedro Sula.\n\nOn May 11 the strikers made known their specific demands in a\n\npetition addressed to the manager of the Tela Railroad Company. This\n\npetition contained thirty separate points, of which the most important\n\nwere respect for the right to organize and bargain collectively, a pledge\n\nthat no reprisals would be taken against the strike leaders, and claims\n\nfor wage, salary, and piece work increases ranging from 30 per cent\n\nto 300 per cent of existing levels. 6\n\nCompany officials indicated that they were unprepared to discuss\n\nthese demands without thorough study. Instead, they opened the talks\n\nat San Pedro Sula by negotiating for the re-opening of certain essential\n\ns \"Banana Battle in Honduras,\" Business Week (May 22, 1954), p. 166;\n\n\"General Strike in Honduras,\" Time LXIII (May 24, 1954), p. 40. Note espec-\n\nially the comments of Mr. John Foster Dulles as reported in the latter refer-\n\nence: \"There is at least an interesting coincidence in the fact that the strikes\n\nhave occurred principally in an area to whch the Guatemalan government re-\n\ncently sent three consuls who have subsequently been declared persona non grata\n\nby the government of Honduras because of their activities.\"\n\n6 [Honduras], \"Aspectos fundamentales de la mediacion en el conflicto obrero-\n\npatronal entre la Tela Railroad Company y los trabajadores de la empresa,\"\n\nPrimera parte: \"Pliego de peticiones de los trabajadores\" (Tegucigalpa: mimeo,\n\njunio de 1955).\n\n46\n\nservices which had been terminated by the strike. The strike committee\n\nviewed this as a move to disrupt worker solidarity. For public health\n\nreasons they agreed, after lengthy debate, to re-open sewage disposal\n\nplants at the major centers, but the commissaries, electric plants, and\n\nhospitals remained closed except when operated by administrative per-\n\nsonnel. With this reaction the management claimed that the strike\n\ncommittee could not possibly be representative of the strikers at large.\n\nTo prove the contrary the committee voluntarily disbanded itself, held\n\nnew elections among the strikers, and returned to the conference table\n\nwith a fresh mandate from the rank-and-file. The services remained\n\nclosed.\n\nOn June 13, after the lapse of more than a month, the manage-\n\nment issued a formal reply to the demands of May 11. It was a brief\n\nstatement which denied the abuses alleged by the strikers and asserted\n\nthe financial impossibility of meeting their demands. The management\n\nthen offered a counterproposal of expanded fringe benefits and limited\n\nwage increases which amounted to the additional annual expenditure\n\nof L 5,172,200 ($2,586,100 at the foreign exchange rate of two lemp-\n\niras for one U. S. dollar). On June 17 the strike committee rejected this\n\noffer.\n\nFour days later the government mediators offered their own so-\n\nlution. With painstaking care th"
