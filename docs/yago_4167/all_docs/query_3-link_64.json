        "text": "In honour of the Paris 2024 Opening Ceremonies, we’re looking back to Munich 1972, when Pierre Cardin went to the Olympics. The designer created geometric jumpsuits to be worn by performers during the opening ceremonies. Here, they’re photographed modelling the bespoke looks at the Munich Olympic Stadium during the event.\n\nA dedicated supporter of the arts and member of l’Academie, Pierre Cardin first awarded the Pierre Cardin Beaux-Arts prize in 1993. Our president, Rodrigo Cardin, has maintained his legacy, recognizing five winners across five different disciplines for their work. On July 17th, Rodrigo Cardin, alongside corresponding member of l’Academie and commissioner of the exhibition, Lydia Harambourg celebrated the opening with the 2023 winner of the Pierre Cardin prize for architecture, Guillaume Ramillien. The selected pieces of our winners are currently exhibited at the Château du Marquis de Sade until October 10th as a part of the Festival Pierre Cardin. To learn more about the award, the exhibition, and the festival, visit https://lnkd.in/ehbY7Y2G #festival #arts #culture #france\n\nOften imitated, never replicated. Obsessed with geometry, and particularly, the circle, Pierre Cardin created his first hoop dress in 1970, and the style became a house code through the 1980s into the new millenium. Many designers have taken inspiration from his space age silhouette, and today the brand upholds its heritage, reimagining the hoop dress in contemporary Cardin collections for the next generation.\n\nHELLO LACOSTE! Tomorrow kicks off the 24th edition of the Festival Pierre Cardin in the historic village of Lacoste, France. The culture festival celebrates artists and filmmakers alike, featuring a number of performances across multiple disciplines including ballet, music, and theatre, as well as musical film screenings. Each year, the Festival Pierre Cardin also awards a number of artists for their work, as well as short film directors. To learn more about the festival, and to purchase tickets, visit https://lnkd.in/ehbY7Y2G #festival #arts #culture #france\n\nWe’ve landed on Vogue World. A part of the 1960s segment of the show, our futurist gown from the S/S 24 collection affirms our dedication to brand heritage, reinterpreting the geometric codes that Cardin pioneered during the space age."
