        "text": "Welcome! I hope the spring break provided a good opportunity for some rest and relaxation amid a busy semester. The MSU Libraries has also seen a lively term, and as we look ahead I wanted to take a moment to share some important updates.Spring semester hours. Regular hours following spring break resumed Monday, March 4. The MSU Libraries is typically open 24 hours per day on Monday through Thursday, with later opening and earlier closing times on the weekends. Regular hours will shift beginning with the last class day of the spring semester on Friday, April 26, as we head into our shortened summer hours. Please note that for safety and security purposes, all students, staff and faculty are required to scan their MSU ID to access the MSU Main Library building between 10:00 p.m. and 7:30 a.m. on Sunday – Thursday. A complete schedule for the Main Library hours is available here.MSU Press director appointment. In October Elizabeth Demers was appointed director of the MSU Press. Demers comes to MSU from the University of Michigan Press, where she was hired as editorial director in 2017. She also previously held positions at Johns Hopkins University Press, Quarto Publishing and Potomac Books. Demers received undergraduate degrees in English and French from MSU as well as a master’s in comparative literature. She also earned a doctorate in history at MSU. In addition to her education at MSU, she obtained a Master of Business Administration at the University of Maryland. Demers has expressed enthusiasm about the opportunity to lead MSU Press, noting that she is “thrilled to be a part of MSU Press’s tradition of outstanding scholarship and community engagement.”Harmful Language Remediation Group. The Harmful Language Remediation Working Group (HLRWG) at MSU Libraries formed in fall 2022 with the goal of identifying, assessing and responding to harmful language issues in the MSU Libraries’ descriptive metadata. The primary role of the HLRWG is to facilitate and track harmful language remediation projects across the MSU Libraries. The group has recently developed a publicly available form that can be used to report instances of potentially harmful language in the MSU Libraries catalog. This form is available here.Building construction. In August 2022 the Libraries began working in partnership with brightspot strategy to reimagine our spaces and services to be more responsive to current and future needs of our faculty, staff and students. Several phases have already been completed while others have seen significant progress. Our new MSU Libraries Starbucks opened at the beginning of the spring semester, with updated seating in the café area as well as an option for mobile ordering, and the reconfiguration of 2-West is now also complete and home to the MSU Center for Teaching and Learning Innovation and the Office of Faculty and Academic Staff Development. Construction on 3-East to relocate our Stephen O. Murray and Keelung Hong Special Collections is progressing with plans to install shelving in April; this project phase is expected to continue into Fall 2024. Ongoing updates are available on our website at lib.msu.edu.We are looking forward to supporting your learning and research needs as we approach the end of the spring semester (and beyond!). As a reminder, if you are unable to find an answer on our website or would like to speak to someone in person, we are available at our information desks as well as by phone at (517) 353-8700.With warm wishes for a productive semester,Neil Romanosky, Ph.D. Dean of LibrariesView All News Articles\n\nEAST LANSING, Mich., July 2024 – For over 70 years, the Michigan State University Libraries’ 1535 “Ptolemy’s Geographia” was kept under wraps because of its fragile condition. Now, thanks to the work of Conservation Librarian Garrett Sumner, the rare 16th-century cartography text has been restored and made available for use.Donated to the MSU Libraries in 1951 by the E. K. Warren Foundation, “Ptolemy’s Geographia” is one of approximately 60 known copies in existence worldwide. The “Geographia” was previously collected in 1928 by Fred P. Warren of Three Oaks, Michigan, who was the son of E. K. Warren (1847-1919), a wealthy businessman noted for his development of the Warren Featherbone Company. This second edition of the eponymous “Geographia” was translated by German Renaissance lawyer, author and humorist Willibald Pirckheimer (1470-1530), with illustrations by Spanish theologian Michael Villanovanus (1511?-1553), better known as Servetus. It contains 228 pages and 49 maps with woodcut borders that some scholars have attributed to renowned Renaissance artists Hans Holbein the Younger and Urs Graf. Originally written in the 2nd century A.D., this geographical treatise was considered a standard reference until the 16th century and retained influence well into the 18th century, with various scholars and editors offering corrections to inaccuracies in the original. An inscription in the MSU Libraries copy denotes that the volume was once owned and housed by an order of priests known as the Somaschi Fathers at their home church of San Bartolomeo in Somasca, Italy. This inscription, according to Rare Books Curator Tad Boehmer, is likely from the first half of the 16th century. Boehmer, who discovered the “Geographia” in the MSU Libraries vault in 2019, noted that this text contains one of the earliest instances of the term “America” in print.“This copy of Ptolemy’s ‘Geographia’ — a fascinating text in its own right — tells some remarkable stories, from its printing in Lyon, France, by the Trechsel brothers in 1535 and its early use in Somascha, Italy, to its purchase by Fred Warren at an ‘out of the way book store’ in Milan in 1928,” Boehmer said. “In a cinematic description recorded in the Fall 1951 newsletter of the MSU Friends of the Library, due to Mussolini’s declaration that no historical documents could leave the country, Warren enlisted the help of a friendly taxi driver who attached the volume to the undercarriage of his cab, where it eluded the sight of border officials. Though it has had a home at MSU since 1951, it had been underappreciated in recent years until Garrett Sumner’s expert work to clean and repair it. Nearly half a millennium after its creation, this book now speaks to a new generation of students and scholars who visit Murray & Hong Special Collections, and will continue to do so for many more to come.” According to Sumner, when he initially received the volume from Boehmer, his first question was “Why isn’t this in quarantine?” Boehmer had retrieved the box containing the “Geographia” from the MSU Libraries vault, which holds the Libraries’ most valuable — and delicate —materials in the Stephen O. Murray & Keelung Hong Special Collections. The box, Sumner said, had a note on top warning against opening due to mold, but when he took the text out to examine it, he found that it was a “false alarm.” What he did find, however, was an immense amount of damage.“We pulled it out and found there was actually no active mold,” Sumner said. “What I saw was that the binding was completely falling apart — the covers were barely attached, the sewing was frayed throughout, the leather sewing supports used to connect the leaves, sewing, and binding together were disintegrating, the paper had numerous water tidelines from suffering multiple flood incidents, and was also heavily embedded with dirt, with tears throughout. In many places, leaves were either loose or detached from the sewing.”Additional paperwork with the “Geographia” noted that it had been previously sent to two different vendors for conservation treatment. According to Head of Conservation & Preservation Eric Alstrom, the cost to treat the rare text was quoted at over $20K in 2013.“Former Head of Special Collections Peter Berg knew the importance of this book and that it could be used by professors who brought their students to Special Collections,” Alstrom said.“But because of its poor condition, it could not be handled. Even when we would look at it with the utmost care, another folio would detach or a piece of the sewing structure would detach. At that time, the [Florence G.] Wallace Conservation Lab was not equipped to handle a project like this. We didn’t have a sink large enough to wash the pages like we do now. So, Peter and I looked to our conservation vendors for help. Twice we sent the book out to two different vendors, first in 2008 and then in 2013. Both times, the estimated cost for treatment exceeded our yearly budget. Unfortunately, we had to place the book back in the stacks in its damaged, unusable condition and wait for a donor to help or a time when our lab was upgraded and able to handle the project.”Despite the confirmation of an absence of active mold, quarantine still had a role in the historic text’s revival. Sumner, who received the “Geographia” in fall 2019, said he spent the first year under remote work stipulations thinking about how he was going to approach repairing the fragile tome.“The very first part of the process was to fully document and photograph the 'Geographia,'” Sumner explained. “Tad and I then developed a report and treatment plan for the book. In coming up with these plans, we also assess treatment options, one of those being to do absolutely nothing, and what the consequences of that option might be. In this case, the consequence of doing nothing is actually just more and more damage. Doing nothing is always an option because sometimes it's best, but in this case, we wanted to make sure that the book was usable. The final plan we landed on was basically just the full spa treatment — disbinding, washing all the pages and resizing, mending, sewing, and binding them in a new, conservation-sound binding sympathetic to the original, and finally housing the book and its original remnants in a custom enclosure.”Sumner made his first cut into the sewing of the “Geographia” in Jan. 2022., completing the text conservation treatment just ten months later. The volume was used on the first day it became available for a Topics of Art History course taught by Carol Ann Bennett-Vallès Assistant Professor of Art History and Visual Culture Silvia Tita, who emphasized its historical and contemporary relevance.“Over the centuries, ‘Ptolemy’s Geographia’ has fascinated and informed curious minds in search of practical, abstract and encyclopedic knowledge related to humans’ experience of inhabiting and understanding the earth,” Tita noted. “Preserved in various manuscripts, the 'Geographia' was published for the first time in the last quarter of the 15th century, soon after the advent of printing in Europe. The printed editions of the early modern period were equipped with maps and updated knowledge about the world. Such subsequent versions are extremely important as they attest not only to the absorption of ancient theories but more significantly to the changing of ideas and perceptions about the world. At the same time, they alert us nowadays to the duty of preserving them. The MSU Special Collections holds such a copy. Recently restored, it is a splendid pedagogical tool — as noticed firsthand during classes — for both its content and its capability of illuminating on the early stages of printing.” While access to the “Geographia” and other Special Collections materials normally requires making an appointment with the MSU Special Collections staff, select services have been put on hold as the MSU Libraries Special Collections begins the process of relocating to the third floor of the Main Library’s East Wing in August.
