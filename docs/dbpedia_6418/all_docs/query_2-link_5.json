        "text": "What Is Culture Shock?\n\nCulture shock refers to feelings of uncertainty, confusion, or anxiety that people may experience when moving to a new country or experiencing a new culture or surroundings. This cultural adjustment is normal and is the result of being in an unfamiliar environment.\n\nCulture shock can occur when people move to another city or country, such as when retiring abroad. Culture shock can also occur when people go on vacation, travel in retirement or for business, or study abroad for school. For example, international students studying abroad for a semester in another country may experience a cultural adjustment due to an unfamiliarity with the weather, local customs, language, food, and values.\n\nAlthough the timing of each person's adjustment process can be different, there are specific phases that most people go through before they adjust to their new environment. Culture shock can be quite stressful and lead to anxiety. However, it's possible to overcome it and grow as a result.\n\nUnderstanding Culture Shock\n\nCulture shock occurs when an individual leaves the comfort of their home and familiar surroundings and moves to an unfamiliar environment. The adjustment period can be fairly intense, particularly if the two locations are completely different, such as going from a small rural area to a large metropolis or moving to another country. People can also experience culture shock when moving from one place to another within the same country.\n\nTypically, no single event causes culture shock, nor does it occur suddenly or without reason. Instead, it gradually builds from a series of incidents, and culture shock can be difficult to identify while struggling with it.\n\nThe feeling is particularly intense at the beginning and can be tough to overcome. It's important to remember that the cultural adjustment usually dissipates over time as a person becomes more familiar with a place, the people, customs, food, and language. As a result, navigation of surroundings gets easier, friends are made, and everything becomes more comfortable.\n\nSymptoms of Culture Shock\n\nCulture shock can produce a range of symptoms, which can vary greatly from person to person in terms of scope and intensity. These may include:\n\nBeing homesick\n\nFeeling helpless\n\nFeeling isolated\n\nDisorientation\n\nLack of concentration\n\nIrritability\n\nSadness\n\nSleep or eating disturbances\n\nParanoia\n\nThe 4 Stages of Culture Shock\n\nPeople who experience culture shock may go through four phases that are explained below.\n\nThe Honeymoon Stage\n\nThe first stage is commonly referred to as the honeymoon phase. That's because people are thrilled to be in their new environment. They often see it as an adventure. If someone is on a short stay, this initial excitement may define the entire experience. However, the honeymoon phase for those on a longer-term move eventually ends, even though people expect it to last.\n\nThe Frustration Stage\n\nPeople may become increasingly irritated and disoriented as the initial glee of being in a new environment wears off. Fatigue may gradually set in, which can result from misunderstanding other people's actions, conversations, and ways of doing things.\n\nAs a result, people can feel overwhelmed by a new culture at this stage, particularly if there is a language barrier. Local habits can also become increasingly challenging, and previously easy tasks can take longer to accomplish, leading to exhaustion.\n\nSome of the symptoms of culture shock can include:\n\nFrustration\n\nIrritability\n\nHomesickness\n\nDepression\n\nFeeling lost and out of place\n\nFatigue\n\nThe inability to effectively communicate—interpreting what others mean and making oneself understood—is usually the prime source of frustration. This stage can be the most difficult period of cultural adjustment as some people may feel the urge to withdraw.\n\nFor example, international students adjusting to life in the United States during study abroad programs can feel angry and anxious, leading to withdrawal from new friends. Some experience eating and sleeping disorders during this stage and may contemplate going home early.\n\nThe Adaptation Stage\n\nThe adaptation stage is often gradual as people feel more at home in their new surroundings. The feelings from the frustration stage begin to subside as people adjust to their new environment. Although they may still not understand certain cultural cues, people will become more familiar—at least to the point that interpreting them becomes much easier.\n\nThe Acceptance Stage\n\nDuring the acceptance or recovery stage, people are better able to experience and enjoy their new home. Typically, beliefs and attitudes toward their new surroundings improve, leading to increased self-confidence and a return of their sense of humor.\n\nThe obstacles and misunderstandings from the frustration stage have usually been resolved, allowing people to become more relaxed and happier. At this stage, most people experience growth and may change their old behaviors and adopt manners from their new culture.\n\nDuring this stage, the new culture, beliefs, and attitudes may not be completely understood. Still, the realization may set in that complete understanding isn’t necessary to function and thrive in the new surroundings.\n\nHow to Overcome Culture Shock\n\nTime and habit help deal with culture shock, but individuals can minimize the impact and speed the recovery from culture shock.\n\nBe open-minded and learn about the new country or culture to understand the reasons for cultural differences.\n\nDon't indulge in thoughts of home, constantly comparing it to the new surroundings.\n\nWrite a journal of your experience, including the positive aspects of the new culture.\n\nDon't seal yourself off—be active and socialize with the locals.\n\nBe honest, in a judicious way, about feeling disoriented and confused. Ask for advice and help.\n\nTalk about and share your cultural background—communication runs both ways.\n\nThe Bottom Line"
