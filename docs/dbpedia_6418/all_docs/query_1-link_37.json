Each member, on average, supports another 3 girls to go to school with her own resources, as well as mentoring and encouraging many more. And as a network of activists, we create employment and opportunity, tackling inequality and injustice.\n\nThis is the CAMFED Multiplier Effect, and what Nicholas Kristof of The New York Times calls a “perpetual motion machine” — the positive impact a girl’s education has on others’ lives.\n\nDiscover CAMFED's Multiplier Effect"
