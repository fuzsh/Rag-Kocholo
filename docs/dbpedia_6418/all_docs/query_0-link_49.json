        "text": "In some places, women travelers may face extra health and security risks. Before you go, read these tips.\n\nResearch your destination, Be Aware of Local Customs and Norms\n\nCustoms and norms in other countries can be very different from those in the United States. Some countries have rules against certain behaviors or speech. Others may have different rules or expectations about women's clothing and appearance. Tight-fitting clothes, sleeveless shirts, or shorts, for example, may not be acceptable.\n\nWomen’s Health Abroad\n\nEvery country has its own healthcare system. When you travel, bring health items that might be hard to find where you're going, like feminine hygiene products or birth control.\n\nMany countries have laws that impact women's health in ways that may be different than where you live. For example, some countries make certain reproductive health services illegal. Some countries may punish women who get pregnant but are not married, including victims of sexual assault.\n\nIf you're pregnant, airlines might not let you fly in the later stages of your pregnancy. It's a good idea to have a note from your doctor saying it's safe for you to fly. Make sure your travel insurance covers pregnancy-related costs.\n\nYou can find more information on our Your Health Abroad page.\n\nPublic Transport\n\nThe safety of public transportation varies from country to country. In many places, informal taxis or minibuses can be dangerous, particularly for women traveling alone. Find out what is and is not safe from reliable sources, such as local authorities or tourism officials.\n\nConsider these transport tips:\n\nArrange transport to and from the airport before you arrive, from a licensed and reputable company.\n\nDo not hitchhike.\n\nResearch taxi and other ride share companies before you go. Make sure they are licensed and reputable.\n\nConsider using app-based transportation companies, which offer a record of your ride. This is unlike hailing a ride on the street. Some companies also allow a rider to share their real-time ride record to another phone. This record is useful to identify the vehicle and driver later.\n\nAvoid traveling in busy sections of train cars or on crowded buses. Public transportation might create opportunities for inappropriate or unwanted physical contact and makes pickpocketing easier.\n\nTravel Accommodations\n\nReview our Lodging page and also do the following:\n\nWhen registering, use your first initial and no title (don’t use “Mrs., Ms., or Miss”).\n\nDon't tell strangers where you are staying.\n\nBe Aware of Your Surroundings\n\nUse your best judgement to stay away from unsafe situations. Think ahead and come up with a safety plan to deal with unsafe situations, in the event you end up in one. Consider bringing personal safety whistles/alarms and taking self-defense courses before you travel.\n\nIn an unsafe situation, depending on the circumstances, it also may be helpful to speak loudly and draw attention to yourself to deter unwanted actions. Being safe is more important than being polite.\n\nUse facial expressions, body language, and a firm voice to fend off unwanted attention.\n\nFind out where emergency services like police stations and hospitals are located nearby in case of an emergency.\n\nGender Based Violence\n\nGender Based Violence (GBV) is violence committed against someone because of their gender. It particularly affects women and minorities all over the world. GBV can take many forms, like sexual or physical assault, domestic violence, forced marriage, female infanticide, sex and human trafficking, and other violent acts. Women travelers can be targeted for these crimes. If you are a victim of GBV, please contact the Office of Overseas Citizens Services at 1-888-407-4747. If you are overseas, call 202-501-4444. You can also contact the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.\n\nDrug Assisted Rape or “Date Rape”\n\nDrug Assisted Rape, also known as \"Date Rape,\" occurs when someone drugs another person in order to sexually assault them. Typically, the drugs are added to the victim's drink without their knowledge. Victims usually cannot tell that their drink has been drugged. Date rape drugs like Rohypnol, ketamine, and scopolamine can make a person unconscious and defenseless. Always watch your drink, and physically cover it with your hand if you can.\n\nDo not accept drinks from strangers.\n\nBe aware of how much you are drinking. Notice any unusual physical symptoms outside of intoxication.\n\nIf you start to feel strange or sick, tell a trusted friend if you can, and call emergency authorities right away. You can call the local police or the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. If you are sexually assaulted or raped, get medical care and resources. Contact the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate for information on getting help and medical care in the country you are in. They can tell you if post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is available. It's important to get medical care within 72 hours to prevent HIV and get emergency contraception. Also, there is a U.S. organization called the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network (RAINN) that helps victims of sexual assault and abuse. They can provide resources remotely or when you return to the U.S.\n\nOther sources you may want to consult:"
