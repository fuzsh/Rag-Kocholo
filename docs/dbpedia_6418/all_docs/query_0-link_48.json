        "text": "To get to Ellis Island, visitors must take a ferry from either Battery Park in Manhattan or Liberty State Park in New Jersey. Statue Cruises operates the ferry service.\n\nVisitors should note that Statue Cruises is the only authorized concessionaire permitted to sell tickets and provide ferry access to Liberty and Ellis Islands. As such, visitors should avoid street vendors peddling tickets in and around Battery Park. Tickets sold by street vendors will not provide access to the grounds on Liberty Island and Ellis Island and the museums on each island – the Statue of Liberty Museum and Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration.\n\nVisitors can tour the Main Building of the former immigration complex, which is now home to the Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration. A world class experience, the Museum is home to an evocative series of exhibits and houses an amazing collections of artifacts from America’s history.\n\nFor information about guided tours, please visit the National Park Service website.\n\nAudio tours are available inside the main entrance of the Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration for no additional cost. Content is available in 12 languages: Arabic, English, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. A family-friendly tour is also available, as are an American Sign Language (ASL) version and an Audio Descriptive (AD) version."
