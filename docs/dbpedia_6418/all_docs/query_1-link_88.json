        "text": "Zoe Saldana (born June 19, 1978, Passaic, New Jersey, U.S.) is an American actress who found her greatest success performing in science-fiction and superhero movies.\n\nSaldana spent much of her childhood in Queens, New York. However, when she was nine years old, her father died in a car accident, and she moved with her family to the Dominican Republic, her father’s home country. There she studied dance at the Ecos Espacio de Danza dance studio. When she was 17, she returned to New York City and began performing with youth theatre groups. After two small guest appearances (1999) on the television series Law & Order, Saldana was cast in a prominent role in the movie Center Stage (2000), about students at a New York City ballet school.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nShe next appeared in a series of teen flicks, including Get Over It (2001) and the Britney Spears vehicle Crossroads (2002), and then had a supporting role in the higher-profile movie Drumline (2002). Saldana had a small but memorable part as a female pirate in the surprise hit movie Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), and she played an immigration agent in Steven Spielberg’s The Terminal (2004), which starred Tom Hanks as a man forced to live in an airport terminal. For the next few years, however, Saldana appeared in only minor movies and TV fare.\n\nSaldana landed two iconic roles in 2009. She was cast as Lieut. Uhura in the movie Star Trek, which reimagined the characters of the original TV series, and, through the technique of motion capture, she embodied Neytiri—a high-ranking member of the Na’vi, a humanoid race indigenous to the exoplanetary moon Pandora—in James Cameron’s sci-fi film Avatar. Both movies were major hits. Saldana portrayed Uhura again in Star Trek into Darkness (2013) and Star Trek Beyond (2016). She also played the green-skinned warrior princess Gamora in the sci-fi/superhero blockbuster Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), a role she reprised for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019). She reprised her role as Neytiri in the box office blockbuster Avatar: The Way of Water in 2022."
