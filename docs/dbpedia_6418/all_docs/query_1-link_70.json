The Race of All Races.\n\nIn 1994, 150 gutsy riders braved 100 miles of high-altitude, extreme Rocky Mountain terrain — starting at 10,152 feet, climbing to 12,424 feet and pedaling into global cycling history. Today, the Life Time Leadville Trail 100 MTB is one of the most prestigious endurance cross-country MTB events in the world. Every year, a select handful of gritty and determined cyclists make the pilgrimage to Cloud City to Race Across the Sky and take their shot at etching their name among the Leadville Legendary. The red carpet awaits.\n\nHISTORY\n\nThe Leadville Trail 100 MTB was first held in 1994 and has since become one of the most challenging and prestigious mountain bike races in the world.

Over the years, top athletes from around the world have come to Leadville for the ultimate test of Grit, Guts and Determination, on their quest for the coveted silver and gold beltbuckle.\n\nWATCH\n\nGet ready to experience the thrill of the Leadville Race Series like never before!

See the definition of chip time vs. gun time below.\n\n9-hour cutoff time = BIG BUCKLE\n\n12-hour cutoff time = SMALL BUCKLE and official finisher\n\nCHIP TIME vs GUN TIME\n\nChip Time – your time starts when you cross the timing mat at the start, and ends when you cross the timing mat when you finish – accounting for all elapsed time on the course.\n\nGun Time – your time starts when the race starts (6:30am -6:50am).\n\nReminder – Chip time will be used to determine your belt buckle eligibility and there will be no changes to those times. Gun time will be used for course cutoffs. Cutoff times are based on a 12 hour cutoff for the last corral, White 3.\n\nNOTE: Top 5 men and women overall times will be based solely on gun time. In the event of a sprint finish for the top 5 overall, riders will be scored in the order in which they cross the finish line.\n\nRACE NUMBERS\n\nRace Numbers must be visible at all times, tied to the handlebars of your bike.\n\nDO NOT cut or fold your number – this may damage the timing chip and impact your timing data\n\nWe recognize crews as a critical component to all of our events.

Expect sunny mornings and afternoon showers, and be prepared for the Colorado high country’s volatile weather. During the race, it could rain, hail, and even snow. Lightning is hazardous, especially above the timberline. Hypothermia easily occurs with a combination of decreasing temperatures, wind and precipitation. It can result in confusion, and this can be deadly.\n\nNo matter the weather, DO NOT attempt the round trip to Columbine Mine without adequate warm and protective clothing. Remember, the Columbine Mine is at 12,600 feet.\n\nSee our complete LT100 MTB Packing List here.\n\nRACE START & TIMELINE: Please give yourself plenty of time on race day, expect there to be a lot of traffic/parking may be difficult.\n\n5:00am – Corrals open\n\nWe will be staging corrals on Harrison Ave. again in 2024\n\nCorral Start times:\n\n6:15 am – Gold/Pro Men\n\n6:20am – Gold/Pro Women\n\n6:32:30am – Silver/Red\n\n6:35am – Green\n\n6:37:30am – Purple\n\n6:40am – Orange\n\n6:42:30am – Blue\n\n6:45am – White\n\n6:47:30am – Brown 1\n\n6:50am – Brown 2\n\nNOTE: Belt buckle times are based on chip time, all corrals will have 12 hours to complete the race.\n\nCORRAL RULES\n\nNEW FOR 2024 – We have added a brown corral.\n\nRiders will be in pre-assigned color-coded corrals.

LT100 Qualifiers are long and tough, with lots of climbing. They are similar to the classic course at Leadville in that they consist mainly of rugged jeep roads of gravel and dirt. A qualifier event could not only gain you entry into the LT100 MTB, but it could also boost your corral starting position in the Race Across the Sky!\n\nRider starting positions will be organized in color-coded corrals. These positions will be based on a finish time from a previous (see corral chart) LT100 MTB finish/qualifier finish. If you race a qualifier after previously gaining entry, you MUST email Athlete Services a direct link to your individual results so you will be placed accordingly. You will not be placed automatically. Corrals will be assigned as follows:\n\n**CORRAL ASSIGNMENT TIMES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AT ANY TIME AT THE SOLE DISCRETION OF THE LEADVILLE RACE SERIES.**\n\nBikeflights\n\nNeed to get your bike to Leadville?
