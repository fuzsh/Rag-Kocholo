        "text": "To obtain asylum through the affirmative asylum process you must be physically present in the United States. You may apply for asylum regardless of how you arrived in the United States or your current immigration status.\n\nYou must apply for asylum within 1 year of the date of your last arrival in the United States, unless you can show:\n\nChanged circumstances that materially affect your eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing; and\n\nYou filed within a reasonable amount of time given those circumstances.\n\nYou may apply for affirmative asylum by submitting Form I-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal, to USCIS.\n\nIf your case is not approved and you do not have a legal immigration status, we will issue a Form I-862, Notice to Appear (NTA), and refer your case to an immigration judge with the Department of Justice's Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR). The immigration judge conducts a “de novo” hearing of the case. This means that the judge conducts a new hearing and issues a decision that is independent of the decision made by USCIS. In certain circumstances, if USCIS does not have jurisdiction over your case, the asylum office will issue a Form I-863, Notice of Referral to Immigration Judge, for an asylum-only hearing. See the section “Defensive Asylum Processing With EOIR” below if this situation applies to you.\n\nIf you were previously issued an NTA that was not filed and docketed with the EOIR immigration court, or your previously issued NTA was filed and docketed with EOIR either shortly before (within 21 days) or after you filed your Form I-589 with USCIS, USCIS will refile your NTA (if necessary) and send your Form I-589 to the immigration court for adjudication.\n\nTo determine where to file your Form I-589, follow the instructions under the “Where to File” section on our Form I-589 page. For more information, please see What Happens After You File Your Form I-589 With USCIS.\n\nYou may live in the United States while your Form I-589 is pending before USCIS. If you are found ineligible, you can remain in the United States while your Form I-589 is pending with the immigration judge. Asylum applicants are not authorized to work unless you meet certain requirements. For more information, please see Permission to Work in the United States. Affirmative asylum applicants are rarely detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nPlease see the Affirmative Asylum Process for step-by-step information on applying for asylum through the affirmative asylum process.\n\nA defensive application for asylum occurs when you request asylum as a defense against removal from the United States. For asylum processing to be defensive, you must be in removal proceedings in immigration court with the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR).\n\nIndividuals are generally placed into defensive asylum processing in one of two ways:\n\nThey are referred to an immigration judge by USCIS after they have been determined to be ineligible for asylum at the end of the affirmative asylum process, or\n\nThey are placed in removal proceedings because they:\n\nWere apprehended in the United States or at a U.S. port of entry without proper legal documents or in violation of their immigration status; or\n\nWere apprehended by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) trying to enter the United States without proper documentation, were placed in the expedited removal process, and were found to have a credible fear of persecution or torture by an asylum officer. See Questions & Answers: Credible Fear Screenings for more information on the credible fear process.\n\nImmigration judges hear defensive asylum cases in adversarial (courtroom-like) proceedings, as necessary. The judge will hear arguments from both of the following parties:\n\nYou (and your attorney, if represented)\n\nThe U.S. government, which is represented by an attorney from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)\n\nThe immigration judge then decides whether you are eligible for asylum. If the immigration judge finds you eligible, they will grant asylum. If the immigration judge finds you ineligible for asylum, they will determine whether you are eligible for any other forms of relief from removal. If the immigration judge finds you ineligible for other forms of relief, they will order you to be removed from the United States. Either party can appeal the immigration judge’s decision.\n\nSee the Granted a Green Card by an Immigration Judge or Board of Immigration Appeals page for information about the grant of asylum by an immigration judge.\n\nFor information about the Executive Office for Immigration Review, including the Immigration Courts and the Board of Immigration Appeals, see Executive Office for Immigration Review. To determine where to file your Form I-589, follow the instructions under the “Where to File” section on our Form I-589 page."
