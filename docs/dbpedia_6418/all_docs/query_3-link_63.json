        "text": "Statutes, also referred to as codes, are laws that are written and passed by the Legislature and signed by the Governor (or approved by the voters as a ballot measure). Regulations, also referred to as rules, are written by state agencies (e.g., Board of Registered Nursing), approved by the Office of Administrative Law and filed with the Secretary of State. Regulations are drafted to implement, interpret, or make specific the statute. Both statutes and regulations carry the force of law.\n\nMost of the Boardâs statutes are housed within the Business and Professions Code (BPC). The statutory requirements of AB 890 are listed under Division 2, Chapter 6, Article 8.5 of the BPC.\n\nMost of the Boardâs regulations are housed within Title 16 of the Code of California Regulations (CCR). The regulatory requirements of AB 890 are listed under Title 16, Division 14, Article 8 of the CCR.\n\nThe two new categories established under AB 890 are commonly referred to as 103 NPs and 104 NPs. While they do not significantly extend or alter the current NPs scope of practice, the new categories do have additional authority to work without standardized procedures.\n\nA 103 NP will work under the provisions outlined in BPC Section 2837.103. This new category of NP can work without standardized procedures, in a group setting with at least one physician and surgeon, within the population focus of their National Certification.\n\nA 104 NP will work under the provisions outlined in BPC Section 2837.104. This new category of NP may work without standardized procedures, outside of a group setting, within the population focus of their National Certification.\n\nNo. A move to a 103 or 104 NP is not required; it is just an option. The traditional role of the NP in California remains. If they wish to, NPs can continue to work under physician supervision with the use of standardized procedures in their existing settings.\n\nThere is also no requirement for facilities to employ 103 NPs and no requirement for NPs to certify as 103 NPs to retain employment. Furthermore, the ability to work under standardized procedures remains whether or not the licensee is a 103 or 104 NP. It is up to each licensee/facility/employer as to the extent the expanded authority is utilized.\n\nNot at this time. According to BPC Section 2837.103(a)(1)(B) and BPC Section 2837.104(b), a 103 or 104 NP must hold a certification from a national certifying body accredited by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies or the American Board of Nursing Specialties and recognized by the Board. Under the Advanced Practice Registered Nursing Consensus Model, licensure occurs at the level of the population foci, as core competencies are aligned with role/population foci.\n\nTherefore, NPs who wish to progress to a 103 or 104 NP can only do so in one of the following six NP categories outlined in 16 CCR 1481(a):\n\nFamily/individual across the lifespan;\n\nAdult-gerontology, primary care or acute care;\n\nNeonatal;\n\nPediatrics, primary care or acute care;\n\nWomen's health/gender-related;\n\nPsychiatric-Mental Health across the lifespan.\n\nWhile there are other certifications, (e.g., Emergency NP and Dermatology NP), those are a specialty practice area and not a population focus. They do not replace the national certification and do not expand the scope of practice beyond the role or population. Consequently, the Board cannot grant a 103 or 104 NP status in those specialties.\n\nThis also applies to legacy/retired certifications (e.g., Acute Care NP and Adult NP) which be only be renewed and not newly obtained. These certifications are currently only recognized for licensure. Consequently, the Board cannot grant a 103 or 104 NP status in those legacy/retired certifications.\n\nAs a part of the application process, the applicant will be asked to submit information of the provider(s) who can attest to the completion of the 4,600 hours of the direct patient care hours that meet the TTP requirements. The Board will then send an email to the provider(s) listed asking for an attestation. These providers must be competent in the same specialty area or category listed in 16 CCR Section 1481(a) in which the applicant seeks as a 103 NP.\n\nThe attestor cannot have a familiar or financial relationship with the applicant and will be attesting to the applicantâs completion of the transition to practice requirement under penalty of perjury. If a complaint about the accuracy of the reported hours or the attestors relationship to the applicant is received, it will be investigated through the Boardâs established enforcement process.\n\nThe attestation form asks the mentoring provider to attest to their supervision of the 103 NP applicantâs clinical experience and mentorship â it does not ask the provider to attest to the NPâs competency. Current law presumes that an NP who has met the TTP requirements and other requirements identified in AB 890 and the corresponding regulations is sufficiently competent to practice without standardized procedures. Since the attestation is not intended to serve as a representation by the attestor as to the 103 NP applicantâs competency, it should not serve as a basis for liability to the attestor in the event that the 103 NP applicant commits negligence, incompetence, or other misconduct. However, the attestation is made under penalty of perjury, and the mentoring provider could face repercussions if they make a false attestation in bad faith.\n\nOnce an NP submits their 103 NP application via the BreEZe online portal and identifies their attestor(s) by license number, the BreEZe system will send a system-generated email to each identified attestor.\n\nWhen the attestor(s) clicks on the link provided in the email they will be directed to an online portal where they can review the information provided by the 103 NP applicant including the area in which the 103 NP applicant is seeking certification and the number of TTP hours the applicant performed in that area.\n\nThe attestor can then indicate whether they approve or disapprove (or partially approve) of the 103 NP applicantâs completion of those hours under their supervision. Please note, in this context the term \"supervision\" does not require constant, direct oversight.\n\nYes, a 103 NP or 104 NP who is certified in the same specialty area in which an applicant is seeking certification as a 103 NP can attest to the completion of their TTP hours. However, the 103 NP or 104 NP can only attest to hours that were completed by the applicant after the attestor was certified by the Board as a 103 NP or 104 NP where the NP served as a mentor during the additional clinical experience.\n\nIt depends. If you already have a furnishing license, you do not need to apply for a new one as a 103 NP. However, if you do not have a furnishing license and would like to be able to furnish without standardized procedures under your 103 NP certification, you will need to apply for one since the 103 NP certification does not automatically provide furnishing authority.\n\nNot at this time. According to BPC Section 2837.103(a)(1)(B) and Section 2837.104(b), a 103 NP must hold a certification from a national certifying body accredited by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies or the American Board of Nursing Specialties and recognized by the Board. Under the Advanced Practice Registered Nursing Consensus Model, licensure occurs at the level of the population foci, as core competencies are aligned with role/population foci. Therefore, NPs who wish to progress to a 103 or 104 can only do so in whichever of the six NP categories outlined in 16 CCR 1481(a) in which they received their national certification.\n\nWhile there are other certifications, such as an Emergency NP or a Dermatology NP, they are recognized by the Board as a specialty practice area and not a population focus. They do not replace the national certification and do not expand the scope of practice beyond the role or population. Consequently, the Board cannot grant a 103 or 104 NP status in additional specialty areas.\n\nOnce certified by the Board, an individualâs authority to practice as a 103 NP or 104 NP will be displayed along with their RN license status through DCAâs License Search. The DCA License Search is an online search tool that is available to the public and is used to verify a professional license issued by the various Boards and Bureaus under DCA.\n\nTo view this search tool, please visit: DCA License Search.\n\nAccording to 16 CCR 1482.4, a 103 NP must practice in good standing for at least three full-time equivalent years or 4600 hours in direct patient care before they can become a 104 NP. The term, âin good standingâ means practice conducted under a current, active, and unrestricted license. The term âunrestrictedâ means the applicant was not subject to a disciplinary action by the Board, including probation, suspension, or public reproval.\n\nIf a 104 NP applicant holds a Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP), they may apply any hours of direct patient care they provided in the course of their doctoral education toward the three-year requirement mentioned above, so long as the direct patient care experience is in the applicantâs area of National Certification and provided during the doctoral part of the applicantâs doctoral education and not credited towards the applicantâs masterâs degree."
