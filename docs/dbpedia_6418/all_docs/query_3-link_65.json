        "text": "Data Notes\n\nHigh School Longitudinal Study of 2009\n\nNational participation data were based on a longitudinal study using a nationally-representative sample of a cohort of students from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09), conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education. The cohort consisted of 9th-grade public school students in fall 2009 and followed up with a collection of high school transcripts in 2013 to examine course credits earned during high school. The study included over 23,000 9th-graders from 944 schools in 2009.\n\nEducation Longitudinal Study of 2002\n\nNational outcome data were based on a longitudinal study using a nationally-representative sample of a cohort of students from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:02), conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education, to permit analysis of longer-term education and labor market outcomes. The cohort consisted of 10th-grade public school students in spring 2002 and followed up with a collection of high school transcripts in 2005 to examine course credits during high school. The study included over 15,000 10th-graders from 750 schools in 2002.\n\nFast Response Survey System\n\nThe Fast Response Survey System (FRSS) survey “Career and Technical Education Programs in Public School Districts” (FRSS 208) collected nationally representative data on career and technical education (CTE) programs for the 2016–17 school year. The topics covered included entities that provide the CTE programs, the locations at which the CTE programs are offered to high school students, and work-based learning activities and employer involvement in CTE programs, as well as barriers preventing the school district from offering CTE programs and barriers to student participation in CTE programs. The survey was mailed to approximately 1,800 public school districts with high school grades in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The unweighted survey response rate was 87 percent, and the weighted response rate using the initial base weights was 86 percent. The report Career and Technical Education Programs in Public School Districts: 2016–17 (NCES 2018-028) presents selected findings from the survey.\n\nConsolidated Annual Report\n\nThe Consolidated Annual Report (CAR) is a single reporting instrument developed by the Department of Education that enables eligible agencies to submit the narrative performance report pursuant to 2 CFR 200.328 and 34 CFR 76.720, the financial reports pursuant to 2 CFR 200.327 and 34 CFR 76.720, and the performance data reports pursuant to section 113 of the Perkins Act. Data submission for the previous fiscal year is due by December 31 of each year.\n\nData Limitations\n\nHigh school graduation rates: In this data story, a CTE concentrator is defined as a student who has completed at least two course credits in a single career and technical education (CTE) subject, according to the student’s high school transcript(s), while a non-concentrator could be any student who did not meet this criterion. Because they are required to have completed at least two course credits in a single subject during high school, CTE concentrators may be more likely to have complete transcript data and/or have completed high school than non-concentrators. Please use caution when comparing the high school graduation rates of these two groups.\n\nEmployment earnings (including median earnings): The analysis of employment earnings in this data story includes all students in the sample who have data available. It is not restricted to students who were working full time and full year. Due to differences in employment status between CTE concentrators and non-concentrators, please use caution when comparing the earnings data of these two groups.\n\nNote on significant differences\n\nOnly statistically significant differences (at p < .05) are discussed except where noted. If differences between groups are not statistically significant, we use the phrase “no measurable difference.”\n\nReferences"
