        "text": "Theresa Heather Longman's life burned with an intensity. A luminosity emanated from within her, lighting\n\nup every room she entered and making each person she met feel special. This inner light was fueled by\n\na very wide and eclectic spectrum of passions (family, spiritual service, music, books, art, film, women's and indigenous people's rights, travel, cooking, baseball, dogs, and the paranormal, to name just a few).\n\nHers was a light further shaped by a life of overcoming adversity and her deep spiritual foundation.\n\nHer life ended suddenly and unexpectedly just after she returned from a 25th wedding anniversary trip\n\nto the coast and redwood forests of Northern California and only a few weeks after a joyous family\n\ncelebration of her 68th birthday. She passed away peacefully, in the very early hours of July 4th, 2024,\n\nsurrounded by her immediate family.\n\nHer amazing story began June 7th, 1956 on the Hawaiian Island Of Kauai. Theresa was raised by her much older sister Donna whom she would learn years later was actually her mother! Donna was Filipina, Tahitian, and Chinese. Theresa did not know her father other than he likely was a German sailor.\n\nTheresa's early memories of her mother were as an exotic dancer in San Francisco, sitting with her\n\nbackstage at the legendary North Beach Condor Club, alongside famed dancer Carol Doda, as Donna prepared her python Snoopy for her act. She also remembered dancing with Donna in their apartment to the R&B music of the era. These were the good memories. Theresa also endured extremely negative experiences that resulted in her staying in a variety of foster homes on the East and West Coasts. Some of these foster homes were also very bad. Theresa has said that she only made it through those years by relying on an inner spiritual power that protected her.\n\nFortuitously, her mother eventually arranged room and board for Theresa with Rena Ayers of San Rafael California. There, she was treated as a member of the Ayers family and was able to enter early adolescence\n\nin a stable environment. The Ayers were her first real family and she remained close with Rena and her\n\ngrown siblings for all the years since. She also met Chris Beltramini as part of the extended family there.\n\nGrowing up together, Chris would later become the father of her first child, Woodrow.\n\nHer formal education was spotty at best and she never graduated high school. Theresa found it hard to\n\nstay in unstimulating classrooms with all the excitement of the 1960's S.F. Bay Area scene exploding around her! She could be found instead seeing the great bands of that era at the Fillmore West and other venues in San Francisco and Marin - or hanging out with the Grateful Dead at nearby Olompali. Being a voracious reader however, often several books at a time each week, enabled her to easily compensate for her lack of schooling. Witness that just one night of \"cramming\" enabled her to pass the GED exam in 1987. Her love of music only grew stronger as well. Living in England for a few months after leaving the Ayers family, she thrilled at seeing Chrissy Hynde and the Pretenders and U2 in small clubs at the beginning of their careers. She would cry with joy while seeing U2 again at the Sphere in Las Vegas in early 2024, marveling at how far they'd come from those small clubs. And, yes, she was at the legendary\n\nWoodstock concert too!\n\nWhen son Woodrow arrived in 1974 though, Theresa changed her perspective. Her life experience, vast already at just 18 years of age, made her determined that her child would not undergo the experiences she\n\nhad. So Woodrow was born in Los Angeles, where her own mother was now well off, having reinvented herself as the owner of a vintage clothing store catering to the stars. During this time, Theresa would work at that store and meet many of Hollywood's producers, directors, and stars of that era.\n\nHer search for something better for her and her child though ultimately caused her to pack up all her worldly belongings in an old Ford Falcon and then drive with her baby up to Seattle Washington to start a whole new life. Her first sighting of the then Bon Marche Christmas Star in downtown Seattle the night she arrived started a lifelong magical love affair with that city.\n\nTheresa lived first in Alki and West Seattle until her miraculous escape, carrying Woodrow in her arms, from a devastating nighttime house fire that burned the building to the ground and destroyed all her possessions. This precipitated a move to Vashon Island. During this period, Theresa worked at several jobs to include being first a courier, and then servicing international letters of credit, for Seafirst Bank. For the latter position, she attended a course in International Finance in Amsterdam, Holland. Later she worked at both K2 and then Boeing as a QA inspector.\n\nWhile living on Vashon, Theresa met and then married Michael Laur in 1985. Together, they provided a good home for Woodrow and had two children of their own, Tahnee and Anthony. They later moved to Port Orchard and Theresa continued a career with the U.S. Postal Service that would last 14 years. During this time, Theresa, AKA \"Mama T\", also became the vocalist in the R&B group Mama T and Bad Voodoo formed with guitarist husband Mike. Overcoming severe stage fright, her performances at several local clubs of R&B classics by Aretha Franklin, Etta James, and others, were powerful. Theresa was also the\n\npresident of the U.S. fan club for the German rock guitarist Michael Schenker whom she knew personally.\n\nTheresa's marriage to Mike ended after 14 years. After a surprise proposal made onstage at an avantgarde play in Seattle, she married William Longman in 1999 and he became a loving stepfather to all\n\nthree children. She lived in Manchester with William until her death.\n\nThe spiritual strength that enabled Theresa to endure her childhood traumas blossomed after her adolescence. She learned that she could act as a medium in some circumstances but needed the\n\nguidance of mentors to develop these gifts. Acting purely on intuition, she drove by herself up to the\n\nMusqueam Indian Band Reservation in Vancouver, B.C. Here she met Vince Stogan for the first time. His first words to her were \"What took you so long?\" Vince and Edna Stogan were esteemed Musqueam elders who performed traditional spiritual work all over B.C. and beyond. Theresa worked with them in some of their practices and grew quite close to the Stogan family for whom she developed great love. She was honored to receive the Salish name Si:yam Sixne from Vince (\"Pa\") and Edna (\"Ma\") at a ceremony held at Fort Worden, Washington in 1998. Other native elders who Theresa had very close relationships with were \"Grandma\" Anna Haala (Tlingit) and \"Grandpa\" Sibby LeBeau (Hunkpapa Sioux). She also acted as a Peace Maker representative at Mary Thunder's ranch in Texas to meet with indigenous elders from around the world in a search for common ground.\n\nTheresa used her spiritual gifts to counsel many individuals at their request on matters related to departed Loved Ones. She never charged money or advertised for her services though, seeing herself as\n\nmerely a \"hollow bone\" or conduit for the Creator's love. Perhaps her most significant spiritual work was to attempt the release of numerous spirits trapped after their sudden death at the World Trade Center site\n\nin New York City on the one year anniversary of 9/11.\n\nHer own experience as a foster child drove Theresa to volunteer as a Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) for youth undergoing crises in Kitsap County. In this role, she was the sole advocate for specific children or whole families of children and thus responsible for ensuring their rights and needs were formally represented. She spent years making home visits, preparing written reports and depositions, and making court appearances to support these children, some of whom owe their lives to her. Theresa also served as an Advocate Counselor for the YWCA Alive Program for Battered Women in Bremerton for which she received recognition by the Bremerton Sun newspaper as an \"Unsung Hero\".\n\nDespite all her other work and experiences, Theresa's priority was always her family. She loved them fiercely and worked hard and constantly to build traditions and strong connections among her children.\n\nEven as they all grew up and left home, Theresa was always there for them. Granddaughter Tahlulah was the apple of her eye.\n\nPer her wishes, Theresa was cremated and her ashes will be scattered in the Pacific Ocean near her beloved second home in Ocean Shores. There will be an outdoor Remembrance event at Manchester State Park beginning 12 noon on Sunday 9/1/2024 for all her friends and family to share stories and memories of her.\n\nSign Theresa's online Guest Book at\n\nobituaries.seattletimes.com"
