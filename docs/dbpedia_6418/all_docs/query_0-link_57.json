        "text": "U.S. immigrants are required by law to register with the Selective Service System.\n\nNOTE: Registering with Selective Service is not signing up for the Armed Services. The Selective Service System is not part of the Department of Defense.\n\nImmigrant Men Are Required to Register\n\nWith very few exceptions, all immigrant males between ages 18 and 25 are required by law to register with the Selective Service System (SSS) within 30 days of arriving in the United States. This includes naturalized citizens, parolees, undocumented immigrants, legal permanent residents, asylum seekers, refugees, and all males with visas more than 30 days expired.\n\nNon-Immigrant Foreigners\n\nNon-immigrant men living in the United States on a valid visa are not required to register for as long as they remain on a valid visa up until they turn 26. If you have received a letter from us requesting that you register, please send us copies of supporting documentation to show you are exempt.\n\nMen 26+\n\nOnce a man turns 26, he is no longer able to register with the Selective Service System. If you entered the U.S. prior to turning 26, but are now 26 or older, and have not registered, learn more here.\n\nMen 31+\n\nImmigrant men who are 31 or older who are seeking naturalization and who did not register are no longer required to provide a âstatus information letterâ or documentation of their status from Selective Service. If asked for a status information letter, you may print a form letter concerning their request for a letter for use with USCIS.\n\nUSCIS Letter\n\nRegistering Without a Social Security Number\n\nIf you do not have a social security number, you can visit your local post office to pick up a form or download it here. Please mail your form to:\n\nSelective Service System\n\nP.O. Box 94739\n\nPalatine, IL 60094-4739\n\nPrintable Registration Form\n\nUpdating Your Information\n\nTo correct or provide your social security number or update other personal information, please call us atÂ 847-688-6888 for assistance.\n\nYou are required to notify us of an address change within 10 days of moving, up until January 1st of the year you turn 26 years old. Men are no longer required to notify Selective Service of address changes once they are 26 years old or older.\n\nUpdate Your Address\n\nUndocumented Immigrants\n\nWe do not now, or in the past, collect or share any information which would indicate a manâs immigration status, either documented or undocumented. Selective Service has no authority to collect such information, has no use for it, and it is irrelevant to the registration requirement. Consequently, there is no immigration data to share with anyone.\n\nU.S. dual nationals are required by law to register with the Selective Service System within 30 days of their 18th birthday, regardless of whether they live inside or outside of the United States.\n\nNOTE: Registering with Selective Service is not signing up for the Armed Services. The Selective Service System is not part of the Department of Defense.\n\nIn the Event of a Draft\n\nMost are liable for induction into the U.S. Armed Forces if there is a draft. They would also be eligible for any deferments, postponements, and exemptions available to all other registrants.\n\nHowever, some non-citizens and dual nationals would be exempt from induction into the military if there is a draft, depending on their country of origin and other factors. Some of these exemptions include:\n\na non-citizen who has lived in the U.S. for less than one year\n\na dual national whose other country of nationality has an agreement with the U.S. which specifically provides for an exemption"
