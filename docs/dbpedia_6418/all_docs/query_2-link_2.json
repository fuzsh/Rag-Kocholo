Come, let me clutch thee:\n\nI have thee not, and yet I see thee still.\n\n(Macbeth, Act 2 Scene 1)\n\nThat which hath made them drunk hath made me bold:\n\nWhat hath quenched them hath given me fire.\n\n(Lady Macbeth, Act 2 Scene 2)\n\nMethought I heard a voice cry, â€˜Sleep no more!\n\nMacbeth does murder sleep: the innocent sleep,\n\nSleep that knits up the ravelled sleeve of care,\n\nThe death of each day's life, sore labor's bath,\n\nBalm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,\n\nChief nourisher in life's feast.\n\n(Macbeth, Act 2 Scene 2)\n\nWill all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood\n\nClean from my hand?\n\n(Macbeth, Act 2 Scene 2)\n\nIt will have blood, they say: blood will have blood.\n\n(Macbeth, Act 3 Scene 4)\n\nDouble, double toil and trouble:\n\nFire burn, and cauldron bubble.\n\n(Witches, Act 4 Scene 1)\n\nBy the pricking of my thumbs,\n\nSomething wicked this way comes.\n\n(Second Witch, Act 4 Scene 1)\n\nMacbeth shall never vanquished be until\n\nGreat Birnam wood to high Dunsinane Hill\n\nShall come against him.\n\n(Third apparition, Act 4 Scene 1)\n\nWhat's done cannot be undone.\n\n(Lady Macbeth, Act 5 Scene 1)\n\nAnd let the angel whom thou still hast served\n\nTell thee: Macduff was from his mother's womb\n\nUntimely ripped.\n\n(Macduff, Act 5 Scene 7)"
