        "text": "Principle Overview:\n\nCarnegie explains that he once attended a dinner party where he met a botanist whom he found to be absolutely fascinating. He listened for hours with excitement as the botanist spoke of exotic plants and indoor gardens, until the party ended and everyone left.\n\nBefore leaving, the botanist told the host of the dinner party that Carnegie was a “most interesting conversationalist” and gave him several compliments.\n\nOf course, Carnegie had hardly said anything at all. What he had done was listen intently. He listened because he was genuinely interested.\n\n“And so I had him thinking of me as a good conversationalist when, in reality, I had been merely a good listener and had encouraged him to talk,” Carnegie notes.\n\nEven the most ill-tempered person, the most violent critic, will often be subdued in the presence of a patient, sympathetic listener.\n\nTake for example, a store clerk. If the clerk constantly interrupts and irritates customers, those customers are more likely to start arguments and bring frustrations and complaints to the store manager. But a clerk who is willing to listen could calm even a customer who storms in already angry.\n\nMost of us are so concerned with what we are going to say next that we don’t truly listen when someone else is speaking. Yet, most people would prefer a good listener to a good talker.\n\nCarnegie describes a story from a man named Edward Chalif, who was planning to ask the president of one of the largest corporations in America to pay for his son to go on a Boy Scout trip.\n\nBefore Mr. Chalif went to see him, he had heard that this man had drawn up a check for a million dollars, and that after it was canceled, he had had it framed. Upon meeting the man, he mentioned how much he admired the check and would love to see it.\n\nThe man was thrilled! He talked about the check for some time, until he realized he hadn’t asked why Mr. Chalif was there to see him. When Mr. Chalif mentioned his request, the man agreed without any questions and even offered to fund the trip for several other boys as well.\n\nMr. Chalif later explained, “If I hadn’t found out what he was interested in, and got him warmed up first, I wouldn’t have found him one-tenth as easy to approach.”\n\nTalking in terms of the other person’s interests benefits both parties.\n\nHow often do we notice someone who looks very down, or bored - perhaps someone whose job is very repetitive or someone whose boss doesn’t give him or her much recognition? Maybe it’s a store clerk, or the mailman, or our hair dresser. What could we say to that person to cheer them up?\n\nWe could think of something about them that we honestly admire. This might sometimes be difficult with a stranger, but we should push ourselves to think of something, and mention it to them.\n\nWhen Carnegie describes having this type of interactions with a stranger, he notes that many people have asked him what he was trying to get out of the person. His response:\n\nInstead of starting with “You’re wrong,” what if we were to say, “Well now, I thought otherwise, but I may be wrong. If I am wrong, I want to know why. Let’s examine the facts.”\n\nThe latter approach becomes disarming, and often causes the other person to be much more reasonable, or even thank us for having an understanding attitude. It also (hopefully) inspires our opponent to be just as fair and open-minded as we are.\n\nIn fact, it’s really not the ideas themselves that are so important to us, but our self-esteem, which is threatened when we are told that we’re wrong. Without our egos threatened, we may become very open to exploring new possibilities.\n\nPractice Principle 2:\n\nNext time you find yourself becoming frustrated or disagreeing with another person’s perspective, stop yourself from shaking your head, and adjust how you phrase your opinion:\n\n“No, you’re wrong.”\n\n✓ “Why do you see it that way?”\n\n“No, that’s the wrong way to tackle.”\n\n✓ “Why do you think that’s the best option to pursue?”\n\nYou might even ask the other person for permission to share your perspective on the matter, which readies the other person to listen to your ideas in a less critical mindset.\n\nCarnegie tells a story of taking his dog to the park without a muzzle or a leash, and running into a police officer who scolded him, as this was against the law. The next few times Carnegie took his dog out, he kept him on a leash, but the dog didn’t like it. So the next time, Carnegie let the dog run free. When he ran into that same police officer, he knew he would be in trouble.\n\nInstead of waiting for the police officer to start reprimanding him, he spoke up, saying that the officer had caught him red-handed, he was guilty and had no excuses, that the officer had already warned him. The policeman responded in a soft tone, told Carnegie he was overreacting, and that he should take his dog to the other side of the hill where he wouldn’t see him.\n\nIf we know we’re going to be rebuked anyhow, isn’t it far better to beat the other person to it and do it ourselves?\n\nThrough Carnegie’s quick and enthusiastic admission of fault, he gave the police officer a feeling of importance. After that, the only way the policeman could nourish his self-esteem was to take a forgiving attitude and show mercy.\n\nPractice Principle 3:\n\nNext time you find yourself in the wrong, challenge yourself to be the first to point it out. If you messed up on a work project, approach your boss about it, or bring it up next time you meet with her. By conveying that you not only acknowledge your mistakes but also that you’ve thought about how to avoid making similar mistakes down the line, you show your boss that you are responsible, honest, and diligent, and she is far more likely to dismiss the issue and continue to trust you.\n\nThe Muse Resource: The \"Just Right\" Reaction When You Mess Up at Work\n\nIf we’re angry or frustrated at someone and we go to them with our temper flaring, we’re sure to have a fine time unloading our feelings toward them. But what about the other person? Will our belligerent tones and hostility make it easy for them to agree with us?\n\nIf we approach the other person with our fists doubled, this will only lead the other person to double his fists twice as fast. If instead we come to him and say, “Why don’t we sit down and talk this through so we can understand why we disagree,” we’re likely to find that we’re actually not so far apart after all, that the points on which we differ are few and the ones on which we agree are many.\n\nWhen a person feels negatively about us, we can’t win him to our way of thinking with all the logic in the world. We can’t force someone to agree with us, but we can lead them in that direction if we are gentle and friendly with them.\n\nBusiness executives have learned that it pays to be friendly to strikers, that they are able to shift the strikers’ perspectives and win their loyalty by addressing their needs as friends and peers, instead of suppressing their voices and acting as dominants.\n\nPractice Principle 4:\n\nWhen you find yourself about to scold your children, act as a domineering boss, or nag your husband or wife, try softening your approach by opening with a friendly conversation and keeping a calm tone.\n\nAsk how your husband’s work presentation went, or ask your employee for her thoughts on your last team meeting. Have at least five minutes of pleasant conversation before you bring up the issue at hand.\n\nWhen talking with people, we should never begin with the points on which we disagree. We should start by emphasizing the things on which we agree, and be sure to convey that we’re both striving for the same result - our differences are in method, but not purpose.\n\nThe key is to keep our opponent from saying “no,” as this is a very difficult sentiment to overcome. As soon as someone says “no,” all of her pride rests upon her being consistent with that “no.” When a person says “no,” she immediately withdraws herself and guards against acceptance.\n\nWhat we want to do instead is get the person saying “yes” as soon as possible. This starts the person moving in the affirmative direction where no withdrawal takes place. Our opponent now has a very accepting, open attitude.\n\nSocrates has become very famous for the “Socratic method,” by which one asks another person questions with which they have to agree.\n\nPractice Principle 5:\n\nNext time you find yourself in disagreement with someone, challenge yourself to get them to agree with you on at least two things before you each share your perspectives.\n\nFor example, you could begin with:\n\n“The goal of this meeting is to decide on the best way to onboard new customers to minimize frustration with the product, correct?”\n\nor\n\n“We both want Johnny to feel comfortable in his social environment at school, right?”\n\nPointing out early on that you share the same ultimate goals will help start the conversation with a more agreeable tone.\n\nMost people who try to get others to agree with their perspective do too much of the talking. Instead, let the other people talk themselves out. They know their problems better than we do. Let’s ask them questions and let them tell us a few things.\n\nWe are often tempted to interrupt someone when we disagree with them. But we shouldn’t interrupt - it’s very dangerous. They won’t pay attention to our thoughts while they still have a number of their own to express. We must listen patiently and with an open mind, and be sincere in encouraging them to share their ideas fully.\n\nThis principle helps in both business and family situations. Carnegie tells a story of a woman who couldn’t get her daughter to do her chores. Instead of yelling at her for the hundredth time, the mother one day simply asked her daughter sadly, “Why?”\n\nHer daughter let loose the thoughts and feelings she had been bottling up - her mother never listened to her and always interrupted her with more orders. The mother realized all she had been doing was talking, not listening. From then on, she let her daughter do all the talking she wanted and their relationship improved significantly.\n\nPractice Principle 6:\n\nFight the urge to talk about yourself by learning to be comfortable with short silences in conversation. We’re often tempted to jump in and talk about ourselves when the other person stops talking, but if we stay quiet and wait for them to keep talking, chances are they will have more to say.\n\nLife Hack Resource: How To Be A Good Listener That Others Want To Talk To\n\nDon’t you feel much more strongly about ideas that you came up with than ideas that are handed to you by others? If so, why should we try to jam our ideas down other peoples’ throats? Isn’t it much wiser to make suggestions and let the other person think out the conclusion?\n\nNo one likes to feel like they’re being told what to do. We much prefer to think independently, have autonomy, and act on our own ideas. We like to be consulted about what we think and what we want.\n\nSo how can we use this to our advantage? When we’re trying to win someone to our way of thinking, we can guide them there - get them halfway or so - and then step back and let them see the idea through to completion.\n\nTake the case of a man named Mr. Wesson, who sold sketches for a design studio. He failed hundreds of times in getting one of the leading New York stylists to buy his sketches. One day, he tried a new approach. He took several incomplete sketches to the stylist and asked how he could finish the designs in such a way that the stylist would find them useful. The stylist offered his ideas, Mr. Wesson had the sketches completed according to the buyer’s ideas, and they were all accepted.\n\nIf we’re truly only after the results, why care about the credit? Why not let someone else take the spotlight, so long as we can achieve what we’re out to get?\n\nPractice Principle 7:\n\nLet’s say you’re trying to convince your boss to let you take the lead on a new project, or you’re trying to close a sale with a new customer. Before going into that conversation, write out a list of questions that would lead your boss or customer to the conclusion you’d like them to draw.\n\nFor your boss, it might be:\n\nHow big of a priority is getting this project done in a timely manner?\n\nWould you trust this project to an entry-level employee or prefer someone more senior?\n\nHow does the priority of this project compare to the priorities of my current projects?\n\nFor your customer, it might be:\n\nWhat goal are you trying to solve by purchasing this type of product?\n\nHow do you see our product helping you solve those goals?\n\nOne of the fundamental keys to successful human relations is understanding that other people may be totally wrong, but they don’t think they are.\n\nDon’t condemn them; try to understand them.\n\nIf someone feels negatively toward us, once we begin apologizing and sympathizing with their point of view, they will begin apologizing and sympathizing with our point of view.\n\nEveryone wants to feel understood and have their troubles and opinions recognized. Use this to turn hostility into friendliness.\n\nPractice Principle 9:\n\nNext time you approach a disagreement with someone, take a moment to imagine yourself in their shoes. If you were that person:\n\nWhat sort of pressures would you be working under?\n\nWhat would your goals and priorities be?\n\nWhat sort of relationships do you have with the other people involved?\n\nShow the other person that you genuinely understand their perspective, by saying things like, “I completely understand why you see it that way,” or, “I know it would be helpful for you if ...”\n\nPeople usually have two reasons for doing things -- one that sounds good, and the real one. A person will recognize on his own the real reason he does something. We don’t need to point it out. But all of us, being idealists at heart, like to think of motives that sound good.\n\nIn order to change people, we must appeal to the nobler motives.\n\nTake, for example, a landlord who had a tenant that decided he was going to break his lease four months early. The landlord could have handled the situation by pointing to their contract and listing all the consequences that would follow, but he instead had a talk with the tenant and said:\n\n“Mr. Doe, I have listened to your story and I still don’t believe you intend to move. I sized you up when I first met you as being a man of your word. Take a few days to think it over, and if you still intend to move, I will accept your decision as final.”\n\nThe result? The tenant concluded that the only honorable thing to do was to live up to his lease. By appealing to the tenant’s nobler motives, the landlord was able to persuade him successfully.\n\nMost people are honest and want to fulfill their obligations. In most cases, people will react favorably if we make them feel that we consider them honest, upright, and fair.\n\nPractice Principle 10:\n\nWhen you’re trying to convince someone to do something, start by thinking of a few positive traits that that person tries hard to embody (or conversely, would be ashamed to be told he does not have).\n\nFor example, most people aim to be responsible, fair, wise, and diligent. Work these ideas in when you mention to your son that you know he’s extremely responsible about his chores, so you were surprised to see that he didn’t make his bed this morning or when you tell your boss that you respect his fairness when it comes to deciding who deserves a promotion.\n\nHBR Resource: Why Wise Leaders Root Themselves in Noble Purpose\n\nTo be effective in convincing someone of our ideas or our argument, it’s not enough to merely state a truth. If we truly want someone’s attention, we have to present that truth in a vivid, interesting, dramatic way.\n\nWe get down on one knee when we propose as an act of dramatization - we’re showing that words alone aren’t enough to express that feeling.\n\nWe make games out of chores so our kids will play along and find it fun to pick up their toys when they get to make a pretend train around the playroom.\n\nCarnegie tells a story of a salesman who walked into a grocery store, told the owner that he was literally throwing away money on every sale he was making, and threw a handful of coins on the floor. The sound of the coins dropping got the attention of the owner and made his losses more tangible, and the salesman was able to get an order from him.\n\nPractice Principle 11:\n\nFind creative ways to use showmanship in presenting your ideas. When you’re designing your next meeting presentation or sales pitch, think of some ways to engage other senses or appeal to deeper concerns. Could you include a funny video in your presentation? Or begin with a dramatic statistic to underscore the importance of your message?\n\nHubSpot Resource: 7 Public Speaking Tips From the World's Best Presenters\n\nMost people have an innate desire to achieve. Along with that desire often comes a fierce sense of competition - everyone wants to outdo others and be the best.\n\nWhen nothing else works in winning people to your way of thinking, throw down a challenge.\n\nPractice Principle 1:\n\nThe key is an age-old technique called a 'criticism sandwich.' When you're going to offer negative feedback, start with a compliment. Then segue into the meat and potatoes: the criticism. Finally, and more importantly, part ways with another positive compliment.\n\nAs Jonah Berger, Wharton professor and New York Times best-selling author, puts it, \"It’s amazing what a little positive at the beginning and end can do.\"\n\nMost of us respond bitterly to direct criticism. When we’re looking to change people without offending them or arousing resentment, simply changing one three-letter word can be our key to success.\n\nMany people begin their criticism with sincere praise followed by the word “but” and their critical statement. For example, a parent trying to convince her son to care more about his school work might say, “We’re really proud of you, Billy, for getting better grades this semester.But if you had worked harder in your math class, you would’ve done even better.”\n\nIn this case, Billy might feel encouraged right up until he hears the word “but,” which leads him to question the sincerity of the initial praise. The word “but” makes it seem like the praise was only a contrived lead-in to his mother’s criticism.\n\nHowever, this situation could easily be reversed by changing the word “but” to “and.” See how different it sounds: “We’re really proud of you, Billy, for getting better grades this semester, and if you continue your efforts next semester, your math grade can be up with all the others.”\n\nNow it’s much easier for Billy to accept the praise, because there was no follow-up with direct criticism.\n\nPractice Principle 2:\n\nStart swapping “but” for “and” when you deliver critical feedback, to help you frame it in a positive and uplifting way, instead of inferring failure and disapproval.\n\nHubSpot Resource: How to Give Negative Feedback Without Sounding Like a Jerk\n\nThe next step to changing people’s ways without inflicting negative feelings is to admit that we are also susceptible to mistakes.\n\nIt is much easier to listen to a description of our own faults when the person criticizing begins by humbly saying that he is also far from perfect.\n\nCarnegie gives an example of hiring his niece, Josephine, to be his secretary. Josephine made many mistakes on the job, and though Carnegie was tempted to criticize her for her flaws, he took a step back and realized that he is twice as old as Josephine and has ten thousand times her business experience. How could he possibly expect her to have his same viewpoint and judgment? He realized that Josephine was performing better than he had been at her age.\n\nWhen he approached Josephine, he told her that she had made a mistake but goodness knows it was no worse than many that he himself had made. He noted that she was not born with judgment, that it comes only with experience, and that he had done many stupid things himself. “But don’t you think it would have been wiser if you had done so and so?” he concluded.\n\nPractice Principle 3:\n\nWhen you're about to criticize someone, ask yourself:\n\n\"What was I like when I was that age?\"\n\n“What was I thinking when I was at their level of experience?”\n\nYour empathy wheels will start turning, and you'll realize that you have an opportunity to be a great mentor to this person. Try to be a positive influence. Think of yourself as your mentor instead off their boss, their friends instead of their parent.\n\nForbes Resource: How to Be a Great Mentor\n\nNo one likes to take orders. What if, instead of telling people what to do, we gave them the opportunity to do things themselves, to learn from their own mistakes?\n\nInstead of saying “Do this” or “Don’t do that,” we should more often say, “You might consider this,” or “Do you think that would work?”\n\nWe long remember brash orders we’ve been given, times we’ve been screamed at - even if they were done to correct a bad error. But if we ask questions that give people the opportunity to correct errors themselves, we save their pride and give them a feeling of importance.\n\nAsking questions also stimulates creativity, leading to new ideas and better solutions.\n\nCarnegie offers an example of an accountant whose business was mostly seasonal. As a result, every year he had to let a lot of employees go once the tax rush was over. He began by sitting each down and explaining, “Of course, you understood you were only employed for the busy season…” but naturally, he was met with disappointment.\n\nHe then decided to begin the conversation by instead telling each employee how valuable he or she had been to the organization, and pointing out specific qualities that he appreciated in them. The result? The employees walked away knowing that if the business had been able to keep them on, they would have, and they felt much better about themselves.\n\nWe are so quick to criticize that we seldom offer others the opportunity to save face, especially when a considerate word or two and a genuine understanding of the other person’s attitude is all it would take to alleviate the sting.\n\nPractice Principle 5:\n\nWhen you have to deliver a decision or information that will cause negative feelings, think about how you can make the person feel good about himself first.\n\nAvoid delivering negative feedback in front of others or setting up a situation that will be embarrassing for the person. Think to yourself, “If I were him, how would I like to hear this news?” and design your environment and your approach accordingly.\n\nTake a brief look back on your own life to this point. Can you think of a time when a few words of praise have had a hand in shaping the person you've become?\n\nOne of the most powerful abilities we have is helping others realize their potential. We can do this by praising their strengths. Yet, this is something we do so infrequently. It's much easier to point out someone's faults. Even when it's tough to find things to praise, try hard to find something.\n\nWe should also praise often. By noting even small steps and minor improvements, we encourage the other person to keep improving.\n\nCarnegie offers an example of a mechanic named Bill whose work had become unsatisfactory. Instead of berating or threatening Bill, his manager simply called Bill into his office and told him:\n\n“You are a fine mechanic, you have been in the business for many years, and we’ve had a number of compliments on the good work you have done. But lately, your work has not been up to your own old standards, and I thought you’d want to know since you’ve been such an outstanding mechanic in the past.”\n\nThe result? Bill once again became a fast and thorough mechanic. With the reputation his manager had given him to live up to, how could he not?\n\nPractice Principle 7:\n\nWhen you’re trying to change someone’s mind, give them a reputation to live up to by saying something like:\n\n“I respect the fact that you’re always willing to listen and are big enough to change your mind when the facts warrant a change.”\n\nAppeal to their nobler motives of responsibility, fairness, openness, diligence, etc.\n\nIf we tell our children, spouses, or employees that they are stupid or bad at a certain thing, have no gift for it, and are doing it all wrong, we strip them of any motivation to improve. If instead, we use the opposite technique and openly encourage them as they take steps toward improvement, we’ll inspire a much higher level of motivation to continue.\n\nCarnegie offers an example of a boy who was struggling with algebra. His father made flashcards for him, and every night his father would time him on how long it took for him to get all of the cards right. Their goal was to do it in under eight minutes.\n\nThe first night, it took 52 minutes. The boy thought he’d never get there! But every time he knocked off a few minutes - 48, then 45, 44, 41 - they would call in his mother and the three would celebrate and dance a little jig. This gave the boy the motivation to keep improving, and even made it fun, until he got so good that he hit his goal and did it in eight minutes.\n\nPractice Principle 8:\n\nRather than simply telling someone they’re goal is out of reach, find ways to encourage small victories when possible. These smaller compliments can help make room for sharing guidance while keeping them inspired.\n\nWhether these small victories come in the form of eating reese’s pieces every time a work task is complete or dancing a jig when your song gets a math, recognizing progress can go a long way.\n\nThe final key to being a leader and changing people without arousing resentment is to make the person happy about doing what we want them to do.\n\nIf you’re having a hard time convincing your child to do a chore, offer to pay her a dollar for every time she does it, and take away a dollar for every time she doesn’t.\n\nIf you choose another internal candidate for the job, tell the one who didn’t get the job that you felt he was too important to the organization in his current role to reassign him.\n\nIf you have an employee who struggles with a certain task, appoint her to be the supervisor for that task, and watch as she improves immediately.\n\nOffering incentives, praise, and authority are all great ways to make a person happily accept our decisions and do what we want them to do.\n\nPractice Principle 9:\n\nTo be an effective leader, keep these guidelines in mind when it is necessary to change attitudes or behavior:\n\n1. Be sincere. Don’t promise anything you can’t deliver.\n\n2. Know exactly what you want the other person to do.\n\n3. Be empathetic. Ask yourself what it is the other person really wants.\n\n4. Consider the benefits that person will receive from doing what you suggest.\n\n5. Match those benefits to the person’s wants.\n\n6. When you make your request, put it in a form that will convey to the other person the idea that he personally will benefit.\n\nIt is naive to think that by implementing these techniques, we'll always get the outcome we desire. But the experience of most people shows that we are more likely to change attitudes with these approaches than by not using these principles. Even if we increase our success by a mere 10%, we have become 10% more effective as leaders than we were before.\n\nWith practice, it will become even more natural to apply these principles every day, and soon we will be masters of the art of human relations."
