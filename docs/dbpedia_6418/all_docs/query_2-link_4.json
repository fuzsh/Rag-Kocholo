        "text": "“No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear. I am not afraid, but the sensation is like being afraid. The same fluttering in the stomach, the same restlessness, the yawning. I keep on swallowing.”\n\nA Grief Observed by C.S. Lewis\n\nAs you might expect, there are countless grief quotes in A Grief Observed, a book by C.S. Lewis (author of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe) reflecting on the death of his wife, Joy Davidman.\n\nThe story of their marriage is an unusual one. Davidman, a divorced Jewish American mother-of-two, came to London in November 1953, having already met and fallen in love with the devoutly Christian bachelor C.S. Lewis. Lewis saw her as a good friend and like-minded intellectually. He helped her when she ran into financial difficulty. They entered into a civil marriage to allow her to stay in the country. But he wasn’t in love with her.\n\nOr so he thought.\n\nIn October 1956, Joy Davidman was diagnosed with incurable cancer, news that hit C.S. Lewis even harder than he might have expected. Faced with losing her forever, Lewis realised that he’d fallen in love with Davidman. They ended up having a full Anglican wedding.\n\nDavidman died in July 1960 and the turmoil that Lewis felt was what inspired A Grief Observed. He also wrote an epitaph in which he yearns for his wife to rise from the dead one day.\n\nHere the whole world (stars, water, air,\n\nAnd field, and forest, as they were\n\nReflected in a single mind)\n\nLike cast off clothes was left behind\n\nIn ashes, yet with hopes that she,\n\nRe-born from holy poverty,\n\nIn lenten lands, hereafter may\n\nResume them on her Easter Day.\n\nEpitaph for Joy Davidman’s grave, by C.S. Lewis\n\n“If you ever lose someone dear to you, never say the words ‘they’re gone’. They’ll come back.”\n\nComeback by Prince\n\nWritten for his only child, Amiir Gregory Nelson, who died at just one week old, the song Comeback – especially this passage – seems an affirmation of Prince’s belief in the hereafter. Or at the very least his great hope that he would one day see his son again.\n\nPrince lived an incredibly productive life, composing an unknown number of songs (some say around 2,000) before dying of an opioid overdose at the age of 57 in 2016. It was a life often tinged by tragedy, including the death of his son Amiir in 1996, followed by the miscarriage of another child shortly afterwards. According to Mayte Garcia, Prince’s wife and mother to both children, the marriage never recovered, as is sometimes the case for grieving parents.\n\nIn spite of the difficulties he faced in life, Prince composed numerous uplifting songs to remind us of the importance of enjoying life while we can.\n\nWe could all die any day.\n\nBut before I'll let that happen\n\nI'll dance my life away.\n\n1999, by Prince\n\n“One must not let oneself be overwhelmed by sadness.”\n\nJacqueline Kennedy-Onassis\n\nJackie Kennedy (or Jackie O as she became known in later life) was far more than the widow of a former President. She was also a fashion icon, book editor, mum, and no stranger to feelings of overwhelming grief and sadness. Both her two-day-old son Patrick and the baby's father, Jackie's first husband President John F. Kennedy, died within four months of each other in 1963. (Her second husband, the shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, died 12 years later.)\n\nPatrick Kennedy was born prematurely and died with his father by his side while Jackie was still recovering from the emergency caesarean. Just months later, President Kennedy himself died when he was shot in Dallas with Jackie by his side. Understandably, Jackie suffered from suspected post-traumatic stress disorder for some time afterwards.\n\nShe was left to look after the Kennedys’ young children on her own, and you can see the proud mother gently instructing three-year-old John Jr to salute his father’s passing coffin in poignant footage of John F. Kennedy’s funeral .\n\nGrief and bereavement are different for everyone and, as Jackie noted later on, her experiences were perhaps shaped by her very unusual and public position:\n\n“Can anyone understand how it is to have lived in the White House and then, suddenly, to be living alone as the President's widow?”\n\nJacqueline Kennedy-Onassis\n\n“Tomorrow is the most important thing in life.\n\nComes into us at midnight very clean.\n\nIt's perfect when it arrives and it puts itself in our hands.\n\nIt hopes we've learned something from yesterday.”\n\nJohn Wayne’s headstone\n\nThis quote originally comes from a Playboy magazine interview but, despite its racy origins, the words were so quietly profound that they were chosen by John Wayne’s loved ones for his headstone, providing solace and motivation in grief.\n\nHeadstone epitaphs are, of course, a popular place for memorable quotes about grief and death – from the poignant to the funny…\n\n“Death leaves a heartache no one can heal, love leaves a memory no one can steal”\n\nFrom an Irish headstone\n\n“I told you I was ill”\n\nSpike Milligan’s headstone\n\n“Murdered by a traitor and a coward whose name is not worthy to appear here”\n\nJesse James’ headstone, clearly written by a griever feeling angry with assassin Robert Ford\n\n“So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past”\n\nF. Scott Fitzgerald’s headstone, a quote from his book The Great Gatsby reflecting on loss\n\n“Grief is the price we pay for love.”\n\nQueen Elizabeth\n\nThe Queen delivered these words as part of a condolence message she sent to the families of the 250 British victims of the 9/11 terrorist attack. The words themselves are adapted from a passage written by Dr Colin Murray Parkes, a psychiatrist at St.Christopher’s Hospice in his book Bereavement: Studies of Grief in Adult Life.\n\n“The pain of grief is just as much part of life as the joy of love: it is perhaps the price we pay for love, the cost of commitment. To ignore this fact, or to pretend that it is not so, is to put on emotional blinkers which leave us unprepared for the losses that will inevitably occur in our own lives and unprepared to help others cope with losses in theirs.”\n\nDr Colin Murray Parkes, from Bereavement: Studies of Grief in Adult Life\n\nThe sentiment, in turn, is not dissimilar to the moving epitaph written in 1817 for legendary author Jane Austen by her brother James, in which he describes the grief of all who knew her:\n\n“Their grief is in proportion to their affection\n\nthey know their loss to be irreparable”\n\nJane Austen’s tombstone, Winchester Cathedral\n\nThe Native American blessing\n\n\"May the sun bring you energy every day, bringing light into the darkness of your soul.\n\nMay the moon softly restore you by light bathing you in the glow of restful sleep and peaceful dreams.\n\nMay the rain wash away your worries and cleanse the hurt that sits in your heart.\n\nMay the breeze blow new strength into your being, and may you believe in the courage of yourself.\n\nMay you walk gently through the world, keeping your loved one with you always, knowing that you are never parted in the beating of your heart.\"\n\nApache grief blessing, by unknown author(s)\n\nThis beautiful blessing was composed by Apache Native Americans to be wished to grieving comrades. Much Native American writing focuses on the connection between people and the natural environment, and the belief that nature has incredible healing powers. This blessing is no exception.\n\nThe Apaches were a semi-nomadic tribe, and when this blessing was first wished, members would have had a very intimate understanding of the great outdoors, dividing their time between hunter-gathering and farming. So, as they went about their lives in the southwestern United States, the sun, moon, rain and breeze from those vast prairie skies would've been reassuring constants, no matter what challenges everyday life brought.\n\nThe blessing is also a reminder that we can all benefit from the healing power of nature. Exercise and simple time spent outside can be very beneficial for mental health any time, including when we're touched by grief and loss."
