        "text": "Biology and Socialization Interactions\n\nIn this theory, we first propose that there are gender-related display rules in most cultures for emotion (Brody & Hall, 2008). In the US and in many Western cultures, girls are expected to display greater levels of most emotions, particularly positive emotions such as happiness, and internalizing negative emotions, including sadness, fear, anxiety, shame, and guilt (Brody & Hall, 2008). Girls are also expected to display more empathy and sympathy than boys (Zahn-Waxler, Cole, & Barrett, 1991; Zahn-Waxler, Schiro, Robinson, Emde, & Schmitz, 2001), which may also be considered internalizing-type emotions, since they involve expressively reflecting others’ sorrow (Chaplin & Aldao, 2013). These display rules for internalizing emotions in females are consistent with societal gender roles and stereotypes for females to be more relationally oriented, nurturing, and accommodating than males (Zahn-Waxler et al., 1991). Positive and internalizing emotion expressions facilitate rather than threaten relationships and often promote closeness with others, such as in the case of shared happiness promoting bonding or in the case of sadness expressions eliciting sympathy from others and bringing people together in shared mourning of a loss (Barrett & Campos, 1987; Izard & Ackerman, 2000; Zahn-Waxler & Robinson, 1995).\n\nIn contrast to the display rules for girls’ emotions, boys, at least in Western cultures, are expected to show less of the “tender” emotions, such as sadness and anxiety, and they are allowed to express externalizing emotions including anger, contempt, and disgust. Anger and contempt function to promote the goal of overcoming obstacles, which can involve the pushing outward, rather than internalizing, of distress (Brody, 1999, 2000; Brody & Hall, 2008). Thus, externalizing emotion expressions are consistent with societal gender roles for males to be assertive, individualistic, independent, and even aggressive, in line with traditional roles for men to protect their families and to overcome dangers that interfere with their ability to provide for their families (Brody, 1999; Eagly & Steffen, 1984).\n\nGender differences in emotion expressions in the proposed bio-psycho-social model, then, are hypothesized to develop based on a combination of biological gender differences and socialization into the cultural gender roles described above. Then, the expression of gender-role consistent emotions is influenced by contextual factors, including the immediate social context and the larger cultural context(s). In terms of biological factors, Brody (1999) and others have argued that as infants boys have higher activity and arousal levels, and lower language ability and inhibitory control than girls. All of these are likely to be biologically based. Because of these early differences between boys and girls, theorists have proposed that boys are less likely to inhibit or down-regulate negative emotions and more likely to express negative emotions than girls in infancy (Brody, 1999; Weinberg, Tronick, Cohn, & Olson, 1999) and that parents, at least in Western cultures, then respond to boys in ways that dampen their expressiveness; encouraging boys to limit emotions as a means of down-regulating their high arousal and activity levels. Consistent with this idea, Buck (1977) found that boys’ observed emotion expressions decreased with age from age 4 to 6 years whereas girls’ did not, in a sample of U.S. youth. He attributed this finding to socialization agents dampening boys’ expressivity. In contrast to the situation for boys, the bio-psycho-social model proposes that parents are likely to respond to their girls’ biologically based lower arousal and larger vocabularies by talking to them about emotions and otherwise encouraging emotion expression in young girls. Indeed, observational research has shown that parents do use more emotion words when talking with daughters than sons, in particular happiness- and sadness-related words, at least in White U.S. samples (Adams, Kuebli, Boyle, & Fivush, 1995; Fivush, 1989). This combination of biological factors and socialization should lead to increases in girls’ expressions of emotions and boys’ decreased expressions of emotions over time from infancy into childhood. In terms of type of emotion, given gender roles for girls to show greater positive and internalizing emotions than boys, we would expect that gender differences, with girls > boys in positive and internalizing emotions would increase from infancy into childhood. In terms of externalizing emotions, although boys may be encouraged to limit emotion displays in general (for example, according to Buck’s theory), the one type of emotion display that they may be allowed to continue would be externalizing emotions such as anger. These would be allowed because socialization agents would encourage anger in boys to be consistent with gender roles for greater acceptance of externalizing emotion expressions in boys than girls.\n\nWhat is the empirical evidence for this bio-psychosocially driven increase in gender differences from infancy to childhood and adolescence? In terms of positive emotions, there are four relevant meta-analyses suggesting age-related emergence of gender differences in positive emotion. In the first, Hall and Halberstadt (1986) did not find a significant gender difference in smiling behavior in 2 to 12 year olds, using mainly studies of White U.S. youth. In the second, LaFrance et al. (2003) found significant gender differences (females > males) in smiling behavior, with a medium effect size (d = −.41), in adolescents and adults aged 13 and over, with primarily (but not entirely) White U.S. samples. In the third, Chaplin and Aldao (2013), in their meta-analytic review of primarily (but not entirely) White U.S. children and adolescents aged 0–17, did not find significant gender differences in positive emotion expressions in infancy or the toddler/preschool period, but did find small but significant gender differences (girls > boys) in positive expressions in middle childhood (g = −.20) and adolescence (g = −.28). In the fourth, Else-Quest, Hyde, Goldsmith, and van Hulle’s (2006) meta-analysis of children aged 3 months to 13 years who were likely primarily White U.S. children (although ethnicity and country were not specified), found a trend for a gender difference (girls > boys) in smiling behavior to emerge with increasing age. Taken together, these studies support that gender differences in positive emotion expressions are not found in early childhood, but may be seen in middle childhood and are clearly seen by adolescence and adulthood. This may support biological and socialization theories that girls start off with biologically based lower arousal and better emotion vocabulary and they are socialized over time to enhance expression of emotion and, in particular, socialized to adopt the female gender role to express more “relational” positive emotions.\n\nIn terms of internalizing emotions like sadness and fear/ anxiety, there have been two relevant meta-analyses. In the first, Else-Quest et al. (2006) found a small but significant gender difference (girls > boys) in “fearfulness” (including observed fear expressions and parent-reports of child fear experiences and expressions; d = −.12) for children aged 3 months to 13 years and did not find moderation by age. For sadness, Else-Quest and colleagues found no significant gender differences in “sadness” (including observed sadness expressions and parent-reported sadness experiences and expressions). In the second meta-analysis, Chaplin and Aldao (2013) found significant gender differences (girls > boys) in internalizing expressions (including sadness and fear) in infancy (g = −.14), the toddler/ preschool years (g = −.09), and in middle childhood (g = −.12), and a non-significant pattern of girls > boys in internalizing expressions in adolescence (g = −.06), with no moderation by age. Interestingly, when Chaplin and Aldao (2013) divided their findings on internalizing expressions into the specific emotions that made up that composite, the strongest gender differences (girls > boys) were found for fear (g = −.10), shame (g = −.56), and sympathy (g = −.13) and no significant gender difference was found for sadness (g = −.06, ns). Taken together, these findings suggest that, at least for primarily White U.S. and Western European samples, girls may express greater fear and other internalizing emotions than boys (but possibly not greater sadness) and that this begins early (in infancy) and does not change over time with age. In terms of the bio-psycho-social model, this suggests that internalizing emotions are not as affected by socialization or unfolding of biological mechanisms over time, perhaps suggesting that gender differences in some internalizing emotions, including fear, are biologically based (or based on very early socialization, starting in infancy). The course of gender differences in sympathy and shame are a bit less clear, since these emotions do not actually emerge for youth until after infancy and so they did not likely influence Chaplin and Aldao’s findings for internalizing emotion expressions in infancy. More research should be done on the developmental course of gender differences in “social” emotions such as sympathy and shame expressions. The literature on self-reported sympathy and empathy experience (conduced mostly in U.S. and Western European samples) suggests that gender differences in empathic concern may become stronger from childhood to middle adolescence (Michalska, Kinzler, & Decety, 2013; van der Graaff et al., 2014), although gender differences in self-reported empathy may not be reflected in studies of observed empathy or in physiological indicators of empathy (Michalska et al., 2013).\n\nIn terms of gender differences in externalizing emotions, there have been at least two relevant reviews. Maccoby and Jacklin (1974) found in their classic narrative review of gender differences in behavior that gender differences (with boys > girls) in mostly observed “frustration reactions” (which included expressions of externalizing emotions) were not found in infancy, but emerged in the toddler period. Consistent with this, Chaplin and Aldao (2013) found that boys and girls were not significantly different in observed externalizing emotion expressions in infancy, but gender differences were significant (boys > girls) at toddler/preschool age (g = .17) and in middle childhood (g = .13). After middle childhood, however, unexpectedly, the direction of gender differences in externalizing emotion expressions changed direction in adolescence, with boys showing less externalizing emotion than girls in adolescence (g = −.27)— although this was based on relatively few studies of adolescents (number of studies = 11). Also consistent with a strengthening of gender differences in externalizing emotion expressions over time from infancy to childhood is Keenan and Shaw’s (1997) review of behavior problems (primarily parent-reported, primarily in U.S. and Western European samples), problems which are often characterized by anger expression. Keenan and Shaw found no gender differences in behavior problems in infancy, but emerging gender differences (boys > girls) in the preschool period. Taken together, these developmental data suggests that gender differences in externalizing emotions are not present in infancy, but develop (potentially due to socialization factors) in the toddler/preschool period and continue into childhood, although perhaps not through adolescence. This may suggest either a biological unfolding of gender differences in externalizing expressions in the preschool period and/or increasing socialization pressures for boys to show externalizing emotions and girls to limit these displays as parents get their children ready to enter school. The unexpected finding that girls showed greater externalizing expressions in adolescence may be due to increases in depression and accompanying irritability in adolescence for girls, or may be due to changing gender roles for teenaged girls’ expressions of anger in recent years (Brown, 1999), with anger becoming more acceptable for teenaged girls.\n\nSocial Context Influence\n\nOur bio-psycho-social model (and Brody’s [1999] model) also proposes an important role for social context, consistent with social constructionist theories. We propose that gender roles for emotion expression, once internalized, may be exacerbated or blunted depending on interactions with the in-the-moment social environment and also with the larger societal/cultural context. Emotion expressions are inherently social in nature— they typically are used as ways to signal one’s needs and desires to others in the environment. Individuals express emotions within particular situations or contexts and, at a more global level, within a society and culture and within a subculture (e.g., ethnicity, etc.). Thus, it is necessary to study emotion expression in the context of social interactions. One important contextual factor influencing gender differences in child emotion expressions is the interpersonal context in which one expresses emotion. It has been hypothesized, based on social-constructionist-informed theories, that fewer gender differences in emotion expression will be found when people are with someone they trust and know well (such as when a child is with his/her parent) or when they are alone than when they are with an unfamiliar person (e.g., an experimenter; Hall & Halberstadt, 1986; LaFrance et al., 2003) or with a peer (Zeman & Garber, 1996). This is because children will be more likely to behave in a “socially acceptable” manner with persons they do not know well and, therefore, are more likely to adhere to gender roles. In contrast, they may feel more comfortable when alone or with familiar others (e.g., parents) and thus be more likely to express a full range of emotions, even those that are not consistent with gender roles.\n\nWhat is the empirical evidence for a role of in-the-moment interpersonal context? For positive emotions, LaFrance et al.’s (2003) meta-analysis found that gender differences (females > males) in positive emotion expressions in adolescents and adults were stronger when with an unfamiliar person than when with a familiar person. Chaplin and Aldao’s (2013) meta-analysis also found that gender differences in positive expressions in 0–17 year olds were strongest when with an unfamiliar adult (g = −.12) and were not significant when with a parent, when alone, or when with a peer. Taken together, this is strong evidence that context matters and that gender differences in positive emotion may emerge based on an interaction between a gender role or script (or possibly a biological propensity) for girls to show high positive emotion and the demands of an environment. One explanation for girls’ tendency to express positive emotions when with unfamiliar others is that girls perceive that the observer is less open to seeing gender-role inconsistent emotions. Another explanation is that girls are socialized (and/or innately predisposed) to try to please others and maintain harmony and thus are more likely to smile when with an unfamiliar other in order to “please” an adult experimenter or in order to reduce social tension in interactions with strangers. Consistent with this, Hall and Halberstadt’s (1986) meta-analysis of 2–12 year olds found that gender differences in smiling (girls > boys) were stronger in socially tense situations (and also, to a lesser extent, in situations with unfamiliar others). In either case, it is clear that the social context matters for the end outcome of emotion expressive behavior.\n\nFor externalizing emotion expressions, similarly, Chaplin and Aldao (2013) also found social context influences, such that gender differences were stronger in the presence of peers (and, oddly, when alone) than when with parents or other adults, suggesting that the peer group may influence/elicit gender-role consistent displays of anger or aggression. The story for internalizing emotions was not as clear cut, with Chaplin and Aldao finding that gender differences for these emotions were actually strongest when with parents and when with unfamiliar adults and were attenuated with peers or alone, which does not line up with the hypothesis that gender differences should emerge in situations with relatively unfamiliar others (such as with peers) and not when with familiar others (like parents)."
