        "text": "Any person can be affected by crime and violence either by experiencing it directly or indirectly, such as witnessing violence or property crimes in their community or hearing about crime and violence from other residents.1 While crime and violence can affect anyone, certain groups of people are more likely to be exposed. For example, the national homicide rate is consistently higher for Black adolescents and young adults than their White counterparts.2 Low-income neighborhoods are more likely to be affected by crime and property crime than high-income neighborhoods.3 Types of violence include, but are not limited to, child abuse and neglect, firearm violence, intimate partner violence, sexual violence, and elder abuse.4 In addition to the potential for death, disability, and other injuries, people who survive violent crime endure physical pain and suffering and may also experience mental distress and reduced quality of life.5,6 Specific examples of detrimental health effects from exposure to violence and crime include asthma, hypertension, cancer, stroke, and mental disorders.7\n\nIndividuals can experience different types of violence throughout the lifespan, and the negative health effects of violence can occur at any age. Decades of research has established a connection between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) such as violence or abuse and lifelong health outcomes, including chronic disease and mental disorders.8 Children can be exposed to violence such as bullying or cyberbullying, abuse, or witnessing violence in a variety of settings, including at home or school, online, or in their neighborhoods.9 Children and adolescents exposed to violence are at risk for poor long-term behavioral and mental health outcomes, such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, regardless of whether they are victims, direct witnesses, or hear about the crime.10,11 Research has also shown an association between exposure to violence in childhood and an increased likelihood of experiencing intimate partner violence as an adult.12,13\n\nIn adulthood, exposure to violence can also lead to poor health outcomes. For example, women exposed to intimate partner violence have an increased risk of physical health issues such as injuries and mental disorders such as disordered eating, depression, and suicidal ideation.14 Older adults can also experience violence, including elder abuse or intimate partner violence.15 Evidence shows that older adults who experience elder abuse are more likely to experience increased stress and depression or develop fear and anxiety than those who do not experience elder abuse.16\n\nThere are serious short- and long-term health effects from exposure to crime and violence in oneâ€™s community. For example, one study found an association between gun-related violent crime in a neighborhood and a reduction in park use and park-based physical activity.17 Higher rates of neighborhood safety fears may lead to poorer self-rated physical and mental health.18 One study also found that higher rates of neighborhood crime were associated with increased odds for adverse pregnancy outcomes in Chicago.19 Community gun violence, which generally occurs in public spaces between non-related individuals, is a specific kind of violence that disproportionately affects Black and Hispanic/Latino communities.20 One study conducted in 4 U.S. cities found that people who were exposed to gun violence fatalities experienced higher levels of depression and suicidal ideation than those who were not exposed.21"
