        "text": "01 Employee Engagement Definition\n\nGallup defines employee engagement as the involvement and enthusiasm of employees in their work and workplace.\n\nEmployee engagement helps you measure and manage employees' perspectives on the crucial elements of your workplace environment.\n\nYou can find out if your employees are actively engaged with their work or simply putting in their time. You can discover if your team-building activities and human resources practices influence positive business outcomes or if there's room to grow.\n\nAnd with the right approach, you can learn how to improve your employees' connection to their work and your company and how to avoid employee burnout.\n\n02 Why Is Employee Engagement Important?\n\nEmployees make decisions and take actions every day that can affect your workforce and organizational effectiveness.\n\nThe way your company treats employees and how employees treat one another can positively affect their actions -- or can place your organization at risk.\n\nBased on decades of employee engagement research, Gallup knows that engaged employees produce better business outcomes than other employees -- across industry, company size, and nationality, and in good economic times and bad.\n\nBut only 23% of employees worldwide and 33% in the U.S. fall in the \"engaged\" category.\n\nSo, what can companies do better to engage employees?\n\nWhen companies use Gallup's Q12® as a framework to improve employee engagement -- one that executives support as a primary management strategy -- they yield clear and better results.\n\nAsking, \"Why is employee engagement important?\" is a vital question for leaders to consider. Employee engagement has many benefits; without employee engagement, there's no team engagement, making it more difficult to improve business outcomes.\n\nWhen Gallup analyzed the differences in performance among business/work units, the benefits of employee engagement were clear. When comparing employee engagement levels, Gallup found that top- and bottom-quartile business units and teams had the following differences in business outcomes*:\n\n78%\n\nin absenteeism\n\n58%\n\nin patient safety incidents (mortality and falls)\n\n21%\n\nin turnover for high-turnover organizations\n\n51%\n\nin turnover for low-turnover organizations\n\n28%\n\nin shrinkage (theft)\n\n63%\n\nin safety incidents (accidents)\n\n32%\n\nin quality (defects)\n\n10%\n\nin customer loyalty/engagement\n\n18%\n\nin productivity (sales)\n\n23%\n\nin profitability\n\n*The above figures are median percent differences across companies in Gallup's database. High-turnover organizations are those with more than 40% annualized turnover. Low-turnover organizations are those with 40% or lower annualized turnover.\n\n03 Whose Job Is Employee Engagement?\n\n70% of the variance in team engagement is determined solely by the manager.\n\nEmployee engagement should be a manager's primary responsibility.\n\nManagers are in charge of ensuring that employees know what work needs to be done, supporting and advocating for them when necessary, and explaining how their workplace engagement connects to organizational success.\n\nTo succeed in that responsibility, managers need to be equipped to have ongoing coaching conversations with employees.\n\nUnfortunately, most managers don't know how to make frequent conversations meaningful, so their actions are more likely to be interpreted as micromanaging without providing the right tools and direction.\n\nSo, it's not enough for leaders to simply tell managers to own engagement and coach their teams.\n\nLeaders must:\n\nredefine managers' roles and expectations\n\nprovide the training tools, resources and development that managers need to coach and meet those expectations\n\ncreate evaluation practices that help managers accurately measure performance, hold employees accountable and coach to the future\n\n04 What Are the Drivers of Employee Engagement?\n\nOne of the most common mistakes companies make is to approach engagement as a sporadic exercise in making their employees feel happy -- usually around the time when a survey is coming up.\n\nIt's true that we describe engaged employees as \"enthusiastic.\" And employee engagement surveys play a big role in measuring staff engagement. But it's not that simple.\n\nPeople want purpose and meaning from their work. They want to be known for what they're good at.\n\nThese are the key drivers of employee engagement:\n\npurpose\n\ndevelopment\n\na caring manager\n\nongoing conversations\n\na focus on strengths\n\nEmployees need more than a fleeting warm-fuzzy feeling and a good paycheck (even if it helps them respond positively on employee engagement survey questions) to invest in their work and achieve more for your company.\n\nPeople want purpose and meaning from their work. They want to be known for what makes them unique. This is what drives employee engagement.\n\nAnd they want relationships, particularly with a manager who can coach them to the next level. This is who drives employee engagement.\n\nOne of Gallup's biggest discoveries: The manager or team leader alone accounts for 70% of the variance in team engagement.\n\n05 Improving Employee Engagement Strategies\n\nNearly 80% of employees worldwide are still not engaged or are actively disengaged at work, despite more effort from companies.\n\nThe greatest cause of a workplace engagement program's failure is this: Employee engagement is widely considered \"an HR thing.\"\n\nIt is not owned by leaders, expected of managers or understood by front-line employees.\n\nThe result is that some organizations believe they have exhausted \"engagement\" as a performance lever before they truly explore its full potential to change their business.\n\nThese leaders consistently experience low engagement, or they plateau and eventually decline -- despite repeated attempts to boost scores. Other times, they have high engagement numbers, but their business results tell a different story.\n\nAt a loss for explanations, leaders may blame the tool, the measurement, the philosophy or environmental factors that they believe make their problems unique.\n\nBut, the apparent failure of employee engagement efforts is likely because of how organizations implement workplace employee engagement programs. Some common mistakes:\n\nToo complicated.\n\nLeaders make engagement metrics far too complicated by focusing on predictors that are often outside managers' control and typically don't relate to meeting employees' core psychological needs at work.\n\nIncorrect employee engagement metrics.\n\nThey use a low-bar \"percent favorable\" metric that inflates scores and creates blind spots, resulting in the appearance of high engagement without strong business performance outcomes.\n\nOveruse of surveys.\n\nThey overuse pulse surveys to get immediate feedback and rarely take action on the results.\n\nIn contrast, leaders who have integrated engagement into their corporate strategy using the framework we outline in the next section on this page see significant gains year after year.\n\n06 Measuring Employee Engagement: Gallup's Questions\n\nGallup has identified 12 elements of employee engagement that predict high team performance. These 12 elements make up our Q12 survey.\n\nManagers can take charge of engagement by asking and evaluating their employees' responses to these 12 employee engagement questions to create a structure for their interactions with employees -- casual conversations, meeting agendas, performance evaluations and team goal setting.\n\nWe've been measuring and reporting employee engagement trends for years and have used the 12 elements to determine how involved and enthusiastic employees are in their work and workplace.\n\nThe 12 Elements\n\nSome of the 12 elements might seem simple. But Gallup's employee engagement research has found that only a small percentage of employees strongly agree their employer or manager delivers on them.\n\nHere are three employee engagement ideas to help managers approach each element:\n\nQ01. I know what is expected of me at work.\n\nHelping employees understand what their organization, leaders and managers expect from them requires more than someone telling them what to do. The most effective managers define and discuss each employee's explicit and implicit expectations. They paint a picture of outstanding performance and help employees recognize how their work leads to the success of their coworkers, their business area and the entire organization.\n\nLearn more about the Q12 items.\n\nQ02. I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work right.\n\n\"Materials and equipment\" is not just a checklist of tools. It includes both tangible and intangible resources -- office supplies, software, knowledge sharing and permissions, to name a few -- that employees need to do their job. The most effective managers don't assume what their team needs. They ask for and listen to their employees' needs and advocate for them when necessary. They also find ways to make the most of their team's ingenuity and talents when they cannot fully fund requests.\n\nLearn more about the Q12 items.\n\nQ03. At work, I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day.\n\nWhen people get to do what they do best every day at work, the organizations they work for get a boost in employee participation, attraction, engagement and retention. Successful managers get to know their employees as individuals and give them opportunities to apply the best of their natural selves -- their talents. They talk to each employee about their unique value and make adjustments to align work, when possible, with team members' talents. The best managers know where their employees excel and position them so that they are engaged and provide maximum value to the organization.\n\nLearn more about the Q12 items.\n\nIncreasing Employee Engagement Post-Survey\n\nAn engagement survey is only the first step to motivating employees. If you implement a survey with no follow-up, engagement will likely decrease.\n\nTo gain positive momentum and increase engagement, you must ask for feedback, do something about it and continually share results.\n\nUsing employee engagement software is a great place to start. Many engagement platforms offer helpful action items and advice for leaders and managers looking to increase team engagement. Using these resources can help build accountability.\n\nBack to Top\n\nMeeting the needs in the three foundational levels creates an environment of trust and support that enables managers and employees to get the most out of the top level -- personal growth.\n\nThese levels provide a road map for managers to motivate and develop their team members and improve the team members' performance, with each one building on the previous.\n\nThe levels do not represent phases. Managers do not \"finish\" the first level and then move on to the second level. They must ensure that employees know what is expected of them and have the right materials and equipment to do their work while meeting needs on the second, third and fourth levels.\n\nWith their team members, managers should identify needs and obstacles on an ongoing basis and ideally take action before challenges inhibit their employees' performance.\n\nInterested in using our Q12 survey?

They are psychological \"owners,\" drive high performance and innovation, and move the organization forward.\n\nExample: An employee who logs in for a few hours longer to get a project over the finish line or who spends more time on the phone with a client who needs help -- because they're committed to their organization's \"client first\" values. They build up their coworkers and have strong relationships within the organization.\n\nThe 3 Personas of Engagement\n\nNot Engaged\n\nNot engaged employees are psychologically unattached to their work and company. Because their engagement needs are not being fully met, they're putting time -- but not energy or passion -- into their work.\n\nExample: An employee who completes their work but is fueled by duty rather than passion or personal interest. This employee may prefer to fly under the radar and might back down from more intense or high-profile work.\n\nThe 3 Personas of Engagement\n\nActively Disengaged\n\nActively disengaged employees aren't just unhappy at work -- they are resentful that their needs aren't being met and are acting out their unhappiness. Every day, these workers potentially undermine what their engaged coworkers accomplish.\n\nExample: This employee spends their time talking negatively about coworkers, current projects, leaders, etc. They may be searching for other employment opportunities in their spare time and do not plan to stay at their current job much longer.\n\n09 How to Improve Employee Engagement: Team Engagement Ideas\n\nThere are no quick fixes when it comes to human relationships. Simple employee engagement activities won't transform your culture.\n\nBut since the value of the Q12 items is in helping managers and teams start conversations and approach workforce engagement issues authentically and meaningfully, there are lots of ideas in the framework to help you build your team up.\n\nFor example:\n\nAddressing Diversity and Inclusion\n\nA new manager has inherited a low-performing team with diverse ages, genders, cultures and personalities. After a few months of private conversations and tense team meetings, she can tell that a lack of cooperation and disunity are at the heart of the team's lack of collaboration and low performance outcomes.\n\nAddressing Hybrid Work\n\nFor hybrid work to be effective long term, we must consider the real benefits and risks. Push yourself to look beyond management practices that worked when people were mostly on-site or are simply more comfortable because they're familiar. Instead, assess how you can modify those practices to align with your commitment to hybrid and remote workers.\n\nEngagement areas for manager action:\n\nQ04 Receiving frequent recognition:\n\nMake recognition a regular agenda item to demonstrate appreciation for individuals' different contributions to the team and organization. Metrics and methods of tracking excellence should transcend location. If teams are working flexibly, managers have to understand performance management and culture in a flexible way.\n\nQ05 Someone cares about me:\n\nAsk employees: What would make you feel like a valued team member? Individualize the approach to leading team members based on how they say they want to be treated.\n\nQ07 My opinions count:\n\nBecome an advocate for employees' ideas. Solicit them during meetings and take action on them.\n\n10 Improving Employee Engagement Begins Here\n\nPartner with Gallup to bring the best out of your employees.\n\nFor Departments and Organizations Learn about our employee engagement solutions and customized plans for organizations.
