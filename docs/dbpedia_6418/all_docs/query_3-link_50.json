        "text": "Your business structure affects how much you pay in taxes, your ability to raise money, the paperwork you need to file, and your personal liability.\n\nYou'll need to choose a business structure before you register your business with the state. Most businesses will also need to get a tax ID number and file for the appropriate licenses and permits.\n\nChoose carefully. While you may convert to a different business structure in the future, there may be restrictions based on your location. This could also result in tax consequences and unintended dissolution, among other complications.\n\nConsulting with business counselors, attorneys, and accountants can prove helpful.\n\nC corp\n\nA corporation, sometimes called a C corp, is a legal entity that's separate from its owners. Corporations can make a profit, be taxed, and can be held legally liable.\n\nCorporations offer the strongest protection to its owners from personal liability, but the cost to form a corporation is higher than other structures. Corporations also require more extensive record-keeping, operational processes, and reporting.\n\nUnlike sole proprietors, partnerships, and LLCs, corporations pay income tax on their profits. In some cases, corporate profits are taxed twice — first, when the company makes a profit, and again when dividends are paid to shareholders on their personal tax returns.\n\nCorporations have a completely independent life separate from its shareholders. If a shareholder leaves the company or sells his or her shares, the C corp can continue doing business relatively undisturbed.\n\nCorporations have an advantage when it comes to raising capital because they can raise funds through the sale of stock, which can also be a benefit in attracting employees.\n\nCorporations can be a good choice for medium- or higher-risk businesses, those that need to raise money, and businesses that plan to \"go public\" or eventually be sold.\n\nS corp\n\nAn S corporation, sometimes called an S corp, is a special type of corporation that's designed to avoid the double taxation drawback of regular C corps. S corps allow profits, and some losses, to be passed through directly to owners' personal income without ever being subject to corporate tax rates.\n\nNot all states tax S corps equally, but most recognize them the same way the federal government does and tax the shareholders accordingly. Some states tax S corps on profits above a specified limit and other states don't recognize the S corp election at all, simply treating the business as a C corp.\n\nS corps must file with the IRS to get S corp status, a different process from registering with their state.\n\nThere are special limits on S corps. Check the IRS website for eligibility requirements. You'll still have to follow the strict filing and operational processes of a C corp.\n\nS corps also have an independent life, just like C corps. If a shareholder leaves the company or sells his or her shares, the S corp can continue doing business relatively undisturbed.\n\nS corps can be a good choice for a businesses that would otherwise be a C corp, but meet the criteria to file as an S corp.\n\nBenefit corporation\n\nA benefit corporation is a for-profit corporation recognized by a majority of U.S. states. Benefit corporations are different from C corps in purpose, accountability, and transparency, but aren't different in how they're taxed.\n\nBenefit corporations are driven by both mission and profit. Shareholders hold the company accountable to produce some sort of public benefit in addition to a financial profit. Some states require benefit corporations to submit annual benefit reports that demonstrate their contribution to the public good.\n\nThere are several third-party benefit corporation certification services, but none are required for a company to be legally considered one in a state where the legal status is available.\n\nClose corporation\n\nClose corporations resemble B corps but have a less traditional corporate structure. These shed many formalities that typically govern corporations and apply to smaller companies.\n\nState rules vary, but shares are usually barred from public trading. Close corporations can be run by a small group of shareholders without a board of directors.\n\nNonprofit corporation\n\nNonprofit corporations are organized to do charity, education, religious, literary, or scientific work. Because their work benefits the public, nonprofits can receive tax-exempt status, meaning they don't pay state or federal income taxes on any profits it makes.\n\nNonprofits must file with the IRS to get tax exemption, a different process from registering with their state.\n\nNonprofit corporations need to follow organizational rules very similar to a regular C corp. They also need to follow special rules about what they do with any profits they earn. For example, they can't distribute profits to members or political campaigns.\n\nNonprofits are often called 501(c)(3) corporations — a reference to the section of the Internal Revenue Code that is most commonly used to grant tax-exempt status."
