Hefty comedian Walter Hiers stars in this tepid comedy. Jimmy Kirk (Hiers) is a soda jerk in love with Mamie Smith (Jacqueline Logan), the daughter of a banker (Charles Ogle). In spite of his lowly position, Jimmy has aspirations and leases a four-foot plot in hopes of building a store. Although his plan comes to naught, he does manage to save up enough money to rent a flivver at 60 cents an hour. When Smith's bank is robbed, Jimmy is accused of being the perpetrator. Even though he didn't do it, the car he rented was used and he finds the money concealed within. He captures the robbers, which entitles him to the reward -- only Smith won't give it to him since some of the bank's money flew out of the car during the pursuit. But Jimmy gets back at him by proving that the bank has encroached on his four-foot space, and he is entitled to a settlement. He also wins the lovely Mamie.
