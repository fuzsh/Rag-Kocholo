OSCAR AJ2EKE, Preddem. \"DUT you have seen good pictures in cheap frames and cheap pictures in good frames. And you have seen real actors in poor plays and poor actors in real plays. You have seen a successful star stop suddenly in furious flight like a blazing meteor that has plunged sizzling into a lake! And you have sometimes wished there were more lakes ! But you have never known failure to result from a partnership of Great Story and Great Actor. Realart pearls are not strung on string! REALART PICTURES CORPORATION ARTHUR S. KANE, President 112 WEST 42nd STREET, NEW YORK CITY THE PUBLIC IS CLAMORING FOR HIGH CLASS MYSTERY — WAITING FOR “The MYSTERY OF THE YELLOW ROOM” THIS is a mystery year. The public has suddenly turned to mystery stories and the newspapers, magazines and book publishers have been smart enough to meet the demand. If you will get behind a high class mystery special right now, you will find you have a house-filler. Emile Chautard noticed the fuss the public was making over mystery stories and wisely picked “The Mystery of the Yellow Room\" as his first Mayflower special. He produced it from the startling book by Gaston Leroux, of which a special photoplay edition issues simultane- ously with the release of the photonovel. And we defy anyone who is unacquainted with the book to say at the end of the fifth reel who Mathilde Stangerson’s mysterious enemy is! REALART PICTURES CORPORATION ARTHUR S KANE, President 112 West 42nd Street New York City : . 77 — I __ liZc — in a picture drama based on the play in which she achieved her greatest stage success — “SI N N E R S Written by OWEN DAVIS Scenario by EVE UNSELL Director, KENNETH WEBB ^J^HE absorbing human inter- est story of a home-loving girl who loses courage for a moment in the great battle of life — who sins, but in her own heart only — who rises triumph- ant at last over the temptations of the easiest way. There are big names linked with this production — names the public knows — names you can capitalize. Just say “SINNERS” to any Realart branch manager! cALICE BRADY THE MOVING PICTURE WORLD 3 V If CYCLONE SMITH STORIES The only test worth a Tinker’s dam on two-reel feature sub- jects is COMPARISON. Comparison eliminates “bunk” — sidesteps sales- men’s suave palaver — and guarantees you the genuine instead of the imitation.

We Admit It WE SHOULDER the responsibility. We ARE the sponsors (and for five years the sole expo nents) of National Motion Picture Advertising. Month after month, year after year, we have carried practically the whole burden. But in that time we have sold the Motion Picture to the great American Public, to the classes as well as the masses. Our dignified, wisely worded presentation of the case of the motion picture has aided materially in its elevation to its present high standing, and — At the same time has ineffaceably established the words PARA' MOUNT' ARTCR AFT as household words. Altogether we have expended over $3,000,000 in this stimulation of interest in, and patronage to the motion picture theatre. Thereby we have benefited everyone in any way identified with or interested in the success of this industry. That we have profited substantially by this policy is but logical because we have painstakingly linked in close association the words PARAMOUNT' ARTCRAFT and QUALITY MOTION PICTURES. And the Public today, the great Public which reads the Saturday Evening Post and other National periodicals — Subconsciously thinks PARAMOUNT- ARTCR AFT when it thinks QUALITY MOTION PICTURES. We are ranked among the great National Advertisers, and because we have backed up our advertising with pictures of a consis' tently high quality — The name PAR AMOUNT' ARTCR AFT now represents a tremendous asset to any theatre.

It is a sure-fire money-maker, and what is even better, it will make friends for your theatre. Tell the people that this picture was taken in the arctic circle, north of the fifty-sixth parallel. It was sixty degrees below zero and one man lost his life while another had his feet frozen. Sixteen different kinds of wild animals appear in .the picture in their natural roles. Get the gigantic stencil of a dog's foot provided by the First National, and whitewash tracks leading up to your theatre. The people will certainly follow them into your house. Look over the press sheet for other advertising accessories and make use of them. You cannot go too strong on advertising this picture. We guarantee it. But we want you to look at it. Then nothing more need be said. It’s a Bear of a picture and Bruno is in it. A First National Special Attraction Do You Want a Different Film?

But we wish to make it clear to our friend, the exhibitor, that we will never build, acquire or lease a theatre from choice, but only from neces- sity! We are co-operating with the exhibitor, not com- peting with him, and we have no intention of encroaching upon his activities; but we should be unworthy of our great reputation as Producers if we were to throw up our hands whenever monopoly throws down the challenge! GOLDWYN DISTRIBUTING CORPORATION Samuel Goldwyn President 20 THE MOVING PICTURE WORLD October 4, 1919 The Kind of Patrons To Encourage The tendency in the picture world is toward a gradual leveling of all things — to a steady, regulated, strictly busi- ness-like industry. The theatregoers are finding the standards of entertain- ment to be pretty simple. The patrons are coming to the point where they won’t be fooled by stunts and exaggeration. They are going to become regular patrons of the picture theatre which always gives a good show, irrespective of weather, seasons or other things. To furnish the theatre the material wherewith to give a good show (irrespective of star, author, director — but with an assurance of institutional worth) is the Goldwyn idea. The truest representation of the kind of Goldwyn picture which will encourage regular patronage interested in a good show is here offered. Samuel Goldwun Presents Written by Jerome K. Jerome Directed by Clarence Badger Every exhibitor who has seen it has booked it for his theatre. Have you seen it? If you have you are already an enthusiast.

If you will remember, when I looked at the first one we used, there was considerable doubt in rtiy mind and I hesitated in booking a slapstick comedy. After screening \"HIS SIMPLE LIFE\" for the second time, I decided to give it a trial. The result you know. We have used every Larry Seamon Comedy since and have contracted for?. the entire series. I can truthfully state tha t no other brand of comedies shown in this theater have the enter tainment values and the ability to please that the Larry Seamons1 have. They are genuine conedies in every sense of the word, — well acted, well staged, well directed and founded on good stories with as much attention to detail and continuity as the biggest features; best of all they please the Newman audiences which I believe to be the most critical in the city. Assuring you that it is my pleasure to heartily recommend the Larry Seamon Comedies to my many exhibitor friends in this territory, I beg to remain Manager, Mr. F. P.

CHALMERS 1907 J& BIG SOUTHWESTERN BOOM CONTINUES New Theatres Springing Up in Every Part of Texas and Oklahoma — Tendency Toward Much Larger Houses THE unparalleled boom in mov- ing picture theatre construction throughout southwestern territory still continues without abatement. In every part of Texas and Oklahoma new theatres are springing up. The tend- ency is for the erection of very much larger theatres than was formerly the rule. In towns where a 400-seat house formerly sufficed, n<3w a theatre of at least 1,200 capacity is usually planned. Henry C. Stearns is building a new theatre in the business district of Kings- ville, Texas. It will seat 1,100 people and will be equipped with a pipe organ, patent ventilating and heating system and all modern appliances. His slogan will be “A Dime All the Time.” The opening date is set for Thanksgiving Day. Gill Building a $40,000 House. O. Gill, of Hugo, Okla., is constructing a new theatre which will seat 800 per- sons and cost $40,000. It will be called the Erie Theatre and will take the place of the old Erie Theatre. The Nolen Amusement Company will open a new theatre at Parks Camp, Breckenridge, Texas, on October 15. This is in the oil fields. The largest theatre for negroes in the entire South is being constructed in Shreveport, La., by E. V. Richards, of the Saenger Amusement Company. It will seat 2,000 and will have a $10,000 pipe organ. The Green Mount Amusement Com- pany, of Sherman, Texas, has been in- corporated for the purpose of construct- ing a new theatre in that city. H. F. and Ollie Young are incorporators. Spends $15,000 in Remodeling. P. C. Crown has purchased the Star Theatre at De Leon, Texas, and is re- modeling it and doubling its capacity at a cost of $15,000. Mrs. V. P.' Shirley has opened the new Shirley Theatre at Honey Grove, Texas. She now owns two theatres in that city. The Art Hamlev Theatre at Paul’s Vatley, O la., which seats 600, will be completed and ready for opening in October. New theatres are in the course of con- struction at Hewitt, O'-da., and Clinton, OVla., and the Woolam Theatre at Wal- ters has just been opened. Eugene Mudd, formerly of the Em- press of Wauri' a. O' la., has opened a new airdome in Walters, O’la. The town is in the midst of an oil boom. The Woodmen of the World are erect- ing a new $100,000 moving picture the- atre and clubhouse at San Saba, Texas. The building will be of three stories, the lower part be;ng used for a 1,200 seat- ing capacity theatre. The new theatres are all in addition to those contemplated or in process of building as the result of the recent southwestern controversy regarding control of theatres by producing con- cerns. Work Succeeds Gradwell As Head of World Film THE board of directors of the World Film Corporation announce that President Ricord Gradwell has tendered his resignation, effective Sept. 30. No announcement as to Mr. Grad- well’s future activities is made except that he remains on the board of direc- tors. Milton C. Work has been elected president. He has, ever since the in- auguration of the company, been a mem- ber of the finance committee. Briton N. Busch, besides being treas- urer, will become general manager. George Meeker remains general sales manager; Lee Kugel is in charge of publicity and S. B. Van Horn of adver- tising. Strand for Allentown Will Be Completed by New Year’s MAX SPIEGEEL, vice-president of the Mark Strand Theatre Co., and Sol Brill have closed a lease for a theatre to be erected in Allentown, Pa. The house will be modeled after the combination of the New York Strand, Rialto and Rivoli theatres and have a capacity of 2,000 seats on two floors. It will be of the most modern type of construction, with a lobby of 30 feet for an entrance on Hamilton street. The owners of the property, who are building the theatre for Spiegel & Brill, are Channock & Senterowitz, real estate operators of Allentown. The theatre builuing is under construction and the lobby building is entirely completed. Congress to Investigate Army Film, “Fit to Fight” AS SOON as the select House com- mittee investigating expenditures by the War Department get to the end of some of the special investi- gations it is now engaged in, attention will be directed towards the acquisition by commercial agencies of the film, “Fit to Fight.” A similar announcement was made some weeks ago, and following this, Mr. Graham, chairman of the com- mittee, told the correspondent of the Moving Picture World, the film was withdrawn. Congressman Graham’s committee is digging into everything that has the appearance of being open to criticism. “The actors in this film gave their services free,” he said, “and it was agreed that the pictures should be used in connection with our army activities only. The film was indorsed by the Public Health Service and various branches of the Government. We learned that it had been turned over to a private corporation to be shown for gain. The promoters capitalized the fact that the picture bore official in- dorsement. People paid money for it because they were led to believe it was helping the government; that it was a patriotic duty.” Congressman Graham denies that the purpose of the whole investigation is to get information to be used in the next Presidential campaign. Texas Exhibitors Form to Combat High Prices THE Texas Exhibitors’ Circuit, an organization to combat high prices and aid exhibitors in mu- tually solving the problems of the mov- ing picture business, has been organized by South Texas exhibitors. It will eventually include exhibitors in all sec- tions of the state. The organization meeting was held at the Rice Hotel in Houston on Septem- ber 10. E. T. Peter, of Cuero and Yoak- um, was elected president. H. H. Elliott, of Corpus Christi, is vice president, and H. C. Stearns, of Kingsville, is secretary and treasurer. Directors are E. T. Peter, O. A. Engelbrecht of Temple, G. C. Cage, of Mercedes, F. L. Shubeck, of El Campo, Sam Schwartz, of Eagle Pass, and H. H. Staacke, of Seguin. E. T. Peter has established offices for the circuit in Dallas and will enlist North Texas exhibitors. Dumont Signs Contract With Famous Players JEAN MONTE DUMONT, who played the role of “The Dope” in “The Mir- acle Man,” a Paramount-Artcraft Special produced by George Loan Tuck- er, has been placed under contract by the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation and is now a member of , the stock com- pany at the Lasky studio. Mr. Dumont by his splendid work in the unforget- table “Miracle Man,” has proved his un- usual talent. Prior to Mr. Dumont’s work in “The Miracle Man,” he appeared in Smalley productions extensively. He is a Ken- tuckian and previous to his screen career was a stock actor and even had a fling at opera in Chicago. Pittsburg Meeting of M. P. Engineers President H. A.

Negotiations are under way for the establishment of extensive studios at Glen Haven on the shores of Irondequoit Bay. A repre- sentative of one of the big producing companies has been devoting consider- able time to an inspection of Glen Ha- ven and its environs, with a view to utilizing nature’s effects there for loca- tions. The New York State Railways own the property at Glen Haven, and ac- cording to an official of that concern the film man is expected to recommend to his company that they take over the bay property. The sand bluffs along the bay, the abundant verdure and the great variety of scenic effects possible, due to the pe- culiar topography of the bay region, are said to have made the film man quite enthusiastic. Surrounding the bay is a chain of picturesque hills, some wooded and some bare, numerous striking val- leys and prettily situated summer col- onies. These, with the added attrac- tions of Lake Ontario at the outlet of the bay, combined with the advantages of cheap power and light, proximity to a city base and the comparative isola- tion of Glen Haven are understood to be just what the producing company wants. Railway Company Considering Offer. Both a long lease and an outright purchase of the place are under dis- sussion, but Bertram E. Wilson, general passenger agent of the New York State Railways, says that his company is not prepared to make any announcement on the subject, although he admitted that such a producing plant may be established soon. He said that his com- pany has the expert opinion of motion picture people that the bay property is ideal for the making of pictures. It is understood that the film company now negotiating for the property would erect offices, laboratories and large dor- mitories in addition to the studio struc- tures. It is believed that the location in Rochester of the Eastman Kodak Com- pany is considered as an unusual advan- tage for any producing company which might locate in Rochester. In addition to being near the source of the raw film and other materials, it is expected that considerable use might be made of the extensive laboratories and other departments of the Eastman plants. Denver Showman Seeing New York H. E. Ellison, of the firm of Greaves & Ellison, manager of the Rialto and Princess theatres, Denver, left for home Wednesday evening, September 24, after spending a few days here as guest of Famous Players-Lasky. The World was represented at an interview with Mr. Ellison just before the Denverite took the train and in our next issue we will be able to present, at length, some in- teresting observations that limited time at our disposal will not permit us to prepare for this issue. One item of concern to Famous Players-Lasky would be here to note that Mr. Ellison took with him contracts for another year of Paramount pictures to be shown at both houses. Sid Grauman Introduced to Tradepaper Folk at Lunch JOHN C. FLINN, director of adver- tising and publicity for Famous Players-Lasky, introduced Sid Grau- man, manager of Grauman’s Million Dol- lar Theatre, Los Angeles, to writers for the film tradepapers at a very much enjoyed luncheon, September 19, at the Claridge Hotel. Elsewhere the readers of these lines will find a view of Mr. Grauman and those who came to meet him and eat of John Flinn’s generous i epast. As it was late in the week and far from pay-day for most of the tradepa- per people the majority of those in at- tendance had a special purpose and enthusiasm in welcoming Mr. Grauman to our city. Twelve years have elapsed since the Los Angeles showman was here and he must have noticed a great change in the town in general and the moving picture industry in particular. Mr. Grauman made a very graceful speech in which he told of his own ap- preciation of the trade papers ; briefly estimated their value to the picture showman, and declared with fervor that they were essential to the conduct of moving picture exhibition and distribu- tion. The luncheon was entirely infor- mal and developed into a most enjoyable event with Mr. Grauman making a per- sonal hit with the newspaper boys and girls — Agnes Smith and Louella Parsons. No Truth in “Big Four” Rumor, Says Abrams LAST week some over-zealous ru- mor-mongers reported that plans were under way whereby the prod- uct of United Artists Corporation — the “Big Four” — would be handled through the Goldwyn Distributing Organization. When this report was called to the attention of the United Artists Corpor- ation home office, it was stated that ab- solutely nothing was known of such a move and that the story was too pre- posterous to be given \"further consid- eration. Nevertheless, at the instance of sev- eral of the more conservative trade pa- pers, who had heard the story and who naturally wanted absolute verification before publication, the home office wired to Hiram Abrams, who is now at the Coast, to ascertain if any semblance of truth lay back of the report. Mr. Abrams has wired back an un- qualified and absolute denial. Julius Schwartz With Elks Julius Schwartz, who has been with the Fox Film Corporation for five years, has joined the Elk Photoplays’ sales force. Mr. Schwartz is known and well liked by exhibitors throughout Greater New York.

October 4, 1919 THE MOVING PICTURE WORLD 61 FILM THIEVES PLOT BUT QUICKLY FAIL WHEN LIVELY SHERLOCKS HOP HOT TRAIL AND LAND BOLD YEGGS IN WAITING JAIL A DEEP and dark mystery, a chase by sleuths over fences, fire-escapes and roofs, a thrilling night pursuit in a trailing taxicab at fifty miles an hour through Central Park — these are a few of the high spots in the latest instal- ment of the serial the Film Theft Committee of the National Association of the Motion Picture Industry is staging in its campaign against those who toil perversely in the attempt to mulct motion picture producers and distributors of photoplays on the reel. From 1:45 p. m. Saturday, September 13, to 11:30 on the night of the following day Special Representative W. C. Hawkins, of the Film Theft Committee, and Officer Brady, of the Forty-seventh Street Police Station, made five arrests, recovered a considerable amount of purloined film, slept one hour and called it a day. All that they were sore about afterwards was that they did not have a motion picture camera along, because in their judgment they would have been possessed at the end of a very valuable feature photoplay. Mr. Hawkins, for the past two weeks, has had a line on the activities of one Willie Feinberg, and another Moe Gold- man, whom die suspected of a plot to steal and dispose of the film known as “The Romance of Tarzan” and owned by the First National Exhibitors’ Circuit. A curious phase of the plot is that during all this time, and even after the arrest of the alleged film thieves, the First National had not missed a copy of the feature. The alleged method of work of the arrested men was ingenious and novel. “The Voice on the Wire.” It developed as follows : On Friday, the 12th, the copy of “The Romance of Tarzan” in question was shown at the Drury Lane Theatre in Harlem. About 10:30 at night the theatre got a phone call from a gentleman who stated that he was an official of the First National. This gentleman averred that he wished to send the film out of town immediately and asked the theatre man- agement if they had anyone who could escort it to the Pennsylvania Station at once. The theatre men, after con- sultation, replied that their porter would be glad to deliver the film to the repre- sentative of the First National, for a $2 note, provided a receipt was forth- coming at the other end. This was agreed to. “Two-Buck Bills” Are Hoodooed. The porter, according to his story, made $50 worth of speed to the station and was approached in the Concourse by a youth who exhibited signs of ex- cessive haste, not to say impatience. “What kep’ you?” demanded the youth. The porter registered indignation and attempted an explanation, but the hasty stranger, without more words, grabbed the film, thrust a two dollar bill into the porter’s extended hand and dis- appeared. The porter, it seems, ne- glected in the heat of his conflicting emotions to get a receipt for the film. In the meantime, Special Representa- tive Hawkins and I. J. Schmertz, man- ager of the Fox Film Corporation, were in the offing watching the transaction. With officer Brady they kept the youth who had taken the film in sight. They saw him rush out of the station and enter a waiting taxicab. They fol- lowed in another car. Burn Central Park’s Asphalt. The chase led them from the station up Broadway and into the Park, by which time both cars were going at breakneck speed. The second car drew up gradually and Hawkins, leaning from the driver’s seat, presented a short, blunt-nosed argument at the head of the driver of the first car. The first car stopped, and Feinberg and Goldman were discovered inside with the film in their possession. The next scene, at the police station, was less spectacular but quite as effec- tive. The next morning, in Jefferson Market police court, Goldman was iden- tified by the porter as the hasty youth of the station concourse and the two alleged malefactors were granted a con- tinuance until Sept. 24. This episode was only an appetizer for Hawkins and Officer Brady. The former had been in constant touch with Chairman H. Minot Pitman, of the Film Theft Committee for several weeks and had lined up another case for a break on Sunday. “Sleuthing” an “Inside Job.” They had discovered, it is alleged, that Al Lehrer, head shipping clerk of the Select Pictures Corporation ; Joseph Spreckman, assistant shipping clerk of the same company and a cousin of Lehrer, and Barney Alvin, who was ar- rested thirteen months ago with 392 reels of Triangle film in his possession and released on suspended sentence, has been arranging an ambitious plan of circulating Select features among busi- ness acquaintances without the knowl- edge of the company which owned the film. They possessed, it is said, a complete list of every picture the Select has on hand, and had checked off in pencil, it is understood, features which could be furnished interested parties for a rea- sonable sum within twenty-four hours. Hawkins brought this information to the knowledge of Samuel E. Morris, general manager of Select, J. J. Rotch- ford, assistant general manager, R. W. France, attorney for the company, and Chairman Pitman of the Film Theft Committee. Also he had in this case, as well as in the first, the advice of Assistant Attorney A. B. Unger. “Better the Day, Better the Deed.” On Saturday night Hawkins learned, he says, that the delivery of ten Select features was to be made Sunday morn- ing at 9 a. m. at a house whose loca- tion he had discovered. At 8 o’clock, he and Officer Brady climbed five fences in the rear of the suspected building, clambered up a fire escape and covered a room where they could overhear the sales talk of the men they were after. The first lot of Select films, accord- ing to the officers, changed hands in that room about 10 a. m. $100 also changed hands. Spreckman and Alvin, according to the officers, then went for more film. As this was being delivered, Hawkins and Brady broke into the room and arrested Alvin. Spreckman was picked up on the street later. The prisoners f “Yes, Madam, I Killed Them with My Little Bow and Arrow. Step Right In.” Warren Kerrington shoots up an army of extras a la imagination in his newest Hodkinson, “The Joyous Liar.” 62 THE MOVING PICTURE WORLD were taken to the Forty-seventh street station and left there. “Cool Hundred” Passes Again. The officers then went to the Select exchange and arrested A1 Lehrer, who turned over $100 which, it is said, he received for the first lot of film dis- posed of. The three men were ar- raigned in the Fifty-fourth street Magistrate’s Court on Monday, the 15th, and a continuance was granted until Wednesday morning, the 17th, when all were bound over for action by the Grand Jury. These arrests, it is hoped, will bring home to those members of the ring CO-OPERATION to the utmost be- tween the producer, the exchange and the exhibitor on one hand and the exhibitor and the newspaper on the other will be brought about by the transcontinental trip which Winifield R. Sheehan, general manager, and Arthur James, supervisor of advertising and publicity, of Fox Film Corporation, are now making. The trip to and from the Pacific Coast will take in every city in which there is a Fox exchange between New York and San Diego, Cal. That the exhibitor may realize to the full the value of advertising and that the newspapers may not underestimate the news and circulation value of the motion picture department it is the in- tention of Mr. Sheehan and Mr. James to seek in every large city a newspaper and an advertising expert who fully understand the local conditions and who will co-operate to the utmost with all exhibitors in the exploitation of the features produced by the Fox company. Service for Large and Small Showmen. No theatre will be too small to receive this service. No advertisement will be too large for this expert to handle. He will place in the local papers news and publicity features of interest to the motion picture public of the community in its relation to productions then show- ing or about to show at the local theatres. Working in close touch with the home office of Fox Film Corporation the local publicity representative will have at his command at all times the latest in- formation regarding Fox pictures and Fox stars. It will be his duty to present to the local papers such matter as best suits their needs. He will be able to add to the news columns of the press in the city in which he is stationed, as well as in the country immediately adjacent to it. features that have both a distinct news value and a publicity value to the exhibitor. Exhibitor to Have Every Aid. In the writing and the arrangement of advertising in the press this trained newspaper man will be at the command of the exhibitor, to whom he will tender his advice and suggestions as to the proper exploitation of Fox features. Every aid that enters into the adver- tisine and exploitation of a feature will be offered to the exhibitor. It is believed that in this manner the true value of the press in its relation to the picture theatre and producer will be realized. of film thieves still operating a realiza- tion of the fact that the National Asso- ciations’ Committee means business in its fight against them. In the last few months, a number of prior arrests had been made and thousands of dollars’ worth of stolen film recovered. Special Announcement ! It is the intention of Mr. Pitman, who is conducting .the campaign, to spare no efforts or expense in success- fully consummating his determination to put every one of these thieves where they will be unable to prosecute this avocation further. W. P. LAWSON. By the time they return to New York Mr. Sheehan and Mr. James will have completed a most complete program of advertising and publicity. A study of conditions in each city will be made and talks with the managers of Fox ex- changes, the exhibitors and editors will conclude preparation for the picture advertising and exploitation campaign. Service to Be Supplementary. This service will be a supplementary one. The home office in New York will continue to send out its large eight- page exploitation campaign sheet on all Pearl White, William Farnum, Tom Mix and Theda Bara super-productions. The Fox News, Fox Sunshine Comedies or special features will be covered as com- pletely for general exploitation and advertising as is possible from the main office. But in addition to this Fox Film Corporation will work through the local representatives throughout the country Minister Purchases Simplex.

Polo Company Arrives in Canada. Last minute news was received to the effect that the Eddie Polo-Universal serial expedition had arrived in Mon- treal on Tuesday, September 23. The company will film a few scenes there and then proceed to Universal City in- stead of coming to New York, as was previously announced. The serial is titled “The Thirteenth Hour” and is being directed by J. P. McGowan, well- known serial director. Hope Loring, continuity writer with the company, will come to New York to assist in the editing of the film and the writing of the titles. American Legion Getting Behind Propaganda Film A UNIQUE exploitation campaign is now being launched by W. H. Pro- ductions Company on “Every- body’s Business,” now being sold on the state rights market. H. C. Witwer’s novelization of the story will appear in serial form in newspapers that will give nation-wide publicity to the production. There is scarcely a home in the coun- try which does not hold a veteran of the war — probably a member of the American Legion. Through this growing and powerful organization, which will finally be com- posed of approximately four million men, every home in the United States will learn of and want to see this pro- duction. It is “everybody’s business” to be en- lightened on the insidious powers at work on the very roots of society, and it is “everybody’s business” to recognize the foul tricks employed to undermine our homes and happiness. Not only the American Legion is back of the photoplay, but every patriotic na- tional civic organization, every school, college and community center is pledg- ing its help. These organizations are arousing a great interest in “Every- body’s Business.” Upon reviewing the picture, one of the officials of the American Legion thus commented : “I want to thank you for the opportunity afforded me re- cently to review ‘Everybody’s Business.’ “Above all, I believe it will do much to accomplish one special purpose — to enlighten the public on the methods pursued by the Bolshevists in their ef- forts to create lawlessness, disorder and unrest among the working classes. I sincerely hope that you can arrange to have it produced in every motion picture house in the United States.” Theatres for sale: theatres for rent, and theatres wanted bv lire managers are listed very frequently in The World’s Classified Advertising Department. FOX OFFICIALS ON CROSS-COUNTRY TRIP Winifield Sheehan and Arthur James Arranging for Close Co-operation Between Showmen and Dailies October 4, 1919 THE MOVING PICTURE WORLD 63 “Forget All Differences ’’-Rent busch Writes Cohen on Tax Revision Urging That All Stand Together Indianapolis, Ind., Sept. 17, 1919. “Sidney Cohen, New York City, N. Y. “My dear Sidney: “Your favor of Aug. 18 at hand and I am very glad to know that New York State Exhibitors are well organized and working successfully. Our ever hope is to see all states organized to the very last exhibitors promoting the best in- terests of the exhibitor and the entire industry and it is this wish that we de- sire to express in our reply now. “Your letter states, ‘We must once and for all build up a real representa- tive organization.’ Every exhibitor will agree with this fact and we are urging that all assist in bringing this about, no matter what our personal feelings are. “The National Organization is not wedded to any particular plan of or- ganization. If the congressional plan of representation or any other plan should please the majority it will be adopted. “Our constitution, by-laws and basis of representation can be changed at any time by the Executive Committee com- posed of one member from each state. We can vote on a question by mail or wire, when urgent. “Therefore let me plead that we for- get all differences and all personalities at this time and give our entire atten- tion and energies to the one great prob- lem before us, tax revision. “Let us not go before Congress in broken groups and each group with a different idea and angle of what should be done and all working at cross pur- poses as we have in the past. If we go before Congress in any way except as one national body we may just as well stay at home and save our efforts. “The very reason why we are bur- dened with more than our just share of taxes is because in the past we have always divided ourselves against our- selves. There have been times when Congress wanted to know and was much annoyed and displeased because they could not get the facts for the reason that various groups had various and conflicting requests and suggestions on the matter of just taxation. “Therefore it seems to me there can be only one thing to do and that is to all work together as one body in the tax revision work at this time, and whatever else is to be done to adjust such differences as soon as possible af- terwards. “I_ confess that the convention at St. Louis did not accomplish all the things we should, but it was mostly due to the intense heat that our meetings were cut short. We could hardly keep the ex- hibitors in session on account of the dis- comfort of the heat and that goes for the officers also. Next year at Ocean View _we will have a cool spot that will lend itself to more agreeable meeting conditions and we can have a great ‘get together’ meeting at that time- “In closing let me reiterate again my appeal to you and all exhibitors to join in one effort to bring about tax revi- sion. Let us do everything possible to the end that there may be one tax effort on the part of all exhibitors in one body, IF YOU are an exhibitor, ten to one you don’t need an introduction to E. C. (Gulliver) Jensen, Goldwyn’s energetic sales promoter, who left the home office last week to visit Goldwyn exchanges in the Middle West. Mr. Jensen’s schedule calls for stops at De- troit, Chicago, Minneapolis, Omaha and Kansas City, but it is likely the trip will be extended, for once he gets away from New York there is no knowing where Jensen’s travels will take him. That is why they call him “Gulliver” Jensen. Mr. Jensen is a recent acquisition to the sales organization that Felix F. Feist is building up in the Goldwyn Dis- tributing Corporation, but he is an old associate of Mr. Feist and a motion pic- ture man of the broadest experience. There is no angle of the marketing of film with which Mr. Jensen has not come in personal touch. Started as Office Boy.

Soon he became assistant purchasing agent, then manager of the poster department and booker, and in less than four years he was sent to Chicago as head of Kinemacolor’s branch there. Mr. Jen- sen is credited with launching the F-I-L-M clubs in the middle western metropolis. With the passing of Kinemacolor, the young branch manager returned east and opened the Feature Booking Office in Brooklyn. Before long he was called back to Chicago as assistant manager of the Celebrated Players Film Com- pany. Then he was selected by Mr. Feist as the ideal executive to head the Chicago branch of the World Film Cor- poration. Having organized the Chicago office, Mr. Jensen was appointed western divi- sion manager. He was so successful that his abilities as an organizer were given a broader outlet in the capacity of general field representative, an office that he held until he entered the army. Soon after his discharge, Mr. Feist se- cured him to spread the gospel of Gold- wyn pictures. “Last of the Seminoles” Is Latest Prizma Picture WORLD PICTURES will h^ve ready for distribution this com- ing week a new Prizma natural color picture entitled “The Last of the Seminoles. . This release has just come from the Prizma laboratories and is one of the most interesting subjects so far put out by this company. It was taken deep in the Everglades of Florida where 500 Seminoles, the remnant of the last of a nation of 50,000 red men live It is an interesting portrayal of the cus- toms of a people almost extinct. Their camps are scattered far and wide and it is a difficult task to find and photograph them. Just recently, how- ever, an expedition sent out by Prizma Inc., producers of motion pictures in nature s colors, has been successful in penetrating the Everglades and bring- lng back a story of the life and habits ot this fast disappearing race. iiiimiimimmiumiiiimiiiiiimmmiiiiiMmimi “Gulliver” Jenson, Energetic Sales Promoter, on Tour of Goldwyn' s Middle West Exchanges 6+ THE MOVING PICTURE WORLD October 4, 1919 MADE SALES HEAD OF NICHOLAS POWER President Earl Appoints S. S. Cassard Sales Manager — de Hart Becomes an Assistant — Business Increasing THE cinemachinery trade through- out the United States and Canada is interested in the announcement which has just been made by the Nich- olas Power Company, Inc., of the ap- pointment of S. S. Cassard, as sales manager of the organization, and the enlargement of the office sales force through the addition of another assist- ant sales manager in the person of S. E. deHart. The formal announcement of the changes has just been made by let- ter to the various Power’s distributors and dealers throughout the country. F. J. Bird, for the past four months assist- ant sales manager, continues in the same capacity and with Mr. deHart will work under the direction of Mr. Cassard. The enlargement of the sales force and its reorganization along the lines indicated, has been made necessary by the recent rapid increase of the Power’s business and the development of plans which the company has had under way for some time, looking toward an even more active sales campaign in the fu- ture. The changes are the result of investi- gations ’ and conferences by Edward Earl and Will C. Smith, respectively president and general manager of the company. “We have found,” said Mr. Earl, “that our business has been steadily outgrow- ing its methods of sales and service. We have decided that inasmuch as the long established Power’s policy, which calls for genuine and careful personal attention to every detail of our busi- ness representing contact with cus- tomers or prospects, must be main- tained, the changes we have just made are necessary.” Cassard Well Known to Earl. Neither Mr. Earl nor Mr. Smith cared to discuss in detail the plans for the future, which have to some extent in- fluenced the enlargement of the sales force. “The state of near chaos,” said Mr. Smith, “which was created in practically every manufacturing plant because of war conditions is now a thing of the past as far as we are concerned. Our plant is working at a higher rate of speed and efficiency than it has enjoyed at any previous period of its existence.” S. S. Cassard, the new sales manager of the company, is new only as to title. He has been identified with the com- pany for many years, and before joining the Power’s forces was identified with President Earl as sales manager of a well known brass company. Mr. Cas- sard came to the Power’s company as purchasing agent, and more recently has been assistant general manager. When interviewed on the subject of his promotion, Mr. Cassard remarked, “A selling organization can make its sales manager as big as he will let it. I am going to let it.” Mr. Cassard is already widely known among moving picture people throughout the United States and Canada, but under the new arrangement he will enjoy even greater personal contact with the rank and file of the industry, in view of the fact that he expects to make frequent trips throughout the country in the interests of the company. Mr. Bird and Mr. deHart, assistant sales managers, have also been in the employ of the Power’s company for a number of years. They have earned their promotion by rendering valuable service. Trade Paper Inserts Form Realart Advertising Book SO far as we know the beautiful tradepaper “inserts” of distributors of moving pictures have never been used in exactly the same form that Realart is now applying them to sales promotion. Realart’s inserts in Moving Picture World have stood handsomely the test of comparison with similar ad- vertising for other firms and taking them beyond their initial use, Realart is pioneering — even in its youth. Jay A. Gove, associate director of Realart publicity, has shown us a very attractive formation of inserts duplicat- ing those that have appeared in Moving Picture World — bound in heavy paper, tied with cord and opening as a book of art that is sure to arrest attention. The work embraces sixteen pages and cover. Inserts Are Localized. In the booklet that is sent to Realart exchanges and mailed to exhibitors there is an additional insert that car- ries “Realart Talk” and a list of branch distributing plants. The front cover of the booklet also carries, to exhibitors, a “foreword” of importance. Thus does Realart localize its inserts. In placing the original order with the insert-printers, allowance is made for the extra quantities necessary to form the booklet, and it is fair to presume that exhibitors will be well covered. If in the great mass of mail every pic- ture showman gets every day these booklets do not get waste-basketed, the exhibitor will have an attractive souvenir. If, on the other hand, the showman doesn’t open the Realart envelope he will see the same inserts in the Moving Picture World — which he pays $3 for, always opens, reads and files for daily reference and help in conducting his house. Begin Work on “Peddler of Lie*.” Coincident with the first installment of Henry C. Rowland’s novel, “The Peddler,” in the Saturday Evening Post on Thursday, September 18, Universal started work on the screen version of the story under the title of “The Peddler of Lies,” and the probabilities are that the photoplay will be ready for release as soon as the novel has run its course in the popular weekly.

October 4, 1919 THE MOVING PICTURE WORLD 65 “Big Money” Shows In Theatre War That Is Making Southwest Battle Field of Bitter Opposition Fight “Big Money” in Corporation. E. H. Hulsey, Hershel Stuart, owner and general manager of the Hulsey in- terests, respectively, and Murphy W. Townsend, a prominent Dallas lawyer and capitalist, are the incorporators of the new concern. The list of stockholders is a most imposing one and for the first time un- veils the scope of the Hulsey operations and shows that the battle against the S. A. Lynch policies will be carried through to the nearby states of Louisi- ana and Mississippi where, finally, the Saenger Amusement Corporation has shown its hand and aligned itself with the Texans and Oklahomans. Not only moving picture exhibitors, who own and control no less than sev- enty first class theatres in the five states mentioned, but also bankers and capi- talists who are known throughout the Southwest are included in the stock- holders of the new corporation. Heavy Line-Up of Interests. SPARKS are flying merrily in the battle between the S. A. Lynch Enterprises and leading exhibitors in Southwestern territory who resent the policy of the Eastern corporation in seeking control of theatres in this section of the country. So says our Dallas correspondent. The S. A. Lynch Enterprises, Sept. 24, announced the purchase of an ideal the- atre site in the heart of the Dallas busi- ness section for the sum of $160,000 and declared their intention of immediately building a new theatre which will ac- commodate 2,500 people. On Saturday came the reply from the camp of the Southwestern exhibitors in the form of the incorporation of the United Amusement Company. This con- cern will have as its object the purchase outright, the building of, or the pur- chase of controlling interest in moving picture theatres throug"
