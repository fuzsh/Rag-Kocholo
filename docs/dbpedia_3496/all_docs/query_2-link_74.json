        "text": "Here we have a photo of a movie house called College Theater (so named because it was around the corner from the State Normal School, which was a teaching college.) It was at 449 S. Hill St in downtown Los Angeles which also put in a block from Pershing Square right in the heart of downtown. The double bill at the time was “Blonde by Choice” and “Pretty Clothes” both of which came out in late 1927. By the time this photo was taken, “The Jazz Singer” had come out, so places like this were on the way out—even if all seats were 10 cents, as the sign says.\n\nLisa K says: “From the Los Angeles Evening Post-Record 11/20/1922, next door to the theater it looks like Leighton Dairy Lunch. Address shows 441 S Hill St, looks like it’s the right business. An employee owned cafeteria.”\n\nThis is how that view looked in February 2023."
