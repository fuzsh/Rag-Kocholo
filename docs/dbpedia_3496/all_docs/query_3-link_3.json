Photo: Paramount. <b>Walter Hiers</b> in <i>Mr. Billings Spends His Dime</i> (Wesley Ruggles, 1923).\n\t\n\t<b>Walter Hiers</b> (1893-1933) was an American screen actor. During his two decade-long acting career, spanning from 1912 to 1932, he acted in over a 100 films. \n\t\n\tWalter Hiers started out in 1912 in shorts by the Edison company, with William Wadsworth in the lead. In 1913 -1914, he played at Lubin's, followed by a wide range of companies in subsequent years. In 1916 he did a whole string of shorts for Thanhouser. In the course of 1916 he went over to Famous Players, where he started acting in features, but acted at other companies as well, such as Frohmann, Vitagraph, Select Pictures, Paramount, Goldwyn, etc. He had substantial roles in e.g. Seventeen (Robert Vignola, 1916) with Jack Pickford, The Mysterious Miss Terry (J. Searle Dawley, 1917) with Billie Burke, Our Little Wife (Edward Dillon, 1917) with Madge Kennedy, A Nymph of the Foothills (Frederick A. Thomson, 1918), Experimental Marriage (Robert Vignola, 1919) with Constance Talmadge, When Doctors Disagree (Victor Schertzinger, 1919) with Mabel Normand, and The Fear Woman (John Barry, 1919) with Pauline Frederick. \n\t\n\tIn the 1920s, Walter  Hiers alternated Paramount/Famous Players with companies such as Realart Pictures. Memorable titles from the 1920s in which Hiers had substantial parts as e.g. antagonists of the male or female star, were for instance a large string of films with the female Hollywood star Wanda Hawley:  Mrs. Temple's Telegram (James Cruze, 1920), Miss Hobbs (Donald Crisp, 1920), The Snob (Sam Wood, 1921), Her Sturdy Oak (Thomas Heffron, 1920), and A Kiss in Time (Th. Heffron, 1921). Other memorable films with Hiers in the 1920s were What's Your Husband Doing? (Lloyd Ingraham, 1920) with Douglas MacLean, The Fourteenth Man (Joseph, Henabery 1920 with Robert Warwick), So Long Letty (Al Christie, 1920) with Colleen Moore,  A City Sparrow (Sam Wood, 1920) with Ethel Clayton, Oh, Lady, Lady (Maurice Campbell, 1920) with Bebe Daniels, The Speed Girl (M. Campbell, 1921) with Bebe Daniels,  Bought and Paid For (William deMille, 1921) with Agnes Ayres, Her Gilded Cage (Sam Wood, 1922) with Gloria Swanson, James Cruze's Is Matrimony a Failure (1922) with Lois Wilson and Lila Lee, and The Ghost Breaker (Al Green, 1922) with Wallace Read and Lila Lee. According to an interview with Hiers in 1923 in Picture-Play Magazine, it was Bought and Paid For that provided Hiers with his breakthrough. Famous Players, for whom he had been acting for years, now gave him a new contract too. \n\t\n\tIn 1923 Walter Hiers had the male lead in Wesley Ruggles' comedy for Paramount, Mr. Billings Spends His Dime, with Jacqueline Logan and George Fawcett as his co-stars. As Hiers says in his interview, &quot;I fall in love with a girl in a movie show - see her in a news weekly - and follow her to South America, almost get carved up by a chili con carne army in gold braid and all that. But my dime brings me  fortune and the girl - Jacqueline Logan - pretty good return on the original investment, what?&quot;  Apparently the film went well, as this led to more comedies with himself in the lead such as Sixty Cents an Hour (Joseph Henabery, 1923), and Fair Week (Rob Wagner, 1924), while Hiers also starred in several short comedies at Christie, often directed by Archie Mayo, such as Short Change (1924), and Good Spirits (1925). Meanwhile he was also co-acting in dramas such as Flaming Barriers (George Melford, 1924) with Jacqueline Logan and Antonio Moreno. By 1927 Hiers was rather acting in films directed by e.g. George Archainbaud at Tiffany's and directed by e.g. Wesley Ruggles at Universal; this combined with the Christie comedies. Being a typical silent actor, Hiers acted in early sound films of the early 1930s but only in bit parts, and less often than before. Walter Hiers was a particularly prolific actor who could star in over 10 films a year. In 1923 he was married to Adah Lavinia 'Peaches' McWilliams, daughter of a wealthy shoe manufacturer. He died in 1933 in Los Angeles, California, from pneumonia, aged (only) 39. \n\t\n\tSources: <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/stream/Picture-playMagazineApril1923/PicturePlay0423#page/n0/mode/1up\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.archive.org/stream/Picture-playMagazineApril1923/Pict...</a>, Wikipedia, and IMDb. \n\t\n\tFor more postcards, a bio and clips check out our blog <a href=\"http://filmstarpostcards.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">European Film Star Postcards</a>.",
