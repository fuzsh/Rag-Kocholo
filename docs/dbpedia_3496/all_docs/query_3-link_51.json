        "text": "“The Plucky Hoodoo”\n\n“Slapstick comedy of the rube farmer type, featuring a country blacksmith, a lazy farmhand and a city family visiting the country in their automobile. The new farmhand has all sorts of troubles with his employer, but finally proves himself a hero (?) and wins the farmer’s daughter.” Descriptive Catalogue of Kodascope Library Motion Pictures, 1926 Reel #4020, Code GADA, listed as an independent production. 1800 feet “standard length” 2 reels.\n\nOccasionally misreported in the trade press as “The Lucky Hoodoo,” which is also the name of a Broadway musical by that name, starring Billy B. Van and the Beaumont sisters.\n\nThe only surviving film of Billy B. Van exists on a poor quality videotape-to-DVD copy of unknown origin.\n\nThe Reelcraft Royal Comedy series\n\n“Snakes,” “The Plucky Hoodoo” and “Where Are Your Husbands?” reported in wide release by Reelcraft in 1920\n\n“More Bull” (1920)\n\nMentioned as a title for the first Billy B. Van Reelcraft Royal Comedy. Subsequent reports state that the first Billy B. Van film for the Royal Comedies was titled “Snakes.”\n\n“Snakes” (1920) Reelcraft Pictures Royal Comedy\n\nThe first or second Billy B. Van film for the Reelcraft Royal Comedy series.\n\n“Bolshevism and bombs were a much more popular topic for discussion up to about a year ago than they are today, and this Billy B. Van comedy obviously was made at that time. While it is somewhat disconnected at times, there are several humorous bits and the production as a whole is acceptable. Well photographed in most places, this maintains a reasonably good average and should get over in quite a few houses. Some of the hokum is of the rather hackneyed type, but much of it can be depended upon to hold its own. This is the second of the series of Royal Comedies.” – The Film Daily, August 1, 1920\n\n“Where Are Your Husbands?” (1920) Reelcraft Pictures Royal Comedy\n\nPossibly the 5th Billy B. Van film for the Reelcraft Royal Comedy series\n\n“Obviously this two reeler, one of a set known as Royal Comedies and starring Billy B. Van, was made before the end of the war, for it is sort of a burlesque on the conflict. A fight of American women to protect their talcum powder forms the backbone of the piece, the effeminate habits cultivated by the men during the absence of their wives being depicted through-out most of the footage. As many people will expect, it turns out to be a dream at the finish, while the principle gleeful over the fact that what has passed was merely a nightmare. Generally an average comedy which is not timely now.” – The Film Daily August 29, 1920\n\n“The Plucky Hoodoo” (1920) Reelcraft Pictures Royal Comedy.\n\nPossibly the 4th Billy B. Van film for the Reelcraft Royal Comedy series.\n\nAlso mentioned in the Kodascope Library (mentioned above): “Slapstick comedy of the rube farmer type, featuring a country blacksmith, a lazy farmhand and a city family visiting the country in their automobile. The new farmhand has all sorts of troubles with his employer, but finally proves himself a hero (?) and wins the farmer’s daughter.” Descriptive Catalogue of Kodascope Library Motion Pictures, 1926 Reel #4020, Code GADA, listed as an independent production. 1800 feet “standard length” 2 reels\n\nOccasionally misreported in the trade press as “The Lucky Hoodoo,” which is also the name of a Broadway musical by that name, starring Billy B. Van and the Beaumont sisters.\n\nThe only surviving film of Billy B. Van exists on a poor quality videotape-to-DVD copy of unknown origin.\n\nThe Miller & Steen releases\n\nAdvertised in 1925, likely made in 1915. Silent film star Walter Hiers, who appears in at least some of the films mentioned, stated in 1925 that the films were made “10 years ago.” All believed to be filmed at least in part in New Hampshire.\n\n“Some Hero”\n\n“The New Clerk”\n\n“The Inventor”\n\n“Bootlegger’s Legacy”\n\n“The New Woman”\n\n“The Janitor’s Birthday” (this title is also mentioned in 1915)\n\nOther Billy B. Van films\n\n“The Beauty Shop” (1922)\n\nA Cosmopolitan Production, Released by Paramount Pictures, 1h 10min\n\nAdapted from the musical comedy of the same name, Billy B. Van appears as the character “Sobini,” the undertaker. He appears with his long-time vaudeville co-star Jim Corbett: “Billy B. Van and James J. Corbett will play the parts of prominent Bolognians who conspire to make Dr. Budd’s life in their native country a series of highly uncomfortable thrills.”\n\n“Dr. Budd, beauty doctor, faces bankruptcy- when suddenly he is told that he is the descendant of the famous Sizerellas, and a fortune awaits him in Bolognia. With his ward, Anna, and her fiancé, Briggs, Budd travels to Bolognia only to be told there is no fortune, but he must settle a family feud by fighting a duel. The only way out of the duel is by marrying the innkeeper’s funny-looking daughter. But when Budd’s beauty lotion makes the girl beautiful he is permitted to leave Bolognia and go back to America where the success of his preparation will make him rich.” The Film Daily, May 14, 1922\n\nWidely released and reviewed. Not filmed in New Hampshire.\n\n“Down the Well”/ \"Toy Film\" No Date (16mm film in the home wasn’t widely available until 1923)\n\nListed on the Billy B.

Van films mentioned on the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). No mention found elsewhere:\n\n“Why Women Go to War” (1920) Attributed to George Kleine Productions\n\n“Screen Snapshots, Series 2, No. 9-F” (1921)\n\nFederated Film Exchanges of America, Inc. Produced by Jack Cohn and Louis Lewyn.

Billy B. Van has so far not been identified in the film.\n\nOther films purported to have appearances of Billy B. Van\n\n“The White Sin” (1924)\n\nAdvertising for the film mentions Billy B. Van as a cast member. One of many times Billy B. Van was confused with another silent film star of the day, Billy Bevan. While this confusion is common, it is unusual to see it in print.\n\nFilm titles mentioned by Lake Sunapee-area residents\n\n“When the Town Went Dry\"\n\n\"Zulu Nightmare\" (or possibly \"Zooloo Nightmare\")"
