Father John D. Kempf (Ohio)\n\nNational Chaplain\n\nLet us pray. We thank You, Father, for this time of silence and this time to pray.\n\nGod, our Father, we ask You that during these two days, Your Kingship will become\n\nevident in our lives. May we become obedient to Your authority. May we reflect Your\n\ncharacter in our thoughts and our actions. May we welcome and honor Your presence in\n\nour deliberations.\n\nYou know, Father, that we come here in different states of mind, some are sure and\n\nconfident, others are wavering and uncertain; some feel good about themselves, while\n\nothers are almost drowning in personal and family problems. But whatever our state of\n\nmind and art, we are pleased that You want us to be here to assist in Your work in\n\nformulating the programs of The American Legion, and hopefully, assisting You in\n\nforming good citizens for Heaven.\n\nI would like to leave you with the thought for today: We often associate theology\n\nwith gray-haired, weak-eyed professors poring over yellow pages of great lexicons. That\n\nis unfortunate, because theology means knowledge of God and knowledge of God is\n\neveryone’s business, Amen.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nNATIONAL COMMANDER KELLER: Will you join with me in reciting the Preamble to the Constitution of The American Legion.\n\n. . .

Like most of you, I have been here many times in one capacity or\n\nanother. But I think that to me and to those of you who are sitting here this morning,\n\nand particularly those who are sitting here in the National Executive Committee for the\n\nfirst time, the perspective this time is very unique.\n\nAs National Officers, we look at The American Legion from an entirely different\n\nangle. Our scope is wider; and our sense of responsibility is greater, and our appreciation for tasks that he ahead of us gives us a deeper sense of duty perhaps than it does to\n\nothers. And that is the way it should be, because I doubt that any of you would be here\n\nif you did not feel strongly about this organization and what it is capable of doing.\n\nIn this room, I have had the opportunity over the years to watch the operation of the\n\nNEC. I have seen emotions run high, occasionally tempers flare, and opinions clash in\n\nthis group. But I believe that The American Legion is better for those happenings. And\n\nas for me, I came to this office with a deep and abiding sense of commission.\n\nI have been privileged to be a member of the Organization for more than 30 years in\n\nthe past, and through the past, it has become apparent to me that one of the many\n\npillars upon which this Organization was founded, the pillar of community service, was\n\nbending beneath its own weight.\n\nAs we fought even harder, and with even greater urgency to shore up or defend\n\nveterans’ benefits, to perpetuate our way of life, and to join in the decisions affecting\n\nour National well-being, I have seen, and I think you will agree, erosion in the influence\n\nand prestige of The American Legion in our home towns. And this, despite the decades\n\nof success and triumph that we have enjoyed as a responsible National voice.\n\nWe have been pushed from the center of our community to the edge in so many areas\n\nof this Nation. Community service that is a visible, continuing and everyday\n\ninvolvement in the decisions of the events that affect our fellow citizens every day of\n\ntheir lives, seems to have been lost in a drive to maintain our National prestige.\n\nMy fellow Legionnaires, I firmly believe your job of directing the National programs\n\nand the activities of The American Legion has become more difficult over the years\n\nbecause of that.\n\nI have said before, and I want to say it again, America remains a Nation where policy\n\nproceeds from the bottom up, where the opinions and the values that prevail on Main\n\nStreet, where the hopes and prayers of the fellow next door are the policies and the\n\nvalues and needs that should determine our Nation’s course.\n\nI believe that a great majority of Americans all across the country share our beliefs.\n\nI submit to you that our successes can be even greater if we begin now to marshall\n\nthe vast support of the American people in our cause on their behalf.\n\nOur greatest responsibility of course, is to enlist the millions of men and women in\n\nthis country, veterans and non-veterans alike in the great causes and the values we\n\nchampion. We can do that by demonstrating our concerns and acting on our beliefs,\n\nwhere all Americans can see them in action, in our own communities.\n\nI urge you to join with me in reviving the community service tradition of The\n\nAmerican Legion. The actions that we take here in these next two days, the decisions\n\nthat we make, and the forces that we put into motion will have greater meaning and\n\ngreater impact as we work to shore up the foundation of community services.\n\nSo let’s get on with it this morning. Thank you very much.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nNATIONAL COMMANDER KELLER: Someone tells me that we are on schedule,\n\nand the schedule before you says that we have a very distinguished visitor with us this\n\nmorning.\n\nSo it is my great privilege to present to you this morning, the National President and\n\nher corps of Officers, Mrs. June Stolte of Missouri.\n\nSergeant-at-Arms, will you please escort Mrs. Stolte to the podium.\n\n... National President of the American Legion Auxiliary, Mrs. Walter Stolte, was\n\nProceedings of Wednesday, October 13, 1982\n\n1\n\nescorted with her Officers to the podium, amidst the standing applause of the\n\ndelegation.\n\nMrs. Walter Stolte (Missouri)\n\nNational President\n\nAmerican Legion Auxiliary\n\nCommander Keller, National Officers, and to you distinguished Legionnaires in thenred caps and also the blue. You look really great to me this morning. I want you all to\n\nknow that, and especially there are about four over there from Missouri that are real\n\nspecial to me also.\n\nIt is great for this National President to bring greetings to the National Executive\n\nCommitteemen, and to tell you what a pleasure it is for this National President to greet\n\nyou.\n\nMany of you I have met prior to this meeting, and I am looking forward to meeting\n\nwith all of you as I visit your states. This Roy Stone is sitting up here grinning from ear\n\nto ear. I know he is up to something, but we will tell you about that later.\n\nAs I said to the Department Commanders and Adjutants the other day, I want to\n\nexpress my sincere thanks to the Legion for giving me such an outstanding Commander to work with. In my books, he is the finest gentleman that I have the pleasure\n\nof knowing.\n\nAnd as I said, at his Homecoming, and I will say it to you again, if I could have handpicked my Commander, I couldn’t have chosen a finer one. We were already neighbors,\n\nyou know. He is from Illinois and I am from Missouri. But now we are a team.\n\nBecause I believe in America, “Let Freedom Ring” is my theme this year. A rallying\n\ncry for patriots everywhere. We are fortunate to be citizens of a country where we can\n\nsay what we think, go where we please, make our own choices, and in return, we owe our\n\ncountry our loyalty and our love.\n\nWhen we repeat the Preamble to the Constitution of our Organization, we state, “to\n\nsafeguard and transmit to posterity the principles of justice, freedom and democracy.”\n\nAnd these dozen words, we say so much. We, above all others know that a democratic\n\ngovernment does not work without freedom.\n\nOur Organizations were formed to fight for freedom at home after we fought overseas. We are challenged to make America we love even greater, because we are who we\n\nare and what we are, and we have our finger on the pulse of every community in the\n\nNation. We know the needs and the desires of the people just like us.\n\nThe American Legion and the American Legion Auxiliary are very important to our\n\ncommunity. VIPs, Vocally Involved Patriots, we do so much for the total community,\n\nfrom infants to the elderly, our concern is for all Americans. We know that, but does the\n\ncommunity? Do they know what we are fighting for today? With different weapons for\n\nthe same principles that took our members into four wars.\n\nWe do so much, but all too often, we share it with only our members and our friends.\n\nMake a stranger a friend; make a friend a member.\n\nWe must rekindle the spirit of patriotism that is in the heart of every American. Our\n\njob is to fan that spark to a flame.\n\nI personally challenge each of you to sign up every eligible man and woman in the\n\ncommunity to add their voices to ours for you, the VIPs, the Vocally Involved Patriots\n\nhave vowed to let freedom ring. Every one of you is important to me, to the American\n\nLegion Auxiliary, and to America.\n\nHelp us “Let Freedom Ring” even louder this year.\n\nIt is my pleasure being with you this morning, and I appreciate it so much.\n\nNATIONAL COMMANDER KELLER: We are going to tell you now.\n\nJune appeared at one of our sessions two days ago, I think, and asked if we would be\n\nready for our membership challenge. Being a sucker for deals made by pretty-looking\n\ngirls, I said, sure, we are ready for a membership challenge. So here is what happened.\n\nWe decided that maybe it was time we got more people involved than just the\n\n8\n\nProceedings of Wednesday, October 13, 1982\n\nMembership Division of the National Headquarters who will give us the numbers as to\n\nhow we stand. So we have a challenge, based on the total that is postmarked by 5-31-83,\n\nbased on this year’s membership, the highest total postmarked membership of 5-31-83.\n\nJune 1 to June 1, ’83 and I said no way, that we couldn’t use that.\n\nThen we decided how we are going to do this. Everyone likes to have a bite to eat, so\n\nwe decided the bet would be a meal. But we decided we didn’t want to spend our time\n\neating alone, and we thought we ought to have some people involved with us.\n\nSo here is what we did: We challenge the Department Commanders to join us in a new\n\nchallenge to their Presidents, notwithstanding the fact that most of them have challenges back home. So we are going to pit the Department Commanders against the\n\nDepartment Presidents, as a part of this membership challenge. We are going to pit\n\npart of the National Officers against their counterparts in the Auxiliary. For example,\n\nBob Spanogle is going to be pitted with the National Secretary. Webber LaGrange, we\n\ngot him involved, and he is going to be pitted against Peggy. I am going to be involved\n\nwith these two gals. I told them I would take on double duty.\n\nThe National Vice Commanders, you don’t know this yet, but you are pitted against\n\nyour counterparts in the Auxiliary.\n\nWe are asking you this morning, both of us, in fact, we have included you, the\n\nNational Executive Committeemen will be pitted against the National Executive Committee ladies of the Auxiliary. That makes it all one big happy family, and we will have\n\na big membership drive, and what will happen at the end of the next National Convention, the winners will pay for the dinner, of course. The losers, the poor ladies will eat\n\nbeans, the men will eat steak. So make your arrangements.\n\nNATIONAL PRESIDENT STOLTE: Are you willing?\n\nNATIONAL COMMANDER KELLER: Are you willing to accept that challenge?\n\n. . . Applause.\n\nNATIONAL PRESIDENT STOLTE: Thank you, Al.\n\nI am pleased to have accompanying me today our National Vice President, Mrs.\n\nThomas Gear. Our National Secretary, Miriam Junge and Peggy Sappenfield, our\n\nNational Treasurer.\n\nThis is quite a membership challenge for us, but you know, Al and I are a team, and\n\nwe want you to be a team in your communities and in your Departments. So I know\n\nthat the Auxiliary is going to beat you. We know that. But it will be fun at the National\n\nConvention to join hands with you and him and sit down and break bread with you.\n\nSo regardless of what we eat, whether we eat beans or whether we eat steak, it just\n\nwill be a great honor for me to be with you. And thank you so much.\n\nMR. E. ROY STONE, JR., South Carolina: Committeemen, will you join me in\n\nsinging, “For She is a Jolly Good Fellow.’’\n\n... At this time, the National Executive Committee joined in singing “For She is a\n\nJolly Good Fellow.”\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nINTRODUCTION OF NATIONAL OFFICERS\n\nNATIONAL COMMANDER KELLER: I would like now to introduce the National\n\nOfficers to you personally.\n\nNational Vice Commander from South Dakota, R. C. Gabrielson. From New Jersey,\n\nMargaret M. Malone. From Indiana, H. Melvin Napier. From Oregon, Jack C. Plato.\n\nFrom Oklahoma, Lee O. Walker. Our National Chaplain, Rev. Father John Kempf of\n\nOhio. National Treasurer, Webber LaGrange of Indiana. National Historian, James W.\n\nConway of Massachusetts. At the back of the room, the National Sergeant-at-Arms,\n\nGary L. Walling of Illinois.\n\n*\n\n#\n\n*\n\nREADING OF MINUTES OF\n\nTWO PRECEDING MEETINGS\n\nNATIONAL COMMANDER KELLER: We are at that section in the agenda which\n\nProceedings of Wednesday, October 13, 1982\n\n9\n\nprovides for the reading of the Minutes of the two previous meetings. They have been\n\nprinted as you know in digest form, and they have been mailed and distributed.\n\n. . . The Post-NEC Minutes should reflect W. Dean Scholl of Ohio present.\n\n. . . Motion was made by E. Roy Stone, South Carolina, duly seconded by Mr.\n\nCorriveau, Canada, and carried unanimously, and the Minutes of the two preceding\n\nmeetings were approved as mailed, without being read with the noted correction.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nNATIONAL COMMANDER KELLER: We are now ready for the Report of the\n\nNational Judge Advocate, the Honorable Bertram G. Davis.\n\nREPORT OF\n\nB. G.

F. Lenker (South Dakota) Chairman\n\nI am combining two reports this morning, the Select Committee on Special Problems\n\nof the Veterans Affairs and Rehabilitation program and then the report of the National\n\nVeterans Affairs and Rehabilitation Commission.\n\nYou have copies of both of them on your desk and with your permission, I will not\n\nread them. But I would like to emphasize some of the important issues.\n\nYour Select Committee did meet on Sunday, and as you know, that consists of three\n\nChairmen of the Veterans Affairs and Rehabilitation, Chairman Frank Kelly of the\n\nEconomic Commission, and Chairman Clarence Bacon, of the Legislation Commission,\n\n18\n\nProceedings of Wednesday, October 13, 1982\n\nplus some consultants, one of our own members, E. Roy Stone, who attends, and we\n\nappreciate his knowledge and wisdom. As far as those problems are concerned, those\n\nChairmen will present their reports to you, so I will not spend my time on the Special\n\nreport.\n\nI will proceed to the Commission report. We met for two days. We considered some 30\n\nresolutions. They will be here for your approval; seven were referred and recorded, and\n\nfour were returned to Departments because they had multiple subjects in the\n\nresolutions; six were held by the Commission for further study, and 10 were rejected.\n\nMembers of this group that attended our Committee meetings, were Chuck Langel,\n\nwho is the Chairman of the Liaison Committee, Emmett Burley of Virginia, George Serr\n\nof Idaho, and Ernesto Golez of the Philippines.\n\nThe first thing I would like to say, we are most happy and we are proud of what\n\nCongress did for the veterans and the Veterans Administration regarding their budget,\n\nwhich is at the present time on the President’s desk and to be signed by October 14. If\n\nhe doesn’t, it automatically goes into law.\n\nTwo bills that we are really concerned with, number one, 77.4% increase in\n\ncompensation for the service-connected. I want to thank the Legislative Commission\n\nChairman, Clarence Bacon, his Director, Phil Riggin for the great cooperation and the\n\ngreat success that they had regarding our bills that were there.\n\nThe second was the VA budget which was in H.R. 696 HUD Independent Agents\n\nAppropriations Bill for the fiscal year starting October 1 of 1982, with a total of $23\n\nbillion $365 million, which is almost over $1 billion more than it was last year.\n\nWe are happy because in that budget is a 7.4 billion for medical care of our VA hospitals which we can live with. In this budget is $152 million for research, which is an\n\nincrease over last year, and one of our vital concerns; $550 million for construction.\n\nSo it is really the only budget that Congress has approved. The rest of the government agencies will be run on continuing resolutions.\n\nI want to make some comments on Agent Orange, which is one of the problems that\n\nyou’re reading and seeing about. It concerns especially the Vietnam era veteran. I want\n\nto compliment one of our own staff, John Sommer, who is probably the most knowledgeable man in Washington, on Agent Orange. He joined our Washington Staff some\n\nthree or four years ago. He is a Vietnam veteran, and he is our representative on several\n\nstudy and support programs.\n\nHis report shows that there are at least four independent studies going on at the\n\npresent time regarding Agent Orange. We have studies from the Disease Control\n\nCenter in Atlanta regarding 7,500 babies to see how many had Vietnam parents, and\n\nthere is an Air Force study of pathology that takes tissues, mostly from tumors from\n\nour VA hospitals, and there is a Ranch Hand study put out by the Air Force, which is a\n\nstudy of 1,286 flying crews that handled that. But the big one that we are concerned\n\nabout was a study supposedly handled by the Veterans Administration. They let out a\n\ncontract, and they are still struggling with the protocol and the delay in the monitoring\n\nand so forth. That is why the Legion has accused the VA of dragging their feet. That is\n\nwhy we passed a strong mandate in Chicago at the Convention asking the Veterans\n\nAdministration to proceed with a separate scientific study from some other group besides the VA, such as the Disease Control Center in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nThat means today that we will be sponsoring a law after the first of the year, hoping\n\nthat it will be passed. Incidentally, in the new budget for ’82-83, there is an item in there\n\nfor $2,536,000 for the study for research of Agent Orange.\n\nI want to touch on the burial allowances that are very important to us. In 1981, Congress took away this benefit for all of those who were not non-service-connected. And in\n\nthe last Comp Bill, we did have a rider, one that restored the benefits to veterans who\n\nare indigent at the time of death. I think all of you saw that program on TV which was a\n\ndisgrace in Los Angeles, where they were dying, they were poor, and nobody seemed to\n\nwant to bury them, and many of them ended up in Potter’s Field. This will take care of\n\nthat.\n\nProceedings of Wednesday, October 13, 1982\n\n19\n\nHowever, we are not satisfied. We want to restore that entitlement, that benefit for\n\nevery honorable service-connected veteran and that mandate will be again in legislation\n\nafter the first of the year and we are asking that burial allowance be increased from\n\n$300.00 to $400.00.\n\nIn conclusion, I want to touch on a problem that is touchy at present that you people\n\ncan help us very much with in your various states.\n\n1 talked to the Department Commanders the other day and asked them to please do\n\nthe same. This is a problem of bed occupancies in the Veterans hospitals in your various\n\nareas. I have a list, and there are over 13 on this list that are under 70% of the daily bed\n\noccupancy of the Veterans Administration hospitals; 80% is the optimum number. 80\n\nto 85% is what we would like to see in these various hospitals. But 13 are below the\n\n70%; one is even down to 57%.\n\nIt is a dangerous situation for us to defend our Veterans hospitals when the bed occupancies are not being used by our veterans. We want to know why. We hear it could be\n\nadmissions, very strongly it has been indicated that it could be admissions from the\n\nvarious hospitals in which they are asking people, “Do you have insurance?” And then\n\nthey say, “If you do, go someplace else.”\n\nWe want names. We want to know the hospitals that are doing this, because this\n\ngives us a right to go to the Chief Medical Director at the Central Office and change\n\nthat situation.\n\nWe know that in private hospitals there are a lot of wards that are vacant at the\n\npresent time, because of the cost. Therefore, the plans are that our hospitals should be\n\nfull, but they are not. I know that several hospitals have problems because of\n\nconstruction and because of the shortage of nursing, but we want to know why the rest\n\nof them aren’t up to where they should be. You just go around in your travels and you\n\nask the Director, “Why is your bed occupancy not up to what it should be?”\n\nWe would like to know in writing.\n\n... The printed report of the Select Committee on Special Problems of the Veterans\n\nAffairs and Rehabilitation Program is as follows:\n\nREPORT OF\n\nTHE SELECT COMMITTEE ON SPECIAL PROBLEMS\n\nOF THE VETERANS AFFAIRS AND REHABILITATION PROGRAM\n\nINDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA\n\nThe Select Committee met at 3:00 p.m., on Sunday, October 10,1982 in The American\n\nLegion National Headquarters, Indianapolis, Indiana. Present were: W. F. Lenker (SD),\n\nChairman; Frank A. Kelly (GA), Vice-Chairman; Clarence M. Bacon (MD), ViceChairman; Harry E. Davison (CO), Chester F. Stellar (OH), Dorothy Andrews (IA),\n\nGeorge S. Wilkerson (IN), Members; E. Roy Stone, Jr. (SC), Dr. Harry S. Sembekos\n\n(DC), and Dyke E. Shannon (FL), Consultants. Present for Staff were: R. E. Lyngh,\n\nDirector, Veterans Affairs and Rehabilitation Commission; E. Philip Riggin, Director,\n\nLegislative Commission, James G. Bourie, Director, Economic Commission; John F.\n\nSommer, Jr., Deputy Director, Veterans Affairs and Rehabilitation Commission; and\n\nThomas M. Schneiders, Assistant Director, Veterans Affairs and Rehabilitation\n\nCommission, Staff Liaison to the Select Committee. Also present as observers were:\n\nPaul Egan, Deputy Director, Legislative Commission; A1 Olszewski, Assistant\n\nDirector, Legislative Commission, and Emil Naschinski, Assistant Director, Economic\n\nCommission. In attendance as observers were: John Cryan (IL); Pat Breen (IL); Jim\n\nPreece (FL); and George Derrick (FL).\n\nDirector R. E. Lyngh briefed the Commission on MEDDIPP (Medical District\n\nInitiated Planning Process). Lyngh outlined the concept and purpose of this program.\n\nHe also informed the Committee that the basic idea of MEDDIPP is to place the\n\nDepartment of Medicine and Surgery of the Veterans Administration in a position to\n\nplan for the five (5) immediate future years. It was pointed out that such plans and\n\n20\n\nProceedings of Wednesday, October 13, 1982\n\nrecommendations were to be presented to VA Central Office by each Medical District\n\nby the 1st week in November 1982. These would be reviewed by DM & S personnel, presented to the Administrator, and then to the Committees of Congress. After discussion\n\nthe Committee suggested that Staff contact the Chief Medical Director requesting The\n\nAmerican Legion be given the opportunity to comment on recommendations received\n\nfrom the Medical Districts. Lyngh indicated that Staff would meet with the Chief Medical Director in the immediate future on this subject.\n\nLyngh concluded his report with a short resume on the recent legislation providing\n\nincreases in veterans disability compensation.\n\nDeputy Director John F. Sommer, Jr., briefed the Committee on the subject of Agent\n\nOrange. He related the number of on-going studies surrounding this subject — these\n\nincluded a mortality study, birth defects study, twins study, Air Force Ranch Hand\n\nstudy, and the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology Tissue study; as well as the study\n\nmandated by PL 96-151. Sommer pointed out that this latter study was running into\n\nsome difficulty, particularly in the protocol design. He further informed the Committee\n\nthat another problem facing these studies was the possible effect of the recent\n\nannouncement of the resignation of the VA Administrator.\n\nLegislative Commission Chairman Clarence M. Bacon presented an overview of the\n\nproblems encountered since May 1982 on various Legislative budget proposals, and the\n\nsuccess on the part of the Legion in having the majority of these problems favorably\n\nresolved — Minimizing budget cuts, funding of new VA programs, and many other\n\ninitiatives covering veterans benefits. Chairman Bacon concluded his report by\n\ncautioning the Committee that a substantial amount of work remains to be done even\n\nwith a lame duck session of the Congress.\n\nDirector Riggin continued the Legislative report, indicating that problems must be\n\nanticipated in securing adequate funding for veterans programs for Fiscal Year 1984.\n\nHe concluded his report by outlining two significant areas of success this past year — 1)\n\npartial restoration of unemployment compensation for certain veterans, and 2) the\n\nrestoration of copyright exemptions.\n\nVice Chairman Kelly called upon Director Bourie to present the Economic report.\n\nBourie outlined the fact that the rate of veteran unemployment, especially for Vietnam\n\nveterans and disabled veterans, remains the Commission’s top concern. He commented\n\non the Department of Labor Budget for Fiscal Year 1983 that provides the office of\n\nAssistant Secretary for Veterans Employment with sufficient funds to sustain a\n\nnumber of full-time positions, and the filling of all vacant field positions. Bourie next reported on the Disabled Veterans Outreach Program stating that it remained in an\n\nunsettled condition as States await final SESA funding levels. He next reported that\n\nthe Office of Personnel Management has assumed responsibility from the Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission for the Disabled Veterans Affirmative Action\n\nProgram effective October 1. Bourie then expressed the pleasure of the Commission\n\nover events at the Small Business Administration regarding its new veteran’s program,\n\nalthough it will take some time before that is fully functional. In conclusion Bourie\n\nreported that it was doubtful that the Small Business Program administered by the VA\n\nwould be funded for Fiscal Year 1983. He pointed out a number of legislative successes\n\nthe past few months relating to employment training matters; a Jobs Partnership Act\n\nreplacing CETA; and the issue of unemployment compensation for discharged\n\nveterans.\n\nHaving completed its agenda, the Select Committee adjourned at 5:15 p.m.\n\n. ..
