        "text": "Issuing Company: Tobacco Products Corp.\n\nCountry of Issue: Canada\n\nYear of Issue: 1922-1924\n\nColor/B&W: B&W\n\nNumber of Cards in Set: 280\n\nCard Size: 1 3/8\" x 2 1/2\"\n\nIssued as insert with what product: Cigarettes\n\nNotes: The American Card Catalog number for this set is C142.\n\nThis set was not issued all at once, it was issued in groups as follows:\n\n1-100: Fronts contain number and name in brown tone, biographical text on back\n\n101-200: Fronts show number, name, and a Starring In line beneath the actors' name in black and white. Backs can found in three different ways, with no mention of Tobacco Products Corp., with Tobacco Products Corp. and Montreal address at bottom, or with Tobacco Products Corp. with Hamilton address at bottom and Series 4 mentioned.\n\n201-220: Fronts show unidentified Mack Sennett girls in black and white and backs have no biographical info.\n\n221-260: Fronts have MBSC Co. in picture frame, fronts have number, name and movie credit in black and white. Backs show Series No. 4 Hamilton Ont. with some other generic text.\n\n261-280: Fronts show unidentified Mack Sennett girls in black and white and backs have no biographical info.\n\nThe first 220 cards appear to have the same numbers as the American Stroller cards. The backs are different, but that is all. Numbers 221-280 have not been seen in the American Stroller cards, but were issued as strip cards in the USA.\n\nThe backs mention an album that can be sent for to hold the cards. The album exists, and is in black with gold lettering. It measures 12 3/4\" across and 8\" tall. The album holds 10 cards per page, in two rows of 5. There are 10 gold rectangles per page, and these are meant to frame the cards when they are pasted into the album. The cards were meant to be pasted in. There are 12 pages to hold 120 cards.\n\nMack Sennett actress identifications are courtesy of Mack Sennett experts Steve Rydzewski and Harry Garvin.\n\nStrollers put out a bunch of newspaper advertising to support their movie star cards and their cigarettes while these cards were being issued. Click the small picture above to view a Canadian newspaper ad for Stroller's cigarettes from January 16, 1923 discussing a limerick contest involving the movie star cards. Another newspaper ad from March 1924 refers to another contest and encourages movie star card trading. Thanks to Bobby Burrell for providing these ads.\n\nDate info: The Canadian newspaper ad indicates these cards were being issued in early 1923. It is likely they were first introduced a little before that, probably in late 1922. They were still being issued in 1924 (possibly the higher numbers by that time), and the large cards were being issued then, too, as indicated by a 1924 newspaper ad.\n\nThanks to Bobby Burrell, Steve Rydzewskik, Harry Garvin, Richard Minns, and Ron Strader for helping with this checklist.\n\n1.
