Lev Kulešov. USSR, 1924) (94 mins) Lev Kuleshov scored one of Soviet cinema’s first successes with this story about a straitlaced American who comes to Soviet Russia and is disabused of his prejudices about the socialist state. Part Soviet propaganda, part action-adventure, part knockabout comedy, the film encompasses multiple genres and is It is notable as the first Soviet film that explicitly challenges American stereotypes about Soviet Russia. The cast is a veritable who’s who of future Soviet cinematic heavyweights including Boris Barnett, Vsevolod Pudovkin and Aleksandra Khokhlova who would all go on to exalted careers.

It, 1915) (62 mins) Legendary Italian diva Lyda Borelli plays a poor prostitute who gives up her illegitimate child for adoption. Eventually she decides to escape her life and is helped by a rich banker (Augustus Poggioli), who adopts her. Lydia is like a sister to the banker’s real daughter, Fulvia. Years later, plagued by guilt over her earlier decision, Lydia searches for her long lost son. But will reconciliation bring happiness? Flower of Evil was Borelli”s third film with director Carmine Gallone and while she may not quite as yet have reached peak diva status, hers is a performance already characterised by grand gestures, painful expressions and languid gazes. Presented as part of the 2021 Bonn International Silent Film Festival. Women Who Shouldn’t Get Married is accompanied by Sabine Zimmer (piano) and this marvelous Italian diva film is accompanied by cellists Paul Rittel and Tobias Stutz aka Cellophon.\n\n20 August\n\nRefuge (Zuflucht ) Dir. Carl Froelich. Ger, 1928) ( 130 mins) Forced to flee Germany after the 1918/19 revolution, Martin (Francis Lederer) spends nine years exiled in the Soviet Union before returning to Berlin, hungry and sick. Befriended by a poor, young, working class girl (Henny Porten), she takes him home but scandal is never far behind and, ultimately, tragedy looms. Henny Porten once again portrays a woman placidly resigned to self sacrifice and suffering, although at the age of 40 she was considerably too old for the role. However, as producer as well as star she can also claim credit for discovering Francis Lederer, who would go on to star alongside Louise Brooks in Pandora’s Box (1929) and with Brigitte Helm in The Wonderful Lies of Nina Petrovna (1929).

Cz, 1923) (61 mins) Made during the time of Czech cinema’s deepening crisis, the country’s film industry had big expectations from this American-style comedy, inspired by the slapstick comedies of the Keystone Cops. It did indeed prove an instant box office hit. Depicting a wicked fantasy of a luxurious middle-class lifestyle, The Kidnapping has an excellent cast including Karel Lamac and Anny Ondra (star of Hitchcock’s Blackmail [1929] and The Manxman [1929]), and also features a unique cameo appearance by the fêted Parisian couturier Paul Poiret. Director Karel Anton is probably best remembered for his acclaimed silent melodrama Tonka of the Gallows (1930). Although female lead Anny Ondra is better known for her Hitchcock thriller roles she was also an adept comedienne, particularly in The Lovers of an Old Criminal (1927).

Written and directed by film critic, scriptwriter and film editor Lucie Deraine, it was her only 35mm film. While it failed to attract significant critical acclaim, the film is a gentle if somewhat conventional travelogue of the French capital.

Aus, 1926) (46 mins) A kind of Easy Rider from the silent film era, the story of a group of motorcyclists who successfully ride their machines over the more than 3,232m high Tofana in the Dolomites.

Filled with Lloyd’s trademark rapid-fire visual humour and elaborate set-ups, it’s a fine example of his innovative approach to comedy. Find out more at allmovie.com.

Den, 1919) ( mins) C T Dreyer made his directorial debut with this astonishingly mature and confidently realised social drama. When a presiding judge (“president”) in a small town is sentencing a young woman, Victorine, who has killed her own child born in secret, he realises the young woman is in fact his own daughter. The realisation brings back memories of his own past, of a romance he was forced by social pressure to abandon, which in turn prompts the judge to take drastic action. The film’s structural complexity, with multiple flashbacks, slowly draws out the psychological complexity of the lead character in a way almost unheard of in films of this era.

Karin Swanström. Swe, 1926) (120 mins) Katja is about to graduate, but she has nothing to wear for the graduation ball. Her father, the eccentric inventor Carl Axel Kock does not spend much of his income on Katja while her brother Curry gets everything he wants. So on the day of the ball, Katja simply dresses up in her brother’s brand new evening attire and attends the dance, smokes cigars, drinks brandy–and causes a scandal. Director Karin Swanström plays the somewhat unflattering role of an ageing and overweight matriarchal widow (sporting double chin, flaring nostrils and piercing stare) in this amusing take on the conflict between diversity and conformity, tradition and change, with a surprisingly (for its time) feminist perspective.

Ger, 1924) (84mins) A wax museum owner employs a poet (William Dieterle) to create stories for his pieces. The poet dutifully pens disturbing tales, envisioning himself as a significant character in each story — a baker sentenced to death by the Caliph of Baghdad (Emil Jannings), a Russian prince contending with the deadly paranoia of Ivan the Terrible (Conrad Veidt) and a man who is pursued through the haunting streets of London by Jack the Ripper (Werner Krauss). As his stories play out on screen, the characters are brought vividly to life in this finest of expressionist fantasias. While actor Conrad Veidt will forever hold a place in popular culture following his performance in The Man Who Laughs (1928) he was a stalwart of Weimar era cinema, appearing as the murderous somnambulist in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, the fantastic Unheimliche Geschichten (Richard Oswald, 1919) and The Hands of Orlac (Robert Wiene, 1924) and he provides a similarly gripping performance here.

Charlie Chaplin, US, 1936) set during the great depression, Modern Times centres on a luckless factory worker (played by Chaplin with his last outing as the ‘little tramp’ character) who finds himself so unnerved by trying to cope with the modern equipment he must operate that he suffers a breakdown. After being institutionalized, he is freed, only to be mistaken for a communist agitator. He is arrested but released after preventing a jailbreak. He subsequently falls in love with a young girl (Paulette Goddard) whom he met when she was running from the police after stealing a loaf of bread. The factory worker and the girl have many adventures together as they evade the police and struggle for a better life. Eventually they escape for the open road. Chaplin had not been seen on a theatre screen for five years when Modern Times premiered to great acclaim in 1936. Still stubbornly resisting work in “talkies,” he stood alone in his insistence upon preserving the silent film. As he did with City Lights (1931), Chaplin conceded to recording a music and sound effects track, but there would be no dialogue heard on-screen. Find out more at wikipedia.org. With recorded score. Film screens at 20;00 UK time. Details Here\n\nThe Cinema Arts Centre in Huntington NY presents Her Night of Romance (Dir.

An impoverished British Lord (Paul Menford) impersonates a doctor to woo the heiress. The Lord is in love but his business associate (Joe Diamond) is only interested in the money.

Boris Orlicky, Cz, 1921) Officer Karel Vyšín has fallen in love with Ruth, the daughter of a Jewish inn-keeper. Karel’s friend Xavier also loves Ruth but he does not want to stand in Karel’s way. When Ruth becomes pregnant, her father, in his fury, curses her and drives her out of the house. Ruth and her child return to her father when a pogrom is waged against the Jews in the village. The inn- keeper is killed and Ruth is crucified. Her son Jan, however, is saved by Xavier. But Jan’s life will take many turns until a final revelation takes place. A naturalistic 1921 adaptation of a Jakub Arbes novel that deals with the socio-political climate of the mid19th century Czech lands, antisemitism, war and love. Ukřižovaná belongs to the rather forgotten part of the Czech cinema history in that it does not shy away from depicting horrors of 19th century central European antisemitism in a vivid and graphic manner. Ukřižovaná might be one of the most suggestive films of its time with its haunting colours, intricate plot and an atmosphere that is not easy to come by. With live musical accompaniment from Ondřej Dizzcock (Ondřej Bělíček). The screening will be followed by a panel discussion on acting styles in early cinema. Film screens at 17.00 CET (18.00 UK time) Further details here.\n\nThursday 17 June\n\nNárodní filmový archiv, Prague present Gypsies (aka Cikani) (Dir. Karl Anton, Cz, 1921) A film adaptation of the eponymous novel by Karel Hynek Mácha – author of the celebrated epic poem May – about a Venetian gondolier whose beloved is enticed away by a wealthy foreigner.This tale of a Venetian gondolier whose desire for revenge following a thwarted love affair leads him eventually to Bohemia. The intricate plot also deals with destinies of various other characters, who finally come together in a dramatic encounter at one time and in one place. In his role as screenwriter and director, Anton produced a highly accomplished version of Mácha’s work. He respected the original but was also able, along with the cinematographer Karel Kopřiva, to capitalise on the possibilities that the film medium offered. For the Venice prologue, the filmmakers exploited the photogenic qualities of the city – the narrow streets, the lagoons, gondolas and the sea – beforemoving the action to the enigmatic Czech landscape around the castle of Kokořín.

Film screens at 17.00 CET (18.00 UK time) Further details here.\n\nThursday 10 June\n\nNárodní filmový archiv, Prague present The Lovers of an Old Criminal (aka An Old Gangster’s Molls aka Milenky starého kriminálníka) (Dir. Svatopluk Innemann, Cz, 1927) Factory owner Pardon meets and falls for Olga. But Olga’s mother has better things planned for her daughter and spirits her away. Industrialist’s daughter Fifi is set on marrying Pardon but in order to search for Olga he swaps places with his uncle, Ponděliček, who’s age and infirmity both uncle and nephew hope will put Fifi off. But Fifi is not a girl easily dissuaded, even when Ponděliček claims to be Kanibal, the murderous criminal. And when the real Kanibal shows up the chaos really starts. No bare bones synopsis could remotely capture the frenetic pace of this wonderfully funny film. This is a picture which covers virtually every sub-category of the comedy genre. The early scenes of Fifi, luxuriating amongst her many handmaidens while puffing on a Churchillian sized cigar, have the sophistication of Lubitsch and yet the final hectic chase sequence is pure Keystone. And there is everything in between! This knockabout comedy centres around star Vlasta Burian as Pondelícek. Unknown in the West, Burian was already a national treasure in 1920s Czechoslovakia, with wonderful comic timing and that ability of the greatest comedians to generate a laugh from just the slightest look or gesture. But the eye-popping star has to be Fifi herself, wearing outfits that would have raised eyebrows in swinging sixties London let alone Prague of the 1920s She is played wonderfully by Anny Ondráková, who would shorten her surname simply to Ondra a year later when her burgeoning career took her to Germany. This really is a film not to be missed. Find out more at silentfilmcalendar.org. With live musical accompaniment from Vojtěch Procházka. Film screens at 17.00 CET (18.00 UK time) Further details here.\n\nTuesday 8 June\n\nThe Sands Films Cinema Clubpresent House on Trubnaya (Dir. Boris Barnett, 1928) The House on Trubnaya is a masterpiece of Soviet silent cinema. It is a delightful comedy of manners that satirises contemporary life in Moscow during the height of the New Economic Policy (NEP, 1921-28). The film celebrates the changing character of Moscow while offering a sharp social commentary on the contradictions of the shifting Soviet state. This is the story of a city and the trials and tribulations of a young peasant girl, Parasha (Vera Maretskaya), who comes to Moscow with her pet duck in search of her uncle but discovers the injustices of the petite-bourgeoisie . When Mr. Golikov (Vladimir Fogel), owner of a hairdressing salon, looks for a housekeeper who is modest, hard-working and non-union, Parasha looks to be a suitable candidate but occupants of the house on Trubnaya are shocked when Parasha demonstrates her genuine revolutionary spirit and affirms her proletarian rights by joining the domestic workers union! Another classic Russian comedy from Boris Barnett, a real delight. Find out more at silentfilm.org With recorded soundtrack. Screens at 8.00pm.

And how are new historical insights best distributed, accessed, and debated in the digital era? Speakers at this two-day symposium will include Barry Anthony, Tim Boon, Stephen Bottomore, Simon Brown, Zoë Viney Burgess, Jon Burrows, Ian Christie, Malcolm Cook, Bryony Dixon, Peter Domankiewicz, Frank Gray, Luke McKernan, Simon Popple, Laraine Porter, Deac Rossell, Vanessa Toulmin.

Fred Newmeyer, US, 1924) In what is really three shorts rolled up in to one feature length film, Harold Lloyd starts out as best man running to his friend’s wedding and promising that he will never give in to ‘a pair of soft-boiled eyes’. But when he quite literally runs into Jobyna Ralston he is married faster than you can read the next inter-title. Then, as family man Harold, he has an adventure taking home a turkey by public transport, taking the family out in their new car and finally accidentally chloroformings his mother-in-law and being convinced that he has killed her. The film has that ‘stitched-together’ feel but is not short on gags and was a considerable popular success on its first release. Find out more at wikipedia.org. With live piano accompaniment.

Karel Lamac, Cz, 1929). Actor Ivan Kristen and his wife Soňia leave the provincial theatre to go to work in the city. Soňia has Ivan to thank for her artistic career but it is Soňia who is given a leading role while Ivan is left without a job. Soňia becomes a star and is courted by the leading man Richard Kent. No one appreciates Ivan’s talent so he decides to leave the theatre, taking Soňia with him. Kent, however, pulls strings in order to get a big role for Ivan, ensuring that Ivan remains in town and allowing Kent to further court Sonia. But Ivan’s growing suspicions over Kent’s attention towards Sonia results in growing jealousy and leads, eventually, to tragedy. By the late 1920s, the standing of the Czech film industry was such that it could attract high quality international cast and crew and this is a particularly fine example. Because it was a silent film, there was no problem with the international cast, with Czech, Italian, German and French stars appearing in the four main roles. The direction by Lamac is also outstanding. Find out more at silentfilmcalendar.org. With live musical accompaniment from Ožvold & Ožvold & Kratochvíl. The screening will be followed by a panel discussion on the musical accompaniment to silent films. Film screens at 17.00 CET (18.00 UK time) Further details here.\n\nTuesday 18 May\n\nThe Cinema Arts Centre in Huntington NY presents Mantrap (Dir. Victor Fleming, US, 1926). Ralph Prescott, a New York divorce lawyer and his buddy, E. Wesson Woodbury, decide to get away from it all on a camping trip near the town of Mantrap, Canada. However, the city slickers are a bit out of their depth in the North woods. After the two get into a tussle, Joe Easter, the local trading post owner, takes Prescott to Mantrap, where Prescott meets Joe’s new flirtatious wife, Alverna (Clara Bow). And then the sparks really begin to fly… Paramount Pictures paid $50,000 for Sinclair Lewis’ long and justifiably forgotten novel, “Mantrap,” but happily, the female screenwriters Ethel Doherty and Adelaide Heilbron turned Lewis’ misogynistic tirade into a funny comedy romp that is light as a feather. Credit must also go to Clara Bow who represents an erotic whirlwind in an otherwise woman-less Western wilderness; an outrageous, good-time girl who leads at least two men by the nose, but nevertheless eventually honors her commitment–at least until the next interesting prospect comes along. We may have to wait until 10 minutes in to the film for Clara Bow’s first appearance, but after that she never lets go. It’s hard to disagree with the note she much later wrote to her sons on a package of production stills: “From Mantrap—the best silent picture I ever made.” Although not yet 21, she’d already been in more than 30 films but this was her breakthrough movie.

(aka Buď připraven!) (Dir. Svatopluk Innemann, Cz, 1923) Buď připraven! portrays the early Czech boy scout movement taking the audience to astonishing locations, such as Orlík castle and St John’s Rapids, the latter of which no longer exists. The neglected Buď připraven! is based on a screenplay by the theatre personality and scoutmaster František V. Kučera, who also appeared in one of the roles. The film shows boy scouts at a summer camp in the vicinity of Orlík castle engaged in various exercises in proficiency, including lifesaving skills. The casting included boys of the Prague scout troops and the staff of the Schwarzenberg estate. The film provides rare documentation not only of the period scout movement but also of 1923 Prague and the St John’s Rapids, now flooded by the Štěchovice Reservoir.

Losing her job at the beauty parlor, Dorothy cons her way into a position at a newspaper where she is assigned to interview an eccentric collector (Tully Marshall).

Plus, Sailor Beware (Dir. William Watson, US, 1927) in which wimpy sailor boy Billy Epsom has just arrived from New Guinea with a guinea pig in a box for his sweetheart.

Yasujiro Ozu, Jap, 1935) The final still-extant silent film directed by Yasujiro Ozu is an exquisitely tender portrait of everyday survival in 1930s Japan. Anticipating the neo-realist poetry of The Bicycle Thieves (1948), An In In Tokyo follows unemployed ne’er-do-well Kihachi (Takeshi Sakamoto) and his young sons as they eke out an existence on the city’s margins, catching stray dogs for reward money and eventually becoming involved with a similarly impoverished woman and her daughter. With its simple yet elegant compositions and striking use of Tokyo’s industrial landscapes, this bittersweet slice-of-life tale represents a key work in the evolution of Ozu’s artistry.

King Baggot, U, 1925) Silent film western legend William S. Hart stars in this classic tale of settlers in the Oklahoma territory. Directed by King Baggot, but co-directed by Hart, Tumbleweeds follows a cowboy in 1890s Kansas, Don Carver (Hart), a drifter or “tumbleweed” by nature who meets and falls in love with Molly Lassiter (Barbara Bedford) after accidentally lassoing her. Hoping to settle down with his love, Carver decides to get in on the Cherokee Strip land rush, but after being falsely arrested by the U.S. Cavalry, Carver must find a way to break out of the stockade if he is to get back into the race. Tumbleweeds was cowboy legend William S. Hart’s final starring role. Hart, who was known for his brand of gritty and rugged Westerns set the standard for all Western stars who followed. Modern reviews of Tumbleweeds have lauded it as the high point of Hart’s career. Gary Johnson in Images Journal said that although Tumbleweeds was only a mild box-office success, it is arguably Hart’s finest film. “The movie’s most impressive sequence remains the land rush“, wrote Johnson. “All manners of vehicles — covered wagons, surreys, stagecoaches, even a large-wheeled bicycle — bounce over the prairie in the mad rush to claim land. Other films would attempt to recreate the Oklahoma land rush — such as Cimarron, which won the Best Picture Academy Award in 1931 — but Tumbleweeds remains the best example.” Find out more at wikipedia.org.

These three extraordinary musicians (and friends) will talk about composing for film—touching on the similarities and differences for silent cinema. Paul D. Miller (DJ Spooky) is an artist and composer with an affinity for silent film. His live remix of D.W. Griffith’s The Birth of a Nation—Rebirth of a Nation—premiered in 2004 and Miller went on to score Dovzhenko’s Earth and Robert Wiene’s The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, among others. He executive-produced the Pioneers of African-American Cinema box set, which features his scores for two Oscar Micheaux films. Miller performed at SFSFF 2017 with his score for Micheaux’s Body and Soul and there are plans afoot to bring Miller to San Francisco to perform at SFSFF’s next in-person event. Carter Burwell is known to anyone who’s seen a film by the Coen Brothers—his ineffable touch is on everything from Blood Simple to The Big Lebowski to The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, not to mention his scores for films by Todd Haynes and Spike Jonze! Graham Reynolds composed the elegant music for Richard Linklater’s A Scanner Darkly, Before Midnight, and Where’d You Go, Bernadette, among his many other film scores. Reynolds got his film-composing start by scoring silent films! Event takes place at 12.00 noon PDT (should be 20.00 UK time but double check due to weekend clock changes!)

Between the years 1896 and 1901 an obscure Parisian bimbelotier (a maker of trinkets and playthings) named Léon Beaulieu produced a series of what we today call flip books. Some of these source films are quite well known, such as Edison’s “The May Irwin Kiss” but thanks to the exhaustive research carried out by Thierry Lecointe and Pascal Fouché we have confidently identified the image sources for many of the books to be lost early films of cinema magician Georges Méliès, as well as Gaumont, Skladanowsky, and Pathé. Many of these flip books reveal glimpses of films that have been lost for over a century and that, in many cases, were never known at all. In 2017 the San Francisco Silent Film Festival undertook on the task of animating the entire Beaulieu corpus of twenty-seven unique books. The goal was to reverse the bimbelotier’s film-to-paper transformation and reconstitute the fragments as motion pictures. Photographer Onno Petersen designed a special photographic mount that allowed the pages to be photographed without damaging the fragile bindings while at the same time producing consistently-dimensioned images free of distortion. Each page was carefully photographed, a total of 2,642 images. Enlisting techniques borrowed from the realm of digital film restoration, digital stabilization tools were used to align the images, analyze and determine the appropriate frame rate, and to ultimately render properly timed animations of each individual book. In this special Amazing Tales Online presentation hosted by Pamela Hutchinson, join Thierry Lecointe and Robert Byrne, as they reveal the secrets of Léon Beaulieu’s magical bimblots. With musical accompaniment by Stephen Horne.

The tourist short provided an excellent opportunity for aspiring directors to learn the “craft”, often with the support of local subsidies. The song of the carillons and rivers is a kind of hybrid film, in which a simple comic and romantic intrigue takes the viewer through as many picturesque towns and villages as possible. Ostend, Bruges, Ypres, Bergen … each place visited leads to about half a dozen images of monuments, sites or special features, each time described with passages from a notebook. We show the shortened version from which the fictional aspect of the story was omitted: La Belgique et le Grand Duché du Luxembourg. Event screens on Facebook at 3.00pm (4.00pm UK time) with live music accompaniment. Details via @Cinematekbe or here\n\nNárodní filmový archiv, Prague present White Paradise (aka Bílý ráj) (Dir. Karel Lamac, Cz, 1924) Set in a remote region “where people were born with solitude in their hearts”, orphan Nina (Anny Ondra) serves customers in a coaching inn, quarreling with its owner, while Ivan (Karel Lamač), who has been jailed for embezzlement, escapes from prison to bring medicine to his dying mother. Hiding from the pursuing police in the inn’s cellar, Ivan meets Nina who falls for his good heart and piercing eyes and decides to help him. With its classic story and advanced technical quality, and the involvement of Der Starke Vierer (The Strong Four) – one of the most distinctive creative teams to come out of early Czechoslovak cinema: director and actor Karel Lamač, camera–man Otto Heller, actress Anny Ondra and screenwriter Václav Wasserman – contributed to the domestic and international success of this low-budget film and established Lamač and Ondra as major forces of Czechoslovak cinema.

With music by multi-instrumentalist Tomáš Vtípil followed by panel discussion on ‘Classics Today‘ , which provides a framework for this entire Czech retrospective. What the term ‘classic’ means in architecture, music, literature and why using this term, will be some of the questions discussed by guests from various cultural fields and moderated by the General Director of the Czech National Film Archive, Mihal Bregant. Film screens at 17.00 CET (18.00 UK time) Further details here\n\nTuesday 6 April\n\nSands Films Cinema Club present Bed And Sofa (Dir. Abram Room, USSR, 1927) Volodya, a printer, lands a job in Moscow and is looking for a place to stay. Unable to find a room in a hotel, he meets up with construction worker Kolya, his Civil War comrade from years before. Even though Kolya lives in a small one-room apartment, he offers Volodya the sofa, the bed being occupied by Kolya himself and his wife Liudmila. But put-upon Liudmila is soon attracted to the handsome Volodya and when Kolya returns from a work trip he now finds himself on the sofa and Volodya in the bed with Liudmila. But rather than simply a romantic farce Bed And Sofa is far more, a commentary on the continued enforced domesticity of women in Soviet society, on overcrowded living conditions and, ultimately, on a woman’s right to choose. Needless to say, the film went down badly with the Soviet authorities while its somewhat racy subject matter ran into similar problems with censors in the West. However, Bed And Sofa is now regarded as a classic of silent Soviet cinema. Find out more at www.brentonfilm.com. With a live introduction and recorded soundtrack.

F Richard Jones, US, 1923) Hometown girl Sue Graham (Mabel Normand) wins a movie contest and goes to Hollywood when her parents forbid her to marry Dave Giddings (Ralph Graves), her father’s garage mechanic. Arriving in Hollywood, Sue finds that there is no work except in the wardrobe department. She falls into the clutches of an oil swindler named Hackett (Ramsey Wallace). When Sue’s parents lose their fortune to Hackett, Sue determines to recover the cash and get her man.

John Ford, US, 1924) This epic silent western concerns the building of the first transcontinental railroad and tells a story of double dealing among surveyors and contractors, attacks by the Cheyenne Indians, immigrants hoping for a better life, saloon girls deviously seducing railroad officials, sons struggling to realise the forgotten dreams of their now-dead fathers, and desperate last minute rides by the pony express. It culminates with the celebrated scene of the joining of the rails at Promontory Point, Utah. Director John Ford had already helmed nearly fifty B-movies during his movie-making apprenticeship but this is the one which catapulted him into the front ranks of American filmmakers. Made as Fox Studio’s response to Paramount’s The Covered Wagon released the previous year, The Iron Horse was one of the great blockbusters of Hollywood’s silent era, with over 6000 extras, construction of two whole towns; 2000 rail layers; a cavalry regiment; 800 Indians; 1300 buffalo; 2000 horses; 10,000 cattle.

Ritchie, like Chaplin, travelled with the Karno troupes to the USA. He was billed alongside Chaplin as one of ‘the greatest comedians of the day’ and was among a small number of stars whose names were guaranteed to boost box office receipts in cinemas UK-wide. However, today few people even in Scotland have heard of him, or seen the many side-splitting, slapstick moments he made for film in Hollywood. This talk and tour features rare clips courtesy of the Library of Congress, Undercrank Productions, and the EYE Filmmuseum, and other recently discovered moments from Ritchie’s career. Presented by John Bengston, author, film historian and member of the Board of Directors of the San Francisco Silent Film Festival. Screens at 12.00 UK time.

Vsevolod Pudovkin and Nikolai Shpikovsky, USSR,1925) Ninety-five years before the Netflix series The Queen’s Gambit gripped our imaginations Soviet citizens were transfixed by the International Chess Tournament being held at Moscow’s Hotel Metropol in November 1925.

Sergei Komarov, USSR, 1927) During their travels in the Soviet Union in 1926, Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford were recorded by the director Sergei Komarov and his crew. The couple knowingly participated in the filming as a gesture of support for the Russian film industry. At Mezhrapom Film Studios, Pickford embraced and planted a kiss on actor Igor Ilyinski and Komarov decided to build a full-length feature around this shot. The result was A Kiss From Mary Pickford, the story of Goga, a man who has no luck with women, not least his girlfriend Dusya who tells him they are through unless he becomes a celebrity. But when a chance kiss from Mary Pickford suddenly brings him star status, things do not run as smoothly as Goga expects. Find out more at silentfilm.org.

William Beaudine, Tom McNamara (uncredited), US, 1926) HippFest is proud to present the world premiere of a brand new restoration of Mary Pickford’s masterpiece Sparrows with a new score specially commissioned by the Mary Pickford Foundation. Pickford, “America’s sweetheart”, and the unrivaled Queen of Hollywood – plays ‘mamma Molly’ the eldest of a lovable clutch of raggedy orphans, starved and brutalised by the evil Mr Grimes who exploits the luckless children, forcing them to work on his dismal swamp. This Dickensian scenario is further emphasised by sinister lighting and a dark Gothic production design – rendering a genuinely suspenseful and affecting drama in which Molly strives first to protect the children and then lead them on a daring escape across quicksand and alligator-infested swamps. Find out more at moviessilently.com. Introduced by Cari Beauchamp, writer, film historian, flm-maker and Resident Scholar at the Mary Pickford Foundation. Musical accompaniment composed by Taylor and Cameron Graves and performed by Taylor Graves (piano, violin, cello, contra bass, flute, trumpet, percussion, guitar, harp and brass); Cameron Graves (piano, violin, cello and contra bass); Rachel Grace (violin); Artymom Manukyan (cello); Sean Sonderegger (clarinet, bass clarinet, flute and contra clarinet).

Augusto Genina, Fr, 1930) Iconic star of the silent era – Louise Brooks – lights up the role of Lucienne, a spirited, carefree, working woman who enters a beauty contest and is introduced to the alluring world of fame and the freedom it affords. Chafing under the disapproval of her idealistic but controlling boyfriend she is torn between the tantalising glimpse of glamour and a life of domesticity. Based on a story by René Clair and G.W. Pabst the film was released as a talkie but this HippFest presentation is of the glorious, beautifully restored silent version, which eschews some crude pasted-on sound effects and awkwardly post-synched dialogue scenes, and lets the stunning cinematography and Brooks’ electric performance shine for themselves. This is a particularly welcome opportunity to watch this rarely screened classic with a mesmeric performance by Brooks. Find out more at sensesofcinema.com.

They meet again on the train taking him and his wife on their honeymoon. Overwhelmed by Stascha’s sexuality, and ignoring his distraught new wife, Leblanc agrees to help her escape from the domineering Karoff, setting in motion a chain of obsessive, destructive events. Long before von Sternberg brought us Dietrich as Lola Lola in The Blue Angel, the actress had already created her femme fatale persona with this, her first starring role. Although made on something of a shoestring budget and wholly studio shot, the film benefits from excellent direction from Bernhardt, Dietrich smoulders superbly and the rest of the cast are excellent. Unfortunately the film was released just as audiences were clamouring for sound films and as a result it was not particularly successful. This rarely screened film marked an important milestone in Dietrich’s career development. Find out more at silentfilm.org . Introduced by writer, critic and academic Hannah McGill.

Anthony Asquith, GB, 1928) In 1920s London, during a normal hectic day on the Underground, mild mannered Northern Line porter Bill (Brian Aherne) falls for shop worker Nell (Elissa Landi). But their relationship is threatened by power station worker Burt (Cyril McLaglan) who also has eyes for Nell. Consumed by jealousy, Burt plots to discredit Bill with a plan that results in a daring chase through London’s underground and across rooftops of the city. Although Underground was only Asquith‘s second film he handles the melodramatic story with confidence and great sophistication. Underground is a rare study of 1920s working-class London, and offers a fascinating and historically interesting glimpse of its public transport system. Find out more at screenonline.org.uk.

Clarence Brown, US, 1925) Based on the novel Dubrovsky by Alexander Pushkin, Rudolph Valentino stars as the title character, a young Russian Cossack officer who rejects the Czarina’s (Louise Dresser) amorous attention and is promptly branded a deserter in this silent tale of love and revenge. On the eve of his dismissal he learns of his father’s ruin–his father had sent a letter pleading for the Czarina’s aid against Kyrilla (James Marcus), a gluttonous and treacherous neighbor who has stolen the family’s estate. Sentenced to death with a reward on his head for shunning the lusty Czarina, Vladimir escapes into the countryside and becomes the Black Eagle, a dashing masked vigilante who seeks to avenge the death of his father. But things get complicated when he falls in love with Mascha Troekouroff (Vilma Banky), Kyrilla’s daughter. Escaping for once his ‘Latin Lover’ persona, Valentino delivers a charismatic and seductive performance in this full-scale romantic adventure that shines with early Hollywood’s technical advancements and stylish production values.

Over the last twelve months, the Covid-19 pandemic has had a devastating effect on the country’s entertainment sector, with cinemas across the country closed and film releases withdrawn… but what lessons can we draw from the responses of the cinema industry to the pandemic over a hundred years ago? This illuminating talk explores the close parallels with the Scottish film exhibitor experience during the 1918 – 19 flu pandemic. The so-called ‘Spanish flu’ struck a cinema industry, which was still young and which had already endured four years of war. These challenging years were compounded by mounting criticism for the cinema’s alleged moral corruption of young audiences. In examining the steps taken at the time to check the spread of infection we learn about attitudes of the day towards cinema, the impact of the pandemic on the industry at a key stage in its development, and that lockdown and social distancing are nothing new. Presented by Dr Trevor Griffiths, University of Edinburgh. Screening at 14.00 UK time.

Schoedsack – best known as the co-producer/directors of King Kong (1933) – tell the jaw-dropping story of a tribe of nomads in Iran known as the Bakhtiari and their epic trek with half-a-million animals across impossible terrain to reach summer pasture. A spectacular ethnographic record, this film was intended for the lecture circuit but was snapped up by Paramount for theatrical distribution on the strength of its powerful dramatic punch. It’s easy to see how the character of Denham in King Kong was modeled after the adventurer Cooper, whose daredevil real-life exploits were the stuff of Hollywood adventure films. Watch it for the near-mythic odyssey of the journey, the staggering beauty of the scenery, and the endearing moments of intimacy and warmth for the film’s subjects. Find out more at www.loc.gov.

The dozen two-reel comedies Charlie Chaplin made during his 1916–1917 tenure with the Mutual Film Corporation, after signing a then unprecedented contract for $670,000 and being given complete creative control as writer, director, producer and star, are considered to be among the finest of the form ­— for some, Chaplin’s artistic peak — before business imperatives demanded that Chaplin and other silent comedy stars redirect their focus to creating feature-length films. In addition to Chaplin’s film artistry, part of these films’ appeal comes thanks to his wonderful supporting cast, who reappear in various roles throughout the series, including leading lady Edna Purviance, portly Henry Bergman, fearsome heavy Eric Campbell and youthful Albert Austin. Films featured include; The Pawnshop (1916) in which Chaplin plays a particularly inept shop assistant in one of his most celebrated and surreal shorts — highlights include the famous “sick” alarm clock gag. The Cure (1916) with Chaplin a society drunk who checks into a health spa to dry out, but smuggles a trunkful of booze in with him. A revolving door provides ample opportunity for gags, with Chaplin’s attempts to escape Henry Bergman’s vigorous massage a comic highlight; and, The Adventurer (1917) when, after a daring escape from prison, the Little Tramp saves Edna Purviance and her mother from drowning, and is taken into their home. But Edna’s jealous suitor Eric Campbell does his darnedest to have him removed. With live musical accompaniment by Ben Model. Event screens at 8.00ET (01.00am 12 March UK time).

In an impressively high tech format they present silent films introduced by Michelle Facey (@best2vilmabanky). Tonight, in partnership with the British Film Institute, KBTV presents a special selection of films from London-born music hall and silent film comedian Fred Evans (1889-1951) showcasing his celebrated comedy character, the prodigious ‘Pimple’, whose popular antics, with over 200 films to his name, proved to be a precursor of many British comedies to come. Hailing from a theatrical family and born in the same year as Charlie Chaplin, they were childhood friends and between them they dominated the comedy box office takings of the ‘teens in the UK. BFI silent film curator, Bryony Dixon, takes us through Fred’s career, via his characters Charley Smiler and Pimple, with reference also to his talented family and his peer, Charlie Chaplin. Films include; Charley Smiler Joins the Boy Scouts (1911) Fred Evans appears here in his earlier comedy film incarnation; Making A Living (1914) the first film produced featuring Charlie Chaplin; The Adventures of Pimple: The Battle of Waterloo (1913) a parody of the then recently released British and Colonial Films’ epic depiction of the famed battle; Pimple Has One (1915) in which a servant fetching wine gets drunk and has trouble with the police; Will Evans the Musical Eccentric (1899) in which Fred Evans’ Uncle Will demonstrates some of his impressive stage skills; Pimple’s Part (1916) Pimple tries to be an actor; Pimple’s Pink Forms (1916) Pimple is rejected by the army, so he takes a job delivering official forms – film fragment; and, Pimple In The Whip (1917) A lord foils a plot to kill his favourite horse and rides it to win.

The talk will introduce viewers to the cinema as it developed in Britain during Lutyens’s lifetime, showcasing some well-known films as well as some recent rediscoveries from this period, and place them in the context of the culture of film-making and film-going in the early twentieth century. The talk will offer some illustrations of the ways in which cinema can be understood as a key resource for thinking about the visual culture of the Edwardian period, and particularly for thinking about the wider world of interior design, garden design and architecture in which Lutyens moved. 6.00pm UK time.

Vsevolod Pudovkin, USSR, 1926) Legendary film critic and writer Pauline Kael stated that “Pudovkin’s masterpiece, based on Maxim Gorky’s novel and frequently selected by critics as one of the greatest films of all time, gives an epic sense of the 1905 revolution through the emotions of the participants, and sweeps one along by its fervor and a brilliant and varied use of the medium.” Telling the story of a woman’s struggle against Tsarist rule, Vera Baranovskaya plays the mother who is tricked by the police into betraying her son, whilst Pudovkin himself plays the officer who interrogates her.

Richard Oswald, Ger, 1929) Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes stories were the basis for scores of silent films; this is the very last of them, made in Germany in the dying days of the silent era.

Seiter, US, 1923) Douglas MacLean was a popular leading man in comedy features all through the 1920s. So successful were his films that he became his own producer.

Frank Tuttle, US,1926) This is surely one of Bow’s finest comic performances. A silent-film adaptation of a Broadway musical-comedy seems an unlikely winning formula, but with the dual appeal of male lead Eddie Cantor, with his hapless comic charm, and Clara Bow’s “captivating, heart-snatching heroine” (New York Times), Kid Boots (1926) became a well-deserved smash hit for Paramount and further consolidated Clara as box office gold.

Stand-up comedian Lucy Porter and actor, impressionist, and the author/illustrator of the graphic biography IT GIRL, Jessica Martin celebrate 1920s’ Hollywood’s biggest female box office star: Clara Bow. Clara, whose complex story belies her on-screen persona, received a record-breaking 45,000 fan letters a month at the peak of her career.

The film follows the parallel stories of an early Christian ascetic monk and a modern minister, with most actors in dual roles. Gabriel (Courteney Foote) is a medieval monk who devotes himself to completing a statue of “Truth,” only to be murdered by a mob when his work turns out to be an image of a naked woman. The contemporary Gabriel is the pastor of a large wealthy urban congregation for whom religion is a matter of appearances, not beliefs. The hypocrisy of the congregation is exposed by a series of vignettes in which the Naked Truth, literally portrayed by a nude Margaret Edwards, reveals their appetites for money, sex and power. Director Lois Weber was the leading female director-screenwriter in early Hollywood and amongst the most important and prolific film directors of the silent era. At the time this film was made probably only D W Griffith could rival her status or ability. Weber viewed film-making as a means to highlight contemporary social issues in the hope of effecting social and political change. The use of a naked actress caused a sensation at the time and considerable difficulties with various local censors but the film’s subject, the naked truth, Weber’s reputation as a serious director and perhaps also the fact that the director was a woman meant that the film received a wide release to widespread critical and popular acclaim.

In honor of Women’s History Month, KinoNow is offering free streaming of Hypocrites throughout March with this version also benefiting from recorded musical accompaniment by Ben Model.

Gregory La Cava, US,1927) a browbeaten Fields gains the courage of a lion thanks to a vaudeville hypnotist in this hilarious early silent comedy. Fields stars as Elmer Finch, a meek accountant nagged by his wife, harassed by his children, and awed by his boss. After he accidentally throws a horseshoe through a window, the cops are on his tail, and a suitably ridiculous chain of events puts him under the thrall of hypnosis, where he believes himself to be a lion. With new strength he visits all those who shamed and bullied him and tries to get a raise in the process. Running Wild is a wonderful early example of Fields’ in action and a non-stop laugh riot. Plus, Pool Sharks (Dir. Edwin Middleton US, 1915) In Fields’ first on-screen appearance, two romantic rivals play a game of pool for the hand of their lady love. A silent slapstick affair, this short is partly based on Fields’ stage act and was influenced by the comedians of the day, especially Chaplin.
