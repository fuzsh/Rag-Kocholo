He moved to New York at age 18, where he had a short vaudeville career before he was told he should audition for film. He said in an interview that he then simply went to Biograph studio and told D.W. Griffith that he heard his 'type' was wanted for a picture. Griffith put him to work immediately. His film debut was as a bell-hop in a one-reel comedy, 'Saved From Himself' (1911). The following year, he was offered a contract with Lubin and Thanhouser studios, where he remained for almost three years, most of his work consisting of one reel comedies including such films as 'A Queen for a Day' (1912), 'A Sleepy Romance' (1913), and 'The Rise of Officer Casey' (1914). In 1916, his was one of dozens of jobs cut from the studio payroll. He then bounced from studio to studio, appearing in such films as 'The Conquest of Canaan' (Frohman Amusement Corp, 1916), Booth Tarkington's 'Seventeen' (Famous Players Film Company, 1917) 'God's Man' (Frohman, 1917), 'The Lesson' (Selznick, 1917), 'Over There' (Richman Pictures for Select, 1917), 'Life's Whirlpool' (Rolfe for Metro, 1917), 'Marriage' (Keeney Productions, 1918), 'A Man's World' (Metro, 1918), 'Waifs' (Astra for Pathé, August 1918), 'The Lamb and the Lion' (National Film Corporation of America for Exhibitors Mutual, March 1919), 'Why Smith Left Home' (Paramount, 1919), 'So Long Letty' (Christie for Robertson-Cole, October 1920), 'Oh, Lady, Lady' (Realart, 1920), 'Held by the Enemy,' 'The City Sparrow,' and 'Mrs. Temple's Telegram' (Paramount, 1920). In January 1923, he married Adah McWilliams; she subsequently appeared in films under the name of Gloria Williams. His career in comedy shorts and features continued, largely with the Christie Film Company, through to the advent of sound, including such titles as 'Hold Your Breath' (1924), 'Hot Doggie' (1925), 'Weak But Willing' (1925), 'A Wireless Lizzie' (1926), 'The First Night' (1927), 'A Racing Romeo' (1927), 'A Simple Sap' (1928). After talkies took over, he made only half a dozen more films, usually in bit parts or in uncredited roles. In early 1933, he came down with pneumonia and succumbed to the illness at age 39. His notable collection of photographs and movie memorabilia is now part of the Special Collections at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles.\n\nActor.
