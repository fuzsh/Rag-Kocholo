        "text": "Rossini’s Maometto Secondo is about a figure largely unknown to American audiences, who do not traditionally study the history of the Ottoman Empire in any detail. But a familiar song from the 1950s can help as a starting point. “Istanbul Not Constantinople,” inane as it is, drills one crucial fact into the listener’s brain: the capital of the Byzantine Empire, known as Constantinople in honor of its founder Constantine I, was renamed Istanbul when it fell to the Ottomans in 1453. Shortly thereafter it became the capital of their empire, and remained so until its dissolution in 1923.\n\nMehmed II (1432-1481)—translated to Maometto in Italian, sometimes spelled Mehmet in English—was the man responsible for the name-change immortalized in that earworm. He ruled twice, first from 1444-1446 and then from 1451-1481, when he saw the Ottoman Empire out of crisis and fulfilled a destiny foretold by the Prophet Muhammad: that Constantinople would become a bastion of Islam. During his reign, Istanbul emerged as the center of a multicultural empire.\n\nHere are some basic background facts. The name Ottoman is actually a European corruption of “Osman.” The Ottoman Empire (1299-1923) was founded by the Turkish tribal leader Osman I, who reigned from 1299 to 1323/4. For 600 years, the empire was ruled by one family, known as the house of Osman. It is the last of three major Muslim Empires, and the only one to be a major player in European politics. At its height, the empire stretched over three continents—Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The principle duty of all Ottoman sultans was to expand the reach of Islam. To that end, the central point of a new emperor’s accession ceremony was not the donning of a crown, but the girding of a dagger on the ruler’s belt.\n\nA Muslim empire had two religious documents at its core—the Quran and the Hadith. Believers consider the Quran to be the unerring, unadulterated word of God as told by the Prophet Muhammad. The Hadith is a collection of proverbs, anecdotes, and other commentaries about the Prophet and his life. Both sources decree that the faithful would one day conquer Constantinople. Mehmet II brought the prophecy to fruition at the age of twenty-one.\n\nHe was part of the first group of ten major sultans who helped the empire acquire all the territory that it would occupy at its zenith. The empire had risked collapse when it was defeated in 1402 at the battle of Angora (Ankara) by the Mongol leader Tamerlane. (Opera lovers may know him through Handel’s Tamerlano of 1724). Tamerlane divided the Ottoman Empire into two parts: one based in the Balkans and the other in Anatolia, or modern-day Turkey. As a result, Ottoman rulers were forced to reinvent the governing structure of the empire. Previously, the sultans collected tributes from conquered provinces that were still governed by Christian princes in the Balkans, or members of competing Muslim noble families in Anatolia. Under Mehmed II, conquered territories came to be ruled by Janissaries—soldiers conscripted from the Empire’s religious minorities, and indoctrinated to become loyal to the Sultan. After conscription as children, Janissaries converted to Islam.\n\nStudents of political science will recognize this structure of governance in the Ottoman state from Machiavelli’s The Prince. There, he contrasts the centralized authority of the Ottoman Sultanate with the monarchies of Western Europe where the crowned heads of state were sometimes captive to the interests of the nobility. Mehmed II would continue this system as he conquered further territory in the Balkans and Asia Minor. By his death in 1481, he had absorbed all the territory of the former Byzantine Empire and styled himself as its Caesar. He also built up the Ottoman Navy to combat threats like the Venetians—Maometto’s principal adversaries in the opera.\n\nAmong the advances the Ottomans under Mehmed bequeathed to military history were the use of cannons as well as that of military bands—both featured to startling effect in Rossini’s opera. (At the Siege of Constantinople in 1453, the Ottomans fired the largest cannon known to the world, the Orban Bombard.) The greatest challenges to Mehmed’s empire came from Byzantium and Venice; Negroponte, the setting of Maometto, was a Venetian colony. It was governed by Paolo Erisso, who according to one source had a daughter named Anna. The real Anna apparently had no qualms about committing suicide once the island fell to the Ottomans, and history tells us nothing of a romantic relationship between her and Mehmed. That was invented by later dramatists, following the longstanding custom of portraying noble figures who struggled to balance personal desires with their political ambitions or duties. In the world of 18th-century opera seria, these noble characters were most often shown to succeed. Even if death occurred, it was shown to be merited; the crown itself was safe, and continued in more capable or deserving hands. However, after The French Revolution of 1789 and the beheadings of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, the world and the theater had to come to terms with the idea that kings were not invulnerable, nor royal houses immortal.\n\nWhen Constantinople fell in 1453, it was not the city that it had been at the height of the Byzantine Empire. Its population had dwindled due to the ravages of plagues and crusades. However, Mehmed made the decision to rebuild Constantinople and make it the capital of his empire. He encouraged immigration into the city and negotiated with the nearby Genoese community, who had previously aided the Byzantines. Mehmed restored Constantinople to a vibrant cosmopolitan city.\n\nThe historical Mehmed was reputed fair to Christians, in some cases allowing rumors to circulate that he favored them as a group. This was presumably due to his desire to conquer Rome and reestablish the Roman Empire to its fullest extent. When his soldiers captured Constantinople, he allowed them three days to pillage, but stopped before major damage accrued. He famously designated the Hagia Sofia as a mosque. Dating from the reign of Justinian I (c. 482 - 565), the building is the best surviving example of Byzantine architecture. It was a museum for the past 90 years, until 2020 when President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey converted it back into a mosque.\n\nMaometto II brings one of history’s great politicians to the stage. Many scholars concur in calling him the greatest of Sultans, as he defined the Ottoman Empire both geographically and culturally. His legacy can still be seen in present-day Turkey.\n\nGregory Moomjy, a musicologist and journalist based in New York City, is the cofounder and Artistic Director of Opera Praktikos\n\nIt’s also hard to be sure how a single recording relates to the overall span of the singer’s activity. That he was capable of delicately shaded tones in the “passaggio” area, tending towards the head-voice side, is beyond doubt - and there are moments in Otello that can benefit from that, and go begging in most performances. Did Saléza favor that facet of his singing because he was in a room and not on the stage? Or is that just the way he sang this piece? What might he have done in a whole series of records? (He did, apparently, make at least four more at the same time as the Lucia aria, all for the legendary firm of Gianni Bettini, but none has come to light in modern times.)\n\nSaléza also appears on three of the Mapleson cylinders, recorded “Live from the Met” between 1901 and 1903. On only one of these can I glean any useful idea of his voice, but that one (a bit of the duet “Verranno a te sull’aure,” also from Lucia, sung on 2 March 1901) is interesting. The lines beginning “pensando ch’io di gemiti / mi pasco, e di dolor” are clear enough - just - to give an idea of Saléza’s E-flat at the cusp of the “passaggio.” (The prompter is as audible as the tenor: the apparatus was in his box.) Then there are two attacks on upper A-flat and a solid scale up to B-flat on “ah, su questo pegno allor.” In all these the voice sounds - marginally but distinctly - darker and heavier than on the solo cylinder.\n\nThat doesn’t prove anything, but it does raise a familiar question for students of early sound artifacts. Transposition of key was common in opera, vastly more common than it is today, and Edgardo’s final solo was a very frequent candidate for transposition. When Ricordi first issued printed orchestral parts for the opera, the whole final scene appeared twice in them, first in the keys of Donizetti’s autograph and then a half-step lower. So the possibility must be entertained that Saléza might have been singing in D-flat and not in D when he recorded his cylinder - and if it is played at a speed producing the lower key, the voice sounds, yes, darker and heavier.\n\nThere’s not a clear way to decide. As far as I know, nobody has discovered a “standard speed” for the few known Bettini cylinders. Sometimes comparison of vibrato rates reveals a sonic signature that helps us judge the proper speed for a doubtful item, but in this case we simply don’t have enough samples to go by. Without getting into the technical details, the vibrato heard on the few decipherable moments in the live duet (almost certainly sung in key) is empirically within the possible range of the voice on the Bettini cylinder as heard in either key. So in the end we must go by subjective impression.\n\nHere is a handy comparison tool: the first lines of the solo as reproduced in D; the fragment from the live duet (played twice, and one has to listen at least twice to make any sense of it at all); and finally the same opening of the solo as reproduced in D-flat. Which is right? We have to guess, but we want to guess, because one way or the other it is an Otello voice admired by the composer of Otello.\n\nGabriella Besanzoni was born in Rome in 1890, made her debut in 1910 in L’amico Fritz in Spoleto, and quickly went on to appear at every leading Italian theater. She also sang briefly at the Met and Chicago in 1919-1921, but South America became her real artistic home - season after season in Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro well into the 1930s. It’s probably because those were not record-industry centers that we have so few souvenirs of her voice - just six solos made during her New York stint, a complete Carmen from a decade later that is now a forgotten period-piece because it’s in Italian, and one impassioned aria from a 1945 São Paulo broadcast.\n\n“Voce di donna” (La gioconda) shows why we wish we had more. Every step of the scale from low Bb to high G is tested for beauty, integration, power, and malleability; none disappoints. Also tested is the ability to negotiate the register break smoothly while supplying strength on either side of it, and Besanzoni’s handling of low E-flat and its neighbors is a real lesson here.\n\nAnother lesson is the way she lets the size of her voice (obviously ample) unfold gradually over the course of the piece. Nothing is weak or unsupported early on, but she waits for the climax to let it blossom to full forte. The top G is a glory, and at the very end she expands the chest voice to hall-filling fullness - but never to the point of losing her control over it. (Notice the slight diminuendo with which she rounds off the final note: elegance without any loss of sonority or distracting change of timbre.)\n\nYet another: Besanzoni can sound like the passionate, expressive Verismo-era singer she is while still maintaining all the classic virtues - no “h” sounds breaking the legato, all attacks clean and directly on pitch, smoothly drawn portamentos, no “push” in the vibrato. You don’t have to choose between expression and discipline.\n\nI wish we could hear her florid Rossini roles! She sang four of them, at a time when all but Il Barbiere were rarities, so she must have had an affinity for coloratura. The tiny flickers of agility in her Carmen sound ideal in their combination of clarity and smoothness. But no room was found for Rossini in her too-short list of records.\n\nLuisa Tetrazzini was born in 1871, made her debut at 19 in her native Florence, and sang with the world’s elite on elite stages for a quarter-century, with celebrity concert tours for almost two more decades after that. Her records come in the category of “difficult” for many today: Tetrazzini’s hearty embrace of her own virtuosity and her devil-may-care attitude towards certain niceties have a tendency to strike modern listeners as comic. She does certain things better than almost anyone else, but barely bothers to try with others, and one senses that joie de vivre outweighed careful practicing and critical self-assessment in her artistic makeup. But there must have been careful practicing and then some in her formative years.\n\nLeila’s hymn to Brahma from Les pêcheurs de perles can serve as a good starting-point for the curious. The opening section is not what most of us would call “musical” - there is practically no dynamic shading, no shaping beyond the rise and fall of the composed notes, no particular effort to sound prayerful, no attempt to moderate the brassy timbre of the chest register. But complaints about the surface detail should not make one miss the virtue of the underlying structure, which is solid and built to last. Every single note, high, low, or middle, long or short, is strong. Not pushed, certainly not strained, just strong - firm, centered, confident, even, balanced, connected to the previous and the next. First Law of the Opera Jungle: make sure they hear you out there. And if we imagine the voice ringing out in theatrical space with all the overtones that the old recording process cut off (see listening to ancient voices), we can start to grasp why Tetrazzini filled the house in both the aural and the box office sense.\n\nThen comes the faster portion and you notice that she could operate with the same security and power while etching florid lines with chiselled clarity. (By now, maybe, your ears have adjusted enough to start liking the voice itself?) And then near the end….well, just listen through to the end even if you don’t love the start. There’s a reward.\n\n“Challenging” applies in two senses here. It is a bit of a challenge to get past the questionable aspects of Tetrazzini’s taste and find enjoyment in her records. But it’s also an extremely worthwhile challenge for any soprano just to see if she can emulate the consistency and athletic firmness, note by note, in a song like this.\n\nPol Plançon (1851-1914) was one of the top basses in the most lucrative cities on the international opera circuit - Paris, London, and New York - for about a quarter-century. He sang Verdi, Wagner, and the whole French repertory, and specialized in the Mephistos of Gounod, Boito, and Berlioz. His reputation, then and ever since (thanks to his late-career recordings), was for elegance above all.\n\nPractically any of the 68 individual items he recorded could sustain that reputation. One of his favorite showpieces was the Drum Major’s aria from Le caïd, an 1849 comedy by Ambroise Thomas that stayed in the Opéra-Comique’s repertory until 1911. Plançon often sang the aria on the Metropolitan’s Sunday concerts, and made five recordings of it. All five are fantastic, and the fifth, made in 1907, has been reissued many times. It has the best overall sound quality, but the singer, unsurprisingly for a deep bass at 56, was starting to require a cautious approach to top E. Here instead is the third version, made in 1903, in more primitive sound but with just a shade more élan in the final pages.\n\nPlançon really demonstrates just about every recognized way of getting from one note to another in the Bel Canto tradition. Slow portamento, smooth ordinary legato, firm marcato, articulation by slurred pairs, completely separated staccato notes, quick scales (ascending or descending), rising or falling arpeggios, rapid turns around a single note, a perfect trill - it’s all there, a textbook in four minutes, plus diction and character. OK, the music is a little lightweight, and we could wish he had chosen a Mozart concert aria or Assur’s mad scene from Semiramide instead….but still.\n\nFor those curious about agility: the 16th-note runs near the end go at a tempo of MM=120, accelerating to about 132 as Plançon steps on the gas in the coda. Manuel García jr., writing in 1847, said that 132 was the required pace for a professional-level soprano (and that the most virtuosic singers could reach 152!). Plançon is one of the few basses on record to get all the way up to “soprano speed” - but he had plenty of competitors who could handle 120 with no problem.\n\nThe charms of Martha have faded, but Flotow’s sentimental comedy was once a repertory staple worldwide. That meant, of course, that translations were prepared for every opera-loving country, and when starry Italians were about to sing it, Flotow made it his business to add some new arias. This is one of the latter, sung by the starriest Italian baritone of them all, Mattia Battistini (1856-1928).\n\nBattistini had some faults, especially in his later years (we can hear him only from the age of 46 to 68). But this disc, cut in 1906 when he was fifty, mainly shows his virtues, and they were the classic ones. Above all, sheer line: a tone that keeps spinning - no gaps, no falters, no fuzzy notes or lackluster ones. It’s not so much the details that make the effect here - it’s the absence of negative details, the cumulative impact of uninterrupted quality.\n\nIt is a baritone of distinctly tenorish quality - perhaps startlingly so in the recitative, where there is no hint of the darkened vowel sounds that later became popular for lower male voices. Even in the context of Battistini’s time, this was definitely a voice happier at the top of the range than the bottom. But there is plenty of power in the area around middle C that is not quite high enough for most tenors to sound powerful. And once the aria proper starts, the magic begins: soft notes like velvet, loud ones like silver and seemingly effortless. And it just keeps coming, eventually with hypnotic effect through sheer continuity and generosity of tone. The burst of virtuosity in the final cadenza is an unexpected bonus. A copy of the music can be downloaded here, in case anyone would like to follow along or any lyric baritones would like a fresh audition aria.\n\nThis week’s record is the only known sample of a voice from which we wish we had dozens. On 22 April 1905, a visit was made to the Paris studios of the Fonotipia company by Jean de Reszke, by far the most celebrated tenor in the world, who had just two years earlier retired from the stage, and Mme. de Reszke, née Marie de Goulaine, Comtesse de Mailly-Nesle by a previous marriage. The tenor recorded an aria each by Gounod and Massenet and ordered their immediate destruction upon hearing the test pressings. He also sat as piano accompanist for his wife in songs by Lalo and Gounod along with two excerpts from the latter’s Sapho.\n\nBeing a noblewoman, Marie de Reszke had never sung professionally, and her records may not have been put on sale. Only the Gounod song has ever been found (though with a properly printed label that suggests at least the intent of normal publication). It preserves one of the smoothest, steadiest, most polished mezzo-soprano voices ever recorded. One can only guess whether she also had the power and range of a true operatic instrument, but she had perfect legato, exquisite blending of the registers (passing easily from chest to head in smooth portamento), eloquent and unaffected pronunciation of Alphonse Lamartine’s verses (or rather the first stanza of them), simple but unerring phrase-direction. Just what you want to hear, and just the thing to give interest to such a slender morceau as “Au rossignol.”\n\nHer vibrato is narrow and rapid - faster than that of anyone singing today, though only on the high side of average for her time. It may take a little getting used to; a lot has changed, in both technique and taste, since the time of Romantic opera. But it is 100% consistent and regular. And the singer’s poise and concentration are remarkable for someone completely unused to recording. She creates a real atmosphere."
