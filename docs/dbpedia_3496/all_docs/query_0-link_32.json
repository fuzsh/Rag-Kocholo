        "text": "607: Bloodlust!\n\nby Wyn Hilty\n\nI’m Dairy Council intolerant.\n\nThe American Dairy Association, which also owns the name National Dairy Council, provides educational material and informational kits all about dairy products and the fine dietary properties they offer. They also provide information about lactose intolerance, which is an inability to digest the sugar found in milk and other dairy products, causing all manner of nasty gastrointestinal upsets.\n\nIs Velveeta a member of the National Dairy Council?\n\nVelveeta is a processed cheese product manufactured by Kraft Foods. See previous note.\n\n[Name in credits.] Ladies and gentlemen … Mrs. Loretta Doyle.\n\nLoretta Lynn (1932-2022) was an American country singer-songwriter with a career spanning six decades. In her concert performances, she was traditionally introduced by an offstage announcer who said, somewhat solemnly, “Ladies and gentlemen … Miss Loretta Lynn.”\n\n[Sung.] I was warned as a child …\n\nA line from the song “The Woman in the Moon,” from the musical A Star Is Born. Sample lyrics: “I was warned as a child of thirteen/Not to act too strong/Try to look like you belong but don’t push, girl/Save your time and trouble/Don't misbehave.” This is also possibly a riff on Loretta Lynn’s (see previous note) youthful marriage: though biographies now state that she was married at age fifteen, earlier accounts of her life say she wed when she was just thirteen years old.\n\nHere in frame 54, Mr. Connally is struck by the bullet.\n\nIn 1963, when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, a local clothing manufacturer named Abraham Zapruder brought his home movie camera to film the motorcade procession. His is the only film record of the assassination and was extensively used by the Warren Commission in its investigation of the president’s death. Then-Texas Governor John Connally was riding in Kennedy’s limousine and was badly injured by the same bullet that struck the president.\n\nLet’s go tip some cattle!\n\nCow tipping is apparently a favorite nocturnal sport among rural folks who have consumed between five and seven beers. Opinion is divided on just how prevalent and/or possible the practice is, but your basic cow tipping expedition goes something like this:\n\n1. Chug aforesaid beers.\n\n2. Find a field containing some dozing cows (which sleep standing up).\n\n3. Climb over fence.\n\n4. Sneak up on cow.\n\n5. Push on cow’s side.\n\n6. Run.\n\nGanj, Betty?\n\n“Ganj” is short for “ganja,” which is the Jamaican word for marijuana.\n\nNow Junior Samples and Lulu Belle make their appearance.\n\nJunior Samples (1926-1983) was a cornball comedian/country singer/harmonica player known for his long run on Hee Haw, the country-western variety show that aired from 1969-1992; Samples appeared on the show until his death in 1983. Lulu Belle (real name Myrtle Cooper; 1913-1999) was a country musician who performed for decades with her husband, Scott Wiseman (1908-1981), as “Lulu Belle and Scotty.” Later in life she became a state representative for North Carolina, serving from 1975-1978. The writers may have meant Lulu Roman, a singer and comedian who actually was a regular on Hee Haw.\n\nI’ve got to be careful of my new jeans because I got them at Pamida.\n\nPamida was a chain of department stores that had more than 175 locations in the Midwestern United States, mostly in small towns. Founded in 1963, the last Pamida stores closed in 2012. The name was a combination of the first two letters in the names of co-founder Jim Witherspoon’s three sons: Pat, Mike, and David.\n\nTonight on ESPN2: Hayloft rope swinging.\n\nESPN is a cable sports channel. ESPN2 began airing in 1993 as a sister station; it focused on younger, edgier sports like snowboarding and BMX racing. When that formula failed, it turned to poker, billiards, and extreme sports.\n\nThe summer of my German humiliation.\n\nSummer of My German Soldier is a novel by Bette Green about a young Jewish girl in Arkansas during World War II, who falls in love with a German prisoner of war being held in a nearby camp.\n\nA very special Ziffel family reunion.\n\nFred and Doris Ziffel were characters on the TV sitcom Green Acres, which aired from 1965-1971. The couple (played by Hank Patterson and Barbara Pepper) had an adopted “son,” Arnold the hyperintelligent pig. Television promos promising “a very special” episode of a sitcom or drama are a tip-off that the show will be tackling a social issue, such as underage drinking or eating disorders. Characters will learn a valuable lesson. There will be hugs.\n\nOh, the lunch counter at Tom and Rosie’s diner.\n\nActors Tom and Roseanne Arnold jointly invested in a restaurant in Eldon, Iowa, called Tom’s Big Food Diner. After their divorce, the restaurant closed.\n\n[Sung.] Then one foggy Christmas Eve, Santa came to say …\n\nA line from the Christmas song “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,” first recorded by Gene Autry in 1949. Sample lyrics: “Then one foggy Christmas Eve/Santa came to say/‘Rudolph with your nose so bright/Won’t you guide my sleigh tonight?’”\n\nJerry Lee Lewis joins the family for dinner.\n\nJerry Lee Lewis (1935-2022) was a musician known for such hits as “Great Balls of Fire,” and also for having married his thirteen-year-old cousin (he was twenty-two), a scandal that almost ruined his career.\n\nSusie drains the last of her Dirty Banana.\n\nA Dirty Banana is a shake made with vanilla ice cream and several varieties of liqueur, including banana liqueur.\n\nBack home, a Hershey’s truck has overturned and everyone’s getting all the free chocolate they want.\n\nThe Hershey Company, based in Hershey, Pennsylvania, is the largest chocolate company in the world. In addition to its trademark chocolate bar, the company makes Hershey’s Kisses, Almond Joy, Kit Kats and Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, among many more.\n\nUncle Jim’s outta control—we frag him today.\n\n“Fragging” is the act of soldiers assassinating their own commanding officer, usually because he is seen as incompetent or leading them into danger. The term comes from “fragmentation grenade” and originated during the Vietnam War, where gung-ho but inexperienced lieutenants were often put in command of platoons of battle-hardened soldiers, a combination that did not lead to confidence in leadership. It's estimated that around 900-1,000 fragging incidents took place in Vietnam, but very few were prosecuted, as they were easily concealed as battlefield errors, sabotage, or enemy actions.\n\nLet my people go!\n\nFrom Exodus 8:1: “And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.”\n\nElsie and I are in love and you can’t stop us.\n\nElsie the Cow is the cartoon mascot of the Borden Dairy Company. Introduced in 1936, Elsie was named one of the top ten advertising icons of the 20th century by Advertising Age magazine. Her cartoon “mate” is Elmer the Bull, the mascot of Elmer’s glue. Try not to think too much about what glue is made of.\n\nWhy, Uncle Jim’s even enrolled them in the Posse Comitatus.\n\nPosse Comitatus is a radical anti-government movement, the forerunner of the militia movement of the 1990s. Posse Comitatus’s members believe that any form of government above the county level is illegitimate. Many of them refuse to pay taxes or obtain driver’s licenses and argue that U.S. currency is invalid because it has gone off the gold standard.\n\nMy Jam Handy!\n\nA riff on “Jim Dandy” (a.k.a. “Jim Dandy to the Rescue”), an R&B song written by Lincoln Chase and originally recorded in 1958 by LaVern Baker. Southern rock group Black Oak Arkansas released a popular cover of it in 1973; their lead singer, Jim Mangrum, goes by the nickname “Jim Dandy” Mangrum. The Jam Handy Organization was a prolific producer and distributor of educational films, also called “social guidance” films, from 1935-1968. Founded by former Olympic swimmer Henry Jamison “Jam” Handy, numerous Jam Handy productions have found a home on MST3K, including Hired! (Show 423, Bride of the Monster & Show 424, Manos, The Hands of Fate), The Selling Wizard (Show 603, The Dead Talk Back), and Young Man’s Fancy (Show 610, The Violent Years). The MST3K Special Edition DVD of Manos: The Hands of Fate features a documentary on the history of the Jam Handy Organization.\n\nThat’s the Edvard Munch painting that wasn’t stolen.\n\nIn 1994, a version of The Scream, the most famous work by Norwegian painter Edvard Munch, was stolen off the wall of the national art museum in Oslo; it was recovered unharmed several months later. Poor Munch is a frequent victim of art thefts; another version of The Scream (there are four total) was taken from a museum at gunpoint in 2004, and three other paintings were taken from an upscale restaurant in Norway in 2005.\n\nLooks like Ivan Lendl.\n\nIvan Lendl was one of the dominant professional tennis players in the 1980s, for several years ranked number one in the world. Before retiring in 1994, he had racked up nearly a hundred singles titles, including eight Grand Slam titles, and earned a record $21 million in prize money.\n\nYou know, this is exactly how Leakey found Lucy.\n\nLouis Leakey (1903-1972) was an anthropologist famous for his paleontology work in the Olduvai Gorge, an area in Tanzania. There he discovered bones that appeared to belong to a proto-human, or ape-like person. His work radically altered the body of thought about human evolution, and his conclusion that humanity originated in Africa is now widely accepted. His son, Richard Leakey, is also a well-known paleoanthropologist. That said, the hominid skeleton dubbed Lucy, after the Beatles song “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,” was not one of Leakey’s finds; she was discovered in 1974 by American anthropologist Donald Johanson.\n\nThis is the best Saul Bass credit sequence ever!\n\nSaul Bass (1920-1996) was a graphic designer known for his work on movie title sequences; he worked with such renowned directors as Alfred Hitchcock, Otto Preminger, and Martin Scorsese. His films include Psycho, Casino, and The Man with the Golden Arm. He also designed a number of corporate logos, including the famous AT&T “globe.”\n\nThe big Cunha.\n\n“The big kahuna” is a slang phrase meaning “the big cheese,” or “a very important person.” It derives from surfer slang, which in turn derives from the Hawaiian word for priest or shaman.\n\nFellas, it’s too rough to feed you.\n\nA riff on some lyrics from “The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,” a 1976 song by Canadian singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot. A number-one hit in the U.S. and Canada, the song commemorates the sinking of the SS Edmund Fitzgerald, an ore freighter and the longest ship operating in the Great Lakes at that time. On November 10, 1975, “Big Fitz” encountered extreme weather conditions, broke apart, and sank in Lake Superior, killing all twenty-nine crew members. The pertinent lyrics: “When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck/Sayin’ ‘Fellas, it’s too rough to feed ya’/At seven p.m. a main hatchway caved in/He said, ‘Fellas, it’s been good to know ya’.”\n\nIt’s the Exxon Valdez.\n\nOn March 23, 1989, the Exxon Valdez, an oil tanker carrying 53 million gallons of crude oil from Alaska, ran aground on a reef, spilling nearly 11 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound. The captain had been drinking earlier in the day, and the third mate who was on duty when the accident occurred may have been working for as long as 18 hours straight. Roughly 1,300 miles of beach were contaminated, and estimates of wildlife killed by the spill include 250,000 birds, 2,800 sea otters, 300 harbor seals, 250 bald eagles, 22 killer whales, and billions of salmon and herring eggs. Cleanup efforts cost more than $2 billion.\n\n[Sung.] I say Brandy, you’re a fine girl …\n\nA reference to the song “Brandy (You’re a Fine Girl)” by Looking Glass. Sample lyrics: “The sailor said ‘Brandy, you’re a fine girl’ (you’re a fine girl)/’What a good wife you would be’ (such a fine girl)/’But my life, my love and my lady is the sea …’”\n\nChutes and Ladders.\n\nChutes and Ladders is a board game produced by Milton Bradley; it is based on the children’s game Snakes and Ladders, which has been around since at least the 19th century and possibly long before that.\n\nI’m glad I brought my bolero jacket.\n\nA bolero jacket is a short, tailored women’s jacket kind of like a vest with sleeves, the sides of which only meet at one point.\n\nRobert Maxwell: the untold story.\n\nRobert Maxwell (1923-1991) was a British publishing tycoon. At one point he owned several book publishing companies, a string of British tabloids, the New York Daily News, and many more companies. However, by the 1990s he was in shaky financial circumstances and used $1.2 billion he secretly siphoned off from employee pension funds and other sources in an attempt to keep his empire from crumbling. On November 5, 1991, he disappeared off his yacht, and his body was recovered from the Atlantic some time later. The official cause of death was a heart attack plus accidental drowning.\n\nI’ll just run up to the Lido deck and see what Isaac is doing.\n\nIsaac Washington was the bartender on the TV series The Love Boat, which aired from 1977-1986. The part was played by Ted Lange. In Great Britain, a Lido is a swimming pool and the surrounding facilities, or a part of a beach where swimming and sunbathing are allowed. On a cruise ship, the Lido deck is where you’ll find the swimming pool, water slides, Jacuzzis, and the like.\n\nTime to visit the poop deck, if you know what I mean.\n\nOn a ship, the poop deck (from the French word poupe, meaning stern, or rear) is the deck that forms the roof of the cabin toward the back end of the ship.\n\nWait, you forgot Tallulah Bankhead!\n\nLifeboat is a 1944 movie starring Tallulah Bankhead (1902-1968) as one of the survivors of a German U-boat attack. The film was directed by Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nThe cruise of wine and roses.\n\nThe Days of Wine and Roses is a 1962 film starring Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick as a couple torn apart by alcoholism.\n\nOh, no, they forgot the piano!\n\nThe Piano is a 1993 film starring Holly Hunter as a woman who refuses to speak, and who communicates only through the music she plays on her piano. At the beginning of the film, Hunter’s new husband abandons her piano on the beach, where it is claimed by their neighbor (played by Harvey Keitel).\n\nTonight: love in the landing at Normandy!\n\nOn June 6, 1944, the Allied forces launched a major assault on Hitler’s forces in France with an amphibious landing on the beaches in Normandy: D-Day. Many of the beaches where the Allied troops waded ashore were heavily fortified by the Germans, and casualties were horrendous. A furious fight raged through northern France for the following two months, concluding with the liberation of Paris in August.\n\nHey, a counter worker from Long John Silver’s.\n\nLong John Silver’s is a chain of fast-food fish restaurants founded in 1969. It has more than 1,200 locations worldwide.\n\nLinguine.\n\nLinguine is a kind of pasta, a little wider than spaghetti, but not quite as wide as fettuccine. This might also be a nod to a scene in the 1968 comedy The Odd Couple, starring Walter Matthau as Oscar Madison and Jack Lemmon as Felix Unger. The dialogue:\n\nOscar: Now kindly remove that spaghetti from my poker table.\n\n[Felix laughs.]\n\nOscar: The hell’s so funny?\n\nFelix: It’s not spaghetti, it’s linguine.\n\n[Oscar picks up the linguine and throws it violently against the wall.]\n\nOscar: Now it’s garbage.\n\nUnfortunately, they landed on Bikini Atoll in 1947.\n\nBikini Atoll is a small atoll in the Pacific, part of the Marshall Islands. After World War II, it was chosen as the site of nuclear bomb testing by the United States, and this decision was announced to the 150 or so natives living on the island. They were relocated to a nearby, smaller atoll, where they nearly starved to death. The government continues to give them financial restitution and, after a poorly planned relocation back to Bikini in the 1970s that led to birth defects and illness, the U.S. settled with them for $150 million. The international Nuclear Claims Tribunal awarded the islanders more than $500 million, compensation the United States has thus far declined to pay. Back on the atoll, meanwhile, more than twenty nuclear tests were conducted between 1946 and 1958.\n\nGreat plan. Look, can we just go to Red Lobster?\n\nRed Lobster is a chain of seafood restaurants with hundreds of locations across the country. It was founded in 1968 by Bill Darden.\n\nOn his resume, Robert Reed listed this as The Tempest.\n\nThe Tempest is a play by William Shakespeare about a group of seafarers washed up on a remote island ruled by a sorceror, Prospero.\n\nOoh, she’s a Breck Girl.\n\nThe Breck Girl was an advertising icon for Breck shampoo, first appearing in 1937 and launching Breck’s first national advertising campaign in 1946. There were numerous Breck Girls over the years; actress Kim Basinger was even a Breck Girl early in her career.\n\nSounds like James Galway’s bringing up the rear.\n\nJames Galway is an Irish flute player who has enjoyed an extremely successful performing career, one of the first flautists to succeed as a soloist. He got his start in the Berlin Philharmonic in the 1970s but quickly struck out on his own.\n\nI’m here to tell you about Mutual of Omaha.\n\nMutual of Omaha is an insurance company based in Nebraska. It is best known as the sponsor of the long-running TV series Wild Kingdom, which aired from 1963-1988 and was revived on the cable channel Animal Planet in 2002. The original show featured grandfatherly host Marlin Perkins and his virile sidekick Jim Fowler unironically decked out in safari jackets as they scoured savannahs and swamps in search of wild animals to annoy.\n\nKicks just keep getting harder to find.\n\nA line from the 1966 song “Kicks,” originally written by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil for Eric Burdon and the Animals, but Burdon turned it down and it was instead recorded by Paul Revere and the Raiders. It was a top ten hit in the U.S. and a number one hit in Canada. Sample lyrics: “And don’t it seem like/Kicks just keep gettin’ harder to find/And all your kicks ain’t bringin’ you peace of mind.”\n\nAnd Fudge Stripes.\n\nFudge Stripes are a brand of cookies, consisting of shortbread covered with stripes of chocolate. They are manufactured by Keebler.\n\nAn odd production of Blithe Spirit.\n\nBlithe Spirit is a comic play (and later a movie) by Noel Coward (1899-1973), about a man who is haunted by the ghost of his dead wife.\n\nOh, Oscar, Oscar, Oscar.\n\nAn often-repeated line from the television series The Odd Couple, starring Tony Randall as Felix Unger and Jack Klugman as Oscar Madison. The show ran from 1970-1975.\n\nThere’s a two-drunk minimum in this film.\n\nA riff on “two-drink minimum,” a common policy in many nightclubs, comedy clubs in particular, which dictates that patrons, in addition to whatever cover charge or ticket price they may have paid to get in, must also purchase at least two drinks. In recent years, safety concerns over mandating alcohol consumption have led to a “two-item minimum,” which allows patrons to purchase appetizers or soft drinks in place of booze.\n\nBecause you never get a second chance to make a first impression.\n\nThe slogan “You never get a second chance to make a first impression” was used in 1980s commercials for Head & Shoulders shampoo.\n\nAnd he looks terrific in a gingham skirt.\n\nGingham is a kind of dyed fabric used in clothing, particularly women’s dresses, that was popular during the American westward expansion of the 19th century. Checked or plaid gingham is best known in popular culture: Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz (1939) and Mary Ann in Gilligan’s Island (CBS, 1964-1967) both wore checked gingham.\n\nWe’ll leave a light on.\n\nIn 1986, the Motel 6 chain began running a series of commercials featuring Tom Bodett that used the tagline “We’ll leave the light on for you.” The campaign proved phenomenally successful, running for 15 years.\n\nDid you bring Paxil?\n\nPaxil, or paroxitene, is an antidepressant medication, one of the so-called serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), of which the most famous is Prozac. It is also used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder and social anxiety disorder.\n\nAnd see what the boys in the back room will have.\n\n“See What the Boys in the Back Room Will Have” is a song by Frederick Hollander and Frank Loesser. It has been performed by Diahann Carroll, Marlene Dietrich, and Della Reese, among others. Sample lyrics: “See what the boys in the back room will have/And tell them I’m having the same/Go see what the boys in the back room will have/And give them the poison they name.”\n\nEva Braun’s bed and breakfast.\n\nEva Braun (1912-1945) was the mistress and briefly the wife of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler. She first met him in 1929 when she was 17 years old and began living with him in 1936. She remained with him throughout World War II and finally married him in a brief ceremony the day before the two of them committed suicide rather than be captured by Allied forces.\n\nMr. Carlin! –Hey, Hartley. Sorry I’m late.\n\nElliot Carlin was one of psychologist Robert Hartley’s regular patients on The Bob Newhart Show; the role was played by Jack Riley.\n\nWhite Shoulders!\n\nWhite Shoulders is a women’s perfume manufactured by Evyan.\n\nHe looks like an Easter Island statue.\n\nEaster Island is a small island in the south Pacific. It was inhabited by Polynesian settlers for hundreds of years, but sometime in the 16th century the civilization underwent a drastic decline due to deforestation and overpopulation on the tiny island.

His works included Swimming to Cambodia, Monster in a Box, and Gray’s Anatomy. He committed suicide in 2004.\n\n[Sung.] Clap on!\n\nA riff on commercials for The Clapper, an electrical switch that makes household lamps—or any device plugged into it—turn on or off in response to loud noises, such as clapping. In the late 1990s, commercials for The Clapper took on a pop culture life of their own—the low budget and ubiquitous TV ads featured people happily clapping to turn on their lights or turn off their TV, accompanied by a jingle singing: “Clap on! Clap off! The Clapper!” The jingle was actually borrowed from a jingle in a 1980s commercial for Sine-Off cold medicine.\n\nMammy, sir.\n\nSee note on Al Jolson, above.\n\nHe’s regained his sangfroid.\n\nSangfroid (French for “cold blood”) is the state of keeping your cool in the face of trying circumstances or danger.\n\nYes, I call that one Lutheran Love.\n\nLutheranism is a branch of Protestant Christianity that follows the teachings of 16th-century reformer Martin Luther. Early Lutherans frowned on dancing and other secular, depraved activities; modern Lutherans are considerably more relaxed. There is a high concentration of Lutherans in the American Midwest and Upper Plains states.\n\nLinc. Julie. Over there.\n\nLinc Hayes and Julie Barnes (played by Clarence Williams III and Peggy Lipton, respectively) were two of the hip young police narcs on the TV series The Mod Squad, which aired from 1968-1973. (The third was Pete Cochran, played by Michael Cole.)\n\nWe didn’t steal no bike, neither.\n\nA reference to Show 514, Teenage Strangler.\n\nShould have had a tech rehearsal.\n\nIn theater, music performances, and film and TV production, a tech rehearsal is a rehearsal that concentrates on lighting, sound effects, pyrotechnics, and any mechanical riggings for stage sets or performers."
