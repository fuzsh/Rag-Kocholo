        "text": "One hundred years ago this month, Grace Kingsley returned from her annual vacation to news about a movie that looked like a big box-office hit.\n\nWhen The Covered Wagon showed at Grauman’s Million Dollar Theater, it broke all records and it seemed that it would hold them for some time to come. However, the way in which crowds thronged the theater last week to see Rudolph Valentino in Monsieur Beaucaire it seems this picture will even overtop the success of the former picture.\n\nBeaucaire was Rudolph Valentino’s return to the screen after a two-year long absence caused by a legal fight with his studio, Famous Players-Lasky. He wanted better quality scripts and productions, and he refused to act in films until he got them. To keep his name before the public, he’d gone on an exhibition dance tour, which you can read about on Donna Hill’s Falcon Lair site.\n\nHis break didn’t hurt his acting skills; Kingsley said that he’d become a “polished, finished actor, which enhances the charm of his fascinating love scenes.”\n\nHe certainly got what he wanted with his new contract. Beaucaire was a lavish production based on a short novel by the popular and respected author, Booth Tarkington. Set in the court of Louis XVth, Valentino played a charming duke. The king orders him to marry Princess Henriette (Bebe Daniels) but he doesn’t want to so he runs away to England disguised as a barber, M. Beaucaire. There he becomes infatuated with Lady Mary Carlisle (Doris Kenyon), woos her disguised as a noble and fights hired bullies. Then Lady Mary is told he’s a barber so she dumps him, he gets pardoned by the king, returns to France and reconciles with Henriette.\n\nIt had its world premiere in Los Angeles on Monday, August 11th and Kingsley’s boss Edwin Schallert attended. He was quite impressed, writing:\n\nThis is indeed a picture of quality, and one that enriches beyond measure the pictorial art of the screen. It is the finest and most enchanting achievement that the East has yet offered before the eyes of the West, and it is an auspicious production to signalize the return of Rudolph Valentino.\n\nFor the most part he admired Valentino’s performance, though he thought the star wasn’t quite French enough and objected because “too much effort was made to impress the members of the audience with Valentino’s physique, especially in the scenes of wrestling and where he stands forth garbed only in a pair of silken trunks” (I bet the fans didn’t mind). However, he liked the actor’s sense of humor when he was in disguise as a barber and was relieved that didn’t have to charm women. Schallert also thought that the sword fighting was “of the very best.” Furthermore, the photography, production design and direction were all outstanding and he said, “There is nothing but the highest praise for everything else that enhances the glamor of the screen as it has rarely been enhanced before” particularly the direction.\n\nHe concluded, “Beaucaire is exceptional in the majority of respects, and can justifiably be chronicled among the very best features of the year.”\n\nOther critics agreed with him. C.S. Sewell wrote a typical trade review for Moving Picture World:\n\nCertainly no picture of greater beauty, artistry, magnificence or pictorial appeal has ever reached the silver screen…the story is fascinating, finely directed, acted by an unusually fine cast, and holds the interest throughout, and coupled with Valentino’s tremendous popularity and the fact that he has a role that suits him well and will appeal strongly to his admirers, it looks as if Monsieur Beaucaire is going to establish a lot of new box-office records.\n\nMany critics did still admired it when they wrote their top ten best film lists for the year. The Film Daily Yearbook had a round-up of their lists, and it came in at number 3, just under The Thief of Bagdad and The Sea Hawk. It appeared on 36 lists of trade press reviewers and newspaper critics, including Edwin Schallert’s.\n\nHowever, the critics’ admiration didn’t translate into the outrageously big ticket sales and long theatrical runs that people had predicted. It did very well in its first weeks in the big cities; Helen Klumph reported in the L.A. Times that it was still doing big business in New York in its third week at the Strand Theater, when other houses were only half-full during the heat of August. It stayed in Los Angeles for a little over four weeks and its final day was September 9th. So it was in the theater longer than most of movies the day, but not an immensely long, multi-month run like The Covered Wagon or The Thief of Bagdad. The expectations for it were just too high.\n\nHowever, it did not fare so well in the smaller markets. Film Daily ran an article in November on its box office disappointment: “It’s not a trade secret. Beaucaire is not holding up in the “the sticks”…What I mean to say is that the picture has been a flop for real money or real satisfaction after the first runs.” He accused the film of not being “real entertainment.”\n\nNevertheless, Valentino’s career was fine and he went on to make more successful movies– The Son of the Sheik and The Eagle were still in his future.\n\n“Idol of Screen in New Role,” Los Angeles Times, August 11, 1924.\n\nHelen Klumph, “Rudolph Minuets Along,” Los Angeles Times, August 31, 1924.\n\n“The Lesson of Monsieur Beaucaire,” Film Daily, November 22, 1924, p. 4.\n\nEdwin Schallert, “Beaucaire is Art Gorgeous,” Los Angeles Times, August 12, 1924.\n\nC.S. Sewall, “Monsieur Beaucaire,” Moving Picture World, August 25, 1924, p. 650.\n\n“The Ten Best Pictures of 1924,” Film Daily Yearbook, 1925, pp. 623-629.\n\nOne hundred years ago this week, Grace Kingsley reported on another instance of the oddest trend I’ve found in her columns: there was yet another movie star’s fake brother at large:\n\nThe Thomas H. Ince Studios of Culver City have received a telegram from the Atlanta Journal of Atlanta GA, reading “Man here claiming to be Albert Ray, brother of Charles. Is he brother?”\n\nThomas H. Ince wired back, “Charles Ray has no brother. Therefore the man referred to in your wire must be an imposter. Mr. Ray has had this brought to his attention several times recently. No doubt the man is using this supposed relationship in different parts of the country. Appreciate your calling it to my attention.\n\nThat’s a lot of extra words for a telegram! Claiming to have a famous relative sounds like an odd way to convince people to hire you or give you money, but this wasn’t the only time it happened: earlier I wrote about Rudolph Valentino’s and Buster Keaton’s fake brothers. It seems that even a less famous actor like Ray was afflicted with one. So far, I haven’t found any fake sisters.\n\nCharles Ray had played naïve country boys who moved to the big city in a several films for Thomas Ince. Lea Stans wrote a terrific biographical article about him at Silent-ology.\n\nHe’d tried to break away from that with an independent production, The Courtship of Miles Standish (1923), but that was a financial flop and by 1924 he’d returned to the Ince studio. He really didn’t have a brother, just a sister named Birdie.* What’s a bit confusing about the story is that he did have a cousin named Albert Ray who had been an actor, but he moved into directing in 1921.\n\nThe man who was impersonating Ray’s brother was actually named Grady Henry Terry. He was born on June 13, 1897 in Spiro, Oklahoma. In 1900 he was living on a farm in Hunt, Texas with his grandparents, William and Mary Hodges, his older sister Mattie, and some aunts and uncles. When he registered for the first world war draft in 1918, he was living in Fort Worth, Texas. His form mentioned a distinctive physical characteristic: he had no right arm. It kept him from being drafted.\n\nHe moved around a lot, marrying Gertrude Worthington in Chicago on November 4, 1922.\n\nHis next appearance in the papers or public records was in Kingsley’s story, and it was the first report I’ve found of his Ray impersonation. It looks like Ince’s telegram might have stopped Terry in Atlanta, but he just moved on to the next town. In 1925 he was in Los Angeles and in August Variety reported: “Police have been requested to take into custody Albert N. Ray, who posed as a brother of Charles Ray, film star, and obtained various sums of money from Hollywood residents.” When he was caught, he changed his story, claiming to be Ray’s cousin Al, but they saw through that quickly. He’d gotten around $1000. It sounds like he was good at being a con man—for a while.\n\nThe papers never said if he went to jail, but by when it was time to register for the 1926 elections he said he was a salesman and living near downtown Los Angeles. He hadn’t reformed but he changed his scam a little bit, getting paid to perform prologs in movie theaters. That same year Film Daily reported: “The National Better Business Bureau yesterday warned exhibitors that an individual using the name of Albert Ray, who has claimed to be a brother of Charles Ray and sought the confidence of a number of exhibitors on this account, is not related to the latter, according to investigations conducted by affiliated Western Better Business Bureaus.”\n\nTerry got arrested in L.A. again in August 1927, and Charles Ray was ready to do his part for justice. The L.A. Times reported that he and his father went to the Beverly Hills jail with a file full of evidence about his crimes that they’d collected. The paper said Terry “had toured the United States for three years, posing as his brother, appearing on prologs shown in conjunction with Ray’s pictures, and, in more ways than one, embarrassing him, Ray charged.” They also mentioned that Ray finally got to meet his tormentor: “When Ray appeared at the station, the accused man pleaded with him to drop the charges, declaring he was ‘cured’ of his desire to pose as the actor’s brother.”\n\nNeither Ray nor the police believed that. There was a second complainant, according to Moving Picture World,who “asserted Terry had taken $14 from her ostensibly for magazines as the brother of the star. The magazines, she claimed, never arrived.” Terry went before a judge and the City Attorney presented signed statements from Charles Ray and his father, C.T. Ray. Terry immediately admitted that he’d impersonated his brother, but he meant it as a “joke.” He got sentenced on two charges of obtaining money under false pretenses to 120 days in the Beverly Hills jail.\n\nHe was out of jail by January 1928 when two men held him up as he was driving, but he convinced them to return the money because he had only one arm. Terry was awfully good at talking his way out of bad situations.\n\nNevertheless, jail didn’t reform him and he went on to commit worse crimes (Charles Ray didn’t have as nearly much trouble as his other victims). Terry was a bigamist, and it finally caught up with him in New York City in April 1929. Variety reported:\n\nGrady Terry, 30, who during the past five years has posed on various occasions as a brother of Charles Ray, the film star, and as an English baronet, was committed to the Observation Ward at Bellevue Hospital for 10 days by Judge George L. Donnellan of General Sessions. He has pleaded guilty to the latest charge against him, that of unlawfully marrying three women. He faces five years in Sing Sing when he comes up for sentence May 13, unless he is adjudged insane by the hospital authorities. Meanwhile he is under a three-year sentence in the penitentiary, imposed two weeks ago by the justices of Special Sessions for petit larceny.\n\nOn the present indictment Terry admits he married Dorothy Taft, 17, February 20 in New York, although he was already married to Gertrude Worthington of 315 West 97th Street, whom he wedded in 1922 in Chicago. Further investigation proved that he was married to Edith Damsky, 16, October 20 last by Supreme Court Justice Sherman. Except in his marriage to the Worthington girl, Terry went through the other ceremonies under assumed names.\n\nDuring his career Grady has caused considerable worry to Charlie Ray, the actor, and the latter’s relatives. About a year ago the defendant was sentenced to 120 days in jail in Beverly Hills, California, for using Ray’s name in gypping local merchants. His police record since 1923 show that he has been in trouble in practically every large city from coast to coast.\n\nDuring these escapades he posed as Ray, and as the latter’s brother. In his speedy love affairs, he represented himself as a motion picture magnate, a reporter, ‘Sir Albert Ray,’ ‘Philip McHue,’ ‘Captain Albert Ray Brown,’ who is credited with having shot down Baron von Richtofen, the German ace during the war, and ‘Captain Lloyd Brown.’ To further impress the girls he made love to, Terry would flash a bundle of fake decorations. In his pedigree Terry described himself as a ‘theatrical man.’\n\nYikes. The New York Marriage Index backs up their report: Edith Damsky married a Ray Brown in 1928 and Dorothy Taft married a Philip A. McHue in 1929, both in Manhattan.\n\nSomehow he wriggled out of the worst of the punishment for these charges, and was back in Los Angeles in time for the 1930 census in early April. He told the census taker that he was a divorced car salesman. It seems like that was true, and he continued to stay out of trouble (or at least out of the newspapers). Maybe the threat of Sing Sing Prison finally turned him around. After that he only shows up in vital records. In 1940 he was a salesman living alone in San Gabriel, California and when he registered for the second world war draft, he was unemployed and married to Mary Clevenger McGuire, a secretary for a real estate title research company. They lived in El Monte. In 1950 he was back to selling cars. He and his wife divorced in the mid-1950’s. He died on February 18, 1969 in El Monte.\n\nThis month, Kingsley also reported about the fierce competition for a role in an upcoming movie:\n\nIf you are to believe Gladys Hulette, every girl in town under 40 is hoping to play Peter Pan. Miss Hulette, who is a pretty young actress, who might be expected to fulfil the role acceptably, conceived the bright idea of having some pictures taken in the costume, the other day. So she went to the Western Costume Company and asked for a Peter Pan dress. She said she wanted it for two or three days.\n\n“Oh, but you can’t have it for more than twenty minutes!” the costume people told her. “You see at least half a dozen people rent that suit every day!”\n\nAnd when Miss Hulette donned the suit, she found it nearly worn out, what with taking in and letting out of the seams. She had something like the same experience at the library and bookstores, where not a copy of Peter Pan could she find for love or money.\n\nI had no idea that so many actresses wanted that role (so the later ballyhooed search for Scarlett O’Hara wasn’t the first). Kingsley said that Hollywood expected to hear author James M. Barrie’s decision about who would play Peter soon, and most people were guessing it would be May McAvoy or Viola Dana. By the end of the month, Kingsley had heard from ‘inside sources’ that it would be Bessie Love.\n\nThey were all wrong. Eventually Barrie chose newcomer Betty Bronson, who’d only been in a few movies as an extra before.\n\n*Ray’s actual sister Birdie seems to have had a nice, ordinary life. She married Glen Jones, a tile-setter, in 1906 and they lived in Los Angeles. They had a son named Ralph. They divorced in the 20’s, and by 1940 she’d moved back in with her father and brother and had became a saleslady.\n\n“Bandits Sympathetic,” San Pedro News Pilot, January 3, 1928.\n\n“Charles Ray’s ‘Brother’ Held,” Los Angeles Times, August 6, 1927.\n\n“Jail Term for Man Posing as Ray’s Brother,” Los Angeles Times, August 9, 1927.\n\n“News From the Dailies,” Variety, August 26, 1925, p. 12.\n\n“Posing as Charles Ray’s Brother,” Moving Picture World, August 20, 1927, p. 515.\n\n“Terry, Marrying Fakir, Looks Set for Term,” Variety, May 1, 1929, p. 52.\n\n“Two Held on Charges of Posing as Kin to Actors,” Santa Ana Register, August 6, 1927.\n\n“Warning to Exhibitors,” Film Daily, May 18, 1926, p. 4.\n\nOne hundred years ago this month, Grace Kingsley heard about another hardy soul filming in Alaska, joining the parade that included Norman Dawn in 1922 and Lewis Moomaw in 1923 (who knew it was such a trend?):\n\nAlfred Jacquemin, the intrepid cameraman, who rescued the balloonists on Hudson Bay shores in 1920, and who is now in Alaska, has cabled his manager here that he has secured moving pictures of the Major Martin trail, and is now on his way to the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes.\n\nJacquemin certainly had an attentive manager, who thought to tell Grace Kingsley about his client’s adventures. More details about the trip appeared in the Seward Daily Gateway. He was part of a group of sportsmen led by big game hunter Edward D. Jones, who in 1920 had headed up another expedition to Alaska sponsored by the Southwest Museum of Los Angeles to collect specimens. As of May 10th they were leaving for Unga, Sand Point and other far westward destinations on a steamer called Princess Pat. Most of them were there to kill animals, but Jacquemin and his assistant Gus Peterson were working for the Balmac Educational Film Service,* and they planned to shoot a five reel feature including all of the boat trip, the scenery, and the big game animals of the Kenal Peninsula and Aleutians. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find any evidence that the movie was completed, and the footage seems to be lost.\n\nThis trip was a short bit of Jacquemin’s long and varied career as a cameraman. Alfred Leon Jacquemin was born in Cardiff, Wales on May 25, 1886 to French parents, Auguste and Jeanne Landry Jacquemin. They moved back to France, and he married Lucienne Barbier on April 28, 1908. In his later interviews he said he worked for Gaumont in Paris for nine years. He served France in World War 1; most articles said he shot films for the government, but one said he served with the artillery (he could very well have done both).\n\nHe and his second wife Agnes moved to Canada in 1919. In January 1920 he was a cameraman for the Metropolitan Motion Picture Company in Detroit, Michigan, but by December he was working for the Aero Film Service of Toronto. That’s how he became part of the team that went looking for the balloonists mentioned in Kingsley’s story. Accounts of that story differed, but the Seward Daily Gateway had the most complete version of his part in it:\n\nMr. Jacquemin is a cameraman of national importance, having composed part of the party who went to the rescue of the ill-fated army balloonists who sailed from Rockaway, and fell in the Canadian woods in Ontario. Mr. Jacquemin travelled about 80 miles by dog sled to get pictures of the rescued balloonists and was one of the first services to be released following the tragic event.\n\nIt turns out they were right about his national importance, but it was to be Canadian importance. Before that happened, in June 1921 when Canada held their census he and his wife were living in Toronto, but he was unemployed. It looks like he decided to try his luck in the United States again in early 1923, and in 1925 he was hired by the Christie Company. He stayed there for two years, shooting short comedies like Dummy Love with Bobby Vernon and Sailor Beware with Vera Steadman, as well as the feature The Nervous Wreak. He even filed a Declaration of Intent to become a naturalized United State citizen on April 8, 1925, but he didn’t go through with it.\n\nIn 1927 he was hired by the Associated Screen News of Canada and he and Agnes moved to Montreal. ASN was the largest private production company in Canada from 1921 to 1958; they made most of the newsreels and commissioned industrial films produced in the country. Working with director Gordon Sparling, Jacquemin shot many Canadian Cameos, which was a series of 10 minute long theatrically-released films about everyday Canadian life and people, as well as its history. He helped to preserve a record of what Canada was like, which was certainly of national importance! Highlights of his career included Rhapsody in Two Languages (1934), a portrait of 24 hours in Montreal in the style of Berlin: Symphony of a Great City (1927) and Royal Banners Over Ottawa (1939) the only color film of the King George and Queen Mary’s last trip to Canada. He also shot plenty of more quotidian subjects, like The Miracle of the Locomotive (1928) about how a train is built and Front of Steel (1940), about the value of steel workers in wartime.\n\nRoyal Banners Over Ottawa (1939)\n\nAs of the 1931 census he and Agnes were living in Montreal, but on June 16, 1934 he married Eva Brabant Paradis. I can’t find anything that says what happened: Canada really needs to digitize more of their newspapers and vital records!\n\nIn recognition of his importance, in 1944 he was invited to join the American Society of Cinematographers (Canada didn’t get their own society until 1957). Their article about him still mentioned his 1924 trip to Alaska. They also told about his work on The Thousand Days, a review of the first three years of World War 2.\n\nThe last credit I can find for him is for Royal Welcome (1951), which was about then-Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip’s first visit to Canada. Jacquemin was the only cameraman allowed to travel on board the royal yacht Britannia on that trip.\n\nAfter 1951, I could find nothing more about him. When Eva Jacquemin died in 1968 after a long illness, she was his widow.\n\nNonfiction cameramen should be remembered, too! Happily, the Canadian Educational, Sponsored, and Industrial Film Project is contributing to that: his longest, but still incomplete, filmography is available on their site.\n\n* The Balmac Educational Film Company aspired to make educational films for schools and churches, and by 1923 had complete four shorts, including The Land of Everlasting Snow and From Forest to Mill. Their production manager was Capt. M. McKenzie, and it was headquartered in San Anselmo, CA. After this, they completely disappeared.\n\n“Capt. M.

She had just finished up a five-year long contract with Christie Comedies, and she was trying something new: live theater. However, she wasn’t deserting comedy: she was starring in a farce with music called The Morning After by C.A. Newton. She told Kingsley that making comedy shorts had turned her into something of a menace:\n\nSee the author and director over there talking seriously about the play? I’m just dying to go and pour a bucket of water over them to start things going. That’s what they do in a comedy.\n\nWhy, we screen comediennes aren’t safe to be left at large! I can’t even see a man cranking a car in the street without wanting to push him over on his face, and when a painter at our house was climbing a ladder this morning I could just see him dangling and kicking if I pulled the ladder out from under him.\n\nNobody else has mentioned this side effect of comedy stardom. She also talked about the difference between the kinds of acting: she found that rehearsing for the stage was much slower than making movies, and there was too much standing still and delivering your lines. She said:\n\nOn the screen you are glancing at ten places and jumping a wall to get your message across. If only they’d let me do a couple of flip-flops in the middle of my lines I’d be happy.\n\nIt seems like you can take the woman out of slapstick but you can’t take the slapstick out of the woman. Anna Inez Williams* was born on June 26, 1899 in Fort Worth, Texas, joining three brothers and a sister. Their father Thomas Williams was a blacksmith and mother Lussie Percifield Williams looked after their home. Her parents got divorced in the early 1900’s and Lussie went to work in an overall factory.\n\nIn 1920 Devore told film writer Hazel Shelley about her early years and how she broke into the entertainment industry. When she was 11, her mother decided to leave Texas and take her to Los Angeles for her health (the older kids had already left home). Devore sang at school and in her church choir, discovering she had a big voice in a tiny body. She “caught career fever” and after school every afternoon she sang and danced in amateur shows. To hide from her mother, she needed a fake name, so she picked Dorothy from Robert W. Chambers horror books and Devore from Snappy Stories magazine. She didn’t tell her mother until she got a job singing and dancing at a popular Los Angeles café, Levy’s. She said this led to being hired by the Orpheum vaudeville circuit, which planned to bill her as “The Miniature Pocket-Edition Sophie Tucker.” Instead of touring, she was hired by comedy team Eddie Lyons and Lee Moran in 1918 and broke into the movies.**\n\nShe usually played one of the team’s wife or girlfriend. Her film debut was in The House Cleaning Horrors (1918), in which she was Eddie Lyons’ wife. They hire Lee Moran to paper their walls, and messiness ensues.\n\nShe made twelve shorts with them. Moving Picture Weekly described the final one, Marry My Wife. She played Edith, who was engaged to Eddie, but she refuses to marry him because married couple Lee and Lucy are quarreling, which makes marriage look like a bad idea. Then there are misunderstandings and jealousy, but both partners end up with their original significant others.\n\nLater that year she was hired by the Christie Company. During her five-year contract there she usually played a daring young woman who gets herself into and out of trouble. Grace Kingsley liked them; in January 1924 she said that Navy Blues was an “an oasis in the great laughless Sahara of ‘super specials’” and a “bright little laugh-pager.” The plot involved Devore disguising herself as a sailor to accompany her groom on his ship and Kingsley called her “that sprite-like vivaciously illustrative and wholly clever little elf of a comedienne.”\n\nIn April 1924 Kingsley had reported that Devore had finished her contract with Christie and she planned to freelance, because she wanted to “have a chance at something besides the black-and-blue drama.” She said she hoped to be a real actress. Back in January, Kingsley had predicted this would happen and said, “but in the meantime she remains to charm and soothe the eye and delight the senses… May she never be wasted in the tear-teasers!”\n\nHowever, instead of going right to another movie company, she decided to try something new: the legitimate stage. Kingsley’s interview with her ran just before The Morning After opened at the Mason Theater. L.A. Times entertainment writer Kenneth Taylor reviewed the play and he thought she was the best thing about it, adding:\n\nwe may soon be able to count this young comedienne as one of our foremost stage personalities…It is Miss Devore who saves the show when the action lags, or the situations become too obvious.\n\nHe really didn’t like the rest of it, and thought the story of interwoven mistaken identities was the type found in the “cheaper burlesque houses.” He recounted the plot:\n\nThe heroine’s girlfriend, a widow, agrees to marry her dead husband’s brother, whom she has never seen. Her father-in-law arrives with the young man as the heroine arrives with a fast boy friend, the aftermath of a party the night before. To avoid creating an unfavorable impression, the fast boy friend is introduced as the heroine’s husband about the same time the heroine is meeting, falling in love, and marrying the young man intended for the widow.\n\nIt doesn’t sound like a lost gem! Taylor concluded that three or four re-writings and some actual directing were needed. He wasn’t the only one to pan it; Variety agreed that it had “a most conventional skein for a plot and is deluged with motion picture ‘hoke,’ gags and situations, besides being devoid of any human appeal.” Their reviewer thought that Devore tried hard to put it over, but thought she’d be “seen to better advantage if placed within a comedy talking and singing vaudeville turn.” Nevertheless, he found her voice pleasant and her singing soothing.\n\nEven though it seems she wasn’t the problem with the play, Devore decided to return to the movies. She made one film, The Tomboy, for the Mission Film Corporation, then she got her wish to be a dramatic actress, signing a contract to star in features for Warner Bros.\n\nHowever, that didn’t work out the way she had hoped it would. She was already complaining about the roles she got there in 1925 when she was interviewed by Doris Denbo for Picture-Play Magazine. She said: “Here I am seriously playing just the sort of ingénue roles that I used to burlesque. I have no sympathy with such characters.”\n\nSo it wasn’t too much of a surprise that in 1927 she returned to making comedy shorts for Educational Films. In a 1928 article about her Alma Talley of Picture Play Magazine wrote “she has the common sense to realize that she’s better off being herself in two-reel comedies, even with a few stray custard pies, than being the heroine of feature pictures.” Talley quoted Devore: “No one wants to see me cry, and I don’t blame them. I don’t care about seeing myself cry.” She also mentioned that her fan mail had dropped off when she tried serious roles.\n\nAt Educational, Devore had her own production company, Dorothy Devore Comedies. She stayed there until 1929. She starred in one more feature, Take the Heir (1930) with the small company Screen Story Syndicate, then stopped making films except for a short appearance in Miracle on Main Street (1939). It might not have been only the coming of sound that ended her career. In August 1928 she had brought a suit against the Kreliberg Pictures Corporation of New York for breach of contract, after they reneged on an agreement to pay her $1750 to play Kitty in The Little Girl God Forgot. She won the suit, but it could have frightened off other employers.\n\nShe kept busy after her film career. On December 18, 1925 she had married Albert Wylie Mather, the managing director of Consolidated Amusements which ran several movie theaters in Honolulu, Hawaii. He worked in Hollywood for awhile—the 1928 interview mentioned that Mather was the new general manager of James Cruze’s film unit, and he was on a leave of absence from his work in Hawaii. After she quit films they moved back there. She divorced him on grounds of cruelty in August 1933. At first they kept their disagreements out of the paper, but in 1935 he sued her to get the divorce settlement back, demanding the return of $100,000 worth of cash, stocks, and real estate. During their court testimony they both accused each other of having affairs. She won, but six months later she had to ask the court enjoin him from continuing to attempt to get the property back.\n\nShe didn’t marry again. In the 1940’s she owned a dress shop in Hollywood, and only turned up in the Times when she got arrested for drunk driving after a minor accident in 1946. She paid a $50 fine after pleading guilty. In 1966 she moved into the Motion Picture Home in Woodland Hills after two strokes, and in 1973 she told an interviewer “I am very contented, very happy here.” She spent most of her time sewing. She died on September 10, 1976.\n\nIf you’d like to see one of her shorts, Niles Film Museum has made Kidding Katie available online.\n\n*This is a picky detail, of interest only to other researchers. Despite what some other sources say, I think Devore’s birth name was Anna, not Alma. Not only was it what she told Shelley in 1920 for Motion Picture Classic, but in her first appearance in the 1900 census records she’s called Annie Inez Williams, and on a boat passenger list from Hawaii in 1922 she called herself Anna. In 1946 she told the court that her legal name was Anna. Finally, when Anthony Slide spoke to her in 1971, she told him her name had been Anna.\n\nI can understand how earlier researchers might have been confused, because in January 1900 another little girl named Alma Inez Williams was born in Texas to David and Georgia Williams. She lived her life in Texas. Unfortunately, this is a problem in all kinds of history writing, not just film history: a “fact” gets repeated, and nobody double-checks.\n\n**In later interviews, she said she had done a vaudeville tour, but her earliest interview was probably more truthful. Before she was hired by Lyons and Moran, the only mention in the entertainment press of a Dorothy Devore was a wrestler.\n\n“Actress Battles Former Husband’s Suit,” Los Angeles Times, February 19, 1935.\n\n“’Bubbly’ Jag Costs Actress $25 Per Pint,” Los Angeles Times, December 27, 1946.\n\nDoris Denbo, “The Versatile Dorothy Devore,” Picture-Play Magazine, August 1925, p. 83.\n\n“Devore Suit Goes Over for Trial,” Los Angeles Times, August 14, 1928.\n\n“Dorothy Devore Booked as Drunk,” Los Angeles Times, December 26, 1946.\n\n“Dorothy Devore in Plea to Have Ex-Mate Cited,” Los Angeles Times, July 30, 1935.\n\nJimmy Fidler, “In Hollywood,” Los Angeles Times, January 25, 1942.\n\n“Film Queen Unaware of Nuptial Day,” Los Angeles Times, December 19, 1925.\n\nGrace Kingsley, “Flashes: Comedy Whirls Along,” Los Angeles Times, January 28, 1924.\n\nGrace Kingsley, “Flashes: Will Free Lance,” Los Angeles Times, April 17, 1924.\n\n“Marry My Wife,” Moving Picture Weekly, January 25, 1919, p. 43.\n\n“Miss Devore Wins Battle,” Los Angeles Times, February 28, 1935.\n\n“Morning After Tame,” Variety, May 21, 1924, p. 14.\n\n“One Man’s Dream Became Home for Actors,” Hartford Current, August 18, 1973.\n\nHazel Shelley, “The Diminutive Dorothy Devore,” Motion Picture Classic, December 1920, pp. 34-5, 71.\n\nAnthony Slide, Silent Players, Lexington, KY: University Press of Kentucky, 2002.\n\n“Suit to get Salary Won by Actress,” Los Angeles Times, August 16, 1928.\n\nAlma Talley, “A Twinkling, Twinkling Little Star,” Picture Player Magazine, February 1928, pp.23-24, 112.\n\nKenneth Taylor, “Dorothy Devore in Stage Debut,” Los Angeles Times, May 20, 1924.\n\nOne hundred years ago this month, Grace Kingsley reported on a movie that lots of people were looking forward to:\n\n“Charlie Chaplin is a busy man these days. The High Sierras, Mt. Summit* to be exact, is the scene of his labors. Here the comedian is reproducing in comic version the famous Alaskan gold rush of other days. Even Chilkoot Pass has been reproduced. And the rugged camp of the pioneers is there, cluttering the base of the precipitous cliffs. A pathway, cut through the snow 2300 feet long, rising up to the top of Mt. Summit, passes up a narrow defile through the rocks, and was only made possible by snowdrifts banked against the mountain side.\n\nThe camp was erected and the pass cut through in less than one week. Special agents of the Southern Pacific Railroad mobilized an army of 1000 men and by special trains to the pass, also a special train of dining cars was brought from Oakland for the feeding of these modern sourdoughs.\n\nChaplin himself, in the role of director-general, was here, there, and everywhere, giving instructions, leading the men, and on occasions, mixing with the mob in scenes, spurring them on. It was one of the most successfully handled mobs ever assembled before a movie camera, according to reports, and many spectacular scenes were filmed.\n\nIt seems that thrills are to mingle with the comedy and scenes of terrific realism, depicting the hardships endured by the pioneer gold seekers who surmounted the mountains which blocked their pathway in that mad rush for gold.\n\nKingsley also mentioned that that Chaplin was to play a sourdough and the film would be competed in the fall. Filmgoers had already been waiting for quite a while; his most recent feature film was The Kid in 1921, but he had starred in three shorts since then, most recently The Pilgrim in 1923. He had also directed the drama A Woman of Paris (1923) in which he made a brief appearance. Still, for an audience that had been accustomed to seeing him in as many as 13 shorts a year, this was a long time.\n\nThey would have to wait even longer, partly due to Chaplin’s perfectionism but also due to what his biographer David Robinson called the distraction of domestic tribulations: he had an affair with his 16-year-old leading lady, Lita Grey, and she got pregnant, so he married her and replaced her in the film with Georgia Hale. They winded up not using most of the footage they shot on location and instead made the majority of the film on sets in his Hollywood studio.\n\nA year later, in April 1925, Kingsley was able to report on the movie’s progress. She ran into Chaplin at the Montmartre night club in Hollywood and he said he was just finishing up his new film, which he was going to call either The Gold Rush or The Lucky Strike. He told her:\n\nWell of course I can’t name my stories at once, because usually we don’t really get the story jelled until the last two months. That’s what happened with this one. Some people think if we name it Lucky Strike the fans might get it mixed with the cigarettes. So we don’t know. Anyhow, I’m a bit superstitious about using the word ‘lucky.’\n\nWe really think we have every sort of appeal in our picture. I think it will have historic value, for one thing, the Chilikoot Pass stuff is thrilling. We really underwent a lot of hardships making those scenes, for we were in fear of an avalanche every minute.\n\nEven Chaplin felt the need to emphasize the realism of his movies as other filmmakers did, which now seems extraordinary. Kingsley also mentioned another touch of authenticity: he looked shaggy because he’d been cutting his own hair, as his character would have needed to do.\n\nChaplin really was almost finished. He did decide to call it The Gold Rush, and it had its world premier two months later at Grauman’s Egyptian in Hollywood on June 26th. As usual, Kingsley didn’t get to review the film; her boss did. Now it’s called a masterpiece, but at the time Edwin Schallert wasn’t entirely sold on it. He wrote, “to say that the picture has the concentrated charm of one of his two-reelers would perhaps be rash.” He thought the narrative was rambling and the comedy and pathos weren’t woven together, making it episodic: “there are moments that are delicious, but there are others that are inclined to be a trifle forced.” However, the audience at the premier “evidenced an immensely enthusiastic appreciation for the film.”\n\nKingsley did get to go to Samuel Goldwyn’s premier party for the movie, and she reported on it in her new series, Stella the Star-Gazer, named for her fictional companion to Hollywood parties. ‘Stella’ had the time of her life; she said that she never wanted to go to another party again because “I’m sure there will never be another picture so good as The Gold Rush—and this party is just too glorious.” She reported that Mary Pickford wore an especially becoming evening gown and Douglas Fairbanks was so happy that the audience loved the film that he was “shaking hands delightedly with everybody.” As co-owners of the studio that was releasing it, United Artists, they must have been relieved that it looked like a hit.\n\nThe Gold Rush was a huge success. It played at the Egyptian Theater until November 1st, and only left because Sid Grauman had a previous commitment to open King Vidor’s The Big Parade there—the box office was still strong. So while it took much longer than the average film to make, it made more money. It has lasted much longer too–it still gets screened, and it was added to the Library of Congresses National Film Registry in 1992.\n\nThis month Kingsley saw a movie that was much less of a durable masterpiece, but it featured an early supporting role for an actress who is still famous. She said, “Poisoned Paradise isn’t very much poisoned; it is just a mild little dose of bromide.” Set in Monte Carlo (and she’d already had enough of that place), its theme was “the only way to beat the game is not to play it.”\n\nEven thought it was “commonplace claptrap all belonging to the serial age in picturedom,” she found a bright spot: “the sweet ingenue who goes to live in the house of the artist, yet without sin” was played by “Clara Bow, that marvelous child, is a joy every moment. She is much more than the ingenue; she is human, and her vivid little face holds you every second.” Even though this was only her ninth film, she already stood out from the other actors, even in a small part.\n\nOther reviewers singled out her performance in Poisoned Paradise. Film Daily mentioned that she was the “most interesting cast member,” and Henriette Slone in Exhibitors’ Trade Review wrote:\n\nNothing but the highest praise can be accorded Clara Bow, who is not only extremely comely and winsome but remarkably convincing. Her performance both when she is at the heights of exaltation, and when she is cast into the depths of despair, is nothing short of inspired. There is every reason to suppose that she will become a great favorite in a short time.\n\nSlone was right. Clara Bow had won the Fame and Fortune Contest sponsored by Motion Picture Magazine in 1922 and she had appeared in small roles in films made in New York since then. Two years later she came to Hollywood, and in 1926 she became a star with her leading role in The Plastic Age. People still admire her work in It(1927) and Wings (1927). You can learn more about her at this profile from the Guardian.\n\n* The name of the mountain, Mt. Summit, was corrected in later publicity to Mt. Lincoln. Now the area is known as the Sugar Bowl. It’s near Truckee, California, close to the Nevada border.\n\nGrace Kingsley, “At the Gold Rush Party,” Los Angeles Times, July 22, 1925.\n\nGrace Kingsley, “Flashes: Chaplin Finishing,” Los Angeles Times, April 23, 1925.\n\n“The New Star,” Motion Picture Magazine, January 1922, p.55.\n\n“One More Week for Gold Rush,” Los Angeles Times, October 23, 1925.\n\n“Poisoned Paradise,” Film Daily, March 2, 1924, p. 9.\n\nEdwin Schallert, “Epic Comedy on the Screen,” Los Angeles Times, June 27, 1925.\n\nHenriette Slone, “Thrills Aplenty in Monte Carlo Story,” Exhibitors’ Trade Review, March 15, 1924, p. 27.\n\nOne hundred years ago this month. Grace Kingsley had noticed a dreadful trend: fewer theaters in Los Angeles had been showing comedy shorts before feature films, replacing them with higher-brow offerings. However, exhibitors had recently started to bring them back to their bills. Therefore, the companies headed by Mack Sennett, Hal Roach and Jack White were all busier than ever, and the Christie organization even had plans to increase their output; they had “gradually been enlarging our organization to take care of this increased production” according to Charles H. Christie, general manager.\n\nShe was able to tell her readers that “those who have been worrying for fear there will be a dearth of short comedies this year from the Christie organization may now go about their business reassured,” and they could look forward to plenty of two-reelers starring Neal Burns, Bobby Vernon, Jimmy Adams, Dorothy Devore, Priscilla Bonner and Walter Hiers. She was only half-joking–a comedy fan like herself would have been very happy to hear this news. I wrote about the Christie Company earlier.\n\nI was surprised to read that leaving comedies off of bills had even been a trend. Who doesn’t like them? So I did unscientific survey of the newspaper ads and ‘coming attractions’ articles in the Times for the first three months of 1924 and found out that she was right (I should have never doubted her!). At first glance it looked like the chief villain was none other than Sid Grauman. However, in July 1923 Grauman had announced plans to sell his three downtown theaters (the Rialto, the Million Dollar, and the Metropolitan) to Paramount Studios. He planned to remain in charge of them for six months. So this ghastly decision was the new management’s fault.\n\nIn the first week of January, none of the three movie palaces that Paramount controlled had comedy shorts on their bills. Instead they had two live acts: the Rialto featured a set with baritone George Dewey Washington along with Big Brother and the Metropolitan had the Three Little Maids dance act to accompany Woman to Woman. Meanwhile, at the Million Dollar, Norma Talmadge’s Ashes of Vengeance was such a strong draw (and long movie—120 minutes) that nothing else of the program was mentioned. The two theaters Grauman did still manage had live prologues: at the Egyptian “A Night in Pharaoh’s Palace” (100 artists on the stage!) playing with The Ten Commandments, and at the Criterion “The Bells of Notre Dame” appeared with The Hunchback of Notre Dame.\n\nThese five theaters weren’t the only ones contributing to this distressing trend; the competition at Lowe’s State Theater was running a ballet before Flaming Youth. Additionally, just like the Million Dollar, some of the smaller (under 1000 seat) theaters like the Alhambra, Talley’s Broadway, and Miller’s only listed the features they were running and didn’t mention if there was anything else on the bill.\n\nHowever, three of the theaters in town did feature comedy shorts: Hal Roach’s Dippity-Do-Dad played with Flaming Passion at the California, Harry Langdon’s Picking Peaches appeared with The Virginian at the Mission and Stan Laurel in The Soilers could be found with Defying Destiny at Clune’s Broadway. However, that wasn’t nearly enough: a hard-working journalist like Kingsley needed her laughs!\n\nThe drought continued in the first week of February, with funny two-reelers starring Lloyd Hamilton, Will Rogers, and Bull Montana livening up the bills at only three theaters again. Four of the other big theaters had prologues and the fifth, the Metropolitan, featured “juvenile soloist” Anna Chang. The smaller theaters still only mentioned the features they were playing.\n\nBy the first week of March, Kingsley noticed that the situation had improved. She wrote, “not all the solemn trash of the melodramas, not all the high-brow music, can take the place of the laugh lurers, according to local exhibitors who are slowly coming back to the placing of comedies on their bills.” It wasn’t “exhibitors,” it was just the one–the new management at Grauman’s former theaters had come to their senses. They added two-reel comedies back onto their bills, along with live shows. At his Metropolitan, they ran Mack Sennett’s The Hollywood Kid along with a prologue called “Carnival Night in Venice” before the William S. Hart film Singer Jim McKee. At the Rialto they had another Sennett, One Spooky Night, with a musical program before Under the Red Robe. Meanwhile, at the Million Dollar, Clyde Cook in The Broncho Express played alongside a prologue called “The Wolves of Montmartre,” to go with Gloria Swanson’s Paris-set The Humming Bird.\n\nHowever, Grauman himself didn’t mess with the successful bills at the two theaters he still managed—the comedy-free programs with The Ten Commandments (in its fifteenth week!) and Scarmouche (sixth week) stayed the same.\n\nThe Lowe’s State theater also brought back comedy, presenting a Mermaid Comedy along with a Fanchon and Marco prologue called “Society” before Colleen Moore’s Painted People. Meanwhile, the California continued not to run prologues and played an Our Gang short called Back Stage along with Douglas Maclean in The Yankee Consul. The Broadway, the Mission, and the smaller theaters still only mentioned their feature films.\n\nIt’s remarkable just how much entertainment the audience got in a night at the movies then. Short comedies stayed on most movie bills until the rise of double features in the 1930’s; Educational Films, Vitagraph and Hal Roach stopped making them in 1938 but Columbia and RKO continued producing them until the 1950’s.\n\nGrace Kingsley really needed some funny two-reelers to help her get through the dire dramas she was sitting through this month. When she reviewed Lilies of the Field (a divorce melodrama) she wrote:\n\nI’m beginning to think that we Americans are supreme comedy makers and rotten drama producers, at least on the screen. Our drama is timid, self-conscious, superficial. It seems to be always about the same old stuff, with neither depth nor sincerity, but with writers and directors trying to blind audiences with a wealth of detail, a complication of extraneous issues.\n\nBeing a film critic could really be a drag. Later in the month, Kingsley found another way to get through a turkey when she went to see Women Who Give: listening to Winifred Westover Hart snark about it. In her review Kingsley summed up the plot: “as soon as you see that fishing village, you know there are going to be a drowned only-son-of-a-widow, a wronged girl, and a terrific storm at sea,” then reported on what Hart exclaimed during the movie, like “Why did they let these cod play so big a part? They haven’t any experience! Let the poor fish stay in the ocean and do their stuff!” The actress also suggested taking Mother’s Seasick Pills, to deal with the mal-de-mer caused by so many tippy storm scenes in the ocean.\n\nThey made their own fun. I was happy to learn that after her dreadful marriage to William S. Hart, Winifred Westover Hart’s life wasn’t endless misery. She still got to go to the movies and complain about the bad bits.\n\nMany thanks to Paul R. Spitzzeri at the Homestead Blog, who wrote about the Grauman Theater Magazine. I had no idea that Grauman had divested himself of his downtown theaters, and I would have made an embarassing mistake if I hadn’t read his post!\n\n“Grauman Gives Options on Theaters to Paramount,” Los Angeles Times, July 14, 1923.\n\nOne hundred years ago this month, Grace Kingsley noticed another trend in the movies that annoyed her: leading men weren’t getting to commit enough violence:\n\nWhere is the strong and handsome chap who used to kill the main villain and a couple of sub-villains before breakfast? We look for him in vain. It’s pretty soft for the handsome hero, these days! For all he has to do is stand around all duded up and marry the gell.\n\nAll his conflict is mental. It doesn’t disturb a wave of his marcel. You know he is suffering because the subtitles tell you so, and you see him in a close-up every few minutes staring straight ahead of him, as though he was trying to remember what it was he promised to bring home to the mater from the 5-and-10-cent store. All his courage is moral courage. He can look Nita Naldi straight in the eye-or anywhere-and let her know that he is not for such as she. Yes, he’s 100 per cent pure.\n\nHappily for her, violence hadn’t been eliminated, it had just been shifted and supporting actors like Ernest Torrence and Lon Chaney got to be tough: “For out-and-out bravery and he-man helling, the character man is now the big biff boy. Rugged and mature he is, this cinema crime crusher.” That doesn’t seem so terrible, especially for the actor who got to have meatier parts. She said: “he seldom marries the girl; he doesn’t get rich. What does he get? Well, around $1500 a week.” So even though they didn’t get top billing, she thought they were happy enough.\n\nWhile this wasn’t the full-blown crisis of masculinity trend that seems to come up every few years in pop culture, Kingsley still preferred the good old days:\n\nBill Hart was the come-on he-hero of the screen. Bill used to put the sin in cinema in the first three reels, and then yank the raw out of wrong in the last two. When Bill stopped shooting and began working his jaws with emotion, you always knew he was going to reform, and you went to sleep if you wanted to.\n\nEvery now and then she wrote a trend piece—the many pages of the Sunday edition didn’t fill themselves, after all. Some trends stuck around, like when she noticed actresses displaying more skin in An Epidemic of Epidermis. However, this one did not and he-man leading men were not really in danger of disappearing forever. Some of 1924’s top grossing films included Thief of Bagdad with Douglas Fairbanks and The Sea Hawk with Milton Sills; both of their characters did plenty of fighting. This kind of article is the bread-and-butter of film writing. A modern well-prepared pundit could look at Kingsley’s work for ideas when the next inevitable change comes, say when Marvel movies featuring the more muscle-bound superheroes start earning less money.\n\nThis month Kingsley included a much more rare kind of news item for her: she told how a cameraman solved a technical problem:\n\nThe blondes needn’t worry so much about the photographing of their eyes any more. A means has been discovered for turning blue eyes dark on the screen. The discovery is all in honor of Laura LaPlante, who is a great little actress, say Universal people, but whose blue eyes just couldn’t be made to behave. Jack Rose, cameraman for Robert Hill, turned the trick.\n\nRose attached a ray screen [filter] of delicately tinted yellowish orange hue to the lens of his camera, which produced the desired effect. Miss LaPlante’s blue eyes photographed dark and her blond hair still photographed light.”\n\nThis was a problem when photographing all blue-eyed actors, because the orthochromatic film stock they were using at the time distorted colors. Blue barely showed up at all on it. Early cinematographers found ways to work around that with filters, as Rose did, or with a large piece of black cloth that framed the lens. Invented by James Wong Howe, the black reflected off blue eyes and darkened their appearance on film.\n\nWhile Jackson Rose did come up with many solutions to cinematography problems (as well as compiling the first nine editions of the American Society of Cinematographers Handbook), this wasn’t one of them. ‘Ray screens’ aka filters had been used in still and moving picture photography for many years. Still, it was nice to see his name in the paper and I think he deserves to be remembered more (of course I do, I wrote a short biography of him).\n\nC.H.

Reynolds, “The Common Sense of the Ray Screen,” Amateur Photographer’s Weekly, September 13, 1912, pp. 193-4.\n\nOne hundred years ago this month, Grace Kingsley heard about the travails of being an actress:\n\n“Say,” declared Louise Fazenda to me the other day, as we sat on the edge of the set where they were making The Galloping Fish, out at the Ince studios, “every time I get a call nowadays, I expect to support a horse or double for a trained ant-eater!”\n\nSo much Hollywood glamour! They went on to have a nice gossipy chat about her co-stars, and Fazenda spilled the tea on one from Fish in particular:\n\nBut Ethel the alligator! There’s the animal I had no use for…If there is anything calculated to make a person jumpy, it is having a large, husky alligator, whose dinner time is due any minute, fix you with his cold, calculating eye—an eye that may light up at any minute with enthusiasm for your contours. Nobody wants to be referred to as ‘the alligator’s tenderloin!’\n\nThat sounds utterly reasonable. She mentioned that Ethel got loose for a few days, and the cast and crew had to avoid visiting the river. Making comedies in the early days of the movies required so much grit. A few days later, Kingsley reported that even at the studio, Fazenda got to display her fortitude: one day she dropped a bottle on her foot, puncturing her instep, but after first aid “the comedienne, who laughed it off, resumed her work within half an hour or so.” Kingsley had great sympathy for comedians; she remarked. “As for the comedies, they are extra hazardous. When one is a perfect scream, you can bet somebody broke a leg.”\n\nDuring her interview, Fazenda had much nicer things to say about one of her other animal co-stars, when she talked about Freddie, called Bubbles in the film:\n\n“He’s a dear seal,” explained Louise, “nipped me once or twice, but didn’t mean a thing by it…Bubbles didn’t think so much of the desert. He seemed to say ‘What’s the idea?’ I like a place where I can flip a mean flapper!”\n\nShe had a point: seals don’t belong in Yuma, Arizona, with an average temperature in the eighties and nineties when they were shooting in October and November. Other outlets reported on what Fazenda had to do to get along with him. Camera said that while she dotes on Freddie, “the bond of sympathy has been strengthened since Louise never omits keeping herself well smeared with fish.” They said it was inspirational to him. An L.A. Times article contradicted that, saying that she supplied him with his favorite fish, which makes more sense. Nevertheless, making comedies was hard, unenviable work!\n\nBefore the fish solution, it seems that they hadn’t been getting along so well. In November, Kingsley had reported that Fazenda a different attitude towards the bites she’d gotten: “He is too fresh for anything. He has nipped me a couple of times and I have told him distinctly that if he doesn’t look out—well, I need a new fur coat this winter, and seals aren’t such hard animals to train!”\n\nBiting animals weren’t the only difficulty on this shoot; even though Fazenda said it cheerfully, she mentioned other troubles:\n\nThere were plenty of bathrooms, and this was a comfort as, when it wasn’t rainy, it was hot and dusty, and on returning home at night we had fairly to blast the soil off ourselves. My hands and face cracked till I looked like the alligator.\n\nEven with all the discomfort, she concluded, “but after all, who would miss a location trip? It is certainly something to talk about in the long winter evenings.” She was a good sport.\n\nFazenda wrote more details about the shoot in a letter to Myrtle Gebhart from the Yuma location published in Picture Play Magazine, beginning with “Myrtle, you never saw so much dirt in your life.” She wrote about how they coped with another problem: boredom. One of her human co-stars, Truly Shattuck, had the foresight to bring along a lot of hankies that need to be hem-stitched, so they had something to do while waiting—it kept them good-humored. Oh, and she almost drowned in the flood scene. Yikes!\n\nShe told Gebhart about how Freddie’s trainer tried “to sort of compensate him for the dreadful experiences he is undergoing on this location trip” sent to Santa Barbara for another seal to keep him company. She wrote:\n\n“We all have hopes that love will stir his bachelor heart. When I last saw him he was flapping around in front of her juggling a ball on his nose—which may be one way of winning a wife.”\n\nThe end results of all this hardship and hard work were pretty good, but alas for Miss Fazenda, like many other past and future animal stars, Freddie stole the show. The Galloping Fish opened in Manhattan in mid-April 1924 and Helen Klumph, the L.A. Times’ New York correspondent, said “the seal who plays the title role has the naivete of an ingenue star combined with sleek, debonair charm of a Lew Cody. And his emotional facility!” She enjoyed the whole movie and said, “the delicious humor of The Galloping Fish is more than anyone has a right to expect.”\n\nExhibitors’ Herald also admired his performance too, saying “Freddie the seal was a real surprise as a motion picture actor and the way he ambled in and out of cabs, ran up and down stairs and followed Chaplin about was a revelation.” Beatrice Barrett in Moving Picture World agreed that he was the best comedian in the picture and said “it is refreshing and diverting because you don’t have any idea what is going to happen next, and it is all good clean fun.”\n\nWhen it opened in at the Rialto Los Angeles on June 4th the Times’ Kenneth Taylor felt it was a bit overhyped, saying “you may possibly be a trifle disappointed in The Galloping Fish, but if you are it will purely be a case of too much anticipation… it merely ranks high among the humorous pictures of the year, and is entertaining generally.” He agreed with the earlier reports about the scene-stealer:\n\n“The fame of Freddie, the fish, has preceded him, you see. And while the cast included a quartet of well-known funsters the picture would be as nothing without the fish. There’s a laugh in every finny move he makes.”\n\nIt had a very good run in Los Angeles, playing for nearly five weeks, which was a record for the Rialto. The Galloping Fish doesn’t seem to be available on DVD or streaming, but it’s been preserved at archives in Warsaw and Milan.\n\nNaturally, Freddie was a big part of the publicity for the film. At the time he was eight years old and a vaudeville veteran. He made personal appearances at every performance at the Rialto, and the Times reported: “Meeting his film fans ‘face to face’ has added greatly to the popularity of this new star, for Freddie is never temperamental and always does just the right thing to win friends.”\n\nFreddie was in a few more movies, including a two-reeler directed by Henry Lehrman called Sweet Papa(1924) and Dizzy Daisy (1925), a short that re-teamed him with Fazenda.\n\nHaving a few movies with a scene-stealing seal didn’t harm Fazenda’s job prospects. The Galloping Fish came out at roughly the mid-point of her long and varied career. She started out in comedy shorts at Sennett then she made some feature-length dramas like The Gold Diggers (1923) and Westerns like The Old Fool (1923). Fish was a return to comedy for her, and she continued to appear in all sorts of films for nearly two more decades. Having made excellent investments and marrying producer Hal B. Wallis (Adventures of Robin Hood 1938, Casablanca,1942), she retired in 1939 to raise their son and do charitable work. If her letter to Gebhart is any indication, I’m sorry that she didn’t write an autobiography—she was a lively writer! If you’d like to know more, Lea Stans has an article about her at Silent-ology.\n\nBeatrice Barrett, “The Galloping Fish,” Moving Picture World, March 22, 1924, p. 304.\n\nLouise Fazenda and Myrtle Gebhart, “A Letter from Location,” Picture-Play Magazine, April 1924, pp.65, 109.\n\n“Galloping Fish Heading Fun Bill,” Los Angeles Times, June 23, 1924.\n\nGrace Kingsley, “Flashes,” Los Angeles Times, November 7, 1923.\n\nHelen Klumph, “Where are Imitators?” Los Angeles Times, April 20, 1924.\n\n“Louise Has Birthday,” Los Angeles Times, June 17, 1924.\n\n“Louise Infatuated with Bubbles,” Camera, January 12, 1924, p.13.\n\n“Poor Fish Fell Hard for Louise,” Los Angeles Times, June 8, 1924.\n\n“Reviews,” Exhibitors’ Herald, March 29, 1924, p. 53.\n\nKenneth Taylor, “Bizarre, Hectic and Grotesque Animal Actors to Foremost Rank,” Los Angeles Times, January 20, 1924.\n\nKenneth Taylor, “Galloping Fish Finny and Funny,” Los Angeles Times, June 5, 1924.\n\nOne hundred years ago this month, Grace Kingsley interviewed writer/director Lewis H. Moomaw, who was in town to preview his film, Chechakos*. Named after the indigenous people’s word for newcomers, it was the first feature film shot entirely in Alaska, and Kingsley’s description includes why people are still interested in the movie:\n\nIf you want to see the genuine Alaska, several thousand square miles of it, you may do so in Chechakos…Chechakos promises a wide appeal, inasmuch as it not only has a thrilling story, but it also reveals the actual life, industries, pleasures, occupations, beauties and resources of this great Territory.\n\nNine months were spent in making the picture, while some two years were spent beforehand in preparation and research, location hunting, and engaging the aid of various government officials and chambers of commerce. Remote places in Alaska, like the Childs Glacier, on which human beings never before had ventured, were photographed. The pictures were taken within 300 yards of where the glacier was breaking up and pouring over a precipice.\n\nAfter the box-office success of Nanook of the North, it made sense that someone would want to capitalize on audience’s interest in the North with a fiction film. Chechakos told the story of Baby Ruth, who is saved by two Alaskans, Dexter and Riley, after a boiler explosion on a steamer. Her mother, believing that her child drowned, becomes a singer in a gambling house. Years later Ruth’s rescuers learn where her mother is and they visit to plan a reunion. The evil gambling boss ties Dexter to a chair, sets the house on fire and runs away. Dexter and Riley escape and chase him to collapsing glacier, where the bad guy dies. Ruth and her mother are reunited, and she marries Dexter.\n\nMoomaw didn’t sell his film to a distributor on his trip to Los Angeles, so he went to New York City in January. There he sold it to Associated Exhibitors, a company that released independent productions including Harold Lloyd’s early features and Mabel Norman’s The Extra Girl.\n\nAssociated really worked hard to promote the film. Moving Picture World said that to lure the industry to a screening at the Ritz-Carton Hotel:\n\nthe wide-awake publicity department of Associated devised a clever and effective exploitation stunt. A messenger, garbed as an Alaskan miner and leading a genuine malamute dog, visited the offices of the press and scores of prominent exhibitors and presented them with an envelope which contained tickets for the showing, dancing and supper…Did this stunt prove effective? We’ll say so, for everyone along Film Row is now talking about The Chechakos.\n\nPerhaps film people were a bit less hard-bitten then, if a nice visit from a doggie could get them to a screening! When they arrived at the hotel on May 1st, they were greeted with an impressive show, according to Exhibitors’ Trade Review:\n\nThe staging at the Ritz-Carlton was masterly. One entered the grand ballroom reception foyer to be met by a weaving ray of multi-colored lights, all of a cold tone. Three beautiful white silk drops were hung at the stage end of the ballroom. Three flood-lights with specially painted lenses threw on these drops in varied colors scenes from the production. As the Paul Whiteman Orchestra started the house lights were slowly dimmed down and the lights on the drops intensified. The overture ended, a singer rendered the stirring Johnson number “The Mush-On.” Then the center curtain slowly parted and an introductory reel showed scenes of President Harding’s visit to Alaska and to the location of The Chechakos company. The final scene showed the company arriving on location in a government train. This shot dissolved into the main title of the feature.\n\nUnfortunately, the reviews that were the results of the screening were pretty bad. Adele Whitley Fletcher in Motion Picture Magazine had no patience with the movie:\n\n“We cannot, for the very life of us, understand why the producers of this picture went to such lengths in the name of such a cheap and melodramatic story…Nor are the characters portrayed by capable actors and actresses…However, we think the burden of the poor story would have been heavy, even for an exceptional cast.”\n\nShe did find some redeeming qualities: “the star of this production is the glacier formations, those walls of ice and snow, slow-moving, ever in the direction of some river or sea into which they crash, terrifying and awe-inspiring masses of white.”\n\nFilm Daily agreed with her: “it is to be regretted that the producer or director failed in developing the opportunity. This might easily have been a very big picture.” Furthermore, “the story needs a lot of editing to whip it into better shape and make it first-class in audience appeal.” However, they did think up one good way to sell it: they recommended showing it during the summer, because “this is one of the best snow pictures of the season.”\n\nGeorge Blaisdell in Exhibitors’ Trade Review was much more kind, but he might have been influenced by the multi-page ad for the film that ran in the same issue. He said:\n\nThe Chechakos is more than a motion picture and an interesting one at that. It is a most vivid record of the days of the Alaska gold rush in 1897 and 1898. But the historical phase of the subject is submerged in its genuinely dramatic quality and its remarkable series of massive scenic backgrounds.\n\nHe addressed the problem with the acting with some faint praise: “The players are new to the screen, but they are competent.”\n\nThe anonymous reviewer for the New York Times waited until it was playing at the Cameo Theater and then complained about it:\n\nWhile some of the scenes of snow and ice are of interest and the race between dog teams across the white desert is thrilling, the actual story of Chechakos is by no means a masterpiece. It is like a Bowery melodrama with arctic settings…It is merely an excuse to show some beautiful Alaskan snow scenes; perhaps if one can look upon it as a bloodthirsty melodrama of the snows, it may be mildly diverting.\n\nIt opened in Los Angeles on June 28th, but the L.A. Times didn’t review it. It had a respectable two-week run at the California, then it moved to a smaller theater, Miller’s. By late August it was playing in smaller markets like San Pedro, along with vaudeville acts. I couldn’t find box office figures, but it looks like it had an ordinary run and it continued to make money for a long time. It was still being shown in March 1926, as part of a kid’s show at the Strand Theater in Santa Rosa, California.\n\nIn 1923, Moomaw told Kingsley, “everybody in Alaska was much interested in the picture, and about 3000 Alaskans appear in it,” and people in Alaska are still interested in it. A copy found its way to the library at University of Alaska in Fairbanks and they restored it in 2000. In 2003 it was added to the Library of Congress’ National Film Registry, and you can see it on the National Film Preservation Foundation’s website.\n\nChechakos was the most enduring film by its director. Lewis H.** Moomaw was born in Baker, Oregon on May 5, 1889 and he grew up there. He told the story of how he got started in film to Grace Kingsley in 1925:\n\nIt was in 1907, and the sheriff of our town, Baker, Oregon, had been killed—dynamited at his home by some of his enemies. I had made myself a camera out of an old Edison motion-picture machine, which I afterward patented.*** I was going to high school, and the drama of the Sheriff’s death appealed to me. I thought I would make a movie of it! I got into the premises of the Sherriff’s home while the family was a church one Sunday morning, about a week after the Sherriff’s death, and managed a very good reproduction of the accident. I thought I had done a lot for art, but when the local acting Sherriff put on his uniform and came to high school to arrest me, the thing took on another aspect. It was ordered that the picture be burned. So I gave them the positive film. Dramatically it was hurled into the air-tight stove in the courtroom—and naturally the celluloid film exploded! That did give the simple village folk a thrill! However, I kept the negative, and I did afterward show the picture.\n\nYikes! I’m amazed he told that story about himself. Still in Baker, in 1908 he started a film production company, World Film Manufacturing, and they made comedies like The Amateur Bicyclist and The Man with a Big Mouth and dramas like A Desperate Chance.Later that year the company moved to Portland, but they went out of business in 1910 after a fire destroyed the studio.\n\nUndaunted, Moomaw started a new company in Portland, the American Lifeograph Company. They made films like the documentary Where Cowboy is King (1915). This lead to him getting a job in 1916 with the Burton Holmes Lecture Company and he shot films for their lectures and travelogues in Canada. In January 1917 he applied for a passport to visit Alaska, Canada, Fiji, New Zealand, Australia, China, Korea, Japan to gather more material, but he got sick in March and canceled it. He went back to Portland where he continued to work for American Lifeograph, and he wrote and directed The Golden Trail (1920), another Alaska-set melodrama shot in the Lower 48. He married Irene Simpson in November 1920.\n\nSo he was ready to be hired when George A. Lewis formed the Alaska Moving Picture Corporation, a stock company with 500 shareholders, to make the first big production to be filmed there. The article in Variety about it said: “They are tired up north of Alaska pictures made in California and have organized to give the world at least one real Alaska picture.” On March 7, 1923 Moomaw and 18 cast and crew members left Seattle on a steamship to do just that.\n\nAfter Chechakos, Moomaw signed a contract with the film’s distributor to make four more films, but he completed only two, Under the Rouge (1925) and Flames (1926). After that he occasionally appeared in the trades with plans to move his studio to Hollywood and projects that fell through, but his directing career ended and he became a camera designer.\n\nHe went to work for the Stewart-Warner Company, who was mostly known for manufacturing gauges and instruments for cars as well as scoreboards for sporting events. In the late 1920s they decided to expand their line to film cameras for amateurs that would be sold through radio stores, according to International Photographer. Lewis Moomaw designed the “Hollywood Model” 16 mm camera and they built the initial run of 500 under his supervision in a factory on Santa Monica Blvd. They retailed for $50.00. The company moved the plant to Chicago in February 1931 and Moomaw, his wife and son David moved along with it. Unfortunately the Great Depression affected sales, and the company discontinued making it in 1933.\n\nHowever, he continued to have a successful career in designing cameras. He went to work for Bell and Howell in Chicago and he was granted thirteen patents between 1934-1952 for equipment including cameras, projectors, film feed devices and a rewind mechanism. He retired and, according to his biography on Find a Grave, he became a rancher in San Diego where he died on August 22, 1980.\n\n*There were several different spellings of the title, including Cheechacos and Chechahcos. Arbitrarily I settled on the shortest one, Chechakos, so I’ve used that throughout.\n\n**When he was born, his middle name was Hembree (his mother’s maiden name). Later he changed it to Herman, but his death record changed it back to Hembree.\n\n***There’s no record of him patenting a camera this early.\n\n“Associated Will Issue First Picture of Alaska,” Exhibitors’ Trade Review, March 29, 1924, p. 11.\n\n“Associated Gets Rights to Chechakos,” Motion Picture News, March 29, 1924, p.1426.\n\nGeorge Blaisdell, “The Chechakos is Entertaining Drama,” Exhibitor’s Trade Review, May 17, 1924, p. 30\n\n“The Chechakos,” Film Daily, May 18, 1924, p. 10.\n\n“The Chechakos Has Notable Preview,” Exhibitors’ Trade Review, May 17, 1924, p. 23.\n\n“Chechakos Shows, Los Angeles Times, June 27, 1924.\n\nAdele Whitley Fletcher, “Across the Silversheet,” Motion Picture Magazine, August 1924, p.57.\n\n“A Gold Rush Thriller,” New York Times, May 13, 1924.\n\n“Heard on Film Row,” Moving Picture World, March 25, 1917, p. 1976.\n\n“Home Equipment for Radio Stores,” International Photographer, April 1931, p. 25.\n\nGrace Kingsley, “Director Signs,” Los Angeles Times, August 19, 1925.\n\nGrace Kingsley, “Moomaw to Make Mormon Film,” Los Angeles Times, August 14, 1928.\n\n“Moomaw in Los Angeles, to Make Four for A.E.,” Exhibitors’ Herald, September 5, 1925, p. 40.\n\n“Moomaw to Build New Plant,” Film Daily, March 29, 1926, p.1\n\n“Moomaw to Transfer Unit Here,” Los Angeles Times, January 4, 1926.\n\n“New Company Plans Alaskan Picture,” Moving Picture World, March 31, 1923, p. 568.\n\n“Plans to Produce in the Orient,” Los Angeles Times, January 25, 1926.\n\n“Real Alaskan Picture Will Be Made There,” Variety, March 8, 1923, pp. 1, 27.\n\n“Six Veritable Gold Mines in Chechakos Tie-Ups.” Exhibitors’ Trade Review, May 17, 1924, pp. 41-42.\n\n“Snappy Stunt for The Chechakcos,” Moving Picture World, May 10, 1924, p. 209.\n\n“Title of Alaskan Film is Changed,” Los Angeles Times, May 20, 1923.\n\n“Tomorrow’s Cabrillo Film Shows Big Alaska Ice Slide, Also Vaudeville,” San Pedro News Pilot, August 21, 1924.\n\n“Tourist Influx Predicted,” Los Angeles Times, August 17, 1926.\n\n“Working in Portland, Ore., Film Daily, October 29, 1924, p. 9.\n\n“World Film Mfg.
