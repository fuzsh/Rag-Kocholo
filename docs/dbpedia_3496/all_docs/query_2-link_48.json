        "text": "\"Ladies an' Gents: On your right is a vehicle that has defied the rush of civilizashun—the last horse car in New York.\"\n\nThe last silent film for star/producer Harold Lloyd as well as director Ted Wilde (who sadly succumbed to a fatal stroke at age forty the following year), Speedy is also a bouncy love letter to New York City—otherwise known as the fastest way to my heart.\n\nLloyd plays Harold 'Speedy' Swift, lending to the role not only his actual given name but the titular nickname as well. Though he begins the action as a superlative soda jerker, Speedy's true calling is as an obsessive Yankees fan—even going so far as to reproduce their in-progress line scores via a…\n\nSpeedy marks the final silent theatrical release for comedy genius Harold Lloyd, who stars as his world-famous ‘glasses character’(which had such a profound cultural influence in Japan that his horn-rimmed glasses became au courant, affectionately termed roydos and subsequently turned up in Japanese cinema quite regularly)—this time a job-hopping baseball fanatic named Harold ‘Speedy’ Swift who leads the charge on a grassroots vigilante venture to save his future grandfather-in-law’s small business from hostile corporate takeover.\n\nSpeedy, a flair-bartending soda jerk who predicts Tom Cruise in Cocktail by 60 years, juggles egg creams, orangeades and his consuming Yankees obsession, only to lose his job on a Friday afternoon delivery gone awry. Unruffled, he treats his sweetheart to an epic weekend date…\n\n\"When a boy loses his job, buys a new suit and takes a girl to Coney Island, he's either insane or in love... and there's not much difference\"\n\n- Narrator,\n\nIs that a crab in your pocket or are you just...\n\nThe character Speedy is a man obsessed with baseball and his girlfriend and when a greedy railroad tycoon is trying to buy up the last horse drawn trolley in New York, Speedy ain't having it. Part of what I love about watching silent movies is that often they are like a time capsule that gives you insight into how the world existed before you were born. Speedy introduces us to a world where Baseball mattered more than anything and…\n\n“You thief, it’s men like you that make women afraid to wear underwear.”\n\nThis is one of the most popular feature movies of Harold Lloyd and also one of his last works.\n\nIt’s about Speedy (Harold Lloyd), who tries to save the car line of Pop, the father of his girlfriend (Ann Christy), in order not to let form a streetcar monopoly in the city.\n\nThis movie is too weird, its plot is unexpected, the ending is predictable but all the stuff that takes place here is really unexpected. It has original and funny jokes.\n\nIt gives the viewer a great and insightful view of the old streets of New York and Coney Island in the 1920s. Since I’m Spanish…"
