        "text": "The Ghost Breaker is a 1922 American silent horror comedy film about haunted houses and ghosts. It was produced by Famous Players-Lasky and distributed through Paramount Pictures. It was directed by Alfred E. Green and starred Wallace Reid in one of his last screen roles. The story, based on the 1909 play The Ghost Breaker by Paul Dickey and Charles W. Goddard, had been released on film in 1914 (bearing the same name), directed by Cecil B. DeMille and Oscar Apfel.\n\nThe 1922 version is now considered lost. Two of the actors in this film, Snitz Edwards and Arthur Edmund Carewe, later appeared together in the 1925 Lon Chaney silent classic The Phantom of the Opera. Two uncredited \"ghosts\" in the cast, Mervyn LeRoy and Richard Arlen, later went on to successful film careers.\n\nThe Ghost Breaker would be remade in the sound era as The Ghost Breakers (1940) with Bob Hope and Paulette Goddard, and later as Scared Stiff (1953) starring Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin.\n\nPlot[]\n\nWarren Jarvis (Wallace Reid) and his manservant Rusty Snow (Walter Hiers) help a beautiful young heiress named Maria Theresa (Lila Lee) to rid her father's mansion of ghosts. The spooks turn out to be fakes however, fabricated by the Duke D'Alba (Arthur Carewe) to scare the young lady away, thus allowing him to steal her father's hidden gold."
