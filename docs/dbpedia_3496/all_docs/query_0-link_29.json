        "text": "It’s Pride month and many events have been canceled or postponed, but PRIDE is not canceled, so why not celebrate by watching a few stellar LGBTQ films! Sidewalk programmers have put together an extremely comprehensive list of many of our favorites, along with some fun extras. We’ve included classics, as well as many titles that you may not have heard of, plus lots of surprises. The list is broken down into LGBTQ sections with PG films and a fun “in the closet” section at the end. This list has excluded episodic content and only highlights feature films. Let us know what you like! Happy, Happy Pride!\n\nThe + means the film can be considered indie.\n\nThe * means that the film is a festival selection.\n\nThe # means the film was a cinema selection\n\nThe / means the writer and/or director was a Sidewalk Film Festival alum.\n\nL\n\nGEMINI (2017) + /\n\nA brilliant neon-soaked modern noir set in contemporary Hollywood, director Aaron Katz’s sly, subversive hangout thriller follows the fraying relationship between a famous actress (Zoe Kravitz) and her personal assistant (Lola Kirke). We don’t want to spoil much about this one, but it’s worth the investment of your time and attention — and features one of the best scores of the past few years from the prolific film composer Keegan DeWitt.\n\nThe GEMINI soundtrack is available on vinyl: https://lightintheattic.net/releases/4153-gemini-original-motion-picture-soundtrack\n\nWatch On: Hulu, Amazon Prime, Vudu, Google Play, YouTube\n\nTHE FAVOURITE (2018) /\n\nOne of the best films of the last 20 years, THE FAVOURITE is Yorgos Lanthimos’ brilliantly odd dive into the18th century England. You owe it to Emma Stone to watch THE FAVOURITE – her organs shifted after wearing a corset for a month during the making of the film. “A frail Queen Anne occupies the throne and her close friend, Lady Sarah, governs the country in her stead. When a new servant, Abigail, arrives, her charm endears her to Sarah.”\n\nHere’s an article from Harpers Bazaar about the real Queen Anne: https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/entertainment/a26140377/the-favourite-queen-anne-true-story/\n\nWatch On: Hulu, Amazon Prime, Vudu, Google Play, YouTube\n\nVITA & VIRGINIA (2019) * # +\n\nAdapted from the 1992 play of the same name, Vita and Virginia traces the turbulent (to say the least) romance, friendship and professional relationship between literary icon Virginia Woolf and poet and novelist Vita Sackville West. Moving from their first encounter to beyond the collapse of their romance, the film time travels through1920’s England. The locations are breathtaking, including numerous scenes shot on location at Knole House, Vita Sackville-West’s magnificent 365 room family estate.\n\nWatch On: Hulu, Amazon Prime, Vudu, Google Play, YouTube\n\nBARE (2015) * +\n\nBored with small-town life, Sarah is thunderstruck by the entrance of an outgoing, exciting troublemaker, Pepper. What begins as an intoxicating collision of two very different lives quickly begins to evolve into something more substantial, but, like any collision, there’s fallout. Natalia Leite’s feature directorial debut magnificently captures the excitement of insoluble crushing and places it against the backdrop of the wondrously neon-highlighted desert. Featuring Paz de la Huerta and Dianna Agron (best known for GLEE) in her first feature film lead role, Bare premiered at the 2015 Tribeca Film Festival and screened at SHOUT 2015.\n\nWatch On: Hulu, Amazon Prime, Vudu, Google Play, YouTube, Sling TV\n\nDISOBEDIENCE (2017) +\n\nAn inter-Rachel romance! Based on the novel of the same name by Naomi Alderman, “A woman returns to her Orthodox Jewish community that shunned her for her attraction to a female childhood friend. Once back, their passions reignite as they explore the boundaries of faith and sexuality.” Director Sebastián Lelio has stated that there was “tremendous electricity” between Rachel McAdams and Rachel Weisz – dang!\n\nWatch On: Amazon Prime, Vudu, Google Play, YouTube\n\nTHE MISEDUCATION OF CAMERON POST (2018) * +\n\n1993: When Cameron Post (Chloë Grace Moretz) is caught making out with a girl at prom, she is sent straight to Gay Conversion Therapy Camp God’s Promise. Mixing dark humor, deadpan timing, and a bittersweet earnestness, Desiree Akhavan’s adaptation of the beloved novel by E.M. Danforth gently prods away at the hypocrisies, manipulation, and exploitation that underlie homophobia, be it societal or internalized.\n\nWatch On: Hulu, Amazon Prime, Vudu, Google Play, YouTube\n\nSET IT OFF (1996)\n\nLesbian character Cleo Simms (played by Queen Latifah – her first leading role in a feature film) lands SET IT OFF on the list. “Desperation drives four inner-city women to bank robbery in Los Angeles, then they start mistrusting each other.”\n\nWatch On: HBO, Amazon Prime, Vudu, Google Play, YouTube, iTunes\n\nTHE LADIES OF THE HOUSE (2014) * +\n\nA birthday outing with friends turns into a horrific fight for survival after the partying bros become trapped in a house with a family of malevolent women who enjoy a pin-up lifestyle and a special diet. THE LADIES OF THE HOUSE stars Shout and Sidewalk multi-alums Farah White, Melodie Sisk, and Frank Mosley along with Brina Palencia, Samrat Chakrabarti, and Belladonna. Lesbian horror!\n\nWatch On: Amazon Prime, iTunes\n\nBOUND (1996)\n\nOkay, so it’s not the greatest film ever and it’s pretty darn campy, but it’s also really fun… oh and Gina Gershon – plus it’s directed by Lilly and Lana Wachowski. Ex-con Corky (Gershon) joins forces with Violet in an effort to steal millions of dollars of mob money and blame it on Violet’s jerky boyfriend Caesar. Gina Gershon claims her influences for the role were James Dean, Marlon Brando, and Clint Eastwood.\n\nWatch On: HBO, Amazon Prime, Vudu, Google Play, YouTube, iTunes, Crackle, Pluto TV\n\nPORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE (2019) #\n\nPossibly the best film of 2019 – perhaps of the last decade. Gorgeous, breathtaking, mesmerizing, other-worldly and spectacularly romantic. We were incredibly proud to screen PORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE at the Sidewalk Cinema. Directed by Céline Sciamma – in 18th century France a young painter, Marianne, is commissioned to do the wedding portrait of Héloïse without her knowing. Therefore, Marianne must observe her model by day to paint her portrait at night.

The film’s tone is eerie thanks to amazing, thoughtful cinematography, but also perhaps because almost all of the film’s locations were the actual places where the events occurred. Also notable, Juliet Hulme was revealed to be mystery writer Anne Perry who came forward and revealed her real identity in 1994 during the production of HEAVENLY CREATURES.\n\nHere’s Anne Perry’s novelist website: http://www.anneperry.co.uk/\n\nWatch On: This one is harder to find at the moment, it’s not available streaming and the DVD/Blu-Ray options are out of print, there are some options on Ebay\n\nTORMENTING THE HEN (2017) * +\n\nClaire, a New York playwright, is invited to the Berkshires to present her work. She brings along her girlfriend, Monica, a Brazilian environmental engineer. Their idyllic retreat is soon interrupted by an unnerving neighbor, Mutty, whose lack of social boundaries and penchant for lawn mowing gradually chips away at Monica’s sanity. Difficulties regarding connecting to others, outside of one’s own cultural, ethnic and sexual orientation, lead characters to clash and collide. Misunderstandings spiral into something more sinister and sun-drenched, hazy summer days grow darker.\n\nWatch On: Amazon Prime\n\nCLOUDS OF SILS MARIA (2014) +\n\nWe had you at Juliette Binoche and Kristen Stewart! “A film star comes face-to-face with an uncomfortable reflection of herself while starring in a revival of the play that launched her career.” We’re not sure if we believe this, but Juliette Binoche claims that she took a role in the film GODZILLA to “believably deliver a line from the CLOUDS OF SILS MARIA script about acting in blockbusters.” Director Olivier Assayas has claimed that CLOUDS OF SILS MARIA is a companion piece to PERSONAL SHOPPER (featured in the “These Films Are So In The Closet” section below) – the two would make a great, albeit extremely subtle, Pride double feature.\n\nWatch On: Amazon Prime, Google Play, YouTube, Sling TV, iTunes, Vudu\n\nWHEN NIGHT IS FALLING (1995) +\n\n“An uptight and conservative woman, working on tenure as a literacy professor at a large urban university, finds herself strangely attracted to a free-spirited, liberal woman who works at a local carnival that comes to town.” WHEN NIGHT IS FALLING received mixed reviews upon release, including two thumbs down from Siskel & Ebert, but there’s a hang-gliding date and a heavy circus theme, so it makes the list. AfterEllen’s most recent review states, “one of the worst movies I have ever loved with a full-hearted, unconstrained passion. It has virtually no redeeming qualities, and yet I challenge even the most intellectually rigorous critic not to delight in it.”\n\nWatch On: Pluto TV, Amazon Prime, Google Play, YouTube\n\nCAROL (2015) + #\n\nAdapting Patricia Highsmith’s novel The Price of Salt as a brilliant love story, Director Todd Haynes’ CAROL is dreamy and entrancing. Set during the holiday season in 1950s New York City, Carol is the story of the whirlwind romance between shopgirl Therese (Rooney Mara) and the titular socialite (Cate Blanchett). Featuring a memorably lush score from Carter Burwell and period-appropriate Super 16mm film by cinematographer Ed Lachman, CAROL is top-notch on every possible level — one of the best films of the last few decades (dare we say all-time) and featuring some of its strongest, most sensitive performances.\n\nHere’s a link to the start of a hilarious series of articles from Autostraddle. “30 Days of Carol”: https://www.autostraddle.com/30-days-of-carol-day-one-ranking-my-best-carol-posts-412949/\n\nOne of my favorites of the 30, “Ranking Carol’s Best Pickup Lines”: https://www.autostraddle.com/ranking-carols-best-pickup-lines-386471/\n\nWatch On: Vudu, Amazon Prime, iTunes\n\nPARIAH (2011) +\n\n“A Brooklyn teenager juggles conflicting identities and risks friendship, heartbreak, and family in a desperate search for sexual expression.” Directed by Dee Rees (director of MUDBOUND), PARIAH premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival and won the Excellence in Cinematography Award.\n\nWatch On: Amazon Prime, Google Play, YouTube, iTunes, Vudu\n\nGIA (1998)\n\nStarring Angelina Jolie and Faye Dunaway, “The story of the life of Gia Carangi, a top fashion model from the late 1970s, from her meteoric rise to the forefront of the modeling industry, to her untimely death.” Many consider Gia to be the “first supermodel” (though Janice Dickinson will argue that moniker belongs to her). During her modeling career, Carangi became addicted to heroin, and she died of AIDS-related complications at 26, becoming one of the first famous women to die of the disease. Cindy Crawford has claimed that Carangi carved the way for her career, in part due to her resemblance to Gia. Crawford rose to prominence the same year that Carangi died and was often called “Baby Gia” within the industry. GIA focuses on Carangi’s relationship with a make-up artist named Linda, but she has been romantically linked to fellow models Julie Foster and Janice Dickinson and makeup artist Sandy Linter.\n\nHere’s a great site focusing on Gia Carangi : https://www.crfashionbook.com/fashion/g25904023/gia-carangis-secret-moments/\n\nHere’s Gia Carangi’s 20/20 Interview: http://www.giacarangi.com/gia-carangis-abc-tv-2020-interview/\n\nWatch On: Hulu, HBO, Amazon Prime, Google Play, YouTube, iTunes, Vudu\n\nMONSTER (2003) +\n\n“Based on the life of Aileen Wuornos, a Daytona Beach sex worker who became a serial killer.” Directed by Patty Jenkins, the film brings empathy and grace to Wuornos’ complicated life story and received a great deal of criticism due to such.

Directors Lara Embry and Carolyn Shere, both Alabama natives, also skillfully spotlight Representative Patricia Todd, at one time the state’s only openly gay legislator. Todd stood on the frontlines, fighting some of the heaviest battles facing LGBTQ Alabamians. ALABAMA BOUND is one of the all-time most riveting and heartfelt documentaries regarding queer life in the South.\n\nWatch On: Check the films website for upcoming screenings and broadcasts: https://www.alabamaboundfilm.com/\n\nSHAKEDOWN (2018) * +\n\nSHAKEDOWN follows the story of the Shakedown Angels — exotic dancers who performed primarily for queer women in Los Angeles underground gay clubs in the ’90s and early 2000s. Led by party promoter and self-described stud “Ronnie-Ron,” the Shakedown Angels’ performance personas develop a cult-like fan following.

While the local papers were quick to label the women as a “seething, Sapphic septet”, OUT IN THE NIGHT tells a different story involving self-defense in the face of violent harassment. While the film subtly reflects on the racism, homophobia, and sexism in the American judicial system, there is an intense focus on the personal experience of queer women moving through a flawed system. OUT IN THE NIGHT won the Best Documentary Feature award at the 2014 New Orleans Film Festival and screened at the 2014 SHOUT FILM FESTIVAL\n\nWatch On: Vudu, Amazon Prime, Google Play, YouTube\n\nEDIE & THEA: A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT (2009) +\n\n“After 42 years, Edie and Thea are finally able to get married.

WHITNEY: CAN I BE ME skillfully covers Houston’s background and rise to fame, focusing on the controlling record industry, her marriage to Bobby Brown and, most-talked-about, the intimate 18-year relationship that Houston had with best friend, creative director and lover Robyn Crawford. Compiled of current and archival interviews, breathtaking performances and never-before-seen footage, the documentary is captivating for Whitney fans and non-fans alike. By the film’s end there is no question, Houston possessed a genuine and rare talent and tenacity, she was a veracious superstar, avoidably lost too soon and not simply the caricature of excess that tabloid headlines reduce her to. The film was the 2017 SHOUT opening night selection.\n\nWatch On: Hulu, Showtime, Sling TV, Amazon Prime, Google Play, YouTube, Vudu\n\nWe Know, We Know:\n\nBLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR (2013) +\n\nThis one is problematic. One of the most talked about, panned and applauded lesbian films of the past two decades… the controversy is mostly focused on its 7-minute sex scene – not only because of the run time or because the director took ten days to shoot it, along with over a hundred takes, but because both actors have spoken out against the director and the process of shooting that particular scene. Author Julie Maroh, whose comic-book novel the film is based on, has said about the film: “It appears to me that this is what was missing on the set: lesbians.” Burn! All this said and considered, the film still manages to land on list after list during Pride month and beyond and it certainly cleaned up at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival – it was the first time ever that the Palme d’Or was awarded to both actors and the director (it’s usually just given to the director). At 19 actor Adele Exarchopoulos is the youngest person to ever win the Palme d’Or and Exarchopoulos and co-star Lea Seydoux, were the second and third women in history to ever receive the award. Lots to consider.

He runs around with friends, drinking and drugging, he reluctantly gets a girlfriend and, more than anything else, he wrestles with his sexuality. Moving from chat rooms to the passenger seat of stranger’s cars, Frankie’s life seems to be teetering on the verge of explosion. His father is dying of cancer, his future is unclear and his behavior is dangerous. Director Eliza Hittman’s presentation of dark, drunken and dreamy corners of Brooklyn feel like perilous foreign landscapes. The film’s cinematography (Hélène Louvart) and direction is poetically hypnotizing. The feminine approach behind the camera, combined with the masculine bodies that consistently fill the frame, flip the typical rubric and the result is a unique, androgynously beautiful, incredibly watchable work of art. BEACH RATS is a welcomed warning sign that the LGBTQ cinematic landscape is changing. The film premiered at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival and we were honored to have it as the Closing Night Film for SHOUT 2017.\n\nWatch On: Hulu, Amazon Prime, Google Play, Vudu, YouTube\n\nHENRY GAMBLE’S BIRTHDAY PARTY (2016) * +\n\nFamily, classmates, and church friends gather to celebrate Henry Gamble’s 17th birthday with a party that rivals Mrs. Dalloway’s in sexual and emotional tumult. Struggling to reconcile his conservative Christian upbringing and blossoming gay identity, Henry floats between the conflicting worldviews of his party guests. As day stretches into night and once polite small talk grows in intensity, Henry’s pool party reveals its attendees’ clandestine affairs and discomforts. Writer/director Stephen Cone depicts evangelical church culture with striking precision in this familiar story of suburban secrets and lies.

Single by choice, Jenn spends her days teaching hot yoga and running errands for her demanding boss. Matt suffers from comic-book writer’s block and can’t get over his jerky ex-boyfriend. They decide to fulfill a youthful promise to have a child together… the old-fashioned way. Can they navigate the serious and unexpected snags that they hit as they attempt to get their careers and dating lives back on track in preparation for parenthood? GAYBY is an irreverent comedy about friendship, growing older, sex, loneliness, and the family you choose. Based on the celebrated short film of the same name that screened at Sidewalk in 2012 (as well as at over one hundred other film festivals), Gayby is relentlessly hilarious, admirably hopeful and surprisingly poignant.\n\nWatch On: Amazon Prime, iTunes, Vudu, Tubi\n\nCAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME?

A master deceiver who came out of the closet at the age of 81, Randi created fictional characters, fake psychics, and even turned his partner of 25 years, the artist Jose Alvarez, into a sham guru named Carlos. But when a shocking revelation in Randi’s personal life is discovered, it isn’t clear whether Randi is still the deceiver—or the deceived.

It follows two trans sex workers, Alexandra and Sin-Dee (dynamite performances from both Mya Taylor and Kitana Kiki Rodriguez), on one sunny Christmas Eve in Los Angeles; when Alexandra spills the news that Sin-Dee’s boyfriend is cheating on her with a cisgendered woman, she goes on the warpath to find them both.\n\nWatch On: Hulu, Sling TV, Amazon Prime, Vudu, Google Play, YouTube, iTunes\n\nTOMBOY (2011) +\n\nFrom director Céline Sciamma (PORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE): “A family moves into a new neighborhood, and a 10-year-old named Laure deliberately presents as a boy named Mikhael to the neighborhood children.” TOMBOY was a nominee for Outstanding Film at the 2012 GLAAD Media Awards and winner of the Teddy Award at the 2011 Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nWatch On: Amazon Prime, Vudu, Google Play, iTunes\n\nGUN HILL ROAD (2011) + /\n\nDirected by Sidewalk/Shout alum Rashaad Ernesto Green. “An ex-con returns home to the Bronx after three years in prison to discover his wife estranged and his child exploring a gender transformation that will put the fragile bonds of their family to the test.”\n\nWatch On: Amazon Prime, Vudu, Google Play, iTunes, Tubi, YouTube\n\nHEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH (2001) +\n\nIt all began as an off-Broadway musical in 1997, which got its start via live band karaoke nights. Off-Broadway HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH quickly achieved “cult status and critical acclaim” which then led writer/director/star John Cameron Mitchell to parlay such success into a feature film version of the narrative. “A transgender punk-rock girl from East Berlin tours the U.S. with her band as she tells her life story and follows the former lover/band-mate who stole her songs.” A historically relevant piece of trivia: The original off-Broadway production of HEDWIG started in the ballroom of The Hotel Riverview (now The Jane), a space that once gave shelter to the surviving crew of the Titanic in 1912. For this reason the film features Titanic imagery throughout.\n\nHere’s a fun “10 Things You Didn’t Know” article about the film: https://www.stlmag.com/culture/theater/10-things-you-didn-t-know-about-hedwig-and-the-angry-inch/\n\nWatch On: HBO, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Vudu, Google Play, iTunes, YouTube\n\nTHE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP (1982)\n\nThis is a bit of an odd one to hit the list and the content is minor, but important all the same. Based on the 1978 novel by John Irving, “A struggling young writer finds his life and work dominated by his unfaithful wife and his radical feminist mother, whose best-selling manifesto turns her into a cultural icon.” John Lithgow co-stars as transgender former football player Roberta Muldoon, a role for which he was received a Best Supporting Actor nomination at the 55th Academy Awards. According to GLADD, the character “Roberta is considered by many to be one of the first sympathetic transgender characters in a film made for a mass audience.” Lithgow has stated, Roerta is “a person who is utterly unaffected, she feels more herself than she’s ever been and, in that sense, it was revolutionary.”\n\nHere’s an article from the Paris Review, looking back at THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP with a 40-year perspective: https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2019/08/23/garp-forty-years-later/\n\nWatch On: Amazon Prime, Vudu, Google Play, iTunes, YouTube\n\nT Documentaries:\n\nCALL HER GANDA (2018) * +\n\nIn 2014, Jennifer Laude, a transgender Filipina woman, was found murdered, and all evidence pointed to a young U.S. serviceman as the culprit. The subsequent trial had international repercussions, rocking the relationship between America and the Philippines and sparking protests over transphobia and the neo colonial mindset of the U.S. military. This shocking documentary examines the impunity with which American soldiers are permitted to behave in the Philippines — for which the trans community has paid a heavy and tragic toll.\n\nWatch On: Amazon Prime, Google Play, YouTube\n\nMAN MADE (2018) * +\n\nWelcome to the world of competitive bodybuilding for transgender men, where a resilient community competes, builds each other up, and works towards self-actualization. We follow four trans men in their challenging journeys to competition day; seeing how their relationships, self-image, and bodies change as they work towards their goals. MAN MADE is truly a moving look into this competitive, yet nurturing and accepting world.\n\nWatch On: Amazon Prime, Google Play, YouTube\n\nKIKI (2016) * +\n\nSara Jordenö’s striking documentary follows several members of the Kiki scene, New York’s gay ballroom movement, one that is composed of a complicated system of teams or “houses” that compete in voguing competitions for cash and bragging rights. However, as the documentary explores, the Kiki scene isn’t just about dance competitions (though with such talent and enthusiasm that might be enough), but, at its heart, is about companionship, protection, activism and chosen family. Touring through New York gymnasiums, rec centers, bodegas and piers, Kiki is visually stunning and truly represents the landscape that is the birthplace of the scene. The documentary offers the enjoyment of ballroom alter egos, extravagant costumes, and moments of hilarious snark, but also reminds us that HIV/AIDS is not a thing of the past and the concerns facing transgender teens, especially those who are non-white, remain mostly unheard.\n\nWatch On: Hulu, Amazon Prime, Google Play, YouTube, Vudu, iTunes\n\nBOY I AM (2006) * +\n\n“While female-to-male transgender visibility has recently exploded in this country, conversations about trans issues in the lesbian community often run into resistance from the many queer women who view transitioning as a “trend” or as an anti-feminist act that taps into male privilege. BOY I AM is a feature-length documentary that begins to break down that barrier and promote dialogue about trans issues through a look at the experiences of three young transitioning FTMs in New York City – Nicco, Norie and Keegan – as they go through major junctures in their transitions, as well as through the voices of lesbians, activists and theorists who raise and address the questions that many people have but few openly discuss.”\n\nWatch On: Kanopy\n\nTHE DEATH AND LIFE OF MARSHA P. JOHNSON (2017) * +\n\nMarsha P. Johnson was a leading transgender activist in the 1980s: present at the Stonewall Riots alongside Sylvia Rivera. Her death rocked the New York LGBT activist scene, with many of her peers skeptical of the NYPD’s ruling that she committed suicide. In this gripping documentary, we follow activist Victoria Cruz as she tries to solve the mystery of Marcia’s death. David France, the director of HOW TO SURVIVE A PLAGUE, brings us this riveting film that’s part tribute, part whodunit, and part call-to-action.\n\nHere’s a link to the Marsha P. Johnson Institute: https://marshap.org/about-mpji/\n\nWatch On: Netflix\n\nMY PRAIRIE HOME (2013) * +\n\nWith only an acoustic guitar and a laptop, transgender singer/songwriter Rae Spoon embarks on a modest tour across the vast and blue-skied plains of Canada, facilitated by Greyhound buses and generic motel rooms. Delicately observed through Spoon’s contemplative moments, MY PRAIRIE HOME takes an impressionistic approach to its subject, thwarting the expectations of a traditional music documentary. The film poetically weaves together Spoon’s personal history of an evangelical household back in Alberta, a troubled family life, and a forbidden first love – all of which left indelible marks on their lyrics and are brought to life through playful, music-video–like visual sequences. Within the first moments of the film, director Chelsea McMullan visually cues the audience to subvert its expectations, preparing us to spend intimate time with her subject, who sees the world in their own way. A particular joy comes from delving into an artist’s world of music and musings; discovering Rae Spoon is this film’s biggest reward.\n\nHere is Rae Spoon’s website: http://www.raespoon.com/\n\nWatch On: iTunes\n\nWe Know, We Know:\n\nPARIS IS BURNING (1990) +\n\nAnother famous, but problematic, for many, film – most notably because the director is a white, cisgender, queer woman – Jennie Livingston. “A chronicle of New York’s drag scene in the 1980s, focusing on balls, voguing and the ambitions and dreams of those who gave the era its warmth and vitality.” PARIS IS BURNING won the Outstanding Documentary Film at the 1992 GLAAD Media Awards and the prestigious Documentary Grand Jury Prize at the 1991 Sundance Film Festival. The film is also part of the Criterion Collection.\n\nWatch On: iTunes, Criterion Blu-ray and DVD\n\nTHE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA QUEEN OF THE DESERT (1994)\n\nPRISCILLA QUEEN OF THE DESERT ends up on almost every annual pride list. “Two drag performers and a transgender woman travel across the desert to perform their unique style of cabaret.” There are numerous problematic elements, including in the film’s credits. PRISCILLA QUEEN OF THE DESERT is covered in awards, including the 1995 Academy Award for Best Costume Design, the1995 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Film and Outstanding Narrative Feature at Outfest 1995.\n\nWatch On: Google Play, YouTube, Vudu, iTunes\n\nBOYS DON’T CRY (1999) +\n\nOne of the most famous transgender relevant films of all time, it is important to note that BOYS DON’T CRY features a great deal of violence and trauma and has been accused of being transphobic by some. Director Kimberly Peirce is genderqueer and BOYS DON’T CRY evolved from a short film that was Peirce’s thesis project at Columbia University. “A young man named Brandon Teena navigates love, life, and being transgender in rural Nebraska.”\n\nWatch On: HBO, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Google Play, YouTube, Vudu, iTunes\n\nBEFORE STONEWALL (1984) +\n\nAnother classic that hits all the annual lists, “The history of the Gay and Lesbian community before the Stonewall riots began the major gay rights movement.”\n\nWatch On: Amazon Prime, iTunes\n\nQ\n\nRAW (2016) +\n\nQueer horror! Once again, a lot to unpack! “A young woman, studying to be a veterinarian, develops a craving for human flesh.” RAW is clearly influenced by director Abel Ferrara’s 1995 film THE ADDICTION starring Lili Taylor, Christopher Walken and Annabella Sciorra – which could also make this list and would make a great double feature with RAW.\n\nWatch On: Google Play, YouTube, Vudu, iTunes, Amazon Prime\n\nA GIRL WALKS HOME ALONE AT NIGHT (2014) +\n\nLike the film’s director, Ana Lily Amirpour, A GIRL WALKS HOME ALONE AT NIGHT is hard to pin down, it has been described as ““the first Iranian Vampire Western”, it’s also been referred to as a “noir, spaghetti western”, “Iranian New Wave”, “pulp”, “trans-national”, “”political”, feminist-romantic.” Ambiguous, unique, daring, visionary.

However, her beauty and youth, which generate intense fascination and jealousy within the fashion industry, may prove themselves sinister.” Please note The Washington Times called NEON DEMON “depraved” and even used the word “smut” and the New York Times branded it “puerile” and “offensive.”\n\nHere’s a cool article on sets from the film: https://filmandfurniture.com/2016/10/neon-demon-film-sets/\n\nAnd a pretty hilarious article on the directors (Nicolas Winding Refn) commentary track on the film: https://filmschoolrejects.com/commentary-the-neon-demon-b0e2a75f0c6f/\n\nWatch On: Google Play, YouTube, Amazon Prime, Vudu, iTunes\n\nAXOLOTL OVERKILL (2017) * +\n\nSet against the backdrop of wild Berlin, a troubled young teenager struggles to cope after the death of her mother. Unsupervised and undisciplined, she drifts in and out of relationships, testing her emotional and sexual limits. Shown through tense, occasionally humorous, and otherworldly vignettes, Axolotl Overkill offers a female perspective on the angsty self-destructive anti-hero. Director Helene Hegemann adapts the screenplay from her own novel. The title references the unusual lifecycle of an axolotl, an amphibian that reaches maturity without metamorphosis.\n\nWatch On: Google Play, YouTube, Amazon Prime, Vudu\n\nSUSPIRIA (2018)\n\nMore of a reimaging than a remake, there are a lot of mixed feelings about SUSPIRIA 2018. This film also contains a great deal of violence, but… Tilda Swinton has the strangest crush on Dakota Johnson so it makes the list. Trigger warning through the roof – Dakota Johnson has claimed that the intensity of the shoot led her to seek therapy. “A darkness swirls at the center of a world-renowned dance company, one that will engulf the artistic director, an ambitious young dancer, and a grieving psychotherapist. Some will succumb to the nightmare. Others will finally wake up.”\n\nWatch On: Google Play, YouTube, Amazon Prime, Vudu\n\nBOOKSMART (2019)\n\nWe love Olivia Wilde’s feature debut at Sidewalk. And it’s streaming on Hulu, so if you haven’t gotten on board with this brilliant comedy yet, now’s the perfect time. It follows two overachieving high school seniors (Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever) who, on the verge of graduation, try to pack all the partying they never did into one wild night. Mayhem ensues.\n\nHere’s a fun article on the film’s costumes: https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/5/30/18645970/booksmart-movie-olivia-wilde-beanie-feldstein-costumes\n\nWatch On: Hulu, Google Play, YouTube, Amazon Prime, Vudu\n\nSKATE KITCHEN (2018) * +\n\nTHE WOLF PACK (Sidewalk 2015) director, Crystal Moselle’s narrative debut, SKATE KITCHEN stylishly conveys the story of outsider Camille who makes fast friends with a group of fellow skateboarders. Similar to the backstory regarding THE WOLF PACK, Moselle randomly met the core cast of non-actors on a train. She enlisted them for a short film, expanding the relationship for SKATE KITCHEN. A candid urban coming-of-age tale, the film also explores the challenges faced by young women moving within unavoidable male-centric spaces and the incredible importance of female friendship in modern America. The new HBO series BETTY was created by Moselle, based on SKATE KITCHEN and includes most of the cast of the original film.\n\nHere’s the actual Skate Kitchen’s Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/theskatekitchen/?hl=en\n\nWatch On: Hulu, Google Play, YouTube, Amazon Prime, Vudu\n\nTHE HUNGER (1983)\n\n“A love triangle develops between a beautiful yet dangerous vampire, her cellist companion, and a gerontologist.” Starring Catherine Deneuve, Susan Sarandon and David Bowie and featuring Bauhaus!\n\nWatch On: HBO, Google Play, YouTube, Amazon Prime, Vudu, iTunes\n\nMY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO (1991) +\n\nDirected by Gus Van Sant, “Two best friends living on the streets of Portland as hustlers embark on a journey of self discovery and find their relationship stumbling along the way.” Very loosely based on Shakespeare’s Henry IV, Part 1, Henry IV, Part 2, and Henry V and starring River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves, MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO is considered a landmark film in the 1990s New Queer Cinema movement. Van Sant had great trouble getting the film financed and Phoenix and Reeves agreed participation is what led to the film being made. River Phoenix’s agent initially refused to pass the script along to his client so Keanu Reeves rode his motorcycle from Canada to Gainesville, Florida (Phoenix’s hometown) to hand deliver the script and convince his friend to star.\n\nWatch On: Google Play, YouTube, Amazon Prime, Vudu, iTunes\n\nKNIVES AND SKIN (2019) * +\n\nA Sidewalk 2019 selection. Big River is living in the shadow of missing teenager Carolyn Harper. Haunted and sad, the town is stuck in a chaotic funnel cloud of grief and looming doom. It’s easy to draw comparisons to TWIN PEAKS and DONNIE DARKO and even RIVERDALE, along with vibes of the original “Serial” podcast, yet KNIVES AND SKIN is wholly original — beautiful and gross, feminine and androgynous, hopeless and joyous and brutally relevant in its poetic investigation of a doomed world.\n\nWatch On: Hulu, Google Play, YouTube, Amazon Prime, Vudu\n\nA Few PG Selections\n\nLOVE, SIMON (2018)\n\nPG-13\n\nAn adaptation of the book Simon vs. The Homosapiens Agenda, LOVE, SIMON is the first film to feature a gay teenage main protagonist produced by a major Hollywood studio. “Simon Spier keeps a huge secret from his family, his friends and all of his classmates: he’s gay. When that secret is threatened, Simon must face everyone and come to terms with his identity.”\n\nWatch On: Google Play, YouTube, Amazon Prime, Vudu\n\nFAR FROM HEAVEN (2002) +\n\nPG-13\n\nPerhaps the most pristine cinematography on the list – directed by Todd Haynes, “In 1950s Connecticut, a housewife faces a marital crisis and mounting racial tensions in the outside world.” The film “explores race, gender roles, sexual orientation, and class in the context of 1950s America.” FAR FROM HEAVEN shows the heavy influence from the work of Douglas Sirk, most notably the amazing ALL THE HEAVEN ALLOWS.\n\nWatch On: Hulu, Sling TV, Google Play, YouTube, Amazon Prime, Vudu, iTunes\n\nORLANDO (1992) +\n\nPG-13\n\nLoosely based on Virginia Woolf’s 1928 novel “Orlando: A Biography”: “after Queen Elizabeth I commands him not to grow old, a young nobleman struggles with love and his place in the world.”\n\nWatch On: YouTube, Amazon Prime, Vudu, iTunes, Google Play\n\n3 GENERATIONS (2015)\n\nPG-13\n\n“After Ray decides to transition from female to male, Ray’s mother, Maggie, must come to terms with the decision while tracking down Ray’s biological father to get his legal consent.”\n\nWatch On: Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Prime, Vudu, iTunes, Google Play\n\nPICNIC AT HANGING ROCK (1975)\n\nPG\n\n“During a rural summer picnic, a few students and a teacher from an Australian girls’ school vanish without a trace.

After a song that they record as a goof goes viral, Offerman tries to persuade his daughter to form a band, both to satisfy a lifelong dream of his own and to hold on to the one lasting relationship in his life. Featuring extremely likeable original songs and a great supporting cast (Ted Danson plays a bartender!), HEARTS BEAT LOUD truly earns its reputation for being a heart-warming crowd pleaser.\n\nWatch On: Hulu, YouTube, Vudu, Google Play\n\nTHESE FILMS ARE SO IN THE CLOSET\n\nEach one of the following film descriptions could start with “come on”. The gay content is barely hidden and/or it would be a way more interesting film if the gay content were more prevalent or overt, because gosh darn it’s there!\n\nLITTLE DARLINGS (1980)\n\nA little summer camp fun – Ferris and Angel have a competition to see which of the two can loose their virginity first. Kristy McNichol plays Ferris who, in the opening scene, in the butchest manner possible, pulls a cigarette from a rolled-up sleeve and racks a dude who tries to talk to her and Angel is played by an at-her-most- androgynous Tatum O’Neil – there’s even a fedora. The sexual tension between the two young women is off the charts and culminates into a strangely erotic food fight in which Angel rubs pancakes slowly on Ferris’ ches. Plus the film ends with a very suggestive “best friend” reference. Oh and side note: Matt Dillon has never been as pretty.\n\nWatch On: Tubi, Amazon Prime, Vudu\n\nPRETTY IN PINK (1986)\n\nAs acknowledged at our recent drive-in screening of PRETTY IN PINK, Steff clearly has a crush on Blaine, hence his issue with Andie – there’s really no other explanation for his douchey behavior. Also Duckie is clearly gay (but yet in love with Andie), even Molly Ringwald has publicly noted such.\n\nWatch On: HBO, Amazon Prime, Vudu, iTunes, Google Play\n\nOCEAN’S 8 (2018)\n\nLou (Cate Blanchett) and Debbie (Sandra Bullock) are clearly a couple – all the references and hints are right there. Plus Lou’s name is Lou – that smoky eye, that blue suit, the leather pants and all those vests, come on! OCEAN’S 8 is also a lot more fun to watch with this read of the characters.\n\nHere’s a Vice article titled “Every Outfit Cate Blanchett Wore in ‘Ocean’s 8’ Made Me Gayer”: https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7xm7ee/cate-blanchett-oceans-8-fashion-gay\n\nWatch On: Amazon Prime, Vudu,YouTube, Google Play\n\nPERSONAL SHOPPER (2016) +\n\nI don’t know about you, but I can watch Kristin Stewart text with a ghost for days… “A personal shopper in Paris refuses to leave the city until she makes contact with her twin brother who previously died there. Her life becomes more complicated when a mysterious person contacts her via text message.” Fun trivia – one of the dogs in the film is named Bella, a TWILIGHT reference for those in the know. According to howgayisit.com: “There is no evidence for the protagonist of this movie being gay other than the fact that she is played by Kristen Stewart which is evidence enough.”\n\nWatch On: Amazon Prime, Vudu, YouTube, Google Play, iTunes, Sling TV\n\nREBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE (1955)\n\nFor one the character Plato is so obviously gay. It has been said that James Dean was very much in the know regarding such and supposedly told Plato actor Sal Mineo, prior to filing a scene at the abandoned Getty Mansion, “Look at me the way I look at Natalie.” Actor Sal Mineo was gay and, of course, James Dean was rumored to be bi-sexual. REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE is also a study of American male masculinity, making the film mulit-layered and incredibly interesting, especially considering the casting.\n\nHere’s a brief article and video on “What Makes “Rebel Without A Cause” Such A Gay Classic?”: http://www.newnownext.com/what-makes-rebel-without-a-cause-such-a-gay-classic/07/2016/\n\nAnd here’s a paper titled ““What it Takes to Be a Man”: A Comparison of Masculinity and Sexuality in Rebel without a Cause and River’s Edge”: https://digitalcommons.ric.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1030&context=honors_projects\n\nWatch On: Hulu, HBO, Amazon Prime, Vudu, Google Play, iTunes, Sling TV\n\nHIGHER LEARNING (1995)\n\nWell, it’s not exactly in the closet, but the lesbian storyline is by far one of the strongest threads of the film and yet one of the most brief. Such wasn’t the original intent of the production, HIGHER LEARNING “was heavily cut upon its release, eliminating much of the romantic relationship between Taryn (Jennifer Connelly) and Kristen Connor (Kristy Swanson)“. Synopsis: “People from all different walks of life, encounter racial tension, rape, responsibility, and the meaning of an education on a university campus.”\n\nWatch On: Amazon Prime, Vudu, Google Play, YouTube\n\nFRIED GREEN TOMATOES (1991)\n\nPerhaps the most outrageously in the closet from this list! Idgie and Ruth are clearly a couple. A lesbian relationship between Ruth and Idgie does, of course, take place in Alabamian (and out lesbian) Fannie Flagg’s novel from which the film is based. Actors Mary-Louise Parker and Mary Stuart Masterson along with, Fannie Flagg were all strong advocates for depicting the lesbian relationship between Ruth and Idgie in the film. Director, Jon Avnet, and the films producers, however, decided to cut such and make the characters just friends. Avnet has said that he considers the food fight scene “as an analogy for a love scene between the two that he chose not to include”. Bummer.\n\nWatch On: Hulu, Sling TV, Starz, Amazon Prime, Vudu, Google Play, iTunes, YouTube\n\nTOP GUN (1986)\n\nYou’ve heard the theory… there’s certainly enough there to make for a very dangerous drinking game.

Still don’t buy it… The fact that star Kelly McGillis is an out lesbian and looks really amazing in a bomber jacket also helps the film make the list.\n\nWatch On: Amazon Prime, Vudu, Google Play, iTunes, YouTube, Sling TV, fuboTV, Philo, AMC\n\nA SIMPLE FAVOR (2018)\n\nPaul Feig goes big, broad and melodramatic with this comic thriller that subtly lampoons the “missing white woman” subgenre of airport fiction while indulging in its most enjoyable tropes. A fantastic Blake Lively stars as the mysterious woman who goes missing; her friend (Anna Kendrick) then devotes her time to discover the truth about her disappearance while also suspiciously starting to adopt her lifestyle. This thing twists and turns like you won’t believe. The queer/bi-sexual content is minimal, but the tension is high and dang Blake Lively looks good in a tux – regardless this one confirms that all romantic relationships are pretty stupid anyway.\n\nWatch On: Hulu, Amazon Prime, Vudu, YouTube, Sling TV\n\nSOME KIND OF WONDERFUL (1987)\n\nA two-second look at Watts (played by Mary Stuart Masterson – and, yes, the characters name is Watts) and you’ll see why everyone is so confused if you didn’t already. SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL is basically a role reversal of PRETTY IN PINK with Watts as the Duckie, so, of course, she’s clearly queer. There’s zero chemistry between Keith Nelson (Eric Stoltz) and Amanda Jones (Lea Thompson) and we’re all secretly wishing Watts and Amanda would just run off together and leave Keith with his own weird attempt to buy a hot girlfriend.\n\nWatch On: HBO, Amazon Prime, Vudu, Google Play, YouTube, PlutoTV\n\nA NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 2: FREDDY’S REVENGE (1985)\n\nCalled “the Gayest Horror Film Ever Made” and that’s saying a lot… Here’s a Buzz Feed article regarding just how gay the second NIGHTMARE is: https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/louispeitzman/the-nightmare-behind-the-gayest-horror-film-ever-made\n\nWatch On: HBO, Amazon Prime, Vudu, YouTube, iTunes, Google Play\n\nA NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 2 star Mark Patton is also profiled in the documentary SCREAM QUEEN! MY NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, which focuses on just how gay the film is and how such impacted Patton’s life as a once Hollywood closeted and then later out gay man. SCREAM QUEEN! was the 2019 Shout Opening Night selection.\n\nWatch On: Amazon Prime, Vudu, YouTube, Google Play\n\nWONDER WOMAN (2017)\n\nJust how queer is Wonder Woman? Where to begin?… She was born on the female-only paradise island of Themyscira. Wonder Woman comic book writer Greg Rucka has stated, “Wonder Woman must be queer”, “it makes no logical sense otherwise” and has further said, “Themyscira is a queer culture. I’m not hedging that”. William Moulton Marston, Wonder Woman’s original creator, was an “outspoken feminist, swinger, S&M practitioner, and firm believer in the superiority of women”. The original Wonder Woman comic was accused of containing “lesbian imagery”. Marston’s partners and inspiration Elizabeth and Olive continued to live together as a couple for 38 years after his death, until Olive passed away in 1985. The new WONDER WOMAN 1984 poster is drenched in rainbow colors and “Screams ‘Gay Rights”. The list goes on. DC Universe, please let Wonder Woman out of the closet!\n\nWatch On: HBO, Amazon Prime, Vudu, YouTube, iTunes, Google Play\n\nROUGH NIGHT (2017)\n\nAnother, it’s not fully in the closet, but could do better – “Things go terribly wrong for a group of girlfriends who hire a male stripper for a bachelorette party in Miami.” The LGBTQ content: central characters Frankie (Ilana Glazer) and Blair (Zoë Kravitz) have a romantic relationship in their history and this minor storyline is weaved into the films narrative, along with a couple of additional moments (no spoilers). ROUGH NIGHT would be much stronger with a more substantial storyline. We should add – Kate McKinnon stars!\n\nWatch On: Amazon Prime, Vudu, YouTube, iTunes, Google Play\n\nBIRDS OF PREY: AND THE FANTABULOUS EMANCIPATION OF ONE HARLEY QUINN (2020)\n\nOkay, it’s not really in the closet, it’s there, but the film would be improved with more focus on the LGBTQ text and subtext and by avoiding some of the stereotypes. If you didn’t already know, BIRDS OF PREY is a superhero film based on the DC Comics team “Birds of Prey” and it stars Margot Robbie. “After splitting with the Joker, Harley Quinn joins superheroes Black Canary, Huntress and Renee Montoya to save a young girl from an evil crime lord.” While the character Harley Quinn is established as bisexual during an opening narrated animation, she still spends too much of the film going on about the Joker. Detective Renee Montoya is a lesbian and villain Black Mask is presumably gay, plus the film has a feminist lean. The content is getting there, but it could be better – all that said it’s a more out mainstream superhero film than others.\n\nWatch On: Amazon Prime, Vudu, YouTube\n\nJOHNNY GUITAR (1954)\n\nJoan Crawford stars as a stubborn saloon owner threatened by gossipmongering locals in this 1954 Western classic from director Nicholas Ray. Only the arrival of mysterious loner Johnny Guitar (Sterling Hayden) can take some of the heat off — but not much, as what makes this movie remarkable is how independent and vibrant its female characters are. It’s not unusual to see gay undertones in the Western genre, heck that’s part of what makes BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN work so well – the undertones are brought to the surface. In most Westerns, women threaten men’s unbridled freedom as they roam the American landscape looking tough and women are helpless or simply secondary. JOHNNY GUITAR is an exception with the one and only Joan Crawford taking on the stereotypical male role as lesbian overtones abound.\n\nWatch On: Hulu, Amazon Prime, Vudu, YouTube, Google Play, Sling TV\n\nDAD MOVIES\n\nIt’s Father’s Day – Sidewalk programmers put together a list of suggested films to watch with your dad, help celebrate your dad, remember your dad, or perhaps just the opposite! We’ve included a few resources here and there as well. Happy Fathers Day.\n\nKey:\n\nThe + means the film can be considered indie.\n\nThe * means that the film is a festival selection.\n\nThe # means the film was a cinema selection\n\nThe / means the writer and/or director was a Sidewalk Film Festival alum.\n\nTHE HEAVY HITTERS:\n\nKRAMER VS KRAMER (1979)\n\nThe ultimate reluctant dad movie, KRAMER VS KRAMER is surprisingly complicated and, in many ways, as much about navigating the aftermath of a broken marriage as it is about parenting. KRAMER VS KRAMER was clearly a heavy influence on A MARRIAGE STORY (listed below). Starring Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep, and JoBeth Williams at her usual best in a memorable supporting role. “Ted Kramer’s wife leaves him, allowing for a lost bond to be rediscovered between Ted and his son, Billy. But a heated custody battle ensues over the divorced couple’s son, deepening the wounds left by the separation.”\n\nWatch On: Vudu, Amazon Prime, YouTube, iTunes, Google Play or dust off that VHS tape\n\nMORRIS FROM AMERICA (2016) *+\n\nAn exploration of puppy love, single parenthood, and the kind of acute “otherness” that can only be experienced by a black American young man transplanted in an all-white German town. 13-year-old Morris’ life revolves around his loving and playful father (Superstar Craig Robinson) and his hip-hop aspirations… that is until a beautiful girl takes him on a dizzying ride, landing him somewhere between lost and found. With breathtaking cinematography and characters that are complicated and flawed while remaining infectiously likable, MORRIS FROM AMERICA is a true feel-good film and features one of the best dads of the decade.\n\nWatch On: Netflix, iTunes, Vudu, Amazon Prime, YouTube, Google Play\n\nFORD V FERRARI\n\nLess about focusing on a dad and more about being the ultimate stereotypical Dad Movie, FORD V FERRARI has cars and Italian cars, corporate interference, the laws of physics, a 24-hour car race and male bonding… and Christian Bale. Heavily based on a true story, the Ford Motor Company works to build a racecar that can win at the infamous Le Mans. Check out this vintage footage from the 1966 Le Mans race: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdpWTLB0Y4I\n\nWatch On: Vudu, Google Play, YouTube, Amazon Prime\n\nRAISING ARIZONA (1987) +\n\nYou know the story, H.I. (Nicolas Cage) wants to be a dad so badly that he steals a baby – how does RAISING ARIZONA not end up on a Fathers Day watch list!? “When a childless couple of an ex-con and an ex-cop decide to help themselves to one of another family’s quintuplets, their lives become more complicated than they anticipated.” Let’s take a break for some bad parenting with this piece of trivia: Fifteen babies played the Arizona quintuplets in the film. One of the babies was fired during production when he learned to walk. The mother went so far as to put her baby’s shoes on backwards in order to prevent him from walking.\n\nA great little Mental Floss article on RAISING ARIZONA: https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/76329/10-law-abiding-facts-about-raising-arizona\n\nWatch On: Hulu, Vudu, Google Play, Amazon Prime, iTunes\n\nPAPER MOON (1973)\n\nWell this gets a little complicated… “During the Great Depression, a con man finds himself saddled with a young girl who may or may not be his daughter, and the two forge an unlikely partnership.” Ryan O’Neal plays Moses, the con man that becomes faux father to Addie, played by real-life daughter Tatum O’Neal, who won the Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for her performance at 10, making her the youngest person ever to win an Oscar. It’s rumored that the shooting process on PAPER MOON was grueling and that Tatum O’Neal would often require 50 takes. It’s also alleged that dad, Ryan, was incredibly jealous of Tatum’s Oscar win. She’s written an auto-biography calling him out for his alleged jerky ways and his quotes to the press about her are regularly cringe-worthy, all making PAPER MOON a family drama-fueled, complicated (on and off screen) dad time at the movies.\n\nWatch On: Pluto TV, Google Play, Amazon Prime, iTunes, Vudu, YouTube\n\nHEARTS BEAT LOUD (2018) *+\n\nNick Offerman plays a widower and career record storeowner whose daughter, played by the amazing Kiersy Clemons, is gearing up to start school across the country. After a song that they record as a goof goes viral, Offerman tries to persuade his daughter to form a band, both to satisfy a lifelong dream of his own and to hold on to the one lasting relationship in his life. Featuring extremely likeable original songs and a great supporting cast (Ted Danson plays a bartender!), HEARTS BEAT LOUD truly earns its reputation for being a heart-warming crowd pleaser.\n\nWatch On: Hulu, Amazon Prime, Vudu, iTunes, YouTube, Google Play\n\nINDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE (1989)\n\n“After his father Professor Henry Jones, Sr. (Sean Connery) goes missing while pursuing the Holy Grail, Professor Henry “Indiana” Jones, Jr. (Harrison Ford) finds himself up against Adolf Hitler’s Nazis again to stop them from obtaining its powers. When Sean Connery is dad to Harrison Ford and they fight Nazis, you better believe it’s a Fathers Day recommendation. Cheers!\n\nWatch On: Netflix, Amazon Prime, Vudu, iTunes, YouTube, Google Play\n\nHE GOT GAME +\n\nIn Spike Lee’s searing sports drama, a star high school basketball player (Ray Allen) must decide whether to commit to the NBA Draft or go to college. The pressure is compounded when his incarcerated father (Denzel Washington) is released to promote an agenda on behalf of the crooked governor. In typical Lee fashion, “He Got Game” is about a lot of stuff — but its heart is in the connection between these two men, climaxing in a one-on-one basketball game that sees the father finally release the burdens of his dreams to his son. It might be one of the more electric sequences in Lee’s entire filmography.\n\nWatch On: Hulu, HBO, Amazon Prime, Vudu, iTunes, YouTube, Google Play\n\nFACE /OFF (1997)\n\nAnother it’s-not-about-the-dad-it’s-about-the-dad-movie selection, we’ll use any excuse to include FACE/OFF on a rec list, but Fathers Day is clearly an easy justification. Sidewalk programmers are in support of any film that includes a “highly experimental face transplant”, but when the faces we are talking about are those of John Travolta and Nicolas Cage, it’s 100% on the list. Let’s boil things down: “In order to foil a terrorist plot, an FBI agent undergoes facial transplant surgery and assumes the identity of a criminal mastermind, who murdered his only son. The plan turns sour when the criminal wakes up prematurely and seeks revenge.” Our favorite behind the scenes pieces of trivia: “The crew shot on Nicolas Cage’s birthday. John Woo let Cage get emotionally charged up for a scene, then surprised him with a birthday cake. Afterwards, Cage asked Woo not to do that again.”\n\nWatch On: Sling TV, Amazon Prime, Vudu, iTunes, YouTube, Google Play\n\nROLL BOUNCE (2005)\n\n“In the summer of 1978, a teenager and his group of friends face new challenges when their neighborhood roller-skating rink closes, forcing them to visit a different rink.” Xavier’s mother has passed away, leaving father, Curtis, to raise Xavier and his sister, Sonya – the three help each other find their way after the loss.\n\nWatch On: Amazon Prime, Vudu, iTunes, YouTube, Google Play\n\nBOYZ N THE HOOD (1991) +#\n\nWriter-director John Singleton’s breakout first feature, BOYZ N THE HOOD lands on the Fathers Day list because of the unforgettable character Furious Styles (Laurence Fishburne). Wisdom-spouting dad time! The film “follows the lives of three young males living in the Crenshaw area of Los Angeles, dissecting questions of race, relationships, violence, and future prospects.” Look at this cast: Angela Bassett, Ice Cube, Morris Chestnut, Cuba Gooding Jr., Nia Long, Regina King and, again, Laurence Fishburne.\n\nWatch On: Hulu, Sling TV, Showtime, Amazon Prime, Vudu, iTunes, YouTube, Google Play\n\nRED RIVER (1948)\n\nWe’ll go old school with this pick, a classic Howard Hawks Western that finds a brewing conflict between John Wayne as a maniacal cattle driver pushing a herd of thousands of cattle from Texas to Kansas, and Montgomery Clift as the surrogate son who grows to object to the older man’s domineering ways. As the tension grows, the clash between generations seems destined for an almost Biblical climax — and though Hawks’ ending is pretty deflating, it suggests the transformative power of forgiveness and collaboration.\n\nWatch On: Hulu, Sling TV, Starz, Amazon Prime, Vudu, iTunes, YouTube, Google Play\n\nTHE NOT SO OBVIOUS (AND NOT FOR EVERYONE)\n\nTHE ICE STORM (1997) +\n\nWhile not seasonally appropriate, THE ICE STORM is one of the sweetest and saddest films about family disconnection and is also, in part, a meditation on the loss of innocence and the parental realization of such. An iconic scene in which father Ben Hood (Kevin Kline) carries his daughter Wendy (Christina Ricci) home will break your heart. “In suburban New Canaan, Connecticut, 1973, middle-class families experimenting with casual sex and substance abuse find their lives beyond their control.” Gene Siskel selected THE ICE STORM as the best film of 1997.\n\nWatch On: Amazon Prime, Vudu, iTunes, YouTube, Google Play\n\nEAST OF EDEN (1955)\n\nDirected by Elia Kazan, based on the novel by John Steinbeck and starring James Dean – “A wilful young man contends against his brother for the attention of their religious father while reconnecting with his estranged mother and falling for his brother’s girlfriend.” While watching EAST OF EDEN keep in mind that while shooting the Ferris wheel scene, in an effort to feel as uncomfortable as possible, James Dean refused to urinate the entire day. EAST OF EDEN is the only film that James Dean starred in that he personally viewed in its entirety, he passed away the same year the film was released.\n\nWatch On: HBO, Amazon Prime, Vudu, iTunes, YouTube, Google Play\n\nSAY ANYTHING (1989)\n\nMan, oh man, is this dad misguided. While SAY ANYTHING is clearly more of a late-high school teen romance than a dad story, the father stuff is certainly the tie that binds. “A noble underachiever and a beautiful valedictorian fall in love the summer before she goes off to college” and a well-intentioned, but wrecking ball of a dad meddles, and meanders throughout. The films origin story: “Producer James L. Brooks said the movie was inspired when Brooks saw a man walking with his daughter, and wondered what would happen if the father committed a crime.”\n\nWatch On: Amazon Prime, Vudu, iTunes, YouTube, Google Play\n\nTHE ROYAL TENENBAUMS (2001) +\n\nWes Anderson’s films are filled with complicated fathers or father figures, so most of his movies could theoretically show up on this list. But Gene Hackman’s indelible Royal Tenenbaum — disgraced lawyer, Western novel enthusiast and exiled paterfamilias of a family of failed geniuses — clearly takes the top prize. As Royal tries to reconnect with his ex-wife (Anjelica Huston) and children (Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson and Gwyneth Paltrow) by faking a cancer diagnosis, the Tenenbaum family grapples with its legacy and once again find resilience and comfort in their neglected family ties. And Royal isn’t an asshole — he’s just kind of a son of a bitch.\n\nHere’s a great visual essay breaking down Margot Tenenbaums style: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEzT8StSNi4\n\nAnd for something more dad-like, there’s a book “Bad Dads: Art Inspired by the Films of Wes Anderson”: https://www.booksamillion.com/search?id=7925348608453&query=+Bad+Dads%3A+Art+Inspired+by+the+Films+of+Wes+Anderson&filter=\n\nWatch On: Amazon Prime, Vudu, iTunes, YouTube, Google Play\n\nMARRIAGE STORY (2019) +#\n\n“Noah Baumbach’s incisive and compassionate look at a marriage breaking up and a family staying together.” Successful New York theater director Charlie Barber and his wife, actor Nicole Barber, split up and Nicole relocates with their son Henry to LA after landing a role in a TV pilot. The former couple attempt to navigate relationship fallout and parenthood from near and far.\n\nWatch On: Netflix\n\nRISKY BUSINESS (1983)\n\nAnything with Thomas Cruise has dad vibes, but in this case, Mr. Cruise isn’t the dad, he’s the kid with a dad or, actually, temporarily without a dad as his parents are out of town which allows for Thomas Cruise level shenanigans. In this particular instance the folks being out of town means that you hire a sex worker and then parlay that into turning the parents house into a brothel. RISKY BUSINESS is as 1980’s time capsule as you might think (or remember), but it’s likely way edgier than your memory or imagination might conjure. Loaded with surface level symbolism, cringe-worthy inappropriateness, an amazing score and classic moments, RISKY BUSINESS is well worth a watch/re-watch and parenting and dad-isms are just heavy enough to make Fathers Day the perfect reason.\n\nWatch On: Hulu, Cinemax, Amazon Prime, Vudu, iTunes, YouTube, Google Play\n\nFOOTLOOSE (1984)\n\nWhat do you do when your dad is the bible beating Rev. Shaw Moore who has made sure that partying, rock music and dancing has been outlined in the tiny farm town that you’re stuck in? You hook up with the hot (?), rebellious, fearless new kid in town and dance your ass off of course. Of all the films on the list FOOTLOOSE might somehow be the one with the dad who has the most broad power (well except DEVILS ADVOCATE of course). We love a good small town, strict preacher dad turn-around story, but who doesn’t?\n\nWatch On: Amazon Prime, Vudu, iTunes, YouTube, Google Play\n\nTHE SUPER OBVIOUS\n\nFATHER OF THE BRIDE (1991)\n\nA remake of the 1950 film of the same name, but staring Steve Martin of course! “With his oldest daughter’s wedding approaching, a father finds himself reluctant to let go.” A classic.\n\nWatch On: Hulu, TNT, TBS, Sling TV, Amazon Prime, Vudu, iTunes, YouTube, Google Play\n\nNATIONAL LAMPOON’S VACATION (1983)\n\nThe classic of all classics. “The Griswold family’s cross-country drive to the Walley World theme park proves to be much more arduous than they ever anticipated.” A fun thing to watch for: At Walley World, Rusty (Anthony Michael Hall) is taller than mom, Ellen (Beverly D’Angelo) – that’s because these scenes were shot 4 months after principal photography wrapped and Hall had grown three inches during the course of production.\n\nWatch On: fuboTV, AMC, Amazon Prime, Vudu, iTunes, YouTube, Google Play\n\nTHE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS (2006)\n\nIn addition to Will Smith having major dad vibes just in general, THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS might be the most dad movie of all time. “A struggling salesman takes custody of his son as he’s poised to begin a life-changing professional career.” Plus real life dad Will Smith plays dad to real life son Jaden Smith.\n\nWatch On: Netflix, Amazon Prime, Vudu, iTunes, YouTube, Google Play\n\nFIELD OF DREAMS (1989)\n\nIf THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS isn’t the most dad movie of all time then FIELD OF DREAMS definitely is. “An Iowa corn farmer, hearing voices, interprets them as a command to build a baseball diamond in his fields; he does, and the 1919 Chicago White Sox come.” Of course Iowa corn farmer is played by dad face Kevin Costner. If you’re up for a summer road trip you can visit the baseball field and farmhouse from FiELD OF DREAMS in Dyersville, Iowa.

I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don’t: I will look for you. I will find you. And I will kill you.” Dang. Massive testosterone dad time. “A retired CIA agent travels across Europe and relies on his old skills to save his estranged daughter, who has been kidnapped while on a trip to Paris.”\n\nWatch On: Amazon Prime, Vudu, iTunes, YouTube, Google Play\n\nIF YOU’RE WITHOUT YOUR DAD\n\nTHE CAT AND THE MOON (2019) +*\n\nWritten and directed by HEREDITARY star Alex Wolff, teenager Nick temporarily relocates to New York to stay with his late fathers former band mate, Cal, while his mom is in rehab. During his stay, Nick makes new friends who show him what the city has to offer. Dealing with mental issues of his own, Nick quickly finds himself struggling to cope. A beautiful and at times tragic story, the film shows the complexities of teenage life in NYC.\n\nWatch On: Vudu, Google Play, Amazon Prime, YouTube\n\nWILLY WONKA & THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (1971)\n\nWe’re not exactly sure what’s going on with Charlie’s home life or why so many people are piled in one bed all dang day while Charlie’s mom stirs a cauldron of soup, but we do know that Charlie’s dad isn’t around. It’s also pretty convenient that Grandpa Joe can suddenly walk when there’s a chance to visit the Chocolate Factory. Plus Wonka is possibly the most intense king of punishment and none of that dads in the film are very good at parenting, so all around there’s some pretty off the rails level dad stuff going down. You know the story: A poor but hopeful boy seeks one of the five coveted golden tickets that will send him on a tour of Willy Wonka’s mysterious chocolate factory. Here’s a “where are they now” article on the kids in WILLY WONKA: https://www.insider.com/willy-wonka-chocolate-factory-then-and-now-2016-8#many-members-of-the-cast-have-gotten-together-to-celebrate-the-movie-here-are-the-five-kids-celebrating-the-films-30th-anniversary-2\n\nWatch On: Netflix, iTunes, Vudu, Google Play, Amazon Prime, YouTube\n\nOBVIOUS CHILD (2014) +\n\nWhen you’re straight up not ready or don’t want to be a dad (or a mom)… Directed by Gillian Robespierre and featuring Jenny Slate, OBVIOUS CHILD premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival and was the talk of the 2014 festival circuit.\n\nWatch On: Netflix, iTunes, Vudu, Google Play, Amazon Prime, YouTube\n\nHUGO (2011)\n\n“In 1931 Paris, an orphan living in the walls of a train station gets wrapped up in a mystery involving his late father and an automaton.” HUGO also gloriously celebrates the father of all – the father of motion pictures, Georges Méliès.

Happy Fathers Day.\n\nWatch On: Tubi, Vudu, Google Play, Amazon Prime, YouTube\n\nYOU THOUGHT YOUR FATHER WAS AWFUL\n\nHONEY BOY (2019) +#\n\nDirected by Alma Har’el, “A view of a young actor’s stormy childhood and early adult years as he struggles to reconcile with his father and deal with his mental health.” It doesn’t get much more dad than this: HONEY BOY is Shia LaBeouf’s mostly autobiographical feature, in which the focus is on his tumultuous relationship with his father and subsequent struggles with addiction. Shia plays his own father, James (in real life Jeffrey).\n\nWatch On: Amazon Prime\n\nSTAR WARS: EPISODE V – THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (1980)\n\nWorst dad ever? “After the Rebels are brutally overpowered by the Empire on the ice planet Hoth, Luke Skywalker begins Jedi training with Yoda, while his friends are pursued by Darth Vader and a bounty hunter named Boba Fett all over the galaxy.”\n\nWatch On: Disney+, Vudu, Google Play, Amazon Prime, YouTube, iTunes\n\nTHERE WILL BE BLOOD (2007) +\n\nIt’s arguable that Daniel Plainview might actually be a worse dad than Darth Vader, he’s certainly equally intense. “A story of family, religion, hatred, oil and madness, focusing on a turn-of-the-century prospector in the early days of the business.” Suggested pairing with a milkshake and this article: https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/526144/15-surprising-facts-about-there-will-be-blood\n\nWatch On: Netflix, Vudu, Google Play, Amazon Prime, YouTube, iTunes\n\nTHE WRESTLER (2008) +\n\nAn end-of-the-line professional wrestler and deadbeat dad, Randy “The Ram” Robinson, “must retire, but finds his quest for a new life outside the ring a dispiriting struggle.” Mickey Rourke as a faded pro-wrestler = must see.\n\nWatch On: Vudu, Google Play, Amazon Prime, YouTube, iTunes\n\nMATILDA (1996)\n\nDanny DeVito villain dad! “The story of a wonderful little girl, who happens to be a genius, and her wonderful teacher vs. the worst parents ever and the worst school principal imaginable.”\n\nWatch On: Vudu, Google Play, Amazon Prime, YouTube, iTunes\n\nTHE SHINING (1980)\n\nTHE SHINING needs no summary or explanation.

When one of their musical jam sessions turns into a catchy potential hit, the two find themselves at a turning point in their lives. Toni Collette, Blythe Danner, and Sasha Lane co-star.\n\nAMAZING GRACE\n\nAs attendees at last year’s Sidewalk FilmFestival can testify, sometimes there’s no greater salve than to hear the music of Aretha Franklin brought to you uninterrupted. And that’s exactly what this long-delayed concert film does. In 1972, actor-director Sydney Pollack brought a team of cameramen to film the recording of Franklin’s live gospel album Amazing Grace. But the footage wasn’t assembled into a film and released until 2018 thanks to issues with the audio recording. Now, this important document has been brought to audiences, and you can experience the power of Franklin’s performance for yourselves. And you absolutely should.\n\nSince the film doesn’t contain any context, here’s an article providing such should you be interested: Link\n\nSTAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN\n\nNot the most purely pleasurable of the films starring the original TREK cast — that’s probably THE VOYAGE HOME, the only one inexplicably not on Hulu — but WRATH OF KHAN is probably the best one, thanks in no small part to the thrilling tactical maneuvering and the wild performance from Ricardo Montalban as the villainous Khan Noonien Singh.\n\nHere’s a cool article: Link\n\nLOVE & MERCY\n\nA favorite music biopics of recent years, this tells the story of the fall and rise of Beach Boys great Brian Wilson, played by Paul Dano as a young man as he sinks into mental illness and by John Cusack as an older man under the control of an unscrupulous doctor (Paul Giamatti). Elizabeth Banks co-stars as the love interest whose genuine affection provides Wilson with a way out. If you’re a die-hard Beach Boys fan, you’ve probably already seen this; if you aren’t and you haven’t, you might find both options to be particularly good for the soul right now.\n\nHere’s a link to a solid documentary on Brian Wilson from 1995 should you be interested in also doing a less narrative dive: Link\n\nMY BEST FRIEND’S WEDDING\n\nWe recommend this one mostly because for some reason we had a 35mm film print (well half of one) of this feature sitting around the old Sidewalk offices for years, we have no idea why. Also, Julia Roberts. Shhhhh Rachel Morgan secretly likes this film (and Cameron Diaz… come on the karaoke scene is so adorable).\n\nSAY ANYTHING\n\nWhen all else fails, raise a boom box outside of Ione Skye’s window – it’s the ultimate romantic social distancing, so much so that it was clearly filmed months and miles away. This is a really fun film to compare to THE GRADUATE – the ending is an inverted homage.\n\nThis easy to read, gossip-filled book, “You Couldn’t Ignore Me If You Tried: The Brat Pack, John Hughes, and Their Impact on a Generation” covers some fun details about SAY ANYTHING as well as numerous other Brat Pack era classics and breaks down how the Brat Pack became the Brat Pack, it’s actually a really sad tale: Link\n\nForeign-Language Favorites\n\nSHOPLIFTERS\n\nThe cuddlier Japanese cousin to the 2019 breakout Parasite (which will stream exclusively on Hulu starting sometime in April, by the way), Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Palme d’Or-winning smash is a story of a family of petty thieves whose already precarious existence is upended when they find a neglected little girl in need of care. This act of kindness will disrupt their way of life in ways they could not have anticipated, and this film will draw you in and break your heart in the best way possible.\n\nTHE SQUARE\n\nRuben Ostlund won the 2017 Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival with this art-world satire about an art museum curator (Claes Bang) whose personal and professional life takes a nosedive after he loses his wallet and phone to a pair of pickpockets.\n\nTHE VILLAINESS\n\nAfter the best picture-winning Parasite, audiences who might not have been familiar with how extraordinary South Korean cinema has been in the past few decades are now paying attention. This accessible, John Wick-style thriller is relentless and action-packed, following the twisty travails of a female assassin in a secret government program.
