        "text": "Plot Summary: Angela comes to Hollywood with only two things: Her dream to become a movie star, and Grandpa.\n\nShe leaves an Aunt, a brother, Grandma, and her longtime boyfriend back in Centerville. Despite seeing major\n\nmovie stars around every corner, and knocking on every casting office door in town, at the end of her first day she\n\nis still unemployed. To her horror, when she arrives back at their hotel, she finds that Grandpa has been cast in a\n\nmovie by William DeMille and quickly becomes a star during the ensuing weeks. Her family, worried that Angela and\n\nGrandpa are getting into trouble, come to Hollywood to drag them back home. In short order Aunt, Grandma, brother,\n\nboyfriend and even the parrot become superstars, but Angela is still unemployed. Trivia:\n\nSo many major stars appeared in cameos as themselves that it was necessary to find unknowns for the lead roles.\n\nOne of the film's few serious moments is a cameo by 'Arbuckle, Roscoe 'Fatty'' , whose career was essentially\n\nended in 1921 by criminal charges (even though he was acquitted). He makes a rare appearance here as a sadly\n\nunemployed actor, whose name is not mentioned.\n\nThis film is presumed lost."
