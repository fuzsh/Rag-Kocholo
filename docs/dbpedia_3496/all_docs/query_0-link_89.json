        "text": "In The Times and Democrat's new series, \"Orangeburg County: 100 objects, 100 days,\" the county is defined through the stories of 100 objects.\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 100:T&D’s history represented in mural\n\nThrough blizzards and fires, The Times and Democrat has not missed a day of publication in its 133-year history.\n\nThe newspaper’s commitment to providing news to the area was recognized during its 125th anniversary celebration in 2006.\n\nTo help mark the paper’s success, Charleston native Dana Coleman shared his talents by painting the mural that graces the Broughton Street wall of The T&D’s building.\n\nThe T&D was first published in September 1881 as the result of a merger of two newspapers: The Times and The Democrat. The mural shows the newspaper’s history from its founding to the present.\n\nOne portion of the mural shows the fire of 1972 that gutted the newspaper. Despite the fire, The T&D still managed to get the paper out. During the transition period, the paper was printed out of Sumter and Rock Hill.\n\nThe new press arrived seven days after the fire. Within 30 days, the pressroom had been rebuilt around it.\n\nThe far right of the mural is a display about the newspaper’s online presence and a laptop computer with the year 2006 on the screen. Both are a tribute to the newspaper’s technological advancements.\n\nDuring the anniversary celebration, partygoers enjoyed entertainment by South Carolina State University’s Drum Line, the Orangeburg-Wilkinson High School Marching Band, the Jarvis Brothers, the Orangeburg Part-Time Players, the SCSU Gospel Choir and the Claflin Jazz Ensemble. The Orangeburg Department of Public Safety Color Guard presented the colors.\n\nFollowing the singing of “Happy Birthday,” the crowd witnessed the unveiling of the mural on the Broughton Street side of The T&D.\n\n100 OBJECTS/Day 99: Award-winning 'Edisto Rose' pride of Gardens\n\nThe Edisto Memorial Gardens Rose Garden has received international and national acclaim as one of nine test gardens in the nation.\n\nFor the past 63 years, the Gardens have featured a number of unique and rare roses — from the green rose first discovered in China 271 years ago to a micro mini-rose called Cinderella.\n\nHowever, the diversity of Edisto Memorial Gardens, which is situated on the Edisto River, is perhaps best embodied in a special hybridized rose, fittingly named the “Edisto.”\n\nThe Edisto Rose, the only rose in the gardens named after the Orangeburg landmark, received the 2008 American Rose Society Award of Excellence.\n\nThe “red blend” mini-flora rose was hybridized by Michael Williams of Cross Hill, South Carolina. Unlike most hybrids, the color of the rose actually gets brighter in the heat.\n\nThe blooms of the Edisto are reddish-fuchsia with yellow-white reverse. The yellow on the outside of the petals intensifies as the weather gets hotter.\n\nThe rose can reach about four feet tall and four feet wide. It blooms from the end of April until the last frost.\n\nIn the home landscape, the Edisto is best used as an accent plant in a spot where it will receive six to eight hours of direct sunlight daily. As with other roses, a well-drained soil suits it best.\n\nCurrently, Edisto Memorial Gardens displays some 4,800 rose plants representing at least 120 labeled varieties.\n\nFor nearly 40 years, Edisto Memorial Gardens was one of only 23 test gardens sanctioned by All-America Rose Selections Inc. until they ended operations in 2012. In 2012, American Garden Rose Selections was formed to continue testing roses, and Edisto Memorial Gardens is now one of nine test gardens in the United States.\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 98: Holcim (US) cement plant mines limestone, other materials on-site\n\nThe Holcim (US) Holly Hill cement plant opened in 1966, ready to supply much-needed cement to the Southeast.\n\nPrior to the opening of the plant, Home Branch, a tributary of Four Hole Swamp, ran through what is now the company’s quarry.\n\nHolcim’s existing diversion canal re-routed Home Branch around the quarry in the late 1970s and early 1980s in order to divert water away from the mining operations.\n\nCurrently, a new stream channel through the middle of the quarry is being designed in an effort to protect it from potential flooding.\n\nThe on-site natural resources at the Holly Hill plant contribute to its production.\n\nThe quarry on the 3,700-acre property, a multiple bench limestone mine, holds more than 70 percent of the raw materials needed for making cement.\n\nMaterial is quarried by bucket wheel excavator, conveyed to a belt wagon, crushed, transferred to a belt conveyor system and stockpiled in a storage facility.\n\nThe limestone is combined with other materials and used at the mine site to produce cement that is sold in bulk and bag for use in the construction industry.\n\nSedimentary textures and fossils indicate the limestone that is mined at the Holly Hill plant is in the Eocene Santee Formation, which was formed in a shallow marine and lagoonal environment.\n\nHolcim’s Holly Hill cement plant has grown along with demand. The first shipment left the plant in May 1966. In 1972, a second kiln was added; a third kiln was added in 2001. In December 2001, the name of the plant at the time — Holnam — was changed to Holcim.\n\nIn 2003, a single dry-process kiln replaced the plant’s two wet-process kilns, boosting production to about 2 million metric tons of cement per year — nearly six times the plant’s original output.\n\nThe Holly Hill plant currently employs 188 people.\n\nParent company Holcim Ltd. is considered one of the nation’s leading manufacturers and suppliers of cement and mineral components. Holcim (US) has approximately 1,800 employees and operates 12 manufacturing plants and more than 50 distribution facilities in the United States.\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 97: First hospital for area opened in city in 1937\n\nThe Regional Medical Center has served Orangeburg and the surrounding community for more than 30 years.\n\nIn the early part of the 1900s, no such luxury existed in Orangeburg.\n\nThe first sustainable hospital was established in 1919 on Glover Street by Dr. Charles A. Mobley, a young surgeon who came to Orangeburg from Rock Hill.\n\nThe need for health care and the growth of Orangeburg soon strained the Glover Street facility.\n\nThe Tri-County Hospital Association was formed and a board of trustees was appointed on Jan. 1, 1934. Plans began for construction of a new hospital.\n\nAn application was made to the federal Public Works Administration, and a loan of $120,000 to be repaid over 30 years was received as well as a $108,900 grant.\n\nOn Jan. 15, 1936, a ground-breaking ceremony was held for the new hospital on Carolina Avenue. The entire construction cost was about $171,300.\n\nThe Tri-County Hospital building opened Aug. 15, 1937, with 82 employees and 100 beds.\n\nThe newspaper story about the grand opening carried the headline “Public Invited to Inspect Handsome New 125 Bed Plant, Many Visitors Expected.”\n\nApproximately 3,000 people from Orangeburg, Calhoun and Bamberg counties toured the hospital during the grand opening. Both Bamberg and Calhoun counties contributed funds for indigent patient costs.\n\nThe hospital was made of brick and concrete, thus being “fireproof.” The facility featured automatic elevators, electrical lighting, tile and terrazzo flooring and institutional equipment and furnishings. The overall investment was about $250,000.\n\nThe accommodations included private, semi-private rooms and four- and six-person ward configurations.\n\nThe hospital was equipped with two major and two minor operating rooms for surgical procedures. It also had an x-ray department, a clinical laboratory and an obstetrical department with its own nursery and delivery room. It also had a cafeteria and a food preparation department. There were two dining rooms for the nursing staff and the medical staff, as well as a larger cafeteria for patients’ families and visitors.\n\nThe operating rooms, the delivery room and the newborn nursery were air conditioned.\n\nThe success of the hospital was recognized in 1941, when the hospital’s medical staff commissioned portraits to be painted of the two men who were most responsible for establishing the facility: Dr. Charles A. Mobley and W. Eugene Atkinson.\n\nThe portraits still hang today at the Regional Medical Center.\n\nThe $26 million RMC opened May 17, 1981 on St. Matthews Road, and the first 128 patients were transferred from Carolina Avenue to the new facility on May 30, 1981.\n\nShortly after its closure, the old hospital became the home of the county health department. Today, it continues to house the Department of Health and Environmental Control divisions, including public health and environmental health.\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 96: Aquatic Center built to quench thirst for a swim\n\nCity history books don’t tell much about the daily lives of early 1900s citizens, but a glimpse reveals Orangeburg residents have always liked to swim.\n\nRecords indicate a cry for a public pool grew, and in the early 1920s, city leaders acted.\n\nBy the summer of 1921, the parking lot near what is today Edisto Memorial Gardens held a 50-foot by 100-foot concrete swimming pool. It sat above the ground with a long, covered pavilion on the street side.\n\nThat pool is long gone. But the desire for a public swimming option arose again and, in May 2006, Orangeburg County Council announced plans to construct a public swimming center and gymnasium.\n\nThe Orangeburg County Aquatic Center was born.\n\nIn August 2008, council unanimously accepted a $554,800 architectural bid by Charleston-based LS3P Associates toward the development of the aquatic center on a 3-acre site on St. Matthews Road. In April 2009, council accepted the $8.996 million low bid for the project.\n\nGround was broken in the middle of 2009 and the park opened in May 2010.\n\nThe water park includes plunge pools, tube slides, zero-depth entry, children’s activity pools, picnic areas, concessions, full sun and shade areas.\n\nAdjacent to the outdoor pool there is an indoor, year-round pool facility complete with a hydrotherapy pool, swimming classroom space, lockers and administrative offices.\n\nThe Orangeburg YMCA is operating the Aquatic Center under contract with Orangeburg County, the facility’s owner.\n\nThe use of the Aquatic Center and the water park is covered by the membership fee. Non-members pay a separate fee on a daily basis to use the facility.\n\nThe Aquatic Center was funded with about $4 million from the 1 percent capital project sales tax and about $2 million was used from the county’s $9 million general obligation bond issuance.\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 95:Building preserves name of ‘father of Orangeburg grade schools’\n\nTheodore Kohn was 10 when he emigrated from Furth, Germany to Orangeburg in 1850 with his parents and brother. He was among the first Jewish immigrants to Orangeburg.\n\nIn the decades that unfolded, Kohn proved to be a key to the city’s success.\n\nA downtown building still bears his name. It was where he founded a mercantile business in 1867 and operated it into the 1900s.\n\nKohn also served in the Edisto Rifles during the Civil War and was awarded the Cross of Honor for his service to the Confederate Army. He suffered an injury to his arm during the war that affected the use of that arm for the rest of his life.\n\nHe died at age 62, but not without leaving a legacy in the city that he called his home.\n\nKohn served as an alderman for the City of Orangeburg, was a founding member of the Edisto Bank and a major force behind the creation of Orangeburg’s public schools.\n\nHe’s often regarded in historical writings about Orangeburg as the “father of Orangeburg graded schools.”\n\nHe served on the school board of trustees up until his resignation shortly before an illness to which he succumbed.\n\nIn 1885, Kohn became president of the Hebrew Benevolent Society. The following year, the Hebrew Benevolent Society purchased land for a cemetery within Sunnyside Cemetery.\n\nThe people of Orangeburg respected Kohn’s contributions to the city to such a degree that every business in the city closed during his funeral service in June 1902.\n\nOrangeburg became home to several settlers and generations of Jewish residents and business owners.\n\nHarry N. Marcus was the mayor of his hometown of Eutawville from the late 1940s to the early 1970s. Marcus was a World War II veteran, Mason, Shriner and owner of Marcus Department Store in the small, eastern Orangeburg County town.\n\nIrving Benjamin, who owned a department store in Bowman, served for three decades on town council.\n\nJoseph J. Miller of Elloree had no living relatives when he died. The merchant left his savings to four Elloree churches, Orangeburg’s Temple Sinai, Charleston’s Britih Sholom Beth Israel, Savannah Hebrew Day School and other charities.\n\nOrangeburg’s beloved Mirmow Field was named to honor Edward V. Mirmow (Mirmowitz) Sr., who was born in New York City to Russian immigrants and moved with his family to Orangeburg in 1901. Mirmow lettered in football and baseball at the University of South Carolina and remained a loyal Gamecocks fan for the rest of his life.\n\nAfter World War II ended, Mirmow started the Orangeburg Indian Boosters Club which supported high school sports and organized the city’s American Legion Post 4 baseball program.\n\nContact the writer: mbrown@timesanddemocrat.com or 803-533-5545.

David F. Jamison, who served as president of the Secession Convention, and was one of the founders of The Citadel.\n\nC) The region was home for the Jamison School.\n\nIf you chose all of the above, you are 100 percent correct.\n\nThe Jamison School educated many students before it was closed and later moved to Orangeburg.\n\nA wooden auditorium tucked between the old fire department building and the old Nate’s Bait and Grocery Store is all that remains to remind people of the area’s importance in education.\n\nThe school, as well as a building referred to as the teacherage, which served as a home for the school’s teachers, originally faced the woods on the Old Stage Road. The road closed when U.S. 601 was built.\n\nMost recently, the wooden building served as a place where residents could cast their votes during elections.\n\nHowever, today all the building holds is the memories of the students fortunate enough to have attended its classes.\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 93:\n\nNEESES — Located in the western portion of Orangeburg County is the town of Neeses.\n\nOriginally known as Silver Springs from its earliest settlement until Sept. 29, 1898, the name was changed to honor John W. Neese, who sold the right-of-way to the South Bound Railroad in 1891.\n\nSituated in the heart of town on U.S. Highway 321 is the Neeses United Methodist Church, which is celebrating its centennial. On Aug. 20, 1914, the church was organized with a charter membership of 40.\n\nIn 1989, Friends of the late L.C. Bonnette erected a bell tower in his memory. The structure stands in the church’s front yard and houses the bell that was originally located in the church narthex -- often serving as a photo-op for passing motorists.\n\nOther sites of interest include the Neeses Farm Museum (which is currently closed for repairs), Giant Flea Market and Thunder Valley Raceway.\n\n100 OBJECTS/Day 92: SCSU stadium named for legendary coach Oliver C. Dawson\n\nOliver Cromwell Dawson served for many years as a professor, athletic director, coach and administrator at South Carolina State College.\n\nBut it was his prowess as the college’s head football coach that earned Dawson recognition when S.C. State’s current football stadium was named after him in 1984.\n\nAs the school’s head football coach in 1947, Dawson led the team to an undefeated season, which propelled it into the national championship for black colleges and universities.\n\nA Georgia native, Dawson coached five sports at S.C. State from 1935-1976 and won championships in four of them. He also served as athletics director and initiated the school’s Health and Physical Education program.\n\nWith segregation the law of the land in South Carolina, Dawson’s record in eight seasons (World War II halted football from 1943-45) was 30-29-7, but in 1947, he led the Bulldogs to a 6-0-2 season and the Black National Championship game.\n\nIn 1974, Dawson became the first black inducted into the South Carolina Athletic Hall of Fame, and in 1983 he became a charter member of the South Carolina State College Athletic Hall of Fame.\n\nDawson died in February 1989 at the age of 78.\n\nThe football stadium opened in 1955 and has undergone several upgrades and renovations over the years.\n\nSemi-permanent seats were added in 1972 to increase capacity to 10,000. Additional renovations included increasing the seating to 15,000 and remodeling the press box.\n\nIn 1994, a $4.5 million refurbishment project at Oliver C. Dawson Stadium raised the seating capacity to its present level of 22,000. The refurbishment entailed resodding the playing field, adding extra restrooms and again remodeling the press box.\n\nIn 2006, S.C. State installed synthetic turf to replace the natural grass in the stadium at a cost of $552,000 and added a $427,000 state-of-the-art scoreboard.\n\nThe stadium, situated on Buckley Street on the campus of SCSU, currently hosts men’s football and women’s soccer. It has witnessed much success. The Bulldogs won Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference titles in 1974, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983 and 2005. The Bulldogs claimed Black National Titles in 1976, 1981 and 1994 and earned NCAA Division 1-AA berths in 1981 and 1982.\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 91: Pecan trees took root in county in late 1800s\n\nFrom the old tree that granddad planted to acres of orchards, pecan trees are plentiful in Orangeburg County.\n\nThe planting of pecans in the county began in the late 1880s to early 1890s.\n\nBy the turn of the century, large groves appeared throughout all sections of the county.\n\nA century ago, there were already three pecan nurseries in Orangeburg County.\n\nThe leading varieties of pecans in Orangeburg County over the past 100 years have been Mobile, Van Deman, Schley, Stuart and Frotscher.\n\nThe “Stuart” is a favorite and is considered the most common cultivars of pecans in the Southeastern United States.\n\nThe “Stuart” was discovered in 1880 in Mississippi.\n\nA Stuart pecan tree takes eight to 10 years to begin producing nuts.\n\nIn the city of Orangeburg, there are two main pecan shelling businesses: Orangeburg Pecan Company and the “Nut House” at Orangeburg Milling Company.\n\nContact the writer: mbrown@timesanddemocrat.com or 803-533-5545.

I stole a kiss at the turn of a mile, my curiosity running wild. Cruising and playing the radio, with no particular place to go.” — Chuck Berry.\n\nThere was a time when cruising along and playing the radio was the place to be. It was a time that morphed from poodle skirts to teenyboppers on to bouffants and the Beatles.\n\nIf you couldn’t afford the just-released Split-T window Corvette as the place to steal a kiss, Dad’s family sedan would do just fine. And that could have been just like today’s “100 Objects” entry — the car perched atop the poles outside of Elloree on U.S. 301.\n\nThe now-rusted tank of a car is a 1953 Chevrolet Belair Deluxe that appears to have at one time been painted a flashy yellow.\n\nA novelty, the “cars on a pole craze” seems to have taken hold in the 1970s across the country, typically to advertise a car repair shop or dealership. Orangeburg County’s “Flying Car” seems to have been used for that purpose as well, first advertising a garage, then a car lot and finally a country store — all operated by a family from Elloree.\n\nThe Flying ‘53 Chevrolet was the first year for what Chevrolet called its “210” series, a line of autos so designated to follow a growing trend of naming models with numbers. The body styles offered the motorists seeking a premium vehicle included a convertible, a Sport Coupe hardtop, two doors or four, and the ultimate family model, the station wagon.\n\nElloree’s Flying Car is a four-door model that most likely boasted a light blue body paint with a dark blue top. All models came with an in-line 6-cylinder engine that produced at their maximum a whopping 125 horsepower — about as much as today’s economy cars. A “Powerglide” automatic transmission was optional.\n\nIt might not have had the power of the Corvette, but few cars did. Still, the 1953 Deluxe was once the queen of the highways.\n\nToday, the Flying Car has been cruising the air for more than 40 years. An eye-catcher for those who pass, it doesn’t take much to imagine the windows down, six cylinders powering the two-speed automatic transmission and the teenyboppers in Dad’s cruiser cruising down the highway with no particular place to go.\n\nContact the writer: rwalker@timesanddemocrat or 803-533-5516.

It and the clubhouse, the shell of a farm’s barn, serve as reminders of the days before the land was used for recreation.\n\nBefore construction of the $450,000 golf course in the early 1970s, the 200-acre site off St. Matthews Road was a South Carolina State University experimental dairy farm.\n\nThe site’s terrain — the property is located on one of the highest points in the greater Orangeburg area — proved an attractive opportunity for development.\n\nSeeing the potential, then-South Carolina State College President Dr. M. Maceo Nance Jr. and Orangeburg City Administrator Bob Stevenson worked together to bring the partnership to life with the goal of uniting Orangeburg’s people in the spirit of recreation and entertainment.\n\nThe recreational complex, with the golf course as a centerpiece, was born.\n\nOnce the Hillcrest idea was approved, Orangeburg City Council applied for matching federal funds.\n\nGov. John West and U.S. Sen. Strom Thurmond helped Orangeburg get about $320,000 through the Economic Development Administration.\n\nS.C. State agreed to lease the property to the city for $1 a year for 50 years, with both the university and city council appointing members to the governing Hillcrest Golf Commission.\n\nWest hit the first ball at the new golf course on Labor Day, Sept. 1, 1973.\n\nThe 18-hole course was designed and constructed by Russell Breeden.\n\nOpen year-round, this par 72 course measures 6,722 yards in length.\n\nThere have been improvements at the course over the years, including the addition of an automated sprinkler system and on-course restroom facilities. The club hosts lessons and tournaments including the annual Orangeburg Festival of Roses Tournament in April and the South Carolina State University Intercollegiate Tournament.\n\nIt is also a 1994 U.S.G.A. Sectional Qualifying course for the U.S. Amateur Championship.\n\nThe course, located on 1280 State A&M Road, is open Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday from 8 a.m. until 7 p.m.\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 88: South Carolina’s largest lake home to abundant wildlife\n\nInitially formed by the hand of man, Lake Marion has evolved into a paradise for wildlife.\n\nLake Marion, South Carolina’s largest lake, was formed in November 1941 during the construction of the Santee Dam as part of state-owned utility Santee Cooper’s Hydroelectric and Navigation Project.\n\nThe project was initiated under President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal program during the Great Depression.\n\nThe reservoir was constructed to provide hydroelectric power to rural South Carolina and to provide needed jobs for the depression-ravaged state.\n\nCovering about 110,600 acres, the lake is located within the coastal plain and is bordered by Orangeburg, Calhoun, Clarendon, Berkeley and Sumter counties. The lake’s headwaters extend upstream almost to the confluence of the Wateree and Congaree rivers, where seasonally flooded, forested wetlands form the wildlife-rich Sparkleberry Swamp.\n\nLake Marion is fed by many tributaries, including Wyboo Creek and the Santee River, and also by numerous springs including Eutaw Springs. The lake is named for the American Revolutionary War General Francis “Swamp Fox” Marion. His former home of Pond Bluff was one of the properties flooded when the lake was created.\n\nThe completion of the project was moved ahead as the result of World War II, and Lake Marion Dam was closed before the clearing of Lake Marion was completed. As a result, thousands upon thousands of stumps, dead tree trunks and live cypress trees are found in the lake.\n\nThese have served as fish habitats for nearly all fish species, especially crappie, bream and catfish.\n\nNative aquatic vegetation is also present along the gently-sloping shorelines and backwater sloughs, providing habitat for fish including largemouth bass, pickerel and bream.\n\nThe state fishing record for largemouth bass (16.2 pounds) was set at Lake Marion.\n\nOther fish that abound in its waters are striped bass, white perch, white bass, shellcrackers and chain (Jack). Deer, foxes, squirrels, turtles, doves, turkeys, alligators and various species of ducks, hawks, eagles, egrets and ospreys also call Lake Marion home.\n\nPublic access is provided via several public boat ramps as well as at Santee State Park and Santee National Wildlife Refuge on the northern shore of the lake. Of the total 13,000 acres that make up Santee National Wildlife Refuge, only 4,400 acres are owned, with the remaining acreage being managed under a lease agreement with the South Carolina Public Service Authority (aka Santee Cooper). The refuge manages 10 conservation easements on private lands, totalling 458 acres, in Bamberg, Barnwell, Clarendon and Orangeburg counties.\n\nInterstate 95 crosses Lake Marion near the town of Santee.\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 87: Cordova airport features runway made of grass\n\nCORDOVA -- Kurt Von Graff, owner of Dry Swamp Airport, has said the property was all farmland when he purchased it in 2003, but now it’s an airport and has been for the past decade.\n\nVon Graff, a retired construction worker from New Jersey, gradually made major adjustments and improvements to the private airport that was on the farmland he purchased from Lawrence Whitaker.\n\nThe runway measures 2,900 feet and is made of grass.\n\nThe airport is recognized by the Federal Aviation Administration and is open to the public.\n\nVon Graff said he’s also working on an aircraft museum for the site.\n\nHe said 11 planes are based there and that he has quite a few pilots stop at the only airport in Cordova to fuel up throughout the year.\n\nVon Graff is also a licensed commercial pilot and certified maintenance mechanic.\n\nHe’s grateful to his neighbors and to visitors to the airport – whether they arrive there by driving or flying.\n\nContact the writer: mbrown@timesanddemocrat.com or 803-533-5545.

John Palmer\n\nT&D Staff Report\n\nA man dressed in an 1860 Citadel uniform stands tall in Orangeburg’s Memorial Plaza.\n\nIn June 1887, a group of 21 Orangeburg County women formed the Orangeburg Confederate Monument Association with the intent of erecting a monument to the soldiers of the Confederacy from Orangeburg County who had died.\n\nThe ladies raised $7,000 over a seven-year period to construct the monument.\n\nOn Oct. 18, 1893, several thousand people gathered on the plaza to view the unveiling of the 33-foot-tall Confederate Monument modeled after Capt. John Palmer.\n\nPalmer fought in the war as a member of the Hampton Legion. His distinguished looks as a Southern gentleman were considered a perfect model for the soldier on the monument.\n\nThe design was an original concept by the women of the CMA. Theo Markwalter of Augusta, Georgia, was contracted to do the work. The monument was built from granite purchased in Winnsboro. Palmer’s image was molded and cast by Markwalter in a small town in Massachusetts.\n\nThe Confederate Monument stood in front of Courthouse Square until it was moved to the center of Memorial Plaza.\n\nPalmer had local connections. He was a great-uncle of Miss Ellen Chaplin, who served as superintendent of education for Orangeburg County in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 85: Elloree Training Center's roots reach back to 1939\n\nThe Elloree Training Center, home of the annual Elloree Trials horse racing event each year, got its start in 1939 when the land was purchased for the purpose of building a race track.\n\nOn July 25, 1940, Palmetto Racing Park Inc., as it was called then, officially opened with lancing tournaments and horse races, drawing a crowd of thousands.\n\nGambling was legal at the time but was halted in 1947 when the late Strom Thurmond was elected governor of South Carolina.\n\nHorse racing at the track halted, and Palmetto Racing Park fell silent.\n\nIn 1960, Phil Utman, a thoroughbred owner/trainer from Iowa, purchased the facility and revitalized it as Utman Training Center.\n\nUtman’s dream to revive horse racing at the track also spread to local Elloree leaders and civic organizations who arranged for the first Elloree Trials in 1962. The event has been going strong ever since.\n\nUtman Training Center eventually became Pine Hill Farm when it was sold to William Meaut, a Virginian, but it wasn’t long before Franklin “Goree” Smith purchased it.\n\nSmith has owned the facility that became Elloree Training Center since 1976.\n\nThe late Chris Antley of Elloree, a nationally known jockey, competed in several races at Elloree Training Center.\n\nContact the writer: mbrown@timesanddemocrat.com or 803-533-5545.\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 84: Four Hole Swamp drains area nearly 653 square miles\n\nThe expansive Four Hole Swamp crosses through a major portion of Orangeburg County as well as portions of Calhoun, Berkeley and Dorchester counties.\n\nFolklore has it that the name of “Four Hole” was given to the swamp because the water in it originates in “four” holes, or large pits, that bubble up from natural springs.\n\nOther stories of its origin say the swamp merely has four deeper spots in it, thus “four hole.”\n\nOne of the deeper portions is known as Goodbys Hole.\n\nThe Natural Resources Conservation Service describes Four Hole Swamp as originating in the Atlantic Southern Loam Plains and draining nearly 653 square miles, or roughly 418,000 acres.\n\nSignificant tributaries to Four Hole Swamp include Cowcastle Creek and Dean Swamp.\n\nSome of the early land grants to Orangeburgh District settlers were in the headwaters of Four Hole Swamp, at and below what is now the intersection of Belleville Road and U.S. Highway 176.\n\nMargaret Waters of the Orangeburgh German Swiss Genealogical Society has worked to identify early settlers. Among the properties dating 1735-1738 were grants to Peter Faure, Joshua Lockwood, Anna Maria Till, John Myer and Jacob Bruck.\n\nSlightly later grants went to Melchior Smith, Margaret Tenison, Jacob Heagler, Catherine Miller and Michael Smith. Of these people, John Myer and John Heagler were founders of lasting Orangeburg families.\n\nOthers like Jacob Lockwood were coastal residents who applied for land and quickly sold it. By the time of the 1790 census, the following resided along Four Hole Swamp: Daniel Kemmerley (Kemmerlin), Frederick Keller, Barbara Mourer (Moorer), Margaret Zimmerman, John Zimmerman, John Rush and William Whetstone.\n\nAll of these are familiar names, and in some cases, descendants of the founding families still live in the area.\n\nContact the writer: mbrown@timesanddemocrat.com or 803-533-5545.

The wooden rectangular building, complete with a tall steeple and bell, was built in 1896. The present brick sanctuary which includes many beautiful stained-glass windows and a very unique dome was built in 1917.\n\nThe dome includes stained-glass windows on each of its six sides, along with a large stained-glass display on its bottom. Lights were added to the dome in the 1990s to illuminate the stained-glass windows at night.\n\nFor the church, the dome serves as a permanent symbol of God’s love shinning forth into the world, a beacon for everyone to come and experience the love and hope found in Jesus.\n\n100 OBJECTS/ DAY 82: Cotton's been county crop for 200+ years\n\nThousands upon thousands of these “objects” are visible from one end of Orangeburg County to the other in the late summer each year.\n\nCotton was not extensively grown in Orangeburg County until 1802.\n\nWithin decades, cotton production increased rapidly and by 1850 it was the most important crop in the county.\n\nIn the late 1790s, Capt. Peter Gaillard purchased lands in Upper St. John’s Parish, which was considered Charleston County at the time, but is now Orangeburg County.\n\nHe initially sought to plant crops for consumption, but soon after the invention of the cotton gin in 1794, Gaillard planted cotton.\n\nHe’s credited with being the first planter in the region to successfully produce cotton.\n\nOn the lands that Gaillard purchased, he soon built a home: The Rocks Plantation in 1803, just outside of Eutawville.\n\nTo this day, The Rocks Plantation continues to farm cotton and is likely the oldest consistently operating farm in Orangeburg County.\n\nAbout 100 years ago, there were 129,053 acres of cotton planted in Orangeburg County.\n\nThe Farm Service Agency reported 35,331 acres of cotton were planted in Orangeburg County in 2013, with an average yield of 700 pounds per acre.\n\nContact the writer: mbrown@timesanddemocrat.com or 803-533-5545.

Dodge purchased it about 30 years ago and, like other stores in the Dodge’s Store chain, he thought a large the flag would be a nice addition to the business.\n\n“We think it is a nice reminder of the legacy of this country this day and any day,” Dodge said. “When we put it up, we got a lot of recognition. People are used to it now. It is not as novel as it was back then, but we enjoy the use of it.”\n\nDodge is not sure of the size of the current flag, but he says it has been reduced in size from a previous flag that used to don the pole.\n\n“The wind tears them up and flags that size are about $500 to $600 each,” Dodge said\n\nDodge said a lot more people used to see the flag back in the day.\n\n“We have been in Orangeburg a long time,” he said. “That was the big highway from Florida to New York. The bypass took a lot of it, but we are proud to be there.”\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 80: Cannons in plaza were patriot’s pride and joy\n\nMore than 230 years ago, the birthing pains of a young nation were felt in fierce fighting between American Patriots and British forces.\n\nOrangeburg was in the midst of it as the colonies fought their way toward independence from Great Britain.\n\nPositioned in Orangeburg’s Memorial Plaza are two cannons that are believed to have played vital roles in the Revolutionary War.\n\nCapt. Henry Felder, a native of Switzerland who had an unwavering love for his new country and a devotion to liberty, risked everything — including his own life — to answer the call to defend America.\n\nFelder, who married and had seven sons, was a patriot to the core.\n\nHe fought in the Indian War and also served as the foreman of the Orangeburgh Grand Jury.\n\nHe subsequently formed a militia to fight for freedom from England. The devotion he and his family demonstrated to the cause of liberty resulted in tragic personal losses for them. Felder’s homestead was burned twice by Tories.\n\nIt is speculated that Felder acquired approximately four cannons during his lifetime, but the two displayed today in Memorial Plaza in downtown Orangeburg were his pride and joy.\n\nUnder the command of General Thomas Sumter, Felder’s Militia Company — including seven of his sons — guided Sumter’s troops by way of Belleview Road, down Russell Street and into Orangeburgh village.\n\nThey fired cannons along the way and defeated the British militia in order to gain control of the Orangeburgh post.\n\nIn 1781, Felder would succumb to the wounds he suffered in artillery fire by British Tories as he defended his home of Orangeburgh.\n\nContact the writer: mbrown@timesanddemocrat.com or 803-533-5545.

Following an Israelite victory over the Philistines, Samuel set up a stone to commemorate the occasion and named it Ebenezer, saying, “Hitherto the Lord has helped us.”\n\nA history of the church reports that it was constructed on land donated by Mrs. Henry Gibson during the pastorate of the Rev. M.O. Owens. It was valued at $29,000 and had a seating capacity of 350.\n\nBricks made on the spot were used in construction of the building. At some time, they were painted white and remain so today.\n\nIn 1942, the Rev. J.M. Lane challenged church members to pay off the building’s indebtedness. Offerings covering the full sum were received on two consecutive Sundays.\n\nOver the years, Ebenezer has had a strong working relationship with the local public school system. In 1943, the local school burned, and classes were held in the church for the next year and a half.\n\nAlmost 20 years later, the school system returned the favor.\n\nIn 1962, the church building was declared unsafe and services were held in the school while extensive repairs were made.\n\nThe familiar building in Cordova is the third home of Ebenezer Baptist Church.\n\nA building constructed in 1831 was located at the site of the church cemetery about a mile and half from the current site. It was “constituted with nineteen members” and was pastored by John Hallman, according to the “History of Ebenezer Baptist Church 1831-1986.”\n\nAt some point, this building was pulled down to make room for another structure.\n\nThis second building, known as the “Old Church,” was a one-room frame building. The men sat on one side of the aisle and the women on the other. Curtains were used to divide off Sunday school rooms.\n\nThe “Old Church” was torn down and the lumber was used to build a home for Fred Smoak, whose house had been destroyed by fire.\n\n100 OBJECTS/Day 78: DAR marker honors Revolutionary War's Jeremiah Jones\n\nJust a few feet away from the Aiken County line in Orangeburg County stands a granite marker erected more than 90 years ago by the Jeremiah Jones Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution.\n\nThe marker is located on Ninety-Six Road, also known as John Nunn Highway, outside the North town limits.\n\nOn Feb. 28, 1917, the DAR organized a local chapter and named it in honor of Jeremiah Jones, a Revolutionary War patriot whose homestead was located nearby.\n\nAbout five years later, the local chapter placed the granite marker beside Old Ninety-Six Road.\n\nSen. James F. Byrnes delivered the formal address at the marker’s dedication.\n\nJones was born on Dec. 27, 1759, and he was about 22 when he enlisted in the Army while residing in the Orangeburgh District in 1781.\n\nHe initially served under Capt. John Stanfield and was under the leadership of Capt. James Farr when he was involved in the battles of Lynches Creek.\n\nJones also served under Colonels Wade and Sumter, then under Capt. Andrew Dubose and ultimately under General Francis Marion.\n\nThe Ninety-Six Road is also known as the Old Indian Trail because it was the main route connecting Cherokee villages in the Upstate with the English settlement of Charles Towne (Charleston) on the coast.\n\nContact the writer: mbrown@timesanddemocrat.com or 803-533-5545.

For 46 years, the Raylrode Daze Festivul has continued to offer those special people in Jennings’ life a chance to gather and celebrate the history that’s backdrop is “built on our little town within a town.”\n\nAs Jennings remembers the story, Branch Junction was built in the early 1970s by local men as a backdrop for the popular gunfights staged for the festival. In the first festival in 1969, as a form of entertainment, a group of local men decided to do a mock robbery of the town’s bank. As the villains came out of the bank, they were met by the sheriff and his deputies. An old-time western shoot-out ensued.\n\n“Of course, no one was hurt, but the crowds really seemed to enjoy the show. It was then decided that a place that depicted an old western town, as well as a softer place to land when shot, was needed. Therefore, Branch Junction was born,” Jennings said.\n\nAs the festival grew, so did Branch Junction. Each year a few more buildings were added. Eventually, a Grand Hotel complete with a stage for entertainment was added, along with a blacksmith shop that was mostly used for storage, giving Branch Junction the appearance of an old western town.\n\n“I remember there being a jail, bank, several stores, sheriff’s office, saloon and funeral parlor. In earlier years, the stage was a four-wheel farm trailer,” Jennings said.\n\nAs the years passed, the buildings would require maintenance and occasionally, some had to be torn down and rebuilt. During Hurricane Hugo, the top of the stage was blown off, but the festival went on.\n\nIn 2007, the blacksmith shop and the saloon were destroyed by fire. Some items used for the festival were also lost, along with many of the photographs from past festivals.\n\nThe in 2008, a devastating tornado ripped through Branchville, demolishing Branch Junction.\n\n“It was very upsetting to see the twisted wood and bent tin that was once our beloved Branch Junction,” Jennings said. “Only a few structures remained, and it was uncertain as to what the future of Branch Junction would be.”\n\nMany townspeople began working to secure funding to rebuild the venue. Funds from grants through the county and state were obtained, and a new Branch Junction rose from the ashes and was ready for the 40th annual festival that September.\n\nToday, Branch Junction consists of eight buildings that are rented to festival vendors to sell their wares during Raylrode Daze.\n\nOne building serves as the arts and crafts and concessions space, a jail, a sheriff’s office, a funeral parlor and a saloon.\n\nThe stage in Branch Junction showcases festival entertainers each year.\n\nCan Can dancers perform several times each day during the event, along with singers, dancers and bands. The popular shoot-outs are still performed by the Branch Junction Gunfighters.\n\n“Branch Junction is what makes Raylrode Daze so special,” Jennings said. “It’s what sets us apart from other festivals. Festival-goers bring their chairs to sit under the porches and enjoy the entertainment as well as reminiscence with old acquaintances that they may have not seen since last year’s festival.”\n\nContact the writer:kdavis@timesanddemocrat.com or 803-533-555.

Connor owned and operated Connor Plantation about two miles away.\n\nEarly school and state records actually refer to the school as “Crane Pond School,” but the leaders and members of the Santee Indian Organization, headquartered at 432 Bayview Street, have worked over the years to maintain the school’s name as “White Oak.”\n\nFor several years, the Santee Indian Organization, a state-recognized tribe, was housed in the former school.\n\nFamily records show that Frederick Connor’s daughter-in-law, Mary Elizabeth “Bessie” Murray Connor, began teaching at the Native American school in 1899, earning a salary of $6 a week. She was also provided a horse and buggy to travel from the family homestead to the school and back each day.\n\nThe school served students in first through eighth grades.\n\nDuring the decades of segregation when laws mandated that whites and blacks attend separate public schools, such was the case for the Native Americans.\n\nWhen Orangeburg County’s schools began to integrate during the early to mid-1960s, the building ceased to function as a public school.\n\nContact the writer: mbrown@timesanddemocrat.com or 803-533-5545.

City staff installed irrigation, lighting and landscaping as well as the Wall of Love, the Walk of Love and other walkways.\n\nA local brick mason and monument company donated their skills and labor.\n\nWhen the work was completed, it became the first Angel of Hope Garden in the state and the 100th in the world.\n\nIn 2011, the garden was recognized by the Municipal Association of South Carolina by winning the Municipal Achievement Award.\n\nSince 1994, Angels of Hope statues have been located around the U.S. and in Canada. The first was dedicated in Salt Lake City by Richard Paul Evans, author of the New York Times best-seller “The Christmas Box.”\n\nIn the fictional story he wrote for his two daughters, Evans referenced an angel monument that actually did exist in a Salt Lake City cemetery until it was destroyed by a flood. In response to the demand from grieving parents who lost children, Evans commissioned the creation of the first Angel of Hope.\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 74: Stockyards date back to pre-WWII, still in business\n\nAn Orangeburg livestock auction market is one the city’s best-kept secrets.\n\nOrangeburg Stockyards Inc. on Whaley Street, which dates back to the pre-World War II era, continues to operate today.\n\nOriginally called the Farmers’ Livestock Market, the market underwent a number of name changes before becoming Orangeburg Stockyards in the 1950s.\n\nOwned by Four Holes resident Steve Nash since 1990, the market auctions off cattle, hogs and goats.\n\nThe operation houses air-conditioned, roofed-in pens on about 1.5 acres. The animals are kept well fed for the traditional hour-long Wednesday auctions.\n\nEach animal has barn space reserved for it, and the livestock is listed by weight and breed.\n\nBuyers typically arrive as early as 7:30 a.m. on Wednesdays to participate in the 11 a.m. auction. The market starts receiving livestock on Tuesdays in preparation for the auction.\n\nOn average, Orangeburg Stockyards Inc. sells nearly 550 head of cattle a week, about 200 to 250 hogs and almost 50 goats. Sellers typically get paid immediately when their animal is picked up.\n\nWhaley Street became the hub of the early Orangeburg livestock industry.\n\nThe Orangeburg Packing Plant opened on Whaley in 1918, and the plant is believed to have been the first place where meat was ever shipped from the state.\n\nThe packing plant closed during the Great Depression in the 1930s and reopened following the Depression before permanently going out of business in 1969.\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 73: Tower gives firefighters chance to hone skills\n\nIt took years of planning and effort, but in 2011 Orangeburg County Fire District firefighters were able to begin practicing in their own fire training tower/burn facility.\n\nThe $778,000 tower became operational in June 2011, with a grand opening in the fall of 2011.\n\nThe 40-foot drill tower/burn facility is located at the fire complex headquarters on U.S. Highway 301 near the intersection with Interstate 26. The building is about 25 feet wide and 75 feet long. The tower is about 40 feet wide and stands five stories.\n\nThe training facility allows firefighters to hone their skills fighting various types of blazes within a controlled environment.\n\nThe multipurpose facility is used for search and rescue training and live fire burns. Additional props are put in place, allowing firefighters to jump off the building and train in removing roof structures in the event of a fire.\n\nThree years after its opening, the tower has helped train about 400 firefighters from across the state as well as officers from agencies such as the Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office and the State Law Enforcement Division.\n\nOrangeburg County Fire System Coordinator Gene Ball said the fire tower has helped lower Insurance Services Office ratings for the county.\n\nInsurance companies rate fire departments and communities on their fire service infrastructure development. Lower ISO ratings for fire departments typically mean lower insurance premiums for the homeowners they serve.\n\nThe structure also allows firefighters to receive training closer to home.\n\n“It is being utilized regularly,” Ball said.\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 72: Monument honors students slain in ‘Orangeburg Massacre’\n\nA monument on South Carolina State University’s campus serves as a lasting tribute to the three students who died in the incident that became known as the “Orangeburg Massacre.”\n\nSamuel Hammond, a freshman football player from Florida; Henry Smith, a sophomore from Marion, and Delano Middleton, a 17-year-old whose mother worked at the college, were killed on Feb. 8, 1968.\n\nOn that night, S.C. Highway Patrol troopers opened fire on a crowd of protesters following three nights of escalating racial tension over efforts to desegregate the All-Star Triangle Bowl. There were 28 other people who were injured.\n\nA year after the incident, the Smith-Hammond-Middleton monument was erected honoring those who died. Each year on the anniversary, S.C. State holds a memorial service in honor of the three students. A torch is lit at the monument as part of the ceremony.\n\nIn 2003, then-S.C. Gov. Mark Sanford formally apologized for the incident.\n\n“I think it’s appropriate to tell the African-American community in South Carolina that we don’t just regret what happened in Orangeburg 35 years ago — we apologize for it,” Sanford said in a statement.\n\nA building on campus is also named for Smith, Hammond and Middleton.\n\nIt was following the commemoration of the 45th anniversary of the event that Middleton’s friend and classmate Sam Haynes noticed that Middleton’s middle initial was incorrectly engraved in the monument as “B.” While Middleton was affectionately known as “Bump” by family and friends, his middle name was actually Herman.\n\nThe monument was corrected in 2013, with S.C. State President Thomas J. Elzey thanking then-Mayor Paul Miller and the city for following through with the work to correct the monument.\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 71: Fountain at college donated by O-C Tech Foundation in 2007\n\nVisitors and students since 2007 have been welcomed to Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College by a semi-circle fountain located in front of the Student and Community Life Center.\n\nThe fountain was presented to the college by the OCtech Foundation in honor of its 30th anniversary, according to Executive Director Faith McCurry.\n\n“We wanted to create a landmark on campus visible from Highway 601 that presented an inviting presence and provided a place for students to go and relax,” she said.\n\n“It’s a welcoming point in the middle of campus for visitors and new students and is visible day and night. It’s lit at night,” McCurry said.\n\nThe fountain has been part of numerous community celebrations.\n\nSeveral years ago, the water in the fountain was colored pink in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Week. Some years before that, it was dyed green in observance of St. Patrick’s Day.\n\nThis May, visitors to the campus may have been surprised to see the fountain filled with yellow rubber ducks. Each duck represented a $20 donation to a scholarship drive, McCurry said.\n\nThe fountain was designed and constructed by Hay Hill Services.\n\n“It was very important to the Foundation that local people be involved in the construction and design of the fountain,” McCurry said.\n\nA local firm also landscaped the area around the fountain, she said.\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 70: $2.9M accelerator key tool in treating cancer at RMC\n\nA machine standing approximately 9 feet tall by nearly 15 feet long and weighing more than 25,000 pounds is an essential tool used in treating cancerous tumors at the H. Filmore Mabry Center for Cancer Care at the Regional Medical Center.\n\nWith the completion of the expansion of the Mabry Center in the summer of 2013, RMC continues to offer access to the most advanced radiation therapy. A new $2.9 million Trilogy linear accelerator by Varian Medical Systems was part of the expansion.\n\nThe equipment generates high energy X-rays by using microwave energy to accelerate electrons to nearly the speed of light. As the electrons reach maximum speed, they collide with a metal target to release photons (or X-rays). The accelerator rotates around the patient to deliver the radiation treatments from nearly any angle.\n\nThe linear accelerator is outfitted with an important accessory called a multi-leaf collimator. This device, which has 120 computer-controlled mechanical “leaves” or “fingers,” is used to shape the beam of radiation so that it conforms to the three-dimensional shape of the tumor.\n\nRMC’s $8 million expansion of the Mabry Center also features new medical and radiation oncology space, including additional exam rooms, technology and replacement of the heating and cooling system.\n\nThe Mabry Center was expanded to better accommodate the care and treatment needs of patients and to help keep patients in Orangeburg and slow the out-migration of patients. An out-migration of approximately 14 percent has been cited.\n\nLocated at 1161 Cook Road, Orangeburg, the Mabry Center was built in 1992 to treat 400 patients a year. In 2012, more than 1,000 patients were treated and more than 5,000 radiation treatments were performed.\n\nAlong with the second linear accelerator, which was added to handle increasing patient volumes for radiation, the 9,696-square-foot addition to the Mabry Center for Cancer Care has also allowed for patient, family and support areas.\n\nThe RMC paid for the project using a portion of a $25 million borrowing package. The multi-phase project was done without interrupting patient care.\n\nFor more information about the Mabry Center for Cancer Care at RMC, call 803-395-4600, toll free in S.C. at 800-476-3377, ext. 4600 or visit www.trmchealth.org.\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 69: Intergovernmental complex provides multiple services\n\nFour years ago, Holly Hill and Orangeburg County officials held a public hearing to discuss plans to renovate the vacant former Holly Hill Middle School.\n\nThe plans called for transforming the structure into a multi-purpose building providing both county and city services.\n\nEarlier this year, the fruits their labor were realized when the new $4 million intergovernmental complex, located at 8423 Old State Road, opened to the public.\n\nThe building houses Holly Hill Town Hall and the Holly Hill Police Department as well as the Department of Health and Environmental Control’s Home Health Services and clinicians.\n\nThe Holly Hill Branch of the Orangeburg County Library operates in the facility five days a week.\n\nThe balance of the project, approximately $3 million, was funded through grants and loans through the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and other funding came from county’s capital projects penny sales tax monies.\n\nIn the mid-1920s, Holly Hill High School was located at the site. Eventually, with modifications and renovations through the years, it became Holly Hill Middle School.\n\nThe school closed in 2004 after the district’s two high schools merged into one — Lake Marion High School — and the middle school students and staff relocated to the former Holly Hill High School campus.\n\nOrangeburg County purchased the building from Orangeburg Consolidated School District Three for $10 in 2007.\n\nThe building has received recognition on the state level, earning honorable mention this month in the J. Mitchell Graham Memorial Award presentation. The South Carolina Association of Counties presents the award annually to recognize counties that address community challenges, implement operational improvements or enhance their citizens’ quality of life in a unique way.\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 68: Sign reminder of one-time radio station\n\n“Serving 100,000 Radio Families Covering Ten Lower Central South Carolina Counties.”\n\nAlthough the station can no longer be found on the dial, the message is broadcast on the exterior of the building that once housed Orangeburg’s WTND Radio.\n\nThe building, which is located on Memorial Plaza, was home to the radio station from the late 1940s to the late 1970s.\n\nJ. Izlar Sims, son of then-Times and Democrat owner James L. Sims, is credited with putting the radio station on the air. It was owned and operated by The T&D and the Dixie Home Building.\n\nIzlar Sims was also credited with bringing the first talking picture to Orangeburg in the late 1920s.\n\nWTND aired an unusual play-by-play account of afternoon games of both the National and American Leagues.\n\nThe announcers of the particular network carried by WTND were not allowed to broadcast from where the game was being played. Instead, the announcers were situated in studios where the actions of the game would be transmitted over teletype.\n\nSurrounded with a variety of sound effect instruments, all the sounds that would be heard from the game would be focused into the announcer’s mike. There was no way the listener could tell the background noise from the real thing.\n\nThe building was built in 1909 by W.C. Wolfe as a 100-room hotel. At five stories high, the hotel was the second-tallest building in the state at the time. It had electric lights, an electric elevator and fans.\n\nA 1941 fire destroyed the two upper floors of the hotel.\n\nAt the time, the first floor was occupied by the law office of Julian S. Wolfe, the Hutto and Haddock Barber Shop and Walker & Bowman.\n\nThe building has also housed Sears and a Belk-Hudson thrift store. It later housed E-Mart, which closed in January 2005.\n\nThe building was purchased in February 2006 with plans to make it the headquarters of a church ministry. In 2010, the Orangeburg Department of Public Safety put a notice on the building deeming it unsafe to enter.\n\nToday, the roof of the entire building has collapsed. The building has been condemned by the city.\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 67: Big building rises above small town\n\nThe three-story building in the heart of Norway towers above everything around it. It has also been called the tallest building between Columbia and Savannah, and Orangeburg and Aiken.\n\nThe building at the corner of Norway Road and U.S. Highway 321 was built in 1926 for use as a bank by B.B. Williams, who also helped build Norway’s Willow Swamp Baptist Church. Williams was the grandfather of the late state Senate President Pro Tem Marshall B. Williams.\n\nThe building has vaults on the main floor and in the basement, apartments on the second floor and the third floor was added for the Masons.\n\nWhen the building was used as a bank, an elevator transport system would drop money bags from the bank’s first floor vault to its cellar vault.\n\nThe building, which has 16-foot ceilings, has had a number of uses over the years.\n\nThe second-floor apartments were often used by newly married couples.\n\nIt was rented out for some time as warehouse space, but has also housed a cotton brokerage, a fertilizer business and doctors’ and dentists’ offices.\n\nThe last bank in the building was the former South Carolina Bank and Trust and the last business was Norway Insurance Company. The building is now used for storage.\n\nDanny Covington, the current owner, says he has not been able to confirm if the building is the tallest for miles and miles but says it is 52 feet tall.\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 66: Opened in 1961, Orangeburg Drag Strip still the place to race\n\nThe roar of engines has been heard at Orangeburg Drag Strip since its construction and opening in 1961.\n\nAt that time, there was no timing equipment. Everything was started by a man getting out in front of the cars and dropping his hands. Then, off to the races they went!\n\nThere was no guard rail to protect spectators from the cars back then. The original track featured racing over a quarter-mile, with another quarter-mile of stopping distance.\n\nIn 1972, brothers Zane, Tommy and Jimmy DeWitt purchased the track from original owners T.J. Ashe, Ezel Hutto and Nick Davis.\n\nThe DeWitt brothers installed guard rails and brought in timing equipment that was built in Leesville. It was a black box that sat in the tower; a calculator was used to subtract the difference from each car’s dial in.\n\nDuring this time, racing took off with cars getting faster running the quarter-mile in the high 10-second range.\n\nThe track saw the likes of the DeWitts, Houston Platt, Zeigler Chevrolet, the Brickles at Orangeburg Auto, Buddy Boozer, Sonny Tindal and the Smiths of North.\n\nThe DeWitts started what is now called “grudge racing.” A driver would pay $1 to get in and another $1 to run his car.\n\nDon Garrick purchased Orangeburg Drag Strip from the DeWitt brothers in 1982. Garrick continued with the Thursday night racing, along with Sunday bracket racing. He also started running motorcycle events.\n\nGarrick sold the track to Charles and Johnny Dowey. The Doweys tore up the old asphalt and converted the track to all concrete for better traction.\n\nIn 2001, Jimmy and Zane DeWitt re-purchased the track and continued to feature similar races for the next five years.\n\nIn 2006, the current owner, Buddy Boozer, purchased the track with the intention of refurbishing it.\n\nWith the help of the Doweys and their heavy equipment, the track was completely torn up as well as the buildings on the site.\n\nThe only exception was the tower, which the Doweys had installed from a prison they had demolished in Columbia.\n\nA new racing surface, concrete guard rails and a shut-down area were put in place.\n\nNew timing equipment, scoreboards, a cafe and restrooms have since been added.\n\nToday, the track is home to Pro Modified drag racing, bracket racing, grudge racing, junior dragsters and bike racing.\n\nOrangeburg Drag Strip is located at 194 Dragstrip Road in Neeses.\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 65: Building housing Claflin’s museum built by students\n\nDuring the 1940s, legendary boxer Joe Louis forever helped to raise the profile of African-American athletes in the realm of sports. A decade later, the late Arthur Rose began his quest to play a similar role for African-American artists on Claflin University’s campus in Orangeburg.\n\nRose, a 1950 graduate of Claflin and the university’s first art major, was known as the “dean of black artists in South Carolina.” He served as chairman of Claflin’s art department from 1952-1976, making the university’s art department among the best in the state. Claflin was the only institution in the state where African-Americans could get a degree in art until the mid-sixties.\n\nIn December 1999, the former Lee Library building at Claflin was named the Arthur Rose Museum. The library had formerly served as Rose’s art studio.\n\nClaflin graduate William Wilson Cooke was the architect who supervised the building’s construction by students in 1898.\n\nStudents fired the bricks in kilns dug on the campus. The library was named after Priscilla E. Lee Bennett, who provided the construction funds.\n\nFor his design, Cooke used a unique multi-sided, T-shaped plan and characterized the building’s exterior with red brickwork, terra cotta medallions and window details.\n\nIn 2005, the project received the South Carolina Historic Preservation Award from the Office of the Governor, the Palmetto Trust for Historic Preservation and the South Carolina Department of Archives and History.\n\nThe museum is not the only historic building on Claflin’s campus.\n\nTingley Hall, the main administration building, was named in honor of Malvena Tingley of Providence, R.I., whose husband, Herbert, donated the money for its construction in 1908. Cooke also designed Tingley Hall, which contained 14 classrooms and an assembly hall.\n\nOriginally used for the institution’s English and pedagogical department, Tingley Hall has served as Claflin’s administrative building since a fire destroyed the main campus building in 1913.\n\nToday, Tingley Hall houses the Office of the President as well as the provost, human resources, finance, public relations, IT, institutional development, auditor and other offices that function as the collective heartbeat of the university.\n\nThe building was renovated and upgraded about 11 years ago. Tingley’s copper-clad cupola is Claflin University’s most-recognized symbol. The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.\n\nMinister’s Hall was constructed in 1919 and was used as the college dining hall until the fall of 1964. It is the third oldest building on campus. Minister’s’ Hall is now home to the performing arts center and the Ernest A. Finney Jr. Library, named in honor of the Claflin graduate and South Carolina’s first African-American chief justice.\n\nWhile it was being used as a storage facility, Minister’s Hall caught fire in 1994. The fire damaged the interior of the building and prompted several people to call for the structure to be demolished.\n\nUniversity officials opted instead to restore the building to its original integrity.\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 64: Fish hatchery plays vital role in preserving state's aquatic life\n\nA federally supported facility occupying approximately 250 acres, the Orangeburg National Fish Hatchery has been described as a well-kept secret in the community.\n\nAs one of two federally supported hatcheries in South Carolina — the other being on Wadmalaw Island — the fish hatchery has played a vital role in preserving the state’s aquatic life and one of its largest recreational activities: fishing.\n\nThe hatchery has two units. The main station is located on Lakeview Street just outside the city limits of Orangeburg, while the substation is on Cannon Bridge Road south of Orangeburg.\n\nThe hatchery is a warm-water fish hatchery, where fish are reared in approximately 27 earthen ponds in temperatures ranging from 60 degrees to 85 degrees.\n\nThe hatchery produces a variety of freshwater fish, including striped bass, redbreast sunfish, bluegill sunfish and shortnosed sturgeon. They are stocked in reservoirs, lakes and coastal streams across the Southeast, according to the U.S. National Fish and Wildlife Service’s website.\n\nFederal funding has helped with structural issues at the hatchery, which completed an extensive renovation project on the dam at its Cannon Bridge Road substation in the early 2000s, along with the construction of an underground culvert at its main station on Stonewall Jackson Boulevard to assist with drainage for the area’s watershed.\n\nTo help enlighten the public on the importance of preservation and conservation, the Fish Hatchery sponsors tours and special fishing days for kids, senior citizens and those with special needs.\n\nFor more information on the various programs at the Orangeburg Fish Hatchery, call 803-534-4828.\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 63: Spirit of 5&10s alive in Ferse's\n\nStep inside the doors of one of Orangeburg’s oldest businesses and all your senses will be tested by everything from the savory aroma of freshly popped popcorn, to the creaking plank flooring beneath your feet, to the vast variety of merchandise, including a framed picture of the Last Supper, sewing notions, dry goods, BB guns and a Radio Flyer wagon.\n\nNo wonder for years it was called “Orangeburg’s favorite store”.\n\nWelcome to Ferse’s 5&10.\n\nThe store was founded by T.B. Ferse Sr. in 1906. The gentleman was actually a farmer who sold produce at the corner of Broughton and Russell streets and later went into the retail business.\n\nIn 1985, the store was about to go out of business as its competition, like Woods and Kress, did years before.\n\nHowever, that same year Roy Chandler purchased it from its previous owners, Santee Wholesale.\n\nChandler was no stranger to the dime store business, having worked for S.H. Kress for 30 years.\n\nHis reputation was such that on a particular Saturday morning he received a phone call from a Mr. Sam Walton, who offered him a position with his company.\n\nChandler turned down the offer.\n\nAccording to the Russell Street businessman, the term 5&10 was coined by Sam Kress in 1896 when he opened his first store in Mephis, Tenn.\n\nIn those days, the store was split in half. Everything on one side was five cents, while the other side contained 10 cent items.\n\nTo this day, the Orangeburg business sells a few items at the 5 and 10 cent price points.\n\nThe locals enjoy the daily specials that the inside diner serves — from the post roast to Friday’ fish.\n\nIt also provides a variety of services that have helped Ferse’s 5&10 survive the dollar stores as well as the big box stores.\n\nAnd while you are cruising the aisles, treat yourself to an Icee — it’s the only store in town that still serves the brand.\n\nAnd you might just possibly find that hard-to-find item that has eluded you for years.\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 62: Community center’s solar panels reduce town’s utility costs\n\nThe small town of Woodford boasts of a big way to save energy.\n\nIn 2011, dozens of solar panels were installed on the roof of the Woodford Community Center. The addition of the panels has essentially reduced the town’s utility bill to zero.\n\nThe solar panels were installed by Sunstore Solar Energy Solutions of Greenville. They work by converting sunlight into energy to operate the community center.\n\nAny unused power is sold back to South Carolina Electric & Gas Co.\n\nWith a population of about 185, the town applied for a federal Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant of approximately $45,000 to make all of the improvements.\n\nThe life expectancy of the solar panels is more than 50 years, and the investment in the panels will pay for itself in 20 years.\n\nWhile Woodford still has to purchase electricity from SCE&G, the panels have significantly reduced the town’s utility bill.\n\nn Contact the writer: mbrown@timesanddemocrat.com or 803-533-5545.

John Matthews and Brad Hutto wanted to tap into the potential of the interstate and highway network as an ideal place for economic development.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the county started promoting the area formed by the interstates and U.S. 301 as the “Global Logistics Triangle,” which it eventually trademarked.\n\nWith the widening of the Panama Canal expected to bring larger ships into the Port of Charleston, the area is seen as ripe for distribution centers, light manufacturing and other transportation-related businesses.\n\nIn addition to the interstates, two rail lines pass through the triangle. The triangle also has the needed utilities and infrastructure for economic development.\n\nSeeing the potential for growth, the South Carolina Department of Transportation plans to make improvements to the I-95-U.S. 301 interchange, including modifying it from a partial-access interchange to a full-access interchange. The $41 million upgrade aims to accommodate the anticipated increase in traffic generated by the Jafza Magna Park, a planned industrial mega-site.\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 60: Old schoolhouse continues its service\n\nA renovated two-room schoolhouse in the Santee Town Hall complex once served generations of students at its original location of Parler, a couple of miles from Santee towards Elloree along Old Number Six Highway.\n\nBack in 1995, the Santee Development Association led efforts to move the old boarded-up schoolhouse from its setting in Parler to 176 Brooks Boulevard, where it is in use today.\n\nThe school dates back to the late 1800s, measures 2,100 square feet and is crafted from heart pine.\n\nNow, fully renovated with its original hardwood floors salvaged and broken windows replaced, it serves as Santee Cultural Arts and Visitors Center.\n\nU.S. Congressman James Clyburn has a representative in the building a few hours during the week to serve the public.\n\nOutside of the renovated schoolhouse is a bell, which is original to the building when it was in Parler.\n\nThe Old Parler Schoolhouse is also a point of interest on the S.C. Heritage Corridor that crosses the state from east to west.\n\nThe building is owned and maintained by the Town of Santee.\n\nContact the writer: mbrown@timesanddemocrat.com or 803-533-5545.

William T. Sherman and his Union troops marched into Orangeburg near the present-day Orangeburg County Fine Arts Center on Feb. 12, 1865.\n\nWhile in Orangeburg, his troops burned the courthouse, the jail, some of the stores and bales of cotton. Sherman made his command post at Judge Thomas Glover’s home, which is still located on Whitman Street.\n\nAccording to “The Writings of Marion Salley,” published in 1970, the area up Goff Avenue was known as “Camp Field” for both Confederate and Union troops at different times during the war.\n\nThe First and Fifth South Carolina Volunteers spent time on the “Camp Field” from May 1861 through April 1862.\n\nWhile encamped, Gen. Johnson Hagood’s regiment marched to the Orangeburg Female College and donated a regimental flag to the ladies of the school.\n\nThe Orangeburg Female College was located on the site of the present-day Claflin University. In 1869, the Methodists purchased the land and the buildings of the Orangeburg Female College, thus creating Claflin University.\n\nIn February 1865, the Union Troops marched into Orangeburg and ironically camped in the same location as the Confederates did in 1861. How that site was selected is a mystery.\n\nThe Union troops were composed of mostly black soldiers with white officers. In a diary of Miss Mary Rowe, she writes: “This dreadful day has come, alas. The streets of our beloved village are thronged with Negro soldiers. At the corner of each street is a darkey, black as the ace of spades (eyes reminding one of an egg in a pot of coffee), as a guard.”\n\nSalley writes, “Years after the withdrawal of the Negro Troops, it was rumored that much money had been buried on this old camping ground, and time and time again native Negroes spaded up parts of the field. Then was spread a report that some of the New York soldiers had returned and they unearthed the money which they had hidden before they left.\n\n“The land, which had previously been acquired by Thomas B. Whaley, was sold by him in 1876 to Robert Copes, afterward the county treasurer, who was robbed and murdered in the 1890s. Mr. Copes sold the old field to Wikes Sawyer, and nearly a half century ago it was purchased, cut into building lots, and sold to the Negroes by Dr. M.G. Salley. For years it was the height of ambition for farm laborers of the community to save enough money to buy a lot and build a home ‘on Brooklyn.’”\n\nToday, the old “Camp Field” is known as “New Brookland.”\n\nRichard Reid is president of the Orangeburg Historical and Genealogical Society. His mission is researching Orangeburg history, with a particular emphasis on the role of African-Americans in that history.\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 58: Statue reminder of bulldog qualities in SCSU students\n\nIt was the fall of 1927 when the South Carolina State Agriculture and Mechanical Institute’s student newspaper, The Collegian, conducted a poll of students to determine what mascot they preferred to represent the college.\n\nThe nominees were: tiger, bear, wildcat, lion, bulldog and greyhound, said Dr. William Hine, a retired South Carolina State University history professor. Hine has recently written a history of S.C. State.\n\nThe bulldog won because of its “fighting tenacity.” And although the institution’s name has changed to South Carolina State University, the mascot has remained.\n\nThe university has two Bulldog statues that grace its campus.\n\nOne stands sentinel, watching those who enter and exit the campus. Standing four feet tall and weighing 1,200 pounds, the “Big Bulldog on Campus” wears a scowl mean enough to put fear in an Aggie or Wildcat.\n\nThe statue was unveiled in August 2003 at the main entrance on M. Maceo Nance Highway.\n\nSculpted by Steve Zouras of Irmo with the assistance of several people, the large, gray Bulldog took the artist three weeks to complete. He modeled the sculpture after the smaller version located in front of the Donma Administration Building, a landmark that aims to capture the spirit of the university.\n\nUpon the unveiling of the statue, former S.C. State President Dr. Andrew Hugine Jr. cited the bulldog’s stability, vigor, strength and courage as virtues the university’s athletic teams, student body and staff are encouraged to display.\n\nThe smaller statue was put in place in the early 1980s during the administration of M. Maceo Nance.\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 57: Tower represents water system's role in west\n\nA pure spring of mineral water bubbling from the ground attracted pioneers scattered throughout the western part of Orangeburg County in the 1800s. They formed a community that was aptly called Silver Springs, which grew to become the small town of Neeses.\n\nThe desire to give everyone in the rural area clean drinking water led to the organization of the Silver Springs Water District in 1967.\n\nHenry M. “Nick” Chaplin, who was mayor of Neeses for 26 years, set about bringing water service to the people in the western part of Orangeburg County.\n\nHe submitted a water services proposal seven times to state officials before it was finally accepted, according to a souvenir book published for the town of Neeses’ Centennial Celebration in 1993.\n\nAn election on May 25, 1971, resulted in a 133-0 vote in favor of the creation of a rural community water district.\n\nOn Feb. 3, 1972, the S.C. General Assembly approved the act creating the water district, which originally served the towns of Neeses and Livingston. The new water district began service to 117 customers in 1975.\n\nThe original 100,000-gallon tank was placed between Neeses and Livingston.\n\nIn 2000, Silver Springs became only the second water system in the state to receive a special federal grant of $2.4 million via the U.S. Rural Development Administration. The project has also been funded through the Orangeburg County one-cent capital improvements sales tax.\n\nSilver Springs was serving 570 customers in 2010. The grant meant an increase of another 250 to 300.\n\nThe Silver Springs Water District now serves more than 1,000 customers. The district serves areas including Bolentown, Springfield, Livingston, Neeses and North.\n\nThe town of Norway is the latest to consider purchasing water from the district.\n\nSilver Springs also has the distinction of being named RDA’s “Water System That Most Exemplifies the Water 2000 Initiative in S.C.” The initiative’s aim: providing clean, safe and affordable drinking water and improved fire protection to citizens.\n\nThe district now covers a service area of at least 133 square miles with approximately 260 miles of water main lines and more than 250 fire hydrants, three groundwater wells and a maximum production capability of approximately 1 million gallons per day.\n\nThe four elevated storage tanks in Silver Springs Water District also hold a combined capacity of 600,000 gallons.\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 56: Orangeburg County Fairgrounds carry century of memories\n\nThe Orangeburg County Fair was organized on July 1, 1911, when a group of Orangeburg-area citizens met at the county courthouse.\n\nAccording to the memories of longtime fair Manager Sam Fogle, “People were hungry for the opportunity to gather together, display their wares and enjoy the fellowship at the center of our county.”\n\nFootball games, both high school and college, were played at the Orangeburg County Fairgrounds.\n\nAccording to Fogle’s notes, the first night high school football game was played at the fairgrounds. The late Tim Stroman, who served many years as secretary and treasurer of the association, played on the Orangeburg High School team with Sumter as its opponent.\n\nBig Thursday games featured area college teams, notably USC vs. The Citadel.\n\nThe American Legion played all its home games at the fairgrounds until Mirmow Field was built.\n\nThis fall will bring the 104th edition of the Orangeburg County Fair.\n\nSeveral changes and additions have been implemented:\n\n* The Shriners will take on the Kiwanis Steakhouse near the fair’s entrance.\n\n* Quilt and fancy work will be housed in the arena building.\n\n* The field crop area is receiving a makeover.\n\n* Kid Zone, for children under age 4, will have a play area in the arts building.\n\n* Petting zoo.\n\n* Large animal zoo.\n\n* Gem mining.\n\n* NASCAR theme throughout the fair.\n\nThe Orangeburg County Fair runs Sept. 29-Oct. 5.\n\n100 OBJECTS/ DAY 55: Chapel of Hope offers small place for worship\n\nEdisto Memorial Gardens offers visitors a place to get away from the hustle and bustle of daily life to relax in the beauty of nature.\n\nA small white chapel complements the meditative atmosphere, providing garden visitors a chance to reflect on nature’s God.\n\nThe Chapel of Hope was given by Mr. and Mrs. Henry Stuckey as a gift to the community.\n\nThe couple wished to commemorate the bicentennial of the United States in 1976 by donating the non-denominational chapel to the city.\n\nThe building was completed and dedicated in May 1977.\n\nA World War II veteran, Stuckey was a retired Orangeburg businessman who for years operated Stuckey Motor Co. and the Orangeburg News Co.\n\nStuckey initially wanted to call it the Chapel of Home, but it has always been called the Chapel of Hope instead.\n\nThe chapel is a popular place for weddings. It can hold 12 people.\n\nThe Orangeburg Parks and Recreation Department maintains the chapel, which operates on seasonal hours. The chapel is currently open on weekdays from around 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. on weekends. Hours will change as the daylight hours shorten in the fall and winter months.\n\nThere is no admission charge.\n\nThe Parks and Recreation Department asks that it be notified in advance of any formal events so that staff can ensure the chapel is clean and ready. Call 803-533-6020.\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 54: Judge’s home was spared Sherman’s fire\n\nThe courthouse in the center of town was on fire, the railroad depot was ordered torched. Several businesses were destroyed in perhaps the most chaotic and frightening night in Orangeburg’s history.\n\nIt was Feb. 12, 1865 when Union Gen. William Sherman’s 17th Army Corps, one of four corps sweeping across the Palmetto State, entered Orangeburg after forcing a few hundred defenders from the banks of the Edisto River.\n\nSherman passed orders to destroy the railroad from Orangeburg to the Congaree River. All cotton was to be burned.\n\nIn the chaos, a prominent Orangeburg residence was spared the flames: Judge Glover’s home.\n\nThe residence that originally faced Russell Street was the home of Thomas Worth Glover, a lawyer, state legislator and circuit court judge. Along with three others from Orangeburg, Glover was also an original signer of the South Carolina Ordinance of Session in 1860.\n\nGlover was born on Christmas Eve, 1796 in Goose Creek. While a teacher in 1817, he studied law, eventually being named to the Orangeburg bar. He served in the state legislature until 1852, when he was elected a circuit court judge.\n\nIt was during his tenure in the legislature that he built the home that now faces Whitman Street. Completed in 1846, the two-story home is of a style called “plantation,” a conservative form of structure along the lines of Federal architecture.\n\nAs war clouds spread across the nation in the 1850s, Glover would add his name along with the 168 other delegates to sign the South Carolina Ordinance of Secession on Dec. 20, 1860. Gen. David Jamison, a neighbor, brother-in-law and president of the Secession Convention, later assigned Glover to a committee tasked with writing a new state constitution.\n\nThe war saw brilliant victories for the South early on. But the Southern states weren’t prepared for a war of attrition, which brought the conflict to the streets of Orangeburg on a cold February night.\n\nHistorians say Glover’s second wife, Louisa D. (Carrere) Wilson, may have been Sherman’s only defeat in Orangeburg. Acquainted with the Union general prior to the war, the lady of the house reminded Sherman he acted like a gentleman when they met in Charleston and she expected him to continue to behave that way.\n\nThe Glover home was one of the few that, while sustaining damage, still stood after the invading forces departed.\n\nJudge Glover died in Orangeburg 19 years after that confrontation in his living room between the Union army and his wife. At the time of his death, he was dean of South Carolina College, having been in the legal profession for more than 64 years.\n\nContact the writer: 803-533-5516 and rwalker@timesanddemocrat.

A large water tank with steam-driven pumps and a woodshed supplied fuel to the wood-burning locomotives traveling the route.\n\nThe town’s name was legally changed to Rowesville in 1889.\n\nCattle Creek Campground was named to the National Register of Historic Places on May 19, 1983.\n\nAlthough local tradition had it that Cattle Creek Campground was established in 1786, the National Register nomination form states it’s likely that the campground was not functional until the early 1800s.\n\nThe tradition of campmeeting is commonly believed to have been born in Kentucky or Tennessee about 1799-1800, and to have first appeared in South Carolina about 1802, according to the nomination form.\n\n“Minutes of the quarterly meetings of the Orangeburg Circuit of the Methodist Church show that on August 7, 1819, the third quarterly meeting of the circuit was held at Cattle Creek, but give no indication of whether it was considered to be a campmeeting ground at that time; no records of earlier meetings of the circuit are believed to exist,” according to the document.\n\nThe nomination form goes on to state that, “The first known reference to a camp ground at Cattle Creek is found in an agreement between George Summers Sr. and the Trustees of the Methodist Episcopal Church at Cattle Creek entered into on 16 July 1833 to donate property for ‘an Encamping Ground, a parcel of the land known as the present encampment and surrounding the land on which the church now stands.’”\n\nCattle Creek Campground consists of 36 cabins, called “tents,” arranged in a wide semi-circle around an open pavilion structure known as the “stand” or “tabernacle.” At the northwest end of the campmeeting ground is Cattle Creek United Methodist Church. Between the church and the tabernacle is a cemetery.\n\nThe campground burned in 1898 and was gradually rebuilt over the next several decades.\n\nCattle Creek is one of only three Methodist campmeeting grounds remaining in South Carolina. Significant for its association with the early history of Methodism in South Carolina, Cattle Creek Campground is also notable as a surviving example of a social institution important in rural America during the 19th century.\n\nThe tents, so named because the first campers and worshippers stayed in cloth tents and lean-tos made from limbs and branches, are built of rough, unpainted lumber, have gable roofs covered with metal or composition shingles, and generally measure about 20 feet by 30 feet. Each tent contains two rooms downstairs with dirt floors and one or two rooms upstairs, which are reached by a small stairway or ladder. All of the tents have porches with shed roofs.\n\nThe cooking is done outdoors at the rear of the tent over an open fire. In the center of the campground is the tabernacle, an open shed about 56 feet by 81 feet with a metal, gabled hip roof.\n\nIn addition to setting aside a week for worship and spiritual reflection, visitors to Cattle Creek Campground today now also regard campmeeting as a time to relax, talk and share meals with relatives and friends.\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 52: Sign lets travelers know Springfield is a hoppin’ place\n\nSPRINGFIELD — Travelers heading into this mall Orangeburg County town on Highway 4 may have spotted a sign beside the road with a little frog on it.\n\nThe frog, more than just a symbol of the amphibious life that abounds throughout the rural region, is representative of Springfield’s unique festival that spans more than four decades.\n\nThe town is probably best known for its Governor’s Frog Jump, which was held for the first time in 1966.\n\nThe festival actually began in Columbia in 1966, when the governor of California asked the governor of South Carolina to send a frog to California to compete in the famous Calaveras County Frog Jump immortalized in “The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,” an 1865 short story by Mark Twain and his first great success as a writer.\n\nIn 1968, a Springfield frog named “Buckwheat” won the contest in Columbia and then-Gov. Robert McNair asked Springfield officials if the town wanted to sponsor the festival.\n\nPat Williams, the son of late Springfield resident Lila Williams who worked for the Governor’s Office, was responsible for bringing the event to his hometown.\n\nA meeting was called at the old Springfield Community Center, and the townspeople and then-Mayor O.K. Furtick were challenged to put on the Frog Jump Festival. They agreed to hold the festival in Springfield.\n\nThe state General Assembly then took a vote and designated Springfield as the official home of the Governor’s Frog Jump.\n\nThe first Frog Jump as held on Main Street in a vacant lot between stores. Former Mayor Dickie Phillips initiated the purchase of the lot where the Frog Jump is now held. The land was purchased from Alice Bean, daughter of Daniel Bean, one of the town’s founding fathers.\n\nThe Frog Jump parade has attracted many state politicians, with the late Sen. Strom Thurmond being a frequent participant who even entered a frog in the competition on occasion.\n\nDuring the festival’s second year, the International Egg Strike competition was added. Striking eggs had been a tradition ever since the Irish settlers came to Springfield. A homemade conoction called “Frog Juice,” a combination of Kool-Aid and fruit juice, was once a traditional refreshment at the festival.\n\nThe event has spawned interest all over the nation and the world. The festival has also become a family reunion of sorts for townspeople.\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 51: Jammer’s holds distinction as state’s oldest skating rink\n\nOrangeburg is home to the oldest skating rink in the state, Jammer’s Skate-N-Fun Center.\n\nBuilt in 1948, the rink is also one of the oldest in the Southeast.\n\nWhile on a visit to New York after serving in World War II, James Smoak, the original owner, had the idea to bring the popularity of roller skating to Orangeburg.\n\nHe spoke with his father, Jake, and the men opened Lakeview Skating Rink, the third rink to be built in South Carolina.\n\nSubsequent owners transformed the facility from a simple roller skating rink to a complete family fun center offering additional activities, with the business undergoing major renovation over the last decade.\n\nThe indoor roller rink and entertainment facility features the original 120-foot by 50-foot maple floor.\n\nThe center is open year-round and has a complete pro shop that can make on-site skate repairs as well as assist patrons in finding the right pair of skates for their ability and style of skating.\n\nThe center formerly had a jam skating team that competed on the national level.\n\nWhile roller skating has always been the main attraction, the family facility also offers an indoor “soft play” area that features a 12-foot slide, a bounce room, a rope swing and an obstacle maze. In addition to skeeball, air hockey and basketball, arcade games are featured.\n\nJammer’s Skate-N-Fun Center offers special hours for day-care centers as well as Christian Skate Night, Saturday Kiddie Klub and Sunday Family Day.\n\nThe 9,000-square-foot skate floor is equipped with 16 speakers to provide music, along with a light show that will dazzle the kids.\n\nThe facility is available for private rental for large birthday parties or groups and fundraisers.\n\nJammer’s will host a Back to School Late Skate Party for students in mid-August.\n\nFor more information about Jammers or the Back to School Late Skate Party call 803-533-1600.\n\nContact the writer: kdavis@timesanddemocrat.com or 803-533-5552.

Many were given to him as gifts, some were bought at flea markets and others were purchased during his trips to other countries.\n\nPart of his collection is displayed on 20 tea carts, each denoting various themes.\n\nA 12-foot wooden Noah’s Ark inside the museum serves as home to animal-themed teapots.\n\nIn fact, the entire teapot collection is displayed based on their motifs. Featured are the Vegetable Garden, the Wedding Section, the Christmas section and the Children’s Section, to name a few.\n\nThe entrance to the museum is a huge 20-foot wooden blue teapot — perhaps the largest in the world.\n\nBoland describes his prized teapots as “just a whimsical collection.”\n\nTo make reservations to view J’s Tea-Rific Teapot Museum, call Sybil Boland at 803-829-2944 or 803-707-2017.\n\nAdmission is free.\n\nContact the writer: 803-531-2222.\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 49: Husband’s gift of Adden Hall to bride became college site\n\nAdden Hall, the stately Victorian mansion at 541 Broughton Street, was built about 1900 by F.A. Adden as a gift for his bride, 23-year-old old Harriett Lois Matthews of West Philadelphia.\n\nThe 6,000-square-foot house had 13 rooms, hardwood floors and marble fireplaces surrounded by carved oak mantels.\n\nThe two young people met in 1896 in New York when Mr. Adden visited family members who lived there. They corresponded for four years before they were married.\n\nMrs. Adden traveled to Orangeburg by train in 1900, arriving at the depot across from the home her husband had built for her.\n\nIt’s been said she laughingly noted that her beautiful house did not have one single closet.\n\nThe couple, who had no children, lived together in their home until Mr. Adden’s death in 1936.\n\nMrs. Adden, who became blind not long after he died, continued to live in the house until her death in 1969. At some point, she was joined by a companion, Mable Turner.\n\nA devout Christian and faithful Southern Methodist, Mrs. Adden contributed to the support of Southern Methodist College, which was located in Aiken at the time.\n\nShe learned in 1961 that the college was looking for a new location, and she offered her home and surrounding property.\n\nHer offer was accepted, and the home that had never known the sights and sounds of children growing up, welcomed hundreds of young people over succeeding decades.\n\nNine of the rooms were used as administrative offices, a library, etc., but Mrs. Adden continued to live in a four-room apartment on the first floor until her death in 1969.\n\nAccording to those who still remember her, Mrs. Adden became a “mother” to the students who passed through the doors, loaning many of them money for tuition — but she always expected them to repay her.\n\nShe sat on the side porch, and though she was blind, she recognized the students by their voices and even the sounds they made when they walked.\n\nFor more than 50 years, Adden Hall and the surrounding property — sometimes affectionately called “the marriage mart” by students — has been the happy scene of dozens of weddings, receptions, bridal and baby showers and other happy events.\n\nToday, Adden Hall houses a visitor’s center and administrative and business offices, but it also continues to be the scene of the joyful occasions of the college’s alumni.\n\nContact the writer: dlinder-altman@timesanddemocrat.com or 803-533-5529.\n\n100 OBJECTS/DAY 48"
