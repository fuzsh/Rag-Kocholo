ELLISON BOATWRIGHT (NATHANIEL RUFFIN9, WILLIAM8, WILLIAM7, WILLIAM6, THOMAS5, JOHN4, JOHN3, JOHN2, Not Yet Determined1) was born 1837 in Alabama, and died 20 Oct 1863 in Mobile, Mobile County, Alabama. He married SARAH A. GAFFORD 05 Aug 1857 in Butler County, Alabama, daughter of ALBERT C. GAFFORD and SUSAN TOLLEY. She was born 1837 in Alabama.\n\nNotes for ELLISON BOATWRIGHT:\n\nThe companies of the 29th Alabama were mustered in sometime in 1861 and given their letter designation by the mustering officer. Unfortunately there were not sufficient companies and men to form a regiment, so they were formed as the 4th Alabama Battalion Infantry, and placed under the immediate command of Colonel John F. Conoley of Dallas County, Alabama. The Battalion was thereafter sent by rail to Pensacola as part of the garrison to protect the fort held by the Confederates. While stationed here two additional companies were added to the 4th Battalion. Captain J. B. Sowell's Company I from Conecuh County and Captain John C. McNabb's Company K from Barbour County. The addition of these two companies brought the compliment up to regimental strength, and it was thereafter designated as the 29th Regiment Alabama Infantry. The Regiment remained in Pensacola until that place was evacuated in late Summer of 1862. The Regiment then lay between Pensacola and Camp Pollard, just inside the Alabama line, in Conecuh County, at a place called Camp Lee. This area was found to be very unhealthy, especially during the fever season which began in mid August and grew worse through September and October. Many of the young men died from Typhoid Fever while at Camp Lee. They languished in the area for over a year and in early 1863 were ordered to Mobile. Here they went into camp north of the City. After arriving in Mobile the Regiment was brigade with the 17th and 21st Alabama and the 37th Mississippi Regiments and placed under the command of Brigadier General James Cantey, of Russell County, Alabama. There were rumors that they would finally be going to the front to see some action and kill some Yankees, but it did not happen. Cantey's Brigade remained in camp north of Mobile from July 1863 till April 1864, and did absolutely nothing except march from place to place and drill daily, with an occasional parade through the City of Mobile. They suffered under the same dull and boring camp duty they had been subjected to from almost the beginning. Desertions became widespread throughout the Brigade. Finally in April 1864 the Brigade was ordered to join the main Army of Tennessee in North Georgia, then under the command of General Joseph E. Johnston.\n\n1850 Census: Name: Ellison Boatright December 3, 1850 Age: 13 Estimated birth year: abt 1837 Birth place: Alabama Gender: Male Home in 1850 (City,County,State): Lowndes, Lowndes County, Alabama Page: 159 Roll: M432_8 1860 Census: Name: E Boatwright Date: July 25, 1860 Age in 1860: 23 Home in 1860: Precinct 7, Butler, Alabama Occupation: Farmer Gender: Male Value of real estate: $800 Post Office: Kirkville Roll: M653_3 Page: 183 Year: 1860 Head of Household: E Boatwright\n\nBurial: Magnolia Cemetery, Mobile, Mobile County, Alabama\n\nNotes for SARAH A.

NATHANIEL RUFFIN BOATRIGHT (NATHANIEL RUFFIN9, WILLIAM8, WILLIAM7, WILLIAM6, THOMAS5, JOHN4, JOHN3, JOHN2, Not Yet Determined1) was born 1839 in Alabama, and died 04 Jul 1865 in Chicago, Cook County, Illinois. He married NAOMI SAMPLEY 08 Oct 1860 in Lowndes County, Alabama, daughter of DAVID JONATHAN SAMPLEY and BELINDA J. McFARLAND. She was born 1842 in Lowndes County, Alabama, and died Lowndes County, Alabama.\n\nNotes for NATHANIEL RUFFIN BOATRIGHT:\n\nServed in CSA, 1st Regiment, Alabama Infantry, captured near Nashville, Tennessee on December 15, 1864 and died a prisoner of war at Camp Douglas, Chicago, Illinois.\n\n1st Infantry Regiment completed its organization at Pensacola, Florida, in March, 1861. The men were from the counties of Tallapoosa, Pike, Lowndes, Wilcox, Talladega, Barbour, and Macon. For a year it manned the batteries at Pensacola, then with 1,000 men moved to Missouri where all but a detachment were captured at Island No. 10. The prisoners were exchanged during September, 1862, and it was soon ordered to Port Hudson. Here the unit endured many hardships, and nearly 500 were captured on July 9, 1863. Exchanged and reorganized with 610 effectivesthe 1st joined the Army of Tennessee and served in General Quarles' and Shelley's Brigade. It took an active part in the Atlanta and Tennessee Campaigns, and ended the war in North Carolina. Its casualties were high at Peach Tree Creek and were again heavy at Franklin and Nashville. Less than 100 surrendered in April, 1865. The field officers were Colonels Henry D. Clayton and I.G.W. Steedman, Lieutenant Colonel Michael B. Locke, and Majors S.L. Knox and Jere N. Williams.\n\nThe Battle of Nashville, fought Dec. 15-16, 1864, was the last major battle of the Civil War and a decisive victory for the Union, commanded by Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas. The Army of Tennessee under Gen. John Bell Hood had approached the city in early December after horrendous losses at the Battle of Franklin. They formed a line south of the city and waited for the Federals to attack, suffering from the cold winter weather and the lack of food. Despite forceful urgings from U.S. Grant in Washington to immediately engage the enemy, Thomas waited two weeks to strike, lingering while he reinforced his cavalry and waited out the ice storms. Then, on the foggy morning of Thurs., Dec. 15, Union forces, including many U.S. Colored Troops, hit the Rebel right flank. Although the attack was unsuccessful, it was a diversionary tactic. The main attack came in a vast, wheeling movement westward and then southward from the Union defensive lines against the fortified Rebel left flank. Five small forts or redoubts fought fiercely but were eventually overrun by superior numbers of bluecoats. As dusk neared, the Rebels fell back two miles to establish a second line of defense, anchored on the left at Shys Hill and on the right at Peach Orchard Hill. Again, on Dec. 16, the Federals hit the Rebel right flank, which held fast. Then, following a terrific artillery barrage, the Union assaulted Shys Hill and the U.S. Cavalry managed to sweep behind the Rebel lines. Blasted from three sides, the Confederate positions crumbled, and the men in gray fled southward in retreat. The brave and proud Army of Tennessee had been routed and, for all practical purposes, destroyed. Source: the Battle of Nashville Preservation Society\n\nIn 1861, a tract of land at 31st Street and Cottage Grove Avenue in Chicago was provided by the estate of Stephen A. Douglas for a Union Army training post on the original site of the first University of Chicago. The first Confederate prisoners of war, more than 7,000 from the capture of Fort Donelson in Tennessee, arrived in February 1862 by the Illinois Central railroad which ran along the shore of Lake Michigan just to the east of the camp. Eventually, over 26,000 Confederate soldiers passed through the prison camp, which eventually came to be known as the North's \"Andersonville\" for its inhumane conditions.\n\nPrisoners were deprived of clothing to discourage escapes. Many wore sacks with head and arm holes cut out; few had underwear. Blankets to offset the bitter northern winter were confiscated from the few that had them. The weakest froze to death. The Chicago winter of 1864 was devastating. The loss of 1,091 lives in only four months was heaviest for any like period in the camp's history, and equaled the deaths at the highest rate of Andersonville from February to May, 1864.\n\nIt is estimated that from 18621865, more than 6,000 Confederate prisoners died from disease, starvation, and the bitter cold winters (although as many as 1,500 were reported as \"unaccounted\" for). The largest number of prisoners held at any one time was 12,000 in December, 1864. Accounts vary as to precise numbers. According to 80 Acres of Hell, a television documentary produced by the A&E Network and the The History Channel, the reason for the uncertainty is that many records were intentionally destroyed after the war. The documentary also alleges that, for a period of time, the camp contracted with an unscrupulous undertaker who sold some of the bodies of Confederate prisoners to medical schools and had the rest buried in shallow graves without coffins. Some were even dumped in Lake Michigan only to wash up on its shores. Many, however, were initially buried in unmarked pauper's graves in Chicago's City Cemetery (located on the site of today's Lincoln Park), but in 1867 were reinterred at what is now known as Confederate Mound in Oak Woods Cemetery (5 miles south of the former Camp Douglas).\n\nNobody was ever held accountable for the conditions and actions at Camp Douglas, in fact the only Union general to gain the rank without seeing combat was an overseer of Camp Douglas. This is also to this date the largest mass grave in the western hemisphere, as documented by the book To Die in Chicago.\n\nOak Woods Cemetery, Chicago, Illinois was established in 1854 on an area of 183 acres located at 1035 E. 67th Street in Chicago, Illinois. The first burials took place in 1860. During the American Civil War, six thousand Confederate soldiers and prisoners of war who died at Camp Douglas (Chicago) were buried together in a mass grave. A monument known as the Confederate Mound was erected in their memory.\n\nThe Confederate dead here buried in concentric trenches were all private soldiers.\n\nThe monument to their memory is of Georgia granite, stands forty feet from the ground to the top of statue and was erected in July 1893 with funds mainly subscribed by liberal citizens of Chicago and camps of the United Confederate Veterans. The bronze statue surmounting the battlemented cap of the column is a realistic representation of a Confederate infantry soldier after the surrender. The face expresses sorrow for the thousands of prison dead interred beneath. Around the base of the monument are bronze tablets with the name and unit of every Confederate buried here.\n\n1850 Census: Name: Nathaniel Boatright Date: December 3, 1850 Age: 11 Estimated birth year: abt 1839 Birth place: Alabama Gender: Male Home in 1850 (City,County,State): Lowndes, Lowndes County, Alabama Page: 159 Roll: M432_8 1860 Census: Name: Nat Boteright Date: August 3, 1860 Age in 1860: 21 Birth Year: abt 1839 Birthplace: Alabama Home in 1860: Southern Division, Lowndes, Alabama Gender: Male Post Office: Mount Willing Census Place: Southern Division, Lowndes, Alabama; Roll: M653_14; Page: 610; Image: 129; Family History Library Film: 803014.

AZARIAH JOHN BOATWRIGHT (WILLIAM9, MARTIN JOHNSON8, WILLIAM7, WILLIAM6, THOMAS5, JOHN4, JOHN3, JOHN2, Not Yet Determined1) was born 27 May 1841 in Lexington County, South Carolina, and died 22 May 1903 in Batesburg, Lexington County, South Carolina. He married MARY EMILY CLARK 27 Feb 1868 in Batesburg, Lexington County, South Carolina, daughter of ANDREW CLARK and MARY LYBRAND. She was born 30 Jan 1846 in Lexington County, South Carolina, and died 08 Jul 1934 in Batesburg, Lexington County, South Carolina.\n\nNotes for AZARIAH JOHN BOATWRIGHT:\n\nThe 13th Regiment of South Carolina Volunteers was formed in the summer of 1861. The Regiment was the brain child of Oliver Evans Edwards who was born in Spartanburg District on November 9, 1819. In response to a call from President Jefferson Davis about the 1st of July 1861, a large number of infantry companies were formed across South Carolina. Oliver E. Edwards had fought in the First Battle of Manassas. Answering the call of President Davis, Oliver E. Edwards returned to his home county of Spartanburg, South Carolina and with the help of others organized five companies which would later become part of the 13th Regiment of South Carolina Volunteers.\n\nCompanies B, C, E, F, and I were all organized of Spartanburg County, South Carolina Volunteers. Company A was organized of Laurens County Volunteers; Companies D and G were organized of Newberry County Volunteers; and Companies H and K were organized of Lexington County Volunteers. The men of the above companies left their home counties in August of 1861 and went to a camp of instruction at Lightwood Knot Springs, about 5 miles from Columbia, South Carolina, where the various companies were organized into regiments. Here, the 13th was formed and elected its field-officers: Colonel O.E. Edwards, Lieutenant Colonel P.L. Calhoun, and Major T. Stobo Farrow. After about three months of instruction at Lightwood Knot Springs, the 13th was ordered to the southern coast of South Carolina, near Pocotaglio, where it was brigaded with the 12th and 14th regiments. The 13th was present at the well known bombardment of Hilton Head by the Federal fleet. On the evacuation of the position there, the regiment was successfully withdrawn, after some very muddy wading to the mainland. It was next stationed near Green Pond, near the line of Colleton and Beaufort counties. At this time, the 13th, along with the 12th and 14th regiments, were formed into a brigade under the command of Brig. General Maxey Gregg. The brigade remained on the coast of South Carolina until April of 1862 when it was ordered to Virginia. Its first camp in Virginia was around Milford Station, on the Richmond and Fredericksburg railroad.\n\nAs stated, the 13th Regiment was originally part of Gregg's Brigade. After arriving in Virginia, Gregg's Brigade was composed of five South Carolina regiments, to wit: 13th regiment, 12th regiment, 14th regiment, 1st regiment and Orr's regiment of rifles. These five regiments would remain together for the duration of the war as a brigade. Gregg's Brigade eventually became McGowan's Brigade and was a part of A.P. Hill's Division and became part of General Stonewall Jackson's Corp. After Jackson's death at Chancellorsville, the brigade was made a part of the Third Corp. As a result of a wound received at Chancellorsville, Colonel O.E. Edwards also died. The 13th then was led by Benjamin T. Brockman, also of Spartanburg County. Brockman was promoted to Colonel and he also died of wounds he received at \"bloody bend\" at the Battle of Spottsylvania Courthouse on May 12, 1864. After Brockman's death, the regiment for the first time was led by someone other than a Spartanburg County native. Captain Isaac F. Hunt of Company D of Newberry County was made the commander of the 13th and promoted to Colonel.\n\nThe 13th Regiment remained a part of the army of northern Virginia until the conclusion of the war. The 13th Regiment was present at the surrender at Appomattox Courthouse on April 9, 1865. Captain John Wilson Carlisle of Company C later recalled General Custer of the Federal Army passing in front of the 13th waving a white flag as it was getting ready to go into engagement.\n\nOf the 13th Regiment, 220 men were killed in battle or died of wounds. 262 died of disease and 678 men received wounds in combat.\n\nAzariah John Boatwright served during the Civil War as a Private in Company K, 13th Reg SC Volunteers. He was captured twice, but returned to service after his first release. He was wounded at Gettysburg and lived with the bullet in his body for the rest of his life. He was short of stature, had particularly short legs. He was a planter of cotton, corn, and indigo in the early years, shifting production to peaches, asparagus, and poultry in later years (from notes by Emily Cato Wilson to Emmie Cato Pinson).\n\nThe Boatwright Cemetery is next door to the former home (still standing in 1995) of Azariah J. Boatwright and wife Emily Clark, on Two-Notch Road, south of Batesburg, South Carolina abt 1.4 mi E of US-Hwy178/ Fairview Rd.\n\nThe home was built by Azariah when he returned from the Civil War, to replace their original log cabin.\n\nServed in Co K,13th Regt.,SCV(CSA) under Christopher Caughman\n\n1850 Census: Name: Asiriah Boatright Date: September 19, 1850 Age: 9 Estimated birth year: abt 1841 Birth place: South Carolina Gender: Male Home in 1850 (City,County,State): Lexington, Lexington County, South Carolina Page: 403 Roll: M432_855 1860 Census: Name: A J Boatwright Date: July 28, 1860 Age in 1860: 19 Birthplace: Lexington Home in 1860: Vicinity of Lightwood Creek, Lexington County, South Carolina Gender: Male Occupation: School Teacher Value of real estate: $0 Post Office: Lightwood Creek Roll: M653_1222 Page: 464 Year: 1860 Head of Household: Wm Boatwright 1880 Census: Name: A.

E of US #178 (Fairview Rd.) - Batesburg-Leesville, Lexington County, South Carolina\n\nNotes for MARY EMILY CLARK:\n\nEmily Clark Boatwright was very proud to be named for the Lexington county heroine of the Revolutionary War, Emily Geiger. She was an honorary member of the Leesville chapter, U.D.C.; she treasured and preserved family heirlooms and memories of visits to the historic home of her maternal grandparents, Molly and Joseph Lybrand. Even in later years she maintained interest in the family farm and regaled visitors with vivid stories of her ancestors. Relatives of Mary Emily Clark operated a flour mill at Dreher Shoals, now under waters captured by the Saluda Dam. They lived in the Chinquepin District (east of modern Monetta). The family was Dutch-German-Irish (from notes by Emily Cato Wilson to Emmie Cato Pinson).\n\nHe son, Oscar C. Boatwright, lived with and cared for her until her death, when he inherited her home.\n\nSee link for copy of death certificate.\n\nHer siblings were long-lived. At her death, the following survived her:\n\nMrs. Nancy C. Clarke, Lexington\n\nMrs. Julia Clarke Shealy, Lexington\n\nPreston Clarke, Lexington\n\nMrs. Jane C. Hutto, Leesville\n\nA. S. Clarke, Batesburg\n\nDEATH OF MRS. EMILY CLARK BOATWRIGHT Batesburg-Leesville, SC, Twin City News, July 10, 1934\n\nProminent Woman of Near Batesburg Buried Monday in Family Cemetery.\n\nMrs. Emily Clarke Boatwright, one of the oldest and most highly respected women of this section, died Sunday at her home near Batesburg in her 88th year; and the funeral, which was largely attended by a host of friends and relatives, was held from the home Monday afternoon, with the Rev. W. F. Hiers, of the Wittenbuerg Lutheran church, Leesville, officiating, the interment being in the family cemetery near the home.\n\nMrs. Boatwright's long and useful life was spent in Lexington county and her passing was a great sorrow not only to her family and relatives, but to hundreds of friends in this section. The deceased was born near Lexington on Jan. 30, 1846, the daughter of Andrew J. and Mary Lybrand Clarke and the great grand-daughter of Gregory Clarke, who served with General Greene in his South Carolina campaign during the Revolution. Her girlhood days including the Confederate war period, were spent near the place of her birth. Shortly after the war she married Asariah J. Boatwright, a member of Co., K, 13th regiment, South Carolina Volunteers. Of this union were born four sons and four daughters.\n\nFrom Mr. Boatwright's death about thirty years ago until recent years, Mrs. Boatwright took an active part in the management of the farm, bringing to this task, added to that of rearing her family and later the family of a deceased son, unusual fortitude and cheerfulness. She took a great deal of interest in the Leesville chapter, U.D.C.*, of which she was an honorary member.\n\nSurviving Mrs. Boatwright are two sons, R. J. and O. C. Boatwright, of Batesburg; four daughters, Mrs. William Cato, Monetta; Mrs. Mary B. Jumper, Springfield; Mrs. B. I. Able, Pensacola, Fla., and Mrs. Julian C. Quattlebaum, of Batesburg; nine grand-children and three great grandchildren. Surviving also are the following brothers and sisters: Mrs. Nancy C. Clarke, Mrs. Julia Clarke Shealy, Preston Clarke, all of Lexington; Mrs. Jane C. Hutto, Leesville, and A. S. Clarke, Batesburg.\n\n(Transcriber's note: many of the children spelled the name \"Clark\"; Mrs. Boatwright wrote it as \"Clarke\"; the name appears as \"Clark\" on her tombstone)\n\nExtract from Contributed Article about Mrs. Emily Clark Boatwright, Batesburg-Leesville, SC, Twin City News (approx. 1934)\n\n...Even now she takes a lively interest in the management of her household and of the various farming activities which have survived from the cotton, corn and the indigo of her earlier years to peaches, asparagus and poultry production under the supervision of her son, Oscar C. Boatwright. She also takes a pleasurable interest in the work of the Leesville Chapter U.D.C., of which she is an honorary member.\n\nA visit to the home of Mrs. Boatwright is a truly memorable occasion. Here the caller may see furnishings of a by-gone day, including a spinning wheel, an unique corner cupboard and a home-blown camphor bottle brought by immigrqant foretathers from the banks of the River Rhine. A home-made walnut chest bulges with tight bodiced full skirted dresses and other garments, spun and woven by their owner, knitted flounces, long mittens, children's small bonnets and aprons of more than three score years ago, and various articles of confederate uniform. Another chest is filled with books and letters whose pages are crumbly and yellowed with age. The especially favored guest may be shown numerous miniatures with delicate gold tracery against the backrounds of flaming scarlet velvet and other intimate souvenirs of the past.\n\nMrs. Boatwright fascinates her callers with modest but vivid accounts of life in the 60's [1860's]. Baking in genuine old Dutch ovens, annual trips to Columbia for supplies when Columbia was a \"town\", visits to the flour mill operated by relatives at Dreher Shoals, the present site of Saluda Dam, war time romances, and reconstruction days are topics of which her listeners never tire. Among her most treasured memories are the visits to the home of her maternal grandparents, Joseph and Molly Lybrand, north of Lexington. The Joseph Lybrand house, erected about 1800, was the first frame house in the Boiling Springs section. It still stands in a good state of preservation. From the grandparents who lived there in her childhood days, and whose lives extended back into the revolutionary era, little Emily Clarke heard exciting accounts of the Indicans of the section and of the famous ride of Emily Geiger. It is for this Lexington county heroine that she was named -- a fact of which she is very proud.\n\nMrs. Boatwright intersperses her recitals of long remembvered things with comments upon the modern day. She welcomes the innovations in home and farm devices, transportation, manufacturing, etc. She smiles tolerantly, and accepts with chuckles of amusement the dress and manners of the modern youth.\n\nAlways companionable, her optimism, sparkling humor, and rare ability to move along with the times have drawn about this venerable woman a host of friends. Even the saucy redbird who for several seasons has tapped daily at her window pane for crumbs from her hand seems to feel the compelling magnetisn of this true daughter of the Carolina pioneers.\n\n1880 Census: Name: Emma BOATWRIGHT Date: June 5, 1880 Age: 34 Estimated birth year: <1846> Birthplace: South Carolina Occupation: Keeping House Relationship to head-of-household: Wife Home in 1880: Chinquapin, Lexington, South Carolina Marital status: Married Race: White Gender: Female Spouse's name: A.
