Screenplay: C S Forester, E H North. In May 1941, the German battleship Bismarck tried its first outing in the Atlantic by attacking convoys, and Churchill gave the order to sink it by any means.

Fairey Swordfishes of carriers HMS Victorious and Ark Royal dealt it decisive blows. The Royal Navy had but to finish the job. Good views of the old \"Stringbag\" Swordfish shot on HMS Centaur, plus models and stock footages.

Jeff Hawke, aerials advisor. Maltin review: \"McGinnis and Osterhage are a poor man's 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' in this dreary adventure of two Western buddies' aerial exploits during WWI. Touted as the most expensive ($18 million) independent British production ever, film is poorly cast and has nothing to offer but high-flying special effects.\" Also seen as Gun Bus (1986).\n\nAIRCRAFT: Vickers Gun Bus.

Screenplay: Lionel Houser. At TWA school for young pilots, hard-boiled Carey gets airline captain Dix as his aide. Complications arise when Carey's son arrives for training and rivalry develops between Dix and Morris when they both fall for Fontaine. Last part turns into an Arctic survival tale  watch an Electra land on fresh snow in about 100 feet (OK, so it's a model). Filmed at Grand Central Air Terminal in Glendale CA.\n\nAIRCRAFT: DC-3, Fairchild 24, Lockheed 12A, Northrop Gamma 2B, Ryan ST.

Teleplay: Dwight V Babcock et al. \"From out of the clear blue of the western sky comes... Sky King!\" was the familiar opening to tv's premier aviation program that evolved from a radio serial.

Faithfully watched by youngsters in the '50s, the weekly half-hour program was responsible for inspiring many aviation careers. Aerial supervisor: Paul Mantz.\n\nAIRCRAFT: Cessnas T-50/UC-78 [N67832] and 310B [N5348A].\n\nTRIVIA: Grant, a licensed pilot since 1930, was killed in a car accident on 10/30/85, while on his way to Cape Canaveral to witness a launch of space shuttle 'Challenger'. Sky Parade, The (Paramount 1936, 70m) D: Otto Lovering. Jimmie Allen = himself, Katherine DeMille = Geraldine Croft, William Gargan = Speed Robertson, Kent Taylor = Tom Wade.

Filmed at Roosevelt Field NY, but action is supposed to be WW1 France, loosely based on war ace Nungesser's exploits.

Sky Raiders (serial; Universal 1941, 228m) D: Ford Beebe, Ray Taylor. Robert Armstrong = Lt Ed Carey, Edward (Eduardo) Cianelli = Felix Lynx, Billy Halop = Tim Bryant, Donald Woods = Capt Bob Dayton/John Kane. Billed as \"The most sensational sky-serial ever made,\" it helps to revert to being 12 years old again to fully enjoy a tale that stretches believability to the limit with its comic-book script. Unintentionally funny with model aircraft that fly like Dixie cups in a windstorm and change types at will, interior shots of room-size cabins, the apparent 10-minute flight from Glendale to NYC in an autogyro. Chief enjoyment for viewers is tallying errors and improbabilities in the 12 chapters (bring lots of paper!) Filmed at Grand Central Air Terminal and Burbank's United Airport. Our DVD copy possibly had some scenes clipped out because there are several puzzling breaks in the continuity. ( K O Eckland 12/27/05)\n\nAIRCRAFT: DC-3, Fairchild 24, Phillips Aeroneer, autogyros; lots of models. Sky Ranger, The (serial; Pathè 1921, silent) D: George B Seitz.

Pat O'Malley = Jim Morgan, John Trent = Buddy Morgan, Glen Tryon = Glenn Morgan. Screenplay: Grace Norton. Air Mail robbery plot is thin, predictable, but with some interesting period air shots. Sky's the Limit, The (1925, 50m, silent) D: Harry L Fraser, I W Irving. Jack Geddings = Richard Hamilton, Bruce Gordon = Robert Bronson, Alphonse Martell = Pietro Costello, Jane Starr = Sonia Kosloff. Screenplay: Irving. Some good flying sequences in a tale about air mail pilots and robbers. Skyward (1980, 100m) D: Ron Howard. Bette Davis = Billie Dupree, Clu Galager, Suzy Gilstrap = Julie Ward, Howard Hesseman = Coop.Nancy Sackett, from a story by Anson Williams. Made for tv. Young wheelchair-bound girl learns to fly. Pleasant story, excellent flying footage.\n\nAIRCRAFT: Christen Eagle, PT-13, sailplanes. Skywayman, The (Fox 1920, silent) D: James P Hogan. Ormer Locklear, Louise Lovely. Screenplay: Jules Furthman. Locklear and Milton Elliott were killed filming final flight sequence at night when Locklear became blinded by searchlights and flew into the ground  the footage was left in the movie.\n\nAIRCRAFT: JN-4. Slattery's Hurricane (Fox 1949, 67m) D: Andre de Toth. Linda Darnell = Aggie Hobson, Veronica Lake = Dolores Greaves, Gary Merrill = Cmdr Kramer, John Russell = Lt Hobson, Richard Widmark = Will Slattery. Screenplay: Richard Murphy, Herman Wouk. Some flying, but mostly Grumman Mallard. WW2 hero Slattery pilots a seaplane for a Florida businessman and, when an hurricane approaches Florida, he takes the place of his friend, a Weather Bureau pilot too drunk for piloting, and flies into the eye of the hurricane to track its path. ( Christian Santoir 6/21/06)\n\nAIRCRAFT: DC-6, Grumman G-73, P4Y-2G Privateer. Smithy (Australia; 1946, 118m) D: Ken G Hall.

When Lorenz's expedition is lost in northern Greenland, his wife conducts an airborne search with the help of popular flyer Udet. Filmed on location, Udet demonstrates his skill as aerial showman in ditching a plane in icy water and crashing another on a massive iceberg. Riefenstahl's final film as an actress before becoming a director. ( Christian Santoir 7/7/04)\n\nAIRCRAFT: DH.60, Junkers A.20, Klemm VL.26bV, Messerschmitt M.23bW, Udet U.12 Flamingo. S.O.S. Iceberg (Universal 1933, 77m) D: Arnold Fanck, Tay Garnett. US version of the previous with Rod La Rocque replacing Diessl (who was moved to a supporting role) as an Anglicized Dr Carl Lawrence and Gibson Gowland added as John Dragan, Sepp Rist renamed as Dr Johannes Brand. Riefenstahl recreated her role speaking English as Ellen Lawrence. Udet's flying footage mercifully was retained. Produced by Carl Laemmle. Southern Cross SEE Smithy South Seas Bouquet (Japan; 1942) - No data. Space Cowboys (2000) - A brief segment early in the film with Steve Hinton stunting a Stearman and some spectacular camera work.

Set just before the outbreak of WW2, this story about a test pilot who worked for an unnamed enemy was filmed in 1939. By the time it was released in 1940, war had been declared. Spirit of St Louis (Warner Bros 1957, 138m) D: Billy Wilder. Marc Connelly = Father Hussman, Murray Hamilton = Bud Gurney, Bartlett Robinson = B F Mahoney, James Stewart = Charles Lindbergh. Screenplay: Wendell Mayes, Wilder. Aerials by Stan Reaver, Paul Mantz. A classic film, long but compelling. Filmed in part at Santa Maria CA.\n\nAIRCRAFT: JN-4, replica Ryan M-1, Standard J-1. Spitfire (Great Britain; 1942, 117m) D: Leslie Howard. Roland Culver, Leslie Howard = Reginald J Mitchell, Rosamund John = Mrs Mitchell, David Niven = Crisp.

Hansjörg Felmy = Robert Franke, Horst Frank = Albin Droste, Joachim Hansen = Hans-Joachim Marseille, Marianne Koch = Brigitte. Screenplay : Herbert Reinecker, Udo Wolter. Awarded the highest honors, Marseille shot down 158 planes (17 in one day!) between 1940 and 1942, mostly in Libya. Nazi propaganda made him the \"Star of Africa\" and a living legend who died at 23 in an accident when bailing out of a burning plane. Typically '50s style, the movie is mediocre with inappropriate music, but lots of flying, albeit with technically poor realization. Of particular interest is the rare Spanish HA.1112K Jota (Bf.109G assembled by Hispano Aviacion and powered by a French Hispano-Suiza). Banned in Germany for a time. ( Christian Santoir 6/3/04)\n\nAIRCRAFT: Boeing B-17G, Fi.156 Storch, Fw.44 Stieglitz, HA.1112 K.1L, Ju.87B. Storm From the Sea (Japan; 1961) - No data.

Friedrich Kayssler = Armstrong, Leni Riefenstahl = Hella Armstrong, Sepp Rist = Hannes, Ernst Udet = himself, Mathias Wieman = Walter Petersen. Screenplay: Arnold Fanck. USA title: Avalanche (1932), Storm Over Mont Blanc (1930). In the Mont Blanc observatory, Hannes' only contact with the outside world by radio is pilot Udet and Armstrong, who come to his aid when he is endangered by freezing. The film shows Udet landing on the mountain's glacier, quite a real feat at the time! ( Christian Santoir 7/7/04)\n\nAIRCRAFT: Klemm L.25. Stranger Than Fiction (MacDonald 1921, silent) D: J A Barry. Wesley Barry = Freckles, Katherine MacDonald = Diane Drexel, Dave Winter = Dick Mason. Screenplay: Albert S Le Vino.

Carl Raddatz = Cdr Heinz Bork, Albert Hehn = Lt Hesse, Hannes Stelzer = Capt Hans Wilde, O E Hasse = Dr Gregorius, Lutz Götz = Niederegger. Screenplay: Felix Lützkendorf. The story of a dive-bomber squadron during the Battle of France in May-June 1940 shows the Ju.87 spreading terror and destruction  the Stuka was developed on the instigation of German ace, Ernst Udet, who had attended Al Williams' dive-bombing demonstrations in the US. Another Ritter propaganda movie in which war is a sport, the German army is invincible, and young pilots are happy to give their life for the Fatherland.
