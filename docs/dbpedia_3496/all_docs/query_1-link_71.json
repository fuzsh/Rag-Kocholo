        "text": "Indiana Jones And The Lost Ark Character Analysis\n\n1443 Words | 6 Pages\n\nThe 1980 's saw many changes that were made to society. The 19th amendment had just turned 60 (Gertner and Heriot). Apple and PC computers were beginning to take off, and Sally Ride became the first woman in space (National Geographic). However, it doesn 't seem that the positive changes being made to our society were being reflected in our media; due to the fact that Hollywood was still turning out the old \"damsel in distress\" stereotype for its leading ladies. Which is evident in the movie Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark.\n\nThe Lost Battalion Film Analysis\n\n329 Words | 2 Pages\n\nThe Lost Battalion is the true story of several units of the American 77th Infantry Division in World War One. The film follows the exploits of nine companies (550 plus men) involved in a battle during the Argonne Forest attack by the American Army in October 1918. During the attack, the Americans advance too far into the German positions and outrun their flank cover. The Germans react and quickly launch a counter attack which surrounds the men.\n\nBand Of Brothers Film Analysis\n\n799 Words | 4 Pages\n\nThe show Band of Brothers was produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks who, at the time, recently had success with a World War II film entitled Saving Private Ryan. Spielberg and Hanks used their expertise on war films to craft the exceptional television series Band of Brothers which originally aired on HBO in 2001. The show follows “Easy” Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, of the 101st Airborne Division, from the moment they begin their training to the moment their deployment ends. Throughout the show we see the men of “Easy” Company mature a thousand times over. The men experience love, loss, and death at rate that is inconceivable to someone that has never experienced the theatre of war.\n\nDalton Trumbo Movie Analysis\n\n1833 Words | 8 Pages\n\nThe Cold War is often seen as a dark time in American history, not just because of the international conflict, but because of the strife it caused within the United States itself. During the Cold War, the general culture in America was fearful and paranoid about the rise and spread of Communism within their society. One example of how this hysteria manifested is illustrated in the movie, Trumbo, which tells the story of when the Hollywood industry blacklisted famous writer Dalton Trumbo, along with other workers in the industry, who were connected to Communism. Dalton Trumbo and his associates faced bigotry and were effectively attacked for standing by their ideals, which was a reflection of how American culture had changed at that time. By\n\nDuck And Cover Film Analysis\n\n945 Words | 4 Pages\n\nIn question one, we explored how the film Duck and Cover utilized various concepts of propaganda design, as identified by Jacques Ellul, to inform children of the dangers of atomic bombs and how to be safe. The following analysis takes these concepts further by evaluating the work of Susan Sontag in her 1975 New York Book review “Fascinating Fascism”, an article on the work of Leni Riefenstahl, an infamous Nazi filmmaker and member of Adolf Hitler’s inner circle (Sontag, 1975). Sontag posits that Riefenstahl’s work for the Nazi party, starting in the 1930’s, demonstrates a true representation of what Sontag calls the “fascist aesthetic”. Riefenstahl’s work concentrated on the power of the propagandist elements of imagery and control to further\n\nFilm Analysis: The Hero's End\n\n751 Words | 4 Pages\n\nIn the movie, \"The World's End\", directed by Edgar Wright, Gary King has to face his past as he goes back to his hometown to face a forgotten challenge within his Hero's Journey. This movie contains the Hero's Journey because it brings us closer to the characters as we watch Gary transform into a new person throughout the film, while facing his quest of the Golden Mile Pub Crawl. While we learn different things about the characters from the movie, we realize they fit into Campbell’s idea of the Hero’s Journey. The Hero’s Journey gives an example of how a person, or a hero, changes throughout an experience or an adventure. Overall, there are three parts to the Hero’s Journey, the departure, the initiation and the return, which produce the adventure or the experience.\n\nWalter Mitty Film Analysis\n\n704 Words | 3 Pages\n\nMovie review of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty Everyone has been daydreamed about things like be a hero, superman, vampire etc, but who really thinks about what daydreaming is, what daydreaming effects？I never think that kind of questions either, until I watched The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. It is the movie about daydreaming: The protagonist, Walter Mitty wanders between reality and his daydream, finally steps on the actual adventure of the life that he never imagined before and has a romantic love experience with the heroine, Cheryl Melhoff. The actors performance is really verisimilitude, which brings me in these characters spontaneously, experience an ordinary daydreamer’s mediocre life. I really appreciate the acting skill of Ben Stiller, (who directs the movie and plays the role of Walter Mitty).\n\nBirdman Film Analysis\n\n813 Words | 4 Pages\n\n1. In the film, Birdman directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu is about a man named Riggan, whose well known as the “Birdman.” In the film we witness Riggan struggling who is making his mark in the world using broadway. When he achieved his fame as “Birdman”, he isolated himself from the screen as he battled with his inner voices which later caused him to commit suicide. His inner voices in the beginning of the film weren’t as powerful as it was towards the end.\n\nRescue Dawn Film Analysis\n\n491 Words | 2 Pages\n\nRescue Dawn is a good film; it displays the events around the Vietnam War and how it affected American and Vietnamese individuals. This film is very crucial in understanding many circumstances between the United States, Vietnam and Asia. The main character, Dieter Dengler was involved in a classified mission to fly over Laos and bomb certain sites there. When he bombs an area it backfires and it damages his plane.\n\nEnd Of Watch Film Analysis\n\n1438 Words | 6 Pages\n\nThroughout the movie “End of Watch” follows along with Officer Brian Taylor (Gyllenhaal) and Officer Mike Zavala (Pena) on their daily patrols in the inner city of Los Angeles. During the course of the movie, there are many things that Officer Taylor and Officer Zavala do that is very common and even accepted among police officers. But, one reoccurring theme is that they use foul language while on duty, act unprofessional, and use excessive force. In addition, Officer Taylor is actively recording his daily activities while on duty with a handheld video camera and lapel body cameras for both himself and Officer Zavala. Even though Officer Taylor was repeatedly told to cease his filming by fellow officers and supervisors he continued his behavior.\n\nFilm Analysis: Bad Day At Black Rock\n\n1288 Words | 6 Pages\n\nBad Day at Black Rock Kathryn Abbott October 29 2015 DRAMA 3030 The unexpected arrival of a stranger to a small, Midwestern town creates a feeling of scepticism and suspicion, and through this the explicit meaning is revealed: Fear of the unknown and the moral and physical deterioration of a town left to its own devices. The film exemplifies these concepts through the use of mise-en-scène, and vivid cinematographic elements. The blood red coloured train stands out against a muted background.\n\nMetropolis Film Analysis\n\n1919 Words | 8 Pages\n\nMetropolis is a 1927 German expressionistic science fiction film, directed by Fritz Lang. Much of the plot is established following influences of the first world war, and the culture of the Weimar Republic in Germany. Although criticised for its allusions to communism in the resolution of the film, Lang explores mostly themes of industrialisation and mass production, which, coincidentally, were two developments that provided a large influence in the First World War. Lang also explores themes of the Weimer view of American modernity, communism and fascist rule. Politically, this film was shot after WWI, meaning many of its influences were extracted from the horrors of the First World War.\n\nHitch Film Analysis\n\n1461 Words | 6 Pages\n\nRevision Review of Hitch While the movie Hitch captures its audience by providing comic relief and relationship advice, there are aspects and parts in the movie that could be improved to provide more enjoyment to the viewers. The plot line is well-developed overall as it is a typical romantic comedy, yet it can be too predictable at times. From the moment when actors Will Smith, who plays Alex Hitchens and Eva Mendes, who plays Sara Melas meet, there was an instant attraction, and from that moment forward, the audience is able to predict the way the movie will transpire. While the screenwriters maintained the characteristics of a typical romantic comedy such as humor, authenticity, dedication, and chemistry within a love story, the plot was\n\nInvasion Of The Bodysnatchers Film Analysis\n\n171 Words | 1 Pages\n\nLike the film, Invasion of the Bodysnatchers, a flashback technique and first-person narrative are used to tell the story of the film Double Indemnity. The director of the film—Billy Wilder—made the correct choice of having the main character—Walter—tell the story. At the very beginning of the film Walter says, “Yes, I killed him. I killed him for money – and a woman – and I didn’t get the money and I didn’t get the woman.\n\nSpotlight Movie Analysis\n\n1427 Words | 6 Pages\n\nThe movie Spotlight, recounts the true events that occurred in Boston and were brought to light back in 2002. The movie talks about the massive cover-up scheme by the catholic church to conceals the fact that several priests were abusing and had abused hundreds of kids without any action from the Archdiocese. In this paper I will summarize the movie, discuss the type of victims shown in the movie, asses the risk level of the victims, and lastly relate the different theories of victimization and how each relates to the movie. The movie follows a group of journalists working at the Boston Globe, who are known as the spotlight team."
