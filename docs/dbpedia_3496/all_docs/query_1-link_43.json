That’s what happened to an aggregation known as the Compton Musical Company, which went broke at Nilesburgh. But the sequel is really funny. Old Deacon Simpson, one of the most sanctimonious chaps in this vicinity, tried his best to make an impression on the fair Corinne Melrose, prima donna of the company, but got scant encouragement till the latter went to live with Aunt Tiny Colvin. Everybody knows that Aunt Tiny’s home is mortgaged to Simpson. When Corinne learned he was about to foreclose she started in to “vamp” him, in a ladylike way. Result: he got so tangled in the meshes of the good hearted siren that he was happy to escape by relenting in the matter of the mortgage. So all’s well that ends well. This is the story of “Hard Boiled,” a new Paramount picture which is to be seen at the theatre next , with lovely Dorothy Dalton as star. It is a Thomas H. Ince picture, directed by Victor L. Schertzinger. Some Clever Sayings AS the leading woman in a musical comedy, Dorothy Dalton, in her latest Thomas H. Ince photoplay, “Hard Boiled,” which is on view at the theatre this week, brings to the screen some clever sayings that will remind the spectators of the lines made popular by Rose Stahl in “The Chorus Lady.” The support is of unusual excellence. SKINFLINT ROUTED BY BEAUTY AND WIT New Dalton Picture Story of “Hard Boiled” Clever CORINNE MELROSE, beautiful and accomplished, but unfortunate enough to be stranded in a small town, when her show goes on the rocks, put her beauty and wit to a good account recently, when she succeeded in entangling Deacon Simpson so that he was forced to act like a white man in regard to his mortgage on the little home of Aunt Tiny Colvin. This incident forms the central idea of the story of Dorothy Dalton’s new Paramount picture^ “Hard Boiled,” which will be seen at the theatre next This picture was directed by Victor L. Schertzinger under the supervision of Thomas H. Ince. Miss Dalton, as the prima donna, does some of the finest acting of her career. She is ably supported by a fine cast including “Smiling Billy” Mason as leading man. The country town types are well presented and the manner in which the clever girl outwits the shrewd and rascally old deacon will prove highly edifying to the public. Well Known Actress Gertrude claire, who plays the part of the lovable old maid in Thomas H. Ince’s latest photoplay, “Hard Boiled,” starring Dorothy Dalton, which is being shown at the theatre this week, is probably one of the best known character women on the screen today. During her early life in Boston she played in repertoire and later managed her own theatre. Her screen career includes important parts in such productions as “Ramona,” “The Jungle Child,” “The Criminal,” “The Crab,” “The Female of the Species,” “Seeking Happiness,” “Madcap Madge,” “Golden Rule Kate,” “The Mother Instinct,” and many others. WALTER HIERS IS IN DALTON PHOTOPLAY Excellent Actor Has Fine Role in “Hard Boiled” ALTER HIERS, a well known actor of character roles and light comedy, who was recently engaged by Thomas H. Ince for Paramount pictures, will make his first screen appearance with Dorothy Dalton in “Hard Boiled,” at the theatre next Mr. Hiers appeared in “The Mysterious Miss Terry” and also with Jack Pickford in “Seventeen.” He was born in 1893 and educated at Savannah and in Peekskill Military Academy. His stage experience has been confined to vaudeville, but he has had a rather lengthy career in pictures, starting with Majestic, Lubin, Thanhouser and continuing in Metro, Frohman, Famous Players, Selig, etc. Inasmuch as he is in the heavyweight class ,he has done many numerous parts as the “fat boy” order. Being a versatile actor, however, Mr. Hiers doubtless will prove a valuable acquisition to the Ince forces. Mr. Hiers has an excellent role in “Hard Boiled,” of which he makes the most. Biter Bitten Here '’T^HE public always loves to see the biter bit and in Dorothy Dalton’s new picture, “Hard Boiled,” which is on view at the. . . .theatre this week, the manner in which a rascally old deacon is beaten at his nefarious games by a charming prima donna pleases everybody who cares for a wholesome story of life in a small town. There is comedy galore. It is a Thomas H. InceParamount picture and Victor L. Schertzinger was the director. 15"
