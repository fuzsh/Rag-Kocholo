Frankie adopts the child and returns to New York, where she writes a book questioning the one-sided social laws that make this a man's world. Her publisher, Malcolm Gaskell, falls in love with her, and the two become engaged, but Frankie's rival, Lione Brune, attempts to destroy the romance by jealously suggesting that \"Kiddie\" is Frankie's child. Angrily, Malcolm rushes to Frankie's apartment and demands to know the truth, whereupon Frankie, noticing the resemblance between Kiddie and Malcolm, asks him if he ever met Alice Ellery in Paris. When he betrays his own guilt, Frankie breaks the engagement and later marries David Powell, who has loved her all along.",
