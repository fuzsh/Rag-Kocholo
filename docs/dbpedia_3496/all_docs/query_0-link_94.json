        "text": "H. Harold Hartzler (1908-1993) Physics\n\nFor many years a very active ASA member and professor of physics and astronomy at Mankato State University, Mankato, MN since 1958, died Thursday, 9 Dec 1993, at age 85. \"H3,\" as he was sometimes known in ASA circles, graduated from Juniata College, Huntingdon, PA in 1930, and from Rutgers U., Newark, NJ, in 1934, where he received a doctorate in physics. With post-graduate work at Pennsylvania State U., U. of Michigan, and U. of Arizona, Harold was well-prepared in his long and full career in teaching - first as a professor of mathematics and astronomy and dean of men at Elizabethtown (PA) College from 1935-1937. Then, it was off to Goshen College, where Harold settled in from 1937 to 1958.\n\nBesides the ASA, Harold belonged to numerous learned societies involved in mathematics, astronomy, physics, and education, and to various honorary societies, including Sigma Xi. He was the first Executive Secretary of the ASA. His funeral announcement in the Goshen News noted his membership in the ASA and that \"He was the only person who attended every one of the 31 national meetings of the American Scientific Affiliation.\" He published numerous papers in JASA and PSCF. While unable to attend one of his later meetings in person, Harold \"showed up\" via the medium of videotape. Harold was the \"heart of the ASA for many years, heading up the ASA office and acting as as peace-maker in contentious times. He mentored younger members to become involved in the affairs of the organization. The Editor (Walt Hearn), while in Oregon in the early '70s, remembers an OR Local Section Annual Meeting at which Harold, then traveling about the country, gave a lively luncheon talk about relations between the ASA and ICR. Harold was also a member of the Creation Research Society. He valiently sought to bridge the gap between creationists and those who found a place for evolution. One of Harold's long-term projects was a study of Amish and Mennonite genealogy and history. Duane Kauffmann, 1950 Photo, Newsletter*\n\ntop\n\nCharles Hatfield (1920-1993) Mathematics\n\nDied at age 73 on Wednesday, 17 Nov 1993. Shortly after being able to come home from the hospital on 22 June for two days to celebrate his 50th wedding anniversary with Muriel and family, his health rapidly declined. Born in Kentucky, Dr. Hatfield graduated summa cum laude from Georgetown College in 1940. and received an M.A. from the University of Kentucky. After obtaining his Ph.D. in mathematics from Cornell University in 1944 and completing two years of active duty in the USNR, he joined the mathematics faculty of the University of Minnesota, moving from there to North Dakota in 1960.\n\nHis long teaching career included graduate teaching assistant at U. of Kentucky and Cornell, assistant professor at the U. of Minnesota from 1946-1960; professor and math dept. chairman at the U. of North Dakota, 1960-1964; and chairman and senior professor of mathematics at the U. of Missouri-Rolla until his retirement. Besides developing new courses at the U. of MO in abstract algebra and number theory, he was a most valued advisor and group lecturer. Chuck was deeply involved with the ASA as Council Member and President, author, lecturer, promoter of Christian scholarship. In addition to serving on the board of governors of the Mathematical Association of America (1975-1977), he was a member of the American Mathematical Society and Sigma Xi. He taught Morning Bible Class at First Presbyterian Church and Rolla Bible Church. Chuck was also a member of the board of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship and the Institute for Advancement of Christian Studies. Muriel Hatfield, Elving Anderson, Newsletter*\n\ntop\n\nJohn D. Haynes (1919-2000) Biometrician\n\nAmerican Cyanamid Company Pearl River, New York. This industrial biometrician, a servant of science. Died 2-21-2000 in Nanuet NY. Born 4-11-1919 in PA. US Army 1942-45 enlisting in Buffalo, NY Long term ASA member and leader in the NY Section (1965-2000). He noted in a Ramm memorial article: \"[...this] servant of science, who just had had theological questionings satisfied by studying Mere Christianity, Miracles, and Problem of Pain, all by C.S. Lewis, welcomed the appearance of The Christian View of Science and Scripture as an eminently logical, scholarly treatise, which met a definite need and kept me in the fold.\" Newsletter .\n\ntop\n\nWalter R. Hearn (1926-2017) Biochemist\n\nWalter Russell Hearn died on April 11, 2017, at the age of 91. He was born in Houston, Texas, on February 1, 1926. Walt grew up in Houston and majored in chemistry at Rice University. He received a PhD in biochemistry at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1951. After doing research for a year at Yale Medical School and for three years at Baylor College of Medicine, he spent 17 years on the biochemistry faculty at Iowa State University until 1971. His research interests included peptide chemistry, hypothalamic hormones, and bacterial pigment biosynthesis.\n\nFor five years Walt was a Visiting Biologist to Colleges for the American Institute of Biological Sciences. He is a Fellow and Life Member of AAAS and an Emeritus member of the American Chemical Society. In 1972 he switched professions and moved to Berkeley to do free-lance editorial work with his wife Virginia. They have edited periodicals and some 200 books, largely for Christian publishers.\n\nWalt joined ASA while he was in grad school and served on the Executive Council in the 1960s. From 1969 to 1993 he edited the ASA newsletter. He was a coauthor of the widely distributed publication, Teaching Science in a Climate of Controversy (ASA, 1986), author of Being a Christian in Science (IVP, 1997), and dedicated contributor and advisor to God & Nature.\n\nHe has also contributed chapters to a number of books, the latest being \"Creation Matters\" in Darwin and the Bible: The Cultural Confrontation (Penguin Academic, 2009), edited by anthropologists Richard Robbins and Mark Cohen. His articles, reviews, and poems have appeared in such publications as Perspectives on Science & Christian Faith and the Berkeley publication Radix, for which Ginny has been copy editor for over 40 years. Walt was once \"poetry rejection editor\" for Radix magazine. Walt and Ginny have strong IVCF backgrounds, helped to launch New College for Advanced Christian Studies in the 1980s, and are members of Berkeley's First Presbyterian Church.*\n\nRonald L. Numbers wrote in The Creationists (1992), \"As one of the first biochemists to play an active role in the ASA, Hearn felt a God-given responsibility to inform members about the growing importance [in the 1950s] of biochemistry in theories of evolution ... Because of his outspokenness, he often found himself the center of controversy with the ASA, but because of his unfailingly sweet temper, he seldom made enemies.\"\n\n\"Everybody in the 'science-faith game' has a history,\" Hearn wrote in a 2014 essay. \"As a minor-league player recalling many seasons, what 'strikes' me is the number of 'big-leaguers' I've actually known.\" He proceeded to relate his encounters with such figures as Harry Rimmer, Henry Morris, Ronald L. Numbers, John C. Greene, John Polkinghorne, Duane Gish, Francis Collins, Phillip Johnson, Michael Denton, Forrest Mims, Robert Russell, Ian Barbour, and NCSE's Eugenie C. Scott.**\n\nWalt was one of the most active and prolific advocates for the ASA, urging everyone he knew to consider joining the organization that meant so much to him. ASA members came to know him through his 25 years of insightful and witty comments in the newsletter and his ubiquitous presence at the annual meetings. He was a major factor in helping Emily Ruppel found the God & Nature online magazine, serving as a regular contributor and advisor. He provided two years of postings to be published in forthcoming issues. Walt not only ministered to people through writings and personal interactions but also by example. He made the transition to a basic lifestyle that emphasized thrift and ecological sustainability and giving to others. His famous talks on âdumpster divingâ opened many eyes to the waste that permeates our society.\n\nThe ASA was shaped in many ways by Walt and he will be sorely missed until we all warmly greet him again in glory.\n\n*God and Nature\n\n**NCSE\n\ntop\n\nRussell Heddendorf (1930-2008) Sociology\n\nProfessor of sociology at Covenant College, Lookout Mountain, GA from 1982-2000, died of heart failure on Dec. 24, 2008, at age 78. He was born on June 11. 1930 on Long Island, N.Y., and graduated from Queens College in New York City. He received his Ph.D. in sociology after graduate study at Columbia University and the University of Pittsburgh Following his Army service in Korea and Japan during the Korean War, Russ married Eleanor Pearce in 1954. He taught at Dickinson and Geneva Colleges prior to going to Covenant. His main concentrations in the field were social theory and sociology of religion and he founded the Association of Christians Teaching Sociology (ACTS) in 1976.\n\nRussell was particularly concerned with the idea of Christian calling as opposed to career and the conflicts of living in and not of the world. Not long ago he published From Faith to Fun, which deals with the sociological aspects of humor contrasted with the Christian idea of joy. He also wrote Hidden Threads (1994). Russell was an adjunct professor after he retired and kept very busy in the department up until the end. His ASA publications included: Sociology (1958), The Church and Race: An Experiment On Futility (1965), Religion, Science and the Challenge of Modernity (1986), Another Perspective on Dooyeweerdian social theory (1991).\n\n\"He loved to travel and visited his daughter who was a missionary in France. He leaves his wife, Harriet, son David, and daughter Ruth Ann. Russ had a love of travel and exploring the world. He enjoyed camping with Ellie and their children and with Harriet made a number of visits to Europe. He was devoted to preserving a connection with his relatives in the Alsace region of France. Russ played tennis, and was a lifelong Dodgers baseball fan. He sang in several church choirs, worked diligently on his yard, and was proficient in the theory and practice of humor. He was a member of Lookout Mountain Presbyterian Church, and with Harriet enjoyed the ministry of Rivermont Presbyterian Church in Chattanooga where he taught Sunday School and led a men's Bible study.\" Bio., Newsletter*\n\ntop\n\nMilford F. Henkel ( -1969)\n\nOf Pierson, Michigan, died on July 12, 1969, in an automobile accident, of which his wife, Julie, was the only survivor.

Bob is survived by his loving wife of 69 years, Elizabeth (Betty) Herrmann; his children, Stephen Herrmann and his wife Anne of Pembroke, MA; Karen Ritter and her husband John of Tulsa, OK; Holly Waite and her husband Geoff of Topsfield, MA; Anders Herrmann and his wife Celine of Beverly, MA.\n\nBorn on July 17, 1928, in New York City to Philip and Florence Herrmann, Bob grew up in Queens. His family attended a Plymouth Brethren group in Manhattan. He studied chemistry at Purdue University, interrupted by two years of service in the Navy on USS Shenandoah. In 1950 Bob married his childhood sweetheart, Betty Ann Cook, a year before completing his chemistry degree at Purdue. He earned a PhD at Michigan State University and came to MIT in 1956 for a post-doc as a Damon Runyon Fellow in Biology. There he met another post-doc in chemistry, Walter Thorson, who was also in the Plymouth Brethren group. He later joined the faculty of Boston University, teaching biochemistry there for 17 years while consulting for the V.A. in Bedford. In 1976 he joined the biochemistry faculty at Oral Roberts University School of Medicine in Tulsa, OK, before returning to New England.\n\nBob joined the American Scientific Affiliation in 1957 shortly after arriving at MIT. He became active in ASA, for example, leading a discussion at the 1969 annual meeting at Gordon College on âCan a Christian Accept a Mechanistic Origin of Life?â In 1974 he lectured at Gordon College on âChristian Faith and the Scientific Mind.â Together with more than a dozen other ASA members, Bob was a member of the Federation Christian Fellowship subgroup of the American Societies for Experimental Biology. He was elected to the ASA Executive Council in 1978 while he was on the faculty at the Oral Roberts University School of Medicine. He was serving as president of the council when, in 1981, the council was informed that Bill Sisterson was unexpectedly resigning as executive director. Bob was eager to go back to the Northeast and was also very interested in leading the ASA which was then located in Elgin, Illinois. Sensing an opportunity, Jack Haas at Gordon College helped construct a package deal that would give Bob an adjunct professor and pre-med advisor position at Gordon as well as being Executive Director of the ASA, if ASA would move its headquarters to the Northeast. The deal was accepted and the Herrmanns moved to Ipswich, MA. His house became the ASA headquarters, which later moved to leased space in downtown Ipswich.\n\nThe ASA was privileged to have Bob serve as Executive Director from 1981 to 1994. He was a major factor in revitalizing the ASA. An unfortunate office fire in 1979 had destroyed many records and the sudden departure of Executive Director Bill Sisterson left the ASA in a difficult situation. Harry Lubansky served as an interim director until Bob was able to move to Ipswich and take the reins.\n\nPerhaps Bob is best known for pursuing the John Templeton connection to ASA. While perusing the membership list for possible sources of funding, Bob noticed that John M. Templeton was a member. Knowing of his investment prowess, Bob visited him at Lyford Cay in the Bahamas while Bob was vacationing there. John immediately solicited Bobâs help in reviewing a book he was writing. Soon their relationship blossomed, leading to five jointly authored books. Meanwhile, John became a fan of the ASA, supplying both some funding as well as additional visibility and members from the Unity Church. In 1987 Bob helped John found the John Templeton Foundation (JTF) which currently is one of the largest sources of funding for research in science and faith. Bob published eight articles in PSCF, four of which were co-authored with John Templeton.\n\nOne of the most significant ventures that Bob initiated and led was the ASA/Templeton Lecture series. Funded by the JTF, the ASA managed a nation-wide series of lectures at colleges and universities on science and faith, raising awareness of both the ASA and issues of science and faith. When Bob retired in 1994, Don Munro succeeded him as executive director and continued working out the logistics of the lecture series which concluded around 2003.\n\nHe loved his family and enjoyed birdwatching, boating, the company of dogs, and discussions on science and Christian faith. He will be greatly missed and remembered with affection.\n\nFor those of us who knew him personally, Bob was a great inspiration. I recall attending both annual meetings and local chapter meetings of the ASA where Bob took specific interest in me, welcoming and encouraging me. The JTF and Gordon College continue to sponsor an annual lecture series in his honor, sustaining the work that he dearly loved.\n\nRandy Isaac\n\ntop\n\nJohn Hiben (1925-1984) Psychology of Parsons, Kansas,\n\nDied in July 1984 at age 59, according to a note from his wife, Marian. Born in Minneapolis, John graduated from Bethel College and did graduate work in psychology at Minnesota and Kansas, earning an M.A. in 1961. At the time of his death he was a clinical psychologist at the Parsons State Hospital and Training Center, and an active participant in the First Baptist Church of Parsons.\n\ntop\n\nAllan MacRae (1902-1997) Biblical Scholar\n\nPassed away in his sleep at the age of 95 on Sep. 27, 1997. His son, John, said that \"he was always thankful to be a part of the ASA and to contribute to it.\" Allan was a prof. of systematic theology and apologetics at Biblical Theological Seminary. He studied under R. A. Torrey, who advised him to go to Princeton Theological Seminary. There, he studied under Robert Dick Wilson and J. Gresham Machen, and became convinced of the necessity of a scholarly defense of the inspiration of the Scriptures. Later, during his time at the U. of Berlin, he made a trip to Palestine, where he met archaeologist Sir Flinders Petrie and studied under William F. Albright. With Albright, he participated in the exciting discovery of the biblical city of Ham (Gen. 14).\n\nAfter returning from Europe, he assumed a professorship of Old Testament at Westminster Theological Seminary for eight years, then completed his Ph.D. at the U. of Pennsylvania under Ephraim A. Speiser. In 1937, he joined with Carl McIntire and others, with no resources but faith, to form Faith Theological Seminary, and served as its first president. Among the members of the entering class were Vernon Grounds, John W. Sanderson Jr., Norman Jerome and Jack W. Murray.\n\nDuring the 1943-44 school year, a student, Grace E. Sanderson, became his wife. During their honeymoon in the Grand Canyon, three army fliers parachuted out of a failing bomber, floated into the canyon and spent the next ten days on an isolated plateau. The search for these airmen drew nationwide attention. A veteran park ranger, aware that MacRae, a veteran of many long Canyon trips, was there at the time, sent word to join him in the rescue attempt. They went down from the north rim, located a narrow deer trail down the precipitous cliffs and brought the three fliers out in good health. The story made Time and other magazines, and all the newspapers. MacRae used the many invitations to speak of the adventure to drive home a gospel application to thousands in many different kinds of organizations and settings.\n\nIn 1971, he joined Jack W. Murray in establishing the Biblical School of Theology, and retired as its president in 1983. Some of his former students include: Francis A. Schaeffer, Joseph T. Bayley, Vernon Grounds, Kenneth S. Kantzer, Arthur F. Glasser, G. Douglas Young, Samuel J. Shultz, Jack W. Murray, R. Laird Harris, and Paul Gilchrist. Allan's boyhood friend, John's Uncle Phil, told him that one of the things he appreciated about his father was that he had never heard him demeaning other people or groups. John said: \"My father was involved in several church conflicts, but I never heard him denouncing other believers. In the midst of differences, he tried to stay focused on the principles rather than the personalities. The cause of Christ was what mattered to him.\"\n\nMacRae had also done work for the NIV Bible translation, was president of Evangelical Theological Seminary, and was an honorary fellow of the ASA. He participated in the early conventions of the ASA and encouraged other conservative theologians and biblical scholars to join the organization.

His early childhood centered on family involvement within the Evangelical Covenant Church. That deep commitment to his church and faith continuedafter they moved out to California and settled in Eagle Rock in 1938.\n\nAfter serving in the U.S. Army Air Force for two years at the end of WWII, Vern attended UCLA. He graduated in 1950, with a degree in mathematics and went towork in the fledgling computer industry. One of the computers to which he made major contributions is now on display in the Smithsonian Museum of American History in Washington D.C., and another at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif.\n\nIn 1950, he married Marilyn Hite. They had four children: Janice Magnuson of Tujunga, Susan Vincent of Fullerton, Donald Magnuson DDS of Penn Valley, and Sharon Geller of Thousand Oaks. They lived in Gardena and San Pedro before moving to Thousand Oaks in 1974 when he was hired by Burroughs Corporation, then in Westlake Village. He subsequently worked for several other area employers in the computer industry, retiring in 1997 from Seagate Corporation after a 47-year career in computer design and engineering. His Christian faith was the center of home and personal life.Vern was always a lover of classical and gospel music. For many years he led the music program at Inglewood Covenant Church. Friends and family have special memories of the fun fellowship sing-along's. His interest in choral music led him to join the Los Robles Master Chorale- originally the Moorpark College Masterworks Chorale - where he met his second wife, Barbara, whom he married in 1989. Continued participation in the Chorale was important to them for another fourteen years.\n\nVern and Barbara attended Pleasant Valley Baptist Church of amarillo. For the last seven years they have been members of Emmanuel Presbyterian Church of Thousand Oaks, where they sang in the choir for several years, and continue to participate in several small study groups. The warm friendships and support of this church family, the love of Christ and the comfort of the Holy Spirit have carried them through the sometimes-difficult years since Vern's stroke while on a trip to New Zealand in 2006.\n\nVern was a long-time member of the American Scientific Affiliation (ASA), a fellowship of Christians in scientific occupations. He and Barbara attended many of the annual ASA meetings held each summer on various college campuses across the USA and in England, which provided starting points for many enjoyable travel experiences. In addition, Vern and Barbara enjoyed five concert tours in Europe with the Chorale and three trips with Elderhostel, plus trips to England, Egypt, the Aegean, Sweden, Canada, and most of the 50 U.S. states. One of their favorite destinations has been presidential libraries, having visited all but the newest GW Bush library in Dallas. Vern is survived by his wife, Barbara Magnuson; his former wife, Marilyn Magnuson of Simi Valley and their four children; three stepchildren, sixteen grand and great-grandchildren, and assorted sons and daughters-in law also loved this gentle and honorable Christian man.\n\nVernon was called Home to be with the Lord on April 29, 2013, after a six-year struggle with late stroke effects. Vern was known to those who knew him as a very tender man, never demanding your attention. He was honorable and loved to give honor to others.\n\nBarbara remembers him as so incredibly patient, a patience that was sorely tried in his final years when he was confined to the wheelchair and could barely speak. His was a gentle spirit that we will all sorely miss. Abstracted from Ventura County Star from May 1 to May 4, 2013.\n\ntop\n\nHoward V.

He was born on April 22, 1924, Derbyshire, England. The family emigrated to Canada in 1930 during the depression to seek religious freedom and economic stability. Frank attended a one room school, graduating early, and immediately enrolled at the University of BC to study math and physics. During those years, he worked at a can factory, raced velodrome bicycles, and ran track and field.\n\nAfter graduating with a Masterâs Degree in physics, he enrolled in the Navy as an officer in the Canadian services and served on the Camperdown, a destroyer of the 19th Destroyer Flotilla, British Pacific Fleet. He was the chief radar officer on his ship, and one of the first radar experts in the Navy. Prince Philip was the chief radar officer of the fleet, and he and Frank shared daily phone calls to calibrate their clocks and their radar positions.\n\nHe subsequently attended Purdue University to study physics, where he was on a team of researchers that built the first synchrotron, precursor to the cyclotron. It was there he met his future wife Anne through Inter Varsity Christian Fellowship, was married, and Lisa and David were born. Late in life, one of his favorite memories was a visit to the CERN Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland, where one of his guides was his grand-nephew, grandson of his brother Stephen. He never lost his love of nuclear physics!\n\nFrank took a teaching position at the Colorado School of Mines before he finished his doctorate. Summers were spent working on research projects for the National Bureau of Standards, DECO Electronics, the U.S. Navy, US AID and the American Scientific Affiliation. His travels took him to far- flung destinations experiencing local living conditions, and challenging projects â some classified, some pertaining to alternative energy generation. Some of his research projects involved sea ice flows, low frequency radio wave transmission for submarine communications as well as deep space radio astronomy.\n\nIn 1964, joined a PhD program in Geophysics in the Oceanography Department at Oregon State University. His focus of research was the Sicilian volcano, Mt. Etna. His advisor was a renowned Icelandic vulcanologist, and he spent months on the slopes of Mt. Etna collecting data before writing his dissertation. Collecting data meant lying next to the hot lava flows wearing an Asbestos and foil body suit measuring electromagnetic currents using probes inserted into the flowing lava to determine pyroclastic potentiality. He loved that the Italian Nonna (grandmothers) would send baskets of food up the mountain for lunch and dinner via cable car.\n\nBack in Colorado after graduating from OSU, Frank was involved in setting up the Colorado Solar Energy Research Institute, and taught the first course in Solar Energy at CSM. He served on numerous Mines faculty committees, was President of MVCC in 1971 and 1972, and of The English-Speaking Union Denver Chapter in 1997 and 1998. He was a member of the Plymouth Brethren Bible Chapels in Denver, Lakewood, and Littleton and continued his involvement with Inter Varsity Christian Fellowship.\n\nDuring his time at CSM, Frank joined the American Scientific Affiliation. His good friend Ken Touryan provided this report. âFrank, John Vayhinger and Gordon Brown of CU led the local Rocky Mtn ASA, starting in mid-1980s. They organized ASA activities, including biannual meetings and inviting local and out of state speakers. Frank was the driving force behind all these activities, including the planning of the ASA Annual 2003 held at the Colorado Christian University. Frank worked behind the scenes and never took credit for his efforts. He leaned towards ID regarding Origins, but always said \"God did it but how\". He recruited me in 1996 to be active in local ASA affairs.â\n\nAfter he retired from CSM in 1986, he and Anne relocated to Kingston, Jamaica for two years, where he was involved with US AID in setting up a solar crop drying facility presumably to dry coconut, coffee and bananas.\n\ntop\n\nEnoch E.

He thereafter gained an M.S. in zoology from Michigan State College, and a Ph.D. in anatomy from the University of Illinois School of Medicine in Chicago, shortly after returning to Wheaton to teach.\n\nHe was professor of zoology there from 1945, and was chairman of the Science Division from 1950 to 1961. Mixter joined the ASA in 1943, served as its president from 1951-54, and the editor of its journal from 1965-1968. After a brief flirtation with flood geology, Mixter advocated the viewpoint that he called progressive creationism for the rest of his life. Along with Wheaton compatriot J. Frank Cassel, he led the ASA away from antievolutionism, bringing evangelicals into harmony with modern biology, whilst\n\nsto ping short of an outright endorsement of theistic evolution. His parents were Floyd B. Mixter, a salesman, and Florence (Barlow) Mixter. He married Emilie Claus (died August 2, 1998) on June 27, 1931, and they had four children: Wilbur, Joan (Mrs. Jerry Sweers), Ruth, Priscilla (Mrs. Gordon Gault). Wheaton College awards the Mixter Award for junior or senior Biology majors in his honor, in recognition of his \"significant role in the development of biology at Wheaton College\". --Wikipedia Also article by D.

He had been suffering from Alzheimer's for about seven years, but still enjoyed reading, crossword puzzles, and Scrabble. David, the oldest child of Swedish emigrants, was born in Montevideo, MN, on February 13, 1922, to Rev. Fred L. Moberg (Sigfrid Ludwig) and Anna Euphrosyne Sundberg. David is survived by his children Lynette (David) Janssen, Jonathan (Donna), and Philip (Darlene), daughter-in-law Silvia, six grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his parents, his siblings Ruth, Nancy Simmons, Stanley and Alden, his wife Helen, his second wife Marlys, his daughter Joyann, and his son D. Paul.\n\nDavid served in the Army during World War II and left as a Staff Sergeant. His service was primarily in the Intelligence Corps.\n\nDavid was Emeritus Professor of Sociology at Marquette University. His areas of specialization included methodology in qualitative research, sociology of religion, sociology of American evangelicals, and gerontology. Professor Moberg taught sociology for nineteen years at Bethel College, St. Paul, Minnesota, ending as Department Chair, and in 1968 he accepted a position as Professor of Sociology and Department Chair at Marquette University, leaving the Chairmanship in 1977 and retiring in 1991.\n\nDavid was a prolific author, writing and editing 28 books and hundreds of articles in professional journals. Some of his books include Inasmuch, The Church as a Social Institution, The Great Reversal, Wholistic Christianity, The Church and the Older Person, Aging and Spirituality, and Spiritual Well-Being. A complete collection of his works is kept at Wheaton College, Wheaton, IL.\n\nHe joined the American Scientific Affiliation in 1956 having learned of the ASA at Bethel College and from the Journal of the ASA. He quickly became involved in the ASA leadership and was elected an ASA Fellow. He was a nominee for the executive council in 1959. He was a strong advocate of the social sciences in ASA, organizing the Social Science commission in 1961. David was on the editorial board of the Journal of the ASA and became editor in 1961 until 1964. He served on the program committee for the 1963 ASA Annual Meeting. He published 23 articles and correspondence in the ASA journals.\n\n\"He was exceptionally modest, and never bragged about all his accomplishments,\" to quote a colleague.\n\nDavid chose to donate his body to the Medical College of Wisconsin.\n\ntop\n\nEdwin Monsma (1895-1972) Biology\n\n(picture 1950) biology professor emeritus of Calvin College, died in his Grand Rapids, Michigan, home on January 17, 1972.

He is survived by his wife Margaret and four children. Irwin was known throughout the world as producer and host of the famous Moody science films. He founded the Moody Institute of Science, a branch of Moody Bible Institute, Dr. Irwin A. Moon presented his famous million-volt demonstration before hundreds of thousands in his unique Sermons from Science lectures and directed it until his retirement in 1972. Under his direction MIS produced 39 educational films, which won 27 national and international awards. After retirement he remained active in its work as an advisor and friend of the staff.\n\nWorking with youth as a young pastor in Los Angeles, Moon found the visual approach especially effective in reaching young people with the gospel. He devised a set of the old 31/4 by 41/4 inch glass slides entitled, \"The Microscope, the Telescope, and the Bible.\" That presentation eventually formed the basis of the first Moody science film, \"The God of Creation.\"\n\nIn the 1930's according to Alton Everest, \"The American Scientific Affiliation owes its existence directly to Irwin Moon. He saw that many of the students he counseled had questions about the relationship of science to Christian faith. He convinced Will H. Houghton, president of Moody Bible Institute, of the need to do something. Houghton then arranged that first meeting in 1941 from which sprang the ASA.\"\n\nOut of a flood of memories, Alton was surprised to find one in particular that kept coming back, from a time when they were working together 40 years ago on the film, \"Voice of the Deep.\" Alton wrote, \"We were both in Navy deep-sea diving outfits on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean at Emerald Cove, Santa Catalina Island. Suddenly the reassuring throb of the engine driving the air compressor sped, leaving only a couple of minutes of air in our suits. Also eliminated was the usual method of ascent by blowing up the suit and shooting up like a balloon. Now it was grunt work, hand over hand up a line. When we finally reached the line, I motioned for Irwin to climb up first. He motioned for me to do the same. That Alfonso-Gaston procedure went ' on for some time, wasting precious seconds, until I realized anew that Irwin would rather suffocate than give in. Not being endowed with such competitive drive and rather yearning for a breath of air, I gave in. \"That was the Irwin we knew and loved, and whose talents and ability we respected. He is gone now, but the institutions he established continue to do the Lord's work.\" Newsletter, Also, Everest, History of the ASA. *\n\ntop\n\nStanley Wayne Moore (1937â2022), Political scientist\n\nStanley Wayne Moore, age 84, of Â­Pasadena, California, passed away on Wednesday, January 5, 2022.

Morris (1918-2006) Civil Engineer\n\n(Oct 6, 1918 - Feb 25, 2006) Ccreationist leader, dies at Age 87. Henry M. Morris died February 25 after a series of strokes. Eugenie C. Scott told the New York Times that Morris was the most important creationist of the 20th century, much more so than William Jennings Bryan. As director of the National Center for Science Education, Scott dismissed Morris books as having no scientific merit, but she recalled his cordial, gentlemanly manner and said: I feel he was absolutely sincere about his convictions that the Bible was literally true and that science would support it and creation science was good science.\n\n\"Morris grew up in Texas in the 1920s and 1930s. He graduated from Rice University with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering in 1939. He married Mary Louise on January 24, 1940, and they later had six children. After his graduation in 1939, and through 1942, he was a hydraulic engineer working with the International Boundary and Water Commission. He returned to Rice, teaching civil engineering from 1942 until 1946. In 1946 he wrote a short book entitled That You Might Believe (1946). From 1946 through 1951, he studied at the University of Minnesota, where he was awarded a master's degree in hydraulics (1948) and a Ph.D. in hydraulic engineering (1950). In 1951 he became a professor and chair of civil engineering at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.\" Wikipedia After fifteen years in faculty positions at Rice U., U. of Minnesota, U. of Southern Louisiana, and Southern Illinois U., Morris became head of the civil engineering department at Virginia Polytechnic Institute. During his thirteen years there, the school program grew to become one of the nation's largest. His 1963 textbook on applied hydraulics is still in use.\n\nWhen his book The Genesis Flood (co-authored with theologian John Whitcomb) became popular, a new administrator decided Morris was too controversial. In the words of the Los Angeles Times, When he was asked to drop his creationist writings from his resume, Morris knew it was time to move on He founded the Institute for Creation Research and co-founded what is now San Diego Christian C. His biographical listings appear in Who's Who in Science, Antiquity to Present; Who's Who in America; American Men of Science; Who in Engineering; Who's Who in Science and Engineering; Who's Who in the World and Contemporary Authors.\n\nMorris was an ASA member and Fellow during its early years. His passing is an opportunity for those of us in ASA to demonstrate our appreciation for differing perspectives and interpretations. In the spirit of Robert Fischer's book, God Did It, But How, we may differ in the methods and the timeframe in which the Creator did it, but we show solidarity with anyone who acknowledges, It is he who has made us, and not we ourselves.

He graduated from the U. of Toronto in 1949, and got his PhD from the U. of IL in 1955. He then directed research for Maple Leaf Mills, Ltd. until 1971, when he became professor and chairman of the dept. of animal and poultry science at the U. of Guelph until his retirement in 1992. His research area was the nutrition of animals. Doug had a foundational role in the CSCA and was also recent (1999) CSCA Executive Director. Doug's obituary noted that \"His faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour was the central theme and primary philosophy of his life and determined his decisions and actions.\"\n\nDoug addressed the Guelph graduating class two months before he died, wishing them success as he defined it: \"Over 2,000 years ago, a Hebrew writer penned what I believe to be a true description of success. He wrote: 'And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.' This definition acknowledges God and presupposes absolutes.\" He then explained these three character qualities.

Glenn was born on April 16, 1950. After a childhood in Oklahoma and attending Oklahoma University, he had an illustrious career in the oil business and explored an incredible number of interests outside of his career.\n\nHe joined the ASA in 1996 and published more than a dozen articles and letters in PSCF. He was an active participant on the ASA listserv. Ted Davis noted âA former YEC who published many articles in creationist journals, Glenn became an OEC after very thorough research into some of the scientific problems with the YEC view of a global flood. He became an influential voice in the creationist conversations. By his own account, he nearly fell into atheism in the process, but came out of it with his Christian faith intact.â\n\ntop\n\nDonald W.

He graduated from upper Darby High School and received a Bachelor's Degree cum laude in biology from Wheaton College, Illinois, and a MS and PhD in zoology from Penn State University. He served for a time in the US Army and was stationed in Fort Dix, NJ. He married Joyce Thomas in 1961, and they lived together in Houghton, NY; Ipswich, MA; Elizabeth City, NC; and Orlando, FL. Don was a biology professor at Houghton College, NY, and then the director of the American Scientific Affiliation in Ipswich, MA, until he retired.\n\nDon learned about the ASA as a Wheaton student from his professor, Russell Mixter. He joined the ASA in 1962. During his 28 years at Houghton College, Donâs ASA activities included serving on the executive council from 1981â1986, as local arrangements chair for the 1986 Annual Meeting at Houghton, as chairman of the bioethics commission, and as program chair of the 1994 Annual Meeting at Bethel University in Minnesota on the topic Bioethics: Perils and Promise. When Bob Herrmann stepped down as executive director, Don applied for the position. He began to serve as executive director in July of 1994, serving through 2004.\n\nDuring his tenure, he managed the Templeton-ASA lecture series through a major grant from the Templeton Foundation. The Templeton involvement included at least 360 lectures in almost 200 different colleges, universities, or seminaries with an average attendance of over 250 per lecture. In 1994 in his first annual meeting as director, the ASA website was created by Terry Gray and Jack Haas. Later the ASA listserv was established for dialogue among ASA members.

Jim Neidhardt (1934-1993) Physics\n\nJim, an active ASA member, died unexpectedly at age 59 of a sudden heart attack on July 15 1993, in bed. His recently published book, coauthored by James E. Loder, was The Knight's Move: The Relational Logic of the Spirit in Theology and Science, Helmers & Howard, 1992. He was an influential physics professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ for 31 years and an active member in the local NY ASA section.\n\nJim befriended numerous scientists and theologians from various countries at the Center for Theological Inquiry in Princeton and helped many seminarians and graduate students at several universities. Jim was author of numerous JASA papers and a promoter of Michael Polanyi's ideas. Many of us will remember his frequent use of graphic illustrations to explain various relationships.\n\nTribute was paid Jim by his co-author of The Knight's Move, Dr. James Loder, in a memorial service on 20 Jul 93. Loder emphasized in his eulogy that, as a whole person, Jim did not detach his intellect from his heart\" and loved to place himself in the biblical tradition \"so the labor of his mind was generated in and from his heart.\" His remarkable energy \"was matched by genuine humility and a delightful sense of humor. His humor seemed usually to embody the comment from Niels Bohr that he loved to repeat Bohr's comment to a young physicist who complained that there was too much humor at the Bohr Institute. \"People should be more serious,\" the young physicist exclaimed. To which Bohr replied, \"Some things are so serious that they must be taken with a sense of humor.\" I think this was the source of Jim's humor. He took serious things seriously and that was the source of much of his humor about lesser things. Jim also \"seemed to have more sorrow or compassion rather than anger at those physicists, theologians, scientists who apparently could not see or comprehend the grace of God\" but also, \"nothing gave him more joy than the triumph of a sound Biblically-based theological argument in the face of a reductionist and secularized concept of humanity, nature, cosmology.\"\n\nBelieving, as his mentors Tom Torrance and Harold Nebelsick, in the contingency in all things upon the grace of God, his \"service was rendered most of the time in an atmosphere of scientific hostility, to the deepest conviction of his- heart, that science and theology belonged together.\" In closing, Loder alluded to the good that could continue from Jim's effort, though he is no longer among us. And indeed, even now in the ASA, such fruit is being manifested. Robert T. Voss was introduced to the ASA by Jim and has recently relocated from the New York-New Jersey ASA local section (of which Jim Neidhardt was a member) to Pittsburgh, where a new local section is in formation.

Nida (1914-2011) Linguistics\n\nRevolutionized Bible Translations, Dead at 96 his name might not be prominent, but Eugene A. Nida's influence can be found in most Christian homes-more specifically, in their Bibles. Nida, one of the leading advocates for dynamic equivalence translation, died August 25, 2011 at a hospital in Brussels, Belgium. He was 96.\n\nDynamic equivalence translation (a phrase which Nida coined) is a \"meaning-based\" approach to biblical translation; it focuses on translating \"thought-for-thought\" rather than \"word-for-word.\" In a 2002 interview with Christianity Today, Nida said that this shift in translation was his most important contribution: \"To help people be willing to say what the text means, not what the words are, but what the text means.\" Nida's career in translation began in 1936, when he graduated summa cum laude from the University of California, Los Angeles with a B.A. in Greek and a minor in Latin.\n\nThe summer after he graduated, Nida attended the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL), a faith-based nonprofit that serves language communities by using research, training, and development to \"build capacity for sustainable language development.\" After his introduction to SIL, Nida returned every summer from 1937 to 1953 to teach there. Nida continued his studies at the University of Southern California, where he earned a master's degree in New Testament Greek. He completed a doctorate in linguistics at the University of Michigan in 1943. That same year, he was hired by the American Bible Society as associate secretary of versions. He became the executive secretary for translations in 1946, a position that he held until his retirement in 1980. He was present at the founding conference of the United Bible Societies in 1946, and in 1949 he founded The Bible Translator, a journal featuring articles about the theory and practice of Bible translation.\n\nBy the late 1960s, Nida had published two books, Toward a Science of Translating (Brill, 1964), and The Theory and Practice of Translation (Brill, 1969, with C.R. Taber), advancing his new dynamic equivalence theory. He had also published a first edition of the Greek New Testament, which became a basis for other translators in their work. Nida spent much of his career traveling around the globe. By 1952, he had traveled to more than 30 countries and encountered more than 80 languages. In his travels, he met and trained teams to help them in their translation work. In 1978, he was praised by the Christian Herald as a man who \"has done more than any one person to provide people with Scripture they can read in their own language.\" The popularity and positive reception of The Good News Bible (also called the Today's English Version) lent credence to Nida's work, as it was translated using dynamic equivalence theory. Other versions, such as the New Living Translation and Contemporary English Version, are also heavily influenced by Nida's approach.\n\nIn his work, Nida emphasized the importance of cultural context - both the cultural context of Bible and the cultural context of the language into which the Bible is being translated. One example he liked to use was the parable of the sheep and the goats in Matthew 25, where the sheep represent those who have done the Lord's will, and the goats are those who haven't. \"Look out, because in most of Africa, sheep are regarded as very bad animals!\" he said in his 2002 interview. \"The translator, of course, cannot change all the sheep into goats and the goats into sheep. But you've got to have footnotes to explain the cultural difference. Otherwise, you're going to give an entirely wrong impression.\" However, Nida also emphasized something over the need for multiple, relatable translations: a desire to understand and spread the meaning of the Bible. \"What is really needed is for people to take the message seriously and share it with other people, focused primarily on what this message has meant to me,\" he said. \"So many Christians love to argue about the Bible rather than take it seriously as a message that is important for their own lives.

Harold graduated in chemistry from what is now the U. of Rhode Island and was employed in the dyeing and electrical industries before his retirement. He was active in \"people-to-people\" peace efforts between the U.S. and U.S.S.R., which he described in papers at our 1987 and 1988 Annual Meetings. It's hard to think of chemist Harold Northrup of Pawcatuck, Connecticut, as an \"old-timer\" even though he's an octogenarian. After all, immediately after the Colorado Springs meeting he went to China on the ASA tour.\n\nHis paper on \"Pathways to Good Will between Hostile Countries\" was based on his own experience traveling to the Soviet Union with a group exploring \"citizen diplomacy.\" He showed slides of his trip and handed out a bibliography on peace and peacemaking efforts. Harold urged ASA members not to overlook \"the influence for good of a single individual.\"How did Harold Northrup get interested in \"waging peace\"? For many years he did goal-oriented research in the storage-battery industry. Even after retirement he has been called back from time to time to help solve problems. It occurred to Harold that the Lord had given him a gift for solving problems, and he couldn't think of a more important problem than world peace. So he thought he'd take a crack at it. He knows its a tough problem but that's the kind he likes best. Besides, he says, all the easy problems have already been solved. He went on the ASA tour to China in 1987.

He earned an M.S. in 1944 and a Ph.D. in 1947 in physics from the Pennsylvania State University. His research there had an application of ultrasonic signaling for the U.S. Army Signal Corps.\n\nIn 1945 he married Beth, his wife of 44 years, until her death in 1989. His physics dissertation was titled âHigh Frequency Whistles: Edge Tones and Resonance,â with adviser Harold K. Schilling. He helped Wes form his own style of teaching and research, including striking a balance between the aims of science and religion. \"Wes was also a deeply religious man who loved God and tried to serve Him. He was active in his church (Community Lutheran) and in his community, and gave freely and generously to many charities. He loved to sing, and was in a barber shop quartet as a young man and in church choirs for many years thereafter.\" He had been an ASA member since 1989.\n\nHe was an assistant and associate professor at Brown University from 1950 to 1960, and since 1960 was a professor and on retirement, an emeritus professor of physics at the University of Vermont.\n\nWesâ career was devoted to biophysical acoustics, first at low frequencies and since the early 1950s primarily at ultrasonic frequencies of biomedical interest. He made significant contributions in many areas of ultrasound biophysics. His early work established a basis for much of our current knowledge of nonthermal mechanisms by which ultrasound interacts with biological materialsâparticularly important is the basic information that he had provided on the effects associated with acoustically driven bubble activity. He developed the theoretical basis of acoustic streaming, and he extended his work to investigating all sorts of ultrasonically induced movements and other nonthermal effects of ultrasound\n\nAs an ultrasound beam traverses tissue, it causes the local temperature to rise. The underlying theory was worked on by Wes, and he derived a number of important relationships that we use today in determining the anticipated temperature elevation that can result from medical applications of ultrasound.\n\nIn addition to being elected into membership of the National Academy of Engineering, he has been honored with the\n\ntitle fellow by the Acoustical Society of America, the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM), and the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences. He has served on the editorial boards of the Journal of Biological Physics, Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology, Ultrasonics, and Clinics in Diagnostic Ultrasound. He has written many chapters in scientific books and published many papers in scholarly journals.\n\nFor 22 years, Wes was the chair of National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements Scientific Committee No. 66, devoted to establishing guidelines for the safe use of ultrasound in medicine. Three volumes were published: (1)Biological Effects of Ultrasound: Mechanisms and Clinical Implications, in 1983; (2) Exposure Criteria for Medical Diagnostic Ultrasound: I. Criteria Based on Thermal Mechanisms, in 1992; and (3) Exposure Criteria for Medical Diagnostic Ultrasound: II. Criteria Based on All Known Mechanisms, in 2002. These volumes are considered the most authoritative documents in this field. It should be emphasized that Wes was not only the leader of this effort but also the major contributor of concepts and scientific input.

When all the tests were in, the doctor characterized the cancer as 'angry'.\" Too far gone for hospital care, Ed's last four days were spent in a hospital bed in the living room of the Olson home in Spokane, WA.\n\nEd was born 74 years ago in Gary, Indiana, grew up in Pittsburgh, PA, majored in chemical engineering at the U. of Pitt., and then worked for DuPont. In 1950, through the influence of two DuPont colleagues, he became a Christian. He left engineering in 1953 to attend seminary and teach chemistry and physics at Northwestern C. in Minneapolis, MN. He married Marlene, a student there, in 1954. They moved to New York in 1954, where Ed entered the doctoral program at Columbia U., in geochemistry, with a specialization in radiocarbon dating. He received his doctorate in 1963. Ed joined the Whitworth C. faculty in 1960, and established the Dept. of Geology.\n\nEd was a member of Trinity Baptist Church for nearly forty years.\n\nStephen C. Meyer of Whitworth C. included in his tribute to Ed: \"Somehow he saw potential in me that others didn't and that interest transformed me. He told me he liked reading my tests because my essays were clearly written. Now I write about science as a central part of my profession. During a term that Ed was faculty president, he asked me to teach his structural geology lab. Now I teach as a professor at Whitworth C. The summer after my sophomore year, Ed wrote me a letter encouraging me as a Christian and as a budding scientist. I remember reading the letter sitting on a tractor in the middle of a Montana alfalfa field, stunned that a professor would take the time in the middle of his summer to write me. Ed was never too full of himself to see potential in others. That's why I say he was humble. He was other directed. And his interest in others inspired them. And it changed lives.\"\n\nAn ASA Fellow, Ed was a ASA Council member (1984- 1988) and was interested in the science and politics of the environment. His recent 99-page work on the subject has yet to be published. S.C.

He lived independently until three months prior to his passing at age 80 from complications of acute kidney failure and sepsis.\n\nKen was born on December 5, 1942, and grew up in Longmont, Colorado, where he played on the high school tennis team and played trombone in band and orchestra. The first in his family to attend college, Ken attended Westmont College in Santa Barbara, California, and received his BA in Chemistry in 1964. During his college years, he enjoyed competing on the tennis team, tutoring in chemistry, working on the grounds crew, and playing the trombone in the college pep band. Ken earned an MS in both Biochemistry and Microbiology from Oregon State University in 1967. He then moved across the country to launch his career as a biochemist at Hoffman LaRoche (Nutley, NJ) in nucleic acid enzymology, from 1967 to 1979.\n\nHis career path took him to Genentech (South San Francisco, CA) from 1979 to 1997, as a scientist with a focus on recombinant DNA technology. He was one of the original 50 employees who had a vision to change the way that drugs were produced. One of his longtime colleagues stated, âYou are a real icon in the biotechnology businessâ and âyou turned a page of history.â He developed novel methods of protein purification and helped develop manufacturing processes for recombinant protein drugs, including Protropin (human growth hormone), Nutropin, Interleukin 12, and Somavert (PEG-Growth Hormone Antagonist).\n\nAfter Genentech, from 1999 to 2008 he served as Director of Research and Development at Allergan Pharmaceuticals in Fremont, CA. He led the development program for human collagen using fibroblasts from cell culture to the FDA-approved drugs CosmoDerm and CosmoPlast. In 2008, he began consulting services for multiple biotech companies in product development, process, and regulatory support. In his early retirement, he continued to share his expertise, mentoring the next generation of scientists.\n\nKen joined the ASA in January of 1965 while he was at Oregon State University. During his career at Hoffman LaRoche in New Jersey, he was very active in the ASA Metropolitan New York City chapter. He gave a plenary talk on âDevelopment of Therapeutic Proteins by Recombinant DNA Technologyâ at the ASA Gene Splicing Conference at Eastern College in 1987. He served on the ASA Executive Council and was the founding donor of the ASA Endowment Fund. He and Eunice attended many ASA annual meetings, and he has been a dedicated advocate for and contributor to ASA.\n\nHis commitment to God and his ministry was widespread and lifelong. Over the years, as a member of his home church, he served as a church deacon, served in youth ministries, taught menâs Bible study, and, most recently, was involved in Seniorsâ ministry at Quail Lakes Baptist Church. He supported many missionary families and organizations globally. He took his role seriously and lived a lifetime of stewardship. He was always willing to share a meal and open his home for missionaries as they traveled, with his wife, Eunice, graciously hosting. He coordinated singers and concert opportunities at his church home. His was a quiet and kind presence that spoke to others of Godâs grace and love for his neighbors.\n\nHe was consistent in providing for his family and was well known for being the father of five girls. He allowed his silly side to come out, with his mischievous grin, dry humor, and Dad jokes. Ken loved to travel, and instilled this in his family as they would navigate across the country, from coast to coast. He visited all 50 states and traveled overseas for conferences and for tours, such as The Holy Lands and the Wesley Heritage and Hymns Tour in England. Later in life, he and Eunice enjoyed taking cruises, especially when they were able to hear some of their favorite gospel groups sing and to join up with fellow church friends.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his wife of 58 years, Eunice (Boldt) Olson. Ken was clear in mind as he faced his final weeks and was at peace knowing that he had done what he wanted to accomplish in life. He was confident in his faith and continued to read his Bible daily and minister to others. âWell done, good and faithful Servant.â\n\ntop\n\nHendrik J. Oorthuys (1910-1996) Electrical Engineer\n\nDied on July 22, 1996 at age 86 of an acute heart attack. He had been a member of the ASA since the mid-1940s and served as Secretary for four years. He was also active in the Oregon Local Section. Hendrik received his degrees in electrical engineering at Oregon State U. where he and F. Alton Everest were fellow students.\n\nAlton taught at OSU but when he was called to work in the Navy Electronics Laboratory in San Diego at the outset of WWII, Hendrik took over his teaching. Alton subsequently recruited Hendrik to work with him at the Lab from 1944-46. Hendrik was an EE prof. at Purdue U. from 1946-57, then returned to OSU until his retirement in 1975.\n\nHe married Ruth Denney in 1950 and had three sons and a daughter. Hendrik and Ruth were involved in a ministry to inmates at the Oregon State Prison. Hendrik attended First Baptist Church of Corvallis, where former ASA president and biologist David L. Willis taught Bible class. One of David's students at First Baptist was also an EE student at OSU, the Editor, who would record his articulate and inspiring lectures. I took no courses from Hendrik, however, but recall him to often be in the motor lab, the EE dept's \"fishbowl.\" I readily concur with Dave when he wrote: \"Hendrik was a most enthusiastic person. ... He was always cheerful and hopeful. He is remembered locally as \"the Flying Dutchman,\" because to the end of his life he could be seen daily on the city streets furiously pedaling his bicycle here and there.\" David also added, \"He was a dear Christian friend and a strong supporter of ASA.

Orteza of Calgary, Alberta Canada, went home to be with the Lord on Saturday, July 26, 2014. She was survived by her brother, Ephraim and his wife, Edna, of Morgantown, WV and another sister-in-law, Lavinia R. A. Orteza of Quezon City, Philippines, nephews, nieces, great-nephews and great-nieces. She was born in Butuan, Philippines, the daughter of the late Jose and Rosario Orteza. She was preceded in death by her sisters, Corazon and Josefina; brothers Cornelio, Leoncio, Benjamin, Jose Jr., Ruben, and Arsenio.\n\nEvelina was a professor emerita of Philosophy of Education, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada. She received a Bachelor of Science in Education with a major in English Literature and a minor in Sociology from the University of the Philippines, a M.A. in Education from Case Western Reserve, Cleveland, Ohio, and an Ed.D. in Philosophy of Education from the University of California Los Angeles. With this educational background, she became equipped to teach at various institutions starting as an instructor at UCLA, then as an assistant professor at the University of Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, and finally moving to the University of Calgary where she was granted the associate and later full professor status. She served this institution for 26 years until her retirement. During some summer sessions, she had the opportunity to teach at the University of Lethbridge in Alberta, University of Regina, in Saskatchewan, and West Virginia University in Morgantown, WV. Apart from this wide teaching experience, she was also a visiting professor at the University of the Philippines, a visiting colleague at the University of Hawaii, and an Honorary Research Fellow at the University of Birmingham in England.\n\nShe joined the ASA as early as 1968 and was appointed a consulting editor for JASA in 1977. She attended several Annual meetings in the 70s and 80s.\n\nBecause of her honest desire in improving the teaching of Philosophy of Education and the development of a better understanding of what the Department of Foundations of Education under the Faculty of Education is through her dedicated teaching and extensive writing, she received various kinds of honors, certificates of recognition, and awards. She was not only an author and co-author of books, but also a contributor to a number of books. Her involvement in both national and international journals on philosophy of education, values, and religion ranged from being editor, co-editor, book review editor, advisor, and contributor resulted in her being known and admired by local, national and international colleagues. Her other areas of interest in addition to philosophy of education in general were analytic philosophy of education, in particular, philosophical basis of moral education, existential philosophy, Pragmatism, Ethics, and later on she included the areas of religion, Christian mind, religious pluralism, interreligious dialogue, morality and values. Her main concern in teaching was to teach her students to think clearly and understand what university education is about. In addition to her distinguished academic career, Evelina was devoted to her family and friends, known for her generosity and love of art, the performing arts, classical music and collections of old books.\n\nHer clear thinking also applied rigorously to her Christian beliefs as shown in leading Bible Studies both in a number of churches she attended and in individual homes where sharing or caring groups met weekly. The members of every group showed their appreciation and thanks for the marvelous lessons learned from her, in terms of a verse by verse study and clarification, in each book being studied, and an increasing love for reading the Word of God. And because she believed in God distributing gifts to His people, we can say that she used her gifts from God to the fullest extent that she could.\n\nThe family received friends at the Reformation Orthodox Presbyterian Church, 450 Arch Street, Morgantown, WV on Saturday, August 16th from 9:30 AM until the time of the funeral service at 11 AM with Rev.

Page (1903-1992) Physics\n\nOf Minneapolis, he died of heart failure on 15 May 1992 at the age of 88. A physicist and former research director of the U. S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), he had been decorated by four U.S. presidents. In 1946 President Harry Truman awarded him the Certificate of Merit and in 1960 President Dwight Eisenhower presented him with the Presidential Award for Distinguished Civilian Service. Born in St. Paul, the son of a Methodist minister, Bob Page entered Hamline University to study religion but in his senior year switched to physics.\n\nAfter graduating in 1927 he joined the staff of NRL, which had been established only four years earlier. With colleagues there he invented the technology to make pulsed radar effective; also the planned position indicator (die now common PPI scope, with radial beam sweeping the circular face of a cathode ray tube to locate radar echoes from planes, ships, or hurricanes) and Project Madre, the first radar capable of \"seeing\" over a horizon. His contributions, pooled with those of British scientists in 1940, were crucial to winning WWII. Later, Project Madre improved surveillance of long-range missile launches during the cold war with the Soviet Union. Bob Page earned an M.S. degree from George Washington U. while working at NRL, where he was research director from 1957 to his retirement in 1966. He also received an honorary doctorate from Hamline.\n\nHe was a long-time member and Fellow of ASA. During his tenure at NRL he was active in ASA's Washington-Baltimore local section, and in the sixties participated in a number of ASA Annual Meetings. Robert M. Page, Director of Research at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington (and the first man to send a message by reflecting it off the moon, he casually informed us during a talk), presented a fascinating picture of what science has learned about extra-terrestrial phenomena through different types of research. He taught Bible classes and frequently lectured on the relationship of science and Scripture. According to his son, Rev. John Robert Page of Medford, Oregon, he had recently been working on a full-length study on that subject. ASA old-timers will remember Bob's striking appearance: a tall, thin, white-haired man with a distinctive goatee. Others (especially anyone who worked on early radar gear) might know his 1962 Doubleday Anchor paperback, The Origi"
