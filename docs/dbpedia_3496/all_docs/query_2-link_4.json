Hackett. The film stars Bryant Washburn, Lois Wilson, Frank Currier, Walter Hiers, Clarence Geldart, and Julia Faye. The film was released on November 23, 1919, by Paramount Pictures.[1][2] It is not known whether the film currently survives,[3] and it may be a lost film.[4]\n\nThe film was remade in 1931.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nAs described in a film magazine,[5] Rodney Martin (Washburn) graduates from college with a splendid education and is surprised to find himself absolutely unprepared for a business career. However, business strangely attracts him, possible because of Mary Grayson (Wilson), his father's secretary, whom he thinks is the most proper thing in women. Since she is a businesswoman, he reasons that he must prove himself a business man. He decks out an office before he decides what line of business he will follow. A friend suggests the soap business. He straight away begins an advertising campaign that works wonders. However, the bills, when they arrive, overcome him and he faces disaster. His father comes to the rescue by appointing him as an advertising man in his organization, so all ends as it should.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nBryant Washburn as Rodney Martin\n\nLois Wilson as Mary Grayson\n\nFrank Currier as Cyrus Martin\n\nWalter Hiers as Ambrose Peale\n\nClarence Geldart as House Manager\n\nJulia Faye as Countess de Beaurien\n\nGuy Oliver as McChesney\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
