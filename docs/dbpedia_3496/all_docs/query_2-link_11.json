        "text": "Sixty Cents An Hour. Ever since the recoil of a certain obese comedian from the comedy centers of California a gentleman named Walter Hiers has been striving for the heavyweight custard pie championship. Sixty Cents An Hour is his latest. For that strange stratum of the commonwealth which derives amusement from watching a ton lump of humanity at his wooing the venture is doubtless entertaining.\n\nThe picture is slightly notable for its introduction of Ricardo Cortez to the breathless multitude. Cortez was acquired by Jesse Lasky to fit in the niche left vacant when Rodolph Valentino resigned. Critical opinion estimated Ricardo as slightly less beautiful than Rodolph.\n\nThe Isle Of Lost Ships. It has been the contention of many rational beings that the movies should stay out in the open spaces until The Book of Etiquette is fully memorized by a few of the directors. Members of this school of thought will be finally convinced of the verity of their theory by witnessing the storm in The Isle Of Lost Ships. Maurice Tourneur has done a deluge for the picture quite comparable to the famous precipitation in the Noah period.\n\nThe plot revolves about the activities of a group marooned in the seaweed waste of the Sargasso Sea. The story is luridly unimportant. The acting, by Anna Q. Nilsson and Milton Sills, is capable. The salt, seafaring atmosphere created by particularly excellent photography places the picture easily in the first ten of the year’s releases. The Girl I Loved. Charles Ray has returned. His current medium is a play adapted (freely, after the manner of moviewrights) from a poem of James Whitcomb Riley.\n\nAs usual, the accomplished Mr. Ray is disclosed as a rural Romeo. The present production offers scope for his entire act and the Ray constituency will be quite contented with their rustic idol. Particularly effective is he in expressing embarrassment by pulling his toes.\n\nJoseph De Grasse has done more than his share for the welfare of the play by his uncommonly even direction. Mr. De Grasse, also, is courageous. He has permitted a tragic ending. Charles Ray’s rival for the lady’s favor receives her promise true. His name is Willie Brown."
