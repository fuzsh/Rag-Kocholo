        "text": "Robert Rodriguez claims that his Sin City “translates” Frank Miller’s graphic narratives, its source texts, “directly to the screen.” Surprisingly, however, Ro- driguez’s film includes almost constant references to film noir, to film production, and to cinematic conventions – conventions Rodriguez either adheres to or throws into relief. But this overt remediation of Miller’s narrative actually mirrors Miller’s own remediation of early noir fiction. Noir, in Rodriguez’s hands, becomes more than a style or a story that might appear in various forms. It is a discourse that consists of a particular relationship between a text’s style and its structure. This discourse thus depends upon style, but “style” understood to be the particular way in which the signs will obtain in the context of a medium and its conventions. And if we can define style in this way, we can better understand the relationship between discourse and the material medium in which it presents. This article demonstrates the importance, when considering style and discourse, of investigating medium-specific methods of signification, as what a sign “means” depends on what the medium is capable of. Particularly at this moment, as investigations of narrative tend toward the cognitive processes and contextual elements involved in its reception, we would do well to bear in mind the relationships – among medium, style, and whatever histories and conventions come with them – that make up discourse, as these relationships constitute the real process of signification.\n\nThis article aims to explore the intermedia relations between the comic book, “Sin City”, the sub-story of Marv, written and illustrated by Frank Miller and transformed into a film version by Robert Rodriguez. The analysis identifies elements of the visual identity of the original work in the adaptation, as well as adjustments for the transposition of one language to another. In addition to the undeniable differences between supports such as the use of dialogue balloons, the use of frames, gutters, frames in the cinema or the use of effects and soundtracks, it is necessary to consider the different stages of production or elaboration of each medium separately, thus, as the nuances of perception, as the time of viewing the images, the paths to be followed while reading and the actions of subjective contemplation on the part of the spectator/reader. However, it is important to consider the space/time issues about the sequential chains of images and especially about the aesthetic choices of each author/director on the narrative composition of each support. Therefore, the analysis was based on a theoretical basis by Ismael Xavier, Robert Stam and Doc Comparato, on the main aspects of this adaptation model, in order to understand the aesthetic options of the illustrations as a storyborad tool for the production of the film adaptation.\n\nDoctor of PhilosophyEnvironmental Design and Planning ProgramHuston John GibsonIn many academic fields today, cinematic representations are rich sources through which researchers recognize and interpret phenomena. Using cinema as the global form of visual texts is both useful and, to some extent, even necessary in the study of urban phenomena. Geography was the first discipline that continuously attempted to conceptualize the notion of the cinematic city. From then until now, Art, film, media studies, and architecture have considered the relationship between city and cinema. In recent years, although scholars with a background in urban disciplines have addressed this interdisciplinary topic, little in the way of effective, continuous utilization of movies in urban studies has occurred. The failure is not necessarily appreciation, but capability; arguably, the lack of an urban-oriented methodology is an important reason why urban studies has not paid deep attention to the cinema to d...\n\nThis article examines filmmaker Phil Solomon's shift to digital technologies, arguing that his four-part series In Memoriam (Mark LaPore) draws upon a set of representational strategies associated with the poetic avant-garde, a tradition still deeply rooted in 16mm filmmaking. It is the interplay between this tradition's frequent emphasis on compositional rigor -- the play of light and texture, polyvalent montage, and elliptical narrative -- and the singular digital aesthetic of Grand Theft Auto, Solomon's source material, that constitutes In Memoriam's major contribution. Solomon introduces a set of represetational techniques with expressly filmic connotations into the digital realm, which forces him to engage directly with the contingencies and possibilities of both media. Therefore, Solomon provides an instructive case study of how avant-garde filmmakers extend and reinvent their practice as they move from film to digital.\n\nThe subject of the city has long been central in studies and writings from different fields; architecture, urban and film studies, literature and photography. This is an exploratory paper, one that cuts across several disciplines with the intent of providing a wider knowledge on the cinematic of the city and its reproduction in filmic narratives. This paper explores not the complex relationship between film and place, but rather the ways in which the city has been represented through the ‘moving image’ both dramatised and envisioned, allowing us, as audience, to step into environments we have been before and/or will never directly experience. City space is both a filmic construction and an architectural construction. Filmic narratives of the city can also become an architectural practice: an art form of the city’s space. They are agents for building our views of the city, influencing the ways we live and perceive the city, and filmic representations will growingly be channelled into the city’s image. More than being a testament of the city’s history, could film be an instrument for testing and applying new perspectives to the city’s physical production? This paper suggests that filmic narratives are a major source for understanding the city and comprehending its processes of production. They can also be potential tools for recreating environments and ‘virtually’ explore the effects of the built environment on society and the urban whole. Both dramatised and envisioned cities are imagery constructs that allow reflecting about the conditions of urban life.\n\nTraditional forms to research history of architecture have been focused on influential architects, built projects and architectonic movements. On the other hand, scholars who explore films to approach architecture have analyzed set designs, architects who collaborate with the film industry, or specific films, cities or specific architectonic projects that appear in films. This dissertation is focused on discourses of the city and explores (1) dominant discourses that helped to the popularity of certain urban and architectonic solutions, (2) conditions that helped that city's authorities promoted certain urban solutions over others, and (3) how cinema and film genres contributed to these solutions were so popular. This interdisciplinary project understands discourses as systems of thought and practices that construct conceptual categories. Discourses work as cultural frameworks within larger systems of power, whereby truth and knowledge are produced. On the other hand, films strongly influence the construction of spatial meanings, and their analysis opens up new approaches to understanding architectonic spaces not only in terms of physical and perceptual features, but also in terms of social constructions. The objective of this project is to understand how America and Britain have represented and commented upon the city space between the 1930s and 1960s. To achieve this goal, the study analyzes 87 films than belong to diverse genres, in order to illuminate on the one hand, the main urban and architectonic models represented on screen and the discourses associated with these models; and on the other hand, to analyze the relationship between urban discourses and film genres.The theoretical framework is based upon the discourse analysis proposed by Michel Foucault and genre theory. The final products will be: a framework for future inquiries that combines architectonic and film approaches to understanding how both disciplines interact in the distribution of city’s discourses, and the analysis of a body of films according to their spatial models, in order to demonstrate that film genres distribute dominant discourses and function as frames that shape taken-for-granted assumptions of city’s spaces."
