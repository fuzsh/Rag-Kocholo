        "text": "Bertie “Frank” Wesner was born January 24, 1955 in Ashland Kansas, and departed this life July 24, 2024, age 69, in Overland Park Regional Medical Center after a short illness.\n\nFrank was the only child of Arlo Wesner and Eva “Faye” Loomis Wesner, who both preceded him in death.\n\nFrank graduated from Ashland High School with the class of 1973 and from Garden City Community College in 1975.

She helped Jesse when needed on the farm and during much of this time she worked as a secretary for the Englewood School System. Upon retirement in 1982, they moved to Buffalo and Marjorie gave her service of love to our Lord though the donation of her time as church secretary for the Buffalo United Methodist Church. During the next 24 years with their RV, Marge & Jesse traveled extensively throughout the United States, including Alaska & Canada. They particularly enjoyed visiting the South Fork area in Colorado each summer where they acquired many lifelong friends.\n\nMarjorie had several hobbies: quilting, counted cross stitch, reading and crocheting. She crocheted the Lord’s Prayer for her United Methodist Church which is still hanging in the church. She loved bowling. She and Jesse had a passion for dancing and while living in Englewood they went to several local barn, garage, and basement dances; it has been said that Marjorie and Jesse danced 100,000 miles together. She tried to teach her brother-in-law (Edgar Newby) to dance. Marjorie would laugh when telling that story as Edgar would get so nervous he would ….well you had to be there!\n\nMarjorie was inducted into the Centenarians of Oklahoma when she turned 100 in 2022. That same year she moved into the Parkview Pointe Senior Living in Laverne, OK where she made several friends and where she received excellent care.\n\nMarjorie was preceded in death by her parents, Paul and Iva Bowers, two brothers, Charles and Jack Bowers, three sisters, and brothers-in-law; Merle (Pud) Wolf, Anna Belle (John) Cartmill and Ruby (Edgar) Newby, one son, PD and his wife Suzette Roesch, and son-in-law, Darrel Girk.\n\nShe is survived by son, Richard (Wanda) Davis of MS, daughter, Terena Girk of Protection, KS, 4 grandkids, 9 great grandkids, and 5 great-great grandkids, including several nieces, nephews, and a host of friends.\n\nThe memorial service were held Friday July 26, 2024, at the Buffalo First United Methodist Church located on 223 SE 2nd St, Buffalo, OK.

He was born July 20, 1936 in Evansville, Indiana, the fifth of 11 children born to Louis R. and Dorothy (Roth) Kissel. He lived in rural Evansville where he attended one-room schoolhouses in his early years. He graduated from Reitz High School in Evansville in June of 1954.\n\nFollowing high school, Paul worked for B&M Construction, laying concrete and doing carpentry work. In the fall of 1956, he came to Protection to work for his cousin, Joe Schumacher, on his farm and cattle operation. On April 1, 1959, he was drafted into the U.S. Army. He was stationed at Fort Lewis, Washington and served as an administrator for the incoming GI’s. After serving two years in the military, Paul returned to Protection to continue helping Joe Schumacher and began farming and ranching in March of 1961.\n\nIn the early years, Paul was a proud member of the FFA Chapter, 4-H Club, and Rural Youth of Vandenburg County in Evansville where he served several years, holding many leadership roles. Paul learned many things growing up on the farm and used that knowledge to expand his agricultural business opportunities.\n\nPaul met his future wife, Linda (Spangler) Kissel, at a dance in Buffalo, Oklahoma and they married on April 27, 1963. They celebrated 60 years of marriage together in April 2023. Paul and Linda were blessed with four children: Kirk, Tina, Amy, and Dayla.\n\nPaul had a heart for service and later served many roles in the community. Throughout his life, he was a dedicated member of the following local board of directors: Farm Bureau, Comanche County Conservation, Box Ranch Association, Protection Cooperative, CMS Electric, Protection School Board, and Protection Christian Church Board. Paul and Linda joined the Protection Christian Church of Protection in 1968.\n\nIn his spare time, Paul enjoyed gardening, golfing, playing cards, marbles, and dancing with Linda. He always cared for his horses and livestock. Later in life he had a special bond with his dog (Sarge) and his cat (Tiger).\n\nPaul is remembered as a man with a sweet soul who loved the Lord and his family. He always took time for others by listening and getting to know them. His witty sense of humor made people laugh and made him a likable person.\n\nHe is survived by his four children: Kirk (Gayla) Kissel, Tina (Joe) Dickey, Amy (Brad) Miller, and Dayla (Dave) Baalman; eleven grandchildren: Megan McCuiston (Stephen), Kaycee Nelson (Max), Jessica Harris (Taylon), Jalen Dickey (Lindsey), Logan Dickey, Gracyn Rack (Jared), Jenna Miller, Lauryn Miller, Tori Miller, Kaden Baalman, and Rylan Baalman; seven great-grandchildren; brothers: Marlin (Agnes) Kissel, Reuben (Joyce) Kissel, John (Carolyn) Kissel, David (Barbara) Kissel, and Richard (Maritta) Kissel; sisters: Wilma Heilman, June Neyhouse, Ruth France, and Mary Farney; and numerous nieces, nephews, and other relatives.\n\nPaul was preceded in death by his parents; his wife: Linda; a brother: Warren Kissel; and a granddaughter: Makena Baalman.\n\nFuneral service was at 10:00 a.m., Tuesday, June 25, 2024 at Protection Christian Church in Protection, Kansas, with Pastor Rusty Westerfield presiding. Burial followed the funeral service at Protection Cemetery in Protection, Kansas, with full military honors.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorials are suggested to Protection Valley Manor or Protection Christian Church in care of Hatfield-Prusa Funeral Home, P.O. Box 417, Coldwater, KS 67029.\n\nJoyce was born to Lane Michael Myers and Lila Opal (Pettigrew) Myers in Wichita, KS on October 2,\n\n1930. She was their firstborn and times were tight. Her first bed was actually a dresser drawer, and she\n\nwould joke that it was ‘usually left open’. She was joined by her only sister, Patricia two years later.\n\nJoyce loved to tell the story about rolling with her sister, Pat, down a hill in order to extinguish a flaming\n\npaper Halloween costume and how the newspaper came out and wrote an article about the incident, calling\n\nher a hero. She often expressed that her role as big sister always kept her busy, and on her toes.\n\nAt some point during her school years the family moved from Wichita to Protection, KS, where her\n\npaternal grandfather owned the town’s grocery store. Her high school years in Protection were busy and\n\nfilled with friends and school and church activities. After graduating from high school she attended a Bible\n\nCollege in Minneapolis, MN.\n\nIn 1952, Joyce’s father, Lane, announced that the family needed a vacation, so they all packed up and\n\nwent to Long Beach, CA, for an extended stay. While they were staying in Long Beach they attended Long\n\nBeach First Christian Church where Joyce met a dynamic young youth pastor named Wesley Veatch. He\n\nwas also the principal of Alvarado Christian School and shortly after they started dating, he hired Joyce to\n\nteach 2nd grade, which started a lifetime of the two of them working together, in one capacity, or another.\n\nThey married on June 26, 1953 and moved to San Jose, CA, where their daughter, Cathy, was born in\n\n1956. While in San Jose, Joyce continued teaching. In 1961 they moved to Louisville, KY, where Wes\n\ncontinued his education, and they were both hired by the state to run a halfway home for women who\n\nwere transitioning from care facilities, back into mainstream society. Their little family of three shared a\n\nlarge colonial style home with up to 8 women at a time, who were in varying degrees of mental wellness.\n\nOnce again, she found herself being interviewed by the newspaper to share this unique living situation.\n\nThe early 1960’s found Joyce, Wes and Cathy back in her hometown of Protection, KS. Her father, Lane\n\nMyers, had obtained the contract to manufacture the concertina barbed wire that the government was using\n\nin the war in Vietnam, and he wanted to include his family in his success. Wes used that time to help in the\n\nbusiness office, and pastor a small, rural Mennonite church, which began Joyce’s lifelong second career as\n\na pastor’s wife. While in Kansas, Joyce and Wes adopted their second child, a son, named Michael.\n\nFrom Kansas they moved to Indianapolis, IN, back to Louisville, KY, to Bellevue, WA, and eventually to\n\nAnchorage, AK. All of these locations involved pastoring churches, continuing their own educations and\n\nfor Joyce, teaching and counseling in junior high and high schools until they retired on Whidbey Island,\n\nWA. In 2012 Joyce and Wes moved to Southern California, where she lived with her daughter, Cathy, after\n\nWes passed in September of that year.\n\nShe loved teaching and her responsibilities as a pastor’s wife equally, and never shied away from an\n\nopportunity to speak to various groups whenever asked.\n\nJoyce loved the Lord, loved her family, loved people and made friends, literally everywhere she went.\n\nShe enjoyed entertaining and hosting people in their home, but also looked forward to traveling and\n\nexploring new places. She always had a story to tell and would tell anyone that her priorities were the ‘3\n\nFs’ … Faith, Family and Friends. She continued to drive and stayed active until she turned 90. At that point,\n\nshe, along with the entire world, decided to stay home in order to avoid Covid, but she did stay busy and\n\nin contact with many friends for quite a while.\n\nIn the last few months, she was noticeably ‘slowing down’, but always stayed interested in other people\n\nand whatever was going on around her.\n\nJoyce walked into the arms of her Savior and so many loved ones in the early morning on January 16,\n\n2024. She is survived by her 2 children, Cathy (Veatch) Anderson, and Michael Allen Veatch; 3\n\ngrandchildren, Tyler Aaron Anderson, Stephanie Elaine Anderson and Sean Christopher Anderson; 3\n\ngreat-granddaughters, Julia Anderson, Kate Anderson and Nova Bryant; and also, her nephew, Chad Lane\n\nSanders.\n\nShe is loved and missed, but we have the assurance of knowing that she is eternally loving our Lord and\n\nenjoying everyone around her.\n\nServices will be held on Saturday, June 22, 2024 at 11:30 a.m. at the Christian Church in Protection, KS,\n\nwith a procession to the Protection Cemetery immediately following.\n\nWe rise today, not to mourn the celestial discharge of a cosmic family counselor, but to celebrate the life\n\nof Sassy Sally, a woman who, like a stubborn Kansas wildflower, pushed through the toughest prairie and\n\nbloomed with a vivacity that defies description, and who passed away peacefully on May 19, 2024, at the\n\nage of 84, at the Ashland Health Center in Ashland, KS.\n\nSally Ann Davis Slaton was gifted to the world on July 17, 1939 in Arkansas City, KS to Russell and Louise\n\n(Leach) Davis. Her motherhood debut began in the primordial ooze of 1959 in the prairie expanse between\n\nRussell, KS and Denver, CO, the portmanteau hamlet of Kanorado. There she embarked on her own\n\nOdessey, albeit with fewer cyclopes and considerably more toddlers. By the late 1960s, her brood had\n\ngrown from two to four, a personal apocalypse that most of us wouldn’t survive without resorting to ritual\n\nsacrifice. But Sally, bless her intrepid soul, simply raised an eyebrow and signed up for four years of higher\n\nlearning, presumably because the dumpster fire needed more gasoline. While at Garden City Community\n\nCollege, she engaged with the Mennonite Brethren community, who proved an invaluable support system\n\nand even gave her an “in” for her last two years of study at Tabor College, where she graduated in 1974,\n\nand was eager to hit the ground running as the state of Kansas’ newest warrior of social work.\n\nWhile some may cower before the wrathful gods of student finance and screaming offspring, SalGal, a\n\nmodern-day Jeanne d’ Arc, took on the dual challenges of education and single parenthood with equal zest.\n\nUltimately, on March 5, 1977, she took a partner; a man with a bachelor’s modus operandi and with the\n\nrockin’ 70’s sideburns and poly leisure suits to prove it, expanding the brood to six holy terrors and\n\nresulting in a chaotic 80’s version of The Brady Bunch. From there, she balanced the tightrope of a blended\n\nfamily in small-town America with the grace of a ballerina on a unicycle in a crossfire hurricane.\n\nIn spite of everything, her wonderful and sharp sense of humor remained a constant. Family gatherings\n\nbecame evangelical tent revivals for the stories her spawn would delight in regaling; each one erupting\n\nwith the explosive energy of an angry thunderstorm. How she navigated the tempests of life, both literal\n\nand figurative, remains a mystery, but, like an iron-willed pioneer woman unintimidated by those potential\n\nhigh-energy twisters, SalGal would grab a metaphorical lawn chair and a beer and head straight for the\n\nfunnel cloud. Fear? In her vocabulary, that word was filed somewhere between “can’t” and “won’t.” Because\n\nof her courage, her unwavering equanimity, and her incisive wit, each of us in our own unique ways are\n\nthriving in this crazy, mixed-up world.\n\nSally was preceded in death by her husband of 47 years, Curtis, her parents, Russel and Louise Davis,\n\nand her older brother, Larry. Survivors to continue telling the tales of legend and the lies of legacy are her\n\nyounger brother Fred (Phyllis) Davis, Jacksonville, AR, her children Ron Rohlf, Hays, KS, Dawn (Ronnie)\n\nCarter, Clyo, GA, Mark (Mary) Rohlf, Hays, KS, Craig (Ana) Foster, Atchison, KS, Marcia (Kevin) Prince,\n\nCushing, OK, and Sharon (Tommy) Bryan, Coquille, OR. Sally was also blessed with 13 grandchildren and\n\neight great-grandchildren.\n\nSo, SalGal, wherever you are, whether basking on a sunny Rocky Mountain cabin porch with a glass of\n\nwine or swapping tall tales with the Leprechauns, know this: Every time we think of you, a smile as wide\n\nas the Kansas sky will bloom across our faces. You may be gone, but your indomitable spirit, like a stubborn\n\nwildflower, will forever push through the toughest terrain, reminding us to face life’s storms with a laugh\n\nand that metaphorical lawn chair.\n\nGraveside Inurnment Memorial Service was held Saturday, May 25, 2024 at the Highland Cemetery,\n\nAshland, Kansas.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorials are suggested to Ashland Health Center, PO Box 188, Ashland, KS 67831.\n\nCarol Belle (Edgar) Hindman age 95 was born September 12, 1928 and went to her eternal home May 6, 2024. She was a faithful wife to Reed for almost 73 years until his passing in July of 2023. She is survived by her 5 children, their spouses and 16 grandchildren. Alvin and his wife Diane (Tim, Erin) Anita and her husband Wayne Curry (Andy, Jason, Jessica Johnston, Jennifer Copeland) Mark and his wife Laurie (Andrea Johnson, Alicia Hooker, Ryan) Janice and her husband Bob Martin (Tyler, Aubrey Singleton, Ashton Telando, Paige Schmidt) Joe and his wife Erin (Jacob, Joshua, Christian). She was a great-grandma to 21 with 2 more due this year. She loved her family and was a Godly example to each of them.\n\nCarol was born in Sterling, Kansas, the ninth child of Metheny and Isabelle Edgar. She was preceded in death by her parents and siblings Margaret, Ralph, Donald, Jean, Alice, Howard, Alvin and Mary. She graduated from Sterling College in 1950 majoring in Home Economics. She married Reed Hindman on August 29, 1950. Reed was drafted into the Army and deployed to Germany and Carol stayed in Sterling working for Dr. Betty Kilpatrick. When Reed returned from his service in 1952, they settled in Minneola, Kansas. Carol worked in the Minneola CO-OP office for a few years before becoming a full time homemaker and mother. Carol was a member of the Reformed Presbyterian Church and involved with Womens’ Missionary Society, a deaconess and a Sunday school teacher where she touched many lives. She was a faithful prayer warrior for her family and friends. Her involvement in the community over many years included Farmerettes, Garden Club, 4-H leader, and dependable spectator at many school events.\n\nCarol was a sweet, kind-hearted woman who her children do not remember ever raising her voice. Even when we deserved it. She had a dry sense of humor and was quick to laugh. She had a knack for comforting and was always ready with a hug. While she preferred to be in the garden, she was a very good cook and her family never went hungry.\n\nCarol’s family would like to thank the staff and caregivers at Minneola Long Term Care for their loving and tender care of Carol over the past 4 years. You are greatly appreciated!\n\nA time of visitation will be held Friday, May 31 from 6-8 pm at the Minneola Civic Connection. A funeral service will be held Saturday, June 1, at 10:00 am at Minneola Community Church followed by the interment in Appleton Township Cemetery.\n\nMemorial contributions may be given to Minneola Long Term Care, Minneola, Kansas or Sterling Reformed Presbyterian Church, Sterling Kansas both in care of Minnis Mortuary, 1901 N. 14th Ave., Dodge City, Kansas 67801. Condolences may be sent to www.minnismortuary.net\n\nFaye Miller was born January 18, 1935 in Castro County, Texas five miles southeast and one mile south of Dimmitt to Arthur Daniel and Mary Viola Adams Bryan. At that time, the family was living in a boxcar which had been converted into a house. She had three brothers and one sister who have all preceded her in death. As a child, the family moved around; but she talked the most about growing up on the Horton Ranch in the Texas panhandle near Dalhart, Texas. Faye and her siblings attended several schools in the area. One of these schools was in Dalhart. She first met Dail Deen Miller when he was running around with one of her brothers. She said she thought he had beautiful eyes. They had three dates. Their third date was when they eloped to Clayton, New Mexico to get married. She was in the 9th grade and just 16 but told the Justice of the Peace she was 18. Dail was 8 years older than she was and often told people he married her young so he could raise her the way he wanted. He didn’t realize how stubborn she was. You never told Faye she couldn’t do something. She would do it anyway just to spite you. To this union, three children were born – Glenda Faye, Brenda Kay, and Bobby Dail. She loved to tell people she raised nine kids. Thomas and Barbara Davis were friends and had six children. They were often gone on family emergencies and when they were their six kids stayed with Faye and Dail. One of those children became her son-in-law. She still claims them all as her kids.\n\nFaye and her sister learned to cook at an early age. She often talked about standing on a chair at the stove when she was six with an apron tied around her neck while she and her sister cooked for the rest of the family who were out working in the fields. That love of cooking followed both of them the rest of their lives. Faye had a large collection of cookbooks which she read from cover to cover. Her collection of cookbooks has been donated to the Ashland Public Library where others will get to enjoy them as much as she did.\n\nFaye also loved to sew. She sewed her first dress when she was 8 and wanted a new dress for the Christmas program at school. Her mother told her the only way she was getting a new dress was if she made it herself and handed her a piece of red corduroy. So she made it herself. Faye hand sewed her daughters’ dresses when they were little and made all her daughters’ school clothes after she got a sewing machine. Faye also made her daughters’ wedding dresses. After her daughters were grown and she had sewed all the clothes she could ever want, she started making Dail shirts. They were usually colorful with things like airplanes or hot air balloons depicted on them. Dail wore his unique shirts with pride.\n\nFaye is preceded in death by her loving husband of 55 years 6 months and 17 days, her parents, her brothers and sister, and her son. She is survived by her daughters Glenda and Wayne Harvey, Kay and Kenneth Davis, nine grandchildren, six great-grandchildren, six nephews, five nieces, four cousins, and three of her friends’ six children. She will be greatly missed.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family requests donations to your favorite charity; Hospice of the Prairie, PO Box 1298, Dodge City, KS 67801; or Ashland Health Center, PO Box 188, Ashland, KS 67831.\n\nGraveside Service was held Tuesday, April 30, 2024 at the Memorial Park Cemetery in Dalhart, Texas at 2:00 PM.\n\nArrangements by Ashland Funeral Home, 420 N.

Linda was born on September 19, 1948, in Norton, Kansas to father Kenneth Herbert Burdge and mother Irma Lee Gebhard.\n\nLinda grew up on a small hog farm in Wathena, Kansas until later in her teen years, the family moved to Long Island, Kansas where Linda graduated from high school in 1966. During that time Linda was active in multiple clubs and activities and was elected Homecoming Queen in 1965.\n\nLinda later attended Fort Hays State University to obtain a Teaching degree emphasizing in English, Speech and Art. Linda continued her involvement in multiple clubs associated with the liberal arts. She was a member of the Delta Zeta sorority, the Tiger Debs precision marching unit and was active in student government. Linda was chosen in an all-campus election and crowned the Fort Hays State Homecoming Queen in 1968.\n\nLinda met her husband William Roy “Bill” Wilson while attending college and they were married on June 21, 1969 in Long Island, Kansas. Linda and Bill were blessed with the birth of their first child, Matthew Kenneth in July 1970 and later with the birth of their second child, Kelly Dawn in January 1975.\n\nFollowing her college graduation, Linda briefly taught in Moreland, Kansas. The Wilson family then moved to Ashland, Kansas where Linda worked initially at the Stockgrowers State Bank and briefly for the Ashland school system as a secretary. Linda later acquired a full-time position as the Ashland School District Art Instructor for all grades elementary through Senior year, along with an additional position as the high school Vocational English instructor. Linda was also the high school cheerleading sponsor/instructor, and the production, costume and stage manager for many high school musicals, dinner theaters and plays throughout her tenure. Linda worked for 26 years in the Ashland School District from 1984 to her retirement in 2010.\n\nLinda accepted Jesus Christ as her Savior at an early age. She attended the Ashland Presbyterian Church with her family in Ashland, Kansas. She assisted with Sunday school and helped with the Christmas program for a few years.\n\nLinda became a grandmother for the first time with the birth of her granddaughter Summer Dawn Wilson in June 1994. Later multiple grandchildren followed: Savana Grace Wilson in February 2001, Hailey Irene Robinson in September 2002, William Stone Wilson in April 2004, and twins Carter Eugene Robinson and Hannah Sue Robinson in January 2005. Later, three step-grandchildren were added to her family: Charlie Marie Gibson, Chylynn Jean Gibson and Celia Joanne Gibson in November 2010.\n\nLinda was an artist and took great joy in art, music, fashion, interior décor and landscaping. Linda enjoyed her time coaching the cheerleaders, choreographing their dance routines and helping to organize pep rallies. She coached acting scenes and helped drama students to memorize their stage lines. She assisted with many school dances including numerous proms during her tenure. Linda helped to organize fund raisers and worked the concession stand at numerous ball games. Linda was sincerely invested in the success of her students and even covered the expense of art supplies, learning materials and stage props/play costumes out of her own pocket, if necessary.\n\nLinda enjoyed movies and shared that enjoyment with her children. She would take them to many a drive-in or a double feature in Dodge City, Kansas. She would read important literary books with them and shared mutual excitement with Matt and Kelly while treasure hunting for Star Wars and Strawberry Shortcake memorabilia at the Woolworths, Gibsons and ALCO stores in Dodge City. Occasionally Linda would surprise the family with a new pet. It might be a puppy, parakeet or a baby duckling but it was always unexpected and exciting. She actively supported Matt and Kelly at every event they were involved in during their formative years, and when they became adults, she provided wisdom, counseling, humor, and home decorating advice.\n\nIn 2003 Linda and Bill moved to the family ranch to take over full time. While Bill was occupied managing the ranch, Linda applied her special decorative touch to the farmhouse and grounds. She went as far as to convert the homestead into a veritable petting zoo. She acquired goats, chickens, ducks, geese, a miniature donkey and even a llama among other critters for the grandchildren to enjoy. Linda had stated that these were some of the happiest years of her life, as she and Bill basked in the glory of spending time with their grandchildren.\n\nUnfortunately, in 2006, Bill was diagnosed with cancer. Linda soon retired to spend more time with her husband and family. Linda helped care for Bill during his cancer treatment and later relapse until his death in October 2010. Thereafter, Linda moved to Omaha, Nebraska to live with her daughter’s family for the next thirteen years while providing love and attention to her family in Omaha until her death.\n\nLinda Sue Wilson was a beautiful person inside and out. She had a tremendous sense of humor and a larger-than-life laugh. She continued to be curious about history and the world around her until her death. She was genuinely interested in peoples’ lives and would listen compassionately to stories about their hopes, happiness and heartbreaks. She was kind and complimentary. She was a rule maker (and a rule breaker when it suited her). She was fun, silly and impulsive, but also a trusted problem solver.

Carol was born May 18, 1943 at home in rural Beaver County, Oklahoma to Kirby V. Berends and Katherine S. Miller Berends. At the age of 10, she became a big sister with the arrival of her cherished sister, Sandy. Carol was raised in the Englewood area, living west of town on “The Hill” and later at the Cottie Davis place. Her playmates were her only cousins, the Whisenhunt kids; being particularly close to Olen, Bernice and Nancy. She loved spending time at their home as the Whisenhunt kids often sang together. Carol and Olen Whisenhunt spent many happy hours at their grandparents’ home, eating their Grandma’s home cooked meals. Homemade noodles were one of Carol’s favorite snacks, until she mistook shaved lye soap for noodles. Lye noodles were not as tasty as egg noodles. She attended school in Englewood where she made a life-long friendship with Faye Anne Smith Ediger. Graduating in 1961, Carol attended college at Garden City Community College where she earned her Associates Degree.\n\nOn November 2, 1962, Carol was married to H. Eugene Woodruff in Englewood. The couple finished college and made their first home in Dodge City. Their family was complete with the addition of their two children, Shelly Jo and Steven Eugene. The family moved to Ashland, Ks in 1965, eventually settling down in Englewood where they lived until 2021 when they moved to Minneola, Ks.\n\nCarol held several jobs through her adulthood, from working at her Aunt Lela’s café to working at both the Gambles store and the Jack and Jill in Ashland. Once she moved to Englewood, she drove the school bus, worked at the Post Office and found her 30-year career working at the Grain Elevators in Englewood, eventually becoming the manager. She was one of the first female elevator managers in the industry. Carol also served as City Treasurer for the City of Englewood for over 40 years, retiring in 2021. Not many were aware of the number of city bills Carol personally paid for those in need or those going through hard times, quietly helping those she could. From her father, she inherited a love of animals, particularly cats. She fed practically every cat in Englewood and always had a house cat. From her mother, she inherited a love of reading which she shared not only with Eugene, but also with her children and grandchildren. Money might have been tight most of her life, but there was always money for books. From her Grandma and her Aunt Lela, she learned how to be a good cook becoming the family pie baker, making her Coconut Cream, Cherry, Pecan and Butterscotch pies for every family gathering.\n\nCarol is survived by her husband of 61 years, Eugene Woodruff, her children, Shelly Huelsman (Kevin) of Bucklin; Steven Woodruff of Ellinwood, Kansas, her grandchildren, Andrew Huelsman (Tiara), Katherine Hadley (Kyle), Cody Woodruff, and Austin Woodruff (Madisen); great-grandchildren, Addysen German, Presley Reid, Braxtyn Huelsman and Koy Hadley; her sister, Sandra Purinton (Wayne), her sister-in-law, Ruby Woodruff and Joan Woodruff, special cousins Olen Whisenhunt, Bernice Bogle & Nancy Walter and many nieces and nephews, cousins, other relatives and friends.\n\nGraveside services were held at 11:00AM Monday, March 25, 2024 at the Englewood Cemetery in Englewood Kansas.\n\nMemorials may be sent to the Englewood Fire Department or to the City of Englewood. In lieu of flowers, The family has suggested memorials to the Englewood Fire Department or to the city of Englewood.\n\nRuth Ann Godfrey, 79, a beloved wife, mother, sister, and friend, passed away on January 26, 2024, at Vintage Park at Waterfront, surrounded by her loving family. She was born on September 27, 1944, in Ashland, Kansas, to Lloyd and Eva (Baker) Sneed. Growing up in Clark County, she attended school and graduated from Ashland High School in 1962. Following her graduation, Ruth Ann pursued her passion for beauty, attending beauty school and working in a beauty shop for approximately four years.\n\nIt was during this time that she crossed paths with Kenny Godfrey, and on December 7, 1966, in Fort Campbell, Kentucky, they exchanged vows, marking the beginning of a beautiful journey together. Settling in Burling, Arkansas, in 1967, they welcomed their son Clayton in 1969 before returning to Meade, Kansas, where Ruth Ann worked in various roles, including at a convenience store and a bank as a teller.\n\nThe couple’s journey took them to Hutchinson, Kansas, where Ruth Ann continued her career in banking and became an active member of the Firefighters Women’s Auxiliary. Returning to Meade in 1977, they eventually became proud owners of a bar before relocating to Holcomb, Kansas, where Ruth Ann resumed her work in banking. Later, they ventured to Arizona, where Ruth Ann immersed herself in community service, particularly through her involvement in the American Legion, where she served as the President of the Auxiliary.\n\nTheir travels eventually led them to Roosevelt, Arizona, where Ruth Ann continued to contribute to her community. In 2001, she and Kenny returned to Kansas, where they dedicated their time to working with the Girl Scout Camp in Leon, Kansas, with Ruth Ann serving as the Camp Coordinator for Camp 4 Winds until 2007.\n\nRuth Ann was known for her love of crafting, word puzzles, and card games. She and Kenny cherished their time spent together, entertaining friends in their cherished “Party Garage” and enjoying dances. An avid outdoorswoman, Ruth Ann found solace in fishing and camping, embracing the beauty of nature.\n\nShe was a devoted caregiver to Kenny’s mother for several years and was cherished by her family for her quiet strength and her preference for a simple life. Ruth Ann is survived by her children, Michelle Sell (Larry) and Clayton Godfrey (Kelly); her sibling, Phillip Sneed (Dianna); her grandchildren, Jeffrey Edwards, Angelica Sell, Jaedan Godfrey, and Kaelyn Godfrey; her nieces and nephews, Russ Roberts (Brenda), Deana Riney (Rich), Kevin Miller, Laurie Miller, PJ Sneed (Dana), and Demetria Meyer (Mel); her brother-in-law, Bob Roberts, and many other beloved family members and friends.\n\nShe is preceded in death by her parents, Lloyd and Eva Sneed, and her sisters, Phyllis D. {Sneed} Roberts and Martha {Sneed}Miller and brother in law Kenneth Miller.\n\nThe family will hold a private service at a time to be determined and memorial donations in Ruth’s memory may be made to Andover Police & Fire Foundation, 909 N Andover Road, Andover, KS 67002 and Girl Scouts of Kansas Heartland, 360 S Lexington Road, Wichita, KS 67218.\n\nRuth Ann Godfrey will be remembered for her kind heart, her unwavering love for her family, and her dedication to serving others. She leaves behind a legacy of compassion, strength, and joy that will continue to inspire all who knew her. May she rest in eternal peace.\n\nConnie Carol McMinimy O’Bleness passed away on Wednesday, Nov. 22 at the age of 90. She was surrounded by family at Fairwinds Sand Creek in Idaho Falls, Idaho.\n\nConnie was born during the dirty 30’s in Ashland, KS on July 18, 1933. She remembered struggling to get home from her two room school in a blinding dust storm. She had to feel with her feet for the road. Home was the family cattle ranch where she lived with her parents; Namoi Lee Pyle McMinimy and Vernon W. McMinimy and her brothers Bill, Ranny and Milton. She graduated from Ashland High School where she met the love of her life George Vernon O’Bleness. They married in the Christian Church in Ashland on December 27, 1952. An ice storm blew in the night before their wedding and frosted all the trees in town. The whole town matched the flocked trees that decorated the church for the ceremony.\n\nConnie and George moved to Colorado Springs, CO. It was in Colorado that they began to raise their family. Connie gave birth to 5 children; Carol (Jerry) Nyberg-Caraviotis, Katy (Mike) Kramp, Mike (Gretchen) O’Bleness, Rebecca (Cal) MacLean and Patrick (Angie) O’Bleness. The family lived in CO, NY, IL, TX, CO and ID over the years. Raised on a cattle ranch cooking for the farm hand(s), Connie was a great cook. She loved baking bread and was famous for her cinnamon rolls that she would make while she and George ran a Bed and Breakfast. Her Friday night pizza attracted the neighborhood kids. Connie became a second mother to many of them. Often we came home from school or work to find our friends hanging out with Mom.\n\nWe will always remember Mom’s warm and infectious laugh, her love for family, her down to earth, generous and welcoming spirit. She always made everyone feel right at home. She was practical and adaptable wherever she lived. Most of all she was a loving person who was much loved. She was an active church member and an avid student of the Bible throughout her long life. As testimony to this we found “The Complete Works of Josephus” on her bookshelf as we were packing her apartment.\n\nConnie was an avid traveler. Even after George passed away Connie would hit the road to visit her relatives across the country. During these trips she would pursue her interest in both geology and genealogy by visiting cemeteries, caves and digging for gems and fossils. She was also known to go backpacking, even baking bread on the trail. She was proud to have visited all 50 states.\n\nWe would especially like to thank the staff of Fairwinds Sand Creek and Hospice of Eastern Idaho for their loving care of Connie, as well as us.\n\nConnie is survived by 4 of her children, 9 grandchildren and 14 great grandchildren. She was preceded in death by her husband George and her daughter Katy.\n\nThere will be a private burial in Ashland, KS and a Celebration of Life at a later time.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations can be made to:\n\nHospice of Eastern Idaho, 1810 Moran St., Idaho Falls, ID 83401-4337 https://hospiceofeasternidaho.com/donate/ or Development Workshop, 555 West 25th Street, Idaho Falls, ID 83402 https://www.dwinc.org/donation-form/\n\nCharles Warren Harrod was born on November 13, 1935, in Yates Center, KS, to Cleo E. “Pete” and Laurene (Johnston) Harrod. He was the first of three brothers. He spent his childhood in Yates Center hunting and fishing with his brothers Lauren and Les and his Uncle Phil Johnston, who was more of a big brother. He excelled in football, basketball, and track while at Yates Center High School, where he still holds the school record for the 180 yard low hurdles. He graduated from high school in 1953. CW went to Washburn University in Topeka on a football and track scholarship. He excelled in track, where, as a freshman, he was in a four-way tie for first place in the pole vault in the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletic Association Conference. His academic achievements were not so strong, and after one year, he enlisted in the Navy.\n\nCW served in the Navy from 1954 to 1958, where he made many lifelong friends. He served in wartime (the Korean Conflict) but saw no combat. He was a flight navigator, which sparked his love for flight and engineering. One of his favorite “war stories” tells of the time he and a buddy went into what was called French Morocco. He and his friend were struck on the head by two locals and robbed. Another was the time his plane was chased by a Russian reconnaissance aircraft when they flew into Russian airspace. After his service, CW enrolled in Emporia State Teachers’ College, where he pursued (and received this time) a degree in physics. During his final year, he met Joyce Ann Bowling, a nurse. (You know her as Annie.) CW ultimately asked for Annie’s hand in marriage. The answer was yes, but only if CW graduated and obtained employment. Fortunately for all, CW did graduate and obtained work at Boeing in Wichita, in February of 1962. They were married on February 24, 1962, one week after CW began his new career. CW and Annie were blessed with two amazing sons, Gordon, born in December of 1965, and Greg, who arrived in October of 1967. CW left Boeing in 1970 after rumors of lay-off. He obtained work at Cessna, where he was promptly layed off. He then tried his hand at insurance sales and computer programming, but (returned ultimately to Cessna, where he remained until his retirement in 1997.\n\nShortly after retiring, CW became a grandfather for the first time when Sarah was born in November of 1997. Grandson Eric was born in September of 2001. CW and Annie took many trips with Gordon and Greg as well as friends and family. Destinations included many trips to Las Vegas, many float trips in Missouri, trips to Florida, Texas, New Orleans, New Mexico, Nova Scotia, and California. They also spent a number of springtimes at college track meets throughout Kansas and the Midwest watching Gordon and Greg compete. A highlight for CW was the annual pheasant hunting trip to western Kansas. This tradition spans 60+ years and continues to this day. He also enjoyed the annual Pete E Harrod Memorial Fishing Trip, named after CW’s father. This is every July and also continues on. Both provided lifetime stories; some incredible and perhaps some better left only to those participating. CW and Annie spent thirty years, a lot of it retired, traveling back and forth from their Wichita home to Lagniappe (Cajun for “something extra”), their 35-acre “farm” near Toronto, KS. Lagniappe was (and still is) a favorite spot for grandkids Sarah and Eric, where they rode Grandma’s horse (“Stink”), fished, and explored. CW spent his final years battling Alzheimer’s disease. He was cared for by Annie for a number of years; they continued to travel back and forth from Wichita to Toronto on a regular basis until CW’s health worsened. In August of 2023, CW was moved into the Memory Unit at Homestead Nursing Home in El Dorado, KS. His health and memory continued to decline, but he still enjoyed regular visits from family. CW died peacefully in his sleep very early on the morning of November 6, 2023.\n\nCharles Warren Harrod; CW, Charles, Chuck, Chuckles, Warren, Charlie, Dad, and Grandpa, was preceded in death by his parents, brother Les, and uncle Phil Johnston. He is survived by wife Annie of Wichita and Toronto, sons Gordon (Michelle) of Wichita,and Greg, of Monterey Bay, CA. grandchildren Sarah of Portland, OR, and Eric, of Manhattan, KS, brother Lauren (Maggie) Harrod of Yates Center, KS, as well as numerous cousins, nieces and nephews.\n\nOn July 21st, 2023, Michael Hugh Bartlett, of rural Ford County Kansas, passed away peacefully at his home with his wife of 54 years (Carla) and his three adult children (Tori, Janae and Hugh Bartlett) all by his side.\n\nMike was born in March of 1949 to D.A. and Janie Bartlett, who have both preceded him in death. He was raised on a farm North of Fowler, Kansas, where he attended school and graduated high school with the class of 1967. He then went to Dodge City Community College. He also served in the Kansas National Guard and in May of 1969, Mike married his high school sweetheart, Carla Gerber. They lived in Fowler for a short period of time before moving to the farm where his parents had raised him and his 3 sisters, Dawn Ann (Walters), Sue (Wiseman), and Sara (Friesen).\n\nMike worked hard with his father and he became the 4th generation of Bartlett’s to make a living out on the family farm. Farming and feeding cattle were his passion in life and he had a talent for growing crops and livestock. He had many good horses and a number of loyal dogs over his lifespan. Mike wasn’t afraid to take an occasional risk which led him to some unique business opportunities such as buying a couple truckloads of wild mustangs or in another instance, a herd of buffalo. Raising buffalo suited him well and he maintained a herd for over 30 years.\n\nMike Bartlett rarely knew a stranger and he had a large menagerie of friends. Despite being a work-a-holic, he liked to have a good time and his sense of humor will be missed by all who knew him. Especially by his 10 grandchildren and 4 great grandchildren. The phone calls, cards, letters and visits Mike received during the last few months of his life were a tremendous source of happiness, peace, and comfort to him. He was proud, strong willed and tough so he carried himself with dignity the end of his battle with COPD.\n\nIn typical Mike Bartlett fashion, there are no funeral services planned, certainly no sad farewells or long goodbyes. A celebration of his life will occur with details to be determined later in time. He will be sorely missed by his loved ones.\n\nCarla Jane Huck, 76, passed away on Thursday, June 15, 2023, at a Topeka hospital. Carla’s life began on May 8, 1947, in Hardtner, Kansas. She was born the daughter of Carl and Evia (Carrick) Rathbun. Carla was raised in the Coldwater community, graduated from Coldwater High School in 1965, then received a bachelor’s degree from Ft. Hays State University.\n\nOn July 26, 1969, Carla married John Charles Huck in Coldwater. They were together until John’s passing on March 22, 2003. Also preceding her in death were her parents Carl in 1961 and Evia in 1997.\n\nCarla dedicated herself to working at Ft. Riley for more than 30 years before retiring in 2002. She then returned to work as the Office Manager for the Feyh Farm Seed company until 2020. The role was not traditional as she served as chauffeur for all of the Feyh family kids taking them to doctors’ appointments, driver’s education class, anywhere they needed to go. She was honored to be a part of their lives and loved them as her own grandchildren.\n\nIn recent years, you would find her at a softball diamond, wearing her visor, and cheering for her favorite girl’s softball teams. She knew the importance of positivity in a young girl’s life and spread that inspiration to all the players she cheered for.\n\nCarla loved her pets and they brought her much joy, especially during the difficult times after John was gone. Her heart ached for any animal in need and as her older furry friends made their journey over the rainbow bridge. She was the first to volunteer to help anyone with their pets and enjoyed telling them her favorite stories about her own pets.\n\nShe put everyone else’s needs before hers. She was there for a phone call, a ride to an appointment, lunch, or just a good laugh whenever anyone needed anything. Her ability to listen, understand, provide support during difficult times and find the humor in things will be greatly missed.\n\nBut most of all, she loved her girls. She enjoyed spending time with them and was so very proud of their accomplishments. She “loved them to the moon and back” and never failed to tell them. Her son-in-laws held a special place in her heart and she was pleased that they were here to take care of her and her girls.\n\nSurvivors include two daughters, Jodi (Kraig) Vondran of Wamego and Jaclynn (Steve) Brown of Alma. She also leaves behind a sister, Anita Lousch of Oklahoma and her family Joe, Marcia, Johnny Carl and Jerry; her twin sister Linda Jean (Larry) Johnson of Tucson, AZ; her sister-in-law Jane (Huck) Kay and her family Tim, Susan, and Andrew; cousins Jerry and Joe Coles; and step-grandchildren Melissa McCarthy and Jessica Parks; step-great-grandchildren Marley, AJ, and Miyah along with her softball family and countless friends, all who will miss her dearly.\n\nA Celebration of Life Memorial Service will be at 11:00 A.M. Friday August 11, 2023, at the KanEquip Arena on the Wabaunsee County Fair Grounds in Alma.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please donate to Helping Hands Humane Society and sent in care of Piper Funeral Home, 714 Maple Street, St. Marys, KS 66536 or to 5720 SW 21st Street, Topeka, KS 66604.\n\nPhyllis Ruth Fellers, of Goddard, KS formerly of Ashland and Protection, KS, passed away in Wichita on July 5, 2023, at the age of 82. Phyllis was born in Hays, KS July 1, 1941, to Freemond and Garland Peterson. She grew up with her two sisters and brother on the family dairy farm a mile north of Protection, KS. She had a wonderful childhood with two loving parents and cherished memories with her parents, brother, and sisters. On the farm and in her family, she learned the work ethic, values, manners, and religious beliefs that would define her for the rest of her life.\n\nPhyllis graduated from Protection High School in 1959 and then attended nursing school at Stormont Vail in Topeka, KS. Her nursing education was interrupted after she met John Thomas Fellers, from Ashland, KS. Phyllis and Tom met when they were a groomsman and bridesmaid at Tom’s brother, Robert, and Phyllis’s sister, Pat’s wedding. Shortly thereafter Tom and Phyllis were married in Protection, KS on May 21, 1961, and enjoyed 61 years of marriage until Tom passed away April 2, 2023.\n\nPhyllis and Tom lived for two years in Scott City, KS where Tom taught school. In the summers they would come home to Ashland, KS to run the municipal swimming pool. They moved back to Ashland, KS when Tom was offered a job in the Stockgrowers State Bank in 1963. During the fifty plus years they lived in Ashland, Phyllis’s number one priority was raising her three children, Jacque born in 1962, Tom born in 1965, and Elizabeth born in 1968. Phyllis and Tom also had a fourth child, David Craig, who was born in 1964 and passed away as an infant; while she seldom spoke of this, she always carried David in her heart.\n\nWhile focused on her family and home Phyllis also supported her husband’s career and efforts to serve and promote the community of Ashland. Phyllis worked for many years at the Ashland High School office as the secretary for the Superintendent. Later she helped manage the Ashland Health Clinic office. She was a member of many groups including the Ashland United Methodist Church Women’s Group and PEO. She loved to sew and when her children were young, she sewed many of their early school clothes that are forever memorialized in their school pictures. Later in life she developed a love of quilting and enjoyed the company and talking with her quilting friends as much as the actual quilting. She was a wonderful cook and made the best cinnamon rolls in the world according to her children. Simply put, she was a wonderful and loyal wife and mother and will be greatly missed by her family.\n\nPhyllis was preceded in death by her parents: Freemond and Garland Peterson; her husband: John Thomas Fellers; her infant son: David Craig; and brother-in-law: Robert Fellers.\n\nShe is survived by her children: Jacquelyn Cherie Stearns and husband Jim of Goddard, KS; Thomas Scott Fellers and wife Ellea of Lawrence, KS; and Elizabeth Ann Wager and husband Jeff of Wichita, KS.

After a honeymoon to South Dakota the couple lived in various Southwest Kansas communities including Ashland, Fowler, Big Bow and Ulysses before moving to Beaver, Oklahoma, in 1974 where they raised their two children, Justin and Amy, until 1996.\n\nWhile in Beaver, Renita enjoyed various jobs including working for the Beaver County Nursing Home, City of Beaver, and owned her own sewing and cloth store “The Cloth Cottage.” Renita’s enjoyment and passion for reading, eventually, led to a long career as the Beaver County Librarian where she was instrumental in moving the library from an index card system to completely computerized. In addition to bringing the library into the computer age, she helped to make the Beaver County Library’s Summer Reading program for kids a highlight for hundreds of Beaver County children for many years.\n\nIn 1996, both she and Bob moved to Englewood, Kansas, where they opened their own business, BOK Petroleum, a bulk oil and convenience store station. While in Englewood, she and Bob opened a grill as a part of the convenience store where they were the source of many hot meals, coffee, and fellowship for the town of Englewood. BOK Petroleum was the place to be, and Renita was the heartbeat that helped to make it thrive. After retiring from BOK, she worked at the Ashland clinic, but in 2014 she re-established her librarian career in Laverne at the Delphian Library where she, once again, helped to advance the library into the modern age and established the Summer Reading program for the children of the Laverne community until her retirement in January of 2022.\n\nRenita’s biggest passion and pastime was enjoying time with her children and grandchildren. Known as “MeMaw” to her grandchildren, she was constantly bragging on their achievements to anyone who would listen and attending whenever and wherever she could each activity they were involved in. Christmas time at “MeMaw’s” house included building gingerbread houses around the dining room table (no matter how old you were) and always reading the Christmas Story followed by singing of Christmas Carols, which ALWAYS had to include “Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.” Near and dear to her heart was her church family at the Rosston First United Methodist Church where she played the organ for Sunday services until her health would no longer allow it. Renita never met a stranger and will be missed by many people who came to love her in the Beaver, Laverne, and Englewood communities.\n\nRenita is survived by her husband, Bob, of the home in Englewood, Kansas; two children, Justin and is wife Jo of Elk City, OK, and Amy with her husband Larry Williams of Gunter, TX; seven grandchildren, Anna Mueller of Yukon, OK, Drew Ediger of Moore, OK, Jonah White of Orlando, FL, Hannah White of Elk City, OK, Trenton Williams of Tulsa, OK, Lizzie Williams and Jack Williams of Gunter, TX; two siblings Janice Campbell of Englewood, KS, and Dennis Hoover with his wife Sharon and their daughter Sarah of Waxahachie TX; and a host of other relatives throughout Kansas and Oklahoma.\n\nShe is preceded in death by one brother Alvin Neal and her parents Alvin and Reola Hoover of Beaver, Oklahoma.\n\nMemorial services will be held on Thursday, June 8, 2023 at 2:00 PM at the Laverne Methodist Church in Laverne, Oklahoma.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorials are suggested to the Rosston Methodist Church, 1347 North 174 Rd, Rosston, OK 73855 or the Laverne Delphian Municipal Library, PO Box 1102, Laverne, OK 73848.\n\nArrangements by Laverne Funeral Home, 421 S.

He went to his heavenly home on May 12, 2023, at the age of 95 years, 7 months and 3 days.\n\nChester grew up in the Cherryvale area and learned farming and helped with the dairy his family ran and attended school at Racob, Harmony, and Cherryvale high school graduating in 1947. He had rheumatic fever and other situations that put him back 2 years in school. Chester married Bonita Marie McGuire on February 4, 1949. They were introduced to each other by Chester’s friend Gerald McGuire, who happened to be Bonita’s brother 2 years younger than her. Chester always said the day they got married Bonita was the boss because she was 15 days older.\n\nChester and Bonita had a farm north of Cherryvale and started their family there. Later at the house in town where the oldest 3 children started school. Chester also worked for the Cherryvale township learning the road equipment and loved the big machines. They moved to Wichita for a few weeks then they moved to Harper, Kansas where he worked at a dairy for about 6 months. The Mishler’s moved to Ashland on September 28, 1958, to work for Cleo Bliss Plumbing, a job he was told about by friend D. L. Walker from Cherryvale who was pastor at the First Baptist Church of Ashland at the time. They also added their youngest child to the family in 1960.\n\nChester left the job with Bliss Plumbing for a job with Al Seidel Service and then in May 1964 the Mishler’s bought the plumbing side of Seidel’s business and opened Mishler’s Service Center in the building where the current bus barn is. In 1967 they moved next door east to the current location. Chester took refrigeration courses driving back and forth to Dodge City many nites to get certification and be able to work on the equipment. This added to the services he could provide in his business. Plumbing, heating and air conditioning, electric and refrigeration. They also sold and serviced appliances and televisions.\n\nChester served as deacon and trustee for the First Baptist Church in Ashland and on the city council. He joined the Odd Fellows lodge in 1963 which was the first step into the Masonic Lodge of Ashland and served as master at one time and a lifetime member of the Kansas Masonic Lodge.\n\nChester enjoyed going camping first in a family size tent and then in a camper that he built with friends Merle Pike and Mutt Stone. Bonita always said it was not a vacation for her as she had to load and unload provisions and still cook when they were camping. Chester loved to fish but was not known to really catch much. When up at the Clark County State Lake they would go hiking a lot and could be seen up there many weekends, just to be out of town and away from the phone. Other hobbies included wood working: making rocking chairs, rocking horses, cradles, hand pump scooter, truck for kids to peddle, a picnic table that would fold into a bench, and helping to update wooden chairs. He did make himself a wallet and check covers from leather which he also enjoyed. The last 20 years he enjoyed reading books but only if in his NOOK reader, and several magazines. We cannot forget his jigsaw puzzles that had become an obsession in the last 15 years. He worked on them at the senior center and would glue and frame them when done –at first even if it was only because he thought they were so pretty. If someone saw one that was being worked on, he would get it ready for them and the donation went to the senior center. He was very particular about the puzzles, had to do the frame first—or most of it, no pieces in the middle unless was in area where they were to attach and if you left the table be sure there were no pieces sticking to arms, clothes or had been swept off the table. He also got very upset if someone ‘forced’ a piece in the wrong place because they thought it looked like it went there. The last 2 months we could not get him to work on puzzles even at the hospital. Just seemed he was not in the right place to work on them even for a distraction.\n\nChester would be willing to try to fix or build almost anything. He would check lamps, ceiling fans, vibrating chair motors, tool motors, lawn mowers, weed eaters, garden tractors. He loved to tell stories about jobs he had done especially if they included mess ups done at the factory like one on a tractor that finally found a rag had been stuffed in the intake or someplace—the engine had to be taken apart to find the problem. For his 95 years he had many stories that would seem to merge in the telling as a name would remind him of something else. He could also ask questions about someone suddenly as if we were able to know what he had been thinking. He was really upset the last few years in not being able to remember names from the past but finally would listen when we pointed out we didn’t know the person anyway.\n\nChester loved his family and was proud of the many generations he had. He might have to be reminded of names but most he knew when heard name or saw them. He enjoyed the family gatherings on Thanksgiving but after a short time the noise got too much and he would have to go home saying, ‘my chair is calling me’. It was so good to have completely surprised him for his 90th birthday in 2017 with so many families and friends who came.\n\nChester was preceded in death by his parents, 4 brothers and 5 sisters, his wife Bonita in 1997, son Kevin in 2014 and daughter Kathleen in 2017. He is survived. his sister June Richardson of Haysville, KS; Sister Barbara and husband Larry McNickle of rural Cherryvale, KS. Son Tom and wife Renee Mishler of Dickinson, TX; Daughter Mary Mishler of Ashland, KS, daughter-in-law Becky Mishler of Ashland, and daughter Denise and husband John Cleveland of Birmingham, AL. 14 grandchildren, 30 great Grandchildren and 7 great-great grandchildren, many nieces, nephews cousins and friends.\n\nFuneral service were held at 10:00AM, Monday May 15, 2023 at the Ashland Church of God, with Nick Johnson officiating. Chet’s Grandsons and Great Grandsons were pallbearers. Interment followed at the Highland Cemetery Ashland, Kansas.\n\nThe family requests that any donations be given to the Ashland Senior Center.\n\nHal Noble White, 72, died Monday, May 1, 2023 at Wesley Medical Center, Wichita.\n\nHe was born May 15, 1950 at Dodge City, the son of Kenneth and Avis (Ward) White. He was a graduate of Bucklin High School and received his Bachelor of Arts from Sterling College. He chose to come back to the family farm to fulfill his God-given purpose to care for the land and raise Beefalo cattle.\n\nHal met the love of his life, Marilyn White, at Sterling College. While engaged, they attended Explo 72’ in Dallas, TX. This experience gave them a vision of how God might use them in ministry together. On July 28, 1972 they were married at Stafford, Kansas. Following their marriage, they organized Bible studies with youth and young couples. They were also instrumental in leading Christian contemporary summer musicals for 13 years. This included traveling to churches in Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas, with the purpose of learning to share God’s love with others through music, skits, and testimony. Over time, they served together through the AWANA program, VBS, and other programs in the church.\n\nIn 1975, Hal & Marilyn built a house on the farm. Together hand in hand, they faced life’s challenges. They reveled in the beauty of God’s creation from the wildflowers in the pastures, to the birth of a newborn calf, to the joy of planting and harvesting a crop. In time, they were blessed with three wonderful children, Aaron, Caleb, and Alicia.\n\nGrowing up, Hal was a member of the Boy Scouts of America earning his God & Country Award. He enjoyed many scout trips to the Spanish Peaks in Colorado. He was a member of the Minneola Community Church for over 50 years and served as a Sunday school teacher, board member, and Elder. He also was on the FSA board, Sodville Township board, and was a volunteer firefighter for Ford County. He was a faithful member of the Gideons International and loved handing out copies of God’s Word to everyone he could.\n\nHal enjoyed spending time with his children and grandchildren. Some of his most cherished moments were when his family all came home to work cattle and help with harvest. He also looked forward to spending time in Colorado with Marilyn relaxing by waterfalls and mountain streams. This past summer Hal and Marilyn celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary with the entire family making memories together in Wyoming.\n\nMost of all, Hal loved his Savior, Jesus Christ. He believed that if you have received Jesus as your personal Savior from sin and made him Lord of your life then everything we do has eternal meaning and value. To God be the glory for our beloved husband, father and grandfather.\n\nSurvivors include: his wife of 50 years, Marilyn; their 3 children, Aaron (Sarah) White, Norton, Kansas, Caleb (Megan) White, Colorado Springs and Alicia (James) Garrison, Collinsville, Oklahoma; 3 brothers, Lee (Julia) White, San Diego, California, Roy (Linda) White, Little Elm, Texas and John (Carolyn) White, South Jordan, Utah; and 10 grandchildren, Gideon, Isaiah, Genesis, Solomon, and Hadassah White; Andrew, Daniel, Elijah, and Adelyn White; and Joshua Garrison.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, a brother, Paul White and 2 sisters-in-law, Myrtle White and Gail White.\n\nGraveside service were at 2:30 pm Friday, May 5, 2023 at the Bucklin Cemetery.

She will be dearly missed, but her family is comforted in knowing that she is reunited with her beloved husband, John Alfred O’Brien.\n\nAlice Anne Bair was born in Minneola on August 10, 1931 to Ross and Nellie Bair. She grew up on her family’s farm, one mile east of Minneola, with her four siblings: Ross, Jr., Mary Lou, Linda Lee, and John. In Minneola, she was active in band, playing baseball in gym, basketball, 4H, and doing outdoor chores around the farm. She loved going into Minneola to visit her Aunt Bernice. And she often spoke about the family reunions the Bair and Moore family had.\n\nAfter graduating from Minneola High School in 1949, she attended Kansas State University and earned a degree in Home Economics in 1953. After graduating, Alice worked as a teacher in Jetmore, KS, teaching home economics. She must have wanted to travel, for she resigned her teaching position, and, after a stint working on a cruise ship on Lake Michigan, she went East with her sister Linda to Boston. There she worked as a high school teacher, Worcester County Extension Service agent, and sometime TV and radio guest who spoke about cooking.\n\nShe met her husband in a class at Fitchburg State when their classmates introduced the only two single participants. They started dating, fell in love, and were married in Dodge City in 1960. Their long marriage was a happy one, and they had four children: Dorothy Monica, Thomas, Joseph, and John, Jr.\n\nAfter marriage, Alice and John resided in Charlestown, MA, in a home three blocks away from the Bunker Hill Monument. She made many friends in the tight-knit community and became active in various organizations and her church. She and John later moved to New Hampshire in retirement.\n\nAlice was always kind, curious, and busy: She enjoyed listening to football and baseball games on the radio, writing letters, reading, traveling, cooking, baking, knitting, hooking rugs, sewing, restoring her home, gardening, and visiting over tea, especially with her grandchildren. She loved living in Boston, with its history and bustle. She never tired of exploring it by T or on foot, often walking from Charlestown to downtown Boston, MGH, and the Museum of Science.\n\nAlice is predeceased by her beloved husband, John, and her cherished daughter, Dorothy. She is survived by her three sons, their wives – Melanie, Tania, and Nancy, and eight grandchildren: Megan, Jennifer, Finn, Emma, John, Nancy Anne, Thomas, and Elizabeth.\n\nTo them, she was simply Grammie, and they fondly remember her home with its “cookies, tea, cactuses and dusty corners. She was such a beautiful soul and grandmother.”\n\nAnd even though she was far away, she was never far from her home in Kansas. She wrote letters, talked for countless hours with her parents and siblings, and visited often. And when she got too old to visit easily, she returned home in her mind. Eighty years later, Alice would still tell stories of her childhood: tending chickens, fetching cows from the little pasture, big family dinners, and, during WWII, watching training flights of planes fly over the Bair farm.\n\n“Bill” William Jack Frankie Rich passed away due to complications with lung cancer in St. Catherine Hospital in Garden City, KS on Easter morning, April 9, 2023, at the age of 83.

Bill and Peggy were able to build their dream home in 2004 on the Rich family farm where they were able to enjoy their retirements.\n\nBill was an avid outdoorsman who loved being active, hunting, and helping guide others on hunting adventures.

She was known fondly as the “Sweet, sweet lady.”\n\nOur Mom, grandma, sister, aunt, and friend touched the hand of our Savior on January 23, 2022, in Bakersfield, CA.\n\nBorn in Perryton, Texas on June 14, 1946, to Kenneth Raymond and Lita Doreen Schweitzer, she was one of four children. Mom was raised in Ashland, Kansas. She was the beautiful homecoming queen candidate, cheerleader, and baton twirler. Later, she became a cosmetologist in Liberal, Kansas: however, she left that profession to become a mother.\n\nMom married our dad, James Kilgore in 1965. Together, they built Zirkel Trucking, Inc. in Liberal, later relocating the business to Fort Scott, Kansas. They had three children. She was the “mama bear” to her three boys, Jim, Robert, and Eddy. She guided and protected us throughout life. We never went without.

With, at times, so very few resources of hers, she would give to those in need while sacrificing her own; truly an example of what love really means in life. Love is all we can take with us when we depart this beautiful big blue marble of earth. She left with no enemies.\n\nMom was preceded in departing this life by her parents, Kenneth and Doreen, sister Lynda Ritter, brother Gerold Schweitzer and her youngest son, our baby brother, Eddy.\n\nLeft behind to carry on that love and kindness to others are her sons and wives: Jim and Tracey Kilgore (Waco, Texas) and their children, Caleb (Samantha), Hannah (Max), Samuel and Daniel; Robert and Dianna Kilgore (Bakersfield, CA) and their children, Jordan (Ryan) Shell, Jakeb and Josef and grandchildren from her late son, Eddy, Jesse Massey and Tyler Kilgore. She is also survived by her baby brother and his wife, Alan and Becky Schweitzer (Johnson, Kansas), her sister- in-law, Mary Jo Schweitzer (Ashland), in addition to numerous nieces, nephews, and coun"
