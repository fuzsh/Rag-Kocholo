South Sudan’s population is said to be around 12 million people, according to a 2021 population estimates survey compiled by the National Bureau of Statistics.

The survey conducted through satellite imagery was presented at the Council of Ministers meeting yesterday.

Information Minister Michael Makuei Lueth said the assessment estimates could be less than the results of an actual population census because it is done remotely.

“According to the presentation made, the estimated population of South Sudan at present or in 2021 when it was prepared, is within the range of 12,444,018,” he said.

“The estimation is less than the actual population census because it is only done on numerical basis and periodic assessment using satellite of course, and satellite sometimes can lead to mistakes when there are clouds in that area, it will not be in a position to take proper images.”

Makuei said the estimates show that South Sudan has increased in population by more than four million people in the last 15 years.

“This is the approximate consideration or estimation and of course, it is not a substitute for the population census. But it is an indication that we have really increased in number because, in the last census in 2008, we were, I think, 8 million.”

However, the government spokesperson said the population estimates is not a substitute for a population census and that the government plans to conduct the census as stipulated in the revitalized agreement.

A 2022 United Nations population index has projected the lowest global population growth in 70 years, with South Sudan’s population faltering at only 11 million people.
