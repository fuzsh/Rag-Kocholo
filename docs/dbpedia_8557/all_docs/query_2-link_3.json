        "text": "This page provides an overview of the key characteristics of South Sudan along its likely (or Current Path) development trajectory. The Current Path forecast from the International Futures forecasting (IFs) platform is a dynamic scenario that imitates the continuation of current policies and environmental conditions. The Current Path is therefore in congruence with historical patterns and produces a series of dynamic forecasts endogenised in relationships across crucial global systems. We use 2019 as a standard reference year. The forecasts generally extend to 2043 to coincide with the end of the third ten-year implementation plan of the African Union's Agenda 2063 long-term development vision.\n\nSouth Sudan is a landlocked country in East Africa, bordered by Ethiopia, Sudan, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda and Kenya.\n\nSouth Sudan gained its independence from Sudan on 9 July 2011, following 98.83% support for the split in a referendum in January 2011, and so became the world's newest nation and Africa's 54th country. It has a surface area of 644 329 km² and, by 2019, had a population of more than 10 million. The country is also a member of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), an eight-country regional bloc in Africa with ambitions to embark on regional integration.\n\nSouth Sudan is classified as a low-income country, relying largely on oil for revenue (oil accounts for more than 90% of the country's total exports).\n\nDespite its abundant natural resources, South Sudan ranks near the bottom in various human and economic development indicators. For most of its recent history, the country has been plagued by persistent political instability, violent conflicts, corruption and poor governance.\n\nThanks to a peace treaty negotiated in 2018, the devastating civil war experienced by the country between 2013 and 2018 has subsided. The main protagonists, Salva Kiir Mayardit and Riek Machar, agreed to form a unity government, but the situation remains fragile and the pact could, as before, crumble again. Aside from a recent ceasefire, little else has been achieved, and mistrust among the various parties persists. Insecurity, lack of basic services, and unresolved housing, land and property issues prevented many people from returning home in large numbers. Some 8.3 million people in South Sudan are estimated to have needed humanitarian assistance in 2021.[1The World Bank, South Sudan Overview.] In sum, South Sudan faces many development challenges, which require decisive action.\n\nThe characteristics of a country's population can shape its long-term social, economic and political foundations; thus, understanding a nation's demographic profile indicates its development prospects.\n\nThe South Sudan government's negligible provision of medical care, along with poverty, violence and endemic disease, has limited life expectancy, which is far below the global average for both men and women.\n\nAt 4.7 children per woman, South Sudan had the 17th highest total fertility rate in Africa in 2020.\n\nThe population of South Sudan was 11.1 million in 2019, and on the Current Path it is forecast to be roughly 13.6 million by 2043, a 23% increase over a period of 24 years.\n\nSouth Sudan also has an overwhelmingly young population. The median age in 2019 was 17.6 years and the country had a youth bulge of about 49% in the same year. As of 2019, about 44% of the country's population is under the age of 15, and 27.4% is under 30. This means that a large portion of the population is dependent on the workforce to provide for its needs. The population under 15 years is expected to decline, but will still constitute about 37% of the population by 2043. The share of the elderly (65 and older) has been stable at 3.4% over time and it is projected to increase slightly across the forecast horizon to reach 4% by 2043.\n\nIn 2019, 55.3% of South Sudan’s population was in the 15–64-year age group, which is forecast to increase to 59% by 2043. The working-age group constitutes the largest share of the population, and this can be a potential source of growth provided the labour force is well trained and sufficient jobs are created.\n\nAs of 2019, only 20.3% of South Sudan’s population lived in urban areas, which makes the country one of the least urbanised in the Horn, East and Central Africa (HECA) region. This is nearly 11 percentage points below the average of 31% for low-income countries in Africa. On the Current Path, the rate of urbanisation in South Sudan is projected to increase to 26.4% by 2043, while the rural population will have dropped from 79.7% in 2019 to 73.6%. South Sudan will therefore remain largely rural across the Current Path forecast horizon.\n\nIn addition to forced urban migration driven by armed conflict and its effects, rural-to-urban migration is driven by the search for employment opportunities and education, as well as 'push factors' such as poverty, food insecurity, crop failure, land shortage and lack of cattle.[2Oxfam International, Country Brief, South Sudan.]\n\nIf not well managed, urbanisation could lead to problems such as unemployment, poverty, inadequate health, poor sanitation, urban slums and environmental degradation. Nearly the entire number of urban residents (91%) in South Sudan live in slums.\n\nGood urban planning could foster an inclusive economy by improving service delivery and reducing urban poverty. In addition, adequate and appropriate urban planning is essential to mitigate the impacts of climate change such as flooding.\n\nAs of 2019, only 20.3% of South Sudan’s population lived in urban areas, which makes the country one of the least urbanised in the Horn, East and Central Africa (HECA) region. This is nearly 11 percentage points below the average of 31% for low-income countries in Africa. On the Current Path, the rate of urbanisation in South Sudan is projected to increase to 26.4% by 2043, while the rural population will have dropped from 79.7% in 2019 to 73.6%. South Sudan will therefore remain largely rural across the Current Path forecast horizon.\n\nIn addition to forced urban migration driven by armed conflict and its effects, rural-to-urban migration is driven by the search for employment opportunities and education, as well as 'push factors' such as poverty, food insecurity, crop failure, land shortage and lack of cattle.\n\nIf not well managed, urbanisation could lead to problems such as unemployment, poverty, inadequate health, poor sanitation, urban slums and environmental degradation. Nearly the entire number of urban residents (91%) in South Sudan live in slums.\n\nGood urban planning could foster an inclusive economy by improving service delivery and reducing urban poverty. In addition, adequate and appropriate urban planning is essential to mitigate the impacts of climate change such as flooding.\n\nThe South Sudanese economy is especially vulnerable to weather fluctuations, oil price volatility and conflict-related shocks. The civil war that began in late 2013 severely disrupted the economy of South Sudan.\n\nOil extraction continues to be the backbone of the economy, accounting for nearly 90% of government revenue and more than 30% of the country’s GDP. Outside the oil sector, economic activities are concentrated in rudimentary agriculture and pastoral farming.\n\nIn 2019, the size of the South Sudanese economy was US$7.4 billion. The economy is projected to grow to US$16.3 billion by 2043, which will make it the 40th largest economy in Africa under the Current Path assumptions for other countries.\n\nThe current growth model of South Sudan, which is based on the oil sector, is fragile and holds little promise for improving livelihoods. Without significant structural transformation of the economy, growth will continue to be at the mercy of international commodity price shocks.\n\nTherefore, sustainable economic recovery in South Sudan will require addressing the underlying causes of the conflicts. Comprehensive macroeconomic reforms and policy changes will be needed to combat inflation, address foreign exchange distortions and diversify the economy away from oil.\n\nThe informal economy comprises activities with market value and that would add to tax revenue and GDP if they were recorded. The informal sector is a lifeline for many people in South Sudan and, in 2019, represented 66% of the total labour force.\n\nIn 2019, the size of the informal economy was equivalent to 34.4% of the country's GDP. It is projected to decline modestly — to 30.6% — by 2043, which will be above the average of 25.8% for low-income countries in Africa.\n\nAlthough the informal economy provides a safety net for the country's large and growing working-age population, it impedes economic growth and hinders improved economic policies. Reducing informality will allow more people to benefit from better wages and redistributive measures. Therefore, South Sudan needs to reduce the size of its informal economy with the least friction possible, by removing obstacles to business registration, tackling corruption and improving access to education and finance.\n\nThe IFs platform uses data from the Global Trade and Analysis Project (GTAP) to classify economic activity into six sectors: agriculture, energy, materials (including mining), manufacturing, service and information and communications technology (ICT). Most other sources use a threefold distinction between only agriculture, industry and services, with the result that data may differ.\n\nOil extraction is the backbone of the South Sudanese economy, making the energy sector dominant in the economy. In 2019, energy accounted for 54.2% of the country's GDP (US$4 billion), while the service sector, the second largest contributor to GDP, represented 32% (US$2.3 billion). Agriculture has the third largest contribution to the country's GDP, representing 10.1% of GDP in 2019 (US$750 million).\n\nOn the Current Path, the service sector will overtake the energy sector to become the largest contributor to GDP by 2034. Thus, the share of the service sector in GDP is projected to reach 64.3% (US$10.5 billion) by 2043 compared with 25.1% (US$4.1 billion) for the energy sector.\n\nAs a result of the structural transformation of the economy, the share of agriculture in GDP is forecast to decline to 6.4% (US$1.04 billion) by 2043. ICT and materials contribute marginally to the country’s GDP.\n\nThe manufacturing sector historically has been small, its development being hindered by factors such as the long-running civil war and severe shortages of trained labour. The manufacturing sector’s contribution to GDP in 2019 was 2.2%, and is forecast to decline to 0.5% by 2043. In order words, South Sudan will deindustrialise while it is still poor (premature deindustrialisation). This is not good for the country’s development prospects, as it will make it difficult to sustain growth, create jobs and reduce poverty.\n\nThe data on agricultural production and demand in the IFs forecasting platform initialises from data provided on food balances by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). IFs contains data on numerous types of agriculture, but aggregates its forecast into crops, meat and fish, presented in million metric tons. Chart 9 shows agricultural production and demand as a total of all three categories.\n\nSouth Sudan has considerable agricultural potential. Favourable soil, water and climatic conditions make 75% of its total land area suitable for agriculture. However, only 4% of the total land area is cultivated continually. Limited use of productivity-enhancing technologies, capacity constraints, poor infrastructure and protracted conflict have constrained agricultural production and the country continues to face recurrent episodes of acute food insecurity.[3African Development Bank, Development of Agriculture in South Sudan.]\n\nAs South Sudan became independent from Sudan only in 2011, there is no historical data regarding agricultural production and demand for the country. The IFs model therefore initialises from 2015. According to the forecast, South Sudan will have an agricultural surplus until 2040. This seems unrealistic, given the country's recurrent food insecurity and widespread malnutrition.\n\nAccording to a study by the African Development Bank, South Sudan is a net importer of food, and it imports 40% of its cereals from neighbouring countries, particularly Uganda and Kenya.[4African Development Bank, Development of Agriculture in South Sudan.] IFs forecast on this issue will improve over time as data becomes available. By 2043, agricultural demand is forecast to be 0.55 million metric tons higher than agricultural production.\n\nThere are numerous methodologies and approaches to defining poverty. We measure income poverty and use GDP per capita as a proxy. In 2015, the World Bank adopted the measure of US$1.90 per person a day (in 2011 international prices), also used to measure progress towards the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 1 of eradicating extreme poverty. To account for extreme poverty in richer countries occurring at slightly higher levels of income than in poor countries, the World Bank introduced three additional poverty lines in 2017:\n\nUS$3.20 for lower middle-income countries\n\nUS$5.50 for upper middle-income countries\n\nUS$22.70 for high-income countries.\n\nAlthough South Sudan is rich in oil, the citizens are yet to fully benefit from it. Expenditures on key social sectors, including health, education, water and sanitation, and agricultural and rural development, which could significantly reduce poverty, are limited. The government prioritises defence and security expenditures over basic service delivery. For example, military expenditure increased from about 6% of GDP in 2011 to nearly 21% in 2018, and the security payroll represents 58% of South Sudan's total government expenditure.[5African Development Bank, The political economy of South Sudan, 2018.] As a result, poverty is ubiquitous in the country and reinforced by intercommunal conflict, displacement and external shocks.\n\nBased on the $1.90 threshold, the poverty rate in South Sudan was 79.4% in 2019, equivalent to 8.2 million people. The rate is almost twice the average of 47.7% for low-income countries in Africa, and the highest in the Horn of Africa.\n\nIn the Current Path forecast, the rate of extreme poverty is projected to decline to its lowest point (48.6%) by 2038, before slightly increasing to 50.3% (6.8 million people) by 2043. This rate is twice the projected average of 25.1% for low-income countries in Africa in the same year.\n\nHowever, poverty goes beyond income, as it also impacts individuals' access to basic nutrition, health and education (multidimensional poverty). About 92% of the South Sudanese population is multidimensionally poor, with 74.3% of them in severe multidimensional poverty[6UN Development Programme, Global Multidimensional Poverty Index 2020 Report.] – the highest rate in the Horn of Africa.\n\nPolicymakers in South Sudan should make growth more inclusive by integrating the most vulnerable segments of the population, especially women, into the economy and enhancing human capital formation to meet the needs of the labour market and hence create more gainful jobs and accelerate poverty reduction. The government of South Sudan should prioritise investing in its people by allocating its income from oil into schools, hospitals, roads and agriculture to ensure sustainable, inclusive growth and poverty reduction.\n\nThe IFs platform forecasts six types of energy, namely oil, gas, coal, hydro, nuclear and other renewables. To allow for comparisons between different types of energy, the data is converted into billion barrels of oil equivalent. The energy contained in a barrel of oil is approximately 5.8 million British thermal units (MBTUs) or 1 700 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of energy.\n\nOil was the sole type of energy produced in South Sudan in 2019 (106 million barrels of oil). On the Current Path, oil will account for 91.6% of energy production by 2043.\n\nEnergy production from other renewable sources is currently at the embryonic stage. From a very low base, other renewable energy will account for 6.5% of total energy production (8 million barrels of oil equivalent) by 2043, despite South Sudan’s vast potential for renewable energy. For instance, the country has about 8 hours of sunshine per day, with a solar potential 436 W/m2/year. Wind power density is between 285 and 380 W/m2, which implies good resources for wind power generation.[7UN Environment Programme, South Sudan energy profile. ]\n\nThe Stability scenario represents reasonable but ambitious reductions in risk of regime instability and lower levels of internal conflict. Stability is generally a prerequisite for other aspects of development and this would encourage inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) and improve business confidence. Better governance through the accountability that follows substantive democracy is modelled separately.\n\nThe intervention is explained in here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nSouth Sudan remains caught in a web of fragility, economic stagnation and instability a decade after independence. Insecurity is widespread as the state's monopoly over power is challenged with only a semblance of government control evident in small parts of the country. The country's political space is dominated by the military owing to its long history of armed liberation struggle. In addition to its limited capacity, the government is unable to protect the civilian population as its national police, security forces and other armed actors are themselves involved in infighting and large-scale abuses of human rights. Overall, South Sudan's governance institutions are dysfunctional. The lack of elite consensus among the political and military leaders (at both national and local levels), who prioritise their own interests instead of the population's needs, threatens the country's stability and security and development.\n\nIFs' governance security index ranges from 0 (low security) to 1 (high security). The Current Path forecast shows lower stability in South Sudan than the average for low-income Africa. South Sudan’s score on the government security index was 0.55 in 2019, compared with 0.64 for low-income African countries.\n\nThis scenario improves security and stability in South Sudan. By 2043, the score in the Stability scenario is 0.77, about 22% higher than in the Current Path forecast and 8.5% higher than the projected average of 0.71 on the Current Path for low-income African countries.\n\nA state's capacity to maintain order is one of the most important conditions for development. Thus, the government and policymakers in South Sudan should take proactive measures for more social and political stability.\n\nThis section presents the impact of a Demographic scenario that aims to hasten and increase the demographic dividend through reasonable but ambitious reductions in the communicable-disease burden for children under five, the maternal mortality ratio and increased access to modern contraception.\n\nThe intervention is explained in here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nDemographers typically differentiate between a first, second and even a third demographic dividend. We focus here on the first dividend, namely the contribution of the size and quality of the labour force to incomes. It refers to a window of opportunity that opens when the ratio of the working-age population (between 15 and 64 years of age) to dependants (children and the elderly) reaches 1.7.\n\nIn 2019, the ratio of the working-age population to dependants was 1.1, meaning that there was almost one person of working age for every dependant. On the Current Path, it is forecast to be 1.4 by 2043. In the Demographic scenario, the ratio of the working-age population to dependants will reach 1.5 by 2043. The minimum ratio of 1.7 will only be reached in 2055, five years later than the average for low-income countries in Africa.\n\nThe increasing size of the working-age population in South Sudan can be a catalyst for growth if sufficient education and employment are generated to successfully harness their productive power. However, without sufficient education and employment opportunities, the situation could turn into a demographic 'bomb', as many people of working age may remain unemployed and in poverty, potentially creating frustration, social tension and conflict.\n\nThe infant mortality rate is the number of infant deaths per 1 000 live births and is an important marker of the overall quality of the health system in a country.\n\nAs of 2019, the infant mortality rate in South Sudan was 78 deaths per 1 000 live births, above the average of 48.5 for Africa's low-income countries.\n\nThe Demographic scenario reduces infant mortality to 40.6 per 1 000 live births by 2033, compared with 54 in the Current Path forecast. By 2043, the infant mortality rate will be 31 in the Demographic scenario, compared with 41 in the Current Path forecast.\n\nAt 21.2 deaths per 1 000 live births, the infant mortality rate in the Demographic scenario will be about 10 percentage points above the average for low-income countries in Africa by 2043. Nearly 75% of all child deaths in South Sudan are caused by preventable conditions such as diarrhoea, malaria and pneumonia.[8The Borgen Project, Five key facts about healthcare in South Sudan.] Almost 90% of South Sudan's population has no access to improved sanitation, and only 17% of schools have suitable latrines. The risk of contracting waterborne diseases such as diarrhoea, cholera, hepatitis, typhoid or Guinea worm disease is one of the world's highest.[9Malteser International, South Sudan: Safe water, sanitation and hygiene.]\n\nContinuing conflicts, instability and bad governance have resulted in limited access to clean water, which often leads to tensions between communities.\n\nThis section presents reasonable but ambitious improvements in the Health/WaSH scenario, which include reductions in the mortality rate associated with both communicable diseases (e.g. AIDS, diarrhoea, malaria and respiratory infections) and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) (e.g. diabetes), as well as improvements in access to safe water and better sanitation. The acronym WaSH stands for water, sanitation and hygiene.\n\nThe intervention is explained in here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nThe quality of a nation's health system can be gauged through indicators such as life expectancy, maternal mortality and infant mortality, among others. South Sudan lags behind its low-income peers on several health indicators. The civil war created health personnel shortages and destroyed health infrastructure. South Sudan has only one physician per 65 574 people and one midwife per 39 088.[10The Borgen Project, Five key facts about healthcare in South Sudan.] As a result, access to healthcare in South Sudan remains dangerously low, with a negative effect on life expectancy.\n\nLife expectancy in South Sudan was 58.8 years in 2019, below the average of 63.8 years for low-income countries in Africa.\n\nBased on the Health/WaSH scenario, life expectancy is estimated to increase to 67.2 years by 2043, compared with 66 years in the Current Path forecast. Even in the Health/WaSH scenario, life expectancy in South Sudan is more than three years below the projected average for low-income countries in Africa (70.9 years) in 2043.\n\nOn average, women had a higher life expectancy at birth (60 years) than men (57.6 years) in 2019. In the Health/WaSH scenario, life expectancy at birth for women is projected to be 68.8 years by 2043 compared with 65.8 years for men.\n\nAbout 75% of all child deaths in South Sudan are due to preventable conditions such as diarrhoea, malaria and pneumonia. Nearly 90% of South Sudan's population has no access to improved sanitation, and only 17% of schools have suitable latrines. The risk of contracting waterborne diseases such as diarrhoea, cholera, hepatitis, typhoid or Guinea worm disease is one of the world's highest.[11The Borgen Project, Five key facts about healthcare in South Sudan.]\n\nContinuing conflicts, instability and bad governance have results in limited access to clean water, which often leads to tensions between communities.\n\nThe infant mortality rate in South Sudan was 78.2 deaths per 1 000 live births in 2019.\n\nThe Health/WaSH scenario reduces the infant mortality rate to 46.6 deaths per 1 000 live births by 2033, compared with 54 in the Current Path forecast. By 2043, this rate is set to decline to 33.5 deaths per 1 000 in this scenario, compared with 40.7 in the Current Path forecast.\n\nThe infant mortality rate in the Health/WaSH scenario is still above the 2043 projected average of 21.2 for low-income countries in Africa.\n\nThe Agriculture scenario represents reasonable but ambitious increases in yields per hectare (reflecting better management and seed and fertiliser technology), increased land under irrigation and reduced loss and waste. Where appropriate, it includes an increase in calorie consumption, reflecting the prioritisation of food self-sufficiency above food exports as a desirable policy objective.\n\nThe intervention is explained in here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nThe data on yields per hectare (in metric tons) is for crops, but does not distinguish between different categories of crops.\n\nA thriving agriculture sector is crucial to long-term peace and development in South Sudan. Up to 95% of the country's population depends on farming, fishing or herding for their livelihoods.[12Food and Agriculture Organization, FAO in South Sudan.] However, levels of crop and vegetable production in the country remain low. As is the case in much of East Africa, farmers rely heavily on rain-fed crop production, meaning erratic or delayed rains can result in poor harvests. Limited access to quality seeds and planting materials constrain yields.\n\nIn the Agriculture scenario, crop yields in South Sudan improve from 3.2 tons per hectare in 2019 to 9.2 tons per hectare in 2043, which is twice the value forecast on the Current Path (4.6 tons) by 2043. By 2043, average crop yields in the Agriculture scenario are above the projected Current Path average for low-income Africa (3.5 tons per hectare) for that year.\n\nThe agriculture sector is a lifeline for millions of people in South Sudan, as 95% of the country's population depends on the sector to meet their food and income needs.\n\nMeasured at the US$1.90 threshold, the poverty rate in the Agriculture scenario will be 48.8% by 2043, compared with 50.3% in the Current Path forecast for the same year. This is equivalent to 200 000 fewer people living in extreme poverty. In the agriculture scenario, the number of poor people declines to a minimum (5.5 million) in 2035, before increasing to 6.6 million by 2043; the reason may be linked to population growth.\n\nFurther development in the agriculture sector is a viable option to reduce poverty in South Sudan. More investment in the sector will increase consumption and income, and pave the way for an agri-industry, positively affecting growth and poverty reduction.\n\nThe Education scenario represents reasonable but ambitious improved intake, transition and graduation rates from primary to tertiary levels and better quality of education. It also models substantive progress towards gender parity at all levels, additional vocational training at secondary school level and increases in the share of science and engineering graduates.\n\nThe intervention is explained in here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nYears of conflict, displacement and economic collapse continue to deprive children of education, harming the country's future. According to UNESCO, at least 2.2 million children in South Sudan are not in school, representing one of the highest rates of out-of-school children in the world. The majority of these children are girls, child soldiers, children with disabilities and children who are just too hungry, too busy working to help their families, or too afraid of the journey to school.[14UNESCO Institute for Statistics, New report shows 2.2. million children are out of school in South Sudan.]\n\nThe average years of education in the adult population (aged 15 years and older) is a good indicator of the stock of education in a country. School life expectancy in South Sudan is among the lowest in the world. The mean years of education for adults aged 15 years and over stood at 3.8 years in 2019, below the average of 4.4 years for low-income countries in Africa. On the Current Path, it is projected to improve to 5.2 years by 2043, which will just be a year below the average for low-income countries in Africa. Technically, this means that most people in South Sudan will not have primary education by 2043. However, in the Education scenario, the mean years of education improves by about six months above the Current Path forecast for 2043.\n\nThe situation facing girls at all ages is particularly alarming in South Sudan. About 60% of 7-year-old girls are not in school. The gender gap widens with age: while 10.6% of boys were in secondary school at age 16 in 2018, this was the case for only 1.3% of 16-year-old girls.[15UNESCO Institute for Statistics, New report shows 2.2. million children are out of school in South Sudan.]\n\nIn 2019, the mean years of education for men was 4.4 compared with 3.2 for women. In the Education scenario, the mean number of years of education for men reaches 6.1 by 2043, versus 5.2 for women.\n\nThe legacy of the civil war, combined with the cumulative effects of years of conflict, political instability and extreme poverty, has taken a toll on the quality of the education system in South Sudan. With a new peace agreement in place, development partners are making efforts to support the government’s effort in bringing children back to school and providing them with a quality education. However, the road to quality education for all children in South Sudan is still long.\n\nIn the Education scenario, the score for the quality of primary education improves from 27.3 in 2019 to 32.3 in 2043, an increase of 18% increase compared with the Current Path forecast of 27.4 and about 6% higher than the average of 30.6 for low-income African countries in the same year.\n\nThe score for the quality of secondary education goes from 37.5 in 2019 to 44.2 in 2043 in the Education scenario, an improvement of 20% compared to the Current Path forecast of 36.9 and the average of 37.8 for low-income African countries by then.\n\nQuality education is crucial for economic development. It allows the country to increase its current added value and create tomorrow's technological innovations. Thus, authorities in South Sudan should accelerate reforms to improve the quality of education in the country.\n\nThe Manufacturing/Transfers scenario represents reasonable but ambitious manufacturing growth through greater investment in the economy, investments in research and development, and promotion of the export of manufactured goods. It is accompanied by an increase in welfare transfers (social grants) to moderate the initial increases in inequality that are typically associated with a manufacturing transition. To this end, the scenario improves tax administration and increases government revenues.\n\nThe intervention is explained in here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nChart 30 should be read with Chart 8, which presents a stacked area graph of the contribution to GDP and size, in billion US$, of the Current Path economy for each of the sectors.\n\nIn absolute terms, the service sector’s contribution to GDP represents the biggest improvement compared with the Current Path forecast for 2043 and is forecast to be US$400 million larger than in the Current Path. The service sector is followed by ICT, with its contribution of US$30 million above the Current Path in 2043.\n\nAs a percentage of GDP, the share of the service sector is 0.65 percentage points larger than in the Current Path forecast in 2043. ICT follows, being 0.09 percentage points above the Current Path forecast. The contribution of Manufacturing improves slightly (0.01 percentage points) above the Current Path forecast by 2043, while the share of energy declines by 0.6 percentage points compared with the Current Path forecast.\n\nThe current growth model of South Sudan, driven by the oil sector, is fragile and holds little promise for improvements in livelihoods. Authorities should make efforts to diversify the economy and focus on the manufacturing and agricultural sectors to create jobs and, ultimately, reduce poverty.\n\nThe Leapfrogging scenario represents a reasonable but ambitious adoption of and investment in renewable energy technologies, resulting in better access to electricity in urban and rural areas. The scenario includes accelerated access to mobile and fixed broadband and the adoption of modern technology that improves government efficiency and allows for the more rapid formalisation of the informal sector.\n\nThe intervention is explained in here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nFixed broadband includes cable modem Internet connections, DSL Internet connections of at least 256 KB/s, fibre and other fixed broadband technology connections (such as satellite broadband Internet, ethernet local area networks, fixed wireless access, wireless local area networks, WiMAX, etc.).\n\nDespite some improvements, the ICT sector in South Sudan is one of the world's least developed, while future growth of the sector is hindered by instability, insecurity, widespread poverty and low literacy rates.\n\nFixed broadband subscriptions stood at 1.3 per 100 people in 2019, compared with the average of 2.3 for low-income countries in Africa.\n\nIn the Leapfrogging scenario, fixed broadband subscriptions increase to 39.1 per 100 people by 2043, more than double the Current Path forecast of 18.3 subscriptions per 100 people and the average of 30 subscriptions per 100 people for low-income countries in Africa in the same year.\n\nIn 2019, 2.2 million people had access to electricity in South Sudan, representing 21% of the total population. This is below the average of 32.2% for low-income countries in Africa.\n\nIn addition, access to electricity is skewed towards the urban population. In 2019, about 34.7% of the urban population had access to electricity, compared with only 17.6% in rural areas.\n\nIn the Leapfrogging scenario, 34.9% of the South Sudanese population (4.7 million people) will have access to electricity by 2043. This is far below the projected average of 60.5% in the Current Path forecast for low-income countries in Africa in the same year.\n\nBy 2043, 51.7% of the urban population will have access to electricity in the Leapfrogging scenario, compared with 44.9% in the Current Path forecast.\n\nThe Leapfrogging scenario projects that 28.9% of the rural population will have access to electricity by 2043, compared with 20% in the Current Path forecast for the same year.\n\nThe Free Trade scenario represents the impact of the full implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) by 2034 through increases in exports, improved productivity and increased trade and economic freedom.\n\nThe intervention is explained in here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nA trade balance is the difference between a country's exports and the value of its imports at a given time. A country that imports more goods and services than it exports in terms of value has a trade deficit, while a country that exports more goods and services than it imports has a trade surplus.\n\nSince its independence in 2011, South Sudan has struggled to integrate into the international trade network. The external trade of South Sudan is dominated by its oil exports, which accounted for 98% of total exports in 2019, putting the country's trade balance at the mercy of international commodity prices volatility.\n\nLike many African countries, the trade balance of South Sudan is structurally in deficit. In 2019, the country's trade deficit amounted to nearly 15.4% of GDP. In the Free Trade scenario, South Sudan's trade balance does not improve and the deficit increases to a peak of 36.4% of GDP in 2039, before declining slightly to about 30% in 2043, in line with the Current Path forecast.\n\nWith the removal of trade restrictions following trade liberalisation, it is easier to import goods, especially as the weak manufacturing sector of South Sudan faces intense competition on the export markets.\n\nHowever, using only the trade balance is not a viable indicator to conclude that South Sudan will be a loser when the AfCFTA is implemented, as other indicators also need to be considered.\n\nThe Financial Flows scenario represents a reasonable but ambitious increase in worker remittances and aid flows to poor countries and an increase in the stock of FDI and additional portfolio investment inflows to middle-income countries. We also reduced outward financial flows to emulate a reduction in illicit financial outflows.\n\nThe intervention is explained in here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nMany countries in sub-Saharan Africa are still heavily dependent on foreign aid to provide basic services such as education and health. This is also the case for South Sudan, despite its immense oil deposit. The European Commission estimates that nearly 8.7 million people, representing 75% of the South Sudanese population, will require humanitarian aid in 2022. This is as a result of the combined effect of conflict, climate change, economic crises and the COVID-19 pandemic.[16European Commission, South Sudan factsheet.] Aid constituted 19.5% of the country's GDP in 2019, significantly above the average of 8.5% for low-income Africa.\n\nIn the Financial Flows scenario, foreign aid flows to South Sudan will account for 13.1% of GDP by 2043, above the Current Path forecast of 11.5%, and the average of 3.8% for low -income countries in Africa.\n\nSouth Sudan is a net recipient of remittances, which amounted to US$700 million in 2019. This is equivalent to 10.1% of GDP for that year. the country remains a net recipient of remittances until 2034. In the Financial Flows scenario, the total net remittances to the rest of the world amounts to US$600 million (3.4% of GDP) by 2043, compared with US$800 million (5.2% of GDP) in the Current Path forecast.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that as South Sudan gained its independence from Sudan only in 2011, there is no historical data regarding remittance inflows for the young country. The IFs model therefore initialises from 2015. According to the forecast, South Sudan will be a net supplier of remittances from 2034. This is not realistic. IFs’ forecast on this issue will improve over time as historical data become available.\n\nThe Infrastructure scenario represents a reasonable but ambitious increase in infrastructure spending across Africa, focusing on basic infrastructure (roads, water, sanitation, electricity access and ICT) in low-income countries and increasing emphasis on advanced infrastructure (such as ports, airports, railway and electricity generation) in higher-income countries.\n\nNote that health and sanitation infrastructure is included as part of the Health/WaSH scenario and that ICT infrastructure and more rapid uptake of renewables are part of the Leapfrogging scenario. The interventions there push directly on outcomes, whereas those modelled in this scenario increase infrastructure spending, indirectly boosting other forms of infrastructure, including that supporting health, sanitation and ICT.\n\nThe intervention is explained in here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nInfrastructure, whether in transportation, telecommunications, electricity or water and sanitation, is severely lacking in South Sudan. Since the colonial era, there has never been a backbone for electricity transmission, and none was developed during Sudanese rule.\n\nIn 2019, about 2.2 million people had access to electricity in South Sudan, representing 21% of the population. This is below the average of 32.2% for low-income countries in Africa. The Infrastructure scenario increases the number to 5.6 million by 2043, constituting 41.3% of the population. This is above the projected number of 3.6 million (26.5% of the population) in the Current Path forecast.\n\nIn the Infrastructure scenario, it is projected that 55% of the urban population in South Sudan will have access to electricity by 2043, compared to 44.9% in the Current Path forecast. However, by 2043 only 36.4% of the rural population (3.6 million people) will have access to electricity in the described scenario, compared with 20% (2 million people) in the Current Path forecast. This points to the huge disparity in access to electricity between the urban and rural population in South Sudan.\n\nThe Governance scenario represents a reasonable but ambitious improvement in accountability and reduces corruption, and hence improves the quality of service delivery by Government.\n\nThe intervention is explained in here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nAs defined by the World Bank, government effectiveness 'captures perceptions of the quality of public services, the quality of the civil service and the degree of its independence from political pressures, the quality of policy formulation and implementation, and the credibility of the government's commitment to such policies'.\n\nWeak government effectiveness and the absence of strong institutional and legal mechanisms to ensure accountability hamper economic progress in South Sudan. According to the Ibrahim Index of African Governance, the country was the second worst performer in governance in Africa after Somalia and rates similarly with regard to corruption.\n\nThe government effectiveness score for South Sudan was 0.19 (out of a maximum of 5) in 2019, which is projected to increase in both the Current Path forecast and the Governance scenario by 2043 — to 0.3 and 0.56, respectively. The score in the Governance scenario is therefore 0.26 points higher than the projected score in the Current Path forecast for that year.\n\nHowever, the score will still be lower than 2043 average in the Current Path forecast (1.9) for low-income countries in Africa.\n\nThis section presents projections for carbon emissions in the Current Path for South Sudan and the 11 scenarios. Note that IFs uses carbon equivalents rather than CO2 equivalents.\n\nIn 2019, South Sudan released about 0.4 million tons of carbon, and on the Current Path it is expected to emit 2.4 million tons by 2043. This is an increase of 500%. Although carbon emissions are set to increase as economic activity increases, South Sudan's carbon emissions come from a very low base. Like many developing countries, the country will suffer disproportionately from climate change, which it has contributed very little to. Nonetheless, the country must reduce its carbon emissions and move towards using renewable energy for sustainable growth to mitigate climate change.\n\nThe Agriculture scenario has the most significant impact on carbon emissions. The Demographic scenario has the lowest level of carbon emissions. The reduction in population growth curtails pressure on resources and hence minimises environmental degradation. By 2043, the amount of carbon emissions is higher than in the Current Path forecast in all scenarios, except for the Demographic scenario. Carbon emissions range from 2.6 million tons (Agriculture scenario) to 2.3 million tons (Demographic scenario).\n\nThe Combined Agenda 2063 scenario consists of the combination of all 11 sectoral scenarios presented above, namely the Stability, Demographic, Health/WaSH, Agriculture, Education, Manufacturing/Transfers, Leapfrogging, Free Trade, Financial Flows, Infrastructure and Governance scenarios. The cumulative impact of better education, health, infrastructure, etc. means that countries get an additional benefit in the integrated IFs forecasting platform, which we refer to as the synergistic effect. Chart 55 presents the contribution of each of these 12 components to GDP per capita in the Combined Agenda 2063 scenario.\n\nThe synergistic effect of all the scenarios on GDP per capita is US$62.1 in 2043.\n\nThe scenario with the most significant impact on GDP per capita by 2043 is Stability, followed by Agriculture. Health/WaSH has the least impact on GDP per capita. This suggests that harnessing the country's agricultural potential and increasing internal stability is key to improving human and economic development in South Sudan.\n\nChart 55 presents a stacked area graph of the contribution of each scenario to GDP per capita, as well as the additional benefit or synergistic effect, whereas Chart 56 presents only GDP per capita in the Current Path forecast and the Combined Agenda 2063 scenario.\n\nIn the Combined Agenda 2063 scenario, it is expected that the government of Sudan will make a concerted effort to remove the binding constraints on growth and inclusive development.\n\nThe Combined Agenda 2063 scenario has a much greater impact on GDP per capita than the individual thematic scenarios.\n\nBy 2033, GDP per capita is US$364 more in the Combined Agenda 2063 scenario than in the Current Path forecast. By 2043 it is expected to increase to US$3 805, which is US$1 327 more than in the Current Path forecast for that year.\n\nThe Combined Agenda 2063 scenario shows that a policy push across all the development sectors is necessary to achieve sustained growth and development in South Sudan.\n\nSee Chart 8 to view the Current Path forecast of the sectoral composition of the economy.\n\nAs a percentage, the agriculture sector records the largest improvement in contribution to GDP compared with the Current Path forecast. This lasts until 2029, by when it will be overtaken by the service sector. By 2043, the contribution of the service sector in this scenario is nearly six percentage points larger than in the Current Path forecast. The contributions from the agriculture and manufacturing sectors are 1.3 and 1.4 percentage points above the respective Current Path forecasts. However, the share of the energy sector will be 10.5 percentage points below the Current Path forecast.\n\nIn absolute value, the Combined Agenda 2063 scenario results in the service sector representing the most significant improvement, with its value US$10.3 billion larger than in the Current Path forecast for 2043. The service sector is followed by the agriculture sector, with its 2043 value in the Agenda 2063 scenario being US$1.2 billion larger than in the Current Path forecast.\n\nThe contributions from materials, ICT and energy to GDP are US$100 million, US$900 million and US$200 million larger, respectively, than the Current Path’s forecasts for 2043. Going forward, services will become the dominant sector of the South Sudanese economy, although manufactures will grow appreciably in the Combined Agenda 2063 scenario.\n\nThe Combined Agenda 2063 scenario significantly impacts carbon emissions, albeit from a very low base, owing to the increased economic activity.\n\nIn this scenario, carbon emissions increase from 0.43 million tons in 2019 to 3.3 million tons by 2043, an increase of 667.4%. In the Current Path forecast carbon emissions increase by 458% over the same period.\n\nIn 2043, the carbon emissions in the Combined Agenda 2063 scenario is 0.88 million tons higher than in the Current Path forecast.\n\nIf the Combined Agenda 2063 scenario materialises, it would stimulate high economic growth and reduce poverty significantly in South Sudan, but the cost in terms of environmental degradation will be relatively high.\n\nTo mitigate the environmental impact of the Combined Agenda 2063 scenario, its implementation should be accompanied by concrete steps to accelerate the green energy transition."
