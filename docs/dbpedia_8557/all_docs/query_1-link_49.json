        "text": "9 million people, 72% of South Sudan’s population, will require humanitarian assistance in 2024.\n\n7.1 million people are expected to experience severe food insecurity between April and July 2024, with thousands living in famine-like conditions. Undernutrition remains at critical levels for 1.4 million children.\n\nThe Sudan conflict is generating an unprecedented wave of returns and arrivals (570,000 as of 20/02/2024), in addition to the 300,000 refugees already in the country.\n\nThe EU remains committed to providing life-saving needs-based humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable.\n\nElections are planned for December 2024. However, the security situation is not improving, with increased inter-communal violence resulting in civilian casualties, new displacements, and a very insecure environment for aid workers. Compounded with the consequences of climate change, macro-economic shocks, and the consequences of the war in Sudan, South Sudan is sinking further into the worst humanitarian crisis since independence.\n\nMore than 4 million people, or over 1/3 of the population, are displaced. This includes 2 million internally displaced and nearly 2.2 million who are living as refugees in neighboring countries.\n\nSouth Sudan is hosting more than 400,000 refugees, including over 110,000 who have arrived since the beginning of the conflict in Sudan, and more than 450,000 South Sudanese who have returned from Sudan since April 2023.\n\n9 million people (54% of them children) will require humanitarian assistance in 2024, including 7.1 million people estimated to become severely food insecure at the peak of the lean season between April and July. It is estimated that more than 1.4 million children will suffer from acute malnutrition during the same period.\n\nHealth indicators are among the worst in the world, with 6.3 million people having limited access to essential healthcare services. Epidemic outbreaks, water-borne and endemic diseases are reported, particularly in sites for the internally displaced and congested settlements.\n\nBeyond the huge logistical challenges, South Sudan continues to be among the most dangerous countries for humanitarian workers, with 34 of them killed in 2023.\n\nIn 2024, the EU allocated €49.5 million for humanitarian actions covering the response to displacements, violence, and the consequences of the Sudan crisis across South Sudan.\n\nThis includes €4 million to support static and mobile interventions for education in emergencies, focusing on primary education for newly displaced and out-of-school children.\n\nFood insecurity and malnutrition are at a record high across the country. The EU is helping to reduce excess mortality and morbidity through emergency food assistance and nutrition interventions, including in hard-to-reach areas.\n\nIn addition, EU humanitarian funds help address critical humanitarian needs through emergency lifesaving activities, particularly when facing new shocks, using integrated multi-sector approaches and mobile outreach teams. The opportunity to provide cash assistance is also supported.\n\nEU-funded humanitarian projects also provide humanitarian protection assistance to communities affected by violence in the country, new displacement, and/or climate change.\n\nThe EU also supports the humanitarian response to the consequences of the Sudan crisis in border areas (camp management, onward transportation) and in the most vulnerable communities affected by the large number of returns.\n\nThe EU continues to strongly support principled humanitarian assistance and advocate for the protection of humanitarian workers and their safe and sustained access to all parts of the country.\n\nLast updated: 27/02/2024"
