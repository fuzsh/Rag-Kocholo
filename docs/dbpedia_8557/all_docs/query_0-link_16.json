The <strong>Republic</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>South</strong> <strong>Sudan</strong> gained its independence from <strong>Sudan</strong> on 9 July 2011 after more than 50 years <strong>of</strong> a protracted war that claimed over 3 million lives and displaced over a million people. The long conflict destroyed the little infrastructure and governance structures that existed prior to the conflict. Thus, <strong>South</strong> <strong>Sudan</strong> is the one <strong>of</strong> the least developed countries in Africa, and as such is highly vulnerable to climate change. 2. <strong>South</strong> <strong>Sudan</strong> is vulnerable to climate change and associated socio-economic losses and damages due to the dependence <strong>of</strong> its population on climate-sensitive natural resources for their livelihoods. Furthermore, there is currently limited institutional and technical capacity, appropriate technologies and financial resources to support the implementation <strong>of</strong> interventions for adaptation to climate change. 3. The Ministry <strong>of</strong> Environment has developed an Environment Policy Framework and Environmental Bill that will regulate the exploitation <strong>of</strong> natural resources and all forms <strong>of</strong> socio-economic development in the country. The Policy and Bill, when operationalized, will address the drivers <strong>of</strong> environmental degradation and contribute towards the mitigation <strong>of</strong> climate change while ushering the country towards a path <strong>of</strong> environmentally sustainable development. 4. To respond to the negative impacts <strong>of</strong> climate change, the Ministry <strong>of</strong> Environment, other line ministries and civil society stakeholders – with the support <strong>of</strong> UNEP – is currently developing a National Adaptation Program <strong>of</strong> Actions (NAPA, 2015). This will form the basis for adapting to the new realities <strong>of</strong> climate change impacts. 5. Within the context <strong>of</strong> these national circumstances, <strong>South</strong> <strong>Sudan</strong>’s Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) are based on a cross-sectoral consultative process involving multiple stakeholders that was conducted in parallel to the NAPA preparatory work and associated meetings. The INDCs will also contribute towards the attainment <strong>of</strong> <strong>South</strong> <strong>Sudan</strong> Vision 2040 and the <strong>South</strong> <strong>Sudan</strong> Development Plan, both <strong>of</strong> which aim to, amongst other objectives, ensure that economic development is environmentally sustainable. National Circumstances 6. <strong>South</strong> <strong>Sudan</strong>, the world’s newest nation, is a landlocked country located in north-eastern Africa, with a total area <strong>of</strong> 619,745 km 2 and a population <strong>of</strong> approximately 12,340,000 (2015 estimates). <strong>South</strong> <strong>Sudan</strong> is highly vulnerable to the impacts <strong>of</strong> climate change. The country’s population is highly dependent on climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture (that is mainly rain-fed) for their"
