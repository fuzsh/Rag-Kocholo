Journalists, activists, critics and political opposition members faced arbitrary arrest and detention, and torture and other ill-treatment. A critic of the government was forcibly returned from Kenya and held in prolonged detention by the National Security Service. Government forces and armed groups committed serious human rights violations and abuses, including extrajudicial executions, unlawful killings, conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence, and the recruitment and use of children.
