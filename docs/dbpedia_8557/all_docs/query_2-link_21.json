        "text": "ECONOMY & LIVELIHOODS\n\nTonj East County is located in Warrap State. It borders Tonj South County to the south-west and Tonj North County to the north. It also borders Unity State (Mayendit County) to the east and Lakes State (Rumbek North and Cueibet counties) to the south-east.\n\nThe county is part of the Western Flood Plains livelihood zone (FEWSNET 2018). The area is rich in grazing land and water points, and this has attracted pastoralist communities to the county during the dry season. Swampy plains form a permeable natural geographic boundary between different Dinka communities in Warrap and Lakes States and with Nuer in Unity State. The River Tonj continues northwards from Tonj South, through Tonj East to Tonj North and Unity State to join the River Bahr el-Ghazal. Tonj East was affected by flooding in both 2020 and 2021. In 2021 it was identified as a flood-affected county by the Emergency Response Coordination Centre.\n\nA study by FAO and WFP (2018) indicates that 65% of households engage in farming, declining to 60% by 2021 (FAO/WFP 2022). Planting is conducted during the rainy season, though some cultivation also occurs during summer. The main crops are sorghum, simsim (sesame), millet, groundnut peas, okra and pumpkin. In 2021 and 2022, gross cereal yields were estimated to be 0.6 tonnes per hectare (FAO/WFP 2023). While ideal for cattle herding, the landscape is very difficult to transverse by road. Most towns are more than 50 km apart, across difficult terrain, leaving the border grazing areas remote and making Tonj East one of the least developed counties in Warrap State. Livestock ownership is widespread in Tonj East. Pastoralists throughout Tonj East – like others from Tonj South, Abyei, and Lakes/Unity States – migrate during the dry season in search of water in various parts of the northeastern and eastern Warrap State.\n\nIn November 2022, the IPC projected Tonj East County as being at an emergency (IPC level 4) level of food insecurity, with conditions projected to persist at the same level until at least July 2023. The IPC Global Support Unit released an additional report from the Famine Review Committee indicating that 5% of the Tonj East population was likely experiencing Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) levels of acute food insecurity in November 2020.\n\nIn addition to local trade routes, Tonj East has also historically maintained trade routes with Unity State, however, this has been negatively impacted by the militarization of Mayom County, and the participation of several militias from that area in the civil war. The rainy season also makes roads difficult to travel on, making the trade of goods in the market challenging, particularly for households that have depleted their food stores. The county’s primary markets are located in Palal, Ngap-Agok, and Romic.\n\nCONFLICT DYNAMICS\n\nInsecurity in Tonj East often resembles conflicts in neighbouring Tonj North and South counties, though Tonj East’s geographical position along the borders of both Lakes and Unity state – alongside its distinctive political and clan dynamics – means the causes and trajectory of conflict can take dissimilar forms. Unlike Tonj South and Tonj North, Tonj East has not produced substantial numbers of elites in Juba, whilst the county is politically and socio-economically marginal within Warrap State. Divided between the Greater Ananatak sections (Akook, Aliap, Jalwau, Luac-Koth, Thiik) of the Rek Dinka (who are the largest clan within Warrap State, with a strong presence in national political and security institutions) in the western areas of the county, and the Luac-Jang/Luanyjang clan in the east, disputes between elements of the two communities have at times resulted in serious instances of violent conflict. Moreover, the Luac-Jang clan have been embroiled in periodic conflict and raiding with parts of the neighbouring Haak Nuer of Unity State’s Mayendit County, and with parts of the Dinka Agar and Gok clans of northern Lakes State (Craze 2022, pp. 54-55). As is discussed further in the profile for Rumbek North County, serious conflict broke out between parts of the Jalwau section of the Rek Dinka and the Pakam section of the Dinka Agar in 1998.\n\nAs discussed in further detail in the profiles for Tonj North and South counties, what may appear to be ‘inter-communal conflicts’ in Greater Tonj are often closely connected to the politics of Juba. Though such violence is often presented as taking the form of sequential ‘cattle raids’, ‘revenge killings’ or ‘land disputes’, such accounts rarely explain the forces at work in producing or intensifying violent conflict (Craze 2022; UN Panel of Experts 2020; Watson 2023). Violence linked to cattle raiding or disputes around administrative borders or grazing land has become increasing difficult to distinguish from conflicts that are linked to elite rivalries, and in the wake of the 2018 R-ARCSS the fusion of localised and national sources of conflict has resulted in both a militarisation of disputes and heightened levels of conflict.\n\nFor example, in 2020, instability within parts of South Sudan’s security establishment played out in the form of a disarmament campaign in and around Tonj East, with the UN Panel of Experts (2020, pp.12-13) alleging the involvement of a number of senior elites and commanders from the Greater Bahr el-Ghazal area. This disarmament campaign emerged in the context of reported rivalries among some senior elites and the support they have provided to competing armed groups in the area (Craze 2022, p.36). The campaign culminated in the deaths of a reported 148 people following a two-day confrontation between armed groups affiliated with different security institutions and communities in and around Romic town in Tonj East County (UN Panel of Experts 2020, p.13). Humanitarian access and supply routes to Tonj East were reported to have been blocked in the aftermath of the fighting, with access also being blocked following clashes between Luac-Jang and Greater Ananatak sections later in 2020 (Craze 2022, p.37, 55).\n\nAlthough national and subnational agendas have played an increasing role in shaping conflict dynamics in Tonj East localised drivers of conflict such as competition over natural resources such as water and pasture continue to shape patterns of conflict in parallel to this. However, the relationships between communities and key natural resources – like relative high ground, pastures, and water points – is highly dynamic and informed by both historical legacies and contemporary issues. In reality, it is rare that an absolute scarcity in resources leads to violence: it is more often the real or perceived exclusion and threat of exclusion from key resources that drives violence. Such conflicts have been particularly acute when involving elements of the Rek and Luac-Jang Dinka clans, notably in disputed grazing areas along the border between Tonj North and East. In October 2015, it was reported that 92 people were killed in clashes between militias from the two clans over control of grazing land at Lolith along the Tonj North border (Radio Tamazuj 2015; Sudan Tribune 2015). Meanwhile, brewing tensions culminated in an attack in the border area of Marial Lou in July 2021, with armed elements targeting humanitarian facilities (Eye Radio 2021). In October 2021, a further flare-up of violence resulted in at least 30 people being killed and 80 injured (Radio Tamazuj 2021).\n\nAdditionally, violence motivated by revenge for previous killings or for the perceived breach of customs or agreements can flourish in the absence of effective or impartial judicial mechanisms. At least 40 people were killed in fighting among two Luac-Jang sections in September 2014, after the alleged abduction of a women (which may have been an elopement) (Radio Tamazuj 2014). Meanwhile, in October 2023 intra-Luac-Jang violence relating to an unresolved grievance dating back to 2006 killed six people (Radio Tamazuj 2023). This fragmentation within the Luac-Jang community has complicated peacebuilding and reconciliation initiatives in the area.\n\nAlthough intermittent cross-border raiding has occurred along the border with some mostly Nuer communities from Mayendit County, particularly severe violence has been linked to cross-border disputes along the borders with Cueibet and (especially) Rumbek North counties of Lakes State. Parts of the pastoralist community from the Pakam section of the Dinka Agar clan (based in Rumbek North) have been engaged in cattle raids and counter-raids with parts of the Luac-Jang community, with over 90 people killed during serious violence in April 2008 (UNSC 2008). In March 2018, cross-border raiding involving parts of the Dinka Agar and Greater Ananatak section reportedly killed 22 people (UNSC 2018). More recently, clashes between parts of the Luac-Jang and Pakam section escalated significantly along the border between Tonj East and Rumbek North in 2023, with communities from other parts of Greater Tonj reported to have supported the Pakam section. A report from the UNSC estimated that 143 people were killed during the conflict in February, with a further 76 killed in April (UNSC 2023, p.4). iolence reportedly resumed in early 2024, killing at least 20 people (Radio Tamazuj 2024).\n\nSuch conflicts have occurred despite a number of peace reconciliation meetings in recent years, which have sought to improve understanding and communication between border communities and to decrease cattle raiding. This builds on a tradition of cross-border and cross-community peacemaking, including the famous 1999 Wunlit Peace Conference which took place in Tonj East (Amuom 2021).\n\nWhile communities in Tonj East were not directly exposed to violence in the context of the 2013-2018 civil war, insecurity in the area has accelerated since the signing of the R-ARCSS due to militarization, changes in administrative and political representation, and a lack of rule of law. Recruitment from Greater Tonj into different – and sometimes competing – security institutions increased in late 2018 and 2019 has similarly contributed to the militarization of the region (Boswell 2019, p.13; UN Panel of Experts 2019, p.12). An unintended effect of the R-ARCSS was to increase political tension in certain parts of the country as a result of the formulas used to allocate positions under the agreement, which resulted in some government strongholds (including Warrap State) being required to apportion a limited number of administrative and political posts to opposition groups. In Warrap, Tonj East (as well as Twic County) received SPLA-IO county commissioners, with the SPLA-IO able to expand its influence in Warrap via such appointments (Craze 2023). The elevated levels of competition and militarisation present potentially complicating factors for the forthcoming national elections scheduled for late 2024 in Warrap and Tonj East in particular."
