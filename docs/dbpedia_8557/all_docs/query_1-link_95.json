        "text": "South Sudan , officially Republic of South Sudan, Country, northeastern Africa. Area: 248,775 sq mi (644,329 sq km). Population: (2024 est.) 15,254,000. Capital: Juba. Languages: English (official working language), indigenous languages, Arabic. Religions: Christianity, traditional beliefs, Islam. Currency: South Sudan pound. It has rainforests and savannas but is dominated by the vast Al-Sudd swamp, located in its centre. A rich variety of wildlife includes lions, elephants, and gazelles. The Nile River flows through the entire length of the country. South Sudan’s economy is primarily dependent on oil and agriculture. The chief crops are sorghum and peanuts, and petroleum is the main export. South Sudan has a transitional government with two legislative bodies; its head of state and government is the president. Settled by many of its current ethnic groups during the 15th–19th centuries, it has long been associated with Sudan, its neighbour to the north, despite the fact that Islam and the Arabic language tended to dominate in the north while older African languages and cultures were predominant in the south. By the end of the 19th century, both the north and the south—collectively considered the Sudan—were under British-Egyptian colonial rule. The existing differences between the two regions, exacerbated by the disparate level of development that occurred under colonial administration, made it difficult for Sudan to be effectively ruled as one country upon achieving independence in 1956. Fears of marginalization of the south by the north led to a civil war that began in 1955, months prior to actual independence. The initial conflict and the fears that fueled it were inflamed by northern leaders who hoped to impose unity upon the nascent country by imposing Islamic law and culture throughout north and south. Fighting subsided with the 1972 Addis Ababa Agreement but resumed in 1983 and continued until 2005, when the Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed. The agreement fostered a tenuous peace between the north and the south and granted southern Sudan semiautonomous status and the promise of a referendum on independence to be held in six years. The vote took place in January 2011 and was almost unanimous in supporting independence. The country of South Sudan was declared on July 9, 2011. The new country descended into civil conflict in December 2013. An August 2015 peace agreement that provided for a transitional unity government was meant to end the conflict, but fighting continued. The transitional unity government was eventually formed in April 2016."
