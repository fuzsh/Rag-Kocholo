Drivers of the crisis include political instability following the military takeover on 25 October 2021 and the onset of conflict on 15 April 2023, a socioeconomic crisis characterised by high inflation rates and currency depreciation, and food insecurity affecting at least a quarter of the population, projected to further deteriorate.\n\nAs at February 2024, the recent conflict in April had displaced more than 9 million people inside Sudan and 1.7 million people to neighbouring countries, mainly Chad, Egypt, Ethiopia, and South Sudan. Intercommunal clashes and violence in some areas of the country, mostly in Darfur and Kordofan regions, also contribute to the high numbers of internal and cross-border displacements.\n\nThe flood season usually affects Sudan between June–September, driving displacement and increasing humanitarian needs. There are nearly 962,000 refugees in Sudan as at 31 December 2023. The conflict between SAF and RSF has affected these refugees.
