        "text": "Author(s): Mayen Achiek, FRCS and Dario Lado, MD (Surg)\n\nMA is a Clinical Fellow, Colorectal Surgery, King’s College Hospital, Denmark Hill, London; DL is a Surgeon, Juba Teaching Hospital. Currently Specialist Registrar in Urology, North Middlesex Hospital, London.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe basic hospital package of care service (BHPCS)1, commissioned by the Department of Curative Medicine in the Government of Southern Sudan (GOSS) and written by specialists of the St Mary’s Hospital–Juba Teaching Hospital Link in January 2010, identified a severe lack of doctors at specialist level. It recommends that the minimum requirements of specialists at each of the three main hospitals in South Sudan over the next five years are: medicine 6, surgery 3, orthopaedics 2, urology 1, paediatrics 6, obstetrics and gynaecology 6, anaesthesia 4, ophthalmology 4, head and neck surgery 4, emergency medicine 2, radiology 2 - 4, pathology 4, oncology 2 and psychiatry 4. These numbers (i.e.150-156) would enable sub-specialisation and provide the training needed to produce more specialists. This may take longer to achieve at Wau and Malakal due to insufficiently developed infrastructure.\n\nIt is estimated that there are approximately 500 Southern Sudanese doctors with basic medical degrees but without postgraduate training. Most of these doctors work either in private practice or undertake administrative posts with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in South or North Sudan.\n\nThere is no structured postgraduate programme or continuing professional development (CPD) system, into which doctors may slot in order to pursue a programme of training in Southern Sudan. Until there is a structured system with enough trainers in place, South Sudan will struggle for years to offer specialist services to its people. Such services are currently available at great cost (e.g. approximately $25,000 per person) from neighbouring African countries, South Africa, Jordan, Egypt, the United Kingdom, and occasionally, the United States and India. This referral service is not available to emergencies as most people with acute illnesses die within the first twenty-four hours2.\n\nIn the absence of concrete data on the numbers of trained doctors (those who have undergone postgraduate or accredited training in a speciality), we (MA & DL) set out to establish the numbers of trained doctors in various specialities in South Sudan, North Sudan, East and Central Africa, Australia, Canada, United States, United Kingdom, Ireland and Scandinavia.\n\nThe aim of this study is to identify those doctors who may be interested to act as trainers in a training programme for postgraduate doctors in medicine in South Sudan. It is vital that a critical mass of trainers is in place to start structured postgraduate training to ensure self-sufficiency in trained medical manpower.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe checked the names of South Sudanese doctors in the Sudan Medical Council Register, the General Medical Council Register in the United Kingdom, Sudanese Surgeons’ Association Register, Sudanese Society of Physicians’ Register and the Kenyan Medical Council Register. We also personally communicated with colleagues in countries where South Sudanese doctors work.\n\nWe recorded only postgraduate qualifications and the relevant speciality but excluded personal data for confidentiality. Where we communicated by telephone or email, we obtained verbal consent to use the information. It will not be possible to trace individual identities using the data we present in this paper.\n\nResults\n\nWe identified 80 trained specialists from South Sudan in different specialities. Figure 1 shows the distribution by speciality: surgery has the highest number 26, followed by obstetrics and gynaecology 19, general medicine 18, paediatrics and child health 6, radiology 3, pathology 3, psychiatry 3 and dermatology and anaesthesia 1 each. Of these 65 are currently active and 15 are retired or near retirement but in private practice.\n\nFigure 1.

For example the public health specialists and dentists have not been counted but should be included.\n\nFor a population of 10,000,000 people, the number of specialists from South Sudan working there is negligible and does not meet the WHO minimum standard of 20 doctors per 100,000 inhabitants3. However the WHO minimum standard does not differentiate between trained and untrained doctors. It is estimated that there are 500 South Sudanese doctors living within South Sudan with basic medical degrees but without appropriate postgraduate training.\n\nWe propose that the government of Southern Sudan introduce structured postgraduate training in hospitals in Wau, Malakal and Juba. This should give initial training in South Sudan with top-up experience in developed western countries prior to the doctors returning home to offer ongoing specialist services.\n\nWe also propose that, because there is severe shortage of trainers, specialist doctors of South Sudan origin working outside the country offer some of their time to train colleagues in South Sudan in order to kick start the training programme. The government of Southern Sudan needs to offer incentives to trained doctors to enable them to remain in the country. Schemes by the United Kingdom Department for International Development that supplement salaries of healthcare professionals in Malawi in order to encourage retention4 needs to be looked at as soon as possible. NGOs should incorporate training into their contracts when employing medically qualified personnel to ensure that they continue professional development and increase the critical mass of trained doctors in Southern Sudan.\n\nWe suggest that a three-day conference be held of all the above specialists and the authorities in the GOSS Ministry of Health so that we can start to develop a framework for improving our national Healthcare Service.\n\nReferences\n\nBasic Hospital Package of Care Service (BHPCS) January 2010.
