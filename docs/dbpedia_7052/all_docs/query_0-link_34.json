The first collection of this kind - Screen 1964 - was printed edition of 45,500 copies. The circulation of the next two collections were 30-35 thousand copies. From 1968 to 1985 the Screens were annually with a circulation of 50 thousand copies. Screen 1987 circulation has been increased to 75 thousand, but the rest of the collection issues have returned to the circulation of 50 thousand copies. Each book is illustrated with black-and-white frames of the movies and photos masters of the screen.\n\nHowever, based on the stated theme, our analysis is limited to only articles about Soviet feature films (Such collection had 15-20 about). I have not analyzed: 1) interviews; 2) reports from film sets; 3) articles written not by film critics; 4)\n\narticles about the documentary, animation and foreign films (how foreign cinema was reflected in the mirror of the Soviet critics, please, see: Fedorov, 2016).\n\nSo, these Yearbooks published (from 1965 to 1990) over four hundred articles on the Soviet cinema.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nThe main materials for this article was articles of Soviet film critics about Soviet cinema. The methods of theoretical research: classification, comparison, analogy, induction and deduction, abstraction and concretization, theoretical analysis and synthesis; methods of empirical research: collecting information related to the research subjects. The effectiveness of such methods has been proven as the Western (R. Taylor, D. Youngblood, A. Lawton et al.), and Russian (N. Zorkaya, M. Turovskaya) researchers. I used also the method of hermeneutic analysis of the cultural context of media texts [Eco, 1976; Silverblatt, 2001].\n\nDiscussion\n\nScreen 1964 (published in 1965, put a set in April 1965)\n\nThe first issue of the yearbook' collection - Screen 1964 - was distinctly \"thaw\", although its materials, of course, influenced the guiding line of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee Resolutions: \"On measures to improve the management of the art of cinematography development\" (1962), \"Immediate Tasks party's ideological work\" (1963) and \"On the \"Mosfilm\" (1964). The latter document, for example, said that filmmakers should \"produce movies that reveal the Soviet way of thinking and acting, the Soviet way of life; recreate on screen the story of the struggle of the Communist Party and the Soviet people for the victory of socialism and communism in our country; produce films, exposing the bourgeois way of life, to help the party in its struggle for the triumph of communist ideology\" [Resolution..., 1964].\n\nHowever, Screen 1964 in general looked quite balanced despite all these Resolutions: the materials of the Soviet cinema combined with a large, saturated section of foreign films, festivals and stars, and even with the polemical articles.\n\nFor example, very noticeable at the time critics E. Surkov and M. Kuznetsov were the authors of reviews about the film Chairman by Y. Nagibin and A. Saltykov. Actor Mikhail Ulyanov very imressive played the role of Trubnikov -the chairman of one of the post-war collective farms. And E. Surkov (1915-1988) claimed that \"those who conceders Trubnikov on the ideal of modern standards of the collective farm manager, is unlikely to do the right thing. ... In order to understand Trubnikov, we must not forget that he is a man, not some ideal personification of some abstractly formulated virtues\" [Surkov, 1965, p. 36].\n\nM. Kuznetsov (1914-1980) to argue with positive view of E. Surkov: \"It is very difficult to understand how such a talented writer as Y. Nagibin ... have lost\n\n214\n\nall sense of proportion, and gave himself entirely to the power of the illustrative flow? And why is the young director Alexey Saltykov, whose work is very rough, but sometimes shows a clear talent, too, succumbed to this?\" [Kuznetsov, 1965, p. 42].\n\nHere I must say that have not been yet untouchable Soviet \"cinematic generals\" with untouchable \"state significant topics\" in the 1960s. Therefore, it was possible (of course, within the ruling ideology) relatively freely express their opinions. So E. Surkov, even positively assessed Chairman, noting that \"the first part of the film is especially good, solid and perfected, but the second part, unfortunately, is not so equivalent. Especially towards the end of the film when the director and screenwriter, wanting to show the changes that have occurred on the farm, do it purely illustrative externally. ... I felt in the final episode of the film even some complacency, as if the authors would have us believe then that all the problems now resolved\" [Surkov, 1965, pp. 38-39].\n\nM. Semenov's article about the film Space Alloy by the future \"cinematic general of era of stagnation\" T. Levchuk (1912-1998) was very caustic and (rightly so!) absolutely ruthless: \"The appearance of the film was preceded by broadcast advertising. It was emphasized that it is not a simple cinematographic, it is a plan of how the hymn \"glorious working class.\" But we can see instead the weak song, even with fake notes. ... No real life, not living people. Instead, we meet with mannequins\" [Semenov, 1965, pp. 66-67, 71].\n\nProbably, the title The Regional Secretary of Communist Party would be a strong anti-critical indulgence for any film, even the lowest professional level in the 1970s - the first half of the 1980s. But at the beginning of the Brezhnev's era, \"the party-ideological\" title and topic has not been saved opportunistic opus by V. Chebotarev (1921-2010) from the just verdict of V. Kardin (1921-2008). This critic accused this film in the absence of the real life's traces [Kardin, 1965, pp. 6972].\n\nThe yearbook scolded (and again - for good reason) and movies on the so-called historical-revolutionary theme. For example, K. Scherbakov ironically remarked that films Mandate and In the Name of Revolution exploit the \"moves and situations, images and techniques of expression, which are now, repeating many times, become empty, jaded, commonplace. ... I am far from being able to accuse the authors of Mandate and In the Name of Revolution of plagiarism ... But the lack of their own vision of art sometimes brings such bitter fruit, which does not know and direct borrowing\" [Shcherbakov, 1965, pp. 86-87].\n\nIt is curious that, thanks to the \"thaw\", the critic J. Warsawsky (1911-2000) was still able to tell the yearbook the readers even that film I am 20 years has undergone alterations and, therefore, did not immediately came out on the screen: \"I've seen all the options this film, and the early and final. What is the essence of reshoots? ... Of course, as always with the alterations do not guard themselves against losses, more or less offensive. Perhaps the most annoying is too cut scene performances of poets at the Polytechnic Museum\" (Warsawsky, 1965, p. 45).\n\n215\n\nAnalyzing this film of M. Khutsiev, film critic used fairly typical for the 1960s protective method: a reference to the faithfulness of goodies \"light Leninist ideals\" [Warsawsky, 1965, p. 50].\n\nHowever, realizing that even this ideological link, perhaps, not at all will make an impression, J. Warsawsky completed his article one more polemical thesis: \"You do not agree with me, dear reader? Let us not rush to conclusions, let's see it again, make sure what impact it on our young cinema, on the minds of a new generation of artists and audiences. This film has slow, but powerful steps\" [Warsawsky, 1965, p. 52].\n\nAnd J. Warsawsky, as time has shown, proved to be completely right: M. Khutsiev's talented film, in fact, turned out to be \"long-playing\", designed for decades of thinking about the thaw era...\n\nBright and figuratively review was written by N. Zorkaya (1924-2006) about the satirical comedy by E. Klimov Welcome, or No Trespassing. N. Zorkaya reasonably argued that many of the \"troubles come from dogmatism and lack of talent, who are always together and prop each other, although apparently not similar, although dogmatism important inflated, pretends to be a scientist... The film Welcome, or No Trespassing is talented, cheerful and mischievous work of like-minded artists. ... Professional hand, precise installation, master's sense of material: it's all there in Klimov's film\" [Zorkaya, 1965, pp. 52-55].\n\nM. Kvasnetskaya (1925-2008) wrote a good review about Competition: \"This film is not only creative debut of young director B. Mansurov, and the approval of his peculiar talent - clever and poetic\" [Kvasnetskaya, 1965, p. 63]. And I. Levshina (1932-2009) was convinced that Competition is not only deserves accolades, but this film is so rich and complex, so difficult for the viewer's perception that the conversation about him should go to some fundamental questions. I saw in the Competition deeply national cinema\" [Levshina, 1965, pp. 60-61].\n\nM. Kuznetsov wrote very warm and shrewdly article about the directorial film debut of V. Shukshin This Guy Lives: \"Not all perfect in this film, there is something to reproach not only actors, but above all the author, even reproach, but from all admiring heart. However, this uneven film has an amazing, rare integrity, and in addition, V. Shukshin achieved victory in such a difficult area as the problem of the hero. ... That's why this debut is not only successful itself, but promises even more in the future. I think not mistaken to predict that we will happy to meet V. Shukshin and on the pages of magazines and books, and in the cinema\" [Kuznetsov, 1965, pp. 137, 142].\n\nThe next section of the book dealt with the creative portraits of filmmakers.\n\nFor example, I. Solovyova wrote that \"Smoktunovsky's play in Hamlet leaves a wonderful feeling: it seems that the role is changing from time to time, as it can not be changed in the movie, and as happens only in the theater\" [Solovieva, 1965, p. 99].\n\nPerhaps the only discordant note in a very successful book, was the boring article of D. Pisarevsky (1912-1990), the chief editor of Soviet Screen magazine, who wrote that Vasilyev brothers' Chapaev \"is one of pictures-titans, in which each new generation of viewers and artists draws spiritual riches and opens its consonant with time. He became part of the lives of the people, a true companion generations\" [Pisarevsky, 1965, p. 219].\n\nScreen 1965 (published in 1966, put in a set in October 1966)\n\nThe well-known film critic M. Bleyman (1904-1973) published in 1970 the article Archaists or innovators? (Bleyman, 1970), which served as a pretext for Soviet film bosses defeat of Ukrainian poetic cinema. But Screen 1965 could still to publish a positive article about the film S. Parajanov (1924-1990) Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors. This masterpiece was evaluated as \"explosion of many canons, disturbing many hardened tastes and concepts. And so I want to believe that this is not a coincidence, but a brilliant beginning of a new stage in the life of Ukrainian cinema. ... Talent director Parajanov finally found their true value, slipped to a truly artistic expression. It seems that reel of film will not sustain such a frenzied pressure of the director/operator' fantasy, but this is artistic revelationin. ... Director of Photography Y. Ilienko deserves the highest praise for the highest measure accurate, ubiquitous, bottomless ingenuity. Union of director and cameraman in this film is so indivisible that it is difficult to imagine a more \"ground-in\" in modern cinema\" [Drach, 1966, pp. 29, 32].\n\nA number of books' articles was devoted to the poetic cinema. Critics pointed out that in V. Derbenev's Last Month of Autumn \"reigns light lyrical intonation and it is all full of poetry\" [Ignatieva, 1966, p. 52], and Girl and the Echo has a different artistic purpose than preaching: be able to see the world grow a purity and transparency of the soul, and then everything will open and you will respond ... The film does not proclaim anything, but this is a miracle of poetry\" [Inovertseva, 1966, p. 35]. And the article's title about poetic parable M. Kobakhidze The Wedding was, in fact, an exhaustive: Small Masterpiece [Semenov, 1966, pp. 138-139].\n\nThis, of course, does not mean that the annual book automatically Screens the poetic cinema of critics zone. For example, I. Rubanova rather sternly wrote about the debut work of B. Grigoriev (1935-2012) and Y. Shvyrev (1932-2013) First Snow and the Clean Ponds by A. Sakharov (1934-1999) [Rubanova 1966, p. 68].\n\nAnd Z. Paperny (1919-1996) was not thrilled with the movie of A. Manasarova (1925-1986) Twenty Years Later: \"A good picture, a professional job. Just an example of a purely \"cinematic\" movie, which says on its \"brutal\" language, not only listening to the language of the writer\" [Paperny, 1966, p. 117].\n\nThe polemic yearbook's section included the debate about the comedy genre. B. Medvedev (1920-1969) did not skimp on praise for the comedy of\n\n217\n\nK.Voinov (1918-1995) Bal'zaminov's Marriage, admitting that his \"dream-pantomime conquered, drew courage director\" (Medvedev, 1966, p. 95). E. Kholodov (1915-1981) forcefully argued with him, regretting that \"fine man replaced by the movie theme of the little man\" [Kholodov, 1966, p. 97].\n\nThe satirical comedy 33 displeased Soviet cinema officials. But T. Khloplyankina not afraid to speak out in defense of thes comedy: \"This is a film that is the first time in many years, does not hesitate to be a satire and does not apologize for the fact that this is a satire. Negative characters in it much more than positive... It is very sharp and angry film, but where and when satire have been good? It is, finally, a film that boldly uses hyperbole, exaggeration, but where and when the satire of rejected it?\" [Khloplyankina, 1966, p. 105].\n\nShe also highly appreciated the eccentric comedy of Leonid Gaidai (19231993) Operation 'Y': \"Comedy seemed to be shook off the fatigue acquired during the years sitting in a society uninteresting people. . It can revive old and show a cascade of mind-blowing tricks, but it is oriented perfectly in modern interiors. It is capable of equipping their goodies uncanny ease and ruthlessly confound negative, but both of them did not seem to us conditional figures\" [Khloplyankina 1966, p. 100].\n\nAnother well-known film critic G. Kremlev (1905-1975) was fully agree with T. Khloplyankina: \"In order to put the comedy, and even more so - the comic, not enough to be a good director, you must have a special calling. But this is not enough. It was necessary to have the quality of a religious fanatic, martyr. All these qualities are happily combined in Leonid Gaidai\" [Kremlev 1966, pp. 109-110].\n\nV. Orlov devoted his article to comedies Give Me a Complaints Book and Sleeping Lion, rightly arguing that \"the everyday life presents new conflicts and new clothes evil. But these comedies are still struggling with the cartoons in gabardine raincoats\" [Orlov, 1966, p. 114].\n\nArticles of I. Lishchinsky and G. Kapralov (1921-2010) were about the film by G. Kalatozov (1903-1973) and S. Urusevsky (1908-1974) I am Cuba. I. Lishchinsky noted that \"the camera in the hands of Urusevsky free and is animated. She took from the operator of his impetuosity, his emotion, his impulse. The viewer taken away immutable point of view of the observer. The camera leads him along. Every second frame can enter something new and unexpected. The audience watching the movie in the rhythm of the film. The audience must be active for the movies of Kalatozov & Urusevsky\" [Lishchinsky, 1966, p. 80].\n\nBut the opinion of G. Kapralov was much more restrained: \"I remember the previous film of Mikhail Kalatozov and Sergey Urusevsky - Unsent Letter. The criticism, polemics around the movie ultimately correct answer to the question why such a remarkable direction with which we met in some episodes of this work, and a brilliant cinematography, which marked virtually every frame, suddenly triggered largely in vain: the film there was no real drama. And in the new Kalatozov & Urusevsky' work we see the same error... It is very disappointing for me that I am\n\nCuba with all brilliant fireworks skill did not work in the artistic scale, which of it was to be expected\" [Kapralov, 1966, pp. 82, 84].\n\nIt seems that these two views are quite representative of the perception of I am Cuba, not only for film critics but the ordinary audience: today this movie is also controversial...\n\nIt is interesting today to read the discussion of the O. Efremov's long-forgotten drama Build Bridge. I. Levshina considered that \"theater has come to the cinema not for that, to show filmmakers how to make movies. The theater went to the cinema to get a platform to express their beliefs, and brought with them a culture of its theatrical thinking. With its artistic and civil credo, his method of thinking, you can agree or disagree, but to ignore them you cannot\" (Levshina, 1966). And this is more convincing opinion of B. Kardin: \"I do not think that the authors of the film Build Bridge consciously wanted to refurbish old plot... leaning on life, they missed something in life\" [Kardin, 1966, p. 90].\n\nThe Screen 1965 published an interview with A. Tarkovsky (1932-1986) on the set of Andrei Rublev. This film for several years has been put \"on the shelf\". But this interview was possible in 1965...\n\nYaerbook published also the article about A. Konchalovsky's The First Teacher. N. Lordkipanidze (1925-2014) wrote that it is \"difficult due to the complexity of the organic material. And sometimes deliberately hindered by virtue of congestion symbolic imagery. ... It has all the luxuries debut, perseverance in the \"statement of self\", coming from the fear of being trivial. But the film is serious in the main. And it is indeed the new artist coming into the art\" [Lordkipanidze 1966, p. 137].\n\nD. Pisarevsky's assessment was basically positive about the drama Hello, It's Me! By F. Dovlatyan (1927-1997): \"Can be heard accusations of unreliability of certain episodes. To some extent they are valid. But this is not important, because the whole movie is a bold exploration of modern theme. It's real art. Truthful, intelligent, emotional\" [Pisarevsky, 1966, p. 140].\n\nAnd as usual, the Yearbook presents readers benevolent portraits of Russian filmmakers: A. Volodin [Warsawsky, 1966, pp. 124-132], I. Lapikov [Zelenko, 1966, pp. 56-58], V. Receptor [Kolesnikova, 1966, pp. 144-145], and others.\n\nScreen 1966-1967 (1967, put in a set in April 1967)\n\nXXIII Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, held in March and April 1966, did not have a noticeable effect on the content of Screen 1966-1967: a time when the yearbook will publish articles officious critics, interspersed with quotations from the speeches at Communist party congresses, it was yet to come...\n\nBut an unprecedented event was in the life of Soviet critics in the late 1966: forty of them were sent a questionnaire, which were asked to choose: the best\n\nSoviet film, director, cameraman, actress, actor in 1966 [Screen 1966-1967, pp. 1215].\n\nHere is the list of these film critics: L. Anninsky, M. Augstkali, V. Baskakov (1921-1999), T. Bachelis (1918-1999), L. Belova (1921-1986), M. Bleyman (1904-1973), V. Bozhovich , I. Weissefeld (1909-2003), A. Vartanov, J.

Apparently, someone \"above\" thought that the opinions of film critics and film experts can very clearly be different from the preferences of the authorities and the \"choice of the masses\"... And further questioning of Soviet film critics were forbidden until the era of \"perestroika\", when in the second half of 1980 the newspaper Week dared to publish a table, where the leading film critics exhibited \"star\" for movie current repertoire.\n\nBut the polemical Yearbook's section still existed some years. And in the Screen 1966-1967 film critics argued about the films Your Son and Brother by V. Shukshin (1929-1974) and Long and Happy Life by G. Shpalikov (1937-1974).\n\nL. Anninsky with his usual deep insight into film context wrote that \"cinema has revealed in the works of Shukshin deep moral theme running through all that it does. Shukshin's cinema has made clear to us the psychological and stylistic opening pertaining to our general psychological condition\" [Anninsky 1967, p. 102].\n\nBut this does not convince experienced polemicist N. Klado (1909-1990). He cautiously admitted: \"The world of the village depicted in this film, for me, is terrible. After all, Vera is the brightest in the village. But she was silent. She can not tell people. She did not want to hear\" [Klado 1967, p. 100].\n\nI. Levshina's article about the film Long and Happy Life was no less controversial. This article began with a sudden sharp outburst against the very popular lyrical comedy Walking the Streets of Moscow: \"I do not like this film (by director G. Danelia and screen writer G. Shpalikov. I do not like mainly due Shpalikov, because of the fact that the playwright, making the demonstration of his creative manner, and the film builds narcotic pagan sense of thoughtlessness as the standard of happiness ... I feel closer to Shpalikov \"Happy Life\", because here he grows up. He thinks in his manner, not giving a succinct breakdown. I support the idea that the viewer is invited to think, and as often as possible\" [Levshina 1967, p. 111].\n\nWell, film critic not only rejects the \"cult\" thaw masterpiece Walking the Streets of Moscow, but also openly urged to think - filmmakers and the audience! I suppose, such film critic passage is almost impossible in the Soviet press in the 1970s - the first half of 1980s...\n\nJ. Warsawsky argued I. Levshina, because he (as, indeed, many of the Soviet viewers) frankly did not like \"Antonioni's style of Long and Happy Life: \"But if it's a comedy, why the screen is so boring? And because the 'comedy of errors' occurred with the author. He did not understand that he wrote. And as a director, introduced in the film boring gravitas. ... Imaginary poetic form are now often penalized for shield contacts with the audience\" [Warsawsky, 1967, pp. 110111].\n\nM. Bleyman (1904-1973), in fact, completely joined Warsawsky's opinion: \"Mery capable writer G. Shpalikov directed the film Long and Happy Life. This is a story about how a person loses his happiness as he was afraid of it. This is a simple story and simple, even an elementary idea. But he wore a surprisingly meaningful form, in the form of an abstract, which lost for the living subjects of our time, live data\" [Bleyman 1967, p. 168].\n\nI. Lishchinsky actually continued Bleyman's reasoning, choosing, however, a different target - a film lyric Two by M. Bogin: \"Simulation of modernity is not the only function of cinema Art Nouveau. ... \"Modern\" style tasked to facilitate people's lives, to heal the wounds. ... The drama is absorbed by the comfort of the Riga cafes, light music and tasteful clothing\" [Lishchinsky, 1967, p. 172].\n\nToday Lishchinsky's opinion seems the archaism of 'socialist logic': if a love story has been shown not in a cozy European Riga, but somewhere in the Russian provincial town, then, of course this story will be good...\n\nGoing from author cinema to cinema genre, the compilers of the Yearbook once again turned to comedy. Here E. Bauman wrote that \"movies with the duty bureaucrats would not want to give his position on the screen. They immerse the viewer in the atmosphere of his fictional life, they create their own, special world, frozen in depressing immutability. And this artificially film comedies have bad taste, vulgarity and feigned cheerfulness... Yes, stereotypes coming from the film to film... They do not want to go and liberate places. And yet the breath of life bursts into the comedy genre, destroying stamps, sweeping circuit. Proof of this is talented, intelligent and funny comedy Adventures of a Dentist, 33, Beware of the Car\" [Bauman 1967, pp. 173, 175].\n\nK. Shcherbakov wrote the article about the weaknesses of Soviet film detectives. In particular, he correctly noted that Game Without a Draw, \"has foreign spies, which look too obviously foreigners and spies. Soviet colonel, talking with his subordinates as if teaches classes at a school for disabled children. ... And execution of an innocent twist in the film is regarded as a moral failure, which to treason at hand\" [Shcherbakov, 1967, p. 177].\n\nAt the same time, keeping in mind the relevant guidelines of Soviet Party Resolutions, K. Shcherbakov not forget to link the arguments with ideological struggle on the screen: \"Of course, the tasks of Soviet detective and detective bourgeois are fundamentally different. But why do we often put up with the fact that the bourgeois detective better fulfills its objectives, than our, Soviet\" [Shcherbakov, 1967, p. 176].\n\nIn this regard, M. Bleyman thinking about stereotypes entertainment genres highlighted \"detectives in which incredibly insightful scouts can easily cope with the incredibly clumsy spies, and comedy, in which the characters behave so stupidly that is lost even a minimum standard of compliance to the real characters. I will not list these movies. The fact that they are stereotypes, do not need to explain. This can be seen with the naked eye. Stereotype helpful and offers turnkey solutions, when the artist is not able to analyze the complex phenomenon of life. Stereotype insinuating, he invades the work unnoticed, when the artist is not fully aware of his purpose. Stereotype helpful and easily pretend to be art. ... But one thing is clear: the basis of the stereotype is the laziness of the artist, the inability or unwillingness to think about the vital phenomena that he describes and analyze\" [Bleyman 1967, pp.169-170]. N. Lordkipanidze (1925-2014): also wrote about annoying clichés [Lordkipanidze 1967, p. 181].\n\nMany of the authors of the yearbook were unhappy and current adaptations of Russian classics.\n\nS. Rassadin (1935-2012) wrote with all critical rigor about comedy Uncle's Dream by K.Voinov (1918-1995), because this is the simple vaudeville, but not Dostoevsky's world [Rassadin, 1967, p. 191].\n\nAnd then the critic moved to, alas, then forbidden bitter satire Nasty Anecdote by A. Alov (1923-1983) and V. Naumov: \"The authors do not play with the audience in the giveaway, their unexpected, inexhaustible, very talented means of expression designed for learning. And the authors do not always take into account the possibility of our perception. Even experienced. And we can not drink the pure essence, and it would be desirable solution. Overloaded ... Film and symbols are algebra art. This excessive algebraization pointedly, appealing to reason rather than to the heart, leading to harsh rationalistic\" [Rassadin, 1967, p. 192].\n\nAnalyzing The Tale of Tsar Saltan M. Dolinsky and S. Chertok noted with regret that, \"how far A. Ptushko's film of tales by A. Pushkin. Pushkin's incompatible ease, swiftness of his verse, the perfect simplicity of shape, finally, the logic of creative thinking are absolutely not suitable for heavy-handedness of film design\" [Dolinsky, Chertok, 1967, p. 208].\n\nA. Dubrovin was very critical of the film adaptation of A Hero of Our Time by S. Rostotsky (1922-2001): \"This film there are shots under the naturalism and 'modern'... As a result, the film disappeared Lermontov's intelligence, Lermontov's pain, Lermontov's depth\" [Dubrovin, 1967, p. 203].\n\nV. Ivanova (1937-2008) was dissatisfied with the screen adaptations of A. Tolstoy's Viper by V. Ivchenko (1912-1972) [Ivanova, 1967, p. 200]. Equally negative she said about Hyperboloid of Engineer Garin by A. Ginzburg (19071972): \"We saw an amazing meticulousness in his dull spectacle. ... Something from A. Tolstoy's scathing sarcasm shone only in the final for a moment. Peeped out and ... And in the hall light went on\"[Ivanova, 1967, pp. 199-200].\n\nUnfortunately, V. Ivanova apparently did not notice the exquisite visual solution of black and white of this film adaptation of Hyperboloid of Engineer Garin (1965), made in the spirit of film noir: the play with light and shade line in night scenes and contrasting extremes of black and white in the daytime scenes and the use of wide-angle lens, unusual camera angles, etc. I believe that the director A. Ginzburg, a former cameraman, deliberately put such a task before the talented cameraman A. Rybin (1935-2016). The visual style of the film was also a dynamic-nervous, the music is sometimes ironic. I think that the jury of the International Festival of Fantasy Films in Trieste (1966) was primarily evaluated these audiovisual solutions and originality and awarded the film A. Ginzburg main prize...\n\nG. Kapralov presented maybe the most positive article about current adaptations of this time. Assessing the Daily Stars by I. Talankin, is based on the diaries of O. Bergholz, G. Kapralov wrote: \"I predict that the ratio of this film will be contradictory. It has reticence and infringement of proportions. Comparison with 'open diary' with the richness of his thought and association gives one more reason for criticism. But I think the director, who is also the author of the script, had a right to their reading of the book, its subject, and what he said, it is said with piercing force\" [Kapralov, 1967, p. 20].\n\nOf course, analyzing the current repertoire, authors of Screen 1966-1967 could not get past the films lead the aforementioned film critics' rating. Wings, The First Teacher, Nobody Wanted to Die received a positive evaluations [Warsawsky, 1967, p. 24; Zinoviev, Markov, 1967, pp. 74-78; Pisarevsky, 1967, pp. 66-68].\n\nFor example, J. Warsawsky, reflecting on the drama Wings, wrote: \"Larisa Shepitko came to an early mastery. Each frame of the film in its subordinate thoughts, develops the idea. It reminds us that the art director is primarily a thought...\" [Warsawsky, 1967, p. 24].\n\nScreen 1967-1968 (1968, put in a set in March 1968)\n\nThe Resolution of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee \"On measures for further development of the social sciences and enhance their role in the building of communism\" [Resolution..., 1967] full of standard phrases about the need to \"increase\" and \"strengthen\"... But pathetic celebration of the 50th anniversary of the 1917 revolution was the most important political event in the USSR preceding the release of Screen 1967-1968.\n\nYearbook Screen 1967-1968 was put in a set in March 1968, i.e. a few months before the August invasion of Soviet troops in Czechoslovakia. But the \"Prague Spring\" is already in full flourish democratic hopes... And these hopes, I think, were the key to change the structure of the yearbook. Rigid administrative arm discarded any film critics' ratings, but gave way for ideologized materials.\n\nFor example, D. Pisarevsky stacked enthusiastic ode to the restored version of the film October (1927): \"No, this film is not old, not lost the explosive power of this revolutionary art fiery epic! ... October sings the glory of victorious working class people and Leninist party\" [Pisarevsky, 1968, pp.19-20]. And then D. Pisarevsky snobbish glorified \"panorama of national heroism\" in the \"historical and revolutionary\" film Iron Stream by E. Dzigan (1998-1981) [Pisarevsky, 1968, p. 23].\n\nJubilee Yearbook, of course, could not pass films about Lenin. V. Baskakov highlighted the \"talent embodied the image of the genius of the revolution\" [Baskakov, 1968, p.72] in the film Lenin in Poland by S. Yutkevich (1904-1985).\n\nBut in general, the compilers of the Yearbook still managed to keep film studies level and published, for example, of two wonderful articles of L. Anninsky.\n\nIn his review of the film G. Poloka (1930-2014) The Republic of SHKID L. Anninsky accurately wrote that \"the theme of the film is Chekhov's character, a man of the XIX century, an intellectual and humanist, caught in a situation of Sodom and Gomorrah. ... Old-fashioned competition, defenseless Culture with a young and ingenuous naivete takes ruthless nature of mutual mystification\" [Anninsky, 1968, p. 55].\n\nL. Anninsky wrote a significant article about M. Khutsiev's masterpiece July Rain. The critic asked a very sharp at the time the question: \"M. Khutsiev listen to the rhythm of the modern soul at the decisive moment of choice. The artist talks about spiritual culture, trust, humanity. ... In essence, Khutsiev continues the meditation, which was first performed in the movie I am 20 years old. But now with a little more alert. Why?\" [Anninsky, 1968, p. 34].\n\nL. Anninsky, of course, could not to answer this question directly, indicating director's feeling of 'thaw's collapse, for censorship reasons. Therefore, instead of a direct answer last sentence of Anninsky's review was truly a model of allegory [Anninsky, 1968, p. 34]...\n\nS. Freilich (1920-2005) published a positive review about Your Contemporary by Y. Raisman (1903-1994): \"This film it is a real battle, opponents do not play in the giveaway, there are broken destinies of people\" [Freilich, 1968, p. 14].\n\nYearbook continued support of poetic cinema. I. Lishchinsky wrote about Umbrella by M. Kobakhidze that \"the Georgian cinema is rich in young talent. In this ensemble M. Kobakhidze has original voice and its own melody: mocking, ironic, a little sad, but it is clearly distinguishable, and it is necessary to listen\" [Lishchinsky, 1968, p. 63]. N. Lordkipanidze generally supported the poetic debut of E. Ishmuhamedov - Tenderness: \"The picture is made with obvious, undisguised focus on people susceptible - and mentally, and artistically. If this susceptibility is not, you probably will be bored\" [Lordkipanidze, 1968, p. 61].\n\nM. Bleyman's article about an eccentric in a movie (Beware of the Car, Operation 'Y',\" Prisoner of the Caucasus, 33) [Bleyman 1967, pp. 80-82] looks boring and banal today. But the article by Revich (1929-1997) on the fantasy genre\n\n225\n\n[Revich, 1967, pp. 82-86], in my opinion, has not lost a polemical fervor. Box office champion and audience favorite, Amphibian Man by G. Kazansky (1910-1983) and V. Chebotarev (1921-2010) was the first critic's object for attack: \"What about a A. Belyaev's novel? This is about tragedy of disillusionment in the society of businessmen and shopkeepers. What are the ideas of the film? Political kept to a depressing straightness, and the art became a melodramatic love triangle and tasteless Ichthyander-Tarzan walks on the roofs\" [Revich, 1968, p. 83].\n\nHere it is the typical anti-genre approach of ideologically socialist orientated critics, when Soviet criticism demanded a class-political conclusions from exotic folk and fairy tales, mixed with the bright melodramatic stories. As D. Gorelov correctly noted that Amphibian Man became \"the first post-Stalin era super-blockbuster. ... A competent producer could see that ocean of gold ... But Chebotarev & Kazansky were in the wild, ugly, ruthless world of freedom, equality and fraternity, where financial profit meant nothing... Critics scolded them for their lightness and attraction... Soviet Screen Journal for the first time blatantly falsified the results of the annual reader's opinions, giving primacy gray and long since dead drama ...\" [Gorelov, 2001].\n\nV. Revich addressed all the same working class and political reproach to Hyperboloid of Engineer Garin by A. Ginzburg: \"the novels' most powerful scientific, and social aspect is the mechanics of bourgeois relations, speculation, capitalist economy and morality. But the social side completely dropped out of the detective movie\" [Revich, 1968, p. 83].\n\nV. Revich buckled the theme of the ideological confrontation with the West and in the article about the film Mysterious Wall because \"the faith in the possibility of contact between all sentient beings is opposed to the concept of fashion in the West disunity people and spiritual isolation of man\" [Revich, 1968, p. 84].\n\nFilm critic A. Svobodin (1922-1999) positive appreciated the adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's novel Anna Karenina directed by A. Zarkhi (1908-1997) [Svobodin, 1968, p. 40].\n\nThe remaining number of pages of the yearbook, as always, took portraits of filmmakers: N. Mikhalkov [Zinoviev, Markov, 1968, p. 64-66] O. Iosseliani [Dolinsky, Chertok, 1968, pp. 41-45], S. Ursky, A. Batalov, P. Aleynikov, D. Banionis, T. Doronina, R. Bykov [Levshina 1968, pp. 76-79].\n\nScreen 1968-1969 (1969, put in a set in February 1969)\n\nA secret resolution of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee \"On increasing the responsibility of the heads of the press, radio and television, film, culture and art institutions for the ideological and political level of the published materials and repertoire\" [Resolution ..., 1969] was adopted in response to the liberal events of the \"Prague Spring\": \"Print workers, writers and artists must have more acute class and party positions to oppose all manifestations of bourgeois\n\n226\n\nideology, they must actively and efficiently promote communist ideals, the advantages of socialism, the Soviet way of life, deeply analyze and expose the different kind of petty-bourgeois and revisionist currents. Meanwhile, some authors, and directors depart from the class criteria in assessing and highlighting the complex social and political problems, facts and events, and sometimes become carriers of the views that are alien to the ideology of socialist society. Attempts have been made unilaterally, subjectively evaluate the important periods of the history of the party and the state...\n\nSome managers of publishing houses, press agencies, radio, television, institutions of culture and art do not take appropriate measures to prevent the publication of a false ideological works, do not work well with the authors, show flexibility and political unscrupulousness in matters of publication ideologically perverse material. ... The soviet Communist Party Central Committee considers it necessary to stress the special responsibility of the heads of organizations and departments and editorial teams for the ideological orientation\" [Resolution., 1969].\n\nYearbook Screen 1968-1969 was put into set in February 1969, a month after this decision, and six months after the Soviet invasion in Czechoslovakia. Therefore, the books' compilers just had to take into account the current political situation. However, they still managed broad panorama the most striking phenomena of the national film industry.\n\nThe tighter censorship on the pages of the yearbook, of course, remained. For example, in the section Close-up [Screen 1968-1969, pp. 91-93] were initially placed reflections A. Konchalovsky about his film Asya's Happiness. But then, apparently due to pressure from \"above\" and shelf destiny of this movie, this text have been replaced by an article about actress A. Demidova. The film Asya's Happiness initially [Screen 1968-1969, pp. 110-115] was in the discussion chapter Controversy, but later this material was sealed the black stars in the table of contents [Screen 1968-1969, p. 317] and replaced by the discussion about the film Running on Waves by P. Lyubimov (1938-2010).\n\nIt is clear there was no way to avoid ideological pathos in the yearbook. The book once again reminded to readers that Mother by V. Pudovkin \"brought to the cinema powerful influence of socialist realism, merged the power of images Gorky's prose with the realistic performance of the actors, the highest achievements of film culture\" [Pisarevsky 1969, p. 19], and The Sixth of July is a major new step in the development of the Leninist theme. ... This victory is all the more important that the last time there were many films and performances, where most topics in the result only untalented performance compromise. The Sixth of July is not just a historical picture. It is living our present time. And today's struggle for communism requires reflection attacks rr-revolutionary demagogues, for the sake of playing phrases left the fate of nations\" [Freilich, 1969, p. 63].\n\nOn the other hand, only a few months left before the super-officious journals Communist and Ogoniok published sharply accusatory articles about The Sixth of July by M. Shatrov (1932 - 2010), and J. Karasik (1923-2015)\n\nThe Sixth of July was clearly on the side of \"socialism with a human face.\" And the conservative Ogoniok wrote: \"We are convinced that the film The Sixth of July does not serve the education of viewers. ... Historical truth is not on the side of film's authors. ... This film violated historical truth: the main focus is not on Lenin's activity, but on the Left Socialist-Revolutionary rebellion, and their leader M. Spiridonova. We believe that the film The Sixth of July does not deserve Lenin Prize\" [Savinchenko, Shirokov, 1970, p. 25]\n\nBut the Screen 1968-1969 supported not only The Sixth of July, but also a much more daring movie No Path Through Fire by G. Panfilov unvarnished spoke about civil war ruthlessly divided the nation into \"red\" and \"white\". This film \"is a strong, very strong, and most importantly - this film is very impressive\" [Rakhmanov, 1969, p. 64].\n\nT. Khloplyankina wrote on other notable film about civil background -There Were Two Comrades (writers Y. Dunsky and V. Fried, director E. Karelin) also very warmly. However the author did not say anything about a bitter essence of this wonderful film, practically openly speaking against the fratricidal civil war.\n\nThe analysis of films on \"historical and revolutionary themes\" (Mysterious Monk, Emergency Order, The First Courier, Nikolay Bauman, The Seventh Companion, There Were Two Comrades, The Sixth of July) in the article by A. Vartanov [Vartanov, 1969, pp. 134-138] was given in traditional for this time style.\n\nScreen 1968-1969 was able to afford to support again the Ukrainian poetic cinema, this time - Evening on the eve Midsummer by Y. Ilienko (1936-2010): \"This is the scope of the director's fancy - fancy, inventive in each frame. ... large, generous, sophisticated. ... The strong temperament of the master, even involuntary and unavoidable mistakes he has in many cases can be converted into victory, turned into discoveries\" [Drach, 1969, p. 88].\n\nYearbook's polemic section this time was devoted to films Women Power by Y. Nagibin (1920-1994) and A. Saltykov (1934-1993), The Golden Calf by M. Schweitzer (1920-2000), and (instead of Asya 's Happiness) Running on Waves by P. Lyubimov.\n\nAfter seeing Women Power, K. Shcherbakov come to the harsh conclusion: \"Given an order to tell about the hard fate of the female, to portray life as it is, without fear of its cruel side, the authors, it seems to me, not imagined what outcome they want to extract. And artistically unselected, unsought conglomeration of naturalistic, difficult-to-eye episodes begins to avenge himself, turns the moral unscrupulousness and deafness, leads to a distortion of what we are accustomed to understand by the words \"popular character\" [Shcherbakov, 1969, p. 99].\n\nN. Ilyina argued with K. Shcherbakov, insisting that the artistic quality of this film is quite high: \"Naturalism? Some people say this about the film. ... But if you hold the primordial meaning of the word, referring to \"naturalism\" rough and mechanical copying from nature, the work that is touching and shocking, can not be called naturalistic. ... The film Women Power has advantages and disadvantages. But one thing it is not - the indifference and lethargy\" [Ilyina, 1969, pp. 103-104].\n\nB. Galanov (1914-2000), of course, could not yet assume that the sad comedy of M. Schweitzer The Golden Calf deservedly become a kind of Russian \"cult film\" of our day, and, I think, did not understand the depth of this brilliant movie. Therefore B. Galanov complained that (unlike the eponymous book of I. Ilf and E. Petrov) \"the laughter, if not completely disappeared, but turned slightly to drama on the screen. And Ostap Bender himself as the face of a dramatic, gained some importance. ... Whether or not whether to submit the rogue as a \"great strategist\" intellectual, a man with the eternal sad eyes?\" [Galanov 1969, p. 105].\n\nIn this context, M. Dolinsky & S. Chertok gave clear and reasoned response to B. Galanov: The Golden Calf presented \"Bender outstanding, talented person who is at odds with the times and have chosen this path, can be as just because of this disorder. ... Crashing superior man. Is this funny? And M. Schweitzer rights, which, by sacrificing some fun stakes, giving up many winning situations, created the film, not only equipped with wit, but also imbued with sadness\" [Dolinsky, Chertok, 1969, p. 109].\n\nLiterary critic V. Turbin (1927-1993) was unhappy with the adaptation of A. Green's novel Running on Waves. He insisted that \"Green's novel is easy, laid-back, and the film is heavy, full of massive suggestiveness\" [Turbin, 1969, pp.110111]. However Y. Khanyutin (1929-1978) was on the side of the authors of this film: \"Much of the script and the film was not so, as in Green's novel, but, I think, more interesting ... In short, a tragedy has already unfulfilled in the film has turned out sharper than the happiness of searches that can still happen\" [Khanyutin, 1969, pp. 113-115].\n\nM. Bleyman's article also was dedicated to film adaptations. The film critic thought that the \"creative challenge for adaptation is to find stylistic originality means to realize other art on the screen\" [Bleyman, 1969, p. 147].\n\nAnd A. Macheret (1996-1979), basically agreeing with M. Bleyman, came to the conclusion that I. Pyrev managed to adequately approach to the novel The Brothers Karamazov: \"Pyrev's personal creative features properties of artistic talent found in the film adaptation of the great Dostoyevsky's most fertile, mate them to the basis for its higher manifestations\" [Macheret, 1969, p. 150].\n\nI. Levshina wrote consistently negative review on the adaptation of the play by E. Radzinsky 104 pages about love. She very convincingly argued that \"artistic and moral potential of the film Once Again About Love and remained at the level of everyday history. The huge box-office success does not prevent this film become for us an example of failure in art. ... The reasons for the failure of the\n\n229\n\nfilm are the complete absence of at least some independent thought, at least some of the image, at least some of the director's attempts, cinematic reading of the play\" [Levshina, 1969, pp.148-149].\n\nSpecialist in the analysis of science fiction and adventure, V. Revich this time published an article about the spy cinema: \"The main complaint, which is usually presented \"detective\" movies, is that the frantic pace of the action, the rapid twists, in which captures the spirit of the audience, press down psychology, characters, images. And if the hero can do to show individuality in such conditions? I must admit that, perhaps, no other kind of film genre not put his character in such a rigid framework. Most of the time he is in exceptional psychological situation - on a knife edge. Of course, the story sharpness about the man who all the time is under threat of death is very essential aspect of the film, but the sharpness is worth nothing if we can not see the interesting character. ... The human image creation on such a narrow space surround is always difficult artistic task, and the list of failures is much higher than the premium sheet\" [Revich, 1969, p. 140].\n\nV. Revich wrote in this context about extremely popular at that time adventure war film Shield and Sword: \"The authors often put their characters in a situation clearly implausible. Hard to believe that Soviet aircraft could have easily landed and take off in wartime Germany, and underground groups, in broad daylight, could have grab the train and prison\" [Revich, 1969, p.141].\n\nAs always, a large number of pages of the yearbook dedicated to the topic of contemporary cinema. And here it is possible to note a positive review N. Lordkipanidze devoted to the analysis of one of the most acute social Soviet films -Three Days of Victor Chernyshev (writer E. Grigoriev, director M. Osepyan). Of course, this article is not touch to the serious social generalizations relating to talented critical interpretation of the image \"representative of the working class\". N. Lordkipanidze dared only to write that \"passivity is the main thing that will not accept the authors in his character; passive attitude towards certain phenomena of reality\" [Lordkipanidze, 1969, p. 85], but she did not go farther inland (most likely, for censorship reasons)...\n\nJ. Warsawsky wrote his review of the school drama We'll Live Till Monday (screenwriter G. Polonsky, director S. Rostotsky) in a similar spirit. The film earned a warm assessment, but without any attention to all the possible sharp edges of Soviet school problems...\n\nL. Anninsky, I think, revealed the creative concept of Triangle by G. Malyan (1925-1988) more deeply and convincingly, stressing that \"the essence of the film is not in the traditional life, but in the sense of the uniqueness of the life, its irreplaceable uniqueness\" [Anninsky, 1969, p.81].\n\nScreen 1969-1970 (1970, put in a set in March 1970)\n\nThis Yearbook was released in the year a centenary \"leader of world proletariat\" V.I. Lenin, therefore, the first forty pages of text were filled with a collection of most tedious officious materials dedicated to this date.\n\nBut after that Yearbook returned to the usual format: deservedly praised poetic melodrama Lovers by I. Ishmuhamedov [Kazakova, 1970, p. 44] and sad comedy Do not worry! by G. Danelia [Lipkov, 1970, pp. 46-49]. In particular, A. Lipkov (1936-2007) claimed with good reason that \"it is the same Danelia, who knows how to treat his characters with a smile, to forgive their weaknesses, admire their merits, in short, who knows how to love their heroes and infect his love of the audience. Properties of the artist's talent has always embodied that it creates. In the film Do not worry! We can see the main feature of the authors: generosity\" [Lipkov, 1970, p. 46].\n\nCritics praised the film adaptation of novels of Chingiz Aitmatov (19282008). A. Zorky (1935-2006), analyzing the film Running Pacer by S. Urusevsky, answered for this question: \"How still relate to each other and the film and story of Chingiz Aitmatov? So, as the lyric poem may be related to the social novel. A lyrical poem written by the hand of a talented like-minded\" [Zorky, 1970, p. 55].\n\nA. Troshin (1942-2008) was very positive to the movie Jamila by M. Poplavskaya (1924-2012): \"Sincerity tone is one of the qualities of Aitmatov's prose, which the film adaptation found in of cinematic equivalent\" [Troshin, 1970, p. 58].\n\nD. Pisarevsky wrote good review about the best L. Gaidai (1923-1993) comedy Diamond Hand: \"genre fusion experiment was a success. Color and widescreen movie is action and entertaining, funny and ironic. ... The film is fun, mischievously, in a rapid pace with literally staggering cascades of plot surprises\" [Pisarevsky, 1970, p. 58].\n\nBut Yearbook struck suddenly (as we recall, earlier Screen positively evaluated of poetic genre) on the poetic parable Eastern Corridor by V. Vinogradov (1933-2011). The article of T. Ivanova was not written specifically for the Yearbook, but reprinted from the December issue of the magazine Soviet Screen [Ivanova, 1969]. Therefore, T. Ivanova, in my opinion, was the first Soviet film critic who wrote the harsh criticism about poetic parable cinema. However, I do not think that T. Ivanova wrote an article under the direct influence of some censorship \"decisions\" and \"valuable suggestions\". But cinema authority skillfully used this article (as M. Bleyman's article) for their own censorship's purposes.\n\nT. Ivanova claimed that the \"difficulty\", \"incomprehensible\" film language, widely used, is the quality seemed to be self-valuable, \"necessary\" a sign of good cinematic tone. And Eastern Corridor it seems almost standard in this regard. ... From the very beginning of this film V. Vinogradov introduces the viewer to a special circle in a special atmosphere. The authors make every effort not only exacerbate, but also complicate the subject, action, conflict. Eastern Corridor is\n\n231\n\none of those movies, after watching that there is a need to look into the abstract: to understand the sequence of events, just to find out what's what. As if some simple picture is cut into many pieces, large and small, carefully mixed, shaken and put a new curlicue puzzle. This is the general compositional structure and is the same solution, even a purely visual, every single episode. ... The puzzle in the puzzle, ... the cruel mixture of naturalism and graphic sophistication prevails on the screen. ... This if abundance of cruel effects and extravagant entourage. This if sophisticated operator skill. All taken together this is aestheticization naturalism. But there is and the ethical aspect. It seems that people are acting in this film live in a unique country and terrible world, swept away by their feelings, strung up, crushed, they themselves hysterically and tragically exalted. And there comes a time when pumped emotional temperature of the film begins to give birth to a protest\" [Ivanova, 1970, pp. 93-94].\n\nI think this piece of article strongly suggests that T. Ivanova did not understand the essence of vivid imagery this outstanding film-parable. In my opinion, cinemateque quotes (early motifs from films of A. Wajda and M. Jancso, andthe Czech \"new wave\") organically entered in the film of V. Vinogradov. Plus philosophical, religious and visual originality of this movie (more about Eastern Corridor you can read in the articles: Gershezon, 2011, pp. 136-144; Fedorov, 2011, pp. 110-116)...\n\nBy the way, the negative reaction of the Soviet critics of Vinogradov's film and many famous movies of the Czech \"New Wave\" of the 1960s on the war topic was very similar. For example, S. Komarov wrote about Diamonds of the Night (1964) by Czech director J. Nemec: \"Surreal world of Kafka is embodied with a more impressive force. Operators J. Kucera and M. Ondrzhichek invested in this work an important contribution. . This film won wide acclaim from critics of the capitalist countries, and a number of awards at international festivals, but there crush sober voice, expressing his surprise at the creation of the film in one of the socialist countries\" [Komarov, 1974, p. 62].\n\nAgainst this background, it is surprising that the Eastern Corridor still came out (albeit briefly) in the Soviet cinemas...\n\nBut back to T. Ivanova's article. Having finished with the Eastern Corridor, she moved to the poetic parables of Y. Ilienko (Evening on the eve of Ivan Kupala) and T. Abuladze (Prayer): \"The need to be understood, inherent in every person, especially for an artist. ... It is difficult to make \"difficult\" films. And Prayer and Evening on the eve of Ivan Kupala preserve traces of the difficult art of searching and overcoming. But one thing seems to have been abandoned by the authors neglected: searches for clarity\" [Ivanova, 1970, p. 95].\n\nPerhaps T. Ivanova's article was one of the most polemical sharp in the Screen yearbooks' history. Other materials of Screen 1969-1970 were much more ordinary...\n\nScreen 1970-1971 (1971, put in a set in February 1971)\n\nIn 1970, the USSR was celebrated not only the 100th anniversary of V.I. Lenin, but also the 25th anniversary of victory over Nazi Germany. Hence it is clear that this yearbook published many articles on the military film topic. For example, V. Fomin did not stint on the praise for the remarkable film It was the month of May by M. Khutsiev: \"This film, organically combining in-depth with the scale of the image is psychological, modest grounded narrative style with an open and emotional pathos\" [Fomin, 1971, p. 27].\n\nSeveral articles were devoted to the films about the Civil War. Here Y. Warsawsky initially quite reasonably wrote that \"the civil war is main topic a lot of movies. But these films often written and directed as adventurous. Reds. Whites. What decides the victory in such films? Who will outwit. Who shoots better, faster rides on horseback. ... and then the dramatic events of the civil war turned only amusing adventure\" [Warsawsky, 1971, p. 92].\n\nBut then the critic, alas, went on to openly communist propaganda: \"Lenin wrote on the festive energy revolution! ... There are new generations of viewers, they should see a revolution on the screen and emotionally survive, like commissars: wise, pure, honest\" [Warsawsky, 1971, p. 92].\n\nA. Karaganov (1915-2007), a very influential at that time film critic, wrote the article devoted to one of the most remarkable films about the civil war - Run by A. Alov and V. Naumov. He stressed that \"movie camera \"sees\" Russian landscapes through the eyes not only of those who are fighting for a new life, but also those who are in love with the old life, fighting for it\" [Karaganov, 1971, p. 60].\n\nBut then (like J. Warsawsky) A. Karaganov followed by communist ideologically passage: \"In many of the current foreign films corruption of human characters are portrayed as a process and as a state that expresses the total human defeat, his eternal depravity, a fatal inability to live like human beings. But dehumanization of man stands concretely and historically and socially in Run. The characters are exposed deformation caused by violation of organic links with their homeland, butchery against the people, the service for historically unrighteous case\" [Karaganov, 1971, p. 62].\n\nThe yearbook positively evaluated and other famous film on the topic of civil war - The adjutant of his Excellency. V. Revich wrote about the innovative approach of the authors to the image of the White Guard General: \"Kovalevsky is far from the popular image of \"Whites\". He is smart, intelligent, gentle and kind, even to the extent possible for the military\" [Revich, 1971, p. 104].\n\n... Red spy Koltsov, intelligent and clever, at the White Guard General Kovalevsky. The psychological duel between Koltsov and General Kovalevsky also the smartest and intelligent... This situation was unusual story for the audience, educated Chapayev, where Whites (or their sympathizers) was the cruel enemies... Of course, The adjutant of his Excellency (directed by E. Tashkov)\n\n233\n\nprimarily attracted detective intrigue. But having a partner-opponent such as General Kovalevsky, Koltsov, undoubtedly gaining extra points at a mass audience. General was imposing, impressive, clever, ironic. I would say more, Kovalevsky even then, at the end of 1960, aroused sympathy and empathy.\n\nA. Lipkov also gave the positive opinion for another film about civil war -The White Sun of the Desert by V. Motyl: \"The history of real events - revolution, civil war in Central Asia - represent only the background of the events, they left behind the scenes, but the narrative and fiction triumphs of this film is good ironic comedy\" [Lipkov, 1971, p. 94].\n\nAs usual, the yearbook analyzed the most notable movies. For example, the film Crime and Punishment by L. Kulidzhanov (1923-2002): \"The director read F. Dostoevsky's novel seriously, quietly, carefully. ... Read without any attempts to modernize the problems... This is a talented, serious and deep film. ... Maybe the director and the actors let something controversial, but highly interesting\" [Pogozheva 1971, pp.78, 83].\n\nA. Lipkov was stressed the originality of King Lear by G. Kozintsev: \"This film is not trying to improve Shakespeare, retouch the world of his tragedy. The director is faithful and does not fit into any canonical frameworks\" [Lipkov, 1971, p. 64].\n\nThe biographical drama Tchaikovsky received a more critical assessment, although the film critic noted at the same time that \"I. Talankin in the best scenes of the film showed the taste and skill of the director\" [Ryzhov, 1971, p. 90].\n\nThe Beginning by G. Panfilov earned the highest praise (and absolutely deserved) between the films on contemporary topics: \"Reading the press on The Beginning, you see that 99 percent of it consists of admirable actor's work I. Chourikova. You may think that The Beginning it is just Churikova. But with all our surprise the brilliant performance of this extraordinary actress, The Beginning is primarily G. Panfilov\" [Sobolev, 1971, p.72]. Y. Khanutin and A. Troshin also wote about the mastery and talent of G. Panfilov and I. Churikova [Khanyutin, 1971, pp. 116-122; Troshin, 1971, pp. 75-77].\n\nAnother very acute at the time of 1960s was the crime drama Accused of Murder by B. Volchek (1905-1974). And Yearbook published very important conclusion: \"This film is strongly convinces us that man, trampling the rights of others, to humiliate him, not reveres his dignity, condemns himself to an animal existence, deprives himself of the right to be called a man\" [Ostrovsky, 1971, p. 87].\n\nThe detailed article of A. Vartanov was devoted to television language [Vartanov, 1971, pp. 128-134].\n\nScreen 1971-1972 (1972, put in a set in March 1972)\n\nThe most influential actions of these times were The XXIV Soviet Communist Party Congress (1971) and the year of the 50th anniversary of the\n\n234\n\nUSSR. And new censorship requirements in relation to the Soviet film and literature press were in the new Resolution of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee On Literary Criticism (January 21, 1972), which was in unison with Resolution of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee \"On increasing the responsibility of the heads of the press, radio and television, film, culture and art institutions for the ideological and political level of the published materials and repertoire\" [Resolution..., 1969].\n\nThis is the significal part of this new Resolution: \"The state of the criticism has not yet fully meet the requirements, which are determined by the increasing role of artistic culture in communist construction. ... Soviet critics sometimes published materials, which gives the wrong picture of the history of Soviet and pre-revolutionary art... Criticism is still not active and consistent in approving revolutionary, humanistic ideals of the art of socialist realism, in exposing the reactionary nature of the bourgeois \"mass culture\" and decadent currents in dealing with various kinds of non-Marxist views on literature and art, revisionist aesthetic concepts. ... The duty of criticism is deeply analyze the phenomenon, trends and patterns of contemporary artistic process, and to help strengthen the Leninist principles of party and nation, to fight for a high ideological and aesthetic level in Soviet art, consistently oppose bourgeois ideology. Literary and art criticism is intended to contribute to the expansion of the ideological outlook of the artist and the improvement of his skills. Building on the tradition of Marxist-Leninist aesthetics, Soviet literary and art criticism must combine precision ideological evaluations, depth social analysis aesthetically exacting, careful attitude to the talent to be fruitful creative research\"[Resolution ..., 1972].\n\nOf course, the Yearbook could not ignore these guiding instructions. However, the Screen 1971-1972 was set in March 1972, that is only a few months after the publication On Literary Criticism and, therefore, essentially composed in 1971. Hence it is clear that a polemical column survived (although the last time in the pre-perestroika era), and in the ratio of pages' number allocated for materials about the Soviet and foreign films, the latter percentage was \"seditious\" (but also the last time) is overvalued (47% articles about foreign films vs. 44% articles about soviet films).\n\nHowever, crowded of propaganda and ideological clichés A. Karaganov's article under the eloquent title Responsibility of criticism was real respond to Communist Party Resolution: \"The good film critic review, actively and skillfully conducting the Party's line, it may be an effective means not only aesthetic, but also the political education of the working people, a powerful weapon of ideological struggle; Party purposeful, smart, aesthetically soulful conversation about the film helps a person to know better, deeper understanding of art, life, politics, helps the formation of communist convictions, the education culture of feelings and thoughts. ... Criticism is designed to consistently assert the Leninist principles of party and nation, determining the direction of cinematography socialist realism. ... It is impossible not to see that our film critic has not yet risen\n\n235\n\nto the level of the tasks dictated by modernity. The press still often publish articles about movies that lack of party principles, the class approach to the realities of art and life, combat offensive spirit in the fight against a hostile ideology and its influence. ... Our film critic insufficiently active in the fight against the ideological and artistic marriage\" [Karaganov, 1972, pp. 92-93].\n\nOverall, however, the inertia of the publishing industry has affected the Screen 1971-1972 positive content. Moreover, V. Fomin's courageous article The sublime and the earthly, in fact, opposed the official criticism hounding a poetic parable and cinema. V. Fomin wrote: \"Movies of Parajanov, Abuladze, Ilienko, Mansurov in its stylistic decision defiantly opposed the the usual rate, polemically rejected the authenticity of aesthetics. The expressive figurative form openly stands out sharply at in these films with lush and sophisticated system of imagery, lyrical and romantic actions\" [Fomin, 1972, p. 98].\n\nContrary to the Resolution's wishes \"to support movies about the working class\", V. Revich, criticized the \"working class\" movies Night Shift, Anthracite, Cool Horizon, remarking that \"the filmmakers would be very easy live if the seriousness of the plan could at least to some extent compensate for the weakness of films\" [Revich, 1972, pp. 85-86].\n\nFilm critics argued in the polemical section about the comedy 12 Chairs by L. Gaidai and melodrama About Love by M. Bogin.\n\nV. Shitova severely (and, I think, too harshly) summarized that \"colorful film directed by Leonid Gaidai is none other than the dummy's novel. That is to say, a body without a soul. ... And as a result of film 12 Chairs as a spectacle sluggish, and sometimes simply boring\" [Shitova, 1972, pp. 70-71]. But G. Kozhukhova insisted that \"Gaidai is the master of eccentric and entertaining comedy\" [Kozhukhova, 1972, p. 73].\n\nSpeaking about the film About Love, T. Khloplyankina generally very warmly reacted to this exquisitely lyrical works with latent intonation of \"moral anxiety\": \"May be this line expressed not as loud as it should be: the author does not burst, no anger, no pain, but only a certain melancholy. That is why the film has several monophonic melody, reminiscent of the sad motif consisting of a repeat of the same musical phrase. But it is not false. ... And, really, we need to listen to this music...\" [Khloplyankina, 1972, p. 77].\n\nBut A. Zorky, in my opinion, was not able to penetrate into the fine M. Bogin's poetic watercolors: \"Man in the elegant environment. It is still a symbol, not transported in life\" [Zorky, 1972, p. 79].\n\nAn article E. Gromov (1931-2005) was devoted to personal aspect in modern topic on the screen: The Beginning and Near the Lake \"is touched a very important topic, which is in the air. This is the theme of emotional wealth of personality, intellectualism and rationalism in an age of rapid scientific and technological progress\" [Gromov, 1972, p. 88]. But in the Young By N. Moskalenko (1926-1974) is example of a \"characters' depersonalization. None of\n\nthem, not only is not a person, but not even it tends to become\" [Gromov, 1972, p. 91].\n\nUnfortunately, E. Gromov unable to appreciate the artistic level of Urban Romance by P. Todorovsky (1925-2013): \"The director P. Todorovsky and screenwriter F. Mironer groped acute actual conflict situation. But, alas, the ore did not turn into metal. Drama turned into a melodrama\" [Gromov, 1972, p. 89].\n\nThe section devoted to adaptations presents Carousel by M. Schweitzer, Uncle Vanya by A. Konchalovsky and The Seagull by Y. Karasik.\n\nA. Lipkov wrote that sad comedy Carousel built \"easily and gracefully, exactly freely addressing ironic stylisation, parody, cartoon extravaganza, grotesque. But this rainbow heap husked comedy arsenal at the viewer from the first frame appears and starts louder sound painfully poignant note\" [Lipkov, 1972, p. 37]. And then he the bright and vividly spoke about the film adaptation of the play Uncle Vanya: \"Konchalovsky reads Chekhov not only as a thin and quivering lyricism, not as sad contemplative human ills, and certainly not as a chronicler. Chekhov for his tragic artist, furious, desperate diseases tormented century. Heroes of Uncle Vanya inflamed unquenchable thirst for love, complicity, big present case\" [Lipkov, 1972, p. 44]. The Seagull by Yuri Karasik was fairly valued much lower [Borodin, 1972, pp. 45-46].\n\nChief editor of Soviet Screen D. Pisarevsky shared with readers arguments (and now not lost its relevance) about the results of the traditional competition in which the readers of the magazine evaluated the films of the year: \"Movement of films and spectators to each other is a complex and dialectic process. And may increase the aesthetic tastes of the audience, pulling backward to the advanced level (and those, in turn, to a new, higher level), contributes to the real study of the audience and the entire system of educational work with the mass audience. It will be a school, and film club, and the mass cinema. But first and foremost, of course, by the works of film art\" [Pisarevsky, 1972, p.103].\n\nThe authors of the yearbook also wrote positive articles about the films Attention, Turtle! [Levshina, 1972, pp. 36-38], The End of Ataman [Sulkin, 1972, pp. 28-32], We and Our Mountains [Vartanov, 1972, pp. 47-49].\n\nScreen 1973-1974 (1975, put in a set in February 1974)\n\nThis Yearbook was the last compiler's work of S. Chertok. Then the cinema bosses apparently decided that his editorial policy to take a significant conflict with the Resolution of Soviet Communist Party Central Committee On Literary Criticism (1972) and no longer corresponds to the current trend. Starting with the Screen 1973-1974, the foreign section of the yearbooks was the decline in volumes and articles on Western movie stars gradually gave way to the \"stars\" of the \"third world\".\n\nMedvedev's article Fifty-firstYear was full of the ideological fervor in the spirit of Resolution: \"When I remember the films 1973, I think that this year\n\n237\n\nstarted in the joyful and exciting days of our holiday: the golden jubilee of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. New battle Kremlin chimes alerted the world about the beginning of a new history of half a century of unprecedented community of people, whose name - the Soviet people\" [Medvedev, 1975, p.86].\n\nFurther there was a great quote from the report of L.I. Brezhnev On the 50th Anniversary of the USSR. No one critic had not allowed himself to this kind of quotes in the Screen Yearbooks...\n\nBut on the whole yearbook still trying to keep film studies brand. For example, analyzing a film A Bad Good Man by I. Kheifits (1905-1995), A. Lipkov wrote: \"Chekhov saw the task of art is \"to squeeze out of the slavery of man - drop by drop.\" Kheifits' film inspires the same hatred of slavery - to rid the person of abstract ideas dogma, violence, physical and moral terror philistine environment. Man, with all its weaknesses and imperfections, fortunately, it is still not an ant, no termite, no beetle. He is a human. Bad or good, or even that more difficult - the 'bad good', but man\" [Lipkov, 1975, p. 26].\n\nI. Levshina heartily praised adaptation of Mark Twain's novel Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, set by G. Danelia titled Hopelessly Lost: \"unexpectedly slow, achingly sad - this film seems deliberately circumvents many of the adventures\" [Levshin, 1975, p. 32].\n\nV. Demin (1937-1993) favorably reacted to freestyle adaptation of the play by Mikhail Bulgakov: the comedy Ivan Vasilievich changes his occupation by L. Gaidai: \"Today, our comedy can not boast a lot of luck... This alarming joke of L. Gaidai is unconditional and remarkable success\" [Demin, 1975, p. 81].\n\nThe Yearbook also singled out the most important films on contemporary topics: Happy Go Lucky by V.Shukshin and Monologue by I. Averbach.\n\nV. Fomin wrote: \"Shukshin still faithful to his character, he actively empathizes... Shukshin enamored looks at his Ivan Rastorguev, admires them and then quite ruthlessly punishes him for his obvious failures and weaknesses inherent in the nature\" [Fomin, 1975, p. 30].\n\nBut R. Yurenev was more strict in relation to the film Monologue because of Western influences: \"The love of the people, attention to him, attention to the most seemingly ordinary and insignificant everyday problems - the priceless quality of the script E. Gabrilovich, well understood and generally successful implementation by I. Averbach. ... In the scene of the meeting of the old academician with ageless love of his youth I seen the influence of I. Bergman; in boys trumpeter - F. Fellini.\" [Yurenev, 1975, p. 21].\n\nAfter paying tribute to the actor's talent of M. Ulyanov (1927-2007), L. Pogozheva (1913-1989) wrote fairly restrained about his director's work The Last Day, noting that \"the plot of this film is not new and is not original, but it is interesting to watch. I think this is mainly due to the presence on the screen M. Ulyanov. His game is very well thought-out, very precise and absolutely reliable\" [Pogozheva, 1975, p. 23].\n\nA similar verdict was about the film Hot Snow by G. Egiazarov (19161988) [Bocharov, 1975, p. 15]. In my opinion, extremely complementary reviews have been published on the films Deep [Sulkin, 1975, pp. 35-38], Herkus Mantas [Borodin, 1975, pp. 41-43], Melodies of Veriysky Quarter [Lordkipanidze, 1975, pp. 44-47], And then I said: no... [Gerber, 1975, pp. 39-40].\n\nThe Yearbook has not forgotten about the action movies. V. Revich rightly criticized feature weakness of detectives Shah Queen of Diamonds and The Black Prince [Revich, 1975, pp. 92-94.].\n\nR. Sobolev (1926-1991) wrote a positive, but too traditional and boring review of the detective TV-series Seventeen Moments of Spring [Sobolev, 1975, pp. 52-54] by T. Lioznova (1924-2011).\n\nMaybe the editor S. Chertok could venture out to reprint a brilliant review Lessons 'Moments' by V. Demin, published earlier in Soviet Screen [Demin, 1973, p9. 4-5]. But, firstly, D. Pisarevsky, the editor in chief of Soviet Screen, lost his job in 1975 because of \"ill-advised\" the publication of this brave article. And secondly, as the saying goes, better safe than sorry...\n\nAlthough readers it would be useful to reflect on the following V. Demin's phrase: \"The swastika, rituals fires and torchbearers, skulls as emblems - fascism was not averse to flirt eerie black symbols. The film does not indulge these claims. . What is there? There people crippled fascist order, accustomed to trust \"the system\" more than himself. But all the same people, not monsters. This is intriguing, and this is also should not be underestimated\" [Demin, 1973].\n\nT. Hloplyankina drew the attention of readers, that \"films flirting with melodrama and at the same time carefully concealing this flirtation pretentious dialogue, speculation on the topic of modern film language, appear on the screen quite often. And it's a pity, because this genre, of course, the audience favorite, and always urging him feeling good, worthy of better treatment\" [Hloplyankina, 1975, p. 96].\n\nAnd D. Pisarevsky, yet not dismissed from his position, referring to the results of the survey of Soviet Screen readers, reasonably stated that \"mass surveys the audience once again confirmed that box office and their true value and evaluation audience are very different things. Films that have received the highest evaluation of the audience, not all cases can be found in the box office top list, and the comedy and adventure movies that have gathered of millions audiences, often missing in the list of the best films of the year\" [Pisarevsky, 1975, p. 99].\n\nScreen 1974-1975 (1976, put in a set in November 1975)\n\nYearbook changed the editor. The new editors E. Bauman and G. Dolmatovskaya were assigned instead fired S. Chertok (by the way, in one year with D. Pisarevsky). And Screen 1974-1975 not only reduced the presence of foreign materials to an all-time low (19% of the total volume of materials\n\ncollection), but also got rid of such talented, but \"too free-thinking\" authors like L. Anninsky, V. Demin, Y. Khanyutin, N. Zorkaya and I. Levshina...\n\nIn 1975, USSR celebrated the 30th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany, so the bulk of the material on the Soviet cinema was devoted to films about the war. Firstly Liberation by Y. Ozerov (1921-2001) and They Fought for Their Motherland by S. Bondarchuk (1920-1994).\n\nV. Baskakov wrote: \"Deep, bold, talented director Sergei Bondarchuk, wonderful actors, the whole shooting team embodied on the screen the ideas and images of Mikhail Sholokhov's novel They Fought for Their Motherland\" [Baskakov, 1976, p. 24]. And A. Karaganov wrote that \"S. Bondarchuk created a movie, endearing courageous truthfulness\" [Karaganov, 1976, p.12]. But even he could not afford to respond as super positive about the rather loose and strained pathos of Liberation: \"This film is not free of errors. ... But on the whole ... this is a remarkable work, endearing honesty and recreation events scale, purposefulness directorial solutions, carrier and the actor's art\" [Karaganov, 1976, p. 11].\n\nIt seems that the updated Yearbook tried to show their loyalty to the precepts of the Resolution of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee of the On Literary Criticism: Screen 1974-1975 wrote positively even such mediocre movie on the military theme as Ballad of Kovpak [Kudin, 1976, pp. 38-42], Flame [Shatsillo, 1976, pp. 42-46] and High Rank [Kazarinov, 1976, pp. 46-48]. Although all three reviews noted for the sake of decency \"minor deficiencies\", they always stressed that these films \"have become a notable event\"...\n\nBut T. Ivaniva's article about L. Bykov's wonderful film Only old men go to fight interesting to read. And it is difficult not to agree with the fact that \"the director seems to not want to work it is required to look original, relishing the unexpected turns in the threads or exclusively modern film language. Apparently, he is not afraid to appear neither too traditional nor too sentimental\" [Ivanova, 1976, p.49].\n\nThe Yearbook was again under the influence of On Literary Criticism reviewing working class drama The Hottest Month [Egorov, 1976, p. 87]. But V. Mikhalkovich had a more sober view of the films on the working class topic [Mikhalkovich, 1976, pp. 116-120].\n\nThe main part of the modern section of the Yearbook was given to the analysis of Red Kalina by V.Shukshin, Romance for Lovers by A. Konchalovsky, and Daughters and Mothers by S. Gerasimov and other notable works of the screen.\n\nG. Kapralov's article was correct: \"In the interpretation of the history of Red Kalina could become commonplace and criminal chronicle and cheap melodrama. But V. Shukshin raises it to the height of moral and philosophical thoughts about life, its true and false values\" [Kapralov, 1976, p. 76].\n\nL. Belova was no less convincing in his argument: \"The heroic soul, ready to exploit in the name of goodness and justice, Olga Vasilyeva from the movie Daughters and Mothers in the same time is not a standard of positivity. ... The true\n\n240\n\nvalue of her nature is dialectical, because its manifestations Olga also draws as little scary ... This film give us the chance to think\" [Belova, 1976, p. 92].\n\nE. Gromov wrote that the film Romance for Lovers \"a truly talented and significant. This is a deeply poetic meditation on love and duty, the meaning of life\" [Gromov, 1976, p. 82].\n\nE. Bauman equally appreciated ironic parable Jackass By E. Shengelaja: \"This film has many unusual, striking the imagination and eccentricity paradoxical situations, characters, dialogue, unexpected plot and thinking of the author. This is a comedy in which intertwine the seriousness of the parable and slapstick mischief, which is juicy, a visible, tangible and yet inconceivable fantastic reality coexists with the reliability of a fantastic dream\" [Bauman, 1976, p. 126].\n\nIntroducing readers to his reflections on the cinema, M. Zak (1929-2011) rightly pointed out that the film Until the last minute is \"undisclosed political biography of the hero, because word-gun reduced to the level quotational journalism\" [Zak, 1976, p. 115].\n\nScreen 1975-1976 (1977, put in a set in August 1976)\n\nThis is another issue, edited by E. Bauman and G. Dolmatovskaya.\n\nXXV Congress of the Soviet Communist Party was held in February-March 1976. This Congress was one of the peaks in the \"small cult of personality\" of L.I. Brezhnev. This explains why the \"report-inspiring\" article by A. Kamshalov decorated the references to the report of the general secretary [Kamshalov, 1977, p. 28]. A. Kamshalov, in particular, didactically wrote: \"A new stage of communist construction places high demands on literature and art, including the cinema. . Our party orients writers, artists, composers, filmmakers, television and the theater workers of the fact that the rich possibilities of art, exciting persuasiveness of artistic images used for the enrichment of moral people, to improve their spiritual potential. ... The devotion to communist ideals - that is the main thing that I would like to see in the way of the worker or collective farmer, a scientist or a warrior, leader or an ordinary party building a new life\" [Kamshalov, 1977, pp. 23, 26].\n\nI think after such a \"seed\" the quotation from Brezhnev logically looked and in an article on the movies' working class subject [Korobkov, 1977, p. 48].\n\nThe communist pathos of G. Kapralov's article about working class film Prize was in the same key: \"Screen offers us a certain model, an example of how can and should be addressed sometimes some of the issues in a socialist society, where we have the party criticism and self-criticism. But this \"model\" is designed not speculative, not built artificially, but life itself is born... The story of Vasily Potapov and his team is not the last place in the chain of large and small events of everyday life that add up to the overall flow of our irresistible movement towards communism\" [Kapralov, 1977, pp. 68-69].\n\nThe cinema and Communist party functionary D. Shatsillo spared no compliments regarding romanticized film biography of one of Communist leaders - G. Ordzhonikidze (I accept) [Shatsillo, 1977, pp. 87-91].\n\nE. Bauman wrote equally rosy about another deservedly forgotten now film Time of her sons: \"This is the story of the triumph of life, the happiness of peaceful labor, the great love of his native land. ... the main idea sounds distinctly and clearly: this is the idea of man's responsibility to his country, ahead of its time\" [Bauman, 1977, p.80].\n\nAnd usually more thoughtful E. Gromov, alas, could not resist the praise of a mediocre film Earthly Love, which was shown \"a man of modern times, the era of socialist, a communist, was acutely aware of the enormous challenges that were then in front of the party and the country\" [Gromov, 1977, pp. 86-87].\n\nBut N. Sumenov (1938-2014) did not dare to sing a solemn hymn to working class drama From dawn to dusk by G. Egiazarov. Film critic rebuked this movie in edification, smoothing out conflicts and problems [Sumenov, 1977, p.75].\n\nThe rest of the annual reviews were written in a more analytical manner.\n\nFor example, V. Vilchek (1937-2006) gave an interesting analysis of the letters of moviegoers (especially on the comedy Afonya by G. Danelia), which were not only clearly marked with different levels of perception, audience analysis of the film, but also stressed that the \"naturalistic perception is a perception, dictated by lazy, consumer life experience; People just covered (truly deceiving himself) didactic reasons, they just want do not destroy their peace of minds\" [Vilchek, 1977, p.62].\n\nAs a result, V. Vilchek reasonably come to the conclusion that \"We need the concept of \"integral film\". That is, a film for everyone, able to satisfy the most different, even polar groups of the audience. It is anticipated that this film should have a multi-layer structure, so that each group of viewers might find it that searches and understands the art of one: interesting plot, the second: a fine plastic or of their idols, and others: deep philosophy, etc.\" [Vilchek, 1977, p. 63].\n\nYearbook praisedbook the film Hundred days after childhood by S. Soloviev. T. Ivanova wrote that \"the very sophistication plot of this film, the game with motifs of classical works, lurked danger: to consider the region bookish reminiscences in the frame of quite closed experiment. The filmmakers were able to overcome this danger\" [Ivanova, 1977, p. 95].\n\nA historical and romantic melodrama The Captivating Star of Happiness by V. Motyl received a positive assessment from Y. Turin (1938-2016) [Turin, 1977, pp. 96-102]. Film critic L. Rybak (1923-1988) supported screen experiment of M. Schweitzer, who, the first time in the director's biography, turned to the genre fiction parable in the film Escape of Mr. McKinley: \"This unusual movie built on extreme aesthetic principles; its action steeped in reality, this story is woven of fantastic events. ... We see something unbelievable, inconceivable from the standpoint of ordinary logic in realistic circumstances, but it is quite convincing as an artistic metaphor, true to his moral (or immoral) nature\" [Rybak, 1977, p. 105].\n\n242\n\nScreen 1976-1977 (1978, put in a set in January 1978)\n\nThis Yearbook changed one of the editors. New editors (until the last issue) became Y. Turin and G. Dolmatovskaya.\n\nOf course, the diamond jubilee of the Soviet regime (1977) and the Resolution of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee On working with creative youth (October, 1976) played a important role in Soviet film criticism process. V. Baskakov [1978, pp. 29-35] and M. Alexeev [Alexeev, 1978, p. 50] wrote about clearly and directly. N. Sumenov wrote: \"Liberation by Y. Ozerov clearly reflected as a strike force of world imperialism were broken, met on his way a monolithic multi-ethnic state of workers and peasants who defended the war the freedom and independence of their country, Lenin's motherland, the motherland of the Great October. . Soldiers of Freedom shows not only the successes but also the dramatic pages of the people's liberation struggle. . And very good episode of this film, where L.I. Brezhnev (actor E. Matveev) speaks about communism with simple Czech workers. This episode is capacious and extremely important for the expression of the author's concept of dialogue as it sums up the film as a work of political cinema\" [Sumenov, 1978, pp. 78-80].\n\nIt seems that everything has already been said in this \"critical\" passage... But, no: N. Sumenov with skillful pen of communist functionary added cold war sentence: \"Bourgeois propagandists used up a lot of pages, arguing that the national liberation struggle, the people's democratic and socialist system in Europe was planted against the will of the peoples of these countries. Accessing historical facts refutes the malicious lies. In carrying out their internationalist duty, the Soviet Army liberated from fascism, not only his country, but also the people of other European countries that have chosen the democratic path of development. Our ideological opponents, ideological means fighting against the socialist community of nations now rely on inciting nationalist sentiment. They are trying to drive a wedge between the peoples, to oppose one another nation, to split the unity of our country. That is why today is so important political picture, excitedly and earnestly preaching the ideals of proletarian internationalism. It is no exaggeration to say that internationalism becomes the main theme of the film Soldiers of Freedom, its most important task\" [Sumenov, 1978, p. 83].\n\nThe articles about Leninist films Trust [Zaitsev, 1978, pp. 84-86] and October [Pustynsky, 1978, pp. 132-133] were additional plus to Soviet anniversary.\n\nThe alternative approach to the official analysis of war films was presented in M. Zak's article. He, not fearing the religious foundation, gave the high praise for L. Shepitko's masterpiece Ascension: \"The director is harsh and intransigence in the image of suffering, intransigence in relation to the viewer's perception, which has its own thresholds. She leaves nothing behind the scenes, and the spectators run with the hero all painful path. Mythological paint gradually slides\n\n243\n\nover the screen. . the evangelical composition openly establish themselves in the frame\" [Zak, 1978, p. 68].\n\nBut M. Zak somehow confused realistic textures in the film Twenty Days Without War, typical of the director's style of A. German: \"The efforts of the director sometimes seem excessive, particularly in the field of decorative arts\" [Zak, 1978, p. 66].\n\nThe films on contemporary topics was also in focus of the Yearbook: Mimino, Own Opinion, The White Ship, Only You, Hoax and Word of Protection.\n\nA. Zorky wrote about one of the best G. Danelia's film: \"Mimino has everything which you can want in good movie: humor, honesty, simplicity, seriousness, the great script, mature craftsmanship, beautiful duet of actors\" [Zorky, 1978, p. 209].\n\nN. Savitsky quite convincingly argued that the Own Opinion \"main character is too self-confident, the winner from the start. He appeared not to study, but teach. He almost does not make mistakes, and I can't trust him. ... This film has absolutely predominant declarative tone, journalistic style, emotionally depleted\" [Savitsky, 1978, p. 96].\n\nK. Rudnicky (1920-1988) was dissatisfied with the imbalance of a characters in a film of screenwriter A. Mindadze and director V. Abdrashitov Word for Protection because \"the fate of main heroine Kostina, like a powerful magnet attracts all interest and takes in all the excitement of the audience. Conceived (and contrived!) parallel movement of the two female roles in the living reality of the film is replaced by a powerful movement of a single Kostina's drama\" [Rudnicky, 1978, p. 124].\n\nSpeaking about the melodrama Only You by I. Kheifits (1905-1995) M. Kuznetsov (1914-1980) was, in my opinion, overly didactic, emphasizing \"how important it is for our contemporaries have the own culture of senses. And this controversial, somewhat uneven, but very interesting film devoted to this area of moral life\" [Kuznetsov, 1978, p. 104].\n\nReviewing musical melodrama about the school and school children Hoax, T. Kukarkina began with praise: \"V. Menchov has chosen for his first directorial work of dynamic form of the narrative, catchy, bright, spectacular. Pop-music, beautiful person, elegant interiors, the plot tension overshadowed psychological thoroughness. The director focused on the incessant emotional impact. It is promoted and given rhythm and unique scene transitions, and the absence of general plans and panoramas. All large, brightly. And the film looks in one breath, he excites and makes empathize heroes\" [Kukarkina, 1978, p.119]. But then T. Kukarkina made the negative conclusion, in my opinion, unreasonably harsh: \"The stated problem, moral collision blurred, scattered in different semantic series, replacing the regulatory rules of ethics. ... The idea of the playwright essential to solve problems is obvious, but simplified to elementary commandments\" [Kukarkina, 1978, p.121].\n\nThe main article in the portrait gallery of the yearbook (articles about the work of actors Y. Solntseva, R. Adomaitis, I. Churikova, G. Burkov, E. Simonova) was the text of R. Yurenev. Remembering the Kuban Cossacks by I. Pyrev, film critic wrote that \"of course, all the circumstances of this picture is not shown of collective life. There was no criticisms, no objective assessment of the life difficulties. But it was fun and joyful chanting of the collective-farm labor, a new morality, friendship and ardent love in the conventions of the genre of musical comedy and operetta\" [Yurenev, 1978, p. 139]. But \"modern dramatic Pyrev's movies Our Mutual Friend, Light of Distant Star were weak, and quickly got off the screen\"[Yurenev, 1978, p. 139].\n\nR. Yurenev thought the main Pyrev's artistic achievement The Brothers Karamazov where director \"boldly sacrificed many lines, many novel ideas, focusing on the problem of realization of its main characters. And here and he showed courage, and taste, and a very deep and subtle understanding of the individual characteristics quite similar to each other actors\" [Yurenev, 1978, p. 142].\n\nScreen 1977-1978 (1979, put in a set in November 1978)\n\nScreen 1977-1978 continued the theme of the 60th anniversary of the Socialist revolutionary. A. Novogrudsky (1911-1996) wrote an article under the eloquent title Under the Sign of the October Revolution: \"Why is the bourgeois film researchers praise the first Soviet revolutionary cinema masterpieces (even emasculating their ideological content and focusing on the purely aesthetic categories)? The answer is quite simple: to build the anti-scientific scheme of \"attenuation\" of Soviet cinema, to belittle the significance of such great works as Chapaev, a trilogy about Maxim and other outstanding films, declared \"nonexistent\" creative achievements of Soviet filmmakers after 1920s. The Western cinema books repeated this false scheme with the dogmatic obstinacy pseudoscientific treatises ... Another false is the accusation of socialist realism in the canons of censorship\"[Novogrudsky, 1979, p. 28].\n\nIt is clear that the Novogrudsky's arguments look mildly, unconvincing, because the Western festival movement and Western film studies, actually rejecting the ideology of \"socialist realism\" (like the 1930s and subsequent years), always supported talented Soviet movies of post-Stalin era (including many films of M. Kalatozov, A. Konchalovsky, S. Parajanov, A. Tarkovsky, G. Chuhraj, M. Khutsiev and other masters).\n\nA. Medvedev presented his article The feat of the people, the fate of the People, which he wrote about very mediocre \"socialist realism\" films Carpathian Mountains ... by T. Levchuk and Destiny by E. Matveyev: \"Much of these works is debatable. However, I would like to emphasize the important thing in the film chronicle of the national artistic feat of new lines are written, enriching our memory, spreading its horizon\" [Medvedev, 1979, p. 46].\n\nN. Savitsky published anoter positive-boring article about the drama on the workin class topic - Feedback by V. Tregubovich [Savitsky, 1979, pp. 87-92].\n\nReflecting on the movie Call me in the distance light by S. Lubshin and G. Lavrov, E. Bauman wrote that \"the film carefully and clearly conveyed Shukshin's intonations, Shukshin's thoughts. And a huge credit for this belongs to the ensemble cast\"[Bauman, 1979, p. 102].\n\nBut Y. Turin very severely appreciated the talented drama Wounded Game (The Orphans) by N. Gubenko: \"The main character fell apart in every sense of the word into two parts: his childhood was promised a great personality, but the maturity has been deprived of concreteness, the flesh. Here the main failure of the movie. Bartenev was forty years in the present tense only eyewitness and participant in the events does not unlike Bartenev-child wounded\" [Turin, 1979, p. 97].\n\nSurprisingly, but the Screen 1977-1978 dared (and I think rightly) criticize S. Rostotsky, logged b"
