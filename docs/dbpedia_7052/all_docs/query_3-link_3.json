In a particularly impactful scene, the Chechen artillery bombards the Russian army's camp while the soldiers are in the middle of mass celebration.[3] The movie provides a unique perspective on an uncommon subject matter and showcases a rare humanity and sense of impartiality towards the different sides involved in the conflict portrayed in the story.[3]\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nEdmund Purdom as Sheik Shamil\n\nJohn Drew Barrymore as Giamal\n\nGiorgia Moll as Tatiana\n\nPierre Brice as Boris\n\nElena Zareschi as FÃ¡tima\n\nErno Crisa as Casi\n\nMassimo Girotti as Czar Alexander II\n\nMaria Grazia Spina as Alina\n\nMario Pisu as Voronzov\n\nLaura Carli as Miss Ferguson\n\nNerio Bernardi as General Rasumovsky\n\nLouis Seigner as Bibikoff, old Russian General\n\nGiuliano Gemma as Young Man at Academy (uncredited)\n\nMara Berni as Lady with White Dog\n\nLiana Del Balzo as Grandduchess, Aunt of Tsar (uncredited)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
