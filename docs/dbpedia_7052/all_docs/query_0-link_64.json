        "text": "On New Year's Eve, Russia's largest television network is to broadcast a three-hour special intended to tap into the growing nostalgia for Soviet times.\n\nThis slick tribute to Stalinist propaganda films that idealize life on the collective farm stars Russia's best-known pop singers recreating vignettes from creaky classics like the 1950 musical \"Cossacks of the Kuban.\"\n\nEveryone is sick of American movies and tired of having an inferiority complex,\" said Leonid Parfyonov, a young television star who was the co-producer of the $3 million extravaganza. \"These old Soviet films are very sentimental and immensely popular.\"\n\nThe film tribute, he said, is part of a new trend in Russian life and self-awareness. \"It's about admitting that there were things that were good,\" he said, \"that there is nothing to be ashamed of, and that we don't have any other history. What else can we reflect?\" He paused, then said, \"Why should we struggle with ourselves?\"\n\nHis question was reflected in the results of the Russian parliamentary elections this month. Nostalgia was at least partly responsible for the Communists' first-place finish. And nostalgia -- some call it amnesia -- might help a Communist or nationalist get elected President next June.\n\nAs young entertainment moguls like Mr. Parfyonov try to cash in on the trend sweeping Russian popular culture, they are also dancing around the edges of a political revival that could nip their brash, breezy capitalism in the bud.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
