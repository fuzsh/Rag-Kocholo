When the men at a Zaporogian fort learn that Moscow is sending soldiers to destroy their unit, they decide to appeal directly to Czarina Catherine.

While they talk, Ivan reveals that he would like to meet the sultan to ask if the homesick Cossacks could now return to their own country. As Ivan is being entertained by the sultan, Oxana looks toward the Danube, waiting for Andrew. When Andrew finally arrives, Prokip sees the lovers embrace and becomes so jealous that he arranges for the couple to be arrested by the Turks as spies. Soon Ivan returns home, dressed in new Turkish finery, and impresses Odarka. When they learn what has happened to Oxana and Andrew, she insists that he go to the Pasha, the local Turkish official. Thinking that Ivan's Turkish clothing is the disguise of a spy, the Pasha plans to hang him as well as Oxana and Andrew. They are all saved just in time, however, when the sultan arrives and sets them free, then orders Prokip arrested. Finally revealing his true identity, the sultan then orders that the Cossacks be allowed to return home. Following a joyous celebration, the Cossacks set sail for their homeland.\n\nLess"
