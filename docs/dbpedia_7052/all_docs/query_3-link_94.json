        "text": "- At night in a gym south of Denver, a dozen Russian Cossack dancers rehearse.\n\nSweat beads streak their faces as they gnash swords. They whirl around fiercely and, from squatting positions, snapkick their legs forward.\n\n\"Hey!\" They're giving their all after taking a big risk: snubbing their Russian government sponsors on a U.S. tour 13 months ago, and leaving their children back in Russia - on a hunch that people in materially rich America will accept them.\n\n\"To this day, I think we made a good decision,\" Stanislava Perets, 26, said confidently.\n\nBut their future is uncertain as they defy the norm for immigrants in Colorado, where the foreign-born population is growing faster than in any other state.\n\nMost immigrants here do cleaning work, drive cabs, haul boxes in warehouses, cook in restaurants or sell products - basic wage services the Colorado economy devours. Few enter immediately into the professional careers that many of them trained for abroad. That causes deep frustration, especially among Colorado's well-educated 20,000 or more Russian speakers.\n\nDepression and family strife result, social workers say.\n\nIn contrast, the Cossacks see performing as their only way into America.\n\nThis band broke away from an elite Russian troupe that traveled the world demonstrating traditional soldierly skills in skits and dances, accompanied by the three-stringed balalaika. It is superpatriotic artistry. Russian nationalists revere the Cossack culture that evolved among boisterous peasant soldiers on Russia's southern frontiers. Some Americans may have glimpsed Cossacks horseback battling in the 1962 Tony Curtis epic film\n\n\"Taras Bulba.\" The problem: On government salaries of about $40 a month in Russia, these Cossack dancers barely got by.\n\nOn Dec. 3, 1999, they were sitting around in a Florida hotel the day after their 84-member troupe completed a multicity U.S. tour.\n\nThey were taking stock, comparing America's material comfort and respect for law and order with hardship in Russia. Andrei Perets, 30, was typical. He worked three jobs in Russia - as performer, teacher and night security watchman. He hardly slept. He hardly saw his daughter.\n\nFive Cossacks initially announced they intended to stay in the United States. Others followed. Supervisors bristled. Reports of a mutiny made headlines in Moscow and Rostov, the troupe's home base on the Don River near the Black Sea. Historically, ancestors of these Cossacks often defied government control.\n\nPeasant soldiers enslaved under Russia's czars, Cossacks revolted frequently and at times were enlisted to defend Mother Russia against the Turks. The word Cossack means \"free person.\" On Russia's southern frontiers, Cossacks for centuries honed their skills riding horses, swordfighting, shooting and swilling vodka.\n\n\"We didn't want to spend our lives as slaves,\" Perets said.\n\nFrom Florida, the breakaway band of modern-day Cossacks telephoned Sergey Shadioun, 43, a former Red Army performer they knew who'd emigrated to Denver. They begged Shadioun to contact lawyers and explore how the performers could emigrate legally. Shadioun obliged, and eventually agreed to serve as president and chief choreographer for the group. He found apartments they share in Glendale. He rounded up equipment, including costumes and swords that had to be ordered from Russia.\n\nMany in Denver's Russian-speaking community are impressed, and hope the group will succeed here. \"It would be nice to have a group of wonderful performers,\" said Anna Tsesarsky, a case worker at the Jewish Family Services resettlement agency. Outsiders still looking in\n\nYet cracking mainstream Colorado as a Cossack is hard.\n\nBy day, the once-celebrated dancers are strangers driving around in newly purchased used cars. They struggle with English. They decline to talk about \"little work\" they may do to supplement what they earn performing. Basic needs are met. Each performer now lives on about $1,000 a month, Shadioun said.\n\nNearly every night, they gather at the Universal Gymnastics gym in an office park south of Denver. Shadioun arranged to rent the place after 9 p.m. The Cossacks train nightly for two intense hours in a warm yellow light, leaping around, thumping on the wooden floor, while a tape deck plays folk tunes that move them.\n\nVeronika Alimova, 21, darted away now and then last week to check on her baby, Cristina, born nearly four months ago.\n\n\"This is just the beginning,\" Alimova said, cradling Cristina. \"We hope to perform on big stages here in the future. I want to spend all my life dancing. I trained for so many years.\" A full moon shone outside as they practiced. In embroidered costumes, black boots and blue soldier caps, chanting \"Hey!\" they ignited an otherwise silent suburban nightscape of neon-lit car lots, warehouses, satellite dishes and exits.\n\nThey miss home. Stanislava Perets said she regularly phones her 7-year-old daughter, Anastasia, - left with grandparents - asking about school, promising they'll be together soon if immigration applications are approved.\n\nVeteran performer Yuriy Abramenko, 39, yearning for his wife, clings to a conviction that, among nations of the world, \"America is best. Beautiful. Every citizen respects the law. This is a country of immigrants.\"\n\nAll these Cossacks need, he said, \"is a chance to show people our spirit.\" Nearby, blue television light blinked inside airy pastel homes of the Coloradans the Cossacks hope to reach. The group performed 13 times in December, but the venues were small.\n\nNow, Russian Cafe owner Eugene Valershteyn has discovered the dancers. He hired them to perform Saturday nights at his red-walled Russian Cafe at Orchard Road and University Boulevard.\n\n\"They can't live without dancing\" Well-heeled Americans are his main clientele. At a recent performance, Americans watched raptly, clapping, some standing on chairs. Russian emigres Olga and Michael Novikov happened to be sitting in the cafe that night. The Novikovs marveled as the Cossacks danced, nearly kicking tables with their boots. Olga had seen them years ago in a large Moscow theater. She cringed to think how they must feel to perform in a tiny restaurant.\n\nWhen she saw their passionate faces, she understood. \"They can't live without dancing,\" she said. \"It is love.\""
