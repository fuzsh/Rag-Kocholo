        "text": "Russia blamed bureaucracy rather than censorship for a decision to halt the release of a Hollywood movie that tells the fictional story of U.S. troops rescuing a Russian president from a Kremlin coup.\n\nThe thriller \"Hunter Killer\" was due to hit screens in Russia on Nov. 1, but the release was pulled, prompting allegations from Kremlin critics that it was censored because its plot undermines President Vladimir Putin's strongman image.\n\nLast year, Russia banned screenings of the dark comedy \"The Death of Stalin\" after officials said its portrayal of Kremlin infighting in the wake of the death of the Soviet leader was disrespectful towards victims of Stalin's purges.\n\nThe Culture Ministry was quoted by Russian media as saying\" Hunter Killer\" had not received authorisation because a satisfactory copy of the film had not been submitted to Russia's state film archive in time. The ministry's press office did not answer calls on Friday seeking comment.\n\nThe film, starring Gerard Butler and Gary Oldman, features a plot in which Russia's president is taken hostage by his own defense minister.\n\nA Message from The Moscow Times:\n\nDear readers,\n\nWe are facing unprecedented challenges. Russia's Prosecutor General's Office has designated The Moscow Times as an \"undesirable\" organization, criminalizing our work and putting our staff at risk of prosecution. This follows our earlier unjust labeling as a \"foreign agent.\"\n\nThese actions are direct attempts to silence independent journalism in Russia. The authorities claim our work \"discredits the decisions of the Russian leadership.\" We see things differently: we strive to provide accurate, unbiased reporting on Russia.\n\nWe, the journalists of The Moscow Times, refuse to be silenced. But to continue our work, we need your help.\n\nYour support, no matter how small, makes a world of difference. If you can, please support us monthly starting from just $2. It's quick to set up, and every contribution makes a significant impact.\n\nBy supporting The Moscow Times, you're defending open, independent journalism in the face of repression. Thank you for standing with us.\n\nOnce\n\nMonthly\n\nAnnual\n\nContinue\n\nNot ready to support today?\n\nRemind me later.\n\n√ó\n\nRemind me next month\n\nRemind me\n\nThank you! Your reminder is set.\n\nWe will send you one reminder email a month from now. For details on the personal data we collect and how it is used, please see our Privacy Policy."
