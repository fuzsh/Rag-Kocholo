Although the prerevolutionary Russian film industry had been virtually destroyed by the depredations of the World War, Revolution, and Civil War, by the end of the first decade of Soviet power, Soviet cinema was renowned the world over. Film historians in fact consider this period the Golden Age of Soviet cinema, pointing to the achievements of such geniuses as Sergei Eisenstein, Vsevolod Pudovkin, Lev Kuleshov, Dziga Vertov, and Aleksandr Dovzhenko. Yet how much is known about this Golden Age? The traditional historiographical view of the twenties is as a period of relative political and economic freedom that the ascendancy of Stalin and the initiation of the First Five Year Plan abruptly ended. According to this interpretation, in the chaotic years following the Revolution, the avant-garde dominated until the arts were forced under state control. Cinema has also been interpreted this way, in part because directors like Pudovkin, Vertov, and Eisenstein, who were indeed innovators, are the only directors with whom even Russian and Soviet specialists are familiar. This idealized picture of Soviet society during the twenties is only partially correct and has been the subject of fairly extensive historiographic revision in recent years—a reevaluation which has not, however, included cinema.1 Can the encroaching authoritarianism on the \"cinema front\"—as it was called in the battle jargon of the time—be explained away as yet another manifestation of Stalin's will to totally dominate every aspect of Soviet life? Although it would be naive to undervalue the role of the Party in this or any other period of Soviet history, the \"Stalin Revolution\" was responding to a malaise in Soviet society and enjoyed \"grass-roots\" support, as true in the cinema world as in other spheres. Soviet cinema presents a unique opportunity for studying the dynamics of change in Soviet society in this pivotal period. Cinema is more than a cultural phenomenon—it is also an industry requiring a fiscal base, sophisticated equipment, and technical expertise. A writer can create his world on a scrap of\n\nviii\n\nPreface\n\npaper; indeed, the chronic paper shortages of the twenties have been advanced—not entirely lightheartedly—as the basis for the popularity of poetry over the novel in this period. A filmmaker, on the other hand, cannot realize his artistic vision without film stock, cameras, lights (and large quantities of electricity), and a horde of trained technical personnel, not to speak of the projectors, screens, electrical generators, and projectionists needed for the finished film to reach its audience. Therefore, to a much greater degree than any other art, cinema had to engage in a struggle for money and material in order to survive. Structure This work is conceived as a history of Soviet cinema from its inception in 1918 through the end of the silent period, concentrating on the critical years 1924-30. In order to bring the complex, often subtle (and essential) interconnections in developments into the sharpest possible relief, institutional changes, theoretical and polemical issues, and the films themselves are discussed in more or less chronological order. While the topics under consideration would have lent themselves to compartmentalized discussion, ocherki style, the inherent drama of the story—and its historical significance—would have been lost. Sources Choice of sources is critical in determining the character of any study. Because this is a look at the film industry \"from below,\" I eschewed reviews and articles in the general press, although cultural publications like New Spectator, The Life of Art, On Literary Guard, Revolution and Culture, Lef, and New Lef were reviewed. In my year of research in Moscow, I read nearly every cinema book and film journal from the twenties from cover to cover. I was privileged to work in the Central State Archive of Literature and Art (TsGALI), and to be the first Westerner granted access to film archives from the period, primarily those fondy dealing with Sovkino and the Association of Revolutionary Cinematography (ARK). I also viewed about one hundred rare silent films at the Ail-Union State Institute of Cinematography in Moscow and the Pacific Film Archive in Berkeley. The omission of current Soviet monographs and articles from the notes and bibliography comes not from lack of familiarity but because their usefulness is limited due to the still considerable politicization of cinema scholarship. Most students of the Soviet Union run into roadblocks and blind alleys in the quest for sources. A limitation not imposed by the vagaries of archival access politics is the concentration herein on full-length feature films (primarily fiction) from the Russian Republic. Although the more widely distributed\n\nPreface\n\nix\n\nnonfiction feature films and films from the non-Russian republics are discussed, mainstream cinema culture, the subject of this work, was fictional and centered in the RSFSR, so the impact of these omissions is slight. Other omissions are not deliberate and carry potentially serious implications; it can only be hoped that major errors of interpretation have been avoided. Leningrad filmmakers pursued a consistently independent course, and although I had no special trouble obtaining films made in the Leningrad studios, I was consistently denied access to periodicals and archival materials pertaining to them. I was also forbidden the archive of the Society of Friends of Soviet Cinema (ODSK), an organization which I had considered the least important of the period, but about which judgment must now be reserved. All films which were denied me are indicated in the text. Illustrations are from Cinema Week (1924) and Soviet Screen (1928), the majority from the latter. Translation and Transliteration In the hope of making an admittedly specialized work more accessible to the non-Russian speaker, references in the text are in English (followed by the Russian in the first citation only). Titles in the notes and bibliography, however, are exclusively in Russian. Transliteration is the bane of all scholars using Russian language sources. I have followed the Library of Congress system, with two exceptions—in the text, the soft sign (') in personal names has been omitted, and \"Eizenshtein\" has been rendered the usual \"Eisenstein.\" Acknowledgments Thanks are due to Terence Emmons, for believing that a \"real\" historian could study film; to Edward J. Brown, for forcing me to prove my thesis to his satisfaction; to Sofia Donskaya, for providing answers to arcane questions about Soviet culture; to Stanley B. Youngblood, for being as critical a lay reviewer as one could hope to find; and to Steven Kovacs, for introducing me to the possibilities of the subject. The bulk of the research upon which this work is based was made possible by a grant from the International Research and Exchanges Board (IREX) and the USSR Ministry of Higher Education. I am especially grateful for the assistance I received in Moscow from the All-Union State Institute of Cinematography, the Central State Archive of Literature and Art, and the Lenin Library. Finally, I am indebted to the Pacific Film Archive of the Art Museum of the University of California, Berkeley—and especially to Linda Artel—for so generously sharing its collection of silent films; and to Wojciech Zalewski and the Stanford University Libraries, for obtaining rare materials for me.\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK\n\nPreface to the Paperback Edition The preceding words were written in Palo Alto, California in December 1984, literally on the eve of the great turning point in the Soviet Union—and in Soviet cinema studies. My hopes for the recognition of this field as a significant area of scholarly endeavor have been realized to a greater extent than I dared believe possible. While this is not the place for an encyclopedic accounting of recent work on the first fifty years of Russian and Soviet cinema, it does seem appropriate to draw attention to a few of my colleagues' more outstanding accomplishments. The indefatigable Richard Taylor, who may truly be said to have inaugurated the reevaluation of early Soviet cinema in 1979 with his book The Politics of the Soviet Cinema, 1917-1929, has earned the debt of cinema scholars in many ways. His magisterial document collection The Film Factory: Russian and Soviet Cinema in Documents, 1896-1939 (1988, in collaboration with Ian Christie) is arguably the most important of these. If that achievement were not more than enough, Taylor has also translated a volume of Eisenstein and written several insightful articles on the cinema of the early '30s, all of which have contributed to our understanding of a period even less investigated than the '20s. Vance Kepley, Jr., who has written prolifically on the early avant-garde (and indeed, still professes partiality to the pantheon), has expanded the boundaries of the conventional through his superb biography of Oleksandr Dovzhenko, In the Service of the State (1986) as well as through his studies of early Soviet film education and cinema in workers' clubs. Other recent books of note include François Albera and Roland Cosandey, Boris Barnet (1985); Viada Petric, Constructivism in Film (1987); Judith Mayne, Kino and the Woman Question (1989); François Albera, Ekaterina Khokhlova, and Valerie Posner, Koulechov et les siens (1990); and Nicholas Galichenko, Glasnost—Soviet Cinema Responds, edited by Robert Allington (1991). Works in press which will contain important new material on this period include Taylor and Christie's Inside the Film Factory and Anna Lawton's The Red Screen, based on the conference she organized at the Kennan Institute in 1986, the first in this country devoted to the subject of Soviet cinema. Books on the way\n\nxii\n\nPreface to the Paperback Edition\n\ninclude Peter Kenez's study of cinema in the Stalin era, Richard Taylor's history of the '30s, and my own work on the popular cinema of the New Economic Policy period. This selective overview includes only works by \"Western\" scholars. Perhaps the most gratifying change over the past few years has been the opportunity to work closely with Soviet cinema scholars, who are now engaged in a number of exciting projects, particularly at VNIIK, the All-Union Institute for Cinema Research in Moscow. Expanded opportunities for conference participation have been invaluable, and the 1990 British Inter-University History Film Consortium Conference \"Soviet Cinema: Continuity and Change\" (organized by Richard Taylor and Derek Spring) is a case in point. Having the opportunity to draw upon the collective knowledge of Maya Turovskaya, Ekaterina Khokhlova, Yuri Tsivian, Viktor Listov, Leonid Kozlov, Mikhail Yampolsky, and Rashid Yangirov adds immeasurably to the ongoing processes of investigation and discovery. If I were writing this book today, there are a few places in which I would be more judicious in my conclusions or more charitable in my acknowledgments, and there are more places in which I would strive for more graceful prose. Yet there is a story here which has not been told elsewhere in all its gritty and impassioned detail. It still needs to be heard, because despite the efflorescence of Soviet studies in the '80s, we have few studies of reasonably ordinary people struggling as best they could to deal with extraordinary times. Soviet society is once again a society in transition, and the cultural and economic politics of the '20s (in large part the subject of this book) have never been quite as relevant as they are at present. The resemblance between the tensions of freedom and poverty then and now are uncanny, and the \"lessons\" that may be derived from this story of institutional and ideological conflict are certainly not restricted to the cultural arena, let alone the purely cinematic. It gives me great pleasure to acknowledge the assistance I have received in bringing Soviet Cinema in the Silent Era back into print. Peter Kenez has been the book's most fervent champion, but I would also like to thank Anna Lawton, Richard Stites, and Richard Taylor for their support. Thanks are due my editor at UMI Research Press, Bradley Taylor, for his help in the process of transferring the rights. It was Vladimir Padunov who first proposed the idea of a reprint to me, and so this edition is dedicated to him. Burlington, Vermont January 1991\n\nIntroduction The history of the Soviet film industry in the twenties may be described as the inexorable move from organizational chaos to total centralization and from aesthetic radicalism to Socialist Realism. How these twin objectives were achieved in little more than a decade, and why these ends seemed desirable, is the subject of this study. It is a convoluted tale of warring interest groups set against a backdrop of political, social, and economic upheaval. The film industry may be viewed as a microcosm of Soviet society, but its unique configurations should also be recognized. The first confused years after the Revolution, roughly the period between 1917 and 1921, saw the end of World War I, a great Civil War, and a terrible famine. Misery was widespread, but so was revolutionary enthusiasm. It was at this time that cinema was first seized upon as the art of the Soviet future. Political radicals, who supported the aims of the Revolution whether or not they were Bolsheviks, were drawn to cinema because they considered it, unlike theater, an art of the people, a mass medium. They embraced it with special fervor because unlike printed mass media, cinema required minimal literacy, a critical factor in a country where the illiteracy rate was extremely high (75-80 percent). Cinema was rarely considered a vehicle for propaganda even by the most political of its supporters except in the broadest sense, as a cultural tool for the enlightenment of the masses. Artistic radicals were also drawn to cinema but considered it revolutionary for fundamentally different reasons. Cinema for them was a new art, an art with few ties to the corrupted culture of the tsarist past, a technological art, an abstract art. Yet from the beginning, the artistic left in cinema was more diverse than it has been portrayed. It was divided into those who supported fiction films with weakly developed narratives and those—the most radical—who rejected the fiction film altogether, advocating the nonfiction film in its place. While the importance of the former faction would persist, the influence of the latter had all but ended by 1924 as revolutionary romanticism was eschewed by young film activists more intent on rebuilding a\n\nxiv\n\nIntroduction\n\nshattered industry than indulging in sloganeering and the writing of aesthetic platforms. Nonetheless, the artistic debates of this first phase of Soviet cinema lay the groundwork for developments in the future. Throughout the decade, critics and directors struggled to formulate aesthetic principles for a fiction film which would both appeal to the mass audience while exhibiting distinctly Soviet characteristics. What \"Soviet\" meant was a divisive issue in the polemics of the silent film era, whether the subject was the role of the professional movie actor, the shortage of suitable scripts, or the importance of narrative realism in cinema. With the end of the Civil War, Lenin decided that the draconian state control of the economy known as War Communism should be abandoned in favor of what came to be known as the New Economic Policy (NEP). Inaugurated in 1921, NEP meant a return to a limited free market and a toleration of bourgeois specialists and fellow travellers. Although cinema had been nationalized in 1919 and remained under state control during NEP, NEP in cinema led to the reopening of private theaters and more importantly, to the return of the old specialists to filmmaking. As the economy slowly improved as a result of NEP, the state cinema enterprise Goskino was able to import foreign films in greater quantities, thereby satisfying the demands of the commercial theaters, even though domestic film production still was virtually nonexistent. In 1924, with the economy stabilized, Goskino became the object of intensive critical scrutiny. As a result, Goskino was replaced by Sovkino, a joint stock company with a considerably broader mandate and a sounder financial base (although it was undercapitalized by Western standards). Sovkino, which was run by Party members of long standing, quickly established itself as the enemy of enthusiastic—but inexperienced—young filmmakers, whether they supported the fiction or nonfiction film, whether they looked upon cinema as an intellectual art, a cultural-educational tool for the rural masses, or something in between. The enforced inactivity on the cinema front had created a pent-up demand for filmmaking, a demand that Sovkino consistently thwarted by backing the massive importation of foreign films and the limitation of Soviet films to a few large budget extravaganzas, made by established \"bourgeois\" directors. The rationale behind Sovkino's policy was a purely economic one. Since the Party had made it abundantly clear that little fiscal (or even moral) support for the film industry would be forthcoming, Sovkino had to look out for its own interests. Its administrators argued that foreign films were what the public wanted to see—thus guaranteeing good returns at the box office—and that Russian costume dramas appealed not only to the home audience, but also to that in the West, thus maximizing the marketability of Soviet-produced films. Sovkino justified its favoritism to the \"old specialists\" by arguing that without\n\nIntroduction\n\nxv\n\nthem the infant Soviet film industry did not have enough experienced personnel to sustain its development—though it could not deny that there was an abundance of talent among the young. So while novice directors of various political and artistic persuasions did make movies under Sovkino's aegis, the constant struggle for the means to do so turned aesthetic positions into weapons in a power struggle. Canonizing the fiction or nonfiction film, acted or nonacted, realistic or avant-garde, seemed to be a way of ensuring access to funding for future projects. Because of this, aesthetic debates became connected to institutional developments to a quite remarkable degree. While Sovkino's justification for its \"line\" was a reasonable one—the films of \"revolutionary\" young Soviet directors were proven time and again to be unprofitable, if justly admired by the critics—it is easy to imagine the resentment that this policy caused. A filmworker did not have to be politically active or particularly radical to wonder what had happened to the aims of the Revolution during the \"Thermidor\" of NEP, and Sovkino became the central antagonist in many group conflicts. In fact, the history of the film industry in this period is one of conflict—between insiders and outsiders, the young and the established, the educated and the half-educated. Yet another important aspect of the conflict was the bureaucratic struggle between Sovkino and the Commissariat of Enlightenment, the department of the government under whose nominal control cinema affairs fell. Furthermore, the relationship among the studios, the cinema press, and the Association of Revolutionary Cinematography (ARK, the chief professional organization) was complex and interconnected. What was the role of the Party in these internecine struggles? Certainly, no one position can be attributed to the Party in the twenties, for Party members among filmworkers ran the gamut from aesthetic rightists, like Sovkino's I. P. Trainin, to political leftists, like Nikolai Lebedev, the founder of ARK. The truth of this may best be indicated by the fact that although the Association of Revolutionary Cinematography was often described as being iconoclastic and apolitical, its membership in this period included a significant number of Party members (40 percent).1 While the Party did use cinema as propaganda during the Civil War, with the advent of NEP, its attention was turned to rebuilding the economy, and even before the death of Lenin in 1924, to the power struggle for control of the Party. By 1927, the right wing of the Party (supporters of NEP and the reconciliation with old specialists) seemed to emerge victorious, since the Left Opposition had been decisively defeated and its leader Trotskii ousted from the Party. Yet almost immediately following his victory over the Left, Stalin announced his plans to abandon NEP (and the coexistence with bourgeois specialists) and to forge ahead with rapid industrialization and full-scale\n\nχ vi\n\nIntroduction\n\ncollectivization. Just as cinema had been seen as a useful tool during the Civil War, so now it was seen as a useful tool in the class war known as the \"cultural revolution\" which accompanied the First Five Year Plan. This renewed attention to cinema, which began in late 1927 as the Party was laying its plans for the industrialization campaign, occurred at a time when the malaise in the film industry was all but overwhelming. From the point of view of the industry rank-and-file, NEP had not worked. They were not willing to proceed toward socialism \"at a snail's pace\" (in the words of the Rightist leader Bukharin); they wanted to seize control of the studios. Yet the crisis in cinematography was more than just a crisis of means. It was also a crisis of revolutionary faith, which helps explain the fervor with which many filmworkers embraced the tenets of the cultural revolution. While it cannot be denied that Stalin's decision to co-opt the policies of the Left had, of course, complicated political motivations, conditions and attitudes in Soviet society that had been developing throughout the twenties came to their grimly logical conclusion with the changes instituted by the Party. The film industry is an ideal context in which to examine the development of Soviet society in this decade. It was a cultural phenomenon, which allows us the opportunity to compare the aesthetic debates in cinema with those in the other arts. It was an industry, which made it subject to the ebbs and flows of the national economy. It was an institution, the personnel of which—both leaders and cadres—were profoundly affected by political and social currents. But perhaps most importantly, the film industry provides us with the rare opportunity to see Soviet citizens who were not political figures as participants in the turbulent events of the twenties.\n\n1\n\nBeginnings (1918-23) The first film organization of the new Soviet government was the Cinema Subsection of the Extracurricular Section of the Commissariat of Enlightenment, formed in 1918 and headed by Lenin's wife, Ν. Κ. Krupskaia. In March 1918 cinema committees were created by both the Moscow and Petrograd Soviets to deal not only with ideological problems, but also with the more pressing practical ones, like halting the flow of equipment and personnel from Moscow or trying to obtain enough electricity to keep the theaters running.1 The attitude of the government toward nationalization of the industry was as yet confused, but in any case, it was powerless to halt the dismantling of the studios. Electricity was in even shorter supply than films, and under these circumstances, it is easily imagined that viewing conditions were very difficult.2 Amazingly, by mid-1918 enough film stock had been scraped together, from the blackmarket or through a process of re-using positive stock by reemulsification, to begin the first Soviet productions—short propaganda films called agitki which were shown around the country on agit-trains.3 The film industry, such as it was, was nationalized on August 27,1919, and placed under the control of Narkompros, the Commissariat of Enlightenment,4 but the Commissariat lacked the power to enforce the government's order. The ramifications of nationalization would not be felt for some years. The Civil War and After The year 1919 was one of bitter hardship, yet there was still film work done in Moscow despite extreme cold and hunger. An example of this inexplicable urge to make movies regardless of conditions was a film by the Rus studio, Polikushka, to be discussed below.5 But Polikushka, based on Lev Tolstoi's story, was a rare fiction film, for until the end of the Civil War and the establishment of a mixed economy with the New Economic Policy (NEP), almost all films made were short agit-films for use at the front. Few of these are\n\n2\n\nBeginnings\n\nextant, but they provided good technical training for a number of cameramen, and important directors like Lev Kuleshov and Dziga Vertov got their start in movies making Civil War agit-films and newsreels. (Sergei Eisenstein was also on the agit-trains, but as a poster artist, not filmmaker.) The end of the Civil War and the beginnings of the limited private enterprise of the New Economic Policy did not, of course, lead to the immediate flourishing of cinema. Most experts had fled, taking their equipment with them; every scrap of raw film stock had been used and reused; theaters and studios had decayed.6 With famine (especially bad in 1921), the rebellion at Kronstadt, and economic collapse, film production could hardly seem to anyone to be of special importance, least of all to the harassed Party. Huge sums of foreign currency or gold would be required to import the necessary materials. Moreover, the making and showing of movies required electricity, in woefully short supply in the cities and nonexistent in most of the country. Halfhearted attempts in 1921-22 to ensure cinema's self-sufficiency failed, and at the end of 1922 the Council of People's Commissars authorized the creation of Goskino, the Central State Photo-Cinema Enterprise, which was based on the former VFKO, the Photo-Cinema Section of the Commissariat of Enlightenment. On paper, Goskino had a distribution monopoly in order to earn money for production,7 but the organization's uncertain situation was not helped by its competition for films and materials with other Soviet organizations, particularly Sevzapkino, Rus, and Proletkino in the Russian Republic, and VUFKU and Goskinprom Gruzii in the Ukraine and Georgia, respectively. In 1918, the government had been bilked out of one million gold rubles in an attempt to get film equipment, an experience which made Goskino administrators wary of further foreign dealings.8 Reinforcing this reluctance, the foreign films Goskino imported were ridiculed not only for faulty ideology but also for being a bad bargain. These twin concerns of sound ideology and fiscal shrewdness would prove troublesome to Goskino and its successors. Bourgeois Remnants (Cinema Life) By 1922, with the establishment of Goskino, there were signs of revival in the film world. A few journals had appeared. Yet one would never imagine from looking at the first issue of Cinema Life (Kino-zhizn'), published in May 1922, that there had ever been a revolution. Cinema Life featured photo layouts of prerevolutionary stars and had advertisements for lipstick, face powder, and medical remedies. It was a pulp movie magazine, designed for the audience of \"Hottentots\" who wanted to see The Human Beast (Chelovek-zver') and The Woman Who Invented Love (Zhenshchina kotoraia izobrela liubov'), both starring the glamorous prerevolutionary film star Vera Kholodnaia.\n\nBeginnings\n\n3\n\nAlthough Cinema Life was supposed to be a \"weekly,\" its second issue did not appear until September 1922, four months later. The cover still featured the late, lamented Vera Kholodnaia, and the content was basically the same, but the editorial, amusingly enough, claimed that Russian cinema should fill a propaganda function. It also deplored the conversions of movie theaters to \"legitimate\" theaters, since theaters served the NEP bourgeoisie and could not be as forceful a propaganda vehicle as cinema.9 Yet later in this same issue we read that the public only wanted to see Vera Kholodnaia.10 Indeed, who else was there to see? Soviet productions were few and not very interesting, but by October 1922, thanks to the New Economic Policy and despite inflation, a few foreign movies began appearing on the commercial screen in Moscow.11 The big hit of the year was a picture that the Russian star Ivan Mozhukhin made abroad, Child of the Carnival (Dit'ia karnavala).12 The situation in Petrograd was bleaker; Cinema Life's correspondent noted that the same movies were running over and over, since there were as yet no private theaters in the city. The best movies went to the privately owned city theaters, such as those in Moscow, so viewers in the provinces clamored for the new pictures, the \"hits\" (boeviki) to no avail.13 This was the first hint of the chronic distribution problem which would plague the industry throughout the twenties. Cinema Life was obviously not a socially responsible publication born of the Revolution. It was a survival from the previous era, and it terminated in March 1923, after less than a year of sporadic output. While the exact circumstances of its demise are unclear, it seems unlikely that it was shut down by the authorities—rampant inflation would have been enough to force its closure. Moreover, in these early years of genuine revolutionary enthusiasm, Cinema Life was more than a bit out of touch with the times. One of its last issues featured advertisements for movies with \"colossal mass scenes\" and \"shooting among wild beasts,\" as well as the promise of a questionnaire for readers on the burning topic of the day: \"Romanticism or the Detective Story?\"14 While this undoubtedly interested some viewers, hopeful young filmmakers entertained loftier notions of the place of cinema in a socialist society. There had indeed been a revolution, though its implications for cinema were not always clear. The Leftists The Cinema Constructivists When one thinks of Soviet culture in the early twenties, one does not think of a magazine like Cinema Life, but of mass street theater, futurist poets, and constructivist art and architecture. This tendency was expressed in cinema\n\n4\n\nBeginnings\n\nthrough the constructivist journal Cinema-photo (Kino-fot), which first appeared in August 1922. Aleksei Gan, the constructivist critic, was the journal's editor and the acknowledged leader of a loose group known as the cinema-constructivists, which seemed to consist of anyone who at one time or another wrote for Cinema-photo. In any case, Gan alone could make noise enough for many, and he immediately established his journal at the forefront of the artistic avant-garde with his first editorial, \"Cinema and Cinematography\" (\"Kinematograf i kinematografiia\"). In Gan's view, cinematography under Soviet power must be entirely new. \"Kinematograf (an obsolete word for cinema—replaced by kino) was, on the other hand, the art of the past, living photography, filmed theater, a tool of capitalism. The cinema of the future was inseparable from technology, both to be at the service of the first proletarian government.15 Gan saw cinema as anti-art, part of the veritable abolition of art in the machine age, and trumpeted this notion throughout the brief and boisterous life of Cinema-photo. For the constructivists, cinema was the quintessentially modern art: \"Between cinema and the twentieth century there is an equal sign,\" cinema having the \"power of the machine.\" (Such rhetoric was typical of the enthusiasms of the movement.)16 If cinema were the art of the future, then what was the art of the past, and what should its fate be? This too concerned the Cinema-photo \"group.\" Bourgeois art was a passive appreciation of beauty, a product of individualism and an addiction to cottage industry (kustarnichestvo, in this case alluding to private studios). Although the Revolution would eventually revolutionize all art, according to these cinema avant-gardists, cinema was in particular danger from the depredations of the bourgeoisie. Since theater was dying, the bourgeoisie, still a powerful force, wanted to co-opt cinema as its own. To these radical leftists on the cinema front, Soviet cinema would be agitcinema, but this did not mean propagandistic cinema in any but the loosest sense. It would stand in bold contrast to bourgeois cinema, free of static theatrics, symbolism, or fantasy. It would be dynamic treatment of \"only the most real, the most contemporary material.\"Thanks to the Revolution, cinema had reached, like all the arts, the stage where it was either \"revolutionary\" or \"reactionary.\" The terms \"high\" and \"low\" art no longer had any meaning.17 Because of their antagonism to anything \"bourgeois,\" the Cinemaphotoists were extremely concerned about the effect of NEP on the nascent film industry. A mixed economy in their opinion could only be bad. New cinema must be constructed on socialist principles, and the fate of art (since cinema was its vanguard) hinged on the success of cinema activists in battling the dark forces of private enterprise.18 Aleksei Gan and his followers believed that \"private enterprise\" had infiltrated the Commissariat of Enlightenment and was already adversely\n\nBeginnings\n\n5\n\naffecting cinema.19 Believing these \"moles\" more dangerous than the obvious threat NEPmen posed, the Cinema-photoists adopted a militaristic jargon appropriate to the battle they saw raging: Be firm and courageous, believe, for not all have enough courage, not all have enough faith, under the temptations of NEP, many leave. But of those who remain, from those who enter, comes a real cinema-army, an army of iron will and great knowledge. Let the army forge ahead, let the army believe in itself, in its work, in the idea of precise cinematography and victory. The army will conquer.20\n\nThe \"army\" had to fight against the old \"specialists\" who supported the old ways, as well as for material needs.21 This resentment against specialists and \"fellow travellers\" surfaced in the other arts, and indeed, in all aspects of Soviet society during NEP, but the question of poverty assumed an importance for the cinema that cannot be overstressed. Writers can still write in times of need. Filmmakers cannot make movies. The competition for raw materials became a struggle for artistic survival during the twenties. With this in mind, the fanaticism of the Cinema-photoists and those to follow becomes easier to comprehend. In October 1922, a manifesto appeared in Cinema-photo that is worth reproducing in full since it vividly illustrates the estrangement of this avantgarde group not only from NEP society, but also from the cinema community. We know that our comrades do not hear us. We know that the citizenry in whose midst we live do not love us. But we directly and steadfastly go about our business. Tomorrow 1,000 Russian and foreign fiction films could appear. The day after tomorrow, dozens of film journals. It is not terrible for us, for our business is the business of a culture being born in which cinema does not occupy last place. What will the new art-cinema pictures do? They will poison with putrid breath the broad masses and enrich the cinema businessmen. What will the film journals do in the hands of cinema junk dealers, cinema gout-sufferers, and cinema speculators? They will muddy the already dirty waters of senile cinematography and trample the fresh shoots on the young plants of our cinematography. Comrades, build. The hour of new battle advances. We need a blow. With the first number of Cinema-photo, we struck at the moldy comforts of cinema-artspeculation. With the fifth, we strike at the skulls of gout-sufferers and paralytics, who are trying with all their strength to protect the ulcer of old cinematography. Comrades, build. We will fight!22\n\n6\n\nBeginnings\n\nThe Cinema-photoists became the champions of the director who most closely typified their ideals, Dziga Vertov. Just as Cinema-photo was the most belligerently \"leftist\" of all cinema journals, so Vertov was the most vociferous and dogmatic of all Soviet silent film directors. He fought against the fiction film throughout his career and he represented the radical fringe group of modern art. To most, he was undeniably an artist, yet he himself abjured the very idea of art. Vertov had shot newsreels during the Civil War and was now engaged in producing his Cinema Truth (Kino-pravda) newsreel series. Vertov's well-known philosophy being that the mechanical eye of the camera was truer than the human eye, he called his production collective the Cinemaeyes (Kinoki). Cinema-photo editor Aleksei Gan was a particular admirer of Vertov's work, for in it he recognized the director's devotion to the contemporary, to fixing the details of the new way of life,23 an intrinsic part of Gan's own notion of modern \"art.\" Vertov contributed a characteristic article to Cinema-photo: a denunciation of those sybarites who called themselves \"documentarists\" but nonetheless received commissions from the Photo-Cinema Section of the Commissariat of Enlightenment (VFKO) and expected such luxuries as a car, a regular cameraman, a laboratory, and even film.24 It is indicative of the relative tolerance of the times that a radical journal like Cinema-photo also offered a forum for Lev Kuleshov, the \"father\" of the Soviet fiction film. Kuleshov shared the revolutionary enthusiasm and some of the ideas of Gan's group, but not their machine-age jargon and their rejection of art. Kuleshov agreed with the Cinema-photoists that cinema was the art of the future. He found the other contemporary arts foundering, dilettantish, and hopelessly divorced from contemporary life; cinema on the other hand was absolutely specific—in time, space, organization, and material.25 Thus far, there is not much to distinguish him from the \"leftists.\" But Kuleshov had distinctly original traits. He was a great admirer of the American movie—particularly the detective film—as maligned then as now among \"serious\" film lovers. \"High brows\" explained the success of these pictures with the mass viewer as evidence of the public's poor taste, but Kuleshov, with his remarkable instinct for what is cinematographic, realized that the key to the perennial success of these films was their dynamism. As he wrote in \"Amerikanshchina\" (which Ronald Levaco has aptly translated as \"Americanitis\")26: \"For cinematography, there is no more harmful appearance of literariness than psychologism, that is, the external inactivity of the plot [siuzhet, sometimes translated as plot-theme].\" Did American cinema achieve dynamism simply through choice of \"active\" subject matter? Kuleshov's answer (which he had articulated somewhat earlier but which achieved fame through this essay) had enormous impact on the history of cinema. It marked\n\nBeginnings\n\n7\n\nthe beginning of Russian \"montage\" theory, which Kuleshov, ironically enough, called \"American montage.\" Montage means editing or cutting. All films are edited; that is, made of shots and scenes spliced together. Kuleshov did not, of course, invent editing, nor was he the first to practice it for artistic effect. He was, rather, the articulator and elaborator of the idea, being, like Vertov, a director-theorist, a peculiarly Soviet phenomenon. The essence of his theory is this: One must search for the organizing basis of cinematography, not within the limits of the shot, but in the changing of these shots... the essence of cinema, its means of achieving the maximum impression, is montage.27\n\nKuleshov was cautious about what NEP would mean for cinema. He was not as negative as others who wrote for Cinema-photo, because he believed that the cinema situation would improve with or without NEP, since it could not have gotten much worse. Yet he feared the renewed development of large commercial firms which would attract speculators and restrict experimentation because of the need to make a profit. Even in these days of cruelly limited resources, Kuleshov spoke out strongly in favor of experimentation. He felt that it could be accomplished economically and was vital for the development of a Soviet film art: Experiments are now extremely necessary for cinematography. This is most essential and valuable The experiment for an honorable cinematographer is more important than bread.28\n\nComing from Kuleshov, this was not hyperbole, for no one could deny that his collective was totally devoted to filmmaking, no matter the hardship. He himself had begun cinema work in 1916 as a set designer for Evgenii Bauer, a director with the Khanzhankov studio. In 1919-20 Kuleshov shot agit-films, helped organize GTK, the state film school, and founded his own collective, which included his wife, the actress Aleksandra Khokhlova, the future directors Vsevolod Pudovkin and Boris Barnet, and actors Sergei Podobed, Sergei Komarov, and Vladimir Fogel.29 Kuleshov's most famous montage experiment was the one known as the \"Mozhukhin effect.\" He took a single shot of the prerevolutionary star Mozhukhin and cut it with shots of different objects, which caused viewers to believe that the actor's expression was changing.30 To offer training in his theory of the actor-model (akter-naturshchik), which required rigorous physical discipline, Kuleshov had the collective stage \"films without film,\" sketches done in the cinematographic style since there was no film stock for\n\n8\n\nBeginnings\n\nshooting. Kuleshov and Khokhlova remembered that these presentations were well attended despite ticket prices of 10-30,000 rubles.31 As such prices indicate, inflation was ravaging Soviet society. The last issue of Cinema-photo, which appeared in early 1923, cost 350 rubles. Gan understandably enough viewed the New Year gloomily. There was still a dearth of trained personnel, little equipment, and no relief in sight because of the economic crisis. While \"films without film\" might have proved the devotion of the Kuleshov collective, they also vividly illustrated the seeming hopelessness of their predicament. Yet even in time of material want, Gan characteristically worried about ideological leadership. He did not feel that there was any government support for the development of a truly revolutionary cinema art, and he believed that a choice had to be made immediately. For him, Soviet culture was at the crossroads: along one path \"slowly moves the aesthetic gravedigger smelling like Dostoevskii or Tolstoi\"; along the other strode the healthy young constructivists, who \"see the real world,\" human society, and technology.32 Gan continued to defend the utility of proclamation writing, but as early as 1923 support had evaporated for such utopianism. A persistent stereotype of Soviet cinema in the twenties is that it consisted of propaganda, anti-art slogans, and unrealistic projects. This was only true of Cinema-photo during its short life. Its impact was negligible—its most important contribution lay in providing Lev Kuleshov a forum, ironic considering that Kuleshov was not a radical. Its support of Dziga Vertov was also noteworthy and undoubtedly aided in the publicizing of his career, but Vertov was in the end his own most effective spokesman. Cinema-photo was not only estranged from the moderate \"mainstream\" of Soviet cinema, it purposefully disengaged itself from the \"Left Front\" of the arts as well. Gan was sharply critical of the \"Left Front,\" which included all the artistic \"-ists\"—Stankists, suprematists, non-objectivists, futurists, immanentists, and expressionists—except the constructivists. He charged that the \"left\" artistic groups, although condemning the old art, posited nothing new in its place: \"On the 'Left Front' there is no reflection of new life. In all this time, we have seen only an endless row of formal experiments.\" (Gan chose not to explain how the constructivists had achieved \"new life.\") Cinema constructivists, wrote Gan, were interested neither in experimentation nor in finding new forms. Cinema must be wrested from the clutches of both capitalism (into which its \"industrial connections\" had led it) and the corrupted arts. He said: The sooner we accept that cinema is not art [then] the closer we will come to the battle, the truer we will begin to accomplish the necessary work on the path of our young, revolutionary cinematography.33\n\nBeginnings\n\n9\n\nThe Cinema-photo group represented an interesting but essentially isolated phenomenon in Soviet cinema, as we shall see. Their revolutionary enthusiasm, disdain for old art, and admiration for technology did not address the concrete problems of building a film industry and articulating a new aesthetic. Their fractionalism in fact discredited their position with other cinema workers. The Futurists Despite Gan's avowals to the contrary, one familiar with the futurists will recognize certain common attitudes. Poet Vladimir Maiakovskii's journal Lef (for \"Left Front\") was not a film journal, but three of the seven signers of the first Lef manifesto—Maiakovskii, Osip Brik, and Sergei Tretiakov—had a more than passing interest in cinema,34 and another, B. Arvatov, had contributed to Cinema-photo.35 Brik, Maiakovskii, and Tretiakov all wrote scripts; Brik and Tretiakov were able film critics; and Maiakovskii acted. The militant views of the Lefists and the Cinema-photoists on the sorry state of the old culture were similar, as was their certainty that a new art must come from the new society.36 It was hardly fair of Gan to charge that the futurists had no concrete answers, for who had? In the cinema world, where the economic situation was especially precarious, there was still no opportunity for hopefuls to put their ideas into practice. Since ideas were all anyone could offer in 1923, it is worth examining two essays published that year in Lef The articles appeared in the same issue, one following the other; while this juxtaposition must have enraged Dziga Vertov, it was most appropriate, for the problems posed in these two pieces formed the central theoretical conflict of cinema in the decade: should fact or fiction be the basis of the film art of the future? The question had been skirted in the first Soviet film tract Cinema (Kinematograf)37 and summarily dismissed in Cinema-photo. Boris Kushner, one of the original Lefists, addressed the question in \"Izopovest'.\" The title is a neologism meaning \"pictorial story,\" which was how he attempted to define the domain of cinema (as opposed to that of theater). Kushner came out squarely in favor of narrative cinema as an \"amazing, witty, and entertaining storyteller.\" According to Kushner, cinema was so far from being a step-cousin of the arts that even literature should emulate the way cinema combined pictorial concreteness with its story-telling techniques.38 Vertov's Lef article, \"Cinema-eyes: Coup\" (\"Kinoki: Perevorot\") expressed a completely different point of view and is one of the most famous expositions of his theory. It is also an excellent example of the difficult, innovative, and quarrelsome style which was his trademark. He began by declaring that everything in cinema needed to become exactly the opposite of what it had been. He therefore absolutely condemned fiction cinema, whether\n\n10\n\nBeginnings\n\npsychological, detective, or satirical, as being a \"literary skeleton plus cinema illustrations.\"39 Vertov decried the tenacity of the old forms of the cinema drama, pointing out that the new productions with their NEPmen heroes were no more than remakes of old pictures with bourgeois heroes.40 Thus far, the essay could have been written by Gan; Vertov was, however, a thoroughgoing revolutionary. He made it very clear that the machine was not equal but superior to man, writing: The end point is: the use of the movie camera as a cinema-eye, more perfect than the human eye, for the investigation of the chaos of visual phenomena which resemble space. The cinema-eye lives and moves in time and space, perceives and fixes impressions in a new way completely unlike the human eye We cannot make our eyes better than they are, but we can endlessly perfect the movie camera.41\n\nThis is an astonishing statement, the ultimate extension of the constructivist ideal of art as the embodiment of the machine age. Vertov's modernism definitely diminishes man; the machine—in this case the movie camera—is better because it is more \"truthful.\" Did this mean that the role of man in the movie-making process was simply to hold the camera? Here Vertov provided his own version of Kuleshov's montage theory, boldly recognizing that montage was more than just the organizational and aesthetic basis of cinema. Montage, according to Vertov, is the manipulation of the viewer. He boasted that he could take a shot of a person in Chicago in 1923 and \"place\" him in Petrograd in 1918 and even went so far as to point out examples from his own Cinema Truth \"newsreels\": They lower the coffins of people's heroes to the grave (shot in Astrakhan in 1918), fill up the grave (Kronstadt, 1921), cannon gun salute (Petrograd, 1920), eternal memory, they take off their caps (Moscow, 1922)—such things go together even with \"ungrateful,\" not specially shot material (see Cinema Truth, No. 13). Here it is proper to cut from montage of a welcoming crowd and a welcoming car to Comrade Lenin (Cinema Truth, No. 14), shot in different places, at different times.\n\nVertov apparently saw nothing ironical about the title of his films and his cinematic practices. Such was his confidence in the power montage gave the filmmaker that he could write: I am the cinema-eye. I am the builder. I placed you, today created by me, in a room which did not exist until this moment, also created by me I am the cinema-eye; I create a person more perfect than Adam I am the cinema-eye. I am the mechanical eye. I am the machine which shows you the world as only I can see it.42\n\nBeginnings\n\n11\n\nThe basic problem with Vertov is that he could make such statements while at the same time staking an apparently sincere claim for his own objectivity, for example: From today, in cinema we need neither psychological nor detective dramas; from today, we do not need theatrical productions shot on film; from today, we do not adapt Dostoevskii or Nat Pinkerton [for the screen]. Everything enters into a new understanding of the newsreel.43\n\nBut what was this \"new understanding?\" The Vertov controversy, one of the key aesthetic debates of the coming years, centered on how well he lived up to his own declared standards of objectivity. The fate of the Soviet nonfiction feature film was intimately connected with the fate of Dziga Vertov. FEKS Although they were interested in cinema, the Lefists did not form a cinema group. At the time of the publication of their manifesto, Eccentrism (Ekstsentrizm) in 1922, FEKS, the Workshop of the Eccentric Actor, was neither a cinema group nor were its members particularly interested in cinema. Even so, FEKS must be considered at the end of a discussion of \"left\" trends in cinema, because its leaders, Grigorii Kozintsev and Leonid Trauberg, were shortly to become important film directors, and they transformed FEKS from a theater to a cinema collective. Extreme youth characterized the \"left wing\" of cinema, and FEKS leaders Kozintsev and Trauberg and their colleague Sergei Iutkevich (later a film director in his own right), were the youngest of all. When the group was organized in 1921, Kozintsev was sixteen years old; Trauberg, nineteen; Iutkevich, seventeen. Due to their long collaboration, Kozintsev and Trauberg are generally remembered as the sole leaders of the group but Iutkevich was also an important contributor to the manifesto. FEKS, unlike the cinema constructivists, was not anti-art. They simply wanted to deflate art; as Kozintsev put it, they wanted \"art without capital letters.\"44 They therefore sought inspiration in the most \"popular\"—in the sense of most \"accessible\"—forms of acted art: the circus, the street player, the music hall. In the pictorial arts, they admired the poster and the advertisement. They also regarded the author irreverently, as merely an \"inventorbuilder.\" The traditional actor likewise was a target for diminution, as \"mechanized action.\" Emphasizing their break from tradition, Kozintsev declared that \"Charlo [Chaplin]'s back is dearer to us than the hand of Eleonora Duse.\"45 FEKS admired the dynamism and unpretentiousness of American popular culture even more than did Kuleshov; the art of the future, they declared, would be a Russian version of American \"vulgarity.\"46\n\n12\n\nBeginnings\n\nFEKS bluntly refused to ally itself with the other left groups, and properly so, since FEKS did not worship technology and altogether presented a disarmingly human face of avant-garde art. Like Gan, Iutkevich in fact poked fun at all the \"isms\" of modern art, saying that these were a \"complete break from life, through their concentration on form rather than plotted action [siuzhet].\" 47 Art, according to FEKS, should be contemporary and \"boulevardized,\" that is, it should cater to the tastes of the people. (Despite this credo, FEKS' films were not to prove easily accessible to the masses.) Although FEKS did not offer much by way of theory, it did express the irrepressible youth and energy and good spirits found in cinema and the other arts in the first years of the revolution. The FEKS collection crackles with the audacity of extreme youth; Iutkevich declared that their motto was that of the Italian futurist Marinetti: \"The old are always wrong, even when right, but the young are always right, even when wrong.\"48 Cinema was attractive to bright young people with artistic interests precisely because it had so poor a past. In Soviet Russia, due to the traumas of the past years, cinema was very nearly a new art; and film lovers could make of it whatever they wanted. The world, so they thought, was theirs. The Centrists (Cinema Gazette) To this point, we have considered the first hesitant steps toward the reestablishment of a film industry and the formulation of a film aesthetic. The position of the government and Party was not clearly defined, although the blatantly \"bourgeois\" style of Cinema Life was permanently eclipsed. There were some amorphous left-wing groupings in cinema; chief among these were Aleksei Gan and Cinema-photo and Dziga Vertov's Cinema-eye collective. A number of Lefists were interested in cinema, and in Petrograd FEKS formed the basis for an important avant-garde film collective of the future. This, the most avant-garde period of Soviet cinema, was characterized by wishful thinking, due to the lack of raw materials needed to make films, but even among stridently left-wing publications, there was room for diversity of opinion. Although these avant-garde \"groups\" were less alike than they appeared on the surface, it would be a mistake to assume that they represented mainstream opinion. By 1923, the center consisted of moderates concerned with the rebuilding of Russian cinema and reviving public interest in it. Their forum was the Moscow newspaper Cinema Gazette {Kino-gazeta). The following anecdote about a lively discussion in Moscow's most lavish movie palace, the Malaia Dmitrovka theater, illustrates the jaundiced view of many film activists toward extreme leftists like Gan and Vertov: \"D. Vertov, as usual, began and ended addressing all workers in cinematography abusively,\" after\n\nBeginnings\n\n13\n\nwhich A. Anoshchenko \"pinned them [the Cinema-eyes] to the wall\" with his witty sallies, and Lev Kuleshov proved, to the joy of most present, that there was nothing new about the montage in Vertov's Cinema Truth series. When Gan tried to speak, he was whistled down. And in the end, the \"Cinema-eyes and their friends, the constructivists, were finally unmasked.\"49 To the moderates, Soviet cinema had problems more serious than those posited by Vertov. The first concern addressed was that of economics, and the picture was a gloomy one. Before there could be any discussion of the kinds of movies to make, practical problems had to be faced. Vertov may have thought the question of film stock and laboratories philistine, but Kuleshov believed that it was financially and technically impossible to make a good modern film in Soviet Russia. He also supported the production of films that would be marketable abroad, because although he personally favored \"revolutionary\" movies as the mainstay of Soviet production, historical movies were more likely to find foreign purchasers.50 The state film enterprise Goskino, as mentioned earlier, was in a precarious position due to lack of founding capital. As early as 1923 (less than a year after its founding) it was perceived as being incapable of solving the problems of Soviet cinema. Cinema Gazette's \"line\" in these days was that Goskino must be replaced by a film syndicate,51 but unfortunately there was very little concrete information offered about the economic situation and Goskino's role in the crisis. Another specific concern was foreign movies. Although they were potentially harmful ideologically, this was not viewed as a problem since they could be re-edited and the titles rewritten to be \"critically\" illuminating.52 More worrisome from the economic and organizational point of view was that \"a significant percentage\" of foreign films (for which much precious hard currency had been paid) had been banned by the censors, indicating a costly lack of communication between the censorship and Goskino.53 The third major issue that surfaced in 1923 was one of the enduring problems of the decade, the \"scenario crisis\"—the shortage of suitable scripts. This was first articulated not in Cinema Gazette, but in Prolet-cinema (Proletkino), a short-lived journal connected with the slightly less short-lived production company of the same name, which was dedicated to the furthering of proletarian cinema. According to Prolet-cinema there was still no \"Soviet\" cinema, only recycled ideas and \"pseudo-revolutionary\" films, made by people connected with the prerevolutionary movie industry.54 Prolet-cinema therefore issued a call to \"new authors\" for \"healthy\" stories, especially about the revolutionary epoch.55 Goskino, too, was quite concerned about getting enough scripts, having budgeted 3,000 gold rubles for this purpose through July 1, 1924. To stir public interest, it planned to hold a\n\n14\n\nBeginnings\n\ncontest with fifty chervonets (500 rubles) as first prize.56 The Leningrad production company Sevzapkino also announced that they were accepting scripts, though without mention of remuneration.57 At the end of 1923 an important article appeared in Cinema Gazette calling for the establishment of a \"new cinema front\" to end the general malaise: We need a group of active people: first, those who are committed to the affairs of the revolution, and second, those who love cinematography, know it, and work in it. Only such an avant-garde might lead cinematography along the path of modernity in the service of the Revolution.\n\nThe proposed organization was to be called the Association of Revolutionary Cinematography (ARK);58 within a year these plans would come to fruition through the efforts of Cinema Gazette's editor Nikolai Lebedev. Films Agit-films Film production was limited during this period and almost none have survived due to the fragility of nitrate stock and the very poor quality of what the Soviets had at their disposal.59 That any were made at all in these early years was something of a miracle. It was inevitable that the Revolution would offer new topics, and it is interesting to see how \"revolutionary ideas\" were perceived and popularized by film directors, a group not known for political perspicacity. The most important genre for this period, as indicated earlier, was the agit-film needed for propaganda on the front. One of the very first Soviet-made films was a film of this type, Overcrowding {Uplotnenie, 1918), produced by the Petrograd Cinema Committee, directed by Aleksandr Panteleev, and based on Commissar of Enlightenment A. V. Lunacharskii's first cinema script. (In fact, the movie begins with a shot of Lunacharskii boyishly grinning at the camera.) It is the story of a pampered professor (played by D. I. Leshchenko, the head of the Commissariat's Cinema Section [VFKO] in 1919) who has to give up some rooms in his large house to workers; after a rough start, all turns out well. The professor begins teaching science to a workers' club, and his son falls in love with a proletarian girl who has moved in with them. Overcrowding is a perfect example of an agit-film, for it has a rudimentary plot, a simple message supporting the regime, and limited character development. Even with such restricted aims, the action and relationship of the characters are confusing; for example, people are constantly seen reading letters, but the viewer is never apprised of the content.60 Soviet cinema had humble beginnings indeed.\n\nBeginnings\n\n15\n\nVladimir Gardin's 1921 Sickle and Hammer (Serp i molot) is a better example of the agit-film, except that at six reels it is considerably longer than the norm (which was about two reels, or twenty minutes). It is primitive and easily understandable with clichéd characters in a stock plot. A priest is shown cleaning pictures of the tsar, unsubtly making the connection between religion and autocracy. Rich peasants (kulaks) hoard bread, as children die of hunger; they buy forged \"invalid\" documents to keep from serving in the Red Army; and they seduce women and wring their hands villainously. The purpose of this picture (featuring the future director Vsevolod Pudovkin as a worker whose baby dies) was to effect a reconciliation between town and country, although this idea was executed most banally. Nonetheless, the use of hackneyed cinematic conventions was not naive. If the masses had ever before seen a movie, this was the style to which they were accustomed, and, as cinema activists were already aware, making movies comprehensible to the peasants was no easy task. As we shall see again and again, peasants had great difficulty understanding any but the most simple films. Literary Adaptations A more noteworthy example of the \"miracle\" of early Soviet filmmaking is Polikushka (1919, directed by Aleksandr Sanin), an adaptation of Lev Tolstoi's story starring the famous theater actor Ivan Moskvin in his first screen role. Screen adaptations of Russian classics had been a popular prerevolutionary genre, and the trend would continue. In this case, the adaptation could actually be said to be Soviet in character: not only is there a socially uplifting theme —on the depredations of drink—but the picture of rural poverty is a grim one. This is perhaps Moskvin's best screen performance; he managed to overcome his intrinsic theatricality to create a memorable Polikushka. His death scene—suicide by hanging—is shot in slow motion, thus revealing some of the artistic possibilities of the medium. Polikushka was one of the first Soviet films to become popular abroad, and it is important for the politics of later film production that Hungarian film critic Bela Balasz pinned the film's success to its theatricality and its Moscow Art Theater star.61 Revolutionary Films There were two kinds of films in the \"revolutionary\" genre that aimed higher than the \"vulgar\" propaganda of the agit-films. These were the \"historicalrevolutionary\" films and the \"international revolutionary\" films. Arsen Dzhordzhiashveli (1921; Ivan Perestiani, director) has the distinction of being the first attempt at the former type, a romantic film of the revolutionary past. It\n\n16\n\nBeginnings\n\nwas also the first film on a Georgian theme with Georgian actors.62 Just as Vsevolod Pudovkin was getting his start in the movies as an actor, so the future Georgian director Mikhail Chiaureli played Arsen, the film's protagonist, a member of the underground during the 1905 Revolution. In many ways the plot is indistinguishable from that of an agit-film: the workers plan a strike; there is a traitor in the group, and as a result the committee is arrested. Arsen and two of his friends escape, the two cohorts deciding that someone should kill the governor-general. Arsen—quite properly from a Bolshevik point of view—has mixed feelings about an act of individual terror, but he loses the straw vote and must kill the general. At this point the movie becomes interesting, due to a large extent to Chiaureli's attempts to define his character as a real person. Arsen is tormented by his fate, not because such acts of terror are politically wrong, but because he is passionately in love. He overcomes his personal feelings, kills the general, and dies heroically (an officer executes him after the firing squad refuses to shoot). Arsen Dzhordzhiashveli was the first movie to try to develop a revolutionary theme in a narrative form more complex than that of the agitfilm. The tendentiousness of the theme is enlivened by the love interest, played with breast-heaving passion and fluttering eyelids; and by a good dose of brutality, as when Arsen is caught or when the stool pigeon is thrown from a bridge into the path of a train. There is also a well-cut chase scene with the dramatic touch of a bloody hand streaking a wall. But most importantly, Arsen Dzhordzhiashveli attempted to depict a realistic hero, a man beset by doubts and reluctant to die. In fact, this film represents an ideal rarely achieved in Soviet silent cinema—it was both entertaining and economically made. Perestiani was not an inspired filmmaker, but he had at least a rudimentary knowledge of cinematographic principles. Another example of the revolutionary film, Locksmith and Chancellor (Slesar' i kantsler, 1923) directed by Vladimir Gardin, is a puzzlingly bad picture, puzzling because the personnel involved were experienced; not only the director, Gardin, but his assistant, Olga Preobrazhenskaia, had had considerable careers in prerevolutionary cinema (Preobrazhenskaia was an actress of some repute and had directed on her own). Locksmith and Chancellor is nonetheless a truly terrible picture, a revolutionary fable based on the play by the Commissar of Enlightenment, A. V. Lunacharskii. The setting is a foreign country populated by decadent women and homosexual soldiers. There is a badly shot strike scene which merely shows a lot of people milling around, and even the moving camerawork is boring, lacking dynamism and focus. The self-conscious revolutionary cliches and nonexistent plot make it an example of the worst of the decade. The critical opinion of the time concurred. Valentin Turkin, a prerevolutionary\n\nBeginnings\n\n17\n\nscenarist who continued to be important in the early Soviet period as writer, critic, and teacher, wrote: ... the picture represents unbroken directorial confusion with regard to the methods of work in cinematography All the principles of constructing screen action have fallen before absolutely total absurdity.63\n\nComedies Comedies were also considered a desirable genre, especially to express antireligious ideas. According to his sister, Lenin's favorite movie was Aleksandr Panteleev's 1922 anti-religious comedy Miracle Worker (Chudotvorets). It is clear from memoirs that Lenin did not see many movies, which makes his famous saying \"Cinema is for us the most important of all arts\" undoubtedly apocryphal. Nonetheless, if Miracle Worker were indeed his favorite film, it may tell us something about his character, for it is a vulgar comedy of a phony miracle. The peasants play jokes on their cruel mistress, such as throwing horse manure through a window or putting a pig with her nightcap on its head in her bed. The film is \"correct\" in that it sets the peasants against both landlords and the Church, the peasants coming off as cunning but extremely uncouth. The making of anti-religious movies would continue to pose stylistic problems; long after the worst clichés had disappeared from other genres, anti-religious films were consistently crude. The second comedy to be considered here, the 1922 film Commander Ivanov (Kombrig Ivanov) directed by Aleksandr Razumnyi, also has strong anti-religious overtones. It was one of the few films the financially strapped Proletkino studio managed to complete and is a curious effort from an organization dedicated to making \"proletarian\" films: the tale of how a Bolshevik commissar manages to overcome the petty-bourgeois resistance of a priest's daughter (played by Olga Tretiakova, a vocal spokeswoman for actors' rights) to \"living in sin.\" One could of course argue that it represents the \"new morality\" which had not yet fallen into disgrace and was therefore consonant with proletarian aims, but its lascivious slyness makes its American title The Beauty and the Bolshevik fitting (it was later criticized for being shown abroad under such a title). Commander Ivanov is good-natured, even in its attack against religion, but shallow, and not particularly compelling. A major flaw which must have hampered its reception with the semi-literate mass audience were the titles; very long and literary, they disturbed the continuity of the action. In fact, the popular reception of Commander Ivanov is open to some dispute. One report was that peasants rejected the picture for its lack of realism, the argument being that a few flaws could seriously damage the credibility of\n\n18\n\nBeginnings\n\ncinema with the literal-minded peasant audience. Another report was that workers, while rejecting the primitive moralizing of agit-films, liked Commander Ivanov very much.65 Although concrete reports of audience response were rare, it is clear that the pessimism of critics about the quality of Soviet cinema was justified. First Successes By 1922, however, two productions gave cause for hope. One was the first number of Dziga Vertov's Cinema Truth series of newsreels.66 The other could not have been more different, a lively adventure story of children in the Civil War, directed by the Georgian Ivan Perestiani (who made the revolutionary adventure discussed above, Arsen Dzhordzhiashveli). This historic film, Little Red Devils (Krasnye d'iavoliata), was a truly delightful movie which was enormously popular with the viewers (named their favorite film as late as 1925). Little Red Devils begins with the ironic touch of the boy-hero reading James Fenimore Cooper's The Pathfinder and imagining himself chased by Indians while his sister is reading Romain Rolland and envisioning herself as a bombthrower. Of course, they do not need to rely on imagination since they are in the midst of a real-life adventure. Makhno's anarchist \"Greens\" are attacking their Ukrainian town; the gang members look like comic-strip villains. The tone of the movie in fact constantly fluctuates between the humorous and the serious, for the bandits, despite their satirically depraved appearance, are truly violent killers. One of the early victims is the children's father, who exhorts them with his dying words to remember their brother who was a mutineer on the Aurora. In the course of various comic adventures (like the slapstick robbery of a peasant couple), the children join forces with a Negro boy, Tom Jackson (whose appearance in the Ukraine is bizarre, to say the least). The girl, Dunia, is tortured on hot coals before justice triumphs, but at last the villain (who sports sunglasses throughout) dies. Cinema Gazette extolled this droll adventure as the \"first film of the revolution,\" pointedly noting that it was a production of the Georgian production company Goskinprom Gruzii, thus by implication chastising the Russian studios. The newspaper advised that in order for everybody to see the picture, one hundred copies should be made, an extraordinary demand considering the severe stock shortage (ordinarily ten copies of a film were made). Cinema Gazette's view of the virtues of the movie was most revealing: Little Red Devils could ... cure film workers of the sick pessimism caused by the lack of success of the past years; it will serve as a strong and hopeful weapon in the hands of the supporters of the revolutionary\n\nBeginnings\n\n19\n\nart film, will attract to cinema the still greater attention of Soviet public opinion, and will deprive the cinema producers of the right to make potboilers, alluding to our technical poverty as an excuse.67\n\nThis statement made an important point about the status of cinema in Soviet society. The time for self-flagellation was passing; the inferiority complex must be overcome to spur the sluggish development of cinema. Some had claimed that Soviet cinema technology was only advanced enough for the nonfiction film; Little Red Devils showed that this was not true, and Cinema Gazette, as a supporter of the fiction film, found cause at last to rejoice. Despite the dreams, promises, and slow beginnings, very little had happened in Soviet cinema from 1919 to 1923 in terms of establishing a film industry. A diverse and lively discussion was taking place concerning the possibilities of cinema, and gifted young people were attracted by the notion of making a revolutionary art from a lowly entertainment medium. More important, some were even rejecting philosophizing to take stock of an extremely unpleasant reality: the poor physical condition of a practically nonexistent \"industry.\" Literally everything was in the future.\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK\n\n2\n\nThe Turning Point (1924) Despite the surprising success of Little Red Devils, cinema activists were far from optimistic at the outset of the year 1924. In the cities, where most theaters were, theaters suffered from chaotic finances, high taxes, and a shortage of movies. From all indications, conditions were primitive. Showings were never on time,1 and some German visitors considered even Moscow's theaters (the country's finest) shockingly old-fashioned, most of them lacking orchestras.2 Provincial theaters suffered from a glut of petty-bourgeois films (according to a Cinema Week [Kino-nedelia] critic), and Grigorii Boltianskii noted that theaters were either closed or extremely decrepit.3 Nikolai Lebedev wrote that there was as yet no revolutionary cinematography, only \"brisk trade of foreign trash\" and \"nasty domestic hack-work.\"4 Doubtless most would have agreed with him, whether examining the scene from an artistic or ideological point of view (and the movies just discussed would corroborate this). Concerns up to this point had been mainly theoretical, but in 1924 there was a shift away from the exuberant revolutionary manifestoes of previous years toward a more realistic appraisal of the vast problems facing Soviet cinema. Pessimism was still rampant: Up to now we have had no organization. Up to now we have not known how to cope with the bureaucratism, chancellory-itis [kantseliarshchina], slovenliness, and superficiality which reign in part of our cinema organization. Up to now we have not freed ourselves from speculators and pseudo-specialists who consciously or unconsciously hamper our cinema work Up to now we have had neither cinema politics nor normal economics. We have still not created the preconditions for production. ... That is why our cinema spring is so sad.5\n\nThe formalist critic and writer Viktor Shklovskii, recently returned from exile abroad for his socialist revolutionary connections, declared that the time for watching poor pictures merely because they were Russian was past, caustically noting that \"only Finland and Poland will watch 'their' films from\n\n22\n\nThe Turning Point\n\npatriotism.\"6 This new spirit was articulated by many others.7 The time had come to make movies. Goskino and the Economy In the spring of 1924, the All-Union Conference of Cinema Organizations was convened to review the findings of the Mantsev Commission (which had been appointed in September 1923 to study the organizational problems of the industry). While the conference resolutions dealt mainly with the \"monopoly question,\" they also revealed some general directives for future action. Although the government monopoly on distribution would be retained and extended to encompass all Soviet republics the better to exploit the internal market, it was suggested that film organizations should unify through a jointstock company. The conference accepted the Mantsev Commission's recommendations on the necessity of reorganizing the industry, except that the Commissariat of Enlightenment was to remain in charge of cinema.8 The basic form the new \"practicality\" on the cinema front took was a critical examination of Goskino. Could Goskino pull itself out of its difficulties? The Conference of Cinema Organizations believed not, the question being what should replace it. At the end of 1923 Cinema Gazette had favored a union of existing organizations; now it began to re-evaluate this. Goskino's capital, it charged, was capital on paper only, the \"real\" money backing the organization estimated at 27,000 rubles. Should the \"dead\" capital of Goskino be joined with the \"living,\" that is, should Goskino receive more money? According to Cinema Gazette, providing Goskino with more funds would be tantamount to jumping on a sinking ship. There should be no union of studios with Goskino, but instead the \"creation of an authoritative regulatory organ and the transfer to it of the right of monopoly\" to aid the development of Soviet cinema.9 Cinema Gazette therefore campaigned for the fall of Goskino, attributing the crisis in cinema and the inactivity of production and distribution to Goskino's \"monopoly.\" (A better argument could be made that these problems stemmed from Goskino's fiscal weakness.) Goskino's alleged monopoly illustrated the dangers of \"glavkism\" central bureaucratic control. Where central bureaucratic control was weakest, claimed Cinema Gazette, cinema was doing best, both in production and distribution: \"The free initiative of separate Soviet enterprises will defeat the remains of 'glavkism.'\"10 Calls like this, for decentralization, were rarely seen in the pages of the cinema press except in the Leningrad newspaper Cinema Week where they would continue until 1925. Cinema Week, the organ of the Leningrad studio Sevzapkino, was, if anything, more strongly opposed to Goskino than was its Moscow counterpart\n\nThe Turning Point\n\n23\n\nCinema Gazette, labelling Goskino the \"evil genius\" of Soviet cinema in one editorial. Goskino, it agreed with Cinema Gazette, had not put the industry on firm footing; worse yet, Goskino was flooding Soviet screens with terrible foreign pictures: \"petty-bourgeois [meshchanskie], stupid, dull, marshy films.\" According to Cinema Week, the crisis exemplified the evils of monopoly; it could only be remedied by involving more people in the decision-making process, specifically OSPK (Society of Builders of Proletarian Cinema, see below), the Artistic Council on Cinema Affairs in the Commissariat of Enlightenment, Soviet public opinion, and collective labor in cinema production.11 Cinema Week was also quite interested in the specifics of the economic situation (and with workers in general, as one might expect in Leningrad, where the Russian labor movement had started). In an attempt to approach problems more rationally, it tried to quantify production costs.12 Economic questions concerned everyone in the film community, and an important, longhoped-for change occurred in May 1924 when the Council of People's Commissars (Sovnarkom) lowered the tax on movie tickets from 30 percent to 10 percent. That was the only concrete step taken to solve the industry's financial problems, although Sovnarkom empowered the Supreme Council of the National Economy (Vesenkha) to \"take measures\" to solve the chronic shortage of raw materials for cinema production.13 Any discussion of which organization should control distribution was rather academic. Due to the shortage of raw materials, there was little production and therefore little to distribute. \"Film hunger\" (even \"starvation\") was a chronic problem, and because demand exceeded supply, film rental was expensive. In prerevolutionary times theaters had paid for films by the meter; now they had to turn over a percentage of their proceeds as well, ranging from 30 to 50 percent. In the opinion of many, rental prices had to be lowered to prevent the failure and closure of theaters. Furthermore, especially in provincial theaters, there was no choice of films. Provincial theaters were forced to accept what was sent, and, adding to their woes, the films arrived late (allowing no opportunity for advertising), or not at all.14 With little domestic production, it is easy to imagine that the dilemma facing the industry regarding foreign films was as much economic as ideological. Of course it was recognized that foreign (and prerevolutionary) films were not made to satisfy communist ideology, but it must be emphasized that what caused greater concern at this point was that the latest American hits still had not been seen (because they were too expensive to purchase).15 Good or bad, more than 95 percent of the films in distribution in 1924 were foreign films. Worry over the possible political ramifications of this \"infiltration\" of foreign ideology increased, and as mentioned earlier, the aesthetically dubious solution was to re-edit foreign films for the Soviet\n\n24\n\nThe Turning Point\n\naudience. This practice proved good training for a generation of Soviet film editors, including the distinguished compilation-documentarist Esfir Shub, although there were complaints that the re-editing was done hastily by \"accidental people [who] not only [are] politically illiterate, neither can they write Russian correctly [for the titles].\" In addition, the newly written titles were ridiculously long and boring in an effort to inject revolutionary ideology in the movies. To overcome these shortcomings, it was recognized that the ranks of film editors had to be strengthened with people who were politically and grammatically literate. This could be achieved in two ways: by increasing wages and by putting the name of the editor in the credits.16 (The Revolution notwithstanding, people apparently still hungered for money and fame.) The Labor Force The difficulty of attracting competent film editors was a single facet of a larger problem. Just as there was a shortage of money and raw materials for the cinema, so was there a shortage of trained personnel on all levels. The nascent Soviet cinema had become a director's cinema, in the sense that there was a tacit recognition that the director was the central figure in the movie-making process. But many believed the prerevolutionary directors who had remained were not working out entirely satisfactorily,17 while the young were unskilled technically. So few new directors had technical mastery, in fact, that one writer charged many cameramen were actually making the films18 (presumably benefitting from their Civil War experience). This notwithstanding, the general opinion was that the \"salvation of Soviet cinematography\" lay not with \"old specialists\" but with youth. The young simply needed to learn.19 Discontent with \"specialists\" was a characteristic of Soviet society not unique to cinema. One school of thought maintained, however, that working without directors was actually a strong point of Soviet cinema, since in a socialist society the collective should be the \"ideal of cinema production.\"20 This was hardly a workable solution. Collectives like Kuleshov's, Vertov's, or Kozintsev's and Trauberg's were very much directed and led. Leo Mur, one of the more colorful characters in Soviet cinema, a former revolutionary whose years in exile had led him to filmwork in New York and Hollywood, answered the question this way: there should be collectives (a collective \"machine,\" as he phrased it), but standing \"over the collective must be a single thought and will \"In view of Soviet conditions, the director should be a \"team leader,\" but the idea of working without a director was as dangerous as working without rules.21 The question of the director's role in filmmaking persisted as an important problem. The form the issue was taking—the charges of a \"dictatorship\" of the director—could lead to some glib political parallels, when in fact hard reality necessitated someone's controlling the scanty resources.\n\nThe Turning Point\n\n25\n\nThe second pressing personnel problem was the lack of script writers. Some believed this could easily be solved, fallaciously reasoning that any writer (or even any individual) could be a scenarist, since all that was necessary was an idea. With this notion regnant, it is not surprising that the script shortage did not abate. By the end of 1924, the term \"scenario crisis\" had made its debut, with 90 percent of submitted scripts being rejected.22 This crisis, said the critics, was caused by only partially implemented centralization and poorly organized and inadequately paid script writers. The solution to the scenario crisis therefore would be: (1) to work out a common thematic plan for all cinema organizations; (2) to create a professional association for script writers in either the proposed ARK (the Association of Revolutionary Cinematography) or in Rabis (the Art Workers' Union); and (3) to increase rates of payment for script work.23 The last solution was surely an eminently practical one because the talented writer would not be attracted to cinema any other way. The other preferred solutions, especially the first, indicated that the \"line\" of Cinema Gazette was again veering toward more organization, not less. The individual initiative extolled earlier in the year, with regard to Goskino, did not, in the end, answer the demands of the day. Yet who was qualified enough to propose themes and organize the artistic councils of the various cinema companies? The final personnel problem widely discussed in 1924 concerned the actor. (The troubling shortage of technical cadres, like projectionists, did not attract much concern except in Cinema Week.)24 Although Dziga Vertov had summarily dismissed the actor as a participant in the postrevolutionary movie, most recognized that the actor (whether professional or nonprofessional) would continue to be an important factor in cinema. The first question posed was: Is there something specific about the craft of a cinema actor, or could a theater actor easily work in the movies? Film critics early answered the latter part in the negative, saying that theater actors had no place in cinema, their acting being \"theatrical,\" meaning \"false.\" \"Bolshevik\" heroes —\"steel-like, full-blooded, life-loving, strong people\"— were expected to come \"not from bourgeois theaters, but from the land.\"25 That an actor playing a worker must be of proletarian stock, or better yet, actually be a worker was the beginning of the casting principle known as \"typage.\" But because of the difficulty of fulfilling this ideal, production companies continued to draw upon the theater for acting talent. The fundamental problem underlying all aspects of the labor issue in the cinema industry was the lack of training facilities. Lev Kuleshov, who had proved his devotion to film education through pedagogical activities both in GTK, the State Film Technical Institute (founded in 1919), and in his own collective, bluntly asserted:\n\n26\n\nThe Turning Point All failures come from our immense \"craft\" free-and-easiness We do not know how to deal with the material of our craft; we do not know how, because we do not want to study; we do not know how, and consequently, are not acquainted with the formal side of cinematography— In order to know how to show really interesting and expressive people, the organized movements of the masses, convincing shots, and finally to obtain correct development of the plot [siuzhet], it is essential to know and to know how. To know all the characteristics and peculiarities of cinematography, to know how to manage and to know how to obey.\n\nFor Kuleshov, the revolution could not be realized in cinema without attention to training. But which sort of training should come first: technical or political education? Indicative of the waning interest in ideology, Kuleshov was convinced that the ideological side of films could be strengthened only after the technical side, after the achievement of professional mastery. Kuleshov's attitude toward prerevolutionary specialists, who were an obvious source of cinematographic knowledge, was a combination of caution and prophecy: On the path of study and perfecting of cinema craft stand people who specialized in the old art. They are our enemies It is not necessary to listen to them, but it is necessary to learn the trade [from them] If there is an exaggerated tendency on the side of formalism in youthful work; then one should not forget that, first, this is a temporary phenomenon, and, second, knowledge of the craft is essential for the resolution of the scripts we need. Otherwise we will come to the Western blind alley. There the cinematographic twilight has begun, here the dawn is breaking. We will conquer. The light comes from the East, the light of genuine mastery which casts off the aestheticism of artistry and which will learn to build the communist film of the future world of cinematography of the USSR.26\n\nKuleshov's statement reflected a not uncommon mixture (for a Russian) of resentment at backwardness and praise for the virtues of backwardness. But was it possible to take what one needed from the \"old\" specialists and reject the rest? The coexistence between those who wholeheartedly considered themselves Soviet, like Kuleshov, and the fellow travellers, like director Iakov Protazanov, recently returned from abroad, was often uneasy. Kuleshov was not the only young film activist who admired proficiency and professionalism, nor was he the only one who recognized the built-in dangers in co-opting the talents of politically neutral specialists. His point of view was, however, moderate when compared to others. By far the sharpest attack on cinema specialists to this date appeared in a Cinema Week article by Albert Syrkin, a member of VAPP, the All-Russian Association of Proletarian Writers. Syrkin scoffed at those who expected to see truly \"Soviet\" films and were therefore naive enough to be amazed at all the \"hastily-made nonsense, petty-bourgeois, philistine [and] narrowminded, loosely draped in red rags.\" This was not surprising considering the source of\n\nThe Turning Point\n\n27\n\n\"Soviet\" films: \"Who makes Soviet films? In 99 cases out of 100, a director reactionary to the core, dreaming about the past; a scenarist from the allknowing youth; artists at best indifferently neutral.\" Syrkin pointed to the debate in literary circles over fellow travellers and urged that such a debate begin in the film community. He did not deny that the technical expertise of specialists was vital, but that after the \"debacle\" of a film like Aelita (to be discussed below), leadership was clearly necessary: Give them ideological soil for work, say precisely and clearly what you need... and we, it seems at last, will have Soviet cinematography. Without this knowledge we will have empty, naked technique, at best with \"neutral,\" but nearly always with ideologically harmful content. If we have mastered technique, it would be odd not to master ideology.27\n\nThat anyone could think the Soviets had mastered technique was an ominous sign. Leningrad's Cinema Week was the most militant cinema publication (which lends piquancy to its absorption in March 1925 by Cinema Gazette, which then became Cinema [Kino]). It supported Syrkin in an editorial calling for political commissars in cinema in order to avoid further waste of money on films which were \"neutral or worse.\" Every director needed a permanent political adviser, as in the Army. The editorial continued: This work seems to us many times more important and immediate than the resolution of the general problems of our film industry. We do not need a cinema industry without ideological significance.28\n\nDirectors, as might be expected, were less than enthusiastic about this. All publicly admitted a certain necessity for political guidance, but one \"fellow traveller,\" director Cheslav Sabinskii, courageously and perceptively noted that having a political commissar on the premises during the actual shooting would be as absurd as having two conductors for an orchestra. Young directors like Abram Room who considered themselves truly \"Soviet\" assumed that they did not need political watchdogs and that the deployment of commissars would be restricted to the prerevolutionary directors.29 This complex problem of the relationship between the old and new cadres continued to be a major controversy, but fortunately for the development of Soviet cinema in the silent period, the idea of political commissars for the studios was ignored for the time being.\n\n28\n\nThe Turning Point\n\nCinefication (Kinofikatsia) Another sign of growing activity on the cinema front was that attention was at last turned to the countryside. It is hard to learn what was happening in the rural areas because as yet few cinema activists were much interested, especially true of those associated with Cinema Week (indicative of the cosmopolitanism of Leningrad). The Main Committee for Political Education (Glavpolitprosvet) was the section of the Commissariat of Enlightenment vested with authority in the arts; not surprisingly, it was the first organization to turn attention to the countryside. Significantly, its interest was commercial, not ideological—a plan to sell the projector GOZ. The staggering cost of 640 rubles (25 percent down, 75 percent in five months) was admitted to be \"rather high,\" but it was claimed the projectors could pay for themselves in three to six months.30 Glavpolitprosvet's uncertainty as to the success of this scheme was evident in the questions asked in their market survey: Was it economically feasible to buy a projector? Were any projectionists available? Critic Nikolai Lebedev energetically promoted sending movies to the countryside, not as entertainment or propaganda, but as an educational device, the most common attitude toward rural cinema. He therefore supported the newsreel and documentary as being \"more valuable than newspapers\" in a country with 70 percent illiteracy (an optimistic figure). Like Glavpolitprosvet, Lebedev hoped that such films could bring economic as well as political profit.31 If fiction films were to be shown in rural areas, they had to be simple and direct, attacking the evils of contemporary Soviet life, of which Lebedev saw many: ... we need pictures which in vivid and sarcastic images will \"flog\" the plagues of our present; which will show primitively but dynamically, the figures of the NEPman, his wife and progeny, will show the bureaucrat and the Soviet fool [sovdurak], will show careerists and toadies,... will show dozens of other deformed masks of our contemporary life.32\n\nFor the present, however, given the lack of Soviet production, Lebedev proposed re-editing imported detective and adventure films so that they would be suitable for peasants and workers.33 Lebedev had been a Party member since 1918, and his was an unusually tough political approach to cinema. But was it also the Party's attitude toward the function of cinema in Soviet society? The answer must be negative. The Party in 1924 was not monolithic, and interest in cinema was virtually nonexistent within higher Party circles. Lebedev was in fact a harsh critic of the Party's \"free market\" policies, like many other cinema activists. Some of Lebedev's demands were less controversial than his views on the types of film suitable for rural areas. He wanted to increase the availability of\n\nThe Turning Point\n\n29\n\nthe cinema to all areas of the country. His goal was that those in urban areas and in the armed forces should be able to see films once a week by 1930, and peasants about once a month—a modest and seemingly attainable aim.34 The \"film hunger\" and \"distribution disorder\" had to be ended35 to enable the expansion of the theater network. (The term \"cinefication\" was coined for this process.) In most cases the \"theater\" was a travelling projector (peredvizhok). After cinefication and presumably after the development of the Soviet film industry, a \"cultural-educational\" program of films was to gradually replace the \"bourgeois-entertainment\" films on the program.36 This stultifying prescription for cinema was only to be visited on the peasants, not city dwellers. One should keep in mind that Lebedev really meant educational films; he was no friend of Dziga Vertov's radical nonfiction cinema. But despite the sober virtuousness of the project, cinefication's supporters had difficulty attracting financial aid from the government, and their dreams were not soon realized. The Search for a Soviet Style: Realism The year 1924 was pivotal in the development of the film industry. Considering the severe financial problems and organizational chaos, it is no surprise that the mental energy of cinema activists was devoted, as we have seen, to practical matters. Unlike the period from 1919 to 1923, when theoretical issues predominated, in 1924 there was almost no such interest. Nevertheless, the sole book which might be considered \"purely\" theoretical, prerevolutionary scenarist Al. Voznesenskii's Art of the Screen (Iskusstvo ekrana) significantly contributed to the formation of a Soviet cinema aesthetic, although it was on the surface somewhat arcane. Voznesenskii, like his predecessors, believed that cinema, due to its inherent realism, was the art of the future. But he sharply disagreed that montage was the basis of cinema. This was, in his opinion, the \"illiterate mistake of the theatrical futurists.\" Montage was nothing more than the scenes in a play, therefore not original at all. The foundation of cinema, said Voznesenskii, was not form, but \"man and only man.\"37 Voznesenskii sought to humanize cinema by rejecting the tendency toward formalism that he"
