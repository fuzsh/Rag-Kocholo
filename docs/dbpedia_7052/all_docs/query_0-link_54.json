        "text": "100. A Few Days from the Life of I. I. Oblomov - Nikita Mikhalkov, 1980\n\nIf you’re too lazy to read this classic of Russian literature about laziness, this film is for you. Oblomov is played by the talented Oleg Tabakov: Most of the movie he spends loafing around on the couch, until a woman transforms his life.\n\n99. Intergirl - Pyotr Todorovsky, 1989\n\nIt’s difficult to imagine that this film was shot in the Soviet Union: hard-currency prostitutes, sex scenes, police brutality... For its time, the flick was a genuine movie revolution and earned itself a 16+ rating.\n\nThe plot revolves around a prostitute who dreams of finding a foreigner and going abroad. Having fulfilled her dream, the heroine feels alien and unwanted, but going back to the USSR is not an option...\n\n98. Little Vera - Vasily Pichul, 1988\n\nAnother film that shocked Soviet audiences in the perestroika years. And not without reason: it depicted the first sex scene in Russian cinema history. But the focus of the picture is a Turgenev-style intergenerational conflict.\n\nYoung Vera lives according to the laws of the new age, which her father cannot accept.\n\n97. The Woman Who Sings - Alexander Orlov, 1979\n\nA little-known singer, already experiencing difficulties, becomes a single mother. But then her fortune changes, she wins fame and public adoration, yet this does not bring personal happiness. The film can be said to be a fictionalized biopic of the Soviet cult singer Alla Pugacheva, who essentially plays herself.\n\n96. Kin-dza-dza - Georgy Daneliya, 1986\n\nLovers of Mad Max and the first Star Wars trilogy will be intrigued by this Soviet steampunk movie from director Georgy Daneliya: two random acquaintances find themselves in another galaxy, where they meet aliens who happen to have a spaceship.\n\nOn their quest to return to Earth, the pair experience all kinds of adventures. The only thing in their favor is that they have matches, which in this galaxy are worth their weight in gold...\n\n95. Mother - Vsevolod Pudovkin, 1926\n\nOne of the first Soviet propaganda films. The film’s hero is a revolutionary worker, while its anti-hero is his alcoholic father who supports the tsar. This family drama was based on the eponymous novel by Maxim Gorky.\n\n94. Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors - Sergey Paradzhanov, 1965\n\nAccording to Serbian film-maker Emir Kusturica, this is one of the best movies in the world. It is the story of Romeo and Juliet set among the Hutsul tribes of Ukraine. According to contemporaries, the director used the film to depict a personal tragedy of his own not unlike the Shakespearian original.\n\n93. Cine-Eye - Dziga Vertov, 1924\n\nVertov was to film what Malevich was to art—a tireless experimenter determined to break free of theatricality. Together with cameraman Mikhail Kaufman, he brought the avant-garde to the silver screen, shifting the camera angles and employing “disruptive-associative montage” techniques. In this silent film, he captures real life: here there are no actors, no staged shots.\n\n92. Ma-ma - Elizabeth Bostan, 1976\n\nA slightly psychedelic film musical based on the fairytale The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids: a mother goat goes in search of food, leaving her kids (quite literally) at home. They are kidnapped (again quite literally) by a gray wolf who demands a ransom... This is one of the first Soviet film musicals, and its songs are loved by children and adults alike.\n\n91. The Blonde Around the Corner - Vladimir Bortko, 1984\n\nBy Soviet standards, the blonde Nadezhda is a real go-getter. She knows where to get things that are in short supply, and is well connected and something of a VIP, since she works in a grocery store, which in the USSR is almost like being a factory boss.\n\nHaving fallen in love with a dreamy astrophysicist, she tries to remodel him, but he can think only of extraterrestrial civilizations. This is one of the last Soviet comedies, and a box office smash in its day.\n\n90. The Promised Heaven - Eldar Ryazanov, 1991\n\nThis is Maxim Gorky’s The Lower Depths in a tragicomic interpretation by the legendary Eldar Ryazanov. Homeless people live in a city dump, and, despite the threats from the authorities, do not want to leave the place they call home. So tanks are sent in to change their minds, but it no longer matters to them—they dream of ascending to a higher spiritual plain.\n\n89. Formula of Love - Mark Zakharov, 1984\n\nA Soviet film very much in the spirit of Woody Allen. Swindler and magician Count Cagliostro goes into hiding in the provinces after his latest scam is uncovered by an influential St. Petersburg prince. There, Cagliostro continues his jiggery-pokery, promising a young man in love with a statue to bring it to life; but the charlatan’s main goal is to unravel the formula of love, in order to further manipulate people.\n\n88. Desyat Negrityat - Stanislav Govorukhin, 1988\n\nA popular screen version of a novel by queen of crime Agatha Christie. Ten strangers with no connection to one another arrive on a remote island at the invitation of the owner, who seems to be absent. One by one they come to a macabre end.\n\nThis spine-chilling tale was brilliantly played by a stellar cast of Russian actors. Incidentally, for reasons of political correctness, the title in English underwent various changes, and is today known as And Then There Were None.\n\n87. The Wedding - Isidor Annensky, 1944\n\nThe virtuoso actress Faina Ranevskaya is remembered to this day for her razor-sharp, side-splitting phrases that have since become aphorisms. In this film based on stories by Chekhov, she plays the most frequent target of all Russian jokes—the mother-in-law. A very funny film about the pre-revolutionary petty bourgeois.\n\n86. Alexander Nevsky - Sergei Eisenstein, 1938\n\nThis historical film by the cult director and innovator Eisenstein, commissioned by the Soviet state, was intended to raise public morale and patriotic spirit.\n\nThe tight schedule meant that the large-scale Battle of the Ice scene, in which the knights were supposed to fall through a frozen lake, had to be shot in summer. The “ice” was asphalt sprinkled with salt and wooden boards painted white.\n\n85. The Return - Andrey Zvyagintsev, 2003\n\nThe sullen father of two boys returns home after several years’ absence. The boys do not know where he’s been and are very wary of him. As if nothing had happened, he takes his sons away from home on a trip...\n\nAndrei Zvyagintsev’s first picture won him a Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival and recognition as one of the most outstanding directors of modern times.

His big-shot companion Rogozhin talks about his new flame, a certain Nastasya Filippovna. Myshkin blindly falls in love with her image.

Hipsters - Valery Todorovsky, 2008\n\nA tale about Soviet rock-and-rollers, who illegally buy foreign fashion items, listen to banned Western music, dance boogie-woogie, and, of course, fall in love.\n\nTheir underground get-togethers are dispersed by voluntary units of diehard communists, and they are condemned at party meetings. Todorovsky’s nostalgic film musical performed well at the box office on release.\n\n82. Legend № 17 - Nikolai Lebedev, 2013\n\nThis biopic of famous Soviet hockey player Valery Kharlamov traces his rise to glory from a provincial Urals club to CSKA Moscow and the USSR’s demolition of Canada in the first game of the 1972 Summit Series.

White Bim Black Ear, Stanislav Rostotsky, 1977\n\nIf the film Hachiko made you shed a tear, you’ll need a bucket for White Bim, as two generations of Russians have already found out. Bim, a Gordon Setter puppy with one black ear, lives with hunter Ivan Ivanovich. When his owner ends up in the hospital, Bim goes in search of him...\n\n79. Ivan the Terrible - Sergei Eisenstein, 1945\n\nThis film about Russia’s most notorious medieval tsar was another one tasked with raising the public’s patriotic spirit, while simultaneously justifying the iron rule of the “father of nations” Joseph Stalin (who was reportedly an admirer of Ivan the Terrible).\n\nThe film was commissioned by the state during the Great Patriotic War, and many of the actors were suffering from hunger. Three parts were initially planned, but Eisenstein died, leaving only two.\n\n78. Kuban Cossacks - Ivan Pyryev, 1950\n\nA musical comedy about a competition between two collective farms as they prepare for a fair. The post-war hunger is glossed over, with the film showing an abundance of food and merrymaking.\n\nPyryev was a director at the Mosfilm studio, before serving for more than a decade as chairman of the USSR State Committee for Cinematographers. In that capacity, he was essentially the country’s chief censor, and from the viewpoint of Soviet ideology his film was nothing if not exemplary.\n\n77. Peculiarities of the National Hunt - Alexander Rogozhkin, 1995\n\nA foreigner visits Russia to study the national customs and traditions, and gets more than he bargained for. What starts off as a hunt descends into mayhem with more than a few crates of vodka along the way.\n\nThe comedy regularly reduces Russians to tears of laughter (or otherwise), because they recognize themselves only too well in these outlandish escapades.\n\n76. Solaris - Andrey Tarkovsky, 1972\n\nA psychologist arrives at the Solaris space station and discovers strange goings-on: all the scientists on board are suffering from some kind of mental illness.

Tarkovsky’s sci-fi drama was adapted for screen from the novel by Polish writer Stanislav Lem, and it still inspires many filmmakers and artists to this day.\n\n75. Big School-Break - Alexey Korenev, 1972\n\nAn implausibly kind-hearted four-part film about a night school for young workers. History teacher Nestor, fresh out of college and with a name like a medieval chronicler, has to cope with a very difficult, but highly talented class in which many students are much older and more experienced lifewise than he is.\n\n74. Hello, I’m Your Aunt - Victor Titov, 1975\n\nSoviet directors loved bringing English classics to the screen, but this film version of Brandon Thomas’s Charley’s Aunt is still the one to beat. This comedy farce, in which the hero hides from the police by pretending to be the rich “Donna Lucia” from Brazil, employs a now standard plot device—the “donna” is wildy popular with would-be husbands…\n\n73. Spring - Grigory Alexandrov, 1947\n\nAn operetta actress is asked to play the role of a scientist in a new film. But the theater and cinema rehearsal times clash, and she can’t be in two places at once. Luckily, she manages to find a real-life scientist who looks just like her.

The Adventures of Buratino - Leonid Nechaev, 1976\n\nThis Russian version of Pinocchio is one of the most beloved tales of Soviet children. The movie’s original soundtrack was voted into the Golden Fund of Russian Film Music.\n\n71. The 9th Company - Fedor Bondarchuk, 2005\n\nThe Soviet-Afghan war has long been a sore spot in Russia, which is why there are so few films about it. But that didn’t deter director Fedor Bondarchuk, who made a gut-wrenching blockbuster in the spirit of U.S. films about Vietnam.\n\n70. Dersu Uzala - Akira Kurosawa, 1975\n\nThis Soviet-Japanese coproduction, directed by Japan’s Akira Kurosawa and shot in Russian, won an Oscar for best foreign film.

Sportloto-82 - Leonid Gaidai, 1982\n\nA comedy about a pair of speculators who go in search of a winning lottery ticket. The film topped the Soviet box office in 1982 with 55 million viewers.

Another perestroika film that vividly depicts the new era and even the first Soviet break-dance.\n\n67. The Barber of Siberia - Nikita Mikhalkov, 1998\n\nA sumptuous saga about a young cadet in Tsarist Russia. He falls in love with a daring American lady, and is ready to do anything to defend her and his own honor. It features Russian actor Oleg Menshikov with Hollywood star Julia Ormond.\n\nThe film is also famous for then-President Boris Yeltsin allowing the illuminated Kremlin stars to be turned off for the first time since the Great Patriotic War.\n\n66. Piter FM - Oksana Bychkova, 2006\n\nThis romantic story set in summertime St. Petersburg was a true cinematic event in 2006, despite the no-frills plot. Masha, a young woman, loses her mobile phone. It is found by Maxim, who wants to return it. But try as they might, the couple are fated not to meet, always missing each other by a split second. Long chats over the phone inevitably lead to deeper feelings.\n\n65. How Viktor \"the Garlic\" Took Alexey \"the Stud\" to the Nursing Home - Alexander Hunt, 2017\n\nDon’t be put off by the title. The debut film of director Alexander Khant has a meaty plot and some real folk heroes. In this adventure road movie, lowlife Vitka discovers that he has a criminal father who is now disabled. He can get his father’s apartment if only he can put him in a nursing home...\n\n64. Man with a Movie Camera - Dziga Vertov, 1929\n\nA documentary film by avant-garde filmmaker Vertov about a day in the life of the young Soviet Union: cars and buses trundle along, workers toil away in factories, pedestrians hurry by.

Both are proud, principled Soviet people, and their relationship is a rocky ride.\n\n62. Amphibian Man, Vladimir Chebotaryov, Gennady Kazansky, 1962\n\nThe Oscar-winning The Shape of Water fades in comparison with this Soviet adaptation of the sci-fi novel by Alexander Belyaev, also called Amphibian Man.\n\nInstead of a green monster, Vladimir Korenev plays the role of Ichthyander, a handsome youth surgically altered to survive under the sea. There, he lives with his dolphin friends, until one day by chance he rescues a beautiful girl from drowning. Now he wants to become a normal human being, but, alas, he cannot live long without water.\n\n61. Andrei Rublev - Andrei Tarkovsky, 1966\n\nEight cinematic novellas tell about the life of the ancient Russian monk and icon painter Andrei Rublev.

Tarkovsky’s masterpiece is highly rated abroad, too, and regularly appears in Top 100 lists of the best films ever made in any language.\n\n60. The Battleship Potemkin - Sergei Eisenstein, 1925\n\nAlthough few modern viewers would voluntarily sit through this epic, it is rightly included in all textbooks on the history of cinema. Legendary director Sergei Eisenstein shows events from the first Russian revolution of 1905: sailors aboard the Potemkin refuse to eat maggot-infested meat and mutiny against their commanding officers. One of the most memorable scenes of the film—the much-imitated (and parodied) Odessa steps sequence—is perhaps the most recognizable moment in world cinema.\n\n59. War and Peace - Sergey Bondarchuk, 1966\n\nThis story of several families in Russia set against the backdrop of the Napoleonic Wars from 1805 to 1812 won an Oscar for best foreign film. Critics consider it to be the best adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's epic.

Afonya - Georgy Daneliya, 1975\n\nPoor, lonely plumber Afonya is a shoddy worker and full-time alcoholic. He is reprimanded by his superiors and threatened with dismissal, but that has little effect.

An Ordinary Miracle - Mark Zakharov, 1979\n\nThe film, based on the play by Evgeny Schwartz, tells the story of a bear transformed into a youth through witchcraft. If he kisses the princess, he will turn back into a beast, but he wants to remain human...\n\nThis beloved Soviet fairytale for adults was first shown on January 1, the day when many hope for a new life and an ordinary miracle. That’s probably why it’s still popular today.\n\n56. The Student - Kirill Serebrennikov, 2016\n\nA high school student becomes a religious fanatic, and takes everything he hears and reads horribly literally. He forces others to live by his dogmas, with disastrous consequences.\n\nMade by renowned theater and film director Kirill Serebrennikov, the film developed out of his successful stage production at the Moscow Gogol Center.

Everyone Dies But Me - Valeriya Gai Germanika, 2008\n\nThis coming-of-age drama went down a storm when it debuted at Cannes.

They Fought for Their Country - Sergey Bondarchuk, 1975\n\nThis screen adaptation of the eponymous novel by Mikhail Sholokhov was made by Oscar-winner Bondarchuk.

We’ll Live Till Monday - Stanislav Rostotsky, 1968\n\nThe film depicts three days in the life of an ordinary Soviet school against the backdrop of a love story between a new, young female teacher and an older colleague.

Unbelievable Adventures of Italians in Russia - Eldar Ryazanov, Franco Prosperi, 1974\n\nIt turns out that St. Petersburg is home to a huge number of lion statues. To find the one with treasure buried underneath, Italian crooks dig under all of them in turn. The blame for everything lies with an elderly Russian émigré who hid treasure under a lion during the revolution.\n\nThe film features many special effects, not inferior to Hollywood for the time, including a gas station explosion and a car chase. Without stunt doubles, the actors themselves jumped over a moveable bridge in St. Petersburg and clambered out the window of a multistory building down knotted bed sheets.\n\n46. Two Comrades Were Serving - Evgeny Karelov, 1968\n\nOne of the finest films about the Russian Civil War, which even history teachers advise watching. A detachment of White Guards is surrounded in Crimea by the Red Army.

Viy - Konstantin Ershov, Georgy Kropachyov, 1967\n\nSoviet horror films can be counted on the fingers of one hand. But watching Viy, you risk turning gray, just like the character at the end of the movie.

Spoiler alert: The girl turns out to be a witch, and rises from the grave on the very first night.\n\n44.

The young man is called up for frontline service, while his girlfriend remains in Moscow and ends up marrying another man.\n\nThe film is not recommended to those of an overly sensitive disposition.

And Quiet Flows the Don - Sergey Gerasimov, 1958\n\nIf you haven’t read Mikhail Sholokhov’s four-volume epic about the Russian Civil War, described as the War and Peace of the 20th century, then you definitely need to watch this screen adaptation of the Nobel prize-winning novel.\n\nThe October Revolution turned the lives of millions upside down.

October - Sergei Eisenstein, 1927\n\nThe storming of the Winter Palace by sailors in this film is often mistaken for real historical footage. Slightly embellishing reality, Eisenstein shows the overthrow of tsarist power and establishment of Bolshevik rule. It is a cinematic ode to the October Revolution, which was top of mind last year on the occasion of the 100th anniversary.\n\n39. The Adventures of Electronics (miniseries) - Konstantin Bromberg, 1980\n\nAll children dream of having a twin who could sit exams for them.

She is saved and sheltered by a deaf stripper, who wants to go far, far away to the “country of the deaf,” her own private promised land...\n\nIt was one of the first (and still few) films in Russia to address the topic of disability, and won audiences’ hearts thanks to the superb acting duet of Dina Korzun and Chulpan Khamatova.\n\n37.

Walking the Streets of Moscow - Georgy Daneliya, 1964\n\nThe eponymous song from the film has become almost more popular than the film itself, and is one of the most frequently performed in Russia today.

It was also the acting debut of future Oscar-winning director Nikita Mikhalkov.\n\n32. The Garage - Eldar Ryazanov, 1979\n\nA society of garage owners meets to discuss a hot topic: some members will have to lose their garages to make way for a new road. In the midst of the fractious debate, it turns out that someone has locked the door to the room and hidden the key—everyone will have to spend the entire night under the same roof.\n\nFilmed in just 24 days, Eldar Ryazanov’s touching comedy, based on a real-life meeting that he once attended, has become a classic.\n\n31.

Meanwhile, zinc coffins bearing the bodies of Soviet soldiers killed in Afghanistan are shipped back home, but there is not even any one to bury them...\n\nThe film, shown at the Venice Festival, is full of violence and corpses, made even more shocking by being based on real events.

The Meeting Place Cannot Be Changed (miniseries) - Stanislav Govorukhin, 1979\n\nCrime in the USSR is said to have dropped during the hours that this was aired on TV.

Officers - Vladimir Rogovoy, 1971\n\nThis film about ambition, duty, and love tells the story of one family in which the men of each generation all have to fight in different wars.

Welcome, or No Trespassing - Elem Klimov, 1964\n\nHave you ever been to a pioneer camp? Watch this movie and you will have.

Another intensely powerful WWII movie.\n\n23. The Girls - Yuri Chulyukin, 1961\n\nA comedy about the cook Toska, who falls in love with a ladies’ man who works at a Soviet construction site. Both are proud, so neither wants to be the first to show their feelings.\n\nThe film’s glorification of the working class and the now defunct dream of a “bright future” has not stopped it becoming an all-time classic. An added bonus is the chance to find out about lots of potato-based recipes.\n\n22. Operation Y and Shurik’s Other Adventures - Leonid Gaidai, 1965\n\nStudent Shurik is forever getting into scrapes. In the first adventure, he has to confront a bully at a construction site. In the second, revising for his exams on the move, he is so engrossed in his textbook that he doesn’t notice all kinds of dangers around. And in the third, he inadvertently thwarts a gang of crooks...\n\nShurik was a folk hero in the USSR, the image of the exemplary student and Komsomol member.

Kidnapping, Caucasian Style - Leonid Gaidai, 1967\n\nIn this sequel to Operation Y, Shurik goes on an expedition to the Caucasus to learn about local customs and drinking toasts.

The Mirror - Andrei Tarkovsky, 1974\n\nA key work in the filmography of cult director Tarkovsky, The Mirror is a stream-of-consciousness meditation on memory.

Carnival Night - Eldar Ryazanov, 1956\n\nYoung workers at a Soviet House of Culture rehearse for a New Year’s Eve performance, but the director wants to turn the fun and dancing into a boring official event.

Seventeen Moments of Spring (miniseries) - Tatiana Lioznova, 1973\n\nA Soviet intelligence officer penetrates the highest echelons of the SS in Nazi Germany under the name Stirlitz.

Office Romance - Eldar Ryazanov, 1977\n\nLyudmila Prokofyevna is so accustomed to running a large enterprise with an iron fist and an unimaginative dress sense that she seems to have forgotten that she is a young, attractive, and still single woman. The intrigue starts when one of her employees asks her out for a bet, hoping to climb the career ladder, but ends up actually falling in love with his boss.\n\nThis romantic comedy about office drones topped the Soviet box office in its year of release, and is one of the most frequently shown films on TV today.\n\n14. D’Artagnan and the Three Musketeers - Georgy Yungvald-Khilkevich, 1978\n\nIt is not clear what Soviet children loved more: the Dumas novel or this film adaptation, which turned actor Mikhail Boyarsky into the eternal image of D’Artagnan.\n\nThe three-part film features a wonderful cast and tunes that have practically become folk songs. Incidentally, to make the film look more “French,” it was shot on location in Ukraine, mainly Lviv and Odessa.\n\n13. Burnt by the Sun - Nikita Mikhalkov, 1994\n\nHaving gone missing after the Civil War in Russia, Mitya suddenly turns up at the house of his former beloved Marusya during the terrible years of the Stalinist purges. She is now married to a Soviet officer, and does not know that her old flame has come to destroy her new one...\n\nThis multi-layered psychological drama is another Russian Oscar winner. Events unfold to the sound of the soul-wrenching tango “Tired Sun.”\n\n12. The Twelve Chairs - Leonid Gaidai, 1971\n\nOstap Bender, a charming conman, is searching for diamonds hidden inside an antique set of chairs by the mother-in-law of a random acquaintance just before she died. The problem is that the chairs have been sold off individually and are now spread across the country...\n\nThis screen adaptation of the comic novel by satirical co-authors Ilya Ilf and Yevgeny Petrov became an instant movie classic thanks in large part to actor Archil Gomiashvili’s brilliant portrayal of Bender, and the many memorable lines that are still quoted today.\n\n11. The Diamond Arm - Leonid Gaidai, 1969\n\nSmugglers mistakenly place jewels in the cast of the wrong person, and then chase after the unsuspecting, respectable family man. The young Andrei Mironov woke up to nationwide fame after the premiere of this comedy. The film was seen by a then-record 76.7 million people.\n\n10. Heart of a Dog - Vladimir Bortko, 1988\n\nWhat happens if human organs are transplanted into a dog? Soviet professor Preobrazhensky decides to try. The result of this experiment, Comrade Sharikov, looks human, but behaves like a canine. Based on the popular story by Mikhail Bulgakov, the film version is just as well-loved.\n\n9. Belorussky Station - Andrei Smirnov, 1971\n\nWWII comrades return from the frontline to Belorussky Station in Moscow, and each goes his own separate way. They meet again only a quarter of a century later—at the funeral of their friend. This is one of the most tear-jerking war films, in which Bulat Okudzhava’s song “We Need One Victory for All,” still popular today, sounded for the first time.\n\n8. The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson (miniseries) - Igor Maslennikov, 1979–86\n\nThe Soviet screen version of Conan Doyle is one of the best in the world, even according to British critics. Actor Vasily Livanov was awarded the Order of the British Empire for his role as the legendary detective. A Holmes-and-Watson statue modeled on the Soviet actors was installed at the British Embassy in Moscow.\n\n7. Stalker - Andrei Tarkovsky, 1979\n\nThe central character, known as the Stalker, earns his living by leading people into the Zone, an area formed after the fall of a meteorite where the normal rules of reality do not apply.

The Stalker agrees, but has no idea what plans these seemingly ordinary people are hatching...\n\nThis film parable is based on the sci-fi story Roadside Picnic by the Strugatsky Brothers, who also worked on the screenplay. It is one of the most popular films of this legendary director.\n\n6. Hedgehog in the Fog - Yuri Norstein, 1975\n\nThis philosophical cartoon for children and adults about a hedgehog who loses his way in the fog and falls into a river, but is taken to his destination by the current, is still spellbinding today. In 2003, in Tokyo, Norstein’s masterpiece was recognized as the best animated film of all time.\n\n5. Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears - Vladimir Menshov, 1980\n\nA provincial woman arrives in Moscow, pretends to be the daughter of a professor, and gets pregnant by a Muscovite from an intellectual family. The marriage having failed, she has to raise her child alone, while working and studying at the same time. Twenty years later, she becomes the director of a large enterprise...\n\nThis movie about dreams coming true picked up an Oscar for best foreign film.\n\n4. Brigade (miniseries) - Alexey Sidorov, 2002\n\nFour childhood friends looking for easy money get involved in criminal dealings. It took many more roles after this series for the leading actor, Sergey Bezrukov, to stop being associated with the gangster Sasha Bely.\n\nBrigade is Russia’s answer to The Godfather and probably the most accurate and atmospheric series about the criminal 1990s.\n\n3. Assa - Sergei Solovyov, 1987\n\nThis film, about the relationship between the girlfriend of a crime boss and a musician she meets by chance, became a symbol of Gorbachev’s perestroika.\n\nThis was largely due to the soundtrack, which was recorded by various underground Soviet rock bands, including the legendary Kino and their iconic song “We Want Changes!”\n\n2. Brother - Alexei Balabanov, 1997\n\nDanila Bagrov, an everyday guy with strong principles, helps his brother after the latter gets embroiled with gangsters in the lawless free-for-all that was 1990s Russia. Like Assa, released ten years earlier, the film was also the soundtrack of its time, with many songs by Russia’s best rock groups.\n\n1. The Irony of Fate, or May the Steam Be with You - Eldar Ryazanov, 1975\n\n“Every year on December 31, me and my friends go to the bathhouse,” Zhenya, the likeable hero of the tale, repeats throughout the film. In Russian minds, this phrase is forever associated, besides New Year, with a situation that might (or did) go horribly, but amusingly wrong.\n\nThe film has been shown on December 31 every year without fail since its release, keeping countless people entertained while cooking and preparing for New Year. If anyone is bored of seeing it, they haven’t said so.\n\nREAD MORE: 112 Russian writers ranging from great, to absolutely freaking great\n\nIf using any of Russia Beyond's content, partly or in full, always provide an active hyperlink to the original material."
