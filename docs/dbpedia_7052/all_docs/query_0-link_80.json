        "text": "Marco Ferreri: L'uomo dei cinque palloni / Break-Up / The Man With the Balloons (IT/FR 1969) (2016 restoration in 4K L'Immagine Ritrovata) starring Catherine Spaak (Giovanna) and Marcello Mastroianni (Mario).\n\n1963–1967 Italia–Francia\n\nProd.: Carlo Ponti per Compagnia Cinematografica Champion-Les Films Concordia. DCP 4K. D.: 86’. Bn e Col.\n\nSog., Scen.: Marco Ferreri, Rafael Azcona. F.: Aldo Tonti. M.: Enzo Micarelli. Scgf.: Carlo Egidi. Mus.: Teo Usuelli.\n\nInt.: Marcello Mastroianni (Mario), Catherine Spaak (Giovanna), Ugo Tognazzi (automobilista), William Berger (Benny), Ennio Balbo, Marco Ferreri.\n\nPremiere of the episode L'uomo dei 5 palloni in the episode film Oggi, domani, dopodomani: in Italy, 22 Dec 1965.\n\nPremiere: in France, 2 July 1969.\n\nThe film was not released in Finland.\n\nItalian version with English subtitles\n\nRecovered & Restored 2017\n\nCopy from Cineteca di Bologna\n\nRestored in 4K in 2016 by Cineteca di Bologna and Museo Nazionale del Cinema di Torino, in collaboration with Warner Bros., with the support of Massimo Sordella and Nuovo Imaie, at L’Immagine Ritrovata laboratory, from the 4K scan of a vintage interpositive and a sound positive preserved by Warner Bros. Thanks to CSC – Cineteca Nazionale for providing as reference for the restoration the 35 mm copy struck from the original negative at Turner International, Los Angeles\n\nMidnight Sun Film Festival (MSFF) online 20 June 2021, with English subtitles.\n\nTheme: Treasures from Il Cinema Ritrovato.\n\nMSFF online, viewed on a 4K tv set in Lappeenranta, Midsummer Eve, 26 June 2021.\n\n” I always liked him because he gave actors free rein and because he had a great quality: he said little. \" – Marcello Mastroianni on Marco Ferreri\n\n\" I got him because he didn’t act, he naturally became part of the film, always present, especially in moments of silence. \" – Marco Ferreri on Marcello Mastroianni\n\nGian Luca Farinelli (Il Cinema Ritrovato, 2017) : \" Break Up is an invisible film, a film that not many viewers got to see. Despite being the first encounter between Mastroianni and Ferreri and one of Mastroianni’s most extraordinary performances, it is one of the least known films of European post-war cinema. Up until this restoration and its presentation at the 2016 Venice Film Festival, where it won the Leone d’Oro for best restoration. \"\n\n\" Work on Break Up ended in December 1963. In January 1964 the film was ready, and it received the censor’s certificate, but Carlo Ponti decided to stop its release and transformed it into a 25-minute short as an episode of the film Oggi, domani, dopodomani, which included two other episodes directed by Luciano Salce and Eduardo De Filippo. In 1967 Ponti and Ferreri met up again, and Ferreri shot a new episode in color. The film was ready, but after a short distribution period in France and the United States it vanished. In 1979 Ferreri donated a black and white 16 mm print to Lab80 in Bergamo for small independent distribution. \"\n\n\" For such a little-seen movie, it certainly has many names: L’uomo dei palloncini, L’uomo dei cinque palloni (L’Homme aux cinq ballons) and finally Break Up, which was probably Ponti’s invention after the success of Blow-up. Ponti sold the film to MGM, and later the rights were passed on to Warner Bros., where the interpositive was found (the negative, instead, has been lost). \"\n\n\" Seeing the film today is an incredible experience: it anticipates the party of Hollywood Party, Kim Basinger’s striptease in 9½ Weeks, with a singer who looks like Belushi before Belushi ever appeared; a film in which we can admire Morandi’s paintings and listen to one of the most popular singers of that time, Orietta Berti. We can already see in it the Ferreri of abstraction, a non-ideological filmmaker, who creates paradoxical stories and reveals the contradiction of a consumer society. Break Up’s screenplay was written by Rafael Azcona, the screenwriter of all of Ferreri’s best films (El pisito, La donna scimmia, La Grande Bouffe…). \" – Gian Luca Farinelli (Il Cinema Ritrovato, 2017)\n\nAA: Having seen Marco Ferreri's La donna scimmia (1964) for the first time three years ago made me desire to see other films by Ferreri from what I surmise was his greatest period, 1963–1969.\n\nBreak Up unfortunately proves disappointing, but that may be partly due to its erratic production and distribution history, as outlined by Gian Luca Farinelli above.\n\nAs opposed to the deeply felt La donna scimmia, Break Up feels shallow in the same way as Ferreri's later great commercial hit films such as La grande bouffe. It belongs to the category of art exploitation.\n\nIn La donna scimmia, Ferreri and Azcona let themselves be inspired by Fellini, and the result was original and personal.\n\nIn Break Up, the inspiration is Antonioni: Blow Up but somewhat also his trilogy of solitude. However, the result feels meaningless and trivial.\n\nFor a moment I was thinking about Jörn Donner who started with a cycle of films inspired by Antonioni's trilogy of solitude but then changed tack and made a series of spoof sex films. In them, Donner was not following the Antonioni inspiration. But Ferreri seems to have had as his model the sex orgy sequence of Blow Up.\n\nThe title Break Up refers to a central theme in Ferreri's art exploitation films. In this film, Marcello Mastroianni wants to find out how much air an air balloon can contain until it bursts. Finally, balloons break up in the orgy sequence. In La grande bouffe, four friends eat themselves to death. In the all-nude sex tragedy La dernière femme, Gérard Depardieu keeps cutting pieces from salami with an electric knife, until he has had enough of coitus...\n\nMarcello Mastroianni commits an even more desperate act in the end of Break Up. Ferreri's film is both shallow and desperate, and not a little boring.\n\nCatherine Spaak is very appealing in the female leading role, and she is spared from sexploitation for a change. But she is given little to do. Her character is frustrated with Mastroianni's aloofness, and we can sense that the actress is equally frustrated with this Ferreri-Azcona nonsense.\n\nSergei Loznitsa: Государственные похороны / Gosudarstvennye pokhorony / State Funeral (NL/LT 2019). A compilation of news footage from Stalin's funeral.\n\nГосударственные похороны / Gosudarstvennyje pohorony.\n\nDirector: Sergei Loznitsa\n\nProduction: ATOMS & VOID (Sergei Loznitsa, Maria Choustova), Studio Uljana Kim (Uljana Kim)\n\n135’\n\nLanguage: Russian\n\nCountry: Netherlands, Lithuania\n\nScreenplay: Sergei Loznitsa\n\nEditor: Danielius Kokanauskis\n\nSound: Vladimir Golovnitski\n\nFestival premiere: 6 Sep 2019 Venice Film Festival.\n\nMidnight Sun Film Festival (MSFF) online 20 June 2021, with English subtitles.\n\nMSFF online, viewed on a 4K tv set in Lappeenranta, Midsummer Eve, 26 June 2021.\n\nVenice Film Festival 2019: “ Unique, mostly unseen before, archive footage from March 1953, presents the funeral of Joseph Stalin as the culmination of the dictator’s personality cult. The news of Stalin’s death on March 5, 1953, shocked the entire Soviet Union. The burial ceremony was attended by tens of thousands of mourners. We observe every stage of the funeral spectacle, described by Pravda newspaper as “the Great Farewell”, and receive an unprecedented access to the dramatic and absurd experience of life and death under Stalin’s reign. ”\n\n“ The film addresses the issue of Stalin’s personality cult as a form of terror-induced delusion. It gives an insight into the nature of the regime and its legacy, still haunting the contemporary world. ” Venice Film Festival 2019\n\nDirector’s Statement:\n\n“ The death of Stalin meant the death of an epoch. Without even realising this, millions of people, mourning the Leader in March 1953, were also living through a life-changing experience in their own private histories. ”\n\n“ It is crucial for me to bring the spectator inside this experience not as an impartial observer of a historical event or an admirer of rare archival footage, but as a participant and a witness of a grandiose, terrifying and grotesque spectacle, revealing the essence of a tyrannical regime. ”\n\n“ I see this film as a visual study of the nature of Stalin’s personality cult and an attempt to deconstruct the ritual, which formed the foundation of the bloody regime. It is unthinkable that today, in Moscow circa 2019, 66 years after Stalin’s death, thousands of people gather at his tomb on March 5th, in order to lay flowers and mourn his death. I believe it’s my duty as a filmmaker to employ the power of documentary image to appeal to the minds of my contemporaries, and to seek truth. ” Director’s Statement\n\nAA: Sergei Loznitsa's feature-length documentary has been created with the Emile de Antonio method. The documents speak for themselves. There is no commentary.\n\nOnly the end titles give us a resume of Stalin's legacy: 27 million murdered, executed, tortured, deported, and 15 million starved to death. The De-Stalinization started in 1956, and Stalin's body was removed from the mausoleum in 1961.\n\nThe technical quality of the footage is brilliant. The film looks like shot today. It is immersive, as if we were there.\n\nThe cult of personality is crystallized at the moment of death in slogans such as: \"Fulfill Stalin's immortal cause\", \"Stalin is dead: long live Stalin\"\n\nThe scope and depth of the national mourning epic is extraordinary. We visit the entire Soviet Union, from the Black Sea oil rigs to the reindeer-herding Nenets, from the Altai region to Khabarovsk, from Tallinn to Riga, from Moscow to Minsk and Vladivostok. The news spreads from the village radios to Estonia's Rahva Hääl. All newspapers feature the photo of Stalin, often an identical one. Flags are pulled down to half-mast. Engine drivers sound their alarm whistles in chorus. Gun salutes are made. Moments of silence are staged. The Soviet empire falls silent. The mobilization is immense. The mourning crowds are endless, as are funeral wreaths. The feeling of profound grief and helplessness is genuine and ubiquitous.\n\nWe are left to contemplate the multiple layers and meanings of this mysterious sorrow.\n\nA film within the film, reassembled, is the vintage official Stalin funeral documentary, Velikoye proshchaniye / Великое прощание / Great Mourning / Le Grand Adieu (SU 1953, 65 min), directed (n.c.) by Grigori Aleksandrov, Mikhail Chiaureli, Sergei Gerasimov, Ilya Kopalin, Irina Setkina and Elizabeta Svilova (the wife of Dziga Vertov). We are reminded of Vertov's Three Songs About Lenin (1934), itself a problematic film, made under the control of Stalin. 195 cinematographers are credited.\n\nBesides the dead Stalin, the film features Georgi Malenkov, Lavrenti Beria, Kliment Voroshilov, Vyacheslav Molotov, Nikolai Bulganin, Nikita Khrushchev, Lazar Kaganovich, Anastas Mikoyan, as well as Svetlana Alliluyeva and Vasili Stalin. The main speakers are Khrushchev, Malenkov, Beria and Molotov.\n\nVisitors from China include Zhou Enlai, Guo Moruo and Li Fuchun, from Poland, Bolesław Bierut and Konstantin Rokossovsky, from Czechoslovakia, Klement Gottwald, from Hungary, Mátyás Rákosi and István Dobi, from Rumania, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, from Albania, Spiro Koleka, from Bulgaria, Valko Chervenkov, from Mongolia, Yumgaagiin Tsedenbal and Nudenhuugiin Yadamzhav, from the GDR, Max Reimann, Walter Ulbricht, Otto Grotewohl and Wilhelm Ziesser.\n\nFrom France, there is Jacques Duclos, from Italy, Palmiro Togliatti and Pietro Nenni, from Great Britain, Harry Pollitt and Peter Kerrigan, from Austria, Johann Koplenig, from the Spanish exile, Dolores Ibárruri, and from the Philippines, Jesus Lava.\n\nFew are those who are not Communist insiders. From India, there is Saifuddin Kitchlew. And from Finland, State Minister Urho Kekkonen, the lone panther in this crowd.\n\nOn the soundtrack, we never hear the revolutionary funeral march, \"Замучен тяжелой неволей\" (обр. Л. Шульгина – Г. Мачтет, 1876) / \"Sait kärsiä puolesta aatteen\" / \"Slavery and Suffering\".\n\nInstead, the soundtrack is based on classical music:\n\n– Schumann: Kinderszenen 6: Träumerei, Op. 15\n\n– Tchaikovsky: 6. Symphony, Op. 74\n\n– Tchaikovsky: 5. Symphony, Op. 64\n\n– Schubert: Klaviertrio No. 2, D 929, Op. 100\n\n– Mendelssohn: Lieder ohne Worte: Op. 62 Nr. 3 Andante maestoso e-Moll MWV U 177 \"Trauermarsch\"\n\n– Mozart: Requiem, K. 626\n\n– Chopin: Marche funèbre, Op. 35\n\nIf memory serves, there was a distant echo of Beethoven: 3. Sinfonie \"Eroica\" Op. 55, 2. Satz: \"Marcia funebre\"\n\nWith a harrowing Stalin cult of personality anthem:\n\n– Matvei Blanter: \"Колыбельная\" / \"Lullaby\", lyr. Isaak Dunayevsky, perf. Sergei Lemeshev (1949) .\n\nAfter all these years, André Bazin's classic essay \"Le Cinéma Soviétique et le mythe de Staline\" (1950), with an appendix added to Qu'est-ce que le cinéma? I (1958), quoting Khrushchev's anti-Stalin speech \"On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences\" (1956), remains the superior analysis of the theme. Although written by Bazin while Stalin was still alive, it is also illuminating about his funeral hagiography.\n\nKiyoshi Kurosawa: スパイの妻 / Spy no tsuma / Wife of a Spy (JP 2020).

Originally produced for NHK’s BS8K satellite channel, the film was shot as a slightly experimental endeavor in UHDTV which means: the images have an almost unreal sharpness – Kurosawa Kiyoshi shows a world brutally devoid of any mystery, and so present that past and future feel illusory.\"\n\n\"The cinema-version was mellowed down to 2K, color-graded more warmly and given a different aspect ratio which all lends it a breezier air making it feel a bit closer to the cinema it alluded to and riffs about. And all that for a story centered on a film shot on 9.5 mm, an amateur format developed by Pathé that was popular in Japan during the 30s and 40s!\"\n\n\"Here, it is used for a delightful short about a cat burglar as well as a clandestinely shot documentary of Japanese atrocities in occupied Manchuria. Both are made by an import-export entrepreneur from Kōbe whose true game we’ll never understand fully, and neither will his wife whom he uses, and neither will an old friend who’s now serving with the kempeitai (= Secret Police)… Rarely did cloak and dagger look more elegant and refined, but also melancholic and wistful!\"\n\n\"They don’t make the likes of Kurosawa Kiyoshi anymore, at least outside Japan: an auteur who really worked his way up through cinema’s production ranks. He started out with amateur films; did get his professional training with pink eiga (Kandagawa inran sensō, 1983); could direct his first general release feature (Sweet Home, 1986); honed his craft with V-cinema delights (Katte ni shiyagare! [6 episodes], 1995/96; Door 3, 1996); specialized in horror with a meta bend (Cure, 1997; Charisma, 1999); diversified into other genres (Ningen gōkaku, 1998; Tōkyō Sonata, 2008) while continuing to explore all facets of the fantastique (Kairo, 2001; Kishibe no tabi, 2015), Science Fiction included (Sanpo suru shinryakusha, 2017); does occasionally TV (Shokuzai [Miniseries], 2012). A humble genius who works and creates incessantly. \" (Olaf Möller)\n\nSYNOPSIS (Venice Film Festival 2020):\n\n\" The year is 1940 in Kobe, the night before the outbreak of World War II. Local merchant, Yusaku Fukuhara, senses that things are headed in an unsettling direction. He leaves his wife Satoko behind and travels to Manchuria. There, he coincidentally witnesses a barbarous act and is determined to bring it to light. He leaps into action. Meanwhile, Satoko is called on by her childhood friend and military policeman, Taiji Tsumori. He tells her that a woman her husband brought back from Manchuria has died. Satoko is torn by jealousy and confronts Yusaku. But when she discovers Yusaku’s true intentions, she does the unthinkable to ensure his safety and their happiness. \"\n\nDIRECTOR'S STATEMENT (Venice Film Festival 2020):\n\n\" Set in a city in Japan’s rural countryside during the anxious and terrifying times of war, this film depicts a couple’s struggle to overcome distrust and stay faithful to their love for each other. This is my first film that is set in the olden times. With the historical timeline and events of the society already fixed, I pondered with great interest as I imagined how conflicted the people must have felt when they thought of what to look forward to in their future. \"\n\nAA: Kiyoshi Kurosawa's Wife of a Spy is an original political thriller set on the eve of the Pacific War.\n\nThere are affinities with Jean-Pierre Melville's Resistance trilogy. The presence of a brutal militaristic and imperialistic government is overwhelming. An atmosphere of surveillance prevails. Appearances must be kept. You cannot trust anyone. Personal ties are broken.\n\nKey conflicts are between love and duty and between fatherland and justice. Satoko initially accuses her husband Yusako of treason. \"I'm a cosmopolitan\", he replies. \"I will not tolerate injustice\". \"I will become the wife of a spy\", says Satoko. But Yusako is not a spy: \"You did not see what I saw. A heinous act in a foreign country\".\n\nBrutality is conveyed via indirection. Torture scenes take place in the darkness. Cries of agony betray what is going on. The victim's torn teeth document the method.\n\nThe \"film within the film\" theme is introduced via a screening of Sadao Yamanaka's entertainment movie Priest of Darkness (1936), a late silent film sonorized via a catchy, escapist song.\n\nThe second film screening is a clandestine 9,5 mm documentation from occupied Manchuria. It is a \"smoking gun\" of atrocities: Nazi-style experiments are conducted to spread Black Death in biological warfare. Little is shown even here, but what we see is incriminating. Like Kaji (Tatsuya Nakadai) in Masaki Kobayashi's The Human Condition, Yusako refuses to ignore a massive war crime.\n\nThere is a thrilling finale with surprises. The film ends in 1945. Again, horrors are conveyed indirectly. The apocalyptic sounds of the world war in the darkness, the trembling tableware, the flares, the screams. Satoko cries alone on the deserted beach. Yusaku has been confirmed dead, but a note of ambiguity remains.\n\nViewed on a laptop screen, the experience of the movie originally shot on 8K Super HiVision is not what it was meant to be. But even so I was able to appreciate the subtle soft detail. In this presentation there is no unreal sharpness but an appealing painterly quality.\n\nHannaleena Hauru: Fucking with Nobody (FI 2021) starring Hannaleena Hauru (Hanna) and Samuel Kujala (Ekku).\n\nFucking with Nobody / Fucking with Nobody.\n\nFI 2021 © 2020 Elokuvayhtiö Oy Aamu.

Panetus. Rakkaus”.\n\nSynopsis: “ After losing an interesting film job to her nemesis Kristian, Hanna teams up with her sister and counterculture friends to create a parody romance on Instagram between herself and the young actor Ekku. They are passionate to make visible how the society is hungry for romantic narratives. Hanna starts living a crowd-pleasing love story for the public, only to find herself tangled up in the unresolved past with her “you were never my boyfriend” friend Lasse, who also happens to be the real-life co-writer and cinematographer of Fucking with Nobody. As the fake romance starts affecting everyone involved, a hurricane of desires, fantasies, hurt and intimacy is set off. Everyone involved has to decide what and how they are ready to put in front of the camera. Fiction and auto-fiction crash and melt into each other, as writer-director Hannaleena Hauru plays the lead role of an ever-single film director “Hanna”. ”\n\nA word from the director: “ To make a portrait about relationships and intimacy in our times, I’ve found no other solution than to come as close to reality as possible – not only in the emotional content, but also in the cinematic solutions on how the story is told to the audience. The character Hanna says in the film “If I think of any memory I have about falling in love, they all relate to touch and smell rather than visual images”. I share this thought with the character, and that’s why I wanted to use haptic visuality to juxtapose more traditional imaginery seen in cinema. For me this sensory approach of Hanna is clashing in the film with both the social media images, as well as the with the fantasies presented through Lasse. For the ensemble approach and complex storylines, I have intentionally wanted to study how emotion can move through different characters. In the case of this film all characters are caleidoscopic reflections of Hanna and Lasse.Where in my previous films all fictional characters are some kind of reflections of my personal life, in Fucking with Nobody the study point was to build a fictional universe, that unfolds to be a presentation of the actual relationship of the two screenwriters of the film, Hanna and Lasse. Fucking with Nobody is a satire, the aestethics and acting style is toying with autofiction. Half of the scenes you see in the film are based on written dialogues, the other half is based on scenes written in detail in the script, but actors creating the dialogues. Only very few images in the film are documentary or full improvisation. All primary cast was involved increating the characters and their arcs in the film. ”\n\nAA: Hannaleena Hauru's Fucking with Nobody is the most original Finnish film of the year.\n\nIt is a reversal of Hauru's previous movie, The Thick Lashes of Lauri Mäntyvaara. Both are satires. In The Thick Lashes, Satu and Heidi declared war on commercial love, targeting wedding planners, geisha schools and quark cruises for sportsmen. The farce style, cartoonish effects, outlandish reactions and sight gags about consumer society evoked Frank Tashlin and Jerry Lewis, but also Vera Chytilova and Penelope Spheeris, as well as Kaisa Rastimo and Auli Mantila.\n\nThere is a certain similarity in the premise of Fucking with Nobody. Hanna and her team design an anarchistic art project on Instagram to parody a conventional romantic relationship. Hanna conducts a fake love affair with her gay friend Ekku. It is a performance meant to deconstruct obsolete power structures and romantic codes.\n\nInevitably, the Instagram experiment goes viral and becomes a huge phenomenon. Nobody understands it as satire. Instead, it becomes a source of inspiration for followers, and a cause of misunderstandings and embarrassments for Hanna and Ekku. The fake Instagram romance threatens Ekku's real relationship. The comedy evolves on the interface of reality and unreality.\n\nOn the one hand, the fake romance gets more daring, producing “sex positive“ YouTube videos, including guidelines for clitoris stimulation, expanding possibilities to bondage, piercing and the proper use of vibrators. To avoid the curse of “hetero binary romance bullshit“ a foray to the queer scene of Berlin is introduced, including a gay leather club complete with coprophilia (read: dropping shit).\n\nWhen the “carnevalization of bourgeois intimate relationships“ proceeds to parodies of commercials, advertisements and product placement, the parody indistinguishable from the object, Hanna's team loses faith in the project's critical potential. Hanna and Ekku are photographed for a cover story in the Image magazine. Their romance performance starts to seem like the real thing, whatever that is.\n\nFinally the protagonists are forced to ask the question: “Hey, on what level of this movie are we now?“\n\nIn the middle of the maze, the gay couple (Ekku and Ara) appear as a center of sanity and gravity. Ara seems to be the only one to experience real feelings in this narrative of make-believe.\n\nThere is a “real“ film project in production simultaneously: a film about Vampira (Maila Nurmi) that had been planned for Hanna to direct but has been trusted / thrusted to the male director Kristian instead. In the magnetic field of Hanna and Ekku's “love affair“ even that project goes awry, and Kristian finally appears as Vampira, as if inspired by Hanna to act in the leading role of his own film.\n\nIn the middle of the most bewildering goings-on runs a silver thread. In unexpected moments we hear confessions such as: “Men and women hardly even speak the same language. Women are better equipped to deal with emotions. They have been educated and forced to do that since early childhood. A woman is a face and feelings. A man is a torso and a penis“.\n\nHannaleena Hauru in her production notes quotes models including Monty Python, Mae West, Sacha Baron Cohen and Andy Kaufman. There is no imitation in Fucking with Nobody. We are witnessing the evolution of an original satirical talent.\n\nBEYOND THE JUMP BREAK: DATA FROM THE PRESS KIT:"
