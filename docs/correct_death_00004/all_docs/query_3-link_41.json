Stone, Chief Justice of the United States.\n\nLOCATION\n\nCabinet Room, The White House\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nBIBLE\n\nAccording to Truman, “There was much scurrying around to find this book on which to take the oath.” It was closed while he repeated the oath, and he kissed the book when he finished."
