        "text": "INDEPENDENCE, Mo. (KCTV) - The Harry S. Truman Presidential Library & Museum is an unrivaled archive of memorabilia and information on the 33rd president’s life—including a 1950 attempt to take it.\n\nIn the wake of a gunman’s attempt to assassinate former President Donald Trump on July 13, 2024, Kurt Graham, director of the Truman Library & Museum, took a step back in history with KCTV5.\n\nHarry S. Truman was a Missouri native raised in Independence, Mo. He served two terms as president of the United States from 1945 to 1953 and survived two attempts on his life, one of which more closely resembled the violent shooting that occurred during Trump’s Pennsylvania rally.\n\nHistory\n\nOn November 1, 1950, the Truman family was staying at Blair House as the White House underwent renovations just across the street.\n\nThe second-term president was about to take a nap when gunfire broke out on the street below.\n\nTwo Puerto Rican Nationalists named Oscar Collazo and Griselio Torresola had attempted to gain entry into Blair’s House to assassinate Truman. They were dissatisfied with American colonialism in Puerto Rico and knew they were likely to be killed during their attack on the then-president.\n\n“They just wanted to kill the president of the United States to bring attention to their cause,” Kurt Graham explained.\n\n27 shots were fired in just two minutes.\n\nSecret Service agent Private Leslie Coffelt was killed in the attack, but he was able to shoot and kill the assailant Torresola before he died. He remains the only member of the Secret Service to ever die while protecting a president.\n\nThe other assailant, Collazo, spent several decades in prison before he was released on parole in 1979 and died in Puerto Rico at the age of 80 in 1994.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe assassination attempt, while certainly not the first in U.S. history, had a large impact at the time.\n\n“The guidelines became different,” Graham said. “There was definitely an increase in security following this assassination attempt.”\n\nAccording to Graham, Secret Service protections weren’t provided to former presidents until years after Truman’s term ended. When presidents left the Oval Office, they became ordinary citizens again.\n\n“It wasn’t until the Kennedy assassination that Linden Johnson insisted that former presidents be granted Secret Service protection,” Graham said. “In doing that, of course, that was an invasion of their lives and privacy that they didn’t necessarily want but they also recognized it was just an increasingly dangerous and strange world in that way.”\n\nThroughout American history, there have been four presidential assassinations that were carried out and dozens of attempts. These incidents, Graham said, are reminders of why it is so important that the U.S. political process remains intact.\n\n“It’s always very sobering when you think about- for example- the events of [July 13]. We came within a centimeter of having our political process completely upended, not by the voice of the people, but by the voice of a single, lone gunman or would-be assassin,” he said. “I think it’s so shocking and frustrating for Americans to realize that that’s not how we make decisions in this country- that’s not how we do things.”\n\nFor many other countries across the world- and even in this hemisphere- Graham explained, significant attempts at political assassinations, like the one on former President Donald Trump, are more commonplace.\n\n“We have probably had a lot less of that over the scope of our history than other nations where political assassinations are kind of just the way they do business,” Graham said.\n\n“As sobering and as frustrating as a moment like this is, just like this moment was in 1950 and like the events of [July 13] were, we do have a lot to be grateful for here,” he continued. “We do have a relative level of safety and of what I would call a normal political process that not every country on Earth, or even in this hemisphere, enjoys.”\n\nALSO READ: KCI passengers react to Trump assassination attempt: ‘It’s a sad situation in this country’"
