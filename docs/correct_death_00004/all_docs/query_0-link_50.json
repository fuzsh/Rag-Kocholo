        "meta_description": "In 1919, Harry S. Truman, who would become the 33rd president of the United States, returned home from World War One, and married Bess, his longtime sweetheart. They moved in with her mother at 219 Delaware Street, in Independence, which would be their home for the rest of their lives. It’s a 14-room Victorian, built by Bess’ grandparents in 1885. After failed businesses, including a men’s clothing store he owned in Kansas City, Truman got into local politics, became a US senator, and moved to Washington. Initially Bess stayed in the house with her aged mother and their young daughter, joining him in Washington later. Though they returned often during his presidency, they moved here for good after his second term as president ended, in 1953. They were finally able to buy the house from the family then too, making this the first and last house Truman ever owned. Bess continued to live in the house after her husband died in 1972. She passed away in 1982, bequeathing the house to the federal government, which offers guided tours. It is part of the Harry S Truman National Historic Site, which also includes some of his relatives’ homes nearby. The historic site is based out of a visitor center in a converted fire station, a few blocks down the street. Visitors can buy tickets to tour the home, and watch an introductory film about Truman’s life. There is also a gift shop.",
