        "text": "The Harry S. Truman National Historic Site preserves the longtime home of Harry S. Truman, the 33rd president of the United States, as well as other properties associated with him in the Kansas City, Missouri, metropolitan area. President Truman took America from its traditional isolationism into the age of international involvement. Despite his power, he never forgot where he came from. Today, visitors can experience the surroundings Truman knew as a young man of modest ambition through his political career and final years as a former president.\n\nTickets are offered on a first-come, first-served basis and must be purchased at the Truman Visitor Center (223 N. Main St. in Independence) on the day of the tour. Tickets may sell out by early afternoon on weekends, around holidays, and daily during the summer season. Tour time availability is dependent on staffing levels."
