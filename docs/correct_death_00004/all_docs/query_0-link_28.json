        "text": "On April 12, 1945, Harry S. Truman poured himself a bourbon and branch water.\n\nIt was a little after 5:00pm and the Vice President (and Independence, Missouri native) was at the U.S. Capitol in the office of House Speaker Sam Rayburn, who he was joining for an early evening drink. Before Truman could take his first sip, someone in the office let Truman know that the White House had called for him and he should return the call immediately.\n\nTruman dialed the White House and according to accounts, all the color drained from his face. He put down the phone, turned to Rayburn and uttered, “Jesus Christ and General Jackson!”\n\nTruman dismissed himself immediately and then ran across the Capitol to his office to retrieve his effects. Within minutes, he was in a black Mercury sedan, en route to the White House.\n\nUpon his arrival, Eleanor Roosevelt informed Truman that her husband, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, had passed away. In an exchange that is now famous, Truman asked the soon-to-be former First Lady, “Is there anything I can do for you?” To which Mrs. Roosevelt answered, “Is there anything we can do for you? For you are the one in trouble now.”\n\nAnd so it came to pass, exactly seventy six years ago today (to the minute might I add!), at 7:09pm EST, that Harry S. Truman was sworn in as the 33rd President of the United States.\n\nThe only Missourian to ever hold this nation’s highest office, President Truman, and his wife Bess, never strayed far from their Kansas City area roots. The Trumans frequently visited Kansas City during Truman’s presidency. President Truman conducted so much business from the historic, downtown, Muehlebach Hotel that it became known as “White House West”. In fact, the Truman Doctrine was signed in the Presidential Suite!\n\nTruman was so fond of his home state that his famed “The Buck Stops Here” desk sign actually read, “I’m from Missouri” on the reverse side that faced him while he sat. As for the First Lady, Bess Truman reportedly counted down the days until the end of Truman’s second term when they could return to their home in Independence for good. In January, 1953, that is exactly what they did.\n\nIn commemoration of the 76th anniversary of Kansas City’s lone Commander-in-Chief assuming office, here are some of President Truman’s favorite Kansas City area hangouts, and a few local landmarks significant to his story.\n\nClinton’s Soda Fountain\n\n100 West Maple Avenue, Independence, Missouri\n\nAcross the street from the now-named Truman Courthouse, where Harry S. Truman once served Jackson County as Presiding Judge, sits the building where Truman held his first job. For three dollars a week, the 14 year old Truman opened Clinton’s Drugstore every morning at 6:30am. He did everything from mopping the floors to serving sodas and ice cream treats to manning the cash register. For the past three decades, Clinton’s Soda Fountain has kept that history alive. The mid-century charm of the checkerboard floors, retro furniture, and marble counter will transport you to a different time. Today, Clinton’s Soda Fountain continues to serve up old-fashioned sundaes, phosphates, and sweet treats in the same style that a young Truman once did from this very building.\n\nSo, What Do I Get? You really can’t go wrong with anything on the menu but it’s hard to pass up the opportunity to have Harry Truman’s favorite - a butterscotch sundae made with chocolate ice cream - at the place he once served ice cream.\n\nNational World War I Museum & (Liberty) Memorial\n\n2 Memorial Drive, Kansas City, Missouri\n\nAs the only national war monument not located in Washington, D.C., the Liberty Memorial is one of the top tourist attractions in the Kansas City metro. It is impossible to find yourself downtown and not have your eye drawn to the majestic, towering column. Ground was broken on the monument on November 1, 1921. Over 200,000 people gathered to watch Vice-President (later President) Calvin Coolidge, United States General of the Armies John Pershing, and a group of distinguished European military commanders from Great Britain, France, Belgium, and Italy dedicate the monument. On that day, a local haberdasher and World War I veteran was chosen to present flags to the commanders in attendance. That local veteran was none other than Harry S. Truman. (FUN FACT: Harry S. Truman and friends once ran a haberdashery, or clothing store, downtown where the Hotel Phillips lobby now sits.)\n\nHarry S. Truman was the only World I combat veteran to ever become President of the United States. During the Great War, Truman served on the front lines in France as a First Lieutenant in the Missouri National Guard. After his presidency, Truman was involved in the efforts to restore the Liberty Memorial. On the 40th anniversary of the groundbreaking in 1961, the former President rededicated the National World War I Monument in front of a crowd of 15,000 people. Designated a National Historic Landmark since 2006, there are several reasons to visit the National World War I Museum & Memorial but now, you have yet another one.\n\nIn 1950, LIFE published photos highlighting President Truman’s patronage. That’s when Dixon’s went from a chili parlor to “Famous”. When Truman retired to Independence, the Dixons sent him a container of their chili every year on his birthday. Today, Dixon’s Famous Chili claims to be the longest running family-owned business in Kansas City with the fifth generation of Dixons running the show. While they have relaxed Vergne’s ban on ketchup in the restaurant (although they will charge you for it!), Dixon’s continues to serve up that signature meaty chili. Like the President who put them on the map, Dixon’s Famous Chili Parlor is an Independence icon.\n\nSo, What Do I Get? It is tough to beat $9.99 All-You-Can-Eat tacos. However, Truman’s favorite meal at Dixon’s, and the one that made them famous, was “The Spread” - housemade tamales smothered in the signature chili. I personally prefer the “juicy” style of the chili. Garnish to your heart’s content (I go with onions, cheese, and the jalapeno relish) but stay away from the ketchup. It’s what Vergne would have wanted.\n\nThe Elms Hotel & Spa\n\n401 Regent Street, Excelsior Springs, Missouri\n\nA popular weekend getaway for several in Missouri and Kansas, the Elms Hotel & Spa in Excelsior Springs, Missouri has a rich history. Originally opened in 1888, the current Elms opened in 1912 and is actually the third iteration of the resort. Among the hotel’s more notable guests were Al Capone, Heavyweight Champion Jack Dempsey, and of course, President Harry S. Truman. The most significant stay in the hotel’s history came on November 2, 1948.\n\nPresident Truman discreetly checked into, what is now, Room 300 at The Elms to escape the stress of the downtown Kansas City Democratic headquarters on Election Day of 1948. His security detail occupied an entire wing. He enjoyed a massage, a mineral water bath, and a simple dinner of a ham and cheese sandwich in his room. He went to bed at 9:00pm believing, like much of America, that New York Governor Thomas Dewey would win the election. At 4:00am on November 3, a member of the Secret Service awoke him and told the President, “We’ve got ‘em beat.” A blunder by the Chicago Daily Tribune declaring “Dewey Defeats Truman” is still famous today. After returning to the downtown headquarters on November 3, Truman returned to The Elms in a much more public fashion than he had checked in the day prior. Truman addressed a crowd of journalists and well-wishers before making his way back to Washington. The iconic photo of Truman with the errant headline was snapped on a train platform in St. Louis on his return home to D.C.\n\nArthur Bryant’s Barbeque\n\n1727 Brooklyn Avenue, Kansas City, Missouri\n\nWhen Arthur Bryant added molasses to Henry Perry’s, the Father of Kansas City Barbeque, sauce in 1946, he forever defined the style that this city would become known for. Once mixed in giant, five gallon, glass jars, Bryant’s signature sauces, dubbed “The President’s Choice”, are still incredibly popular today. The name is not hyperbole; they actually were THE President’s choice. Self-described as “a meat and potatoes man”, Harry S. Truman was once a regular at Arthur Bryant’s Barbeque. During his presidency and after he retired, Truman frequented this 18th & Brooklyn eatery. Sorghum molasses was the Truman family’s favorite Missouri delicacy and perhaps that same ingredient is what drew Truman to Bryant’s sauce. Truman is not the only US President to have dined here. President Jimmy Carter, President Bill Clinton, and President Barack Obama have also paid Bryant’s a visit. While the restaurant is no longer owned by the Bryant family, the recipes are the same and the dining room has likely not changed much since Truman’s last visit. The debate over which Kansas City barbeque is best is always a fierce one, but only Arthur Bryant’s can claim to be “The President’s Choice”.\n\nSo, What Do I Get? Truman was a meat and potatoes man and meat and potatoes is exactly what you should get here. Arthur Bryant’s sliced pork is the city’s best! Often overlooked in barbeque, the white meat turkey slices are thick, moist, and ever so smoky. My recommendation is the Sliced Pork and Turkey Combo Sandwich (with a generous squirt of Bryant’s “Sweet Heat” sauce) with a side of their fantastic hand-cut fries. Once hailed as the “King of Ribs”, a slab of Bryant’s famous pork spare ribs or pork babyback ribs is another great way to go!\n\nHarry S. Truman Presidential Library & Museum\n\n500 West US Highway 24, Independence, Missouri\n\nAs early as 1939, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt donated many of his papers and manuscripts to the National Archives and pledged a portion of his Hyde Park, New York estate for a library to house these documents and artifacts related to his presidency. FDR maintained that the presidency, and Presidents themselves, were a key component of the American identity and as a result, their stories should be accessible to the public. This was a notable deviation, as prior Presidents had insisted their papers were their own private property when they left office. In 1950, President Harry S. Truman, following the lead of his predecessor, made a similar pledge and took an additional step - he pushed for congressional action to ensure the preservation of the legacies of all US Presidents. In 1955, the United States Congress passed the Presidential Libraries Act which established a system of private financed, but federally maintained, Presidential Libraries. The first such library that was constructed was the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library & Museum in Independence, Missouri.\n\nWhile the incredibly humble Truman did not like the idea of a museum dedicated to himself, he did feel an obligation to preserve the history of the office. He took it upon himself to raise funds for the library and archive his papers and other artifacts, a practice replicated by nearly every US President since. As a result, Truman’s presidency is considered to be one of the best documented and most well-preserved. After the Truman family refused to allow the construction of the library on the family farm, the current site was donated by the city of Independence. As has become the case with the majority of Presidents since Herbert Hoover, President Harry S. Truman and First Lady Bess Truman are interred at the Presidential Library, in the courtyard. In normal times, thousands flock to the Library and Museum (and the home of Harry and Bess Truman less than a mile away) to pay their respects to the man who hoped to be remembered as “The People’s President”.\n\nThe Savoy\n\n219 West 9th Street, Kansas City, Missouri\n\nWhen the Hotel Savoy and the Savoy Grill closed in 2014, there was cause for alarm. The Savoy Grill was the oldest remaining restaurant in Kansas City and the Hotel Savoy was the oldest continually operating hotel west of the Mississippi River. Thankfully, the closure was only temporary as the new owners were willing to make the multi-million dollar investment needed to preserve the historic landmark while introducing more modern elements. When The Savoy at 21c reopened its doors in 2018, many concerns were alleviated. Edward Holstag’s pioneer murals dating back to 1903 still adorn the walls. The iconic stained glass windows still shower sunlight into the dining room. Most importantly, to many, at The Savoy’s bar, “The President’s Booth” is still exactly where it belongs. Truman was a regular patron at The Savoy dating back to his days as a Jackson County Judge. Booth #4 was the regular table of Harry S. Truman at The Savoy in his later years. In the hallway of The Savoy, hangs the framed job application of a young Harry S. Truman when he applied for a job as a server there.\n\nAside from President Truman, Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, Warren G. Harding, Gerald Ford, and Ronald Reagan all ate at the historic restaurant. The latter two actually sat in Truman’s booth. New York Yankees Hall of Fame Catcher Yogi Berra frequented The Savoy when his team traveled to Kansas City. Political Boss Tom Pendergast, John D. Rockefeller (America’s first billionaire), and Lee Iacocca (the famed Chrysler CEO) dined at The Savoy. In the 1990s, when David McCullough was researching Truman for his biography that would go on to win the Pulitzer Prize, he reserved Truman’s booth every day for months. Over the decades, many historic figures and celebrities have dropped into The Savoy but only one of them has had a booth reserved for the better part of a century.\n\nSo, What Do I Get? Modernization of course means The Savoy is no longer serving the same menu that President Truman would have once enjoyed. It is hard to go wrong with anything on the elevated menu. In Truman’s day, The Savoy was primarily known for their steaks. With an excellent selection of cocktails, the Old Fashioned may be your best way to conjure Truman’s aura back to The Savoy. It should be noted that while the Old Fashioned was Truman’s preferred cocktail, he reportedly joked that he enjoyed it best when it was made without bitters, sugar, citrus, and cherry.\n\nThe Pendergast Club at The Majestic\n\n931 Broadway Boulevard, Kansas City, Missouri\n\nDISCLAIMER: It should be noted that this final entry is purely speculative. Unlike every other place listed, there is no documented proof of Harry S. Truman ever visiting The Pendergast Club but regardless, it is an important aspect of President Truman’s and Kansas City’s story.\n\nNo matter how many times you walk into The Majestic on Broadway, you never notice the door until someone points out to you. Located immediately to the right when you walk in, and innocently tucked behind the host stand, is a white door that seamlessly blends into the white wall around him. Easily disregarded as a closet, the door actually opens to a stairwell that will take you to the top floor of the building to the private, members only Pendergast Club.\n\nIt is impossible to talk about Harry S. Truman, from a Kansas City perspective, without making mention of Boss Tom Pendergast. While there are conflicting accounts of the relationship between the two men, there is no mistaking the Boss Tom’s political machine did help to fuel the political ascension of Harry S. Truman. Pendergast frequented The Fitzpatrick Saloon in the same space that The Majestic now occupies. Boss Tom officed out of the apartment that became the private club that now bears his name. As Pendergast ran the city’s Democratic machine, it is a near certainty that Truman would have visited Fitzpatrick’s Saloon and it seems likely he would have met with Pendergast in the penthouse office.\n\nWith a collection of hundreds of whiskeys, The Pendergast maintains that it is the only indoor bar in the city where you can enjoy a cigar. While The Pendergast Club is an open secret around KC, it is truly private. The only way to get in is to either be a member or have a member bring you as their guest. The latter is more likely as there is a wait list to join. If you ever have the opportunity to go, as I fortunately did in February 2018, do not miss the opportunity!\n\nSo, What Do I Get? Well first, you have to get in. It is a cigar club so the occasion definitely calls for one if that’s your thing. And if it’s not, be warned that the room will be thick with cigar smoke. Visitors can purchase cigars in the club but many of the members keep their own stock in The Pendergast’s walk-in humidor. My one piece of advice? Go to the bar and order what Harry would have likely ordered - Old Grand Dad or Wild Turkey bourbon neat, with a splash of water.\n\nJust as importantly, Kansas City was beloved by Harry and Bess Truman. The Trumans never forgot the place they came from. They could not wait to return to their home in Independence when Truman’s second term came to an end. The farm that Truman was raised on is in Grandview. Truman campaigned tirelessly to raise the funds to build his Presidential Library in Independence. In retirement, Truman was a mainstay in Independence and Kansas City where he often reminisced about his career with interested journalists and citizens. Harry & Bess are both interred in their beloved hometown. No matter how far they went, there hearts were always in Independence.\n\nThat’s what makes the Trumans so special. As loved as they were, and are, in Kansas City, that feeling was fully reciprocated. They were proud to represent this area and our city.\n\nPresident Harry S. Truman once remarked that, “There is nothing new in the world except the history that you don’t know.” While all of the aforementioned places have been around for decades, it is likely that, at least, a few of them are new to you. Exactly seventy six years after Harry S. Truman became the only Kansas Citian to assume the presidency, you have the opportunity to retrace his footsteps and discover the history and the parts of this city that you don’t know."
