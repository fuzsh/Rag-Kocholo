        "text": "Clinton’s Soda Fountain in Independence, Missouri, is beloved by regulars and tourists alike for its homestyle ice cream and its connection to former President Harry Truman. Plus: Looking back on when a group of Kansas counties tried to secede and form their own state called West Kansas.\n\nThe Neck was the largest Black neighborhood in Independence, but was demolished in the 1960s as part of the city’s urban renewal efforts. The city dedicated granite markers honoring the former neighborhood as part of its efforts to right the past.\n\nAfter a short bump in popularity after the end of World War II, incumbent President Harry Truman quickly became a lightning rod for criticism. A temporary exhibit in Independence focuses on the ensuing 1948 election, and displays more than 100 artifacts connected to the historic campaign.\n\nIf Jackson County voters feel conflicted about the April 2 stadium sales tax vote to help finance a new downtown ballpark for the Royals and Arrowhead Stadium improvements for the Chiefs, they can be confident in this: political fights over stadiums is a local tradition that goes back at least 93 years.\n\nClay Bauske has served as the curator of the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library & Museum for over 40 years and is set to retire at the end of the month. During his time in the role, museum curation has changed dramatically — but he argues that how we view President Truman has also shifted over these last four decades.\n\nIn the 1900s, the Neck neighborhood was the center of the Black community in Independence, Missouri. But by 1969, the neighborhood had been demolished — thanks to urban renewal policies put into place by President Harry S. Truman, who lived nearby. A special episode from the KCUR Studios podcast A People's History of Kansas City.\n\nA new book from NPR's Steve Drummond looks at how the Truman Committee, run by a relatively unknown U.S. Sen. Harry Truman, investigated wartime corruption, changed the country's efforts in World War II and ultimately helped launch Truman into the president's office.\n\nThe Neck neighborhood was in the center of historic Independence and housed the biggest Black community in the city. When the Harry S. Truman Library was built to honor the president, urban renewal policies he put in place destroyed the neighborhood."
