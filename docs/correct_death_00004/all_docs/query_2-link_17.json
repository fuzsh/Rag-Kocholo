        "text": "Harry S. Truman, 33rd president of the United States, proudly called Independence, MO, home.\n\nLong before his fascinating presidency—which included the atomic bombing of Japan, the outbreak of the Cold War, and the Korean War—Harry Truman was just a farm boy from Independence.\n\nAt six years old, Truman met his future wife at Sunday school here. At 14, he worked his first job on the Historic Independence Square. Later, he got his start in politics at the Jackson County Courthouse.\n\nThe qualities that guided Harry Truman—as a farmer, judge, senator, and, eventually, as president of the United States (1945–53)—were instilled in Independence.\n\nEven after his presidency, Truman returned home to Independence, MO, a place he fondly called “the center of the world.”\n\nToday, Harry Truman’s legacy is alive and well. Whether it’s a tour of the Truman Library or a milkshake on the Square, we invite you to explore all the ways to discover Harry Truman in Independence.\n\n“I tried never to forget who I was, where I came from, and where I would go back to.”"
