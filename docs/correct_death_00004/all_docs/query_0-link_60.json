        "text": "The Truman neighborhood is centrally located in Independence, Missouri, northwest of the Independence Square. It generally lies to the east of River Boulevard, west of Pleasant Street, south of U.S. 24 Highway, and north of Truman Road.\n\nHistory & Architecture\n\nFamous for its association with the country’s thirty-third President, the Truman Neighborhood is known for its tree-lined streets, diverse architecture, and walkability. The neighborhood is incorporated into the National Historic Landmark District, an honorary Federal distinction that distinguishes it as having the highest level of national significance. The district, established in 1971 just before President Truman’s death, is unique in that it is one of the only areas in the country that retains it individual homeownership directly adjacent to a National Park Service site.\n\nThe Truman Neighborhood is made up of a variety of architectural styles dating from the late 19th through the mid-twentieth century that includes Colonial Revival, Queen Anne, Folk Victorian, Kansas City Shirtwaists, and bungalows. Some newer infill includes ranches and split levels.\n\nToday, the area is known for its central location in Independence (within walking distance of the Independence Square), high level of architectural integrity, and historical significance.\n\nTruman Neighborhood Amenities"
