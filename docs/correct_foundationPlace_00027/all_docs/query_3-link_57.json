        "text": "Thesis and projects submitted to this collection are the senior projects of undergraduate students in the University Honors Program at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. A central part for the Honors experience is the senior project, either independent research or participation in creative or collaborative academic activities. The format of the project depends on the program requirements, the traditions of the academic discipline, and the nature of the project selected.\n\nMentored research and creative activities in all disciplines allows students to develop skills and experiences that enhance their professional or graduate school credentials and career opportunities. Students have described their Honors senior projects as the \"most intellectually exciting and rewarding experience\" of their college careers.\n\nSupport for undergraduate research is strong at Nebraska. The University funds research scholarships that pair faculty mentors and students in their second and third years (UCARE-Undergraduate Creative Activities and Research Experience). Academic departments also sponsor internships and cooperative education programs in the business and scientific communities in the state and in the nation.\n\nThe theses and projects here are open to the general public.
