The building is carefully scaled to fit into its north Westwood Village neighborhood..\n\nWe designed this new student housing development to complement the surrounding context—both on- and off-campus—while maximizing the density of its on-campus location. The ten-story building steps up the hillside in scale with neighboring buildings.\n\nSTUDIOS developed a feasibility study for the renovation of an existing 50-year-old, 211,505 sq ft lab and classroom building, and provided strategic seismic and building systems upgrades. We also conducted multiple studies for potential new user groups.\n\nWe developed a plan to densify UCLA's current 92-acre northwest campus with additional housing, recreation, and fitness components.\n\nThis 500-unit graduate student apartment and commons complex creates an urban heart for the precinct, and helps to knit together the different student housing and other facilities sprinkled across Westwood. A major pedestrian path—or paseo—runs..\n\nThe CARE/Crawley Building unites a modern new wing with a partially renovated existing concrete structure to create a distinct architectural identity for the one-building health sciences research and education campus and to allow for a more interdisciplinary pedagogical approach.\n\nSTUDIOS led the design of this dynamic new interdisciplinary building. The Arts & Technology Building (ATEC) brings together the knowledge and expertise of computer science, engineering, creative arts, and the humanities to develop new dimensions and new opportunities in..\n\nLe repositionnement de cet immeuble des années 2000 s’est attaché à offrir une meilleure visibilité, une identité plus affirmée et à revaloriser les espaces extérieurs et les espaces communs de cet ensemble de bureaux.\n\nWith the goal of engaging their growing membership of architects, planners, developers, and municipal entities in an ongoing dialogue, ULI approached STUDIOS to design a dynamic workplace that eliminates functional silos, increases visible leadership, and enhances the membership experience.\n\nVera Institute of Justice set out to define a new future for their nonprofit organization focused on building and improving justice systems.
