        "text": "Taxes\n\nIntuit, H&R Block end separate E-FILE fees: Two companies with big roles in preparing tax returns are giving their customers a small break. Intuit Inc., which makes TurboTax software, and H&R Block Inc. said separately they both eliminated fees for filing federal returns electronically using their desktop software. The Internal Revenue Service does not require companies to offer free e-filing. The fees were small — H&R Block charged $19.95, Intuit $17.95 — but such fees have been the subject of some concern on Capitol Hill. Legislation that would mandate the IRS provide individual taxpayers with a way to file free electronic returns was introduced in the Senate in March 2007 and in the House this year. Both bills were referred to committees, where they have not been acted upon. Taxpayers who earn $54,000 or less per year can prepare and file returns online for free through the agency’s Web site, at www.irs.gov.\n\nSportswear\n\nNike profit falls on year-ago gain: Nike Inc.’s profit fell 10 percent in its fiscal first quarter as a special gain in the prior year did not recur, the company said Wednesday. Sales rose, however, with help from international operations. The Beaverton, Ore.-based athletic shoe and apparel company said its net income decreased to $510.5 million, or $1.03 per share, from $569.7 million, or $1.12 per share, a year earlier. But the 2007 quarter included a special item that increased earnings per share by 20 cents. If adjusted for the benefit, net income would have grown 10 percent. Revenue jumped 17 percent to $5.43 billion. Changes in currency exchange rates increased revenue by 7 percentage points during the quarter.\n\nHealth care\n\ninsurance costs grow more gradually: Health insurance premiums rose a modest 5 percent this year for coverage that’s getting skimpier, researchers say. The 5 percent increase was comparable to last year’s uptick. Overall, premiums for family coverage increased to $12,680 and premiums for single coverage increased to $4,704, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust. Employers pick up, on average, about three-quarters of that cost. Over the past decade, insurance premiums have grown much more quickly than wages and inflation. That wasn’t the case this year. But to help slow the costs of health insurance, companies are increasingly offering coverage that requires their workers to pay more of their medical expenses before the insurance will kick in.\n\nInsurance\n\nInsurance tab for Hurricane rises: Close to 50,000 claims have been filed already with a windstorm insurance fund backed by the state of Texas for damage from Hurricane Ike, and thousands more are pouring in each day, Texas’ insurance commissioner said Wednesday. Commissioner Mike Geeslin told legislators the total number of Texas insurance claims from Ike could reach 300,000. That includes claims filed with private-sector companies and with the state-chartered Texas Windstorm Insurance Association. The windstorm insurance fund, the only windstorm insurer for more than a dozen coastal counties, could see its total losses reach $4 billion, while Ike losses in Texas overall could be at least twice that amount, Geeslin said.\n\nBanking\n\nS&P cuts WaMu ratings further: Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services downgraded Washington Mutual Inc.’s creditworthiness further into junk territory Wednesday, noting the increased likelihood that any sale of the company would only be done in piecemeal fashion. The fate of the ailing Seattle-based thrift has hung in the balance for weeks, as investors question the potential for a sale or government intervention in the face of WaMu’s plunging stock price — which has fallen 77 percent so far this year. S&P noted that in the stressed financial services sector, there are few potential buyers not struggling with their own capital constraints and mortgage debt issues, narrowing the possibility for an outright takeover of the entire thrift. But a carve-up of Washington Mutual would increase the risk of default for creditors of the holding company, because the bank’s stable deposit base would be gone.\n\n— Associated Press"
