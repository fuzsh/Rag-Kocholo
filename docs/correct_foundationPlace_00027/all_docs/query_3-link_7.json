In addition, to prevent ongoing harm to consumers rushing to file their taxes, the Commission also filed a federal district court complaint asking a court to order Intuit to halt its deceptive advertising immediately.\n\nThe Commission alleges that the company’s ubiquitous advertisements touting their supposedly “free” products—some of which have consisted almost entirely of the word “free” spoken repeatedly—mislead consumers into believing that they can file their taxes for free with TurboTax. In fact, most tax filers can’t use the company’s “free” service because it is not available to millions of taxpayers, such as those who get a 1099 form for work in the gig economy, or those who earn farm income. In 2020, for example, approximately two-thirds of tax filers could not use TurboTax’s free product.\n\nCase Timeline\n\nFile\n\nFinal Order (179.4 KB)\n\nFile\n\nOpinion of the Commission (Public) (2.25 MB)\n\nPRESS RELEASE: FTC Issues Opinion Finding that TurboTax Maker Intuit Inc.
