        "text": "APRIL 2022\n\nCompetition\n\nFTC and Justice Department Launch Listening Forums on Firsthand Effects of Mergers and Acquisitions\n\nFTC and DOJ Antitrust Division Host Enforcers Summit\n\nFederal Appeals Court Ruling Affirms Preliminary Injunction To Halt Merger of New Jersey Hospital Networks\n\nFTC Proposed Divestiture in Energy Merger Would Prevent Elimination of a Significant Competitor for Waxy Crude Oil in Utah\n\nThe FTC will require the divestiture of energy producer EP Energy Corp.’s entire business and assets in Utah. The divestiture will resolve the agency’s allegations that EnCap Energy Capital Fund XI, L.P.’s proposed $1.445 billion acquisition of EP Energy Corp. would eliminate head-to-head competition between two of only four significant producers and otherwise harm competition for the sale of Uinta Basin waxy crude oil to Salt Lake City refiners. According to the complaint, EP and EnCap, through its subsidiary XCL Resources Holdings, LLC, compete to develop, produce, and sell Uinta Basin yellow and black waxy crude oil to Salt Lake City-area refiners. The proposed acquisition would reduce the number of significant producers from four to three. Under the proposed settlement, EnCap is required to divest EP’s business and assets in Utah to Crescent Energy Company. Crescent is an experienced operator in crude oil and natural gas production, and it will be a new competitor in the Uinta Basin.\n\nConsumer Protection and Privacy\n\nFTC Chair Khan and EC Commissioner for Justice Reynders Affirm Interest in Reinvigorating Informal Dialogue on Consumer Protection\n\nCourt Rules That Fake Government Websites Deceived Consumers; Makes $102 Million in Refunds Available\n\nThe FTC’s trial win against On Point Global has made $102 million in refunds available to consumers who were deceived into handing over money to fake government websites in exchange for bogus advice on how to apply for government benefits. The scammers ran hundreds of deceptive websites that promised a quick and easy government service, such as renewing a driver’s license, or eligibility determinations for public benefits like vouchers to subsidize housing obtained by low-income families from private landlords, or food stamps. The sites had names like DMV.com, floridadriverslicense.org, and many others that were designed to mimic legitimate government websites.\n\nFTC Sues Intuit for Its Deceptive TurboTax “Free” Filing Campaign\n\nFTC Halts Deceptive Credit Repair Operation That Filed Fake Identity Theft Complaints\n\nThe FTC obtained an order halting a credit repair scheme that allegedly bilked consumers out of millions of dollars by falsely claiming they will remove negative information from credit reports, while also filing fake identity theft reports to explain negative items on customers’ credit reports, and illegally demanding that consumers pay up front fees. At the request of the FTC and the Department of Justice, a federal judge issued an injunction against Texas-based Turbo Solutions Inc., which does business as Alex Miller Credit Repair, and its owner Alex V. Miller. The complaint seeks both civil penalties and consumer redress.\n\nFTC Takes Action Against CafePress for Data Breach Cover Up\n\nFTC Charges HomeAdvisor, Inc. with Cheating Businesses, Including Small Businesses, Seeking Leads for Home Improvement Projects\n\nFTC Seeks Large Civil Penalties for Bogus Bamboo Marketing from Kohl’s and Walmart\n\nIn Other News"
