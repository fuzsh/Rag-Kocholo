You can check the \"Unclaimed donation contributions carried forward from a previous tax return\". Click on \"Continue\" will land on the \"Charitable donations carried forward\" and you can enter info there.\n\nSee Below:\n\nPlease Check out this Canada Revenue Article: How do I calculate my Charitable donations\n\nThank you for choosing TurboTax.\n\nBut that is only for previous years (2016-2020) not for this past year (2021)\n\nWhy is it that this year they decided to lock this feature when it has always been included with the free version? (or at least it has been for the past 5 years that I have been doing my own taxes)\n\nCan the Turbotax team please make this available to us? It's as if turbotax is trying to make money off the people that are being charitable and giving... which just isn't great PR.\n\nThis year, TurboTax is taking extra steps to ensure that Canadians have access to the features that will help them get the best tax outcome by broadening its product line up and directing users to the version of TurboTax that aligns with their tax situation. Weâ€™ve expanded our lineup and tailored each version of TurboTax to address the complexity of various levels of filers. This year, when you file with TurboTax, you will be directed to the version that best suits your needs based on complexity, to ensure you are getting the best possible tax outcome for the best value.\n\nThank you\n\nIf I am correct, what you're saying is that anyone who wishes to claim charitable donations must pay to upgrade their version of TurboTax?\n\nSo for example: If I had the most basic tax return (let's say I have a single simple T4) and the only other thing I did was donate to a charity, I would have to upgrade my version of TurboTax?\n\nAs mentioned by a previous comment @Davemonunn , the charitable donation section was offered for free, but now it is not. You do understand how this looks, don't you? That TurboTax is profiting off of people who generously give to charities.\n\nPeople who give out of their own pocket now to have pay to claim those donations.\n\n@TurboTaxGinette Greedy much?\n\nI too encountered the same issue. I have been using the free online version for years and the minute I try to claim a charitable donation I am faced with having to pay to upgrade after getting 90% through a basic return.\n\nThis is corporate greed at it's finest and looks very bad for TurboTax. I strongly suggest you change this feature to be included in the free version as a 'charitable' gesture/feature."
