        "text": "AWS Community Day 2018\n\nIntuit's Journey to 100% on AWS\n\nWhen Intuit decided to move to the cloud, it took an “all-in” approach and learned some critical lessons along the way that many organizations can benefit from. Hear from Andy Palmer, former vice president of technology at Intuit, as he shares Intuit's migration journey to AWS and his top 10 learnings from the experience.\n\nWatch the video »\n\nIt was slow going in those early days—using machine learning used to be a long, hard process. Fast-forward to today, and AI capabilities are now integrated across our products and services. Harnessing the power of scalability of cloud-based ML is helping us accelerate our path to becoming an AI-driven expert platform, and we've only just begun.\"\n\nWe accelerated use of AI and increased the number of models deployed across our platform by over 50% this year. This increased use of AI drove a variety of customer benefits, including saving customers 25,000 hours with self-help and cutting expert review time in half, improving customer confidence.”\n\n… we completed the migration of our data centers to the cloud, while expanding our core technology capabilities. This enabled us to decrease downtime by 30%, triple the speed of delivery on our modern development platform, and increase mobile application deployments by 60%. We can now launch new features in a fraction of the time it once took us and deliver customer benefit with even greater speed.\""
