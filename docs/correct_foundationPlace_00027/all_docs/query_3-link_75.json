Magazine Reveals Annual List of America’s\n\nFastest-Growing Private Companies—the Inc. 5000\n\nINDIANAPOLIS, August 17, 2021 – Inc. magazine today revealed that SBC Wealth Management is ranked on its annual Inc. 5000 list, the most prestigious ranking of the nation’s fastest-growing private companies. The list represents a unique look at the most successful companies within the American economy’s most dynamic segment—its independent small businesses. Intuit, Zappos, Under Armour, Microsoft, Patagonia, and many other well-known names gained their first national exposure as honorees on the Inc. 5000.\n\n“Being named to the Inc. 5000 for the first time feels like an incredible achievement for the organization given the challenges of the pandemic, a presidential election, and market volatility,” said Scott Holley, CEO of SBC Wealth Management. “To experience growth and to be recognized for our efforts is very rewarding. We are always proud of the work we do to help our clients navigate market changes to stay on the path to achieve their lifestyle goals, but to be able to do so successfully over the last year is a true testament to our team, their hard work, and the emphasis we place on delivering a valuable client experience.”\n\nNot only have the companies on the 2021 Inc. 5000 been very competitive within their markets, but this year’s list also proved especially resilient and flexible given 2020’s unprecedented challenges. Among the 5,000, the average median three-year growth rate soared to 543 percent, and median revenue reached $11.1 million. Together, those companies added more than 610,000 jobs over the past three years.\n\nComplete results of the Inc. 5000, including company profiles and an interactive database that can be sorted by industry, region, and other criteria, can be found at www.inc.com/inc5000. The top 500 companies are featured in the September issue of Inc., which will be available on newsstands on August 20.\n\n“The 2021 Inc. 5000 list feels like one of the most important rosters of companies ever compiled,” says Scott Omelianuk, editor-in-chief of Inc. “Building one of the fastest-growing companies in America in any year is a remarkable achievement. Building one in the crisis we’ve lived through is just plain amazing. This kind of accomplishment comes with hard work, smart pivots, great leadership, and the help of a whole lot of people.”\n\nSBC Wealth Management\n\nSBC Wealth Management is a premier wealth management firm dedicated to helping clients create, enhance, and preserve their lifestyles. With over 40 years of experience and multigenerational expertise, our clients can feel confident in our experience and breadth of services to help them achieve their lifestyle goals.\n\nCONTACT: Erin Haines, 515-229-6793, erin@modernmoxie.co\n\nMore about Inc. and the Inc. 5000\n\nMethodology\n\nCompanies on the 2021 Inc. 5000 are ranked according to percentage revenue growth from 2017 to 2020.

They represent the top tier of the Inc. 5000, which can be found at http://www.inc.com/inc5000.\n\nAbout Inc.
