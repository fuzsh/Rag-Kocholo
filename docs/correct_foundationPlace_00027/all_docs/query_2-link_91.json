Creating loyal customers is at the heart of every business.As marketing experts Don Peppers and Martha Rogers say.

Businesses succeed by getting, keeping, and growing customers. Customers are the only reason you build factories, hire employees, schedule meetings, or engage in any business activity. “Without customers, you don’t have a business”. Building CustomerValue, Satisfaction, and Loyalty\n\n11. • Identify your customers. • Differentiate customers in terms of (1) their needs and (2) their value to your company. • Interact with individual customers to improve your knowledge about their individual needs and to build stronger relationships. • Customize products, services, and messages to each customer. Building CustomerValue, Satisfaction, and Loyalty\n\n12. • InAugust 2008, Microsoft announced that it would stop releasing a new version of Money each year and had no version planned for 2009. • The company also announced that it would no longer ship boxed versions of Microsoft Money to retail stores and would instead sell the product only as online downloads. • On June 10, 2009, Microsoft announced that it would stop developing Money, would stop selling it by June 30 that year, and would continue supporting it until January 31, 2011. • The company cited the changing needs of the marketplace as the reason for Money's demise, stating that \"demand for a comprehensive personal finance toolset has declined.\"  Discontinuation of Microsoft Money\n\n14.  Scenario after winning over Microsoft • We think that Intuit asTwo scenarios after Microsoft leaving the market. • There is a positive scenario, where Intuit can become the leader in its field, with most market share.This means to continue as they have done until now, being leaders, innovators and using its strategy of investment in research with customers.\n\n15.  Scenario after winning over Microsoft • There is also a negative scenario, if they reduce or remove the research funding and research efforts.They could end up in the same way as Microsoft Money ended. Because competitor's are temporary and competition is permanent. • We think it would benefit them if they continue to follow the same strategy ."
