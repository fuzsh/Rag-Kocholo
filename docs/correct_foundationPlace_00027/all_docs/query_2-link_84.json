The Georgia Restaurant Association represents all 19,000+ restaurants in Georgia, regardless of ownership, franchise brand, etc. During the establishment of the Intuit QuickBooks Restaurant Relief Initiative in partnership with the GRA, the Georgia Restaurant Association Foundation (GRAF) leadership considered the need of independent restaurateurs and lack of support the resources that nationwide corporate-owned or franchised receive.\n\nQUALIFICATIONS\n\nRestaurant must be located in Georgia\n\nLess than $250,000 in annual net revenue in 2020\n\nThe restaurant remains open or providing modified service (takeout/delivery)\n\nAPPLICATION EVALUATION\n\nThe Restaurant Relief Initiative grant awards evaluated by using a simple rubric:\n\nAll application documentation and acknowledgment statement have been submitted\n\nThe restaurant is currently open\n\nThe restaurant has less than $250,000 in annual net revenue in 2020\n\nOwnership has been confirmed as independent (For the absence of doubt, an independent restaurant is defined as a restaurant owned by a corporation, limited liability partnership, general partnerships, or sole proprietorship, and is not a franchise of a national chain. Independent restaurant chains DO QUALIFY for this grant.)\n\nADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS\n\nGrant money must go towards payroll related expenses â€“ such as: new hire bonuses, performance bonuses, advertising/marketing for new hires, restaurant marketing, rent, equipment, inventory costs, insurance, etc."
