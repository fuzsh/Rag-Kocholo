        "text": "The program follows a successful pilot serving students in the Portland Public Schools through a partnership with Self Enhancement, Inc., where Intuit and the Suh Family Foundation provided workshops and training to staff to deliver personal finance education to students.\n\nIt's the season of giving and one local organization is doing its part to help our youth reach their full potential. But they need our support! Rashad Taylor, In-School Coordinator for Self Enhancement, Inc., along with Post-High School Student Dyamond Baker, joined us to share more.\n\nNew to protesting for racial justice? SEI has been doing it for almost 40 years. “When we show up for a kid, we’re usually standing up for them in a way that no one else has ever done for them before,” says Libra Forde, the nonprofit’s chief operation officer. “And they look like me. That has been our protest: We sit at a political table asking for funding for these children and for our programming. That’s a protest.”\n\n“For us, it’s a great opportunity to drill down and see where the need may be and possibly head off some of the negative impacts of COVID,” Anthony Deloney, SEI’s director of strategic initiatives, said in a post from OHSU about the project.\n\nThose who remain employed in the pandemic crisis have been considered lucky. And while many companies are being judged by how well they are supporting their employees during a global pandemic, combined with an invigorated quest for racial justice, the Portland nonprofit Self Enhancement, Inc. stands out for its consistent commitment to building community in and around the workplace.\n\nSelf Enhancement, Inc. helps under-served youth reach their full potential and, in turn, that strengthens the very core of our city. Libra Forde, SEI's Chief Operating Officer, joined us to tell us how we can all contribute to SEI's success.\n\nFounder, CEO and President of SEI Tony Hopson Sr. joins us to share the mission of the wonderful organization. Self Enhancement, Inc. helps under-served youth reach their full potential and, in turn, that strengthens the very core of our city.\n\n\"We realize that COVID has been disproportionately impacting the black people in our community and we’ve seen that all across the country, so we wanted to push to make sure that black people in our local community had the opportunity to get tested,” said Tony Hopson, president and CEO of SEI.\n\n“How do you take a moment in time and turn it into a full movement?” [Tony] Hopson said. “That is the hope this time. That this is not just another moment where another black man or black person was murdered in broad daylight,” he said. “That it becomes a movement of which all Americans get behind for change.”\n\n“Self Enhancement, Inc. President and CEO Mr. Tony Hopson, Sr. on KATU News Afternoon Live during Black History Month, speaking on where SEI came from, where it is today, and what it means to our community.”\n\n“As part of the Economic Empowerment Cohort formed and led by Umpqua, Bienestar and African American Alliance for Homeownership, Metropolitan Family Service, Self Enhancement, Inc., and Gateway to College National Network will advance initiatives that expand access to job and financial support services, affordable housing, post-secondary education and career readiness opportunities.”\n\nAnthony Deloney from Self Enhancement Inc and D'Marieon Gates, a 6th grader who received a bike last year join Kurt Wolfgang with Free Bikes 4 Kidz who shares about what a donation of a bike does for a child, the types of bikes you can donate and how we can help by making a financial donation, donating a bike or volunteering to help repair donated bikes.\n\n\"“SEI and its partners have long, proven histories of helping vulnerable children and families throughout Portland by delivering quality services that make a hugely positive impact,” Wyden said. “This grant recognizes the success of their model and how its innovative approach has earned support for its expansion to help even more Portlanders.”"
