        "text": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Intuit Inc. (Nasdaq: INTU), the global financial technology platform that makes Intuit TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks, and Mailchimp, is awarding three small businesses $20,000 each as part of the Intuit QuickBooks and Mailchimp Small Business Hero Day. The third annual celebration is part of Intuit’s Small Business Success Month, and is one of many activities during May that spotlights the importance of small businesses and provides them with support to drive their continued success.\n\nSmall businesses make an incredible impact on the people and communities they serve which is why Intuit is dedicated to honoring their contributions. New data from the Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Success Month Survey found that small businesses play a key role in creating opportunities for women, people of color and other marginalized groups, as 36% of those surveyed believe that small businesses help diversify the community by bringing new people to the area. This year’s three Small Business Heroes are making a particularly unique impact in this area, with their dedication to driving inclusivity and belonging for groups that might otherwise be left behind. From helping the formerly incarcerated reintegrate into the community and start on new productive paths, to creating a safe space for diversity through the art of dance, and giving adults of all abilities the chance to learn and thrive.\n\nIntuit is thrilled to recognize these three inspiring small business owners for the pivotal role that they play in each of the communities they serve.\n\nThe Elevation Project (Philadelphia, PA) is a community-based organization in West Philadelphia, created by LaTrista Webb after she saw the impact incarceration had on her community, including a close friend and family member, learning first-hand how difficult re-entry can be as they transitioned back into the community. Today, LaTrista and her team provide a safe and supportive environment and a number of key services for at-risk and formerly incarcerated individuals, empowering them to find fresh starts, achieve economic equity through entrepreneurship, and ultimately drive systemic change within reentry services.\n\n“This recognition comes at a pivotal time for us at the Elevation Project, as we grow and expand our services to reach even more people in the community,” said LaTrista Webb. “Everyone deserves the opportunity to have a fresh start and a foundation to help them rebuild and grow. This money will help us to continue on our mission to reduce recidivism, and provide support to these individuals by elevating their lives and leading them on pathways to success.”\n\nElite Formation Studio of Dance (Chantilly, VA) is a dynamic cultural arts company centered around fostering confidence, self-esteem and a supportive environment where students of all ages can express themselves through the art of dance. Founder Chequena Morris-Hall started the business after noticing a lack of diversity in the dance studios across the Northern Virginia area and was inspired to create a space where her daughter and other dancers of all backgrounds could have a safe and inclusive space to learn and thrive. Today, the studio has more than 180 students, and Chequena remains dedicated to doing all she can to support the families she serves, sometimes even using her own personal funds to pay for classes and competitions for students who may not be able to cover the costs.\n\n“I started this business to provide a space for students of all ages and abilities in our community to have a safe place where they can be confident in their ability to dance and just simply be who they are without any insecurities,” said Chequena Morris-Hall. “Dance has the power to transform individuals, but can often be a costly expense. This money will allow me to provide even more resources, support and opportunities for our dancers as we continue on our mission to teach our students self-confidence through what they learn and experience at our studio.”\n\nDig It! Coffee Co. (Las Vegas, NV) was started by Taylor Gardner Chaney, who was inspired by her younger sister, who was born with Down syndrome, to create a positive, inclusive work environment that provides competitive wages and mentorship for adults with disabilities. Growing from a pop-up coffee cart to a brick-and-mortar establishment serving the arts district of Las Vegas, the coffee shop is making a positive impact on the people they employ and the community they serve, delivering on their mission of fostering a thriving community built on inclusivity, equity and kindness.\n\n“Dig It! Coffee Co. was created to be a safe space for adults of all abilities to work, learn valuable skills, and earn a competitive wage in a world where they are often overlooked and underestimated,” said Taylor Gardner Chaney. “With this money, I can continue to expand the Dig It concept beyond the Las Vegas community, and achieve my dream of helping to build a more inclusive society.”\n\nData from Intuit QuickBooks also revealed that more than 7 in 10 small business owners say they feel supported by their community at large, but despite this support, many small businesses still often face financial struggles. Nearly 4 in 10 (36%) say up to $20,000 would be game-changing for their business operations, helping them to cover immediate expenses or alleviate financial worries for their business, making the award each of the Small Business Heroes will receive even more impactful in helping with their continued success.\n\nFor more information on the three Small Business Heroes and Intuit’s Small Business Success Month, please visit here.\n\nAbout Intuit\n\nIntuit is the global financial technology platform that powers prosperity for the people and communities we serve.
