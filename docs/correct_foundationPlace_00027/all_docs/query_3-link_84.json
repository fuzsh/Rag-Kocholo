        "text": "Thousands of companies match donations made by employees to a range of nonprofit causes through corporate matching gift programs. However, billions of dollars in available corporate matching revenue go unclaimed each year⁠—largely due to a lack of awareness surrounding the programs and the matching gift guidelines and request process that are required for donors to participate.\n\nA general understanding of corporate giving is a great foundation for maximizing nonprofit revenue. However, in order to succeed in acquiring matching gifts, you’ll need to understand the nitty-gritty elements of program stipulations.\n\nFor example, companies are able to decide their specific guidelines for matching gift participation based typically on employee eligibility, nonprofit eligibility, and submission deadlines. From there, the amount that a company will match (per employee per year) is based on a combination of matching gift ratios, minimums, and maximum match amounts.\n\nIn this post, we’ll break down the key components of basic matching gift guidelines:\n\nMatch Ratios\n\nMinimum Match Amounts\n\nMaximum Match Amounts\n\nEmployee Eligibility\n\nNonprofit Eligibility\n\nForms and Deadlines\n\nNot to mention, we’ll also provide an overview of the most effective method for determining program eligibility through companies’ matching gift guidelines. Equipped with the right tools, you can easily identify matching gift opportunities and communicate eligibility criteria and next steps to guide donors through the request process.\n\n1. Match Ratios\n\nCompanies determine how much to match employee donations based on a preset ratio. In most cases, companies choose to match donations at a dollar-for-dollar rate (otherwise known as a 1:1 ratio).\n\nWhen a program offers a 1:1 ratio, an employee will donate to an eligible nonprofit, submit their matching gift request to their employer, and then their company will match that gift with the same amount.\n\nFor instance, if an employee donates $100 to a nonprofit that’s eligible for the company’s match program, the employer will donate an additional $100. In the end, the nonprofit receives a $200 donation, which is double the original contribution.\n\nAlthough you can expect to see a lot of 1:1 matching programs, ratios can range from .5:1 (or a $50 corporate donation for a $100 employee gift) all the way up to 4:1 (which would be a $400 company gift in response to a $100 employee contribution). Either way, the nonprofit receiving match funding results in significantly increased amounts flowing to the organization.\n\nLet’s take a look at matching gift ratios in action. Consider these companies, for example:\n\nPuget Sound Energy matches employee donations at a .5:1 rate.\n\nApple matches employee donations at a 1:1 rate.\n\nCoca-Cola matches employee donations at a 2:1 rate.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind when it comes to matching gift rates is an individual’s employment type. While ratios are typically standardized across all employee types, some companies will vary amounts depending on an employee’s position or type of employment.\n\nFor example, part-time employees, retirees, and even team member spouses may have a lower match rate than corporate executives who work for the same company. Take the following companies as an example:\n\nSoros Fund Management matches donations from partners at a 1:1 rate and employees at a 2:1 rate.\n\nJohnson & Johnson matches donations from current employees at a 2:1 ratio and retirees at a 1:1 ratio.\n\nTakeaway: Matching gift ratios vary from company to company and may change based on employee position. These stipulations are entirely up to the company, and nonprofits and employees should stay up-to-date on their match opportunities.\n\n2. Minimum Match Amounts\n\nUnfortunately, not every company will match every donation made by an employee⁠—even if they do have a matching gift program in place. In order to qualify for a company match, restrictions are often put in place regarding the minimum donation amount they will match.\n\nIf a donor’s contribution falls below that set amount, the company will not match the gift. Keep in mind that this isn’t intended to restrict employees’ philanthropic efforts. Rather, it’s to ensure that employees are requesting matches for causes they truly care about.\n\nNonetheless, corporate matching gift best practices suggest keeping the minimum low to encourage participation and make the programming accessible to employees of all budget sizes. As a result, some companies will match donations that are as little as $1. However, the most common minimum requirement is $25, with 93% of companies having a minimum match requirement of less than or equal to $50, and the mean minimum amount falling at $34.\n\nLet’s take a look at these companies’ matching gift minimums for a few common examples:\n\nApple matches employee donations of $1 or more.\n\nHarris Corporation matches employee donations as long as they’re greater than $10.\n\nHome Depot matches donations starting at $25.\n\nLyondellBasell Industries matches employee donations of $100 or more.\n\nAnother thing to note is that, depending on the company, an individual who makes multiple smaller donations within a year may be able to consolidate them into a single donation match request⁠—despite falling beneath their employer’s minimum for any particular gift.\n\nTakeaway: Companies apply minimum matches to ensure that the giving budget goes to nonprofits that employees actually care about. Most often, set minimums are $25, but they range from $1 to $100+.\n\n3. Maximum Match Amounts\n\nIn addition to match minimums, companies also put caps on match amounts to ensure there’s enough in the giving budget for each employee to participate. If an employee donates more than the maximum match amount, still, only the defined maximum will be matched by the company.\n\nMaximum matches have quite the range, too. Often, you’ll come across upper limits of between $1,000 and $5,000, with $3,728 as the average maximum threshold. However, there are plenty of companies with matches that are way above that scope.\n\nTake a look at these companies with matching gift caps across the spectrum:\n\nAvis Budget Group matches donations up to $100 annually per employee.\n\nGeneral Electric matches donations up to $5,000 annually per employee.\n\nMerck & Company matches donations up to $30,000 annually per employee.\n\nSoros Fund Management matches donations up to $100,000 annually per employee.\n\nRegardless, each philanthropic program is generous and has the power to make a major difference in the nonprofit world.\n\nTakeaway: Each company has a different maximum amount it will match. Typically, these are around $1,000 to $15,000, but it’s not uncommon to see caps that are higher or lower than this.\n\n4. Employee Eligibility\n\nOften, companies create eligibility requirements for employees that may depend on their position or another factor.\n\nFor example, some companies match donations made by any current employee, regardless of full- versus part-time status. Others will match retired individuals’ donations even after they depart from the business. Others still will even match gifts made by an employee’s spouse.\n\nTo get a real-world idea of this concept, take a look at these companies:\n\nAcuity Brands matches donations from directors and executives only.\n\nBritish Petroleum (BP) matches donations made from current employees, but not retirees.\n\nSherwin-Williams matches donations made from all current employees and retirees.\n\nExxonMobil matches donations made from employees, spouses, surviving spouses, and retirees.\n\nKeep in mind that, as previously mentioned, different positions can sometimes mean different match ratios and maximum match amounts, too. For instance, some companies may allow current employees to donate up to a higher amount than retired employees. Another common case is programs that offer executive employees higher maximums than other employees.\n\nSome companies also choose to further reward employees who go the extra mile. For example, take a look at these programs’ matching gift guidelines:\n\nAmerican Express offers a 1:1 match ratio for employee donations. However, if the donor serves on a nonprofit board or volunteers more than 50 hours in a year, the first $1,000 of their donations will be matched at a 2:1 ratio.\n\nRealNetworks offers a standard matching gift program, but if an employee works at the company for 5 years, they receive an additional $500 grant for a nonprofit of their choosing.\n\nTakeaway: In most cases, there aren’t too many requirements employees have to meet to be eligible for matching gifts. However, sometimes, companies adjust program criteria based on employees’ positions.\n\n5. Nonprofit Eligibility\n\nJust like there are standards employees have to meet to request matching gift funds, there are requirements for the nonprofits looking to receive match funding, as well.\n\nWhile companies typically match donations to most registered 501(c)(3) nonprofits, some companies place restrictions on the types of organizations that are eligible. If a company deems a nonprofit ineligible, employee donations made to that organization will not be matched.\n\nLike all other components of corporate giving programs, the eligibility requirements for nonprofits differ from company to company. These restrictions are often put in place because companies want to support organizations that align with their own views and values while avoiding controversial causes.\n\nFor example, churches and other religious organizations are often excluded from matching gift programs. However, many companies will match to religiously affiliated organizations that serve a secular purpose (such as an associated K-12 school or food pantry), while others will match to houses of worship all the same.\n\nOther companies may choose a particular type of organization to which it will exclusively match donations. For example, some businesses match only to educational organizations, while others offer higher maximums or match ratios for schools and higher ed institutions.\n\nTake a look at these companies’ nonprofit eligibility criteria:\n\nAir Products and Chemicals matches donations made to colleges and universities at a 1:1 ratio up to $5,000, arts and cultural organizations at a 2:1 ratio up to $2,000, and environmental and conservation organizations at a 1:1 ratio up to $1,000.\n\nExxonMobil has a maximum match amount of $22,500 for donations made to educational institutions, while it will only match up to $2,000 for donations made to cultural organizations.\n\nVerizon will match up to $5,000 per employee per year to schools or $1,000 per employee per year to other 501(c)(3) organizations.\n\nTakeaway: Companies sometimes place restrictions on which organizations can receive matching gifts. It’s up to donors and nonprofits to be on the lookout for these eligibility requirements.\n\n6. Forms and Submission Deadlines\n\nOnce all requirements of a company’s matching gift program have been met, this is when submission forms and deadlines come into play.\n\nAs a quick refresher, here’s how the typical process works:\n\nAt this point, we’re coming up on the third step in the above procedure. The donor has previously determined that they’re eligible to participate, and now they’re ready to submit their matching gift request.\n\nThough some companies may still utilize paper request forms, most companies are turning to online portals to manage and process employee requests. The bottom line is that there needs to be a way for employees to submit their match requests and the way in which they expect the request to occur should be outlined within the company’s matching gift guidelines.\n\nRegardless of form type, once the donor has navigated to their company’s matching gift forms, they’ll be prompted to provide basic information for the submission. This typically involves details about themself, the specific gift they made (including donation amount, currency, date of transaction, etc.), and the nonprofit that received the donation (such as the organization name, mailing address, and tax ID number).\n\nIn addition to the forms themselves, companies also have to define a specific deadline by which the forms must be submitted. For instance, an employee generally can’t donate to a nonprofit and submit a match request two years later.\n\nInstead, in their guidelines, companies might select a specific annually occurring deadline, accept requests for a specific time period (such as six months or one year) after the individual donation was made, fall in line with the end of the calendar year in which the donation was made, or offer a brief extension beyond the calendar year.\n\nTo view a few common types, here are request deadlines for several major companies:\n\nCarMax accepts matching gift requests within 180 days from the date of the donation.\n\nMicrosoft accepts matching gift requests for donations up to 12 months later.\n\nBoeing accepts matching gift requests from employees until January 31 of the following year after the donation.\n\nTakeaway: Businesses must create accessible forms and define deadlines before putting a match program in place. Nonprofits and their donors need to be aware of these submission instructions and deadlines, otherwise, they may miss out on matching gifts.\n\nMatching Gift Database: Identifying Companies’ Guidelines\n\nNonprofits need to stay up-to-date on companies’ matching gift guidelines, such as donation minimums, maximums, ratios, eligibility, and so on⁠—and that’s a lot of information to manage. Unfortunately, gathering companies’ guidelines on your own can be a mundane and time-consuming process.\n\nWith a matching gift database (like Double the Donation), the research is streamlined and simplified for nonprofits and donors alike.\n\nThis type of innovative technology ensures that your organization has access to thousands of companies’ matching gift program guidelines at your fingertips. As a result, you can easily determine donors’ match eligibility potential and communicate the opportunities to qualifying donors.\n\nSpecifically, a matching gift database enables you and your donors to:\n\nSearch for 20,000+ companies’ and subsidiaries’ matching gift programs in seconds\n\nView and share available information (e.g. forms and requirements) for easy access\n\nDetermine matching gift eligibility and next steps\n\nThink your nonprofit can benefit from this type of tool?\n\nWith 360MatchPro by Double the Donation, organizations like yours can even automate the process. From collecting employment data directly within the donation process to quickly determining eligibility and following up via email, no match opportunities will be overlooked.\n\nMatching gift programs have several guidelines that need to be met in order to qualify for participation, all defined by the companies that offer them. As you’ve learned, the most commonly defined elements are the match ratio, minimum and maximum match amounts, employee and nonprofit eligibility, and submission deadlines.\n\nTake all of these factors into account, and equip your team with the tools you need for success, and you’ll be able to effectively increase the funding source for your organization and its mission.

Understand the opportunity with this research.\n\nIn today’s corporate world, employees and consumers are becoming increasingly focused on supporting socially responsible businesses. Consequently, more and more companies are developing philanthropic programming. And nonprofits looking to raise much-needed funds for their causes are turning to corporate giving as a way to build mutually beneficial business relationships!\n\nAs a nonprofit fundraiser yourself, perhaps you’ve recently developed a strategy in order to leverage matching gift opportunities (one of the most prominent forms of corporate philanthropy) for your mission. Maybe you’ve even invested in a matching gift solution to automate the process, better engage with your donors, and collect more individual and corporate funding for your cause.\n\nNow begs the question: what other types of corporate philanthropy are on the table⁠, and how can you begin leveraging these initiatives for your organization?\n\nFor many nonprofits, corporate partnerships are the answer you’re looking for⁠—and 360MatchPro by Double the Donation makes the process as easy as can be.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know about how to identify corporate partnerships for nonprofits (and how your team can best pursue the opportunities) by exploring the following topics:\n\nThe Basics of Corporate Partnerships for Nonprofits\n\nThe Relationship Between Matching Gifts and Corporate Partnerships\n\nHow to Identify Corporate Partnerships Using 360MatchPro | 4 Methods\n\nLike matching gifts, corporate partnerships offer a win-win situation for the nonprofits and businesses that partake. However, many organizations have no idea where to begin when it comes to scouring for partnership opportunities, near and far.\n\nHere, we’ll examine the best tips, tricks, and tools available for doing so (and what you can do with the tools you may already have). Let’s dive in!\n\nThe Basics of Corporate Partnerships for Nonprofits\n\nCorporate partnerships are a particular form of support nonprofits receive from corporations, often for a specific purpose such as an event or other project.\n\nBenefits include not only the increased funding provided by corporate partners but also significantly elevated exposure and awareness brought to your organization through strategic co-marketing efforts.\n\nCorporate partnerships can come in many forms as well, including:\n\nFinancial ⁠— This is your most typical type of corporate partnership agreement and takes place when a company provides financial support to a nonprofit cause.\n\nIn-kind ⁠— In-kind sponsorships occur when a company donates non-monetary goods and services to an organization. This may include free or reduced-cost event space rentals, catering services, or even business gift certificates and products for prizes.\n\nMedia ⁠— Finally, media sponsorships are a unique type of corporate partnership where a company partners with a nonprofit organization in order to take on the cost of promoting the event⁠—such as with radio advertisements, TV commercials, or printed materials.\n\nThen, regardless of the type of agreement offered, the nonprofit typically agrees to recognize the company through event or project marketing content (i.e., signage, merchandise, online advertising, and more).\n\nThe Relationship Between Matching Gifts and Corporate Partnerships\n\nMatching gifts and corporate partnerships go hand in hand as two particularly powerful forms of corporate giving. Here’s what you need to know:\n\nMatching Gifts\n\nMatching gifts are one of the most popular examples of corporate philanthropy among companies and their employees and nonprofits and their donors. Essentially what occurs with this type of giving program is that businesses agree to provide funding to qualifying nonprofits in order to match charitable donations their employees make to the causes. Thus, individual donors function as arguably the most essential players in the partnership. Companies that offer matching gift programs will typically provide donation matches to a wide range of nonprofit causes that their employees support.\n\nCorporate Partnerships\n\nOn the other hand, corporate partnerships take place when companies provide funding to nonprofit causes based on particular agreements made between the company and the nonprofit. Though donors and employees can certainly vie for these types of initiatives to occur, any one individual does not typically play a particularly hands-on role in corporate partnerships being developed. Businesses that participate offer corporate partnerships typically contribute larger amounts of funding to a smaller number of organizations as compared to employee matching gift programs.\n\nHowever, the two concepts do see significant overlap as well. Specifically, both matching gifts and corporate partnerships function as strategic relationships between nonprofit organizations and for-profit businesses, and each philanthropic opportunities offer unique and substantial benefits to both parties involved.\n\nHow to Identify Corporate Partnerships Using 360MatchPro | 4 Methods\n\nWith more than 32.5 million businesses operating in the United States alone, that’s a lot of potential sponsorships for nonprofit organizations. But how can they know where to begin their efforts⁠—and target their outreach toward companies that are the most likely to respond positively to partnership inquiries?\n\nHere are a few things fundraising professionals can do as they learn how to identify corporate partnerships and other opportunities using Double the Donation’s 360MatchPro functionality:\n\n1. Locate top matching gift companies.\n\nCompanies that offer matching gift programs are likely to be some of the best prospective corporate sponsors. After all, they already show an interest in philanthropy and supporting nonprofit causes, which can provide you with an existing “in” to the conversation.\n\nIf your organization has access to a 360MatchPro account, locating these companies is made even easier. Double the Donation’s automated matching gift platform offers a detailed dashboard that provides invaluable information for nonprofits about their donors. The page includes daily tracking of donations flowing into the system, the amount of identified matching gift dollars, real-time donor engagement statistics, and a list of the “top 10 companies” being looked up in their search tool.\n\nSpecifically, the top companies tool (which can also expand to show all companies contributing donation matches) provides an opportunity for nonprofits to deepen these relationships. With this functionality, users can quickly locate additional context on some of the most valuable companies to approach for corporate partnership opportunities and more.\n\nWhen a user views this data, they can easily navigate to the company’s website and retrieve contact information to get in touch. From there, they can utilize the company’s status as a top matching gift company as a rapport-building tool to get their foot in the door.\n\nFor example, a nonprofit may communicate something like this to a business with which they’re interested in partnership:\n\n“Our organization has received 620 donations and $28,000 match identified dollars from your company in the past year. We see that you are dedicated to charitable giving, and it seems that we have a lot in common already! Are you interested in partnering with our team as a corporate sponsor for our upcoming fundraising event?”\n\nThis can also set the stage for identifying additional corporate partnerships such as in-kind donations (e.g., a food bank or homeless shelter working with a business to set up a donation box at the company’s office or store), corporate volunteer opportunities (as team-building activities), and many more.\n\n2. Utilize custom redirects for ineligible donors.\n\nUnfortunately, not all companies offer matching gift programs⁠—but that doesn’t mean you should remove them from your list of potential corporate partnerships.\n\nIn fact, existing donors who work for companies that do not match employee donations can be some of your greatest allies in the process! And Double the Donation makes it as easy as possible to empower these individuals with the tools they need to pitch charitable giving opportunities to their employers with custom redirects and powerful suggested next steps.\n\nLet’s take a look at this idea in action! Here’s an example of a custom redirect from the Denver Rescue Mission:\n\nThis organization sends follow-up emails after its donors have been identified as likely ineligible for a matching gift. The message includes a link to a dedicated web page that provides information on other ways the donors can make an impact without existing matching gift programs in place. And that’s something your team can do, too!\n\nWe recommend including a number of ways that the receiving donors can get further involved with your nonprofit⁠—even after determining that their gift is not able to be matched by their employer. For example, consider encouraging supporters to take the following next steps:\n\nMake a recommendation for matching gifts.\n\nFor companies that don’t have existing matching gift programs, encourage donors to reach out and float the idea upwards. An employee may get in touch with their employer’s HR department to discuss the possibility of launching a matching gift program.\n\nTo further simplify the process for your donors, you might even provide a customizable template (such as the one included in this How to Advocate for a Matching Gift Program guide) they can use to pitch matching gifts and highlight the business value available to the company.\n\nAnd who knows? They might end up developing a matching gift initiative after all!\n\nLook into additional workplace giving opportunities.\n\nLet’s say a donor’s employer doesn’t offer a matching gift program. That’s not to say they don’t have any workplace giving initiatives in place! Encourage donors who work for non-matching gift companies to look into additional corporate giving opportunities they may be eligible to participate in.\n\nThousands of companies offer volunteer grants, while others may provide annual grant stipends, paid volunteer time off, etc. The possibilities are endless, and all can have a positive impact on your organization.\n\nMultiply their impact in other ways.\n\nPerhaps the donor’s employer is not interested in launching any workplace giving opportunities just yet. That doesn’t mean the donor themselves is not able to amplify their impact on your cause! At this point, be sure to provide recommendations for other ways an individual can get further involved.\n\nFor example, if an individual has contributed a one-time donation, see if they’re interested in getting involved in a recurring monthly giving program! Alternatively, you can highlight other ways they can bring value to your cause, such as by volunteering with your organization or even taking on a peer-to-peer fundraising role.\n\nYou already know that your donors are invested in your organization and its cause. Having a strategy in place for getting match-eligible donors involved in their employers’ matching gift programs is great. But you don’t want to neglect those who have been identified as match-ineligible, either.\n\nGuiding said donors toward additional opportunities for support is a must. And, if you have 360MatchPro, you don’t have to worry about following up with individual supporters, thanks to your customizable and automated email streams that lead the way.\n\n3. Reach out to companies without matching gift programs.\n\nSure, your donors can be some of your strongest advocates for corporate partnership opportunities. But you can also reach out to potential sponsors yourself to propose business partnerships and build relationships.\n\nOne of the best ways to do so starts with the companies your donors work for that have been determined not to offer matching gift programs. After all, they’re currently missing out on a substantial opportunity for increased business success. Partnering with your organization can empower them to leverage philanthropy to make the most of it.\n\nConsider reaching out to some of the top companies identified through 360MatchPro’s dashboard. From there, you can start with a simple template like this:\n\n“Hi! We see that more than 35 dedicated donors to our nonprofit are employed by your company. Unfortunately, however, it looks like you don’t offer a matching gift program. Because we already have so much in common with us, we were hoping you might be interested in developing a mutually beneficial corporate partnership.”\n\nFor the best results, be sure to highlight whatever value proposition you can provide your corporate sponsors in terms of your upcoming event or project. Not only will these companies be inclined to build a relationship based on the overlap between your two teams, but they’ll also be able to examine the tangible benefits made available by the partnership.\n\n4. Pursue custom matching gift opportunities.\n\nSimilar to how you could seek a corporate sponsorship by an employer prevalent in your donor network, you might also decide to pursue a “one-off” or custom matching gift program with the company.\n\nNot familiar with that idea? It’s essentially a matching gift initiative that involves a specific agreement between your organization and a dedicated corporate partner. While the partner may not match donations to other nonprofits their employees support, they do commit to doubling donations made by team members to your cause. Since it involves a significantly lower investment of the company’s time, effort, and resources, it may be a more effective ask than if you were to recommend the business launch a new, fully-fledged matching gift program.\n\nDepending on how the conversation goes, you can even share with them our detailed guide on How to Start a Matching Gift Program to help them move through the process. Should they decide to take on the task, 360MatchPro also offers unique functionality for nonprofits managing their side of such programs within the matching gift platform. Not to mention, you can offer groundbreaking auto-submission functionality through Double the Donation, which streamlines the request process for the company’s employees and minimizes the administrative lift for the company itself!\n\n*As a note, this feature is designed specifically for fundraisers looking to manage custom matching gift initiatives—360MatchPro does not work directly with corporations. If you’re a company interested in creating a matching gift program, contact us, and we’ll share information about our corporate vendor partners.\n\nIncreasing revenue through corporate philanthropy is an excellent objective for nonprofits of all shapes, sizes, and missions. And learning how to identify corporate partnerships is one of the best steps you can take to get there!\n\nFor the greatest results, be sure your team is equipped with the tools you need for ongoing, substantial success. For matching gifts and corporate partnership opportunities, Double the Donation’s 360MatchPro offers the best-in-class technology to drive matching gifts to completion, uncover potential sponsorships, and more.\n\nInterested in learning more about corporate fundraising?

After all, these gifts offer exclusive financial benefits both to the donor contributing the gift and the nonprofit receiving it. But what about nonprofit stock donations and matching gifts? Are gifts of securities typically eligible to be matched by donors’ employers?\n\nThese are good questions⁠—and they’re cropping up more around nonprofits and donors alike. As a nonprofit fundraising professional, you surely understand the value of corporate matching gifts and are seeking to get as many company matches flowing into your mission as possible.\n\nThat’s why we’ve put together this guide that will cover everything your team should know about stock donations and matching gifts by exploring the following topics:\n\nDonating Stock to Nonprofits: FAQ\n\nNonprofits That Accept Stock Donations\n\nMatching Stock Donations: The Basics\n\nCompanies That Match Stock Donations\n\nReady to dive into the world of securities and gift matches? Let’s begin with a brief overview of nonprofit stock donations.\n\nDonating Stock to Nonprofits: FAQ\n\nJust getting started with nonprofit stock donations? These are some frequently asked questions⁠—and answers⁠—on the topic.\n\nWhat are stock donations?\n\nStock donations are a unique method of giving in which individual donors can support nonprofit causes by transferring ownership of stock shares from themselves to the organization in question.\n\nStock donations are also referred to as gifts of securities, which typically encompasses transfers of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds.\n\nIn order to secure the full financial benefits of a stock donation, the donor should have held the stock for at least one year from the time of the gift. The organization then has the option to sell the stock immediately upon receiving the donation or allow its shares to continue to appreciate in value. Nonprofits typically outline their generally accepted types of donations and liquidation procedures in their gift acceptance policies.\n\nOther Key Terms to Know:\n\nMutual fund donations\n\nWhile stock donations typically involve the transfer of shares within a single company, mutual funds can include a portfolio of thousands of stocks, bonds, and other securities compiled as a single entity.\n\nBut when it comes to donating assets to charity, mutual fund donations function similarly to stock donations⁠—and similar rules apply regarding mutual fund and stock donations and matching gifts. Most companies that match gifts of stock will also match mutual fund donations and vice versa.\n\nOne thing to note, however, is that the mutual fund transfer process can be a bit more complicated than that of single stocks and may require a more hands-on process by the organization receiving the securities.\n\nMarketable securities\n\nAnother term you might see in the realm of nonprofit stock giving is marketable securities. These are a specific category or type of investment, and most publicly traded stocks, and those most likely to be donated to a nonprofit, will fall under this umbrella.\n\nAlso known as marketable equity or marketable investments, these are essentially financial assets that are easily liquidated or readily convertible into cash. These are typically considered short-term investments and can be sold with minimal impact on their market value.\n\nWhy do individuals donate stocks to nonprofit causes?\n\nNonprofit stock donations are becoming a favorite giving method among donors for multiple reasons. For one, gifts of securities such as stocks enable donors to contribute more to an organization and its mission than they might be able to on their own.\n\nIf an individual purchases $100 in stock from a company that has since appreciated to double in value, they will be able to funnel $200 toward a cause that they care about⁠—despite having only paid $100 for the initial stock shares! (And if the donor’s employer will match their stock donation, the end value can reach higher than $400⁠—but more on that later.)\n\nAdditionally, when donating stocks that have been appreciating for more than a year, donors actually contribute 20% more to the nonprofit than if they had first sold their stocks and made a cash donation with the proceeds. That’s because when an individual sells their stock, they’re subject to pay significant capital gains taxes, which are not applicable should they transfer the stock to the receiving organization.\n\nAre all stocks able to be donated to nonprofit organizations?\n\nMost stocks will be eligible for donation purposes to most nonprofit causes. However, some organizations may place certain stipulations on the types of companies whose stocks they will and will not accept.\n\nFor example, the American Heart Association refuses donations of stock or other interests in companies relating to tobacco, nicotine delivery, or cannabis. In the case that an individual attempts a stock donation that is not accepted by the organization to which they gave, the securities will ultimately be returned to the donor.\n\nNonprofits That Accept Stock Donations\n\nMany nonprofit organizations accept charitable gifts of stocks and mutual funds, and the trend is continuing to grow. In the next few years, we can expect more and more charitable causes to collect and incorporate gifts of securities into their overall fundraising strategies.\n\nDonors interested in contributing stock to a particular cause are encouraged to explore their website, as the information regarding stock donation acceptance is often included within the organization’s “ways to give” page.\n\nAs of now, we’ve pulled a list of ten well-known causes and their current guidelines for donating stock.\n\n1. American Heart Association\n\nThe American Heart Association (or AHA) gladly accepts gifts of stocks (and mutual funds) from generous donors and provides easily accessible guidelines and instructions for multiple methods of doing so.\n\nHere’s what their website had to say:\n\n“You can use stock to support the organization through:\n\nElectronic transfer – Your broker can transfer shares using the AHA’s Depository Trust Company (DTC) number and account number to ensure delivery.\n\nMail – You can mail paper certificates to the AHA.\n\nElectronic Delivery of mutual fund shares is the most secure and practical delivery process available. If you would like to donate a gift of mutual funds to the American Heart Association, please contact us to confirm AHA’s brokers can accept the funds.”\n\nRead up on the full program guidelines here.\n\n2. Leukemia and Lymphoma Society\n\nThe Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, also known as LLS, encourages charitable donations of stock and mutual fund assets as well. They even provide a brief overview of the tax benefits offered to stock donors who are considering the option!\n\nHere’s what their website had to say:\n\n“If you own stock or a mutual fund that has appreciated in price since you purchased it, consider using that asset for your charitable giving. You get an income tax deduction for the full market value of donated securities that you have owned more than one year and you will avoid the capital gains tax on the appreciated value.”\n\nRead up on the full program guidelines here.\n\n3. American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals\n\nThe ASPCA is another organization that accepts stock transfer donations as a way for donors to support their cause. Within their plethora of suggested giving methods, gifts of security are highlighted along with detailed instructions on how to conduct the transfer process.\n\nHere’s what their website had to say:\n\n“For credit to ASPCA – American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals – Prior to transfer, please call the organization with the name of stock and number of shares to be transferred.”\n\nRead up on the full program guidelines here.\n\n4. Syracuse University\n\nSyracuse University provides donors and prospects with information regarding multiple kinds of stock donations⁠—including marketable securities, closely-held securities, electronic stock transfers via DTC, and mutual fund transfers. Their site also prominently displays contact information for the university’s advancement department which will help facilitate the transfer!\n\nHere’s what their website had to say:\n\n“When planning to make a gift of securities to Syracuse University, please notify Advancement Services. Gifts of publicly traded securities that have appreciated in value allow you to claim a charitable deduction for the full market value of the securities on the date the gift is made. You pay no capital gains tax on the appreciation.\n\nGifts of stock in closely held corporations may result in substantial tax benefits in the form of charitable deductions and avoidance of capital gains taxes. Closely held securities can be especially attractive in funding charitable remainder trusts or charitable remainder lead trusts. Because special regulations apply to gifts of this kind, we encourage you to consult your tax adviser and the University’s development staff when considering such a gift.”\n\nRead up on the full program guidelines here.\n\n5. Piedmont Healthcare\n\nPiedmont Healthcare utilizes its website to encourage stock donations by interested supporters. One way they do so is by briefly highlighting the benefits to both their institution as well as to the donor contributing the appreciated securities (of both stocks and mutual funds).\n\nHere’s what their website had to say:\n\n“Gifts of appreciated securities, such as stocks or mutual funds, that have been held for over a year are a wonderful way to support Piedmont while potentially realizing important benefits for yourself.\n\nInstruct your broker to transfer shares to Piedmont Healthcare Foundation by contacting Truist Bank via phone or email.\n\nContact your mutual fund company about the process of transferring mutual fund shares. A special form and signature guarantee will likely be required by them to initiate a charitable transfer.”\n\nRead up on the full program guidelines here.\n\n6. Florida State University\n\nFlorida State University provides stock donors (and prospective donors) with detailed instructions that outline the securities transfer process. The FSU Foundation incorporates tips and tricks for donors aiming to contribute stock to the university, whether electronically or with physical certificates.\n\nHere’s what their website had to say:\n\n“When donors’ securities are held in a brokerage account, the donor instructs their broker to transfer the securities to the university’s account.\n\nDonors should also request that their brokers send confirmation of transfer to the FSU Foundation, Inc. The confirmation should indicate the donor’s name, the security being transferred, the Foundation account which should be used, and the date of transfer. Donors should then follow up with a letter to the FSU Foundation with instructions regarding their gift designation so that the gift can be properly credited.”\n\nRead up on the full program guidelines here.\n\n7. National Kidney Foundation\n\nThe National Kidney Foundation includes stock donations as one of their suggested ways to support the institution⁠—along with other giving ideas such as cryptocurrency, vehicle donations, fundraising events, and more.\n\nThis organization provides interested stock donors with a downloadable PDF made available through their “Get Involved” web page.\n\nHere’s what their website had to say:\n\n“Please complete and email the included form to Cornerstone Advisors Asset Management prior to transfer.”\n\nRead up on the full program guidelines here.\n\n8.

This section quickly highlights the significant tax benefits to the organization and the subsequently increased impact a supporter’s gift can make.\n\nHere’s what their website had to say:\n\n“Did you know that your gift could go further by donating stock directly? Direct stock gifts let us use 100% of your donation, rather than losing up to 37% of it to capital gains tax. Thus, you can make a bigger impact at zero additional cost to you. If you would like to make a stock donation, please contact the Lazarex team.”\n\nRead up on the full program guidelines here.\n\n9. St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital\n\nOne of the largest youth-focused research hospitals in the nation, St. Jude receives support from a widespread supporter base. Under its “Ways to Give” page, the organization provides a detailed guide on the benefits of stock donations with a step-by-step walkthrough of the process.\n\nHere’s what their website had to say:\n\n“Donating stock directly to a charitable organization, like St. Jude, can increase the amount of money received by the charity while reducing the tax burden for the donor. When you donate appreciated securities (investments that have increased in value from the time they were purchased), some individuals and households may be able to take advantage of IRS tax provisions to claim a charitable tax deduction for the full, fair market value of the securities.\n\nStep 1: Choose what type of stock and how many shares you want to donate.\n\nStep 2: Contact your financial institution to request the transfer.\n\nStep 3: Contact us to inform us of your gift.\n\nStep 4: Look for a tax receipt and acknowledgment letter for St. Jude.”\n\nRead up on the full program guidelines here.\n\n10. American Cancer Society\n\nFor individuals looking to support the American Cancer Society, gifts of security are marketed as a key form of philanthropy under the “Ways to Give” umbrella on the organization’s website. Upon navigating to the “Stock Gifts” page, donors are met with information on various ways to donate stock in support of ACS⁠—including online, physical delivery, and electronic transfer authorization.\n\nHere’s what their website had to say:\n\n“A gift of appreciated securities held for more than one year may provide significant benefits to you as a contributor, such as:\n\nEntitling you to a charitable income tax deduction for the fair market value of the gifted securities as of the date of the gift.\n\nEliminating capital gains tax that would ordinarily become due if you had sold the appreciated securities on the open market and donated the proceeds from the sale to charity\n\nClaiming your charitable deduction against up to 30% of your adjusted gross income. Any unused deductions can be carried forward over the next five years.\n\nProviding a way to help you achieve your long-term financial objective of reducing your income and estate taxes.”\n\nRead up on the full program guidelines here.\n\nMatching Stock Donations: The Basics\n\nClearly, stock donations are a great stream of additional fundraising revenue for nonprofits, and they’re becoming an increasingly sought after resource. At the same time, organizations are looking to get their charitable donations matched by donors’ employing companies.\n\nSo, do the two ideas coincide at all? Here’s what your fundraising team needs to know about the relationship between nonprofit stock donations and matching gifts.\n\nAre stock donations typically eligible for corporate matching gift programs?\n\nThe #1 factor that determines whether an individual’s stock donation is eligible for a match through their employer is who their employer is and what that company has established in its matching gift program guidelines.\n\nFor example, some companies consider gifts of securities a particular form of in-kind donation (which the company chooses whether or not to match based on their program guidelines). In that case, stock donations made by employees of these companies will be eligible as long as that company matches in-kind gifts.\n\nOn the other hand, many businesses have classified stock donations as a form of monetary gift (in the likes of cash, debit/credit payments, or bank transfers) or a common exception to the in-kind donation rule. Donors employed by these companies are typically able to secure a gift match on behalf of your organization⁠—so long as the value of the stock falls between the businesses’ predetermined thresholds.\n\nAll of that to say, many corporations choose to match the tax-deductible value of a contribution regardless of how it was given to a nonprofit organization – yet, this does vary based on company, so make sure you’re aware of your match-eligible donors’ company parameters.\n\nAdditionally, you’ll want to keep in mind that, as gifts of securities continue to grow in popularity among donors, we can expect many companies to begin adopting stock-inclusive matching gift program criteria for employee gifts in the near future.\n\nHow can I know if an individual’s stock donation qualifies for a match?\n\nLet’s say your organization has just received a generous stock donation from a supporter of your cause. You may already know that their employer offers a matching gift program, and you’re looking to determine whether the stock gift is eligible for a match as well. Or, perhaps you’re unaware of whether the employing company matches any sort of employee donations to begin with. In either case, the answer should be located within the corporation’s matching gift program guidelines.\n\nNonprofits looking for this information may decide to conduct an online search for a company’s publicly-facing matching gift program guidelines to determine whether stock donations are mentioned. Donors seeking the information on their employers’ giving program can do a similar search of online resources, or they may look to internal documentation in an office policy handbook, workplace giving portal, etc.\n\nHowever, the easiest way to uncover match-eligibility status for any donation⁠—stock or otherwise⁠—is by utilizing a matching gift company database.\n\nLuckily, Double the Donation offers the most comprehensive database available, with detailed listings for tens of thousands of companies. Nonprofits and donors alike can begin typing a company’s name within the embedded autocompleting search tool and be instantaneously met with match qualifications, types of eligible donations, and more.\n\nIf the provided guidelines mention stock donations as a viable option for matching donations, you have your answer⁠—the gift of stock is likely matchable for your cause!\n\nIf available documentation fails to reference gifts of securities at all, we recommend encouraging donors to inquire about the possibility with their companies to find the most definitive answer to the question at hand. Sometimes corporations might not list specific contribution methods, yet those gifts will still qualify for a match!\n\nWhat are corporate stock donation matches worth?\n\nWhen a stock donation⁠ (that has previously been identified as eligible for a corporate matching gift⁠) is requested by a donor, the employer typically agrees to match the value of the stock on the day on which the stock transfer was made.\n\nThus, nonprofit donors are able to secure a match by their employer equal to the purchase price plus the appreciated value of the stock⁠—which is typically greater than the individual’s initial financial investment!\n\nWhat trends are expected regarding stock donations and matching gifts?\n\nAs of 2024, it’s estimated that many companies are willing to match the tax deductible value of a charitable gift, regardless of how that gift was made – the gift just has to benefit a charity and provide tax deductible value. With that being said, this can vary by company-specific program guidelines. As more and more companies match stocks and mutual fund contributions, it’s important for donors to check with their employer to know which types of gifts might qualify for a match.\n\nThe more popular stock grows as a form of nonprofit giving, the more companies will adopt stock-inclusive matching gift program guidelines.\n\nAnd when you take a look at the financial benefits to parties on both sides of the transaction (one research study reported fundraising growth of up to 55% for organizations that allowed non-cash donations such as stock as viable donation options!), and the ease with which gifts of securities are becoming, this form of gift matching will likely continue to grow.\n\nExamples of Companies That Match Stock Donations\n\nCompanies that match employee stock donations do so for the same reason as to why they match cash donations. These typically include corporate tax benefits, increased employee engagement, and positive public relations efforts.\n\nHere are a few examples of companies that match stock donations made by their employees to qualifying charities!\n\n1. Chevron\n\nChevron is well-regarded as having a generous corporate matching gift program, agreeing to match up to $10,000 in charitable donations per employee on an annual basis. And the best part is that they do match the market value of stock donations that their employees transfer to nearly all nonprofit organizations.\n\nHere’s a glimpse at what Chevron says about stock donations and matching gifts:\n\n“Gifts can be given to nonprofits on the Chevron Humankind site via a payroll deduction or credit card payment, or given directly to the nonprofit offline (e.g. check, cash, stock, etc.).”\n\nRead up on the full program guidelines here.\n\n2. Google\n\nGoogle offers both full and part-time employees the opportunity to participate in its corporate gift-matching initiative! Gifts worth up to $10,000 (including stock donations) will be matched to many nonprofit causes, including educational institutions, health and human services, cultural and community organizations, environmental nonprofits, and more.\n\nHere’s a glimpse at what Google says about stock donations and matching gifts:\n\n“Your gift must be in the form of check, credit card or marketable securities with a quoted market value. Gifts of securities will be matched with cash. The value of the stock will be calculated using the price at the close of the market on the day of transfer of the security.”\n\nRead up on the full program guidelines here.\n\n3. General Electric\n\nGeneral Electric has matched a wide range of employee donations since 1954. In fact, it was the first corporation to roll out a corporate gift-matching program, though it was a fairly limited offering compared to what we see now!\n\nSince then, GE has expanded its employee giving program to encompass new methods of giving⁠—including contributing securities⁠ such as stocks—as well as more nonprofits being eligible to receive funding.\n\nHere’s a glimpse at what General Electric says about stock donations and matching gifts:\n\n“Gifts may be made via cash, check, debit/credit card, or stock. Gifts may also be made by current payment from an entity such as a personal foundation or donor advised fund if that entity has been funded solely by the eligible GE participant.”\n\nRead up on the full program guidelines here.\n\n4. Merck\n\nMerck & Co. matches numerous types of employee donations to charitable organizations. Within the company’s matching program criteria, they include a fairly detailed account of stock donations⁠—including the process for requesting a corporate match and the benefits employees receive from giving this way.\n\nHere’s a glimpse at what Merck says about stock donations and matching gifts:\n\n“Matching funds can be requested for one-time cash, check, credit card, or stock donations, via the Merck Gives Back (MGB) website.\n\nWhen making a stock donation, enter the market value of the stock on the day you issued the stock to the nonprofit organization. The organization will be asked to confirm the realized value of the stock donation and the Merck Foundation P4G program will match funds equal to the realized value of donated stock.\n\nYou can deduct the full current value of the stock (regardless of purchase price) and avoid the capital gains taxes associated with selling the stock for profit; therefore, you pay no taxes on the appreciated value of the stock and take the full deduction for the current value of the stock.\n\nYou may not donate Merck stock options; however, you may donate Merck stock after you exercise your options.”\n\nRead up on the full program guidelines here.\n\n5. State Farm\n\nState Farm Insurance matches donations made by current full-time employees, part-time team members, and retired workers alike⁠—in any way they give to nonprofits. This includes gifts of securities and mutual funds, for which they detail a few stipulations of match eligibility.\n\nHere’s a glimpse at what State Farm says about stock donations and matching gifts:\n\n“Donations of Mutual Funds Units and Securities traded on the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange or NASDAQ National Market meeting the following requirements:\n\nThe eligible donor must be the sole owner or have final authority to transfer ownership of the security or mutual fund unit to the eligible organization.\n\nOwnership must be signed over to the eligible organization.\n\nPlease note: The exact value of the donated securities or mutual fund units will be based on the closing market price the date the transfer is complete.”\n\nRead up on the full program guidelines here.\n\n6. Verizon\n\nVerizon offers its employees multiple matching gift program options, the individual matching grants program being the one in which stock donations are considered match-eligible contributions.

Apple\n\nApple offers a slightly different type of corporate stock donation-matching program but will match certain gifts of securities nonetheless. Apple matches any type of stock donations as well as donations of just Apple stock.\n\nHere’s a glimpse at what Apple says about stock donations and matching gifts:\n\n“Visit the Employee Giving portal to request a matching donation for your volunteer time or to make a one-time or repeating monetary donation to the charitable organization (or cause) of your choice using a credit card or PayPal account. You can also request a match for a monetary or stock donation you’ve already made.\n\nTo be eligible, your monetary donations must be paid in full — not pledged — via cash, personal check, credit card, PayPal, or Apple stock.”\n\nRead up on the full program guidelines here.\n\n8. Edwards Lifesciences\n\nEdwards Lifesciences, a leading medical technology company based in Irvine, California, matches donations up to $5,000 per full-time employee per year.\n\nHere’s a glimpse at what the company says about stock donations and matching gifts:\n\n“Edwards Foundation will match the tax-deductible portion of employee’s gifts made by cash, check and credit card.

We’ll cover:\n\nTop Companies that Match Gifts to Colleges and Universities\n\n7 Best Practices for Matching Gifts and Higher Education\n\nMatching Gifts and Higher Education: Examples to Follow\n\nMost matching gift programs began with only matching to colleges and universities. Since then, many companies have expanded their programs to include most other nonprofit organizations. However, there still remains a large contingent of companies that only match to higher education, excluding K-12 educational organizations and schools. And that means extra potential matching opportunities for your institution!\n\nLet’s dive right in.\n\nTop Companies that Match Gifts to Colleges and Universities\n\nAlmost all the companies you’ve heard offer matching gift programs (such as Bank of America, GE, Coca-Cola, Home Depot) will match gifts to colleges or universities, too. However, for this post, we decided to put together a list of some companies with lesser-known matching gift programs. Oftentimes, when a company only matches to higher education colleges and universities, their program flies under the radar.\n\nIf your college or university is looking to boost its matching gift revenue, be on the lookout for these popular matching gift companies!\n\nAllstate Insurance\n\nAllstate has an employee matching gift program completely devoted to higher education. Through the Good Hands Matching Grant Program, Allstate matches donations made to higher education institutions at a 1:1 rate. In other words, employee donations can potentially be doubled.\n\nThe company will match a range of donations from $25 to $5,000. Individuals who are eligible include employees, agency owners, personal financial representatives, and retirees.\n\nPlus, Allstate also offers volunteer grants for employees who’d rather donate their time than money. Through the Hands in the Community Grants Program, employees and agency owners who volunteer more than 16 hours in a calendar year are eligible for volunteer grants.\n\nThe volunteer grant amount depends on the employee’s position. While regular employees are eligible for $500 volunteer grants, agency owners are eligible for $1,000 volunteer grants.\n\nRead more about Allstate’s matching gift program.\n\nConAgra Foods, Inc.\n\nConAgra will match gifts made to higher education between $25 and $1,000. Both full-time and part-time employees are eligible. However, retirees are not eligible. They also donate to other educational organizations, such as nutrition education programs.\n\nTo submit a request, employees either fill out a paper form or an electronic form. Unlike most companies, employees aren’t restricted to just one type of form. However, they do have to submit the matching gift request within 90 days of the initial donation. After that point, the company will no longer match the donation.\n\nRead more about the ConAgra Foods matching gift program.\n\neBay, Inc.\n\nThe popular online auction site, eBay, will match employee donations made between $25 and $2,500 per year. The company increased the maximum from $500 just a few years ago, which is a substantial jump!\n\nWhile full-time and part-time employees are eligible for the program, retired employees are not. In addition to matching gifts to education, eBay will also match gifts to most other nonprofit organizations. Unlike some companies, employees are urged to submit matching gift requests as soon as possible, because there’s a company-wide annual limit.\n\nAs part of its corporate philanthropy initiative, eBay also offers volunteer grants. Grant amounts are tier-based, depending on the number of volunteer hours employees finish:\n\n8-24 hours = a $100 grant\n\n25-49 hours = a $250 grant\n\n50+ hours = a $500 grant\n\nBe on the lookout for this popular employer when developing your corporate giving strategy.\n\nRead more about eBay’s matching gift program.\n\nSherwin-Williams\n\nSherwin-Williams offers a matching gift program where the company matches up to $3,000 in donations to a wide variety of nonprofits. This includes higher education institutions. The company’s matching gift program is open to both current employees as well as retirees.\n\nThe company matches at a 1.5:1 ratio. For instance, if a match-eligible individual donates $100 to your school, your institution will receive a $150 match, totaling $350.\n\nIn case that’s not impressive enough, Sherwin-Williams also has a great volunteer grant program. After an employee volunteers 50 hours, Sherwin-Williams provides the eligible organization or school with $200. Each employee can request up to three separate grants each year, totaling $600.\n\nRead more about Sherwin-Williams’ matching gift program.\n\nExxonMobil\n\nExxonMobil is very well-known for its corporate philanthropy, specifically for its efforts toward educational institutions. The company offers two matching gift programs, the Arts and Cultural Matching Gift Program and the Educational Matching Gift Program.\n\nThrough the Educational Matching Gift Program, ExxonMobil will match donations to higher education institutions, including U.S. colleges and universities. They’ll provide up to $22,500 in matching gift funds per year. However, for cultural organizations, the company only matches up to $2,000.\n\nPlus, the company offers two volunteer grant programs. For its individual grant program, when an employee or retiree volunteers for 20 hours, ExxonMobil provides a volunteer grant of $500. Each individual can request up to four grants per year. For its team volunteer involvement program, ExxonMobil awards a $500 grant when a team of five or more eligible participants volunteers for a combined total of at least 20 hours. While employees are limited to $2,000 in grants per year, individual organizations are limited to $5,000.\n\nRead more about ExxonMobil’s matching gift program.\n\n7 Best Practices for Matching Gifts and Higher Education\n\nNow that you know of a few major companies that offer matching gifts to higher education institutions, let’s dive into a few ways you can incorporate them into your fundraising strategy. Let’s explore seven tried-and-true tips here!\n\n1. Ensure your team understands the importance of matching gifts and higher education.\n\nBefore you can promote (and communicate the value of) matching gifts to your institution’s donor base, it’s critical that your fundraising team is up to speed. Be sure to incorporate department-wide meetings to explore matching gift opportunities, what that means for your institution, and how you can collect more corporate funding for your efforts.\n\nAnd if you’re not sure your team understands the impact of matching gifts, consider sharing powerful statistics like these:\n\nMore than 26 million individuals work for companies that offer matching gift programs.\n\nOver 78% of that 26 million (or approximately 20.3 million) people have no idea whether their employer matches gifts.\n\nAn estimated $2 to $3 billion is donated annually through corporate matching gift programs.\n\nAn additional $4 to $7 billion in available match funding is left on the table each year, largely due to a lack of awareness.\n\n84% of survey participants reported that they’d be more likely to donate to a nonprofit if their employer was matching the donation.\n\n1 in 3 participants stated that they’d likely make a larger donation if it was being matched.\n\nThen, once they’re on board, you’ll likely want your development and fundraising staff to be familiar with top companies that match gifts to colleges and universities, common matching gift program guidelines to look out for, and how to assist donors as they walk through the process of requesting their employer matches.\n\nAnd that’s just the beginning! As you continue to develop your matching gift strategy to direct more corporate dollars toward your school, it’s essential that everyone stays on the same page.\n\n2. Enlist multiple methods for collecting alumni employment information.\n\nYour alumni are likely some of your school’s most dedicated supporters. As they move on from your institution and begin their careers in the real world, make sure you have a process in place for collecting and tracking graduates’ employment information. This will enable you to screen donors and alumni against some of the most generous matching gift companies, such as those mentioned above.\n\nMore than likely, your alumni employment data search will include some combination of the following:\n\nMatching gift software\n\nEmail domain screening\n\nEmployer appends\n\nAlumni outreach\n\nBut you don’t have to pick just one method, either! The more you know, the better. Our research shows even that incorporating more than one approach for identifying matching gift eligible donors results in 77% more identified potential matches. So perhaps you might leverage domain screening and donor outreach, then utilize an employer appending service to help fill in any remaining gaps. You can even attend fundraising conferences to uncover new techniques for determining matching gift eligibility.\n\n3. Screen donors and prospects for employers with matching gift programs.\n\nOnce you’ve located donor and alumni employment data, you can utilize the information to identify matching gift eligible donors. Here are a few best practices you can follow as you do so:\n\nCheck out top matching gift programs from well-known companies like these.\n\nEmphasize companies that match gifts to colleges and universities.\n\nExplore additional matching gift companies with a comprehensive database.\n\nStudies show that more than 26 million individuals work for companies that offer some form of matching gift program. More than likely, that’s a significant portion of your school’s donors⁠—you just have to figure out which ones are eligible and where to go from there.\n\n4. Communicate the value of matching gifts and higher education impact to donors.\n\nDonors love participating in their employers’ gift-matching programs because the initiatives enable them to make a larger impact through their initial donations. Because this is one of the top motivating factors for participation, it’s a good idea to place a significant emphasis on doubled (and sometimes even tripled!) benefits that a matching gift can bring.\n\nFor example, let’s say a donor contributed $500 to provide 100 books for your newly built library. Be sure to highlight that, should that individual secure a match for their already-generous donation, they can essentially provide 200 books to make twice the impact⁠—all without having to reach back into their own wallets.\n\n5. Follow up with donors on match-eligible gifts and provide employer-specific guidelines.\n\nYour school’s online donation process should gather ample information about your donors as they complete the giving process⁠—including their employment status. After the transaction is complete, your fundraising team can (and should) leverage those collected insights in order to drive more matches to completion.\n\nPicture this: Let’s say Donor Johnny entered his employer’s name in your donation page search tool, and you see that he works for the Home Depot. Afterward, you’ve collected that information, along with the data on the $1,000 gift that he made, to determine that his donation is matching gift eligible. But Johnny might not know that himself!\n\nThat’s why we recommend that you follow up with donors post-transaction to share whichever insights you’ve collected about their employers’ matching gift program availability. This should include minimum and maximum match amounts, match ratios, types of qualifying donors and organizations, and submission deadlines. And in order to really seal the deal, you can even equip donors with direct links to their employers’ matching program online submission forms!\n\n6. Integrate matching gifts in your university’s Giving Day strategy.\n\nHundreds of higher education institutions host annual Giving Days as a way to drive engagement with their schools each year. These efforts are often particularly effective fundraising campaigns, with many schools collecting the majority of their revenue in a short, 24-hour period.\n\nWith such high levels of traffic interacting with an institution’s donation forms in that time-frame, it makes sense to use the opportunity to promote employer matching gifts. And doing so enables donors to double (or sometimes even triple!) their impact on your school.\n\nIf you’re planning an upcoming Giving Day for your school, we recommend getting up and running with innovative matching gift software beforehand—which brings us to our next tip!\n\n7. Streamline your efforts with matching gifts and higher education software.\n\nBy adding a matching gift database like Double the Donation to your tech toolkit, you significantly boost your fundraising potential without putting a ton of added work on your team members’ plates. This fully automated matching gift platform identifies more match-eligible donors, automatically follows up with them, and even creates an automated match plan for you.\n\nNot to mention, you can easily integrate Double the Donation’s matching gift automation tool⁠—360MatchPro⁠—across higher education fundraising channels such as GiveCampus, Anthology, Almabase, Ellucian, and more. Thanks to available matching gift and higher education software partnerships, institutions like yours can quickly raise more by adding company gift-matching functionality to their existing fundraising systems!\n\nMatching Gifts and Higher Education: Examples to Follow\n\nHundreds of schools and universities have successfully implemented these strategies to effectively promote matching gift fundraising opportunities to donors, alumni, and their overall communities. Let’s look at a few examples of how the right matching gift solutions can help boost your college’s funds!\n\nFlagler College’s Dedicated Matching Gift Page\n\nIf alumni are looking for different ways to support their alma mater, well-designed matching gift pages can offer helpful information about multiplying their contributions. Check out this example of a dedicated matching gift page from Flagler College!\n\nFlagler College’s web page provides alumni with instructions on how to obtain a matching donation from their employer. Plus, they’ve embedded the search tool and encouraged donors to look for more in-depth information about their employers’ matching gift programs.

Learn how to promote matching gifts for higher education with this Double the Donation guide. Ensure your school doesn’t miss out on revenue opportunities by incorporating these practices.\n\nAt Double the Donation, we often discuss corporate matching gifts—or initiatives through which employers financially match the donations made by individual employees to qualifying nonprofits. However, there’s another powerful⁠ (yet even lesser-known⁠) opportunity to keep an eye out for. And that is companies that offer fundraising matches!\n\nFundraising match programs also involve employer matching. However, unlike typical matching programs that solely cover financial donations made from an employee’s own wallet, fundraising match programs involve a company matching all of the funds raised by an employee during a fundraising activity. This is particularly important to consider in regard to one of the most popular fundraisers in the nonprofit world: the Run/Walk/Ride event.\n\nThese events involve participants running/walking/cycling (or partaking in another activity!) for a certain distance and collecting pledges on your organization’s behalf according to the distance they cover. And for volunteer fundraisers that work for a company offering fundraising matching, these fulfilled pledges can be doubled for even greater impact.\n\nNow, you might be wondering what kinds of employers offer these initiatives⁠—and how your team can locate donors who qualify. Lucky for you, there are a ton of available programs.\n\nWe’ve selected a selection of companies that offer fundraising matches, which we’ll discuss below:\n\nIntuit, Inc.\n\nBP\n\nState Street Corporation\n\nPenguin Random House\n\nCVS Health\n\nBoeing\n\nNumerator\n\nThe Estee Lauder Companies\n\nNorthstrat\n\nKeep in mind that there are a ton more participating businesses, too. These are just a sample!\n\nBut before diving into the above companies, we’re going to look at the easiest way to uncover these opportunities⁠—with dedicated matching gift tools.\n\nThe Best Way to Discover Matching Gifts\n\nTo best capitalize on these fundraising matching programs, you first need to discover where they exist. The easiest way to do that is by using dedicated matching gift software.\n\nMatching gift software allows your organization to easily uncover and pursue these opportunities within your network of support. For example, Double the Donation’s 360MatchPro is a fully automated matching gift platform that uncovers a donor’s match eligibility once a donation is made and triggers automated outreach with company-specific program guidelines to drive next steps. Thousands of nonprofits trust Double the Donation to fuel their matching gift fundraising needs⁠—including more than 70% of the nation’s largest organizations!\n\nAnd, built on the industry’s most comprehensive database of employee giving program information, it doesn’t just provide insights on individual matching opportunities, either. 360MatchPro enables donors to seamlessly locate details regarding their employers’ volunteer grant and fundraising match programs as well! And it’s made easy to get started thanks to technology integrations with most online donation forms and CRMs.\n\nWith that, check out these top examples of companies that offer fundraising matches.\n\nCompanies that Match Gifts to Run/Walk/Ride Events\n\nTons of companies participate in fundraising match programs which ultimately amplify the result of individual (or team) employee fundraising efforts.

Like traditional matching gifts, tons of qualifying supporters remain unaware of the programs in place by their employers. So in order to drive participation, it’s important that you inform them.\n\nCheck out a few of our favorite ideas for doing so:\n\nShare general information on social media. Post a fun graphic that states, “Many companies match donations collected by employees for peer-to-peer fundraising events. Find out how to get involved here!” Then, be sure to link to your organization’s dedicated matching gift page where they can learn more about their employers’ programs.\n\nReach out to existing P2P volunteers directly. Send an email⁠ or text—or make a phone call⁠—to supporters who are already fundraising on your nonprofit’s behalf. Let them know how they can find out if they qualify for a fundraising match from their employer and how to get started. As you do, remember to emphasize the increased impact that fundraising match initiatives can bring!\n\nWrapping Up\n\nFundraising match programs are the perfect addition to any Run/Walk/Ride or other peer-to-peer giving based event. And being aware of the companies that offer fundraising matches is an essential first step.\n\nIf you’re planning such an event, check to see if any of your donors work for the above companies. If your participants qualify, you may ultimately receive twice the fundraised donations for that supporter!\n\nHowever, keep in mind that they themselves may not be aware of the opportunity at hand. Thus, it helps to provide guidance and resources throughout the process to drive more available fundraising matches to completion.\n\nAt Double the Donation, we receive a wide range of inquiries from organizations seeking to maximize their matching gift revenue by proactively pursuing matches for all qualifying donations. One question that comes up on occasion has to do with matching gifts-in-kind⁠—and whether in-kind donations are eligible to be matched through corporate matching gift programs.\n\nThe answer to this question can be a bit nuanced as the matching gift eligibility of gifts can vary based on company-specific guidelines. But let’s dive deeper into the subject by exploring some of the most commonly asked questions along with hearing from real companies’ matching gift programs.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll cover the following:\n\nFAQ from Nonprofits and Donors on Matching Gifts-in-Kind\n\nWhat Popular Matching Gift Companies Say About In-Kind Gifts\n\nInterested in learning more about matching gift best practices, leveraging in-kind donations, and how the two fit together? Let’s begin!\n\nFAQ from Nonprofits and Donors on Matching Gifts-in-Kind\n\nUnderstanding matching gifts and in-kind donations can be tricky. Here are some of the most commonly asked questions from nonprofits like yours (and sometimes even their donors!).\n\nWhat are in-kind donations?\n\nIn-kind donations⁠—or gifts-in-kind⁠—are typically considered any type of non-monetary contribution to a nonprofit cause. While many donors provide cash (or check, credit card, bank transfer, etc.) that allows the organization to purchase goods and services required to keep their mission running, in-kind donations are offerings of the goods and services themselves.\n\nOne of the most common examples of gifts-in-kind is that of a canned food drive for a local food bank or pantry. People within a community are asked to provide donations of non-perishable food items which will then be distributed to the organization’s beneficiaries, as opposed to providing funds that the organization uses to make food purchases themselves.\n\nOther types of in-kind donations you might see include crypto-currency gifts, vehicle donations, clothing drives, fundraising event prizes (such as auction items), technology and office equipment, free rentals (such as meeting spaces), or volunteer hours of specialized skills (such as graphic design, tax consulting, etc.).\n\nAre gifts-in-kind eligible to be matched through matching gift programs?\n\nThis is a frequently asked question regarding gifts-in-kind⁠—by both the donors contributing the in-kind donations and the nonprofits receiving them. Here are a few examples of inquiries you might see:\n\nFrom a donor ⁠—\n\n“I work for a company with a matching gift program and want to donate food and supplies to a nonprofit to assist with a recent natural disaster. Do most companies match these in-kind donations?”\n\nFrom a nonprofit ⁠—\n\n“We’re reviewing our list of donors from the past few months and noticed that some individuals who made in-kind donations work for companies with matching gift programs. Are these donations eligible to be matched?”\n\nIf you’re looking for a quick explanation, you can assume the answer can vary depending on the company being asked, especially if the in-kind donation is given in the form of stocks or crypto-currencies.\n\nThis nuance adds a layer of complexity to matching gift programs – even if some parties define stock or crypto donations as “in-kind” gifts of property, many corporations classify these assets differently than personal property like a tractor trailer or canned food.\n\nBecause each company develops its own unique set of matching gift program guidelines, it can be difficult to provide a blanket answer for for which types of in-kind gifts are match-eligible. However, we’ll explore a few businesses’ eligibility criteria below to get a better sense of the relationship between matching gifts and in-kind donations.\n\nAnother thing to keep an eye out for when it comes to in-kind donations of time and services (rather than goods and products) is volunteer grants!\n\nSimilar to matching gifts, volunteer grants are workplace giving programs offered by companies where they agree to financially support the nonprofits their employees are involved with. Though not all volunteer work is considered an in-kind donation (it typically must be an individual volunteering their “specialized skills”), supporters who work for companies with volunteer grants may want to look into these offerings as well.\n\nHow do you determine whether a gift-in-kind is match-eligible?\n\nThe easiest way to find out if any nonprofit donation is matchable is by utilizing a company database such as Double the Donation. This is true for gifts-in-kind as well as your traditional monetary contributions.\n\nWith this tool in hand, all you (or your donors) need to do is begin a quick search of the company’s name⁠—the database widget will even autocomplete search inquiries and account for spelling errors, name variations, and subsidiaries⁠—and the specific matching gift guidelines will be available in seconds.\n\nIf a donor’s employer is listed in the database, it should include a document or online portal where users can go to find out more information about program eligibility. This is likely where the information about in-kind match qualifications is housed, which will provide you with your answer.\n\nWhat Popular Matching Gift Companies Say About In-Kind Gifts\n\nThousands of companies offer corporate matching gift programs where they agree to financially match donations made by their employees. Employees and nonprofits want to know whether gifts-in-kind are matching gift eligible, but it can be difficult to determine as it varies from company to company.\n\nBut let’s hear from some real companies! Here are excerpts from a few companies with matching gift programs and what they say about in-kind matching in their program guidelines!\n\nIt’s important to note: While some of these companies do not offer matches on personal or real property, they do offer matches for stock and marketable securities – this distinction shows the nuance in matching gift programs that are important to learn. If you have employees who work for a match-eligible company, make sure they know if their stock or crypto-currency gifts qualify"
