        "text": "Chatbot development challenges\n\nHowever, he also cited hurdles that can trip up chatbot design efforts. Enabling chatbots to engage in a real dialogue with people is a tall order, Mattarella-Micke said. The same goes for ensuring that the technology can meet user expectations on service and information delivery.\n\n\"Threading the needle exactly on what users want and what they get is a difficult challenge with chatbots,\" he warned.\n\nThat's why Intuit isn't asking its chatbots to do more at this point. They aren't being designed to carry on lengthy conversations with users of the Mountain View, Calif., company's software; interactions tend to be brief, without a lot of back-and-forth discussion.\n\n\"Dialogue is hard, but the best way to tackle that is to make the conversation as simple as possible,\" Mattarella-Micke said. \"We've created very basic rules for responding to what customers are saying. It's less of a dialogue now than a sort of informed lookup that we're iterating on.\"\n\nNor are the chatbots being set up to address particular issues faced by individual customers.\n\n\"We can have customers asking about things that are very specific to their situations -- that's not something we can tackle in our [chatbot] applications,\" he said.\n\nKeeping it simple on chatbot design\n\nThe chatbot's limited uses will be supported by a mix of retrieval-based chatbots and ones that base their responses on natural language understanding (NLU) rules.\n\nMattarella-Micke and his fellow data scientists decided against using more complex generative sequencing and reinforcement learning chatbot models, which he said require larger inputs of relevant data to work effectively and \"can easily go off the rails\" in responding to customers if they aren't designed properly.\n\nThe NLU piece of the chatbot design process involves building an understanding of Intuit's product vocabulary into the models -- so, for example, a chatbot knows that deleting and removing invoices mean the same thing. Embedding sentence vectors to help the chatbots predict the right responses based on what customers say \"has been a very fruitful approach for us\" on NLU, Mattarella-Micke said.\n\nWhile the chatbot implementation strategy is narrowly focused now, Intuit does have some bigger plans in mind. For example, Mattarella-Micke said one of the data science team's future goals is to build a \"chatbot orchestrator\" that can assess incoming customer inquiries and route them to different chatbots based on the information or assistance people are seeking."
