The single was extremely popular on radio reaching number one for Classic Hits, Classic Rock, Most Added, Greatest Spin Gainer and Greatest Audience Gainer with a Top 10 Chart Debut at Adult Contemporary Radio. The single encapsulates Joel’s signature sound while bringing listeners into the next chapter of his music journey.\n\nJoel’s intimate show at Intuit Dome will include some of his most beloved songs from throughout his illustrious career. The show promises a night of outstanding live entertainment and music.\n\nTickets will go on sale beginning Friday, March 1 at 10:00 a.m. PT at Ticketmaster.com. Presales start on Monday, February 26 at 10:00 a.m. PT and go through Thursday, February 29 at 10:00 p.m. PT at Ticketmaster.com. Fans can follow @IntuitDome for more show information.\n\nAbout Billy Joel\n\nNew York’s quintessential son ranks as one of the most popular recording artists and respected entertainers in history. The singer/songwriter/composer is the sixth best-selling recording artist and the fourth-best-selling solo artist with over 160 million records sold worldwide. His 1985 compilation album, Greatest Hits Vol. 1 & 2, is one of the best-selling albums in the United States.\n\nJoel’s songs have acted as personal and cultural touchstones for millions of people across five decades. Joel’s string of 33 Top 40 hits, all of which Joel has written himself, began with 1973’s autobiographical ‘Piano Man,’ written while Joel was playing in a Los Angeles lounge. In 2016, the Library of Congress selected ‘Piano Man’ for preservation in the National Recording Registry for its ‘cultural, historic and artistic significance.’ The hits have continued for almost five decades, with three of Joel’s Top 40 songs – ‘It’s Still Rock and Roll To Me,’ ‘Tell Her About It’ and ‘We Didn’t Start The Fire’ – peaking at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 charts and 23 GRAMMY nominations awarded to Joel since he signed his first recording contract in 1972."
