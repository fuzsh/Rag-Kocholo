Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nYou might not expect ground-breaking architectural design from Intuit, the 33-year-old software company behind QuickBooks and TurboTax.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut with its newest addition to the Mountain View, California, campus, Intuit shows it can hold its own among neighbors Google, LinkedIn, and Quora.\n\nBuilding 20, completed in October, brings contemporary design and sustainable practices to the HQ — including exterior windows that cleverly prevent bird strikes. Take a look inside.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIntuit set up shop in Mountain View, California, the heart of Silicon Valley, more than 20 years ago. The tech giant has grown building by building since then.\n\nThe newest addition, Building 20, was \"an opportunity for us to do something we’ve never done before,\" says Chris Glennon, vice president of global real estate at Intuit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA four-story atrium where employees and visitors enter sets the tone. \"We were definitely wanting to push the design into a bolder area,\" Glennon says.\n\nConference rooms framed in concrete and steel jut out from the atrium's sides.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA grand staircase encourages people to get moving, instead of taking the elevators.\n\nIntuit committed to using small businesses to furnish the building. Ohio Furniture, HD Buttercup, and 2b Design contributed pieces for modern, flexible lounge areas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe kitchen table where founder Scott Cook first came up with the idea for Quicken is on display in a well-trafficked corridor. Cook allegedly holds impromptu meetings there.\n\nBasketball courts create an outdoor area where employees can blow off steam.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA \"reflection garden,\" furnished with wind sculptures created by a Santa Fe, New Mexico, artist, provide a quiet place to dream up the next Intuit product.\n\nWhen employees grow tired of being cooped up at their desk, they can move to the outdoor patio space. It's WiFi-connected, of course.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Intuit Studio is where employees observe beta-testers using the latest software. Cameras are placed throughout to capture multiple testers at a time.\n\nSoft lighting and a comfy armchair make this nursing room a cozy one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuilding 20 achieves the highest rating of sustainability by the US Government Green Building Council. Rooftop solar panels generate 25% of the building's energy needs.\n\nGlass walls let in tons of natural light. You can't tell from afar, but the exterior windows actually use smart design to prevent birds from flying into the building ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFaint lines that run across the panes are just obvious enough to avert collisions. Intuit worked with the Audubon Society to come up with this solution.\n\nNative grasses grow all around the building, providing vegetation to encourage and support the migration of local bird species.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiant photography murals bring the natural world inside.\n\nBuilding 20 will become home to 1,000 employees serving global small businesses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I love being able to bring spaces like this to life,\" Glennon says. \"It enhances the employee experience, and it makes people excited to work there.\"\n\nRead next\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.
