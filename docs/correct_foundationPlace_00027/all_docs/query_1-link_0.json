Intuit also gained the attention of the media when it was caught lobbying against the revenue service for providing income taxpayers with prefilled forms and documents.\n\nHistory of Intuit:\n\nIntuit Inc was founded by Scott Cook and Tom Proulx in 1983 in Palo Alto City, California. Both the founders of Intuit previously used to work at Procter & Gamble on desktop computers which allowed them for better accounting and management rather than pen and paper-based accounting. Intuit was initially founded in the garage of university avenue in Palo Alto by the two founders of Stanford University. Intuit’s first product was a software called Quicken that allowed the developers to use the BASIC programming language for IBM’s personal computers and the UCSD Pascal language for the Apple II computer.\n\nBy 1988, Intuit's first product Quicken was leading the market through its software. But in 1991, Microsoft decided to enter this competition with their software application called Microsoft money. To beat the competition, Intuit allowed its customers to have an extra $15 promotional code for a discount as well as redeemable prices for the software purchased by consumers and businesses by Intuit.\n\nIn 1993, Intuit filed for its IPO and then went public by acquiring a big tax preparation software company called Chipsoft located in San Diego. Intuit allowed its customers to file their taxes easily due to which it gained rapid growth and within one year its valuation crossed the 2 billion dollar mark.\n\nBut recently, Intuit has been facing charges through various federal agencies for their tax filing controversies. But by 1999, Intuit had diversified its product and services towards personal finance, accounting software, and tax return software. Intuit bought large chunks of shares in companies like Excite, Lacerte software for tax filing preparation, and an online bill payment service called CheckFree.\n\nIn 2013, Thomas Bravo firm bought the financial services unit from Intuit Inc. By May 2018, Intuit had crossed the mark of 5 billion dollars in revenue with a market capitalization of more than 60 billion dollars. In August 2018, Sasan Goodarzi became the CEO of Intuit along with Scott Cook as the chairman of Intuit. In 2022, Intuit had to pay a settlement fine of more than 140 million dollars to the US Federal Trade Commission for showing misleading advertisements to their customers and businesses.\n\nIntuit Inc. – Products and Services:\n\nThe various products and services provided by Intuit Inc are as follows:\n\nTurboTax – TurboTax is a popular tax filing and preparation software by Intuit that allows users to file both State and Federal income tax returns.
