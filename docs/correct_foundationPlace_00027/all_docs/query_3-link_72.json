        "text": "Two of India’s leading financial and IT executives, Mr. Nachiket Mor and Mr. Kiran Karnik, have been named to Intuit Inc.’s newly established India Advisory Board. Intuit, a leading developer of business and personal finance management software, created the board after launching its Global Business Division in India last month.\n\nIntuit looks forward to working closely and learning from these experts on the greatest areas for opportunity in India and gaining their insight to help build relationships with key enablers in the country.\n\nMr. Mor, a financial services expert, is the head of the ICICI Foundation for Inclusive Growth, and a former deputy managing director of ICICI Bank. He’s been actively involved in India’s rural and micro banking initiatives and has in-depth knowledge of banking and financial management in India.\n\nMr. Karnik, a recognized thought leader in IT and communications, was President of NASSCOM, the National Association of Software and Services Companies, from 2001-2008, and is a permanent invitee on its Board. Expected to counsel Intuit’s India business unit, he is the ex-managing director of Discovery Networks and was named “Face of the Year” by Forbes magazine for his role in India’s off-shoring wave. Intuit expects his UNESCO award-winning interest in bringing technology and communications to rural India to help it design better financial solutions for Indian small businesses.\n\nCommenting on these appointments to the advisory board, Umang Bedi, Managing Director of Intuit India and Emerging Markets - Global Business Division said: “We’re honored to have such elite dignitaries guiding our endeavors. Their expertise and experience will help us delve into the psyche of the Indian consumers and small businesses. Their valuable inputs and foresight will help us reach out to greater India, with a razor-sharp focus. They’ll play an important role in helping us develop and deliver solutions in India, for India.”\n\nThe Advisory Board supports Intuit India’s path-breaking approach to create tailor-made solutions to address important unsolved problems for consumers and small businesses in India. The overall intent is to provide these underserved markets with a suite of connected services to help revolutionize millions of lives in India."
