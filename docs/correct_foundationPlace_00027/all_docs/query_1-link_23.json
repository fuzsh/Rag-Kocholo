        "meta_description": "Intuit uses AWS to deploy an omnichannel cloud customer contact center in two weeks instead of six months, support seasonal traffic by scaling from 6,000 agents to 11,000 in minutes, and communicate more effectively with customers. Intuit is a leading provider of financial and tax preparation software solutions globally. The company implemented an Amazon Connect–based solution that gives TurboTax and QuickBooks support agents an integrated voice, web, chat, and messaging contact center.",

        "text": "Intuit had already been using the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud to support internal applications, and it chose AWS again to meet its contact center needs. “We’ve worked with AWS since 2013, and our strategy in general is to move our offerings to the public cloud to take advantage of the elasticity it provides,” says Lekhter.\n\nIntuit decided to implement Amazon Connect, an easy-to-use, omnichannel cloud contact center that companies can use to simplify contact center operations and add agents from anywhere. “Using Amazon Connect, we realized we could enable a unified contact center spanning multiple business units and integrating voice, chat, messaging, and web,” says Lekhter. Amazon Connect also enables Intuit to integrate its web experiences where users can self-service frequently asked questions prior to engaging, reducing strain on contact center agents and giving them more time to interact with customers.\n\nWith more than 275 million minutes of customer interactions each year, Intuit uses Contact Lens for Amazon Connect, which provides contact center analytics powered by machine learning (ML), to provide accurate call transcriptions, redaction of sensitive data, and automated call metrics to determine the effectiveness of its contact center. Contact Lens builds on AWS ML services, using Amazon Transcribe, a service that automatically converts speech to text, to generate call transcripts and Amazon Comprehend, a natural language processing (NLP) service, to extract sentiment.\n\nTo further improve its customer service, Intuit takes advantage of Amazon Polly, an AWS service that converts text into lifelike speech. Intuit agents set their voicemail greetings and interactive voice response prompts and messages using Amazon Polly. Additionally, Intuit uses the Amazon DynamoDB database service to automatically manage its universal queue functionality and to open or close contact centers instantly.\n\nThousands of Intuit contact center agents in 11 countries now use Amazon Connect for voice, chat, and messaging services for the company’s QuickBooks and TurboTax businesses.\n\nRelying on Amazon Connect, Intuit deployed its new cloud contact center much faster than before. “It took two weeks to deploy an integrated contact center using Amazon Connect, from installation to getting agents up and running on the solution,” says Lekhter. “That process previously took us at least six months.”\n\nDuring tax season, Intuit can scale from 6,000 agents to 11,000 agents on demand and pay only for the services used. “Scaling our solution for tax season only takes a few minutes now, and it doesn’t require us to manage and maintain contact centers for 11,000 agents all year. That reduces our operational costs,” Lekhter says. “We've gone from a model where we pay for the hardware and licenses to just paying by the minute for each call.” Additionally, Intuit has been able to load test its production environment to 20,000 agents, ensuring it has enough capacity to support peak periods.\n\nIntuit is improving customer experience by delivering a cloud-based, unified contact center solution. “Using Amazon Connect, we can support our business with a single contact center that offers a single pane of glass for visibility across all our agents,” says Lekhter. As a result, Intuit customers now have a seamless experience, with their data moving across each business unit and their questions resolved promptly. “Because the data is in one location and is automatically transferred, customers no longer have to repeat information from agent to agent.”\n\nThe company also relies on Amazon Connect to support callback functionality, so customers can set up an appointment online and receive a call back from a contact center agent at a scheduled time. “If customers don’t want to wait to communicate with an agent, we can keep them in the queue and call them back, so they don’t have to sit on hold listening to music,” says Lekhter.\n\nAnother benefit of using Amazon Connect is improved voice clarity. “We have HD voice quality on Amazon Connect, and it is so much better that our agents and customers are impressed,” Lekhter says. “This is reflected in our customer surveys and what we’re hearing from our agents. Better voice quality ultimately makes our customers happier with Intuit and happier with the products.”\n\nIntuit is taking advantage of the integration of Amazon Connect with other AWS services to enable new capabilities. “We can go from ideation to production in a few weeks, compared to months previously,” says Lekhter. The company plans to add new security functionality, such as secure interactive voice response (IVR) built on top of Amazon Connect to ensure that customer data is highly secure. “AWS helps us innovate more quickly and easily to improve our customers’ experience, while also lowering our operational costs.”\n\nTo learn more, visit aws.amazon.com/connect."
