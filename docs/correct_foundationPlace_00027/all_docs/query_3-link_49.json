        "text": "Continuus Technologies Appears on INC. 5000 fastest growing companies List, ranking no. 158th in the Midwest and No. 2,935 Nationally\n\nInc. Magazine Reveals Annual List of America’s Fastest-Growing Private Companies – the Inc. 5000\n\nNEW YORK, August 15, 2023 – Inc. magazine today revealed that Continuus Technologies is No. 2,935 nationally and No. 158 in the Midwest on its annual Inc. 5000 list, the most prestigious ranking of the nation’s fastest-growing private companies. The list represents a unique look at the most successful companies within the American economy’s most dynamic segment – its independent small businesses. Intuit, Zappos, Under Armour, Microsoft, Patagonia, and many other well-known names gained their first national exposure as honorees on the Inc. 5000.\n\nComplete results of the Inc. 5000, including company profiles and an interactive database that can be sorted by industry, region, and other criteria, can be found at www.inc.com/inc5000. The top 500 companies are featured in the September issue of Inc., which will be available on newsstands on August 20.\n\n“This year’s Inc. 5000 Regional winners represent one of the most exceptional and exciting lists of America’s off-the-charts growth companies. They’re disrupters and job creators, and all delivered an outsize impact on the economy. Remember their names and follow their lead. These are the companies you’ll be hearing about for years to come,” said Scott Omelianuk, editor-in-chief of Inc. magazine.\n\nAbout Continuus Technologies\n\nContinuus Technologies provides end-to-end business intelligence, data analytics, and enterprise data management (EDM) strategies and technology solutions. Our consultants collaboratively serve organizations in the financial services, manufacturing, healthcare, and energy sectors. We are based in the heart of Milwaukee's thriving Third Ward but work with organizations around the country. Continuus is the only firm in North America that specializes in both analytics and EDM with such a wide breadth of technologies and methodologies. We leverage our expanse of knowledge and cumulative years of experience to offer modern solutions using the most cutting-edge, forward-thinking technologies with a foundation of classical training in traditional data tools and solutions.\n\nMethodology\n\nCompanies on the 2021 Inc. 5000 are ranked according to percentage revenue growth from 2017 to 2020. To qualify, companies must have been founded and generating revenue by March 31, 2017. They must be U.S.-based, privately held, for-profit, and independent—not subsidiaries or divisions of other companies—as of December 31, 2020. (Since then, some on the list may have gone public or been acquired.) The minimum revenue required for 2017 is $100,000; the minimum for 2020 is $2 million. As always, Inc. reserves the right to decline applicants for subjective reasons. Growth rates used to determine company rankings were calculated to three decimal places. There was one tie on this year’s Inc. 5000. Companies on the Inc. 500 are featured in Inc.’s September issue. They represent the top tier of the Inc. 5000, which can be found at http://www.inc.com/inc5000.\n\nAbout Inc. Media\n\nThe world’s most trusted business-media brand, Inc. offers entrepreneurs the knowledge, tools, connections, and community to build great companies.
