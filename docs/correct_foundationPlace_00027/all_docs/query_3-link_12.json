        "text": "Intuit Inc.'s (NASDAQ: INTU) Quicken Family of Products, the leader in electronic personal finance management, has launched a charity offering of twenty celebrity angel sketches that begins today on eBay and runs through October 11th as a part of its Quicken Angels 2000 Project. In conjunction with the charity event, Quicken also launched the sale of its limited edition Quicken Angel Dollar Bill, available during the month of October. All proceeds from the eBay listing and the dollar bill sale will be donated to the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation*.\n\nThe charity items, which can be accessed at www.ebay.com/charity, consist of artwork designed and donated by David Arquette, Tom Bergeron, Roma Downey, Fran Drescher, John Edwards, Joely Fisher, Larry Hagman, Kathy Ireland, Linda Lavin, Eric McCormack, Liza Minnelli, Caroline Rhea, Jane Seymour, Ivy Supersonic and Walt Willey. Angels donated by recent Emmy Award Winners James Gandolfini and Megan Mullally are also on sale.\n\nThe Quicken Angel Dollar Bill is a real dollar bill with an engraved angel sticker in place of George Washington. It will be on sale for $3.50 through October 31st via the Internet at Quicken.com (www.quicken.com/angel) or by calling 1-877-593-2022 between the hours of 8AM and 5PM EDT. Last month, Quicken asked consumers to view and select their favorite celebrity sketches in an online vote at Quicken.com. The winning sketch-created by Fran Drescher-will grace the cover of the card holding the Quicken Angel Dollar Bill.\n\nThe Quicken Angels 2000 Project was established by Intuit to honor the exceptional women in our lives by raising money for breast cancer research and community outreach programs in an effort to ultimately eradicate this disease. For more information on the charity event on eBay or the Quicken Angel Dollar Bill, please visit www.quicken.com/angel.\n\n\"We are extremely appreciative to the celebrities who so generously donated their time and creative energy to raise money for the Quicken Angels 2000 Project,\" said Carla Fried, managing editor of Quicken.com. \"We are confident that money raised from the fundraiser on eBay, coupled with sales of the Quicken Angel Dollar Bill, will make this year's Quicken Angels effort even more successful than last year's.\"\n\n\"A key to our success at the Komen Foundation is that we collaborate with a variety of companies and individuals to provide creative ways for people to make a difference in the fight against breast cancer. The Quicken Angels 2000 Project is a wonderful example of this collaboration,\" said Nancy Brinker, founding chair of the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. \"At the Komen Foundation, we always say that my sister Suzy is our guardian angel, watching over all we do in her name. We'd like to extend our heartfelt thanks to the other 'angels' that have made this program possible - our friends at Intuit, the celebrities who graciously donated their time and talents, and ultimately, those consumers who participate in this program.\""
