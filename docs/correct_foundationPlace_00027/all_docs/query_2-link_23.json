        "text": "In support of Intuit’s Art Design Chicago exhibition, Chicago Calling: Art Against the Flow, Intuit proudly presented the Art Against the Flow Summit on November 1-3, 2018, at Intuit and the Ace Hotel Chicago.\n\nThe Summit provided a forum for the various constituents of outsider art–artists, educators, curators, dealers, collectors, students and general appreciators–to contribute to the conversations, panels and programming surrounding the role of place in the artistic output from a wide spectrum of artists.\n\nPlease use this page as a reference with video recordings, images and resources from the Art Against the Flow Summit.\n\nPhotos from the Art Against the Flow Summit\n\nSUMMIT SCHEDULE\n\nChicago Collections Crawl\n\nExplore the private collections of three prominent outsider art collectors in Chicago. Charter bus transportation, hors d’oeuvres, drinks and collector-led tour of each home included.\n\nLocation: Depart from/return to Ace Hotel Chicago, 311 N. Morgan Street, or return to Intuit, 756 N. Milwaukee Avenue\n\nEnvisioning Intuit’s New Façade, Design in Motion Workshop for Chicago Design Week\n\nSummit attendees are invited to participate in designing architectural elements for the façade of Intuit’s soon-to-be renovated museum building. Intuit’s building is a historic structure with a registered façade, thanks to the ornamental details of its stone window frames; however, some elements of its original façade are missing. Intuit will recreate the missing masonry, frieze and cornice using pieces designed collaboratively by members of its community and inspired by the art in its collection and by the stories of outsider artists—combining the classical with the other-ness of outsider art. Intuit invites outsider art enthusiasts to create drawings, clay models and wood carvings of “trimming” elements, which can later be reproduced and prototyped to be considered for the new façade, allowing Intuit to express some of the stories it has heard, the art-making it has witnessed and the power of the art exhibited in its interior.\n\nLocation: Intuit, 756 N.
