        "text": "Financial software company Intuit is laying off 1,800 workers across North America, many in San Diego, as it plans to invest more in artificial intelligence.\n\nAt the same time, the company said it plans to hire more workers next year that will bolster its AI-driven strategy.\n\nSan Diego houses one of Intuit’s best known services, TurboTax, its consumer income tax software. Intuit acquired San Diego’s TurboTax in 1993 for $225 million.\n\nIntuit is cutting 215 San Diego-based and remote jobs at 7535 Torrey Santa Fe Road. The local jobs will be eliminated beginning September 9 and continuing through next year, according to Intuit’s WARN notice filed with the state.\n\nIntuit owns the 11.2-acre campus located in the Del Mar Heights/Carmel Valley area, according to real estate tracker CoStar. The Mountain View, Calif.-based company bought the 466,000 square foot multi-building property for $262.3 million in 2016 from Kilroy Realty.\n\nIn a company-wide email on July 10, Intuit’s CEO Sasan Goodarzi said “this is truly an extraordinary time — AI is igniting global innovation at an incredible pace, transforming every industry and company in ways that were unimaginable just a few years ago. Companies that aren’t prepared to take advantage of this AI revolution will fall behind and, over time, will no longer exist.”\n\nHe continued that in order for Intuit to increase its investment in key growth areas, such as AI, company leaders have decided to terminate about 10 percent of Intuit’s workforce.\n\nLater in the letter, he explains that about 1,050 employees were let go for “not meeting expectations,” a number of executive roles were eliminated and about 80 technology roles were consolidated to a few select sites.\n\n“We do not do layoffs to cut costs, and that remains true in this case,” Goodarzi said. “The changes we are making today enable us to allocate additional investments to our most critical areas to support our customers and drive growth.”\n\nLaid off employees will receive at least 16 weeks of pay, six months of health insurance and job transition assistance, the letter says. The workforce reduction will cost Intuit $250 million to $260 million during the fiscal fourth quarter, which ends this month.\n\nIn the letter, Goodarzi breaks down Intuit’s artificial intelligence strategy into “Big Bets” that aim to speed up the workflow of its products, use data to connect customers with the “right” financial experts and use AI to power its business focused services.\n\n“For example, (artificial intelligence) is helping experts with AI-supported answers and explanations, and matching and routing customers to the right expert at the right time, tailoring customer-specific needs to expert profiles and availability,” a company spokesperson said in an email.\n\nIntuit did not respond to the Union-Tribune’s questions Monday regarding what kind of roles were cut in San Diego and how many workers are based here.\n\nGoodarzi said that Intuit plans to increase its headcount next year to support its pivot to employing artificial intelligence in its products. Intuit plans to hire about 1,800 new workers “primarily in engineering, product, and customer facing roles such as sales, customer success, and marketing,” he said.\n\nIntuit employed about 18,200 employees globally, as of July 31, 2023.\n\nIn 2023, Intuit reported $14.4 billion in revenue and generated $2.4 billion in profits. The firm’s second largest revenue source was its consumer segment – based in San Diego – which contributed $4.1 billion.\n\nIn addition to layoffs, Intuit will close two sites in Boise, Idaho, and Edmonton, Canada."
