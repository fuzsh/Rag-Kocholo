        "text": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Gold medalists Michael Phelps and Simone Biles will lead a lineup of inspiring main stage speakers at Intuit Inc.’s QuickBooks Connect event, taking place Oct. 24-26 in San Jose, Calif. Intuit (Nasdaq:INTU) made the announcement on the heels of their historic performances.\n\n“We are proud to celebrate and learn from the success of Michael Phelps and Simone Biles fresh off their recent victories,” said Brad Smith, Intuit chairman and chief executive officer. “They have achieved their dreams and reached the pinnacle of their professions through commitment, determination and perseverance. Their stories will inspire thousands of small business owners, accountants, self-employed individuals and developers who will gather at QuickBooks Connect this year.”\n\nPhelps – who will headline on Tuesday, Oct. 25 – is the most decorated athlete of all time with 28 medals, while Biles – who will speak on Wednesday, Oct. 26 – is the most decorated American gymnast of all time.\n\nKnown worldwide as a successful self-starter, Phelps’ honors include receiving the Laureus Exceptional Achievement Award, being a nine-time ESPY Award winner and a two-time Associated Press Athlete of the Year.\n\nIn addition to his athletic achievements, he started the Michael Phelps Foundation, which encourages children to lead healthy, active lives and to continue to grow the sport of swimming. He launched the Michael Phelps Swim School in his hometown of Baltimore, Md., to provide swim instruction for all ages and abilities, centered on building comfort and confidence in the water. He also established Michael Phelps Swimming, which offers its proprietary methodology at partnering swim schools across the country. His book, “No Limits,” was a New York Times and USA Today bestseller.\n\nBecause of his commitment to youth, Phelps has been honored as a Boys & Girls Clubs of America Champion of Youth and is an honorary board member of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Harford, Md.\n\nBiles is the first woman gymnast to win three consecutive all-around titles at the world championships and holds the most gold medals of any female gymnast in history. She recently captivated the world as the gold medalist in the women’s individual and team all-around events, as well as in the floor exercise and vault.\n\nShe has emerged as one of the youngest, most powerful gymnasts in the sport – who has earned the distinct honor of a signature move, “The Biles” – known for her journey of overcoming adversity in her early years combined with her tendency to bring lightheartedness to the competition floor. Biles has been recognized as one of Time magazine’s Next Generation Leaders for 2016 and the Women’s Sports Foundation’s Sportswoman of the Year for 2015.\n\nRegistration Details\n\nA two-day QuickBooks Connect pass is available for $299, while a full, three-day pass for accountants is available for $599.
