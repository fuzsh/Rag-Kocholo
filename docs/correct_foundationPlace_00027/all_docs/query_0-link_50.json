        "text": "Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nWith early polling results showing a likely path to victory at the ballot box, the city is planning to put a revenue measure up for voter approval this November to help fund some of its biggest projects.\n\nA new public safety building, transportation improvements and climate change mitigations are just a few of the top priorities the city is looking to fund in the upcoming years.\n\nIn a unanimous vote on Tuesday, May 14, the City Council settled on pursuing a property transfer tax, after polling results showed it would be the most likely revenue measure to win voter approval on the November 5 ballot. Council members Ellen Kamei and Alison Hicks were absent from the council meeting.\n\nWhile council members agreed on moving forward with the property transfer tax, it was not necessarily their first choice – at least when they first started exploring the possibility of putting a revenue measure on the ballot last year.\n\n“I definitely went into it thinking we would be doing something different than what we’re recommending here tonight, and it’s primarily based on the polling and the information we got from the community,” Council member Lisa Matichak said.\n\nThe city adopted a property transfer tax in 1973, which was set at $3.30 per $1,000, and has not increased the rate since then. If approved, the revenue measure would raise the tax of residential and commercial property sales of more than $5 million, up to $15 per $1,000, according to the council report.\n\nThis would generate about $9.5 million in additional annual revenue, Assistant City Manager Arn Andrews said. The vast majority of the revenue would come from the tax on commercial properties, he added.\n\nThe council largely agreed on the “escalator” tax, while also suggesting the possibility of creating an index to keep up with inflation in home values over time.\n\nBut Council member Margaret Abe-Koga had some qualms and wanted to raise the cap on the property transfer tax to $6 million, citing the increasing value of homes in Mountain View where $5 million sales were not uncommon anymore, she said. Council member Lucas Ramirez pushed back on the proposal, stating that $5 million was a good starting point to tax properties at a higher rate.\n\n“The additional taxes, it’s non-trivial, it’s very valuable for the city. But in terms of the total value of the property, it doesn’t feel like it’s going to be the difference maker,” he said, referring to the sale of a $5 million home.\n\nJessica Polsky-Sanchez, a consultant from EMC Research, also cautioned that any changes to the revenue measure, like adding a higher cap, would invalidate the results of a poll that the city conducted in March, which showed that 63% of the respondents were in favor of a property transfer tax.\n\nThe proposed revenue measure polled much higher than the alternative – a transient occupancy tax (TOT) on hotel stays that barely squeaked by with 53% of respondents in favor. The results surprised council members who all supported the idea of a hotel tax when it was suggested as a possible revenue measure last year.\n\nStill in favor of it, Abe-Koga wanted to keep the hotel tax as an option in case there was a strong opposition campaign mounted against a property transfer tax. There typically is not a lot of opposition to hotel taxes because business travelers’ companies usually pay for the lodging, Abe-Koga said, adding that the public might have misunderstood how these taxes are applied.\n\nThe consultants, however, did not recommend the hotel tax based on the polling results, according to Andrews. “They also shared with us that they have seen over the years a consistent degradation in TOTs that could be a factor of … COVID and what happened to the industry,” he said.\n\nHotel stays plummeted during the pandemic, and were slow to recover following the lockdown. The results could suggest that voters are concerned hotels are still struggling post-pandemic and would be hit hard by a tax increase.\n\nCity Manager Kimbra McCarthy added that a hotel tax could be something to consider in the future, possibly on the 2026 ballot.\n\nMcCarthy also highlighted the overall positive results of the poll findings, which indicated that a large majority of voters were satisfied with the level of services and financial management of the city.\n\n“The job that we are doing is significantly higher than what other cities have shown … Generally, what we’re seeing is in the 40% range, and ours is in the 70% almost 80%, and that’s after COVID, after the change in public rhetoric, civility, all of that,” she said.\n\nEven so, respondents were evenly split on whether the city has a need for additional funding, according to the council report.\n\nRespondents ranked public safety response, fixing potholes and addressing homelessness as top priorities. Adding local parks was much lower down on the list, surprising some council members.\n\n“If you’re in an area where there are a lot of parks, you’re fine. But if you’re in an area where there aren’t a lot of parks, then it’s incredibly important to you. And so, I feel like it’s very important to me and a lot of other people, and I don’t want to lose that even though in the polling, it was ranked quite low,” Matichak said.\n\nThe city plans to reach out to the community and other stakeholders for more input before June 25, which is when the revenue measure will come before the council for adoption. The June meeting also will include recommendations about funding priorities, based on community responses, Andrews said."
