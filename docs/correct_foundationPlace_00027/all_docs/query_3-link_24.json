        "text": "Donkeys, elephants, and& angels? While the Democrats and Republicans prepare for the upcoming election, Quicken'sÂ® Financial Angels are preparing for their own. So who are the Quicken Financial Angels? They are celebrities who have generously donated their original angel artwork to Quicken Financial Angels 2000 to help raise money for the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, the nation's leading catalyst in the fight against breast cancer.\n\nIntuit Inc.'s (NASDAQ: INTU) Quicken product family, the leader in electronic personal finance management, is inviting Americans to pick their favorite artwork donated by this year's Quicken Financial Angels. From August 17th to August 30th, the public can view the artwork - and vote on their favorite masterpiece - by visiting http://www.quicken.com/angel. The winning artwork will grace the cover of the card that holds the Quicken Financial Angels 2000 Dollar Bill - a real dollar bill with an engraved angel sticker in place of George Washington - that will be sold for $3.50 during National Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October.\n\nThis year's Quicken Financial Angels include: David Arquette, Roma Downey, Fran Drescher, John Edwards, Joely Fisher, Kathy Ireland, Linda Lavin, Eric McCormack, Liza Minnelli, Megan Mullally, Caroline Rhea, and Jane Seymour.\n\nQuicken Financial Angels 2000 ends with a bang: a chance to bid on the original celebrity artwork. From October 2nd to October 13th, Quicken will auction the celebrity artwork on eBay. All proceeds of the auction, along with the sale of the dollar bills, will benefit the Komen Foundation, supporting breast cancer research and community outreach programs.\n\n\"We are extremely grateful to the celebrities who have generously donated their time and talent to Quicken Financial Angels 2000 and to the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation,\" said Carla Fried, managing editor of Quicken.com. \"We are proud to use this opportunity to honor the everyday - yet extraordinary - women in our lives, and to raise money to help eradicate this disease.\"\n\nCelebrities Create Original Artwork to Raise Money for Breast Cancer Research\n\nTo vote on the celebrity artwork, or for more information on the art auction on eBay and the sale of the dollar bills, please visit www.quicken.com/angel."
