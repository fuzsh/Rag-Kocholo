For well over a year now I have been patiently waiting for an American release of the 2010 U.K. film Inbred. The film has received a lot of bad reviews but the trailer looks amazing.

Sick of waiting I turned to youtube in hopes that someone uploaded the movie. I did not find the film but I did run across a short film called Chainsaw Scumfuck. This short was directed by the same director as Inbred in 1988. I bookmarked it and vowed to watch it later. After watching season 1 of Torchwood I decided to put off season 2 and watch a few more movies starting with this one.

**Spoiler Alert**The story for this one is simple. A group of twenty-somethings are inside of their home when a maniac with a hump on his back breaks in and kills them all in gruesome and violent ways.**Spoiler Alert**

I did not have much hope for this film but it was better than I expected, which is not saying much. This movie is definitely inspired by the 1974 classic The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. If chainsaw in the title was not enough to give that away then the mongoloid killer using a chainsaw and garden shears definitely will.

The acting is horrible and for most of the short I had a hard time hearing and comprehending what they were saying. The same can be said about the camera work and quality. As you can tell from the stills it was difficult to actually follow what is happening on screen because the quality was so poor. Finally, the special effects are horrible but the short does offer up a lot of on screen kills and gore. Gore hounds will get their fill with this six minute short. Overall, this is a low quality short that has potential but no execution. It is brutal as it is pointless. With a title like this I could tell you to stay away from it but curiosity will have it’s way.
