FUCK IS THIS? The world as we know it is gone. The why and how is subject to debate, but there are few left who have either the time or ability to wax philosophical about it. All that’s left is an extremely dangerous place, which, depending upon your point\n\nTONE Now, you might notice that the tone here is a bit different from other Schwalb Entertainment offerings. In PunkApocalyptic, we’re not shy about using words like fuck, shit, bastard—a lot, in fact—and a whole bunch of other nastiness to properly convey the mood and tone of a world gone to hell. This game’s setting is intended for folks who comfortably spew foul language, in places where said spewing won’t earn you a rash of angry glares and teeth-gnashing from a bunch of uptight assholes, or the loud and frightened bawling of their rotten-ass crotchspawn. In short, be aware of your surroundings and make sure the fuckers you’re playing with are on board with the game’s tone in advance. If not, you can always dial back the nastiness or, better yet, just find cooler people to play with.\n\n4\n\nof view, is either a reeking open sewer, a radioactive shithole rife with wasting disease and lingering death, or a desperate place of hunger and want where anyone will trade anything or kill anybody just to survive one more day. Actually, your point of view doesn’t matter. It’s all these things. And so much worse. Deadly and violent, much of the world has become a deserted, barren land dotted with the remnants of whatever came before. The Wasteland, as it’s called, though, is not as empty as it might seem. Here live the wretched descendants of the undesirables, the impoverished, the castoffs, and every other asshole deemed unsuitable for entry into the great and mythical Megalopoli: fabulous domed cities built during civilization’s collapse that became more myth than reality to most of the rugged shitkickers trying to scratch out a living in the Wasteland. Oh, yeah… the mutants live here too—but we’ll talk about them later. So, unless you’re among the privileged few living in one of ‘em—and, trust me, you’re not—you’re pretty much fucked\n\nINTRODUCTION: WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?\n\nand have to figure out some way to survive in some of the worst places you can imagine, alongside all the other poor dumb bastards who will just as soon tear out your throat to get their mitts on your rusty can of beets as give you the time of day. Not that anyone has a working watch or really gives a shit what time it is. Beets, though? That’s another fucking story. But as unpleasant as the world has become, opportunity abounds for anyone who has the grit, determination, and moral flexibility to stay alive and maybe even thrive—well, at least compared to the other slags around you. In the Wasteland, resources are quite scarce. Electricity is nearly nonexistent, as are those who know how to build or even repair complex devices. Therefore, just about everything has been reduced to the most basic of items, assembled from whatever can be dug up and salvaged out of old landfills, plundered from the ruined cities of the Time Before The Shit Hit, or simply robbed from some other weak, stupid bastards. Digging out salvage is no easy task as most ruins are overrun with dangerously deteriorated buildings, roving gangs, mutant abominations, murderous cannibals, or fanatic disciples with insane beliefs. When you’re offered a few bullets to put an end to a local warlord, some fuel to fill up the car you’ve kept running with bubblegum, duct tape, and hope, odds are you won’t have much choice other than to take the job. As tough as things are in the Wasteland, one can still find small settlements, often fortified, which somehow manage to survive the never-ending hardship. Some outposts serve as commercial hubs, while others represent the best chance for the weak and feeble to survive. Some settlements have greenhouses and water collectors for growing crops and supplying clean water, while many host murderous gangs who trade only in bullets instead of goods and foodstuffs that would make life more livable. Go figure. Then there are roving hermits who collect odd pieces of useful junk and technology, or bands of mystic nomads in search of some arcane “truth” that often involves blood sacrifice (usually yours and that of your fellow mercs), or the odd religious cult dedicated to bizarre gods of their own invention, bent on forceful conversion of any who they meet (again, usually you and your fellow mercs). Anything and everything is possible in the Wasteland and you’re bound to discover something truly strange that would shock even your seriously desensitized and cynical worldview before you punch your ticket at the end of the miserable fucking merry-go-round you’ve ridden in this world of shit. Happy trails, motherfucker. You go to a better place.\n\nMERCENARIES\n\nIn PunkApocalyptic: The RPG, you and your friends take on the roles of mercenaries, aka “mercs” (pronounced “merk,” hard c), people who travel across the Wasteland selling their unique\n\nCHARACTER SHEETS On www.schwalbentertainment.com, you’ll find a downloadable character sheet that you can print. Or, you can make up your own sheet. It’s good to have a hard copy of the sheet so you can easily make notes.\n\ntalents and capabilities. What do you get in return for risking your lives? Bullets, food, water, meds, fuel, and salvage, all of which form the ad hoc mish-mash economy of this brutal world. Maybe even some free hooch at the local bar and a quick lay in a settlement particularly grateful for your help. Hey, sometimes it’s good to be a merc! As you play this game, you’ll have opportunities to explore old ruins, discover strange places and even stranger people, dicker and bargain for bullets and salvage, interrogate prisoners, and fight for your lives. Sometimes all in the same day! Each mission your team undertakes leads you into new dangers, challenges, and opportunities to make names for yourselves in the Wasteland. Sure, some of you are gonna die, but hey, nobody lives forever, and there’s always a new sucker out there ready to take the place of the fallen.\n\nTHE GAME MASTER One of you takes on the role of Gamemaster (aka “the GM”). The GM has the most important job in the game, acting as both narrator and rules arbiter. The GM decides what obstacles must be overcome, shapes and creates the missions you undertake, and keeps the story moving. Most importantly, the GM, through common sense and knowledge of the rules, decides what does or does not happen, or what could happen with a bit of luck, based on the roll of the dice.\n\nTHE RULES PunkApocalyptic: The Roleplaying Game uses a loose ruleset to sort out what happens when outcomes aren’t clear, to describe how characters grow more powerful as they complete missions, and to ensure that missions are challenging and fun. As important as the rules are, they simply exist to supplement play rather than direct it. Sometimes you’ll need to use rules to figure out a tricky situation. Most of the time, though, the GM will let the story take care of the hard work.\n\n5\n\nINTRODUCTION: WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?\n\nQuickstart\n\nDICE\n\nYou need at least one set of dice to play this game. A set includes a die with twenty sides (d20) and at least three dice with six sides (d6). You can also use a dice-rolling app for whatever mobile device you happen to have, many of which are free. To be honest, though, there’s nothing like the clatter of the bones hitting the table to provide that satisfying (or totally fucked-up) result. Who has a working mobile device in the Wasteland anyway? The rules use a familiar shorthand expression for dice rolls, which employs the xdy + z format. X represents the number of dice you roll. Y tells you the die or dice size. Z is the number you add to the roll. So, if you see 1d6 + 2, this tells you to roll one six-sided die and add 2 to the number rolled. Similarly, if you see 1d20 + 5, roll a twenty-sided die and add 5 to the number you rolled.\n\nFUNDAMENTALS\n\nThere are some fundamental concepts to keep in mind when you play this game.\n\nSPECIFIC BEATS GENERAL Much of this book contains broad, general rules that tell you how to play and how to resolve certain activities that might come up. There are also game elements called talents that allow you to sometimes bend or even break the rules. In such cases, the exception or specific case described by the talent wins out over the general rule.\n\nROUND DOWN Whenever you end up with a fraction, such as from halving damage, always round down to the next lowest whole number.\n\nEXAMPLE OF PLAY In this example, a group of players—Andrew, Joanie, Erik, Candy, and Toye—come together to play in a game. Chris is their GM. The team has taken on a gig with a local warlord who wants them to follow up on stories about suspicious types wandering around a nearby ruin. The team climbs onto their motorcycles and speeds off to the ruin, arriving there just before dark—probably not a good move on their part, but they’re feeling badass enough to handle whatever.\n\nChris (as GM): A jumble of old houses stands before you, most missing walls and roofs, but a few structures appear intact. There’s dust everywhere, having blown in during the last storm. You might startle when you hear a broken streetlamp creak and screech as the wind blows hard enough to make the cracked arm sway. What do you do?\n\n6\n\nJoanie (as Ladybird, a scoundrel): Y’all, this place don’t look all that great. We’d better be ready for anything. I’m pulling out my baseball bat from the sheath on my bike and keeping watch. Andrew (as Meatfucker, a killer): Good idea, Ladybird. I’m pulling out my hatchets and will move ahead a bit to see if I spot anyone. Toye (as Randy, a freak): I’ll come with. I’m ready to cut up the first fucker I see with my claws. Erik (as Christmas, a junker): I power up my electro-suit and spark the rod. Candy (as Roadrage, another killer): Heh, is that euphemistic, Erik? OK, I’ll cover Meatfucker and Randy with my rifle. Chris: OK. Sounds good. Meatfucker, you lead the way, Randy following behind. How far do you want to range ahead? Andrew: Let’s say no more than 20 yards and definitely not to a spot where we and the team can’t see each other. Cool, Randy? Toye: Fine with me. Chris: You head a few paces away from the team, moving between two old houses, the final siding heaped up on the ground around them. You think you hear something, however. Uhhh… yeah… so, Randy, Meatfucker, since you’re closer in, give me an Eyes roll. Toye: (Rolling a d20) I got a 15. Andrew: (Also rolls a d20) Fuck me! An 8. I don’t see or hear shit. Chris: Great. Randy, you hear crunching footsteps coming from your right and see that the sound comes from a big hulking abomination, all mutated and shit, and carrying a blood stained yield sign. Andrew: Did you say big? Chris: Yep. And hulking. And abomination. Joanie: Shit. Mutants. I fucking hate those guys. Toye: OK, I shout out a warning to Meatfucker. How many of them do I see? Chris: You see a second one moving behind to join the first, but it will take some time before it gets here. OK, we’re moving into combat rounds. Here we go! Who wants to take a Fast turn? Candy: Can I see them yet? Chris: Not yet. Candy: Damnit. I guess I’ll wait then. Andrew: Fuck this shit. I charge the asshole. Chris: Roll! Andrew: Does a 12 against their Defense hit? Chris: Yep. All day long. Damage? Andrew: Ah, another 12. Take that, asshole! Chris: Anyone else? Toye: Damnit. I’ll go. I charge too. Shit, a 5. Chris: Ugh. Whiff! Bad time for that, pal. OK. At closer range, you can see they’re pit beasts. The first one takes a Fast turn. The other will act on Slow. Oddly enough, the pit beast is now pretty fucking hostile thanks to your last hit. Does a 12 hit your Defense? Andrew: Fuck. Yeah. Chris: Sorry. Sucks to be you. OK. The pit beast chops into you with its yield sign for… 11 damage. Andrew: Holy shit! Come on, guys! Get your asses in gear! We need some fucking help! And as the sun goes down, several pairs of glowing red eyes can be seen deeper in the ruin, and it just gets even more interesting for our crew from there...\n\nCHAPTER 1: MAKING A MERC\n\nQuickstart\n\nMAKING A MERC In the Wasteland, you’re either predator or prey. Predators see the collapse of civilization as a license to do whatever they want. Among their ranks can be found power-mad warlords leading gangs to plunder salvage, bullets, and other supplies from the landscape; vicious tyrants who enslave the survivors and force them to mine deadly landfills; bizarre cults, mutant mobs, unhinged V Reichers; and so many more, all of whom, if given the chance, will reshape the world in their own distorted image. The prey? Well, that’s just about everyone else: the innocent men and women fucked over by the greed of the plutocrats who built the massive Megalopoli and then excluded all but a privileged few; roving nomads; and settlements that barely manage to survive by scratching at the scorched earth in the hope of getting soybeans or other hardy edibles to grow. Nearly all of these people just want to live without trouble, to rebuild enough of what was destroyed to make their lives just a bit easier, and, maybe, just maybe, make the world a little bit better for the poor bastards who will come along after them. In PunkApocalyptic: the RPG, you play a merc, someone who lives by your abilities, selling your services to whoever can afford you. You might find yourself moved by the plight of the pathetic wretches struggling in the Wasteland and\n\ntake up arms to protect them from their persecutors. Or, you could be a lowdown piece of shit yourself, hiring on with one of the fucking megalomaniacs who want nothing more than to rule their own little patch of the world, which usually involves persecuting and exploiting the aforementioned pathetic wretches. Most likely, you’re going to take whatever work you can find, because the world is a harsh and unforgiving place where no one gives two shits for doing what’s right anymore. Maybe you’re different, maybe you’re not. Whether or not you catch a bullet in the head or heart is the only judgment you’re gonna get here on that one, friend… This chapter shows you how to make a merc. The process is simple as fuck. You make a few basic decisions, roll some dice, and then write down information on your character sheet. Now, it bears mentioning that as a starting character, you’re as fragile as a fucking robin’s egg. Your first mission is going to be nasty and the odds of you surviving it are slim. Them’s the breaks. But, hey, it’s cool, because your surviving teammates will find some other asshole to take your place. So if you die, no biggie. Just whip up another character and you’re ready to go… and maybe someone else’s character will bite the big one next mission.\n\n7\n\nCHAPTER 1: MAKING A MERC\n\nQuickstart\n\nWelcome to the fantabulous and exciting world of PunkApocalyptic, meatbag! Enjoy the ride while you can. Creating a merc involves following a few steps, including recording the results of your dice rolls along with whatever design choices you make for the merc’s background, on your character sheet. You’ll find a nifty, cool character sheet at the back of this book, which you can copy or download from the website at SchwalbEntertainment.com. You don’t have to use the character sheet though; you can just scratch everything down on a torn piece of paper with a golf pencil, if that’s your thing. It’s simple enough that it doesn’t really matter how you do it. Just make sure you have everything written down where you can quickly refer to it in play. Don’t be that asshole who slows shit down by not being ready or can’t seem to find his shit. Nobody likes that asshole.\n\nSTEP 1: ATTRIBUTES\n\nThe first thing you need to do is gin up your attribute scores. Attributes represent your most basic capabilities, which include Muscles, Meat, Hands, Feet, Brains, Eyes, Mouth, and Guts. For each attribute, you have a score. An attribute score is a number between 1 and 20, with 10 being the average. You can come up with your scores in one of two ways. You can either go with Assigned Scores or Random Scores. If you\n\nassign scores, you’re gonna be good at some things and bad at others. If you randomly determine them, who the fuck knows what you’ll end up with? Live dangerously. What could possibly go wrong? Once you choose, just jot down the numbers. Your background, which you choose in step 2, will increase one of these attributes by 1.\n\nASSIGNED SCORES If you choose this option, you have the following pre-generated scores: 13, 12, 12, 11, 10, 10, 10, and 9. Assign one score to each attribute until you’ve assigned all eight. If you want, you can raise up to two different scores by one each, but for each score you raise by one, you must lower a different score by one. Savvy?\n\nRANDOM SCORES Feeling lucky? Sure you are! Random scores give you a chance at getting higher than normal scores at the risk of getting somewhat lower ones. Bell curves can be a bitch, dude. To generate your scores, roll 4d6 eight times, dropping the lowest number rolled each time, and write down the total result of each roll. Match the total result of each roll on the following table and jot down the score. Once you have all eight scores, assign one to whichever attribute you wish until all eight are assigned. You don’t have the option here to adjust your scores with Assigned Scores.\n\nRANDOM SCORES ATTRIBUTE SUMMARY Each attribute represents a different aspect of your character’s capabilities. Muscles represents physical strength and athleticism. You use Muscles to attack with handheld or melee weapons. Meat combines overall durability with healthiness. You use Meat to determine how much physical damage you can take. Hands measures equilibrium, balance, poise, and precision. You use Hands to attack with guns, bows, and other projectile weapons, as well as to do stuff that requires manual dexterity. Feet represents speed, mobility, and the ability to evade danger. You use Feet to avoid being hit by attacks. Brains describes wit, intelligence, logic, and education. You use Brains to figure out stuff, use technology, and to overcome challenges that require smart thinking. Eyes represents sensory acuity and awareness. Although it says eyes, it means all five damned senses (sight, smell, hearing, taste, and touch). You use Eyes to notice stuff and sense the world around you. Mouth represents the strength of your personality, natural charm, and magnetism. You use Mouth in diplomacy, negotiation, seduction, and other social situations. Guts combines determination, courage, discipline, and willpower. You typically use Guts to keep your shit together when the situation goes pear-shaped…and it always goes pear-shaped, friendo.\n\n8\n\nRoll\n\nScore\n\n18\n\n13\n\n16–17\n\n12\n\n13–15\n\n11\n\n9–12\n\n10\n\n6–8\n\n9\n\n4–5\n\n8\n\n3\n\n7\n\nSTEP 2: BACKGROUND Your character is a person who lives or has lived in the Wasteland and has some kind of history prior to becoming a merc. Your character’s background describes his or her identity as well as how he or she fits into the world. In addition, your background gives you some cool shit. Attributes: Your background increases one of your eight attributes by the amount indicated. Language: Your background tells you how many languages you know how to speak. You can choose any language that people speak today such as English, Spanish, German, or Greek.\n\nCHAPTER 1: MAKING A MERC\n\nQuickstart\n\nBut don’t be a dumbass. If you choose a language not spoken in the area you haunt, no one’s gonna know what the fuck you’re saying, will they? Now, also, most folks in the Wasteland don’t know how to read, so don’t fret if your character is illiterate. If your background doesn’t specify that you can read, there’s a chance you can. Roll a d6 for each language you know how to speak: on a 5 or 6, you know how to read and write in that language. Talent: Your background gives you at least one talent. Talents are cool things your character knows how to do. Note how the talent works on your sheet. Starting Gear: Your background provides you with your gear: equipment and other stuff you begin the game with. You also get at least one random piece of junk. See below for details. For more info on gear, check out Chapter 4. Mission 4 Benefits: Finally, your talent gives you a few extra benefits when you complete your fourth mission. Assuming you make it that far—a far fucking stretch at best— your character will get these benefits.\n\nBRUTE You’ve survived just by being one of the strongest fuckers around. Big, hunky, and musclebound, you’ve plenty of might and no hesitation about using it, whether for right or no. You might have worked as a pit fighter for the entertainment of crowds, served as a warlord’s guard, or simply took what you wanted from people weaker than you just because you could.\n\nBRUTE BACKGROUNDS d6\n\nBackground\n\n1\n\nYou strangled someone with your bare hands, who may or may not have deserved it. This made you unwelcome in your home community, forcing you to move on to find somewhere else to live.\n\n2\n\nA mad scientist captured you and pumped you full of steroids. You got bigger and stronger, but now you have a hair-trigger temper and seriously nasty acne.\n\n3\n\nYou roughed up the locals to get what you wanted. Eventually, they brought in a couple of mercs tougher than you to take you out. You ran for your life and have been on the go ever since. Someday you’re going back to that shithole to get payback.\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nYou can’t always gauge your own strength. The last time you got in a nasty fight, you hit someone so hard they never got up again. When the locals started hunting for a rope to string you up, that was your cue to leave. You served as a guard for a powerful warlord. After saving that asshole’s life from an assassin, he gave you your freedom. As soon as you left to seek your own fortune, he had you ambushed outside of town, and you were left for dead. You protected a community for many years, using your brawn to beat down the raiders and gangers who troubled them. Eventually, someone stronger than you came along and picked a fight. You survived, but your community didn’t. You’ve been hunting those fuckers down ever since.\n\nAttributes: Increase your Muscles score by 1. Language: You speak one language of your choice. Brawn: You can push yourself to perform feats of strength. When you roll Muscles, you can use this talent to make the roll with 2 assets. Once you use this talent, you must wait 6 rounds before you can use it again. Starting Gear: You start off with torn and tattered clothing, a big-ass wrench or a hammer, a backpack, 1 food, 1 water, and a random piece of junk.\n\nMISSION 4 BENEFITS When you complete your fourth mission, you gain the following benefits. Health: Increase by 5. Brutal Strike: You can land punishing blows. When you use Brawn on a Muscles roll to attack with a melee weapon and you succeed on the roll, the attack deals 3 extra damage.\n\nDRIFTER You’ve travelled far and wide across the Wasteland, but even after all this time, you’ve still not seen it all. You find it hard to stay in one place for long. The road always calls you back. So, you don’t put down roots and you sure as hell haven’t made any last arrangements. Of course, this could change if you meet the right people, but so far that hasn’t happened.\n\nDRIFTER BACKGROUNDS d6\n\nBackground\n\n1\n\nYou move around a lot because someone always winds up dead when you stay put for too long, usually because of you. You’ve got a lot of blood on your hands, whether justified or not.\n\n2\n\nSome truly rotten shitbirds murdered your spouse and child. After you killed them all, you started wandering the world to fill the emptiness inside you.\n\n3\n\nYou think there’s some promised land out there somewhere, some place where the world still works. You’re hunting for it and won’t stop ‘til you find it.\n\n4\n\nYou’re tracking down someone who needs to die. They’ve slipped away from you a few times, but you’re sure you’re getting close and will never give up the chase.\n\n5\n\nSlavers, gangers, or someone else kidnapped someone you loved. You’re scouring the Wasteland to find them.\n\n6\n\nYou’re just a fucking hobo.\n\nAttributes: Increase your Feet score by 1. Language: You speak three languages of your choice. Fleet-Footed: When you take a fast turn, you can both move and use one action. Once you use this talent, you must wait at least 6 rounds before you can use it again. Starting Gear: You start off with some serviceable, patched clothing, a hooded cloak, a knife, backpack, canteen, 1 food, 1 water, and one random piece of junk.\n\n9\n\nCHAPTER 1: MAKING A MERC\n\nQuickstart\n\nMISSION 4 BENEFITS When you complete your fourth mission, you gain the following benefits. Health: Increase by 4. Seasoned Traveler: You gain a +1 bonus to Speed. You make rolls to avoid becoming lost with 1 asset. When you travel overland, everyone on your team who has a lower Speed moves as if they had the same Speed as you.\n\nFACE BACKGROUNDS d6 1\n\nSlick, cunning, and a real piece of shit, you always knew what to say to get what you wanted. You’ve probably destroyed a lot of lives in your time.\n\n2\n\nYou had the ear of your community leader and you counseled your friend in such a way as to improve your lot. People eventually got sick of your shit and drove you out. Tar and feathers might have been used.\n\n3\n\nYou were the spokesperson for a nasty warlord. You worked hard to find ways to justify the fucked-up shit the monster you represented did, and you have to live with that.\n\n4\n\nYou’ve never done an honest day’s work in your life. You always find a way to get your “friends” to do all the heavy lifting for you.\n\n5\n\nYou understood that people looked up to you and listened to you. You tried to lead your community to do more and be better. You made some progress, but mutants eventually overran your settlement and ate all your friends after you escaped.\n\n6\n\nYou are a gifted orator, storyteller, or performer, or you possess some other innate ability that compels you to get in front of people and hold their attention. You’re well-known in your community and people in other areas have started to hear about you too.\n\nFACE There’s something about you that other people like. You might have a trusting face, a quick wit, or a magnetic personality. Who the fuck knows?! The main thing is that you’re good at making friends and getting people to believe you, and sometimes even trust you. You can use your talent for good or you can be a real piece of shit and exploit the dumbasses too thick to see you for the charlatan narcissist you really are. Attributes: Increase your Mouth score by 1. Language: You speak three languages of your choice. Bullshitter: You can fill the air with the kind of bullshit that will distract your enemies—gets inside their head and fucks with their self-confidence. When a creature within 5 yards of you who can hear you would roll to hit, you can use a reaction to roll Mouth to hit the triggering creature’s Guts. On your success, the triggering creature makes its roll with 1 complication. On a failure, the triggering creature becomes immune to your use of this talent until it finishes a rest.\n\n10\n\nBackground\n\nCHAPTER 1: MAKING A MERC\n\nQuickstart\n\nStarting Gear: You start with a set of nice clothes, a knife, a bag, 1 food, 1 water, a bar of soap and washcloth, and a random piece of junk.\n\nStarting Gear: You start off with some tattered clothing, a hammer, a symbol of your faith or cause, a beat-up satchel, 1 food, 1 water, and a random piece of junk.\n\nMISSION 4 BENEFITS\n\nMISSION 4 BENEFITS\n\nWhen you complete your fourth mission, you gain the following benefits. Health: Increase by 3. Silver-Tongued Devil: In all diplomacy, negotiation, and social situations, you make rolls with 1 asset.\n\nWhen you complete your fourth mission, you gain the following benefits. Health: Increase by 5. Powerful Convictions: You revel in your certainty. When you use your Unshakeable Faith talent and succeed on the roll, you make attribute rolls with 1 asset for 1 round.\n\nFANATIC People might have given up their allegiances and beliefs when the world went to shit, but you still cling hard to what you think is important. You might be a religious fanatic, a patriot, or just committed to a cause you believe is greater than yourself. Whatever it is, it helps you get up every day, drives you, and gives you purpose to get shit done.\n\nFANATIC BACKGROUNDS d6\n\nBackground\n\n1\n\nYou have a personal god who talks in your head and tells you what to do. Sometimes the voice tells you to do good things and sometimes bad. You obey, because it’s FUCKING GOD talking!\n\n2\n\nYou belonged to a weird doomsday cult who either believed aliens would save you all, or some god was going to destroy the nonbelievers, or you and the other faithful would all be whisked away to heaven. Well, that shit didn’t happen, Chief, but you believe you have some great work left to do in order to regain the favor of whatever divine authority didn’t save you.\n\n3\n\n4\n\nGANGER People form gangs all the time, usually held together by the leadership of a charismatic and exceptionally tough fucker. Gangs might be vicious assholes who prey on the weak or noble sorts who follow some particular code of honor like protecting the weak or some shit like that—but usually it’s the former. Whatever the case, you found yourself in a gang and stayed with them for a while before you struck out on your own; because of this, you might have some bad blood with your old companions, in which case you’ll be spending a lot of time looking over your shoulder. Or, your gang could have fallen apart after having its ass kicked by mutants, the V Reich, or another, stronger gang. Whatever it is, you might be done with the past, but the past ain’t done with you, friendo.\n\nGANGER BACKGROUNDS d6\n\nBackground\n\n1\n\nAll this bad shit that’s going on is just a phase. Soon, your country is gonna make a comeback, kick ass, and re-establish its rightful fucking place in the world. USA! USA! USA!\n\nYou belonged to a nasty crew. You blazed a path of fire and death across the Wasteland until some other, better mercs finally took your crew down. You escaped, but you’ve got shit to answer for.\n\n2\n\nYou hate a particular group of people—mutants, gangers, or someone else of your choice. You believe these assholes are to blame for all the shit that’s gone wrong in the world. You’d kill ‘em all if you thought you could get away with it.\n\nYour gang leader was a right nasty piece of shit. You followed him years until one day he went too far. You up and killed that asshole and took off before his buddies could get hold of you. You know you’re dead meat if they ever find you.\n\n3\n\nYou were a member of good standing in your gang, but when shit went sideways you ran. You know that if they ever catch you, they’ll drag out your demise in an extremely hard and ugly way.\n\n4\n\nYou were the leader of a small gang until some young upstart challenged you for leadership. He or she stuck you in the belly, left you for dead, and took the gang with them. You might be pissed enough about this to seek revenge.\n\n5\n\nYour gang tried to do the right thing when they could. They protected folks who needed protecting and never caused much trouble. One day, y’all got surprised and were wiped out by some real nasty fuckers, but you escaped.\n\n6\n\nYou got cut off from your gang and have been searching for them ever since. You suspect they’re dead and gone, but you’ve not yet given up hope.\n\n5\n\nYou belong to one of the new religions that have popped up in recent years. You’re a believer and you seek to spread the good news about your faith.\n\n6\n\nYou see injustice wherever you go. You’ve decided to commit your life to righting wrongs and protecting the innocent. The world’s gonna keep your schedule book pretty full.\n\nAttributes: Increase your Guts score by 1. Language: You speak one language of your choice. Unshakeable Faith: Your faith helps get you through the worst shit. When you fail a roll, you can use this talent to repeat the roll. If you fail again, you become insane for 1 round.

Language: You speak one language of your choice.\n\n11\n\nCHAPTER 1: MAKING A MERC\n\nQuickstart\n\nGang-Up: You know how to fight as part of a team.

Starting Gear: You start off with a jacket that shows your gang colors, patched and dirty clothing, a knife or chain, backpack, 1 food, 1 water, and a random piece of junk.\n\nMISSION 4 BENEFITS When you complete your fourth mission, you gain the following benefits. Health: Increase by 4. Threatening: You talk the talk. You make Mouth rolls to intimidate with 1 asset.\n\nGENIUS You’re something of an anomaly. Most of the smart folks wound up in one of the Megalopoli, but not you. Somehow you got stuck in the Wasteland along with everyone else, and with a head full of knowledge, useful or useless depending on where you are at the time. Your smarts mean you can figure out problems, remember useful details, and generally be the most brilliant asshole around.\n\nMISSION 4 BENEFITS When you complete your fourth mission, you gain the following benefits. Health: Increase by 3. Know-It-All: You make Brains rolls with 1 asset. In addition, when you would make a roll using another attribute, you can make the roll using your Brains. Once you use this talent, you must wait 6 rounds before you can use it again.\n\nSCAVENGER The Wasteland might seem empty and shitty—because for the most part, it is—but for those who know where to look, it holds all kinds of treasures. You’ve made a life for yourself finding usuable shit, from guns and bullets to food and meds in order to keep you and those you care about from turning into mutant wastoids. You have a knack for finding useful stuff in places others would overlook.\n\nSCAVENGER BACKGROUNDS d6 1\n\nAlways nosy, you discovered a secret that got a lot of people killed when it was revealed. You hope no one will figure that shit out.\n\nBackground\n\n2\n\nYou stole something of value from someone who really needed it. You’re pretty sure that person is dead now. Fuck ‘em.\n\nYou used your genius for evil. You made a bomb, unleashed a plague, or introduced a poison into the water supply. You killed a fuck-ton of people and then decided to flee the scene. You’re mostly sure any survivors didn’t know about your role. Mostly.\n\n3\n\nYou once went rooting around in an old cave and came out with a weird glowing rock. You lost it in your village. A few weeks later, everyone was dead. Oops.\n\n4\n\nYou grew up as a warlord’s slave. You learned how to scavenge to keep yourself fed.\n\n5\n\nYou took up with a junker band for a few months, working as a scout. You were good at wriggling into and through the tight places to get to the goods.\n\n6\n\nA friend was about to be hanged for theft, but you found the “stolen” goods and saved his or her life. Good job!\n\nGENIUS BACKGROUNDS d6 1\n\n2\n\nYou worked for the V Reich or a similar group, helping to create abominations for their cause. Your skills were highly valued, and they’re not happy that you left them.\n\n3\n\nYou used your mind for selfish ends. You used and manipulated a whole bunch of people into doing what you wanted them to do. Eventually, they wised up and ran you off.\n\n4\n\nYou want to build a doomsday weapon and use it against one of the Megalopoli. You’ve been drawing up plans in the hopes of one day getting the revenge you so desperately crave.\n\n5\n\nYou grieve for the loss of education and intelligence in the world. You see yourself as a teacher and hope to drag the Wasteland out of its present dark age.\n\n6\n\nYou have learned something of eminent importance to the people of the Wasteland. You might have a cure for a disease, a way to find clean water, or something else (up to you and the GM to figure out).\n\nAttributes: Increase your Brains score by 1. Language: You speak three languages of your choice. Well, Actually: When you use an action to help another creature, you increase the number of assets granted by 1. Starting Gear: You start off with a nice set of clothes, a duffel bag, 1 food, 1 water, a slingshot with 10 stones, and a random piece of junk.\n\n12\n\nBackground\n\nAttributes: Increase your Eyes score by 1. Language: You speak one language of your choice. Scrounge: You can usually find what you need. You can use an action to cast about for something useful. You can choose to find 1 bullet, 1 med, 1 food, 1 salvage, or one piece of gear worth 5 bullets or less. You can use this talent a number of times equal to your Eyes modifier (minimum once). You regain expended uses when you finish a rest. Starting Gear: You start off with tattered and patched clothing, a knife, a sack containing 1 food, 1 water, and 2 salvage.

You’ve found ways to deal with the hardships in this terrible world, managing to find clean water and edible food, all while avoiding the worst of the shit the Wasteland could throw at you. You can draw on your experiences to help you and your companions stay alive.\n\nSURVIVOR BACKGROUNDS d6 1\n\nBackground Everyone you knew and loved died horribly in an incident you’d rather forget. For whatever reason, you fled like a coward and the guilt and shame haunt you still. A reckoning’s a’coming someday, you know.\n\n2\n\nYou once slipped into a camp and stole all their food and good shit. You figure they might have starved to death, but it was you or them, right?\n\n3\n\nA bunch of mutants found and captured you. They dragged you off and made you their plaything, doing things…well, best left unsaid. You finally escaped with a bitter hatred for those fuckers, and you’re gonna find every one of ‘em and make them pay.\n\n4\n\nYou were exiled from your community after you did something bad. Despite being tossed out without any food or water, you found a way to survive.\n\n5\n\nYou were raised out in the Wasteland by a master survivor and learned everything you needed to learn to get by. After he or she died, you set out to make your own way through the blasted lands.\n\n6\n\nYou lived as a hermit for most of your life. When you saw a roving band of nasty gangers headed toward a nearby settlement, you helped the folk living there prepare in time for them to defend themselves. They’ve never forgotten— neither the grateful settlement nor the angry gangers— and your reputation often precedes you.\n\nAttributes: Increase your Meat score by 1.

You make Meat rolls to resist the effects of deprivation with 1 asset.\n\nJUNK From your identity, you gain at least one piece of junk that might or might not be useful. Junk is junk and so you can’t normally sell it for bullets or trade it unless you find someone who is super eager to get their hands on what you’ve got. Roll a d6 and a d20.

An attribute modifier is a number determined by the score. An attribute’s modifier equals its score minus 10. So, if you have 10 in Muscles, you have a +0 modifier. If you have a 12 in Brains, you have a +2 modifier. And if you have an 8 in Eyes, you have a –2 modifier. Easy-peasy. If your attribute score changes, your modifier changes by the same amount.\n\nDEFENSE You have a Defense score, a calculated number used when other assholes try to hit you with their weapons. Your Defense score equals half your Feet score + half your Eyes score (rounded down). Wearing armored clothing increases your Defense score. If your Feet or Eyes modifiers change, your Defense will as well. For more information on Defense, check out Chapter 2.\n\nHEALTH You have a Health score, which tells you the maximum amount of damage you can take before you drop. Your starting Health score equals your Meat score. If your Meat score changes, so does your Health score. Your Health score also increases because of the paths you choose as you complete missions, gain experience, and develop as a merc.\n\nGRIT You have a number of Grit points. You spend Grit points to heal damage. You might also lose Grit points from sickness, radiation, or if you’re dying. You start the game with a number of Grit points equal to 3 + your Guts modifier (minimum 1). If your Guts score changes, so too does your number of Grit points.\n\nEDUCATION Smart characters tend to know more about the world than most other dumbasses do. You have an amount of education equal to your Brains attribute modifier (minimum 0, no penalty here for being stupid). For each point of education, choose a language you can speak, read, and write, or, instead, some kind of specialty, chosen from the following options. Specialties are shit you know about, possibly as an expert... or at least as close to one as the Wasteland can manage. You can usually recall information related to a specialty you possess, though you might have to make a Brains roll to recall obscure information.\n\n15\n\nCHAPTER 1: MAKING A MERC\n\nQuickstart\n\nSPECIALTIES • Architecture and Engineering • Arts and Entertainment • Culture (Pre-apoc “High” or “Pop”) • History • Law and Politics • Literature • Mathematics/Mathemagics • Medicine • Philosophy and Religion • Psychology or Sociology • Science (Pick one or be a generalist) • Or, just make up something (Be creative!)\n\nSPEED You have a Speed score, which tells you how far you can move on your turn. Your Speed score equals half your Feet (rounded down, minimum 1). If your Feet score changes, your Speed also changes. See Chapter 2 for more information on speed.\n\nSIZE AND REACH You have a Size score and a Reach score. Your Size score, which is 1, describes the amount of horizontal space you take up in yards (1 yard = 3 feet). It does not account for your height. Your Reach score is how far you can reach outside of your space, which is also measured in yards.\n\nMUTAGEN Finally, you have a Mutagen score, which describes how much exposure you’ve suffered to seriously fucked-up environments such as radioactive areas, chemical spills, and biological hazards. To determine your starting mutagen, roll a d6. On a 6, you start the game with 1 mutagen and one minor, cosmetic mutation of your choice. Sucks to be you. Or maybe not… some folks get really turned on by mutations. You never know, right? And who knows what you might pick to cosmetically… ahem… enhance? No judgment here.\n\nMISSIONS You and other members of your team go on missions to find loot, fight bad guys, and explore the Wasteland. Keep track of the number of missions you complete. You usually start the game having no completed missions under your belt, so write a “0” (zero) in the space provided. Your GM might decide to start the game with the players having more powerful and experienced characters, in which case you might have completed 1 or more missions and you should indicate this number in the space provided. If you have completed at least 1 mission, head on over to the Advancement section in Completing Missions to develop your character further when you’re done with this chapter.\n\nSTEP 4: CHARACTER DETAILS OK. At this point, you have a character. Congrats! You’re ready to go. What’s that? These tables and all the rest of this shit following in this chapter? Well, a big chunk of it is intended to add detail to your character. Do you want to know what your merc looks like, how they behave, what he or she has experienced so far, and other nifty bits to help you immerse yourself in the game? That’s what these tables are for. Go through each, rolling or choosing your results. Or, skip the rolls, and just make some shit up—whatever makes you happy, sunshine. Everything’s going to get really ugly in your first mission, so you might as well enjoy yourself while you can. Live it up, asshole!\n\nTHE MIRROR NEVER LIES The first thing you should figure out is what your character looks like. You can be big or small, thin or chunky, with a mop of greasy hair, or clean-shaven. The following tables help you determine your approximate age, your looks, height, weight, distinguishing features, and stuff like that. What the tables don’t do is decide your gender and ethnicity. Play what you want, all up to you, pal.\n\nAGE Life is damned hard in the Wasteland and people just don’t live as long as they used to. Yeah, bad habits can cut a life short, but bullets, monsters, disease, radiation, and a slew of other nasty things will take someone out long before habitual drug or alcohol abuse will.\n\n16\n\nCHAPTER 1: MAKING A MERC\n\nQuickstart\n\nAGE 3d6\n\nYou’re…\n\n3\n\n…just a kid for Pete’s sake. Despite your few years, you have seen enough to know how to look after yourself. Reduce your Size to 1/2.\n\n4–5\n\n…a teen-ager, not quite an adult, but old enough to no longer be considered a kid. At this age, you know everything. Or at least you think you do, enough to be dangerous to yourself.\n\n6–8\n\n…a young adult, old enough by US standards to vote and, perhaps, drink legally, but young enough to believe you’re immortal, which still makes you dangerous to yourself.\n\n9–14\n\n…an adult. You’re old enough to know better, but young enough to avoid the aches and pains and horror that comes from growing old.\n\n15–16\n\n…getting on in years. Somehow, you’ve managed to live long enough to get a few gray hairs, a couple of wrinkles, and the aches and pains that come with advancing years.\n\n17\n\n18\n\n…old. You have no idea how it happened, but time caught up with you and has worn you down until natural causes have started making themselves known. And boy, does that suck. …goddamned ancient. You remember the world as it was before the Catastrophes and you look on the Wasteland with horror. You can’t believe you’ve lived this long, but you’re making the most of it for the time you have left. You know your time is near—make the best of it, you old piece o’ shit.\n\nLOOKS Most people count themselves lucky to get even one bath a year, and wondrous developments like skin care and dentistry haven’t been available for years. So, when it comes to looks, people tend to be grubby, smelly, and a bit beaten up. And that’s an understatement.\n\nLOOKS 3d6 3\n\nYou’re… …a goddamned monster. Revolting doesn’t quite do you justice when it comes to describing how you look. People become nervous around you, often look away, and generally avoid your company just in case their necks throw up too.\n\n4–5\n\n…ugly. You have a collection of physical features that puts people off. People tend to avoid you.\n\n6–8\n\n…not much to look at. Something’s off with you that makes you unappealing.\n\n9–12\n\n…normal. You’re just as dirty, scarred, and foul-smelling as anyone else.\n\n13–15\n\n…a looker. Something about you grabs the eye: having all your teeth, an oddly symmetrical face, or a shapely body free from weird bulges.\n\n3d6\n\nYou’re…\n\n16–17\n\n…hot. Clearly no one told you that being covered in shit and filth is the new black these days.\n\n18\n\n…smokin’ hot. People become flustered in your presence and resentful if you reject them. That you are this attractive makes no sense at all—it’s like everyone having straight white teeth in Braveheart. Oh well. Next table, please.\n\nHEIGHT Here, we find out how tall you are. The average height for men, according to some Wikipedia article (oh fuck off, we don’t care about academic veracity here, shithead!), is about 69 inches. For women, it’s 63 inches. Adjust as needed.\n\nHEIGHT 3d6 3\n\nYou’re… …really short. Reduce your Size to 1/2.\n\n4–5\n\n…short.\n\n6–8\n\n…a little shorter than average.\n\n9–12\n\n…of average height.\n\n13–15\n\n…a little taller than average.\n\n16–17\n\n…tall.\n\n18\n\n…really tall.\n\nWEIGHT Here, we find out how much you weigh. Go back and read height, above. The same sentiments apply here. Men of average height weigh about 170 pounds, while women of average height weigh about 120. Give or take. Adjust as needed.\n\nWEIGHT 3d6 3\n\nYou’re… …gaunt, practically skeletal\n\n4–5\n\n…skinny\n\n6–8\n\n…slender\n\n9–12\n\n…about average\n\n13–15\n\n…bulky\n\n16–17\n\n…heavy\n\n18\n\n…corpulent\n\nDISTINGUISHING FEATURES Distinguishing features include all the physical and behavioral qualities that make you memorable. You can make up your features, choose a few, or roll for as many as you like. You probably don’t need to roll more than four or five times.\n\n17\n\nCHAPTER 1: MAKING A MERC\n\nQuickstart DISTINGUISHING FEATURES\n\nd20\n\nYou…\n\n1–4\n\n…have something missing. Roll on the Missing Bits table.\n\n5–8\n\n…have a scar or tattoo. Roll on the Scars and Tattoos table, followed by the Scars and Tattoos Size table. If you have a tattoo, also roll on the Tattoo Quality table.\n\n9–12\n\n…have an unusual appearance. Roll on the Unusual Appearance table.\n\n13–16\n\n…a piercing. Roll on the Piercings table.\n\n17–20\n\n…have a twitch or tell. Roll on the Twitches and Tells table.\n\nMISSING BITS d20\n\nYou’re missing…\n\n1\n\n…an eye\n\n2\n\n…an ear\n\n3\n\n…your nose\n\n4–5\n\n…a foot\n\n6–9\n\n…a few toes\n\n10–13\n\n…a few fingers\n\n14–15\n\n…a hand\n\nd20 16\n\n…hand\n\n17\n\n…thigh\n\n18\n\n…calf\n\n19\n\n…foot\n\n20\n\n…junk\n\nSCAR OR TATTOO SIZE d6\n\nTattoo Size\n\n1\n\nTiny, covering no more than an eighth of the area\n\n2–3\n\nSmall, covering no more than a quarter of the area\n\n4–5\n\nMedium, covering about half the area\n\n6\n\nLarge enough to cover the entire area\n\nTATTOO QUALITY d6\n\nTattoo Quality\n\n1\n\nCrude, such as a blurred symbol or name.\n\n2\n\nEmbarrassing, offensive, or misspelled, such as “NO REGERTS!” or a swastika.

Use the tables or not.\n\nSOCIAL INTERACTION 3d6 3\n\nInteractions You’re a fucking weirdo. You stumble over your words, always say the wrong thing, and litter your conversation with insults, insinuations, and backhanded complements. You find it almost impossible to make friends and most people loathe you. Skip the Relationships roll as you have none, ya mook!\n\n4–5\n\nFolks find you unlikeable and unpleasant, a fucking chore to be around. You might be whiny, self-absorbed, irritating, or a pedantic asshole.\n\n6–8\n\nYou’re never really comfortable around other people. You tend to clam up and let the others do the talking. You might open up around people you like and trust or not. Fucking introvert.\n\n9–12\n\nYou get along with other people about as well as anyone else does. You’re not particularly outgoing but you’re not all quiet and reserved either.\n\n13–15\n\nYou’re outgoing, friendly, and personable. You find it easy to make friends and people like you. Fucking extrovert.\n\n16–17\n\nYou usually find yourself at the center of everything. Your personality is such that everyone wants to talk to you, get to know you, and hear what you have to say. You have charisma.\n\n18\n\nHoly fuck! Everyone loves you and people who don’t really fucking hate you. You’re the most popular person around and everyone knows you, wants to be like you, and wants to be your friend. Those who don’t really want to kill you. Watch out, friend.\n\nCONNECTIONS 3d6 3\n\nConnections You have no real friends. People are objects. Use them and discard them.\n\n4–5\n\nYou can’t have more than one close friend at a time.\n\n6–8\n\nYou have a few close friends. Everyone else is just someone you know.\n\n9–12\n\nYou know people, have several friends, including a few close relationships.\n\n13–15\n\nYou have lots of friends. Your connections are important to you and you make a lot of effort to maintain your relationships.\n\n16–17\n\nYou have numerous friends and most of them are important to you.\n\n18\n\nYou’re everyone’s friend.

Your word is worthless. You’ve never kept a promise and you have no plans to start anytime soon.\n\n4–5\n\nQuestion authority! You’re free and do what you want. Fuck the rules and anyone who thinks they can boss you around.\n\n6–8\n\nYou might keep your promises, but you might break them too. You look after what best serves you.\n\n9–12\n\nYou try to do what you say you will do, but you don’t always succeed.\n\n13–15\n\nYou keep your word for the most part and feel shame and frustration when you can’t.\n\n16–17\n\nEveryone has gone insane! The world has become chaos incarnate. The only way to salvage it is through strong leadership and commitment to order.\n\n18\n\nYour word is your life.

Nothing is worse than not following through.\n\nMORALITY 3d6 3\n\nMotivation\n\n1\n\nObligations\n\nMorality Among the worst of the worst, you have unspeakable desires and vile impulses that you act on whenever you can. No act is too gruesome, no craving too nasty for you not to indulge yourself. You are the embodiment of evil.\n\n4–5\n\nYou are selfish and petty. You never think twice about hurting others if it means getting ahead.\n\n6–8\n\nYou do what you feel you must. A pragmatist, the end always justifies the means.\n\nCHAPTER 1: MAKING A MERC\n\nQuickstart\n\n3d6\n\nMorality\n\n9–12\n\nYou’re neither good nor evil. You look after yourself and sometimes make sacrifices for people close to you.\n\n13–15\n\nYou know the difference between good and evil. Sometimes you slip and do something wrong, but you make amends when you can.\n\n16–17\n\nYou strive to make the world a better place and readily sacrifice to help others. You’re selfless in your dealings and most people find you good and wholesome.\n\n18\n\nInnocent, you have never had an evil thought and you have always striven to be good and upstanding in all your dealings with others. When you encounter evil, you fight it and you try to help those who have suffered as a result.\n\nWHAT’S YOUR NAME? The last thing you need to do is to come up with something to call yourself. Plenty of folks living in the Wasteland use the names we’re all familiar with, so if you want to be Max, Chris, Sam, Jenny, Heather, Jay, or Paul, go for it. No one’s going to call you an unimaginative fuck... well, maybe not to your face. People aren’t so concerned with last names, though you can have one of those too. Now all this said, many folks, being a little off in the head, adopt all kinds of nicknames, ranging from funny to offensive. Hell, people even name their towns weird things, so why not themselves? Below, you’ll find a list of 120 possible names. Pick one or roll dice to come up with a random one. Not enough for you? Then make up your own.

It presents you with some basic challenges and offers ways to overcome them. You might get in a fight, argue with a character portrayed by the GM, explore locations, find loot, and avoid danger. Or fucking ride straight into danger because you’re a badass. Through all these scenes, you use the rules to find out what happens.\n\n17\n\nSheriff\n\n18\n\nShithead\n\n19\n\nSin\n\n20\n\nSister\n\n1\n\nSlick\n\n2\n\nSpam\n\n3\n\nStranger\n\n4\n\nTater\n\n5\n\nThinker\n\n6\n\nToast\n\n7\n\nTongue\n\n8\n\nTumor\n\n9\n\nTuna\n\n10\n\nTwisted\n\n11\n\nTwitch\n\n12\n\nNOTE THE OUTCOMES\n\nVera\n\n13\n\nWarts\n\n14\n\nWeeper\n\n15\n\nWizard\n\n16\n\nWolf\n\n17\n\nXerxes\n\n18\n\nYak\n\n19\n\nZipper\n\n20\n\nZombie\n\nYou make decisions for your character in this game, but it’s a good idea to keep in mind how you actually got the things done that you did during the first mission. You can flesh out your character’s personality and background details as you play or make notes between missions. The decisions you make, and their outcomes, can help guide future choices as your character develops. If you spend a lot of time kicking the shit out of people, your character might go on to become a killer. If you drink some weird-ass substance and gain mutagen, you might become a freak. Then again, if you’re all hot and bothered by a broke-ass contraption you found you think you might be able to fix, maybe you’ll become a builder instead.\n\nYOUR FIRST MISSION Now that you have a character, you’re ready to go on your first mission, or what other RPGs call an “adventure.” The Gamemaster (GM) “runs” the mission, providing the basic plot, presenting its challenges, and keeping its story moving toward the conclusion. You and the rest of your group play characters who undertake the mission, try to complete it, and survive in the process. That last part is key, might want to remember that: “Survive!” Your first mission is important, and, during it, you should try to do all of the following things.\n\nMAKE DECISIONS This might seem obvious, but you’re going to have to make some decisions about what your character is going to do. Look, you might be nervous about how to play, and that’s fine, but don’t sit there staring at your character sheet like it’s written in some arcane language that will reveal ancient secrets to you if you stare hard enough. It isn’t and it won’t. Think about your character from what you know, or what you think would be cool to try, and decide what you’re going to do from that position. For example, some asshole ganger starts making lewd gestures at you and might even pull down his or her pants, with lascivious intent toward you, which they intend to act upon. What are you going to do? You can shoot them right in the junk, crack the wise, or just walk away. Or, maybe you give ‘em what they’re looking for because you’re a twisted fuck too. Just decide. There’s rarely a right way to do things, but there’s always something to do that’s more interesting than doing nothing. Nothing usually ends up with you on the wrong end of being dead.\n\nASSEMBLE THE TEAM Once you finish the first mission, your character, along with everyone else who survives, forms a team that will, most likely, go on more missions together. Since you’re going to be working with each other, you might as well get to know each other and figure out how and why you’re going to stick together.\n\nCOOPERATION You need to work together if you want to live. Look for ways to help the other players as you fight through the mission to\n\n23\n\nCHAPTER 1: MAKING A MERC\n\nQuickstart\n\nestablish stronger connections. Furthermore, listen to the other players and keep an open mind about the big decisions. The greater your cooperation, the better the odds you’ll live long enough to see the end of the campaign. (“Live long enough”... I can’t believe I wrote that with a straight face!)\n\nSTAY ALIVE Starting mercs are fragile and have few resources. Since a hit or two can knock you out or even kill you, be careful about getting into fights you know that you sure as fuck can’t win, i.e., running away is always a damn fine choice when the shit gets thicker than you can handle. But if you find yourself in a situation where fighting is the only option, don’t fuck around. Kill them a lot before they kill you. Don’t hesitate. Whoever hesitates dies, sure as shit, friendo.\n\nFIND SHIT Your starting equipment is unlikely to carry you far. You are absolutely going to need better armor, weapons, and supplies if you would survive in the Wasteland. You can upgrade your gear by taking on jobs for pay, looting bodies, and robbing your enemies. Get paid or steal what you need—that’s what this game is all about, Chief.\n\nCOMPLETE THE MISSION Every mission has an objective you must accomplish in order to complete it. Sometimes the GM will tell you the mission objective, and sometimes you have to figure it out along the way. Achieving your objective brings the story to its conclusion, so keep working toward it as you play. Once you complete the mission, you develop new capabilities based on the experiences you had. Coinciding with these new capabilities are increases to your Health and, sometimes, your attributes. Paths deliver all of these and more. After a certain number of missions, you can choose a path and gain its benefits. Chapter 3 tells you everything you need to know about character development.\n\n24\n\nCHAPTER 2: GAME RULES\n\nQuickstart\n\nGAME RULES This chapter covers all the rules you need to play this game. The main thing to remember is that this is a game focused on telling stories and you’re expected to use your imagination to make it work. Most of the time, what you want your character to do in the game simply happens without you having to refer to the rules at all. Your character might walk down a road, crack open a can of beets and start eating, or bed down inside of an old dumpster where they’ll be safe from the feral dogs sniffing around for easy meat. These things usually happen without you having to pick up your dice or make a note on your character sheet. They just happen. And that’s the way it’s supposed to be, damnit. As much as I would like to tell you to toss your rulebooks out the window while exclaiming “Oh Captain! My Captain!” in my honor, we both know that some stuff can’t be solved by talking and hopeful thoughts. This is a game, after all, and games have rules. The difference is that these rules won’t handcuff you or dictate how you play: they help you when you get stuck in the story because you’re not sure what should happen next. And so, here we are, me writing an introduction to another rules chapter and you reading it. Before we dive into the nitty-gritty about the rules, I want to remind you that everything in this chapter relies on common sense and your responsibility to use it. If you can solve a scene without having to roll dice or reference something on your character sheet, then don’t fucking roll the dice or bother with your sheet. For example, unless you character has some sort of weirdass mutation that lets him or her walk through walls, your\n\ncharacter’s going to bounce off that wall when they try it. Dumbass. You don’t need a rule to tell you this. Similarly, you can’t shoot the moon with your rifle from the surface of the Earth, swim up a waterfall, or do any of the other goofy shit that might be rattling around in your head right now. Likewise, you don’t need rules for getting pregnant, pooping, walking around, or anything else that you’d expect a normal, capable individual to be able to pull off, so you’re not going to find that shit in this chapter either. Although, your character getting knocked-up in this godawful world would be pretty fucking interesting… What you will find are things to help you through the tough spots in the story. Does your shot take off the mutant’s head? Can you kick down the door? Can you get away from the gangers? This is the shit that drives the story, and you need some rules to cover how they happen. So, pay attention, think about what makes sense for the story, but don’t sweat the small shit. Make sense? Good. Let’s do this thing.\n\nDOING STUFF\n\nAs a player, you decide on the kinds of stuff your character does in the game. Sometimes, you tell the Gamemaster what you want your character to do, and other times you tell the GM how your character reacts to a situation. Whenever you describe something your character does in the game, the GM determines whether the thing you attempt happens (success), doesn’t happen (failure), or might happen (decided by an attribute roll).\n\n25\n\nCHAPTER 2: GAME RULES\n\nQuickstart ROLLING DICE\n\nYou use two kinds of dice: a twenty-sided die (d20) and a six-sided die (d6). In play, you roll the d20 when you would perform an activity and the outcome is deemed uncertain by the rules or the GM. You roll one or more d6s for a number of different effects, the most common of which is when you deal damage from a successful attack.\n\nSUCCESS A success means that the activity you described more or less happens as you described it. You might succeed from describing something just about any asshole can pull off or you might have gotten a success on an attribute roll that only a few fuckers make. The GM might decide you need multiple successes to do some activity. This can happen if you’re fighting against the venom coursing through your veins or you’re trying to hotwire an old car. In these and other situations, you just keep trying to get successes until you get the required number. Normally, you don’t have to get them all in a row. You can fuck around a bit in between your successes and still succeed once you get the last one. Rolling failures while attempting multiple successes, however, will probably result in some kind of setback, usually bad. I mean, that’s what a fucking setback is: something bad. Either way, the GM will keep track of the successes and failures. Good luck.\n\nFAILURE Failure means you suck. Nah, just kidding. Failure simply means the thing you wanted to do doesn’t happen. It might not happen because you tried to do something ridiculous or impossible and the GM just shut that noise down by saying no. Or—and more likely, since you’re a gamer of discerning taste and culture—you got a failure from a particularly shitty die roll. When you fail, you might be able to try again or you might not, depending. If you’re rolling to see if you can pick a lock on a door and it turns out you can’t, you can’t. If you’re trying to smack some fucker with a crowbar and you get a failure, you can swing at his ugly mug again next time you have a chance.\n\nATTRIBUTE ROLLS The rules sometimes tell you to make an attribute roll to see if you can do a thing. The GM might also ask for a roll. In either case, you figure out if you can do the thing by rolling a d20. Attribute rolls are called what they are because they use one of your attributes. The rules typically tell you what attribute to use or the GM determines. There are two kinds of attribute rolls: basic rolls and rolls to hit. You use basic rolls to see if you can do something and rolls to hit when you would see if you can do some"
