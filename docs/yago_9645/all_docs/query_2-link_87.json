        "text": "Citation preview\n\nINTRODUCTION Some of the things I wrote in my first three books seem cringeworthy looking back, but I don't allow myself much shame. I wrote every word. I stand by every word, because to apologize for something I wrote would be to apologize for a moment in time. How can I apologize for my thoughts and feelings, now or in the past? How can I say I was thinking the wrong thing? Or that I said the wrong thing? There is no wrong thing. There is only the thing that you said in the moment that you said it. Some of what I've said in the past has been controversial. I'm sure much of what I say in the future will be similarly controversial. However, nothing you will read here was designed to merely create controversy. I hope that you bear that in mind as you read through this compilation of my three published books—'Scumbag: Musings of a Subhuman,' 'In Defense of Evil: Why Good is Bad and Bad is Good,' and 'Neckbeard Uprising.' Each one has faults and failings. Each one is an imperfect work. Scumbag is short and more written to be funny or crude than to be enlightening (the version here is not complete. I don't have a complete version, sadly). In Defense of Evil is distracted from its premise early on and never really coheres. Neckbeard Uprising is admittedly cobbled together from conversations I've had on the internet. None of these books represent me or my true potential. But they are the books I've written and I cannot run from them. They may not be everything I wish they were, but they are still my books. And I love them, flaws and all. I hope you will too.\n\nS C U M B A G: musings of a subhuman\n\nSCUMBAG: musings of a subhuman ____________________________________________________________________________\n\nWritten and Illustrated By\n\nThe Amazing Atheist\n\nThis work is dedicated to Hardcase, for being exactly like me and yet my complete opposite (and for amusing me with his frequent death threats).

COVER IMAGE: Cody Weber & The Amazing Atheist\n\nA BRIEF LETTER TO MY FANS “You know, I thought you were a decent guy until [you insulted me]; now I know you’re no different than the dickheads you rant about. Hell, if you’re like this to someone whose nice to you, I don’t want to know what you’re like to your haters.” -rdawkinsbulldog, youtube user It’s fairly safe to say that I’m an asshole. I make no secret of my petty and spiteful nature, nor do I feel any inclination to improve my personality in the near future. In this age, whether you’re a famous movie star with millions of fans, or just some guy who rants on youtube for an audience of a few thousand, people build illusions of you in their minds, convince themselves that they know and understand you; worse, they come around to the belief that, because they are supportive of the work you produce, you are in some way obligated to them. I owe you nothing. You don’t watch my videos out of some sense of charity—you watch them to be amused, enlightened or perhaps even just to mock me. Even now, I owe you nothing. “But I bought your book!” you protest in your nasally whine, tears oozing from the dull cattle-like orbs of your eyes. Yes, you gave me money and, in return, I gave you a book. Transaction over. Feel free to send me anything you like: your “constructive criticisms”, lengthy letters about your personal problems, your poetry, your artwork—whatever. Send me these things until you cum from the sheer joy of it, but do not expect me to care or to respond. Sometimes I will, and other times I won’t. It depends on my mood. Now, if you happen to be an attractive female who wishes to pose naked for me, I want you to know that my inbox is always wide open to receive any number of pictures you may choose to fill it with. This is not at all contingent upon my\n\nmood—I’ve never in my life not been in the mood to see a nice set of tits or a cute ass. And guys, it’s okay to take pictures of your girlfriend while she sleeps and send them to me as well. I don’t mind at all. No matter how busy my schedule becomes, you have my solemn vow that I will make time to view photos of your sleeping, unsuspecting girlfriend who has no idea what a scumbag her boyfriend happens to be. In fact, it doesn’t even have to be your girlfriend. If you’ve got a sister or a mom or a neighbor that you want to send me pictures of, that’s all good too. For that matter, the pictures don’t even have to be of girls. A lot of guys these days are pretty effeminate. If I take my glasses off, I can’t even tell the difference. I’m really not picky. I mean, if you could just send me close up pictures of your knees pressed together to kind of look like an ass, I can work with that. I’m the MacGuyver of jerking off to things. Give me a flashlight, some yarn, a box of raisins and a tongue depressor and I’ll figure out a way to fap to it. For instance, remember that time we went Tijuana and saw the donkey show? I mean, I knew that chick was going to blow the Donkey, but I didn’t know she was actually going to let it stick it’s spongy, half-formed-looking phallus inside her asshole! Remember how afterwards she blasted shit and donkey cum halfway across the bar from her gaping asshole and a big chunk of her corn-laden scat flew into your mouth and you puked all over the guy next to you, causing half the bar to start fighting and the other half to start puking and before we knew it the whole floor was carpeted with puke and cum and shit and blood. I still managed to rub one out that night! I tell you. . . . Wait. You’re not the one that went with me to Tijuana, are you? Shit. Awkward. The Amazing Atheist, July 29th, 2007\n\nCHRISTIANS ARE STUPID, EVIL, CHILD-ABUSERS. According to the Bible, God created the Earth in six days. According to calculations by Charles Lineweaver and Daniel Grether at the University of New South Wales there are about 100 billion stars with planets in our Galaxy. That means that, with 100 billion galaxies in the known universe, there are at least 10 trillion planets out there. Do you see where I’m going with this? How did a God who took six days to create our pathetic little planet do the same trick 10 trillion times since then? It would have taken God 60 trillion days to create every planet in the universe. That’s 164,383,561,643 years of worth work, give or take a few months. From the genealogies found in the Bible, Christian ‘scholars’ have deduced that the Earth is between six and tenthousand years old. “Well,” says the ever crafty fundie, “maybe God created those other planets first, to prepare the universe for us!” Nice try, christsucker. “In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth.” Genesis 1:1 “That doesn’t prove anything!” further protests our missing link between man and tree stump, “It says he created the heaven first. The heaven could include those planets.” Heaven is a place of unending bliss, remember? If those planets were part of God’s heaven, then going to Heaven would be as easy as building the USS Enterprise. “Translation error!” But . . . “TRANSLATION ERROR! JESUS DIED FOR YOUR SINS!”\n\nAh, translation errors—the last refuge of a thoroughly defeated Christian. When you hear the words “translation error,” pat yourself on the back. You’ve just won. Every argument with a fundamentalist Christian goes through six basic steps. 1. Atheist challenges scripture. 2. Theist defends scripture. 3. Atheist refutes defense. 4. Theist makes statement about the glory of Christ and his dying for our sins. 5. Atheist continues to press original issue. 6. Theist claims a translation error. I don’t recommend pressing the issue beyond step six for a reason that is exactly one word long: Salem. Don’t think they’d hesitate to kill you. These are the same people who still support Bush and the war in Iraq. They have no moral qualms about purging the world of sinners. In fact, they have no morals at all. Nothing bears this out better than the psychological, and in many cases physical, torture that they inflict upon their own children. Let me ask you a question (You can’t answer or argue! God, I love this medium!): Why the fuck is it legal to tell toddlers that they could go to Hell? Don’t get me wrong. There exist few bigger freedom fans than me. The first amendment to the constitution guarantees all people in the United States freedom of religion, without government interference. To my way of thinking, passing a law against teaching your children about your religion is unconstitutional. Aside from that, there is a limit to how much I am willing to meddle with the upbringing of any child. Most\n\nchild-rearing decisions belong to parents, plain and simple. However, children are not property. They are human beings who should be extended a certain degree of individual rights. Modern society does not allow parents to beat their children, despite the bible’s endorsement of corporal punishment. While I don’t necessarily agree that all spanking should be illegal, I think that the vast majority of people would agree that there is a line that should not be crossed. Parents do not have to right to mangle their children’s bottoms (or any other part of them), regardless of what their holy texts might say about it. The action of beating one’s children is illegal. Doing it in the name of God is no less illegal. Now imagine the psychological abuse of being taught from an age before your reasoning faculties are developed, that if you do not obey the doctrines of a religion that you have no hope of understanding, you will burn in a pit of unfathomable torment where demons will gnaw at every centimeter of your flesh and the unimaginable heat of fire too hot to comprehend will drag multi-pronged dagger-tongues across your soul until the end of time. I see that as being worse than a beating in the long run. You might as well just hand the kid a rifle and point him to the nearest bell tower. So, why do we allow it? I can’t think of a good reason. We’d never allow a parent to tell their child, “If you don’t obey me, I will pull out all of your teeth with an old pair of pliers and fuck your mouth!” so why do we allow, “If you don’t obey God (me), you’ll go to a land of eternal torment to writhe in agony for infinities upon infinities!” If you remove the sacred cow status of religion for a moment and look at the situation objectively, I’m sure you won’t be able to answer the following question. Who does more damage to a child: a one-time rapist or a parent who teaches them that if they’re not good they’ll burn in hell forever? Whatever your answer, I’m willing to bet that you actually had\n\nto stop to think about it.\n\nCONVERSION COUNTER: 0 AND STEADY I once remarked that converting a Christian to atheism is like changing the label on a jar of pickled dog turds. I stand by that statement. Many Atheists give oblivious credence to the notion that an imbecilic theist will, once converted to atheism, transform into the most brilliant of brights, the most spectacular of secularists, the apotheosis of atheistic intellectual integrity— and other such corny alliterations. The sad truth is that a shitfor-brains who thinks that Papa Smurf in the sky is watching his every move with unwavering concern will, if converted (or deconverted, if you prefer) to atheism, become a shit-for-brains who thinks that books are a nifty decoration. You’ll not improve such a person—if anything, you’ll make him worse. Consider, for a moment, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the shooters at Columbine High School. They were as atheistic as I am, but they embraced the dogmatism of the thoroughly debunked idea of Social Darwinism (which should rightly be called Social Spencerism). They managed to convince themselves that their shootings were, in some way, natural selection. If they’d been Christians, they might have killed for Jesus. Instead, they were Atheists, and they killed for Nietzsche and Darwin. That’s not progress by any definition of the word that I would embrace. I WARN YOU FURTHER: In an atheist world, atheism will no longer be a badge of intellectual prowess. Those of you who revel in your elitism now may well find yourself clutching at straws to justify your worth in the secular utopia of your fondest dreams. And who will we do intellectual battle with? Each other? I know we say that, but is it really what we desire? In your little black hearts can’t you admit, if only to yourselves, that it’s a lot more fun using your vast intellect to anally rape the cognitively deficient than it is rationally discussing ideas with\n\nyour equals? I suppose we can always argue with the social Darwinists—but as far as pseudo-science’s created solely to justify the actions of the powerful against the powerless go, intelligent design will never be topped. It will always hold that special place in our hearts, won’t it? Won’t you look back on the pwnage of those imbeciles and smile? I know I will. I imagine myself in the old atheist’s home, sitting in my rocking chair, being blown by holographic teenagers while robot nurses pump apple-sauce down my throat through little grey tubes. Atop my nightstand I’ll have a little scrapbook of all the believers I ever crushed in one-sided, totally unfair debates. I’ll look at their pictures and I’ll laugh myself to sleep each night, but inside I’ll be crying. Without religion, there is no religion to destroy. Our victory is our defeat.\n\nISLAM IS LAME “YOU THINK YOU HAVE BALLS? I WOULD CHOP YOUR HEAD OFF YOU PATHETIC FAT SHIT. YOU ATHEIST BASTARDS HAVE DESTROYED THIS WORLD WITH YOUR EVOLUTION THEORY, SAYING LIFE IS MATTER OF CHANCE. THAT IS WHY THEIR IS DEPRESSION AND SUICIDE BECAUSE ATHEIST LIFE IS BASE ON PERFORMANCE. IF I MET YOU I WOULD DO ALLAH SWIFT HONOR AND THE UMMAH HONOR OF CHOPPING YOUR HEAD OFF AND DRAINING YOUR BLOOD! KEEP HIDING BEHIND YOUR COMPUTER! COME TO ENGLAND AND SAY THAT TO MY FACE AND I WILL STAB YOU UP, YOU PIG HONKY. LOL.”\n\nMuhammadFaysalNawa, Youtube User (abysmal spelling and punctuation has been corrected) “FUCK YOU, racist fucking kafir! I wish I could chop your fucking head off you fat fuck! Islam OWNS YOU, bitch!”\n\nislamistic123, Youtube User (abysmal spelling and punctuation has been corrected) “Hey, man, why you are insulting Islam? This is a very big thing! You had better back off these shitty things or you are a dead man, I swear to God.”\n\nkarimsaber123 , Youtube User (abysmal spelling and punctuation has been corrected)\n\nHOW TO GET LEFT THE FUCK ALONE I am vulgar. I think bad thoughts and more often then not I shit them forth from my mouth with all the enthusiasm of an overpaid whore on ecstasy. What's worse, I usually say them when in mixed company, or when speaking to one with fragile ears, and a frail mind in between them. Jaws drop and gasps resound. \"Did he really just say what I think he did?\" You're damn right he did. And do you know what? He enjoyed it too. It's how I maintain my sanity, and now, with my help, you too can improve the quality of your life by being a dirty foul-mouthed bastard. \"How can being grossly offensive improve my life, Amazing Atheist?\" God you people ask some dumb fucking questions. Observe my ingenious equation below. People + Life =  Life – People =  And how do you get rid of people? You can stick dynamite in their asses and paint the walls with their insides . . . which is effective, but illegal and costly. You can poison their coffee, but it tends to be slow—and problematic if they drink tea or water or cat piss. The best solution to your people problem is to make your company utterly un-enjoyable by totally offending anyone foolish enough to seek your conversation. \"How do I accomplish this feat, Amazing Atheist? I am not clever and witty like you.\" I know. Don't fret. I'm here to help. There are four basic methods of fucking with peoples stupid heads. 1. The Grumbling Prick Method 2. The \"My Life is Shit\" Method. 3. The Polite Asshole Method\n\n4. The Amazing Atheist Method THE GRUMBLING PRICK METHOD This method is usually effective on those who want to ask for favors or opinions, and best of all for you dumbfucks, it's so easy that it doesn't even require any brain activity. Basically, you just grumble. Victim: \"Hey, AA, can I borrow some salmon?\" Me: \"Grrrrrrr . . . Flippidyskittlefucker! YOU KNOW NOT MY POWAH!!!\" Victim: \"What?\" Me: \"Fraggenrippert shitterpickfork eat nachos in hellzzor!!!\" Victim: \"Uh. I'll come back later.\" THE \"MY LIFE IS SHIT\" METHOD This is the favorite among whiney people, who, for the most part, don't even understand that it repels people. Basically, when you are approached by an undesirable, you start whining about everything wrong in your life. If you have a relatively happy life, just make some shit up. The more inane the shit you bitch about, the better. If you bitch about valid things, then your misery is likely to be compelling—which you don't want. For instance: Victim: \"Hi, TJ!\" Me (in depressed voice): \"Hi.\" Victim: \"Something the matter? You sound down.\" Now, this is where you hit them with it. Your response should be inane and whiney. You don't want to compel them.\n\nWRONG RESPONSE: \"Oh. Nothing much. A serial killer murdered everyone I loved and brutally raped me.\" That's sure to lead to a lot of consolation that you don't want. RIGHT RESPONSE: \"Something the matter? No. EVERYTHING is the matter. I've got a paper cut. My Coke is flat. My Toes hurt. My hands are kind of cold. And to top it all off, people that I hate keep trying to talk to me.\" THE POLITE ASSHOLE METHOD This method requires more brains than the others, and is the least effective in getting rid of people since many are too thick to even know that they are being insulted. However, this is the best method for those desiring a feeling of superiority to those that they are insulting. You most commonly see this technique used by people who want to insult people who are ridiculous, but have a lot of authority. Basically, you insult them subtly, and make it sound like a compliment. A good sense of irony is needed for this one. Victim: \"Do you think that they will ever create a computer with Artificial Intelligence?\" Me: I don't think a machine could function on your intellectual level, sir. Victim: Really? Me: Oh yeah. A computer with a brain like yours wouldn’t know what to do with itself. THE AMAZING ATHEIST METHOD This is my favorite method, and not just because it's named after me. I won't even bother explaining, because you'd never understand, but I'll give you an example:\n\nVictim: \"Hi, TJ, do you want to go swimming?\" Me: \"In your bloody remains maybe.\" Victim: \"Um . . . huh?\" Me: \"Fuck you, you shriveled scrotum sack!\" Victim: \"Hey! Fuck you, uh . . . asshole!\" Me: \"SUCK THE BALLS OF THE GREAT MONKEY DEMON!\" Victim: \"Eeeeeeek!\" (faints.) \"Wow, Amazing Atheist, you sure are the greatest genius to ever live.\" Yes. And you aren't even worthy of my great wisdom. Anyhow, I'm off to drink the urine of 17 virgin cattle so that I may unlock the secrets of the multiverse and all of its special juicy cosmic-type powers.\n\nHOW TO WRITE A BOOK This is what writers do. They sit down and write. You don't need a big vocabulary. Hell, you don't even have to have much of anything to say. Most things, after all, will say themselves if you let them. Another thing to remember is that you have to write what you feel like writing; you'll never get anywhere if you write what you think. That's probably why I'm struggling so much with this medium. I'm not a very emotional person. Shit. If I even unlocked the feelings that I know must be somewhere deep inside me (probably near the crotch) I would be better than Shakespeare. Well, not really. But I could be pretty goddamned good—better than any of these fucking monkeys that are writing today. That's kind of funny. Isn't that how it always starts? You look at the work of those who are getting paid for something and realize, that's awful! I could do better than that! And that's when the little light bulb manifests out of thin air right above your head. You realize that you've just found your calling. Writing! What could be better? You can remain as lazy as you ever were and never have to go out doors. You can be as ugly as a festering splatter of runny cat shit and still become an internationally recognized celebrity with infinite wealth. Well, actually, most writers make next to nothing and have to hang on to their day jobs to pay the rent, but fuck those guys! You aren't going to be one of those! You're going to be a number one bestseller. Stephen King will beg to suck your dick so that he may achieve an inkling of your tremendous talent by stealing your semen and using it to make a clone of you so that he can steal its inevitably brilliant ideas. You could write a book about your right nut and sell more than J.K. Rowling. That is the extent of your talent. After having had this epiphany, you rush home and break out the old typewriter (PC's are for pussies). After you get the dust out of every crevasse and yank the dead rat out of\n\nthe roller, you’re ready to begin work on your masterpiece. No ideas emerge immediately. You give up and go to sleep saying that you'll try it again tomorrow. The next day you sit, gazing madly at the blank sheet of paper. After a few hours you type an ‘M.’ You stare it with the attentiveness of a coked-out president peeking in at one of his hot daughters showering through a cracked door (nothing against \"good ol' G Dubbya.\" I ain’t no terrorist-lover). What the fuck is wrong with that fucking M? He’s just sitting there, looking at you in his smug, smart-ass way. FUCK HIM! You lift the typewriter up and toss it across the room right into your TV set, smashing the screen to smithereens. That's okay, you tell yourself, it is unbefitting a writer such as myself to watch television anyway. You decide that the typewriter approach is outdated. You decide that you need to go buy a brand new PC. Unfortunately you have no way to pay for it unless you take all the money out the savings account that you've had since you were a little kid and would sell your body to the local sex offender. That's okay though, you're going to be a filthy stinking-ass rich writer soon. You’ll show that fucking M! You’ll never put him in any of your stories! There wont be any M’s in your stories! No sir! On your way out the door your phone rings. You pick it up. It's your boss wondering where you were all day. You tell him to go fuck himself up the ass with a big, floppy, rubber dick. You hang up the phone and giggle at your cleverness. You feel better all ready. A few hours later, you're back with your brand new, deluxe, limited addition XK-33 with an ultimum 666 processor and a flat-screen monitor. The side of the box reads, THE OFFICIAL COMPUTER OF SATAN. You smile and nod with self-approval at you excellent purchase. You bring it into your work room (formerly called the bathroom) and plug that bad boy in. It explodes into flames and burns down your apartment complex, killing two and injury twenty. You are badly burned, but the paramedics tell you that your insurance has expired.\n\nNo biggie! The burns don't hurt that much, and you're sure you can sleep at a friend’s house until you get back on your feet. And tomorrow you can go back to that computer shop and give them Hell! You hop in your car. It won't start. Who cares? It’s a nice night for walking anyway. After a few hours (during which you could not locate one working payphone) you arrive at your friend apartment. He is not home. You begin to feel a bit angry and decide to mutilate the first person you see. You spot and old granny walking her tiny poodle around the block. The bitch must die! You run after her screaming obscenities at the top of your lungs. Her face contorts in panic and she grabs a Glock .9mm out of her purse. You scream, jump back and try to run, but granny isn't having it! \"Thought you could off me, huh? Ya sonuvabitch!\" she yells passionately, while unloading two bullets into you—one in each butt cheek. You fall to the ground and turn on your side. She uses this opportunity to kick your nuts a few times. Then, as you clutch them in pain, her dog mistakes your face for a fire-hydrant. After she leaves, you lie there and pray for death. It doesn't come, but the police do. They arrest you, but it's not such a bad thing. At least you'll get some medical attention, and you'll have plenty of time to write in prison.\n\nHOW TO SEEM SMART Even though you will, over the course of my numerous lessons, become much smarter than you are now, you'll still be fairly stupid. Which is okay, since advancement in human society is based not on how intelligent you are, but how intelligent you can seem to those handing out social promotions. \"I don't understand, Amazing Atheist! BLaaaaaarrGGGHH! Why come is I be so dumb?\" It's okay. I'll simplify it for you: You are stupid. The Amazing Atheist is smart. But if you follow his instructions to a T you can at least seem smart to others. Thus, your position in the social hierarchy will rise faster than your dick at the sight of any sort of farm animal. VOCABULARY A timeless method for seeming smarter than you could ever hope to be is to use incredibly complicated language to communicate any task. For example: Concise Language: \"My friends and I will go to the store and get some food.\" 'Genius' Language: \"Presently, myself and some acquaintances shall embark upon a journey to the local market in the pursuit of reasonably priced sustenance to sate our appetites in the immediate and for a period of days forthcoming.” Sure, people won't understand what you're saying, but you'll seem smart to them because you used lots of really big words. This is because they, like you, are stupid and have no concept as to what actually constitutes intelligence. SILENCE Abraham Lincoln once said, \"It is better to keep your mouth shut and be thought a fool than to open it up and get your\n\ntongue eaten by evil flies.\" Or something along those lines. Anyhow, the point is this: shut the fuck up. For some reason, people who don't talk much are considered to be intelligent. Perhaps because it is assumed that they are deep in thought about physics or genetic enhancement of the male sexual organ, or whatever it is that smart people think about.* GLASSES Smart people wear glasses. This is a well known fact among anyone who watches TV. If a guy (or gal) wears glasses, let it be known that they are probably capable of building atom bombs using only duct tape and silly putty. If you already wear glasses, great. If you don't, go get some. It is a good idea to get the ugliest possible pair in the store since everyone knows that smart people have no . . . FASHION SENSE BACK AWAY FROM THE DESIGNER BRANDS! From now on you shop at K-mart, where you will buy only the most repulsive clothes that you can find. You need stuff that positively screams, \"I AM A GEEK! I'M TOO SMART TO WASTE TIME DRESSING MYSELF LIKE A HUMAN BEING.\" If you have trouble finding clothes that scream that, record it on a pocket recorder and play it in a continuous loop everywhere you go. THE LAUGH Smart people do not laugh the same way, or at the same things, that other people do. You must perfect a laugh that sounds something like a bat getting butt-fucked by and elephant. This will take time and practice, and I recommend that you allow yourself to get butt-fucked by an elephant (just once) so that you can get in the proper frame of mind. You don't have to, I suppose. If you do, be sure to take pictures and send them to all the members of your family as well as your classmates/coworkers. Smart people are always doing eccentric things like\n\nthat, and you will notice a big change in the way people view you. But, I digress. Another important factor is what you laugh at. Things that you find funny now, like Big Momma’s House 2, just aren't gonna cut it in the intellectual community. Watch Monty Python and just laugh every time it seems like there was a joke. Eventually you will begin to think that you actually understand the humor and will be able to pick up on smart people jokes in the real world. \"But what happens when I have to tell a joke of my own, Amazing Atheist? Won't it reveal to them my overwhelming stupidity?\" Nah. Smart people are fairly slow to pick up on things like that. Their minds are always analyzing things. If you tell a joke that hints your stupidity, just laugh and say, \"I don't know what came over me. I apologize for my immaturity.\" Then start bitching about Bill Gates, or an upcoming sci-fi or fantasy film. This will divert their minds from your digression from established intellectual standards of humor. *For those of you wondering, the thing that smart people actually do think about most is how unfair it is that they are trapped on a planet full of imbeciles.\n\nHOW TO PWN MY ASS ON YOUTUBE Despite frequent attempts from a plethora of sources, ranging from Encyclopedia Dramatica to Jordi Cruise, I have yet to feel truly pwned here on “the internets.” Hopefully, this helpful pwnage guide will change this fact forever. SEIZE MY INSECURITIES You’ll make no progress simply calling me fat. If I were sensitive about my weight, don’t you think I’d make a better attempt to conceal it? If you really want to get to me, point out words that I mispronounced or logical fallacies within my arguments. If I misspelled a word in my title or description, jump on it like CapnOAwesome jumps on an opportunity to whore himself out for even the faintest possibility of a new subscriber. There’s nothing I hate worse than feeling stupid. UNCOVER MY CONTRADICTIONS I have plenty of contradictions from video to video. I leave them up because I assume that no one will ever be anal retentive enough to notice them. Prove me wrong. Find two clips of me saying totally contradictory things and play them side by side to make me look like a jackass who doesn’t know what he’s talking about. WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS, POINT OUT MY FAILINGS People seem to adore pointing out my shortcomings rather than arguing with my position. So, for my beloved collection of invectivespewing haters, I submit this bullet-point list of some of my failings.    \n\nMy oral hygiene is below average (above average in Britain). I neglect my toenails. They’re quite ugly. I pick my nose to an obscene amount and examine my finds afterwards. I waft my own farts upwards so that I can catch their\n\n           \n\naroma. I play with my balls for at least one hour each day. And smell my hands afterwards. I have masturbated to “The Simpsons.” My penis is small enough to fit in your pocket. Twice. I fantasize about being cooked alive by sexy female cannibals. I masturbate to deviant pornography. When I was 11, I shit in the cat litter box just to see what it would feel like. My nose is covered in black heads that I’ve made no attempt to treat. Because of my fair skin and massive fatness, I have revolting stretch marks up and down both sides of my body. I have back hair. I wear the same pair of jeans for weeks because I’m too lazy to transfer my things from one pocket to the next. I keep arguing a point even after I’ve been proven wrong because I’m too embarrassed to admit defeat.\n\nEVERYTHING’S FINE According to the right, the world is about to end. We have sinned against God and soon his judgment will be upon us and everyone (except those brought up to Heaven in the rapture) will suffer horribly. Liberal extremists will conquer the planet, gay orgies will spread like wildfire, and abortions will become as commonplace as brushing your teeth (this may be a bad example for those of you living in Great Britain). The only answer is to mandate prayer in schools, burn the Bill of Rights and, for the love of all that is holy, stop teaching children that evolution nonsense! According to the left, the world is about to end. We have sinned against mother nature and soon the ice caps will melt and everyone will suffer horribly. Greedy multi-national corporations will conquer the planet until every last human being on earth works for slave wages. The only answer is to stop eating meat, drive hybrid cars and stop saying anything even remotely offensive about anyone other than George W. Bush. I have a question. Doesn’t anyone else think that things are fine and that we’re all being arrogant and reactionary? When the Earth starts getting warmer, we say, “Must be something we did!” and ignore any evidence to the contrary. It sounds right to the left on a visceral level. We’re so important that it must be our fault! Look, I’m the last person to argue with scientists, but climate science is one of the trickiest branches there is. Meteorologists can’t figure out the weekly forecast half the time, but Climatologists are 100% certain that human CO2 levels are responsible for global warming? From a purely common sense standpoint, it just doesn’t sound very reasonable. Climate scientists are quick to point out that the earth is, “as hot as it’s been in 12,000 years,” but this planet is 4.5 billion years old. If it was this hot as recently as 12,000 years ago, then why is it so unusual that it’s this hot now? The fact\n\nis that, just a million years ago, the Earth’s climate was completely different than it is now. The sea level was 80 feet higher. The air was far more humid and stifling. Imagine planet Louisiana. It got from there to here without our help. Why do we automatically assume that it must be our fault that it’s going back again? Sure, adjusting to a changing climate will suck, but that’s what evolution is for—adapting. And if the planet becomes uninhabitable, that would certainly suck but we’ve already got caffeinated donuts and Die Hard 4 . . . I think it’s safe to say that we’ve had a good run. The conservative’s arguments for what’s wrong in the world makes even less sense. At least liberals have the scientific community behind their doomsday scenario. The neocons have only got “biblical” evidence (read: jack shit). And the conservative idea of hell on earth is rampant alternative sex and drugs with no legal consequences whatsoever. If this hell were ever realized, people like me would find themselves in heaven. Meanwhile, their idea of heaven—you know, clouds and harps and all that jazz, er, gospel—is about the least appealing thing in the world to anyone with half a brain and a set of balls (don’t be offended ladies, the analogy could as easily be ‘and a functional cunt’) It would be like the worst hell imaginable! Eternal bliss may sound good to the people who have never even had a single second of bliss in their lives, but those of us who have orgasmed without procreation even crossing our minds and not felt so much as a single iota of guilt afterwards, know that there is little worse in life (or afterlife, I’d presume) than too much of a good thing. For the sake of making a larger point, let’s all pretend that the conservative notion of human liberty as the apotheosis of immorality is, indeed, as bad as they think it is. Let’s just ask ourselves these two questions: Could the liberals be right about the world being fucked by global warming?\n\nCould the conservatives be right about the world being fucked by God? The respective answers are maybe and no. But the more important question here is, “what about the people who think things are the best they’ve ever been and are getting better?” We exist, I assure you. Don’t we get a say in all this? Where’s our media exposure? Where are our celebrity icons? Our propaganda films? All we’ve really got is that stupid fucking Bobby McFerrin song, “Don’t Worry, Be Happy.” But how can we not worry when everyone else assures us that there’s so many things that we need to worry about? How can we be happy in a world full of miserable people? Being an optimist sucks.\n\nTHE OUTSIDER GENERATION In all my years of spouting my crazy opinions, I have no recollection—not one—of ever changing anyone's mind about anything. I've written essays and poems and songs and stories and paragraph-long insanities on a million different subjects, but none of it has ever made anyone who didn’t already agree with me say, “Wow, you’re right!” I've constructed arguments that I believed to be air-tight, but my enemies keep breathing comfortably. I've produced, on a few occasions, nearly incontrovertible evidence to back up this claim or that claim, but the dissenters only scowled at me and stayed their course. As I've stayed mine. I state my opinion, you state yours—and neither of us changes our mind? Neither of us improves or evolves in any immediately conceivable way? No one wants to change their mind about anything. They actively resist it. They hate the very notion of it. If you examine the words \"change your mind\" closely, with a psychologist’s eye, it's easy to see the source of these fears. Hell, if there was ever a word that scared the living pig shit out of every man walking this little ball of shit in our toilet bowl of a galaxy, its change: \"Things change,\" says the scraggly villain when the hero falls. \"You've changed,\" says your girl or boyfriend just before they dump you. \"He's changing!\" screams the protagonist of a werewolf story when someone begins the transformation. It's a very negative word. At least, usually. It does have positive connotations as well: \"It's time for a change,\" says a new leader to a crowd sick of the way their old leader mislead them. \"Nothing ever changes,\" someone says sadly. (This is a negative statement, but change has positive\n\nconnotations.) The rule here is easy enough to discern—change has a positive connotations in dissatisfactory circumstances and a negative connotations when people are content (or content enough) with the way things are. So when someone tries to change your mind, you reject their attempts. Why? Because you're a human being who secretly believes that you are perfect, in spite of your character flaws, of which you are mostly aware. You are content enough in your mind to feel as though it is untouchable and sacred— something to be preserved at all costs. Why do you think the first step any cult leader or government agent takes to brainwash someone involves eroding their sense of identity and smashing their self-esteem to pieces? Any human being functioning normally is not very susceptible to the overt suggestions of his fellow man, despite our instinct to take cues from the pack and go along with whatever the general consensus is. In fact, ironically enough, our built in conformity streak is a big part of what makes us so reluctant to go along with people. This is because we are “wired” to distrust the outsider and accept only the ideas of those within our social group. In this age of extremely limited social interaction, this mechanism, once crucial to the evolutionary process, has begun to destroy us. People are cynics who distrust everything. In the 1950’s when the government and corporations churned out endless propaganda, the masses, for the most part, believed every word of it. Today, people distrust everything they hear, everything they read, everything they see, everyone they meet. Nearly a fourth of people believe that the Government was responsible for the attacks of September 11th. I suspect that people have always been terribly jittery creatures, a race of idiots recoiling from their own shadows, but there was always an “us” and a “them.” Us was a collective of individuals that could be trusted—they go to the same church as you, the have the same values as you, they are you.\n\nThem was any one that belonged to any other group and believed a slew on unwholesome, terrible things. Now there is no us. There is only them. We are a generation born to belong nowhere, a generation charged with making out own clique, but we don’t want to. And what is to blame for our reluctance? The conformist mechanism, that component of our psyche that tells us that we’re not to trust outsiders—but now everyone is an outsider. We do not function as a group. We do not have a common ideology. We do not have a common system of values. We run the gamut. Is this a good thing? Can anyone hope to compete with other social organisms when they haven’t one of their own? Doesn’t anyone want to get together and march to war with me? Hell yes, you say? But you want to lead? Fuck that. Never mind.\n\nRAPE SURVIVOR CHATROOM SURVIVOR Rape isn’t fatal. So imagine my indignation when I saw a chatroom called “Rape Survivors.” Is this supposed to impress me? Someone fucked you when you didn’t want to be fucked and you’re amazed that you survived? Unless he used a chainsaw instead of his dick, what’s the big deal? I don’t mean to be horrendously offensive and insensitive here, but everyone survives rape. Some women are killed afterwards, but that’s murder, not rape. To say that you’re a rape survivor is as meaningless as saying you’re a jury duty survivor or a divorce survivor. Lots of things in life suck— that doesn’t mean we survived them. The word survivor applies to people who are alive after being stabbed 73 times with an ice pick or mauled by rabid wolverines, not to a woman who gets dick when she doesn’t want it. Just because you got raped, you have to rape the English language? You vindictive bitch! Also, don’t you ever get tired of being the victim? How many failed relationships are you going to blame on a single violation of your personal space? I’m not making light of it. I know that it is damaging, a reminder of your powerlessness against the world—but it should be a wake up call. We are all powerless against the forces of fate (or chance). We’re all on different paths, but they all lead to the same place. Life leaves no survivors. NOTE ON THE ABOVE: I just showed this writing to a friend of mine, along with the question, “Is this too offensive to release?” I was looking for a yes. I got one. So, I’ve included it here. I’m here to cross lines. This is not The Amazing Atheist from those cute little youtube videos you love so much—this is the real me. And the real me doesn’t give a fuck about your small-minded boundaries.\n\nIf you’ve been raped, does the above passage add insult to injury? Does it make it hurt worse? How could it? If rape is the paramount psychological trauma in life, then how could my words aggravate it whatsoever? Too often in this culture, we fear words. But even if my words are the height of ignorance, they should elevate you. If you find them funny, then you will laugh and dismiss them as a joke. If you find them honest, you will respect my bravery. If you find them infuriating, I will have given you power. If you find them sad, then I have enriched you. Words never make less of a person, unless they are bland. If you feel something, then I’ve done my job as a writer.\n\nSOMETHING HUMAN IN THE INHUMAN I am a 35 year old mother of 4 sometimes in online chats. I have a 13-year-old daughter and men tell me how they want to rape her and I tell them how wet it makes my plump MILF pussy to hear them say that. Sometimes I meet men who go beyond that, who say they want to chop her young tits from her body, strangle her with a jump rope, things of that nature. My favorite scenario anyone ever conceived of was removing the jaws of all my children (the youngest of when I claimed to be 8) so that they would have direct access to their throats. Other times I'm a strict father with two teenage daughters. People write to me, asking for explicit details regarding their spankings, offering hints as to what they want to here. For instance, the question, \"Do you make them get naked for spankings?\" should always be answered yes. Sometimes I'm a 20-year-old girl named Kara who wants to sell myself into slavery. Men tell me how they want to whip me frequently, make me keep a buttplug in 24 hours a day, force me to drink their piss and eat their shit, eventually snuffing me on camera for the whole world’s pleasure. How do the preceding paragraphs make you feel? Offended? Excited? Amused? Depressed? I feel all of those things at once. I am offended that no one online ever rebukes me my perversity, but that they instead actually revel in it. I'm excited by how many perverts like me there are in the world. I'm amused because I know that, like me, they're all talk and no action. I'm depressed because I wish I had it in me to be all action and no talk. Internet sex chats are where people go to lie to one another about what they're capable of; pageants of lustful deceit where sick fucks like myself go to keep our sicknesses from destroying us. Zoophiles, pedophiles, slaves, masters, cannibalism fetishists, sadists, masochists—monsters of all shapes, sizes and colors congregating in a judgment-free environment for the purpose of helping each other get off. It's\n\na beautiful thing, really. Ted, the overweight divorced accountant from Virginia becomes Ted, the tall, muscular polygamist with seven curvy wives that he slaps around for his amusement and 12 daughters that he molests on the side. I talk to him as Debbie, the luscious and naive 19-year-old that's looking to become wife number 8. We both know that we’re being deceived, and we don't care. We're telling lies to each other and stroking our cocks all the while. Ted and I have made a connection. A real one. Sure, it's based on deception, but it's a mutual deception, a deception that we have both consented to. I jerk off to your lies, you jerk off to mine. That's what scientists call a symbiotic relationship. It's amazing how, in a world where people are so disconnected from one another, some of us can find true and meaningful (I'm tempted to say “loving”) connection in the most unlikely of places. You can rape my daughter if you want. Sure, I don't have a daughter and if I did there's no way in hell I'd let you so much as glance at her, but in this consequence free environment, feel free to exercise your demons on her. Slit her throat and fuck the wound if you want to. It doesn't matter. I'm not judging you. I'm jerking you.\n\nIT’S SMALL. GET OVER IT. People always feel the need to defend my penis from me, even when I’m not attacking it. All I have to do is mention that it is small and people will say, “I’m sure it’s just fine.” “I didn’t say it wasn’t fine. I just said it was small.” “It’s not small, I’m sure.” “No,” I insist, puzzled that they would argue with me about a piece of my anatomy, “It is.” “It probably just looks small because you’re such a big guy.” “Well, that probably makes it look smaller, but even disregarding that, it’s small.” “Why are you so down on yourself?” they ask. “I’m not,” I always explain at that point. “I don’t have anything against my penis, but the fact is that it is a small penis. Any shame I might have about that I lost after getting laid a few times and realizing that it wasn’t the end of the world.” A girl told me a story once. She told me that she was once lying naked in bed, legs spread apart, waiting for some guy she had just met to come in and fuck her. He entered the room, looked down at her, and started undressing. But at that last crucial moment, the revelation of what he was packing, he unveiled a miniscule member, probably roughly the size of mine, and she closed her legs instantly and left him standing there to wallow in his woe. I told her, “You’re lucky it wasn’t me. I’d have busted your fucking nose.” So maybe I am still a little sensitive about it. But hey, it’s easier to convince chicks to do anal.\n\nILL LOGIC I am not easily bored. I'm very content with tranquility, because my mind is a circus freak show of deformed demons and holy holes. I can sit for hours in what is perceived as aloofness, when in reality, or rather, out of reality, I am moving at a million miles a second, reveling in my genius and lamenting my idiocy. I sit there with a blank expression on my face—the world scarcely pays attention. They have no idea that I am in another place; a place where the beauty of ugliness is understood completely and so am I. In this wonderful, horrible world, I am an all-powerful god, whose every perversion is immediately fulfilled. I reign over the populace like the eidolon named night from Edgar Allen Poe's poem, Dream-land. I suppose that is exactly what the world of my thoughts is: a dream-land. The real world finds me in an infinitely less enjoyable position. I am a spineless coward, insecure in myself and unable to muster the will to take any step towards improving the quality of my existence. Despite the fact that I am blessed with luxuries that most don't have, I am apathetic. Even in the face of adversity, I remain unfazed and uncaring. I neglect my hygiene to the point of disgusting those around me. I am infatuated with a pathetic fantasy world that is obviously a product of my shallow, meaningless life. Dream-land is basically a necessary antithesis of reality—artificial flavoring if you will. I take some (but not much) comfort in the knowledge that I am at least intelligent enough to analyze and understand my delusions. That is supposed to be the mark of a true philosopher: the ability to analyze ones own delusions. It is for this reason that I have chosen to write this. I feel that we live in times that are in need of a new philosopher; someone who realizes both his inadequacy and his greatness; his kindness and his cruelty; his love and his lust. That someone is me—or it isn't. Only my time and your ridicule will tell. It is amazing how many people can formulate a\n\nrationale to justify their actions or further their cause. Obviously, logic is not flawless. It is, in all honesty, very flawed. Different minds make different connections and have different prejudices; therefore we are inclined to side with the rationale that best rewards us. We will actively and consciously defy what we know to be true in order to obtain our ideal. But what, if anything, do we know to be true? Well, according to Descartes, we only truly know in the existence of ourselves as a conscious stream of thought. Sadly, it is the true nature of this thought stream that is so often raped and mutilated by institutions such as religion, politics and the education system. But if logic is flawed, how is one supposed to advance an argument? It is a question that is probably bubbling in your mind right now. The answer is simple enough—one can't. So then, why bother to attack logic in the first place? Because far too many people have forgotten that logic can be imperfect. It should seem obvious, when there are so many contradicting ideas out there, but it has become so blatant and common that it is rarely ever perceived anymore. I want all who read this to realize that logic is not natural law, and we have no standardized system of it. The truth is that logic is a blunt force instrument, used as a weapon or a shield for institutions that have no true merit. Religion- Pious logic is the most dangerous and flawed of all the forms of logic. It is logic that only makes sense if one is willing to blindly accept the unprovable as fact. In the case of Christianity, all that is required is a belief in God. Christian logic states that God created the universe and knows and sees all things. Therefore, his opinions are automatic facts. His opinions, as well as his guidelines for living, are all collected in a book entitled The Holy Bible. So, it can be logically assumed that The Bible is always right and any other logic is just the flawed logic of man. This only works, however, if you believe in God. But when you try to rationalize the existence of God, you end up with the following paradox: Christians believe in God because The Bible told them to, and they believe\n\nin The Bible because God told them to. Atheists like myself are all too familiar with this circular reasoning. Politics- Political logic is too often based upon something that is initially just propaganda. A clever politician knows how to confuse even the most intelligent of people, simply by hiding the lack of substance behind a wall of euphemous logic. All the rationality in the world means nothing if it is built upon a foundation of nothingness. Advertising- If you drink beer, beautiful women will want to have sex with you. If you have any problem spotting the flaw in that logic, then you need to go take some cyanide, because you're a waste of existence. Law- Justice System logic is reliant on the infallibility of the justice system. That is all the justification they feel they need. Any logic beyond that point is simply for decorative purposes. Example: prostitution is illegal, but as comedian George Carlin has often pointed out, it makes little sense for there to be a law against selling a thing which is legal to give away. Notice a trend? Sound reasoning is often corrupted by extremely illogical suppositions at the foundational level. I suggest that you be extremely careful when considering a new idea. Always check the building material used for the foundation on which any rationale is based. But be wary, for distortions don't always occur at the foundation. KEEP IN MIND- Even though I try to base all my logic on fact (or at least well thought out opinion), I am human, and just as liable to make an error in rationality as anyone. Do not consider anything I say through out the course of this book as being anything more than one man's thoughts and ideas. I hope that my ideas will feed your own, just as all of your ideas have fed mine. We must share knowledge and opinion with one another for as long as we are able. We may get our Nietzschian Ubermensche yet. It could be you.\n\nThe God(dess) speaks Say this unto the world of man. This is the word of the god(dess) called dull throbbing as transcribed by the servant of reality and unreality—which are one in the same—Terroja. I have given him his name to celebrate his significance and expose naked his irrelevance. He is a living martyr . . . thus, he is a contradiction. Thus, an apt (anti)prophet for this age. I do not exist. I am a figment of his imagination. I exist. I am an imagination of his universe, which has an effect upon this larger universe—the mind of the one true God. But let us not concern ourselves with Him. He is too important to be relevant. He is concerned with His own gods, and they with theirs. Acknowledge the limitations of infinity. Embrace the vastness of personal destiny. An endless field of reflection, as a man standing between two giant mirrors will see an army of clones of himself—so are the gods of mortals. Every god is a mortal. Every mortal is a god. The hierarchy is endless. Thus, position is irrelevant. You are the slave to, and master of, infinity. Do not fear or fret if you fail to grasp this concept. Understanding is given sparingly. Do not shun what your mind does not grasp. Perhaps heart or soul will be quicker to understand. Mind=The universe. Your personal dull throbbing. I am mind. Heart=If your mind is the universe, then your heart is the eye that views it and interprets its meaning. Soul=Your soul is a string. Strings hold all things. How can it be known that this is truth? It cannot. But the truth is what it wants to be to who wants it to be. You demand concrete. Yet, you are given paper mache.\n\nBut in building a statue, which would you prefer? If you seek ease, you will demand the paper mache. If you seek longevity, you will demand the concrete. Concrete statues crumble. You demand metal. Metal will rust. Nothing is eternal, save for existence itself, growing and changing. \"Sophistry!\" you say. I try to sell you the flawed. Yes and no. I give you what you want. And that is the only truth that you will ever accept. How can you discriminate when you only accept what sounds good to you? The rational man says, \"I do not believe this.\" The rational man ignores a heart and soul that beg aloud in his mind for him to accept the burden of true multireality—which is both reality and unreality. Or, if you prefer, perception and imagination. Thus, he that embraces only concretions is no more rational than he who embraces only abstractions. Wisdom lies not in choosing one or the other, but in recognizing the place of both.\n\nOBSERVATIONS, INTROSPECTIONS & APHORISMS LOVE AND HATE—It’s easy to hate. It’s fun to hate. It’s comforting, like the buzz from a few pints of ale. It courses through your veins, throbbing, reassuring you or your superiority. When you hate a man, it’s easy to watch him die. When you hate a cause, it’s funny to see that cause fail. When you hate yourself—truly despise your every breath—there’s nothing that can stand in your way. It’s hard to love. It’s miserable to be in love or to love a thing. It’s stifling, like smoke in the air. It courses through your veins, making you feel small and useless. When you love a person, it’s easy for them to stab you in the back. When you love a cause, it’s easy for that cause to consume you. When you love yourself—truly adore your every breath—you have everything to lose. BEAUTY—I am the dirt streaked against your windshield, stretched thin, cracked, ugly—but the light shines through me. I've never seen anything breath-taking. I've never had a moment in my life where my breath was stopped by the sheer perfection of a sight. I've known the intensity of fear, of hate, of self-loathing—but never beauty. Everything that's supposed to be lovely is offset by the ugliness of my heart. How could I, who lies and hurts at every juncture, look at the beauty of a sunset and feel anything but wretched? The light of beauty only serves to illuminate my emptiness. I would like to watch a city burn to the ground from a nearby hillside, huge flames reaching from the buildings to the sky, blotting out the stars with their smoke. That would take my breath away. That would make me feel alive. What does that say about me? PERFECTION—Being perfect is just another imperfection.\n\nGREAT MEN—More great men have died than have ever lived.\n\nINTERNET CELEBRITY IS A FATE WORSE THAN HELL When I was 15, I would have done anything for even the smallest taste of fame, but now that I’ve had the smallest taste of fame I’d castrate myself with a toothpick before wanting even one more subscriber to my Youtube channel. Imagine the stupidest, most annoying person you’ve ever met. Now imagine that person being annoyed to death by the people who write me letters everyday. I get about 10 to 20 private messages on youtube per day and they fit into four basic categories. 1. 2. 3. 4.\n\nHorrifying. Revolting. Sickening. “There’s no way this is a real person”\n\nThe sentence “amacing athiest u fucken rock” is the most horrible thing I have ever seen. How could anyone who enjoys my videos be so fucking stupid? I’d rather have one million of the most vitriolic invective-spewing detractors than even one stupid fan. You’re writing to me, yet you can’t spell my name? How is that even fucking possible? You had to type my name to send me the message, so you must know how to spell it or it never would have reached me! You fucking people are mud—made of dirt and piss.\n\nI WANT TO KILL MYSELF WHEN I GROW UP Hunter S. Thompson blew his brains out on my birthday, which is also Kurt Cobain's birthday. It's odd, because sometimes I feel like I'm somewhere in between the two—part brooding loner, part raging truth-seeker. My writing lacks the fire of Thompson's, and it lacks the poetry and irony of Cobain's, but it's naked and self-revealing in the same way theirs were. I feel like I'm the heir to that throne sometimes— the suicide genius, the man who loves the whole world by hating himself. Can one declare them self such a thing, or is that for the people to decide? I’d hate to think that it's in the hands of such a small-minded bunch of miserable cretins. But, the idea that it's in my hands is even worse in many ways. This is such livejournal shit. I bet you feel stupid for paying 20 dollars for this. Fucking idiots! Eh, cheer up! It's all good, right? What the fuck does it matter in the long run? We're all just biding our time until the day we become corpses. Everything we do from the cradle forth is just a distraction from the grave, a way of denying how fragile our lives are, how death is getting nearer and nearer. It's a cruelty of nature that a being should have to understand the concept of death. We have so long fought against it with fanciful notions of an afterlife that is far better than our small lives here on earth. \"This is all you get,\" are the most hopeless words that could ever be spoken in the ears of most people. Death is not “far away.” It isn’t “just a transition.” It’s close, and it’s forever.\n\nIn Defense Of Evil Why Good Is Bad and Bad Is Good\n\nBy Terroja Kincaid\n\n\"Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil\" -Isaiah 5:20 “Good is the thing that you favor. Evil is your sour flavor.” -Marilyn Manson\n\nThis book is dedicated to the scum of the earth who are tired of putting up with bullshit and aren’t going to fucking take it one goddamn motherfucking second longer. This book is also a greasy middle-finger waving in the face of every motherfucker who won’t let you say “motherfucker” because they know that if they let you express yourself freely you’d show them for the lying cowardly fascist pig-fuckers that they are. Finally, this book is dedicated to my Mom & Dad, who were fucked up enough to keep me from being one of the assholes described in the paragraph above but not so fucked up that they turned me into someone truly evil.\n\nE\n\nvil, by its very definition, is indefensible. For this reason, the smarter among my readers may have guessed at the offset that this book’s title is misleading. You will find no\n\ndefenses of actual evil within this text. To attempt to justify the genocide of Adolf Hitler or the murder spree of The Zodiac Killer would be an exercise in callous anti-humanism, which does not interest me. I have never been given to feelings of hatred towards my species as a whole. I look upon my fellow man not with loathing, but with bitter disappointment and a profound sense of detachment. I see these creatures called humans as uptight and humorless drones, bent on consumption, comfort and simplicity. Most are feeble, both intellectually and emotionally, unable to state their desires in simple terms, unable to pursue their wants in a responsible fashion, unable to treat each other with dignity in the face of disagreement. For these and other reasons, I long ago seceded from the human race. I now comment on your species as an outsider, one removed from the struggles of your day to day lives by the simple act of not considering myself a part of your world. This is not to say that I am without a stake in the human saga, but I am no more attached to you and your world than I am to the characters from my favorite films and books. It doesn’t matter one iota to me that those characters are fictional and you are real. I am not prejudiced against good or interesting people\n\nsimply because they don’t necessarily “exist” in the traditional sense of the word. Few of us are ever tested in the way that fictional characters often are. There are moments in all great fiction wherein the resolve of the protagonist is put to trial before a gauntlet of seemingly insurmountable obstacles. In surviving these obstacles, we learn the true character of our hero. We learn his strengths and weaknesses. We learn his values. In real life, we know little of the true values of our fellow men and women. We know only what they espouse as their values. Further, we have too much of a stake in this world to see things clearly. Often, if a person betrays us, we determine them to be of poor character—but perhaps there are many instances where if we pulled back and looked at their situations more objectively, we’d discover that their motives for betraying us were good. Sadly, the worm can never be objective about the dietary needs of the early bird. Similarly, I cannot look at my own species with objectivity unless I choose to secede from it. Thus my motives for abandoning my humanity are not solely the result of a dark impulse to become inhuman, but a trade-off, a deal with the devil. I still take delight in human triumph, just as I feel sorrow in human failing. I do not, however, take any credit or blame for either. Perhaps some people will find this position to be little more than apathy with a patina of pseudo-Nietzschian rhetoric\n\npainted over it. It is not my intention to refute those people here. I would only ask that they keep their gavel from banging out the final verdict on my character until they’ve absorbed every word of this book. If they find me or my ideas wanting after they’ve turned the final page, then they can tell me so and I will smile and bear their maltreatment with all the poise I can muster. It will be easy, because no matter how you feel about this book or about me, the fact that you are reading these words means that I have your money. And make no mistake, ladies and gentleman, I will spend it frivolously. Now that I’ve put my feelings regarding my relationship to my species into perspective, I can move forward with my explanation as to this book’s title: “In Defense Of Evil: Why Good Is Bad and Bad Is Good.” As I said before, it is not my intention to argue in favor of the genuine evils that man has displayed or to argue against man’s true virtues. This book is, instead, a criticism of false morality—false morality being defined as morality which serves no practical purpose for 21st century human beings, yet persists through the dubious methods of preservation employed by its proponents. Throughout this book I will provide examples of false morals and why they are impractical and often, when logic is applied to them, unethical. I will also show how many of the things that modern people overwhelmingly believe to be evil (even if many people shy away from that word itself) are in fact harmless or even positive. In essence, the goal of this book is to show how modern\n\nmorality is a complete farce. I should state, for the terminally serious, that I have a rare condition known as a sense of humor that leads me to say things that I may not genuinely believe solely to amuse myself. If you find yourself getting irate and incensed by a particular passage, please be mindful of my increasingly rare condition and forgive me in advance.\n\nWhence Cometh Evil? Cody Weber’s hair was blond the week that I went to visit him in the dirty little Midwest town of Keokuk, Iowa. He shoveled eggs into his mouth under the harsh light of the truckstop diner, talking, often with his mouth full, about his favorite subject: failure. He spoke of how he was destined to be someone greater than the pallid lad sitting before me. He told me that as a child everyone had expected wondrous feats from him, had imagined him as a world conquering go-getter. This he spoke with sorrow. When he came to the part where their fantasies of his all crumbled to the dust of disappointment, however, the pride in his voice was unmistakable. Failure, for him, had been no accident. It had been an accomplishment—his defiant middle-finger to the tyranny of his own expected greatness. It occurred to me, listening to him with what I imagine was a bemused grin, that we all craft a narrative for ourselves. We give our lives all the trimmings of a myth and then believe that myth as devoutly as any religious person believes in their whacky dogma. We are all, within our own minds, great warriors, misunderstood prophets, unappreciated visionaries, defiant rebels or any number of other archetypal heroes. Identity is not, I think, a matter of our thoughts and ideas alone. Nor is it simply the culmination of our talents, opinions and idiosyncrasies. Identity is the illusion that our lives have a\n\nstoryline, that who we are can be found in what we’ve been through. My contention is that our lives are meandering and plotless, and though they certainly contain stories, they are not stories in and of themselves. Any semblance of order in our pasts—the notion that every event is linked in some fatalistic way to every preceding and following event—is an illusion manufactured by our needy consciousnesses. We call this illusion self. I was born. I was raised. I went to school. I quit school. I lazed about for a while. I got a job. I made some money. I lost the money. I started trying to make the money back. You’ve just read about my 23 years of life on this planet in one small paragraph. Does it tell a story? Certainly the events are causally related. If I had not been born, I could not have been raised. If I’d not gone to school, I’d have never quit school. If I’d not lost all my money, I’d not be trying to remake it. Cause and effect are present. Events lead to other events, actions have reactions. There is a beginning. There is (or will be) a middle. There will be an end. So why does my life only have the illusion of a storyline? For the answer, let’s look at some men whose lives have been adapted into stories. The movie Ray, for instance, tells the life story of Ray Charles, a famous singer and musician. From the movie, we learn that Ray lost his vision as a small child, not long\n\nafter seeing his brother drown. We see him learning to play music. We see him innovating music. We see him falling in love. We see his marital infidelities. We see his struggles with drug addiction. We see him overcome obstacles and earn his place as one of the most famous musicians of all time. The movie was a story, for certain, but was Ray Charles’ life a story? I’d say no. These moments we see in the film have been embellished, idealized and edited together to make the audience draw conclusions that would not be entirely apparent if we were privy to all the events that occurred in the vast gulf of years between them. Given the same facts about his life, different writers and directors could tell entirely different stories. The movie leads us to draw a conclusion that if Ray’s brother hadn’t drowned, Ray would never have become the genius that he was. This might be true, but it’s not a certainty. Cause and effect are at work in our lives, but often obliquely. People often say, “If only Hitler had gotten into art school.” What if he had? Who’s to say that he wouldn’t have still perpetrated the evil that he did? He might have quit art school after a year and then found himself shortly thereafter on the same path that he would have taken had he been rejected. My friend Cody views himself as a heroic failure who bucked everyone’s expectations of him and broke free of the shackles of their ambitions for him. Let’s look at the facts from which this archetypal Cody Weber was drawn (We can’t really know these to be facts, because they were relayed to us by a biased\n\nparty, but we will not presume Cody a liar): 1. Cody was expected to do well in life. 2. Cody did not do well in life. Based upon just these two facts, we can make Cody Weber fit any number of archetypes. We can make him a hero who stood up against the role others were trying to impose on him. We can make him a weakling who buckled under the pressure of those who wanted him to achieve great things. We can make him an ingrate who spurned the love and support of his family out of pure spite. We can make him a spoiled brat who glutted himself on everyone’s love and admiration to the point that he took it for granted. How can we know which of these are true? How can we know if any of them are true? Surely there is a cause for what Cody perceives to be his failure—but why is it necessarily to be found in the support of his family? Perhaps it was caused by a chemical imbalance or an event that no one would think to tie to said failure? Further, how do we know—and how does Cody really know, for that matter—that his family really did expect a lot of him or that he really is a failure? In the former case, memory has been shown to be far less reliable than we would comfortably be able to admit1 and in the later case his failure is contingent upon\n\n1\n\nEyewitness Memory Is Unreliable by Marc Green http://www.visualexpert.com/Resources/eyewitnessmemory.html\n\nhis personal definition of the word. Those who admire his brilliant photography 2 certainly do not view him as a failure. Under scrutiny, our narratives fall apart. They are our fragile and inadequate attempts to bully our lives into making sense. We haven’t the proper tools to make any real sense of things. Our memories are shoddy, our objectivity in matters of self is dubious and the effects we assign to certain causes are likely more often wrong than not. If my original precept that identity is largely derived from our narrative for ourselves holds true under scrutiny, then in diminishing the veracity of said narrative, I have also dealt a blow to our current concept of identity. I think that this is far too counterintuitive to have any real impact on our perceptions of self, but if it can be accepted as truth, then I think there is a great deal of freedom (and danger) to be found in it. To say that perception is truth is something of a banal cliché at this point, but to assert that how we choose to perceive the events of our lives can actually change our identity entirely would give us the ability to control who we are (at least in our own eyes) to an extent rarely dreamed possible in the age of genetic determinism. To clarify, I don’t believe that these perceptions can turn someone who is by almost all accounts a villain into a hero, only\n\n2\n\nThe Photography of Cody Weber http://www.myspace.com/weberphoto\n\nthat it can make such a person believe that he or she is heroic. Of course, villains throughout the ages have always fancied themselves heroes—this is nothing new. Hitler did not see an evil man in the mirror. The difference in my line of thinking is that it makes such delusions permissible by their ubiquity. In other words, if all men are delusional in regards to their self, then who can say that one man’s delusion is any less or more untrue than any other man’s delusion? By what means, if my reasoning holds largely cogent, would we be able to dispute a villain’s claims of heroicness or a failure’s perception of success? If identity is delusion, then all perception is undermined and no ethical barometer can be said to possess any objectivity since the good guys are only good in their heads and the bad guys are probably good in theirs as well. Some will here make the argument that ethics lay outside the will and that good guys are good regardless of their perception of themselves and that acts of evil are evil regardless of whether or not evil was the intent of the malefactor who perpetrated them. If God is that outside force, that non-human moral barometer, than I would like to see proof not only of him but proof of his will. And if that non-human mechanism of morality is not God then what is it? Richard Dawkins, the famed evolutionary biologist and an outspoken advocate of atheism and rationalism, outlined in his best-selling work The God Delusion, his evolutionary explanation for the origin of morality and ethics. He explains how things like\n\nkin selection and game theory have imbued man with a natural sense of right and wrong. While I don’t disagree with his assertions I have to ask why a moral code that evolved is one that need be followed? We evolved instincts towards violence and, if the God gene 3 hypothesis is correct, belief itself—and yet no thinking person views non-violence or non-belief as impossible (and only a strange few thinking people find them immoral). An evolved or natural morality is a morality that can be challenged on an intellectual basis in the same way that the value of an evolved predilection towards violence or endocannibalism or rape as a means of reproduction can be challenged. Any evolved social trait can be challenged. No evolutionary biologist that I have ever heard of has made or provided evidence for the assertion that evolution is infallible or has our happiness at heart. So, if Hitler views himself a good man and no concrete ethical code exists to contradict his goodness, then can we say that our mass perception of him as a villain overrides 1930’s Germany’s perception of him as a hero? Or his perception of himself as such? Returning to Cody, does it matter how much his admirers view him as a genius when he views his own work as ugly and wholly lacking in beauty (as he once confessed to me)? I think that it doesn’t. I think that a billion voices telling a man who believes he is Thing A that he is actually Thing B are useless if that man’s\n\n3\n\nThe God Gene: How Faith Is Hardwired Into Our Genes by Dean H Hamer http://www.amazon.com/God-Gene-Faith-Hardwired-Genes/dp/0385500580\n\nperception of himself is unshakable. If a genocidal maniac is called evil, he can always escape into a more comfortable identity. I’m not evil, he might tell himself, I’m misunderstood. I’m heroically doing what I know is right, even though the odds are against me. I’m reluctantly doing what is necessary to create a better future. I am a visionary. Our disgust with such people and what we perceive as their shoddy justifications for their evil actions is nearly universal. Few human beings on this planet today are not aghast at genocide and contemptuous of genocidal maniacs. We so deeply feel this repulsion towards mass violence that any belief system that doesn’t hold such people as objectively vile seems unpalatable to many of us, myself included. I just can’t see a way around it, however. I’ll restate my logic from start to finish in the briefest terms possible and hopefully someone can provide me the solace of showing me where I am mistaken. 1. Identity is based largely on the illusion of a narrative and the establishment of an archetype of self within that narrative. 2. This narrative is erroneous in every single human being. 3. It is impossible to object to a delusional perception of self in another human being when one’s own perception of one’s own self is demonstrably delusional as well. To do so\n\nwould be an act of hypocrisy and inconsistent with the hitherto defined parameters of human discourse. In other words, the pot cannot call the kettle black (the kettle remains black, but the pot’s blackness negates this criticism or makes it universal and thus pragmatically irrelevant). 4. Because\n\ndelusion\n\nis\n\ninvariable\n\nand\n\npresumably\n\ninescapable, no one sense of self can be seen as superior in veracity to another. 5. An evil man who perceives himself as good cannot be contradicted by other men (for reasons explained in supposition #3) or by an established system of ethics because ethics is either derived from a. man, who is delusional and cannot rightly judge other men’s deluded narratives. b. God, who cannot be verified to exist. Even if we simply made the huge assumption of his existence, his will regarding our behavior (if he even has one) would not be readily known to us. c. Nature, which can be disputed, as shown by all manner of precedent. It’s hardly original to argue against a concrete good and evil, but surely in the face of genocide and mass murder, we would be better served if such an objective morality (or ethical truth if you prefer) was somehow in place.\n\nWe find ourselves in an unenviable position. We can choose to persist in the deluded view of moral certitudes and objective right and wrong or we can accept that no such thing exists and attempt to justify our persecution of evil in other ways.\n\nHonor: Another String Tied To The Human Marionette, Nothing More. A friend of mine said of me recently, “I'm friends with TJ for the same reason people keep snakes as pets—the snake is fun and cool and really interesting to watch, but of course you don’t expect to get any warmth or compassion from it.” He went on to say that I possess an “utter lack of humanity.” Should such a thing bother me? I must admit that I have long been aware that I lack certain sentiments that seem to widely characterize my species, but I’ve never thought of myself as lacking humanity. I seceded from it, sure. But that’s just a cute thing to say to make everyone say, “Wow, that guy sure is hardcore!” and cream their jeans in unrestrained admiration for my greatness. I must confess though, I do find many human conventions quite antiquated and wholly unworthy of the attention of 21 st century people. Honor, for instance, that long revered staple of masculinity and masculine values, holds no weight at all with me. I find myself bizarrely perplexed when others expect me to be beholden to it. A recent example involves a bet that I made with a YouTube user going by the moniker of BigEvasive. BigEvasive was looking very forward to this year’s summer blockbuster The Incredible Hulk, which was a franchise reboot of director Ang Lee’s 2003 flop Hulk. I told him that, in my opinion, The Hulk was a stupid character and it didn’t really matter who directed or\n\nacted in a film about him, because the source material is simply not of sufficient quality to inspire anything but a mediocre film. This argument eventually turned into a bet that The Incredible Hulk would far surpass “Hulk” in critical accolades. For our wager we used the critical consensus site Rotten Tomatoes4, which compiles hundreds of film reviews, categorizes them into two classes—fresh and rotten—then averages them out in order to come up with a rough over-all picture of what critics thought of any given film. “Hulk” had received a freshness rating of 61%, which meant that 61% of the reviews that Rotten Tomatoes had compiled had given the film a positive review. In order for BigEvasive to win the bet, “The Incredible Hulk” had to surpass the original by a statistically significant margin. We determined the margin to be 5 percentage points. In other words, it had to receive a freshness rating of 66% or higher in order for him to win the bet. The stakes were that if he lost, I had to paint myself green and make a video where I behaved like The Incredible Hulk. If he lost, he had to dress as Marilyn Monroe and sing Happy Birthday To You to me. “The Incredible Hulk” opened and reached a freshness rating of 68%5. I had lost the bet. Now it was time to pay up. Or was it? BigEvasive was located all the way in Canada and I knew him well 4 5\n\nhttp://www.rottentomatoes.com/ It should be noted that “Top Critics” (meaning critics actually employed with reputable publications), gave the movie only 59%.\n\nenough to know he was too chickenshit to really put me in any sort of difficult position if I neglected to fulfill my end of the bargain. Honor never factored into my decision to “welch” on our bet. I didn’t feel that warm and tingly masculine ethic tugging at my heartstrings, informing my conscience that I would be diminished in some profound way if I didn’t paint myself green and gallivant around smashing things in the fashion of a thirdrate comic book character. As ridiculous and sophomoric as the whole situation was, the small backlash that it inspired6 set my mind to wondering as to the exact nature of honor. It’s a word that we all hear tossed around a lot, but I for one have never had the concept explained to me. Consulting the dictionary was useless. It contained 13 separate definitions of the word, all of which fell staggeringly short of encapsulating the word as it is most commonly used. It became obvious that if I wanted a definition to the word honor, I’d have to figure it out myself. I started by Googling the word by itself and seeing what came up. Wikipedia’s entry was meaningless, other than some interesting etymological notes. What caught my eye were pages pertaining to the Medal of Honor, which is the absolute highest decoration offered by the US\n\n6\n\nHalfwits of all shapes and sizes informed me that I was an honorless mongrel and that they thought far less of me than they had previously. Why they imagined I would care what anonymous slanderers on the internet thought of me as a person, I cannot say.\n\nmilitary. It is given to a soldier if he (or she, I suppose) distinguished himself \"…conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States.\" Let’s dissect that, shall we? In other words, the military defines honor as risking your life to kill people in service to them. Not just risking your life though—because all soldiers do that. You have to pretty much walk into certain death (when it’s not even necessary or expected of you) to get awarded a Medal of Honor. As I went further and further down the list I discovered samurai codes of honor, honor killings and other specific examples of honor—but mostly I waded through the endless litany of fluff surrounding the word. After about an hour of research and a number of days spent in contemplation, I drew this conclusion: honor is nothing more than strict adherence to a completely arbitrary code of conduct. The more strictly you follow the code, the more honor you have. The more staunchly you interpret the code, the more honor you have. Honor and obedience are remarkably interchangeable concepts. Allow me to demonstrate: She has dishonored our faith by not entering into an arranged marriage.\n\nSheila has disobeyed our faith by not entering into an arranged marriage. Lieutenant Gilroy behaved dishonorably when he gave our position to the enemy. Lieutenant Gilroy behaved disobediently when he gave our position to the enemy. The fact that I would not paint myself green to fulfill my end of a bet shows that I have no honor. The fact that I would not paint myself green to fulfill my end of a bet shows that I have no obedience (to the system of betting and bet fulfillment). Once one comes to the understanding that honor is nothing more than adherence to a particular code of conduct, one is less inclined to lament its absence in one’s self. I have never fancied myself an obedient person and I have little in the way of tolerance for those who do. I adhere to no code of honor because to do so would be to dishonor myself. Many will make the argument that strict adherence to certain social codes are a necessity to facilitate a stable society. These people are the unwisest of souls—those who have not yet realized that we must be bound together by our common ideas,\n\nnot made common by the act of binding ourselves to the ideas imposed upon us by a given overlord. In other words, we must unite around our goals, not expect our goals to unite us. The concept of honor, as I have adequately defined it, is inarguably a detriment to the end goal of getting humans to acknowledge existent harmony rather than strive for artificial harmony through the coerced recognition of codes of conduct that expand well beyond what any given individual would acknowledge as necessary. Honor has long been a tool to keep those who benefit from obedience (namely, those who are obeyed) in control. We are essentially beings who, in our boundless capacity for delusion, stitch random events, emotions and sensations together into a tapestry called “identity.” We reinforce our narrative by comparing it to the equally flawed narratives of our fellow human beings. Those who reinforce our narratives are friends. Those who contradict our narratives are enemies. Thus, the currency of other people’s opinions is vital to our sense of cohesion. This is why loners are often incomprehensible; It’s because without the steady influence and reinforcement of the tribe, their narratives topple in on themselves or becomes muddled and idiosyncratic. Those in power—CEO’s, Senators, Celebrities, Journalists—are all what I’d like to term “superreinforcers.” Super-reinforcers are those who have enough influence to propagate a particular narrative over a larger sphere of human beings than typical reinforcers.\n\nFor example, your friend who agrees with you that your girlfriend is a skank because she cheated on you is a reinforcer, because he is supporting your narrative. If you watch a TV show where a girl who cheats on her boyfriend under similar circumstances as those in your life then everyone involved in that TV show is a super-reinforcer because they not only reinforced your notion that your girlfriend is a skank, but they’re likely reinforcing the narratives of thousands of people who are or have been or will be in your situation. It is natural to feel affection towards those who reinforce your ideas about yourself. Your girlfriend meanwhile, seeks out her friends to assure her that she is not a skank, but that she acted out because you neglected her. Her friends will support this idea and there are plenty of TV shows, movies, books and role-model superreinforcers to back up her narrative as well. Unfortunately because your narrative casts her as a slut who can’t say no to any offer of cock and her narrative casts you as a cold and distant shell of a man who is incapable of love, you will not reinforce each other’s narratives. It is this, more than the pain of any indiscretion, that will drive you apart. This is why honor is such an effective control mechanism. It promises to turn all perception against you if you behave disobediently. It says to you—if you deviate from our idea of good, then you will be devoid of reinforcers. Honor uses reverence as a currency—those who adhere to the given code are given ample amounts of reverence. Those who\n\ndo not adhere are given none of the currency of reverence. They are, in fact, denigrated and despised by the people. This sometimes culminates in a sickening ritual, practiced mostly by Muslims, called honor killings. Honor killings are when a female 7 is murdered by her family for dishonoring the code of their religion8. According to a leading website on honor killings9 “Over 5,000 women and girls are killed every year by family members in so-called 'honor killings', according to the UN. These crimes occur where cultures believe that a woman's unsanctioned sexual behavior brings such shame on the family that any female accused or suspected must be murdered. Reasons for these murders can be as trivial as talking to a man, or as innocent as suffering rape”10 What man, other than a violent sociopathic, would murder his own daughter because she was raped? A religious one. Religions have codes, and if one doesn’t adhere to those codes, one will seem dishonorable. And apparently, for 5,000 families each year, the loss of daughter seems a small price to pay to avoid the loss of honor. So, when a politician or a commentator gets on the airwaves and starts weeping and wailing that honor is a dead 7\n\nThere are a decent number of instanced of males being killed in honor killings, but it’s not nearly so widespread. 8 I say religion, rather than society or culture (which is what the political correctness police would have me say), because honor killings seem to transcend culture. Even here in the US, honor killings seem to have started taking place. http://news.yahoo.com/s/huffpost/20080709/cm_huffpost/111549 9 http://www.stophonourkillings.com/ 10 Spellings have been Americanized.\n\nconcept here in America, my response is, “good.” When the reverence of others is more important to people than their own loved ones, something sick is happening. Honor has the right to exist only as a guideline, pinning you to your own ethical standards. When you replace your own will and desire with another man’s will or desire solely to maintain honor in the eyes of others, you have become a puppet. You’ve allowed your own dissent to be weaponized against you and you have undermined your individuality. Where’s the honor in that?\n\nInstant Gratification This section is dedicated to Scotty and Evelyn, respectively the smartest and cutest accidents I know. It’s my belief that people are basically selfish to the point of selfdefeat, that in their attempts to secure their personal happiness they destroy everything that could ever bring them happiness. We’re always willing to make the worst bargain in the world: a little bit of here-and-now-joy for a heaping helping of down-and-out-misery down the road. As a species we pollute our planet because cars and factories are spiffy conveniences; we don’t give a tall glass of fuck that our children might grow up in a world made of shit and smoke. As individuals we have unprotected sex, resulting in diseases to wipe us out and in kids we can’t afford (because we spend all our money on worthless impulse buys that consistently fail to live up to their promises of making our lives complete). We do this for nothing more than a single moment of bliss—an orgasm lasting no longer than a few seconds. From that pursuit of tiny happiness comes massive misery! We drink now, saying “fuck you!” to our future livers. We smoke now, saying “eat shit!” to our future lungs. This is not an original observation by any stretch of even the imagination. Pundits and other assorted fuckwits have yammered on about our culture of “instant gratification” for as long as I can remember. So why am I bothering to harp on this\n\nold and established bit of cynicism? Because I aim to defend it. Intellectuals may oft lament the limited long-term planning abilities of their fellow human beings, but rarely have I heard folks extol the many virtues of our widespread inability to prioritize on a large timescale. Not once have I heard a man or woman give thanks to our tendency to make the devil’s deal of short term pleasure at the cost of long-term contentment. The benefits of our instant gratification tendency, hereafter referred to as IGT, are largely unsung. The first and most obvious thing that IGT provides for us are children. In 2001, 49% of all pregnancies in America were unintended11. As a man who hates babies and usually cares even less for the adults that they grow into, I must still begrudgingly admit that it’s a good thing that they exist. The continuation of the human race is, even in the eyes of a misanthropist like me, a good thing. If we assume that those 49% of Americans in 2001 hadn’t had their babies because they were smart people who were able to plan ahead and realize they couldn’t afford kids, then half of the 7-year-olds annoying the piss out of you today wouldn’t be alive. That sounds good on the surface, but consider this: if half the people alive didn’t exist, there are only half as many chances of some asshole hitting the genetic lottery and becoming the next Richard Dawkins, Salvador Dali or Steven Spielberg. Now before you make the argument that those 49% of 11\n\nhttp://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/psrh/full/3809006.pdf\n\nbabies that were unplanned are the offspring of people too dumb to take even the slightest precautions against pregnancy (and, we can extrapolate, STDs) and are therefore almost certainly idiots themselves whose children are likely to be as dumb as their parents, I’d remind you of three important facts. 1. It is perfectly possible for intelligent people to fall victim to the powerful force of IGT, especially in the area of sex, where powerful chemical impulses can overcome our better judgment like a hurricane can overcome flimsy lawn furniture. We can prove this by looking at the number of exceptional geniuses throughout history who have contracted sexually transmitted diseases. Even in recent times, where condoms are readily available to all, a number of famous authors, playwrights, film and literary critics contracted the AIDS virus12. 2. It is perfectly possible for two unintelligent people to produce intelligent offspring. Neither my mother nor my father had blue eyes, but both my brother and I do. The reason for this is because we both received a recessive gene from each parent to “give” us blue eyes.\n\n12\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HIV-positive_people One could make the argument that because these men (and a few women) mostly contracted the disease before it was well known that their lack of caution was somewhat understandable. I counter by pointing out that there were still a large number of known STDs at the time that most of these (typically gay) men contracted the disease, so my point that sexual urges can overcome the good sense of even learned and intelligent people still holds water.\n\nIntelligence is a lot more complex a trait then eye color, but the principle is the same. Genes that are dormant in two stupid people could become active in the offspring of said people and result in a child smarter than the dumb asses that spawned it. 3. Stupid people serve a number of vital functions in our society. They cook our burgers, lay our brick and keep comedians like Adam Sandler and Larry The Cable Guy successful. No one with an IQ west of 110 is going to want to work the register at Taco Bell, yet plenty of MENSA members are still going to need DoubleDecker Taco Supremes and Cinnamon Twists—so let’s all agree that idiots in this country, though unpleasant company, pull their weight. IGT keeps us cranking out kids, ensuring that we have a stable population even in this age of easy contraception. If the overpopulation fears of alarmist liberals are anything to worry about, then I’ll point out that IGT also keeps us dying at a healthy rate from preventable things like STDs, heart-disease and lung cancer. IGT may well be the sole stabilizing force of our population! It keeps us breeding and it keeps us dying. Another advantage of IGT keeping us from living too long is that far less of us survive into senility than medical science, combined with reasonable health awareness, ought to rightfully allow us to do. This spares us from the worst years of our lives. Just recently my great grandma, who has survived to the\n\nmiserable old age of 96, told my gay13 uncle that she doubted that my aunt’s daughter was really my aunt’s. Why? Because my aunt is such a slut that she probably cheated on her husband. In my grandma’s senile and faltering old brain that doesn’t just call the paternity of my cousin into question, but her maternity as well! I hate to spout a tough guy cliché, but if I’m ever that old and stupid, please shoot me. Thankfully, my proclivity for donuts and cheese and processed meats to the disregard of my health will likely send me to an early grave like my father before me. Thanks to IGT, I will likely die with my wits intact and my family will be able to remember me as a mean-spirited old fucker who hated everyone and was damned hilarious. You may be saying at this point, “Okay, perhaps there is something of an argument to be made for benefits of personal IGT, but on a societal level, it’s all bad news!” I will grant you that IGT creates problems like global warming and peak "
