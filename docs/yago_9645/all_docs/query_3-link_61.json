Featuring samples from the legendary Charlie Chaplin from the 1940 film 'The Great Dictator' which although also being something of a propaganda movie, also gave rise to one of the most beautiful and idealistic cries for peace and sanity in Chaplins iconic political speech.\n\nHere we have placed fragments of the speech over a layer of hard 'banging' aggressive techno. The video montage is self explanatory and appropriate considering the tracks political content. We have it within all of us to help create a better world...simple compassion and thoughtfulness is the beginning of it. Anyway, enough preaching....enjoy the track and video.

As appropriate these days as it was in 1948'...as science-fiction has to often make the current times truths palatable. If you live in the UK and have no idea why a Drum and Bass track featuring samples from from the film of George Orwells \"Nineteen Eighty Four\" could possibly be relevent...well...'don't say we never told you so' ...and by the way, that's both friendly advice and a heart-felt warning...\n\nFeaturing samples taken from \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" (sometimes 1984) based upon George Orwell's novel of the same name, The film was written and directed by Michael Radford and stars John Hurt and the late great Richard Burton in his final film role.\n\nLISTEN ON THE HOMEPAGE »\n\nCopyright Control Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc.
