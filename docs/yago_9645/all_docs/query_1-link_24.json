        "text": "CRUCIAL BLAST WEBSTORE: NEW ARRIVALS - AUGUST 2024\n\nGet ready for a MASSIVE list of new releases, rare warehouse finds, and everything in between! Stay tuned!\n\nHere's a quick rundown of most of the other new releases and re-stocks that are on this week's new arrivals list:\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nAs always, that's just the beginning. There's much more mutant heavy music and misanthropic art to be found on our shelves and in our bins...keep reading below to check out all of the strange and extreme new music, film, and art that's included in this week's new arrivals list.\n\nYou can now click on the cover image for any title that we carry here at Crucial Blast to see a pop-up photograph of the actual item! Not all of our older titles that we have in stock have product photographs attached to them, but almost anything new that we get in stock will have this feature. The pop-up photo feature can be wonky (like most things) if you are using Internet Explorer, but works perfectly in Firefox and other browsers.\n\nFEATURED RELEASE\n\nFIELDS OF THE NEPHILIM Burning The Fields 2 x LP (Jungle Records) 39.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nNEW ADDITIONS\n\nOLD Formula CASSETTE (Earache) 11.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nEarly on, Old (or Old Lady Drivers, as they were initially known) were avant-garde grindcore upstarts, early members of the Earache roster who released the weirdest albums that the label put out during their classic death metal period. Each new record from OLD continued to evolve further and further away from their early goofball thrash, though, and by the time the band released their fourth and final album Formula in 1995, they had transformed into something completely different from the goofy Zorn-influenced grind of Old Lady Drivers and Low Flux Tube. By this point, OLD were playing a kind of futuristic industrial space-rock/prog-pop that was marked both by guitarist James Plotkin's shimmering guitar textures and the bizarre robotic singing of vocalist Alan Dubin. There is nothing else on Earache like Formula, and even fifteen years later, this still sounds like it came from another dimension. Indeed, this album has become pretty obscure in the years since it's release, even though it's one of the best records that I've ever heard form these musicians. Nowadays, we usually see OLD appearing as a footnote in discussions of avant-doom metallers Khanate, but their discography is worth checking out if you're into James Plotkin's work and the weirder fringes of the early 90's grind scene.\n\nWhen 1995 rolled around, OLD's new sound was sort of comparable to UK psych rockers Loop; there's a similar spaced out, cyclical, locked-groove quality to many of the riffs and songs on this album, but it's also incredibly \"synthetic\" sounding, the guitars taking on an almost industrial sheen, and everything has some level of processing that makes it sound like we're hearing this weird industrial rock actually being performed by robots.\n\nThe opener \"Last Look\" starts the album ambitiously with an eleven minute saga that, at first, sounds almost Voivod-ish, dissonant guitars and robotic vocals and strange melodic riffing, weirdly poppy, then after a brief interlude of sampled and cut-up/looped classical music the band reforms into a lumbering, spaced-out industrial jam, almost like Godflesh or Loop but a lot spacier and loaded with electronic effects and psychedelic noise, with the vocoder vocals coming in heavily, then spirals into an otherworldly bliss-out of synthesizer ambience. Hearing Dubin's vocals on this, it's hard to believe that this is the same throat that later produced the grueling vokill horror of Khanate, but here his voice is processed into a sort of vocoder mantra that drifts like some angelic computer chorale through Formula's hypnotic industrial prog. The next song \"Break [You]\" is heavier droning machine-pop with more of those mantra-like vocoded vocals, sheets of epic space guitar and shimmering chords, and pounding drum machines that continue to slam and throb with a Godflesh-like relentlessness. \"Devolve\" wields brutally mechanical drum machines and some surreal vocalizations from Dubin, and \"Underglass\" shifts into gorgeously hypnotic pop majesty.\n\nThe last three songs on Formula are the most aggressive on the album. \"Thug\" delivers a mind-melting mix of industrial pummel that's intercut with samples of Plotkins old hardcore/grind band Regurgitation and smatterings of delirious techno. \"Rid\" is the heaviest, hardest track on the album, channeling crushing Godflesh grind into a loping hypno-rock jam that gallops along on dense sheets of glorious processed guitar roar. The closer \"Amoeba\" is an eight minute instrumental that mixes up techno production tricks, hammering machine rhythms, and wash of processed guitar effects and amplifier drone that reminds us of Kevin Shields. It's easy to see the connection between this and what Plotkin would be doing with his first post-OLD solo album \"Joy Of Disease\" a few years later.\n\nDEAD REPTILE SHRINE N.t.K CASSETTE (Antihumanism) 6.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nBack in stock, found a few in the pit.\n\nJust dug up a couple copies of this cassette from bizarre one-man Finnish outsider \"black metal\" outfit Dead Reptile Shrine, a band whose sound continues to bewitch and bewilder every time I listen to 'em. One of several Dead Reptile Shrine cassettes that were released by the now defunct Antihumanism, N.t.K. first appeared as a similarly limited CDr back in 2002, one of the band's very first releases. And it's a total brainwarp, opening with a weird shambling dirge of primitive percussive thud amid squealing feedback and distressed noise, an almost industrial-style intro that lurches beneath sinister whispered voices as \"Nokturnal Thelema Krusifixion\" gradually winds down into a rickety improvised dirge.\n\nIt's only with the second track \"Rotting Flesh Laid On Altar\" that Dead Reptile Shrine kicks in with his demented take on black metal, as the music swells up into a murky, low-fi racket of sludgy riffing, howling chantlike vocals and sneering shrieks all over that perpetually deranged drumming that perpetually falls in and out of time. It's a perfect example of the band's brain-damaged black metal, the music often degenerating into a shambling mess that still manages to possess a strange psychedelic quality, and as the album goes on, it delivers a weird kick akin to hearing some satanic outsider improv-folk outfit on ESP Records shot through with meandering distorted guitars and snarling rat-vocals.\n\nThere's some gloriously tuneless stuff on here that's like the Shaggs (a band that they've been compared to before), slow, plodding black metal riffs collapsing into drooling mayhem, the vocals truly demented as they slip in and out of that fucked-up chanting, but those moments where it all comes together have a crushing, retarded power that I totally adore. Some songs erupt into noisy blasts of blastbeating drums and mangled blackened guitar, tornadic swarms of chaotic violence, only to give way to rambling, reverb-drenched folkiness, long stretches of mesmeric dungeon ambient or bursts of plodding, drunken hardcore punk, sometimes backed up warm, minimal synthesizer chords and laced with freeform guitar plucking, or wandering into ultra-abrasive stretches of over-modulated noise overlaid with traces of epic orchestral music ...and songs like \"Power From Blasphemous Intent\" twitch and blast with a hideous discordant violence that's as brain-scrambling as anything from later Havohej.\n\nThere's a twelve minute track on the b-side called \"Of Silence, Sickness & War\" that's also noteworthy, delivering a languid, shadow-streaked psychedelic jam that emanates a ghostly, murk-drenched atmosphere all its own. It's fucked. Raw and rambling and exquisitely messed-up. But in all this chaotic craziness, there's some amazingly catchy melodies that creep out of the seemingly random riffery and improvised din, a brilliantly brain-damaged strain of garage-grade necro-psychedelia that I can't get enough of, for fellow fans of the most demented, delirious outre black metal only...\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : DEAD REPTILE SHRINE-N.t.K\n\nSample : DEAD REPTILE SHRINE-N.t.K\n\nSample : DEAD REPTILE SHRINE-N.t.K\n\nRAMLEH 8 Ball Corner Pocket 7\" VINYL (Sympathy For The Record Industry) 10.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nAnother rare warehouse find from the depths of the SFTRI vaults, one of two EPs that the esteemed punk/garage label released in the early 90s from these previous power electronics pioneers-cum-psychedelic skullstompers\n\nDon't ask me what is going on with that front cover. It's an atrocity of some kind, I;'m sure, and I wouldn't want to be in those penguins' shoes. It always leaves many more questions than answers, even thirty years later.\n\nOK, down to the tunes: two tracks, the A-side \"8 Ball Corner Pocket\" comes in hot like German firebombers, furious tribal-like drumming at full power pummeling you while droning acoustic guitar, distant yelling, and excoriating blasts of distorted guitar noise surge and recede, dropping an offbeat, fairly pissed-sounding shockslab of violent neo-psychedelia / acid-damaged noise rock; it's right in step with the sort of freeform quasi-sludge rock drugginess that Ram;eh was neck-deep in during the first half of the 90s. It's a banger, and grows more fucked and overmodulated and electronically warped as it lumbers into brain-scraping oblivion, neverending, fading into the eternal. The other one is \"Trapped Aircraft\", a jangly, maudlin lo-fi outsider pop trip at first before erupting in their inimitable style into deafening blasts of roof-shaking percussive chaos and quasi-blastbeat mayhem, blurts of naieve melody cwirling beneath a musical carcass of wah-pedal overdrive, filthy powerchords, and effects lifting the whol maggot-boiling body into the heavens. A perfect example of how these guys could toe that line between striking improvisational beauty and total world-eating armageddon; imagine Beat Happening being beaten mercilessly by a roving band of Hanatarash members. Sound good? It does to me.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : Trapped Aircraft\n\nSample : Ramleh: 8 Ball Corner Pocket\n\nASH BORER The Irrepassable Gate CD (Profound Lore) 13.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nGASP Sore For Days (Demo 96) LP (Haunted Hotel) 24.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nNUCLEAR DEATH For Our Dead / All Creatures Great and Eaten CD (Dark Symphonies) 11.99\n\nFor Our Dead / All Creatures Great and Eaten IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE FOR ORDER\n\n����� Finally, we get some high-quality CD reissues of the early Nuclear Death discography, featuring the same material featured in that massive four-LP boxset that came out a couple of years ago, spread out across two CD releases from the recently revived Dark Symphonies imprint. These discs are a marked improvement over the previous CD reissues that came out in the early 2000s, now pairing up the albums with additional demo material that further fleshes out each pustulent period of Nuclear Death's evolution into the psychedelic vomit gods we know and love. And man, this stuff still sounds as extreme as ever. Coming out of Phoenix, Arizona in the late 80s, Nuclear Death stood out in the burgeoning extreme metal underground with a twenty-something girl named Lori Bravo on vocals and bass who sounded like hell unleashed, her voice swooping from monstrous guttural growls to bizarre wordless vocalizations to killer falsetto screams. Backed by drummer Joel Whitfield and guitarist Phil Hampson, Bravo led the band through an inchoate nightmare of grinding, ultra-noisy death metal that started off as a more thrash-influenced sound, but which had evolved into one of the weirdest death/grind bands of its era by the release of their legendary 1991 album Carrion For Worm.\n\nThis much-needed Nuclear Death reissue campaign continues with Dark Symphonies' new release of For Our Dead / All Creatures Great and Eaten, a collection of early 90's material from the Arizona death-mutant cult. Originally released together as a bare-bones disc by Extremist in 2002, this compilation marks a significant shift in the band's sound, from the grinding chaos of their early work towards a more experimental (but no less extreme) direction. This might be my favorite era of the band; the All Creatures Great And Eaten tape alone stands as one of the weirdest and most insane-sounding death metal releases of the era, a violent mutation of their earlier sound.\n\na foul melange of psycho-sexual dread, extreme body horror, bizarre fairy tale imagery, the lyrics are fantasticlly vile, some of my favorite death metal lyrics ever.\n\n1992's All Creatures Great And Eaten was the band's third album, though it only clocked in at just over twenty minutes. Released on cassette through the band's own Cats Meow imprint, Eaten found the band reduced to just a two piece, with Lori Bravo taking over all guitar duties in addition to vocals and bass. This resulted in a noticeable change in the band's sound, as the grinding death metal riffs mutate into more discordant, abrasive forms, and a sickening dissonance permeates all of the music. Steve Cowan's drumming remains savagely aggressive, but this new material generally sounds even more psychotic than before, Bravo's deformed guitar bringing an almost No Wavey abrasiveness and ugliness to their already quite hideous sound. Songs become writhing masses of downtuned abstract guitar noise and lurching, off-kilter rhythms. Weird spacey electronics and cosmic slime swell up from the depths, leading into eruptions of severely drug-addled improv. Effects pedals are cranked over deformed doom-laden concrete-mixer riffs. And a layer of vile, rumbling noise materializes beneath many of the songs, adding to the harsh, hallucinatory atmopshere. It's one of the most horrific slabs of avant garde deathnoise from the decade, almost sounding like some gruesome Skin Graft outfit at times, but constantly spiralling out into total madness as Bravo's snarling vocals become more and more distressed and demented.\n\nFirst released on notorious label Wild Rags, For Our Dead features just four songs, terrorizing from start to end; blown out, utterly monstrous death metal whipped up into a near noisecore-like blur of blastbeats, vomitous shreiks and primitive riffage, only occasionally slowing down into a skull-flattening dirge or sprawl of nauseating feedback. Ridiculously noisy at times, there are moments like \"The Third Antichrist\" that turn into a weird, almost industrial-tinged ultra-heaviness that shifts between psychedelic deathsludge and sheer Merzbowian chaos. Some of these riffs are perversely catchy, though.\n\nAs with the other recent Nuclear Deat reissue CDs, Eaten is limited to one thousand copies, featuring the original, amazing artwork and new liner notes from Lori Bravo.\n\nCAVE IN Until Your Heart Stops (REISSUE - EXTENDED EDITION) 3 x CD (Relapse) 16.99\n\nADD TO CARTTrack Samples: Sample : Halo Of Flies\n\nSample : Moral Eclipse\n\nSample : The End Of Our Rope Is A Noose\n\nSample : The End Of Our Rope Is A Noose (Demo)\n\nSample : Mr. Co-Dexterity (4-Track Demo)\n\nSample : Ebola (God City Demo)\n\nSample : N.I.B. - Steve Lead Vox (God City Demo)\n\nCELTIC FROST Into The Pandemonium (Deluxe Reissue) 2 x LP (Noise) 39.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nSUBROSA More Constant Than The Gods 2 x LP (Profound Lore) 35.98\n\nMore Constant Than The Gods IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE FOR ORDER\n\nBack in print on vinyl, issued as a gorgeous double LP with printed inner sleeves and insert.\n\nMore Constant Than The Gods is the gorgeous new album of solemn, metallic-tinged chamber-rock from Salt Lake City's Subrosa, about as perfect a fusion of classical and folk instrumentation and crushing Sleep-esque doom-laden heaviness and soaring, achingly pretty pop hooks as I have ever heard. The album opens with some somber, muted electric guitar and those gorgeous, hushed vocals from singer Rebecca Vernon (who continues to vaguely remind me of Marcy May from Scrawl), the beginning of \"The Usher\" coalescing from a fog of ghostly violins and scraped strings, gusts of distorted fuzz and the muted chords of the guitar, soon joined by Jason McFarland's equally hushed singing. When the full band crashes in at around the three minute mark, and the sound gives way to a churning metallic might, Vernon's vocals never lose their fragility, even as the band slips into ever slower, heavier tempos and blasts of crushing downtuned heaviness. And from there, More Constant Than The Gods just transforms into something massive, the guitars erupting into squalls of screaming seagull feedback, wailing high-end amp noise rising over those sing-song vocals and weeping violins and churning metallic riffage, the soft chiming of a vibraphone ringing out overhead.\n\nIt's all intense and strikingly beautiful, the songs shifting into folk-flecked dirge and gorgeous multi-part vocal harmonies, where Vernon synches up with her band mates for gorgeous lilting vocal melodies. There's the monstrous lumbering sludge of \"Ghosts Of A Dead Empire\", which starts off sounding something like the drugged, droning sludge metal before shifting into long stretches of ominous violin that sing over rumbling, fuzz-drenched guitars, leading into the crushing denouement where the song suddenly ascends into a fucking breathtaking hook. Here, Vernon's vocals transform into this achingly beautiful, terminally catchy melody that melts into the droning, saurian riffage perfectly, those violins skittering overhead, turning the final minutes of the song into a stunning piece of folk-flecked sludgepop majesty. \"Cosey Mo\" features another one of these stunning hooks churning at the heart of the sweeping chamber strings and that grinding guttural guitar tone, while \"Fat Of The Ram\" slips into an ecstasy of angular heaviness, that Sleepy metallic crush shifting into a strange blur of dissonant slide guitar and haunting clarinet sounds. As the instruments become glazed in delay and are set adrift on waves of echo, the music turns dark and dreamlike as the band bulldozes through the haze, eventually erupting into a kind of progged-out grandeur.\n\nThe album is filled with these amazing moments, from the sorrowful doom of \"Affliction\" that burns with a mutated, bluesy power, to the dramatic piano that opens closer \"No Safe Harbor\" and is joined by gorgeous, witchy flutes for another stretch of dark chamber rock mastery, the droning doomed deathmarch that emerges later finds itself fused to an airy folky beauty. Each song weaves an eerie spellbinding story, Vernon's lovely voice the thread tying it all together, with lyrics that are both richly evocative and literate, with considerable footnotes included in the booklet that help to expand their lyrical visions. By far the band's best work to date, the album features Glyn Smyth's beautiful Symbolist/Aubrey Beardsley influenced artwork.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : SUBROSA-More Constant Than The Gods\n\nSample : SUBROSA-More Constant Than The Gods\n\nSample : SUBROSA-More Constant Than The Gods\n\nCARPENTER, JOHN FireStarter (Original Soundtrack) CASSETTE (Sacred Bones) 11.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nARTIFICIAL BRAIN Artificial Brain CD (Profound Lore) 13.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nDESIDERII MARGINIS Serenity / Rage LP (Cyclic Law) 22.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nNot all dark ambient is equal. Plenty of artists strive for simple emptiness, the solace of the void. Which is nice, but there's something special about artists like Sweden's Johan Levin, who imbues a greater depth of emotion and feeling and menace into his largely electronic driftscapes. Nothing mawkish or comforting here, though. This is music meant to disturb. Levin's work under the banner of Desiderii Marginis is a singular body of work going back to the project’s formation in 1993; while one of the original Cold Meat Industries entities, Desiderii Marginis revealed a deeper textural core and a penchant for peeling back the softening, bruising flesh of his grim ambiance and revealing a kind of pungent poetry in the diaphanous clouds of synthesizer drones and electronic blur. That restrained, highly textured expression in some ways diverged from the cruel, morbid machinations of Cold Meat's harsher aesthetic. But the mood? The subject matter? The exquisite midnight blackness of Desiderii Marginis sits right at home amongst the likes of Brighter Death Now and Mz.412.\n\nThis 2023 reissue of Serenity / Rage is an exemplary demonstration of this abyssic style, with a more recent iteration of Levin's approach to creating rich fields of baleful, shadow-soaked sound, but the foundational syntax of his work remains the same. And the subject matter couldn't be more troubling: an examination of the serial killer Edmund Kemper, whose voice infests brief passages of the album's gorgeous dark ambience. Serenity was actually originally self-released by Levin several years ago, but Cyclic Law revived it as a lovely reissue on CD and vinyl, with distressing new sleeve art created by author / musician Martin Bladh (IRM, Skin Area, Infinity Land Press) that ties in with the album's grotesque subject matter.\n\nYou know you're in for a bad trip when an album opens with Kemper discussing his familial upbringing. His intelligent, contemplative voice hangs over a bed of dreary, melancholic drone, leading you down the darkened hallways of \"I Was Destroying Icons\". The voice recording used for this is perfectly selected and applied, effectively unnerving in his flat, impassionate delivery. In fact, the themes and imagery behind Serenity / Rage are not spelled out for the listener. What seems to be an aural examination of the Kemper case expands into something wider over the course of the album. That first track surgically applies Kemper's matter-of-fact confessionals to a dimly-lit space of distant but crushing distorted percussion in a reverberant vastness, descending downward into black chasms of psychological dread while haunting string sections, field recordings, and orchestral pads softly swirl around you. The six-song album grows more suggestive with its macabre material, once Levin performs an impressive interpretation of Brighter Death Now's \"Necrose Evangelicum\", reshaping it into something more amorphous and nebulous. An unexpected choice for the second song on Serenity, but its presence this early into the album is impactful. It picks up from those massive percussive blasts of the opener, as ghostly choral voices and surges of cold metallic synth sweep across the expanse; sounding totally cinematic in scope. Boundless electronic beauty hangs in stark opposition to the cruelties that continue to crawl to the surface. The temperature drops to sub-freezing when \"New Flesh On The Demon Cold\" rolls in, icy drones and glacial choral textures beset by occasional percussive blasts. These tracks melt one into the next, the bleary subterranean rumble of \"Psychogeography\" slipping into the sinister thrum, malevolent chittering noises and dissonant strings of \"I Think It Was a Sunday\", and finally into the closer \"The Hours Of Darkness \", where strange mechanical sounds, distant metallic rattling, and angelic synths blur together into a perfectly formed, soul-chilling driftscape.\n\nIts remarkable how much this feels informed by Berlin School-electronics. Even at its most chilling and unnerving, there's this gleaming grandeur that prevails. The album is a stunning contradiction between the capacity for human brutality and the transcendent power of music that reaches for the divine.\n\nLimited to three hundred copies.\n\nSWARTALF The Golden Section CD (Memento Mori) 11.98\n\nADD TO CARTTrack Samples: Sample : SWARTALF-The Golden Section\n\nSample : SWARTALF-The Golden Section\n\nSample : SWARTALF-The Golden Section\n\nSample : SWARTALF-The Golden Section\n\nINTEGRITY Those Who Fear Tomorrow (2022 Edition) LP (Relapse) 21.00\n\nADD TO CART\n\nHALL, NATE Electric Vacuum Roar CD (Heart & Crossbone) 11.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nKiller psychedelic heaviness! U.S. Christmas guitarist / singer Nate Hall follows up a pair of killer solo appearances on Neurot with this new two-song dip into the cosmic whirlpool, raining down a pair of fairly epic-length psych jams that shudder with Hall's trademark low-slung riffery and penchant for star-scorching effects splooge. This really hit the spot when I threw it on earlier in the midst of a rather depressing workday; the first track \"Dance Of The Prophet\" howls across the first half of the disc, sending some languidly lysergic power-blooze noodling soaring through a fog of delay and flange effects, billowing out across waves of rumbling distorted amplifier drone and distant slo-mo drumming, almost sounding in those first few minutes like some classic Acid Mothers style space-psych being played back at quarter speed.\n\nOnce Hall drifts in with those far-off, incantatory vocals, though, this definitely starts to resemble the sort of Appalachian sludge-psych he's been delivering with his main band for the past decade. It's a different spin on it though, incorporating subtle bits of electronic glitchery and manipulated guitar sounds to craft something a little more spacey and surreal. The whole thing meanders across the disc, both tracks oozing into long stretches of barely formed bleariness and wailing guitar drone, seeping strange shortwave frequencies and drifting into passages of haunting glacial twang, a kind of slow moving and sun-blasted sinister psychedelia beamed in from some rustic black nebulae mapped out by Manly Wade Wellman, rife with moments of startling stark majesty. And on the second song \"Long Howling Decline / People Fall Down\", Hall cranks up the amps for an even heavier descent into an acid-fried hypno-rock ritual, the frantic howl of Crazy Horse tumbling in reverse up through an ancient mine shaft, before finally breaking apart into a searing blast of solarized feedback and ghostly feedback drone that transforms into a beautiful elegiac passage that climbs upward across the finale of the album, which turns out to be a cover of a song from Idaho psych rockers Caustic Resin, who's Brett Netson (also of Built To Spill) actually appears on this album on additional guitar and bass. If you're into the likes of Hall's main band, the country-fried doom n' twang of recent Neurosis, the glacial rural gothic of latter day Earth, and the blown-out saurian country rock of Across Tundras, then this is one you're definitely going to want to pick up.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : HALL, NATE-Electric Vacuum Roar\n\nSample : HALL, NATE-Electric Vacuum Roar\n\nBEYOND LIGHT Paintings In The Hall CD (Maa Productions) 12.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nThings get really miserable on album number two from Dutch experimental black metaller Beyond Light, another one-man band delivering the sort of intoxicatingly mournful gloom-bliss that Japanese label Maa has been cornering the market on. Sole member Belfalas offers his own odd take on the \"depressive\" black metal sound, mostly made up of writhing minimalist riffs and droning blackness woven around some great, uber-gloomy melodies and the occasional ripping black n' roll hook. Belfalas whips out lots of soaring hard rock solos over his rumbling old-school black metal attack, but also leads the songs into sometimes unexpected territory, scattering passages of sorrowful classical piano amid the heavier metallic songs, or slipping from the furious, slightly off-kilter black metal of \"Painted Memories\" into a strange freeform soundscape of wheezing harmonica and distant rumbling sounds of warfare. The songwriting is actually pretty weird, with lots of awkward, angular riffs and odd tempo changes that throw this stuff off kilter by a few degrees, but it's also quite beautiful at times, too, especially when those piano instrumentals come in, gorgeously maudlin passages of heartbroken melody and weeping string sections, or the lush, dreamy darkwave that emerges across the beginning of \"Her Broken Face\", resembling some classic 80's era gothic rock draped in acoustic guitars and that ghostly piano, distant wailing vocals drifting over washes of chorus-drenched guitar, leading into the sudden shift into regal black metal that kicks in about half way in, which itself makes way eventually for a monstrous blackened groove towards the end that would make Khold proud.\n\nThe album also features some terrific flights of Floydian spaciness that ascend from the remnants of Beyond Light's buzzsaw black n' roll, blurts of blighted Sabbathian doom-groove, passages of lovely dusty folkiness overlaid with harmonica that recalls Neil Young's early stuff, and smatterings of an almost Ved Buens Ende-esque dissonance that all contribute to a creative take on the \"DSBM\" aesthetic. And the vocals are mostly delivered as a hushed, menacing whisper buried beneath layers of distortion and grit...as with a lot of the bands in this vein that I dig, there's a bit of a Katatonia vibe going on with the more subdued gloom-rock parts; there's one song in particular on this album, \"Her Cold Hands\", which is one of the catchiest black metal songs I've heard in ages, and it pairs up the band's apparent love of vintage goth rock tones and ragged black metal riffery better than anything else on this disc, producing a particularly riveting anthem to personal desolation. It takes a few songs for Paintings In The Hall to really get it's footing, but once it does, it delivers a distinctive sound that's equal parts contempo black metal, weather-beaten folk and arty gothic gloom.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : BEYOND LIGHT-Paintings In The Hall\n\nSample : BEYOND LIGHT-Paintings In The Hall\n\nSample : BEYOND LIGHT-Paintings In The Hall\n\nVARIOUS ARTISTS Epicurean Escapism III CD + DVD (The Epicurean) 26.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nPERTURBATOR The Uncanny Valley CD (Blood Music) 16.98\n\nADD TO CARTTrack Samples: Sample : The Uncanny Valley\n\nSample : Disco Inferno\n\nSample : Venger\n\nCOTTRELL, DORTHIA Death Folk Country (TRANSLUCENT GOLD) LP (Relapse) 22.00\n\nADD TO CART\n\nGOST Behemoth LP (Blood Music) 23.00\n\nBehemoth IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE FOR ORDER\n\nBack in print on vinyl!\n\nFinnish avant-metal label Blood Music has really cornered the market on heavy, dark and aggressive synthwave lately, reissuing the entire back catalog from Parisian synthwave celeb Perturbator, and putting out the latest album from sci-fi electro-prog master Dan Terminus. But the most monstrous sounding synthwave to appear via Blood Music yet might be Gost, an American artist who popped up seemingly out of nowhere towards the end of 2015 and dropped this massive slab of malevolent dark synthwave on our heads. Described by the label as \"1980s black metal-inspired retro slasher exploitation, starring the demonic entity Baalberith as GosT, casting ample devious nods towards Perturbator, Goblin, Justice and Bathory\", this stuff is most definitely speaking my language. Granted, that overheated label blurb suggests that there might be something more metallic going on with Gost's sound (which there isn't), but the iconography is all there, with an album cover that looks like something that could have come off a death metal record, track titles like \"Reign In Hell\" and \"Bathory Bitch\", and an overall atmosphere of pending violence and apocalyptic dread.\n\nBut the music is pure electro, another throwback to that vintage 80's-era synthesizer sound that shares a lot in common with labelmates Perturbator (who shows up here with a neat, almost Skinny Puppy-esque remix of the title track) and the equally dark Carpenter Brut. The music on Behemoth does feel a bit heavier than that stuff, though, the synths often distorted into crunchy, grinding electronic riffs, bringing a particularly filthy bass sound to this stuff that feels informed by dubstep, the drum programming heavy and pummeling, the tracks often shot up with harsh atonal stabs and weird ghostly vocal pads. It's definitely menacing stuff, a relentless pounding assault of dancefloor delirium, but like just about goddamn synthwave album, it has that one moody disco track that features a guest female vocalist, this one being \"Without A Trace\". It's pretty infectious, I have to admit, a blast of earworm synthpop dropped into the middle of the rest of Gost's sinister, distorted synthwave stomp. The album's best track though is the title song, which sticks out from the rest of the album with it's barrage of piercing, atonal synths and blasting demonic choral voices screaming over an insanely distorted synth riff, so heavy that it actually starts to sound like some kind of industrial metal, especially when it drops into a grinding mid-tempo groove in it's second half, producing what is easily the heaviest and most aggressive track on here. I would have loved to have heard more in that vein. Aside from that crusher, though, there's nothing here that rattles the current synthwave paradigm, but if you dig this sort of dark, nostalgic electronica as much as I do (which is a lot), Behemoth offers an excellent dose of what you're craving, with a grimmer and meaner vibe than most.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : GOST-Behemoth\n\nSample : GOST-Behemoth\n\nSample : GOST-Behemoth\n\nVOIVOD Rrroooaaarrr (Reissue) LP (Noise) 23.00\n\nADD TO CART\n\nBLUES CREATION Demon & Eleven Children CD (Calamares Productions) 15.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nBOHREN & DER CLUB OF GORE Black Earth CD (PIAS Recordings) 16.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nDEMONOMANCY / WITCHCRAFT Archaic Remnants Of The Numinous / At The Diabolus Hour CD (Nuclear War Now!

The whole look of Psychic Hologram oddly makes me want to pop in Beyond The Black Rainbow when I'm done. Certainly one of the cooler / weirder looking albums from the Iron lung camp. But musically, this is high-grade nerveshred. The Olympia, WA group doesn’t seem to have much documented sound prior to this 2019 debut, but their sonic attack is most definitely fully concentrated here. With a feeling that they’ve been immersing themselves in a steady flow of Ballard, Keel, McKenna and Marshall McLuhan texts, these neon punkers are blasting out near-future eschatonic imagery via rapid-fire mutoid hardcore and synaptic-burning electronic music with a dose of crude industrial influence and sequencer abuse welded onto the mass; Cyberplasm resemble something I'd expect from those demented latter-day Japanese hardcore outfits in both energy and execution, and I can't imagine that stuff like S.H.I. (Struggling Harsh Immortals), Endon and the Confuse-inspired chaos of Zyanose and Death Dust Extractor wasn’t in some way an influence on what these guys are up to. All these are mere reference points though, the corrosive dystopian hardcore on Hologram stands quite solidly on its own.\n\nCarpenter's growling synthesizer from The Thing slinks into the room while waves of etheric plasma and murderous voices skulk in the shadows, and then \"Dopamine Machinery\" plows straight into your third eye with a locomotive force, part Motorhead / D-beat metalpunk, part Confuse amp-shriek noise-punk, a monstrous riff pinning the whole thing atop the controlled eruptions of electronic and over-modulated chaos that are released in regular, numbered bursts; jesus fucking Christ does this go vicious from the start. That mix of blown-out amplifier-fucking hardcore and brutal Motorcharge and mangled analog electronic equipment heaving its guts all over the place fuels most of the stuff on this record. From \"Beyond The Mind\" to the sneering speaker-shredding psychedelic punk ripper \"Nihilist Dictator\" to the static-soaked anthem \"Nervous Systems \" to the Nitzer Ebb-esque rhythms and anger of \"The Psychic Hologram\" and \"Perfect Body Pt. II\". The psychotic vocals shift in timbre and intensity throughout the whole thing, but at the same time these songs are perversely catchy given how warped and noisy they are, backed by that intense drum machine programming. Meanwhile, you get these undercurrents of programmed beats, sicko sequencer throb scraped off the steel-toed boot of some imposing 80's era EBM, maniacal vocal track manipulations, brain-smushing electronic fuckery, moments like \"Free The Body\" where it sounds like classic Discharge being run through a chain of ecto-plasm smeared transistor radios, or the technoid hardcore mania that soups up \"Machines From Trauma\" and the echoplex-n'-LSD overdrive of closer \"Simulate Prison\" into crowd-obliterating energy levels . Kind of evokes some of the later, weirder G.I.S.M. material too, at least in spirit.\n\nIt's been said before, but some of the most interesting and vicious shit happening in the hardcore punk spectrum lately is coming out of this whole Confuse / Disclose-influenced \"noise punk\" aesthetic that has been getting progressively more experimental, extreme and trippy over the past two decades, with some serious industrial damage going on. Stuff like L.O.T.I.O.N. and No Statik. All I can really say is that If I do end up chewing on a dog's leg up on the 30th floor, I hope this is coming out of the speakers when it happens.\n\nComes in a jacket with striking design by Sainte-X, limited to five hundred copies with a large foldout poster and a download code.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : Dopamine Machinery\n\nSample : Nihilist Dictator\n\nSample : Perfect Body Pt.

Fuck Riffs!! is actually one of a handful of collaborations and splits that these two bands have done together, and here they comkpliment each other's noxious anti-musical blurr perfectly. This is classick-style old-school noisecore, but with both Final Exit and Sedem Minut Strachu showing how even this sort of borderline Dadaist audio-violence can be expressed in a myriad of ways.\n\nFinal Exit's side is a grenade blast of lunatic hyperspeed absurdity, chopped up into five songs humorously titled like \"Kamikaze Attacked The Gym\" and \"Party, Angry And Lack Of Sleep\". These Japanese weirdos have been at this since 1994, actually appearing on one a compilation that was one of the earliest Crucial Blast releases ever. So I've been a fan of this stuff for awyhile. Known amongst noisecore fanatics for their ability to blown open the boundries of total blurr into moments of ridicculous but adeptly performwed disco music, surf rock, pop melody, and heavy metal, it always a brainfuck listening to 'em. Amphetimine speed-chaos disinitegrates into fucked-up ska parts before morphing into an utterly hwellish feedback-drilling vat of blackened sludge a la Corrupted. Pretty pop punk jangle explodes into pure blurr in a matter of seconds. There are a couple of grueling sludgecore sections included among the acoustic guitar strum, three-second noisecore blasts, bursts of crossover thrash riffing, and hideous roiling low-end noise. Fuckin' brilliant - like I've mentioned in the past, it seems evident that these two guys are hardcore Naked City fans, but attack their bizarro blast with total punk abandon. It's pretty wild what they do here in five minutes with just guitar and drums (and those sickoid shrieking gibbon gibberish vocals, of course).\n\nFar more murky, low-fi and downright barbaric, Sedem Minút Strachu simply belt out a single untitled five and a hhalf minute piece of bass-heavy (and I mean heavy blurr. This stuff sounds monstrous, moving from the absurd thousand mile per hour blasts of incompreggensible chaos to mid-tempo punk to splatters of rumbling bass noise. From all appearances, this is an ode to bass-god Cliff Burton, and there are a shitload of wrecked Metallica riffs that keep surfacing out of the cranked-up concrete-mixer caveman pandemonium. There is some very weird shit going on with the vocals, with what sounds like some kind of actual singing going on in the background when they aren't howling and barking like animals. Knowing Sedem Minút Strachu from their other releases, this has got to be mostly improvised noisecore aside from those totally berserk Metallica motifs that keep popping up, but even when this side is going at full velocity, it can have this feeling of \"complexity\" that is sort of unique to theser guys. It's awesome.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : FINAL EXIT - Deadly Drive\n\nSample : SEDEM MINUT STRACHU - Untitled\n\nAMAZING GRACE Revival Times CD (Desolation House) 9.99\n\nADD TO CARTTrack Samples: Sample : Sunday\n\nSample : Blind\n\nSample : Faith Healing (Symbols)\n\nKUTULU Ph'nglui Mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh Wgah'nagl Fhtagn CDR (Steelkraft Manufactory) 10.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nSUBTERRANEAN SOURCE Ellipsis CD (Winter-Light) 16.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\n2021 full-length is made up of five longform collaborations from a number of names in the dark ambient underground, some of whom are personalm favorites here at C-Blast. The cthonic electronics and vast sub-surface dronescapes that Italian sound-sculptor Subterranean Source has been craffting since the turn of the millenium are all present, showcasing a skilled hand at creating a newer interpretation of the \"isolationist\" aesthetic, but the addition of these other plays adds even more textural qualities and ubnique combinations of sound and style than other recent offerings from the Source. With tracks that spread out from six to sixteen minutes in length, the album thrusts you into another stunning and ill-lit space, starting with the buzzing halogen dread of the opener \"Decadimento Incrementale Featuring\". TYhis one has fellow Italian Paolo Bandera ( ( Sshe Retina Stimulants, Ensemble Sacrés Garçons, Iugula-Thor, Sigillum S ) stepping in to contribute a horde of mechanical buzz and crystaliizzed fragments and sometimes ghastly-sounding aural events to the Source's underground vastness and endless rumbling drones. That first track is as chilling as anything I've heard from either artist, evocative of Yen Pox and lustmord at their most skin-crawling creepiest. The shortest piece is the collab with New Risen Throne, \"Evoke\", which compresses their sounds into a more claustrophonbic experience, a swarming of low-volt energy, ghostly murmurations, cyclic clicking, and mysterious percussive noises all surrounded in a cloying blanket of cavernous echo and reverb; slightly more meditative than menacing, but still pitch-black in tone, flowing towards a finale that feels like the afterglow of a seance gone sideways.\n\nWhen Exit In Grey and Subterranean Source converge for the epic \"Oblivion\", each artist's signature style is blended together into a harrowing spookshow of immense tectonic rumblings, sinister voice-like presences filtereed throuygh an elecrtronic signal, glowing specks of irradiated hum and the infinite whirr of prayer-bowl like gestures. This one is filled to the brim with detailed activity, a swirling space alive with sudden, frightening flashes of tone and scrape and hiss, made all the more unnerving by what feels like a multitude of malevolent voices murmuring in the distance at different directions. As some subtle minor-key organ-like musical shapes take form, the atmosphere of \"Oblivion\" turns towards the Gothic, as if we are leaving a dank, earthen tunnel system and enteering some gargantuan underground cathedral as some kind of serpent-worship is occuring, a ritualistic air hovering over these new movements, while the still-mysterious clanks and bell-like intonations echo in the unseeable blackness, evoking some unknown processes at work as the sounds slowly shift towards some sort of consonant lightness glimmering at the very end of the structure. Definitely a highlight of this album, one of the more cinematic-sounding pieces on the whole album, but still pretty goddamn freaky.\n\nFor \"Ocean Chants & Ghosts \", Nimh adds their hair-raising death-drones and ritualistic musicality to another sprawl of ambient unease. Softly plucked strings and poignant keyboards from Nimh form a kind of funereal beauty that drifts over the Source's dark drift. From the start, this piece reveals a mournful beauty unlike the rest of the album, evoking a Tangerine Dream-like grandeur as they tunnel through the black, gorgeous electronic melody and delayed strings weaving a mesmerizing central figure, while beyond the soft firelight of this melody there are numerous menacing movements in the shadows, all coming together to make this a breathtaking piece of grim beauty , even more cinematic, \"soundtracky\", and emotionally, epically wrought than anything else on Ellipsis, and easily my favorite song on this disc. This one lurks in my mind even after the disc is finsihed.\n\nLastly, the song \"Zaruchejnaya\" has Lunar Abyss joining with an unusual and unexpected glitchy folk-flecked noisescape, those massive rolling drones and cave-system reverberations unfolding under a bizarre twilight sky of insectile chirps, whizzing and whirring electronics, odd sinewave formations, and another musical quality that is a bit lighter in tone than the preceding tracks. It's still pretty oppressive, of course, but there's a surrealistic playfullness that Lunar Abyss brings to this piece that really stands out, merging dark ambient awe and bits of mournful piano-like notes, gentle guitar plucks, shimmering chimes, weird voices stretched over the backgriound, surges of percussive thubnder, all very strange and darkly magical as it all proceeds to surface from the inky blackness of the rest of the album's aural underworld into the violet glow of encroaching night, unleashing an alien dreamscape upon you as you break the surface.\n\nATHAME / XEUKATRE Morbid Deviations CASSETTE (Crucial Blast) 8.00\n\nADD TO CART\n\nLong in the works and finally released as a split-label effort between Infernal Machines and depraved local imprint Volva just as the two bands were about to embark on their 2019 summer tour together, Morbid Deviations is the long-awaited split album featuring two of the Baltimore / Maryland area's most vicious and destructive black metal outfits. Released as a pro-manufactured tape with on-shell printing and packaged with a pair of 1\" buttons each bearing the sigil of each band, and released in a limited edition of two hundred copies, this motherfucker seethes with all of the violent, inebriated energy that these two outfits have harnessed over the past decade.\n\nThe Athame side blows this up immediately with three sweat-and-blood stained blasts of morbid ugliness from the fringes of Appalachia. It's a fetid mixture of pulsating cellar emanations with brief moments of cavernous ambiance and abstract ritualistic rattling amid the crushing chaotic, sludge-n'-punk stained black metal of \"Human Flood\" and \"I, Accuser\", with an ode to classic 80's deathrock surfacing in the middle with Athame's barbaric rendition of Christian Death's \"Figurative Theatre\". There is a wretched, lurching, blasting hatefulness that grips the witch-blade and follows the continuum of their underheard but satisfyingly grimy discs With Cunning Fire and Adversarial Resolve and The Burning Times. To date, some of their best work that I've heard.\n\nOn the B-side, Baltimore's Xeukatre follow with their own uniquely putrid melange of Les Legions Noires-influenced filth and ghastly low-fidelity punk. Frenzied and rotten, their three offerings \"Dirgelwch Ffydd\", \"Sigrdrifumal\" and \"Scalding Blizzard of Seraphim Tears\" waft off of their side of this tape like fumes from a corpse-clotted gutter. One of the few releases to surface from the trio even after a decade of skulking around dimly-lit Baltimore-area venues , this is some of the best raw, unhinged black metal coming out of the area, and hopefully a portent of more new material to come at some point in the near goddamned future.\n\nA full-length split album that features three exclusive tracks from each band, presented with professionally manufactured cassettes with black-on-silver shell print, in a limited edition of 200 copies. Each cassette comes sealed with a pair of ATHAME and XEUKATRE 1\" badges.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : Side A (excerpt)\n\nSample : Side B (excerpt)\n\nPENNY COFFIN Conscripted Morality CD (At War With False Noise) 11.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nThere is this thing going around, pretty small scale but I'm seriously hoping that it continues to spread, where bands ostensibly playing \"old school death metal\" (OSDM) are introducing industrial elements (namely Godflesh-esque grind and repetition) to their music. And I am lovin' it. I think the first band that really ground my brains to mulch with this approach was Legion of Andromeda, whose two albums and collab with Vomir are still some of the all-out heaviest and nastiest shit from the past decade of undergeround death metal, and Megascavenger came out around the same general time period with an album that veered into that direction as well. But Penny Coffin's mini-album Conscripted Morality is the most recent of these discoveries, via this 2023 CD edition from Scottish powerhouse At War With False Noise. And boy, does it scrape the bone clean.\n\nLyrics that combine religious references and excratory depravity with a vicious anti-authoritarian bent. Total negativity. Swells of cavernous, creepy guitars emerge from the underneath followed by the ring of a Tibetan-style prayer bowl and deep throat-singing; in the blink of an eye, though, that entrance on plumes of subterranean ether blasts off into the crazed death metal of \"Ballistic\", duly titled with its rigidly constructed blastbeats and shifts in precision drumming, moldy and monstrous guitar riffs and caveman bass spread out in an oilslick of gross dissonance and sudden shifts into a surprisingly grandiose doom-death riff style backed by orchestral synthesizer sounds and rotten-as-fuck vocal spew. That opener sets up an interesting contrast that continues through all four of Morality's fairly lengthy / meaty songs, balancing barbarous, stripped-down death chug and torturous slower sludginess (fronted by those totally incomprehensible gusts of verbal vomit, soaked in reverb and echo and christ knows what else) with some strikingly catchy moments of anthemic power and magesterial atmosphere that mostly come from out of left field. The old school, early 90s death metal sound is in full force, with a churning, rabid heaviness and sudden tempo changes that could wreck a bus (wait until you hear \"Predator\", good god), but the machinelike, militaristic double bass, strange electronic accompaniment, and passages of grueling looped industrial noise like the beginning of \"Slowdive\" (sounding like someone dropped a mid-80s Merzbow tape into the mix) give Penny Coffin its inhuman, unhealthy, mechanically-damaged presence that sets it apart from other \"OSDM\" outfits I'm listening to at the moment. That latter song has some of the most out-there \"noisy\" stuff on the disc, the grinding death backed up by walls of eerie tremolo-picked texture and the keyboards that at certain points have a vaguely Nocturnus-esque quality to them.\n\nThe title track likewise fuses the swirling fog of dissonant distorted menace and moments of melancholic melody, but the start-stop riffs that kick in are gargantuan, Bolt Thrower and Asphyx level chug-a-thon destruction all over the place. Pretty wicked. \"Morality\" also sports the only real guitar solo on the disc, I'm pretty sure, and the way that it drifts in and coils around the rest of the band right before they all come together into a sickeningly heavy droning breakdown awash in those soundscape elements is very well done. especially towards the climax when a whole violin section shows up and casts a mournful overcast ambience over everything, until it finally returns to those chanting monks and prayer bowl intonations. These guys definitely aren't doing anything \"technical\", but it's certainly different. A total wrecking ball, but with flourishes of something atmospheric and weird just beneath the surface level brutality. It goes without saying that I'm usually a huge fan of anything that At War With False Noise does death metal-wise.

That album demonstrated Cultic's sure hand at grinding you into dust, their sound grounded in a fetid mixture of classic 1980s heavy metal, primitive death metal, Hellhammer / Celtic Frost, and a smattering of barbaric hardcore punk. But that pummeling style was elevated by its use of electronics, weird effects and post-industrial elements, turning their already sufficiently crushing and filthy death churn into something stranger, spacier, more otherworldly, perfectly encapsulating the feel and atmosphere that emanates from the band's stunning original artwork (from drummer Rebecca Magar, a talented visual artist and the force behind the art/design house Wailing Wizard). Fiery dragons and clashing medieval armies, eldritch monoliths and sinister sorcery - Cultic's album art evoked everything that I loved about the darker fantasy novels I read in my youth, backed by atomic hammer riffs, scowling vocals, vintage synthesizers, and dark martial bombast. That album and its 2022 follow-up Of Fire and Sorcery (both released on the band's own Eleventh Key label) featured a raw assault of vaguely psychedelic mid-paced Morbid Tales-damaged deathsludge, and from the early demos through to the latest album, Cultic has followed a contorted upward trajectory into ever-heavier, more down tuned riff-laden primacy.\n\nIn 2023, the band released the two-song Seducer EP through Eleventh Key. With new bassist Andrew Harris (also of Baltimore trad doom heavyweights Alms) joining the husband-and-wife team of Brian (vocals / guitar) and Rebecca (drums) Magar, these guys sounded more embittered, lustful, and just plain violent than ever. Ancient synths and gorgeous dark ambience, ethereal female vocals, and mesmeric dungeon industrial starts off the title track, then pulls the rug out from under you as the trio lunge out of the shadows with one of their heaviest riffs ever. The awesome screams and mocking, acid-tinged roars melt into the atavistic spaced-out doom-death as \"Seducer\" lumbers through more of those killer Moogy electronics and weird effects. It's ridiculously heavy in spite off all the bizarre hallucinatory audio swirling around. Then \"Seduced\" bathes you in eve more lush, grim keyboard sounds, the most kosmische kind of dungeon synth bliss, and once again the band scatters that bleary ether when they drop into another fucking scuzzy, spine-bending hunk of slo-mo death metal . It's terrific. These two songs have better production than previous recordings, while maintaining their raw, caustic filthiness. If these two tracks are indicative of what Cultic's next album is going to be like, god help us.\n\nThis expanded version of the band's Seducer EP includes the early demo version of \"Seduced\" which has its own alternate electronic charms, and reveals a much more primitive, caveman vision of that song. Like hearing early Cathedral jamming in some rickety, oil-stained garage, soused out of their gourds on dextromethorphan. It's rad. On the B-side, this release features several bonus tracks: first is the two-song Prowler demo from 2017, recorded when the band was just the original duo of Brian and Rebecca. Their first-ever recording, previously released on a now out-of-print CDR, Prowler sounds fully formed, just more raw and low-fi, and without the electronic elements that would later develop into their current sound. These two songs are crushers, \"Cruel Orders\" and \"The Prowler\" delivering those signature dark fantasy lyrics, trippy grunting vocals, and knuckle-dragging doom-death. In addition, the EP is rounded out by a feral 2018 live recording of \"Conqueror\" that unleashes the band's full war-wrath, and circles back around with a killer live 2019 recording of \"Seducer\" that's stripped down to its bulldozing basics.\n\nNearly forty minutes of primo gargantuan Gamma World barbarian death metal. So for an \"EP\", this Crucial Blast reissue crams in the goods. It's also beautifully designed by the band themselves: Seducer boasts more of Rebecca's striking, Frazetta-esque artwork, which perfectly captures the carnal violence of this music. It's one of the coolest looking tapes we've put out over here yet. I can't express how stoked I am to be working with this band, as I've been a longtime fan of the couple's work, both Rebecca's fantastic art and Brian's previous musical dark arts in the ritual black ambient / doom-drone outfits The Owls Are Not What They Seem and Layr. Can't recommend this band enough.\n\nThe release of the expanded Seducer EP on holy analog tape is further celebrated by this bitchin' brand-new Cultic shirt design, created specifically for this release. Featuring what might be my favorite Rebecca Magar art yet, the wicked three-color \"Whip Seduction\" shirt is printed by Forest Passage Printing on black Gildan 100% cotton garments, front print only.\n\nThis item combines the Cultic Seducer (Expanded Edition) Cassette with the \"Whip Seduction\" shirt, shipped together.

A pre-causal record of seismic activity and ghost tremors from Bikini Atoll. A catalog of thermonuclear indifference and trace echoes from reconnaissance satellites, pulled from secretive CIA remote viewing sessions. A continuation of a series that stretches back all of the way to the year 2000, with the first volume appearing on the much-missed dark ambient label The Rectrix, followed by the second that showed up on Annihilvs in 2006. That stuff is some of my favorite Wilt material ever. And here we are with the third volume materializing in 2022, sixteen years on from the previous, and James P. Keeler's Wilt expands its vision of mid-to-late twentieth-century clandestine Cold War horror so much further than before, trapping you as the listener in a series of consecutive , probably chronological nightmare recordings a la Kyoto Professor Yukiyasu Kamitani, lasered into this disc and then etched into your neural web. Listening to this immense album, everything around me turns black and burnt. The fourteen pieces of near-infrasonic obliteration audio have titles that can easily lead the listener into the bottomless rabbithole of nuclear chess-play and freakish espionage that gripped our planet in decades past, but me, I'm just soaking in the sound for the moment.\n\nAnd it is bleak. Wilt is never the artist to go to if you're looking for a brighter outlook, but Jesus, he's painting the air here with irradiated charcoal and radioactive ash. And it is, as usual, perversely beautiful work. Cold War doesn't really lend itself to a track-by-track examination; each piece folds into the next to create a contiguous impression of nuclearized, totally depersonalized doom. It moves through you. Deep, endlessly deep cavernous drift spotted with clanking metallic rhythm, jittery heavy machinery moving slowly amid the shifting of pipe structures and titanic slow-motion construction work. Softly burbling synth-drones floating aimlessly around subterranean field recordings and repeating patterns of electrical waveform. Intensely atmospheric and vast-sounding, shifting and skittering noises and impossibly distant rumbling, with amorphous melodic elements phasing in and out of range. A seamless assemblage of subtle low-frequency reverberations and mechanical sound that blurs together into an oceanic mass. The mix is fantastic, with sounds and sonic events separated as to surround you completely. Immersive. Immense. Intricately crafted dark industrial ambience that works with a combo of performance pieces and found sounds, which per the album notes was put together inside two abandoned silos. It feels like you're right in there with 'em. Tape noise manipulations, rattling objects, the subliminal hum of short wave radio sound and fluorescent lighting fixtures. Bits of an actual drum kit transformed into tectonic drift generators. Circuit-bent electronics and Casio synthesizers and samplers chained together into a huge, breathing presence. Some parts of Cold War lull you into a dull haze, sprawling Lustmordian vapors buffeting your senses from every direction, and then suddenly you're sucked into an intake vent with ominous grinding noises, thick electrically-charged energy fields, ice-cold artificial tones that decompose before you, shattered mainframe computer systems gargling out indecipherable code, hypnotic loops of human panic and terror in anticipation of thermonuclear death as the ICBMs prepare for launch, and great flowing currents of blackened sine-wave nerve abuse, bursts of bizarre choral textures, stacked together into something that pushes you into increasingly oppressive, depressing, almost suffocating states of suspension. Gusts of fouled, toxic breath. Ash swirling around shadows burnt into the floor. Crushing isolationist heaviness. Crushing hopelessness. Nothing here has been touched by the sun.\n\nPhage mentions that this experience is considered \"Post war cold electronics\". I completely agree. One of Keeler's best.\n\nSORE THROAT Who Killed Gumby CASSETTE (Grind Today) 11.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nIndonesian import - small tape l;abel is reissuing and releasing some really topo-notch and sought-after scumblasts\n\nclassic blast of late 80s what-the-fuckery\n\nHere's where we get even earlier into Sore Throat's history, the band's first ever recording session, which ttook place in early 1987 in the bedroom of vocalist/bassist Rich Militia. Although you can really hear the hardcore/crossover element that these guys were diggin' in the riffs on these twenty-one songs, Who Killed Gumby is actually one of he most deranged and rabid and ICONIC \"noisecore\" recordings of its time. From the opener \"Unrelenting Terror\" through the doom-dirge crunch of \"Satan's Radish\" and closer \"The End\"'s bizarro hypno-thrash groove and riotous tin-can percussion while some toddler is hollering in the background as it all turns into an almost Hanatarashi-level earfuck, the session nukes your face with incredibly blown-the-fuck-out shit-fi thrashcore , the metallic guitar sound so trebly and buzzsaw-0sharp that tyou feel like it could cut right through you, tetanus-threat , but from there Gumby takes the idea behuind Napalm Death's \"You Suffer\" and extrapolates it into a berserk spew of mach-10 hardcore riffs and shapeless distorted guitar /drum splat, the drumming sounding like someone is banging on a cookie tin in the background, filthy septic distortion and demented guitar solos and puke-ready guttural grunts and almost unidentifiable bass-muck all splattered in every direction. This is some of the most primitive noisecore ever, improvised and out of its mind, total blurr insanity, with quick yelps and jokey jibes scattered throuygh it al;l; And then you get something like \"N-OI-Se\", which starts off with a killer catchy hardcore riff, teasing you with a semblance of a hook, but then goes ultra-haywire with everybody going in different directions before finally coming back to that hook, while \"I.C.I. Fuck Off And Die\" bangs out a wicked thrashcore riff and disgusting vocal vomit; at two and a half minutes, it's a veritable epic comared to the rest of the tracks, but halfway through it, like its companions, collapses for a mid-section of total clunking noise amd random instrumental abuse. That \"drumming\" I mentioned? It's absurd - it's metallic clatter, not sounding like a drum kit at all\n\nthis is where so many noisecore bands would develop their energy from, but at the time this was absolutely avant-garde nonsense\n\nmixed up with assaults of bone-crunching mid-tempo riffing that, for a moment, could be mistaken for early Celtic Frost collaborating with Hanatarash.\n\nDadaistic hardcore / metal / noise pushed to the absolute limit of comprehension, and beyond\n\n\"Holocaust\" sounding closer to the extrme chaos of the contemporaneous Kapanese noise underground\n\nIt's all hilariously funny to me, and the idea that this led to a record deal with a label like Earache bends my mine\n\nthe most raw recording I've ever heard from Sore Throat\n\nThe B-side has a 1998 performance from Cardiff, UK, soundboard recording, big mix of songs from throughtout their existence as well as loads of their typical joking around, over-the-top apelike vocalizations, bumbling crusty heaviosity. It's raw and awesomely burly, running about half an hour, the audience is cleaely having a blast, is clearly sauced up quite nicely, and sounds like they are already in the midst of damaging some things, at the very least each other.. and the energy of a moshpit virtually wafts off od this side of the tape. A killer, blow-out and appropriately low-fidelity recording captures this stream-of-stench, banging their way from barbaric Frostian crustmetal to insane hypersonic grindcore to brief fuckaround reggae jamming to maelstroms of total improvised blurr destruction and straight-up mockeries of Napalm Death. Even though I can't understand one goddamn word they are saying, this is one of the best live documents of Sore Throat I've heard.\n\nINCANTATION Sect Of Vile Divinities CD (Relapse) 11.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nCAUCHEMAR La Vierge Noire CD (Nuclear War Now!

The vivid, vaguely grotesque sleeve art (courtesy of Pablo Savant) seems to aim towards the at-that-point exploding \"alternative rock\" in the mainstream music industry\n\nrecorded and released the same year as the band's Be Careful What You Wish For album\n\nI'm guessing that this song takes its name from the alternate title to Andrea Bianchi (Burial Ground's 1972 horror film aka What the Peeper Saw; the guys in Ramleh are certainly no novices when it comes to vintage Euro-horror.\n\nWhistles and squeals and mayhem strays through the atavistic Stooges/Hawkwind/noise rock adjulation of \"Night Hair Child (Empathy For K.C.)\"; this slightly more musical-minded compared to some opf the other sonic barbarism that Ramleh were spewing in the 1990-1995 era, but it's still waaay out there screamin' towards the KHYBER BEL:T< spaced-out electronics and dundering punk riffs blasted with some incredibly vibrant drumming that's all over the place, heavy and howling and completely freaked out neo-noise-damaged-psych-thud, working it's way down to a simple two-chord riff that just pounds you straight into the soft earth for awhile. Gloriously fucked up.\n\nBut \"Dicey Opera\" gets into the creepzone with some angusihd film dialogue leading you into a greyhaze sonic swamp of buzzing high-voltage electronics, rumbling incoherent sludge, effects-drenched feedback freakouts that shoot straight into the ionosphere. Slower and more abstract, this one does a pretty good job of matching the vibe of Pablo's gnarly apocalyptic sleeve art, freeform nuke-charred psychnoise smeared over monstrous slow-mo aleatory drumming and explorative guitar skree, all of this coalescing into a six-minute long dark and roiling ckloud of pre-millenial dread that traisl off into the wasteland.\n\nGASP Sore For Days (Demo 96) CD (Dark Symphonies) 12.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nGRAVESIDESERVICE Resurrection Cemetery CD (Church of the Immaculate Deception) 7.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nNUCLEAR DEATH The Planet Cachexial CD (Cats Meow) 14.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nCAVE IN Until Your Heart Stops (REISSUE) CASSETTE (Relapse) 9.99\n\nADD TO CARTTrack Samples: Sample : Halo Of Flies\n\nSample : Moral Eclipse\n\nSample : The End Of Our Rope Is A Noose\n\nCELTIC FROST Morbid Tales (Deluxe Reissue) CD DIGIBOOK (Noise) 14.99\n\nMorbid Tales (Deluxe Reissue) IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE FOR ORDER\n\nSUBROSA For This We Fought The Battle Of Ages CD (Profound Lore) 13.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nGORGUTS From Wisdom To Hate (2019 Reissue) CD (Punishment 18 Records) 17.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nThis Italian import of the latest From Wisdom To Hate CD reissue took long enough to make it over here to the USA, but I finally nabbed some. Released by the reissue-heavy Punishment 18 Records, which I've fast become fond of: for whatever weird reason that the big metal labels are letting their catalog go completely out of print on physical media, Punishment 18 and its companion label MDD Records are doing the lord's work by releasing some great, high-quality reissues of avant-metal necessities like Solefald's In Harmonia Universali, Eyehategod's Dopesick, several Orphaned Land albums, and even Gorguts' other classic, Obscura.\n\n‎\n\nThe packaging is a foldout twelve-panel poster cover, and includes Luc Lemay's previous liner notes for Hate from the 2014 reissues.\n\nHere's my older write-up for the disc:\n\nThis is the fourth and last album that Gorguts put out before the band went on an indefinite hiatus in 2001 that just let up this past year when the French Canadian metallers reconvened with a new lineup that included members of Dysrhythmia and Behold The Arctopus, and was the follow-up to their career-defining masterpiece Obscura, still one of the most challenging, avant-garde death metal albums of all time. Everyone wondered how Gorguts could follow up the bizarre, ultra-dissonant alien death metal of that album, and in response the band came back with something that was part Obscura, and part old school Gorguts, dialing down some of the over-the-top skronk and atonal riff weirdness while reinstating some of the sound of their technical early 90's albums The Erosion of Sanity and Considered Dead; the result is not as challenging and far-out as the previous album, but it's still a fantastic combination of their avant-garde skronk and crushing death metal riffage.\n\nFrom Wisdom To Hate is loaded with convoluted time signatures, those trademark discordant guitar chords and off-kilter dissonance, the scrapes and squeals and bizarre riff structures. The songs are assembled in strange, complex arrangements that are generally far outside of what you'd expect out of typical death metal. Angular interlaced riffs often shift and repeat over and over, like on the mind-warping atonal deathblast of opener \"Inverted\", and the jarring, doom-laden insanity of \"Behave Through Mythos\". Compared to Obscura, however, the vocals are less extreme, with frontman / mastermind Luc Lemay delivering a deeper, more guttural vocal style compared to the psychotic wheezing screams that he emitted on the previous record.\n\nAlso of note is the lengthy \"The Quest For Equilibrium\", which combines some great eerie keyboards and echoing gongs that produce a strange sort of modern-classical ambience that leads into one of the album's more doom-laden moments; that sort of nod to modern composition is something that we'd hear even more of after the band started releasing newer music on Season Of Mist. Overall, though, it's a slightly more straightforward and song-focused album than its predecessor, and an essential disc for Gorguts fans (and anyone into extreme tech/prog death).\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : GORGUTS-From Wisdom To Hate (2019 Reissue)\n\nSample : GORGUTS-From Wisdom To Hate (2019 Reissue)\n\nCARPENTER, JOHN FireStarter (Original Soundtrack - BLACK VINYL) LP (Sacred Bones) 21.00\n\nADD TO CART\n\nMERZBOW Tauromachine (2023 Reissue) 2 x CD (Relapse) 14.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nINTEGRITY Those Who Fear Tomorrow (2022 Edition) CASSETTE (Relapse) 9.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nVARIOUS ARTISTS Leper Creativity: Cyclonopedia Symposium BOOK (TRADE PAPERBACK) (Punctum Books) 23.00\n\nADD TO CART\n\nPERTURBATOR The Uncanny Valley 2 x LP (Blood Music) 30.00\n\nThe Uncanny Valley IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE FOR ORDER\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : The Uncanny Valley\n\nSample : Disco Inferno\n\nSample : Venger\n\nBISHARA, JOSEPH Insidious Chapter 3 (OST) CD (Void Recordings) 14.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nBack in stock.\n\nThe latest foray into horrific soundscapes from composer Joseph Bishara, this new score follows his third time constructing the frightening sonic backdrop to the popular Insidious series, which has updated the \"family under assault by demonic forces\" storyline first seen in Poltergeist to a modern, more unsettling setting. A former member of the early 90s industrial metal outfit Drown, Joseph Bishara has made a name for himself in recent years as the go-to guy for some of the better horror films currently coming out of Hollywood, drawing from the atonal modern classical music of composers like Ligeti, Crumb and Penderecki and combining that influence with contemporary electronic and experimental textures to create some of the creepiest film music being made right now. I was already a fan of Bishara's previous scores for the Insidious films, The Conjuring and Dark Skies, but the direction he would take for this new project was particularly enticing. For his score to the third installment in the Insidious series of films, Bishara teamed up with legendary metal drummer Dave Lombardo (Slayer, Fantomas) and pianist/composer Saar Hendelman to create these jet-black soundscapes, which is featured on this album as twenty-two tracks that plunge into a nightmarish sonic realm of low, rumbling percussive sound and distant ostinato strings giving way to violent, shocking blasts of orchestral dissonance, quieter sections where those muted strings drift hazily over minimal piano, or dissipate into abyssal dronescapes; violins are manipulated and molested, producing sickening glissando notes that slither and writhe through cloudy masses of low-end electronics and reverberating metallic noise; ghostly atonal melodies slip in and out of view, drifting out of the void to reveal themselves in brief glimpses before being swallowed up again in the blackness; murky electronic rhythms bubble in the depths of the mix, looping patterns that seethe on the periphery; and there are sequences of stygian ambience here that rival anything you'll find on labels like Malignant or Cyclic Law.\n\nLike most of my favorite scores, the sudden blasts of volume and intensity make for a terrifying listen even when separated from the film's demonic imagery, which reaches a feverish intensity whenever Lombardo's abstract drumming enters the fray, often appearing in controlled bursts of rumbling percussive sound that punctuate the louder, shocking eruptions of those fearsome strings, or producing slow, sinister swells of cymbal washing over quick, improvisational flurries of drumming; it's an exercise in skillful tension building, even the more emotionally poignant moments of Bishara's score seem to have a lingering sense of dread, like the haunting, lyrical \"Questions Left Behind\" and the gorgeously moody \"Friendly Face\"; utilizes sleek modern composition and experimental techniques, there's a definite post-industrial tinge to this music. One of the better modern horror scores, in the same terrifying league as Roque Banos's fantastic Evil Dead score. Comes in gatefold packaging.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : BISHARA, JOSEPH-Insidious Chapter 3 (OST)\n\nSample : BISHARA, JOSEPH-Insidious Chapter 3 (OST)\n\nSample : BISHARA, JOSEPH-Insidious Chapter 3 (OST)\n\nGOST Non Paradisi CD (Blood Music) 14.99\n\nNon Paradisi IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE FOR ORDER\n\nVOIVOD Forgotten In Space 5 x CD (Noise) 51.00\n\nADD TO CART\n\nTROLLER Graphic LP (Holodeck) 19.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nBack in stock.\n\nAfter a nearly four year wait, this doom-laden darkwave outfit from Austin, TX has finally returned with the follow-up to their acclaimed eponymous debut. It was there that the band introduced their lush, lugubrious sound combining heavy synths, slow-motion rhythms and haunting vocal melodies, woven into infectious, brooding blasts of darkpop perfection; the songs seemed to emanate from some cavernous subterranean chamber, drenched in reverb and surrounded by shorter pieces of bleak ambience and grinding noise. A sinister, often abrasive edge gleamed from that early material, but it also featured some of the most stunning darkwave anthems we'd heard in ages. And with their first proper full-length album, Troller have expanded on that sound even further, their sensuous, dread-filled pop encrusted with those huge, otherworldly synths and distorted, grinding bass roar, rumbling across crawling drum machines and washes of glacial Carpenterian electronics, gorgeously gloomy synthpop hooks gleaming in the dimly lit corners of Graphic, as Amber Goers' soulful, utterly bewitching vocals once again haunt Troller's tenebrous depths. Songs like \"Not Here\", \"Torch\" and \"Storm Maker\" shimmer with a malevolent majesty, while elsewhere the album slips into nightmarish electronic ambience and stunning expanses of black kosmische bliss. And while the band's noisier tendencies are more subdued this time around, there are still surges of corrosive sound throughout Graphic that materialize in dense feedback and jagged chords that are juxtaposed with the album's more beautiful passages. Combined with their penchant for provocative imagery and apocalyptic undercurrents, this produces something far bleaker and more unsettling than anything else we're hearing in the realm of industrial-damaged darkwave right now.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : TROLLER-Graphic\n\nSample : TROLLER-Graphic\n\nSample : TROLLER-Graphic\n\nBOHREN & DER CLUB OF GORE Black Earth 2 x LP (PIAS Recordings) 28.98\n\nBlack Earth IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE FOR ORDER\n\nEND Nightmare Visions CD (Epic Recordings) 16.98\n\nADD TO CARTTrack Samples: Sample : Corpse Fucker\n\nSample : Human Flesh\n\nSample : Meat Wagon\n\nLANDLORDS, THE Fitzgerald's Paris LP (Feel It Records) 18.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nTERMINAL CHEESECAKE Dandelion Sauce Of The Ancients LP (Box Records) 24.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nNow sold out from the source.\n\nWasn't expecting to see a new album from these guys in 2016. Part of the same twisted UK noise/psych/sludge rock scene that brought us the likes of Godflesh, Fall Of Because, Skullflower (with whom they shared a member), God, and Sweet Tooth, Terminal Cheesecake were a weirder, noisier outfit heavily steeped in the din of classic psychedelia, but enfolded it within a crush of distorted guitars, sludgy riffage and blown-out mayhem that could really fry your frontal lobe. But these guys hung it up around the mid-1990s, their last album King Of All Spaceheads coming out back in 1994, and as the years have worn on, their stuff has become harder and harder to track down for collectors. It's great to hear 'em back in action, though, and their new album Ancients sounds heavy as hell, no surprise seeing as how they now have Dave Cochrane (God, Greymachine, Head Of David, Ice, Sweet Tooth, Transitional) handling bass duties. In fact, I'm trying to remember when these guys ever sounded quite this heavy. When the opener \"Birds In 6/8\" kicks in, that distorted bass comes in lurching blasts of low-end crunch, digging in with a mean hypno-riff as those echoing vocals and hypnotic drums and squalls of spaced-out guitar noise and Hawkwindian FX are splooged across the track. Pummeling and aggressive, that opener puts a neon-dyed boot right through your skull. And from there the album proceeds to slide further down the lysergic abyss, guitars exploding into fuzz-drenched serpentine riffage, molten chords turning black and gooey as they glom together into walls of gargantuan sludge, an arsenal of effects pedals all cranked to eleven, vocals echoing and shrieking and yelping through the cosmic haze. It's like some monstrous melding of Butthole Surfers and drugged-out, dundering doom metal on some of these tracks, the drumming shiofting between pounding tribal rhythms and slugfuck pummel, weird samples littered throughout the songs, the riffs primitive and droning. On \"Song For John Pt 1\", the band lumbers through a crushing psych-groove that sounds like a roid-raging Loop jam before it goes supernova in a blast of speaker-melting psychdrone, and the closer \"Lord Jagged (The Chemical Teacake Quintet)\" brings it all crashing down with a whacked-out assault of improvised free-rock violence.\n\nWIND HEARSE Trident 10\" VINYL (Klaxon) 17.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nSAMHAIN Live 1984: Stardust Ballroom DVD (Evilive / MVD) 14.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nGREAT KAT, THE Mozart, Beethoven, Bach And Shred CD (TPR Music) 11.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nAh, 2021. When the floodgates of the Great Kat Deluge truly and fully blew open, washing over us with over twenty-four different releases that year. And also when my Kat addiction went full-blown. There had been an almost ten-year break since the hyper-manic virtuoso's last release, and this new Covid-era resurgence brought us an interesting new twist on the Kat Attack. I'm pretty sure that Mozart, Beethoven, Bach And Shred was the first of that year's batch, and found the Shred Goddess adopting a more tongue-in-cheek look and approach, infusing her wild instrumental madness with a silly, almost Nick Zedd-esque fetish flick aesthetic and an absurdist sense of humor that pairs with her music nicely. Like almost all of her recent releases, this is a short EP (although Kat refers to these discs as \"albums\") that crams a ridiculous amount of neo-classical guitar shred into a short run time (this one coming in at just over twelve minutes), and even as short as it is, it's still a total sensory overload. In true Kat fashion, it's self-described as \"the most genius album The Great Kat has ever released!. It's something else, that's for sure.\n\nI still stand by my assessment that The Great Kat is textbook \"outsider metal\". The Juilliard trained virtuoso violinist (real name Katherine Thomas) appears to have no time for anything else going on in the realm of \"metal\", and seems to exist in her own unique sui generis bubble of boisterous, hyperbolic classical-influenced blast. Adapting the compositions of Baroque and Romantic-era classics by Beethoven, Bach, Vivaldi and Mozart to a kind of primitive speed metal backbone; this stuff is definitely the ultimate in ADD-afflicted speedshock. These aren't merely \"covers\" of the original symphonic pieces; rather, The Great Kat re-imagines them as screeching, hyperspeed shredfests where the central melody sits at the core of severely distorted guitars, rapid-fire violin, and a rhythm section that powers some of the songs into an almost industrialized thrash. For instance, \"Beethoven's Moonlight Mosh \" is a darkly romantic translation of the score for a volley of metal-as-fuck guitar solos, dipping into screaming dissonance. But \"Mozart's The Marriage Of Figaro Overture\" unleashes that weirdly mechanized speed metal assault while Kat goes ballistic on the guitar, layering her multitude of violin shred and biting guitar riffs over spastic, mecha-orchestral percussion that turns into a storm of blastbeats, while the original string arrangements soar overhead like a stream of ICBM missiles. It's insane. It's awesome. Likewise, \"Bach's Air On The G String Mosh\" marries layer upon layer of romantic melody over a grinding slo-mo doom metal backbeat. The melody of \"Rimsky-Korsakov's The Flight Of The Bumble-Bee \" is instantly recognizable, but this is even more berserk, with blasting drums that sound like they came off a raw black metal demo. The tempo on \"Vivaldi's The Four Seasons” is pure thrash metal, heavy and aggro, the drumming sounding much more organic here, while the violin and guitars trade off licks back and forth; it's also the EPs longest song, at just over two minutes. She slows the pace for \"Beethoven Mosh 2\" to transform it into a mid-paced chug, heavy palm-muted riffing backing the lovely central hook, which ultimately ends up sounding like some metallized 1950's pop song. And closer \"Paganini's Moto Perpetuo For Guitar And Violin” returns to the solo guitar / violin madness that kicked it all off, a barrage of speed-picking, whammy-bar abuse, and rapid-fire fret board runs that melts together into a frenzy of counterpoint melodies and borderline cacophony.\n\nCompletely bonkers. It's all purely instrumental, like most of her recent recordings. The production is raw and abrasive, which makes hearing these classical pieces sound even more berserk, especially when they are crammed into these ninety-second blasts of speed and shred. You either grok it or you don't - I'm terminally addicted to The Great Kat's unique classical blast-shred, and even moreso on the DVDs that she produces that incorporates insane can-can dancing routines and seizure-inducing video edits. It's unreal.

The band members for this project purportedly claimed to be of Martian origin themselves, though checking out their entry in Metal-Archives.com reveal suspiciously German-soubding names for the trio, also printed on the back of the album. They definioterly\\ play the Martian Warfare concept straight here, though. Even on their Archive page there's little other infortmation to be found, the booklet is just a collage of strange otherworldly hues and images attached to each of the four songs, and from start to finish this disc delivers you into a hostile and magnificent blastscape of epic, operatic proportions. Themed around a violent Martian takeover and apparent terraforming of planet Earth, these guys whip up a wild frenzy of industrial, symphonic, electronic and experimental spasms that emanate from a rigid black metal attack that moves at supersonic tempos. It's all drenched in an odd, futuristic-seeming atmosphere, even though the metal is obviously influenced by the greats of the Norwegian second-wave; the sound is informed by Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk-era Emperor, Arcturus, and maybe even Mayhem's then-new Grand Declaration of War.\n\nWith the title track dropping titanic martial snares, helicopters flying overhead, ominous dissonant strings, military artillery, screaming voices, and clashes of orchestral bombast, Mars gets right into the dreadful chaos of a hideous warzone, layiong out this bleak soundscape before the EP rips into the bleeping insanity of \"Planets\". That's where this gets really odd, as old-school science-fiction film electronic effects and industrialized clang are tasken over by a mechanical black metal assault, weird time signatures writhing under the scorched, off-kilter riffs, the rumbling double bass sounding like it might have been programmed, the singer's reptilian scowl delivering what I imagine are hateful declarations from the Martian warmachine delivered in German, the song dropping in and out as weird proggy bass guitar runs emerge along with electronic beats and abstract percussive grooves. The whole thing has this hulking, alien awkwardness going on, and then the X-Files-esque synthesizer melodies start to take over (not kidding). Actually, this whole disc is loaded with killer synthesizer craziness, lots of Moogy gurgle and prog-style wigouts, usually appearing as a weird non-sequitur amid the mechanized symphonic black metal. The other two tracks blend more martial drumming, short passages of Laibach / In Slaughter Natives style industrial might, soundtracky samples, portentious tolling bells, some very cool sung vocal parts (some of which stretch out for awhile to dramatic effect), and blasts of utterly spaced-out lunacy with what turns into some seriously heavy riffing (especially on the technoid monstrosity \"Die Stadt Ist Im Krieg\"). It's truly \"cyber war music\". There's sort of a similiar surreal spirit as Dodheimsgard's experimental stuff. Pity that they didn't do anything after this, I would have loved to have heard more of their bizarre experimental black metal and see it evolve and coalesce into what is clearly a pretty unique creative vision.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : Bleeding Underwater\n\nSample : Die Stadt Ist Im Krieg\n\nSample : Planets\n\nSUBTERRANEAN SOURCE Relic CD (Desolation House) 9.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nAnother acquisition from the remaining Desolation House catalog, which produced some iof the heaviest, darkest, and most metal-adjacent post-industrial music of the early 2000's. Subterranean Source was one of the heaviest and most malevolent-sounding artists to appear in that series, with 2008's Relic delivering an excellent and immersive descent into bleak and doom-laden ambient sound that any and all fanatics of Cryo Chamber / Cyclic Law / Malignant should be experiencing as soon as possible. The second of three albums from Italian composer Andrea Bellucci, this project grows more claustophobic and mephitic with time, and these five lengthy tracks surround you in slinking shadows and cavernous murk for fifty minutes; it's an inescapable listen, dense and oppressive sound swirling and blooming and wilting in almost complete and total darkness.\n\nWe drown fast in a slow-creeping fog of distant metallic clank and percussive rustling, sudden gasps of impaled choir voices, billowing black wind coming in from every diection at once, the thirteen-mi9nute opener \"Pagan Moon\" sprawling out around you like field recordings of a fire ritual held in an abandoed warehouse. The air is thick with activity, Bellucci colors thick within his lines of ambient form, shifting the sound constantly and adjusting the harshness of his textures, every few minutes introducing new elements like murky rhythmic loops, spectral and chantlike groans seeping up from deep below, the sound warping at some m,oments into a fetid mixture of Yen Pox's magnified blood-drones and Autechre-esque abstraction. That particular ability is one of Subterranean Source's signature moves, and distinguishes the project from much of the \"dark ambient\" underworld that it is generally grouped in. Just that first track shows a creepy complexity and rhythmic strategy that sets it apart from the dire, minimalist droneology of Lustmord, early Zoviet France, Gruntsplatter, and Lull. It's just as creepy and atmopsheric as any of that stuff though, as chilly and deeply reverberant as thhe early 90's \"isolationists\" and as evocative and occulted as the \"ritual ambient\" set; there's a good reason why Subterranean Source has enjoyed a varied following amongst underground electronic / ambient enthusiasts despite having released only three albums through its twenty-year existence.\n\nThe other four tracks making up Relic are a continuing descent into shadow and hypogeal movement. It's just immense, evoking these vast vistas of hollow-earth ceremonial sites and tectonic movements, metal scraping against metal while oblique bits of melody churn in the background. Sounds woven into repeating motifs and physical rhythms that suck you into this massive rumbling dronescape. Ghostly rasping and hushed whispers quickly come and go, while those oh-so-vague melodic elements start to reveal themselves as fragments of orchestral strings and mournful horns launched into the void. Deep monk-like chants surface briefly, then obliterated by waves of cavernous reverrberation. Roars of unseen, gargantuan machines toiling in the deep. Shimmers of sharp metallic sound rings out loudly over surges of electronic grime and more mysterious, inscrutable voices. Garbled electronics and delay-damaged rattlings tumble through what must be cold, fetid air. While i wouldn't say that Relic sounds evil, it is definitely a serious creepout, every moment of Bellucci's incredibly dense soundcraft emanting utter darkness and shadow, making them an almost living presence. Like his other albums, which are every bit as ominous and chilling as this, the shifting world of subterranean ambience feels like an event unfolding before your senses, becoming more hallucinatory with each passing moment. Consuming you. Dissolving you.\n\nI mean, if you're the type who's entranced by the ritualuistic, impressionistic ambient sound of artists like Funerary Call, Herbst9, the Aural Hypnox artists out of Finland, Zero Kama, etc., I really can't recommend this enough.\n\nAnd play it loud.\n\nCOME TO GRIEF The Worst Of Times LP (Fuck Yoga) 21.00\n\nADD TO CART\n\nNIGHT FEEDER (1988) BLU-RAY (SRS Retro (Sub Rosa)) 24.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nCULT OF YOUTH With Open Arms CD (Hospital Productions) 26.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nPOISON RUIN Harvest CASSETTE + 3\" CDR (Relapse) 9.99\n\nHarvest IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE FOR ORDER\n\nDISCORDANCE AXIS The Inalienable Dreamless (Reissue) LP + 7\" (Willowtip) 31.00\n\nADD TO CART\n\nENSLAVED Hordanes Land (BRONZE AND BLACK VINYL) LP (By Norse Music) 39.99\n\nADD TO CARTTrack Samples: Sample : Slaget I Skogen Bortenfor (Epilog / Slaget)\n\nSample : ��A l l f �� r O � i n n\n\nSample : Enslaved (Bonus Track)\n\nCULTIC Seducer (Expanded Edition) ( XXL ) SHIRT + CASSETTE BUNDLE (Crucial Blast) 30.00\n\nADD TO CART\n\nDark Dungeon Metal Overdrive!\n\nMan, I was immediately obsessed with Cultic as soon as I heard 'em; their 2019 debut album High Command stomped me into the dirt with its visions of dark epic fantasy and primal death/doom. That album demonstrated Cultic's sure hand at grinding you into dust, their sound grounded in a fetid mixture of classic 1980s heavy metal, primitive death metal, Hellhammer / Celtic Frost, and a smattering of barbaric hardcore punk. But that pummeling style was elevated by its use of electronics, weird effects and post-industrial elements, turning their already sufficiently crushing and filthy death churn into something stranger, spacier, more otherworldly, perfectly encapsulating the feel and atmosphere that emanates from the band's stunning original artwork (from drummer Rebecca Magar, a talented visual artist and the force behind the art/design house Wailing Wizard). Fiery dragons and clashing medieval armies, eldritch monoliths and sinister sorcery - Cultic's album art evoked everything that I loved about the darker fantasy novels I read in my youth, backed by atomic hammer riffs, scowling vocals, vintage synthesizers, and dark martial bombast. That album and its 2022 follow-up Of Fire and Sorcery (both released on the band's own Eleventh Key label) featured a raw assault of vaguely psychedelic mid-paced Morbid Tales-damaged deathsludge, and from the early demos through to the latest album, Cultic has followed a contorted upward trajectory into ever-heavier, more down tuned riff-laden primacy.\n\nIn 2023, the band released the two-song Seducer EP through Eleventh Key. With new bassist Andrew Harris (also of Baltimore trad doom heavyweights Alms) joining the husband-and-wife team of Brian (vocals / guitar) and Rebecca (drums) Magar, these guys sounded more embittered, lustful, and just plain violent than ever. Ancient synths and gorgeous dark ambience, ethereal female vocals, and mesmeric dungeon industrial starts off the title track, then pulls the rug out from under you as the trio lunge out of the shadows with one of their heaviest riffs ever. The awesome screams and mocking, acid-tinged roars melt into the atavistic spaced-out doom-death as \"Seducer\" lumbers through more of those killer Moogy electronics and weird effects. It's ridiculously heavy in spite off all the bizarre hallucinatory audio swirling around. Then \"Seduced\" bathes you in eve more lush, grim keyboard sounds, the most kosmische kind of dungeon synth bliss, and once again the band scatters that bleary ether when they drop into another fucking scuzzy, spine-bending hunk of slo-mo death metal . It's terrific. These two songs have better production than previous recordings, while maintaining their raw, caustic filthiness. If these two tracks are indicative of what Cultic's next album is going to be like, god help us.\n\nThis expanded version of the band's Seducer EP includes the early demo version of \"Seduced\" which has its own alternate electronic charms, and reveals a much more primitive, caveman vision of that song. Like hearing early Cathedral jamming in some rickety, oil-stained garage, soused out of their gourds on dextromethorphan. It's rad. On the B-side, this release features several bonus tracks: first is the two-song Prowler demo from 2017, recorded when the band was just the original duo of Brian and Rebecca. Their first-ever recording, previously released on a now out-of-print CDR, Prowler sounds fully formed, just more raw and low-fi, and without the electronic elements that would later develop into their current sound. These two son"
