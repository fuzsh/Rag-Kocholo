        "text": "Fire Down Below's New Album Low Desert Surf Club Drops Friday\n\nFormed in Ghent (Belgium) in 2015, Fire Down Below first stepped into the spotlight with their self-released debut album Viper Vixen Goddess Saint in 2016. The album quickly garnered international praise and caught our attention. We re-released VVGS worldwide and released its sophomore album Hymn of the Cosmic Man in 2018. The second album again received excellent feedback and Fire Down Below played over 30 shows throughout Europe in the next year. Album three, Low Desert Surf Club, was recorded in late 2022. The band sought and found a producer in Nick DiSalvo, famed frontman of the bands Elder and Delving. Richard Behrens (Samsara Blues Experiment, Big Snuff Studio Berlin) was added to the team to record and mix the nine tracks on the album. Low Desert Surf Club will be released on 8 September 2023.

The first hurdle of any tribute album is avoiding the obvious (Sabbath, Lizzy, Purple etc) picking an artist well known but not covered to point of saturation. So, Credit to Ripple Music A whip smart choice of a tribute and overall executed with style. With Burn on the Bayou the first hurdle has been easily jumped.
