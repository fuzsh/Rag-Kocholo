        "text": "Tyler the Creator made headlines this week in regard to his sexuality on his new album Scum Fuck Flower Boy.\n\nThe album was set to be released on July 21, but was leaked ahead of its release date. The controversial rapper released his last album Cherry Bomb in 2015. Prior to the leak, Tyler had already released two tracks from the album—Who Dat Boy and 911/Mr. Lonely.\n\nTyler tweeted this out in 2015,\n\nSpeculation and buzz continues to circulate around Tyler’s album; specifically towards the songs I Ain’t Got Time and The Garden Shed. However, this is certainly not the first time Tyler has brought up the discussion of sexuality. Last year, Kendall Jenner responded to a tweet the 26-year-old sent her saying, “Apparently we’re dating,” he said: “NOT POSSIBLE, WE’RE BOTH GAY.” Last summer, Tyler also posted a drawing of a rainbow colored man peeking out of a closet with a speech bubble saying: “IS IT SAFE?”\n\nThe release of this album and discussion of sexuality is not a surprise to many people. Yet, many question whether the rapper is simply speaking about himself, or speaking in a general matter. Below are lyrics to a couple of tracks which are the gaining attention of fans all over.\n\nScum Fuck Flower Boy track, I Ain’t Got Time:\n\n“Next line I’ll have em’ like woah / I’ve been kissing white boys since 2004.”\n\nScum Fuck Flower Boy track, The Garden Shed:\n\n“Them feelings I was guardin’ / Heavy on my mind / All my friends lost / They couldn’t read the signs / I didn’t wanna talk and tell ’em my location / And they ain’t wanna walk / Truth is, since a youth kid, thought it was a phase / Thought it’d be like the Frank; poof, gone / But, it’s still goin’ on.”\n\nScum Fuck Flower Boy track, Foreword:\n\n“Shout-out to the girls that I lead on / For occasional head and always keeping my bed warm / And trying they hardest to keep my head on straight.”\n\nThe release of Tyler’s album comes on the five-year anniversary of Frank Ocean’s album Channel Orange. Do you think this is a coincidence? We think not. Prior to the release of Frank album, he published a letter describing an unreciprocated love between himself and another man during his teenage years. During that time period, Tyler expressed how proud he was of Ocean in a tweet he sent out on Twitter.\n\nIn an interview with Larry King in 2014, Tyler was asked whether he believes we will ever have a “gay rap artist,” Tyler replied: “Maybe one day…but why does that shit matter? Like, if he wanna fuck dudes or whatever, why does that matter? Why do we care? That’s so crazy right?”\n\nOne thing we all know is that Tyler is one to express himself as he pleases without letting what others have to say affect him.\n\nLet us know your thoughts on Twitter @emceenetwork and @beautyisacyn"
