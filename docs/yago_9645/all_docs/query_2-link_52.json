        "text": "After being targeted with positive discrimination measures in housing in 1970s and 80s, the Finnish Roma not only live in the same areas than the majority Finns but also wish to “live well” according to majority populations’ norms. This means preferring to live in settled contemporary housing with nuclear families, further away from rest of their kin, and to work from ‘nine until five’ in the waged labour market. On the contrary, English Gypsies and Irish Travellers in England continue to be subjected to assimilation that is institutionally racist, and therefore, in contrast to the individualism preferring Finnish Roma, are and often wish to be, highly segregated from the wider English society. They prefer (although are rarely allowed) to live on caravan sites with their extended family groups while being self-employed. Since their lifestyle is perceived as ‘deviant’, they are discriminated and face racism in all levels of the English society, which in turn decreases their well-being. Although assimilation into majority population’s lifestyle has increased Finnish Roma’s socio-economic well-being, it has not eradicated racism and discrimination against them. Therefore, racism against Roma and the travelling people cannot be explained merely with ‘culture as choice’ theory but rather with ‘culture as nature’ or as ‘Romaphobia’.\n\nGypsies and Travellers in England have historically been policed as a 'problem' to settled communities. Because of the lack of space provided to accommodate them their most likely sort of contact with statutory agencies has been in the context of their eviction from land deemed unsuitable for them to stay on or develop. At the same time however, there has been some recent recognition that Gypsies and Travellers are victims of hate crime. This has meant that statutory agencies have been increasingly required to engage with Gypsies and Travellers to provide support and guide them about their victimisation. This chapter considers how Gypsies and Travellers have experienced this dual approach by statutory agencies, particularly in relation to their encounters with the police. Thereby, the chapter addresses the extent to which it is possible for policing to ensure Gypsies and Travellers are supported as victims of crime while being dealt with as illegal campers and thus offenders themselves. In order to understand better the tension between the conflicting demands on the police in their management of Gypsies and Travellers as offenders and victims, the chapter addresses the underpinning factors that determine these experiences. These factors are their accommodation status and their perceived identity; coterminous factors that inform each other and create spatial boundaries between settled communities and Gypsies and Travellers. The chapter initially sets out the research completed in order to present the discussion herein. It then goes on to reflect on the position of Gypsies and Travellers as offenders. It does so by outlining legislation and policy that determines accommodation provision for Gypsies and Travellers, Gypsy and Traveller accommodation requirements and the consequent extent of illegal encampment. Further, it considers the policing experiences of Gypsies and Travellers as illegal campers. The chapter then goes on to consider the hate victimisation of Gypsies and Travellers, their reporting of such problems, or lack thereof, and their experiences of support and guidance from the police in this area.\n\nThis dissertation aims to develop an understanding of the representation of Irish Travellers in the media and in public and political discourse, with a particular focus on local authorities and site provision. Media analysis concentrating on coverage of the Dale Farm eviction of 2011 demonstrates how Travellers are portrayed in a narrow, stereotypical fashion, often with reference to conflict, cost and criminality. Irish Traveller ethnicity itself is questioned in many newspapers, while representations of the group tend to focus on negative characteristics portrayed as inherent to the ‘Traveller identity’. Travellers in the UK suffer not just from negative portrayals in the media, but also from a chronic lack of suitable housing. Local authorities, like the press, represent Travellers in a negative manner, focusing on unauthorised sites and violations of planning law in order to depict the group as law-‐breaking outsiders. A case study on Dale Farm demonstrates the simplistic, adverse portrayal of Travellers by local politicians, and their attempts to represent a complex housing situation as a simple matter of ‘right versus wrong’. Settled residents’ attitudes to new Travellers’ sites is the third focus of the dissertation. Resistance by local populations is an established barrier to adequate housing for Travellers, as local officials are susceptible to electoral pressure and often avoid making unpopular decisions. A case study focusing on a recently built site in Essex reveals that the same negative, generalised ideas about Travellers seen in the press and in political discourse are used by those opposing the development of new sites. This dissertation suggests that negative, stereotypical representations of Travellers promulgated by the media affect the provision of sites at a local level by increasing and legitimising residents’ resistance and encouraging councillors to oppose site development.\n\nThis thesis qualitatively explores how Irish national newspapers have portrayed Irish Traveller men over the past three and a half years, from January 2011 until June 2014. Using the Lexisnexis newspaper database, articles (n=105) were collected that explicitly referenced Irish Traveller men and subsequently thematically analysed. This thesis examines how Irish national newspapers largely fail to challenge, and instead proliferate the sensationalised stereotypes of Irish Traveller men of the ‘Big Fat Gypsy’ genre. Through scrutinising these stereotypes, this thesis contributes to the theorisation of Irish Traveller men, with the ultimate intention of deconstructing monolithic stereotypes that have aided in a continual ideology of acceptable anti-Traveller sentiment that permeates contemporary Ireland. The thesis adopts an interpretative and inductive thematic analytical approach in analysing the research data and reveals that Irish newspaper representations of Traveller men are predominantly negative in focus. The negative representations are theorised into two meta-themes: Traveller men as caricatures of ‘otherness’ and Traveller men as individualised and deficient models of masculinity. The theme of dispelling myths surrounding Traveller men emerged as a counter discourse in the findings and is also discussed. Despite this positive affirmation of Traveller men, the overwhelmingly negative newspaper representations ultimately contribute towards continued social inequality. With the knowledge that the media is influential in shaping hegemonic public consensus (Devereux 2014), this thesis scrutinises the role of Irish national newspapers in proliferating this inequality. Through their predominantly negative portrayals of Irish Traveller men as caricatures of ‘otherness’ and as individualised deficient models of masculinity, national newspapers legitimitise State and public discriminatory (in)action, and perpetuate exclusion rather than alleviating it.\n\nA report by the Traveller Movement undertaken on behalf of the National Inclusion Health Board (a UK Government health agency responsible for guidance on working with 'at risk' groups). A literature review and qualitative study of the living conditions of UK Gypsies and Travellers living in different 'types' of site exploring self-reported health conditions, living environment and impact on physical and mental health and wellbeing of residence at different locations. Rates of anxiety and depression were most associated with insecure accommodation whilst many forms of 'tolerated' or public authority owned sites were found to be in very poor condition including poor air quality, pollution, busy traffic and vermin infestations. The majority of Romani Gypsies and Irish Travellers interviewed lived within a 15 mile radius of where they were born yet despite this they reported being frequently regarded as 'incomers' who should not live in a locality and in the majority of cases reported experiences of racism and social exclusion. Residence on a self-owned private site was associated with best health outcomes although tensions with neighbours over obtaining 'planning permission' were often a source of stress."
