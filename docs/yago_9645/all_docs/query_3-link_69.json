Four murders in one week and now solid lead is a piss poor show I know, but that new computer system's a load of old wank, with all due respect. For every piece of crap we type in we get a load more bollocks back.\n\nChief Inspector Roper:\n\nThat's not what I wanted to talk about Pete. I've had a worrying call from Joe, the photographer. Something about you touching the dead bodies...\n\nDetective Neilson:\n\nYes Sir, it's just something I have to do.\n\nChief Inspector Roper:\n\nOkay. Any particular reason?\n\nDetective Neilson:\n\nTo make sure they really are dead.\n\nChief Inspector Roper:\n\nHow long's this been going on Pete?\n\nDetective Neilson:\n\nAbout seven years. Ever since the girl, Abigail Watson.\n\nChief Inspector Roper:\n\nAbigail Watson... wasn't she one of Kemper's?\n\nDetective Neilson:\n\nHis fourth victim. She was only ten years old. That bastard raped and abused her repeatedly for two days.\n\nChief Inspector Roper:\n\nI remember Pete, you were the first to find her.\n\nDetective Neilson:\n\nHe'd broken her pelvic bone with his fist. Severe trauma lead to a state of advanced catalepsy, her body functions shut down. No sign of life.\n\nChief Inspector Roper:\n\nI know what happened. It was all a terrible mistake.\n\nDetective Neilson:\n\nI was with her for longest. If I'd touched her I would've known. She woke up in a fridge.\n\nChief Inspector Roper:\n\nYes but, I mean no one..."
