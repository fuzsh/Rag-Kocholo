        "text": "The film is known as ‘Siamese Cop’\n\nSouthsea Cinema Screenings: Wednesday 11th January 7pm\n\nDuration: 75min\n\nDirector: Paul Morris\n\nWriters: Alex Chandon, Paul Morris\n\nDirector and the film crew will be at Southsea Cinema for Q&A\n\nWhat’s it all about then?\n\nSet in the fictitious town of Vaya Con Dios, this off-the-wall\n\ncomedy follows the journey of conjoined twins Dan and Jack Pinto as they join\n\nthe town’s police force run by the (very) corrupt Captain Bartel. We soon\n\nrealize that it’s a case of ‘good cop bad cop’ as Jack gets involved with shady\n\ndrug dealers while Dan attempts to clean up the town – single handed. Their\n\nshared world hits the buffers as brotherly love is called into question when\n\nDan falls in love with the beautiful Rosa, waitress at the local restaurant.\n\nAnd… hold on, no spoilers on our watch…\n\nThe film, shot beautifully by Shaun O’Dell, is packed with vibrant\n\ncolours and dark film noir corners. The cops are played by first-timers Jason\n\nand Matthew Buckham, identical brothers who can surely empathise with the main\n\ncharacters – and that femme fatale is played by stunning Portuguese actress\n\nCatarina Furtado in her first feature film role. The wonderful original\n\nsoundtrack comes courtesy of Irish band Tabularasa (think Curtis Mayfield).\n\nIt is jam-packed with pungent one-liners, such as…\n\nINT. NIGHT. THE COCKEREL RESTAURANT\n\nRosa: “Are you looking down my cleavage?”\n\nJack: “No way, I’m scared of heights…”\n\nAnd sight gags – director Morris was inspired by Buster Keaton,\n\namong others.\n\nINT. DAY. HONEYCOMB CORRIDOR (FORMERLY BEDLAM HOSPITAL)\n\nVaya Con Dios’ finest are on patrol.\n\nDan to Jack: “Race you!”\n\nThe film was produced by experienced producers David Barron\n\n(Cinderella, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle and Harry Potter and the Deathly\n\nHallows) and Mark Westaway (Secrets and Lies, Nude Descending, An Organization\n\nof Dreams), aided and abetted by co-producers Paul Morris and Nico Rilla.\n\nThe crew was composed of fresh young film fanatics, many of them\n\ntaking a step up in the movie-making ladder, supported by more experienced\n\nartisans, such as award-winning stuntman/stunt coordinator Simon Crane (Bond\n\nfilms, Indiana Jones, Batman, Superman…), Shaun O’Dell (Aliens, The Phantom of\n\nthe Opera, Brotherhood of the Wolf) Ivan Sharrock, sound engineer, Academy\n\nAward winner for Best Sound, The Last Emperor, (other films Cloud Atlas, The\n\nRiver Wild, Gangs of New York)."
