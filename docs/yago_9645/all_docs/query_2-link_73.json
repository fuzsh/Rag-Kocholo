Over the years it quickly developed an infamous reputation as one of the weirdest, open minded, most diverse music festivals in existence. Merging subcultures who traditionally would never mingle has been a main focus of the event, bringing new light on dark corners of obscure music and art. Our goal is to spread diverse alternative music from all corners of the earth. We support International Experimental Music, Noise, Grind, Breakcore, Chiptune, Rap, Alternative, Avant-Garde, Psychedelic, Punk, Hardcore, freedom of speech, expression, individuality, human rights, animal rights, recycling, and the recognition and preservation of indigenous people & culture. If you aren't with us you are against us! Now the festival is combined with the 10 year anniversary of the label Placenta Recordings, who has been responsible for the fest's creation and continuation through a long, hard road and overcoming ridiculous odds adapting to a music industry who is against everything we believe in. We are now a massive family and unstoppable collective dedicated to extreme experimental sounds and visuals over 500 deep. Come celebrate with us! A true exploration of the psyche, with a barrage of the senses approach to life, love, sound, community, and visualizations…\" - Jay Watson\n\n\"Mental Spaghetti Fest brings the weird and the unusual to the forefront. What usually takes place in a basement or a garage has been transported into a popular venue.

You must wash the canals of your spaghetti-like brain matter in preperation for Dental Work's mechanical pigeon dildo seance. High pressure delayed Ouija board manipulations merged with lo-fi , ritualistic AM radio telepathy, unhealthy turntable modification and an array of urethra knives conveniently located within the anal salsa of humanity.\"\n\n- Jay Watson, Anxious Tadpole (Dec 01, 2010)\n\n\"Dental Work is an avant-garde sound & performance art manipulation project by Jay Watson, based out of Traverse City, MI with roots in Detroit, Chicago, Denver, and Oakland, CA. The music is a rare blend of musique concrete, extreme psychedelia, anxiety, experimental, harsh noise, tape manipulations, glitch, grindcore, turntable-ism, sound collage, found sounds, avant-garde, and outsider trash art. The instruments used in making these digital anxiety outlets over the years have consisted of knives, hatchets, bones, AM radios, fruit (Buddha’s Paw), hacksaws, fans, chop sticks, webbed cardboard, a box of cereal, a Ouija board, a pair of little girls shoes, contact mics, laptops, delay pedals, turntables, music editing programs, Super Nintendo, bass guitars, LSD, broken VHS tapes, and even members of the audience. Dental Work has 3 U.S. tours under his belt, and has performed with over 200 of today’s cutting edge musicians, and continues to perform regularly. Dental Work currently has over 80 albums released worldwide, on a variety of labels from multiple obscure countries, and the number continues to grow!\"\n\n-Statement found on various Dental Work web pages!\n\n“Jay Watson's sado-masochistic delivery of maximum discomfort and anxiety, intertwined with spiritual de-pantsing, rigorous mental questioning, forbidden pre-teen fascinations , ebony pornography obsessions, authentic mexican restaurant addictions, duct tape/broken vhs tape mutilation, frantic blow-up doll destruction, unneccesary panic, heart attack speed turntable thrust, rusty knife weilding eccentric masturbation, LSD laced childhood flashbacks, supernatural OUIJA freakouts, Shamanistic Ketamine Blackouts, Bukkake Ritualistic Ceremonies, OG owl shift hustlin', chopped & screwed grindcore, cross-dressing nomadic pee-pee noise, prostitute pop poop and more! Are you confused yet?”The instruments used in making these digital anxiety outlets over the years have consisted of knives, hatchets, bones, AM radios, fruit (Buddha’s Paw), hacksaws, fans, chop sticks, webbed cardboard, a box of cereal, a Ouija board, a pair of little girls shoes, contact mics, laptops, delay pedals, turntables, music editing programs, Super Nintendo, bass guitars, L5D,, broken VHS tapes, and even members of the audience.

Put it in your headphones, turn it up, and contemplate your next visit to the tooth doctor.\"\n\n- Matt Ludwig, Airplay: WNUR 89.3 FM (Oct 15, 2010)\n\n“Jay Watson. One of the most motivated productive people I know. Come see what noise music is all about. With seriously near a hundred releases and splits Dental Work annihilates sound and devastates everything.”\n\n-Tooth_Eye - Chicago, IL May 2011\n\n\"I highly recommend Dental Work. His live sets tend to be the one of best and most fun mixes I've heard of noise, breakcore, and pop cutups - standing in good stead with acts like Lil' Mack, Solypsis and Princess Army Wedding Combat.\"\n\n- Chris Monica, Yatagarasu (Jan 13, 2011)\n\n\"Paint gets torn off walls, autoharps get broken, breakcore gets reinvented, a whip gets cracked and someone flies a plane into the room. The drone of Marlo Eggplant meets the noisy digital hardcore of Dental Work. One long piece in 5 movements.\"\n\n- Valerie Park, Ms Valerie Park Distro\n\n“Jay is a great guy, very friendly and easy to work with. He sent me some Placenta stuff, including DENTAL WORK who are excellent... and he got very interested in my band for whatever reason (I have no idea why people like the stuff I do), and he wanted to work with me for a while but I played hard-to-get, as I usually do with labels for a bit. Haha. But yeah, I decided to do a clearing-of-the-vaults album and throw together all these weird rarities from the past 5 years. He did a great job on putting that release together, and I think it's a good album for people just getting into Scissor Shock and also, strangely, since every song sounds SO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT, it also may be one of the weirdest albums ever made. It sounds like 20 different bands, really. Anyway... I plan on putting out the next full length through him if he wants me to. It's up to him.”\n\n-Adam Cooley (Scissor Shock) During a June 2010 interview with Indieville.com\n\n\"Blast hiss to throat hop oscillator of broken drilling turntable corn stalk ear sodomy from nomadic noiser and performance painter of all things strange and wrong, Dental Work. A fifty four minute cut up madness using all that are not an instrumentalist's dream. This guy is the triple six of the midwesterners. Not to be crossed. A must have for fans of Realicide, Sobotnik, and depression...\"\n\n-Ratskin Records - Oakland, CA (Press release for \"Rostov's Breakthrough...\")\n\n“Rostov's Breakthrough of a Multitextured Turbulent Forcefield is so fucking good!!! Best work yet! AND Best samples ever!!!”\n\n-Endometrium Cuntplow - Los Angeles, CA\n\n“As is the case with his previous efforts, Watson's first half is a chaotic whirlwind of gritty beats, abstract samples, and experimental textures. Reading over his gargantuan list of instruments (which include everything from a Super NES to a switchblade, as well as piles of music-related electronics), it becomes obvious that sometimes he tries to pack too many things into too few tracks. Still, his wild, improvised freak-outs make for a titillating experience in avant-garde hometaper sound - something akin to the kid-in-a-playroom possibilities seen in early cassette releases. “\n\n-Matt Shimmer (Indieville.com) (partial review of the Dental Work/EYES - Split CD)\n\n“Limited to 100 copies and in swell CDR format, this brief split disc pits breakcore wizard Mochipet (né David Wang) against the DIY noise-techno outlet Dental Work (né Jay Watson). Mochipet, whose resume includes an album on Tigerbeat6 sublabel Violent Turd, is the more polished of the two. His \"Barack Obama\" - a breakbeat pummelling of classical Chinese music - is done to perfection, neatly carving up a pretty instrumental melody. Meanwhile, his \"Hilary Clinton\" is more abstract, while \"John McCain\" rocks like a Republican. On the other end of things, Dental Work comes from a more lo-fi angle, and his tracks are a bit less mathematical in complexity - and considerably weirder. His second track (I can't make out the title) merges weird electronic drone with spastic beats to create an altogether bizarre three minutes, while quaint \"Fuck John McCain\" is the sound of a Nintendo game being gutted and draped over the walls of an 8-bit slaughterhouse. Mochipet's more traditional breakcore might be the main draw here, but Dental Work's weird sonic experiments are worth a look in their own right.”\n\nMatt Shimmer (Indieville.com) (full review of Mochipet & Dental Work - Split)\n\n“Dental Work's Jay Watson is the man behind extreme CDR label Placenta Recordings, a very interesting lo-fi imprint that has amassed a hefty discography since its inception in 2006. Frequent collaborators with Dutch net-label Dadaist Audio, Placenta and Dental Work are based out of the small town of Beulah, Michigan (pop. 363) - a humble location for such a bizarre act. Feline AIDS Epidemic is a strange and noisy experience, melding drilling electronic rhythms, dissonant digital noise, and assorted samples into a brief but powerful adventure. The whole thing has a gritty, recycled texture to it, although as might be discerned from the crude crayon drawings on the cover, it is often quite light-hearted. Especially enjoyable is \"Video Kitten,\" a collaboration with 8-Bit Jellyfish that sounds something like life inside a malfunctioning pinball machine. Also noteworthy are vaguely schmaltzy \"Reconstructive Surgery\" and high-throttle fragment \"Onyx.\" Of course the CDR isn't uniformly great, but diehard experimental noise and sound collage fans should find this disc whimsically delicious.”\n\n-Matt Shimmer (Indieville.com) (full review of “Feline AIDS Epidemic” 3” CD-R)\n\n“Got CDrs yesterday - looking really good and thanks for sending that many!! “\n\n-Srdjan Eftimovski (Nundata) (Belgrade, Serbia)\n\n\"I still admire how you do cassette tapes. I remember on a segment of \"Brave New Waves\" on Radio 1 way back, they had the guy that had the last minidisc only label.... I still have a cassette in my other ride so I cant wait to hear what you've been up to Jay.\"\n\n-Rob Messerschmidt - Detroit, MI 2012\n\n“The sound of “Dental Work” reminds me of every aspect of the term. The pre-appointment anxiety, the muffled high of the laughing gas, the precision injection of chemicals and their face numbing narcotic effect, the endless drilling of bone fragment, the ripping reality of extraction, flowing blood, weightless delirium, the post-surgical re-assembly stitching, the endless painful recovery.”\n\n-Jay Watson (during 2011 interview with UK based label: Final Trauma Recordings)\n\n“Dental Work. My fellow tooth oriented Noiser. Glitched out sample core monster noise ba-ba-bangin' and grindin' its way into your ear buds and into your cerebral cortex vortex. electricity and all that jazz. Ch3ck!”\n\n-Magicore Records\n\n“That is noise. There is no harmonic relationship between any of the sounds...Not to say it's good or bad...just a lot of noise. Not really my thing...but hey, if kids will put it through their speakers and it pisses their parents off...then you might be onto something here.”\n\n-Gerald Jennex, US Marine, Traverse City, MI\n\n“Mr. Jay Watson, purveyor of the mighty Placenta Recordings, drops another AWESOME psychedelic noise bomb on our collective dome piece under his \"i will eat you\" alias Dental Work. A definite must listen for your hallowed parties this eve! ch3k 1t!”\n\n- Christopher Will - Chicago, IL\n\n\"Hey there, i got your pack today with the dotabata splits! Thanx for the extras!\"\n\n- Ben Agromosh - Gorgonized Dorks - California, USA\n\n“The latest efforts of Iamdeadsmiles58, Dental Work, and Tooth_Eye. A smash of grind vocals, breakcore aesthetics, and noise leanings make up this split. Dental Work starts it off with a 6 minute voyage through rough noise psychedelia and the break beat ghosts of the dubstep \"movement\". Iamdeadsmiles58 comes through as if he fed Casiotone for the Painfully Alone to a pregnant Anal Cunt and the miscarried result was transformed into audio waves. Tooth_eye lends amen break beat madness to the final track.”\n\n- Tooth_Eye - Chicago, IL\n\n“Received my package today, thank you so much man. Going to listen to the stuff later, I've never gotten so much free stuff before, haha thanks a lot!”\n\n- Andrew Lipscomb (Fan Of The Month - Decibel Magazine)\n\n“I received you package, thank you quite a lot, a nice cover art!”\n\n- Mama Baer & Kommissar Hjuler - Germany\n\n“YO !!!! pack arrived to Puebla safely ! , thanks very much - gracias PLACENTA RECORDINGS. Peace vato”\n\nMario Quiroga - Vulgar Disease - Mexico\n\n“Hashish and Raw Meat is an album that was recorded across the United States. It contains to live sets and two tracks are collaborations. This album is a fantastic example of Jay Watson's Dental Work project. Dental Work is a mash of harsh noise, turn tableism, glitch, breakcore, and anything else that happens to emerge from the unique psyche that is Jay Watson. You dig through the waves of harsh noise wall to find dirt covered gems, samples of 80s soul and rock n roll, hip hop that just won't stop and horses that go clip clop clip clop. Ive had the honor to play with Dental Work many times now, every appearance, every audience is not dissapointed.”\n\n-MAGICORE Blog - Chicago, IL\n\nPlacenta Recordings is DECIBEL MAGAZINE #85‘s “Label Of The Month Part 2:” “AHHHHHHHHHH! Hey, it wouldn’t be a noise column without a shout out to a tiny prolific label big on fucked-up porn collage cover art and harsh headfucking lunacy, right? Right. That’s where Placenta Recordings comes in and mainman Jay Watson’s Dental Work project, and the four zillion releases and splits that he has vomited out in a few short years. This is for the ugly people. You know who you are. Perhaps start with the live Boron Nuzzle/Dental Work/Cock E.S.P. CD. That oughta hit the grimy spot. The list of collaborators on Jay’s label is a who’s-who of what the fuck, and decidedly not safe for work. You might even forget to GO to work after you listen to some of this shit. You’ve been warned. If you send THIS dude money, he’ll probably include you on a new release. He’s up for anything. Recommended for cheap thrill seekers covered in homemade tattoos who wear their sisters used tampons for earrings.”\n\n- Scott Seward (Decibel Magazine #85)\n\n“Thanks to Jay and Placenta for doing this and helping get some of this old bullshit back out into circulation. And thanks to everyone else who has joined me on this ride.”\n\n- Mike Duncan (Black Mayonnaise)\n\n“A compilation of pieces recorded by Black Mayonnaise in the period 1991-2008. Started out inspired by Godflesh, Carcass, Butthole Surfers - not really bands that ever inspired me, although not bad either. There is also an interest in extreme music, noise, rituals etc. Each of the track gets a write up on the insert which is always nice to read. That's about it, really. The voice is heavily distorted, slowed down, rhythm machines run amok and/or heavily and there are some heavily distorted guitars. Dark doom metal perhaps? Its not really the cup of tea I like, I must admit. Its great to create music, but there is not always a necessity to release it. (FdW)”\n\n-Vital Weekly #807 review of “BLACK MAYONNAISE - WHEN YOU GET CAUGHT BETWEEN THE MOON AND BOSTON HARBOR (CDR by Placenta Recordings)\n\n“Dental Workkkkk!!

Biological family is amazing as well, but Placenta truly understands. We all want love and friendship; for ourselves and everyone else. That's the beauty of it, and that spans beyond music and art. That spans into the very roots of humanity. Placenta love is the strongest love, because the whole placenta family loves so strongly. As it grows bigger, our collective pool of love grows as well.
