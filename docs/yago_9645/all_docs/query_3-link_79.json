        "text": "“Bohemian Rhapsody” is unarguably Queen’s magnum opus. The rock opera is impossibly unique and impeccably performed. Because of that, you’d be hard pressed to find a song in the band’s catalog that compares. However, according to guitarist Brian May, there is one. Find out which guitar solo May thought rivaled “Bohemian Rhapsody,” below.\n\n[RELATED: Queen’s Brian May in Tears as He Shares Touching Tribute to Aerosmith After Band Retirement Announcement]\n\nThe Guitar Solo Brian May Thought Rivaled “Bohemian Rhapsody”\n\nShe keeps her Moët et Chandon\n\nIn her pretty cabinet\n\n“Let them eat cake, ” she says\n\nJust like Marie Antoinette\n\nA built-in remedy\n\nFor Khrushchev and Kennedy\n\nAt anytime an invitation\n\nYou can’t decline\n\nLike “Bohemian Rhapsody,” “Killer Queen” is a staple in Queen’s catalog. The playful song about an expectation defying woman helped to give Queen their big break.\n\n“It’s about a high class call girl,” Freddie Mercury once said of this song. “I’m trying to say that classy people can be whores as well. That’s what the song is about, though I’d prefer people to put their interpretation upon it – to read into it what they like.”\n\n[RELATED: The Legendary Guitarist That Almost Made Queen’s Brian May Want to “Give Up” Playing]\n\nWhile the lyrics and melody are certainly inviting, May put a focus on the guitar solo in this song. He once called it “a favourite of mine.” One of the reasons May has an affinity for this track is because of how complex his playing is.\n\nTo avoid complications\n\nShe never kept the same address\n\nIn conversation\n\nShe spoke just like a baroness\n\nMet a man from China\n\nWent down to Geisha Minah\n\nThen again incidentally\n\nIf you’re that way inclined\n\n“That was always in my head,” he continued. “It was something a bit more complex, an adventure in putting guitar harmonies into the solo…It was quite a step into the unknown, that solo, and it has a melody that I put in there which doesn’t appear anywhere else in the song, so in a sense they’re quite comparable, that and ‘Bohemian Rhapsody.’”\n\nIt’s high praise to compare any song to “Bohemian Rhapsody.” Though May’s compliments of “Killer Queen” aren’t overly gushing, that comparison says volumes.\n\nRevisit the Queen hit, below.\n\nShe’s a Killer Queen\n\nGunpowder, gelatine\n\nDynamite with a laser beam\n\nGuaranteed to blow your mind\n\nAnytime\n\nRecommended at the price\n\nInsatiable an appetite\n\nWanna try?\n\nCredit: Photo by Ilpo Musto/Shutterstock"
