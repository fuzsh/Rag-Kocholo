        "text": "Chainsaw Scumfuck (1988)\n\n*** (out of 4)\n\nIf you're expecting some sort of high art film then it's best that you don't even consider watching this short film from Alex Chandon. A brief history will help you with this film. It was made during a time that the BBFC was pretty much trying to put a ban on gore and horror movies so the director, obviously a fan of the genre, decided to give a very big middle finger to the censors. The story here is quite simple as a couple friends are sitting around when a maniac breaks in and begins slaughtering them.\n\nThis amateur film isn't going to win any Oscars but it's fun for what it is. The low-budget is rather obvious and it adds to the film's charm. It certainly works when you know the history behind it and you can't help but cheer on the rather obvious special effects that were just designed to show gore and upset certain \"normal\" people who felt they were better than the horror genre. At just 7 minutes it's certainly worth watching."
