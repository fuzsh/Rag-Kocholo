        "text": "This War Studies Advanced Program is shaped by the publication of two important new books—one examining Clausewitz’s interaction with some of the dominant philosophical developments of his time; the other examining (for the first time) his intellectual interactions with his wife and with the intellectual and social environment of his life. It also takes advantage of the publication of a new work wrestling with the ethical framework of war, dominated hitherto by Walzer, into a more rigorous and philosophically grounded structure. The common theme of these works, and of Clausewitz himself, is the attempt to determine the best philosophical approach to understanding war—an activity that inevitably also shapes the meaning of the concept of understanding war itself.\n\nThe result of this study should be twofold: first, it will help us comprehend why Clausewitz’s work is so powerful and seemingly eternal in its utility, as well as how best to engage with it; second, it will further our own efforts to understand war, examine what we mean by “understand war”, and give us a solid intellectual and theoretical framework for engaging in that task in a time of great confusion and apparent transformation, once again, in the nature of war itself.\n\nThe course will not follow a fixed agenda—it cannot, given the enormous intellectual complexities involved in understanding the difficult theories of Kant and Hegel, the effects of the intertwined personal and intellectual lives of Carl and Marie, and the evolution of On War itself, as well as the interactions of Kant, Hegel, and Clausewitz with the ethics of war. We will generally focus on Cormier and Dubik during the first weekend and on Bellinger during the second, but the discussion will range freely over both.\n\nWar Studies Advanced Programs are open only to alumni of the basic War Studies course. These sessions are offered in the winter and summer, and focus either on a national security challenge or on a historical conflict. Learn more about the War Studies Program."
