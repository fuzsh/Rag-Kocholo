        "text": "I have the utmost respect and awe for astronauts who ride a ball of flame into space. Our nation was landing a man on the moon when I was seven, and every kid was mesmerized when looking skyward at night. Arizona Senator Mark Kelly is a national hero for being a part of NASA and my first choice this year for the Democratic vice-presidential nomination. But I can honestly say each of the top contenders for the party nomination found favor with me, some more than others, but all are credible, intelligent people grounded in government service. Last but not least, each of them is also grounded in decency. We have never had to place basic goodness on the must-have list of characteristics when choosing our national candidates, but since 2016 this has been a requirement.\n\nWhen it comes to being the every-man type of politician none of the contenders up for consideration by Kalama Harris for the vice-presidency could top Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. While he has often been mentioned over the years as the best example of how to govern effectively and pass needed legislation to move a state forward, he was not seen at the start of the vetting process for the nomination as the finalist. He is nice, cordial, humble, and respectful of others, and seemed more suited to talking with constituents at a state fair than sitting at the State of the Union address. But I am genuinely thrilled, as are Democrats nationwide, to have him on the national ticket this fall. Harris made it official Tuesday morning that Walz was the choice to serve alongside her in the White House.\n\nSome national pundits have said a more balanced Democratic ticket might have been even stronger had the selection been moderate Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro or Senator Kelly. But what constitutes moderate or liberal in America is hard to define when the alternative is the absolute rabid conservative politics of the current Republican Party. The moderate policies of Bill Clinton and Albert Gore would be called outright socialism by the GOP base today. Meanwhile, Walz and a strong majority in our nation know that funding school lunches for all children and not debasing gay students in classrooms is not being liberal, it is called being humane. And that is where Tim Walz resides. It is that connection with common sense values that our nation must embrace.\n\nWhat I greatly admire about Walz is that he was a social studies teacher and his wife, Gwen, also taught in public, alternative, and migrant schools, as well as prison. Teachers who instill the love of learning are part of a noble undertaking. But that work also speaks well of character. We know that in Minnesota there is a deep well of people with admirable character, some of whom have found themselves on the national stage. Hubert Humphrey, Walter Mondale, and Tim Walz share what frequently gets labeled ‘Midwestern nice’. It was always refreshing to see the likes of Gerald Ford from Michigan and Paul Simon from Illinois shine at their best when contrasted at times with harsh, brash, and brazen pols. Our nation yearns for the smile and grace from Walz. It will feel good and extra comforting given the political opposition facing the voters.\n\nThe Minnesota governor has the conversational ability to talk in a way that makes it tone-easy for the voters to receive the message that needs to be imparted. Communication is such a crucial part of politics and the nation is so very tired of the continual bombast and 24/7 harping about the most absurd and delusional aspects of Donald Trump’s warped personality. Walz can tell the simple truths with clarity.\n\n“Who’s asking for this crazy stuff? Who’s asking to raise the price of insulin? Who’s asking to get rid of birth control? … Who’s sitting in a bar in Racine, Wisconsin, saying, ‘You know what we really need? We need to ban “Animal Farm.”’ Nobody is!” Walz told MSNBC last month, later adding: “Yes, they’re weird. They prove that every day. It’s an observation”.\n\nWalz comes with a strong dose of humility that is based on his DNA and from Minnesota’s historical roots where he worked and raised a family.\n\nOne of my personal political heroes, (and not due to his name) was the little-known mayor of Minneapolis who made it very clear in 1948 that civil rights mattered, even if it roiled the waters at the Democratic Convention. Hubert Humphrey simply did what was right when he took the convention stage and spoke candidly to the delegates.\n\n“My friends, to those who say that we are rushing this issue of civil rights, I say to them we are 172 years late. To those who say that this civil rights program is an infringement on states’ rights, I say this: The time has arrived in America for the Democratic Party to get out of the shadow of states’ rights and to walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights.”\n\nSome called him out-of-bounds at the time. History calls it leadership.\n\nAnother soft-spoken but effective Democratic leader was Walter Mondale. During his years as Minnesota Attorney General, the case Gideon v. Wainwright was at the forefront at the U.S. Supreme Court. The case revolved around the right of defendants in state courts to have a lawyer. We take it for granted now, but it was not always so. Conservatives denounced the idea and organized a friend of the court brief from several state attorneys general. Mondale had another view and organized a countering friend of the court brief from many more state attorneys general, arguing that defendants must be allowed a lawyer. The arc of history bent with the efforts of Mondale and other Americans like him.\n\nI am supremely proud of the Harris-Walz ticket that will crisscross our nation and speak about the issues and ways to address them as Americans. I strongly suspect that the energy and enthusiasm that has greeted Harris at rallies and scored with donors and volunteers in the past 16 days will only increase with the placement of Walz on the ticket."
