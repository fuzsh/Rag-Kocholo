        "text": "Lisa Tavares on Harriet Tubman\n\n\"The woman who most inspires me is Harriet Tubman, a conductor on the Underground Railroad who overcame unimaginable challenges in escaping slavery to become the liberator of hundreds of others. Tubman believed strongly in the equality of all people, Black or white, male or female, and was an early supporter of the women’s suffrage movement. Her extraordinary story of courage and perseverance reminds me daily that no challenge is too great.\"\n\nJustin Pierce on Frederick Douglass\n\n\"Frederick Douglass’ remarkable life journey, ranging from his escape from slavery to his rise as a prominent abolitionist, social reformer, author, orator, and statesman, is a constant inspiration. In addition to his incisive and prodigious writings, he became the most photographed American in the 19th century, cleverly using his own image to dispel racist caricatures and narratives. At this pivotal moment in American history, his pursuit of equality and commitment to dialogue and forging alliances across all divides still serves as a shining example of how real progress may be achieved.\"\n\nThomasina Poirot on Frederick Douglass\n\nFrederick Douglass's wisdom continues to inspire me. He once said, \"If there is no struggle, there is no progress.\" This country has faced many recent obstacles in its fight for racial equality, but I find solace in Douglass's belief that our continued struggles represent progress toward peace and justice.\n\nTanya Upthegrove-Coleman on Mary Church Terrell\n\n\"Mary Church Terrell, an educator and social justice warrior, was influential in helping Black and white women 'throw off the yoke of oppression' in America. Terrell’s commitment to eradicating racial and gender oppressive legislation in an era when women were deemed to be irrelevant inspires me to lead with power, educate with empathy and embrace my strength as an African American woman.\"\n\nBruce Sidell on Jackie Robinson\n\n\"As a child, much of my early learning came through sports, particularly baseball. The courage, commitment, and quiet perseverance Jackie Robinson exhibited in breaking baseball’s color barrier were attributes I quickly admired in him and have come to admire in others. As an aspiring athlete, I was captivated by his excellence and sheer talent (he was a four-letter athlete at UCLA), and still find it rewarding to see Jackie’s retired number displayed in every major league stadium.\"\n\nStacie Tobin on Katie Ledecky\n\n“As a swimmer and a Marylander, I’m particularly inspired by Katie Ledecky, who, as a 15-year-old, stunned the swimming world by winning the 800-meter freestyle in the 2012 Olympics by more than four seconds. Since then, Katie has gone on to be the most successful female swimmer of all time, not because she has the perfect swimmer’s body — she doesn’t — but because she is a ruthless goal-setter for her own personal improvement, and ferociously devotes herself to achieving those goals.”\n\nBob Waldman on Sara Safari\n\n\"I recently had the privilege of hearing Sara Safari’s harrowing account of climbing Mt. Everest when an earthquake hit. Sara, who grew up in Iran and had no experience in mountain climbing, decided to climb some of the world’s highest mountains, both to challenge her own self-imposed limitations and to raise attention and funds to support at-risk girls in Nepal. This marginalized community had been subject to forced early marriage and human trafficking. Sara’s amazing efforts to use mountain climbing as a means to help those most in need are truly inspirational.\"\n\nAndrew Hales on Kathrine Switzer\n\n\"In her memoir, Marathon Woman, Kathrine Switzer shares her story of becoming the first woman to run the Boston Marathon at a time when it was considered unthinkable that a woman could complete the race. Her philosophy was simple. \"Hot damn,\" she thought, \"I have a coach, a training partner, a plan, and a goal: the biggest race in the world—Boston.\" She was ready—the race officials, not so much. I’ve never personally qualified to run Boston, but her amazing story inspires me to keep trying.\n\nSanjay Shew on Manny Pacquiao\n\n\"One of the greatest boxers of our time has retired, but he is still fighting outside the ring for the poorer class in his country. Emmanuel \"Manny\" D. Pacquiao’s unbelievable achievements in life and his persistence in seeking higher office for a just cause encourage me to stay focused and persevere. His example teaches us that, with hard work, nothing is impossible. As he puts it, \"Life is meant to be a challenge, because challenges are what make you grow.\"\"\n\nMelissa Meyer on Serena Williams\n\n“When she wasn’t dominating the tennis court or inspiring countless female athletes and athletes of color, Serena Williams used her platform to highlight awareness and drive help for children and families around the world who are in greatest need. Through her foundation, she created the Yetunde Price Resource Center, which offers trauma-healing programs and space dedicated to nurturing community resiliency.”\n\nHa Kung Wong on George Takei\n\n“Since childhood, I have been inspired by George Takei, who, having survived the internment camps in the United States during World War II, became one of the first Asian Americans to land a serious role on TV. His portrayal of the character Lieutenant Sulu resulted in fame that he uses to advocate tirelessly for immigrant rights, LGBTQ+ rights, and AAPI rights and representation. I will never forget meeting him as a kid at a Star Trek convention, where I dressed up as him in a contest. When I told him I had changed my rank to Admiral Sulu and was now in charge of Starfleet, he immediately announced I had won and has been one of my favorite people ever since!”\n\nEmilio Cividanes on Raúl Juliá\n\nI have long admired the fearless and versatile actor Raúl Juliá. In addition to excelling at his craft, Juliá was also a cultural icon. He was one of the first Hispanics to which a new generation of American filmgoers was exposed, and a frequent collaborator with independent filmmakers, raising the profile of Puerto Rican cinema. Through his humanitarian efforts to promote social justice and racial harmony, Juliá also served as a reminder that every one of us is a member of a much larger community.\n\nAlexandra Megaris on Lucille Ball\n\nAs a kid, I Love Lucy was my favorite TV show, but I had no idea at the time that its star, Lucille Ball, was such a trailblazer. Hollywood has never been kind to female leads, especially in the 1940s and 50s. But, defying stereotypes, Ms. Ball rejected damsel-in-distress typecasting and reached the pinnacle of her profession—comedy—before going on to become the first woman to run a major film studio. Lucille Ball had guts and was hilarious. What a combo.\n\nAyelén R. Rodriguez on Lin-Manuel Miranda\n\nI continue to admire playwright, producer, actor, and songwriter Lin-Manuel Miranda. As both an activist and a trailblazer in the theater world, he never fails to honor his Puerto Rican roots and to promote equal representation as he climbs the ladder of success. No matter what challenge arises, he inspires me to never forget where I come from and to always support the Latinx community.\n\nManny Caixeiro on José Andrés\n\nJosé Andrés is one of the most brilliant chefs in the world, but the true measure of this man is his humanitarian work with World Central Kitchen. He brings food to the needy where and when their need is most dire.\n\nStephanie Loughlin on her Grandmother\n\n\"My grandmother, Anna, has inspired me throughout my life by her perseverance and integrity. She did whatever was required for her family, including leaving school after 8th grade to work as a maid to help support her six younger siblings. Despite the external constraints on her life, she maintained an open heart and an open mind.\"\n\nMitch Evall on his Grandmother\n\n\"My maternal grandmother was a great inspiration to me. She was one of five sisters who fled Poland at a young age and, ahead of her time, was a deep believer in gender equality, workplace rights, and other issues of social justice. She insisted that her granddaughters AND grandsons know how to cook. (And she made the world’s best brisket.)\"\n\nSarah Brooks on her Grandmother\n\n\"My grandmother, Ilia, was an inspiring woman and the person I most wanted to emulate growing up. As a seamstress raising three children, she had an incredible work ethic, eventually opening her own sewing shop. She also had a lot of courage — she married a British soldier and moved from Italy to England after World War II, without knowing a word of English.\"\n\nTraci Mundy Jenkins on her Mother\n\n“I am inspired by my mother, Dr. Sylvia P. Mundy. Not only was she the first female Popeyes franchisee, she was a true trailblazer in the areas of business, education, and government, despite the racial and gender inequalities she had to endure. I live by her guiding principles of resilience, professionalism, and being a crusader for customer service.“\n\nWilliam Briggs on Dr. Dorothy Height\n\n\"My great aunt, Dr. Dorothy Height, was one of the original women pioneers in the American civil rights movement and the president of the National Council of Negro Women for forty years, and she counseled U.S. presidents from FDR to Barack Obama on racial justice. Her wise words continue to inspire me:\n\n“If you want to change somebody’s mind about something, you must try to find out where he or she is coming from. What experience underlies this person’s words? What hurt or fear is gnawing at his or her heart? ... You need to know where you want to go, but if you don’t look both to the left and to the right as you proceed, you will miss things that might help you on your way.”\"\n\nClaude Bailey on Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\n\"Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. is the person who gives me the strength and inspiration to help create a better world. No one else in history has so eloquently articulated why this country has a moral obligation to live up to its professed ideal that all men and women are created equal. Through his words and actions, he changed the way Black people are treated. His work and that of so many unnamed others laid the foundation for the struggle for equality not just for Black people but also women, the LGBTQ community, and other oppressed groups. I always remember one of his lesser-known quotes: 'We may have all come on different ships, but we’re in the same boat now.'\"\n\nRoger Meertins on Rosa Parks\n\nRosa Parks is my source of inspiration, reminding me that small acts of courage against oppression can trigger significant change. In that pivotal moment when she chose not to give up her seat, her strength and resolve inspired a movement that changed the world.\n\nDom Conde on Eleanor Roosevelt\n\n\"Known as the 'First Lady of the World' for her human rights achievements, Eleanor Roosevelt was an inspirational figure throughout her life. From being the first presidential spouse to hold her own press conferences to becoming the first chair of the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women in the Kennedy administration, she was a tireless advocate for women and minorities.\"\n\nJennifer Bruton on Ruth Bader Ginsburg\n\n\"Ruth Bader Ginsburg is an inspiration to me because of her fight for gender rights. At a time when it seemed there was little hope for such rights, she was wise enough to carry on the battle in a methodical way, often using instances of discrimination against men to demonstrate her point.\"\n\nRon Jacobs on John Paul II\n\n\"St. John Paul II’s commitment to promoting religious freedom, bringing down the Iron Curtain, and protecting the most vulnerable inspires me to think about how to help others, to walk in others’ shoes, and to work to bring about justice in the world.\"\n\nBelinda Vega on Justice Sonia Sotomayor\n\n\"Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor inspires me every day to work hard and persevere. The daughter of Puerto Rican parents, she made history as the first Latinx justice, and she has also weighed in on a number of game-changing cases, such as Obergefell v. Hodges. In that historic decision, Justice Sotomayor, alongside Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Anthony Kennedy, Stephen Breyer, and Elena Kagan, voted to make same-sex marriage legal in all 50 states. She is a beacon of hope for me, because she shows that we still have warriors fighting for justice, equality, and love.\"\n\nJenn Reddien on Sylvia Mendez\n\n\"I have always admired Sylvia Mendez and her parents for their bravery and persistence in fighting for school desegregation. By working to remove some of the barriers that denied minorities equal access to education, they helped pave the way for the pivotal Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education.\"\n\nLisa Tavares on Dovey Johnson Roundtree\n\n\"I admire attorney and activist Dovey Johnson Roundtree, who championed civil rights for all Americans. Aside from having secured a law degree in the late 1940s at a time when few women, let alone Black women, had access to higher education, she managed to win a ground-breaking case involving segregated bus travel just five years into her practice. Later she became the first Black woman to be admitted to the all-white Women's Bar Association of Washington, DC. Her capacity to break barriers despite the limitations placed on her gender and race throughout her lifetime is an inspiration.\"\n\nGeoff Garinther on Thurgood Marshall\n\n\"I have huge admiration for Thurgood Marshall, who as the founder of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund in 1940 did so much to advance the cause of racial equality in the United States. Marshall is best known for being the first African American to sit on the Supreme Court, a huge achievement by any standards. But it is the tireless work he did as a young lawyer, fighting injustice in small and dusty courtrooms throughout the Deep South, that cemented his legacy as one of the leading legal architects of the civil rights movement.\"\n\nSavannah Parrish on Ruth Bader Ginsburg\n\n\"For me, Ruth Bader Ginsburg epitomizes the idea of fighting for what you believe in. She believed in the ideology of equality for all and fought hard for LGBTQIA+ rights. Her memory still echoes and inspires us all to this day.\"\n\nSarah Hoffman on Elouise Cobell\n\n\"Elouise Cobell, an activist and leader of the Blackfoot Nation, filed a class action lawsuit against the U.S. government for mismanaging Indian trust funds. Thirteen years of tenacious litigation resulted in a multi-billion-dollar settlement, which helped fund land consolidation and educational scholarships. Cobell was a true trailblazer.\"\n\nDana Holmstrand on Marsha P. Johnson\n\n“Marsha P. Johnson exemplifies the “joyful warrior.” A prominent figure in the LGBTQ+ rights movement of the 1960s, Marsha was known as much for her activism as for her megawatt smile. She serves as a reminder that both strength and softness are necessary in the fight for progress.”\n\nLeah Druckerman on Chase Strangio\n\n“Chase Strangio, ACLU Deputy Director for Transgender Justice: In the face of attempts to deny LGBTQ+ children and adults fundamental rights, access to life-saving healthcare, and safe participation in society, Chase Strangio is on the front lines with the ACLU, challenging anti-LGBTQ+ actions and policies through education, litigation, and advocacy. Despite this, he also somehow finds the time and energy to create spaces and events for queer and trans joy for himself and others.”\n\nColin Vandell on Judy Shepard\n\n\"Judy Shepard’s life is a testament to perseverance and grace in overcoming unimaginable tragedy and in fighting for a far more empathetic society. Her son Matthew was the victim of a hate crime that America still remembers more than 20 years later. For the benefit of the LGBTQ+ community, his memory has been preserved in large part by his mother, who has dedicated her life to the cause. Judy’s unwavering belief in kindness and the acceptance of others who are different has been absolutely essential in moving the United States forward in its treatment of a group that has historically been both ostracized and targeted with violence. She represents the very best of advocacy for human rights.\"\n\nAngel Garganta on Michael Adams\n\n\"My friend Michael Adams, who leads SAGE, our country’s leading organization working to support and improve the lives of LGBTQ elders, has inspired me for over 25 years. Michael has devoted his entire career to fighting for the rights of LGBTQ Americans, at the ACLU, Lambda Legal, and now at SAGE. He is an exemplary leader, a brilliant lawyer, and a great human being.\"\n\nMark Vecchio on Evan Wolfson\n\n\"Evan Wolfson was a tireless leader for marriage equality years before it developed broad-based support within the LGBTQ community. His was a long-term, 'against-all-odds' vision, which he pursued for decades with intelligence, patience, perseverance, fortitude, and tremendous personal commitment. His lone voice grew over time to become a chorus, culminating ultimately in the Supreme Court decision that changed the lives of so many.\"\n\nKed Whitmore on Madeleine Albright\n\n\"After the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, the United States faced an uncertain international order and a far more varied and nuanced set of global relationships. Madeleine Albright entered this unfamiliar environment and effectively advanced the international interests of the United States for nearly a decade as ambassador to the United Nations and Secretary of State. Her ability to not only face down the world’s toughest diplomatic challenges, but to do so with absolute composure and a touch of humor, provides a great example for all of us.\"\n\nTiffany Williams on Barack Obama\n\n\"The person who inspires me the most is Barack Obama. I was a college student during the 2008 presidential election, and I remember how President Obama’s election unlocked any reservations I had about my potential or goals, both personal and professional. I was, and continue to be, captivated by his presence, integrity, and humility, and I continue to strive to exude the same characteristics as I grow in my career.\"\n\nGeoff Garinther on Nancy Pelosi\n\n\"Nancy Pelosi, who, like Venable, grew up in Baltimore, maintains a grace under pressure — an ability to choose her words carefully, laser focused on what’s most important—that is the hallmark of every great trial lawyer, a standard our attorneys aspire to every day.\"\n\nBecca Chappell on Jacinda Ardern\n\n\"One of the youngest female world leaders, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is inspirational to me because she proves that strong and effective leadership can be rooted in empathy, compassion, and honesty. As an unwavering advocate for gender equality, Prime Minister Ardern shows us all, particularly women, that there are many different ways to be powerful.\"\n\nJennifer Bruton on Kamala Harris\n\n\"With this year marking the 100th anniversary of women finally securing the right to vote in the United States, Kamala Harris’s extraordinary achievement in becoming the first woman and first woman of color to win the vice presidency is particularly poignant. Whether running for attorney general, the Senate, and now the second-highest office in the nation, Vice President Harris has steadfastly refused to allow any external barriers get in the way of her personal goals—no matter how ambitious— and that should serve as an inspiration to all of us.\"\n\nWilliam Lawrence on Stacey Abrams\n\n\"In this time of intense political and social tumult in America, I admire Stacey Abrams' contribution to the ongoing, vital fight to end voter suppression. What she, and others inspired by her example and leadership, achieved in Georgia in the most recent elections was pivotal to redirecting this country's future toward a brighter horizon.\"\n\nAli Pillow on Barack Obama\n\n“Barack Obama's 2012 reelection was a cosmic reminder to be the change, and you will see the change that will ignite the future that we are all destined to be a part of.”\n\nWitt Chang on Norman Mineta\n\n\"The APIA community and the nation recently lost a public service legend. Though his family spent years in an internment camp, Secretary Mineta went on to serve as an Army intelligence officer, 20-year member of Congress, and eventually, the first Asian American Cabinet member as President Clinton's commerce secretary.\"\n\nMitch Evall on Unknown\n\n\"Years ago, I used to chair the annual “Olympics” Competition (complete with staggered-height podiums and bronze, silver, and gold medals) for the several hundred kids living at MacLaren Children’s Center, the LA County home for “abused, abandoned, and neglected” kids. One year, during the 1500-meter race, one of the competitors had a disability but participated anyway. As the frontrunners approached the finish line, the young black teenager who was in the lead threw his arms out and yelled “stop” to all the other runners, then pointed to their cabin-mate, who was struggling toward them, and said, “We wait for him and finish together.” And that’s what they did. When I commended him at the medal ceremony for his sportsmanship, he said to me, “I’m sure you have a ‘regular’ family. I don’t; this is my family. All I’m doing is watching out for my family, just like you would.” I have no idea what became of that young man, but as strange as it may sound, it feels appropriate that, all these years later, he is being written about in tribute. \"\n\nNikki Hasselbarth on her friends\n\n\"The women who inspire me most are those I speak to every day – my friends. Over the years we have formed a tribe of 11, including myself and my sister, from various backgrounds, though primarily Black women and women of color. We are lawyers, mothers, educators, and advocates for racial justice and financial equity. These women inspire me to be my fullest and truest self – to give generously and to love endlessly. Despite the personal difficulties they each may face in their daily lives, and without the glitz or glamour of any public recognition, these women show up for me and for each other with a strength and grace and intentionality that is unparalleled.\"\n\nEvelynn Bui on Pham Doan Trang\n\n“I am inspired by Pham Doan Trang, an internationally recognized Vietnamese journalist and human rights activist. She has written about the pursuit of religious freedom in Vietnam and called attention to environmental injustices. Although she continues to experience retaliation because of her advocacy for the protection of free speech, she perseveres. Her compassion, dedication, and steely strength are common characteristics of the Vietnamese women in my life, and I am inspired to do my part in stretching that horizon.”\n\nMoxi Upadhyaya on Katharine Graham\n\n\"I've always had a deep admiration for Katharine Graham, who, following her husband's sudden death and while raising four children on her own, had to take on the job of publishing a major newspaper. Although she had no experience in this male-dominated field, by simply putting 'one foot in front of the other,' she turned a major challenge into a phenomenal success. Moreover, she made history by standing up to presidential abuses of power in the midst of great pressure from all sides.\"\n\nMatt McLaughlin on Mary Oliver\n\n\"The great American poet Mary Oliver changed my worldview. She showed me the tender beauty found in our fragile life. Oliver's hungry eyes and august, vivid language teach us how to be 'married to amazement.' I would venture that few men or women have ever been as alive as she was. She inspires me to remember that 'I don't want to end up simply having visited this world.'\"\n\nClaudia Lewis on Ida B. Wells\n\nIda B. Wells' lifelong crusade against racism through her work as a journalist, an activist, and one of the founders of the NAACP continues to inspire me. Born into slavery and despite losing her parents at 16, she managed to rise above the formidable hardships of her early life to become a pioneer of racial justice. Her bravery was particularly evident in her relentless pursuit of reporting and exposing horrifying violence against the Black community, which she argued was used primarily as a weapon to deny Black economic progress.\n\nStephanie DeLong on Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\n\nThe Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's beautiful prose on topics involving cultural strife and struggles with racism and sexism encapsulate the importance of teaching our children about differences. Her bestseller, Dear Ijeawele, or, A Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions, has provided a road map for me on how to raise feminist children (boys and girls) and help them understand that while 'people walk different paths in the world ... they are valid paths that ... must be respect[ed].\n\nSheila Turybury on Maya Angelou\n\nI have always had huge admiration for the extraordinary poet, author, and activist Maya Angelou. Rather than allow an abusive childhood in the Deep South derail her, she turned the traumatic events of her life into dazzling autobiography. Alternately banned and revered, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings challenged anyone who read it to question their most basic perceptions about themselves and about society. Her words inspire me every day.\n\nDarrin Dyson on James Baldwin\n\nJames Baldwin, through his writing, but also through his articulate and passionate discourse, expressed the very contradiction that is the promise of this country and our actual, lived experience. His writings and reflections continue to be all too relevant to the reckoning that we are currently undergoing.\n\nVivian Martin on Sandra Cisneros\n\nReading books and short stories by Sandra Cisneros at a young age inspired me to be proud of my Mexican heritage and seek out books written by other Latinx writers. Cisneros' works are beloved by all and shine a bright light on the Latinx experience in the United States."
