Yeah, another usual night.\n\nBut then something happened… we all got to know each other way more than we have in MONTHS.\n\nIt felt so nice to be even better connected to the people who I’ve known for so long. #friendsaregreat\n\nSo what happened?\n\nFriend Questions. (This was originated by Justin Mares, thanks JM!)\n\nThese are 50 questions that get past the surface and help you ask things that get you to really know someone.\n\nHere are a few of my favorites:\n\nWhat’s left on your bucket list?\n\nWhat’s your recurring nightmare?\n\nWhat was your first screen name?\n\nYou can see the rest of them here.\n\nI’ve been using these with different groups of people and loving the conversations these questions spark up. Hope you enjoy them as much as I have."
