        "text": "When Gen. Stanley McChrystal decided to launch a sweeping review of Afghanistan strategy, he reached out to a small, but influential, group of national security wonks.\n\nMcChrystal's \"strategic assessment group\" included Fred Kagan of the American Enterprise Institute and his wife, Kimberly Kagan of the Institute for the Study of War; Stephen Biddle of the Council on Foreign Relations; Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies; Andrew \"Abu Muqawama\" Exum of the Center for a New American Security; and Jeremy Shapiro of the Brookings Institution.\n\nIt wasn't a particularly unusual move: The military -- like corporate America -- likes to bring in consultants for an outside view. Take the Joint Campaign Plan for Iraq, the document that lays out the U.S. military's near-term and long-term goals. That document gets a fresh look every year, and the most recent review included input from think-tankers.\n\nBut as our friend Laura Rozen observed, it was also a way to win the hearts and minds of an important constituency: The foreign-policy pundits and op-ed writers who would help sell the new strategy to the public.\n\nWhen ABC News, for instance, looks for someone to help explain the president's decision to send more troops, they turned to Kimberly Kagan. In this segment, Kagan plays the role of Beltway policy wonk, describing how U.S. troops will initially surge to southern Afghanistan (\"Those forces would go in, they would protect the population they would interact with local elders, village elders, try to figure out who those bad guys are in those communities and figure out different ways of making those communities safe,\" she says). But there's no mention of the fact that she played a role in shaping the strategy.\n\nUSA Today, by contrast, quotes Fred Kagan on the troop increase and the prospects for improved security (\"the good news is the administration does not seem to be planning that a rapid turnaround will take place\"), but also mentions that he helped McChrystal with the assessment. CNN, quoting Fred Kagan in this segment, does not.\n\nIt's not unusual to wear different hats in Washington, and it's up to the reporters to spell out when someone has interests at stake. That's not always easy to do on deadline, but there's a larger issue here about transparency in the marketplace of ideas, especially when it comes to national-security think-tanks.\n\nEarlier this year, when Loren Thompson of the not-for-profit Lexington Institute launched his own defense blog, bloggers rightly noted that Thompson was also a for-profit consultant to the defense industry. They raised questions about the extent to which Thompson's insights and analysis were colored by industry priorities, rather than strategy (and the extent to which the Lexington Institute was bankrolled by the same defense contractors).\n\nA similar issue came up in the recent flap over Peter Galbraith, the influential former American ambassador who argued on the op-ed pages for Kurdish autonomy, while failing to disclose his enormous financial stake in how Iraq would divide up its oil wealth. Writing about the Galbraith kerfluffle at Foreign Policy, Stephen Walt said:\n\nWe are drowning in information and opinion, much of it claiming to be objective and authoritative when it may in fact be inspired and funded by moneyed special interests eager to sell the public a story that advances their particular objectives. Most 'think tanks' in Washington portray themselves as objective, quasi-scholarly institutions (indeed, they increasingly give researchers endowed chairs and other quasi-academic titles), but unlike most universities, most think tanks remain heavily dependent on 'soft money' and are bound to be especially sensitive to what potential donors might be thinking.\n\nI'm not suggesting here that there's any funny business, but I do think we need to take a closer look at who's paying the bills, especially when you consider the remarkable clout of a select number of national-security think tanks. The 2007 Iraq surge was at least partly cooked up at AEI (the photo above shows the Kagans on a visit to Basra). Michael O'Hanlon of Brookings helped make the case for the surge, and argued that it was working. Graduates of CNAS have occupied top posts in the new administration.\n\nMore importantly, think tanks served as a sort of advance guard for a troop increase, with some pundits pushing early -- and hard -- for an escalated involvement. Here's Cordesman, arguing in early August for more troops and fewer allied caveats. And here's a CNAS brief from back in June. Not everyone one McChrystal's advisory team signed on to the surge -- Shapiro of Brookings, for one, did not advocate more troops -- but the panel's bipartisan design helped lend more weight to the general's recommendations.\n\nWalt proposed rating think-tanks on their financial transparency and willingness to disclose sources of income. Some of that information is readily available: With a few hours to kill, and a Guidestar.org account, you can take a closer look at the financial side of things, by examining the groups' \"Form 990\" filings with the IRS. Some of the think tanks do contract research for the government (CNAS, the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, or CSBA); others do not accept government funding (Heritage, AEI).\n\nBut there are still a lot of blanks to fill in here. Some think tanks do not disclose donor names (but if you look at the name of endowed chairs for scholars, you can figure out who is paying some of the bills). Big defense contractors -- Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Boeing -- also contribute to many of the defense-oriented think tanks, although getting specific amounts is tricky (Form 990 does not break down individual donations).\n\nWe here at Danger Room are not trying to knock these think tankers -- some of them, like Biddle, Cordesman and Exum, are as smart as they come. We're as fond of quoting them as anyone. But it's also worth asking who pays the piper.\n\nUPDATE: Good points from Matthew Yglesias on his think tank-funded blog.\n\n[PHOTO: U.S. Department of Defense]"
