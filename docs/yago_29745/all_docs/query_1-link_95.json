        "text": "HARDBALL\n\nDecember 19, 2012\n\nGuests: Martin O`Malley, Hedrick Smith, David Ignatius, Rajiv Chandrasekaran\n\nCHRIS MATTHEWS, HOST: Getting serious.\n\nLet`s play HARDBALL.\n\nGood evening. I`m Chris Matthews in Washington.\n\n\"Let Me Start\" tonight with this -- as I said, getting serious on guns in\n\nthe hands of dangerous people. The president`s given Vice President Biden\n\na month to deal with the lethal combination of semiautomatic guns, high-\n\ncapacity ammunition clips, mental illness and a violent culture. It`s the\n\nbrew that blew in Newtown, Connecticut. Is there something we can do?\n\nThe fiscal cliff -- the president now says we`re so close, it makes no\n\nsense to fail. Well, let`s see tonight how close is close and whether or\n\nnot the grownups can bring this to a healthy conclusion.\n\nAnd back to Benghazi. There are reports in the State Department`s have\n\nbeen -- the State Department`s being blamed here. Christopher Stevens\n\ndidn`t have the protection his people asked for. Did they ask enough? Did\n\nthey keep asking? The report says no.\n\nBut what if they had? Would they have gotten the reinforcements, or would\n\nthe CIA have said they didn`t want their cover blown? Again, let`s get\n\nserious.\n\nJoining me right now to talk about gun violence is Maryland governor Martin\n\nO`Malley and former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell.\n\nMartin O`Malley, thank you for joining us right now.\n\nPresident Obama spoke forcefully this afternoon about needing to take\n\naction on gun safety. Let`s listen.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This time, the words need to\n\nlead to action. We know this is a complex issue that stirs deeply held\n\npassions and political divides. We`re going to need to work on making\n\naccess to mental health care at least as easy as access to a gun. We`re\n\ngoing to need to look more closely at a culture that all too often\n\nglorifies guns and violence.\n\nAnd any actions we must take must begin inside the home and inside our\n\nhearts. But the fact that this problem is complex can no longer be an\n\nexcuse for doing nothing.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMATTHEWS: Governor O`Malley, thank you. And I`ve come to really respect\n\nyou and the other governors, and Governor Rendell, because I`ve watched it\n\nduring Sandy and I`ve watched it during what happened up in Newtown.\n\nGovernors really are the responsible adults. They have to take care of\n\ntheir people.\n\nSo in taking care of the people of Maryland, what do you think`s the most\n\nimportant thing, deal with the gun -- the issue of the semiautomatic\n\nweapons, the so-called assault rifles, dealing with the high-capacity gun\n\nclips, the ammunition clips, or the mental illness piece, or the violent\n\nculture piece?\n\nWhat can you go at in a month?\n\nGOV. MARTIN O`MALLEY (D), MARYLAND: Well, you have to go at all of those\n\nthings and you have to go at all of those things simultaneously. Clearly,\n\nschool safety`s an issue. Mental health access is an issue.\n\nBut there is no reason why we should have military assault weapons anyplace\n\nbut on the battlefield. They`re -- and most of the hunters that I know\n\nagree. I mean, we -- law enforcement is a piece of this.\n\nYou know, Governor Rendell, who I know you`re going to be talking to in\n\njust a second -- he and I both had the about highest title in the land, and\n\nthat was the title of mayor. We had to order police officers in the middle\n\nof the night to go into homes, and oftentimes they would bring out these\n\nassault weapons, these combat weapons that have no place in a civilized\n\nsociety.\n\nFor their safety, if only for their safety, we need responsible bans and\n\ncontrols on these military combat assault weapons that play no purpose in a\n\ncivil society.\n\nMATTHEWS: Governor Rendell, you`re right in the heart of it up in\n\nPennsylvania, which you and I know, and you better than me, how sensitive\n\npeople are about the gun ownership, the deer hunter culture, the whole\n\nthing.\n\nCan we get something done here in terms of the assault rifles, the\n\nammunition clips, et cetera?\n\nED RENDELL (D), FMR. PENNSYLVANIA GOV., MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, I\n\nthink the answer is absolutely yes, Chris. It just takes leaders, and the\n\npresident looks like he`s ready to lead, to do something that takes a tiny\n\nbit of courage but not much.\n\nLook, Governor O`Malley is absolutely right. There`s no excuse. I was on\n\nTV with Governor McDonnell from Virginia, and I asked him a question. Give\n\nme one good reason why ordinary citizens should have the semiautomatic\n\nrifles or clips that have more than 10 bullets in them? And there is no\n\ngood reason. There`s no answer to that. We`ve got to get rid of them.\n\nWe`ve got to make it impossible to buy a gun in this country -- you can`t\n\nbuy it on the Internet, you can`t buy it at a gun show -- without going\n\nthrough a background check. We`ve got to tighten the existing law now that\n\nsays states have a duty to report to the national computer that does all\n\nthese background checks when there are mental illnesses. But right now,\n\nit`s not being enforced because it`s too vague. It has to be specific.\n\nIf we do all those things, we can do it. And it`s easy to do because 74\n\npercent of NRA members in a Frank Luntz poll, Chris...\n\nMATTHEWS: Wow.\n\nRENDELL: ... said that they support the concept that no one can buy a gun\n\nwithout a background check.\n\nMATTHEWS: That`s impressive. Let`s heard the other side. I`m not sure it\n\nis the other side or why it is, but for some reason, people on the right,\n\nwhen you talk like this and talk common sense gun safety, they don`t\n\nchallenge it as much. They immediately go somewhere else and say, Well,\n\nhow about trying some other approach,because they don`t want to take on the\n\ngun lobby.\n\nHere`s Governor Bob McDonnell of Virginia talking to local TWOP radio\n\nyesterday. He`s open to the idea of arming school officials. Personally,\n\nI think that`s a separate question, but he offers that as an alternative to\n\ngun control.\n\nLet`s listen.\n\n(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)\n\nGOV. BOB MCDONNEL (R), VIRGINIA: If people were armed, not just a police\n\nofficer, but other school officials that were trained and chose to have a\n\nweapon, certainly, there would have been an opportunity to stop aggressors\n\ncoming into the schools. If a person like that was armed and trained,\n\ncould they have stopped the carnage in the classroom? Perhaps.\n\n(END AUDIO CLIP)\n\nMATTHEWS: OK, you know what a .38 special is. I used to have one when I\n\nwas a cop for a while. A .38 special and walk around, a guy 60, 70 years\n\nold, a retired cop or something -- that`s what you`re talking about,\n\nbasically. And they aren`t even talking about arming -- how do you know a\n\nschool teacher even knows how to use a gun, even if he went through\n\ntraining.\n\nHow does it stand (ph) up (ph) (INAUDIBLE) pulls out your gun, your cap\n\ngun, a revolver, and you`re up against an AK-47? What are they talking\n\nabout here?\n\nO`MALLEY: Could you imagine...\n\nMATTHEWS: Or does he say that school teachers should have AK-47s? What`s\n\nhe talking about there?\n\nO`MALLEY: Could you imagine, even if he`s only -- even if the governor\n\nwere only talking about security guards, school security guards -- could\n\nyou imagine, at an elementary school, what his gunbelt would have to look\n\nlike in order to repel an AK-47, a Bushmaster and the sort of armament that\n\ncame through that door? The...\n\nMATTHEWS: By the way, let me get back to the issue of -- I think this is a\n\ndodge. I think it`s talking about something besides gun control because\n\nthey don`t want to talk about it.\n\nWe can argue whether it should be a safety (ph). Maybe some schools in\n\ntouch crime areas, it`s all right to have a guard or something. Fine.\n\nThat`s not the issue we`re talking about here. We`re talking about high-\n\npowered rifles. We`re talking about multi-shot ammunition clips, where\n\nit`s up to 30 or whatever.\n\nO`MALLEY: And we`re also talking about something else, and I think the\n\npresident spoke to it today, and that is that sickness in our soul as a\n\nnation that is violence and the worship of violence and the glorification\n\nof violence.\n\nMATTHEWS: Well, in a free society -- let`s start on that -- OK. We can`t\n\nstop there being mental illness. It`s part of being born. Every once in a\n\nwhile, people have these problems, mental problems, like they have any\n\nother problem.\n\nYou go to the movie theater today, and every -- I go -- I`m a movie nut.\n\nAnd I`ll go movie -- I`ll pick the wrong movie, like \"History of Violence\"\n\nor something like that. And at the commercials that come on, the previews,\n\nthere`ll be six in a row of, Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!\n\nO`MALLEY: Right.\n\nMATTHEWS: I mean, some movies, I think people go for the absolute thrill\n\nof seeing a lot of people killed.\n\nO`MALLEY: And you know, Chris...\n\nMATTHEWS: How do you stop them from doing it?\n\nO`MALLEY: You know, becomes so all-pervasive in our society...\n\nMATTHEWS: How do you stop it?\n\nO`MALLEY: I think that events like this, tragedies like this -- I think\n\nwe`ve all been changed by this to some degree. We find it too easy, as a\n\ncountry, to accept one child being shot here and the city...\n\nMATTHEWS: OK...\n\nO`MALLEY: ... one child being shot there. And events like this make us\n\nwake up. Events like this...\n\nMATTHEWS: Are you going to stop people who go see \"Django\"?\n\nO`MALLEY: No, but...\n\nMATTHEWS: Tarantino movie. You`re going to get them to get -- stop seeing\n\n\"Jack Reacher,\" the new idiot movie by Tom Cruise? I mean, how do you stop\n\npeople from putting out idiot movies that are just people -- one person\n\nafter another getting killed?\n\nO`MALLEY: Well, you can`t stop that, Chris. But what you can do is put\n\nsensible restrictions in place so that people who are suffering from mental\n\nillnesses, so the people can`t go in and get assault weapons as easily as\n\nthey can go buy a pizza. It`s ridiculous.\n\nThere is no other civilized nation on the planet that allows combat\n\nmilitary weapons to be proliferated throughout our society as much as we\n\ndo. And there are very few societies that bury as many children year after\n\nyear after year from gun violence.\n\nMATTHEWS: OK. Governor Rendell, what would be a good record for...\n\nRENDELL: And Chris...\n\nMATTHEWS: ... for the president and the vice president -- I know you`ve\n\ngiven some thought to this. Put your own brew together here of ideas you\n\nthink would be good to come out of this that could pass 218 votes in the\n\nHouse, 50-some votes in the Senate, something that would actually get done\n\nin honor of these kids and their parents who have had their lives\n\npermanently -- either lost or permanently made miserable. What would be\n\ngood that they could say, come September, at the end of this year, you\n\nknow, at least something good came of this?\n\nRENDELL: Well, one, assault weapons -- ban assault rifles, and redefine\n\nit. Make it a much broader definition than even was in the original act.\n\nTwo, no clip or magazine sold with more than 10 bullets in it. Three, gun\n\nshow loophole closed. Four, no gun sales on the Internet anymore. And\n\nfive, that adjustment to the mental health statute that I told you about.\n\nBut Chris, what we`ve got to get over -- and I like Governor McDonnell and\n\nI think he does some good things, but he is being nothing but a coward and\n\na wuss when he won`t confront and answer the question.\n\nGovernor, give us one reason why any law-abiding American should have\n\naccess to a clip that has more than 10 bullets in it or to a semiautomatic\n\nassault weapon. There is no reason. There`s no answer. And the American\n\npeople understand that. So Governor McDonnell should be leading...\n\nMATTHEWS: OK...\n\nRENDELL: ... just like Joe Manchin.\n\nMATTHEWS: Imagine...\n\nRENDELL: Just like Joe Manchin.\n\nMATTHEWS: Imagine you`re out in -- out in western Pennsylvania, one of the\n\nwestern counties, Westmoreland or Washington, one of those counties out\n\nthere, Jefferson, whatever they are. I don`t even know them all. But\n\nthey`re conservative counties.\n\nAnd you know them all because you`ve been running out there. You sit there\n\nin a meeting, and some NRA guys in the meeting. And they`re out (ph) in\n\nthe meeting, and they say, You`re on a slippery slope here, Governor.\n\nFirst thing, you take away our multi-shot weapons. Next, you`ll go after\n\nmy -- you`ll be after my -- my deer rifle. What do you say to them? It`s\n\nnot a slippery slope. What do you say?\n\nRENDELL: I say, first of all, it isn`t a slippery slope and no one wants\n\nto take away your deer rifle, number one. Number two, every one of our\n\namendments are qualified. The 1st Amendment is and all of them are, and so\n\nis the 2nd Amendment.\n\nAnd number three, if you guys are so tough, how come you opposed me in\n\nthree statewide elections in the second highest NRA membership state in the\n\ncountry, and I got elected by 10 points, 12 points and 21 points, Chris.\n\nIf the NRA is so tough, how did I win all those elections?\n\nMATTHEWS: Because the city mice and the suburbanites love you! That`s why\n\nbecause you didn`t change their minds, you beat them!\n\nRENDELL: That`s the point.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nMATTHEWS: Yes, go ahead, Governor.\n\nRENDELL: I think Martin`s right. And in my second election, Chris -- in\n\nmy first election, I won 15 out of 67 counties. In my second election, I\n\nwon 33 out of 67 counties.\n\nMATTHEWS: Yes. Yes.\n\nRENDELL: So they`re not that tough. They are literally a paper tiger.\n\nThey`re the Wizard of Oz.\n\nO`MALLEY: Yes, and Chris, I think we ought...\n\nMATTHEWS: That`s because you were running against my brother and Lynn\n\nSwann!\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nMATTHEWS: I`m just teasing -- I`m teasing my brother there. You get 33\n\nstates -- counties. Did you find yourself successful, as a guy who`s known\n\nto be for gun control, in areas of the state that are very tough on that?\n\nDid you change any minds on other -- did you manage to win minds over of\n\nanybody on this issue? Because that`s where we are right now...\n\nRENDELL: Sure. In my...\n\nMATTHEWS: ... trying to find the hearts and minds of the hunters.\n\nRENDELL: When I ran for re-election, I carried counties like Mercer County\n\nin the west that are gun -- NRA counties because I had done other stuff,\n\nnot because I convinced them about guns.\n\nAnd by the way, one last thing. And Martin O`Malley has done this\n\nconsistently as governor. It`s about time that some of our elected\n\nofficials risked their future. If you have to risk losing, well, risk it\n\non protecting children.\n\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\n\nRENDELL: Risk it on doing something that is incredibly meaningful to stop\n\nthis carnage because if you`re not going to risk for something like that,\n\nthen why are you in elective office?\n\nO`MALLEY: Right.\n\nMATTHEWS: OK, let me bring that back to that question. We had a great\n\nliberal senator from Pennsylvania years ago, Joseph Clark (ph), a classic\n\nreformer. This is one of the things that killed him, gun control. It`s\n\nfor real. It can ruin a career.\n\nO`MALLEY: But our ability to grow as a people is also for real. Our\n\nability to evolve...\n\nRENDELL: I agree.\n\nO`MALLEY: ... our ability to look at the fact that our gun laws and the\n\nability to -- for people to purchase assault combat weapons makes us an\n\nanomaly in the free world.\n\nMATTHEWS: I know.\n\nO`MALLEY: I mean, those are -- those are things that are also that we`re\n\ncapable of, growing in our understanding of one another and also in what we\n\ncan do...\n\nMATTHEWS: OK, you`re...\n\nO`MALLEY: ... to put bad guys in jail, protect kids, and have sensible...\n\nMATTHEWS: We meet again here, and Governor -- I hope we meet before then,\n\nbut we meet here in September, at the end of this congressional session.\n\nDo you think we`ll have a bill that does something real and is signed by\n\nthe president on gun control?\n\nO`MALLEY: I do.\n\nMATTHEWS: Governor -- Governor Rendell, will we get something done?\n\nRENDELL: I think we`ll have it by the -- I think we`ll have it by the end\n\nof February, Chris.\n\nMATTHEWS: Well, that`s optimism. I hope we get it done. It`d be great to\n\nhave as a memorial to these -- I keep thinking what it was like to be 5\n\nyears old, and we can all remember it. We were real people with big souls,\n\nlittle bodies and big souls. We thought a lot about life. It meant so\n\nmuch to us as kids. Santa Claus was coming. We were very big in our\n\nhearts. And these kids -- oh! It`s just horrible to think about. The\n\nmore we think about this, the worse it`s going to be.\n\nThank you, Governor...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRENDELL: ... one of the mothers said -- the night of the memorial, one of\n\nthe mothers said, If we can pass sensible gun legislation, our kids won`t\n\nhave died in vain.\n\nMATTHEWS: Yes, and that is one hell of a price. But thank you so much,\n\nGovernor. You`re a good guy. Thank you. Happy holidays. Merry Christmas\n\nto you, Governor O`Malley.\n\nComing up -- coming up, another big story. What`s John Boehner up to with\n\nhis plan B? His plan would raise tax rates only for those making over a\n\nmillion. What about the first million they make? Under his plan, they get\n\noff scot-free. Is he serious about keeping this country from going over\n\nthe cliff? We`ll see. It`s getting interesting here, and as I said, it`s\n\ngetting serious all around tonight.\n\nPlus, an independent inquiry into the Benghazi attack criticizes the State\n\nDepartment for systemic failures in management, management deficiencies and\n\ninadequate security at that -- well, it wasn`t a consulate, it was that\n\nfacility which was basically a cover for a CIA operation out there. And\n\nthat could be significant for Secretary Clinton.\n\nAnd now how about this little sugar plum? While General David Petraeus was\n\nthe top American command in Afghanistan, he was being advised day to day on\n\nclassified matters by a couple of civilians with strong ties to the neocon\n\nmovement, Fred and Kimberly Kagan. Of all people, they were on the inside\n\nof a Democratic administration. Let`s get to the bottom of that very weird\n\narrangement. This was supposed to be a battle between the neocons and\n\nprogressives. How did the neocons get in the tent?\n\nAnd what does this Christmastime classic, \"It`s a Wonderful Life,\" have to\n\ndo with the fiscal cliff? Well, Mr. Boehner, meet Mr. Potter. And that`s\n\nin the \"Sideshow\" tonight.\n\nAnd this is HARDBALL, the place for politics.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nMATTHEWS: Robert Bork has died. The conservative legal scholar served as\n\nsolicitor general under Richard Nixon and fired Watergate special\n\nprosecutor Archibald Cox in the 1973 \"Saturday night massacre.\" He then\n\nserved as a circuit judge in the U.S. court of appeals for the District of\n\nColumbia.\n\nHe was nominated for the United States Supreme Court by Ronald Reagan in\n\n1987. Bork`s nomination was vigorously opposed by liberals, led by Senator\n\nTed Kennedy, who took to the Senate floor with a strong condemnation of\n\nBork`s positions on the rights of women and minorities. Robert Bork was\n\n85.\n\nWe`ll be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: And if you just pull back from the immediate, you know, political\n\nbattles, if you kind of peel off the partisan war paint, then we should be\n\nable to get something done.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMATTHEWS: Redskins (ph). Welcome back to HARDBALL. That was President\n\nObama this afternoon, actually, speaking about the fiscal cliff. On the\n\nother end of Pennsylvania Avenue, House Speaker John Boehner plans to send\n\nhis so-called plan B to the floor for a vote tomorrow. Plan B would keep\n\nBush tax cut rates for everyone making under $1 million a year. The\n\nquestion tonight is how does this deal get done?\n\nJoan Walsh is editor-at-large of Salon and an MSNBC political analyst.\n\nThere she is. And Hedrick Smith is author of \"Who Stole the American\n\nDream,\" a great reporter for years for \"The Times.\"\n\nLet`s go right now -- President Obama called on Republicans to cut a deal\n\nwith him, saying compromise is doable. Let`s watch him again. More on the\n\npresident today.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: What separates us is probably a few hundred million dollars. The\n\nidea that we would put our economy at risk because you can`t bridge that\n\ngap doesn`t make a lot of sense. So I`m going to continue to talk to the\n\nspeaker and the other leaders up in Congress.\n\nBut ultimately, they`ve got to do their job. Right now, their job is to\n\nmake sure that middle class taxes do not go up and that we have a balanced,\n\nresponsible package of deficit reduction. It is there for all to see. It\n\nis a deal that can get done.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMATTHEWS: Joan, it`s a bit like a sumo wrestling match, a -- a sport I\n\nknow nothing about, except what it looks like....\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nMATTHEWS: ... two giant guys sort of moving around each other, not\n\nactually engaging.\n\nI get a sense that the president is pretty confident that he has the upper\n\nhand here. And I get a sense from Boehner, who really is a guy who gives\n\nit away -- he could never play poker. This guy gives it away. It looks\n\nlike he doesn`t think he wants to enjoy January in the middle of this stew.\n\nHe wants it over with.\n\nIs this something we`re going to watch over the next 24, 48 hours to get to\n\nsome sort of conclusion? The president`s plane won`t take off for Hawaii\n\nprobably until Saturday afternoon at 3:00. There will be \"The Perils of\n\nPauline,\" if you will. They will be tied to the railroad tracks.\n\nAnd, in the end, they will get a deal this Saturday, because the end, it\n\nlooks like arithmetic at this point. It will end up being $500 million or\n\nsomething -- $500,000 a year. How do you see it? You`re a games person.\n\nYou know how they`re looking at this thing.\n\nJOAN WALSH, MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST: I -- you know, I`m not sure. We\n\nusually agree, Chris.\n\nI don`t know that I see it the same way.\n\nMATTHEWS: Go ahead.\n\nWALSH: John Boehner appears to be going off his own personal political\n\ncliff, because what he is doing -- if you just look back at the last few\n\ndays, clearly, it seemed as though he and the president were dealing with\n\neach other in relatively good faith. They were compromising.\n\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\n\nWALSH: They were both giving up things that were making their base\n\nunhappy.\n\nAnd then Boehner goes to plan B and says they`re going to vote on plan B.\n\nNow , today, he`s sticking to the plan B idea, except it sounds -- last\n\nthing I heard as I went in here is he`s going to attach some spending cuts,\n\nbecause he doesn`t control his caucus, Chris. He doesn`t -- he`s getting\n\nsuch major blowback from his far-right wing nut caucus that he can`t bring\n\nplan B without spending cuts.\n\nOnce you get into spending cuts, it gets much more complicated to get that\n\nRepublican caucus to hold together. So I am not sure that we are getting\n\ncloser to a deal here. I think that Boehner is just out of control of his\n\npeople.\n\nMATTHEWS: OK. OK.\n\nRick Smith, what do you think? Do you see a deal in the works here, or do\n\nyou have any thoughts that could add to this deal, make it work?\n\nHEDRICK SMITH, AUTHOR, \"WHO STOLE THE AMERICAN DREAM?\": I think this says\n\nBoehner`s in trouble.\n\nMy rule of thumb, whether or not I was covering arms control or politics,\n\nwhen you have serious negotiations going on, what`s going on in private is\n\nreal, what`s going on public is for show. So, we`re seeing a show here.\n\nIt looks to me as though Boehner is trying to get his caucus with him or to\n\ndemonstrate to that that going this way isn`t going to work. He`s going to\n\nhave to go...\n\nMATTHEWS: Yes, like if they don`t get the 218 tomorrow that Joan is\n\ntalking about to basically cut off the tax cut at a million, if that\n\ndoesn`t work because they don`t want to be known as the guys just looking\n\nout for the millionaires, then what`s he do with that information?\n\nSMITH: Well, he`s going to go over the cliff.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nMATTHEWS: You think he will go over.\n\nSMITH: Yes, he`s going to go over. Well, if he can`t get him on this\n\ndeal, he`s certainly not going to get them on the deal that he`s got the\n\npresident on.\n\nWALSH: Right.\n\nSMITH: Because the president is going to push him to go further.\n\nNo, I think he`s trying to show to them, even if we get this, we can`t get\n\nit from the president, we can`t get it from the Senate, we`re going to have\n\nto go further. In other words -- this is a bad deal for the middle class\n\nwhen you look at it.\n\nWALSH: Thank you.\n\nSMITH: Remember, the top 1 percent starts at $360,000. So Boehner`s\n\ngiving a bye to the biggest part of the top 1 percent. The middle class\n\nought to keep their eye on that.\n\nThe second thing is, he`s putting off the cuts, and therefore the automatic\n\ncuts are gone. And they`re going to hit the middle class badly. And this\n\nis a stall to jump it into next year.\n\nWALSH: Right.\n\nSMITH: So this is a desperation tactic. It`s not a tactic from strength.\n\nMATTHEWS: Joan, what do you -- let me just take a look. Here`s what the\n\npresident said.\n\nAfter the president spoke, Speaker Boehner came out and tried to sell his\n\nplan B. Let`s watch. Just before he starts talking, it basically says the\n\nBush tax cuts don`t go into effect if you make more than a million. But it\n\ndoes -- the Bush tax cuts would go into effect under his so-called plan B\n\nfor your first million of income. So, you would get a tax break for the\n\nfirst million. It`s only after that that you would be taxed. Let`s watch\n\nhis explanation.\n\nWALSH: Right.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Republicans continue to\n\nwork toward avoiding the fiscal cliff. The president`s offer of $1.3\n\ntrillion in revenues and $850 billion in spending reductions fails to meet\n\nthe test that the president promised the American people, a balanced\n\napproach.\n\nAnd I hope the president will get serious soon about providing and working\n\nwith us on a balanced approach. Tomorrow, the House will pass legislation\n\nto make permanent tax relief for nearly every American, 99.81 percent of\n\nthe American people.\n\nAnd then the president will have a decision to make. He can call on the\n\nSenate Democrats to pass that bill or he can be responsible for the largest\n\ntax increase in American history.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMATTHEWS: By the way, Boehner and the Republicans do their math\n\ndifferently than the president does.\n\nThe White House proposal considers their offer to be $1.2 trillion in new\n\nrevenues to $1.2 trillion in spending cuts. In other words, they have got\n\na totally balanced program.\n\nLet me ask you a question of politics. You write about the Medicare\n\ngetting hurt and screwed, if you will. If the Republican Party is -- got\n\n47 percent in the last election, and they sort of lost. We could say they\n\nlost. Sort of is not the right word, but they lost. The president won.\n\nWe talk about the 1 percent. Here, Boehner is trying to protect the top,\n\nwhat, 0.21 percent, right in the -- fifth of a percent.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSMITH: By his own numbers...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nMATTHEWS: But yet 47 percent of the people voted for the Republicans.\n\nI keep asking this question over and over again -- 47 percent of the voters\n\nvote for the less than 1 percent of the country`s economic interests. When\n\nare the 46 percent who vote Republican that aren`t getting a piece of the\n\naction here going to realize that they are the palace guard for the top?\n\nSMITH: Yes.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nMATTHEWS: Well, they are.\n\nSMITH: Chris, this has been going on for 30 years. We have had a\n\nsituation where we had wedge economics in the economy, where the top took\n\nall the money in business, and they left the middle-class workers with an\n\nabsolutely steady standard of living.\n\nAnd then in politics, we have had this. And we have had somebody go out\n\nlike this, politicians, and sometimes politicians from both parties,\n\nsaying, we`re protecting the middle class, when in fact they`re not.\n\nBoehner just said -- if you watched his numbers very carefully, he just\n\nsaid, we`re going to let all -- we`re going to let 0.81, we`re going to let\n\nmost of the 1 percent go. We`re only going to hit the tiny, tiny top of\n\nthat. So, he`s even...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nMATTHEWS: Here, back to you, Joan. You`re on the progressive side of\n\nthings, but why in the world do the Republican rank and file, a lot of\n\nthese members of Congress are not rich people -- why are they defending the\n\nvery top, to the point they have go to back to the tenth of 1 percent so\n\nthey don`t offend too many of their friends?\n\nWALSH: Because that`s who owns them. And that`s whose bidding they do.\n\nAnd it`s sad that so many middle-class people vote for them. But sometimes\n\nthey get confused because the Democratic Party doesn`t always seem to\n\nrepresent their interests either.\n\nAnd I have concerns of my own about some of the details of what the\n\npresident is willing to concede.\n\nMATTHEWS: OK.\n\nWALSH: So, you know...\n\nMATTHEWS: I know you will have more as the days go on. I know that is\n\ncoming. That fight`s coming.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nMATTHEWS: But I will just go back to the audience here who is watching; 47\n\npercent of the country defends the interests of less than 1 percent.\n\nAnd now we see in the final battle here, when it`s down to the short hairs,\n\nwhen it`s really going to decide whether we have a fiscal cliff going over\n\nor not, and even then, they`re saying, wait a minute, our number one job\n\nhere is to defend, as you were going over the number, 99.81 -- that leaves\n\n0.19. That`s one-fifth of 1 percent at the top they`re going down for.\n\nAnyway, thank you. Good luck with the book.\n\nSMITH: Thanks.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nMATTHEWS: What is the name of your book?\n\nSMITH: \"Who Stole The American Dream?\"\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSMITH: And, remember, almost half of the members of Congress are\n\nmillionaires.\n\nMATTHEWS: Yes, I know.\n\nSMITH: And 49 percent of members of Congress are millionaires.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nMATTHEWS: But the other half aren`t.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSMITH: Yes. But, I mean, it`s amazing.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nMATTHEWS: Some of them live in basements with three or four other guys.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nMATTHEWS: Don`t get the idea they`re all rich either. I know -- I know\n\nfour guys that live together. And one of them gets the living room every\n\nnight.\n\nAnyway, thank you, Joan Walsh.\n\nI don`t feel sorry for them. They have great jobs, but they`re not what\n\nyou would call rich.\n\nAnyway, Hedrick Smith, thank you.\n\nSMITH: Thank you.\n\nMATTHEWS: Up next: Someone needs to tell David Letterman that Mitt Romney\n\nhas already lost. You don`t have to keep beating this guy like an old\n\nhorse. Letterman is still twisting that knife into Mr. Mitt.\n\nAnd this is HARDBALL, the place for politics.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nMATTHEWS: Back to HARDBALL, and now to the \"Sideshow.\"\n\nWe all know Mr. Potter. Remember him from the movie classic \"It`s a\n\nWonderful Life\" we see at Christmastime? He`s the greedy businessman\n\nplayed by Lionel Barrymore, definitely not known for his empathy.

It`s a lump of coal, because you have\n\nbeen far too naughty.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMATTHEWS: Well, in a recent interview with \"People\" magazine, President\n\nObama was asked what he learned from seeing the movie \"Lincoln.\"\n\nAnd here he is -- quote -- \"As a rule, if you`re president of the United\n\nStates, you shouldn`t compare yourself to Lincoln in any way.\"\n\nNot everyone thinks Lincoln comparisons should be off-limits. When Florida\n\nRepublican Allen West was asked about his future plans after losing\n\nreelection to Congress he said -- quote -- \"Always remember, Abraham\n\nLincoln only served one term in Congress too.\"\n\nFinally, David Letterman is seeing -- is still finding ways to needle Mitt\n\nRomney, even with the election over.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, \"LATE SHOW WITH DAVID LETTERMAN\")\n\nDAVID LETTERMAN, HOST, \"LATE SHOW WITH DAVID LETTERMAN\": I heard the\n\nstrangest thing. I don`t know if it`s true, but just before I came out\n\nhere. And it`s weird because it has to do with the economy of the world\n\nand financial times and the situation like that.

Hillary Clinton`s State Department, it is\n\ngetting the blame for bad management and inadequate security. And that`s\n\nahead here tonight.\n\nAnd this is HARDBALL, the place for politics.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHAMPTON PEARSON, CNBC CORRESPONDENT: I`m Hampton Pearson with your CNBC\n\n\"Market Wrap.\"\n\nAs fiscal cliff talks continue to stall, so do the markets, the Dow falling\n\nnearly 99 points, and the Nasdaq and S&P both shedding 10 points.\n\nGeneral Motors traded higher after announcing it will buy back about 200\n\nmillion shares from the U.S. Treasury, the government bailout essentially\n\nreversing itself.\n\nAnd a very merry Christmas in offices everywhere. A new survey found 72\n\npercent of executives plan to hand out holiday gifts.\n\nThat`s it from CNBC, first in business worldwide -- now back to HARDBALL.\n\nMATTHEWS: Welcome back to HARDBALL.\n\nA damning, damning new report from an independent investigation on the\n\nSeptember 11 attack on Benghazi -- in Benghazi -- criticizes the State\n\nDepartment for -- quote -- \"systemic failures in leadership and management\n\ndeficiencies.\"\n\nOverall, the report takes the department to task for failing to provide\n\nbetter security in the run-up to the attack. In the wake of the report,\n\nthree State Department officials have resigned, including the assistant\n\nsecretary of state for diplomatic security and his deputy.\n\nHere`s what the chairs of the investigation, former Ambassador Tom\n\nPickering and former Joint Chiefs Chairman Mike Mullen, had to say today.\n\nLet`s listen.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTHOMAS PICKERING, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: Frankly,\n\nthe State Department had not given Benghazi the security, both physical and\n\npersonnel resources it needed.\n\nADM. MICHAEL MULLEN, FORMER JOINTS CHIEFS CHAIRMAN: The board found that -\n\n- that the security posture at the special mission compound was inadequate\n\nfor the threat environment in Benghazi and in fact grossly inadequate to\n\ndeal with the attack that took place. The support the post needed was\n\noften lacking and left to the working level to resolve.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMATTHEWS: We have gotten more of that on the report and what it means for\n\nHillary Clinton, perhaps, the secretary of state, who heads that\n\ndepartment.\n\nAndrea Mitchell is NBC`s chief foreign affairs correspondent. And David\n\nIgnatius is \"The Washington Post\"`s foreign columnist. He handles all\n\nthese matters. He`s also associate editor of \"The Washington Post.\"\n\nI`m going to talk about -- I called you today on this because it baffled me\n\nin reading it. There`s two apparently contradictory reports in the report.\n\nOne said there were repeated requests to try to get security forces brought\n\nto that Benghazi facility. And then, later on, it said that the people\n\ndidn`t demonstrate strong and sustained advocacy for more security forces.\n\nWhat is it, they didn`t do enough, they did enough? How come they weren`t\n\nprotected?\n\nANDREA MITCHELL, NBC CHIEF FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: It`s both.\n\nIt`s that they repeatedly requested more security. And then, when they saw\n\nthat there were budget cuts and that there were people, diplomatic security\n\nofficials, being rotated out, they didn`t push hard enough.\n\nSo they asked, they were denied, and then didn`t come back to them and\n\ndidn`t really, you know, rattle the cage.\n\nCHRIS MATTHEWS, HOST: OK. Now, the real tough question. Is all that just\n\ndoggerel passing of the buck? Is the real issue if they asked and asked\n\nand asked, if they`ve gone all the way to the top, would they still have\n\nbeen given a contingent, a significant military force there given the CIA\n\nactivities in that area? Would they have been given what they wanted no\n\nmatter how they asked for it?\n\nMITCHELL: I don`t believe so. I did ask that question of Senator Corker\n\ntoday who was -- who attended the classified briefing. I said was all of\n\nthis because it was a low profile. They didn`t need a consulate in\n\nBenghazi. This was a mission, not even a consulate.\n\nBut the real impact there was that they had a CIA annex, an outpost, that\n\nthey had not informed the Libyan militias about. One reason why the\n\nmilitias could not go to help them.\n\nMATTHEWS: So, we couldn`t have a show of force there. We couldn`t have a\n\nstrong contingent.\n\nMITCHELL: They didn`t want a big footprint. But Corker said he doesn`t\n\nthink that really was a problem, in their defense. He said he thought it\n\njust was a failure from -- at all sorts of levels. Not at the top. They\n\nabsolved Hillary Clinton herself of responsibility, although she says she\n\ntakes the blame.\n\nMATTHEWS: Well, that`s a general acknowledgement of ministerial\n\nresponsibility.\n\nThe night of in the horror of the attack, the peak of the attack, was there\n\nany way to get -- I hear from a lot of conservative people. A people are\n\njust pro-military, friends of mine. They believe -- they have been led to\n\nbelieve that we could have gotten forces to that facility in time to save\n\nthe ambassador and the other people.\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS, THE WASHINGTON POST: This report is quite clear in saying\n\nthat whole line of argument that has been used by people on the right was\n\nwrong. That -- it says the interagency response was appropriate and\n\ntimely. But they were not asked --\n\nMATTHEWS: Did we have drone potential? Did we have forced protection that\n\nwas available we didn`t bring in?\n\nIGNATIUS: Evidently, there were not drones. Evidently, there were not AC-\n\n130 gunships, which would have been an alternative.\n\nThe terrible fact -- I think the report is too easy on the military,\n\nfrankly. The terrible fact is there were no military assets close enough\n\nto protect those young people on the roof of the annex who were killed by a\n\nsimple mortar attack. I mean, it`s really inexcusable --\n\nMITCHELL: Seven hours after this started, the problem is that the North\n\nAfrica command that had been started appropriately because of al Qaeda`s\n\ngrowing influence there in North Africa, was not located in Italy or any\n\nplace close to North Africa. They couldn`t get there in time.\n\nThere was a drone that did get there and took pictures overhead.\n\nIGNATIUS: But it wasn`t armed.\n\nMITCHELL: Unarmed.\n\nMATTHEWS: OK. Let`s bring this to human terms. When something goes\n\nwrong, people like to find somebody who`s responsible. There isn`t always\n\nsomebody responsible. Some things break, you know?\n\nYou start on this -- is it true they were tough in their report? The\n\nPickering and the Mullen report. But in the end, are they saying this\n\ncould have been avoided, really?\n\nMITCHELL: Yes, they are.\n\nMATTHEWS: If Chris Stevens wanted to go into a dangerous area, could he\n\nhave been protected?\n\nIGNATIUS: The two phrases that you heard Admiral Mullen used in the clip\n\nthat introduced this segment, first that there were inadequate sources\n\nthere. Meaning that there were requests for more forces, the diplomatic\n\nsecurity bureau in the State Department didn`t act in a timely way. The\n\nnearest bureau which overseas that consulate, that mission, didn`t act in a\n\ntimely way, and the forces were grossly inadequate -- an unusual phrase to\n\nuse in --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nMATTHEWS: Was that to save money?\n\nMITCHELL: Partly to save money and partly to rely on the host. We don`t\n\nhave Marines at these kinds of places. We rely on the Libyans. Libyans\n\nwere not able. They don`t have -- they didn`t have a national government.\n\nThey had these local militias that ran -- they have overhead they have\n\ncamera videos, rather --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nMATTHEWS: OK. Here`s the question -- why did everyone think they were\n\nsafe? Why did they think it was safe going in there?\n\nMITCHELL: He -- that was part of his DNA. He had been in Benghazi during\n\nthe entire civil war before he was ambassador. But we saw -- we had\n\npictures shown -- videos shown last week to the Senate of the Libyan\n\nmilitia getting into a pickup truck and high tailing it out of there at the\n\nfirst sign of trouble.\n\nMATTHEWS: Will Hillary Clinton, the secretary of state, as the minister in\n\ncharge, have to eventually face the lions on this?\n\nMITCHELL: Yes.\n\nIGNATIUS: Yes, she will. This is on her watch.\n\nLet me make one more point, Chris. One of the most important things in\n\nthis report in terms of long-term consequences is it says the United States\n\ncan no longer depend in high-risk areas on local security forces.\n\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\n\nIGNATIUS: Meaning, we`re going to have to have our own forces either there\n\nor close enough.\n\nMATTHEWS: Will they let us bring them in?\n\nIGNATIUS: No. I mean, that`s why this is -- this is a new world, this is\n\nthe new normal as described in this report.\n\nMITCHELL: It means we can`t be in these posts.\n\nIGNATIUS: Some of them we`re not going to be able --\n\nMATTHEWS: It`s the \"Lebanonization\" of the world it seems.\n\nAnyway, thank you. You don`t want to hear that. But that tends to look\n\nlike.\n\nAnyway, thank you as always.\n\nMITCHELL: Thank you.\n\nMATTHEWS: I call you when I need knowledge.\n\nMITCHELL: I come whenever you call.\n\nMATTHEWS: Thanks, Mr. Ignatius, sir.\n\nUp next -- member of the Legion of Honor -- up next, David Petraeus was\n\nsupposed to be the top commander in Afghanistan, so why was he being\n\nadvised by Fred and Kimberly Kagan at the American Enterprise Institute, a\n\ncouple of civilians with strong ties to the neocon movement? Who won the\n\nlast election? I thought the neocons lost. Apparently, they`re running\n\nour war operations.\n\nThis is HARDBALL. We`ve got some questions. We`ll be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nMATTHEWS: Wow. President Obama`s job approval is at its highest point\n\nsince the death of bin Laden. According to a new \"Washington Post\"/ABC\n\nNews poll, 54 percent approve the job the president is doing now, 50\n\npercent say they approve of his handling of the economy. It hasn`t been\n\nthat high in 2 1/2 years. That`s got to help as the president tries to\n\nnail down a deal with Speaker Boehner.\n\nBy the way, \"Time\" magazine named President Obama today as its Person of\n\nthe Year for 2012.\n\nWe`ll be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nMATTHEWS: We`re back.\n\nDavid Petraeus, the once-lionized general-turned-CIA-director, resigned\n\nlast month after it was revealed he had been engaged in an extramarital\n\naffair with his biographer Paula Broadwell. Well, today, \"The Washington\n\nPost\" on the front page reports on another scandal, albeit this one not\n\ninvolving sex. It has to do with the incredible acts of some friends of\n\nhis were given while Petraeus was running the war in Afghanistan.\n\nThe friends were two civilians, Fred and Kimberly Kagan, prominent neo-\n\nconservative analysts. They were provided desks, e-mail access and top\n\nsecurity clearance to pore through intelligence reports.\n\nAccording to \"The Post\", the four-star general made the Kagans de facto\n\nsenior advisors, a status that afforded them numerous private meetings in\n\nhis office, priority travel across the war zone and the ability to read\n\nhighly secretive transcripts of intercepted Taliban communications.\n\nEven Fred Kagan acknowledged to \"The Post,\" the arrangement was, quote,\n\n\"strange and uncomfortable at times.\"\n\nRajiv Chandrasekaran wrote in today`s story in \"The Post\". And David Corn\n\nis the Washington chief for \"Mother Jones\" and, of course, an MSNBC\n\npolitical analyst.\n\nRajiv, thanks for that great reporting. I love it when you make news.\n\nHoly cow, I was about to say when I read \"The Post\" front page today -- as\n\na student, in a very negative way of the Iraq war, who`s always suspected\n\nanybody who pushed that war, was pushing an agenda that wasn`t necessarily\n\nfor a good cause.\n\nThe Kagans, Robert Kagan, Fred Kagan, Kimberly Kagan were prominently\n\nfeatured on your newspaper all the time pushing the latest neocon war.\n\nNow, we find out they`re in bed with General Petraeus who reports to\n\ncommander-in-chief, Barack Obama.\n\nHow did they get inside when they were in the other side ideologically?\n\nRAJIV CHANDRASEKARAN, THE WASHINGTON POST: Because, Chris, four-star\n\ngenerals have a lot of leeway when they`re out half way around the world.\n\nLook, this arrangement wasn`t well known at the White House, at the\n\nPentagon, by senior officials who involved in the administration.\n\nCertainly, if they knew, they would have objected the extraordinary access\n\nthat the Kagans got.\n\nPetraeus was able to do this just because he was the general and managed to\n\nget what I understand his lawyers to sign off on the arrangement which, you\n\nknow, they got this desk, they got the security clearance, they traveled\n\naround the war zones, they got face time with him regularly -- very\n\ninfluential approach there.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nMATTHEWS: Who`s he off? Who is Petraeus of? Who is he off? Who his\n\npeople? Is he part of the neocon crowd? Is he one of them, those people\n\nthat pushed us --\n\nCHANDRASEKARAN: No.\n\nMATTHEWS: Let`s put it this way, heavily encouraged the war in Iraq? Or\n\nis he part of the more progressive stream of the presidents which is very\n\nskeptical about these foreign interventions? Which world is he -- is\n\nPetraeus part of them? Part of the political other side, if you will?\n\nCHANDRASEKARAN: I don`t think Petraeus neatly fits in the world of\n\nneocons, but he certainly believes in, you know, the transformative power\n\nof the military. The Kagans were very helpful to him with the intellectual\n\narchitecture in the surge of Iraq. They supported more forces in\n\nAfghanistan, which is where Petraeus was. And they helped him sure up some\n\nof his bona fides with Republicans on Capitol Hill who, by this point, were\n\nstarting to get new doubts about the war in Afghanistan.\n\nMATTHEWS: I don`t mind them playing a liaison role. But I wonder about\n\nthese advisory roles.\n\nLet`s go to David Corn who shares my views about this thing.\n\nIt seems to me that you have a very interesting situation -- I`m trying to\n\nthink of a parallel, but I can`t think of one.\n\nDAVID CORN, MOTHER JONES: No.\n\nMATTHEWS: Where people from the other ideological wing or spectrum of the\n\ncountry have found their way into a controlling situation on a war front.\n\nCORN: Well, what they is they have these two think tankers.\n\nMATTHEWS: American Enterprise`s senior fellows.\n\nCORN: Senior fellows, they burrow their way in. Neocons tend to be very\n\ngood at burrowing. They burrow their way in and they created -- as Rajiv`s\n\nwonderful piece, you know, details -- lots of confusion in the chain of\n\ncommand. People don`t know how to relate to them.\n\nAre they spies for Petraeus? Are they conveying orders from Petraeus?\n\nAnd, you know, how did this come to be?\n\nIt gets to the issue that we talked about earlier this year --\n\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\n\nCORN: -- which is David Petraeus` judgment because he was so lionized and,\n\nyou know, worshiped as America`s greatest general since Washington --\n\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\n\nCORN: -- he seemed to be able to feel like you get away with things. He\n\ngot into that scandal with Paula Broadwell, and this happens obviously\n\nbefore that. But he feels he has a license to do things that other\n\ngenerals couldn`t.\n\nMATTHEWS: Let`s get at the heart of this surge strategy which worked in\n\nIraq, I`m told. People say. That`s eventual wisdom, applied then to\n\nAfghanistan. How are the Kagans involved with that whole strategy?\n\nCHANDRASEKARAN: The Kagans pushed the surge strategy. In op-eds in my\n\nnewspaper and other newspapers, they were vocal proponents for it. And\n\nthen they were proponents for taking a much tougher line against a various\n\nTaliban factions. In fact, the irony here is that while David Petraeus was\n\ntalking a good game on counterinsurgency, on using troops to protect\n\ncivilian populations in Afghanistan, what the Kagans were lobbying to do\n\nwas to use more of those troops to conduct strikes against Taliban\n\ninfiltration --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nMATTHEWS: Thank you. We`ll redo more on this later. We`ve got to go now.\n\nBut I salute you, Rajiv, because your story met the test of Ben Bradleys.\n\nHe said, I want to pick up the newspaper and say, holy -- I can`t use the\n\nword here, holy. And when you say that, you know you got some. This\n\nstory, I want everybody tonight to go back and look it up on Google,\n\nwhatever else, study this story. This is a story of penetration that ought\n\nto understand.\n\nRajiv Chandrasekaran, thank you much for joining us from \"The Washington\n\nPost.\"\n\nAnd, David Corn, as always.\n\nWe`ll be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nMATTHEWS: Let me finish tonight with this:\n\nI`d like to know why General Petraeus was taking day-to-day advice from\n\npeople on the other side of the Iraq war argument. Fred and Kimberly Kagan\n\nare hawks. They share the ideology of those who backed the Iraq war. Why\n\nare they on the inside of an administration elected based on its opposition\n\nto the Iraq war?\n\nI`m one of those who believed from square one that the war in Iraq was an\n\nideological war pushed by the outset by those who wanted us to overthrow\n\nthe Iraq government and install ourselves in Baghdad. They got their way\n\nunder a less informed president that was George W.\n\nNow, we discovered that a pair of them, the Kagans, have been right there\n\nin the room with the head of the Afghan mission today, advising him every\n\nstep of the way.\n\nWhy? Why did General Petraeus assume the right to allow people who\n\nrepresent the very opposite of President Obama`s philosophy to advise him?\n\nWhat agenda was he seeking here? What was he buying into? Why was he\n\nbuying the hawkish agenda of those who advocated war in Iraq in the first\n\nplace?\n\nIf so, why was he working for President Obama who stood out there against\n\nthat war?\n\nI have to think that Petraeus either doesn`t understand politics or\n\nideology, or he shapes his ideology or accepts the ideology of those who\n\nstood against Obama from the beginning.\n\nThis is really strange. As he puts it, really strange, and someone in the\n\nadministration better start paying attention to who is getting into the\n\ntent and who they are indeed working for. Backing the Iraq war and the\n\nmental behind it is no small thing.\n\nAnd that`s HARDBALL for now. Thanks for being with us.\n\n\"POLITICS NATION\" with Al Sharpton starts right now.\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.
