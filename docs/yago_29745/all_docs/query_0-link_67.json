        "text": "Check out this Wall Street Journal interview with NATO's top military officer, Admiral Rob Bauer. Admiral Bauer emphasizes, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not only the military that has to prepare for war or the governments that have to prepare for war. The businesses have to prepare for war.‚Äù This statement highlights critical issues regarding the wartime readiness of our corporate sectors. As the world faces increased security challenges, the intersection between the military and private industry grows more significant. The sharp increase in venture capital investments in defense and military startups amidst recent global conflicts is a testament to this evolving landscape. Do you think European and American companies are actively developing their wartime contingency plans? #BusinessStrategy #NATO #Leadership #Defense #WSJ #VC #Security\n\nA Call to Action: Lessons from Ukraine for the Future Force Fifty years ago, the US Army faced a strategic inf lection point after a failed counterinsurgency effort in Vietnam. In response to lessons learned from the Yom Kippur War, the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command was created to reorient thinking and doctrine around the conventional Soviet threat. Today‚Äôs Army must embrace the Russo-Ukrainian conflict as an opportunity to reorient the force into one as forward-thinking and formidable as the Army that won Operation Desert Storm. This article suggests changes the Army should make to enable success in multidomain large-scale combat operations at today‚Äôs strategic inflection point. After examining multidomain operations during the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the study team asserts that the Army should reassess the roles and responsibilities of headquarters at echelon to account for multidomain operations and other emerging organizational structures like the Penetration Division. The Army must expand linkages between joint exercises, division-level warfighters, and combat training rotations to teach synchronization of convergence and combined arms within the context of multidomain operations. DePuy‚Äôs ‚Äúhow to fight‚Äù manuals of the past reinvented as chat platforms fueled by generative AI knowledge bases and layered on top of National Training Center rotations, division and corps warfighter exercises, and small-unit training would serve as the ultimate convergence activity. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are buying lessons with blood that not only preserve their freedom but can also help the US Army deter and, if necessary, fight and win future wars at a lower cost of life and treasure. It would dishonor those soldiers‚Äô sacrifices and the memory of General DePuy not to pay full attention.\n\nRussian President Mr. Putin sadly had to decide and start the special military operation engaging in an effort to protect the Russian people living in Ukraine, the security of his country and citizens due to many extremist powers within and around the Ukrainian government. All attempts from the Russian side had failed to produce results through the Minsk agreements which were not honored and many attempts through diplomacy. Our intelligence service and government failed to understand that Russia as a whole love and respect their country as we do here in the US. Additionally we underestimated their potential continuing aggressively to weaken Russia using Ukraine and their government. Meanwhile rallying our allies in order to have support. We froze Russian assets billions, we adopted Ukraine and paid for all their needs, from state of the art military supplies, training, intelligence services, to catering for all the warriors and destroying their gas pipelines to Europe. Still not enough why? What happened? Why is Russia still up and running? McDonald's closed in Russia and their still making hamburgers and fries? What's going on? Can this be an act of God since this is happening in his kingdom?\n\nThus we may know that there are five essentials for #victory: 1 He will win who knows when to #fight and when not to fight. 2 He will win who knows how to handle both #superior and #inferior forces. 3 He will win whose army is animated by the same #spirit throughout all its ranks. 4 He will win who, #prepared himself, waits to take the enemy #unprepared. 5 He will win who has military #capacity and is not interfered with by the #sovereign. #SunTzu\n\nIt is worth listening to this interview with NATO‚Äôs top military officer, Admiral Rob Bauer, who says China will be weaponizing economic dependencies in the same way Russia did with energy within the next 5-10 years. Bauer makes clear that this is a problem for governments but also for companies, which - for their own good - will have to focus much more on resilience and less singularly on short-term profits. Watch from 5:50üëá\n\nAnother interesting day (and a not so great picture) today, lecturing about the battle of Arras in 1940 and the relevance of the lessons learnt for today's military. If you are interested in topics such as this, let me know and we could perhaps organise something through CHACR (for military audiences) or you could study similar subjects through our Modern War Studies postgraduate course at the University of Buckingham. #lloydclark #military #chacr #militaryhistory\n\n#ammunition #nato #556x45 #SS109 The 5.56√ó45mm NATO (official NATO nomenclature 5.56 NATO, commonly pronounced \"five-five-six\") is a rimless bottlenecked intermediate cartridge family developed in the late 1970s in Belgium by FN Herstal. It consists of the SS109, L110, and SS111 cartridges. On 28 October 1980, under STANAG 4172, it was standardized as the second standard service rifle cartridge for NATO forces as well as many non-NATO countries. Though they are not entirely identical, the 5.56√ó45mm NATO cartridge family was derived from and is dimensionally similar to the .223 Remington cartridge designed by Remington Arms in the early 1960s. #pewpew #military #army #specialprice #gunday #lawenforcement #readystock #pewpewlifestyle #lawenforcement"
