Now he’s running for Congress to take on the corrupt politicians and special interests who put themselves ahead of us. Josh will always put Upstate first, and Josh doesn’t take any corporate PAC money–because his vote isn’t for sale.\n\nJosh is fighting for everyday people–not corporate PACs–so they’re the ones powering this campaign, one door knock, phone call, and contribution at a time. If you believe in Josh’s vision for Upstate New York, join the team today!"
