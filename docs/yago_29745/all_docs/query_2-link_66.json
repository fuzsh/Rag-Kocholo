        "text": "Jessica Bloomfield\n\nCurrent Pursuits:\n\nI lived in Maui for six months after graduation, and then moved to San Francisco, where I am currently selling advertising for two business magazines with G&J USA Publishing. However, I plan to move back to Maui next September.\n\nCatherine \"Katie\" Campbell\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nAfter taking a year off and living in England, I'm back at school. I'm earning my certification and masters degree in teaching at Sacred Heart University in Connecticut. At the current time I'm an intern at New Canaan High School and will student-teach with their history department this fall (2005). I am also keeping myself busy as a volleyball coach at the high school and I'm loving it! Fingers crossed I'll get a \"real\" job by next year!\n\nCarolyn Depoian\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI am currently an attorney at a law firm called Rapport Meyers LLP in Hudson, N.Y. After Skidmore I went to Tulane Law School and then returned to the area for work in late 2009. American Studies is a great major for anyone considering a legal career. The research and writing skills are of course invaluable, but the major also provided me with a huge leg up in my constitutional law classes. It was helpful to have a comprehensive understanding of the historical context of the founding of our government.\n\nSamia Elia\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nAfter graduation I moved to Washington, D.C., and accepted a position as public affairs specialist at the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nJude Mooney Fricano\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\n\"Jude reports that \"\"Our daughter, Elizabeth Grace (Ellie) Fricano was born March 22, 2006, 5:22 p.m., 7 lbs, 14oz, 22 in.\"\" While working full-time as a VP of sales and marketing for a multi-office travel agency, I pursued my degree through UWW. The faculty of the American Studies Department is the reason for my choosing it as my major. I used to say, \"\"My head is in the business world and my heart is in American studies.\"\" I am currently an auto underwriting team Leader for State Farm Insurance in Malta, N.Y. My husband and I bought a house just outside the city with a large yard for our growing lab, Jack!\n\nUPDATE, Summer '09: Our family has moved to Charlottesville, Va., as I took a leadership promotion with State Farm Insurance. Ellie is now 3 1/2 and enjoying her new preschool as we explore this gorgeous new area. The learning hasn't stopped for me as I now continue to pursue insurance designations!\"\n\nJoe Hooker\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI am currently working in the financial services industry for PFPC. My office is in King of Prussia, Pa., a suburb of Philadelphia, not far from my hometown. I am debating whether or not to take the LSATs and dreaming of the lazy days I squandered while at Skidmore.\n\nKristin Dutcher Jonash\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI am currently living in Boston and approaching the last semester of my social work graduate program. I am attending Simmons College near Fenway in Boston. Throughout school I have worked in a pilot high school program for students with specialized social and emotional needs and the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Hospital in both their Emergency Department and Center for Violence Prevention and Recovery program. I am looking forward to graduation but have really enjoyed being back at school. My American studies degree has provided me a background useful in understanding some of the cultural and institutional factors that affect all client populations. It has been a broad foundation from which to draw knowledge that impacts or informs both my work and life almost every day. Thank you for a wonderful education.\n\nElizabeth Menard\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nThree years after graduating from Skidmore, I made a career change to graphic and web design. I worked for two years at Myriad Inc. in Boston doing all of their front-end web production. In February of this year, I joined the Web Marketing Department at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. While I don't use my American Studies degree directly, it provided me with a broad foundation for building a career in design and marketing, and it gave me a greater appreciation for the American past. I currently live in Somerville, Mass.\n\nJen Nathan\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nJen lives in Asheville, N.C., with her husband, two dogs, two cats, and six chickens. She grows everything from hops to artichokes and is a floral designer for the local wedding industry on the weekends. She also has a crafting business named after her grandmothers Bertha & Rose, where she sells jewelry and hand-stuffed pillows at several local stores. Jen also spent seven years as a producer for National Public Radio affiliates across the country.\n\nLori Pelech\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nIt's the spring of '05 and I'm in my seventh month in London, studying human geography at King's College. The city is wonderful, and classes have just ended, which means I will now be dividing my time between my thesis and travel (and only minimal procrastination, I hope). My thesis will actually draw on my American studies roots, as I'll be looking at some cultural and historical aspects of apple farming in New York. When I'm finished up here (sometime in mid-August), I plan on returning to the States to either teach high school or work for an environmental NGO. Doing my graduate work abroad has worked well. There are 100 master's students from 35 countries in our department, and the fact that master's courses in the UK are only a year long saves you both time and money. Best wishes to everyone in the department.\n\nAlexis Reynolds\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nAfter finishing my master's degree in historic preservation, I moved to Austin, Texas, where I am working for Mead & Hunt, a cultural resource management firm. I am an in-house contractor with the Texas Department of Transportation and as of this writing, I'm still waiting to see my first armadillo!\n\nHelen Thompson\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI am currently certified by the Unity Healing Center (2004) as a Reiki master-practitioner, and I am pursuing holistic medicine and energy work as an occupation. As of now, I am still in Saratoga.\n\nKenneth Dunbar\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI am willing to bet that I'm the closest alumnus to the American Studies Department... In July of 2002, after completing my M.A. in U.S. social and cultural History from SUNY Albany, I accepted a job at Skidmore as an assistant director of the Admissions Office. It's great to be back on campus, and I couldn't ask for a better place to live! Admissions can be very challenging but rewarding work, and my writing, researching, and speaking skills learned as an American studies major are revisited every day as I share Skidmore's unique characterisitcs with prospective students, families, and high school counselors across the country and the world. Hope to see some of you on campus or in town!\n\nLisa (Byun) Forman\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI spent the year after graduation teaching K–9 general music, music history, and strings classes at an international school in Jakarta, Indonesia. I did some travelling in SE Asia after the school year ended and then moved to a beach on the North Carolina coast, where I somehow became an extra for the \"hit\" television series Dawson's Creek. I am now planning on moving to D.C., where I will do paralegal work at Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll. From my experiences, an American studies degree has been a great starting point to pursue everything from education to law. The research and analytical skills we meticulously sharpened in Senior Seminar have come in handy in the least likely of places and have given me the credibility and background necessary to impress potential employers and other bigwigs.\n\nAbby (Swormstedt) Gegeckas\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nIt's spring 2005 and I am back in New Orleans, teaching second grade in the public schools. I moved back here in the summer of 2004, after getting a master's in education at Harvard University. I'm now working on a second masters' at Xavier University, and contemplating my next career move! My other news is that I am now Abby Gegeckas. I got married in October 2004. My husband Vytas is a chef and runs a restaurant here in the French Quarter. We would love to see any Skiddies venturing down to the Big Easy! Hope everyone in the American Studies Department is doing well—and congrats to Professor Zangrando on her retirement. I know she will be missed!\n\nBryn Varley Hollenbeck\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI'm currently a doctoral candidate in the History of American Civilization Program at the University of Delaware. Most of my days are spent working on my dissertation, The Material Culture of Childhood, 1900–1965. The research process is a lot of fun, especially when I spend time in Princeton University's Cotsen Collection (an incredible collection of children's literature) or at Winterthur Museum and Library (where I am a McNeil Dissertation Fellow). Periodically, I take a break from full-time dissertating in order to teach a class for UD; I've really enjoyed teaching in both history and art history. My undergraduate training in American studies hugely impacts how I approach both my own research and my teaching experiences. My American studies background broadens and directs my dissertation's source base and the questions I ask of the past. Skidmore's American Studies Department also held high standards in analytical thinking and writing, and this training continues to affect my own work and the work I assign to students.\n\nAllison Kupfer\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI work at a public policy consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., on studies of federal education programs, mostly in early literacy. I've met tons of great people young and old, and seen many hidden corners of our country in the process. I've gotten everything I need to know on the job or in grad school, so if I had it to do over again, I'd still take all those American studies classes because they were just so much fun.\n\nShirley Morgan\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI graduated from the UWW program, live in Saranac Lake, N.Y., and am enrolled in the MALS program at Skidmore. Joanna Zangrando has been my advisor for both programs. The focus of my graduate work is women's history and material culture, specifically textiles. I also do freelance research and writing on local history and am part of a research team preparing for a traveling exhibit on mid-nineteenth century black settlement in the Adirondacks titled, \"Dreaming of Timbuctoo,\" opening this summer at the Adirondack Museum, sponsored by JohnBrownLives! I hope to continue with research projects and work in a museum.\n\nRovin Recio\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nAfter graduation from Skidmore College in 2000, I went into the teaching field through the New York City Teaching Fellows. Last year I got my master's in elementary education and presently I teach Pre-K in Brooklyn, N.Y. I married Martha Solis in April 2004. We both received our master's in elementary education from Hunter College in May of 2002. We have a son named Lucas who is now 2 years old. I would like to say thank you to Prof. Pfitzer and Prof. Lynn.\n\nMarni Richman\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI am finishing my second year of law school at the University of Pittsbugh School of Law. I will be spending the upcoming summer at a firm in Chicago.\n\nLaura Russak\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI just moved outside of Boston and I am currently living in Watertown, Mass., with my cat Rascal (also a Skidmore alum). I received my master's as a reading specialist from Boston University and I have been teaching eighth-grade reading in Waltham, Mass., for the last six years. To this day, I still discuss with my students the unique experiences I had as an American studies major and the impact that had upon my understanding of our country and myself.\n\nDavid Dratch\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nAfter Skidmore I moved to Boston and am currently in my second year at Suffolk University Law School. Although not as interesting as the 1950s class, I am getting by in my studies. Give me another year and I'll let you know how my American studies degree has changed my work life. Although I haven't given any great info about how American studies has helped me in law school, I think it was an incredible major in college and wish I could still be taking some of those classes now.\n\nKristin Finnerty\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI am currently teaching first grade in Great Barrington, Mass., and working on my master's degree in reading at SUNY Albany. Since the children in my classroom are so young I cannot say that I directly use my American studies degree. However, it has been useful to know about the culture of our country when we are studying various holidays and events in our history. I also have found that the American Studies Department helped me to develop my writing skills, which I need to use on a regular basis!\n\nRich Greeney\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI am currently teaching high school social studies at Cold Spring Harbor High School. I also coach junior high school basketball and varsity basketball.\n\nMargaret Sills Huckel\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI currently work at the Saratoga Springs Public Library as technical services principal clerk. I supervise four other clerks; we accession 20,000 new items a year. In addition I work seven hours a week as a senior clerk in the Children's Department. I continue to use my American studies education and training in my family history research, which is a great pleasure to myself and my family members. I believe American studies is one of the best backgrounds to have for library work, both in reference and iin acquisitions. This year (2007) after years of avid following from the public side, I joined the 18th century reenacting hobby. I belong to the 1st New York McCracken's Company, which participates in French and Indian War, Revolutionary War, and the occasional War of 1812 events. I started as a female camp follower but because one of our company, an underwater archaeologist has built an 18th century boat, I have become a sailor as well. We do events on Lake Champlain and Lake George, as well as the Hudson River and the St. Lawrence Seaway. Of course my American studies background is what gives me the depth of knowledge and understanding to enjoy and contribute to these events, as well as the awareness of what I still don't know. The biggest lesson was this: You are never done learning, and Skidmore gave me the tools I need to keep researching and striving to learn more all the time.\n\nLaurence Jackson\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI am living in Astoria, Queens, a section of New York City. Officially my address is Astoria, N.Y., but it would be equally accurate to just say New York City. I have not received any further education since Skidmore, but I do plan to enroll in a graduate program in September. My preference right now is the liberal studies program at The New School. This is not official, though. Currently I am an editor and writer for MAMM Magazine, the only consumer magazine for women with cancer. Our readership is approximately 100,000. We address various issues concerning breast and reproductive cancer, including scientific developments, women's advocacy, federal funding for cancer research and the socioeconomic inequalities associated with cancer risk and treatment. My American studies degree has been of use in several ways. First, I use the research and writing skills that I developed at Skidmore on a regular basis. In addition, my understanding of American politics and social realities helps in my understanding of the political and social issues surrounding cancer treatment. Finally, a liberal arts education aids students in learning, thinking, and presenting arguments. The broad, interdisciplinary approach to education that American studies entails is useful for virtually any career choice.\n\nJennifer Joseph\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nAfter my move to Boston in the fall of '99, I began working at Bain and Co., a worldwide strategy consulting firm whose clients range from the consumer goods industry, to health care, to IT, and everything in between. I was at Bain for almost 2 1/2 years but left to work for the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce as a program manager. My responsibilities include event planning and marketing for a variety of programs. I am especially excited for this new career move because it not only incorporates my interest in marketing, but also allows me to be in an environment where government and policy play an integral role in the organization.\n\nAdam Kirkman\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nAfter taking a year off to enjoy life in Saratoga I decided to go back to school. As my ties to the area prohibited me from going too far away, I applied to and was accepted at the Rockefeller School of Public Affairs and Policy at SUNY Albany. I am now finishing up my second semester (our of four) and am currently looking for a summer internship. My concentration in the Masters of Public Policy Program is substance abuse policy, and I have recently completed papers analyzing the development of methadone maintenance programs in New York State and the implementation of needle exchange in New Haven, Conn. Anyone who has an interest in graduate work in public policy can feel free to email me, and I would be happy to tell you all about it.\n\nKrista Senator\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nAfter graduating from Skidmore, I moved to NYC and found work in an art gallery on the Upper East Side. While my time at the gallery has certainly been enjoyable, I have decided to leave the art world and to begin a career in education. I have been accepted into a teaching program here called the New York Teaching Fellows. Chancellor Levy started the program this summer in response to the city's dire need for teachers. The program lasts two years, during which time I will be teaching full-time and taking graduate courses. I am not sure which grade I will be teaching (I am hoping for fifth or sixth), and I will probably be at a school located in upper Manhattan or in the south Bronx. So I am taking a deep breath and trying to prepare myself for this change... I will be moving from working in the wealthiest neighborhood in New York to one of the most impoverished, and I will be answering to \"Miss Senator\"—one friend commented that the title screams authority. Let's hope she's right! I have wanted to make this career change for some time. I had initially planned to go back to school for history but when this program presented itself, I decided to take it.\n\nLina Senzer\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nSince September 1999 I have been living in Moab, Utah. I work for a company called Alternative Youth Adventures (AYA). They specialize in wilderness therapy for adjudicated youth coming from Colorado and Utah. These darling young angels come to our program with all kinds of legal charges and emotional issues. Our job is to teach them better coping skills and help them to strengthen thier self-esteem so that when they return to the community they are ready to take on more positive leadership roles and accept responsibility for thier life choices. My position focuses on spending time out in the field with a team of ten or eleven kids and then communicating with thier families and parole officers on thier progress. I also help to identify what the adolescent's needs are and to plan their aftercare for when they leave the program. The kids are awesome and I find the work really challenging and rewarding. I guess the conections between wilderness therapy and American studies focus mainly on the theoretical idea of \"making connections\" and being able to see the big picture. Each day, I am challenged to see an issue from a different perspective. My success in this line of work depends on my ability to think on different levels and be creative. These concepts were pretty central to my experience with American studies at Skidmore. In practice, I often draw resources for my kids from many different places to try and give them a bigger picture of how to problem-solve. I often bring in many stories, poems, pictures, and song lyrics and utilize these items to illustrate different aspects of our lives. I guess I continue to favor a multidiscplinary approach when I teach hard and soft skills to these kids. I have also learned a great deal about the southwest land and culture that I pass on to my kids. The rich history of native peoples is really fascinating to me. I am now in the process of moving to Colorado to begin working for the new AYA branch that will be based in western Colorado. My dog, Nisa, and I will probably be living in Ouray or Gunnison, Colo., as of next month. I look forward to lots of great skiing and paddling there!\n\nWendy Singer\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nCurrently I live in NYC. I am a second year student at Benjamin N. Cordozo School of Law. The American studies major gave me the necessary analytical, research, and writing skills that are so crucial in developing persuasive legal arguments.\n\nMarc Tagliento\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI moved to Washington, D.C., in 1998 to pursue a M.A. in political science from American University. After graduation I accepted a management position with the Direct Impact Co. There I worked on a variety of \"hot-button\" reform initiatives relating to the Medicare entitlement program and managed health care systems. After September 11, 2001 however, I pursued opportunities to shape emergency management and incident response policies and practices. As a program manager with L-3 Titan Corp., I assisted Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) with its development of a National Emergency Responder Credentialing System to document minimum professional qualifications, certifications, training, and education requirements for select emergency response and incident response personnel. In 2006 I joined FEMA's Incident Mangement System Division as a National Incident Management System (NIMS) and National Response Framework (NRF) program specialist.\n\nTim Whiteman\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI am currently an account executive with a sports marketing firm named Octagon Marketing. We are the third-largest firm worldwide, and we do pretty good for ourselves. I've been with the company since late March of this year, and it has been nothing but wonderful since. I am primarily in the event-marketing division, organizing and coordinating golf, tennis, and ski challenges all over the country, so I get to travel a great deal. The main office is in Stamford, Conn., but I commute from my hometown of Brooklyn every day. Needless to say the car is earning its keep. Life is good. I still see some Skiddies around here and there, but not too often. The real world is kind of bigger than Scribner Village, I hate to admit.\n\nJackie Abodeely\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI received my master's in archaeological heritage management from Boston University in May 2000. From September 1999 to August 2000 I worked for the Mohawk Valley Heritage Corridor Commission in Canajoharie to author a guidebook to the Iroquois landscape in the Mohawk Valley in the 17th century. I often utilized the skills I learned in American studies with this organization. I then worked as a project director for a contract archaeologist in Saratoga Springs. I graduated the New York State Park Police Academy on June 20, 2003, and I am currently a park patrol officer stationed in the New York City region at Riverbank State park in Manhattan. In the end, I wish that every student could have the opportunity to take classes in American studies. It is not just something you learn in the classroom. The issues are very real in everyday life and have lasting impacts on the way we see our world as it changes so rapidly.\n\nJane Shannon Barnes\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI am currently living in Delmar, N.Y., which is a suburb of Albany. After graduating from Skidmore with a double major in government and American studies, I moved to Washington, D.C., where I was a paralegal at a large intellectual property law firm. Initially my plan was to gain experience in both the legal and historical fields and then either attend law school or obtain my master's in museum studies. Law prevailed, and I graduated from Albany Law School in 2001. I currently practice family and matrimonial law in a small law office. However, my long-term goal is to enter the field of public interest law, where I feel that I can better serve society. I am forever grateful for my liberal arts education. My experience with the American Studies Department provided me with not only the facts of our past, but also the emotions. As high school students we were taught the names of battles and generals. We memorized portions of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. As American studies students, we were taught about nameless women and their struggles on the prairie. We read biographies of slaves. One cannot try to make this world a better place without knowing its intricate history and the effect it had on our society.\n\nRegan Eysman Franklin\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI have decided to become a history teacher for grades 6–12. I am entering a program at George Mason called \"Career Switcher.\" It is a program that allows individuals who have been working for a while to become teachers more quickly than if they were to quit their jobs and go back to school full-time. The obvious advantage being that you can still work while getting certified! I cannot wait to get into a classroom! I have spent the last year teaching second graders at Sunday school at my temple in Alexandria, Va., and I absolutely love it. [It should also be noted that Regan was married about 2.5 years ago!]\n\nCarrie Gates\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nAfter graduating in 1997, I taught fourth grade for a year prior to attending Boston College to earn my M.Ed. in literacy and reading in education. I currently reside in Boston with fellow American studies alum, Melissa Pollock. I teach sixth grade in the Weymouth public schools. I feel as though my American studies major was a valuable part of my education. Being a teacher I am constantly discussing current events in the classroom. I am able to draw upon historical facts and events which I have learned to supplement the conversation. In addition, when teaching \"social science,\" I have often referred back to notes taken from Professor Pfitzer's class to remember specific dates and add tantilizing stories which intrigue the students.\n\nKristin Harrison\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI will graduate from Brooklyn Law School in 2003. Before going to law school, I worked for a year at a law firm and for two years in a Congressional Office doing constituent service. I draw from what I learned in American Studies almost every day. I think an integral aspect of a liberal arts education is learning about the history of your country from the perspective of all the groups who experienced it. As a law student I am constantly reminded how important it was to be a well-rounded student before focusing on one area of study. With its multidisciplinary approach, American studies was perfect because it encompassed all areas of study.\n\nChad Kasdin\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nCurrently I live in Chicago and work for a 200-lawyer law firm called Hinshaw & Culbertson. After graduating from Skidmore I went directly to law school at Washington University in Saint Louis, where I graduated last May with the class of 2000. I recently passed the Illinois bar exam and I am waiting to be sworn in and receive my license to practice, which will both occur on this Thursday, November 9. As an attorney for Hinshaw & Culbertson, I work mainly as a litigator, meaning that I try cases in front of a jury. I work in the Professional Liability Group of the firm representing professionals such as doctors, lawyers, accountants, etc., when they get sued for malpractice. My American studies background plays an important role in my job as a trial lawyer. For example, the most important part of a trial is picking the jurors who will decide the outcome of a case. In selecting jurors, the first and sometimes most important factor to consider is a juror's race, class, gender, and ethnicity. Understanding the different cultural perspectives of different groups of people and how they feel toward certain issues and topics gives me an advantage that other attorneys might not have. Some groups/cultures might not be able to be fair or impartial towards other groups/cultures, whether it be a conscious decision or not. Based on my American studies background I find it easier to determine which potential jurors have the subconscious potential to be unfair or partial in a particular case and excuse them from the jury panel.\n\nMindy Hapeman Rose\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI have worked in several capacities since leaving Skidmore. I went first to NYC, where I worked at both the Ellis Island Immigration Museum and the Museum of Television and Radio. My arrangement with Ellis Island was actually an oral history internship through which I finished up credits for Skidmore. It was a fabulous experience. My time at the Museum of Television and Radio was spent coordinating a series of educational seminars featuring television- and radio-related topics. In the fall of 1998, I entered the M.A./Ph.D. program in American studies at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va. I completed all my M.A. coursework and then opted to take a leave of absence from the program for medical reasons (its always something with me). In July I began my current job as an admission counselor at the University of Richmond. Here, I am working with prospective students who are interested in entering our heavily writing-intensive and liberal arts-minded undergraduate curriculum. I have always been ardent about how my experience with the American studies program at Skidmore—with the curriculum, with the faculty, and with the classes—has profoundly affected my life. Discovering a passion for examining American culture across disciplines led to an enhanced self-confidence and broadened world view, and thus my time within Skidmore's American studies program is truly at the root of my identity. Greg Pfitzer, Joanna Zangrando, Mary Lynn, and Wilma Hall always seemed to understand how formative those years were to me, and their influence on me was profound. I am indebted to them for the way in which they challenged, supported, and nurtured me.\n\nElizabeth \"Betsy\" Rowland\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nMajor: double American studies and elementary education. Right now I am living in Brookline, Mass., but working in Ashland, Mass. I received my master's in education at Boston College this past spring. Currently I am teaching social studies to sixth-graders in Ashland. The curriculum is U.S. history, beginning with the Revolutionary War, which is wonderful! I rely on my background as an American studies major all the time. I refer back to my notes, books, and handouts from all my classes, especially Greg Pfitzer's. It has been a tremendous experience thus far, and I thank the department!\n\nMarcie Simon\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI received an M.A. in American history and an M.Ed. in secondary curriculum and instruction. Currently I live in Boston and teach history (world and U.S.) at Brookline High School in Massachusetts. I think it's obvious how my major affects my work every day!\n\nMelissa Pollock\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI live in Boston and received my M.Ed. from Boston College in 2000. I am currently a fifth-grade teacher in Weymouth, Mass.\n\nJody Westwood\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nIn Munich I work at a school, Wall Street Institute, that does English as a foreign language training for adults all around the world. We have a franchise system of over 400 schools in 20 countries. We're part of Sylvan Learning Systems, which you may have heard of. I started out there as a teacher, as I had worked previously for a couple years as an English teacher in another city in Germany (Halle) to which I initially moved after graduating. What I do now is much more concerned with acquiring new students and supporting existing students in their studies. I'm not using my American studies background at work per se, except for the fact that I am simply a more well-rounded, perceptive, critical, and learned person because of it. It's often interesting to be able to explain more of the culture, history, politics, and psyche of Americans to my students who are curious or who criticize. I'm definitely glad I followed a liberal arts course of studies, and more specifically that I was a major at the Skidmore American Studies Department. It's something most college students in Germany don't enjoy.\n\nKaren Northrop Barzilay\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nAfter I graduated from Skidmore, I began the M.A./Ph.D track in American studies at the College of William and Mary. I earned my master's degree, completed my coursework and comprehensive exams for my doctorate, and am now working on my dissertation. At William and Mary, I had the opportunity to direct a summer program for students from Keio University in Japan. I helped design the curriculum for this program, and found my American studies background extremely useful in planning themes, lectures, and fieldwork. Now I live in Cambridge, Mass. I have done some teaching at a local community college, but spend most of my time on my dissertation project. When I finally finish, I hope to be a full-time professor. I found graduate school in American studies to be quite different from my coursework at Skidmore, though I enjoyed both. I am grateful to my professors at Skidmore for helping me develop the analytical and writing skills that I use every day and for introducing me to the study of the American past—a subject that has become such an important part of my life and the way I understand the world.\n\nMarcy Bouley\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI have lived in Boston since graduation. I am the manager of operations and planning for a small, nonprofit neighborhood development group, the Downtown Crossing Association. I work on events planning and membership development and also manage a pushcart vendor program. Prior to my work at the DCA, I worked at the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office. My American studies education at Skidmore has helped me invaluably along the way. Because of the multidisciplinary nature of an American studies degree, I was exposed to a broad scope of knowledge. I have since re-read many of the books I was first introduced to through the major. I appreciate the emphasis on American culture rather than historical facts, and I hope that my outlook on today's society is greater because of this.\n\nJennifer Cecatiello\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI received my master's in education (English) from the University at Albany in '98. I currently work for TOH Managed Staffing in Albany, N.Y., as the account manager. We work to support large companies in thier staffing needs. Being an American studies major gave me a broader perspective on how the country works: We're not a \"dollars and cents, who did what\" society. It gave me the insight to look beyond the \"facts\" and into reality.\n\nLeslie Cypen\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nAfter school I did a year graduate program in photography at the International Center of Photography in NYC. Than I moved back to Miami to figure things out and to live my boyfriend from forever who was in law school in Miami. I did some freelance photojournalism and assisting and then took a job at the University of Miami. I became their lab supervisor and department manager for the Photojournalism Department in their School of Communication. It was great because I got to teach, have lab access, and work side by side with my photography mentor of five years. While I was there, I received a BA in none other than ... liberal studies! It was awesome and interesting, very similar to my American studies education. After my graduate work was completed I left the office 9-to-5–like job and started to do wardrobe and prop styling for photography shoots mad commercials. And here we are. I have been styling for about two years now and I love it. I live in Miami Beach with my boyfriend and everything is great.\n\nCarrie Durant\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nAfter graduating from Skidmore in 1996 I went to St. John's University School of Law and graduated with a law degree in 1999. I spent the following six years practicing law in the real estate departments of Clifford Chance US LLP and Bryan Cave LLP. Currently I worked in the securitized products group, in the fixed income division of Morgan Stanley.\n\nKevin Grinwis\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nMy initial path after graduation led me to Seattle, where I worked for several years in business development and acquisition integration for an automotive software firm. Although not directly related to American studies, I found the major’s methodology of looking at culture and experiences through multiple perspectives to be very useful in my role of analyzing the corporate cultures of the companies we acquired and for recommending how to best work together. I returned to grad school to get a MBA in 2004 and reposition myself for a career in real estate, which has allowed me to combine my business experience and education with passions studied in American studies; the American-built environment and landscape. I now work on the portfolio management team of a multifamily real estate investment trust (REIT), where I am responsible for analyzing financial performance of the Florida portfolio and identifying demographic, economic, and land-use trends that influence buying, selling and development decisions.\n\nWilliam J. Kambas\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI have covered a lot of ground since graduating in 1996. I would love to tell you about all of my adventures since then, but suffice to say, I went from ceramics to law school (graduating with a J.D. and M.B.A.) and am now a lawyer and tax consultant with Ernst & Young. However, it feels like things have come full circle. Just like in American studies at Skidmore, I find myself enjoying the demands of research and writing. In fact, I am just beginning an article analyzing Internal Revenue Service practices and the protection of taxpayer privacy (if all goes well, this will be my third scholarly publication and fourth overall publication). I credit my senior honors thesis for opening my eyes to the joy of scholarly writing. Although I am enjoying life as a professional, research, writing, and general academic dialogue is the most rewarding part of my life.\n\nTami Safer\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI work from home for my father's textile company while I raise my 6-month-old son. Since graduating in 1996 I have worked in textiles, selling fabric (which has nothing to do with what I studied at Skidmore). I value the education I received, in particular all that I learned from my American studies courses. However, nothing I learned prepared me for a career in textiles, being married, or having a baby.\n\nBen Soreff\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI have been living in NYC for the past year and a half working In television production. Currently I work at True Entertainment making shows for the Learning Channel. I spent most of 2000 working on a documentary for PBS's Frontline called \"The Merchants of Cool\" about giant media corporations and their efforts to market solely to teenagers. Before New York, I was in Boston working at WGBH, the largest PBS production facility in the world. So when you talk American studies and how it was helpful, I would say that in everything I have done it has been helpful, from shows like Frontline, Nova, and The American Experience, to my current project a documentary on the World Trade Center and September 11, 2001.\n\nSarah Wight\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI am currently the promotions director for WROR 105.7 Greatest Hits of the '60s and '70s in Boston! I actually married Skidmore Alum Brian O'Connell ('95) on July 8, 2001, and had a couple Skidmore students helping out at the reception. When I graduated from Skidmore I came to Boston and began as an intern at WRKO, AM 680, a talk station, and worked there for two and a half years as the promotions coordinator. How does this relate to my major at Skidmore? I went out to reach the people during election time (gettting their perspectives, putting them on the air) and watched the reaction to the community during the Louise Woodward case. After Talk, I went to work for a Classic Rock station, learning about musicians and social influences that we learned in American studies classes. I helped coordinate interviews with musicians as well as created events for the station. Two years ago I started as the promotions director of WROR. Just this past month we celebrated our morning show's twentieth anniversary, which is a big feat in radio. Part of the celebration included an on-air interview and concert with Ringo Starr. I remember one of the assignments during one of my last American studies classes was to pick an influential 1960s song and introduce it and play it over the air. I chose Beatles, \"Revolution\"! How weird it is to think that I was so nervous that night about going on the radio and reading my paragraph out loud—now I can record commercials with ease! One can tell a lot about a culture through music—I know a ton about our listeners, fans of '60s and '70s music—people who went through some of the stuff I learned in my American studies classes.\n\nChristopher Wollen\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI live and work in Manhattan for Grey worldwide advertising agency. I am an account executive on Procter & Gamble. I have had no further formal education since graduation. As an advertising account executive I am a marketing partner to the client (Procter & Gamble) and a manager of the creative process to develop advertising. Two main things have come from my American studies major that I find very valuable in my career. One, having an understanding of our country's cultural history and the events that have shaped the American populous gives me strong insight into the consumer culture and why we are the way we are. Two, by looking at our history through first-party documentation (not through history textbooks), then developing our own opinions of those events and the effects they have had, one learns to be strong conceptual thinker and develop their own analytical process which they can then hopefully communicate to others through a paper, a presentation, or in my case now an advertisement. The benefits of my American studies degree in the business world are not external but internal, which in the end are much more valuable.\n\nRebecca Brynteson Conner\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI recently transferred from managing the records management program at the regional office of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to EPA headquarters. My contract assists in records management for the entire agency, and I spend part of my month in Washington, D.C., and part of it telecommuting from my home office in Atlanta, Ga. (or travelling to other offices around the country). I even was handling some history questions for a time, linking directly back to my American studies major!\n\nAdam Fein\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI live in Boston with my wife, Toni, who graduated from Skidmore in 1996. I received a master's in library and information science from Simmons College in August of 1999. I am now working for Bain Capital in Boston as a research librarian. The work is largely the same as my last job at KPMG. I was laid off from that job last summer/fall which was definitely a bummer, but I am happy here and feel lucky that I was able to find a new gig. And in some respects, the work is a little more challenging. People ask us to find some pretty obscure information about very small niche industries and companies. So my American studies degree is still quite a valuable asset that helps me tackle these questions. It's the ability to think critically and to solve problems that comes in handy the most. My degree in American studies gave me a solid foundation of general knowledge about the culture that we live in. Most importantly though, it taught me how to learn. I think this is because of the interdisciplinary nature of American Studies (and the great faculty). In our American studies classes we explored a variety of subjects related to American culture and this taught me that there are always many perspectives from which to view any topic. This, in turn, taught me to always ask questions about any given topic, which is how you learn.\n\nHeather Pace Lewis\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI left teaching almost 1.5 years ago to be a full-time stay at home mom to Emma, born 11/8/00. I was teaching third grade in Mansfield, Mass. I integrated my American studies degree while preparing and teaching social studies units. I tried to bring the lives of early colonists and the time period alive for my students—the only way to keep the attention of 8- and 9-year-olds! Rather than \"telling\" students about the history, I encouraged them to explore and investigate for themselves. This reminds me of Professor Pfitzer handing out the packets of documents, photographs, etc., and challenging us to \"find out\" the history. One year I dressed up as a different Rhode Island colonist each day. The kids had to ask questions to determine who I was—tons of fun and great pictures!\n\nHeidi Reich\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI currently work at Wieden & Kennedy advertising in NYC. I am the receptionist. Being an American studies major helped sharpen my critical thinking skills—to look at all perspectives and the context from which those perspectives stem.\n\nBlaine VanRy\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI'm living in Piffard, N.Y. (near Rochester). I received my M.A. from Bowling Green State University in 1996 and my New York State teaching certification from the University of Rochester in 1999. I am in my second year as a seventh-grade social studies teacher at Honeoye Falls-Lima Middle School. I teach five classes (about 120 students) American history up to the Civil War. I am also co-advisor of the student council and girls varsity tennis coach in the fall. Of course my degree in American studies comes into play every minute of every day in my work. My education at Skidmore advanced my interest in our nation's past. The information and training I received in the American Studies Department has allowed me to offer my students an interdisciplinary look at American life and culture. I don't have to simply provide the traditional, bulimic learning of American history by feeding my students facts and dates, and asking them to regurgitate them back. History is not just learning about old, dead guys.\n\nJohn Anning\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI am living in Cincinnati, Ohio, and work with Merrill Lynch. As a financial consultant I develop financial plans for individuals and families. American studies has helped make me a more well rounded person, which is important when trying to establish and strengthen long-term relationships with people. There is a need to be able to relate to people in ways other than finance, and American studies gives you the necessary background and knowledge to do that.\n\nAndre Cook\n\nFavorite AM class:\n\nProfessor Pfitzer's 101 class\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI graduated from Skidmore in 1994. I spent two years working on my M.A.T. from Union College. In the summer of 1996 I took a job at Hudson Falls High School as a social studies teacher and varsity basketball coach. I can remember coming to Skidmore in the fall of 1990 and not having a clue of what I wanted to do. By chance I was enrolled in Professor Pfitzer's 101 class. He turned me on to history like none other. I continued to take classes with him and Mary Lynn and others and I found a love for history. Their passion for history helped me formulate ideas for what I wanted to do with my life.\n\nMichael Ellis\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI graduated in 1994 after a terrific experience as an American studies major. I still think fondly of Professors Hall, Lynn, Pfitzer, and Zangrando, and have many of their pearls of wisdom stored in my head. My life has been profoundly shaped by what I learned in the American studies course work, not only as a professional but in regard to how I live every day and how I see myself as a member of this incredibly complex society. I went on from Skidmore to Smith College School for Social Work, where I received my master's in clinical social work, specializing in work with children and families. I am presently working as a child and family therapist at a large nonprofit agency in urban Hartford, Conn., called The Village for Families and Children. I am also a consultant to Head Start centers in the greater Hartford area as well as co-chair of the Diversity Steering Committee here at The Village. In order for me to do my various jobs well, I need to be able to think systemically about how people are affected by laws, poverty, discrimination, culture/ethnicity, religion, politics, media, popular culture, etc. I feel that my idealism and my desire to serve people were nurtured and strengthened by the readings, lectures, and discussions that took place over the four years that I spent at Skidmore in the American Studies Department.\n\nJulie Gibbons-Keblinsky\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI received a M.A. in teaching from Tufts University in 1995 and I currently teach 9th- to 12th-grade history at Medomak Valley High School in Maine. My American studies degree has enhanced my teaching. By examining history through various disciplines (literature, art, social history, etc.), I am better able to engage my students and bring history to life.\n\nSeth Goddard\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nIt would be a stretch to say that my degree is of much use in my current job, senior interface designer at BlueLight.com. Insomuch as American studies helped me to see the interconnectedness of facts and trends, sure, it's helping me—but, really, any good liberal arts education should do as much. I am living back in my hometown of San Francisco after spending five years in New York City. The two towns, as would happen, were also home to my senior thesis subject, The Frontier Dichotomy, Circa 1939 (The 1939 World Fairs of San Francisco and New York, \"The Pageant of the Pacific\" and \"The World of Tomorrow). In New York, 1994–1999, it's safe to say that I made use of my degree every day as a print and then web journalist for People, Life, and Time magazines. Some of my favorite projects were Company Town: Norilsk Russia (hello machine in the garden); The Time 100 (most important people over the past 100 years); Top 100 Events of the Millennium; Missions to the Moon (the frontier attitude); Time 75 (focused around Time covers); A Giant Leap for Mankind (ditto); Joe DiMaggio, 1914–1999; Black in America (disregard the errors at the bottom of the page, nobody's maintaining my old site—Life went out of business last year); Diana, Princess of Wales, 1961–1997; The Baby Boom Turns 50 (look for interviews with John Lewis and Allen Ginsberg); Pictures of the Year, 1998; Pictures of the Year, 1997. Today it's safe to say my degree comes in handy every time I pay even the slightest attention to current local, national and international events, which really is every day. Many thanks to the professors who helped me make sense of all that I see through my open eyes.\n\nAlex Goldberg\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI currently reside in NYC. I am currently attempting to be self-employed as a filmmaker/actor/writer/director. I recently completed the shooting of my directorial feature film debut and am starting the post-production process. An American studies degree is necessary in interpreting events in our country, obviously the major political and cultural events. However, I am more concerned with the interpretation of daily life, for the stories to tell often aren't paraded around on television. They have to be found. An American studies degree taught me how to look between the lines.\n\nMelissa Raff Goldberg\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI was a double major with American studies and elementary education. I taught first grade for six years, and now I am a stay-at-home mom with my 7-month-old daughter. I completed several internships in museums while I was in college. I worked at the National Air and Space Museum and the National Racing Museum. Integrating my American studies major with museums is an exciting opportunity. When I return to work, I hope to pursue that avenue.\n\nJennifer Lanfranco\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nAfter working for one year, I went to law school and graduated in 1998 from Northwestern School of Law at Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Ore. I have been practicing as an attorney for over two years in Portland at Busse & Hunt. I practice plaintiffs' employment law, which means I represent employees in disputes with their employers. This includes civil rights actions, various types of employment discrimination, contract actions, and defamation. I really enjoy my work, and I know that majoring in American studies provided a wonderful background for law school. Understanding our country's history and culture made it easier to understand the legal system. For instance, I am able to have a better understanding of certain statutes by understanding the time period in which they were enacted. The interdisciplinary nature of the major enabled me to learn about many different subject areas, which is very helpful to me as an attorney. Practicing law requires not only knowledge of the law, but also an understanding of effective writing, psychology, and many other areas.\n\nFrazier Rugg\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI have not pursued a higher degree, but I have taken plenty of classes in a variety of things. I live in NYC and work in advertising sales for the Atlantic monthly. I work as a liason between the agencies and their clients. I help them to understand the benefits of using the Atlantic as an advertising vehicle. American studies taught me to research, think critically and creatively about issues, and to back up my thoughts/arguments with facts. Working for a magazine rich in American literature, history, politics and policy, I feel my liberal arts degree has provided me with a variety of ways to connect with my clients and with the magazine itself.\n\nDaniel Schwenk\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nMy life has been a bit of a whirlwind since Skidmore, and my American studies degree has been helpful in both direct and indirect ways. After I got back from China, I lived in New Hampshire for a year, then Colorado for two years. In the summer of 1998, I moved to West Hartford, Conn., with Sophie Markovic '96 so she could attend UConn dental school. We married in the summer of '99 and had a baby boy (Benjamin John Daniel Schwenk). In February of this year. I was going for my master's in colonial American history at UConn, but left to work and take care of my family while Sophie finishes school. I started working for Wild Oats, a chain of natural and organic supermarkets. I do marketing for them and I cover twenty stores across ten states. I do advertising, community relations, promotions, and special events for the twenty stores. It's a fun job, but very tiring and very stressful. American studies has definitely helped me in my work. I am able to understand different areas around the country in terms of shopping trends, values, perspective, etc. This is valuable for me because often I need to understand different areas of my region as a separate entity in order to develop marketing plans for them. My degree has also enriched my life because I have never put my interests in American culture and literature aside. I still read the same type of books and still watch the same types of documentaries. It has also helped develop my communication skills, which is very valuable when you need to email and cell phone so many people on a day-to-day basis.\n\nChristine (Vigliotti) Bonavita\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nAfter Skidmore I went to Villanova University School of Law and graduated in 1996. I clerked for a judge in Ocean County, N.J., after I graduated, and am currently working in Philadelphia. I work at Blank Rome Comisky and McCauley, where I practice labor and employment law. I am recently married and living in Philadephia.\n\nShaun O'Connell\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI received my J.D. in 1996 from Case Western Reserve University School of Law. I'm an attorney working for General Dynamics. My primary responsibility is the negotiation of contracts with the U.S. government as well as with foreign governments and commercial corporations around the world. My job calls for discussion, interpretation, and compromise while interacting with a wide variety of people from different backgrounds. Having majored in American studies allows me to better understand where the viewpoints, predispositions, and beliefs of other people stem from, as well as allowing insight into how others may perceive my own actions.\n\nPeter Steedman\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI live in Kingston, Mass., and received an M.A.T. in history at Teachers College-Columbia University (1995) and C.A.G.S administration at Boston University (2001) I spent the last five years teaching at the American School of The Hague. Last year I was the chair of the English and history departments and the dean of students. I am currently an administrative intern at Norwell Public High School. This includes acting as chair of the English, physical education, and technology departments. If all goes according to plan, I hope to be a principal in a few years. My wife is also a teacher in the disctrict. My American studies degree comes into play every day. I emulate the wonderful teachers I had at Skidmore. Unfortunately, I will never be able to attain the high standard they set. I encourage all Skiddies to explore teaching. It is a wonderful life!\n\nWhitney Savage Tosh\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nAmerican studies has followed me in virtually every part of my life since leaving Skidmore. Upon graduation, I moved to LA and worked for a startup company to produce a multicultural sitcom for the Fox network. I worked with a diverse group of people and was able to harness my understanding of cultural differences and perspectives while on the job. I then worked for Castle Rock Entertainment before moving back East. Little did I know I would be reading City of Quartz when I took some American studies courses at the University of Maryland a couple of years later. Although accepted into the University of Maryland, I decided not to pursue a master's while there and moved back to NYC. I worked in public relations for a couple of years and then worked for NBC, Lifetime Television, and Primedia. It was at Primedia that I discovered event planning. I have been an event planner since 2000, having worked for Gartner in Stamford, Conn., and now at Wings Unlimited in Darien, Conn. Event planning seemed a natural fit because of the interaction with people from all different backgrounds, domestic and international travel, and the research and attention to detail that planning requires. I use my American studies degree every day in this capacity—particularly when trying to understand the needs of each client. I married in 2006 and my husband, Stewart, and I are expecting our first child in July. Life is good and I'm looking forward to the next stage!\n\nWendy VanAntwerp\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI graduated from Skidmore with an American studies degree in 1993. I currently live in Breckenridge, Colo. I moved out here in the winter of 1993 and have not left. I spent quite a few years exploring my ski bum side! I now work for the Summit County Department of Human Services. I am the intake caseworker. My job requires me to interview children and their families surrounding abuse, neglect, and welfare issues. My degree from Skidmore enables me to accept people within the context of their own history and circumstances. I must admit that my investigative skills are straight from the teachings of Mary Lynn! Please encourage other grads to contact me at this e-mail address.\n\nTerri Cook-Melloy\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI currently live in Minneapolis with my husband, Evan, and my kids, Wyatt and Marin (3 1/2-year-old twins). I work for Philips Lighting Co., selling industrial/commercial lighting in Minnesota. Life is busy, full, and fun. American studies was the perfect major for me, as I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life, and was able to take diverse, interesting courses. I truly enjoyed my courses and professors at Skidmore and I believe it has made me quite well-rounded and open-minded.\n\nMichele Helfgott MD\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI live in Fort Wayne, Ind., with my fiance Rodney and am practicing Ob/Gyn with six other people. I am much happier than I was in Munster, Ind., although that job was a good starting ground. I have passed my boards so I am official. Rodney and I are doing well and hope to be getting married this fall. I miss Skidmore, the people and the teachers very much. I hope to be back this summer for the reunion. In terms of how American studies helped me in my profession, I think it enabled me to be more well-rounded and to appreciate the little things in life like nature, history, culture, reading—things that, as a physician, we often lose sight of or do not have enough time for. I truly do my best to make time for those things; life is too short not to.\n\nJohn Levinson\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI currently live in Atlanta. No further degree beyond American studies. I am a media promotions professional with an international media agency. The degree has helped me become a well-rounded person in ways that have helped me become successful not only in my career but also in my personal life. Life has been good to me, and I owe that in part to my experience at Skidmore, the degree, and the professors who helped me earn it.\n\nMichael Quincy\n\nIn 1986, I started working in money management and economic consulting (which took me as far away as Hong Kong for two months to set up an office to service clients from the Far East). However, I really wanted to get back to working with words, something learned in spades at Skidmore and especially as an American studies major. I got into publishing via a biweekly rag called Tennis Week (I think I made $13k per year). I was associate editor and went to a lot of tennis tournaments. But I longed to write about cars, my first, and still-burning passion. After nearly a year of pounding the pavement and a string of rejections, I finally broke through with Automobile magazine, based in Ann Arbor, Mich. I followed that with a stint as a writer for a public relations agency with several automotive clients, and then went on my own for a while as a freelancer writing for PR and ad agencies. I knew I needed to settle down, however, because I met the woman of my dreams and we planned on getting married and buying a house. I landed with Consumer Reports as an automotive editor and managed to stay for nearly seven and a half years. Last Spring (2000), though, I received an offer too good to pass up from a \"dot-com\" in Austin, Texas; I became the senior editor for carOrder.com and was responsible for all of the content for the web site. The company became a \"dot-gone\" only four months after I joined, but I was quickly hired by the parent company (Trilogy Software) to work in the marketing division for the Trilogy/Ford joint venture. Well, the kiss of death followed me there, too, and the joint venture blew a gasket not three months later! I went back to the freelance world and have been busy ever since. My work at Skidmore and everything I learned from the American Studies and English departments prepared me well to handle the rigors of the working world. I so believe in my Skidmore education that I've volunteered as an alumni admissions correspondent for the last thirteen years or so.\n\nHeather Hartland Steele\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI received a master's in philosophy and international relations from Cambridge University, UK (Pembroke College) in 1989. I worked as a senior project manager at the Washington, D.C., based International Life Sciences Institute, but I am presently a full-time mom to Patrick (age 6), Annabel (4), and Peter (1). Although the American studies degree did not have a direct impact on my future studies or career, it did provide me with excellent research and writing skills and I loved the course offerings, history, literature, art history, American culture, etc. The professors were great, too!\n\nLinda Borish\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI'm living in Kalamazoo, Mich. I have an M.A. and a Ph.D. in American studies from the University of Maryland at College Park. I am an associate professor of history at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, Mich. I use my Amercian studies training in my career here in numerous ways, teaching courses in American history and American studies, and my research and publications focus on American women's sport and health history. I am the president of the Great Lakes American Studies Association and work with the American Studies Association on committees and projects, most recently as co-chair of the Pre-Convention Collaboratives/Local Arrangement Committee for the ASA conference in Detroit in October 2000.\n\nDebora Lee Freedman Clower\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nAmerican studies, Business Minor Bryn Mawr, Pa. I have been a stay-at-home mom for eleven years and am the proud mother of three girls, ages 11, 8, and 4. Prior to motherhood, I worked in advertising, private school administration, marketing for a public television station, and director of special events. My American studies degree allowed me to have many diverse career opportunities, and most importantly enabled me to be open-minded in any endeavors I chose to undertake. My career is solely volunteer at this point, I have served on our children's museum board, and have been active in committee work for various charitable organizations. My involvement with my daughter's schools is very important to me as well. My life feels full at this juncture, but I know my many experiences will serve me well when I decide to go back to a 9–5 job. I am so glad I decided to switch from an English degree to American studies—I truly received a liberal arts degree!\n\nChristine Edler\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI am teaching at Northfield Mt. Hermon School in Northfield, Mass. My courses vary from the traditional U.S. history requirements to a contemporary issues course and a sophomore-level world history course. I have been a coach of field hockey, lacrosse, track, and basketball over the years. This coming year marks my 18th in the teaching field! I have a MALS degree from Dartmouth, which reminded me of how much I enjoy being a student. My American studies degree from Skidmore has come in handy more times than I can say. But perhaps the most important aspect of my American studies education is the reminder that some of the most interesting and provocative ideas come from outside the textbook (speakers, museum trips, hands-on activities). I often invite world travelers, for example, to come into my sophomore classes and talk about their views of the world. Then we discuss the kids' reactions. American studies reminds me that the world is full of living \"artifacts!\" History can be fun—even for high school students!\n\nMarcia Whittle Price\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI am living in St. Petersburg, Fla. I received my J.D. from Mercer University in 1998 and am presently the in-house counsel for Bankers/IMSG Insurance Co. Prior to returning to school, I worked in the insurance claims industry for several years. My American studies degree has been extremely valuable as it has helped me to develop the critical thinking skills necessary for a career in business and later, the law. In addition, I believe that the skills I acquired due to the program's great emphasis on writing have been instrumental in my success in the business/legal community.\n\nNancy Wagner Schaffer\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI received an M.A. in ancient history from the University of Wisconsin in 1986 and also studied modern Greek language at Aristotolean University and Archaeology at the University of Pennsylvania. I used my degree to teach ESL to Greeks and Japanese students in their respective countries. My lessons were usually with a history twist. I married in 1998 and my first child was born on December 2, 2000: Helena Grace Schaffer. Now I'm a mom and work part-time as an assistant buyer at New Super Liquor in Clifton Park, N.Y.\n\nCynthia Hawkins Guarino\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI am currently living and working in Bahrain, in the Middle East, as a newsreader on the radio. We've lived here since 1997 after spending the previous nine years living and working in Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, and a brief stint in Sweden. After graduating from Skidmore I worked in public affairs and event organization. In 1987 I received an M.B.A. from Columbia University and subsequently moved to Lausanne, Switzerland, with my husband. Since 1987 my work in various countries has encompassed event organization and government and public relations. My current position on the radio fully utilizes the skills aquired through the American studies degree as I am required to select, edit, and rewrite as necessary all the news I read on air. As course work in American studies develops these skills as well as encouraging exposure to many different areas of study, my work has benefited greatly.\n\nEllen Sprouls\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI am the executive director at Impression 5 in Lansing, Mich. Impression 5 (Science Center) is a hands-on learning center (museum). Our mission is to facilitate learners of all ages in appreciating, exploring, and understanding the wonders of the physical and natural world. The official name includes Science Center; however, we use only Impression 5. At Impression 5 we believe that learning is multidiscplinary, so our exhibits and programs are no longer limited to science. I also serve on the board of the Automobile National Heritage Area Lansing Corridor. The Automobile Heritage Area was established by Congress and is administered by the Department of Interior. Since moving to Lansing I have taken up photography. Last one of my photographs was included in a show at the Kresge Art Museum at Michigan State University and another appeared at Oxbow in Douglas, Michigan. Oxbow is a summer institute affiliated with the Art Institute of Chicago. During the month of May 2001 I will have a show of many of my photographs at the Greater Lansing Visitors Center. I am the featured artist of the month. The vast majority of my photographs are of buildings. I have also spent a lot of time working with the preservation planner for the City of Lansing doing research for several proposed local historic districts. The best program I have developed at Impression 5 is called Lansing: the Living Classroom. In this program we use the City of Lansing and all its component parts to teach local history and environmental science. You haven't lived until you have exposed a group of second-graders to the concept of reading a building and then you go out looking for clues from the past. This summer I am also teaching a class for middle school students on local government and city planning. So I use my American studies degree even though I am the director of a museum that was a science center.\n\nJane Page\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI graduated in 1982, earned a master of science degree in broadcasting from Boston University in 1987, and have worked as a producer and editor for public television in Washington, D.C. (thanks to the Washington Semester program!) and in Maryland. Since I have two boys, ages 3 and 5, I now freelance as a producer and editor of videos that promote the use of technology in the classroom. My clients include Johns Hopkins University and Maryland's State Department of Education. American studies was a dream major for me. I grew up in Massachusetts surrounded by history, but ironically never understood the significance of New England's history until I came to Saratoga. Combining art, fiction, firsthand accounts, and the works of historians breathes life into history in a way I couldn't have imagined. I think I learned how to boil information down to the essence of what it means, and that is crucially important for communicating through video. At most I have 15 minutes to convey a message to teachers that will inspire them to explore the technology options at their disposal. You have to find what clicks with them and give them just enough information to pique their curiosity.\n\nPaul Sigrist\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nAfter graduating as a double major in music and American studies, I spent a year in graduate school at NYU in the American civilization program. I then returned to Saratoga in the summer of 1983 and spent two years identifying and cataloging the entire collection of decorative and fine arts at Yaddo. The project culminated in a public lecture given at Yaddo in 1985 as well as a written catalog. During these same years I was curator of the historic costume and textile collection at the Saratoga County Historical Society at Brookside in Ballston Spa. In 1985 after the Yaddo project was completed, I assumed the position of curator of the Yates Collection at Skidmore, where I remained until 1989. All during the 1980s I also maintained my own antiques business in Saratoga. In 1989, I accepted a position at the Ellis Island Immigration Museum, which at that point had not opened to the public. I was the director of the Ellis Island Oral History Project at the museum from 1989 to 1999, overseeing all aspects of the project including conducting interviews, working with all kinds of researchers, conducting public lectures about the project, and training student interns from many different academic institutions. After resigning from Ellis Island in 1999, I returned to dealing in antiques, this time specifically selling 19th century Staffordshire ceramics. I also work as a professional actor and singer here in New York.\n\nLisa Harden Brickey\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI loved my major, although I'm not in a job one would immediately associate with the field. My husband and I launched, and continue to own and operate the Red Geranium. This is a home accessory and fine giftware business, started in 1982 in Rome, N.Y. It is in a circa 1840 cottage that had been condemned when we first occupied the building. This, of course, appealed to my architect husband and American studies self. We opened our second store in New Hartford, N.Y., in 1987, and our third location in DeWitt in 1996. Together we do all the buying for the stores, and my particular areas of expertise include all personnel hiring and scheduling, advertising planning and execution, and all computer work relating to invoices and accounts payable. I also spend many hours on the floor helping customers—the real wealth of retail. The best thing about my job is the flexiblity it affords me in trying to \"do it all.\" Our office is in our home, which allows me to be an at-home mom as well as a working woman. As for my American studies background relating to my occupation, both a specific and general example come to mind. A few years ago we came up with the idea of commissioning a custom afghan for our area, i.e. Oneida County. This involved a great deal of research, because I felt the afghan should present the history of the area. I read, interviewed, and wrote for permission to use images which ultimately were woven into thousands of afghans. In fact, this was so successful that we later designed three more afghans. My Skidmore education and American studies degree in particular equipped me with a writing ability that has been helpful on a daily basis. Whether I simply write memos or letters, press releases, or the historical paper that accompanies our custom afghans, I feel comfortable to take pen in hand. I would add here that my writing earned me my first job in the Communications and Development Office at Hamilton College directly after my 1980 graduation. I worked there for nearly seven years, writing proposals for small and large grants ranging from microscopes to buildings, writing for the alumni magazine, and even ghost-writing letters for the president of the college.\n\nEllen Flight\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI currently live in Middlebury, Vt. I received my M.A. in education from Lesley College Graduate School (now Lesley University). For fifteen years I taught seventh and eighth grade history, English, and writing in Washington, D.C., and Boston suburb independent schools. American studies taught me how to learn and think about history in a cultural context. This was especially handy during those times when I worked to write new curriculum. I was also fortunate to teach at schools where I could connect the literature study with the history curriculum. Currently I am director of a girls' summer camp. For this new job, I think the interdisciplinary nature of American studies has helped me be able to do all the different things this job involves: recruiting, hiring, overseeing kitchen and maintenance, writing articles, mandating, etc., and when I'm not sure what to do or how to proceed, I know how to find the info I need.\n\nDonald G. Lindsay\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI was not the shining light of the American Studies Department. The requirements for language arts skills were daunting for me. However, much of what was covered in the American studies curriculum was quite interesting. The courses heightened my ability to observe. A required interview for Material Culture led to Genesee Country Museum, a reconstructed 19th century village in Mumford N.Y. The curator was impressed. Apparently few students from other institutions had been able to come up with any intelligent questions. Fewer still had been able to pay attention to the answers to create a coherent series of questions. No other students had touched upon the reality of the work necessary to implement the museums goals and policies. Several months later, while struggling to complete my senior year, an unsolicited job offer came through. School took priority. Nevertheless Genesee Country Museum saved an interpreter job for me. I worked there from graduation until the museum closed for the winter in November. Interest in sailing, travel, and late 19th century life led me to a rewarding career. I spent over fifteen years sailing in square-rigged sailing ships. I am thankful for my Skidmore education. My ability to quickly study plans, specifications, procedures, and routines of various ships has given me a dramatic edge in evaluating the operating programs of these vessels. This advantage allowed me to spend time in ships that furthered my knowledge, skills and experience in the shortest amount of time. A Norwegian masters in nautical transport and a USCG license for \"master of steam, motor, sail and auxiliary sail vessels any gross tons upon oceans\" round out my professional qualifications. Very few living Americans have achieved either distinction. Fort Lauderdale, Fla., has been my home for the past five years. I have a rewarding career in an unrelated field, contribute to my church as platform assistant, and enjoy developing my public speaking skills.\n\nPaulette Adkins Rainie\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI reside outside D.C. in McLean, Va. I have been an aerobics instructor and personal trainer for fifteen years. I just graduated in May 2000 from a physical therapist assistant program and am now practicing in several rehab/subacute centers. I use my American studies background primarily when helping my three kids with homework! I am thrilled to have the degree and wouldn't trade it for the world!\n\nLaura Brockway\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI stayed in Saratoga for a few years working at the Gideon Putnam, after which I enrolled in business school at Emory in '82. I'm still in Atlanta. I never expected to stay this long. After Emory I went to the corporate world of Southern Bell, now Bell South, as a auditor of independent phone companies, among other jobs. After I took my CPA exam (I passed the first time I took it) I quit Southern Bell and started working for a small CPA firm. I stayed with them for eight months searching for my escape. For the next couple of years I filled my time with temporary jobs, presiding over a huge voluntary corporation, trying to help a friend start a company, and reading for a great guy who was blind. One of the temp jobs led to a permanent job doing accounting work for an Applebee's franchise. After Applebee's I held another job, then I did the temp job routine again and really enjoyed some of the long-term projects that I got. I started working for Martin and Yarborough CPA back in 1994. For the next two years I traveled almost every week auditing the federal government. The work experience allowed me to get my CPA in '96. I loved working for Martin and Yarborough even though they are devoted Republicans. But the government contract was lost and everyone was laid off. I then took a job as a controller of a Burger King franchise—my dream job, or so I thought. Again I sought my escape. My next career adventure was to enroll in the Art Institute of Atlanta and earn a degree in the culinary program. I am now officially Laura Brockway, BA, MBA, CPA, AA, CC. I'm a certified culinarian and a CPA. \"I cook the books.\" While I was in school I landed a contract to do accounting work for a very successful multi-store fine-dining restaurant company in Atlanta. As well, Martin & Yarborough got another government audit contract. Since they only needed me a few months I took a leave of absence from school to travel to San Francisco, Philadelphia, and Washington. I continued to work for the restaurant and returned to school. For the last three years I have been working two jobs and/or going to school full-time. When I'm not traveling I work from my home—no traffic, surrounded by my three cats. So after more than 20 years since leaving Skidmore, my career is finally at a place that I love.\n\nCarter (Jones) Meyer\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nNot a day goes by that I don't draw on my training in American Studies. After graduation from Skidmore, I worked briefly as an editor at Ginn and Company publishers in Lexington, Massachusetts, then entered the Ph.D. program in American Studies at Brown University. I received my Ph.D. from Brown in 1991 and began teaching shortly thereafter at Ramapo College of New Jersey. I spent 26 years on the faculty, serving either as chair of the American Studies or History programs for over half of them. My areas of expertise included American Indian history, the history of the American West, and late nineteenth and early twentieth century American cultural history. I always tried to model my academic work on the professors I had at Skidmore. That meant being a dedicated teacher and scholar, and trying to provide for my students the kind of academic opportunities I had as an undergraduate. Toward that end, I am honored to have received both the Henry Bischoff Excellence in Teaching Award and the Fred and Florence Thomas Faculty Award for significant and ongoing contributions to the development of Ramapo. Although I retired from the College in 2018, I continue my scholarship and stay involved in education, now as a docent at the Farnsworth Art Museum in Rockland, Maine. I'm also pleased that my daughter, Carter Robison Meyer (\"Kit\"), is a current American Studies major at Skidmore. I guess the apple didn't fall far from that interdisciplinary tree, did it?\n\nDebbie Gramkow Morton\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI began my career after Skidmore at the Peale Museum in Baltimore, Md. (the first museum in the U.S. built as a museum) later known as the Baltimore City Life Museum, where I started out as an assistant curator and then ended up doing public relations and fundraising. Something that all nonprofits always need! After working there for five years (the museum has recently been closed because of lack of funding—it is or was owned by the City of Baltimore), I switched jobs and was director for the annual fund at Garrrison Forest School in Owings Mills, Md. Once my children were born I switched to part-time there as an associate in the Development Office. I helped coordinate reunion weekend, special events, and trustee meetings, assisted with the Alumnae Bulletin and annual reports, and mostly worked on research of the constituents to help plan for a major capital campaign. Ten years ago, my husband changed jobs and we moved to Chicago. I have not been working for the last ten years, but have instead been at home in my role as a mom, and I do lots of volunteer work. I would say that majoring in American studies definitely gave me a broader view of America. I am still interested in American history, politics, and mostly American culture and art. The research we did was a crucial life skill: I use those skills every day! Also the organizational and analytical skills we developed in the research process are key to everyday life, working or not. My daughter, who is a freshman in high school, has been very interested in history, especially American history, and I am enjoying it with her too!\n\nKim D. West (passed away, 2019)\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI double-majored in history and American studies with the intent of teaching high school history. I believed the two majors gave me a balanced perspective on life in Colonial America, my area of interest. My career path and continued education, however, took me a different way. I received an M.A. in college personnel services from Teachers College, Columbia University, in 1983 and a Ph.D. in higher education administration from the University of Southern California in 1997. I have been a university administrator since graduating from Skidmore and am currently the director of residence life at the California Institute of Technology. I also teach in the graduate school of education at the University of Southern California. I thoroughly enjoyed Skidmore and the opportunity to know faculty like Tad Kuroda and Dave Marcell, both of whom I still occasionally see on campus. I have kept all of the books we used (and there were a lot!) and they are kept proudly on my bookshelves at home. I hope my children will someday explore them as well as consider Skidmore as they select a college. We have awhile to wait though: boy/girl twins born on April 28, 2000 will be members of the class of 2022! I should note that my daughter is named Cady Rutledge, Cady stolen from Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Rutledge being a family name that can be traced back to a signer of the declaration of independence (E.S. Rutledge). I keep telling her that she has a very rich, historical name, but all she does is look at me and spit up. Someday she'll get it!\n\nAnita Koppel Blackman\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nPresently I am chief of staff at the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation, a public corporation within the U.S. Department of Transportation. We operate locks in Massena, N.Y., that enable vessels to transit through the St. Lawrence River into the Great Lakes. I work directly for the administrator, who is based in Washington, D.C., and focuses a lot of effort on promotion of the system as well as day-to-day management. When I graduated from Skidmore in 1978 I did a short stint in law school and realized it wasn't for me. I did however want to get a legally and politically related job and went to work in the Minority Leader's Office of the New York State Assembly. In 1982 he obtained a presidential appointment in the Reagan Administration as Administrator of the Seaway and asked me to go to Washington with him to serve as special assistant and director of marketing. For the next seven years I worked at the Seaway, through his term. Then I worked with my husband in his public affairs consulting firm until 1991, when I was presented with an opportunity to career into the U.S. Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration as manager of the international trade mission program. For the past nine years I migrated through various positions within the U.S and Foreign Commercial Service working in the International Operations Office for Western Hemisphere overseeing commercial operations throughout Latin America and South America and ended my career there this past July as director of domestic operations. There I was responsible for overseeing 105 offices throughout the U.S. aimed at helping small and medium-sized companies export their products and services throughout the world. Out of the blue came the offer to return to the Seaway, and I jumped on it! Regarding your question about how my degree has helped me, I reflect on my Washington semester which really gave me Potomac fever! I spent the spring of 1977 at American University and just loved the city, promising myself that someday I'd return. Well, 18 years later, I've gone native! My interests in American history, politics, and culture certainly factored into my pursuit of an American studies degree in the first place and have played out in my career with the federal government too. I just love living here and take full advantage of all the city has to offer me and my family! We're always on the go!\n\nLynn Elisha Hansen\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nFor the past 18 years I have been owner of the Artisan Shop and Gallery, a contemporary American craft store representing American artists from all over the U.S. I currently have two stores. One is located in Wilmette and the other in Long Grove, Ill. I guess you could say my American studies degree paid off in that it has helped me to appreciate American art and the tradition that it comes from. I enjoy seeing the connection between art and life in my work, and I learned to make these connections through my American studies degree.\n\nDeborah Barton\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nCurrently I live in Baltimore, Md. I received my master's in speech/language pathology. My current work includes evaluation, development, and implementation of programs for speech- and/or language-impaired students in a Pre-K to eighth-grade school. I am a member of an interdisciplinary team and provide consultative services to school staff. My degree in American studies does not relate to my work, but I feel I had excellent preparation for teaching the English language to my students due to my study of American literature. In my personal life, I continue to enjoy visiting museums, traveling, and reading anything about American history.\n\nSam Croll\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI received an MA in religion from Yale in 1975 and a JD from the New York Law School in 1978. I practiced with the firm of Barnes Richardson and Coburn in New York in the late '70s and early '80s and also practiced on my own. In 1984 I began work at Croll Reynolds, a firm founded by my grandfather in 1917. We are an engineering group specializing in air pollution control equipment. We also design process equipment utilized by the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. I am currently president of the firm. The market for air pollution control equipment is driven for the most part by regulation, and therefore my legal background has helped. We have developed state-of-the-art designs for the control of air toxics. We are, for instance, currently involved in a project in the former Soviet Union where we will design a system to control the off-gas as rocket engines (for ICBMs) are destroyed. The process calls for approximately 1,000,000 CFM of gas flow! We are currently seeking investment capital to underwrite our projected growth. Until capital is secured, we will continue to bear significant risk.... I guess that's where my work at Yale comes in. On the process side, we have opened an engineering facility in Ahmedabad, India, and are currently discussing global alliances with our former competitors. My work at Skidmore was critical to the modicum of success that I have experienced. I was encouraged, for the first time, to look beyond/beneath the text, to bring imagination to the process of research. To be critical but yet creative in my approach to the task at hand. This has stayed with me.\n\nDiane Stone Kendall\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI now live in Houston, Texas. I received my master's in education from Nazareth College and did additional graduate work at Teachers College, Columbia University, in instructional technology. I am now a writer/editor/consultant/reviewer with my own little company called Children's Software Press. I write about technology in my own newsletter and on websites like www.smarterkids.com and www.powertolearn.com. I was also the co-author of Kids, Computers and Homework (Random House, 1995). When I left Skidmore I put my American studies background to work as a social studies teacher. Of course I never got to teach American history, but it was good background and training. I also worked as a research assistant for an organization that created for social studies teachers and as a textbook editor. Again, not in American history, but the training was useful. In 1980, I taught the first course anywhere on incorporating computers in the teaching of history at Teachers College, Columbia, and wrote a book on the subject. Perhaps the best skills I got out of my American studies training were how to find, analyze, and present material—all very useful in my real-world job these days!\n\nJanet Egan Steinmeyer\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI completed study at the International Institute of Culinary Arts, did an internship at Al Forno in Providence, R.I., and earned a fellowship at Le Mirador in Vevey, Switzerland. I've used my American studies degree in my previous career as director of development for the Rhode Island Historical Society, New England Historic Geneaological Society. I enjoyed the American studies program at Skidmore, especially Mary Lynn's courses, and was involved in public relations and fundraising for many years for historical societies in Boston and Providence. Recently I retired from my position as director of culinary arts at Rhode Island School of Design in Providence.\n\nMary Shirk Blakinger\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI have always felt that my undergraduate major in American studies at Skidmore has enriched my work as a newspaper reporter and editor, introducing at a theoretical level themes I later saw played out in municipal government and commerce. After graduating in 1972, I got a master of arts degree in communications from the Newhouse School at Syracuse University and went to work as a reporter in Harrisburg, Pa., the state capital, and then as a reporter and features editor in Bucks County, Pa. More recently, I was a reporter for the Philadelphia Inquirer, covering municipal government and then business in the counties west of the city. I left the Inquirer in June 2001 to pursue other writing and professional opportunities.\n\nDeborah Chapin-Horowitz\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI live in NYC. I received my MPA in 1974 from the University of Cinncinnati and my JD in 1974 from NYU. Recently I left Viacom after serving as associate general counsel of the Corporate Law Department for 11 1/2 years. Prior to Viacom I was in a private legal practice. Prior to law school, I worked for New York City Council President and the City of Cinncinnati. American studies was very helpful in my career in public service as well as law. It gives a good general background but should add some course work in American business.\n\nMary Crouter\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI was an American studies major at Skidmore, class of '72, but transferred to the University of New Hampsire after two years and graduated from there in 1972. I went to the University of Rhode Island, earning an M.L.S. in 1974; then a J.D. from George Washington University in 1981. I'm an attorney in the legislative division of the General Counsel's Office at the Department of Transportation in Washington, D.C. I have worked for the government for almost 27 years. My American Studies major was terrific. Unfortunately UNH didn't offer it, so I ended up a history major. I highly recommend AS; it has been valuable to me in the public sector.\n\nJane Feinberg Karlin\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI have lived in Manhattan since 1975. Following graduation, I went to Brown University to pursue a Ph.D. in American civilization. What I had not recognized was that the job market for American civilization Ph.D.s was getting very soft, and the best and brightest in the program were opting for lives as itinerant scholars. This was not for me. I left Brown with a master's, having used a National Endowment for the Humanities research grant to collect the data for the M.A. thesis. During the research and writing period I taught at Moses Brown School in Providence, the first woman ever to teach in this Quaker school's upper school. I taught history and American studies electives, based very much on my Skidmore experience. In 1975 I returned to Manhattan and began work in the Development Office of Pace University. I was hired not because of my fundraising experience—none—but because I could write and do research. A new career was born. Since 1975 I have been a fundraising professional in the university community, subsequently at New York University and the New School for Social Research, serving at the highest levels of administration. Today, I am the director of the fundraising division of Hadassah, the largest Jewish women's organization in the world with 300,000 members, the largest medical research center in the Middle East, Israel's leading college of technology, and a network of residential communities in Israel for youth at risk. In the U.S., the organization is a progressive voice for women's issues, especially in health, domestic violence, and genetic discrimination, as well as being a force in Jewish education. While working I obtained a Ph.D. from New York University in higher education leadership, administration, and technology. I reverted to my roots and wrote an American studies thesis, Disciples of Mercury: A Study of the Business Education Program of the Young Men's Christian Association, 1851–1916.\n\nDiana Williams Green\n\nCURRENT PURSUITS:\n\nI left Skidmore with hopes of entering the field of historical research but while debating graduate school, I decided to temporarily detour into the field of medical records administration.
