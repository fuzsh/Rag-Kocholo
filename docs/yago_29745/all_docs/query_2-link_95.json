The Committee met, Pursuant to notice, at 12:32 p.m., in room SH-216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. Patrick J. Leahy, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Leahy, Kohl, Feinstein, Feingold, Specter, Schumer, Durbin, Cardin, Whitehouse, Klobuchar, Kaufman, Franken, Sessions, Hatch, Grassley, Kyl, Graham, Cornyn, and Coburn. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. PATRICK J. LEAHY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF VERMONT Chairman Leahy. Good afternoon. I welcome everybody here. Just so you know the procedure--Senator Sessions and I have discussed this--we are going to recognize Senators in order of seniority doing the usual back and forth. Senator Sessions and I will each give an opening statement and, following our opening statement, take turns back and forth. I would urge Senators to stay--in fact, we are going to have to stay within the 10 minutes just simply to keep on schedule. Of course, Solicitor General Kagan, welcome to our Committee room. There are somewhat more people here than usual. But let me begin. One of the things that will change slightly our schedule this week is the death of Senator Byrd. All of us, I believe it is safe to say, both Republican and Democratic Senators, are saddened by his death. No Senator came to care more about the Constitution or to be a more effective defendant of our constitutional Government than the senior Senator from West Virginia. In many ways, he was the keeper of the Senate flame, the fiercest defender of the Senate's constitutional role and prerogatives. I do not know how many times we saw Senator Byrd hold up a copy of the Constitution. The difference between him holding it up and any one of us holding it up, he could put it back in his pocket and recite it verbatim, the whole Constitution. Others will speak of his record for the time served in the Senate and Congress, for the number of votes case. I knew him as a mentor and a friend. He served for a time on this Committee. I was honored to sit near him in the same row on the Senate floor and engage in many discussions about the Senate and its rules or about the issue of the moment or about our families. And it was a privilege to stand with him and fight against assaults on the Constitution and what the two of us felt was an unnecessary and costly war in Iraq. He was a self-educated man. He learned much throughout his life. He had much to teach us all. Senator Byrd was such an extraordinary man of merit and grit and determination who loved his family and drew strength from his deep faith, who took to heart his oath to support and defend the Constitution. The arc of his career in public service is an inspiration to all and should inspire generations of Americans. Now, on the issue before us today, there have been 111 Justices on the Supreme Court of the United States. Only three have been women. If she is confirmed, Solicitor General Kagan will bring the Supreme Court to a historical high-water mark. Elena Kagan earned her place at the top of the legal profession. Her legal qualifications are unassailable. As a student, she excelled at Princeton, Oxford, and Harvard Law School. She was a law clerk to the great Supreme Court Justice, Justice Thurgood Marshall, and I appreciate seeing Justice Marshall's son, Thurgood Marshall, in the audience here today. She worked in private practice and briefly for then-Senator Biden on this Committee. She taught law at two of the Nation's most respected law schools. She counseled President Clinton on a wide variety of issues. She served as Dean of Harvard Law School and is now the Solicitor General of the United States, sometimes referred to as ``the tenth Justice.'' I believe we are a better country for the fact that the path of excellence Elena Kagan has taken in her career is a path now open to both men and women. As Chief Justice Marshall wrote, our Constitution is ``intended to endure for ages . . . and consequently, to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs.'' He and other great Justices have recognized that the broadly worded guarantees and powers granted in the Constitution adapt to changing circumstances. Consequently, our Constitution has withstood the test of time. The genius of our Founders was to establish a Constitution firm enough to enshrine freedom and the rule of law as guiding principles, yet flexible enough to sustain a young Nation that was destined to grow into the greatest, the richest, most powerful Nation on Earth, and I might say one of the most diverse nations on Earth. It took more than four score years and a Civil War that claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands to end the enslavement of African-Americans and include as citizens ``all persons born or naturalized in the United States.'' Through the Civil War amendments that followed, we transformed the Constitution into one that more fully embraced equal rights and human dignity. The country and our democracy were stronger for it. But the job was not complete. It was halfway through the last century that racial discrimination was dealt a blow by the Supreme Court in the modern landmark case of Brown v. Board of Education, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and America began to provide a fuller measure of equality to those who were held back for so long because of the color of their skin. Our path to a more perfect Union also included the rejection 75 years ago of conservative judicial activism by the Supreme Court and our establishing a social safety net for all Americans. It began with us outlawing child labor and guaranteeing a minimum wage. Through Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, Congress ensured that growing old no longer means growing poor, and that being older or poor no longer means being without medical care. That progress continues today. All of us are the better for it. Now, the 100 members of the Senate stand here in the shoes of more than 300 million Americans as we discharge our constitutional duty with respect to this nomination. The Supreme Court exists for all Americans. Only one person gets to nominate somebody for the Court. Only 100 Americans get to vote on whether that person should be on the Court or not. It is an awesome responsibility, and I urge the nominee to engage with this Committee and through these proceedings with the American people in a constitutional conversation about the role of the courts and our Constitution. When we discuss the Constitution's Commerce Clause or spending power, we are talking about congressional authority to pass laws to ensure protection of our communities from natural and man-made disasters, to encourage clean air and water, to provide health care for all Americans, to ensure safe food and drugs, to protect equal rights, to enforce safe workplaces, and to provide a safety net for all seniors. Now, I reject the ideological litmus test, from either the right or the left, that some would apply to Supreme Court nominees. I expect judges to look to the legislative intent of our laws, to consider the consequences of their decisions, to use common sense, and to follow the law. In my view, a Supreme Court Justice needs to exercise judgment, should appreciate the proper role of the courts in our democracy, and should consider the consequences of decisions on the fundamental purposes of the law and in the lives of Americans. I will urge Solicitor General Kagan here publicly what I have urged her privately: to be open, to be responsive, to share with us but even more importantly with the American people her judicial philosophy, but also to assure us of her judicial independence from either the right or the left. I believe that fair-minded people will find her judicial philosophy well within the legal mainstream. I welcome questions to Solicitor General Kagan about judicial independence, but I would urge Senators on both sides to be fair. There is no basis to question her integrity, and no one should presume that this intelligent woman, who has excelled during every part of her varied and distinguished career, lacks independence. And it is essential that judicial nominees understand that, as judges, they are not members of any administration. The courts are not subsidiaries of any political party or interest group, and our judges should not be partisans. That is why the Supreme Court's intervention in the 2000 Presidential election in Bush v. Gore was so jarring and why it shook, in many people's minds throughout this country, the credibility of the Court. That is why the Supreme Court's recent decision in Citizens United, in which five conservative Justices rejected the Court's own precedent, rejected the bipartisan law enacted by Congress, rejected 100 years of legal developments in order to open the door for massive corporate spending on elections, was such a jolt to the system. The American people live in a real world of great challenges. The Supreme Court needs to function in that real world within the constraints of our Constitution. My own State of Vermont, the 14th State in the Union, did not vote to join the Union until the year the Bill of Rights was ratified. We are cautious in Vermont. Those of us from the Green Mountain State are protective of our fundamental liberties. We understand the importance the Constitution, and its amendments, have had in expanding individual liberties over the last 220 years. I hope that Elena Kagan will demonstrate through this hearing that she will be the kind of independent Justice who will keep faith with these principles and keep faith with the words that are inscribed in Vermont marble over the front doors to the Supreme Court: ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' I will put the rest of my statement in the record. [The prepared statement of Chairman Leahy appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman Leahy. Senator Sessions. STATEMENT OF HON. JEFF SESSIONS, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ALABAMA Senator Sessions. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to join you in recognizing this special moment of the loss of Senator Byrd who was such an institution here. He taught all of the new Senators something about the Senate. He believed there were two great Senates--the Roman Senate and the American Senate--and he wanted ours to be the greatest ever. I remember one day he gave a speech on a Friday morning that I heard in which he complained about textbooks and the failure to distinguish between a republic and a democracy. He went on at some length demonstrating that and then called them ``touchy-feely twaddle.'' [Laughter.] But he loved the Constitution, he loved our country, and he loved clarity of thought, and we will certainly miss him. Ms. Kagan, let me join Chairman Leahy in welcoming you here today. This nomination is certainly a proud day for you, your family, and your friends, and rightfully so. I enjoyed very much our meeting a few weeks ago and appreciated the chance to talk with you then. Mr. Chairman, thank you for your work on this nomination. As I have pledged, Republicans are committed to conducting this hearing in a thoughtful and respectful manner. It is not a coronation, as I have said, but a confirmation process. Serious and substantive questions will be asked. Ms. Kagan will be given ample opportunity to respond. Ms. Kagan certainly has numerous talents and many good qualities, but there are serious concerns about this nomination. Ms. Kagan has less real legal experience of any nominee in at least 50 years, and it is not just that the nominee has not been a judge. She has barely practiced law and not with the intensity and duration from which I think real legal understanding occurs. Ms. Kagan has never tried a case before a jury. She argued her first appellate case just 9 months ago. While academia certainly has value, there is no substitute, I think, for being in the harness of the law, handling real cases over a period of years. What Ms. Kagan's public record does reveal is a more extensive background in policy, politics, mixed with law. Ms. Kagan's college thesis on socialism in New York seems to bemoan socialism's demise there. In her master's thesis, she affirmed the activist tendencies of the Earl Warren Court, but complained that they could have done a better job of justifying their activism. President Obama's nominee started her political career in earnest as a staff on the Presidential campaign of Michael Dukakis. She took leave from teaching at law school to work for this Committee under then-Chairman Joe Biden to help secure the nomination of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a former counsel for the ACLU and now one of the most active members of Justices on the Supreme Court. I know you would join with me, Mr. Chairman, expressing our sympathy to Justice Ginsburg on the loss of her husband also. Chairman Leahy. A wonderful man. Senator Sessions. Professor Kagan left teaching law to spend 5 years at the center of politics, working in the Clinton White House, doing, as she described it, mostly policy work. Policy is quite different than intense legal work, for example, in the Office of Legal Counsel or some of the Divisions in the Department of Justice. During her White House years, the nominee was the central figure in the Clinton-Gore effort to restrict gun rights and as the dramatic 5-4 decision today in the McDonald case shows, the personal right of every American to own a gun hangs by a single vote on the Supreme Court. Ms. Kagan was also the point person for the Clinton administration's effort to block congressional restrictions on partial birth abortions. Indeed, documents show that she was perhaps the key person who convinced President Clinton to change his mind from supporting to opposing legislation that would have banned that procedure. During her time as Dean at Harvard, Ms. Kagan reversed Harvard's existing policy and kicked the military out of the recruiting office in violation of Federal law. Her actions punished the military and demeaned our soldiers as they were courageously fighting for our country in two wars overseas. As someone who feels the burden of sending such young men and women into harm's way and who spent much time drafting and redrafting legislation to ensure military recruiters were treated fairly on campus, I cannot take this issue lightly. Dean Kagan also joined with three other law school deans to write a letter in opposition to Senator Graham's legislation establishing procedures for determining who was an enemy combatant in the war on terror. She compared this legislation, which passed 84-14, to the fundamentally lawless actions of a dictatorship. Most recently, the nominee served as Solicitor General for little over a year, but her short tenure there has not been without controversy. In her first appellate argument, Ms. Kagan told the Court that the speech and press guarantees in the First Amendment would allow the Federal Government to ban the publication of pamphlets discussing political issues before an election. I would remind my colleagues that the American Revolution was in no small part spurred by just such political pamphlets: Thomas Paine's ``Common Sense.'' To suggest that the Government now has the power to suppress that kind of speech is breathtaking. Also as Solicitor General, Ms. Kagan approved the filing of a brief to the Supreme Court asking that it strike down provisions of the Legal Arizona Workers Act, which suspends or revokes business licenses of corporations which knowingly hire illegal immigrants, even though Federal law expressly prohibits such hiring. She did this even after the liberal Ninth Circuit had upheld the law. This is an important legal issue that the Court will resolve during the next term. And despite promises to this Committee that she would vigorously defend the Congress' ``Don't ask, don't tell'' policy for the military if it were challenged in court, the actions she has taken as Solicitor General do appear to have deliberately and unnecessarily placed that law in jeopardy. Importantly, throughout her career, Ms. Kagan has associated herself with well-known activist judges who have used their power to redefine the meaning of words of our Constitution and laws in ways that, not surprisingly, have the result of advancing that judge's preferred social policies and agendas. She clerked for Judge Mikva and Justice Marshall, each well-known activists, and she has called Israeli judge Aharon Barak, who has been described as the ``most activist judge in the world,'' as her hero. These judges really do not deny their activist ideas. They advocate it, and they openly criticize the idea that a judge is merely a neutral umpire. Few would dispute this record tells us much about the nominee. In many respects, Ms. Kagan's career has been consumed more by politics than law, and this does worry many Americans. In the wake of one of the largest expansions of Government power in history, many Americans are worried about Washington's disregard for limits on its power. Americans know that our exceptional Constitution was written to ensure that our Federal Government is one of limited separated powers and part of a Federal-State system with individual rights reserved to our free people. But we have watched as the President and Congress have purchased ownership shares in banks, nationalized car companies, seized control of the student loan industry, taken over large sectors of our Nation's health care system, and burdened generations of Americans with crippling debt. So this all sounds a lot like the progressive philosophy which became fashionable among elite intellectuals a century ago and which is now seeing a revival. They saw the Constitution as an outdated impediment to their expansive vision for a new social and political order in America. Even today, President Obama advocates a judicial philosophy that calls on judges to base their decisions on empathy and their broader vision of what America should be. He suggests that his nominee shares those views. Our legal system does not allow such an approach. Americans want a judge that will be a check on Government overreach, not a rubber stamp. No individual nominated by a President of either party should be confirmed as a judge if he or she does not understand that the judge's role is to fairly settle disputes of law and not set policy for the Nation. Broad affirmations of fidelity to law during these hearings will not settle the question. One's record also speaks loudly. Indeed, it is easy to pledge fidelity to law when you believe you can change its meaning later if you become a judge. Ms. Kagan has called previous confirmation hearings ``vapid and hollow''--some probably have been--and has argued that nominees for a lifetime position owe a greater degree of candor and openness to the Committee. I agree with that. I agree that candor is needed and look forward to this good exchange this week, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Leahy. Thank you very much. We will go next to Senator Kohl, and then we will go to Senator Hatch. Senator Kohl. STATEMENT OF HON. HERB KOHL, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF WISCONSIN Senator Kohl. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and good afternoon to you, Solicitor General Kagan. We welcome you to the Committee and extend our congratulations to you on your nomination. If confirmed, you will bring to the Court an impeccable resume and a formidable track record of accomplishments, and you will bring a new perspective to the bench, as each new Justice does, based on your life and on your career. You come before us today not from the halls of our judicial monastery, but with the insight of a scholar and a teacher and the political policy and legal acumen of a White House aide, law school dean, and the Solicitor General of the United States. Your encounters with the law have formed the lens through which you will judge the dilemmas of our democracy and the constitutional questions we face. At this hearing, we will try to learn from you how that lens will affect your judgment on the Court. Should you be confirmed, your decisions will impact our pocketbooks and our livelihoods and determine the scope of our most cherished rights, from the right to privacy to the right to equal education, employment, and pay, from the right to an attorney and a fair trial for the accused, to the right to speak and worship freely. In these difficult economic times in the wake of what could be the worst environmental crisis in our Nation's history, and as we continue our fight against terrorism, we are mindful of the great influence you will have on the issues and cases that wash up on the shores of our courts. The questions you will confront are not only concepts for lawyers and courts to contemplate. Behind the volumes of legal briefs are real people with real problems, and beyond the individual parties to each case will stand the rest of us who will feel either the brunt or the bounty of your decisions. We hear the overused platitudes from every nominee that he or she will apply the facts to the law and faithfully follow the Constitution. But deciding Supreme Court cases is not merely a mechanical application of the law. There will be few easy decisions, and many cases will be decided by narrow margins. You will not merely be calling balls and strikes. If that was the case, then Supreme Court nominations and our hearings would not be the high-stakes events that they are today. But all of these things do matter, and we care deeply about the Supreme Court precisely because it rules on only the toughest and the most challenging problems. We can all agree that your decisions will impact society long after you have left the Court. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes put it plainly, and I quote: ``Presidents come and go, but the Supreme Court goes on forever.'' That is why it is so important for us to know who you are, Solicitor General Kagan, what is in your heart, and what is in your mind. We can gain some insight from your work for President Clinton and Justice Thurgood Marshall. But we have less evidence about what sort of judge you will be than on any nominee in recent memory. Your judicial philosophy is almost invisible to us. We do not have a right to know in advance how you will decide cases, but we do have a right to understand your judicial philosophy and what you think about fundamental issues that will come before the Court. As you said in your own critique of these hearings in 1995, it is ``an embarrassment that Senators do not insist that a nominee reveal what kind of Justice she would make by disclosing her views on important legal issues.'' The President has his vetting process, and we in the Senate have our vetting process, but this hearing is the only opportunity for the American public to learn who you are. They deserve to learn about your views and motivations before you don the black robes of a Justice for a lifetime appointment. For each Supreme Court nomination in which I have participated, I have put each nominee to a test of judicial excellence, and your nomination will be no different. First, the nominee must demonstrate that she has the competence, character, integrity, and temperament necessary for any judge or Justice, and that she will have an open mind, not only willing to hear cases with an open mind, but also willing to decide cases with an open mind. I also look for a nominee to have the sense of values and judicial philosophy that are within the mainstream of legal thought in our country. No one, including the President, has the right to require ideological purity from a member of the Supreme Court. But we do have a right to require that the nominee accept both the basic principles of the Constitution and its core values implanted in society. And, finally, we want a nominee with a sense of compassion. Compassion does not mean bias or lack of impartiality. It is meant to remind us that the law is more than a mental exercise or an intellectual feast. It is about the real problems that will share the fabric of American life for generations to come. The great dilemmas of our democracy invite us to engage in a robust debate, and my hope is that we can engage in a substantive and candid dialog that will benefit not only those here on the Committee, but also, and most importantly, the public. The American people want and deserve a process that is more than what you characterized as a ``vapid and hollow charade'' and which so frustrated you just 15 years ago. In a tribute to Justice Marshall, you said that the stories he told to his law clerks served the purpose of reminding you that, ``Behind the law there are stories, stories of people's lives as shaped by the law, and stories of people's lives as might be changed by the law.'' So we are gathered here today to hear your stories, how your life has been shaped by the law, and how our lives might be changed by the law when you are on the Court. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Leahy. Thank you very much, Senator Kohl. Senator Hatch. STATEMENT OF HON. ORRIN G. HATCH, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF UTAH Senator Hatch. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Today is a sad day with the passing of our great colleague Senator Robert Byrd this morning and the death yesterday of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's husband, Marty. Senator Byrd was a towering presence in the Senate for decades, and his love for the Constitution and for this legislative body was well known. He stood up for it all the time, and, of course, I had nothing but great respect for him. I remember in the early years when I led the fight against labor law reform, he was not very happy with me. And, frankly, I was not very happy with him, either. But in the end, I gained such tremendous respect for him and love, even though we differed on so many issues. He was a towering figure. The Ginsburgs celebrated their 56th wedding anniversary just a few days ago--not as long as the 68 years that Senator and Erma Byrd were married before her death, but a good long time, nonetheless. Cancer was a part of the Ginsburgs' individual lives and their life together for many years, and I know that each of them was a source of strength and stability to the other. The Ginsburgs have been a model of dignity and grace, and Justice Ginsburg and her children will be in my prayers. Now I want to welcome you back to the Judiciary Committee, General Kagan. Something tells me this is likely to be your last confirmation hearing. As America's founders designed it, the Senate's role of advice and consent is a check on the President's power to appoint. Fulfilling that role requires us to evaluate a nominee's qualifications for the particular position for which she has been nominated. Qualifications for judicial service include both legal experience and judicial philosophy. While legal experience summarizes the past, judicial philosophy describes how a nominee will approach judging in the future. My primary goal in this confirmation process is to get the best picture I can of General Kagan's judicial philosophy, primarily from her record, but also from this hearing as well. I have to make my decision whether to support or not support her nomination on the basis of evidence, not on blind faith. I have never considered the lack of judicial experience to be an automatic disqualifier for a judicial nominee. Approximately one-third of the 111 men and women who have served on the Supreme Court have had no previous judicial experience. What they did have, however, was an average of more than 20 years of private practice experience. In other words, Supreme Court nominees have had experience behind the bench as a judge, before the bench as a lawyer, or both. Ms. Kagan worked for 2 years in a law firm, the rest of her career in academia and politics. As the Washington Post described it, she brings experience ``in the political circus that often defines Washington.'' One of my Democratic colleagues on this Committee recently said that Ms. Kagan's strongest qualifications for the Supreme Court are her experience in crafting policy and her ability to build consensus. The value of such experience depends on whether you view the Supreme Court as a political circus or view its role as crafting policy. I believe that the most important qualification for judicial service is the nominee's judicial philosophy or her approach to interpreting and applying the law to decide cases. This is what judges do. But different judges do it in radically different ways. Our liberty, however, requires limits on Government, and that includes limits on judges. Chief Justice Marshall wrote in Marbury v. Madison that America's Founders intended the Constitution to govern the judicial branch as much as the legislative branch. Unfortunately, many judges today do not see it that way but believe that they may themselves govern the Constitution. The Senate and the American people need to know which kind of Justice General Kagan will be. Will the Constitution control her or will she try to control the Constitution? Does she believe that the words of the Constitution and statutes can be separated from their meaning so that the people and their elected representatives put words on the page but judges may determine what those words actually mean? Does she believe it is valid for judges to mold and steer the law to achieve certain social ends? Does she believe that a judge's personal experiences and values may be the most important element in her decisions? Does she believe that clerks exist to protect certain interests? Does she believe that judges may control the Constitution by changing its meaning? Does she believe that judges may change the meaning of statutes in order to meet what judges believe are new social objectives? These are just some of the questions that go to the heart of a nominee's judicial philosophy. I want to clarify as best I can what kind of a Justice General Kagan would be. To do that, I have to examine her entire record. As in previous hearings, there will no doubt be some tension during this hearing between what Senators want to know and what General Kagan is willing to tell us. Unlike previous hearings, however, Ms. Kagan has already outlined quite clearly what she believes a Supreme Court nominee should be willing to talk about at a hearing like this. Without this information, Ms. Kagan has written, the Senate ``becomes incapable of either properly evaluating nominees or appropriately educating the public.'' Now, Ms. Kagan identified the critical inquiry about a Supreme Court nominee as ``the votes she would cast, the perspective she would add, and the direction in which she would move the institution. But the bottom line issue in the appointments process must concern the kinds of judicial decisions that will serve the country and correlatively the effect the nominee will have on the Court's decisions. If that is to results-oriented, so be it.'' Now, Ms. Kagan outlined that approach which she argued is necessary for Supreme Court confirmation hearings to be more than the acuity and farce in a law journal article when she was a tenured law professor after working for this Committee on a Supreme Court confirmation. I believe you will hear a lot about your remarks in the past and your law review article in the past. She was not a student writing a blog about some hypothetical topic that she knew nothing about. I am confident that Senators will give Ms. Kagan many opportunities in the next few days to provide the information and insight that she has argued is critical for the Senate properly to make a decision on her confirmation. This is a critical decision, and it is about more than just one person. Our decision will affect liberty itself. George Washington said this in his Farewell Address: ``The basis of our political systems is the right of the people to make and alter their constitutions of Government. But the Constitution which at any time exists, till changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all.'' The people's right to make and alter the Constitution means nothing if the people choose the Constitution's words. Judges choose what those words mean. A judge with that much power would effectively take an oath to support and defend not the Constitution but herself. Now, I hope that this hearing will help me further understand what kind of a Justice Ms. Kagan would be, and I wish you well and look forward to the rest of these hearings. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Leahy. Thank you very much, Senator Hatch. Senator Feinstein. STATEMENT OF HON. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Senator Feinstein. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I would like to begin with a word about Senator Byrd. I have served on the Appropriations Committee for 16 out of my 18 years in the Senate. Senator Byrd was the Chairman. He was tough, he was strong, he cared. Many times the Constitution popped out of his vest pocket. He certainly was, I think in anyone's book, a titan in the Senate, and he has left an indelible imprint. He will be missed. But today, it is welcome, Solicitor General Elena Kagan. Over the past few weeks there has been a drift net out trying to find some disqualifying fact or factor in your record. But, to date, I do not believe any such factor has been found. I believe that you are eminently confirmable. Your experience, I think, makes you a very strong nominee for the Court. You are the first woman Solicitor General of the United States--as such, the top litigator before the Supreme Court. And the Solicitor General is the only Federal official that is required in statute to be ``learned in the law.'' Of the 45 people who have held the job, five have gone on to the Supreme Court. You have filed hundreds of briefs before the Court. You have successfully defended the law, and you have the support of nearly every living Solicitor General. You were the first woman dean of Harvard Law School. There, you developed a reputation as a leader who brought all sides to the table. You were legal advisor to President Clinton, served as Associate White House Counsel, Deputy Director of the Domestic Policy Council, and you covered some tough issues: tobacco reform, importation of rapid-fire assault weapons, campaign finance, women's health, abortion. What comes across in reviewing your writings is that you are a valuable advisor, smart, reasonable, highly respected, principled. You also served as a special counsel to this Committee during the Ginsburg confirmation hearings. The biggest criticism I have seen out there is that you have never been a judge. Frankly, I find this refreshing. The Roberts Court is the first Supreme Court in history to be comprised entirely of former Federal court of appeals judges. Throughout the history of the Court, over one-third of the Justices, 38 out of 111, have had no prior judicial experience. They included Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who was a law clerk for the Supreme Court, worked for a law firm, and then was Assistant Attorney General in the Nixon administration. They include Chief Justice Earl Warren, who returned from World War II to prosecute cases as an Assistant District Attorney before becoming California's Attorney General and Governor. And they include Chief Justice Harlan Fiske Stone, who was dean of Columbia Law School and then Attorney General. These Justices also had no prior judicial experience, but their backgrounds proved valuable nonetheless. Judicial interpretation, I believe, is not a mechanical endeavor, like completing a math equation. The most powerful computer cannot tell us whether the President's powers as Commander in Chief allow him to exceed the bounds of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and other statutes in wartime. Nor can they tell us whether Congressional laws barring guns from the grounds of schools or implementing new health insurance requirements are within Congress' Article I powers. Nor can they tell us what the 14th Amendment's promise of equal protection under the law means for students in our public schools. These questions are among our Nation's most important, and it takes more than an umpire to find their answers. In recent years, there has been a radical change on the Supreme Court which was on display even this morning. This morning, I was extremely dismayed to learn of the Court's decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago, holding that common sense State and local gun laws across the country now will be subject to Federal lawsuits. This decision and its predecessor, District of Columbia v. Heller, have essentially disregarded the precedent of 71 years embedded in United States v. Miller, a 1939 case. I find that shocking as a former mayor. I believe the proliferation of guns have made this Nation less safe, not more safe. We now have more guns than people in this country. They are sold everywhere, on street corners, in gun shows, with no restraint whatsoever, any type of weapon. They fall into the hands of juveniles, criminals, and the mentally ill virtually every day of the year. And the Supreme Court has thrown aside seven decades of precedent to exacerbate this situation. From the documents that have been revealed thus far, I am encouraged that Solicitor Kagan holds stare decisis in high regard. We will see. She has shown determination to uphold the law even when she may personally disagree with it. For example, at Harvard, she expressed strong disagreement with ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell.'' But she allowed military recruitment to continue and, in fact, the number of recruits from the law school did not diminish. I believe it increased. And as Solicitor General, she defended the policy's constitutionality, arguing in a brief that the Court should defer to Congress's judgment. During the Clinton administration, she advised the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms that it could not ban importation of pre-1994 large-capacity ammunition feeding devices by Executive order. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms and I both wanted to ban these imports, but she argued successfully that the law simply did not give the Bureau that authority. Elena Kagan has written that the confirmation process should be a substantive one, that the kind of inquiry that would contribute most to the understanding and evaluation of a nomination would include discussion first of the nominee's broad judicial philosophy and, second, of her views on particular constitutional issues. I agree, and I look forward to a meaningful discussion this week. By all accounts, this nomination has been smooth so far. One newspaper even called it a ``snooze fest.'' If it is, it is because Elena Kagan is unquestionably qualified. Over 170,000 documents have unmasked her as an even-handed legal scholar with a sterling reputation. Each new set of documents makes it clearer that her views fall within the moderate mainstream of legal thinking in this country. So at this stage, I see no impediment to confirmation. I hope the week ends the same way. I look forward to proceeding. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Leahy. Thank you very much, Senator Feinstein. I also want to thank Senators. They have been keeping under the time limit, which means we are ahead of schedule. Senator Grassley. STATEMENT OF HON CHARLES E. GRASSLEY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF IOWA Senator Grassley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. General Kagan, congratulations on your nomination. It is an extremely important appointment, obviously a real honor. I also welcome your family and friends. They are obviously proud of your nomination, and I am glad that they are here to support you. I am committed to ensuring that this process is fair and respectful but also thorough. The Constitution tasks our Senate with conducting a comprehensive review of the nominee's record and qualifications. You have been nominated to a lifetime position. Consequently the Senate has a tremendous responsibility to ensure that you truly understand the proper role of a Justice and the Supreme Court in our system of Government. We want to ensure that, if confirmed, you will be true to the Constitution and the laws as written. We had a nice meeting in my office. You have an accomplished academic and policy background. You have excelled at Princeton University and Harvard Law School. You were an Oxford scholar. You clerked on the D.C. Circuit and the Supreme Court. You were a law professor at the University of Chicago Law School as well as Dean of Harvard Law School. You were a lawyer here on the Judiciary Committee and then with President Clinton's administration. You are now United States Solicitor General. Nobody can question such accomplishments. What is lacking from your background is any experience on any court or much experience as a practicing lawyer. We do not have any substantive evidence to demonstrate your ability to transition from being a legal scholar or political operative to a fair and impartial jurist. We will need to acquire that evidence through your writings and the positions you have taken over the years as well as your testimony. Answering our questions in a candid and forthright manner hopefully will fill that void. We know you cannot commit to ruling in a certain way or for a particular party. Our goal is to see if you will exercise judicial restraint. We want to know that you will exercise the preeminent responsibilities of a Justice by adhering to the law and not public opinion. Policy choices need to be reserved for those of us elected to the legislative branch of Government. It is our duty to confirm a nominee who has superior intellectual abilities but, more importantly, it is our duty to confirm a nominee who will not come with a results-oriented philosophy or an agenda to impose his or her personal politics and preferences from the bench. It is our duty to confirm a Supreme Court nominee who will faithfully interpret the law and Constitution without personal bias. The fact that you have not been a judge is not dispositive, but because of lack of judging experience, it is even more critical that we are persuaded that you have the proper judicial philosophy and will practice it. We must be convinced that you have the most important qualification of a Justice. That qualification is the ability to set aside your personal feelings and political beliefs so that you can administer equal justice for all in a dispassionate way. Your relatively thin record clearly shows that you have been a political lawyer. Your papers from the Clinton Library have been described as having--and these are not my words--``a flair for the political'' and ``a flair for political tactics.'' You have been described as having, another quote, ``finely tuned political antennae'' and ``a political heart.'' You were involved in a number of high-profile, hot-button issues during the Clinton Administration, including gun rights, welfare reform, abortion, and the Whitewater and Paula Jones controversies. A review of the material produced by the Clinton Library shows that you forcefully promoted liberal positions and offered analyses and recommendations that often were more political than legal. Not only that, your Marshall memos indicate a liberal and seemingly outcome-based approach to your legal analysis. You have admitted that your upbringing steeped you in deeply held liberal principles. We should know whether, as you have said, you have ``retained them fairly intact to this date.'' A judge needs to be an independent arbiter, not an advocate for a political agenda. This point is absolutely crucial for Justices since the Supreme Court is not as constrained to follow precedent to the same extent as judges of lower courts. You will have the final say on the law. You have been a prominent member of President Obama's team. In nominating you to be an Associate Justice, President Obama clearly believes that you measured up to his judicial empathy standard, a judge's ability, in other words, to empathize with certain groups over others. Indeed, President Obama said that you credited your hero, Justice Marshall, with reminding you ``that behind the law there are stories, stories of people's lives as shaped by the law, stories of people's lives as might be changed by the law.'' This empathy standard has been soundly rejected because it endorses the application of personal politics and preferences when judges decide cases. It encourages judges to usurp the functions held by the executive and legislative branches of Government. A judge or Justice must unequivocally reject that standard. It does not comport with the proper role of a judge or an appropriate judicial method. We all know that is not what our great American tradition envisioned for the role of the judiciary. I will be asking you about your judicial philosophy, whether you will allow biases and personal preferences to dictate your judicial method. You once wrote that it ``is not necessarily wrong or invalid'' for judges to ``try to mold or steer the law in order to promote certain ethical values and achieve certain social ends.'' You have also praised jurists who believe that the role of a judge is to ``do what you think is right and let the law catch up,'' and, again another quote, ``bridge the gap between law and society.'' To me, this kind of judicial philosophy endorses judicial activism, not judicial restraint and hopefully what you have said before is not how you would be in regard to these quotes when you get to the Supreme Court. I yield back the balance of my time but ask permission to put a longer statement in the record. Senator Kohl. [Presiding.] Without objection. [The prepared statement of Senator Grassley appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Kohl. Senator Feingold. STATEMENT OF HON. RUSSELL D. FEINGOLD, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF WISCONSIN Senator Feingold. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Kagan, welcome and congratulations on your nomination. Let me thank you in advance for the long hours you will spend with us this week. Like others, let me start, of course, by offering my condolences to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the passing of her husband, Martin. Our thoughts and prayers are with her and her family today. And, of course, we join the people of West Virginia in mourning the loss of their Senator and our colleague, Robert Byrd. Senator Byrd cared deeply about the Senate and the Constitution, and we cannot help but think of him as we begin this process today. I want to thank Chairman Leahy and compliment him and his staff on your efforts to make this confirmation process so open and transparent. Nearly 200,000 pages of documents about the nominee have been made publicly available online. I am particularly pleased that you joined with the Ranking Member to request a complete and timely search of Presidential archives so that as much information about the nominee's past work as possible could be reviewed by the Committee and the public before these hearings. And I think that former President Clinton deserves our thanks as well for his agreement to release to the Committee a significant amount of material that he was entitled to block under the Presidential Records Act. The Supreme Court plays a unique and central role in the life of our Nation. Those who sit as Justices have extraordinary power over some of the most important and most basic aspects of the lives of American citizens. The nine men and women who sit on the court have enormous responsibilities, and those of us on this Committee have a significant responsibility as well. Ms. Kagan, I hope you will be forthcoming in your answers so we can have the open and honest discussion of issues that the country deserves. In 2005, when we began our confirmation hearings for Chief Justice Roberts, the Court had not seen a new member for 11 years. Now we are beginning the fourth Supreme Court confirmation hearing in the last 5 years, and today for the first time we begin a hearing on a nomination that could result in three women sitting on the Supreme Court at one time. We have come a long way from the days when Justice Ginsburg was turned down for a prestigious clerkship because she was a woman and where Justice O'Connor graduated from Stanford Law School but no law firm would hire her as a lawyer, instead offering her a position as a secretary. I hope this is just the beginning. Women are increasingly outnumbering men on law school campuses across the Nation, and I am pleased that the Court is beginning to reflect that fact. I also hope that we will continue to see greater diversity on the Court in other ways, including representation from Midwestern and Western States. It is important that all Americans feel the Court represents their life experiences and their values, and I think one of the best ways to accomplish that is by selecting candidates for this position who reflect the full diversity of this great country. The Court that is now taking shape and that Elena Kagan will join if she is confirmed will shape the country for many years to come. It will address the most crucial legal issues affecting our National security and the freedoms of our citizens. It will decide what limits there are on how the people's elected representatives can solve the difficult economic and social problems that the country faces. It will confront questions of race that are as old as our Nation and as new as the changing demographics of the 21st century. Because these questions that will come before the Court in the next few decades are so weighty, it is unfortunate that a growing segment of Americans seem to have lost trust in the Court and its Justices. Supreme Court cases by their nature can divide the country. Important cases with far-reaching consequences are often decided now by a 5-4 vote. So it is absolutely essential that the public have confidence that those decisions are not made on the basis of an ideological or partisan political agenda. The fairness, objectivity, and good faith of Justices should be beyond question. So as Chairman Leahy suggested, when a decision like the one handed down earlier this year by a 5-4 vote in the Citizens United case uproots longstanding precedents and undermines our democratic system, the public's confidence in the Court cannot help but be shaken. I was very disappointed in that decision and in the Court for reaching out to change the landscape of election law in a drastic and wholly unnecessary way. By acting in such an extreme and unjustified manner, the Court badly damaged its own integrity. By elevating the rights of corporations over the rights of the people, the Court damaged our democracy. Ms. Kagan, if you are confirmed, I hope you will keep this in mind. I hope you will tread carefully and consider the reputation of the Court as a whole when evaluating whether to overturn longstanding precedent in ways that will have such a dramatic impact on our political system. You have developed a reputation as someone who can reach out to those with whom you may not agree and work together, and I think that is a skill that will prove to be very useful and valuable if you are confirmed. You also have an impressive education, you have worked at the highest levels of Government, and you have taught and written about the law. I have no doubt that you understand our system of Government and the roles of the three branches. But, most importantly, I hope you appreciate the impact that the law has on the lives of all Americans. So it is my hope that your diverse experiences, your thoughtfulness and openness, and your talent for consensus building will allow you to see the long-term dangers to the Court and to the country of a decision like Citizens United and enable you, if confirmed, to convince your colleagues to avoid making similar mistakes in the future. I also hope that you will have the wisdom and the courage that the Justice you have been nominated to replace, Justice John Paul Stevens, showed time and time again in drawing the line against an executive branch that sought powers that endangered the individual rights and freedoms that our Constitution guarantees. Ms. Kagan, of course, judging is not easy. It is not just a matter of calling balls and strikes, because judges, and particularly Justices in the Supreme Court, are called upon to apply constitutional values that, as Justice Souter said recently, may well exist in tension with each other, not in harmony. In these hearings, you will have the opportunity to show the American people that you have the right combination of qualities and qualifications to make a good Justice. I wish you well in that task, and I look forward to the conversation you will have not only with me but with my colleagues and with the country. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Leahy. [Presiding.] Thank you very much, Senator Feingold. Senator Kyl. STATEMENT OR OF HON. JON KYL, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ARIZONA Senator Kyl. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Congratulations, Solicitor General Kagan, and welcome to the Committee. I would first note an agreement that I have with Senator Feingold. We do need more diversity on the Court. I note it has been 3 years now since an Arizonan has been on the Supreme Court. Chairman Leahy. I only confirm them. I do not pick them. [Laughter.] Senator Kyl. Mr. Chairman, 1 year ago, we sat in this same room to consider the nomination of then-Judge Sotomayor. Although I could not ultimately support her nomination, I was pleased that she testified that the role of a judge is to put aside any biases or prejudices and to impartially apply the law to resolve disputes between parties. Judge Sotomayor explicitly rejected the empathy standard that had been espoused by President Obama, the standard where legal process alone is deemed insufficient to decide the so- called hard cases, the standard where the critical ingredient is supplied by what is in the judge's heart. Perhaps because his first nominee failed to defend the judicial philosophy that he was promoting, the President has repackaged it. Now he says that judges should have a keen understanding of how the law affects the daily lives of the American people and know that in a democracy powerful interests must not be allowed to drown out the voices of ordinary citizens. The clear implication is that, at least in some kind of cases, judges should abandon impartiality and instead engage in results-oriented judging. Indeed, his own press secretary has confirmed the President's results-oriented view. Exactly what kinds of results is the President looking for from his judges? Perhaps he wants judges who will ignore the serious constitutional questions surrounding some of his domestic legislation. Or maybe he wants judges who will use the bench to advance progressive goals that have been stalled in the political process. Whatever the President's motivation, his view of the role of judges is wrong. Judges are to apply the law impartially, not take on social causes or cut down powerful interests. While they may disagree with legislative solutions to problems, it is not their prerogative to fix inequities. Part of our task is to determine whether Ms. Kagan shares President Obama's results-oriented philosophy of judging or is instead committed to impartiality. This may be a more difficult task with Ms. Kagan than with other Supreme Court nominees who have come before the Committee, most of whom have had substantial judicial records to evaluate. For instance, Judge Sotomayor issued 15,000 opinions in a decade and a half of district and circuit court service. Ms. Kagan has never served on any bench. Indeed, except for a brief 2-year stint in private practice and 1 year as Solicitor General, Ms. Kagan's entire career has been divided between academia and policy positions in the Clinton administration. Given this lack of experience practicing law, I was surprised that the American Bar Association awarded her a Well Qualified rating since the ABA's own criteria for a judicial nominee call for, among other things, at least 12 years' experience in the practice of law, and they mean actual practice of law, like former Justices Rehnquist and Powell. Not only is Ms. Kagan's background unusual for a Supreme Court nominee, it is not clear how it demonstrates that she has, in the President's words, a keen understanding of how the law affects the daily lives of the American people. One recent article noted that Ms. Kagan's experience draws from a world whose signposts are distant from most Americans: Manhattan's Upper West Side, Princeton University, Harvard Law School, and the upper reaches of the Democratic legal establishment. Her career in academia tells us relative little about her views on legal issues. In 14 years as a professor, she published only nine articles, two of which were book reviews, and her tenure in the academy was marred, in my view, by her decision to punish the military and would-be recruits for a policy, ``Don't ask, don't tell,'' and the Solomon amendment that was enacted by Members of Congress and signed into law by President Clinton. Despite this relatively thin paper trail, there are warning signs that she may be exactly the results oriented Justice President Obama is looking for. Consider, for example, the judges that Ms. Kagan says she most admires. Ms. Kagan has called Israeli Supreme Court Justice Aharon Barak her ``judicial hero.'' Justice Barak is widely acknowledged as someone who took an activist approach to judging. One respected judge, Richard Posner, described Barak's tenure on the Israeli Supreme Court as ``creating a degree of judicial power undreamed of even by our most aggressive Supreme Court Justices.'' Ms. Kagan identified Thurgood Marshall as another of her legal heroes. Justice Marshall is a historic figure in many respects, and it is not surprising that as one of his clerks, she held him in the highest regard. Justice Marshall's judicial philosophy, however, is not what I would consider to be mainstream. As he once explained, ``You do what you think is right and let the law catch up.'' He might be the epitome of a results-oriented judge. And, again, Ms. Kagan appears to enthusiastically embrace Justice Marshall's judicial philosophy, calling it, among other things, ``a thing of glory.'' In 2003, Ms. Kagan wrote a tribute to Justice Marshall in which she said that, in his view, ``It was the role of the courts in interpreting the Constitution to protect the people who went unprotected by every other organ of Government, to safeguard the interests of people who had no other champion. The Court existed primarily to fulfill this mission.'' And later, when she was working in the Clinton administration, she encouraged a colleague working on a speech about Justice Marshall to emphasize his ``unshakable determination to protect the underdog, the people whom no one else will protect.'' To me, this sounds a lot like what President Obama is saying now. And Ms. Kagan's work as a Supreme Court clerk for Justice Marshall contains evidence that she shares his vision of the Constitution. In many of her memos to Justice Marshall, Ms. Kagan made recommendations concerning the disposition of cases which appear to be based largely on her own liberal policy preferences. For example, despite her view that one lower court's decision was ludicrous and lacked a legal basis, Ms. Kagan nonetheless recommended that Justice Marshall vote to deny further review because to do otherwise, she wrote, ``would likely create some very bad law'' on abortion and/or prisoners' rights. This kind of naked political judgment appears frequently throughout Ms. Kagan's work as a judicial clerk. In another case, Ms. Kagan said that the Supreme Court should take the case because it is even possible that the good guys might win on this issue. I am concerned about her characterization of one party as ``the good guys.'' Too often it sounds to me like Ms. Kagan shares the view of President Obama and Justice Marshall that the Supreme Court exists to advance the agenda of certain classes of litigants. In another case, Ms. Kagan wrote that there is no good reason to place an exclusionary rule before this Court which will doubtlessly only do something horrible with it. And in another memo laced with political considerations, Ms. Kagan wrote, ``I see no reason to let this Court get a crack at this question.'' She was even more explicit in a handwritten note, after reviewing the Government's response in another case, saying, ``I continue to believe that the facts did not support the arrest, but I cannot see anything good coming out of review of this case by this Court.'' Ms. Kagan explains these recommendations as primarily channeling Justice Marshall, but the question is whether she really has any major differences with him and whether she sees anything wrong with taking the same approach. I see no evidence that that is the case. In addition my general concern about whether Ms. Kagan could decide cases impartially and without bias for or against certain parties, a surprising number of things in her relatively thin body of work do raise substantive concerns about various issues such as federalism, free speech, national security, and others. To take a last example, I am deeply troubled by her decision as Solicitor General to urge the Supreme Court to review and strike down an Arizona law designed to prevent employers from hiring illegal aliens. The Ninth Circuit unanimously upheld the law and the lower court decision because Federal immigration law explicitly allows States to sanction employers through their business licensing regimes. I think there are legitimate questions about whether the brief authorized by Ms. Kagan, which flies in the face of the plain language of the law and urges the Supreme Court to strike these enforcement provisions down, was motivated by political influence at the White House and within the Department of Justice. And I am convinced that without the urging of her office, the Court would not have granted cert in the case today. Mr. Chairman, in conclusion, there is ample reason for members of this Committee to carefully scrutinize this nominee, scrutiny which she invited in her now famous Chicago Law Review article in 1995. Because she has no judicial record on which we can determine whether she is a results-oriented nominee or would approach each case as a neutral arbiter, I believe the burden is on the nominee to show that her record demonstrates that she can be a fair and impartial Justice rather than one who would have an outcome-based approach. I look forward to her testimony. Chairman Leahy. Senator Specter. STATEMENT OF HON. ARLEN SPECTER, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA Senator Specter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Solicitor General Kagan, I join my colleagues in welcoming you here this morning. With the passing of Senator Byrd earlier today, I was reminded of our hearings for Judge Bork and Senator Byrd's participation in those hearings and a candid shot of him taken one Saturday when we had an hour Saturday morning session with Judge Bork, and his picture appeared on the front page of the Sunday New York Times, and he will be with us in these hearings and much of our thinking on the interpretation of the Constitution. This hearing presents a unique opportunity perhaps to have questions answered which have not been answered in the past. The article which you authored for the Chicago Law Review back in 1995 is openly and specifically critical of Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer who, as you characterize it, ``stonewalled.'' You criticized the Judiciary Committee, and I think properly so, as ``lacking seriousness and substance'' in our approach to the hearings. And you used the phrase that the confirmation process ``takes on an air of vacuity and farce.'' You quote Senator Biden, then-Chairman, and myself expressing concerns that 1 day the Committee would ``rear up on its hind legs and reject a nominee who refused to answer questions for that reason alone.'' So this is a unique hearing in that respect. The Court, regrettably, I think, has become an ideological battleground, and the activism is on both sides. As a prosecutor in the 1960s, I watched the Constitution change virtually daily: search and seizure map, 1961; right to counsel, Gideon v. Wainwright, 1963; Miranda 1966. Activism. We have the Supreme Court now having adopted a test of determining constitutionality since 1996 on congruence and proportionality, an impossible standard except as Justice Scalia described it as a ``flabby test which enables judicial legislation.'' We have had nominees who sat where you sit not too long ago who said they would not ``jolt the system,'' ``modesty,'' and then a grave jolt to the system; assure this panel that the legislative finding of facts is not a judicial function, and then turn that on its head in Citizens United on a record that is a hundred thousand pages long and finding that there is no basis for a 100-year-old precedent, which was overturned. Certainly a jolt to the system. When Senator Biden was considering the nomination of Chief Justice Roberts, he said that he was qualified, but would vote against him because of, as then-Senator Obama said, ``overarching political philosophy.'' Well, the Presidents make their selections based on ideology. I think that is a blunt fact of life, and the deference that I had considered in my earlier days in the Senate, I have come to the conclusion that Senators have the same standing to make a determination on ideology. It has become accepted that there should not be transgression into the area of judicial independence on how a case would be decided. There is an interesting case captioned Minnesota v. White, a Justice Scalia opinion in 2002, which struck down a requirement of the Minnesota Bar Association which prohibited judges from saying how they would decide cases. The Supreme Court said that was an infringement on First Amendment rights of freedom of speech. Now, that does not say that a judge should answer the question, but it does say that a bar association rule prohibiting answering the question is invalid, which leaves the judge, at least so far as that standard is concerned, with the latitude to answer the question. So that even on the ultimate question of how a case will be decided, that in your law review article you come very close to that when you talk about answering substantive legal issues, really right on the line of how you would decide a case. But if we are precluded from asking how decisions would be--what decision would be made on grounds of judicial independence and the precedent on that, I do think it is fair for us to ask whether the Supreme Court would take a case. The Congress has the authority to direct the Supreme Court on cases which must be heard--flag burning case, McCain-Feingold, and many, many others--so that the Court's discretion is limited there if there is a Congressional direction. I think it is fair from that proposition to ask nominees whether they would take cases. I have spoken at length on the floor about what I consider the inappropriate decline in the number of cases considered. A hundred years ago, a little more, in 1886, the Supreme Court decided 146 cases, 146 opinions. A little more than 20 years ago, 1987, 146 opinions. Last year, last term, 78 arguments, 75 opinions. A lot of circuit splits, important cases, are not taken up by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court declined to hear the conflict which, arguably, is the most serious clash between Congress's Article I powers under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which sets the exclusive means for getting a warrant, listening to a wiretap, probable cause, and the President's warrantless wiretap program justified under Article II. A Detroit Federal judge said it was unconstitutional. The Sixth Circuit ducked it, with a standing decision 2-1, with admittedly the dissenting opinion much stronger, application for cert denied. And this is something I discussed with you in our meeting, for which I thank you. I sent you a series of letters on issues which I intend to ask you about, and that was one of them. I was concerned about your decisions as Solicitor General on the case involved the Holocaust victims suing an Italian insurance company, and the Second Circuit bows to the executive position, saying, well, that ought to be decided between Italy and the United States on how that is to be handled. I think that is wrong, but at least the Supreme Court ought to decide it. I am not going to ask you how you would decide the case, but would you consider it. A case involving the survivors of victims of 9/11 has not been heard. A petition for cert from the Second Circuit, the Second Circuit said, well, the sovereign immunities case does not apply because Saudi Arabia has not been declared a terrorist state. That has really got nothing to do with the Act, congressional intent. Torts are not covered by sovereign immunity. You disagreed with the Second Circuit but said the acts occurred outside of the country, a distinction that I do not understand if the consequence is that the Towers and 3,000 Americans are killed. Certainly the Sovereign Immunities Act ought to make Saudi Arabia subject to suit. But I would not ask you how you would decide the case, but if you would take it up. Another issue which will not be resolved today, and perhaps never, is how to see to it that the nominees who make statements here on congressional power and on stare decisis follow up on it. And maybe the closest approach is the idea of televising. In our meeting you said you would favor televising the Court. Not exactly the same, but Brandeis talked about sunlight and publicity being the best disinfectant. Well, it is not a disinfectant we are looking for here, but to hold nominees who answer questions here to follow through when they are on the Court. Thank you. Chairman Leahy. Thank you very much. Senator Graham. STATEMENT OF HON. LINDSEY GRAHAM, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA Senator Graham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Congratulations. I think it will be a good couple of days. I hope you somewhat enjoy it, and I think you will. Like everyone else, I would like to acknowledge the passing of Senator Byrd. He was a worthy ally and a very good opponent when it came to the Senate. My association with Senator Byrd, during the Gang of 14, I learned a lot about the Constitution from him, and as all of our colleagues will remember, just a few years ago we had a real conflict in the Senate about filibustering judicial nominees. And it was Senator Byrd and a few other Senators who came up with the extraordinary circumstances test that would say that filibusters should only be used in extraordinary circumstances because elections have consequences. And Senator Byrd was one of the chief authors of the language defining what an extraordinary circumstance was. So I just want to acknowledge his passing. It is going to be a loss to the Senate. And the thing that we all need to remember about Senator Byrd is that all of us are choosing to judge him by his complete career, and history will judge him by his complete career, not one moment in time, and that is probably a good example for all of us to follow when it comes to each other and to nominees. Now, you are the best example I can think of why hearings should be probative and meaningful. You come with no judicial record, but you are not the first person to come before the Committee without having been a judge. But it does, I think, require us and you to provide us a little insight as to what kind of judge you would be. You have had very little private practice, 1 year as Solicitor General, and a lot of my colleagues on this side have talked about some of the positions you have taken that I think are a bit disturbing, but I would like to acknowledge some of the things you have done as Solicitor General that were, I thought, very good. You opposed applying habeas rights to Bagram detainees. You supported the idea that a terrorist suspect could be charged with material support of terrorism under the statute, and that was consistent with the law of wars history. So there are things you have done as Solicitor General that I think merit praise, and I will certainly, from my point of view, give you a chance to discuss those. As Dean of Harvard Law School, you did two things: you hired some conservatives, which is a good thing; and you opposed military recruitment, which I thought was inappropriate, but we will have a discussion about what all that really does mean. It is a good example of what you bring to this hearing, a little of this and a little of that. Now, what do we know? We know you are very smart. You have a strong academic background. You have bipartisan support. The letter from Miguel Estrada is a humbling letter, and I am sure it will be mentioned throughout the hearings, but it says a lot about him. And it says a lot about you that he would write that letter. Ken Starr and Ted Olson have suggested to the Committee that you are a qualified nominee. There is no doubt in my mind that you are a liberal person. That applies to most of the people on the other side, and I respect them and I respect you. I am a conservative person, and you would expect a conservative President to nominate a conservative person who did not work in the Clinton administration. So the fact that you have embraced liberal causes and you have grown up in a liberal household is something we need to talk about, but that is just America. It is OK to be liberal. It is OK to be conservative. But when it comes time to be a judge, you have got to make sure you understand the limits that that position places on any agenda, liberal or conservative. Your judicial hero is an interesting guy. You are going to have a lot of explaining to do to me about why you picked Judge Barak as your hero, because when I read his writings, it is a bit disturbing about his view of what a judge is supposed to do for society as a whole. But I am sure you will have good answers, and I look forward to that discussion. On the war on terror, you could, in my view, if confirmed, provide the Court will some real-world experience about what this country is facing, about how the law needs to be drafted and crafted in such a way as to recognize the difference between fighting crime and fighting a war. So you, in my view, have a potential teaching opportunity, even though you have never been a judge, because you have represented this country as Solicitor General at a time of war. The one thing I can say without certainty is I do not expect your nomination to change the balance of power. After this hearing is over, I hope the American people will understand that elections do matter. What did I expect from President Obama? Just about what I am getting. And there are a lot of people who are surprised. Well, you should not have been if you were listening. So I look forward to trying to better understand how you will be able to take political activism, association with liberal causes, and park it when it comes time to be a judge. That to me is your challenge. I think most people would consider you qualified because you have done a lot in your life worthy of praise. But it will be incumbent upon you to convince me and others, particularly your fellow citizens, that whatever activities you have engaged in politically and whatever advice you have given to President Clinton or Justice Marshall, that you understand that you will be your own person, that you will be standing in different shoes where it will be your decision to make, not trying to channel what they thought. And if at the end of the day you think more like Justice Marshall than Justice Rehnquist, so be it. The question is: Can you make sure that you are not channeling your political agenda, your political leanings when it comes time to render decisions? At the end of the day, I think the qualification test will be met. Whether or not activism can be parked is up to you. And I look at this confirmation process as a way to recognize that elections have consequences and the Senate has an independent obligation on behalf of the people of this country to put you under scrutiny, firm and fair, respectful and sometimes contentious. Good luck. Be as candid as possible, and it is OK to disagree with us up here. Thank you. Chairman Leahy. Thank you, Senator. Next, Senator Schumer. STATEMENT OF HON. CHARLES E. SCHUMER, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK Senator Schumer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I, too, want to note the passing of our friend and leader Senator Byrd.
