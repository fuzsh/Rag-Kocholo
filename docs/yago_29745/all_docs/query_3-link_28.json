        "text": "ON a crowded train somewhere in Pennsylvania in the aftermath of World War II, Robert Kagan gave up his seat to Gloria Gittelman, a fellow student from Pennsylvania State University, on a trip home during a school holiday. He was bound for Brooklyn, she for South Philadelphia.\n\nThat chance meeting led to a courtship and then marriage in 1950, after Mr. Kagan had begun studying at Yale Law School. The couple settled in Manhattan and had three children: Marc, Elena and Irving.\n\nElena grew up to become dean of Harvard Law School and President Obama’s solicitor general, and if the Senate confirms her after hearings that begin on June 28, she would be the 112th justice of the United States Supreme Court. But before all that, she was the middle child in a New York family whose intellectual dynamism and embrace of liberal causes provide a window onto the social milieu and culture that shaped her.\n\nThe three Kagan children came of age during the social and political ferment of the 1970s, when community groups were absorbing the lessons of the civil rights and antiwar movements, and Bella Abzug won a seat representing the Upper West Side in Congress after she declared, “This woman’s place is in the House — the House of Representatives.”\n\nRobert Kagan, their father, carved out a law practice representing tenants in the wave of co-op conversions that swept the city. He also volunteered his skills on a number of land-use issues roiling their Upper West Side neighborhood, once roping himself to a tree that was about to be cut down. Their mother, Gloria, taught for 20 years at Hunter College Elementary School, where she was legendary for challenging her students to challenge themselves, sometimes to the point of making them tremble.\n\nIrving Kagan, the youngest, beat a quick path to teaching at Hunter College High School, where many of his students ask to remain on his e-mail list of recommended reading after they graduate. Marc Kagan, the eldest, shed the trappings of his Yale education and middle-class upbringing to become a transit worker. Years later he emerged as an influential union leader before becoming a teacher.\n\n“There was thinking, always thinking,” Joyce Kagan Charmatz, Robert Kagan’s sister-in-law, 71, said of the family’s dinner table. “Nothing was sacrosanct.”\n\nROBERT KAGAN, son of a Russian Jewish immigrant who manufactured and sold hats and clothing in New York, worked for several years in corporate and tax law. He then formed a firm with Bill J. Lubic, an old classmate from Lafayette High School in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, who, like Robert and Gloria Kagan, lived in Stuyvesant Town.\n\nOne of the first co-op conversions they handled was at 320 West End Avenue, a gracious 15-story structure where the Kagans had moved. The building’s owner had gone into default.\n\n“Bob and I had an office on Avenue of the Americas at 47th Street, a half block away from the bank’s office, and we walked in there and said, ‘Don’t you want to get rid of this?’ ” Mr. Lubic recalled. With some prodding, they walked the building’s three dozen or so tenants through the complex process of buying their own apartments.\n\nFor many, it would turn out to be the investment of a lifetime: the Kagan children sold their family’s 1,700-square-foot apartment, 3B — a “classic 6,” with two bedrooms and a maid’s room — last year for $1.325 million. “Dealing with tenant groups, we were out sometimes four nights a week, and weekends too,” Mr. Lubic said. “Bob was one of these people really committed to the law, not to the financial monuments but to the principle, and using it to help people.”\n\nMr. Kagan was president of the United Parents Association, a citywide advocacy group. He was a trustee of the West End Synagogue. And in the early 1970s he was chairman of both Community Board 7 and Combo, a committee of West Side neighborhood groups battling Westway, a project that would have extended the western shore of Manhattan with landfill, buried a new highway underneath a park and created commercial development and tens of thousands of apartments.\n\nMr. Kagan and fellow opponents railed against Westway, saying it would generate more traffic and degrade the environment; a decisive blow to the project came from concern about its impact on striped bass in the Hudson.\n\n“He encouraged the kind of honest public debate over major policy issues that is sadly lacking today,” recalled Marcy Benstock, executive director of the Clean Air Campaign, who was instrumental in defeating Westway.\n\nThe architect of Westway, Craig Whitaker, remembered one meeting with Mr. Kagan he would later tease him about. “He gave a very spirited disquisition on the evils of the private car in New York,” Mr. Whitaker said, “and when the meeting was over, he went out the door and hopped into his friend’s car, and the two of them roared off into the night.”\n\nMr. Kagan, who died in 1994, was not above the theatrical gesture. Sally Goodgold, a former chairwoman of Community Board 7, recalled the morning she got an early call from Mr. Kagan, who was determined to stop workers who had taken chainsaws to several trees in Riverside Park.\n\n“He said, ‘Get over here and bring a rope,’ ” Mrs. Goodgold said. “I only had a jump-rope. He held onto the tree and said, ‘You have no plan and no permits and you can’t take these trees down.’ I wrapped the rope around him. We didn’t know what else to do. We lost two very big trees, but that was it.”\n\nLIKE Elena, Gloria Kagan demonstrated a fierce intellect from an early age. The daughter of Russian Jewish immigrants, she graduated at 16 from Philadelphia High School for Girls, a competitive public school not unlike Hunter College High School.\n\nMrs. Kagan’s parents owned a dairy business on South Seventh Street, and the family lived on two floors above. Her mother, Esther, worked the counter, while her father, Laizar, drove a truck delivering eggs, butter and cheese to luncheonettes and markets.\n\nAs a girl, Gloria helped at the counter. “We all did — as soon as you could count,” recalled her brother, Stanley Gittelman, a dentist who lives in Philadelphia. Throughout her life, Mrs. Kagan would preach the power of education. In the classroom at Hunter College Elementary School, where she proudly displayed a poster of John F. Kennedy, she sometimes wielded that message like a club. Whether mining a David Mamet play or Shirley Jackson’s dark short story “The Lottery,” Mrs. Kagan pressed her fifth- and sixth-grade students to think harder, write more clearly.\n\n“She was a teacher who just gave so much of herself, and she expected that in return from everyone, all the time,” said Blake Eskin, 39, a former student who is now the Web editor at The New Yorker. “For the student who really rises to that expectation, it’s great. But for the student who might be a little more creative or messy, I think it was really hard.”\n\nStanley Seidman, a former principal at the school, remembers speaking to Mrs. Kagan about her occasional outbursts.\n\n“I did talk to her about calming down and told her that they are still children and have a ways to go,” said Dr. Seidman, who is now director of the private Columbia Grammar School on the Upper West Side. “In almost all cases, it wasn’t anger that was vicious. It was more her being upset with the students for not wanting to push themselves a step further.\n\n“She was a teacher we should all have once in our lives,” he added, “someone who makes a student out of you, who makes you go the extra mile.”\n\nLaura Harrington, a former student who is now a visiting scholar of religion at Boston University, recalled tackling the 1976 American bicentennial in Mrs. Kagan’s class. The students memorized the poem “Paul Revere’s Ride.” They immersed themselves in the art of the Revolution. They visited Philadelphia.\n\n“We studied the bicentennial the way medical students study the kidney — from every direction,” she said. “Her value system was to learn something: don’t fritter away your time being 12.”\n\nAt home, Mrs. Kagan, who retired in 1991 and died in 2008, apparently had a lighter touch with her own children. “She was a little more playful with her kids,” said Dr. Harrington, who was a classmate of Irving’s and a neighbor on West End Avenue. “Her kids were very driven, so she didn’t have to nag them.”\n\nIRVING Kagan earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in history at Yale, and since 1991 has been teaching at Hunter College High School, where he followed his sister as a student.\n\n(Ms. Kagan and her brothers declined to be interviewed for this article and have not spoken publicly since her nomination.)\n\nTeachers and students describe Mr. Kagan, who is 45 and teaches American history and constitutional law, as funny, knowledgeable and passionate.\n\nA former colleague, Joan Kenyon, recalled consulting him when she had doubts about one of her own lessons — drawing a parallel between Pericles’s funeral oration and Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address.\n\n“I thought maybe this is totally bogus because Lincoln had a very limited education, and who knows if he ever read the funeral oration?” Ms. Kenyon said. “Then Irv hurled this book at me and said, ‘Of course, he did. Read this Garry Wills book that just came out.’ He grew up in a family that loves batting around ideas and thought that was play.”\n\nAlex Xiao, 15, a student in Mr. Kagan’s American history course, described his kinetic classroom style. “A lot of teachers just sit down explaining things from a chair,” he said. “But he walks around the classroom and is huffing and puffing because he’s so excited.”\n\nThat energy sometimes spills over into faculty banter. “There are teachers of different political persuasions, and we’d have debates and arguments that sometimes got really heated,” said Sue Leung Eichler, a former social studies teacher. “Irving was very often one of the leaders of the liberal camp.”\n\nIn 2004, Mr. Kagan gave $600 to John Kerry, and in 2008 he made six separate contributions totaling $2,650 to the Obama campaign. (Elena Kagan gave $7,450 to various Democrats from 2000 to 2008, $4,600 of it to Mr. Obama.)\n\nToader Mateoc, a senior who took Mr. Kagan’s constitutional law course, said that he played devil’s advocate with the left-leaning students in the classroom as well as a boy who claims Robert Bork as his judicial idol.\n\n“Mr. Kagan told us that he thinks a good law class, in general, is where you can’t tell the political views of the professor afterwards, and I think he achieves that,” Mr. Mateoc said.\n\nWHILE a student at Princeton University, Elena Kagan made reference to her older brother’s “involvement in radical causes” as an inspiration for her senior thesis on the Socialist movement in New York.\n\nAfter attending two of the nation’s most exalted educational institutions, the Dalton School and Yale, Marc Kagan appeared to purposefully descend the class ladder. It was as if he needed to join the proletariat in order to raise it up.\n\nIn 1984, he became a mechanic at the 207th Street subway yard in Upper Manhattan, operating a forklift, among other responsibilities. “We did not know he was a Yale graduate,” said Joe Fernandez, a former co-worker who still works at the yard. “He was very low key.”\n\nA former colleague of Gloria Kagan’s, Robert E. Mason IV, said that “she was wondering how long he would do that.”\n\nMr. Kagan’s union involvement grew during the 1990s, and he joined a movement called New Directions that was challenging the leadership of the Transport Workers Union local. When one of its leaders, Roger Toussaint, was elected union president in 2000, Mr. Kagan became his special assistant, or chief of staff.\n\nBut Mr. Kagan, now 53, had misgivings about the 2002 contract that he had helped negotiate, said Alan Saly, director of publications for the local, and he let some of his former co-workers know it. Among other issues, he objected to the fact that the contract relied on a bonus of $1,000 in the third year, rather than a raise, so it would not count toward workers’ pensions or future salary increases.\n\nMr. Kagan was fired from the union, as were several associates. “Roger didn’t like dissent,” said Mr. Saly, who was later forced out himself by Mr. Toussaint, only to return. “His opinion was that a deal is a deal and you should get behind it.”\n\nMr. Toussaint, who now works for the national transit workers’ union, denied that Mr. Kagan’s departure was related to “issues or differences around the contract,” but he would not elaborate, citing the family’s privacy. Mr. Kagan, who had married his Yale sweetheart, LeeAnn Graham, and has two children, became a teacher, working at A. Philip Randolph Campus High School in Harlem before moving to the prestigious Bronx High School of Science.\n\nStudents say he is devoted and demanding in his course on world history, which spans 8,000 years. Mohammad Nauman, a senior, recalled Mr. Kagan trying to find ways to energize the class, like ordering students to run up and down stairs when they studied the concept of horsepower.\n\nBut others, like Aja Colon, a 16-year-old junior, saw a stricter side of Mr. Kagan, who also serves as a disciplinary dean. During an event last fall called Freshmen Fridays, Mr. Kagan tore stickers off students’ shirts that bore labels like “fresh meat” and other inappropriate phrases. “He yells,” Ms. Colon said. “He definitely yells. He’s a fan of that.”\n\nMr. Kagan has also pressed the Bronx Science administration to make sure teachers have time for professional development, said a colleague, Gary Hom, a physics teacher who described Mr. Kagan as “always on the side of teachers.”\n\nThis spring, in a letter to The Chief-Leader, a civil service employees’ newspaper, Mr. Kagan compared the attempts by Joel I. Klein, the schools chancellor, to end teacher seniority protections to Goldman Sachs’s alleged misdeeds. The letter had the crusading, poetic feel of a lawyer making closing arguments.\n\n“It’s morally and ethically wrong to take away the jobs of people who have worked hard for decades simply because a cheaper body can be found,” he wrote. “It is a spiritual pollution of the values that we should uphold. It is another step away from civilized behavior toward the idea that only might makes right.”"
