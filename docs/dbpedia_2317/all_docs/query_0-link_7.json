        "text": "We are very pleased with our first year at Thomas Jefferson. Our family has lived in many cities around the country and have always made top notch schools a priority when choosing a place to live. Our older children all went to public schools and have gone on to earn scholarships at private universities. We have one elementary school aged daughter left at home, and TJ is our first venture into private schools. When schools were shut down during covid our daughter developed some speech issues and struggled with reading. Her teacher at TJ noticed this and offered our little girl the opportunity to stay after school one day a week to work on reading with a high school \"Big Sister\". Our daughter not only caught up to her peers but developed a new love for reading. The small class size, professional teachers, and extreme focus on academic excellence allows teachers to catch issues before they become problems.At a small private school in a small town, you would expect things to be cliquish. There are definitely people with long established friendships, but everyone has been very welcoming and kind to us. It truly is a community approach to schooling. Parents are welcomed to be involved and there are several family focused events. If you want an academic experience for your children that is personalized and focused on helping them reach their full potential, I highly recommend checking out Thomas Jefferson.\n\nParent Review\n\n1y ago"
