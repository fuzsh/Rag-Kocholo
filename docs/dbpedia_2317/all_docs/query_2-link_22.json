The Tri-State Marker is a quick adventure and a one-of-a-kind experience. Be sure to bring your camera to catch the special moment when you are in multiple places at the same time.

The Four Corners Monument allows you to be in Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico all at the same time. 3 corners states or 4 corners states- you can't go wrong with having stood in multiple states at once!\n\nA visit to the marker doesn't take long, but the actual work to identify the spot where the three states converge took a massive effort.\n\nA group of 800 individuals - ranging from soldiers to surveyors - set off on an expedition in 1857 to find the tri-state point.\n\nOver a six-month period, the group traveled 40 miles on foot, facing a variety of difficulties along the way. The group had to contend with rocky and rough terrain as well as high water.\n\nThe spot, where the states meet, was eventually marked by a stone structure, built by the National Youth Administration in 1938.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nYou'll also see a plaque that tells the stories of the tri-state marker.\n\nThe 3 State Marker is conveniently located at the end of a dead-end road.

While around 55% of the population resides in the Kansas City and St. Louis areas, the other 45% live scattered across the state in countless quaint small towns, each offering unique experiences. One such hidden gem is the small town of Bowling Green, Missouri, a delightful destination for those who appreciate great food, charming shops, the great outdoors, and a slower pace of life.\n\nadvertisement\n\nCheck out a few of our favorite places to visit:\n\nMid-Missouri is home to several Amish communities, including the one in Bowling Green, which has been thriving since the 1940s.

Bankhead’s Candies hours vary seasonally, so check out the website before you visit.\n\nI'll take one of everything!\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nBowling Green is known for livestock and agricultural roots. At award-winning Woods Smoked Meats, you can find local proteins to cooking yourself or grab some takeout.

You can visit State Senator Champ Clark’s home by appointment.\n\nNature lovers will find plenty to enjoy in and around Bowling Green. The city maintains two beautiful 40-acre lakes: Jack Floyd Memorial Lake, which features a fishing and boat dock, and West Lake, perfect for canoeing and fishing, with BBQ pits, hiking trails, and primitive camping spots.
