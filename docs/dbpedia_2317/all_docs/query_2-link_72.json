        "text": "Route 66 across Missouri stretched 317 miles and connected a variety of large cities and small towns, traversing rolling hills and valleys.\n\nThe Mother Road followed much of the Kickapoo, or Osage, Trail, an Indian trail that later became the Old Wire Road.\n\nLike other Route 66 segments, the actual alignment varied over the years as engineering improvements were constructed.\n\nWe've driven much of Route 66, including multiple segments across Missouri, and visits to Joplin.\n\nRoute 66 Mural Park\n\nShown here is the mural in downtown Joplin, Missouri at Pearl Brothers Hardware Store. This is only one of many murals painted throughout the downtown area.\n\nThe Route 66 Mural Park in Joplin features two nostalgic murals and an oversized 45-record imprint of \"Get Your Kicks on Route 66\". The upper mural is called \"Cruisinâ into Joplin\", and showing a vintage Buick arriving in Joplin on Route 66 from the west.\n\nThe lower mural is calledÂ \"The American Ribbon\", tracing the route of the Mother Road from Chicago to Los Angeles. Jutting out in three dimensions from the mural is a mock 1964 red Chevrolet Corvette. This is a favorite stop for Rouge 66 travelers in Missouri for photo-ops! The mural is located at 619 S. Main Street in Joplin.\n\nGrand Falls\n\nKnown as the largest continuously flowing natural waterfall in Missouri, Grand Falls is a must-stop-photo-op for visitors. Located on Shoal Creek, just a few minutes downstream from Wildcat Park, âThe Fallsâ plunges 12 feet down a 163-foot-wide ledge of solid chert before crashing into jagged crags and then flowing peacefully to the south.\n\nThe falls are located at 5400 South Riverside Drive Joplin, MO 64804\n\nI-44 East Welcome Center\n\nThis official Missouri Welcome Center is located at Interstate I-44 East, Mile Marker 2. Visitors will find tourism brochures, maps and highway information, and a very knowledgeable staff. They will answer tourism related questions, provide driving directions to attractions, and offer suggestions on what to see and do in Joplin and throughout Missouri.\n\nPicnic facilities, a playground,Â vending machines and pet walking areas are available. And don't miss a photo-op at the \"license plate wall\"!\n\n\"Butterfly Effect: Dreams Take Flight\" Mural\n\nShortly after an EF5 tornado demolished many structures in Joplin in 2011, a sign of hope appeared on one building that had withstood the storm. More than 300 community volunteers came together to help award-winning muralist Dave Lowenstein paint an image of beauty amid the brokenness, a message of optimism for the city’s future.\n\nA quote from Joplin native Langston Hughes is included in the mural: “In time of silver rain the butterflies lift silken wings to catch a rainbow sky and trees put forth new leaves to sing in joy beneath the sky.”\n\nThe mural is located at the northwest corner of 15th and Main Streets. Read about the many other Joplin murals at the Visit Joplin Website.\n\nThe Praying Hands Memorial\n\nThe Memorial was sculpted over a period of several years by local artist J.E. \"Jack\" Dawson, and dedicated in April of 1974. Its size is impressive: 220,000 pounds of steel and concrete, 32 feet high, sitting on top of a 40-foot-high man-made hill. Carved in stone in front of the statue are six simple words: âHands in prayer. World in peace.â\n\nEach year, thousands of visitors and locals visit the giant hands. The Memorial is located in King Jack Park, on Dawson Drive, in Webb City, in northeast Joplin not far off Route 66. Free and open to the public.\n\nWe have included below a sampling of our collection of vintage travel postcards dealing with Joplin and Route 66.\n\nWhat was Route 66 like in its earlier years, as visitors drove around Joplin? What did all the service stations, motels and public buildings look like when they were new?\n\nWhat did the traveling public experience on the Mother Road? We wonder such things when we travel Route 66 today.\n\nThose earlier times in the 1930s, 40s and 50s were not always captured on film. But the use of colorful postcards was common in those decades.\n\nThese portray the historic road in its prime and help us to visualize, and appreciate, \"earlier times\" as we drive Route 66 today in Joplin."
