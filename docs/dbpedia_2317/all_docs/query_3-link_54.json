        "text": "Created by the 1st class in 1958\n\nExplanation of the symbolism of the\n\nMcAuley High School Coat of Arms (Shield)...\n\nThe following article was written in 1959 by Joanne Martin, freshman, for the \"Our Memory Book\" celebrating the end of the first year of McAuley, 1958-1959.\n\nMcAuley High School Coat of Arms (Shield)\n\nand Motto\n\nThe general overall shape of this coat of arms has been taken from the McAuley Family Coat of Arms. At the direct top, is a Maltese cross, recalling the one that appears on the Sisters of Mercy Shield. The seven rays of green with the seven rays of gold, which were suggested by the Mercy Shield, symbolize the seven spiritual and corporal works of Mercy flowing through the school and throughout the Diocese of Toledo.\n\nThe upper left hand corner contains a sector, or a castle, done in red and blue. This is the authentic design and colors of the Toledo Diocese.\n\nThe lower right hand corner of red and silver contains a lion rampant which symbolizes our readiness to ward off all evils and eagerness to stand for what is right. These are the authentic colors and design of the McAuley Family Coat of Arms.\n\nThe motto \"INVERITATIS AMORE\" was suggested by our Most Reverend Bishop George J Rehring and is taken from the Collect of the Mass for St. Robert Bellarmine. St Robert Bellarmine, whose Feast Day is May 13th, is a noted scholar and Doctor of the Church. The motto, \"IN VERITATIS AMORE\", when translated means, IN THE LOVE OF TRUTH.\n\nResearch and designing of this coat of arms was done by Sister Mary Genevieve Burkett, R.S.M.\n\n(Sister also designed the art department of the school.)\n\nClass Ring - What does it Mean?\n\nThe maltese cross is taken from the Mercy shield, adapted by Catherine McAuley, foundress of the Sisters of Mercy, from the shield of the Fathers of Mercy, an order founded in the 1200's for the deliverance of captives in the Crusades.\n\nThe 7 gold bars reflect the spiritual and corporal works of Mercy. The \"M\" stands for the name of the school, and theemerald stone signifies the virtue of hope as well as the Emerald Isle (Ireland) on which Catherine McAuley lived.\n\nThe ring was designed by Sister Mary Genevieve Burkett.\n\n(Taken from the Spring, 2001 Volume 6 issue of the McAuley Alumnae Newsletter)"
