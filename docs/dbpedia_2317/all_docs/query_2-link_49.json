        "text": "Also of interest is that Joplin has more people living here who work in computers and math than 95% of the places in the US.\n\nA relatively large number of people in Joplin telecommute to their jobs. Overall, about 7.35% of the workforce works from home. While this may seem like a small number, as a fraction of the total workforce it ranks among the highest in the country. These workers are often telecommuters who work in knowledge-based, white-collar professions. For example, Silicon Valley has large numbers of people who telecommute. Other at-home workers may be self-employed people who operate small businesses out of their homes.\n\nOne of the benefits of Joplin is that there is very little traffic. The average commute to work is 18.25 minutes, which is substantially less than the national average. Not only does this mean that the drive to work is less aggravating, but noise and pollution levels are lower as a result.\n\nThe percentage of people in Joplin who are college-educated is somewhat higher than the average US community of 21.84%: 25.74% of adults in Joplin have at least a bachelor's degree.\n\nThe per capita income in Joplin in 2022 was $29,295, which is upper middle income relative to Missouri, and lower middle income relative to the rest of the US. This equates to an annual income of $117,180 for a family of four. However, Joplin contains both very wealthy and poor people as well.\n\nJoplin is a somewhat ethnically-diverse city. The people who call Joplin home describe themselves as belonging to a variety of racial and ethnic groups. The greatest number of Joplin residents report their race to be White, followed by Black or African-American. Important ancestries of people in Joplin include German, Irish, English, Scottish, and French.\n\nThe most common language spoken in Joplin is English. Other important languages spoken here include Spanish and Polish."
