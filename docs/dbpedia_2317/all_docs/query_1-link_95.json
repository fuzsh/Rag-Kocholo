        "text": "JOPLIN, Mo. — The upcoming Super Bowl gives students at McAuley Catholic High School a reason to relax and celebrate.\n\nAs part of the run up to the game, these students have been celebrating the Chiefs all week, with days like “Mahomes Monday,” and “Travis Tuesday.”\n\nSome students, like freshman Michael Walker showed off custom Chief’s gear, while others celebrated their favorite high-profile romances.\n\nSchool Principal Dr. Stephen Gilbreth says because the school normally requires students to wear a uniform, the relaxed nature of the week lead to high participation.\n\n“Most kids don’t complain about it, but I know they really appreciate it when we can have a day that they don’t have to do it, so, you know, it’s a celebration. An incredible group of kids, and we try to do fun things for them when we can,” said Principal Gilbreth.\n\n“I really like showing off this jersey because I’m proud of it, but also it’s a Friday, and you can’t be upset on a Friday,” said McAuley freshmen, Michael Walker.\n\nGilbreth says with last week being “National Catholic Schools Week,” this week allowed them to continue the celebration of their students."
