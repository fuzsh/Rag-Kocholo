        "text": "McAuley Catholic High School (Joplin, Missouri)\n\nAppearance move to sidebar hide\n\nMcAuley Catholic High School is a private, parochial school in Joplin, Missouri. It is located in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Springfield-Cape Girardeau. It is a regional high school serving Joplin and the surrounding communities. McAuley is a 4 year high school with an enrollment of approximately 70 students. It is accredited by the Missouri Association for Accreditation of Non-Public Schools.\n\nBackground\n\nMcAuley Catholic High School was established in 1885. The school has celebrated over 135 years of Catholic education in the Joplin area.\n\nRecent Changes\n\nThe school was forced to convert their nearby storage building into the replacement elementary school over the summer of 2011 as the original was destroyed in a tornado on May 22, 2011. In 2016 the building was used for St. Peter's Middle School as St. Mary's Elementary school has built a new building at 3025 S Central City Rd, Joplin, MO 64804. In 2021, St. Peter's Middle School was moved to the building of McAuley High School.\n\nNotable alumni\n\nRon Richard (1965) Speaker of the Missouri House of Representatives\n\nC. W.
