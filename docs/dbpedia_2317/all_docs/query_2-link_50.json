        "meta_description": "1 review and 9 photos of CITY OF JOPLIN \"At the beginning of the race I was Joplin for position. But now I'm just glad to still be in the race.\n\nA very long time ago I had a very good friend in Joplin. He arranged for me to play my first concert in the city and it seems like the whole town showed up. Afterwards I spent part of the night canoodling with a beautiful spectacular girl who I still think about to this day. It was one of those magical nights and I have never forgotten it.\n\nNot long after my visit my friend passed away. It's very confusing and complicated but it was ruled a suicide. It was pretty grisly and horrible. I still have good friends that live here but there is a shadow over the town and my heart ever since.\n\nThen a couple of months later a devastating tornado wiped out a huge portion of the town and caused many casualties.\n\nThere will always be a special place in my heart for Joplin and someday I look forward to my return.\"",
