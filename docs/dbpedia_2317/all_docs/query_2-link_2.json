        "text": "Joplin, city, Jasper and Newton counties, in the Ozark region of southwestern Missouri, U.S. It lies adjacent to Webb City, near the Kansas and Oklahoma borders. It was settled about 1840 by Tennessean John Cox, who named it for his friend Harris Joplin, a Methodist missionary who was also an early settler. The discovery of lead and zinc ores in the area in the mid-1800s brought prosperity, and in 1873 Joplin merged with Murphysburg. When the mining boom collapsed in the 1930s, other industries were developed.\n\nNow a shipping and trade center for the area’s farm products, Joplin also has diversified manufactures, including chemicals, precision bearings, truck bodies, and asphalt roofing products. The city is the seat of Missouri Southern State University (1937) and Ozark Christian College (1942). The Joplin school system received national recognition for the Joplin reading plan, an innovative program for the teaching of reading that was instituted in the 1950s and that was designed to improve skills in the elementary grades. The Joplin Museum Complex includes the Tri-State Mineral Museum and the Dorothea B. Hoover Historical Museum, which displays items from Joplin’s mining era. George Washington Carver National Monument (1943), immediately southeast, preserves the birthplace of the eminent agricultural scientist. The poet Langston Hughes was born in Joplin about 1902. Prairie State Park is 25 miles (40 km) to the north."
