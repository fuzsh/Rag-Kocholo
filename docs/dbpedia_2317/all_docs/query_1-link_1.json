It is located in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Springfield-Cape Girardeau. It is a regional high school serving Joplin and the surrounding communities. McAuley is a 4 year high school with an enrollment of approximately 70 students.

In 2016 the building was used for St. Peter's Middle School as St. Mary's Elementary school has built a new building at 3025 S Central City Rd, Joplin, MO 64804. In 2021, St. Peter's Middle School was moved to the building of McAuley High School. [3]\n\nNotable alumni\n\n[edit]\n\nRon Richard (1965) Speaker of the Missouri House of Representatives\n\nC. W. Moss (2006) Author and illustrator of \"Unicorn Being a Jerk\"\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
