        "text": "This charming book is one of the most complete photographic records of Joplin, Missouri, at the beginning of a new century. By 1900, Joplin had become a city of both millionaires and miners and was certainly one of the most important cities in Missouri. Some of the millionaires had actually begun their lives as miners and had struck it rich in the lead and zinc deposits in the area. The 125 photographs include more than three dozen pictures of the private homes of these self-made men.\n\nAlso included are scores of photographs of the businesses and industries that had sprung up to support the mining industry and the miners.\n\nThe introduction was written by Joel Livingston, a resident of Joplin who went on to write the mammoth History of Jasper County Missouri and Its People in 1912."
