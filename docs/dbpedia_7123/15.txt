The 3.32-kilometre stretch, connecting Kirti Nagar and Ashok Park, was thrown open for public on Saturday, putting an end to the construction of Delhi Metro's phase II.

Delhi Metro now boasts of seven corridors spanning 190 km, with 145 stations and a ridership of almost two million.

The Kirti Nagar - Ashok Park stretch, which connects the Inderlok-Mundka line and Noida-Dwarka corridor, was inaugurated by Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit on Saturday morning. The corridor was thrown open for general public later in the day.

According to Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) officials, the new stretch will slash fares and cut down travelling time for a large number of daily commuters. The DMRC expects immediate addition of about 40,000 new passengers with the opening of this section. The Metro officials said this small stretch will also help DMRC achieve its target of ferrying two million people everyday by the end of 2011.

The Ashok Park Main and Kirti Nagar Metro stations will now act as interchange points to go towards Noida, Anand Vihar, Dilshad Garden, Mundka and Rithala on three different lines.

Now, the new stretch will help decongest the heavily busy Rajiv Chowk and Kashmere Gate interchange stations.
