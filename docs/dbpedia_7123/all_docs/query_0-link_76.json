Young men call out place-names for destinations all across the Haryana state border. Cow dung patties dry in the sun to one side of the station escalator; jagged lines of cars and buses jostle on the other. Half-built Metro stanchions leading to future stations rise up in the distance. Leaving Mundka, Raveena, a slim woman in her twenties, gets on the women-only coach of the Metro. We start to chat, and she tells me that her father drops her off and picks her up at the station each day. She takes the Metro a few stops eastward to Paschim Vihar to attend college. She is certain that she would not be on the Metro at all if it were not for “the ladies’ coach.” “After Mundka, it’s good,” she says, “but before Mundka, it’s very bad, the crowd and all.” For Raveena, “crowd” is about place, about where you are from and the attitudes you may hold. It is an imagined likeness and social reality but perhaps more a public than an actual crowd. It is also, of course, a manner of speaking. “Haryana is not good, not good for girls. Men are not good, even boys. They stare at me, sometimes they vent at me. I can’t do anything,” she explains. “Vent” is typical Delhi-speak to describe when someone lashes 1\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nout in a stream of verbal abuse erupting like a volcano. On the street they see her as a species rather than a person. What are they angry about? That she is a girl in public, that she moves with confidence, that she is protected, that she studies, that they don’t have girlfriends, that they don’t have jobs, that, ironically enough, there aren’t more women around. On the Metro, the crowd is simply more “neutral,” Raveena says, and I also see that it allows her to imagine, and perhaps enact, a future beyond it.1 Delhi has been notorious as a place where women not only get harassed on the street but also may be subjected to the grisliest of crimes. These stories and statistics feed into a larger narrative about girls’ and women’s safety and their proper place in the city (usually at home).2 The safety discourse teaches women from a young age that it is their fault if anything happens to them and that they need male protectors and guardians to get through life—and public space. And yet on the streets and lanes of Delhi, you see women everywhere; they have places to go and things to do, from moving bricks at construction sites to leading the city as top-ranking public officials. As state-sponsored infrastructure, the Delhi Metro has given women in particular a new way into the city, as a site of purpose, aspiration, and pleasure. One out of four Metro riders is female, which is similar to the percentage of women who work outside the home in India.3 As a street-level ethnographic view of the city, this book documents women and men in public places: how people flow into and out of trains and the new embodied experience of that flow; how they melt into the crowds yet emerge with individual experiences; how urban life comes to be narrated through the Metro. It recounts diverse experiences of the city and especially reveals what becomes visible through female gazes. The arrival of the Delhi Metro—an ultra-modern, high-tech, and highly surveilled urban rail system, and South Asia’s first large-scale, multiline metro—has become a touchstone for discussions of urban development, gendered social mobility, and India’s increasingly aspirational culture. The Metro is also a set of places and a facet of everyday urban life. Even though it shares many of the same features and feel of metro and subway systems around the world, the Metro is forced to take up the city as much as it overlays its own concreteness on it. Inside the trains, many of the social meanings and distinctions of Delhi society are transported and sometimes transformed. The Metro may be a highly regulated system, and its riders\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nmay have specific purposes and destinations in mind, but it is also a new concentration of strangers in an expansive social space where people are learning new things about their own desires. At the peripheral edges of the city, where the Metro meets more rural sensibilities, ideas of the urban are created and contested. The first line of the Delhi Metro, the Red Line, opened on December 24, 2002. Since then eight more lines (Yellow, Blue, Green, Violet, Orange, Magenta, Pink, Grey) and a total of 285 stations (and counting) have been built over three construction phases. A fourth phase is currently underway. The Metro covers close to 400 kilometers of Delhi’s National Capital Region, extending into the states of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, making it one of the largest urban rail networks in the world. With the now ubiquitous Delhi Metro map, the system offers a new and dominant paradigm for thinking about and traveling across the city. Both a visual rhetoric and abstraction of space, the map is part of the new surveillance that comes with the system. It orders the city not only for Metro riding but for governing as well.4 And yet the Metro also unleashes a web of connections—social, economic, political—that are difficult to map or pin down. The system represents solidity and the mastery of time over space, even as it operates in a fluid, circulatory manner. It is a built environment and a moving one. • I first got on the Metro in 2006 at Central Secretariat station near India Gate, which was as far south as the Yellow Line went at the time. The train tilted and turned through dark tunnels. Inside it was like any metro system in the world: bright lights, sleek flooring, and the rhythmic sound of sliding doors. Announcers on the PA system spoke in Hindi and English to remind you about the gap. Known places—Chawri Bazar, Chandni Chowk, Kashmere Gate—became destinations newly lined up and ordered.5 Unknown places become names on the Metro map, possibilities of knowing, of going to, of reaching like never before. It felt like a revelation. Seven stops later, at Civil Lines, I exited through a glass cube-like station. The trip felt more like a ride; it almost didn’t matter where I was going. I was, like so many in the city, a first timer, a joyrider.\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nFigure 1. Civil Lines station, Yellow Line, 2006.\n\nFor some Dilliwalas, or Delhiites, the novelty of riding the Metro came from the fact that it was in India, and they could compare it to what they had only ever experienced abroad, in cities like London or Singapore. For most in the city, it was their first experience of high-speed underground rail travel. For still others, it was the first time they had ridden an escalator. For all, the system had rearranged city space and their experience of time. In this solid state-of-the-art structure, a new form of fleetingness took shape, a multitude of instances, a moving city. Delhi is a desert city in a bowl, in the vast Indo-Gangetic Plain. The Aravalli mountain range lies to the southwest of the city, gaining stature as it breaks away from the Ridge, a monkey-filled, forested area in north Delhi where people stroll in the mornings and evenings, sticks in hand. With the Ridge and the city’s many parks and green spaces, Delhi can feel both lush and dry depending on the season and where you are in the city. Delhi has the largest square acreage of any city in India, incorporating villages and wildlife, as well as diverse sensibilities, from rural mind-sets\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nto middle-class aspirations and globalized consumerism. The Metro joins and cuts across these spaces. Delhi has a population of twenty million, but it is not a crowded city in the way that Mumbai, Hong Kong, and New York are. Or at least it doesn’t feel that way. It’s not bounded by oceans or bays but rather crossed by a dwindling river, the Yamuna, that cuts through the city instead of creating a border around it. The city is spread out. And it keeps going. It has no natural limit, only other cities at its far perimeters—Gurugram (formerly Gurgaon), Ghaziabad, Noida, Faridabad, Bahadurgarh, and Sonipat.6 Landlocked, Delhi has always been at the crossroads of cultures and commerce as well as ideas and beliefs. Yet modern narratives of the city tend toward the historical, focusing on the 1857 war of independence from the British, the 1911 establishment of the colonial capital, and the range of events related to the Indian nationalist, anticolonial movement, leading to the nation’s independence and the partition of the subcontinent in 1947. While informed and often moved by the historical, my curiosity about Delhi was spurred by what I was seeing and experiencing in the here and now and the everyday, a large part of which related to getting around. The Delhi Metro has not only given new shape and definition to the ever-expanding megacity but also gives Dilliwalas themselves a greater awareness of those who live, and work in, and depend on it. Those who rush by and those absorbing the atmosphere at a slower pace, sitting on staircases, strolling to cafés, waiting on platforms. The different modes and paces I noticed across stations and hubs in my anthropology of the city enabled me to see the Metro as a place for transit and flânerie. And to see, at this intersection of concrete and crowds, how the Metro spurs new forms of sociality in the city. The Metro is a distinctive space, and it is also a set of new spatial dynamics and coordinates that reframe social life and the image of the city. A system in a set of linked, enclosed spaces, the Metro provides a kind of cohesiveness, even if it is illusory. These new pathways set the stage for repeated journeys, a deepening of grooves, the city as map, picture, place. The central areas of Delhi have always been for the rich or powerful— politicians, bureaucrats, lawyers, and the like. These areas form an elite geography cordoned off by large roadways and roundabouts, big bungalows and imposing monuments. On the streets you see hawkers and\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\noffice workers, but it’s clear they are there to do the bidding of the more powerful. Older market areas like Karol Bagh or the lanes off Chandni Chowk in the old city are markedly different in that they teem with people, activity, and a vast array of specialized markets for spices, paper, cloth, and electronics—domains far removed from the office crowd. The Metro connects these two worlds: the older markets and the newer malls and offices. Riding it can be a revelation for not only who you see—the people, the crowds—but also how they connect to different parts of the city and the new cultural geographies that are laid bare.7 Delhi’s most recognizable public spaces have long been its monuments, not just for their historical value or sublime architecture but for the kind of places they are in the everyday life of the city.8 In most cases these are people-friendly places for all classes, ones that allure and create publics: the central vista from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate to Purana Qila, Lodi Gardens, Jantar Mantar, Jama Masjid, Akshardham Temple, the memorial ghats on the Yamuna River, as well as more practical spaces for large public gatherings and conventions such as Ramlila Maidan and Pragati Maidan. I would add the Delhi Metro to this list, for it is not only the single largest set of public spaces in the city, a place to be as much as to journey through, but also a zone that is carefully managed by the state. It adds to the city’s image as it connects existing structures and reframes them by overlaying its own structure on what was already there. The system has both a singular impact and an all-encompassing “renewing” effect on the urban landscape.9 In India, where urban transport is a site of status and contestation, the Metro is a place where “the people” come to be defined and molded. This kind of place is significant in the liberalized era, where public space has been shrinking as there are more and more paid social spaces in the city, from restaurants and eating parks to gardens and malls. These experienceheavy destinations aim at making Delhi more global and more exclusive. The Metro offers a new grid and key to the city. Its platforms and stations provide a sense of certainty in a city where traffic times are hard to predict, and other forms of transport are not always reliable. There is a bus system but not enough buses. There are auto rickshaws and taxis, but you have to find one and then fix a price with the driver. Phone apps such as Ola Cabs and Uber have changed the taxi landscape, but even\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nwith global positioning systems, you often still have to negotiate last-mile directions: they still have to find you. My interest in Delhi’s Metro stems from what I saw as a seismic shift in how the city was being experienced and perceived from the late 2000s. I was living and commuting in Delhi at the time and taking the Metro most days. The Metro wasn’t an integrated system then; it was in a state of becoming. It was the recognizable high-tech system you see in other cities, just as clean and ordered, often more so, just as fast and efficient; but outside, the seams were still showing where the stations and the city met. I came to think of these seams as the interface between the city and the Metro, a system which I soon learned was built as a stand-alone artifact. To become an effective metro system, I also knew that the Metro would have to be integrated with “the city”—its roads, its people, and its other forms of transit (buses, vans, jeeps, cycle rickshaws, auto rickshaws, taxis). In a highly developed and densely populated city like Delhi, this process was both exciting and unnerving to watch. I started to contemplate the nature of “the urban” and to ask: When will these seams dissolve? And what is at stake in this transformation, this integration? I used ethnographic research methods to study the Metro, meaning I rode the trains as much as I could, on all lines and to all stations, clocking over four thousand hours in all. I observed, interacted with, and talked to people on trains, at stations, and around stations, once I got over the strangeness of talking to strangers on public transport. Going around the city in this way helped me to focus on it as a gendered space; for instance, the way darkness signals when women should not be on the streets. In this case, the Metro’s bright lights counter this gendered assumption and practice, since it’s always daytime in the system; and in fact, many women told me that the Metro is the only form of public transport they feel is a legitimate urban space for them at night. But space is not only a physical location or set of coordinates; it is also a sense of possibility, a mental pose, a kind of social permission.10 I also interviewed a range of Metro officials, planners, architects, bureaucrats, and politicians, usually in their offices or home offices. Moving between the spaces of transit and the office spaces of people planning transit, I found both connection and disconnection. •\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Metro began as a management structure in the form of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, or DMRC, set up in 1995. The DMRC is a half central government of India, half Delhi state government agency that built and manages the system; it is a management company and brand that links to five hundred private contractors. The Delhi Metro is an example of the public-private partnerships and transnational capital flows of the neoliberalized era. The system is a space produced by those flows. The majority of its workers are nonunionized and contractual, even as they have safer working conditions compared to other major construction sites in the country. In India this era was launched by the liberalization reforms of the Indian economy from the late 1980s onward. The Metro has become emblematic of the new kinds of social mobility people imagine and plan for in this new economy. In this way, Delhi’s urbanism speaks to the future as much as, if not more than, the grand cities of industrial modernity such as Paris, London, and New York.11 This future includes the pleasures and powers of rising, consumerist middle classes, ethical questions around modernity and sustainable development, and the persistent inequalities of living, gulfs really, that point directly to the control of resources and infrastructures. Even though the Metro only accounts for 5 percent of individual trips in the city (the majority are by bus, followed by motorcycles, scooters, taxis, and cars), the Metro’s expansive network of stations and viaducts drives the city’s property development and is a new site for the production of dreams, tastes, and desires. The Metro is not reducible to the new middle-class consumer culture in the way that shopping malls or gated communities might be; it is a more complex and multifarious urban space.12 Nonetheless, the Metro is most definitely a class-making space and an example of aspirational infrastructure for its three million daily riders.13 The Metro offers a globally identifiable, middle-class experience, with its visible high technology, quick commuting times, and comfortable, climate-controlled ride, that is both everyday and embodied. The globalized aspect of a transnationally produced infrastructure elevates its aspirational quality. The Metro carries the moral dimension of middleclassness in terms of how one should behave but also what one should be aspiring to: certain kinds of jobs, education, and lifestyles.14 Many see the Metro as an effective social leveler precisely because of the rules that\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\npeople must follow to ride it. The implication in some of the discourse on the Metro is that the “unruly” and “unwashed” laboring classes will have to reform in order to blend in while riding the Metro. So the system is a social leveler by offering a relatively low-cost access to urban space and a new way to perform and be in that space. However, as urban infrastructure, the system creates more inequality by determining future property values and the city’s financial obligations for its ongoing maintenance and operation. The system transforms urban space, and also takes up a lot of space with its stations, tracks, and viaducts, as well as offices, warehouses, workshops, plants, machineries, sheds, and depots—all fixed to the landscape. The system as a material object expands its own space of profit as a property developer, with kiosks, shopping malls, and thirty-year lease commercial and residential developments, as a way to pay for the Metro along with passenger fares. It is a capital project more than a people project, and its meaning and symbolic value lie in the contradictions inherent in this dual role.15 Delhi’s Metro was made with enormous political will behind it; it is a joint venture between the Indian and Japanese governments, the latter of which supported 65 percent of the Metro construction in the form of loans. As one Metro consultant put it to me, “The Japanese have chosen to invest in India in a major way, whereas before they avoided it. Now it is ‘less China, more India,’ which reflects their political interests and history.” The Metro is in fact one of many infrastructure projects funded by the Japanese across India. It is perhaps the shiniest and most “peoplefacing,” but one where the viability of the project is not and was never up for public debate. The Metro comes under the auspices of the central government’s Ministry of Urban Development and operates under the Metro Act of 2002, giving it powers to acquire, hold, dispose of, improve, develop, and alter all kinds of properties and assets.16 A metro system is the kind of infrastructure that creates a new relationship and promise between governments on the one hand and with ordinary citizens on the other. These citizens are “stakeholders” in the world of infrastructural finance schemes. Throughout this book I highlight instances of this citizen-state relationship (one of capital and knowledge flows) and the new kinds of “Metro publics” (new forms of citizenship) that emerge. In an era where the idea\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\nand practice of citizenship is being hotly contested and fought over in the streets, a study of urban citizenship in the space of public transit points to the everyday, often slight, nuances of belonging and not belonging.17 The Moving City is not a historical narrative of the Metro’s making but rather an examination of points of connection between grand-scale planning and the thinking behind it, and the daily movements and activity of Metro commuters. How do people’s miniature expanses—of thought, experience—connect to the mega-ness of public transport? What do people see through the innumerable new frames on the city the Metro provides, through station exits and entrances and windows in every coach? What does all this seeing do? An anthropological approach to a metro system sees it as infrastructure—a physical network enabling transport—but sees infrastructure as more than the function it serves. Infrastructure is a “collective fantasy” that both reveals a particular constitution of the political and addresses a new set of publics. Infrastructures put matter, substances, and people in motion and in relation. High-speed urban rail transport—both a hallmark of the industrial age and a contemporary symbol of globalized culture and transnationally produced mega-infrastructure—is nothing if not a statement of social and technological change in the form of new habits and ways of being and thinking.18 This book is a consideration of what it means to study the urban in a twenty-first-century megacity—the kinds of crowds and compressions, expansions and possibilities, visibilities and invisibilities that come to the fore. The more I rode the trains and visited stations, the more Metro officials I talked to, and the more commuters I interacted with, the more I came to see that to understand the Metro’s social impact was to see how the particular and the individual related to the whole (“the whole” being the Metro system but also the city of Delhi); how the system and ideas about the system impacted each station and each journey; how people were making individual journeys but also understanding their city and themselves in a new way. I was struck by the relatedness and connections on the Metro but also by its randomness and anonymity. The Metro as a system both draws in (people, places, ideas) and doles out (its own systematics). To match what I was seeing, my research became radically multisited\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nwithin a single city. To exit a station, reenter it, and go back from where I had come, if I so desired. To make triangular journeys in the city or quadrangular ones. To crisscross it and pass by hundreds of people at a time, in seas and waves and trickles. I gave in to my own randomized itineraries and embraced the contingencies of the ethnographic on an urban scale. At the same time, I started to connect diverse places (Metro stations as well as places where Metro riders told me they were coming from) with people’s everyday experiences and ideas. And I started to see the growth of existing lines not only in terms of construction but also in terms of the changing idea of the urban in Delhi—from the perspective of those living in the city, people planning the city, and also those coming into the city. The connective thread of my study and this book is the Metro in all its concreteness (trains, viaducts, stations) but also in its symbolics: what it means and represents as a global emblem of technological modernity and a master urban plan. The Delhi Metro is also one of the few spaces in the city, and certainly the largest, that offers a measure of equal access across many lines of social division. It is one of the cheapest metros in the world to ride, with one-way fares ranging by distance from 10 to 60 rupees (14 to 84 cents), in a city where the per capita monthly income is 25,256 rupees (334 USD), but where nearly a quarter of the population lives below the poverty line.19 The Metro is a space where no one technically benefits from having a higher social or economic status, even if riding it does not erase what people feel inside (though at times it might do that); it is a space where social differences subside from ticket entry point to exit gate. It is an accessible space in a highly uneven city, uneven in terms of one’s footing on the road and one’s social status. This semblance of equal access makes the Metro an especially potent symbol in a city of stark social and economic divides. The idea of public transport as a social leveler is nothing new, but how the leveling out happens and doesn’t happen in particular instances and situations reveals much about a place. The access, the equality is ephemeral, it comes and goes like the trains. Yet the repetition has some substance to it, some weight.20 There are multiple constituencies served by the Metro, but the system has been especially consequential for women. The ladies’ coach of the Metro has become a site of social and political significance, not only\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\nfor the coach itself but also for how it structures the rest of the train and the larger discourse on women’s safety and mobility in the city.21 It is a women-only car, usually the first car of the train; pink signage on platforms designates where women should wait to board it. Women travel in the ladies’ coach a few feet from and in full view of the men standing or sitting in the open pathway between the ladies’ and general (or mixed) coaches. The space is fluid even as the very categories of “women” and “men” come to be reinforced. The Metro is a response to an urban space that is already experienced differently based on one’s gender, and the ladies’ coach further shapes that space, beginning with its very name. This divide is present in other cities in the world that have women-only cars on their metro systems, such as Rio de Janeiro, Cairo, Tehran, Guangzhou, Tokyo, and Mexico City. The circulation of ideas about gender relate not only to Delhi but to a broader circulation between cities, enabling us to ask: To what extent do these segregated spaces reconstitute patriarchal norms even as they may increase women’s mobility in cities?22 When a women-only coach was instituted by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation in October 2010, many women in the city were against it, saying it countered the idea of women as equal citizens with the right to be treated respectfully in public places. The Metro was supposed to condition society into a new gender equality or at least peaceable recognition. I agreed with those arguments at the time and still do; there is something to be said for enacting the change you want to see. In the early years of riding the Metro, before the ladies’ coach was instituted, I remember marveling at the shared male-female space of the trains and sensing a kind of commuter kinship that seemed to outweigh anything else. However, in the years since then, I have met so many women who tell me that they started riding the Metro only because there is a ladies’ coach that I am glad it exists. The ladies’ coach is not only a “safe space” away from unwanted male gazes and physical contact but also a porous space. There is no hardand-fast “gender line” between the ladies’ and general coaches, since the Metro’s design is one long snaking train with no barriers, only open connectors that bend and curve with the movement of the train. Men in the adjoining general coach can look in as they stand on the threshold of the ladies’ coach, but these looks are different from those given on the street.\n\nFigure 2. The ladies’ coach, 2019. The first coach of every Delhi Metro train (and on one route, the last coach) is reserved for women passengers.\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe aggression and intensity of the street seems at a remove. The Metro environment is taming, and this is what women on the trains appreciate. The gender line is one under constant construction, modulated by the looks women give to men who enter the coach or stand at its borders. It is a space where female gazes match male ones, where women are given credence before the fact, even as they are subject to the perceived necessity of a ladies’ coach. The availability of the Metro, as many told me, gave them more license, and made Delhi seem like more of an open city. • The Delhi Metro is an infrastructure that requires immense capital and planning, an agent of urbanization. Seeing how the Metro was planned and built is to see how a certain kind of top-down, government-instituted urbanization works, the processes behind it and the culture of technocratic management that it instills. Delhi’s Metro, like most mega-infrastructure projects, represents capital interests in the city that favor property owners and the already upper class and upper caste. These larger structural issues have become more entrenched with the coming of the Metro; the Metro does not shake up this order. Economic analyses showed that a fraction of what it cost to build the Delhi Metro (11.3 billion USD for the first three phases) would have been more effectively spent on making a world-class bus system, serving more people, especially poor, workingclass, and lower-middle-class people traveling to more intermediate destinations.23 But that was never the point. The government and technocratic class wanted a Metro, they got it, and now they are building more systems like it, though with fewer stops and fewer lines, in cities across India. These cities will also “have” metros, in the sense of possession and emblem. There is an undeniable “love” for the Metro, which is also an indelible part of its success.24 Still, there is something that happens on the trains, a new kind of experience, feeling, and set of relations being piled up—and distributed. The Metro encapsulates the idea of urbanism as a way of life, discernible in people’s attitudes, ideas, and personalities.25 The Metro brings a different kind of knowingness about the city to its people. It is in this space of knowingness that Dilliwalas reconcile the system’s extravagance with\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nthe everyday necessities of getting around. The Metro contributes to their identity formation and their claim to citizenship in a highly diverse city. It relays a moral claim of middle classness by offering access to new consumer spaces and vistas but also with the idea and promise of mobility itself. The Metro symbolizes a global culture its riders are a part of, even as the Metro marks a contrast within the city itself, where other infrastructures—water, sanitation, roads—are in need of such capital input and care. In this way, the Metro “addresses” the public. It is a kind of text that circulates in the city and “speaks to” those riding it and living in its midst. By addressing a public, the Metro also creates one.26 Metro and subway systems, along with airports, are increasingly sites of protest, not just because they symbolize the state but also because they highlight the relation between the everyday and the extraordinary. This was the case in Brazil in June 2013 when countrywide protests against corruption were sparked by an increase in bus, train, and metro fares in São Paulo, what came to be called the “free fare movement.” Similarly, the October 2019 protests in Santiago, Chile, came after a 4 percent subway fare hike. The social contract of public transit can be damaged but also can symbolize and enact a much wider set of issues around inequality, described by one Chilean activist as “life itself.”27 During the nationwide protests against India’s Citizenship Amendment Act that began in December 2019, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation had to continually update which stations around the city were being closed, numbering as many as sixteen on some days. The closings gave a sense of what was happening where—outside the Metro, on the streets, as well as the state management of the city’s circulatory flows. At Jaffrabad station in northeast Delhi, hundreds of people filled the road space between the Metro’s pillars, chanting slogans and lighting candles, as if under a concrete umbrella. The moving city was stopped in places, but it was not curtailed.28 The Metro is a constant reminder of government power and resolve, and this book shows how the state intersects with people’s everyday experiences and imaginaries. I describe aspects of this top-down story in that at times I “study up” by talking to Metro officials, architects, urban planners, bureaucrats, and politicians.29 However, I mostly do what I would call “study across”—across the city, across platforms, across a broad spectrum\n\n16\n\nIntroduction\n\nof working- and middle-class people who I saw, heard, and interacted with on the Metro over many years. Studying across reflects my interest in the growing global middle classes and what they signify.30 Studying across is also how people recognize and engage with one another on the trains. Each coach of the Metro is lined with benches. People sit and naturally look opposite, when they’re not looking down at their phones. • Histories of metro and subway systems around the world, taken together, say much about the role of the engineer and architect in society as well as the politics of urban planning and design.31 An ethnographic approach aims to understand the social life of infrastructure, how people engage with the technology and in the process remake themselves. In the field of anthropology, the first ethnography of an urban metro rail system was Marc Augé’s 1986 study of the Paris Métro, Un ethnologue dans le métro (In the Metro).32 A form of auto-ethnography, the book is foremost an evocation of things past, of well-worn itineraries and the long-term entwining of city and metro. In his telling, the city is the Métro. Augé’s approach is particularly fitting for the Paris Métro, whose first line opened in 1900. The Paris Métro was a revelation for what a city could be and do in the industrial age. Paris has long been a center for the study of capitalist modernity and the production of urban theory, with its wide boulevards, shopping arcades, and Métro as its defining features and experiences: reverie, flânerie, profundity. In the era of European colonialism, Paris was a political and cultural center from which many of the world’s divisions were mapped out. The city is also a hallmark of the kinds of class and racial divisions mapped onto city spaces, a city of centers, peripheries, and banlieues, or suburbs. Augé’s work—a philosophical reflection, a musing on correspondences, a dwelling on memory—is an inspiration for and counterpoint to my own study. The animating feature of Delhi’s Metro is precisely its newness amidst the ongoing transformations of a megacity turned metacity, diffuse and polycentric.33 In Delhi’s story, the significance of Metro stations is sometimes for what they erase, but more often for what they suggest—and to whom. The connections Delhi commuters are making between stations\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nand their lives, the Metro and their worlds, are happening in a digital, globalized age, in a rising economy. Delhi’s Metro is a symbol of a hypermodernity, and it is a modernity that people can step into. Whether a “hypermodernity” or a “hypercity,” as these urban agglomerations are sometimes also called, the implication is something that is over and above, but that could also be concerning in the sense of being high-strung or keyed up. Delhi’s increasing speed and ongoing expansion pushes interior and exterior limits. The Metro is seen and experienced by many as a system that manages and negotiates the city by plotting it in a new way. And for this reason, the Metro becomes a site of personal transformation through the very idea of collectivity and in the space of public transit. Delhi Metro stations recall heritage points in the city, at Red Fort, Qutab Minar, Tughlakabad, and elsewhere, but the vast majority of stations mark and initiate new processes of place-making.34 New places and names have sprung up everywhere. New juxtapositions and rearticulations of what was there before. Riding the Metro becomes a new way to write the city. The Delhi Metro can certainly be compared in size, scope, and impact to London’s, Paris’s, New York’s, Tokyo’s, Moscow’s, or Mexico City’s, but it is also of a piece with more recent systems in Cairo, Taipei, Hong Kong, Seoul, Singapore, Shanghai, and Beijing.35 To integrate a massive, multiline transport infrastructure in a densely developed city, with already existing networks of monuments, roads, built forms, people, customs, and histories, is an engineering feat but also a feat of the imagination for the makers and riders of the Metro alike.36 In India’s postcolonial period, a metro rail system for Delhi was first proposed in 1969 in a study by the Delhi-based Central Road Research Institute. The idea dovetailed with Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s series of five-year plans to modernize the new nation’s industries, technologies, and cities.37 The Metro was an urban plan, not a national one, as it was meant specifically for the nation’s capital. It never got off the ground. Meanwhile, on the eastern coast of the subcontinent around the same time, Calcutta began building its own metro system. After tearing up that city, the system first opened seventeen years later in 1984. It was fully completed in the early 1990s, as a single line with sixteen stations. Delhi’s eventual metro system was planned and financed differently, but its con-\n\n18\n\nIntroduction\n\nstruction benefited from technological advances in the intervening years. Whereas in the 1970s Calcutta workers had to dig up the entire stretch of the metro corridor, in 2000s Delhi a tunnel boring machine enabled workers to use a cut-and-cover method, whereby they could make one large hole and lower the machine in the ground for underground construction. In the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation’s own origin story, the Delhi Metro was meant to be distinct from Calcutta’s as well as from the national Indian Railway system. Delhi’s Metro was to mark not only a new system of urban transport but an entirely new way of doing things.38 Nevertheless, Calcutta’s metro symbolized the city’s and the nation’s modernity in the 1980s and 1990s. News reports from the time talk of people marveling over the cleanliness, the mix of people on the trains, and the escalators.39 It wasn’t just the technology and concreteness of it. It was how people moved through and on the metro, the feeling of being modern that resided within them and in their bodily movements.40 Calcutta had always been seen as being ahead; it was the first colonial capital under the British and a meeting ground for Indian and British ideas and cultural practices. It was a city used to absorbing the new and making something of it. Calcutta’s modernity was matched only by the bustling port city and financial capital of Bombay, where the railway commuter trains were packed to the gills, but Bombayites were arguably the most forward thinking in India, men and women moving with confidence and nonchalance through the city. Delhi has always been cast differently, as a less agile city, a city laden with its heavy Partition past—of violence, sorrow, and division—and its bureaucratic stodginess. In the 1990s, after the liberalization of the Indian economy, changes started happening in the city and in people’s lives—greater consumer choices, different kinds of urban spaces, new forms of desire. On Delhi’s roads, flyovers (overpasses) sprang up to ease the flow of traffic, while also having the effect of bifurcating neighborhoods and dwarfing street life with concrete pillars. Foreign-made cars in every color began to populate those flyovers as the upper middle classes came to see and understand the city through their cars. By the end of the 1990s, the percentage of people using public transport in the city dropped by almost 15 percent.41 With the influx of new cars, roads became contested spaces, with ever more accidents and incidents between drivers and the machines they\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nFigure 3. Near Laxmi Nagar station, Blue Line, 2012.\n\noperated. The road could be menacing but also had a carnivalesque flavor to it. The road elicited new personalities and ways of being and feeling. People were paid off. Others died on the spot. There was a psychic element to road crashes and road rages, what urban theorist Ravi Sundaram describes as a meeting of “private trauma” and “public tragedy,” whereby the road was “a reference point of constant dread, and everyday stress,” even as Delhiites were becoming part of “a new commodity world.”42 There was a speeding up, he seems to say, of availability and automobility, and this heady mix led to more blood on the road. In the years before the Metro, the city’s then privately owned Blueline buses were in direct competition with the state-owned Delhi Transport Corporation buses, which only numbered 3,500. Blueline buses were ubiquitous and got you places but were also sometimes referred to as “killer buses” that were driven “in a hurricane manner.” They claimed more than a hundred deaths per year, usually when buses struck pedestrians\n\n20\n\nIntroduction\n\nin their path. As one bus driver put it, “If you saw the kind of traffic on Delhi roads—no traffic sense, no lane driving, two-wheelers crisscrossing lanes—you wouldn’t be surprised at the number of accidents.”43 And yet the road was also a space of status-making and display. By the 2000s, India had a veritable “aspirational culture,” where having a fourwheeled vehicle soon became the mark of being middle class (earlier it had been a refrigerator and a scooter). What had once been seen as the purview of the rich—the best goods, technology, education—became possible for more people, widening the landscape of desire. The Metro has a dialectical relationship with the road. The road is everything the Metro is not: congested, potholed, weathered, and host to a variety of vehicles, pedestrians, animals, and carts. Piercing horns, sputtering diesel engines, barking dogs, the rip of a motorcycle, a dainty ringing bicycle bell, and deep-voiced pushcart vendors calling out their wares punctuate an elongated din of traffic, more avant-garde than orchestral. Time gets stretched out in the road’s soundscape. When it’s hot, what you hear is amplified by your own sweat and prickling skin; it’s a relief to enter a station and get off the road. Firecrackers launched at Diwali celebrations each year leave a smoky residue for weeks; then the city becomes enveloped by gauzy, white skies as people huddle around coal stoves on the road, and the sun appears to squint at the city, a yellow smear in the sky. The Metro, by contrast, is smooth, singular, and climate controlled; you are at once at an acoustic remove. When you enter a station, a kind of quiet settles in as the regulated coolness seeps into your pores. There’s also a different configuration of lightness and darkness compared to outside. You quickly adjust. The sound of the trains coming and going is more of a shuffle than a steady beat, modulated like a sleep machine. Even the gongs that alert you to a coming station have a rhythmic quality to them. The Metro is contained the way the road is not, its entrances clearly demarcated by security checks, ticket booths, and automated gates. Once you enter a station and buy your token, you have to go through airportlike security; for men, this means going under a wooden-framed, electronic metal detector and then being “wanded” by a male security guard; women enter a small curtained security booth, where they are wanded by a female security officer. Between the lines of men (always much longer) and women entering the bodily security checks is a baggage scanner\n\nIntroduction\n\n21\n\nwhere everyone drops their stuff. Once you pass through security and collect your belongings you go through the electronic turnstiles, either with a token or travel card. Despite all the steps, the whole experience takes a minute, unless it’s rush hour at a busy station and you’re a man who is waiting in line to be scanned. Delhi’s Metro shields you from the outside, with its dangerous traffic and often harsh weather. From November to February, the fog becomes thick with pollution as particles get frozen into the air-scape, making for a still, heavy cold. From April to October, it’s the heat that swallows you, first hot and dry like an oven, sometimes accompanied by a blistering wind, the infamous loo, that sweeps over the north India plains, and then wet and sticky as the monsoon arrives in July, a glorious relief, as kids play in the streets and potholes fill with water. The Metro captures neither the savory or unsavory aspects of the seasons; the system pulls you into the trains and then you forget what it feels like outside. The Metro is considered a safer mode of transport than buses or auto rickshaws because of the system’s surveillance mechanisms, its regularity, and its mastery of converting inside to outside and outside to inside. The Metro is a space of high surveillance, where freedom of movement is doled out as you move from the security check to the electronic ticketing gate, and then down or up to a platform. The cameras can be comforting, even if you’re not sure if they are switched on or working; they are the global installations of modern life. The Delhi Metro viaducts, now ubiquitous across the city, loom above the road, often alongside flyovers, crossing over traffic or the Yamuna River, and sometimes emerging from underground tunnels, leading to elevated stations. People watch the approaching train, moving seamlessly across a low sky. • Writing about people (a basic definition of “ethnography”) is not only the description and analysis of ways of life but also an immersion in a particular place. Ethnography is a form of engagement, interaction, and documentation, a precise set of acts, a doing in the world, and also, a way to perceive. But as much as ethnography can be planned, it is an idio-\n\n22\n\nIntroduction\n\nsyncratic and contingent form of research. The Metro is scripted, a story of transnational finance, government protocols, and bureaucratic norms. And yet the Metro is not a linear narrative but rather a multiline, episodic one. It goes round-and-round, out and back, this way and that. This is the story of the Metro that I privilege in these pages. I offer an orchestrated series of vignettes that reflects how I came to see and analyze everyday experiences in light of this type of mega-infrastructure in a city such as Delhi. The Metro makes connections for us, for all time, but its plotting of places and stations, the new proximities it creates, do not stamp out the randomness of the system or the arbitrariness of getting around. The vignettes that make up The Moving City are based entirely on ethnographic research, including interviews, observations, and a long-term engagement with a place and the people living there. However, my use of this form is not only meant to relay stories. The vignettes are also “studies” in the senses of portrayal and experiment, an examination of small parts leading up to a whole. Each vignette represents a world of its own, which connects to the Metro in some way and intersects with the city. Each vignette is a kind of magnification. For this reason, they are not uniform in approach or even style; each contains its own ethnographic strategy, which I see as the way in which tone, scene-setting, dialogue, and other features highlight meaning and argument. The vignettes, with their brevity and perhaps ephemerality, mimic the flow of the Metro with its starts and stops. One cannot dwell anywhere for too long. These micro-ethnographic encounters are contained, like the journeys on a metro train, and yet bountiful and endless in a modern-day megacity. The Metro is an emergent whole, a vast technology and system that has redefined the urban landscape; yet with its numerous stops, the Metro also signifies the fragment, the partial journey, the unexpected meeting.44 You can know where you are going but not exactly who or what you will encounter. Included in the idea of stops are the Metro stations themselves and how people’s lives become organized around stations, the stops and starts, flows and stoppages of various kinds of circulation and new forms of value in the city, having to do with everything from styles of dress and the transport of goods to language and social attitudes. In my rendering of the impact and meaning of Delhi’s Metro, the vignettes take center stage.\n\nIntroduction\n\n23\n\nThey forefront the urban experience of people, the lives and itineraries of Delhiites whose paths crisscross the city. The vignette has long been part of the presentation of anthropological research, in chapter openings, for instance, or as a way to divide and pause between chapters. These slices of life are technically evidence of something, crafted into stories or scenes. It is where a writer meets her method, where the seams show. It is also where the gap between experience and representation can be explored and probed. “The gap” is also an intrinsic feature of the Metro’s built environment, between trains and platforms. It is an audible reminder on the trains and an embodied experience of getting on and off them. The gap lies between the train and the platform but also, in an interpretive sense, between the Metro and the city. Writing about the Metro is a practice of containment and definition. I rode the Metro in all its expansiveness, as researcher, commuter, interloper, but then purposefully pared it down, chiseled it away. The resulting form of this book is a way to show how things, people, places come in and out of view but is also a recognition of not always knowing how things leave off.45 My use of the vignette form is the message I want to convey about the experience of the Delhi Metro as an affective realm and transport assemblage.46 The Metro highlights the city’s beauty and possibility. The Metro forges and destroys. The Metro is the everyday. And is also yesterday, today, and tomorrow. I see the vignettes as a way to showcase but also mull over the disparate scenes of the Metro. As on the Metro, there are different ways to connect.47 There are multiple plots at work here. The Metro enables a new circulatory flow where one did not previously exist. It is in constant circulation but is also a permanent, fixed presence on the urban landscape. The system stops at night, but even then, trains are being washed and serviced. This flow is part of a particular kind of social contract that public transit represents. • This book is arranged in three parts: Crowded, Expanding, Visible. These are the three principles I see at work on the Metro, in the city, and in people’s lives. The Metro collects, defines, and disperses the crowd; it expands\n\n24\n\nIntroduction\n\nthe borders of the city as it contracts the time to travel to those borders; it makes things, people, ideas, visible in new ways, whether to individuals, communities, or the state. Crowds have long symbolized urban life, as anonymous collectives and physical pulsating masses. They represent an uneasy movement between states of being as much as identifiable social markers. Borders, as they expand or contract, gain meaning depending on which side of them you are on. Creating them is an act of mythmaking. Crossing them can redefine the self. Visibility is not just about what we can see but is also an act of recognition, even if slight, even if momentary. In the midst of the crowds interchanging at Rajiv Chowk station, under the stone columns of Connaught Place, this visibility is also a reminder of all that goes unseen, in the blur and rush of the crowd, as individuals go through turnstiles and up the escalators at the largest station in the system. Similarly, the photographs that appear in this book, which I originally took as part of my field notes, gesture to what can and cannot be seen just beyond the frame.48 The book’s triptych structure reflects the Metro’s three main construction phases. Part One introduces early stations and changes to the urban landscape and details the new kinds of embodied experiences riders have. It asks what kind of development Delhi’s Metro actualizes. Part Two recounts the expansion of existing Metro lines and the appearance of new lines. It dwells on what differentiates the Metro from the street. And it shows what kinds of social mobilities are enabled by the Metro and to what extent urban design and mass transit can be vehicles for change. Part Three incorporates the new lines completed in the Metro’s third construction phase, lines that circle the city and enable a host of new connections. It documents some of the new visibilities made possible as riders survey and experience a mostly elevated urban rail system. It shows who becomes visible because of the Metro. The parts and vignettes in this book can be read in or out of order. The Metro is an act of ordering and arranging, in the most concrete terms. It is a lasting imprint on the city. And yet the millions of individual journeys on it each day continually shuffle this deck of stations, these lines and layers of travel. In order, the vignettes offer a more chronological sense of how ideas about the Metro entered the public consciousness, how the Delhi land-\n\nIntroduction\n\n25\n\nscape changed over time, how lines were extended, how construction remade roads and areas. But if you were to shuffle the vignettes like a deck of cards, the experience may be more arbitrary but still connected, offering a cumulative portrait of this city, in this time, and how some of its people inhabit place. Out of order, the stories of people, from slight interactions to formal conversations, stand as secular parables or urban chronicles, a set of small impacts in these years of great infrastructural change.\n\nPart I\n\nCrowded\n\nHolambi Kalan\n\nPhase 1 Station\n\nRED LINE Majlis Park\n\nan Gr\n\n18\n\n17\n\nRo\n\n13\n\nad\n\n14\n\n12 11\n\nCity Park Mundka\n\nRohtak Ro\n\nad (NH 10\n\n37\n\n19\n\n20 21\n\nCivil Lines\n\n9\n\n8\n\nKAROL BAGH\n\n35\n\n33 32\n\n34\n\n6\n\n7\n\nd\n\n31\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n30\n\nMetro Bhawan\n\n51\n\n5 22 23\n\nConnaught Place\n\nBLUE LINE\n\nIndia Gate\n\n27\n\nBLUE LINE\n\n52\n\nd\n\nDelhi University\n\n36\n\nRoa\n\n49\n\n50\n\n47 46\n\n44\n\n42\n\n40\n\n38\n\nRoa\n\nYELLOW LINE\n\n10\n\nRing\n\n48\n\n45\n\n43\n\n41\n\n)\n\n39\n\nMall\n\nnk\n\n15\n\nru dT\n\nP I TA M P U R A\n\n16\n\nDWAR K A Vikas Sadan\n\n53 54\n\n55 56\n\nAll India Institute of Medical Sciences\n\nMunirka\n\nIndian Institute of Technology\n\nVASANT KUNJ\n\nNATIONAL CAPITAL REGION\n\nRohtak Sonipat\n\nSOUTH EXTENSION\n\nDilli Haat\n\nHauz Khas\n\nBRT Corridor Ring Road\n\nQutab Minar\n\nCHIRAGH DELHI Saket\n\nMeerut\n\nJhajjar DELHI Gurgaon Rewari HARYANA\n\nAlwar RAJASTHAN\n\nUTTAR PRADESH\n\nChhatarpur\n\nBulandshahr\n\n0 G U R G AO N / G U R U G R A M RITES\n\n0\n\n1 1\n\n2 2\n\n3\n\n3 mi 4\n\n5 km\n\nS O U T H\n\nN\n\nMetro Stations RED LINE\n\n3\n\n4\n\n1\n\n2\n\nGHAZIABAD\n\nLal Quila-Red Fort Jama Masjid Chandni Chowk Chawri Bazar Ramlila School of Planning Maidan and Architecture\n\n29\n\nMathura Rd\n\n4\n\nN\n\n28\n\nPAT PA R G A N J\n\nVikas Minar Akshardham MAYUR VIHAR\n\nNational Gallery of Modern Art\n\nT R I LO K P U R I\n\nJANGPURA Defence Colony LAJPAT NAGAR\n\nNOIDA Kalkaji Temple\n\nr\n\nBotanical Garden\n\nOKHLA Nehru Place\n\nYa m un aR\n\nH\n\niv\n\ner\n\nDakshinpuri\n\nD E L H I\n\nBADARPUR\n\nFARIDABAD\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28\n\nShahdara Welcome Seelampur Shastri Park Kashmere Gate Tis Hazari Pul Bangash Pratap Nagar Shastri Nagar Inderlok Kanhaiya Nagar Keshav Puram Netaji Subhash Kohat Enclave Pitampura Rohini East Rohini West Rithala Vishwavidyalaya Vidhan Sabha Civil Lines Chandni Chowk Chawri Bazar New Delhi Rajiv Chowk Patel Chowk Central Sect.

(overleaf ) Phase 1 of the Delhi Metro opened in stages between 2002 and 2006 and consisted of three lines: Red, Yellow, and Blue. With Phase I, Dilliwalas became accustomed to torn-up streets, blocked entrances, and blue corrugated-metal boundary walls that lined city roads, especially in central Delhi (Yellow Line), northwest Delhi (Red Line), and west Delhi (Blue Line). Phase I was the opening salvo in the Metro offensive. It was the time when the interface between the Metro and the city was first felt and negotiated. City residents and business owners had been and were still being moved out of the Metro’s way. As station names and places took hold in the imagination, those displaced by the construction were permanently relocated to places far from the city (and the Metro), such as Holambi Kalan in northwest Delhi.\n\nT h e T rai n to D wa r ka The train to Dwarka is crowded even on an early Sunday afternoon. Central Delhi may be more still, and the road traffic-less, but inside the Metro throngs of people are going places. At times they crush into one another.

Three younger boys, thirteen or fourteen years old, stand in front of them, doing pull-ups on the high bar, joking, trying to get the attention of the other men by entertaining them with curiosities pulled from their pockets.

The Metro has no ticket collector to complain to if something goes wrong or if someone gets out of line, for this is an automated environment. Many people were shocked, when, early on, a contracted Metro worker directing people to board a train got his hand stuck in the door as it was closing and was dragged to the next station while clutching the outside of the train. Passengers on board watched in amazement and horror but didn’t know to hit the emergency bell. As the train heads west, aboveground, the city opens up and peters out into a landscape of circling birds, low-level dwellings, institutes of knowledge, health, and beauty, and the occasional shopping mall. This east-west line is for commuters; the trains go aboveground soon after Connaught Place, and people tend to stay on for more than a few stops. There is time to relax and settle in. A wiry young man I’m standing next to, Pranjal, is studying at the National Law University. He shares an apartment with another student near Delhi University and regularly rides the train. When I tell him I’m studying the Metro, he says, “I don’t know if you’re looking at the economics of it or issues of marketing, but I have some thoughts.” He feels the need to teach, tell, persuade, or command people to follow certain rules, he says, like the one to let other passengers off the train before boarding themselves. He describes being in the crush of the crowd one day, alongside a young mother carrying a small child. The crowd hadn’t made way for her but had pushed her aside. He couldn’t understand this, nor do anything to help her; he ended up ensnarled in her bangles and left the train with bruised arms. On the platform people rush to the escalators, forming a wide circle at the bottom of each one. It slowly shrinks as people move up. A smaller group waits for the elevator. “Stay Fit, Use the Stairs” signs are posted at each exit, placed there, it turns out, not to keep the populace in shape but to encourage the able-bodied to leave room in the elevators for others. Once upstairs (or downstairs, if at an elevated station) everyone passes through the electronic gates once more to leave the station. Some walk, others look for a bus or an auto or cycle rickshaw.

The station’s pale gray stone façade was meant to blend into the landscape, which it eventually did; but in 2006 it still had a curb, a crumbling set of stones at its perimeter that pointed to its newness, a place, a line really, where the station and the city met. This line in the stony sand represented the city’s becomingness in the sense that the urban is always becoming, always in process. The line also made the city visible, in the sense that it came into being in a new manner, a new framing. There was more to see, to apprehend, in the new angles and fixtures.

Sounds indicate motion in the city; they expand the space of the road and become something you not only hear but feel. Ambient sounds are everywhere, creating an “interlocking soundscape.”5 With sirens and the ringing of temple bells in the mix, you could be in a video arcade. Then an airplane hums overhead; you can barely hear it, but the sight of it somehow trumps the sound on the road. The Metro system takes people out of circulation at first, of sight and sound, then reprocesses them inside through the ticket line, security check, and platforms to join another type of circulation. Mandi House station’s sixteenth-century moniker, the Raja of Mandi, has no place or purpose in this new urban reckoning. Mandi House had already become a general urban designation for this place of establishment arts, communications, and culture. It originally referred to a building, then to a roundabout, and now to a Metro station.

A name can gain momentum over time. Kamala, who works as a beautician in south Delhi homes, first went on the Metro when her husband took her and their three children for a joyride. Her husband used to go “up-down” on the Blue Line from Mayur Vihar to Mandi House. He worked as a cook at the National School of Drama. “He cooked for those kids learning how to act,” she tells me. Kamala’s husband died earlier in the year, making her a thirty-eightyear-old widow. “He took too many medicines from the chemist and had a bad reaction,” she explains. “His lungs failed.” The youngest of her three children thinks his father is still in the hospital and sometimes asks why he’s been there for so long. Her husband was good, she says, “he showed a lot of love.” Kamala describes the Metro as being “andhar hee andhar”—enclosed, encompassed. When it’s hot you escape the heat, when it’s cold you escape the cold. One afternoon we ride to Mandi House together; Kamala gets in line to buy a token, and I follow suit. We take the Blue Line toward Noida. From there the train goes aboveground at Pragati Maidan. Kamala points out the window of the train to the light blue and white World Health Organization building just beneath us in the close distance and tells me that this is where they set the nutrition guidelines for India. We get down at Yamuna Bank station to meet her cousin, Alok, on the platform. He is taking her to a government office to deposit her widow’s pension papers. We take the next train and get to Mayur Vihar, and she and Alok go off to look for an auto rickshaw.

Just to take a bus, you had to get down at the right stop.” I got in touch with Vanita through a friend of a friend, who, on hearing about my interest in the Metro, said, “I know someone you should talk to.” I called Vanita and we arranged to meet. Vanita is a college lecturer and came to Delhi in the 1970s when she finished her postgrad education and got married. She doesn’t tell me anything about her husband other than “he knew how to drive.” He bought a secondhand car for them, and soon she couldn’t think of being in Delhi without one. They lived in east Delhi, and after some time they got a better car. They had a traditional middle-class division of labor: she looked after the children while he focused on his profession. “He tried teaching me how to drive, but I was a late starter, I couldn’t deal with the traffic. I became more and more dependent on him.” Then they hired a driver, which Vanita came to understand as “this other dependence.” If her husband and the driver were not around, she’d call a taxi. They lived in Vasant Kunj by this time, which was badly connected to central areas of the city. “Autos always charged extra,” she says. Not knowing how to drive and becoming dependent on a driver—first her husband and then a hired driver—framed Vanita’s relationship with the city for over thirty years. In 2004, her husband gifted her a new car, an Opel Corsa. She thought, “Since when have we become so rich? It used to be that you got a casserole as a gift. I only ever traveled in the car with him on a few special occasions.” The idea of going anywhere alone, without the driver, didn’t cross her mind. It only changed with the rude and painful experience of her husband leaving her after twenty-seven years of marriage. Her husband suggested they sell the Corsa and buy her something small. He soon moved out of the house, and she continued to travel to Pitampura in the northeast of the city from Vasant Kunj, in south Delhi beyond the Outer Ring Road. She had a driver and took the other car, the “poor” Zen. Several years on, the divorce proceedings were getting messier. Vanita got a stay order to keep the house but not the car. “My husband came with a key and took the car one day. My neighbor saw him.” She contacted the police, but they laughed at her when she told them the car registration was in her husband’s name. “That’s when I realized he used to take care of\n\nCrowded\n\n37\n\neverything, even the mobile recharge. I had reduced myself to a complete state of dependence.” And then a friend suggested she start taking the Metro, even though it required her to take an auto rickshaw until Central Secretariat, almost half the distance. The commute wasn’t really practical, but she did it anyway. “The Metro became part of my day-to-day,” Vanita says. “You have to walk fast; you can’t waddle along. You can get jostled a bit. But within several days, riding it made me a different person. It was a novelty, but it also took my mind off things. I had lost my trust in anyone.” Vanita explains that she used to have a family and she used to have a family car. “One had been living in that kind of illusion,” she tells me. Suddenly, she was left without anything. It was then that the Metro gained importance in her life. She got a Metro card. “Whether I use it or not, it’s a great psychological support for me. I’m someone who’s not been abroad. When you see the Metro, you think, my god, you seem to be in a foreign country. Indian trains are so different, grimy. The Metro is so different. You feel a very small portion of what it’s like in other countries.” Vanita not only started taking the Metro to the college where she worked, but to Tis Hazari Court as well, which happened to be on the same line. By then she was involved in three cases against her husband and had to make regular trips to the court for proceedings. “I could see it from the train,” she says, “My god, have I reached here? It was a wonder. It gave me a different angle on my life to see the court from there, and to be getting there by taking the Metro. My husband’s absence, earlier it used to disturb me, but not now.”\n\nT h e Image o f the C ity For Delhi architect A.G.

Yes, the loan is from abroad,” he says, referencing the Japanese financing of the project, “but it is the government who is backing the loan. The Metro is a manifestation of India’s image, the India shining bit.” Menon, who has had leading roles for several decades at the Indian\n\n38\n\nCrowded\n\nNational Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), the Delhi Urban Arts Commission, and the Heritage Conservation Committee, is not only a practicing architect but someone invested in the broader picture of the city and how it gets imagined. He believes that the Metro was a bad economic decision but also concedes it might do some good: “People might begin to see this megacity as a city, which would be a good thing, binding the city. The image of the city is going to change.” According to Menon, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) had shown the Delhi Urban Arts Commission a “conceptual proposal” of the Metro lines, though not the actual thing. On that basis, the group lodged their complaints and requests: to protect an old cinema façade in Chawri Bazar was one, with the reasoning that the memory of the street it was located on should remain; the second was to change the route of the Yellow Line so that it didn’t obstruct the view of Qutab Minar, one of the city’s oldest monuments and tourist sites and a defining feature of its skyline. The DMRC got rid of the cinema façade in Chawri Bazar but changed the route of the Yellow Line at Qutab Minar at a cost of 300 crores [USD 40 million]. Besides the issue of protecting heritage, what concerns Menon most about the Metro lines spreading across the city is the five hundred meters of densification—what gets built and developed—along each line. The Metro routes were chosen based on land acquisition and travel surveys. Now, Menon says, the DMRC must justify those routes and the master plan must be changed to fit the increasing densification along those routes, an example, he says, of “the tail wagging the dog.” The Metro in this sense has become the de facto plan, but without committee or consultation. Delhi’s first master plan, with the help of the Ford Foundation team in India, was formulated in 1962 and laid out a decentralized city even as it sought to integrate the development of the city. The point of plans, though—whether this one or the two that followed for 2001 and 2021—is that they are available for public scrutiny and conceived of by multiple stakeholding agencies, even if issued by the Delhi Development Authority. In a 1997 article in Economic and Political Weekly, Menon had argued that planning in India was dominated by Western models, and for him this meant that urban planners were not only working on behalf of the\n\nCrowded\n\n39\n\nmiddle class but were entrenched in their beliefs, in their idea of the city. For Menon this is both a practical problem and an ethical one. We talk about the New Delhi Municipal Corporation’s plans to beautify and pedestrianize Connaught Place. Their plans are to change the iconic stone pillars from sandstone to marble, to create standardized signage for all the shops, to change the windows. “The planners want it to look new and clean, not to look old, which it is, eighty years old.” Menon thinks that things can look old and good. He unrolls plan after plan on the large worktable we’re sitting around in his home office in south Delhi off the Outer Ring Road. Menon believes that conservation is not and should not be reduced to beautification, but he feels he can’t communicate this point with any kind of effectiveness across the many platforms he has in the city. He can’t argue, he tells me, against the aspiration people have to beautify. Another example is Gole Market, which was the “native” market in the colonial period. Here they want to gentrify what is still a working market, and this vision is for outsiders rather than for the people who come to the market and work in the market. “They want to add a glass dome; they want to change a market into a museum,” Menon says. “Who is this conservation for? Conservation in India can’t be an elite activity; you have to be thinking about the local sentiment, of the fishmonger, the grocer, etc. The neighborhood is made up of low-level clerks; the market must serve their needs. The problem is that conservation is equated with backwardness. It’s seen as dragging people back. Instead, you must make everything development-oriented.” Menon is not against beautiful architecture, and in fact he tells me he thinks most of the Metro stations are ugly, a lost opportunity. What he opposes is “the march to beautify” and destroy the authenticity of what was there before. Heritage is not merely to be protected but also understood. The more we talk, the more I come to think of his idea of authenticity as being about integrity—whether the integrity of neighborhoods and their composition, or of building materials, the very elements of the built environment. How, he seems to be asking, can we preserve the relationship between the built environment and communities in its midst? The larger problem, in Menon’s view, is “the dearth of an urban discourse.” He tells me that his friends don’t know and don’t care what he does. And then he shares this image: of people sitting in Vienna in a café\n\n40\n\nCrowded\n\nat 11 p.m. arguing about a new building that is going to be built. He relishes this scene of critical discussion and laments what he sees around him as a disinterested public. “Here in India, regarding architecture and city planning, the poor suffer it, the middle class enjoys it, and the elites couldn’t care less. The public is profane. The rich can follow the master plan, the rules laid down by it, but the poor are forced to break the law.”6 Menon doesn’t give in to his own cynicism. He remains active, central even, on panels, with nonprofits, and at a host of writing and speaking engagements. He has hardly given up. For him, architecture and the role of the architect is a social practice as much as a creative or technical one. Before I leave, Menon reminds me that the seventy-third and seventyfourth amendments to the Indian Constitution mandate power to the people, panchayat raj, the local self-governance councils across rural and urban India.

It’s not meant for the public; it is a workplace. And yet it also introduces a new historical form to the city, a distillation of the new Metro system crisscrossing the city. It is an architecture that stands apart from the Mughal, colonial, and even postcolonial, with an exterior that suggests movement, even locomotion, via its gleaming, sun-reflecting surfaces, curved front, and diamond-shaped cut-outs. It does not blend into the surroundings but rather dominates them. The building is reflective of the Metro system rather than the city. And like the Metro system, Metro Bhawan marks out the idea and feeling of inside as outside and outside as inside, from its façade to its elevators. It is a headquarter building in the center of the city, yet one that symbolizes the myriad new connections the Metro forges between center and periphery, and the creation of new city centers in the form of interchange stations. Metro Bhawan’s disjuncture with its surroundings is not about postmodern fragmentation and dislocation, but rather a new centering that is imposed on the city, plonked down. For the good of the city, the DMRC would say. Once inside I’m directed to the public relations office. Sushma, a senior officer, tells me that the Metro was required, otherwise “the city would collapse.” This idea of collapse, the city on the brink, is one that gets written into the origin story of the Metro across DMRC publications. Sushma chalks up the Metro’s success to three principles: leadership, guidance, and massive training sessions. Four thousand people work for the DMRC and go through a rigorous three-month training program. The project is built on public-private partnerships with some five hundred contractors. It is the cheapest metro ride in the world. A poster behind Sushma’s desk reads: DMRC—A professional work culture with 1. Accountability 2. Transparency 3. Teamwork 4. Time-bound commitments Driven by passion\n\nSushma takes me into the office of Anuj Dayal, the chief spokesperson for the DMRC, the face of the organization after its project managers—first\n\n42\n\nCrowded\n\nFigure 5.

He is friendly, polite, and seemingly willing to help. At the same time, I never get access to anyone at the DMRC through him. When I ask him about the famed work culture and discipline of the organization, he invites me to witness one of the onsite yoga sessions at Metro Bhawan. It’s a late-afternoon class with a dozen Metro officials in regulation slacks and cotton polo shirts and one yogi, a small taut man in a yellow kurta pajama. We are in an auditorium off the main lobby; they are all on the stage and I am in the audience of one. The yogi leads the class in Hindi through a number of sun salutations, seated asanas, pranayama, sivasana. Feet circle in the air, heads bob up and down. I feel relaxed just watching them. Here in this sleek building in central Delhi it’s hard not to see this yoga practice, these familiar postures, as a kind of “postmodern transformation of culture.”9 This is yoga for a purpose, a kind of solution to the problem of the modern workplace and the very timings and pressures that the DMRC\n\nCrowded\n\n43\n\ndemands of its workers. The sticking to the clock. But the yoga also aims to be spiritual guidance: How will Indians build and run a world-class Metro? How will this city remain Indian with a Metro? How will people’s insides match the outside? The solutions almost seem to be in the poses themselves, ones that began in India, traveled the world, and then came back as global products for the body and spirit. The Metro and the yoga poses seem to have been destined to meet on this stage.\n\nS pace an d M atter A new space is a new set of boundaries. The most obvious of these for riders are the entrances to the Metro—the security check, ticket booth, and automated entry. These areas are bounded by physical objects: electronic gates and doors, uniformed security guards, metal detectors, stairwells, potted plants, glass dividers, and metal handrails. At the Dwarka Sector 9 station, I notice a sheet of paper posted at the security-curtained area on the side of the metal detector, listing what cannot be brought on to the train: dried blood; human corpse; animal carcasses; any part of human skeleton; manure.
