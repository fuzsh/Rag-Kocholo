        "text": "The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has initiated the process of obtaining statutory clearances for constructing two newly approved corridors under Phase IV.\n\nThe two new corridors — one from Lajpat Nagar to Saket G-Block in the south and the other from Inderlok in the northwest to Indraprastha in central Delhi — was approved by the Union cabinet in March 2024.\n\nSince the approval, DMRC has been actively working to secure the necessary permissions and land acquisitions to begin construction.\n\nA senior DMRC official told ToI, “Currently, we are in the process of seeking statutory clearances which include acquiring land from the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), and the Public Works Department (PWD), along with meeting the requirements for forest clearance.”\n\n“Further processes regarding planning and tendering for civil works are being done, before further proceeding to specialised contracts for track laying, electrical systems, signalling and other technical components. The two corridors are targeted for completion by 2028,” added the official.\n\nThe two new corridors, spanning 20.7 km with 18 stations, will benefit an additional 2.5 lakh daily commuters. With a projected cost of Rs 8,399 crore, funding will come from the Union and Delhi governments, as well as international agencies.\n\nThe Lajpat Nagar to Saket G-Block line, stretching 8.4 km, will put many south Delhi neighbourhoods, including Andrews Ganj, Greater Kailash, and Saket, on the metro map, enhancing last-mile transit.\n\nThis elevated line will feature eight stations: Lajpat Nagar, Andrews Ganj, Greater Kailash-1, Chirag Delhi, Pushpa Bhawan, Saket District Centre, Pushp Vihar and Saket G Block.\n\nWhile the 12.4 km Inderlok-Indraprastha corridor will be an extension of the Green Line, which links Bahadurgarh and Inderlok/Kirti Nagar, opening up new areas in Central and East Delhi.\n\nThe corridor will feature 10 stations: Inderlok, Daya Basti, Sarai Rohilla, Ajmal Khan Park, Nabi Karim, New Delhi, LNJP Hospital, Delhi Gate, Delhi Sachivalaya, and Indraprastha. While the Inderlok station will be elevated, the remaining nine stations will be underground.\n\nUnder Phase-IV, the Delhi Metro is adding 65.20 km of new lines across three priority corridors in the national capital, with 45 metro stations. These new corridors are expected to be completed by March 2026 in stages."
