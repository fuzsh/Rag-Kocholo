We have discussed on how the worldâ€™s first metro rail system was built in London? Based on feedback received from the readers, we have also started a knowledge series to keep readers updated on metro rail technology. We have covered the interviews of Mr. Achal Khare, Managing Director, National High Speed Rail Corporation (NHSRCL), Mr. Ashutosh Shukla, Director (Transportation & Mobility), Schneider Electric India and Mr. Luong Vo Ta, General Director, Vinh Hung JSC, Vietnam. These leaders have made huge success in their respective fields despite of covid-19 impact on the industry."
