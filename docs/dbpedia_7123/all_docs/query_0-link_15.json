        "text": "If you look closely at the major railway routes in South Asia and elsewhere, you will notice fairly large railway facilities at places which were not important towns to begin with. So there must have been some reasons for locating these stations at a particular place.\n\nSometimes the reasoning was clearly stated. In the earlier days of the East Indian Railway the large workshops and training centres were set up at Jamalpur in Bihar. The EIR administration did say that they did not want the junior employees to be distracted by the bright lights of Calcutta.\n\nAnother peculiar station was Barog on the Kalka-Shimla route. This station does not have much population in the vicinity and exists primarily to provide food to the passengers. (Although there is a larger town Solan few km away),\n\nOn the micro scale, crossing stations needed to be set up for the convenience of smooth running on single line sections. There are literally hundreds of such stations all over the country. For example, persons familiar with the Haridwar-Dehradun area would know Motichur and Kansrao stations which exist only for crossing purposes.\n\nJunctions would need to be set up where important routes met. Other stations with coaling and watering facilities for steam locos would need to be set up at certain intervals. Sometimes this could be done at the junctions. If not, a large station would have to be set up at a place which was not already a junction. The criteria for location would be that it would be 100-250 km from the nearest station with similar facilities.\n\nWe will look at such stations on the trunk routes in subsequent blogposts.\n\nWhat is special about this station?\n\n2. What is special about the BG siding here?\n\n3. What is unusual about these two station signs? Explain.\n\n4. What additional language is on this sign?\n\n5. This is often labelled as “Nawab Station”, although no such name is in the timetable. Which station is this?\n\n6. With luck, you may be able to get tuna at Tuni station. But there was another station called Tuna in the past. In which present-day state is it?\n\n7. Bengali travelers can try to get fish at this station restaurant. Which state or province is it in?\n\n8. Many clocks at stations and other public places were supplied by P. Orr & Sons of Madras. This small station is far from Madras. In which state?\n\n9. Consider these two pairs of stations:\n\n9A\n\nand 9B:\n\nWhat do the pair in 9A have in common with the pair in 9B?\n\n10. What is unusual about this station which is not in India?\n\n11. This shows the abandoned station which used to be a ferry terminal as well as being adjacent to a zonal headquarters until the mid-60s. Name it.\n\n12. The fate of Dhanushkodi is well known. But you can still see the remains of it. A small terminus in the North-East was less fortunate as it fell into the Brahmaputra after an earthquake in the 1950s. Which was it?\n\nANSWERS:\n\nThe best response was by Biswarup Basu. Honourable mention to Ganesh Iyer and Bharat Parashar:\n\nKot Kapura is the northern most point of metre gauge in India. It was connected by MG to Bathinda and Fazilka, which are to its south.\n\nThe Tirap siding is beyond Ledo, and is the eastern most point of IR in India. BG goods trains run there. Further east there is the abandoned MG line to Lekhapani. There are also non-IR industrial lines nearby.\n\nThe normal practice is to have the state’s official language on top. In Nagaland (Dimapur) and Mendipathar (Meghalaya), English script is used for official purposes so it is on top.\n\nDogri language, which is one of the 22 official languages.\n\nThis is a part of Rampur station (between Bareilly and Moradabad in UP). This platform had been used for the royal train of the Nawab of Rampur. The dilapidated platform and coaches are probably still there.\n\nIn Gujarat, on an abandoned portion of the Cutch State Railway.\n\n7. Balochistan, at the foot of the Bolan Pass going to Quetta. This station, like Karjat, is the base for banking locomotives for uphill trains.\n\n8. Madhya Pradesh, on the Kota-Bina section.\n\n9. These are connected with unusual gauges which were not used anywhere else on IR. The Arconum-Conjeevaram line was initially constructed with 3’6″ and was soon converted to metre gauge, and finally to broad gauge more recently. The Azimganj-Nalhati section was initially constructed with 4’0″ and was soon converted to broad gauge. This loco was converted at the same time and can still be seen at the National Rail Museum.\n\n10. Quasba (Kamalasagar until the late 40s) is in Bangladesh on the main line from Akhaura to Chattogram. It is practically on the border with India and trains can easily be observed from the Indian side.\n\n11. Pandu, on the south bank of the Brahmaputra. A ferry service from Aminigaon ran there until the mid-1960s. The NF zone headquarters was initially here and later moved to Maligaon.\n\n12. Saikhowa Ghat, on a branch from Makum. This branch now terminates at Dangari.\n\nThe Indian Railways had 17 zones at last count. Life was simpler in the past. In 1963 there were only 8 zones as the SCR was yet to come.\n\nThe All-India timetables of those days used to carry a list of Inter-Railway junctions. It was quite a long list, but it was swollen by the 9 Non-Government light railways which had their space at the end of the timetable. In the timetable of October 1963 they were:\n\nDehri Rohtas Light Railway (DR)\n\nArrah Sasaram Light Railway (AS)\n\nFutwah Islampur Light Railway (FI)\n\nHowrah Amta Light Railway (HA)\n\nHowrah Sheakhala Light Railway (HS)\n\nShahdara Saharanpur Light Railway (SS)\n\nAhmadpur Katwa Light Railway (AK)\n\nBurdwan Katwa Light Railway (BK)\n\nBankura Damodar River Railway (BD)\n\nFor more about them you can see these earlier blogposts:\n\nhttps://abn397.wordpress.com/2015/10/28/the-non-government-railways-of-india-in-1964-and-what-happened-to-them/\n\nand\n\nhttps://abn397.wordpress.com/2019/11/19/the-non-government-railways-of-the-1940s/\n\nHere you can see the list of junctions given in the All-India Timetable\n\nNote that the ones in bold type are the ones between regular zones. Some comments are given on the right.\n\nMany changes occurred over the years, starting with the formation of the South Central Railway in 1966 with two divisions of CR and two of SR. A further adjustment was made between CR and SC in the 1970s. And the great reorganization of 2002-2003 brought the number of zones to 16 (though the Konkan Railway is not a zone) and then 17 when the Kolkata Metro became a zone.\n\nAnd all the light railways were either closed or incorporated into the main zones.\n\nBalharshah was not an inter-railway junction prior to 1966, but now it is.\n\nRaichur had been an inter-railway junction right from the 1870s, but now it is not.\n\nWaltair/VSKP remains an inter-railway junction since the east coast line was opened in the 1900s.\n\nKuchaman Road itself is closed when the route was re-aligned to be further away from the Sambhar Lake. Then the WR and NR joined at Phulera. And when the NWR was formed, there was no need for an inter-zone junction there.\n\nOne more point is that there were many junctions between the NR and NER in UP. At that time NER was almost entirely metre gauge. In most cases there were separate stations and station codes for the NR (BG) and NER (MG) stations. For example, Bareilly Jn was BE for NR and BRY for NER.\n\nThe definitions of a railway junction are many. In general, we say that a junction is where three or more lines meet.\n\nA more detailed definition is given by my friend DSP Anirudh:\n\n“In the company-era railways, the stations at the boundary between the railway networks of 2 different companies, were also called Junctions.\n\nThis reflects the more generic meaning of Junction, which refers to a point where two or more things are joined. In railway parlance, this meant that even passing stations (with no branch lines and no break of gauge) could also be termed as Junctions as long as there was something different about the railway lines on either side of the station.”\n\nHowever, there are also “pseudo-junctions” where one line ends and another one starts, where they are of different gauges. So passengers and freight would have to be transferred at this point.\n\nWe look at the pseudo-junctions which existed since 1950. If we go further back many instances can be found in the years while the IR system was expanding.\n\nKalka and Mettupalaiyam are the most obvious ones, with BG/MG and BG/NG. These will continue indefinitely as long as the mountain railways are running.\n\nNot Neral, NJP, Siliguri and Pathankot as they are junctions in the normal sense as three or more lines are meeting.\n\nOne which existed until the 1990s was Parli Vaijnath, where a BG line from Vikarabad met a MG line from Parbhani. Now the MG line is converted.\n\nOne which still exists (from 2005) is Udaipur City, where the MG line from Ajmer side was converted to BG and the MG line to Ahmedabad side remained. This was a relatively new line which was opened in the mid-60s. However, the line from Ahmedabad via Himatnagar is partly converted and may be fully BG by 2021. So this, like Parli Vaijnath, will become a wayside station on BG.\n\nOthers which will exist for a year or so are Bahraich and Mhow (Dr Ambedkar Nagar).\n\nYou may be thinking of Miraj, but that was a junction in the normal sense with branches to Kolhapur and Kurduwadi.\n\nShantipur on ER had this status until a few years ago, when the BG line from Ranaghat met the NG line to Krishnanagar and Nabadwip. Now the NG line is being converted and there is no longer a BG-NG connection at Shantipur.\n\nA short-term BG-NG junction existed at Balgona for a year or so in the course of the NG to BG conversion of the Barddhaman-Katwa section. Now the conversion is completed.\n\nYou may think that New Bongaigaon was where BG ended and MG started between the mid-60s and early 80s. This is incorrect as the BG branch from NBQ to Jogighopa was also opened in the mid-60s, but did not have passenger service for a long time. Local trains were there in the early 70s.\n\nViramgam was where BG ended until the 1970s, but more than one MG line ended there.\n\nJaynagar on the Bihar-Nepal border would not qualify since the IR station (MG, then BG) was at a different location from the NG line of the Nepal Railways. I don’t know if there is any change now. The new BG line from Jaynagar to Janakpur and beyond does not seem to have opened yet.\n\nIf you go back to the time of independence, there was a BG-NG connection at the OLD Siliguri, where the BG line from Sealdah via Haldibari ended and the NG line started. The NEW Siliguri Jn was built to the north of this, near the old station of Siliguri Road.\n\nAt this time, Kishanganj was the end of a MG branch from Katihar and Barsoi and the NG line to old Siliguri started from there.\n\nIf you count cases where only passengers had to move from one gauge to another, we can include Madras Beach in the past. For a while, the BG Ganga Kaveri Express used to end there and the corresponding MG train to Rameswaram would start from there.\n\nAlso Coimbatore, as it was the end of MG lines from the Pollachi side. The MG lines continued to a point near Coimbatore North.\n\nMany other cases can be found from the earlier days. The weirdest case in undivided India was probably in the Bolan Pass connecting Quetta to the Indus Valley, where there was a small MG section in the middle of the pass between two BG lines. This MG section between Hirok and Kolpur did not last long. During that time (in the late 19th century) passengers and goods were transhipped at both these stations.\n\nThis is incomplete, but it is probably not feasible to include all such cases which occurred in the course of lengthy gauge conversion projects.\n\nThis is from a map found on the net:\n\nYpu can download it from https://www.flickriver.com/photos/124446949@N06/49078963546/\n\nOtherwise you can refer to the cropped portions below.\n\nThe blue color indicates the IMR and the orange indicates the GIPR.\n\nMore basic history can be seen here:\n\nhttps://wiki.fibis.org/w/Indian_Midland_Railway\n\nThe IMR was short-lived and existed only from 1885 to 1900 when it was absorbed by the GIPR. This particular map seems to be from the 1890s.\n\nThe station presently known as Bina was then known as Etawah or Itawa. Note the other old spellings such as Cawnpoor.\n\nWe can also see that the Agra-Mathura-Delhi line was not built yet. But one could go from Agra to Tundla and then to Delhi. Indeed, during the 1890s the GIP trains from Bombay to Delhi did follow this route.\n\nAnd the BBCIR had not advanced much from Baroda towards Delhi. But it was also a regular practice for travelers from Bombay to Delhi to travel to Ahmedabad and then by MG to Delhi.\n\nThis box item from the IMR map has some points of interest:\n\nIt lists out the lines which existed then, including “Etawah” to Saugor, i.e. Bina to Saugor, though the extension to Katni was completed later.\n\nThe “Comparison of Distances” provides insight into the rivalry of different companies connecting the same pairs of cities. In later years the BBCI and GIP kept trying to show that their services between Bombay and Delhi/Punjab were better. This ended only when the railways were regrouped to form the WR, CR etc in the early 1950s.\n\nHere we see that the IMR route from Bombay to Kanpur was shortest, :\n\n1. Via Jhansi-Kanpur 830 miles (1336 km) which is the standard route today\n\n2. Via Itarsi-Jabalpur-Allahabad-Kanpur 964 miles (1552 km)\n\n3. Via Baroda, Ahmedabad-Delhi by MG, Delhi-Kanpur 1006 miles (1620 km)\n\nAnd similarly for Bombay to Agra:\n\n1. Via Jhansi-Agra 830* miles (1336 km) which is the standard route today\n\n* So Jhansi-Agra and Jhansi-Kanpur are the same distance?\n\n2. Via Itarsi-Jabalpur-Allahabad-Tundla-Agra 1123 miles (1808 km)\n\n3. Via Baroda, Ahmedabad-Bandikui-Agra by MG 849 miles (1367 km)\n\nOnce the BBCIR got going and completed the Baroda-Mathura section by around 1910, they clearly had a shorter route between Bombay and Delhi.\n\nThe GIPR and EIR met at Jabalpur (Jubbulpore in those days). By the 1920s the Allahabad-Jabalpur section was transferred to the GIPR.\n\nSome jokes from those days:\n\nGIP stood for “Great Improvement Possible”\n\nBBCI stood for “Beastly, Bad and Cannot Improve”\n\nThen there were “Bribes Never Refused”, “Mails Slowly Moving” and “Sambar Idli Railway” which you should be able to guess.\n\nHowever, the EIR escaped these nicknames.\n\nMore historical details:\n\nTo help you keep track:\n\nOpening dates:\n\n(HALR):\n\nTelkul Ghat (Howrah) to Dumjur: 01-07-1897 9.20 miles/14.81 km\n\nDumjur to Bargachia: 02-10-1897 5.87/9.45\n\nBargachia to Maju: 04-05-1898 5.50/8.86\n\nMaju to Amta: 01-06-1898 6.62/10.66\n\nTotal 27.19/43.78\n\nChampadanga branch:\n\nBargachia to Jagatbalabpur: 02-10-1897 1.50/2.42\n\nJagatbalabpur to Autpur: 01-06-1904 8.50/13.69\n\nAutpur to Champadanga 24-08-1908: 6.68/10.75\n\nTotal 16.68/26.86\n\n(HASR):\n\nKadamtala to Chanditala 02-08-1897: 8.88/14.30\n\nChanditala to Kistrampur 10-09-1897: 3.75/6.04\n\nKistrampur to Sheakhala 07-11-1897: 4.75/7.65\n\nTotal: 17.38/27.99\n\nJanai branch:\n\nChanditala to Janai 05-05-1898: 2.37/3.82\n\nLATER DEVELOPMENTS:\n\nBy 1939, service were stopped between Howrah Ghat and Kadamtala. All the trains started from the latter.\n\nIn 1948, a new terminus was constructed at Howrah Maidan. A new alignment was created from there to Dasnagar\n\nThis was opened on 01-02-1948 with a length of 4.00 km.\n\nThat was common to the HALR and HASR.\n\nFor the HASR, a new alignment was also opened on 01-02-1948 from Dasnagar Km 3.2 to Km 6.0 (a length of 2.80 km)\n\nThis meant that Kadamtala and Uttar Banthra were no longer in use.\n\nPassenger services on the Chanditala-Janai branch stopped between 1951 and 1963.\n\nThe rest of the HALR and HSLR closed from 1971.\n\nOnly the Howrah-Amta services were restarted in the 1990s, when the route was converted to broad gauge and electrified. There are several pairs of EMUs running on this route which has seen a major change in alignment at the Howrah end. These trains start from the main Howrah station and proceed along the main line to Kharagpur. At Santragachi, the line to Amta branches off, passes Kona which was on the old HASR and takes up the old alignment near Makardaha. A number of the old stations do not exist now.\n\nDetails of the present Howrah-Amta route via Santragachi and Kona can be seen here on this extract from the official SER map:\n\nOr here:\n\nMany older people remember these lines well although they ceased to operate by the early 1970s. The Howrah-Amta line is now a single line electrified BG line on a slightly different alignment, while there is no sign of conversion of the lines to Sheakhala and Champadanga.\n\nHere are a few old maps showing their details:\n\nThe map at the top is from the “Railway Magazine” published in Britain in the 1960s. The two other maps are from 1909. In the bottom map Sheakhala is not marked but you should be able to follow the line adjacent to the Amta line. There is also the long-vanished Tarkessur-Magra NG line.\n\nThe branches to Bargachia and Janai may not have been built when this map was prepared. But the 1960s map above is probably the best map of these lines which can be found.\n\nA summary of the history of the HALR and the HSLR is given here:\n\nhttps://wiki.fibis.org/w/Howrah_Tramways_(Light_Railways)\n\nThey have been described as the only major commuter railways on narrow gauge anywhere in the world. While the passenger traffic was heavy, continuing losses caused their closure in early 1971.\n\nTimetables from the 1944 June Bradshaw can be seen here:\n\nNote that Kadamtala was the terminus, as the Howrah municipality felt that operations from Telkul Ghat were not feasible due to congestion. By 1948 a new terminus at Howrah Maidan was built, which was in use until closure in the 1970s.\n\nThis includes part of a book which was not published. It may be of interest to some who are interested in the NWR at the time of Partition and later.\n\nIt should be noted that (essentially) the present Delhi, Ambala and Firozpur divisions fell in India and the rest of the NWR fell in Pakistan.\n\nThis is the official map from the “History of Railways” in 1937.\n\nI don’t think there was any significant change from this point to 1947, apart from realignment which shifted the junction point at Ruk to nearby Habib Kot.\n\nApart from this, part of the metre gauge Jodhpur Railway (one time Jodhpur State Railway) beyond Munabao to Hyderabad (Sind) fell in Pakistan.\n\nA similar official map from 1937:\n\nThe line from Mirpur Khas to Nawabshah via Khadro was completed later (in 1939).\n\nNote the “frontier” stations at Phulad, Chilo, Sujangarh and Kuchaman Road.\n\nRaniwara and Phalodi were terminuses then.\n\nInitially the NWR name continued to be used in Pakistan until 1961 when it became PWR and later PR. The metre gauge lines of the ex JoR were included in the NWR.\n\nIn India, the ex-NWR portions initially were a separate system called the East Punjab Railway, which soon became part of the Northern Railway. The EPR had joined the old EIR at Saharanpur and Ghaziabad.\n\nHowever, the Saharanpur-Shahdara NG line was part of neither but continued to be owned by Martin & Co (later Martin Burn) until it closed in 1970.\n\nThe remaining part of the Jodhpur State Railway in India soon became the Jodhpur division of NR, and still later in the new NWR (HQ Jaipur) which has no connection whatsoever with the old NWR.\n\n(Partition in the East was also quite complicated, so we leave that for another day).\n\nHere is the extract of the unpublished book by Ken Staynor who is no more:\n\nBreakup of the North Western Railway and the Anglo-Indian community"
