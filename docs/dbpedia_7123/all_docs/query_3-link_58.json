There is no truth behind it. All are requested to keep calm as the situation is absolutely normal and peaceful,\" said Delhi Police.\n\nAccording to locals, violence accompanied by gunshots has been reported in areas of Khyala, Nangloi, Sagarpur, Mayapuri, Kirti Nagar and Rohini among others.\n\nResidents from Kirti Nagar, Rohini, Dwarka and Rajouri Garden have reported markets being shut down, among other areas."
