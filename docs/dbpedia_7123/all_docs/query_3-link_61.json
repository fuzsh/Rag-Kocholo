The Phase III network of the DMRC includes the Magenta Line. This line links all 25 stations throughout the 38.235-kilometer route from Janakpuri (West) to Botanical Garden.\n\nThe time it takes to commute from Gurugram to Noida would also drop by half with the opening of this metro line. The Indira Gandhi International Airportâ€™s Terminal I (domestic terminal) now has a separate stop on the Magenta line with the expansion of the route to Janakpuri West.\n\nThe two new interchange facilities on the Magenta line will be operational following the opening of the second extension. One is located at Hauz Khas (on the HUDA City Centre â€“ Samaypur Badli Yellow line) while the other is from Janakpuri West (on the Dwarka â€“ NOIDA/Vaishali Blue Line). Due to the elimination of the congested Rajiv Chowk Metro station, travelers may now reach Noida from Gurugram in thirty minutes less time.\n\nStations in Magenta Line\n\nJanakpuri West to Dabri Mor to Dhasrath Puri to Palam to Sadar Bazaar Cantonment to Terminal 1 IGI Airport to Shankar Vihar to Vasant Vihar to Munirka to R.K Puram to IIT Delhi to Hauz Khas to Panchsheel Park to Chirag Delhi to Greater Kailash to Nehru Enclave to Kalkaji Mandir â€“ Okhla NSIC to Sukhdev Vihar to Jamia Millia Islamia to Okhla Vihar to Jasola Vihar Shaheen Bagh to Kalindi Kunj to Okhla Bird Sanctuary to Botanical Garden\n\nTrial of Delhi Metroâ€™s Phase III\n\nPhase III of the Delhi Metro seeks to reduce the travel time from Delhi to the NCR towns of Gurgaon and Noida by about thirty minutes.
