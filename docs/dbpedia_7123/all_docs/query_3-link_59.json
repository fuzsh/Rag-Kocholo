        "text": "New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has flagged-off the Delhi-Faridabad Metro Line that would allow hassle free travel for around two lakh daily commuters between the national capital and the industrial hub in Haryana.\n\nThe extension of the Delhi Metro connects Badarpur to Escorts Mujesar in Faridabad.\n\nThe total cost of the project from Badarpur to Escorts Mujesar is nearly Rs. 2,500 crore. Out of this, Rs. 1,557 crore was borne by the Haryana Government, the Centre contributed Rs. 537 crore, while the Delhi Metro provided Rs. 400 crore.\n\nThe nine stations in this section include, Sarai, NHPC Chowk, Mewala Maharajpur, Sector 28, Badkal Mor, Old Faridabad, Neelam Chowk Ajronda, Bata Chowk and Escorts Mujesar.\n\nbuy kamagra polo online https://lasernailtherapy.com/wp-content/themes/twentytwentytwo/inc/patterns/en/kamagra-polo.html no prescription\n\nAll these are elevated and located on either side of the Delhi-Mathura Road (NH-2).\n\n“The nine-station metro corridor which was 95 per cent indigenously built will provide people a safe, affordable, quick, comfortable, reliable, environment-friendly and sustainable transport facility,” a Haryana government spokesperson said.\n\nHaryana Chief Minister ML Khattar, addressing a press conference on Saturday, had thanked the Prime Minister for “gifting” the Metro service which would take the city to “another level of progress” with better connectivity with other NCR towns.\n\nHe had also said that the Prime Minister would be announcing the go-ahead for connecting Gurgaon with Faridabad by Metro.\n\nNEW DELHI (Metro Rail News): The Delhi Metro has started the preliminary developments for the 1st Metrolite corridor which is from Kirti Nagar-Bamnaoli village. Tenders have been floated for a topographical survey & geotechnical study work. The line would be a light rail transit system comparable to a tram.\n\nThe purpose behind this new light rail system is to reach to the fields where public transport frequency is more inferior. However, DMRC would produce fencing on multiple sides of the corridor.\n\nIf the road shared with another mode of vehicles then the Metrolite speed will have reduced as per DMRC. The 20 km corridor from Kirti Nagar-Bamnaoli Village would have twenty one stations.\n\nThe sixteen stations, of this, which is over 11.85 km will be run on the surface beside the road and five stations spread on 6.64 km would be elevated. The distance among each station would be around one km.\n\nThe corridor would have twenty-one stations with Saraswati Garden – Mayapuri bus depot – Mayapuri – Hari Nagar – Tihar Jail – Shiv puri – Dabri Village – Sitapuri extension – Mahavir Enclave & Dwarka Court.\n\nIt would be 45 metres of length with three coaches and it would operate at a speed of 60 km/h. The (LRT) Lite Rail Corridor stations would be open like bus shelters & are supposed to have an open ticketing system.\n\nDMRC official stated that the purpose is to operate as a bus transit system. The ticketing would be clear, a driver & conductor will be near to help the commuters to purchase tickets. Further, the LRT would be more reasonable than the Metro."
