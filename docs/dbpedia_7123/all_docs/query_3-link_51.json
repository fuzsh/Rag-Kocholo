        "text": "And here’s some good news for all our fellow Delhi Metro commuters! The much-awaited Mundka-Bahadurgarh section of the Green Line was inaugurated recently, which marks DMRC’s third foray into Haryana. Read on for all the deets!\n\nEverything You Need To Know | With this section, which is an extension of the Inderlok – Mundka corridor, being thrown open to the public, the Delhi Metro network has now expanded to 288 kms with 208 metro stations in total, with the Green Line itself being about 26.33 kms long. That’s so cool!\n\nThis newbie section will have 7 metro stations, out of which four will be in the Delhi and 3 in Haryana. The metro stations that’ll be in the city include Mundka Industrial Area Metro Station, Ghevra Metro Station, Tikri Kalan Metro Station and Tikri Border Metro Station, and the ones that’ll be in Haryana are Modern Industrial Estate Metro Station, Bus Stand Metro Station, and City Park Metro Station.\n\nA cool fact is that this entire stretch will be elevated and offer easy connectivity to areas like Mundka, Ghevra and Tikri Kalan. And if you’re coming all the way from Bahadurgarh, then you’ll find seamless connectivity to the capital via interchange facilities on the Blue Line (Kirti Nagar) and Red Line (Inderlok). From Mundka, every alternate train will go to Bahadurgarh City Park, with trains running at a frequency of eight minutes. With this new development, you can now travel between Inderlok or Kirti Nagar to City Park in Bahadurgarh in approx. 50 minutes!\n\nThat’s the best thing about the Delhi Metro - it never runs out of ways to surprise us and make life a tad bit easier for us! A bug thumbs up to DMRC!"
