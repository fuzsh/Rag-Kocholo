The Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) and UP Housing Board agreed on a revised 50:50 fund-sharing formula, accelerating the project with an estimated cost of Rs 1,517 crore. The strategic extension aims to facilitate seamless travel, making Sahibabad a vital interchange point between the metro and the Rapid Rail.\n\nThe state government, through GDA and UP Housing Board, will cover 80% of the costs, while the Central Government funds the remaining 20%. This multi-modal transit model aligns with the broader objective of providing efficient transportation options for NCR commuters. GDA is optimistic about securing a loan for its share, highlighting its track record of loan repayments. The extension is poised to bring substantial benefits to residents, supporting the region's growth and transportation infrastructure.\n\nGhaziabad Development Authority and Delhi propose a 5.8 km metro extension on the Delhi Metro Blue Line.\n\nThe extension aims to connect Electronic City and Vaishali. The estimated cost of the extension is approximately Rs 1,166 crore, significantly lower than previous proposals. The route will pass over NH-9 and include areas like the CISF camp, Indirapuram, Niti Khand, Gyan Khand, and Ramprastha Greens. Approval of the extension will enhance connectivity and accessibility for commuters in the region, allowing them to access both ends of the Blue Line more conveniently.\n\nDelhi Metro Blue Line: Key Information\n\nImage Source: iStock\n\n1.
