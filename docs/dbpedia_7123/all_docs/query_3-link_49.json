        "text": "Menu: News & Construction Updates | Metrolite Overview | Metro Overview\n\nInformation\n\nDelhi Metrolite project with 2 lines and 37 stations is a 40.88 km light rail transit (LRT) system proposed to be built in Delhi, India by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC).\n\nDelhi’s Metrolite lines are planned on routes where cost-intensive heavy-rail metro lines might be an overkill from a cost and engineering perspective. The system has been designed per the Government of India’s July 2019 metrolite specifications, and will be cheaper to construct and maintain due to its smaller size with lesser capacity compared to regular heavy-rail metro systems.\n\nMetrolite trains will mostly run at-grade (road level) on dedicated / fenced-in corridors and act as an excellent feeder to the Delhi Metro system.\n\nThe Detailed Project Report (DPR) for Delhi Metrolite’s Line-1 (Kirti Nagar – Bamnoli Village) was approved by DMRC’s board in October 2019. It is currently awaiting the Delhi Government’s approval.\n\nKey Figures\n\nOperational: 0 km | Under Construction: 0 km | Approved: 0 km | Proposed: 40.88 km\n\nDMRC’s Metrolite Deadline: Not Finalized (Pending Route Finalization & Approval)\n\nMy Estimated Completion: 2026 (if approved in 2021)\n\nEstimated Cost: Rs. 5,587 crore\n\nFunding Pattern: 50:50 between Govt of India (GOI) and Govt of Delhi (GNCTD)\n\nMetrolite System Specifications\n\nTrack Gauge: Standard Gauge – 1435 mm\n\nElectrification: 25 kV, 50 Hz AC OHE\n\nSignalling: Communications-based train control (CBTC)\n\nNumber of Trains: 29 (Line-1)\n\nTotal Capacity: 425 passengers\n\nNumber of Coaches: 3\n\nLength: 45m\n\nTop Speed: 60 kmph\n\nAverage Speed: 35 kmph\n\nDelhi Metrolite Route Information\n\nLine-1: Kirti Nagar – Bamnoli Village\n\nLength: 19.15 km\n\nEstimated Cost: Rs. 2,673 cr\n\nType: At-Grade (16 stations) , Elevated (5 stations, Tihar Jail – Dwarka Sector 2 section) & Underground (0 stations, underpass for main-line to be built at Mayapuri & Tihar Jail)\n\nNumber of Stops/Stations: 21\n\nStation Names: Kirti Nagar (elevated), Saraswati Garden, Mayapuri Bus Depot, Mayapuri, Hari Nagar, Mayapuri Industrial Area (MIA), Mayapuri Industrial Area 2 (MIA 2), Tihar Jail, Shivpuri (elevated), Dabri Village (elevated), Sitapuri (elavated), Mahavir Enclave (elevated), Dwarka Sector 2, Dwarka Sector 7, Dwarka Sector 6, Dwarka Court, Dwarka Sector 20, Dwarka Sector 23, Dhul Siras – Dwarka Sector 24, Dwarka Sector 25 – ECC Centre, Bamnoli Village\n\nLine-2: Rithala – Narela\n\nLength: 21.73 km\n\nEstimated Cost: Rs. 2,914 cr\n\nType: At-Grade\n\nNumber of Stops/Stations: 15\n\nStation Names: Rohini Sector 26, Rohini Sector 31, Rohini Sector 32, Rohini Sector 36, Rohini Sector 37, Barwala, Put Khurd, Bawana Industrial Area – 1, Bawana Industrial Area – 2, Bawana, Bawana JJ Colony, Sanpath, New Sanath Colony, Anaj Mandi, Narela\n\nDelhi Metrolite Route Map (Master Plan)\n\nOfficial line colors have not been announced.
