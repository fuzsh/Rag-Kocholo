        "text": "Year Month and date Event type Details Associated parts 1956 November 1 Prelude Delhi becomes a union territory of India, as a result of the States Reorganization Act of 1956.[6] Planning and research on a transportation system leading to the development of the Delhi metro begin around this time.[7] 1969 Prelude The concept of mass rapid transit for New Delhi emerges from a traffic and travel characteristics study conducted in the city. This study lays the foundation for future planning and development of the city's transit system.[8] 1984 Prelude The Urban Arts Commission proposes the development of a multi-modal transport system, which includes building three underground mass rapid transit corridors and augmenting the city's suburban railway and road transport networks. This proposal aims to address the growing transportation needs of the expanding city.[9] 1992 Prelude An attempt to privatize the bus transport system results in significant issues, including poorly-maintained, noisy, and polluting buses operated by inexperienced drivers. This leads to long waiting times, unreliable service, overcrowding, and an increase in road accidents. This outcome highlights the need for a reliable public transit solution, and would influence the development of the Delhi Metro system.[10] 1995 May 3 Early development The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) is established for the implementation and subsequent operations of the mass rapid transit system in Delhi. It is incorporated with equal equity participation from the Government of India and the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi.[11] 1996 September Early development The Union Cabinet approves the initial project, which includes three corridors. This approval marks a significant step towards the realization of a modern mass rapid transit system for New Delhi.[12] 1997 Funding Japan grants official development assistance loans to finance the first phase of the metro system. This funding is crucial in advancing the construction and development of the Delhi Metro.[12] 1998 October 1 Early development Construction works to build the rail mass transit system begin, following more than 40 years of studies.[7][13] 2002 July 19 Early development The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, recognizing the imperative need for competency building in rail-based urban transportation systems, establishes the Delhi Metro Rail Academy at the Shastri Park Train Depot. Since its inception, the Academy would play a crucial role in training over 45,000 DMRC employees, contributing significantly to the organization's functioning.[14] 2002 December 24 New line The Red Line, the inaugural line of the Delhi Metro, is inaugurated by then-Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
