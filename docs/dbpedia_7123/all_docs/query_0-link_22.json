Abstract Objective – To applies the project management on Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (DMRC) project and learns it from basic. How- To understand the project of DMRC, I travelled all entire functioning routes and try to understand the structure of metro station building. For that I went to Kaushambi metro station and observe there methodology and talk to engineers about construction of station, and convert it into program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT). Who meet? - During the project, number of questions had aroused in my mind. To solve these problems, I meet time to time from expert in particular area. I meted to Mr. Manish sir and Mr. Alok Chandra who is junior engineer at Vijay Nirman Company Pvt. Ltd. I met to Mr. Roshan Kumar, accountant at DMRC office. 8\n\n9. Project Management WHAT IS A PROJECT? Organizations perform work. Work generally could be classified into either operations or projects, although in some cases both of them may overlap. Both operations and projects share many characteristics in common like:  People perform both the activities.  Both are constrained by limited resources.  Both are planned, executed, and controlled. WHAT IS PROJECT MANAGEMENT? Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements. Project management is accomplished through the use of the following 5 processes: 1. Initiation 2. Planning 3. Execution 4. Controlling and 5. Closure The project team manages the various activities of the project, and the activities typically involve:  Competing demands for: scope, time, cost, risk, and quality.  Managing expectations of stakeholders.  Identifying requirements. The term “project management” is sometimes used to describe an organizational approach to the management of ongoing operations. This approach treats many aspects of ongoing operations as projects to apply project management techniques to them. A detailed discussion of the approach itself is outside the scope of this document. History Project management has been practiced since early civilization. Until 1900 civil engineering projects were generally managed by creative architects and engineers themselves. As a discipline, Project Management developed from several fields of application including civil construction, engineering, and heavy defense activity. Two forefathers of project management are Henry Gantt, called the father of planning and control techniques, which is famous for his use of the Gantt chart as a project management tool. The 1950s marked the beginning of the modern Project Management era where core engineering fields come together working as one. . In the United States, prior to the 1950s, projects were managed on an ad hoc basis using mostly Gantt Charts, and informal techniques and tools. . At 9\n\n10. that time, two mathematical project-scheduling models were developed. The \"Critical Path Method\" (CPM) and the \"Program Evaluation and Review Technique\" or PERT, Project Management Knowledge Areas  Project Integration Management describes the processes required to ensure that the various elements of the project are properly coordinated. It consists of project plan development, project plan execution, and integrated change control. Project Scope Management describes the processes required to ensure that the project includes all the work required, and only the work required, to complete the project successfully. It consists of initiation, scope planning, scope definition, scope verification, and scope change control.  Project Time Management describes the processes required to ensure timely completion of the project. It consists of activity definition, activity sequencing, activity duration estimating, schedule development, and schedule control.  Project Cost Management describes the processes required to ensure that the project is completed within the approved budget. It consists of resource planning, cost estimating, cost budgeting, and cost control.  Project Quality Management describes the processes required to ensure that the project will satisfy the needs for which it was undertaken. It consists of quality planning, quality assurance, and quality control.  Project Human Resource Management describes the processes required to make the most effective use of the people involved with the project. It consists of organizational planning, staff acquisition, and team development.  Project Communications Management describes the processes required to ensure timely and appropriate generation, collection, dissemination, storage, and ultimate disposition of project information. It consists of communications planning, information distribution, performance reporting, and administrative closure.  Project Risk Management describes the processes concerned with identifying, analyzing, and responding to project risk. It consists of risk management planning, risk identification, qualitative risk analysis, quantitative risk analysis, risk response planning, and risk monitoring and control.  Project Procurement Management describes the processes required to acquire goods and services from outside the performing organization. It consists of procurement planning, solicitation planning, solicitation, source selection, contract administration, and contract closeout. Processes- 10\n\n11. Traditionally, project management includes a number of elements: four to five process groups, and a control system. Regardless of the methodology or terminology used, the same basic project management processes will be used. Major process groups generally include  Initiation  Planning or development  Production or execution  Monitoring and controlling  Closing Planning Monitoring Executing and controlling Initiation- The initiation processes determine the nature and scope of the project. If this stage is not performed well, it is unlikely that the project will be successful in meeting the business’ needs. The key project controls needed here are an understanding of the business environment and making sure that all necessary controls are incorporated into the project. Any deficiencies should be reported and a recommendation should be made to fix them. The initiation stage should include a plan that encompasses the following areas: 11\n\n12.  Analyzing the business needs/requirements in measurable goals  Reviewing of the current operations  Financial analysis of the costs and benefits including a budget  Stakeholder analysis, including users, and support personnel for the project  Project charter including costs, tasks, deliverables, and schedule Planning and design- After the initiation stage, the project is planned to an appropriate level of detail. The main purpose is to plan time, cost and resources adequately to estimate the work needed and to effectively manage risk during project execution. As with the Initiation process group, a failure to adequately plan greatly reduces the project's chances of successfully accomplishing its goals. Project planning generally consists of  determining how to plan (e.g. by level of detail or rolling wave);  developing the scope statement;  selecting the planning team;  identifying deliverables and creating the work breakdown structure;  identifying the activities needed to complete those deliverables and networking the activities in their logical sequence;  estimating the resource requirements for the activities;  estimating time and cost for activities;  developing the schedule;  developing the budget;  risk planning;  gaining formal approval to begin work.  For new product development projects, conceptual design of the operation of the final product may be performed concurrent with the project planning activities, and may help to inform the planning team when identifying deliverables and planning activities. Executing- Executing consists of the processes used to complete the work defined in the project management plan to accomplish the project's requirements. Execution process involves coordinating people and resources, as well as integrating and performing the activities of the project in accordance with the project management plan. The deliverables are produced as outputs from the processes performed as defined in the project management plan. 12\n\n13. Monitoring and controlling- Monitoring and controlling consists of those processes performed to observe project execution so that potential problems can be identified in a timely manner and corrective action can be taken, when necessary, to control the execution of the project. The key benefit is that project performance is observed and measured regularly to identify variances from the project management plan. Monitoring and Controlling includes:  Measuring the ongoing project activities ('where we are');  Monitoring the project variables (cost, effort, scope, etc.) against the project management plan and the project performance baseline;  Identify corrective actions to address issues and risks properly (How can we get on track again);  Influencing the factors that could circumvent integrated change control so only approved changes are implemented Project Maintenance is an ongoing process, and it includes:  Continuing support of end users  Correction of errors  Updates of the software over time Closing- Closing includes the formal acceptance of the project and the ending thereof. Administrative activities include the archiving of the files and documenting lessons learned. This phase consists of:  Project close: Finalize all activities across all of the process groups to formally close the project or a project phase  Contract closure: Complete and settle each contract (including the resolution of any open items) and close each contract applicable to the project or project phase. Project control systems- Project control is that element of a project that keeps it on-track, on- time and within budget. Control systems are needed for cost, risk, quality, communication, time, change, procurement, and human resources. In addition, auditors should consider how important the projects are to the financial statements. 13\n\n14. Businesses sometimes use formal systems development processes. These help assure that systems are developed successfully. A formal process is more effective in creating strong controls, and auditors should review this process to confirm that it is well designed and is followed in practice. A good formal systems development plan outlines:  A strategy to align development with the organization’s broader objectives  Standards for new systems  Project management policies for timing and budgeting  Procedures describing the process  Evaluation of quality of change Project Management Triangle Scope Quality Cost Schedule Like any human undertaking, projects need to be performed and delivered under certain constraints. Traditionally, these constraints have been listed as \"scope,\" \"time,\" and \"cost\". These are also referred to as the \"Project Management Triangle\", where each side represents a constraint. One side of the triangle cannot be changed without affecting the others. A further refinement of the constraints separates product \"quality\" or \"performance\" from scope, and turns quality into a fourth constraint. The time constraint refers to the amount of time available to complete a project. The cost constraint refers to the budgeted amount available for the project. The scope constraint refers to what must be done to produce the project's end result. These three constraints are often competing constraints: increased scope typically means increased time and increased cost, a tight 14\n\n15. time constraint could mean increased costs and reduced scope, and a tight budget could mean increased time and reduced scope. The discipline of Project Management is about providing the tools and techniques that enable the project team (not just the project manager) to organize their work to meet these constraints. 15\n\n16. Introduction of DMRC DMRC is a rapid transit system in national capital region (Delhi, Gurgaon and Noida) in India. It has six lines (red, yellow, blue, green, violet and orange) with total length 189.63 kilometers 142 stations in which 35 are underground. DMRC is being built and operated by the DMRC. For track here is broad gauge and standard gauge. The train runs between 0600 to 2300 o’clock with intervals of 3 minutes. Minimum fare of DMRC is Rs 7 and maximum is Rs 29. The trains mainly have 4 coaches but due to increase in the number of passengers six coach’s trains are also added in Dilsad Garden to Rithala route.

History Delhi, national capital of India’s is one of the fastest growing cities in the world with a population of more than 1.68 crore. Continuously day by day number of vehicles increasing, accidents are happening (5 persons killed and 13 injured everyday), traffic problems generating. For solving these problems in 1970 when Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) done deep study on traffic and travel characteristics of Delhi recommended a Mass Rapid Transit Network for the city. Since then a number of studies on the subject have been carried out like the Metropolitan. 17\n\n18. Need for Metro Increasing population (1.68 crore) Growing size of cities Heterogeneous mix of Vehicles- buses, cars, Scooters, cycles Road accidents Traffic jams More pollution To meet forecast transport demand for the next generation, the number of buses will be upswing and personalized vehicles will grow. This is sure to lead to further worsening of the levels of congesting and pollution, which had already crossed acceptable limits in many part of the city. Metropolitan Transport Team (MTT) of the Indian Railways, Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and the Study Group of the Ministry of Railways. They recommended for metro corridor and dedicated bus way to meet the enlarging of traffic problems. 18\n\n19. In May 1995, DMRC was established under company act 1956. The project started on October 1, 1998. It’s a joint venture of GOI and GNCTD. In the project has four phases I, II. III & IV.

Revenue Model Every organization has there method for earning. It may be from selling their product or providing service or else. In DMRC have eight sources for revenue - 1- Selling from token 2- Selling from Smart Card (Travel Card) 3- Selling from Tourist Card 4- By advertising 5- Selling from space (for retail store, restaurants, ATM and other) 6- By Penalties 7- By movie clipping 8- By Carbon Credit 1. Token-  All tokens are single journey tokens that are valid only for a one way journey.  The minimum cost of travelling on the Metro is Rs 8  The maximum cost of travelling on the Metro is Rs 29  The value of the token will depend on the destination.  It is valid only till the day of purchase.  Token fare can be calculated by using the Fare Calculator or viewing the Fare Chart  5.5 lakh tokens are sold every day (Aprial-2011) 2. Travel Card (Smart Card)-  It is a most convenient option for the frequent commuter.  A stored value card, Travel Cards or Smart Cards are available in the denominations of Rs. 50and can be recharged in a multiples of Rs 50 to a maximum limit of Rs. 800.  Security Deposit of Rs 50 payable at purchase (refundable on return of card).  It is valid for one year from the date of purchase or one year from the date of recharge whichever is later.  There is no extra charge on renewal of Smart Card.  Over 60% of Metro passengers use smart cards on a regular basis.  DMRC has sold around 45 lakh smart cards since the Metro became operational in 2002.  DMRC sells 10,500 smart cards daily (Aprial-2011)  Highest sales recorded at the Rajiv Chowk station -around 2,500-3,000 cards are sold here each day.  Ticket Reading Machines are available at all Metro Stations. This facility helps commuters to check the balance on their Smart Card. 3. Tourist Card-  This card is for unlimited travel over short periods.  There are two kinds of cards - 1 day and 3 day. 21\n\n22.  Value of 1-Day Card: Rs 150  Value of 3-Day Card: Rs 300  Security Deposit of Rs 50 payable at purchase (refundable on return of card). 4- By advertising-  Sites are offered on first cum first serve basis.  Minimum contractual period for three months  Service tax as applicable, current service tax 12.36%  Payment on advance basis.  Inputs for display material to be provided by the client 5- By Carbon Credit- has earned Rs 2.4 crore ($ 5,42,269) from the sale of 82,000 certified emission reductions (CER) under the carbon credits scheme by the Japan Finance Carbon Ltd in 2008 and 2009. While the DMRC earned Rs 1.07 crore through the sale of 39,000 CERs for 2008, it earned Rs 1.33 crore through the sale of 43,000 CERs for 2009. 6-By Penalties –  A fine of Rs. 200-if in case any male passenger is found travelling in the reserved ladies coach of a Metro train.

Appraisal It is pleaser to say that our DMRC is profitable from its inception. Year on year profit of DMRC is increasing because number of commuters also increasing due to time saving to reach commuters and revenue has increase in last couple of year. DMRCs stations are for 6 to 8 coaches but now DMRC is planning it for 10 coaches due to drastically increasing of commuters. When master plan 2021 will be complete, it will cover mostly NCR region. More than 40% people will be travel in DMRC and it earns near about 50 crore per day. DMRC may be also first metro in the world which will be generate high profit than other world metro. After completion of master plan 2011, DMRC will be start paying its soft loan to JBIC. If we talk about Internationally Metro profit, of the 178 Metros worldwide, only four make an operating profit apart from Delhi; these are Hong Kong, Taipei, Singapore and Tokyo. It means it is DMRC revenue model is best than 174 Metros in the worlds. DMRC is earning profit from beginning of Metro. According to study of Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham), revenue earnings of the DMRC Rail Corp (DMRC) are likely to touch Rs.21 billion ($500 million) in 2011, which is near about 300% as comparison in year 2007 which was Rs.7.3 billion. Metro has a huge space in its possession; it is generating large rental revenues from outlets, malls by leasing out to domestic and overseas corporate. For every passenger who travels on the Metro, the cost is Rs 14 for the DMRC while it earns around Rs 3 crore every day from ticketing sales. A lion's share of that revenue comes from the smart cards: Rs 1.5 crore every day. According to Assocham estimates, the number of working people using the public transport system in the National Capital Region (NCR) is seven million. The figure is likely to go up to over nine million by end of 2011. DMRC is promoting for sale of Smart Card, because is more comfortable for DMRC and commuters both. Some metro like Singapore Metro there people using 100% Smart card. When DMRC started, it had six trains and made 70 trips. Today, there are 160 trains and 2,400 trips are made every day. “Beginning the journey on December 24, 2002, with 8.5 km, DMRC today has 183 km of network and connects with Noida and Gurgaon. For convenience of commuters DMRC reduce frequency time at peak hours, some route added six coaches metro also. Color Line DMRC has dedicated specific color to their route. So that people can find their destination easily. In DMRC has six line (Red, blue, green, orange, yellow, violet). 23\n\n24.

The unique feature of DMRC is its integration with other modes of public transport, changing Commuters to conveniently interchange from one mode to another. The project is accomplished with the help of both local and international contractors who are contracted to design and build the facility. To ensure dependability and safety in train operations, it is equipped with the advanced communication system and train control system in metro train. Ticket and passenger are controlling through automatic fare collection which is first time introduce in India. Trains are 24\n\n25. available at three minutes frequency. Entry and exit are controlled by smart card and tokens system. For increase ridership of DMRC, feeder buses are available at some metro stations. After all efforts a subway railway system is available in Delhi. During construction of metro line, many utilities like water pipes, sewerage lines, telephone and electric cables need to be relocated to for construction work. People also have to be relocated. When, India’s first metro project in Kolkata took more than 25 years to complete. By take a lesion through Kolkata metro, full authority given to DMRC for Recruitment, land acquisition and financial budget. For DMRC, more than 35 studies have been done on the transport problems of Delhi since 1950 – and suggested for Metro Rail for a solution in Delhi. DMRC is providing world class facilities as providing in London, Seoul and New York metro. Escalator at Inderlok Metro station 1. The station air-conditioning and ventilation system in tunnels have been planned to meet the rigorous climatic conditions of Delhi. The coaches are all air-conditioned. 2. Ticketing is fully automatic. Contact-less smart card serve the purpose of tickets for metro passengers. Supplier of Metro Train The first supplier of rolling stock was manufactured by a consortium comprising Hyundai Rotem, Mitsubishi Corporation and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation. Initial sets were built by ROTEM in South Korea. In 2002 Indian engineering firm Bharat Earth Movers Ltd (supplier of Indian railways) signed a contract with South Korean firm Rotem for manufacturing rust-proof and has fiber-reinforced interiors steel coaches within India under a transfer of technology agreement. A year later, Bharat Earth Movers (BEML) released the first rake comprising two engines and four trailer coaches. By 2005, BEML had suppled180 coaches. After that BEML continue supplying metro car. A contract has done between DMRC and Bombardier Transportation (Berlin based rail transportation equipment manufacturer) in October 2007 for supply of Metro car. Bombardier has won a $43 million contract from the DMRC. It is expected to supply end of 2011. Metro Train in India-This is a list of metro train in India 25\n\n26.

Social Benefits DMRC is the first railway project to be registered under Clean Development Mechanism of United Nations to earn carbon credits. The Metro has also giving a lesson for the social culture giving us a sense of discipline, cleanliness and enhanced multidimensional development of the place. At the same time it also reflects an image that could generate a sense of public pride, ownership and respect for the values being instilled by the new system. The DMRC Rail Corporation's (DMRC) green efforts are finally paying off. The agency has earned Rs 2.4 crore from the sale of 82,000 certified emission reductions (CER) under the carbon credits scheme by the Japan Finance Carbon Ltd in 2008 and 2009. While the DMRC earned Rs 1.07 crore through the sale of 39,000 CERs for 2008, it earned Rs 1.33 crore through the sale of 43,000 CERs for 2009. DMRC was the first railway project in the world to be registered by the United Nations under the clean development mechanism (CDM) which enabled it to claim carbon credits, wherein DMRC earns CER for the use of regenerative braking system in its rolling stock (trains), said a DMRC spokesperson. \"This was the first time in the world that the United Nations framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC) had registered a project based on regenerative braking,\" added the official. A Germany-based validation organization TUV NORD which conducted an audit on behalf of UNFCCC certified in 2009 that DMRC had stopped emission of 90,004 tons of carbon dioxide from 2004 to 2007 by adoption of regenerative braking systems in the DMRC trains. DMRC started the CDM project in September 2006. ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH & SAFETY POLICY - IMPACT ON CAPITAL DMRC also try to make healthy Delhi, for it DMRC has done some excellent task like- 1) DMRC helped save 33,000 tons of fuel and prevented the creation of over 2,275 tones of poisonous gases in the past four years. 2) During construction of metro track if DMRC has cut a tree then DMRC plant 12 new tree as a compassion of single tree, and also put a gardener for watering and safety of tree. 3) Saving environment: i) Studies conducted by the Central Road Research Institute have shown that the Metro has reduced at least 40,000 cars from being used for daily commute. ii) Metro possibly saved around 476 lives, which otherwise would have been lost due to road accidents. iii) It also helped save Rs288 crore in road maintenance and traffic management costs. 4) Mind that line: Metro has done some change in the manner in which people behave in some public spaces. Commuters stick to the yellow line as they wait for trains. 27\n\n28. 5) Saving jobs: Metro has proved to be a savior of sorts for hundreds of rickshaw operators in the city by helping at least around 20 rickshaw operators earn their living by ferrying Metro passengers, who aren’t on the feeder bus routes, to and from the stations to their homes. 6) Real estate values: Metro is also responsible for high land and buildings prices with several new projects coming up in the locality of almost every Metro station. Services Provided by DMRC 1) Free Drop Boxes at Metro Stations for Cheque- Commuters of the DMRC can pay their telephone, power and credit card bills at the Metro stations. 2) Feeder bus services: For the benefit of nearby colonies, DMRC will provide connectivity to the new stations with its GPS-enabled feeder buses. Operations & Safety by DMRC Time to time DMRC announce safety week for commuters and workers. In this week DMRC told how save yourself at emergence. Each train consists of four or more coaches and can carry up to 240 seated and 400 standing passengers. 1) The trains operate at intervals of 2.5 to 4 minutes between 6:00 to 23:00. 2) Coaches on all trains are well ventilated and air-conditioned at a temperature of 20~22°C. 3) All metro stations and trains are monitored constantly by more than 1200 closed-circuit cameras, and specially trained DMRC police are stationed at all stations and trains to deal with law and order issues. 4) Eating, drinking, smoking, and chewing of gum are prohibited in the entire system. Constant and timely automated station announcements are recorded in Hindi and English. Many stations have services such as ATMs, food outlets, cafes and convenience stores. 5) The route maps over doors and other easy-to-view places that make the journey even more easily even to the newest of travelers. Some Other Facilities Provided in Metro trains The safety features have implemented in the project is also one of the best among the worldwide metro services- 1) provide passengers with power connections inside the coaches so that they can use their laptops and charge their mobiles while they are traveling in the Metro 2) Have reduced noise levels inside the trains by using special sound absorbing system in the walls of the Metro coaches and more buffing on the Metro doors which will be better sealed by reducing the door gaps to ensure that less sound from outside enters the trains. The noise level in the underground coaches has been reduced by 8 decibels (db) as in Phase-I the internal noise levels was around 92 db which will now be only 84 db in Phase-II. 28\n\n29. 3) Have new destination sign boards in LED on one window of the side wall of each coach so that passengers can view the terminal stations while standing on the platform as some Trains may be terminating at intermediate stations depending upon operational needs. 4) Also have Closed Circuit Television Cameras (CCTVs) inside the coaches apart from cameras outside the coaches so that the driver can see the entry and exit of passengers from the train. The driver of the Metro trains will now be able to observe passenger behavior in every part of the train at all times. 5) The train will have energy absorbent couplers which can absorb shock and reduce damage to the car body structure in collisions. Other Features of New Stations {Ph.-II} The station buildings of Mansarovar Park, Jhilmil and Dilshad Garden will have several features including- 1) Separate Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) gates for entry and exit at opposite ends of stations. 2) Water-harvesting structures. 3) Close circuit television (CCTV) from the very beginning (16 at each station). 4) Two Customer Care Centers at each station. 5) Parking facilities at all stations. Metro Rolling Stock Manufacturer - An initial supplier of metro was ROTEM (formerly KOROS), Mitsubishi Corporation, and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation. The initial train sets were built at a ROTEM facility in Korea but after that BEML was supplier, but are now being built by Bombardier Transportation (Berlin based rail transportation equipment manufacturer) in Gujarat, India. Gauge – The trains run on the broad gauge (1676-mm) and standard gauge (1435). 29\n\n30. Broad Gauge of Metro Track Coaches - 3.2 meter wide coaches with lobbies that permit passengers to move throughout the length of the train. Trains currently consist of 4 coaches - two driving coaches and two trailing coaches, but now 6coaches as a trial for minimize the no of commuters at metro station (system is designed for trains with up to 8 coaches). The coaches are equipped with 3 phase AC motors, VVVF control, chevron rubber/air bag suspension system and regenerative braking system. The initial lots of 60 Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) coaches are being supplied by ROTEM of South Korea while subsequent coaches will be indigenously manufactured by Bharat Earth Movers Ltd. (BEML). Contracts had done for the delivery 240 coaches. BEML started delivery of locally assembled coach sets in August 2003, and fully locally manufactured units in January 2004. Now being built by Bombardier Transportation (Berlin based rail transportation equipment manufacturer) and expected to supply end of 2011. Metro Train Coach The coaches are made by stainless steel bodies and fiber-reinforced plastic interiors and weigh about 42-tones each coach. Metro trains are running at 80-km/h maximum speed. The nominal capacity is 44 seated and 325 standing passengers each coach (64 handles), all trains are fully air-conditioned. The trains have wide glass windows for enjoying outside site/picture and sky touching building. At metro station is equipped by automatic doors, which can be controlled by the train operator. During travel passengers can talk to driver in case of an emergency. Methodology of Construction Construction of metro station and track are is on the contract basis. DMRC allot the contract and supervise the quality control of everything.

Subways- 2 subways near Welcome and Seelampur Metro Station have been constructed to enable people staying near the existing railway tracks, on the Shahdara- Delhi Main line, to cross the tracks safely through box tunnels. The 3 meters high, 6 meters horizontal and 30 meters long boxes were inserted below the existing Northern Railway tracks without disturbing the train movement of Northern Railway. This astonishing feat was achieved in a record number of 22 days. Yamuna Bridge-The state of the art 553 meters long continuous, single pre stressed box girder, for two tracks across the river Yamuna, was completed on 2nd Feb, 2001 in a period of just 30 months by using a special technique called “Incremental Launching”. This construction technique is ideal for busy cities because it allows construction without any major disruption of traffic. Since sections advance the bridge, unlike conventionally built bridges, there are no joints and this has also ensured a smooth, bump free journey for commuters. Underground Metro-DMRC achieved its first tunnel breakthrough of Phase-II with a Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) emerging at Hauz Khas after making a 1,450 meter-long tunnel from Malviya Nagar on 31st May 2008. This TBM was lowered in Malviya Nagar shaft on December 5, 2007 and after assembly of the TBM below the ground, tunneling was started from January 4, 2008. The initial drive (60 meters) was completed in 18 days on January 21, 2008. Thereafter, the main drive was started on February 1, 2008, and the breakthrough was achieved today, about a week ahead of schedule. 33\n\n34. Mostly stations are being constructed with the ' cut-and-cover' method in areas close to surface and the tenth namely Chawri Bazaar, is being constructed by combining the ' cut-andcover' and underground tunneling. Out of the tot al 10.84 km, approximately 4 km of twin bore tunnel from Kashmere Gate to Patel Chowk is being constructed using Tunnel Boring Machines (TBM), 34\n\n35. because in most of the area the land cannot be occupied on the surface to facilitate construction by cut and cover method. Tunnel Boring Machine Tunnel for Metro Train The TBM suppliers and conditions are as follows: • Contract BC16 (Qutab Minar Line): 2 TBMs by Herrenknecht (HK) and 2 TBMs by Robbins with Mitsubishi • Contract BC18 (Qutab Minar Line): 2 TBMs by HK (Refurbished after Phase-I construction) • Contract BC24 (Badarpur Line): 4 TBMs by HK Contract AMEL-C1 (Airport Line): 2 TBMs by HK (Refurbished from C855 in Singapore) • Contract AMEL-C5 (Airport Line): 2 TBMs by Okumura Machinery Corporation Temporary shaft and Setting of Cutter face from C855 A German laser system was used to guide the TBM along its precise alignment. During the tunneling process, about 42,000 cubic meters of earth was excavated. A total of 1,210 rings, each 1.2 m. in length, were installed simultaneously along with the tunneling process. Each ring has six segments and these segments and rings are connected by using bolts. Every ring has 22 bolts 35\n\n36. to strengthen the joints and join the rings together. A total of 26,600 bolts were used in the 1,450 m long tunnel. To make the tunnel water-tight, hydrophilic gaskets were used between ring joints. Engineers used 32,065 m of hydrophilic gaskets in the tunnel. Extensive grouting was done all around the rings to avoid settlement of the ground between the top surface of rings and soil surface. TBM making a Tunnel Power Supply for DMRC Electricity supply is very important for DMRC. The system is as develop in which power supply will regular and reliable power for running electric trains in the underground Metro Corridor and on the surface Corridor. Total Power required for running trains with modern coaches on both the corridors is estimated to be 75 MW. This power will be used for running trains including auxiliary loads such as lifts, escalators, lighting, ventilation and air conditioning etc. In addition 45 MW power would be required to meet the loads for new commercial complexes planned to be built over and around MRTS stations. To ensure continuous availability of quality power for running trains on the MRTS Corridors, DMRC, have made arrangements to get 120 MW power from NTPC Thermal Power Station at Oriya Stage II. If power supply will be failure of Northern Grid, power supply to Delhi MRTS stations of underground Metro Corridor will continue to be fed from the Indra Prastha (IP) Gas Turbine Power Station. (Refer Figure 6) Power for the underground Metro Corridor will be received at 3 receiving stations of MRTS namely ISBT, New Delhi and Patel Chowk. To ensure the reliability and all time power availability for the 36\n\n37. underground Metro Corridor, 3 MRTS Power receiving stations are interconnected for transfer of power from one to another through Fire Retardant Low Smoke (FRLS) cable feeders. These receiving stations will be remote controlled from Centralized Operation Control Centre through Supervisory Control & Data Acquisition System (SCADA). In the unlikely event of total power failure, provision is made for automatic switching of emergency lighting in the tunnel and at the MRTS stations. In addition, all the trains will also have modern Ni-Cd Batteries to continue to provide lighting and air conditioning even when the train is stopped in event of complete power failure. The ventilation and air conditioning arrangements in the tunnel and the underground stations are being so designed that emergency - 23 - ventilation arrangements for the stations and tunnel will continue to be maintained from the standby Generator Sets in such exigencies. For Rail Corridor it has been planned to avail power from NTPC Thermal Power Station at three MRTS receiving stations through 400 kV, 220 kV & 66 kV extra high voltage transmission network. In the event of failure of one source, power can be fed at 25 kV side throughout the section from other two sources. However, in the event of complete collapse of NREB grid, arrangements are being planned to transfer power from ISBT receiving sub-station of Metro Corridor to Rail Corridor. Arrangements have been planned to supply power for lifts, escalators and station lighting from the stand by Generator Set provided at each station in the event of complete grid failure. 37\n\n38. Fare DMRC first time introduce in country, ticket and passenger control through automatic fare collection system. DMRC selling three type of tickets- 1-Tocken – it is valid for single journey on a day of purchase and value depends on destination. Fare for single journey range from Rs 7 to 29. 2- Smartcards-these cards are more convenient for permanent commuters. It can be recharge by Rs 50,100.200.500. Each recharge gives a discount of 10% on travel fare. 3- Tourist passes- It is available for one day or three days. For single day you have to Rs 150 in which Rs 50 is refundable or Rs 300 for three days in which Rs 50 is refundable. 38\n\n39. The tokens and cards must be used both at the entry and the exit points. Tokens are available for single journey and return tickets only. DMRC smart card DMRC single journey token Seat Reservation By the nature of its operation, compartments are not reserved for any category or person because of a large inflow and outflow of passengers at all stations at regular intervals. However, some seats have been reserved forth elderly persons, handicapped persons and ladies in each compartment. 1. Number of seats reserved for the elderly persons in each compartment - 2 2. Number of seats reserved for the handicapped persons in each compartment - 2 3. Number of seats reserved for ladies in each compartment - 4 International Certification The DMRC has been awarded OHSAS 18001 (Occupational Health and Safety Assessment sequence 18001) by Register Italiano Navale India Pvt. Ltd. (RINA), Geneva the DMRC Rail Corporation (DMRC) received the ISO 14001 certificate for establishing an environmental management system making it the First Metro in the World to receive this certification at the construction stage. Accidents AS ON July 22, 2010, E. Sreedharan’s said that 90 people have died in several accidents related to the construction of the mass transport system over last one decade in the national capital. However the construction & operation of the DMRC has seen its fair share of mishaps:  July 12, 2009: An under construction bridge collapsed during erection process near central secretariat causing five casualties and injuring the other five 39\n\n40. Bridge collapse at central secretariat • 10 Nov 2008: Man commits suicide at Janakpuri Metro Station. • Oct 19, 2008: An under construction flyover collapsed in Laxmi Nagar of east Delhi due to mechanical failure leading to death of at least two people and injuring 30. • July 18, 2008: A malfunctioning crane at a metro construction site near Ram Manohar Lohia hospital dropped a four tone iron beam on a passing Tavera car injuring two. • Jan 21, 2008: A laborer was killed at a DMRC construction site here while carrying out burrowing work. • Aug 28, 2007: A crane driver died after a concrete block fell on him due to a \"technical failure\" at a DMRC construction site in Mayur Vihar in east Delhi. • The accelerated rate of construction due to the completion of phase II before the Commonwealth games resulted in few accidents also. DMRC Video Clipping /Documentary  A book has been published about the DMRC. It was released in 2003.  DMRC has been featured and has a special mention in 2005 Bollywood film Bewafaa.  DMRC has been featured in a Discovery Channel documentary 24 Hours with the DMRC.  DMRC has been extensively shown in the 2008 Subhash Ghai film Black & White, featuring Anil Kapoor.  The DMRC is also featured in the Toronto Film Festival Production \"Amal\". Cost of Project It is important to examine cost of the projects before actually talking up its economic appraisal. The financial evaluation of project required its cash flows for the project. The investment expenditures made by the project in one of the years during its life time constitutes the purchase of capital goods, cost of acquisition of land and payments made to skilled and unskilled labor and material inputs for project construction. For all of these requirements DMRC needs big debt capital. Means of Finance This is joint venture, that’s why GOI and Delhi Government are paying 30% cost of the project, 60% from Japan bank. 40\n\n41. 1. 15% investment by the Government of India 2. 15% investment by GNCTD 3. 56% Loan from JBIC (Japan Bank for International Cooperation) 4. Remaining 8% from Interest-free Loans for land acquisition and 6% from Property Development. As urban MRT projects are mean to provide a safe, speedy and affordable mode of travel to the commuters, they have not generally been found to be financially viable in the most cities of the world, despite their large economic benefits. MRT fares cannot be fixed purely on the basis of commercial principles, without drastic decrease in ridership and defeating the very object of setting up such mass transit system. Hence, the city dwellers must necessarily supplement the contributions to be made by the system users to meet the costs of setting up. as well as running the system. Delhi being national capital and international city, the GOI and GNCTD must also contribute to meet part of these costs. It has accordingly been decided that the project will be financed by way of equity contributions from the GOI / GNCTD, soft loan from the OECF (Japan), property development revenue and certain decided levies / taxes on the city dwellers. The loan will rapid partly from surpluses from the box revenue, partly through dedicated levies / taxes in the NCT. The financial plan of the project has been approved by the GNCTD and GIO on 24.7.1996 and 17.9.19996 respectively. Table no-9 Source of Finance Percentage of Total Cost 1. Equity contribution from GOI& GNCTD 15% each 2. OECF (Japan) Loan Approx. 56% 3. Revenue from Property Development Approx. 6% 4. Subordinate Debt towards Cost and Land Approx. 8% The above financial plan is based on : Debt Equity ratio 2:1 But due to tsunami crisis, now JBIC reduce the loan for next funding, it will pay only 40% cost of the project. Economic Benefits The Delhi MRTS is essentially a \"social\" sector project, whose benefits will pervade wide sections of economy. The modified first phase will generate substantial benefits to the economy by the way of:  Time saving for commuters  Reliable and safe journey 41\n\n42.  Reduction in atmospheric pollution  Reduction in accident  Reduced fuel consumption  Reduced vehicle operating costs  Increase in the average speed of road vehicles  Improvement in the quality of life  More attractive city for economic investment and growth Summary I travelled all route of DMRC and saw the metro station structure. Metro stations are mostly near about residential area, market, and convenient for other mode of transportation. DMRC is using mostly automated system for convenient of commuters, like automated flap door, ticket reader, automated announcement, automated Metro train door, automated power supply etc. During the travel commuters are fallow the instruction and they not eat anything, young age commuters provide their seats to old person and lady. They also promote to other people. If they find any irregularity in system or any kind of problems they inform to DMRC. I visit DMRC Museum at Patel Chauk, there they putted Tunnel Boring Machine model. This is in working condition (moving). They try to explain how to come this position from beginning of the project. Metro Museum is at working station of Patel Chauk. There they put some memorable picture in the history of DMRC. I also visited Indian Rail Museum at Chankyapuri to understand Indian Railway. There they putted many kind of engine, Crain machine, old instrument which was using when before freedom. I saw a ticket of Indo-Pak journey first reservation ticket. They pasted all Railway Ministers picture. I also travelled there nano gauge train. I fully enjoyed that day. DMRC is a world class metro. For maintain their service, DMRC believe in outsourcing. DMRC is doing outsourcing for cost cutting and excellent in service. People of Delhi are generally satisfied with the services offered by DMRC and are proud of experiencing one of the most modern and world-class technological systems. DMRC is eco-friendly metro. In metro train DMRC used advanced technology for observation of sound. In metro train they used motors for generating electric. Some station DMRC planted rain harvesting system for recycling of rain water. The DMRC Rail Corporation (DMRC) received the ISO 14001 certificate for establishing an environmental management system making it the First Metro in the World to receive this certification at the construction stage. 42\n\n43. Recommendation 1. Recommendation of further research- DMRC is world class metro, a technology which is used in DMRC; it is about to couple of decades. Day by day technologies are upgrading and become more users friendly. To keep it mind DMRC also fallow the footprint of advance era. 2. Recommendation for action- I. If any organization tries to develop, it must be develop and grow by physically and economically. DMRC can increase their revenue by providing more facilities like Shopping malls at the metro station, ATM etc. II. Number of commuters drastically increases at weekend, holidays, office time and festival in summer. So DMRC should increase number of cars, so that decrease the decrease the number of people at station. III. At peak hours people have to wait for entry at station due to single check-up system. DMRC should add more security checkup booth for convenience of commuters. IV. Few metro station like Rajiv Chauk, New Delhi, Central Secretariat and Kasmeeri Gate have more rush, so some unauthorized people try to thief of wallet and jewelries. DMRC use CCTV Camera to catch up those thefts on the spot. 43\n\n44.
