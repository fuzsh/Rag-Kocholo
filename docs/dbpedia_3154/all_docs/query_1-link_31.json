        "text": "Sky Italia has launched the Sky Glass smart TV in Italy, a year after its UK debut and about a month since landing in Ireland.\n\nThe own-brand smart TV device enables viewers to receive Sky's entire offer over Wi-Fi with no satellite dish or box. Apart from Sky content, customers can also access third-aprty programming from Italian FTA DTT channels, as well as a series of popular apps including Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+ and sports streamer DAZN.\n\nThere are no official figures from Sky as to UK sales, but estimates suggest that the operator has shipped around 500,000 smart TVs, which are based on RDK technology, since launch.\n\nMeanwhile, in related news, reports suggest that Russian operator MTS plans to start selling TV sets under the Kion Smart TV brand. Sales of devices powered by the Android 11 OS will start in October.\n\nShare Story:"
