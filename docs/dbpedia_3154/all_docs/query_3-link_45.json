It is similar in many ways to Sky in the United Kingdom and Sky Ireland in Ireland, which is partly owned by 21st Century Fox, and like that network it is a major sports broadcaster. They have very high sales volume and traffic especially last hours and minutes before any sport event starts when most of their customers buying the subscriptions to watch it. We did deep performance audit and helped Sky Italia in-house development team to further optimize Magento to serve even more clients and accept even more orders on the same hardware without any issues or faults."
