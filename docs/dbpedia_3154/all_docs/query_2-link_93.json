        "text": "Streaming sports media company DAZN has confirmed that it has restructured its domestic Serie A broadcast agreement with Telecom Italia (TIM) from the 2022/23 season.\n\nDAZN secured a three-year partnership worth more than €2.5 billion (US$2.54 billion) to take over from Sky as the main domestic broadcaster for Italian soccer’s top flight from the start of the 2021/22 season. The deal left Sky with a smaller package of games, which has hurt its pay-TV business in Italy.\n\nDAZN’s agreement with the league was backed by a distribution deal with TIM, worth a reported €1 billion (US$1.02 billion) across the duration of the three-year broadcast contract, which covered up to 40 per cent of the media company’s rights fee to Serie A.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, TIM’s DAZN partnership did not reach the intended target during the first season of booking €548 million (US$558.13 million) in non-recurring provisions.\n\nNow, the reworked agreement with TIM allows DAZN to strike distribution deals with other pay-TV providers, amid reports that the UK-based media company is pursuing a deal with Comcast-owned Sky. A final agreement is yet to be reached, according to Bloomberg, though a deal could be announced as soon as this week. Financial terms have not been revealed.\n\nStay up to date with the latest sports business news and insights.\n\nSIGN UP\n\n“The agreement brings unprecedented distribution of even more unmissable live sport to an ever-increasing number of people in a simple, flexible and innovative way, putting DAZN’s business on a path to greater growth across Italy,” said Stefano Azzi, chief executive of DAZN Italy.\n\n“We are delighted to be going into the new season of Serie A in renewed partnership with TIM, laser focused on giving the fans the best experience of the sports they love.”\n\nPietro Labriola, chief executive of TIM, added: “Thanks to this agreement, the costs of this football content will be supported by multiple platforms and a more economically sustainable system will be achieved.\n\n“TIM customers will be able to continue to watch the Serie A TIM championship matches through TimVision, the richest streaming platform on the Italian market and which offers the possibility of viewing DAZN contents also on digital terrestrial.”"
