        "text": "BSkyB has confirmed its interest in buying Sky broadcasting companies in Germany and Italy, which are majority owned by 21st Century Fox.\n\nThe company said the move would \"have the potential to create a world-class multinational pay-TV group\".\n\n21st Century Fox, which is run and majority-owned by Rupert Murdoch, also controls almost 40% of BSkyB.\n\nA statement from 21st Century Fox, external confirmed the approach, but said no deal had been agreed as yet.\n\nItalian TV company Sky Italia is wholly owned by 21st Century Fox, while 55% of its German counterpart, Sky Deutschland, is owned by the American firm.\n\nA consolidated European Sky company would have approximately 20 million subscribers in total - double the amount BSkyB currently has in the UK.\n\nIf the deal goes ahead, BSkyB would have to make a takeover offer to the rest of Sky Deutschland's shareholders.\n\nThe merger could be subject to regulatory approval by European authorities.\n\nA bid by the Murdoch-owned News Corporation - since broken up into two companies, one of which is 21st Century Fox - to take full control of BSkyB was withdrawn in 2011, following a scandal over phone hacking at the company's UK newspaper group.\n\nJames Murdoch, who was BSkyB's chief executive at the time, has said previously that the company needs to \"resolve\" its European pay-TV strategy, and that having three separate firms is \"not optimal\".\n\nMr Murdoch now holds an executive position at 21st Century Fox, and is now chairman of both Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia.\n\nShares in BSkyB fell by more than 2% on news of the potential merger.\n\nMedia analyst Claire Enders says the exposure to Sky Italia is a concern for investors, due to the weakness of the pay-TV market in the country.\n\n\"The consumption power of the average Italian household is about the same as it was in 2000,\" she told the BBC."
