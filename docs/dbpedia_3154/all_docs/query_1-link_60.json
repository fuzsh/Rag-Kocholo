I would have thought especially sinch Murdoch took over in Italy knocking out Stream/telepiu that something may appear over here, even just a news channel or Rai Uno or something..\n\nProblem is I live in a massive apartment block and they only have a SKY dish and say that if I want Hotbird or suchlike it would end up costing thousands.\n\nAny info greatly appreciated.\n\nCheers\n\ng\n\n0"
