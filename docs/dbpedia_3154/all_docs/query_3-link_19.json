        "text": "Overview:\n\nSky Italia launched in 2003 following the merger of Tele+ and Stream TV, eventually merging with Sky’s businesses in the UK and Germany to benefit from common branding, technology, and content. As in Sky’s other territories, sport is a hugely important part of the company’s offering, helping to bring customers into its television ecosystem and generating significant revenues. Sky Sport now operates a range of sports-specific services, all of which are also available on the Now TV streaming platform.\n\nRights strategy:\n\nSerie A soccer and the Uefa Champions League are the pillars of Sky’s portfolio, which also includes Formula One, MotoGP and the National Basketball Association (NBA) – all of which are hugely valuable in the Italian market. Sky also has the majority of tennis and golf coverage."
