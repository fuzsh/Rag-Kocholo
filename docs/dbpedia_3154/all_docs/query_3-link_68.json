        "text": "Los Angeles/Rome (20 February 2018) – Following the highly-anticipated premiere of Gomorrah Season 3 in Italy in November, LA-based TV data analytics firm Parrot Analytics found that the series maintained its dominance into the New Year, ranking #1 in Italy in January 2018. When it premiered, the highest-recorded demand for the series was 25% more than the same period for Season 2. Sky Italia retained Parrot Analytics, which created the only global, real-time, platform-agnostic TV Demand Measurement System, to quantify audience demand and provide competitive analysis for Gomorrah and Sky Italia’s stable of original and acquired shows.\n\nAccording to Parrot Analytics, comparisons to other show and genre averages in Italy illustrate just how big a success Gomorrah is for Sky Italia. In January Gomorrah had seven times the demand of competing crime drama Suburra. Gomorrah has sold in over 190 territories. Parrot Analytics gave the series a travelability index of 4.5% given its popularity in markets outside Italy, like France and Tunisia, which is 6.9 times that of the average Italian content. The third season of the series just premiered on Sky in the UK on January 31 and will launch on Sky in Germany next March 6.\n\n“Gomorrah is for us the perfect example of how a local story can go global and establish a worldwide presence, thanks to high-quality writing, directing, acting and producing. And Parrot’s data and analyses prove it very clearly. Tools like this allow us to muster the kind of market intelligence needed to make better, more informed content acquisitions and development decisions,” said Nils Hartmann, Head of Original Production, Sky Italia. “Competition is fierce now, so having data on what is resonating with our audiences is crucial to our efforts to create the strongest possible content offering.”\n\n“We are working with Sky Italia to help them better understand the popularity of their commissioned and acquired content so that they have a keen understanding of the value of their programming,” said Courtney Williams, European Director, Parrot Analytics. “By utilizing our Audience Demand Measurement System, they will be able to make more informed programming and marketing decisions across their offerings.”\n\nTravelability is the demand a title (or catalogue of titles) has in an international market, as a percentage of its home market demand.\n\nAbout Parrot Analytics\n\nParrot Analytics is the leading global content demand analytics company for the multi-platform TV business.
