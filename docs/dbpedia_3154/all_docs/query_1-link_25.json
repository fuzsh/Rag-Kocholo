        "text": "Several banks interested in participating in potential deal\n\nSky Italia thought to have 4.2 million subscribers\n\nItaly’s top-flight soccer league is considering a bid to acquire pay-TV broadcaster Sky Italia, according to multiple reports.\n\nLa Stampa was first to report Serie A’s interest in acquiring the Comcast-owned broadcaster, with the league reportedly keen to leverage Sky’s infrastructure, organisation and customer base to build its own Serie A TV channel.\n\nA subsequent report from Reuters states that Serie A has made an internal preliminary analysis of a potential deal, with the possibilities of buying a majority stake in the broadcaster or a smaller part of Sky’s operations under consideration.\n\nAccording to La Stampa, several banks, including JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Barclays and Citi, have expressed interest in partnering with Serie A to bid for Sky, which has been owned by Comcast since 2018. Reuters reports that the pay-TV network has 4.2 million customers in Italy, with almost half subscribing to its sports services.\n\nWhen asked about La Stampa’s story, Serie A president Lorenzo Casini did not rule out a possible bid, telling reporters that “there is nothing concrete on the table at the moment”.\n\nThe report came as Serie A’s 20 clubs met to discuss the interest from multiple banks and private equity firms in investing in its media business. According to Reuters, no decision was reached during the meeting on Monday, with officials set to gather again later this month.\n\nPrior to this week’s meeting, Napoli owner Aurelio de Laurentiis and Gerry Cardinale, who heads up the RedBird Capital Partners investment firm which owns AC Milan, both voiced their disapproval of plans to sell stakes in Serie A’s media rights business.\n\nThe discussions are taking place as Serie A prepares to go to market with its domestic media rights for the cycle starting from 2024/25. Sports streaming subscription service DAZN currently holds the lion’s share of the rights in a €2.5 billion (US$2.9 billion) deal, but its coverage has been mired by technical issues.\n\nWhile DAZN is currently the league’s main broadcast partner, Sky does hold a package of games, showing three fixtures per round as part of a deal reportedly worth €262.5 million (US$278.93 million) over three years.\n\nSportsPro says…\n\nIf financially viable, acquiring Sky could make sense for Serie A and would be more in line with the stance of de Laurentiis, who has voiced his desire for the league to produce its own content. Sky’s vast infrastructure would certainly allow Serie A to do that, as well as allowing the competition to tap into a sizeable subscriber base."
