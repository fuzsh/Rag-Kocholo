        "text": "Sky Complex boasts an enviable location. Housed in one of Milan’s upcoming business districts, Milano Santa Giulia, and adjacent to the Rogoredo high-speed rail station, the office development is just 7.5 kilometres from the Milano Linate Airport. The complex comprises three main buildings and a connection known as The Link, with a total NLA of 913,5641 sq ft. Buildings 1 and 2 were completed in 2008 and Building 3 was completed in 2015. All three office buildings have Grade A office building specifications and are LEED Gold certified. The buildings are designed in accordance with energy saving criteria and high use flexibility.\n\nBuilding 1 and 2 are fully leased to Sky Italia, a subsidiary of Comcast Corporate – one of the world’s largest broadcasting and cable television companies by revenue, with an annual rental review pegged to The Italian National Institute of Statistics consumer price index variation. Building 3 is currently under reinstatement works and will be redesigned for multi-tenancy use."
