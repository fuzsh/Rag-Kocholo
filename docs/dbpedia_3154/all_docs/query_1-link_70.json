        "text": "Sky Italia, one of the largest media companies in Italy, with more than 4.8 million platform subscribers, faced a significant technical challenge when it made the decision to transcode its full catalogue (more than 5,000 videos) in high definition. The situation was not complex only for the fact that the operation would have required four times the amount of CPU used for standard videos, but also because of the rather aggressive timelines: the project had to be completed in the span of just a few weeks. Sky Italia therefore needed a new resource as part of its infrastructure in order to be able to meet the timeline: the company selected Go Reply, a Google Premier Partner, and the Google Cloud Platform.\n\nThe solution identified is fully effective and economical, while meeting the necessary security requirements. Instead of installing extra hardware, a new transcoding capability was put in place: Sky Italia and Go Reply developed a public cloud and an on-premise hybrid HD transcoder. The solution was then optimised thanks to the use of Custom Machine Types that respond quickly to demand peaks without the need for over-provisioning, and to more economical preemptible VMs, guided by a Go Reply API which manages the end-to-end process, calculating the availability and balancing the preemptible VMs with the standard instances. The preference for the Google platform is based on the fact that it was the only one to offer direct peering, which provides additional bandwidth capable of ensuring a secure micro-segmentation of the video during transfer to the cloud. The project was thus implemented, making it possible to archive the full Sky Italia catalogue in just one week instead of a month."
