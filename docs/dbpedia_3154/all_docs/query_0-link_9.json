        "text": "Sky Italia on Monday unveiled a major reorganization following former programming head Andrea Scrosati’s departure to take on the role of group COO of Fremantle Media in London.\n\nNicola Maccanico will take on the new role of executive vp programming, becoming the top content executive of the Italian arm of pay TV giant Sky, which is now controlled by U.S. cable giant Comcast. For now, he will also continue to serve as CEO of Sky Italia’s cinema distribution arm Vision Distribution.\n\nIn his new position, Maccanico will oversee cinema and entertainment for Sky Italia. Department heads Margherita Amedei (Sky Cinema), Luisa Borella (business and acquisitions), Antonella Dominici (pay per view and on demand), Nils Hartmann (original productions) and Luca Revelli (partner channels and digital) will now report directly to Maccanico.\n\nUnder Scrosati, Sky Italia became an international player in co-productions, commissioning series including Paolo Sorrentino’s The Young Pope, Stefano Sollima’s Zero Zero Zero and most recently George Clooney’s Catch-22. Maccanico is expected to further the Sky Italia brand as competitors including Netflix and Amazon increase their Italian content following the approval of European Parliament quota guidelines on streamers.\n\nMaccanico has been with Sky Italia since its launch in 2003. In 2004, he joined Warner Bros. Pictures as marketing director, helping to make WB the leading Italian distributor. Since January of last year, Maccanico has served as CEO of Vision Distribution. As head of Vision, Maccanico has overseen 16 productions in less than two years, including Riccardo Milani’s box-office hit Come un gatto in tangenziale.\n\nSky Italia has also promoted Antonella d’Errico to the role of vp Sky branded channels, also reporting directly to Maccanico. Formerly director of Sky Italia’s free-to-air channels, TV8 and Cielo, she will now help to lead growth of the company’s pay entertainment channels.\n\nWith the reorganization, Sky Italia will also focus on growing advertising across its free-to-air channels, which will move from the programming division to the Sky Media, Digital & Data department, led by Remo Tebaldi. He will focus on building advertising synergies across channel contents. Viviana Pellegrini will also join the Sky Media, Digital and Data department, as head of entertainment and sports brands."
