Chorus

Sundance Film Festival

Director: François Delisle

Chorus is shot in a dreary black and white that underlines the turmoil with which Irène (Fanny Mallette) and Christophe (Sébastien Ricard) have suffered for 10 years, since the disappearance and presumed death of their son in Quebec. This drama begins with pedophile Jean-Pierre Blake (Luc Senay) detailing the circumstances under which he encountered their son, Hugo (Mathias Roussier), later to have repeatedly sexually abused and killed the boy. Upon Jean-Pierre’s confession, authorities let Irène and Christophe know of the discovery. They have both been coping with the guilt and weight of Hugo’s disappearance—Irène through Medieval polyphonic choral singing; Christophe through the serenity of the beach in México. Once they reunite, they must not only confront the disturbing truth of the nature of Hugo’s death but also face each other as former partners/lovers broken apart. The bleak and jagged contour of Irène’s and Christophe’s interaction and struggle to help each other while legally and logistically processing Hugo’s remains is a gripping experience. Irène’s bittersweet closure alongside Christophe’s neutered manhunt unfolds viscerally and elicits camaraderie and hope for them to move on and heal each other’s wounds—all on account of brilliant, moving performances from Mallette and Ricard. The ending is a bummer but most certainly not a letdown—and the Medieval polyphonic interludes invoke a transcendent tone peppered throughout the film for viewers to emote alongside the characters. See this film at any chance! –Alexander Ortega
