Born in Montreal in 1967, François Delisle began his career by making short films between 1987 and 1991. His first feature, Ruth (1994), had critics raving and made a name for the director in Canada and Europe. In 2003, after founding his production company Films 53/12, he produced his second film, Happiness is a Sad Song (2004), which won several awards and brought him international acclaim. His next two films, You (2007) and Twice a Woman (2010), had a similar reception. The Meteor (2013) and Chorus (2015) screened at the Sundance and Berlin festivals. Both films were major international hits, screening at festivals and theaters in many countries around the world. In 2019 and 2020, Delisle directed Cash Nexus, his seventh feature, and then CHSLD, a documentary short about his mother in her twilight years. For over 30 years, François Delisle has been exploring the human condition through a personal, uncompromising cinema.
