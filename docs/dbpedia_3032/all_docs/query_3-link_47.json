Wavering between the reality of a bygone era and the prospect of a frightening future, this anticipation film is constructed mainly from a succession of still images and supported by a narrative framework imbued with a sensitivity intimately linked to characters. He thus appeals simultaneously to the formal properties of cinema, photography and literature to propose a fable on the Anthropocene.",
