This, despite the fact that his latest feature, Chorus, revolves around an estranged couple coping with news of the death of their son, who disappeared a decade earlier at eight years old.\n\nIt’s all a matter of perspective, the Quebec writer-director explained.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nFrançois Delisle's songs of solace (with video) Back to video\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\n“If you go to (mainstream) movies, there’s a death every 30 seconds,” he said, last week, seated in the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve offices of his company, 53/12 Films. “In my movie, there’s one death, and it happened 10 years ago. I come along with this little film in black and white, talking about the loss of a child, and build a whole drama around it.”\n\nHardship befalls everyone, Delisle argued; while the situation in which he places his characters may be on the extreme side, pain is something we can all relate to. In providing his protagonists with a way through their difficulties, he hopes his film offers a glimmer of a light in the darkness.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nThere with you then.

It’s something we want to ignore. It’s replaced with consumption — iPhones and iPods.\n\n“Broaching a topic like this, for me, is a sign of vitality. I’m an artist who wants to talk about the reality of life, to shake up viewers and make them uncomfortable for a time. That’s what I like in cinema. When I see a play or a film, I want to live the experience and have a direct rapport with the person who made it.”\n\nDelisle’s story is not autobiographical, nor is it based on anyone he knows; but it is meant to get to the heart of real human emotions and experience. He prioritizes emotion above plot: Chorus is not about any great mystery to be solved, but about slow shifts in the internal landscapes of his traumatized characters.\n\nHis previous film, Le météore, was an expressionistic reverie about the intimate bonds between a prison inmate serving a 14-year sentence for hit-and-run, his ex-girlfriend and his mother. Acclaimed at various international festivals, it paved the way for Chorus, which has already received praise at both Sundance and Berlin film fests.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“I make personal cinema,” Delisle said. “I raise questions that affect me, first, and I hope they’re pertinent for my audience. They’re not inaccessible films. Even Le météore had a human foundation that was universal.\n\n“I try to be authentic. (Chorus) is a frank proposition. I don’t couch what I’m trying to say. In life, it would be unbearable to be so intense; but in my métier as a filmmaker, I see a movie as a prise de parole. I don’t take it lightly. I prefer to speak about things that are important to me rather than pretend that everything is fine.”\n\nChorus stars Fanny Mallette as Irène, who has been living in limbo since her son’s disappearance, burying herself in her music — she sings in a professional choir. Sébastien Ricard (the actor and rapper, of Loco Locass fame) plays Christophe, her ex, who has relocated to Mexico, where he lives a rustic life by the beach, at a safe remove from reality. When Irène calls him with the news about their son, the two are forced to face one another and the trauma of their past. It is in this shared experience, in the reunion of two broken people, that Delisle saw the heart of his narrative.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“Living is learning to lose,” he said. “The more we live, the more we learn about the things we must let go of. That’s what makes us human. These characters must learn to let go of their son. It’s not a scar that heals so they can walk off, hand-in-hand; the wound closes and the scars remain. It’s like when you see a big whale come out of the water, one of those old whales that are all beat up. People are a bit like that.”\n\nMusic is integral to the process, from the serenity of the choir scenes in which Irène temporarily escapes from the soul-crushing mundanities of her daily existence, to a transformative moment, late in the film, featuring a performance by Montreal electro-rock act Suuns.\n\n“Music may be the most beautiful thing humans make,” Delisle said. “(My characters) use music to forget the present, to enter another dimension.”\n\nWhich leads us to the film’s title. The director pointed to a link between musical movements and life’s transitions. Ultimately, his film’s characters find salvation in their ability to fall into step with one another, if only for a short time.\n\n“Chorus, in French is coeur, like a beating heart,” Delisle said. “The whole film is built on coming and going, black and white, hot and cold, man and woman. The characters begin all out of sync, experiencing things separately. Then there’s a moment in the film where, poof, they’re experiencing things together, at the same time, and they’re very close; then they separate again. To me, those movements are important.”\n\ntdunlevy@montrealgazette.com\n\ntwitter.com/tchadunlevy\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network"
