The Festival takes place January 17-27 in Park City, Salt Lake City, Ogden and Sundance, Utah.\n\nTrevor Groth, Director of Programming for the Sundance Film Festival, said, “I couldn’t be more pleased to announce the films selected for these sections because they illustrate the tremendous creativity and vibrancy of the independent film community. Spotlight features our favorite films that have premiered at other festivals and the Park City at Midnight and New Frontier sections are comprised of films that are bound to shock, intoxicate, derange or dazzle. Expect the unexpected when you venture down the path of these cinematic sensations.”\n\nThe 2013 edition of New Frontier will showcase films, media installations, multimedia performances, transmedia experiences and panel discussions that explore the convergence of film, art, new media technology and storytelling. 2013 will mark the seventh year of New Frontier, which will again take place at The Yard (1251 Kearns Blvd.) in Park City. Admission to the venue is free.\n\nShari Frilot, Sundance Film Festival Senior Programmer and curator of the exhibition, said, “The 2013 edition of New Frontier is an exhibition of works that immerse audiences within moving image environments, including full-dome and wrap-around films, augmented reality experiences, 3D projection mapped environments, and data-moshed hip hop performances. The work by this year’s artists disorient time and space, and provoke a reconsideration of how we might cohere the fibers of our bodies with the realities of life on the digital frontier.”\n\nIn addition to those announced today, films in the U.S. and World Competition and NEXT <=> sections have been announced. Films for the Premieres and Documentary Premieres sections have not yet been announced.

Shot on location in Detroit, Michigan, and Marfa, Texas, this unique film features fantastic performances by Ben Foster, Stella Schnabel, and Sue Galloway, and a soundtrack by Marfa local punk band Solid Waste.\n\nPulse Index\n\nArtist: Rafael Lozano-Hemmer\n\nRafael Lozano-Hemmer’s beautifully resonant, interactive media installation swaths the central lounge of New Frontier with images of the warm, breathing flesh of its visitors. Pulse Index records the heart rates and fingerprints of participants and exhibits them in a beautiful Fibonacci pattern. Place your finger into the custom-made sensor, and your fingerprint appears on the largest cell of the display, pulsating to your heartbeat. Your print then travels down the sequence to join those of all the others who have visited the room, immersing the community space with the radiant glow of the human touch.\n\nWhat’s He Building in There?\n\nArtists: Klip Collective\n\nRicardo Rivera and the Klip Collective transform the entire front of the New Frontier venue into an interactive, 3-D projection-mapped parable, inspired by the Tom Waits song.

Use the X-ray flashlight to peek at what he is up to.\n\nThe Sundance Film Festival®\n\nA program of the non-profit Sundance Institute®, the Festival has introduced global audiences to some of the most ground-breaking films of the past two decades, including sex, lies, and videotape, Maria Full of Grace, The Cove, Hedwig and the Angry Inch, An Inconvenient Truth, Precious, Trouble the Water, and Napoleon Dynamite, and through its New Frontier initiative, has showcased the cinematic works of media artists including Isaac Julien, Doug Aitken, Pierre Huyghe, Jennifer Steinkamp, and Matthew Barney.
