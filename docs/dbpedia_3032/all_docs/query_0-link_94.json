        "text": "John Nein was not always a Senior Programmer at the Sundance Film Festival — it’s only been eight years. When he began at Sundance in 2002 he was always\n\nwatching movies of course. More than that, like John Cooper said, he just didn’t shut up when he was in the room; he was opinionated and spoke his\n\nopinions. He also always liked international cinema as he was born in Ireland and grew up in The Netherlands, Belgium and London where his father worked\n\nfor international companies. When he was 12 he came to the U.S.\n\nThe programmers at Sundance do not have a strict formal assignment of areas they program; they see all the films of all the sections, but like his father,\n\ninternational was always of great interest. The same is true for myself, although out of the 118 feature films selected out of 4,105 feature length\n\nsubmissions, many of the U.S. films look great to me as well. For instance, I am so happy that Matt Sobel’s “\n\nTake Me To The River\n\n” which won the prize at US in Progress this past November in Wroclaw, Poland at The American Film Festival is in the NEXT section.\n\nJohn:\n\nThis year on Day One, January 22, 2015, the Festival will feature\n\none of each type of film shown at the Festival: one shorts program, a\n\nU.S. documentary, a\n\nU.S. dramatic, an international documentary and an international\n\ndramatic which will be the first ever Lithuanian film in Competition, a\n\nlesbian love story\n\nthat is stylish and smartly directed by Alanté Kavaïté with two\n\nfantastic actors, Julija Steponaitytė and Aistė Diržiūtė. Actually “ The Summer of Sangaile” is a coproduction\n\nof Lithuania, France, and Holland . I think Alanté lives in France.\n\nThere ares 29 countries represented and 45 first-time filmmakers.\n\nSydney:\n\nI know the Chileans love Sundance. Last year Alejandro Fernández Almendras\n\nsaid in our interview about “To Kill a Man” that Sundance is very important for Chile. I am also a longtime fan of Sebastian Silva since “The Maid”. Two\n\nyears ago he had two films, “Crystal Fairy” and “Magic, Magic” in Sundance, so why is this Chilean film not in World Competition but in NEXT?\n\nJohn:\n\nI’m glad Alejandro said that. Yes we like Chile too. They make many good films. But “Nasty Baby” by Sebastian Silva is a U.S. film, about people\n\nliving in Brooklyn.\n\nHe lives in U.S. and has spent a lot of time here. He knows\n\nBrooklyn and yet his curiosity and his view of it is that of an\n\noutsider. He knows these people\n\nbecause he watches and listens so well. “\n\nSydney:\n\n“Bridesmaids” star and co-writer Kristen Wiig stars. A short promo of “Nasty Baby” was\n\nshown to buyers while it was in post-production in Cannes and Toronto.\n\nThe Chilean\n\nproduction company of Juan de Dios Larrain and Pablo Larrain, Fabula,\n\nproduced “No” as well as Sebastian’s later films. Papi Boye and Violaine Pichon’s\n\nproduction and international sales agent Versatile\n\nout of France along with the film’s international sales agent Funny\n\nBalloons — also based in France — helped finance this U.S. Production.\n\nJohn:\n\nWorld Cinema is now 10 years old. Overall, the Competition sections\n\nhave evolved over the years. We have a sense of emerging directors here.\n\nWe have come\n\nof age.\n\nAll our films are of emerging filmmakers. Either first time\n\ndirectors or highly anticipated second or third features. Of all the\n\nfestivals worldwide,\n\nSundance has the strongest program of emerging talent. Watch these\n\nfilmmakers over the next years. Like “Homesick” by Anna Sewitsky. Her previous film “Happy, Happy”\n\nshowed\n\nat Sundance in 2011 and took the Grand Jury Prize for World Cinema.\n\n“Happy, Happy” also became the Norwegian Official entry for the Academy\n\nAwards® .\n\nSydney:\n\nTrustNordisk sold “Happy, Happy” to more than 50 countries, so they must be poised to sell this one as well.\n\nJohn:\n\nBut not all the second and third films are from filmmakers whose first films were at Sundance, although Canada’s “ Chorus” director Francois Delisle showed “The Meteor”\n\nat Sundance two years ago.\n\nAnd “Glassland”, was a very anticipated second film. The first film\n\nby director and screenwriter, Gerard Barrett, “Pilgrim Hill” won\n\nthe Galway Film Festival and was very sought after and was signed with a U.S. agent then. “Sangaile” is also a second feature.\n\nLook at the international films in the Premieres section and you will see some international filmmakers there, like “ Brooklyn” which is an\n\nimmigrant story directed by John Crowley and written by Nick Hornby whose film “Wild” is now playing .\n\nSydney:\n\nI see from IMDbPro that Hanway has already sold\n\nMiddle Eastern rights to Front Row Entertainment who must have pre-bought “Brooklyn” in Cannes or Toronto.\n\nJohn:\n\nOf the 12 films in World Cinema the less expected films come from Turkey, “Ivy” by the talented director Tolga Karacelik. This is his second film. His first was\n\n“Toll Booth” which Global Initiative distributed in the U.S. The DP on this was Nuri Bilge Ceylan (“Winter’s Sleep”)’s DP on “Winter’s Sleep”, Gökhan Tiryaki. It is about guys stuck on a freighter whose company\n\ngoes bankrupt. Power dynamics play out.\n\nSydney:\n\nHave there been Oscar nominated films in Sundance (Aside from “Whiplash” and “Boyhood”)?\n\nJohn:\n\nYes, “Man on Wire” was not last year but it was\n\nforeign. “Ida” was in\n\nSpotlight last year and maybe Sundance increased its visibility. Three others were in Sundance last year:\n\n“To Kill a Man” is\n\nChile’s submission, “Difret” which won the\n\nAudience Award is Ethiopia’s submission this year and “Liar’s Dice”\n\nfrom India was in World Competition last\n\nyear. It is a very artful film. We knew it would do well with the\n\ncritics, but it did extremely well with the audience too. A couple of\n\nfilms in Spotlight\n\nwill probably be nominated next year. Watch for them.\n\nSydney\n\n: We haven’t even discussed the World documentaries.\n\nJohn\n\n: Are there any that stand out for you?\n\nSydney:\n\nYes, “Chuck Norris vs. Communism”, from U.K., Romania\n\nand Germany. Chuck Norris?\n\nJohn:\n\nHow interesting it is that something like Chuck Norris means\n\nsomething very different to others. It is a sign of cultural differences\n\nbetween us. Chuck\n\nNorris shows how independent films built a community of counter\n\nculture against an authoritarian government.\n\nSydney:\n\nI also notice that there are six docs from the U.K. Out of 12 films.\n\nJohn:\n\nYes we noticed and discussed that. U.K. really supports documentary filmmaking. Great work is coming out of the U.K. And many of the films are about\n\ndifferent countries, so it doesn’t fit so simply into a U.K. pigeon hole.\n\nSydney\n\n: Yes I see “Chuck Norris” is about Romania, “Dreamcatcher” is about teenage prostitution, “How to Change the World” is about Greenpeace, “Listen to Me\n\nMarlon” is about a famous U.S. actor, “The Russian Woodpecker” is about a Ukrainian survivor of Chernobyl.\n\nThank you John for your insights. I think we have a lot to look at here. Thank you for taking this time to talk with me. See you at Sundance!\n\nFor a full list thus far of Sundance films, see below.\n\nU.S. DRAMATIC COMPETITION\n\nAdvantageous\n\n/ U.S.A.
