        "text": "Montréal, September 28, 2010 – Telefilm Canada is proud to support to the 39th edition of the Festival du nouveau cinéma (FNC). For more than 20 years, Telefilm has partnered with this highly colourful event, which stands out for the variety of its cinematographic offering, its many world premieres, and its innovative nature.\n\nThe opening film, director Podz’s 10 1/2, finance by Telefilm, is only one example of the FNC’s ability to scoop the rest of the festival circuit. As for the FNC’s closing event, festival-goers will be treated to a screening of Denis Côté’s latest feature, Curling, also financed by Telefilm.\n\n“The FNC is a major event on Montréal’s cultural scene, and very popular with audiences as well as the industry,” stated Sheila de La Varende, Telefilm Canada’s Director of National and International Business Development. “It is synonymous with the discovery of films in all their variety and also serves as a fruitful gathering-place for industry talent from here and elsewhere. This year, we’re especially proud of the Canadian representation, with Canadian movies both opening and closing the Festival. Telefilm also salutes the FNC’s spirit of innovation, evident in its parallel activities, including those that explore new digital methods of film production, promotion and broadcasting.”\n\nTelefilm also congratulates all the Canadian films selected to screen at the Festival, which runs from October 13 to October 24, 2010.\n\nCanadian films presented at the FNC (*denotes films funded by Telefilm Canada)\n\nTitle – Category Director\n\nOpening Film\n\n10 ½*\n\nDaniel Groulx (Podz)\n\nClosing Film\n\nCURLING*\n\nDenis Côté\n\nInternational Competition\n\nJO FOR JONATHAN*\n\nMaxime Giroux\n\nCanadian Competition (FOCUS)\n\nVOUS N’AIMEZ PAS LA VÉRITÉ\n\nPatricio Henriquez\n\nA NIGHT FOR DYING TIGERS*\n\nTerry Miles\n\nL’AFFAIRE KATE LOGAN*\n\nNoël Mitrani\n\nAFFINITY POINT\n\nJason Pitre\n\nALUKU LIBA\n\nNicolas Jolliet\n\n2 FOIS UNE FEMME*\n\nFrançois Delisle\n\nFALARDEAU\n\nHerman Guttierez\n\nFATHERS AND SONS*\n\nCarl Bessaï\n\nLA FILLE DE MONTRÉAL\n\nJeanne Crepeau\n\nJALOUX\n\nPatrick Demers\n\nKING OF THE L’EST\n\nSimon Gaudreau\n\nOLIVER SHERMAN*\n\nRyan Redford\n\nSNOW AND ASHES\n\nCharles-Olivier Michaud\n\nSAUVAGE\n\nGuillaume Sylvestre\n\nSIMPLEMENT NOUS\n\nDavid Tousignant & Tomi Grgevic\n\nTemps Zéro\n\nTERRITOIRES*\n\nOlivier Abbou\n\nSpecial Screening\n\nL.A.
