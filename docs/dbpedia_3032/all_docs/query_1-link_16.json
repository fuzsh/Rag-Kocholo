        "text": "Date: 2012\n\nSize: 20 x 30 inches\n\nArtist: Lepine, Sebastien\n\nSébastien Lépine is a multi-media artist, designer, and artistic director based in Montreal. His creative pursuits span different mediums including poster art, album artwork, movie posters, video projections for live shows, and music video clips. He has been working as an independent artist since graduating from the graphic design program at Université du Quebec à Montreal in 2000.\n\nLépine’s poster art is characterized by the use of a technique evocative of photomontage: he overlays images and text, creating a striking interplay of transparencies and negative space. A constant stream of music fuels his creative imagination which translates into the vibrant energy found in his poster art.\n\nLe Météore (The Meteor) is François Delisle's exploration of external and internal time with the story of a forty-year-old man enduring a fourteen-year-long prison sentence through a collection of narratives, including his own as well as his family members'. This silkscreen poster was hand-printed by the artist himself and is in excellent condition."
