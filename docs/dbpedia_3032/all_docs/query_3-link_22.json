        "text": "It’s tricky to build movies around insufferable characters — and writer-director Francois Delisle’s third feature fails to make even its heroine’s myriad faults interesting. “You” (“Me, Me, Me” would be more apt) stars Anne-Marie Cadieux as a glam, moody Montreal woman who abandons husband and child for a lover, yet still feels “empty.” Offering scant insight into a dislikable central figure, this drama has little appeal beyond some labored sex scenes. It opened on Quebec screens Aug. 31, just after its Montreal fest premiere; wider travel seems unlikely.\n\nMichele (Cadieux) has grown coldly distant from spouse Paul (Laurent Lucas) and is a neglectful, disinterested mother to 8-year-old Manu (Raphael Dury). Ostensible reason is Thomas (Marc Beland), with whom she has frequent, vigorous if unconvincing coitus. (The actors kiss like guppies gasping for air — is faking a little tongue so hard?) But when she leaves her distraught family, she “feels trapped” with Thomas, too. Is Michele suffering a midlife crisis? A nervous breakdown? Pic provides no clue, leaving auds stuck with a bitterly self-absorbed, shallow protag whose hold over men seems inexplicable. Package is OK, if visually rather drab."
