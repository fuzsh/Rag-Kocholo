Then imagine that you are in the city's downtown core and a woman holding a small video camera approaches you. She asks you to participate in a one-question survey. Although you are slightly wary of this proposal, you stop to listen. She asks you: \"What does happiness mean to you?\" and awaits your answer. (imdb)"
