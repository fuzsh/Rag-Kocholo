        "text": "Date: 2015\n\nSize: 24 x 36 inches\n\nArtist: Lepine, Sebastien\n\nSébastien Lépine is a multi-media artist, designer, and artistic director based in Montreal. His creative pursuits span different mediums including poster art, album artwork, movie posters, video projections for live shows, and music video clips. He has been working as an independent artist since graduating from the graphic design program at Université du Quebec à Montreal in 2000.\n\nLépine’s poster art is characterized by the use of a technique evocative of photomontage: he overlays images and text, creating a striking interplay of transparencies and negative space. A constant stream of music fuels his creative imagination which translates into the vibrant energy found in his poster art.\n\nThis poster was made for an event featuring a screening of six of Francois Delisle's films over the span of three days. Montrealer Delisle claims \"I like to shake things up a bit by transforming everything into fictional material. Fiction is how I express myself… I only delved into reality to use the filmed material and real-life experiences as the raw materials for screenwriting.\"\n\nThis silkscreen poster was hand-printed by the artist himself and is in excellent condition."
