        "text": "by Christina Yeager\n\n​Christina Aguilera was able to make her dreams come true as an aspiring singer. Eventually turning out tunes like “What A Girl Wants,” “Genie In A Bottle” and “Beautiful” after a stint on a popular Disney show as a teen. She also served as a judge of the well-known reality singing show “The Voice.” Christina Aguilera is an award-winning songwriter and singer who was homeschooled!\n\nChristina Aguilera was born to Fausto Xavier Aguilera and Shelly Loraine Fidler in Staten Island, New York on December 18, 1980. Her early life wasn’t an ordinary one and she faced many difficulties regarding her education. After her parents divorced, Shelly moved to Rochester, Pennsylvania with her two daughters. They started a new life.\n\nDuring this period, Christina developed an interest in the music industry. She was a gifted child and inherited her mother’s capabilities - her mother was a pianist and violinist. She gained confidence from her mother’s side. It wasn’t long when she started taking part in local talent competitions during elementary school.\n\nHomeschooling\n\nMost of her friend’s parents and schoolmates were jealous of Christina’s extraordinary voice and fame. They often bullied her. This is when her mother decided to homeschool Christina and help her peruse her goals. Yes, a well-known singer, Christina Aguilera was bullied so much in 9th grade that she had to quit school and start homeschooling for the better good. All of this started after she appeared on several TV shows including “Star Search.”\n\nAccomplishments\n\nIn 1993, Christina gained attention as a Mouseketeer on The All New Mickey Mouse Club. The show included other actors such as Ryan Gosling, Keri Russel, Justin Timberlake, and Britney Spears who would all later become famous themselves. Later, she moved to Japan with her mother where her first hit song “All I Wanna Do” was recorded.\n\nHer debut Album named after her own name “Christina Aguilera” earned her Grammy Award for the best new artist. That was her first official step and now the sky is the limit to her fame. Since then, Christina has launched dozens of songs and albums. In 2015, she earned Grammy Award for her hit ballad with A Great Big World “Say Something.”\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums by Christina Aguilera are listed below:\n\nChristina Aguilera in 1999\n\nMy Kind of Christmas in 2000\n\nMi Reflejo in 2000\n\nStripped 2002\n\nBack to Basics in 2006\n\nBionic in 2010\n\nLotus in 2012\n\nLiberation in 2018\n\nFilmography\n\nHave you watched “The Emojis Movie” released in 2017? Well, that movie contained a voice-over from Christina. Some other movies which incorporated her marvelous voice include Zoe (2018) and Burlesque (2010).\n\nCurrently\n\nChristina Aguilera is still working as a singer and songwriter, wife and mother. Aguilera says, she would continue her journey as a songwriter, singer, and artist for as long as possible."
