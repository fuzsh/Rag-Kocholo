        "text": "CHRISTINA AGUILERA’S latest road show is called the Back to Basics Tour. That name, however, is anything but an accurate summation of what local fans will see when the pop diva performs on Thursday at the Oracle Arena in Oakland and on March 10 at the HP Pavilion in San Jose.\n\nThe tour is a gargantuan affair that requires 24 buses and trucks to move between venues. It takes nearly 130 crew members some eight hours to set up the production in each city.\n\nAnd what a production it is: It features 20 band members and dancers, 10 wardrobe changes for the star and more than 600 moving lights onstage. When the tour finishes its 41-city North American run, crowds will have been showered with more than 820 pounds of confetti.\n\nIn other words, it’s hard to see this tour as getting Back to Basics. The singer is well aware of that contradiction. She also knows that while her musical style has changed — moving from the kiddie-pop of early singles like “Genie in a Bottle” to the vintage jazz, blues and soul sounds found on last year’s “Back to Basics” CD — the expectations on her in the live arena have remained largely the same.\n\nAnd Aguilera is out to exceed those expectations.\n\n“I don’t think it would be fair to my audience to just kind of sit on the stage with a mic if I play an arena… I want my audience to be able to look around and enjoy a show from all aspects,” the 26-year-old singer says during a recent teleconference to promote the tour. “You know, for me, whenever I go to see a concert, whenever I go to see a show, I really enjoy being taken out of my element for a moment, and really being able to use my imagination and enter this whole different world. And, for me, we do bring sort of a larger-than-life feel to this, you know, old concept.”\n\nFrom Mickey to Billie\n\nFlash back 15 years and you’d find a young singer with big dreams, one who, at the time, seemed like a very unlikely candidate to someday reinvent vintage jazz and soul for a new generation.\n\nThe Staten Island native, having competed (and lost) on “Star Search” at the age of 7, would get her first big break in 1992 when she signed on as part of Disney Channel’s “The New Mickey Mouse Club.” She was a member of an impressive cast that also included future stars JC Chavez, Justin Timberlake and, most famously, Britney Spears.\n\nThe Disney connection would pay off when Aguilera was asked to record the song “Reflection” for the studio’s “Mulan” soundtrack in 1998. That led directly to a deal with RCA and the release of the her eponymous debut in 1999. The CD quickly hit No. 1 on the charts, thanks to the sugary pop single “Genie in a Bottle” — and Aguilera, just 18 at the time, became a full-fledged superstar.\n\nIt was a very good time to be a teen pop star. Many of the hottest acts in the industry, including Spears, the Backstreet Boys and ‘N Sync, were catering to prepubescent pop fans. Aguilera quickly settled into the No. 2 position among young female pop stars, just a hair behind Spears, and her debut sold more than 8 million copies in the U.S. alone in less than two years. The album also helped Aguilera nab a Grammy for Best New Artist in 2000.\n\nThere seemed to be every reason in the world for her to stay the course — which is exactly why it was so surprising when she started charting new directions so early in her career. Yet, every move seemed to work for the young singer, as evidenced most dramatically by the eight other Grammy Awards that she’s won.\n\nIn 2000, she released a Spanish-language version of her debut record, titled “Mi Reflejo,” which again went to the top of the charts. Later that same year, she followed with the holiday-themed effort “My Kind of Christmas,” which was another hit. In 2001, she completely abandoned the teen-pop-princess persona for a racy collaboration with Pink, Mya and Lil’ Kim on “Lady Marmalade.”\n\nThat set the stage for 2002’s “Stripped,” a title that aptly summed up how Aguilera went about promoting the album. Underscoring the record’s more mature sound, the singer did a variety of sexy photo shoots for countless magazines. It was at this point that people started referring to her as “Xtina.” Despite the controversy surrounding her new image, “Stripped” was another multi-platinum smash.\n\nThe chameleon-like star then changed her colors again. She collaborated with the great jazz pianist Herbie Hancock and started performing an Etta James tribute in her concerts. The new Christina, version’06-’07, made her full-fledged debut with “Back to Basics,” a work that was partially inspired by classic female vocalists such as James, Sarah Vaughan and Billie Holiday.\n\nWhile some critics would argue that all the changes really have been crafty marketing moves, Aguilera says that each phase of her career has been about being honest with her fans.\n\n“It’s if I didn’t change (that), I would be lying to you. I would be lying about the real Christina,” she says. “I’m really showing people, you know, I do get bored easily. And not only is it important for me to challenge myself and evolve as an artist, but (change is) important for me personally.\n\n“I think that life is all about changing and trying to continue your growth as a person. I’m not the same person that I was on the last record, ‘Stripped,’ and I wasn’t the same person on ‘Stripped’ as I was when I first came out. And to me, it’s just a constant evolution. It’s a personal growth, and I do put myself out there in order to show the world the kind of the new person that I’m always growing into.”\n\nRoll the dice\n\nWhere Aguilera goes from here is anybody’s guess. She seems perfectly positioned to continue the move into classic R&B, soul and jazz. Her version of “It’s a Man’s Man’s Man’s World” at the Grammy Awards last month, delivered as a tribute to the late James Brown, wowed millions of viewers and left people clamoring for a full album of like-minded performances.\n\nThe music industry has also given its blessing to the singer’s current path — her recent single, “Ain’t No Other Man,” won the Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.\n\nPlus, Aguilera has to like the fact that people are no longer comparing her to her ol’ competitor Britney. Instead, they are referencing her potential — that she potentially has what it takes to become one of the greatest singers of our time.\n\nAll of that means nothing when trying to gauge Aguilera’s next career move. She’s a gambler, and she’s OK with the uncertainty that comes with rolling the dice.\n\n“For me, because I am the kind of artist that constantly likes to change and constantly likes to challenge myself and give my audience a new look and a new me, I’m constantly setting myself up for the possibility that people aren’t going to like it,” Aguilera says. “And, for me, I just have to live with that, because I’d rather come forth with something that’s real and honest to me as an artist than try and second-guess myself, and try to figure out what the public and the critics and everyone’s going to like.\n\n“Some people are going to love it. Some people are going to hate it. Some people are going to buy it. Some people are going to pass. And you know, for me, I really feel that it’s really important that I stick to my guns and I listen to my heart and what I want to do.”"
