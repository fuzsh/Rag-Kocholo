        "text": "Childlife/family:\n\nBorn Christina Maria Aguilera was born on December 18th 1980 in Staten Island, New York. Her mother Shelly Loraine Fidler was a typical Irish American stay at home mother without a job. On the other hand her father Fausto Wagner Xavier Aguilera was an abusive Ecuadorian sergeant in the U.S army. Fausto's job required the family to make constant moves all over the world. Fausto's frequent physical and emotional abuse hit the sore spot on her parents marriage. Very soon Shelly and Fausto divorced when Christina was only 7 years old. Shelly took her 2 daughters, Christina and Rachel, to live with her mom in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the beautiful suburb of Rochester. Soon after moving in with her grandma, Christina attended singing and performing lessons in her home town. With Christina's bright personality, determination and willingness, everyone knew that she had the power to shoot for the stars!\n\nEducation:\n\nChristina Aguilera attended school but her school life was not as simple and as beautiful as today. She had many challenges including those of her peers. Young Christina attended North Alleganey High School and Marshell middle school until later being homeschooled. She moved high schools in hopes for a better education. Her family always told her to only be yourself and no one else, despite her wishes students had still made fun of her for her great singing. Acts of bullying soon became threats, vandalism and physical and sexual assault. Students quoted \"It was like sending the sheep to the slaughter\" at the sign up to all the talent shows. If Christina signed up for the talent show immediately all the other names on the sheet were erased. Young Christina was quite the singer. Christina was a fairly intelligent student in school as well, that contributed to the jealousy of her peers. Christina always hoped that she was in for a better life in the future, this was not Christina's ideal way of living.\n\nAchevements:\n\nChristina has achieved so much and has gradually raised herself to the top of fame living the ultimate dream life. In her early life Christina had great singing in elementary school and at age 12 she was invited to the auditions for the Disney show series \"The Mickey Mouse Club\" and made it in. Later young Christina was singing at famous sports arenas around the world. August 1999 rolled around and Christina made her first single \"Genie In a Bottle\" and fans were fairly pleased. After that Christina thought that she was ready to face bigger challenges and conquer the world. In 2000 Christina sang at the 27th American Music Awards and won first place. Christina's popularity kept on growing and soon she was asked to perform with Rickey Martin, Jennifer Lopez and Shakira. Christina accepted and together they made a beautiful harmony. Christina made her second album \"Mi Reflejo\" incorporating her Latin background. 2001 was Christina's busiest year, business was booming and fans were expecting more. All in the same year Christina was awarded best female pop vocal, world's best music citation Latin Artist and had the chance to record a duet with Rickey Martin himself \"Nobody Wants To Be Lonely\". Christina has achieved so much in her life already, I can just imagine what lies ahead in her future.\n\nTrials and tribulations:\n\nChristina Aguilera, like many stars, has faced a lot of challenges in her life already. Age 0-7 were the most difficult years of her life. Her father Fausto enjoyed hitting and treating her meanly from the time she was born, the behavior of her father reflected on how she thought and treated others in her childhood. Aguilera had very few friends in elementary school. All the kids were scared to step foot on her door step because of her mean father. This was not Christina's ideal childhood. Other things happened in school that made her childhood not so enjoyable. She suffered from the jealousy of her peers because she could sing so well. Christina also faced bigger challenges that most stars have, the price of fame. Christina has had many vocal injuries and false information told by the paparazzi. The paparazzi tells false information just for the money. Believe it or not, Christina has always stayed true to her heart and goes in the direction her heart tells her.\n\nTimeline:\n\nDecember 18th 1980-Christina Maria Aguilera is born.\n\nMarch 15 1990-Christina appears on Star Search and loses the competition.
