        "text": "Background\n\nChristina Maria Aguilera is a household name and has been a force in entertainment from an early age. Born in Staten Island, New York, to parents Shelly Lorraine Kearns and Fausto Xavier Aguilera, she is the eldest of two daughters. Because of her father’s job in the army, the family moved houses quite often and settled in countries such as Japan before she moved with her mother and sister to Pennsylvania, to her grandmother’s, where Aguilera’s interest in music began. She was drawn to soul and would practice singing along to blues before landing a spot in various singing and talent competitions where she blew the minds of judges, competitors, and audiences alike with her powerful voice.\n\nShe auditioned for a role on the “Mickey Mouse Club” in 1991 and featured on the show for three seasons before setting her focus back on her true passion — singing. Aguilera was selected to sing Disney’s theme song ‘Reflection,’ for the film “Mulan,” which attracted the attention of record labels in the teen pop era pioneered by artists such as Britney Spears. She was later signed to R.C.A. Records and began working on her debut album, “Christina Aguilera,” and the lead single, ‘Genie in a Bottle,’ was released to commercial success in 1999. The album itself was a commercial success and earned Aguilera her first Grammy award. In the years to follow, she recorded more chart-topping albums, including her Spanish-language second studio album, “Mi Reflejo,” which consisted of re-recorded songs from her debut album.\n\nThe mother of two has released nine solo albums, made more big-screen appearances, and toured the world. Outside her project in the entertainment industry, Aguilera is also business-minded and has made numerous investments and endorsements to grow her brand in various industries. She has advertised for Pepsi, Sweetarts, and, more recently, Fun Wine, as their chief culture officer. She continues to be a powerful figure in the music industry, breaking boundaries and paving the way for the newer generation of Popstars."
