        "text": "Christina Aguilera boasts a fierce four-octave vocal range, but itâs hardly the only thing thatâs kept the superstar a dominant force in popâs ever-changing landscape. The petite powerhouse, born on Staten Island on December 18, 1980, quickly rose from the Star Search stage to The Mickey Mouse Club to MTV with a high-flying, melismatic soprano and plenty of sass. Her 1999 self-titled debut album proved she could tease and tantalize with as much untouchable charm as fellow former Mouseketeer, Britney Spears, when âGenie in a Bottle,â âWhat a Girl Wants,â and âCome on Over Baby (All I Want Is You)â all hit No. 1 on the pop charts. Since then, sheâs stayed steadfastly in the spotlightânot just by meticulously reinventing her image, but also by organically revealing more and more of herself, letting us peek into her own journey of self-discovery while remaining an inimitable artist. In the process, sheâs liberated herself more than once, starting with her metamorphosis into Xtina for 2002âs saucy R&B- and hip-hop-infused Stripped and its raunchy lead single âDirrty (feat. Redman),â all the way to 2018âs genre-hopping Liberation and its feminist anthem âFall In Line,â co-starring Demi Lovato. In between, sheâs growled through brassy funk (âAinât No Other Manâ) and heart-pumping electro-pop (âNot Myself Tonightâ), trilled over intimate piano balladry (âHurtâ) and sizzling R&B (âLike I Doâ), and collaborated with a wide spectrum of artists, songwriters, and producers, including Linda Perry, Lilâ Kim, A Great Big World, Maroon 5, Sia, Kanye West, Blake Shelton, and Burlesque co-star Cher. Through it all, Aguilera has used the power of her voice to empower listenersâto stand strong (âFighterâ), embrace their true essence (âChangeâ), and, ultimately, love themselves just a little bit more (âBeautifulâ)."
