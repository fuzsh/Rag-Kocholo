        "text": "Music Career\n\nAfter recording the song “Reflection” for the Disney movie Mulan (1998), Aguilera signed a recording deal and released a self-titled debut album of dance-oriented pop music in 1999. Both the album and Aguilera’s first single, “Genie in a Bottle”, quickly climbed to the top of the Billboard pop charts.\n\nAguilera’s next albums took varying paths but revolved around her powerful voice and exploited her looks and charisma. Emphasizing her Ecuadoran ethnic heritage, Aguilera capitalized on the Latin pop music boom by mastering enough Spanish to release Mi reflejo (2000). My Kind of Christmas (2000) followed.\n\nIn 2001 Aguilera collaborated with fellow singers P!nk, Mya, and Lil’ Kim on a popular cover version of Patti LaBelle’s 1974 funk classic “Lady Marmalade.” Soon after, Aguilera released Stripped (2002), on which she took on a more adult persona, epitomized by her hit single“ Dirrty.” Reminiscent of the work of Etta James and Billie Holiday, Back to Basics (2006) pays tribute to Aguilera’s jazz and blues influences. She returned to dance pop with Bionic (2010), though the album was considered a commercial disappointment. She followed that up with the album Lotus (2012).\n\nIn 2018 Aguilera released the album Liberation, which earned glowing reviews. She later contributed the songs “Haunted Heart” to the soundtrack for Addams Family (2019) and “Loyal Brave True” to the soundtrack for Mulan (2020). In 2019 she began performing in Las Vegas, Nevada. Aguilera received praise and numerous awards for her music, including several Grammy Awards.\n\nMovie and Television Career\n\nIn 2010, after appearing in various cameo roles on film, Aguilera starred opposite Cher in the musical drama Burlesque. She played a young small-town woman with dreams of becoming an entertainer. The following year she became a judge on the television singing competition The Voice. She remained with the show until 2016. During this time Aguilera continued to act. Her notable TV credits included a guest role on Nashville in 2015. She also appeared in such films as Pitch Perfect 2 (2015) and Life of the Party (2018) and voiced the character of Akiko Glitter in The Emoji Movie (2017)."
