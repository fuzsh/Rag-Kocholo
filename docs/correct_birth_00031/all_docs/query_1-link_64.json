        "text": "Christina Maria Aguilera (born December 18, 1980) is an American pop singer-songwriter. She is noted for her vocal abilities as well as her unorthodox sense of fashion. She began working in the entertainment industry at a relatively young age and rose to popularity through the critical and commercial success of her debut album Christina Aguilera (1999), which produced four hit singles. Her second English-language studio album Stripped (2002) was also greeted with high sales, but attracted less favorable reviews and generated controversy due to Aguilera's increasingly sexual public image. In 2005 she married record executive Jordan Bratman, and her third album Back to Basics is scheduled for a summer 2006 release.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life and career\n\nAguilera was born in Staten Island, New York, but grew up mainly in the Pittsburgh suburb of Wexford, Pennsylvania, attending North Allegheny School District, after living in various places around the world such as Texas and Japan. Her father, Fausto Wagner Xavier Aguilera, is a U.S. Army sergeant; he was born in Guayaquil, Ecuador, and moved to Staten Island when he was 19. Her mother, Shelly Loraine Fidler, is a Spanish-language translator and violinist from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Aguilera's maternal grandfather was of German ancestry and her maternal grandmother was of Irish, Welsh and Dutch descent.\n\nAguilera's parents met while Fausto was serving at Earnest Harmon Air Force Base in Stephenville, Newfoundland and Labrador. Her parents married when her mother was 20 years old and her father was almost 32. Aguilera lived with her father and mother until she was 6 or 7 years old, when her parents divorced and her mother took her and her younger sister Rachel to her grandmother's home in Pittsburgh. According to Aguilera and Fidler, her father was very controlling, as well as physically and emotionally abusive. Since then, Fidler has married a paramedic named Jim Kearns, and has changed her name to Shelly Kearns.\n\nAguilera's grandmother was the first person to recognize her vocal skills. Since Aguilera was a small child, she wanted to be a singer. She grew up admiring artists such as Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Etta James, Judy Garland, Madonna, Whitney Houston, Janet Jackson, and Mariah Carey. As a child she performed at block parties and in talent competitions, where she defeated her opponents. Aguilera soon gained media attention, and was known to as \"the little girl with the big voice\".\n\nAccording to VH1's Driven, this label eventually became cross-productive. When competitors learned they would be up against her in any given week, they immediately backed out, prompting insiders to claim it was \"like sending a lamb to the slaughter.\" Her peers soon became jealous of her and would frequently subject her to ridicule, ostracism, and, in one gym class, attempted assault. Acts of vandalism around her house included the slashing of the tires on the family car. Eventually the family relocated and, by her own order, swearing to secrecy about her talent lest another backlash occur.\n\nOn March 15, 1990, she appeared on Star Search singing Ella Fitzgerald's \"A Sunday Kind of Love\", but failed to win. Soon after losing on Star Search, she returned home and appeared on Pittsburgh's KDKA-TV's Wake Up with Larry Richert to perform the same song again. Later on she sang \"Vision of Love\", Mariah Carey's first single, and hit every riff and note, including Carey's trademark whistle register note. People remarked that the then-10-year -old \"sounded 20\".[citation needed]\n\nThroughout her youth in Pittsburgh, Aguilera sang \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" before Pittsburgh Penguins Hockey games, Pittsburgh Steelers football and Pittsburgh Pirates baseball games. Her first major role in entertainment came in 1993 when she joined the Disney Channel's variety show The New Mickey Mouse Club. Her co-stars included Britney Spears, as well as Justin Timberlake, JC Chasez (both of whom went on to join *NSYNC), Rhona Bennett (who later became a member of En Vogue), Ryan Gosling, and Keri Russell (who went on to become the star of Felicity). According to the documentary Driven, Aguilera's Mickey Mouse Club co-stars called her the Diva. One of her most notable performances was of Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\".\n\nAguilera was alleged to have fought constantly with co-star Britney Spears regarding Justin Timberlake. Aguilera has said the two of them have made jokes about these alleged incidents, which suggests that the allegations may not be accurate.) When the show ended in 1994, Aguilera began recording demos in an attempt to get signed to a record label.\n\n1998?2001: Pop music beginnings\n\nIn 1998 she sang the High \"E\" (second \"E\" above middle \"C\") in full voice on a cover of Whitney Houston's \"Run to You\" which she recorded with an old tape recorder in her bathroom. She was then selected to record the song \"Reflection\" for the Disney animated production of Mulan (1998). Recording \"Reflection\" led to Aguilera earning a contract with RCA Records during the same week. \"Reflection\" peaked within the top twenty on the Adult Contemporary Singles Chart, and it was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for \"Best Original Song\" in 1998.\n\nUnder the exclusive representation of Steve Kurtz, her self-titled album, Christina Aguilera, was released in the United States in August 1999. It reached the top of the Billboard 200 and Canadian album charts, shipping over eight million copies in the United States alone. \"Genie in a Bottle\", \"What a Girl Wants\", and \"Come on Over Baby (All I Want Is You)\" all reached the top of the Billboard Hot 100 during 1999 and 2000, and \"I Turn to You\" peaked at number three. Aguilera won the \"Best New Artist\" award at the 2000 Grammy Awards, and was also nominated for \"Best Female Pop Vocal Performance\" for \"Genie in a Bottle\". According to the album's songwriters who appeared on the documentary Driven, Aguilera wanted to display the power and audacity in her voice during the promotion of the album, and performed acoustic sets and appeared on television shows accompanied only by a piano.\n\nIn 2000 Aguilera first emphasized her Latino heritage, following the Latin pop trend of the time, by releasing her first Spanish album, Mi Reflejo. This album contained Spanish versions of songs from her English debut as well as new Spanish tracks. It reached the top thirty on the Billboard 200 and number one on the Latin album charts, and in 2001 it won Aguilera a Latin Grammy Award for \"Best Female Pop Vocal Album\". The single \"Falsas Esperanzas\" from the album reached the top forty in Argentina. Ricky Martin asked her to duet with him on the track \"Nobody Wants to Be Lonely\" from his album Sound Loaded; released in 2001 as the album's second single, it reached the top five in the United Kingdom and Germany, top twenty in the U.S., and top forty in Canada, Switzerland, and Australia.\n\nThat year a single emerged into record stores called \"Just Be Free\", one of the demos Aguilera recorded when she was around fifteen years old. When RCA Records discovered the single, they officially advised fans not to purchase it and had German authorities pull the single off shelves. Months later, Warlock Records was set to release Just Be Free, an album which contains the demo tracks. Aguilera filed a breach of contract and unfair-competition suit against Warlock and the album's producers to block the release. Instead, the two parties came to a settlement to release the album. Aguilera lent out her name, likeness and image for an unspecified amount of damages. Many of the details of the lawsuit remain confidential. When the album was released in August 2001, it had a photograph of Aguilera when she was fifteen years old.\n\nAlthough Aguilera's debut album was very well-received, she was dissatisfied with the music and image her management had created for her. At the time, Aguilera was marketed as a bubblegum pop artist, because of the genre's upward financial trend. However, she publicly mentioned plans of her next album to have much more depth, both musically and lyrically. Steve Kurtz's influence in matters of the singer's creative direction, the role of being her exclusive personal manager and overscheduling had in part caused her to seek legal means of terminating their management contract.\n\nIn October 2000 Aguilera filed a Breach of Fiduciary Duty lawsuit against Kurtz for improper, undue and inappropriate influence over her professional activities, as well as fraud. According to legal documents, Kurtz did not protect her rights and interests. Instead, he took action that was for his own interest, at the cost of hers. The lawsuit came about when Aguilera discovered Kurtz used more of her commissionable income than he was allotted, and had paid other managers to assist him. She also petitioned the California State Labor Commission to nullify the contract. After terminating Kurtz's services, Irving Azoff was hired as her new manager. The change in management marked a new change in how Aguilera was marketed, as well as what music she would do in the future.\n\nKurtz countersued later that month for breach of contract, claiming that the singer violated the same agreement she had sued to void. In the lawsuit, he included others close to Aguilera, alleging their intent to sabotage his business relationship with Aguilera. He also singled out Azoff for being in violation of the terms of Kurtz's contract.\n\n2002?2003: Development of music and image\n\nIn October 2002, after much delay, Aguilera's second full-length English album, Stripped, was released in the U.S. The majority of Stripped was co-written by Aguilera (who had recently signed a global music publishing deal with BMG Music Publishing), and was influenced by many different subjects and music styles, including rhythm and blues, gospel, soul, ballads, pop rock, hip-hop and jazz. The album was not received as well as her debut by most critics, and Aguilera's vocals were overlooked as she began to cultivate a more sexually provocative image. After the release of the album, she took part in photoshoots for magazines such as Maxim, Rolling Stone and CosmoGirl!. Many of these photographs featured her nude or semi-nude. She denied that this change was a matter of publicity, claiming that the image better reflected her true personality than did the image she cultivated back in 1999.\n\nInitially, the raunchy image had a negative effect on Aguilera in the U.S. While the video for \"Dirrty\" became a huge hit on MTV, it disappointed on the U.S. singles chart. However, the single was a huge hit worldwide, reaching number one in several countries. The album reached the top five of the UK, U.S. and Canadian album charts, though it was initially considered a \"sophomore slump\". The second single, \"Beautiful\", became a huge radio hit and three more singles from the album (\"Fighter\", \"Can't Hold Us Down\", and \"The Voice Within\") were released in the following two years to moderate success. Stripped stayed on the U.S. and UK album charts until well into 2004, and went on to sell four million copies in the U.S., ending up at number ten on Billboard's year-end album chart. Kelly Clarkson's second single \"Miss Independent\" was co-written by Aguilera, and was originally supposed to be a song on Stripped. Aguilera was the number-one Billboard Female Artist (albums and singles) of 2003.\n\nIn June Aguilera joined Justin Timberlake on the final leg of his international Justified tour, held in the U.S. This portion of the tour became a co-headliner called the Justified & Stripped tour. In August an overhead lighting grid collapsed from the ceiling of the Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey, causing major damage to the sound and video equipment below. Since the collapse occurred hours before the performance, only a few stagehands were injured, but a few shows were cancelled or postponed. In the fourth quarter of that year Aguilera continued to tour internationally without Timberlake, and changed the name of the tour to the Stripped tour. She also dyed her hair black. It was one of the top-grossing tours of that year, and sold out most of its venues. Rolling Stone readers named it the best tour of the year.\n\nIn light of the tour's success, another U.S. tour was scheduled to begin in mid-2004 with a new theme and featuring Chingy as an opening act. The tour was scrapped due to Aguilera's vocal cord injuries suffered shortly before its opening date. It was later reported by the British tabloid newspaper The Sun that low ticket sales and lack of new material were actually the major contributing factors in the tour's cancellation. Aguilera has since denied the report. In a tribute to Madonna's performance at the inaugural MTV Video Music Awards' ceremony, Aguilera performed a kiss with the singer-actress at the 2003 edition of the ceremony in August. The incident occurred during the opening performance of Madonna's songs \"Like a Virgin\" and \"Hollywood\" with fellow popstar Britney Spears."
