        "text": "Christina Aguilera (born 18.12.1980)\n\nChristina Aguilera is a pop singer / songwriter who began her rise to fame after recording the song 'Reflection' for the film Mulan.\n\nNet Worth: As of 2013, according to Celebrity Net Worth, Christina Aguilera has a net worth of 130 million USD.\n\nChildhood: Christina Aguilera was born in Staten Island, New York. Her father, Fausto Wagner Xavier Aguilera, of Ecuadorian descent, was a Sergeant in the U.S. Army and her mother, Shelly Loraine Fidler was a Spanish teacher with an Irish heritage. Aguilera took part in many talent contests when she was growing up and her fellow competitors became jealous of her vast talent. She became the subject of ridicule and acts of vandalism were carried out on her home. As a result of this, the family relocated to another suburb. Aged 9, she appeared on Star Search, singing 'A Sunday Kind Of Love' but did not win the contest. In 1993, she joined the Disney Channel's The Mickey Mouse Club. Among her co-stars were Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears and Ryan Gosling. Aguilera's first recorded song was a hit: a duet with Japanese singer Keizo Nakanishi entitled 'All I Wanna Do.'\n\nMusical Career: In 1998, Aguilera was selected to record the song ' Reflection' for Mulan. 'Reflection' was nominated for a 'Best Original Song' Golden Globe. Her debut studio album, Christina Aguilera was released the next year and reached the top of the Billboard 200 and Canadian album charts. The album sold over 14 million copies worldwide. The singles 'Genie in a Bottle,' 'What a Girl Wants' and Come on Over Baby (All I Want Is You) all topped the Billboard Hot 100. During promotion for the album, Christina was keen to display her vocal abilities and performed acoustic sets, appearing on TV shows with only piano accompaniment. Aguilera won the 'Best New Artist' Grammy in 2000. She was also nominated for 'Best Female Pop Vocal' for 'Genie in a Bottle.' The album Mi Reflejo, released in 2000, was Aguilera's way of emphasising her Latin heritage. The album contained Spanish version of her songs, as well as new Spanish tracks. In 2001, it won her a Latin Grammy for 'Best Female Pop Vocal Album.' Later on in 2000, Aguilera released a Christmas album called My Kind Of Christmas. It has sold over 3.2 million copies worldwide and is certified platinum in the US. Along with Pink, Mya and Lil' Kim, Christina Aguilera was picked to re-record the song ''Lady Marmalade' for the film Moulin Rouge! The single was produced by Missy Elliott and was number one on the Hot 100 for five weeks. It also reached number one in 11 other countries. The song also won its collaborators a 'Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals.' 2002 saw the release of the singer's second full-length English language album. Stripped sold more than 330,000 in its first week. Most of the album had been written by Aguilera (who had signed a global publishing deal with BMG). Ex-Four Non Blondes member, Linda Perry produced some of the more personal tracks on the album. Alicia Keys also wrote a song for the album. Aguilera joined Justin Timberlake on the last leg of his Justified tour and then continued to tour the world, naming the tour the 'Stripped World Tour'. It was named the best tour of the year by Rolling Stone readers. A UK performance of the tour was later released on DVD: Stripped Live in the UK. Not one to shy away from controversy, Aguilera shared an onstage kiss with Madonna during a performance of Madonna's songs 'Like A Virgin' and 'Hollywood' at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2003. Late 2004 onwards, Christina collaborated on a number of tracks, with Missy Elliott, Nelly, the jazz artist Herbie Hancock, Sean 'Diddy Combs' and opera singer Andrea Bocelli. Back To Basics, Aguilera's third English language studio album was released in 2006 and debuted at number one in the United States. The lead single, 'Ain't No Other Man,' was a huge commercial success. Linda Perry and Mark Ronson were among the producers that worked on the album. The album sold over four and a half million copies. 2010 saw the release of her sixth studio album, Bionic. The album fell flat in comparison to her previous work, with critics saying her lyrics were not particularly good. Two years later, Lotus, was released to very similar reviews.\n\nPersonal Life: Aguilera has given birth to a son, her first child, with husband Jordan Bratman. Jordan and Christina announced their engagement in 2005 and were married that same year. Max Liron Bratman was born on 12.1.2008. Aguilera and Bratman separated in September 2010, with a divorce being finalised in April 2011. Aguilera began dating Matthew Rutler while on the set of the 2010 film Burlesque.\n\nBiography by Contactmusic.com"
