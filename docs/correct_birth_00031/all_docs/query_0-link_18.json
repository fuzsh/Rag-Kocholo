        "text": "Christina María Aguilera (born December 18, 1980) is an American singer-songwriter, record producer and actress. Born in Staten Island, New York and raised in Wexford, Pennsylvania, she made appearances on the television series Star Search and The Mickey Mouse Club in her childhood. Aguilera came to prominence with her number-one debut album, Christina Aguilera; its singles \"Genie in a Bottle\", \"What a Girl Wants\" and \"Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)\" each peaked atop the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. Her follow-up records, Mi Reflejo and My Kind of Christmas, experienced moderate success worldwide. Displeased with her lack of input in her image and music, Aguilera assumed creative control for her fourth album, Stripped (2002), which yielded the international chart-topping hits \"Dirrty\" and \"Beautiful\". Aguilera's fifth album, Back to Basics, incorporated elements of 1930s and 1940s blues, soul, and jazz music. The album peaked at number one in 15 countries and its singles \"Ain't No Other Man\", \"Hurt\" and \"Candyman\" charted within the top-ten internationally. However, her electronica-inspired sixth album, Bionic, made little commercial impact. Later that year, Aguilera starred alongside Cher in the film Burlesque, and served as the executive producer of its accompanying soundtrack. Her seventh record, Lotus, was influenced by electropop and dance-pop elements. Since 2011, Aguilera has served as an original coach on the American version of The Voice, having appeared in four of its five seasons. Aguilera was established as a pop icon and has garnered honorific titles including the \"Princess of Pop\". Her work has earned her numerous awards and accolades, including four Grammy Awards, one Latin Grammy Award, two Billboard Music Awards, two MTV Music Video Awards, a Golden Globe Award nomination, a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the Special Achievement Award “People's Voice”. To date, Aguilera has sold 17.4 million albums in the United States and 50 million worldwide. Rolling Stone ranked her 58th on their list of the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time, becoming its youngest and only artist under the age of thirty. During the 2000s, Billboard recognized her as the 20th Artist of the Decade and its second top-selling single artist, behind Madonna. Aguilera was ranked number eight in VH1's 100 Greatest Women in Music and was one of Time's 100 Most Influential People in the World in 2013. Outside of her work in the entertainment industry, Aguilera is involved in charitable activities through human rights, world issues, and her work as a UN ambassador for the World Food Programme.\n\nWork with Bonnie McKee[]\n\nShe worked with Bonnie McKee on the following song(s):"
