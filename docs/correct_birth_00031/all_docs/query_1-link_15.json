        "text": "singer-songwriter Christina Maria Aguilera was born on December 18, 1980 in Staten Island, New York. She rapidly rose to stardom. Christina Aguilera was on The Voice from Season 1-3 and replaced by Shakira for season 4 beacuse she wanted to work on her day job as an artist. Christina will return for season 5. []\n\nChristina Aguilera- Early Years[]\n\nsinger-songwriter Christina Maria Aguilera was born on December 18, 1980 in Staten Island, New York. throughout her father's service in the Army, her family moved to various locations such as New Jersey, Texas, New York, and Japan.Her parents divorced when Aguilera was six years old. Christina Aguilera's father treated her mother violently, physicaly and mentally. She, her mother, and her younger sister Rachel then lived at her grandmother's home in Rochester, Pennsylvania. Her mother later remarried. Since her father was very controlling, as well as physically and emotionally abusive, so she used music as an escape. Even though her father has made multiple attempts to reconnect with her, Christina ruled out any chance. Since then, her mother has married again, and has changed her name. When Christina was a child she aspired to be a singer. She was known locally as \"the little girl with the big voice\", singing in local talent shows and competitions. At the age of 8, Aguilera won her first talent show performing Whitney Houstons's \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody\". On March 15, 1990, she appeared on Star Search singing \"A Sunday Kind of Love\", but lost the competition by getting second place. In 1991, Christina Aguilera auditioned for a role on The Mickey Mouse[1]Club; but she didn't meet the age requirements. Two years later, she joined the cast, performing musical numbers. Just up until the show's cancellation in 1994. Her co-stars included Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears, and Ryan Gosling.\n\nEarly Music[]\n\nHer first album was released on August 24, 1999. It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and Canadian[2]Albums Chart; it shipped eight million copies in the United States and over seventeen million copies worldwide.The album is included in the Top 100 Albums of All Time list based on US sales. Christina Aguilera's first single \"Genie in a Bottle\" was a mega international success, reaching number one of the US Billboard Hot 100 and several countries worldwide. It was the top-selling debut single of 1999, selling over 1.4 million units in the United States. A follow up single was \"What a Girl Wants,\" also topped the Hot 100 during 1999 and 2000. Christina became one of few artists to have multiple number one successes from a debut album in Billboard history. Additionally, \"What a Girl Wants\" was the first number one hit of the millennium.\n\nStripped Era[]\n\nChristina Aguilera's fourth studio album, Stripped, was released on October 26, 2002. It peaked at number two on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 330,000 copies. Unlike her previous work, the album showcased her sexy, raunchier side. Christina had become the deeper, darker Xtina. She co-wrote much of the album, as she had recently signed a global music publishing contract with BMG Music Publishing, and was influenced by many different subjects and music styles. The majority of the album was produced by Scott Storch and singer-songwriter Linda Perry. She inspired Christina to make more personal records.The album was generally well received by critics, although Xtina's vocals were overlooked as she began to cultivate a more sexy image,having taken part in nude and semi-nude photo shoots, Christina claims that it better reflected her true personality than her old image. She dyed her hair black, began referring to herself as the darker, \"Xtina\",She got that tattooed on the back of her neck.\n\nLotus and Present[]"
