        "text": "Christinas father was in the military. And her mother was a pianist and a violinist. \"I wanted to perform as long as I could remember,” she says. She first began performing at school talent shows. And then when she was 8 years old she appeared on the nationally syndicated \"Star Search\", and when she was ten, she sang the National Anthem for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Penguins, and then, at age 12 landed a spot on the \"New Mickey Mouse Club\" appearing on the Orlando-based show along with many other upcoming stars, as well as Britney Spears, J.C. and Justin of 'N Sync and the star of \"Felicity\", Keri Russell.\n\nTwo years later she recorded a duet, “All I wanna do” with the Japanese pop star Keizo Nakanishi on the weakly Disney show. And she toured in Japan. When she returned, studio was searching for a powerful voice with a thick vocal range for the Disney animated film “mulan” At her manager's request, Christina cut a one take demo on her boom box in her living room singing to a karaoke tape of Whitney Houston's \"I Wanna Run To You\".\n\nThe demo was sent to Disney -- they loved it -- and within 48 hours, the teenage girl with the exclusive mature voice was in a Los Angeles studio recording \"Reflection\". That very same week RCA Records signed her to a record contract. Mulan premiered in June 1998 and \"Reflection\" turned into a Top 15 A/C single, with Christina performing it live on \"CBS This Morning\" and the \"Donnie & Marie Show.\" \"The song's theme -- the struggle to establish your identity -- was something I could really relate to as a teenage girl myself,\" says Christina.\n\nChristina Aguileras debut album was “Christina Aguilera” in 1999. And in 2000 “Mi Reflejo” and “Mykidn of Christmas” and her last album is stripped which was published in 2002.\n\nmi reflejo\n\nStripped\n\nMy kind of Christmas"
