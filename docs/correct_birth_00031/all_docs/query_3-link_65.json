        "text": "Lose Yourself\n\nSeason Seven Finale. With Mrs. Ari fuming over Ari's angry meltdown the night before, Ari tries desperately to keep a surprise party for her on track. The guys attempt to stage an intervention for Vince, who has gone off the deep end. Turtle scrambles to find investors to save the tequila business. Eric receives an unexpected request from Sloan's father, Terrance, which leads him to consider Scott's business proposal.\n\nI Heart Lily Tomlin\n\nAll of Kathy Griffin's scheming to snag a Grammy nomination worked! Her CD (which happens to be titled \"For Your Consideration\") earns a Grammy nod for Best Comedy Album. But being nominated is just the beginning of Kathy's master plan, and to prove she's finally made it on the A List, Kathy must accomplish what only two other women in history have done nab that Grammy. With the help of Team Griffin tour manager Tom, assistant Tiffany and mom Maggie Kathy begins cold calling former Grammy winners at their homes to solicit votes. Kathy's obsession takes her all the way to Canada for a meeting with comedy legend, Lily Tomlin. Being one of only two women to have won a Grammy for Best Comedy Album, getting Ms. Tomlin's endorsement can only help the cause."
