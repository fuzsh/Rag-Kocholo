        "text": "Everyone deserves a second chance, even if you are Christina Aguilera.\n\nDays after messing up \"The Star Spangled Banner\" in front of 100 million people, The Brooklyn Cyclones are offering Aguilera a second chance to get it right. On Tuesday, the minor league baseball team invited the Staten Island native to sing a do-over of the song she publicly botched.\n\nAguilera messed up one of the lines of the national anthem before Sunday's Super Bowl in Arlington, Texas.\n\nChristina's fumble happened right after the twilights last gleaming and the perilous fight. The line that follows is: \"O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming.\"\n\nInstead she made up a line, a creative combination that included a previous line with a bit of Christina improv : \"What so proudly we watched at the twilights last gleaming.\"\n\nCyclones general manager Steve Cohen said in a statement that \"when a player makes a mistake, they usually don't get a shot at redemption, but with a singer, that's a different story.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this article."
