        "text": "I am sitting in the Great Western Forum, an empty arena near Los Angeles, waiting to watch a run-through of Christina Aguilera's new show for her Back to Basics tour, when the 26-year-old pop star appears in front of me. She is wearing black sky-high stilettos, a comfy sweater and supertight jeans, her white-blond hair pulled back, lips glossed in her signature red. \"Please understand this is a work in progress,\" she says to me. As she walks away, she calls over her shoulder, \"Work in progress!\" Then she climbs a gargantuan metal tower facing the stage and settles into a chair as a masseuse works out the kinks in her shoulders (she's watching the run-through, too, to give feedback to her team).\n\nCue the lights! Cue the confetti! The dancers take their places, the pyrotechnics specialist steps back into the wings (there is a circus scene involving flaming batons), and a platform rises out of the stage showcasing…a schlubby guy, holding one hand to his heart and resting the other on the brim of an imaginary hat. For the moment, this is Christina. Lip-synching to Aguilera's music, her stand-in imitates every move she will make throughout the two-hour show, which features acrobats swinging on trapezes, feather boas and a tin man on stilts. The \"fake Christina,\" Aguilera later explains, is her choreographer.\n\nWell, what's one more version of Aguilera? The Staten Island, New York-born and Pennsylvania-raised star, who rose to fame on The New Mickey Mouse Club, has since reinvented herself almost as often as Madonna. There was the preppy kid with the powerful, soulful, grown-up voice who was named Best New Artist at the 2000 Grammy Awards; the growling, skin-baring vamp in the 2001 video \"Lady Marmalade\" and the hypersexualized, bikini-and-chaps clad object of desire on the 2002 quadruple-platinum album Stripped; the forgotten third party in the infamous Britney-Madonna kiss at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards; most recently there's the blues- and jazz-influenced singer who married, by all accounts, a nice, stable guy (Jordan Bratman, 29). And the woman's only 26! So when the curtain drops and I follow Aguilera to her dressing room, I have no idea which Christina I'll encounter. In the end, I get something of a hybrid: a performer who is exhilarated by her work, a passionate advocate for victims of domestic abuse, and a woman who admits that, due to the domestic violence she endured growing up, she still feels safest onstage.\n\nGLAMOUR: You're so talented—why distract from that with all the personas?\n\nChristina Aguilera: It's really easy and safe for me to just sit up on stage and sing \"Beautiful.\" But there are so many more sides to me than my voice. I love theatrics and have a huge imagination: Why would I want to sit onstage and sing a bunch of ballads back-to-back? The artists I look up to are the ones who push their own limits.\n\nGLAMOUR: Would you feel exposed if you took all of that makeup off?\n\nChristina Aguilera: Yeah—there's a witch under this hair. [Laughs.] Would I feel exposed? Yes, in a certain way. The red lips are—I don't want to call them \"armor,\" but they're the clothes of my character, and I'm in the business of entertainment. Tomorrow at rehearsal, I'll be up on that stage, doing what my choreographer did tonight, and I don't want to come here without my makeup on. Wearing red lipstick helps get me into that world.\n\nGLAMOUR: Why does the word \"armor\" feel wrong?\n\nChristina Aguilera: Because I don't see makeup as a defense. I see it as a creative outlet. I am a woman who has my extreme vulnerable side and my baggage—and at times I feel extremely weak. And who's to say a little mascara doesn't make you feel more confident when you pop it on and look in the mirror? It helps, especially in my position, where I have people waiting down the street to take pictures of me so they can evaluate and criticize every little flaw on my face. I suppose that's where the armor would come into the picture.\n\nGLAMOUR: Do you think you're more open to criticism because you're a woman?\n\nChristina Aguilera: Definitely. Being a woman in this industry, you are open to a lot of extra criticism you wouldn't get if you were male. If you are a woman and you're assertive and want to get the job done, you're a bitch. If you're a guy, you're just assertive.\n\nGLAMOUR: At what age did you start to speak up for yourself?\n\nChristina Aguilera: I was 21. At the time, I was under the thumb of my label, and I felt like I had to do, say and act out everything they asked me to do. If they said, \"Don't show your belly,\" I would [comply]. I was trying to please them and the public and finally I had to say, \"Enough. I'm going to make a record that makes me happy and addresses all facets of being a woman. I don't care if I sell one or one million records.\" That's how I came to make Stripped.\n\nGLAMOUR: When you were growing up, your father was emotionally and physically abusive—you've been open in the past about seeing him and your mother fight, and wrote about him throwing you against a set of stairs in \"I'm OK.\" How do you think surviving domestic violence has contributed to who you are today?\n\nChristina Aguilera: I was brought up in a household of chaos and I never felt stable at home. At a really young age, I decided I was never going to feel helpless, I was never going to feel weak around a man, and I was never going to rely on anyone. Independence was a big, big thing for me. I saw my voice as a way out—when my parents fought, I'd run up to my room, put on The Sound of Music, open the window and sing out. My voice was my escape.\n\nGLAMOUR: And that experience has led you to charity work related to domestic violence, right?\n\nChristina Aguilera: I work very closely with a shelter near Pittsburgh. One day I hope to open a shelter of my own. I think it's really important to share my own story with women who've been abused, because going through that experience has led me to where I am today: It's given me the strength and motivation to be the best that I can be.\n\nGLAMOUR: Did you go to therapy to help yourself work through the abuse?\n\nChristina Aguilera: I have had my bouts with therapy. It's important for someone who's dealt with violence to be able to talk to someone, no matter who it is. So I'm vocal about how I feel. That's how I've worked through a lot of my problems.\n\nGLAMOUR: There's no question you're outspoken—but how many people really know you?\n\nChristina Aguilera: Very few. I think it comes from my history of abuse. I watched my father hurt my mother so many times. Then I became the sole provider for my family, and that's a lot of weight on your shoulders. Then some of the people I considered my nearest and dearest friends stole money [from me]; it really devastated me. I'm not saying \"boo hoo\" for me—it happened. But as a result, it's even taken me a while to open up musically: On my last record, I was extremely guarded.\n\nGLAMOUR: To be honest, it seems like you're choosing your words pretty carefully in this interview, too.\n\nChristina Aguilera: Well, yeah, it takes me time to let my guard down—especially with someone who is going to share my words with the world. We've been sitting here for how long: 10 minutes? 15 minutes? Every 20 minutes I let my guard down a little bit more. But I am very honest, even in interviews.\n\nGLAMOUR: Anything that's been printed about you that you'd like to clear up?\n\nChristina Aguilera: Sure, there have been things, but I think mostly I've found that doing interviews forces you to face yourself; I'm constantly having to search within myself, to see why I do certain things. But sometimes magazines will take artists' creative choices too literally; they assume that I actually live the way I do in music videos. For example: the whole \"Dirrty\" thing. Do you think I wear chaps to the grocery store? [Laughs.]\n\nGLAMOUR: Actually, in terms of that video—\n\nChristina Aguilera: I don't mean to bring it back to that.\n\nGLAMOUR: But it's important to talk about that, because young boys are watching the video, and they're not really seeing a strong, empowered woman—they're seeing a hot, practically naked woman dancing provocatively in a teeny bikini. How do you feel about that aspect of things?\n\nChristina Aguilera: Well, I can't control what they think. I'm not putting on a show for a guy; I'm comfortable with my body and it was a creative choice. I know that might make some women feel uncomfortable, but we need to stick together instead of getting angry at each other for our choices. I think women are sensual, beautiful beings, and I feel empowered when I express myself sexually.\n\nGLAMOUR: So what's next for you?\n\nChristina Aguilera: Well, my new video, which I codirected, was just released today. I've got all aspects of my new tour to think about—I'm balancing plates with my fingers and toes and head and shoulders and knees and elbows! But I'm in a great place: That overachieving, ambitious, nobody-can-hold-me-down attitude I had, which came from a place of anger and aggression, has transformed into feeling like I will take on the world, but I will do it with an embrace, rather than with my dukes up."
