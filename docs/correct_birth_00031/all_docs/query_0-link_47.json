        "text": "Christina María Aguilera (born December 18, 1980) is an American pop singer and songwriter. Aguilera was born in Staten Island, New York, to Fausto Wagner Xavier Aguilera, a Sergeant in the U.S. Army at the time, and Shelly Loraine (née Fidler), a teacher of Spanish. Aguilera’s father was born in Guayaquil, Ecuador. Her maternal grandmother, Delcie Mabel Dunfee,[20] emigrated from County Clare, Ireland, while her maternal grandfather is of German, French, English, and Dutch ancestry. Her father was stationed at Earnest Harmon Air Force Base in Stephenville, Newfoundland and Labrador and Japan. Aguilera lived with her father and mother until she was seven years old. Aguilera grew up hearing Spanish and thus understands the language."
