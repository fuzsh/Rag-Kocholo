        "text": "Christina Aguilera will kick off the NBA All-Star Game with a special performance alongside the Rockettes as part of the Entertainment Series presented by JBL on Sunday, Feb. 15. The pop star and dance troupe will team up for the opening, New York-inspired performance when the All-Star Game, which will air live at 8:00 pm ET on TNT, takes flight from Madison Square Garden in New York City.\n\nWhile the Rockettes are an iconic NYC entertainment staple, Aguilera was born in Staten Island before becoming a best-selling musician and coach on The Voice. Aguilera’s performance with the Rockettes will lead directly into the All-Star Game player introductions, a slot that Pharrell Williams filled with a performance at last year’s All-Star Game.\n\nAguilera is the second announced 2015 NBA All-Star performer, after Ariana Grande was revealed to be this year’s halftime performer last week.\n\nTrending on Billboard"
