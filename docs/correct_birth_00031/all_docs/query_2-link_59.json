        "text": "Welcome to a special holiday edition of Music Friday, when we bring you great songs with jewelry, gemstones or precious metals in the title or lyrics. Today, Christina Aguilera belts out her rendition of the 1947 classic, “Merry Christmas, Baby,” a song about how a very special piece of jewelry has made this the best Christmas ever.\n\nIn first lines of the song, Aguilera — with an assist from Dr. John — sings, “Merry Christmas baby, oh ooh / You sure did treat me nice, oh ooh / You gave me a diamond ring for Christmas / Now I’m living in paradise, oh oh.”\n\nOriginally recorded by Johnny Moore’s Three Blazers in 1947, this R&B holiday classic has been covered by a Who’s Who of music-industry legends, including Chuck Berry, Otis Redding, B.B. King, Elvis Presley, Bruce Springsteen and Melissa Etheridge.\n\nA little known fact about Aguilera’s version, which appeared on her My Kind of Christmas album in 2000, is that one of her heroines, Etta James, was supposed to be a featured performer on the track. For unknown reasons, Aguilera never got to record with James and Dr. John was picked as a replacement.\n\nNevertheless, Aguilera’s My Kind of Christmas peaked at #28 on the U.S. Billboard 200 album chart and sold more than one million copies.\n\nJohnny Moore’s Three Blazers’ recording of “Merry Christmas Baby” also was a great success. The song reached #3 on Billboard‘s R&B Juke Box chart during the Christmas of 1947.\n\nBorn in Staten Island, NY, in 1980, Christina María Aguilera moved to the Pittsburgh area as a 6-year-old to live with her grandmother after her parents' divorce. There she earned a reputation as \"the little girl with the big voice.\" At the age of 9, she competed on Star Search and made it all the way to the semi-finals.\n\nThe next year, she auditioned for The Mickey Mouse Club even though she did not meet its age requirements. Two years later, she would land a role on the series with castmates — and future stars — Ryan Gosling, Keri Russell, Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake.\n\nWith record sales tallying 75 million, Aguilera is recognized as one of the world's best-selling music artists. She's been referred to as the \"Voice of a Generation\" and claims a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nPlease check out the video of Aguilera’s live performance of “Merry Christmas Baby” on The Late Show With David Letterman. The lyrics are below if you’d like to sing along!\n\n“Merry Christmas, Baby”\n\nWritten by Brian Douglas Wilson and Mike E. Love. Performed by Christina Aguilera, featuring Dr. John.\n\nOh oh\n\nMerry Christmas baby\n\nYou sure did treat me nice, oh ooh yeah yeah\n\nSaid uh, merry Christmas baby, oh ooh\n\nYou sure did treat me nice, oh ooh\n\nYou gave me a diamond ring for Christmas\n\nNow I’m living in paradise, oh oh\n\nI’m, I’m feeling mighty fine\n\nGot good music on my radio\n\n(Yes you do child)\n\nWell I’m, I’m feeling mighty fine\n\nGot good music, on, music on my radio, oh\n\nWell I, I want to kiss you baby\n\nWhile we’re standing underneath the mistletoe\n\nSanta came down the chimney\n\nAbout a half past three\n\nLeft all these pretty presents\n\nThat you, that you see before me, oh\n\nMerry Christmas baby, merry Christmas baby\n\nYou sure been good to me, oh, oh ooh\n\nWell I, I haven’t had a drink this morning\n\nBut I’m, I’m lit up like a Christmas tree\n\nChristmas tree, oh oh oh, oh yeah\n\nOh, yeah yeah yeah\n\nOh oh ooh, yeah, oh, ooh,\n\nOh oh yeah, yeah, yeah\n\nSt. Nick came down the chimney\n\nAbout a half past three\n\nHe left all these pretty presents\n\nThat you see before me\n\nMerry Christmas baby\n\nYou sure been good to me\n\nHaven’t had a taste this morning\n\nBut I’m all lit up like a Christmas tree\n\nOh, oh, oh ooh, oh ooh\n\nMerry Christmas baby\n\nYou sure been good to me\n\nOh oh, oh oh\n\nOh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh\n\nSure been good, to, to, to, me\n\nHey, oh oh hey"
