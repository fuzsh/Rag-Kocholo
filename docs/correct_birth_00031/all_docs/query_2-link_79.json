        "text": "Celebrity Star Text Christina Aguilera began her career as the epitome of what it meant to be a teen pop star. She was the blond hair, blue eyed, Barbie doll every teenage girl wanted to be like. The media labeled her as the sweet, innocent pop artist, along with her former co-stars from the Mickey Mouse Club, Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake. Her first debut album featured her number one hit single, “Genie in a Bottle” which gave her the image of her teen pop identity. Yet, Christina never liked the image her label was manufacturing for her and she started to rebel against the image that her label and the media had portrayed her as. Therefore, for her second album ‘Stripped, she revealed to everyone who the real Christina Aguilera was;…\n\nThe famous person I have chosen is Christina Aguilera.

Personally, I view Mayella as a working progress towards a successful adult growing up in a very abusive environment her whole life.

She has released in interviews that growing up with her army sergeant father was no walk in the park. During her…\n\nBrittney Spears and Christina Aguilera Starred on The Mickey Mouse Club on Disney channel. For both stars, this was one of their first jobs, opening many doors for the girls.

Brittney Jean Spears was born on December 2, 1981 in McComb, Mississippi. However, she was raised in Kentwood, Louisiana.…\n\nOne of the good LGBT representations in the music video is that Christina Aguilera showed that no matter how you are what you believe in, that you are beautiful. For example, in the video there were two men who were kissing and holding hands in public. Another one is when there was a guy putting a bra on when he was changing. In this song she sings, “You 're beautiful, no matter what they say, words can 't bring you down, oh no, you 're beautiful, in every single way” (Aguilera). Christina mixes…\n\nselected this song because of its catchy beat and how it relates to the virtual world. This song is also one of my favorites. I instantly thought of this song when I read the assignment. Hero Elizaveta When Anda fights Lucy, this song begins to play. It’s about a person in battle, fighting against their enemies. The song goes on to say they want to be a hero. When the chorus plays “Hero, hero. I want to be a hero, hero.” Anda is trying to stop Lucy from killing the innocent gold…\n\n“ The roughest road often leads to the top”. – Christina Aguilera.

Christina mother was shelly Kearns her father…\n\nMy father started to come home later each night. First it was eight, then eleven, midnight, and eventually I wouldn’t even see him until the next morning. I would call him to see where he was, and the response I would get was “I have one more customer I need to sell a car to, I’ll be home soon. I love you, baby girl.” And of course I believed him and went about my business. But at that moment I didn’t realize that soon would mean the next day when I’m watching Rocket Power and eating my Frosted…\n\nAl asks Peter what happens if he doesn’t jump Peter simply says, “What do you think? You’ll be factionless”. Peter states something very simple and logical to Al that he’ll either make it or won’t but there’s nothing in between. If Tris decides not to jump, she will be factionless and left without a future, yet if she does jump and doesn’t make it, she’ll die. She literally has to choose her whole future in a split second. This exhilarating scene connects to the audience’s emotions as we once…\n\nSequence is a learning pattern in today 's world and I am one point shot of using it as needed. I do avoid this though, mainly because I hate schedules and for the most part, it 's because it mentally exhausts me to have an organized life. Who has that? I can 't live by a calendar. On the other hand, I do use post-it sticky notes through out the day at home and at work because I am very forgetful.
