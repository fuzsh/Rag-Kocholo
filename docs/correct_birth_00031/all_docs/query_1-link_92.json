The daughter of a father in the military and a violinist/pianist mother who\n\ntoured Europe with the Youth Symphony Orchestra, this18-year-old has traveled the world, living for a time in Japan, Florida, Texas\n\nand New Jersey, before settling in Wexford, PA, a suburb of Pittsburgh.\n\n\"I wanted to perform as long as I could remember\" says the blonde, blue eyed high school senior. Christina first began performing in\n\nschool talent shows. As an eight-year-old she appeared on the nationally syndicated \"Star Search\", at age ten she sang the\n\nNational Anthem for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Penguins, and then, at age 12 landed a spot on the \"New Mickey Mouse Club\"\n\nappearing on the Orlando-based show along with several other future stars, including Britney Spears, J.C. and Justin of 'N Sync and\n\nthe star of \"Felicity\", Keri Russell.\n\nAfter two years on the weekly Disney show, Christina traveled overseas to further hone her musical skills. She recorded a duet, \"All I\n\nWanna Do,\" with Japanese pop star Keizo Nakanishi, appeared in the video and toured in Japan. Later that year, the young show biz\n\nveteran almost caused a riot at the Golden Stag Festival in Transylvania, Romania when she waded into the crowd of 10,000 while\n\nperforming her two song set on a bill which included Sheryl Crow and Diana Ross.\n\nOn her return to the States in early 1998, Christina was invited to audition to record, \"Reflection,\" for the Disney animated film\n\n\"Mulan.\" The studio's search for a powerful voice with a wide vocal range quickly ended. They needed someone \"who could hit a high\n\n\"E\" above middle \"C,\" according to Christina. At her manager's request, Christina cut a one take demo on her boombox in her living\n\nroom singing to a karaoke tape of Whitney Houston's \"I Wanna Run To You\". The demo was FedExed to Disney -- they loved it --\n\nand within 48 hours, the young girl with the unique mature voice was in a Los Angeles studio recording \"Reflection\". That very same\n\nweek RCA Records signed her to a record contract. Mulan premiered in June, 1998 and \"Reflection\" turned into a Top 15 A/C single,\n\nwith Christina performing it live on \"CBS This Morning\" and the \"Donnie & Marie Show.\" \"The song's theme -- the struggle to\n\nestablish your identity -- was something I could really relate to as a teenage girl myself,\" says Christina. The song also related well\n\nto critics, garnering a Golden Globe Nomination for best original song in a motion picture.\n\nOn her debut album for RCA, Christina continues to define herself and showcase her special voice. From the sparkling upbeat\n\ndance-pop of the first single, \"Genie In A Bottle,\" to the guitar driven, heartfelt fun of \"What A Girl Wants\", to the soulful gospel\n\nstrains of \"So Emotional\" and the truly awe-inspiring ballad, \"I Turn To You\", Christina's powerful affecting voice intertwines the\n\nthemes of finding your own identity with the uncertainties of growing up.\n\n\"I was thrilled to work with so many great producers on this album\" gushes Christina. Recent hitmakers Carl Sturken & Evan Rogers\n\n['N Sync, Boyzone, Brand New Heavies] contribute a pair of tracks -- the pop-soul \"Love For All Seasons\" and the rousing\n\ndance-floor smash \"Love Will Find A Way.\" \"Genie In A Bottle\" was produced by ex-System member David Frank and Steve Kipner.\n\nThe uncomplicated, heartfelt \"Blessed\" was penned and produced by Travon Potts [co-writer of Monica's chart topping \"Angel of\n\nMine]. Christina is specially proud of her ballads, including the Matthew Wilder [\"No Doubt\"] produced \"Reflection\" and the\n\nspine-tingling Diane Warren ballad \"I Turn To You\", produced by Guy Roche [Brandy, Dru Hill, Aaliya, K-Ci & Jo Jo]. Her soaring\n\nuptempos and thrilling ballads serve as ample proof that Christina is not just a new kid on the block, but a prime candidate for the\n\nVoice of her generation. This debut album marks another huge step for Christina down the road of commercial and critical success."
