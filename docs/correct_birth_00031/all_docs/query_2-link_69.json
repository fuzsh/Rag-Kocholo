        "text": "According to the precise specifications of Aguilera and her husband, Jordan Bratman (a music business management executive), the myriad rooms are now a rhapsody in pink and red. Thirty chandeliers have been hung, a pinball-stuffed games room created. The LA interior design company Woodson & Rummerfield spent more than four months working on a nursery for their first child, Max, now two. The centrepiece is an 11ft-tall moon used as a prop on her last world tour, in support of her 2006 album Back to Basics. Her other favourite room is the studio in the back garden, beyond the mini-lake and waterfall, where she wrote and recorded much of her new album, Bionic.\n\n\"I can just put on my flip-flops and sweatpants and go right back,\" she beams. \"We call it the Red Lip Room.\" There was some work to do on the house as the previous owners had left their mark all over the place. They were Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne, and this was the house made famous in their reality TV show, The Osbournes.\n\n\"We kept certain elements, because there was also a homage-paying factor that was really fun,\" Aguilera, 29, says in the bright, shiny way that speaks of half a lifetime in the spotlight.\n\nAguilera has come a long way, fast. Her adolescent days on The Mickey Mouse Club alongside Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears led her straight into the pop charts: her debut single, Genie in a Bottle, released when she was 18, was an international hit. Her self-titled 1999 debut album sold 17 million copies.\n\nBut the bubblegum image foisted on her, lucrative though it was, frustrated the teenager with the octave-vaulting voice that could hit a high 'E'. Her 2002 album, Stripped, showcased her raunchier side. The infamous video, released the same year for her single Dirrty, directed by the outlandish photographer David LaChapelle, revealed an Aguilera thrusting ahead – in every sense – in revealing leather chaps and braided blond hair extensions. She took the makeover further: she was now 'Xtina', a sexually provocative woman with an edge, and she had the newly acquired multiple body piercings to prove it. Most of the piercings have gone, she tells me when we meet in a Beverly Hills hotel room. Doll-like petite, and with her white-blond hair perfectly coiffed and her lips a bright shade of scarlet, she wears a huge silver knuckle-duster across her right hand saying 'Xtina'. She is dressed in a plunging bustier.\n\nThe rebrand paid off: Aguilera became one of the most successful artists of the past decade, selling 43 million records and winning five Grammys. Her signature ballad, the soaring Beautiful, added some critical credibility to the mix too. She\n\nchanged course again with Back to Basics, in which she dressed like a 1940s blond bombshell. And where the career of her rival, Britney Spears, spun out in a haze of drugs and paparazzi run-ins, Aguilera ploughed a steadier, more lucrative path. She recently completed work on her debut film role in Burlesque.\n\nChristina Aguilera is back, and marriage, mansions and motherhood and have not dulled her edge. The sleeve image (and title) of Bionic reflects the album's embracing of electronic and dancefloor sounds: half of Aguilera's face is replaced by robot circuitry. Sonically, too, she 'reached out' to underground electronic artists such as Ladytron and Peaches. There are gentler ballads, a couple written with the hitmaker Linda Perry (who wrote Beautiful) and some with the Australian singer-songwriter Sia. But the feel of Bionic, not least in the fizzy robo-disco lead single, Not Myself Tonight, is one of full-on club grooves. New mum, then, didn't turn soft.\n\n\"Definitely not,\" she shoots back, then talks at me – rapidly – for some time. \"Being a mum and being an artist that expresses myself are two very different things for me, they're two very different hats that I wear. Do I lessen anything because\n\nI'm either married or have a child? No. Because it's all about self-expression and being an artist. It's so important to me. I'm not just a singer. I'm an artist who gets visually inspired and collects art.\"\n\nThe idea to make an electronic record came early on. Or, as she puts it, \"I always knew I wanted to do a futuristic statement on a musical note. But I wanted to make sure I did my inspiration record first.\"\n\nShe's talking aboutBack to Basics. One half of that double-album featured Candyman and Ain't No Other Man, singles that evoked the Andrews Sisters and jumpin' jazz. Some critics scoffed at this latest sharp left-turn. But it was, she insists in\n\na breathless, grammar-flouting rush, \"a retro exploring of my inspirations musically to begin with when I was six years old with the soul and the blues and the jazz artists and exploring what that was visually in the 1920s and 30s and 40s.\" It was about \"paying homage to the people that inspired me\", a process \"that almost forced me to revisit times in my childhood that I probably didn't want to\".\n\nChristina Aguilera was born in Staten Island in 1980, the first child of Fausto Aguilera, a US army sergeant from Ecuador, and his Irish-American wife, Shelly. Her parents divorced when Aguilera was six, and she, her mother and younger sister moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It had been a difficult family environment: money was short, army postings took them around the US and further afield (including a spell in Japan), and her father was physically violent towards her mother. Long estranged from her father, she sang about these times on the Back to Basics songs Oh Mother ('he took his anger out on her face') and The Right Man ('no father stands beside me to give this bride away').\n\nOld-school music was a refuge for Aguilera. \"Soul and blues spoke to me at an age where many would think I was too young to appreciate it. Six years old and I was listening to Billie Holiday as if it was the world to me. I related to blues and soul because I never had a safe haven growing up. It was a very chaotic environment for me to grow up in.\"\n\nAguilera's love of music quickly became a love of performing. Her astonishing voice brought her acclaim on the local talent-show circuit. She was ambitious, and determined to succeed. Does she think her troubled home life, for all the pain, inculcated independence and self-sufficiency early on?\n\n\"It had to,\" she says firmly. \"Probably growing up witnessing my mum being so helpless at my father's hands and under my father's control and not having a career of her own to fall back on…\" she says, the words tumbling out of her. \"Watching that and witnessing how helpless she was in the situation and having to rely on a man – that was something I definitely absorbed early on into realising this is not who I want to be. This is a situation that I never want find myself in.\n\n\"And I was very defiant against it. It created a lot of anger for me. Any time I felt an injustice, or bullying – I was very sensitive to that. I don't like bullies. And I never, ever wanted to feel helpless to a man. So I was driven from a really early age to… succeed on my own. Yeah,\" she nods, \"to succeed on my own. For myself. And make it.\"\n\nLanding a part in 1993, aged 13, on The Mickey Mouse Club, Disney's all-singing, all-dancing children's show, was the beginning of her resolute march to succeed. In a way, she felt like she had come home. \"I look back with fond memories of that time. It was fun. We all didn't want it to end. It was like a summer camp for kids like me,\" she beams. \"I grew up in a place where I didn't really get a lot of people around that really understood or appreciated arts and singing and performing and wanting to do that as a lifestyle choice. So once I got on The Mickey Mouse Club and met other kids who enjoyed performing and wanted a whole career out of it, it felt like a family.\"\n\n\"Um, I tried. I tried to go to my high school prom and whatnot. And when Genie in a Bottle was played all the girls ended up leaving the dance floor just to be nasty.\" It all sounds desperately sad, a real-life version of the school dance scene in the horror film Carrie (albeit with less pig's blood), the freakishly gifted girl ostracised by jealous peers. But Aguilera doesn't see it that way.\n\n\"I look back at that and I smile, in a way,\" she says. \"Because it was such training for the bigger picture, and to deal with just nastiness and negativity… for no reason! I didn't do anything to those people. And I learnt how to keep the positive\n\npeople round me, and have sharper instincts for anybody that just doesn't want to see me succeed. I'm just, like, see ya! I don't need it.\"\n\nSo she's hugely thrilled to have recently finished filming the lead role in Burlesque, a film about a small-town 'tough girl' with a difficult background who wants to make it as a burlesque dancer – an emotional and professional arc that resonated with Aguilera. Her role in the film came after Clint Culpepper, the president of the film company Screen Gems, saw her perform with the dance troupe Pussycat Dolls – \"not the pop group, back when it was an underground show at [the LA club] the Viper Room.\" Culpepper has said the script was duly written with Aguilera in mind. \"Cut to years later, a script shows up at\n\nmy doorstep. I read it and, you know, I had a rewrite done to the character to make her a little bit meatier, and more interesting. Because if I was going to venture off into acting I wanted it to be something I could sink my teeth into, something a little juicy.\"\n\nUndoubtedly she has her diva moments, but these days Christina Aguilera finds contentment from things other than professional and artistic achievements. The LA mansion, for example. \"Ozzy's colour choices in certain rooms were dark and moody and we kept with that theme,\" she says. \"The walls of the studio are red, which I love. Red being such a great accent for me.\"\n\nThe crowds of Osbourne fans who still gather outside the mansion are less interested in the 'accent', more the overall excess of the place where mum, dad, Jack, Kelly and their umpteen dogs ran wild. \"That can be a little bit of a pain in the ass,\n\nI have to say,\" Aguilera tells me. \"But once you're behind the walls of the gate, you feel pretty secure and out of touch with the rest of the world, which is nice.\" There she's no martyr to the gym (\"I hate working out with a passion\"), and is no diet freak – \"I enjoy some bacon, and my carbs!\" she laughs. \"I'm big on the basics: sleep, water, moisturiser.\"\n\nAnd art, one of her major financial indulgences. She and Bratman (whom she met on a working trip in Atlanta and married in a $2 million wedding in the Napa Valley in 2005) have given much thought to hanging their collection. It features a number of works by the hugely collectable (and hugely expensive) British guerrilla artist Banksy. \"We have some prints and an actual oil canvas,\" Aguilera says. \"And we have some of his stencils and his paintings as well. We have many Banksys– we probably have around…\" She raises her eyes to the ceiling and mentally tallies up the artworks. \"Around 10,\" she says, finally.\n\nShe likes Banksy's political statements. \"I think he has a rhyme and reason to it, and isn't just painting a cheeseburger to be graphically interesting. And I like his little mystery,\" she says of his anonymity. No, she hasn't met him, but \"I'm in his documentary [Exit Through the Gift Shop] I hear, shopping at his exhibition.\"\n\n\"I like the rebellion!\" she titters. \"I'm not going to speak about anything in regards to the Queen or anything like that. That's not my territory. But I like anything that sort of goes against the grain. I like the …\" She titters again. \"…the juxtaposition of that. I thought the image was hilarious.\"\n\nPerhaps for the first time, Aguilera has a home life that is fully functional, fulfilling and secure. Bratman is \"just that guy that walks into a room and he can really make me smile. That's how I started falling in love with him. He just had this essence of comfort. He is and continues to be my biggest fan, and just such a number-one supporter. He's a great man. I'm lucky to have him.\"\n\nMax, too, fills her world. She tries as best she can to be the first person he sees in the morning and the last person he sees at night. She plans to take him with her on her Bionic world tour, which starts in America in July. The look for that tour, she says, will involve a lot of latex. \"It just fits the body so well,\" she coos, \"and it's very simple. And it's very graphic-looking on camera and film. So that ended up being a lot of my go-to choices for this record. It's very slick, it shines. You can lubricate it up.\"\n\n\"No. Because there's two different hats for me,\" she says. \"Sexuality to me, it's really nothing to be ashamed of. I feel like there's so many labels put upon women. Everyone has their own comfort zone with what that means for them.\n\n\"My son, he's growing up in a house that's got a lot of nudity in our artwork, and seeing naked women and whatnot. And he's going to learn to have an appreciation for females and strong women, and a hard-working mum. And he's going to also understand that women should able to express themselves and feel comfortable in their own skin, no matter what that means. No judgment involved.\n\n\"So that's how I'm going to raise my son. And he's going to know that mummy does this on the side for work. And then I come home and put him to bed and read him stories about dinosaurs and ladybugs.\"\n\n\"Well… He's two years old right now so no time soon. But eventually he's going to get to that age where he's going to have his own opinions about it, and I'll be open to hearing them. And he's going to hear the reasons why I chose to do the things that I did. And I take pride in that. What does Ozzy Osbourne say when he explains to his kids eating the heads off bats?\"\n\nAsk Christina Aguilera why she didn't flame out in a spiral of drugs, paparazzi run-ins and shaved heads, like her fellow Mouseketeer Britney Spears, and she replies evenly, \"Because I kept my eyes on the prize. It's that drive since I was a little girl to keep going and it's my overachieving mentality. I always wanted to remain focused. I didn't want to get swayed. And what, I've been here over a decade? And years from now, decades from now, I still want to be doing it. So it's the eye on the prize. And always staying hungry.\""
