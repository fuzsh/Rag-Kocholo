        "text": "Who's the most famous Staten Islander?\n\nWe asked readers on Facebook and Instagram who the most famous Staten Islander of all time is. They responded with hundreds of answers. Here are some of the best.\n\nThe Impractical Jokers\n\nSal Vulcano, Brian Quinn, Joseph Gatto and James Murray make up the most daring, humorous quartet of entertainers we've seen in a while. You can see these Staten Islanders (almost 24/7) on truTV screwing with the public and each other. What else could you ask for? (Btw, Murr. Nice wig.) (truTV Photo)\n\nDavid Johansen\n\nStaten Island native David Johansen has been rocking forever. The frontman of the New York Dolls who also performed as Buster Poindexter is just one many talented entertainers from the Forgotten Borough. (He's also a cab driver with a sense of nostalgia.) (AP Photo)\n\nAlyssa Milano\n\n\"Who's The Boss?\" \"Charmed\" \"Melrose Place\" ... Alyssa Milano used to live on Staten Island as a child. She went on to have a heck of a career in the 1980s and 1990s and remains very active today on the small screen. You can see her in the Netflix series version of \"Wet Hot American Summer.\" (AP Photo)\n\nWu-Tang Clan\n\nName a more influential hip-hop group from Staten Island. We'll wait.\n\nWhile you figure it out, listen to this highly not-safe-for-work piece of music.\n\nWu-Tang Killa Beez, we on a swarm\n\nWu-Tang Killa Beez, we on a swarm\n\nWu-Tang Killa Beez, we on a swarm\n\nWu-Tang Killa Beez, we on a swarm\n\nThe RZA, the GZA, Ol Dirty Bastard, Inspectah Deck, U-God\n\nGhost Face Killer, the Method Man, Raekwon the Chef, the Master Killer\n\nRaw Desire, LeVon, Power Cipher\n\nTwelve O'Clock, Sixty Second Assassin, the 4th Disciple\n\nThe Brand White\n\nK.D. the Down Low Wrecka, Shyheim AKA The Rugged Child\n\nDoo-Doo Wales, Mista Hezakiah -- better known as the Yin and the Yang\n\nThe Tru Masta, Asan, DJ Skane, The Tru Robocop comin thru\n\nScientific Shabazz, my (use of explicit adjective) man Wise the Civilized\n\nThe Shaolin Soldiers, Daddy-O and Popa Ron\n\nComin down from the (use of explicit adjective) South end of things\n\nThe Fresh Kills landfill\n\nThe Fresh Kills landfill is gone (1948-2001), but its existence dominated Staten Island for more than 50 years. The scent, the sight, the reputation. \"You can see it from space,\" people would say. This thing was the ultimate eyesore and it forced people to flee parking lots in New Springville for shelter, but it's definitely as infamous as it gets when it comes to Staten Island. (Staten Island Advance photo)\n\nTHE GIANTS WIN THE PENNANT. (Bobby Thomson)\n\nThe narrator of the 101-second clip above will tell you all you need to know about \"The Shot Heard 'Round The World,\" featuring Bobby Thomson. Thomson, a Staten Islander, hit arguably the greatest home run in the history of Major League Baseball while playing in the most ferocious rivalry in New York (Giants and Dodgers).\n\nThe local version of the rivalry is gone, and so is Thomson -- he died in 2010 (read his obit here) -- but his game-ending blast is eternal, as is the tale of a humble man riding the Staten Island Ferry after hitting a shot that'll give even the novice sports fan goosebumps.\n\nAlice Austen\n\nAlice Austen, photographer, innovator, bicyclist, women's and LGBTQ rights figure, Staten Island Garden Club founder, tennis player ...\n\nShe's one of Staten Island's most memorable people. The Alice Austen House remains a fixture in local culture. A Staten Island Ferry boat is named in her honor. Her accomplishments and life's work place her in a special realm in borough -- and New York -- history.\n\nFor more on Alice Austen, head here.\n\nRobert Loggia\n\nRobert Loggia, a New Dorp High School and Wagner College grad, had an acting career that spanned 50-plus years, including \"Independence Day,\" \"Scarface,\" and a cute little movie called \"Big\" starring a young Tom Hanks and the FAO Schwarz piano. Loggia passed away in December 2015.\n\nFather Vincent Robert Capodanno\n\nOne of the most heroic Staten Islanders to grace the battlefield was not a soldier, but a priest.\n\nOn Sept. 4, 1967, 50 years ago, Father Vincent Capodanno was killed on a battlefield in Vietnam living out his purpose in this life -- protecting, comforting and indeed, living as one of them, the United States Marines, in battle and under fire, wrote the Advance in 2012.\n\nCapodanno, a Mariners Harbor native, risked his life a hundred times over in fulfilling his religious mission.\n\nHis inspiring tale of courage and selflessness can be read here.\n\n\"Shine! Shine!\"\n\nThe Shoeshine Guy, Carmine Rizzo, buffed shoes to a high mirror shine for more than 30 years on the Staten Island Ferry. Commuters and tourists alike were familiar with this ferry fixture, who retired on the first day of 2004.\n\nThe Italy native's shoeshine kit was added to the Staten Island Institute of Arts & Sciences' exhibit in 2005 titled \"Staten Island Ferry: The First 100 Years of Municipal Service.\"\n\nJoan Baez\n\nJoan Baez is a world famous writer and interpreter of song, a committed activist for human rights who has, at times, been considered to be both a hero and a controversial figure. And, oh yes, she is also a Staten Island native, wrote the Advance in 2013.\n\nSinger Joan Baez has performed publicly for over 50 years, releasing more than 30 albums. Fluent in Spanish as well as in English, she also has recorded songs in at least six other languages.\n\nThe Staten Island-born singer also was quite active in the fight for civil rights and took part in several marches. Her performance of “We Shall Overcome” at Dr. Martin Luther King’s 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom permanently linked her to that civil rights anthem, reported the Advance in 2013. (AP Photo)\n\nYou'll want to read more about this amazing Staten Islander. Do so here.\n\nCornelius Vanderbilt\n\nCornelius Vanderbilt. A business mastermind, Vanderbilt was the patriarch of a highly successful Staten Island family forever entrenched in this borough's history. He was heavily involved with steamboat building and operating, and later devoted his talents to the railroad industry.\n\nCornelius Vanderbilt, a father of 13, died in 1877 with an estimated fortune of over $100 million, leaving 95 percent of it to his son, William. He lies buried in the Vanderbilt Mausoleum, on a plot of land he purchased at Moravian Cemetery in New Dorp.\n\nRead more about Vanderbilt here.\n\nCOME ON OVA FA DINNAAAH\n\nRemember this commercial? Phil from Gino's -- and his big invite to Staten Island -- was pretty famous, albeit briefly.\n\nJalopy the Tortoise\n\nThe story of Jalopy and Staten Island dates back to the late 1930s. We'll let Diane Lore, Advance reporter, take it from here:\n\nJalopy came to Staten Island in 1937 -- a year after the Zoo opened -- as a gift from businessman and philanthropist Vincent Astor.\n\nThe name \"Jalopy\" was derived from the frequent mispronunciation of \"Galapagos,\" the Ecuadorian island chain from which she came. Famous for her long neck and giant size, she soon became a Zoo favorite of visitors and staff.\n\nUpon arrival, Jalopy weighed 85 pounds and would ultimately reach a weight of 175 pounds.\n\nIn 1981, a benign tumor was discovered on her left shoulder. After surgery was performed, it became impossible for Jalopy to walk on her own, and she was placed atop a five-wheeled dolly, allowing her to roam about her pen. She was dubbed the \"Tortoise on Wheels.\"\n\nJalopy perished in December 1983. The Zoo recently unveiled a tribute in her honor.\n\nPaul Castellano\n\nPaul Castellano was Staten Island's real-life \"Godfather\" figure. The infamous crime boss lived on a giant piece of property on Todt Hill -- \"The White House\" -- and served as the head of the Gambino family. We'll let you do more homework on Castellano's biography, but we'll leave you with the lede of the story involving the man's gruesome demise:\n\nAs he stepped from the car, gunmen greeted him with a half-dozen bullets. His driver, reputed underboss Tommy Bilotti, of Eltingville, watched through the car’s window until he himself was ambushed from behind. Bilotti’s body splayed across the street, blood flowing bright red from a half-dozen bullet holes. One gunman moved in close to Castellano’s body, slumped against the open door. He aimed at the boss’s head and fired a final shot, point blank.\n\n(AP Photo)\n\n\"Macho Man\" Randy Savage\n\nOH YEAH! Randy Savage, the Macho Man, a wrestling god in the heyday of the once-known WWF (now WWE), used to call Staten Island home. He resided in a condo in New Springville by the Staten Island Mall which he purchased in 1986.\n\nBorn Randy Mario Poffo, Savage had a larger-than-life personality when he was with the wrestling organization during the 1980s and 1990s. He died in 2011.\n\nHis obituary is here.\n\nChristina Aguilera\n\nChristina Aguilera was born just before Christmas in 1980 in Staten Island University Hospital, Ocean Breeze, and lived in Grasmere before moving to Texas. At the age of 8, Christina appeared on “Star Search,\" according to Advance archives.\n\nWhen she was 12, Christina became a member of the “New Mickey Mouse Club” and continued performing on the Disney Channel show for two years, appearing with such future stars as Britney Spears and Keri Russell, as well as J.C. Chasez and Justin Timberlake of ‘N Sync.\n\nIn 1998, she recorded “Reflection” for the Disney animated film “Mulan.” Christina went on to stardom with such hits as “Genie In a Bottle” and “What a Girl Wants.” In 2000, Christina won a Grammy Award as best new artist. She was also one of the hosts of the TV show \"The Voice.\"\n\n(AP Photo)\n\nRick Schroder\n\nActor, director and writer Rick Schroder was raised on Staten Island. He entered the acting business as a child; his first big break came in 1982 with the sitcom \"Silver Spoons.\" Schroder also found consistent work with \"NYPD Blue\" in the late 1990s.\n\nSchroder wrote and directed the 2004 movie \"Black Cloud,\" starring Tim McGraw, and directed and starred in the music video \"Whiskey Lullaby,\" performed by Brad Paisley and Alison Krauss.\n\n(Author's note: He was in this little cult classic called \"Poolhall Junkies,\" with Christopher Walken and Chazz Palminteri.)\n\nThe Ambassador Arms: Martin, Emilio and Paul\n\nPaul Newman, Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez were once St. George residents. They resided in the Ambassador Arms building near the Staten Island Ferry.\n\nNewman, a legendary actor known for countless roles, and Sheen, of \"Apocalypse Now,\" \"The West Wing\" and much more, both left the neighborhood when their careers took off.\n\nEstevez, the less controversial of Sheen's acting children, was born in the Ambassador Arms. He later coached a youth hockey team after overcoming a short stint as a high school delinquent. (wink wink)\n\n(AP Photo)\n\nAngela \"Big Ang\" Raiola\n\nBig Ang and her group of \"Mob Wives\" all had Staten Island ties. Raiola, who passed away at 55 years old last February, has a mural on Forest Avenue that pays tribute to her life.\n\nFor more on the Mob Wives, head here.\n\nShane DiMaio and Tom Wrobleski of \"A Hot Minute\"\n\nMaybe? Well, they're getting there..."
