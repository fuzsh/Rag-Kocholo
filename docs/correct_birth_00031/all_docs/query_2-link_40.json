        "text": "Christina Aguilera is still promoting The Voice on tv, and yesterday she made an appearance at Live! with Regis & Kelly. The chat she had with the hosts is so interesting (you can see it at the end of this post).\n\nI’m not very objective when it comes to her, because she’s one of my favourite artists, but I must admit I’ve been positively impressed by her latest appearances. If you compare these with the ones she did last year, while promoting Bionic, she totally looks like a different person. She’s happy and relaxed; on the other hand, last year you could tell there was something wrong going on.\n\nThe first detail that caught my attention was her hairstyle, which I love, because it’s so reminiscent of 50’s wavy and sexy styles. This is definitely an improvement for her.\n\n(more…)\n\nThe preliminary phase of The Voice is coming to an end and I couldn’t be more excited: this means the real competition is about to start. I’m sure Christina will give us lots to talk about with her outfits: the ones that she has sported recently show she’s slowly finding her own style, which includes sheath dresses, fitted shapes, polka dots (plenty of them) and diamonds!\n\nLast night she made an appearance at the Jimmy Kimmel Live and looked sensational, wearing a fitted white dress with black polka dot inserts and a par of Christian Louboutin Lady Peep red patent pumps.\n\n(more…)\n\nChristina Aguilera is currently in New York, where she’s been busy with promoting NBC’s The Voice. I must say I’m so glad to see her more beautiful and livelier than ever: she’s recently had some hard times in her life, but it seems like she’s striving and doing her best to go on and to overcome difficulties.\n\nI hope you’ll forgive me for posting this unusual picture first, but she looks amazing, I love her smile and her smiling eyes. I like this picture so much because the contrast between her platinum blonde locks and the red soles of her Louboutin slingbacks is just gorgeous.\n\n(more…)\n\nI’m glad to see Christina Aguilera attending the NBC’s 2011/2012 upfronting event in New York. I’m looking forward to see her in action in The Voice, but she’s recently giving us some lovely outfits. I’ve already written about her love for little black dresses, but now it’s clear she’s got another passion, for polka dots.\n\nThis is not the first time she has worn a Dolce & Gabbana polka dot dress, but I think she’s done the right choice: the 50’s style of some outfits by the Italian designing duo is just perfect for Christina.\n\n(more…)\n\nIt’s a pity I can’t watch NBC’s The Voice! I’ve read lots of positive reviews about it and I’d really love to watch Christina in action. Unfortunately, as you know, the show isn’t aired in Italy, where I live, so I’m content with checking screencaps from the show to see what she wore.\n\nThanks to Karlos, one of the amazing boys behind Aguilera Online, I’ve finally realized these first episodes deal with the blind auditions, so the contest hasn’t officially started yet. This is the reason why in the second episode she wore the same outfits she had worn last week.\n\nIn some clips of this episode, Christina wore two Dolce & Gabbana dresses: the first is red with black polka dots, a creation from the spring 2011 collection. I like it because it’s a trademark Dolce & Gabbana summer dress, featuring a pencil skirt, a sweetheart neckline and a 50s vibe. Christina wore it with a cut-out black belt.\n\n(more…)\n\nYesterday Christina Aguilera was spotted leaving from LAX and I must admit this got me intrigued. You know I’m so looking forward to the Costume Institute Gala in New York and I started wondering if she could be one of the guests. She’s never been invited but who knows? This morning I realized she went to the East Coast to perform at the 2nd Annual Mary J. Blige Honors Concert, which was held at the Hammerstein Ballroom to benefit FFAWN.\n\nHer outfit totally surprised me. I was expecting her to wear a little black dress, because this seems to be the current trend she’s following, but I couldn’t imagine she would wear something so lovely!\n\n(more…)\n\nI anticipated it when I last wrote about Christina Aguilera’s style, so here is what she wore during the blind auditions’ first round of NBC’s The Voice. Since the programme is not aired in Italy, I hope you’ll forgive me if I don’t comment on the programme itself; for this reason, I’ll just focus on her outfits.\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn’t find any full-figure picture of Christina. The screencap above doesn’t show her dress, but we can get an idea of what she wore. I’ve already pointed out she’s recently been wearing lots of little black dresses and I don’t feel like complaining about that, as long as she looks this great. In this case, the black dress has a plunging neckline and is worn with a matching belt.\n\n(more…)\n\nAs I wrote some days ago, Christina Aguilera has turned an important page in her career: the new NBC singing competition, The Voice, has premiered on April 26th and she is one of the vocal coaches of the programme. I will devote a post to each episode, but in the meantime here is what she wore while promoting the tv programme at the Tonight Show with Jay Leno on April 25th and at the Ellen DeGeneres Show, which aired on April 26th.\n\nWhen it comes to her style, many have pointed out that it looks she’s sticking to a sort of uniform, i.e. little black dress and towering high heels. This was intended as a criticism, but I think it can be seen as a positive turn: she’s finally found something which suits her and it’s clear she sticks to it, with some minor variations. It would be awesome if she stepped out of her safety circle, but I think she’ll do it, sooner or later.\n\nHer appearance at the Tonight Show with Jay Leno blew me away: she looked amazing! I don’t know what she did, but her hair looked fantastic, much better than during her latest public outing. She wore a super-short black dress by Worth Paris, with spaghetti straps and latticed details on the bodice. I am in awe of her necklaces, both vintage pieces – a cross pendant with diamonds and onyx, and a stunning diamond sautoir with a pearl tassel. She also wore a ring with central onyx and chandelier earrings.\n\n(more…)\n\nIt’s been a while since I last wrote about Christina Aguilera’s style. The Voice, the NBC tv programme where she’ll be a vocal coach for new talents, is premiering on April 26th, so I guess there’ll soon be plenty of new outfits to write about. In the meantime, she made a public appearance last April 20th, when she was honoured at The Abbey, a bar and restaurant on Robertson Boulevard in West Hollywood. Founded in 1991 by David Cooley and considered one of the most famous gay and lesbian bars, it has started its own Gay Walk of Fame with Christina, who left her hand and foot prints in the cement.\n\nNo wonder she channelled her inner Mae West for the occasion, wearing a set of vintage lingerie. I’ve read many many negative reviews of this outfit, which I expected: underwear as outerwear is often considered a no-no, and such underwear seems to be there to be criticised, but here we’re talking of Christina. She will never be an example of understated elegance but she’s always done her own thing, despite harsh criticism, and one must give her credit for that.\n\n(more…)\n\nThis woman surprises me all the time! After a series of unfortunate events and a stint in prison [1], Christina is back on track (I hope so) with a brand-new job – she’ll be one of the vocal coaches in the upcoming NBC programme The Voice. Will this new chapter in her career bring her magic back? Will it boost her music production? Only time will tell, but in the meantime I’m super-excited: a tv programme means lots of outfits to write about!\n\nWhen she attended the press conference, she chose a very nice outfit, which included a strapless red dress, chinched at the waist by a black belt, and spiked slingbacks. I’m glad she didn’t over-accessorize it, keeping the jewellery department simple. I’ve complained many times about her kind of schizophrenic style, but it looks like she’s slowly finding her own voice when it comes to image. I’d love if she experimented more, but it’s clear she wants to stick to what she knows suits her best.\n\n(more…)"
