        "text": "1. Christina Christina Aguilera Aguilera\n\n2. HER CHILDHOOD LIFE Christina Maria Aguilera was born on December 18, 1980 in Staten Island, New York. Christina first appeared on television in 1990 as a contestant on the Star Search program, and went on to star in Disney Channel's television series The Mickey Mouse Club House from 1993–1994. Aguilera signed to RCA Records after recording ―Reflection\", the theme song for the animated film Mulan (1998).\n\n3. HER TEENAGE YEARS In 1999, Aguilera came to prominence following her debut album Christina Aguilera, which was a commercial success spawning three number one singles on the Billboard Hot 100—\"Genie in a Bottle\", \"What a Girl Wants\", and \"Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You).\"[6] Her sophomore and her debut Latin-pop album, Mi Reflejo (2000), a Christmas third studio album, My Kind of Christmas (2000), and several collaborations followed which garnered Aguilera worldwide success, though she was displeased with her lack of input in her music and image.[7] After parting from her management, Aguilera took creative control over her fourth studio album, Stripped (2002).[8] The album's second single, \"Beautiful,\" was a commercial success and helped the album's commercial performance amidst controversy over Aguilera's image.[9][10][11] Aguilera followed up Stripped with the soul, jazz and blues inspired, Back to Basics (2006), released to positive critical acclaim.[12] The album had three commercially successful singles: \"Ain't No Other Man\", \"Hurt\" and \"Candyman\".[citation needed] Four years later Aguilera released her sixth studio album, Bionic (2010), which incorporated aspects of R&B, electropop, and synthpop and was met with mixed reviews and low sales.[13][14][15][16]\n\n4. NEW IMAGE, STRIPPED AND MARRIAGE  On October 26, 2002, Aguilera's fourth studio album, Stripped, was released. The album sold more than 330,000 copies in the first week and peaked at number two on the Billboard 200. Unlike her previous work, the album showcased Aguilera's raunchier side.[67] The majority of Stripped was co-written by Aguilera (who had recently signed a global music publishing contract with BMG Music Publishing), and was influenced by many different subjects and music styles, including contemporary R&B, gospel, soul, balladry, pop rock, and hip hop.[68] The majority of the album was produced by Scott Storch and singer- songwriter Linda Perry who produced her more personal records. Rockwilder and singer Alicia Keys also contributed a track each. Upon initial release, the album was very well-received by critics, although Aguilera's vocals were overlooked as she began to cultivate a more sexually provocative image.[69] After the release of the album, she took part in photoshoots for magazines, many of these photographs featured her nude or semi-nude. Her cover for Rolling Stone,[70] featured the singer only wearing boots and a well- placed electric guitar. It was during this time Aguilera referred to herself as \"Xtina\", even getting a tattoo of her nickname on the back [71]\n\n5. CONTINUATION  Initially, the raunchy image had a negative effect on Aguilera in the U.S., especially after the release of her controversial \"Dirrty\" music video.[10] She denied that this change was a matter of publicity, claiming that the image better reflected her true personality than did the image she cultivated back in 1999. She defended the video stating it was about power and control adding, \"I'm also at the forefront. I'm in the power position, in complete command of everything around me.\"[40] While the video for \"Dirrty\" became very popular on MTV, it disappointed on the U.S. singles chart. However, the single was a hit worldwide, reaching number one in the UK and Ireland. The second single, \"Beautiful\" received critical praise. The classically influenced ballad reached number one in several countries and peaked at No.2 in the US. \"Beautiful\" earned Aguilera the Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Three more singles (\"Fighter\", \"Can't Hold Us Down\" featuring Lil' Kim, \"The Voice Within\") were released in the following two years and were hits that helped the album stay on the charts for the next two years. Stripped stayed on the U.S. and UK album charts well into 2004, and went on to be certified four-times platinum in the U.S. with over thirteen million copies sold worldwide.[72] It appeared at number ten on Billboard's year-end album chart and Aguilera was the top female artist for 2003.[73] Kelly Clarkson's second single \"Miss Independent\" was co-written by Aguilera, having been half-finished for Stripped.\n\n6. MORE  Aguilera joined Justin Timberlake that June on the final leg of his international Justified tour, held in the US. This portion of the tour became a co-headliner called the Justified/Stripped Tour. In August, an overhead lighting grid collapsed from the ceiling of the Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey, causing major damage to the sound and video equipment below. Because the collapse occurred hours before the show, only a few stagehands were injured, but a few shows were cancelled or postponed. In the fourth quarter of that year, Aguilera continued to tour internationally without Timberlake, and changed the name of the tour to the Stripped World Tour. She also dyed her hair black. It was one of the top-grossing tours of that year, and sold out most of its venues. Rolling Stone readers named it the best tour of the year.[74] That same year she hosted the 2003 MTV Europe Music Awards and was a special guest performer with the Pussycat Dolls' dance troupe performing at the Roxy Theatre and Viper Room in Los Angeles. She also appeared on a Maxim spread alongside them, her second Maxim cover that year set record sales for the issue making it the top selling issue to date. By the end of the year she topped the annual Hot 100 list saying, \"we\n\n7. HER LIFE CONTINUED  Aguilera's first DVD live-recording from a concert tour, Stripped Live in the U.K., was released in November 2004. In light of the tour's success, another U.S. tour was scheduled to begin in mid- 2004 with a new theme. The tour however was scrapped because of the vocal cord injuries Aguilera suffered shortly before the tour's opening date. In a tribute to Madonna's performance at the inaugural MTV Video Music Awards, Aguilera performed a kiss with the singer-actress at the 2003 edition of the ceremony in August. The incident occurred during the opening performance of Madonna's songs \"Like a Virgin\" and \"Hollywood\" with fellow popstar Britney Spears.[40] Also in 2004, she hosted a Saturday Night Live episode which included a Sex & The City skit where she portrayed Samantha Jones revealing to everyone she was a man the entire time.[78]  Aguilera later decided to embrace a more mature image; this move was met with more praise than criticism, with articles using punch lines such as \"From Crass to Class.\"[79] She eventually dyed her hair cherry blonde and recorded a jingle, \"Hello\", for a Mercedes-Benz ad. Shortly after, she dyed her hair flaxen blonde and cut it short, and took on a Marilyn Monroe look; she is one of the main proponents (along with Dita Von Teese, Gwen Stefani, and Ashley Judd) in bringing back the 1920s–1940s Hollywood glamour look.[80][81] In late summer 2004, Aguilera released two singles. The first, \"Car Wash\", was a remake of the Rose Royce disco song recorded as a collaboration with rapper Missy Elliott for the soundtrack to the film Shark Tale. She voiced a small singing part in the film playing a Rastafarian jellyfish in the film's closing musical number. The second song was also a collaboration, but this time as a second single from one of Nelly's double-release albums, Sweat, titled \"Tilt Ya Head Back\". Both singles failed commercially in the US, but did considerably better in other parts of the world. Aguilera collaborated with jazz artist Herbie Hancock on a cover of Leon Russell's \"A Song for You\" recorded for Hancock's album Possibilities, released in August 2005. Aguilera and Hancock were later nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. She helped open the 50th Anniversary for Disneyland performing \"When You Wish upon a Star\", and she also collaborated with Andrea Bocelli on the song \"Somos Novios\" for his album Amore.\n\n8. MOTHERHOOD  Aguilera confirmed she was pregnant on November 4, 2007,[99] though Paris Hilton accidentally revealed her pregnancy several weeks prior during a party Aguilera hosted.[100] She gave birth to her son, Max Liron Bratman, in Los Angeles on January 12, 2008 and held a bris for him with Bratman, who is of Jewish descent, where the baby was circumcised in accordance with Jewish practice.[101] Aguilera was reportedly paid $1.5 million by People for her son's baby pictures—the sixth most expensive celebrity baby photos ever taken"
