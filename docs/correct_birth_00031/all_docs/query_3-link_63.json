        "text": "2002 - 2004\n\nFormer Mickey Mouse Club member and best friend of fellow budding singers Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake, Christina Aguilera left her pals behind to launch her own solo career as a pop star.\n\nIn 2002, after success in the music charts and a batch of number ones, Christina met her future husband Jordan Bratman. Jordan was working for Azoff Music, who managed Christina at the time. The pair were introduced by her agent and soon became a couple.\n\n2005 - 2011\n\nAfter a short engagement, Christina and Jordan married in Napa Valley, Northern California, in 2005.\n\nA month before Christina's Back to Basics world tour was due to come to an end, Christina discovered she was pregnant with her and Jordan's 1st child. Christina previously said that she thinks she conceived during a stop-off in Washington, when her tour was travelling around the US.\n\nChristina admitted later on that she was uncomfortable announcing her baby news to her fans. \"I wasn't being all like, 'Hey everybody, I'm pregnant!' I'm just not that girl,\" she said. Christina told a handful of her backing dancers and tour crew as she wanted to make sure \"they had her back\".\n\nMore like this\n\n\"There were so many things that could go wrong - somebody could slip, fall, or I could fall. There was no way in hell I was going to jeopardise my baby for the show,\" Christina stated. \"I took precautions, but I didn't want the audience to feel uncomfortable and be like, 'Pregnant lady on stage! Is she going to be OK?'\"\n\nHowever, Christina didn't even have to unveil her baby news - Paris Hilton did it for her! At a celeb-packed event, Christina's friend Paris took to the microphone and said, \"Congratulations to the most beautiful pregnant woman in the world. You're gorgeous.\" At this point, Christina apparently hid her head into Jordan's shoulder in embarrassment.\n\nChristina's shyness didn't last long. When she was 7 months pregnant, she posed naked on the front cover of Marie Claire magazine. Christina allegedly loved her nude photographs so much, she requested enlarged copies so she could have them displayed in her home!\n\n\"Christina loved those pictures and wants them up in her house so everyone can see them,\" a source said at the time. \"She also wants them to be up when the baby is born, so she can show him or her what their mum looked like when she was pregnant.\"\n\nChristina gave birth on 12 January 2008, in the Cedars Sinai Medical Center, LA. She was in labour at the same time as her friend Nicole Richie! Christina's baby was boy, named him Max Liron, and he weighed 6lb 2oz.\n\n\"This is a very joyful and special day for Jordan and I,\" Christina's statement said at the time.\n\nChristina was reportedly paid $1.5 million by People magazine for the first baby pictures of Max - the 5th most expensive baby photos ever.\n\nAfter the birth, Christina cited breatfeeding as her weight loss tool. \"I think they say that when you're breastfeeding, your weight kind of slims down. It's a little easier. It's like a workout within itself.\"\n\nIn late 2010, it was announced that Christina and husband Jordan were separating. Christina later filed for divorce, and this was finalised in April 2011. Christina and Jordan currently share joint custody of their son Max.\n\nChristina began dating Matthew Rutler at the end of 2010.\n\n2011 - 2017\n\nIn February 2014, Christina and Matthew announced their engagement.\n\nIn August 2014, Christina and Matthew Rutler welcomed their 1st child together, Christina's 2nd child, a daughter named Summer Rain Rutler."
