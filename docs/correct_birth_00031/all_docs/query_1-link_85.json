I have no ill feeling for [Britney Spears] and vice versa. I am proud of all the achievements she has made in her career, she is a very hard-working person. I have nothing but love for her.\n\n[on Eminem's lyrics in \"The Real Slim Shady\" which contained sexual references about her] It's disgusting and offensive and above all it's not true.\n\n[on singing the remake of \"Lady Marmalade\" with Pink, Mya and Lil' Kim] It's the closest I ever got to being in a girl group.\n\nI like to be edgy, I like to be different. I'm a little bit of rebel.\n\n[After winning an MTV Award for the video, \"Lady Marmalade\", shared with singers Mya, Pink and Lil' Kim] The big hair paid off!\n\nIt's funny how society places such strict standards upon young blonde females. We're supposed to play the clean-cut view the public wants of us. But I am not your little cookie-cutter virgin.\n\nIt's human nature to have a sexual side.\n\nI think that whatever size or shape body you have, it's important to embrace it and get down! The female body is something that's so beautiful. I wish women would be proud of their bodies and not dis other women for being proud of theirs!\n\nYou can take it or leave it, but I'm not going to change, not for anyone.\n\nIt's been quite a roller-coaster ride, But I think I've grown and learned a lot about myself. In this business, it's often all about hype, record sales, and a crazy schedule of traveling, performances, and it can be easy to get lost in all that. But for me, the greatest thing is being able to interact with fans and touch peoples' lives. I know that's a greater accomplishment than selling records. For that I give thanks. I simply love the job I'm doing.\n\nHold your head high and sway your hips when you walk!\n\nPower is making a statement about who you are.\n\nMy parents divorce and hard times at school, all those things combined to mold me, to make me grow up quicker. And it gave me the drive to pursue my dreams that I woundn't necessarily have had otherwise.\n\nI have grown up now and have no need to dress like that anymore. I want my music to speak for me rather than the dress or lack of dresses I wore.\n\nConfidence is the hugest thing - once you exude that, guys catch on.\n\n[on why she wrote the song \"I'm OK\", which is her take on her father Fausto Aguilera's abusive behavior before her parents separated] It is such a hush-hush topic because it happens in the home. I definitely wrote that song not to badmouth him at all, but one, for a healing process for myself, and two, to give people hope or a voice to relate to. To know that you can get through it and that it will be okay.\n\nBe a strong female - don't be afraid of the flack that goes along with that.\n\nObviously, all the positives are very flattering and being compared to [Mariah Carey], and I get a lot of [Britney Spears] comparisons as well, and she's extremely talented, but we are two different artists and even when I'm doing radio interviews and stuff they want to ask me very personal questions about her and you have to be a little protective of yourself and what you say because there are so many people wanting to get you to say things and pulling you in so many directions.\n\nMy inspiration, I've had many, again, starting with Julie Andrews at a young age. But growing up, I sang Whitney Houston songs in talent shows. But when I discovered Mariah Carey and \"Vision of Love\", that was a breath of fresh air and I adored her from that moment on and idolized her. It's really amazing that in articles I've been compared to her. It's truly unbelievable because, whenever I was younger, I would ask my mom, \"Do you think I'll ever be as big and sing as well as Mariah Carey?\" And now that it has happened, my mom says, \"I knew it would happen.\".\n\nI wouldn't feel comfortable wearing clothes that covered my entire body.\n\n[on her childhood] I never really had this father figure, which never bothered me. I had my mom, I had people that did love me and care for me.\n\n[on not having her father to walk her down the aisle at her wedding] I'm a performer. I can totally walk myself down the aisle. I just realized it would be really nice to have that male protector in your life, to have felt that your entire life, and to have that one person give you away to the next man that's going to take care of you.\n\n[on having kids with her husband of one year, Jordan Bratman] In five years time I'd probably like to start thinking about a child.\n\nScrapbooking - I just love it! I could sit on the floor for weeks and put together collages, keepsakes and photos.\"\n\n[on Sade] When it comes to sexy, smooth, elegant R+B music, Sade IS the standard. I can't wait to hear her new work.\n\nI felt caged by my childhood. And unsafe: Bad things happened in my home; there was violence. The Sound of Music (1965) looked like a form of release. I would open my bedroom window to sing out like Maria. In my own way, I'd be in those hills. Sometimes, I still feel like going to the window and singing out all my troubles.\n\n[on her emotional state preceding the recording of \"Stripped\"] People betrayed me and I had a really hard time. That, along with what I'd been through with my family and my father and hard times at school meant I was knocked down. It was too much and I felt I'd been through the wringer - I was like a punch bag. I think talking to people is important and my family have helped me through it. I'd definitely be open to going to a therapist. I went when I was younger. But making this record (\"Stripped\") has been therapeutic. It's a tough record, it's personal and it's made me feel vulnerable. It's honest. Emotionally, I've laid myself bare - it's what's in my heart. I've been writing a lot of poems and I wanted to disappear from the public eye and live life for a minute. I didn't want to play it safe.\n\nPeople spend money on beauty potions, but a good night's rest makes all the difference.\n\n[on her fluctuating weight/weight gain and body] I've been on all spectrums. I've been in this (business) for a long time. I came out on the scene when I was 17 years old. You can never be too much of anything. You can never be too perfect, too thin, too curvy, voluptuous this, that. I've been on all sides of the spectrum as far as any female in this business. You got to be a strong, powerful, very confident woman. Women, we are definitely under a microscope and under massive scrutiny. As long as I am happy in my own skin, that is all the confirmation I need. I have a boyfriend that loves my body. I love my body, my son is healthy and happy and that is all that matters.\n\n[on her fluctuating weight] I've been through my highs, I've been through my lows; I've been through the gamut of all things in this business. Being too thin. Being bigger. I've been criticized for being on both sides of the scale. It's noise I block out automatically.\n\nI have certain physical features that I favor over others. We all have our areas. When I worked on Burlesque, I lost so much weight that I was too skinny. I don't weigh myself - it's all about how I feel in my clothes. What looks good on one person might not look good on another body type. I happen to be very confident in my own skin. It takes time to get to that place, but it's all about embracing yourself and your body.\n\nIt's hard not having the consistency of a partnership on a daily basis. It's a struggle. But I can't single out my ex-husband [as the problem] because he's a devoted father and great with my son. We always make sure that we put Max first. I have help from family and good people around me in support of my career. I couldn't do what I do without a strong team behind me.\n\nI'm a Sagittarius, and I'm not big on, you know, setting and making and committing to every single plan in the calendar, in the schedule. You know, maybe because I was also given a schedule since I was such a little girl. I had to be on time for this and that, and other things, so it was just like, aaagh! Let me breathe, give me some room, you know, some space. You know, for me, I like to go with the flow. I love to be open to what the universe has in store for me, be open to listening to the signs, feeling my instinct and just, you know, I'm constantly on the journey and the path of growth. When I stop growing, then I'll probably be dead... because I think, you know, the fascination and the want to learn and the need to grow should always stay with you. There's always new adventures around the corner, places to go visit, places to explore, new cultures and things to take in, to draw inspiration from, new people. You know, I'm constantly taking up new things and trying to think outside the box here and there, and... you know, sometimes life throws curve balls, and you get set back, but it's all about getting back up and getting back in the game, and, you know, exploring what's new. So, do I know what's in the future, five, ten years from now? I have no idea, but I like it that way. All I do, all I *can* do, is focus on the here and now. Being happy is ultimately everything... and I never want to stop. I will never be happy meeting a goal and saying, \"Okay, I reached my goal. That's it. I'm done.\" Never! I will always have that passion and that drive and that fire inside me to continue on, to grow, to learn more, to be a better artist, a different artist. How can I reinvent myself? It's all such a beautiful process, and I'm constantly open to it.\n\n[on some people saying she is not Latina enough] I've dealt with that my whole life. I don't speak the language fluently. And I'm split right down the middle, half-Irish and half-Ecuadorian. I should not have to prove my ethnicity to anyone. I know who I am.\n\nWhen my son Max looked at me and said, \"Mommy, you look so pretty,\" was a mommy moment I will never forget.\n\nI'd rather do what I love and get tomatoes thrown at me than get up there and be fake and get applause. I've got to be me.\n\nWhen I sing, I believe it is the only time I can be myself and express all of me and who I am. I find a home in music, and I hope my music and my voice allows others to find a home as well. That's why this is so important to me and so special.\n\n[Billboard interview, May 2018] To me, there's nothing like an amazing hip-hop beat. At the end of the day, I am a soul singer. When you strip back the words 'pop star' and the many things that I've done, singing soulfully is where my core, my root and my heart really is. And as you can see, it's what I'm inspired by.\n\n[on defending her album Bionic] I can proudly say [Bionic] was ahead of its time, to be honest. It wasn't so commercialized. You had to really be a music lover, be a true fan of music and the love of being open to really appreciate that record. It's just a special piece in my body of work that will forever live on. The older the record gets the more people will come to appreciate it actually and check it out.\n\nTrying too hard to be sexy is the worst thing you can do. Sexiness should be effortless.\n\n[on battling Britney Spears, 2001] I hate the fact that people are obsessed with trying to put me against Britney. If we both released a record on the same day and one of us got to No. 1 before the other, it might be hard, but I'm sure we would be okay about it.\n\nSometimes in life things that happen to you, that are seemingly negative (at that time) can turn out to be a positive later in life.\n\nNothing is ever a setback. If anything, it just motivates you for what's next.\n\nEverybody needs that one person that takes you to the right place to see all the positives in your life.\n\nOne of the things that I truly have had to learn, sometimes the hard way, but that I'd like to share with you is to trust your own instincts no matter what people might say about you, no matter what criticism or what negativity might come your way for just being who you are, and just being yourself, it's so important. Tonight is your night.\n\nYou are beautiful in every single way. Words can't bring you down.\n\nIt's important to recognize your own self-destructive behavior and be honest about it. You're only hurting yourself or losing out on your truth and happiness. I'm not afraid to face my own personal stuff. It's so important to dig it up and figure it out and move on.\n\nI especially like to come on the show and really support women. We have it harder than anybody, having to walk in our high heels while these guys are wearing sneakers and boots. I get so jealous. But, my heart goes out to every girl that comes on here. I'm no stranger to criticism. That's just part of it. You're never going to be good enough, or just the right thing in everybody's eyes.\n\n[on doing the movie Burlesque (2010), 2010] The sky is the limit. I'm just following where life takes me. It's been an incredible journey, thus far, and I know that this next chapter in my life, and doing this movie, opens up a whole new world of opportunity for me. I'm just excited to see where it goes.\n\n[on being publicly fat shamed, 2012] I am Ecuadorian, but people felt so safe passing me off as a skinny, blue-eyed white girl. They (music executives) called this serious emergency meeting about how there was a lot of backlash about my weight. Basically, they told me I would affect a lot of people if I gained weight -the production, musical directors. I told them...'You are working with a fat girl. Know it now and get over it. My body can't put anyone in jeopardy of not making money anymore -my body is just not on the table that way anymore. They need a reminder sometimes that I don't belong to them. It's my body.\n\nI think they say that when you're breast feeding, you know, your weight kind of slims down. It's a little easier. It's like a workout within itself. It's very tiring actually and you find yourself snacking more often."
