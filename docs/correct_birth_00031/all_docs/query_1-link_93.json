        "text": "Christina Maria Aguilera was born on December 18, 1980 in Staten Island, New York. Her parents' names are Fausto Wagner Xavier Aguilera and Shelly Loraine. Christina has gotten over 50 awards at the Grammys, Billboard, and Emmy Awards. She has one child who is about 16 months and she has been with her husband for 5 years. Christina first appeared on national TV as a contestant on the Star Search program in 1990.\n\nI am very inspired by Christina Aguilera because she has had a difficult life and she still moves on. She has gone very far in her life with not only her music, but with her husband and the rest of her life too. The music she writes has amazing words that have helped me get through so much. She can reach higher notes than most people can and she can do things with her voice that I have never heard anybody else do before. I look up to her so much because she has a lot to say in this world and she is starting to say it."
