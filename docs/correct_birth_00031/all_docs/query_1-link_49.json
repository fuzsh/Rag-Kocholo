        "text": "(CBS 11) - What company are we referring to when mentioning Christina Aguilera? That of Lil'Kim, Mya and Pink. Four artists working together to produce a #1 hit in 2001!\n\nAguilera (born December 18, 1980 in Staten Island, New York) of Irish and Ecuadorian descent, was raised in Wexford, Pennsylvania. She has been a very successful pop singer/songwriter. She also was a regular on The Mickey Mouse Club TV show from 1992-1993.\n\nIn 2001, these four artists released \"Lady Marmalade,\" written originally by Bob Crewe and Kenny Nolan.\n\nI think most everyone is familiar with this song going back to the Patti LaBelle version in 1975. Italian pop singer Sabrina Salerno recorded it in 1987. The English-Canadian girl group All Saints also recorded it in 1998.\n\nThis version was written by Crewe (who did a lot of work with Mitch Ryder & The Detroit Wheels in the 1960's), Nolan, Lil' Kim and Missy Elliot, produced by Rockwilder and Elliott, and running 4:24 on the Interscope label.\n\nThis version was part of a medley in the movie \"Moulin Rouge\" starring Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. It was a #1 hit on Billboard and stayed on the charts for 17 weeks. It was Aguilera's last #1 song during the period 1999-2008. It was also #1 worldwide in fourteen countries. In the U.S., it was also #1 on the Mainstream Top 40 and Rhythmic charts.\n\nEnjoy this version from the movie \"Moulin Rouge.\""
