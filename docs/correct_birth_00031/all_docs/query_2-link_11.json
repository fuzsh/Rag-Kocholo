        "text": "MTV: Why don’t you begin by telling a little about yourself.\n\nChristina Aguilera: I was born in Staten Island, New York. But I call my hometown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, because that’s basically where I ended up from age eight on. But right after Staten Island… I’ve lived everywhere from Texas, to Japan for three years, to New Jersey. I’m this traveling girl. My father was in the Army, so I guess I’m an Army brat.\n\nMTV: I was going to ask you about your last name….\n\nChristina: A lot of people wanna perceive [me] as a little white girl, trying to sound however. I’m just singing, like, what feels natural to me and what’s most comfortable. And I’m not completely white. I am half Hispanic, half American-Irish. My father is from Ecuador, South America, so I am proud of my Latin roots. I’d like to get the Spanish community involved as well, being that my last name is Aguilera, and record a Spanish album one day and release it. That is really important to me.\n\nMTV: So how long have you been singing and performing?\n\nChristina: I’ve been singing and performing ever since I was in diapers, basically. I mean, from laying a towel on the floor in the bathroom and using the shampoo bottle as a microphone, to local block parties and talent shows and things like that, and to “Star Search,” “[The New] Mickey Mouse Club,” and the record deal.\n\nMTV: Tell us about your “Star Search” experience first.\n\nChristina: It was awesome. I got to meet Ed McMahon, and it was my first time in L.A., and I lost on “Star Search,” so that was a little devastating for an eight-year-old. I was up against a twelve-year-old, so I was like, “Not fair!” But it was cool.\n\nMTV: Can you tell me about your experience as a Mouseketeer?\n\nChristina: Being a Mouseketeer on the “Mickey Mouse Club” was cool. I was on for ages twelve and thirteen. I was on the last two seasons, and I was in pretty good company, with fellow Mouseketeers Britney Spears, J. C. and Justin from ‘N Sync, Keri Russell from “Felicity.” So we all had fun on that show.\n\nMTV: Any funny anecdotes or stories that you have from that?\n\nChristina: There was some crazy things that happened on the set. People were always telling jokes, playing pranks and stuff like that, but… I have to keep certain things secret.\n\nMTV: Tell us how you ended landed a record deal.\n\nChristina: I landed a record deal simultaneously as I landed the “Mulan” soundtrack. I had just turned seventeen years old and during the same week, I just landed both. I recorded for the “Mulan” soundtrack first and then a few months later I was out in L.A. doing the record for about six months.\n\nMTV: What are your biggest fears about being in the entertainment industry?\n\nChristina: You know, the comparisons kinda bother me, because that takes away from my own artistry and the other person’s. We’re all individual artists, and that sort of bothers me. Maybe “here today, gone tomorrow” sort of scares me. But I plan on working hard to make sure that doesn’t happen. Staying focused.\n\nMTV: How do you distinguish yourself from someone likeBritney Spears or some other teen pop idols?\n\nChristina:Well, what’s cool is that I’m a fan of Britney Spears. I’m a fan of Mariah Carey, who I’ve also been compared to, which is amazing. I mean, we are all our own individual artists, you know. I’m not a Britney Spears, and Britney Spears isn’t me. But I think especially when people hear more of my music… it’ll definitely distinguish who I am. On the upcoming album, it is a pop-R&B album, but I have a lot of soul, and there’s some rangy vocals in there, so it gets kinda crazy. We’ve got everything from mid-tempos to really big ballads .\n\nMTV: Who are your influences?\n\nChristina: I would grow up in the talent shows singing WhitneyHouston songs. “I Wanna Dance with Somebody” from, you know, back in ’90 or ’91 or whenever that was. I have a love for her. I have a love for Mariah Carey. Her style and technique is amazing. Brian McKnight I really admire. He’s my favorite male vocalist. As far as blues goes, because I’m a huge lover of blues, R&B, and gospel, I love Etta James. Completely. I have a lot of respect forLauryn Hill, because she’s so heartfelt and deep on everything that comes out of her.\n\nMTV: What’s in your Walkman right now?\n\nChristina: The new Limp Bizkit CD. I like Fred Durst, and I love that band.\n\nMTV: What’s in your VCR right now?\n\nChristina: Janet Jackson, “Velvet Rope” tour. I just love watching people’s performance videos. And she, being an amazing performer, her and Madonna, I aspire to do my little shows like that one day.\n\nMTV: Are you planning to tour any time soon?\n\nChristina: I am going to be on tour possibly with TLC, a couple of dates with ‘N Sync. I’m doing a few things with Lilith Fair, a lot of radio shows.\n\nMTV: Are you excited to be reunited with some of the guys from ‘N Sync on tour?\n\nChristina: Oh, that’s funny. The ‘N Sync guys are very cool. I mean, who knows? It’s always good to see them, and we will run into each other occasionally, and being that we were all great friends back in the [“Mickey Mouse Club”] days it’ll be fun. I do miss Britney, though.\n\nMTV: What are your plans for Lilith Fair?\n\nChristina: I am not going to be singing “Genie in a Bottle” at all. It’s a time where I think I can get in front of a bunch of women and really sing my heart out to just piano and vocal. It’s just a piano and a mic and that’s it. I’ll get bluesy with Etta James’ “At Last,” which is one of my favorite songs.\n\nMTV: If you weren’t singing, what would you be doing right now?\n\nChristina: I can’t really picture me doing anything else besides what I am doing now. I don’t know, but something funny. I always wanted to work the window at a drive-thru fast food restaurant. I always thought it was a cool thing to do.\n\nMTV: Last question. If you could describe yourself as one animal, what would it be?\n\nChristina: This is a funny question. I guess, everyone says that I remind them of a cat. Like, I’m sort of laid back all the time, but when I get onstage, it’s like, I sort of pounce… it’s like I come alive. So I can surprise people like that. So I guess a little kitty cat.\n\nPop singer. Born Christina Maria Aguilera on December 18, 1980, in Staten Island, New York, to parents Fausto Xavier Aguilera and his wife, Shelly Loraine Fidler. Her early home life was troubled. Christina’s father, an Ecuadorian immigrant and sergeant in the U.S. Army, was an abusive husband. It wasn’t until Aguilera was 6 that her mother managed to end the marriage and move her two daughters (Christina and her younger sister, Rachel) to a new life in Rochester, Pennsylvania.\n\nFrom an early age Aguilera loved music, a gift she no doubt inherited from her musical mother, an experienced violin and piano player. By the time she was in elementary school, Aguilera’s big voice had swept through a number of local talent shows, causing harsh envy from her schoolmates and even some parents. It became so bad that eventually Christina’s mother made the decision to home-school her daughter.\n\nStill, Christina continued to perform, and in 1990 she earned a spot on the nationally syndicated television program, Star Search. There, the 9-year-old prodigy wowed audiences with a mesmerizing rendition of Etta James’ “A Sunday Kind of Love,” to take home second place.\n\nIn 1993, Aguilera earned more national attention when she landed a spot as a Mouseketeer on The New Mickey Mouse Club. Her fellow cast mates were a collection of future stars that included Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears, Ryan Gosling, and Keri Russell. Aguilera’s time on the program lasted just two years before the ambitious singer moved with her mother to Japan to record the hit single “All I Wanna Do” with Japanese pop icon Keizo Nakanishi. More success soon followed.\n\nIn 1998 Aguilera was tapped to sing the song “Reflection” on the soundtrack for the Walt Disney film, Mulan. A year later, Aguilera made her concert debut at the all female concert festival, Lilith Fair and signed with RCA Records. She released her self-titled debut album in 1999, a successful record that would go on to sell more than 8 million copies thanks to two big Billboard hits: “Genie in a Bottle” and the No. 1 single “What a Girl Wants.” The album earned Aguilera Best New Artist honors at the 2000 Grammy Awards.\n\nWith her fellow Mouseketeer mates Spears and Timberlake also lighting up the charts with their respective music, Aguilera became one of the leading faces of a group of teen pop stars. But Aguilera was not comfortable maintaining the squeaky clean image this sort of role foisted upon her. After teaming up with Pink, Mya and Lil’ Kim for the popular single “Lady Marmalade” Aguilera released her second album, Stripped, in October 2002. As its title suggested, the pop superstar had embarked down a new path. Highly sexualized and more commanding, the album featured a number of hit singles, including “Dirrty,” “Beautiful” and “Make Over.”\n\nCoupled with a series of new piercings and tattoos, the new music startled some critics, endeared her to others, and sold more than 4 million records. Aguilera, for her part, was unapologetic about the music or her look.\n\n“I knew it was a bold move, and I knew a lot of people would not be ready for it,” she told The New York Times.\n\nIn 2006 Aguilera changed course again with the release of Back to Basics, a two-disc collection of influential standards from the 1920s through the 1940s. Like she’d done with her previous album, Aguilera used the music to help define her style. For a time she adopted a classic Jean Harlow look.\n\nAs Aguilera’s career continued to blossom, her personal life took off as well. In November 2005, she married her longtime boyfriend and record producer Jordan Bratman. In January 2008, Bratman and Aguilera became parents with the birth of their son, Max.\n\nAlong the way, Aguilera showed her compassionate side, working with AIDS awareness campaigns and affiliating herself with the Women’s Center and Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh. In early 2010, she took on the role of Ambassador Against Hunger for the World Food Program, a responsibility that soon led her to Haiti to help earthquake victims there.\n\nIn recent years, Aguilera’s personal and professional life has been a bit of a roller coaster. In late 2010, she and Bratman separated. Not long after, Aguilera suffered through a couple of very public stumbles. The first of those came at the Super Bowl in February 2011, where seemed to forget some of the lyrics to the National Anthem. Not long after, the pop star was arrested for public intoxication. Both incidents sparked a wave of stories concerning Aguilera’s possible alcohol problems.\n\nHer success as a singer, however, will no doubt continue. In all Aguilera has sold more than 25 million albums, and has collected three Grammy awards."
