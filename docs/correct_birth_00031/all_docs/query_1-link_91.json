        "text": "One of the most talked about Super Bowl fumbles did not take place during the big game last night, but before it.\n\nPrior to the kickoff, Staten Island-born Christina Aguilera belted out the lines of the Star Spangled Banner, an opportunity that she claimed was “a dream come true.” Her dream quickly turned into a nightmare as she botched the lyrics of the National Anthem.\n\nAguilera, who is reportedly devastated by the incident, issued a public apology today saying, “I can only hope that everyone could feel my love for this country and that the true spirit of it’s anthem still came through.”\n\nAguilera spent the first seven year’s of her life as a resident Islander before moving to Rochester, Pa., a town located just outside of Pittsburgh. The Grammy-winning singer performed the National Anthem (correctly) many times during her youth, often at Pittsburgh sports games."
