        "text": "ARLINGTON, Texas (AP/CBSNewYork) -- Christina Aguilera flubbed a line as she belted out the national anthem at the start of the Super Bowl Sunday night.\n\nWhen Aguilera, who was born in Staten Island, was supposed to sing the line \"O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming,\" she instead repeated an earlier line, with a slight variation.\n\nThe Grammy Award winner sang \"What so proudly we watched at the twilight's last gleaming,\" which is the same line from earlier in the song but with the word 'watched' instead of the word 'hailed.'\n\nThe mistake immediately set social networks abuzz with people commenting on the error.\n\nAguilera's representative did not immediately return a call and e-mail seeking comment.\n\nSOUND-OFF: Did you catch Christina Aguilera's anthem gaffe live? Give us your thoughts in the comments section...\n\nShe's not the first person to mess up the lines of \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" In 2001, Macy Gray was famously booed for her off-kilter rendition of the national anthem.\n\nRELATED: Cars & Comedy Dominate Super Bowl Advertising\n\nShe garbled the words at the Pro Football Hall of Fame exhibition game in Canton, Ohio, her home state. She later told The Associated Press: \"That was definitely life's most embarrassing moment.\"\n\n(TM and Copyright 2011 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
