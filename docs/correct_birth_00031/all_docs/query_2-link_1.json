There was something about such work that made you feel useful and important – sending off onions that you had planted and seen grow from a mere speck of green, that you tended and weeded, had pulled up and washed and even loaded on the wagon – seeing them go off to feed the great city of New York.\"\n\nWashington Irving, author of \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,\" spent time on the Island during the War of 1812, when he served as aide-de-camp to Gov.

He’s now with the Minnesota Twins.\n\nBobby Thomson is best known for “The Shot Heard ‘Round the World,” a homer over the left-field fence in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 3 of the 1951 National League Championship at the Polo Grounds. The blast climaxed the New York Giants’ seemingly impossible drive to take the pennant from the Brooklyn Dodgers.

Pope John Paul II granted the Archdiocese of New York permission to open her “cause” for sainthood in March 2000, thereby officially making her a “Servant of God” in the eyes of the Catholic Church. Her grave is in Resurrection Cemetery, Pleasant Plains.\n\nFather John Christopher Drumgoole, an Irish immigrant, founded Mount Loretto in Pleasant Plains, a mission for homeless children, in 1883. He died just five years later, but records indicate that more than 19,000 youngsters came under his care during his years of service in Manhattan and on Staten Island. His dedication to them was so deep that he reportedly turned down an invitation from Pope Leo XIII to join the pontiff for his golden jubilee in 1887.\n\nElizabeth Ann Bayley Seton, the first person born in the United States to be canonized a saint in the Catholic Church (September 14, 1975), lived for a time on Staten Island as a child. Her maternal grandparents, Mary Bayeux and Dr. Richard Charlton, resided here when Dr. Charlton was pastor of St. Andrew’s Episcopal Church. She founded the American Sisters of Charity, the first sisterhood native to the U.S., in 1809. Bayley Seton Hospital is named for her."
