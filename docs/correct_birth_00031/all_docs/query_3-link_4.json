        "text": "Christina Aguilera is one of the preeminent musical performers in the world. With a powerful voice and wide vocal range, she boasts an unmatched stage and recording presence that has entertained fans all over the world, from the iconic soundtracks of Mulan and Moulin Rouge, to recent hits like the Golden Globe®-nominated Burlesque, her stead on NBC’s The Voice, and appearances on ABC’s Nashville. Selling more than 25 million records, Christina has also garnered six Grammy Awards® including a Latin Grammy Award for her musical accomplishments.\n\nHer rendition of “Reflection” was met with high acclaim and ultimately landed the musician a recording deal with RCA.\n\nBorn in Staten Island, New York, and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Christina rose to fame early with a breakout performance as a junior vocalist on Star Search in 1990. Just a few short years later she took to the Disney stage, appearing on Disney Channel’s popular update of the Mickey Mouse Club, joining the show in May 1993 for two seasons. At the time, Christina posited that her goal was “to become a good all-around performer,” and cited inspiration from popular recording artists such as Whitney Houston, En Vogue, Boyz II Men, and Janet Jackson. Taking cues from her musical idols, and admiring actors like Julia Roberts and Tom Hanks, it’s no surprise that the Mouseketeer would go on to a diverse career in the entertainment industry.\n\nDuring the production of Mulan (1998), The Walt Disney Studios was searching for an artist to perform a pop version of Matthew Wilder and David Zippel’s “Reflection” for the movie’s soundtrack (the song would also be performed by fellow Disney Legend Lea Salonga in the film). “We were looking for a voice that conveys a feeling, not just narrates it,” said Chris Montan, Executive Music Producer for Disney Animation at the time. “Christina’s voice brings a mature sensibility to the song.” At the time of the film’s release, Christina noted: “The best thing about singing the part of a great heroine such as Mulan is that I think she is a really great role model… she goes after what she wants with such bravery. She didn’t let any limitations hold her back and succeeded in the end. Also, it feels awesome to be in such wonderful company as Celine Dion and Vanessa Williams, in being a part of Disney history. I can’t believe I got to do it!” Her rendition of “Reflection” was met with high acclaim and ultimately landed the musician a recording deal with RCA. The song has since gone on to become a standard associated with Disney film music.\n\nChristina would take part in additional Disney projects several times throughout her career, including appearances and performances on Disney’s 2 Hour Tour (2000) and the Walt Disney World Summer Jam Concert (2000), while her song “Blessed” was featured in the 2000 Disney Channel Original Movie Miracle in Lane 2. She has performed on ABC’s Emmy®-winning Dancing with the Stars, and was featured on the network’s hit series Nashville in 2015 as singer Jade St. John. Most recently, Christina entertained New Year’s revelers during the 2019 telecast of Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest, a show that has aired for nearly 50 years and has come to be known as an American institution.\n\nA lifelong fan of Disney Parks and Resorts, Christina performed at the 2005 kickoff ceremony for “The Happiest Homecoming on Earth,” Disneyland’s 50th anniversary celebration, and was a featured performer during the Disney Parks Christmas Day Parade telecast in 2011. She is the recipient of the Billboard Music Award, an MTV Europe Award, Rolling Stone Music Awards, NRJ Awards, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame."
