        "text": "American singer and songwriter (born 1980)\n\nFor other uses, see Christina Aguilera (disambiguation).\n\nNot to be confused with Christina Aguilar.\n\nChristina María Aguilera ( AG-il-AIR-ə, Spanish: [kɾisˈtina maˈɾi.a aɣiˈleɾa];[1] born December 18, 1980) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and television personality. Referred to as the \"Voice of a Generation\", she is noted for her four-octave vocal range, use of the whistle register, and incorporating feminism and sexuality into her music. Recognized as an influential figure in popular music, she was also named a Disney Legend, in recognition for her contributions to The Walt Disney Company.\n\nAfter appearing on The All-New Mickey Mouse Club (1993–1994) as a child, Aguilera recorded the theme song, \"Reflection\", for the animated film Mulan (1998) and signed a record deal with RCA Records. She rose to fame in 1999 with her self-titled debut album which gained three number one singles on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 including \"Genie in a Bottle\", \"What a Girl Wants\" and \"Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)\". After winning the Grammy Award for Best New Artist, she followed with Mi Reflejo (2000) and My Kind of Christmas (2000); with the former becoming the best-selling Latin pop album of 2000. Seeking a departure from her teen idol image, Aguilera took on a more provocative image and released Stripped (2002), which went on to become one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century. After another musical reinvention, she released the critically praised Back to Basics (2006). Throughout these periods, she amassed various worldwide hits including the number one single \"Lady Marmalade\", alongside \"Beautiful\", \"Dirrty\", \"Can't Hold Us Down\", \"Fighter\", \"Ain't No Other Man\" and \"Hurt\".\n\nDuring the early 2010s, Aguilera released the albums Bionic (2010) and Lotus (2012) which peaked inside the top ten of the U.S. Billboard 200. She returned to mainstream success with a string of collaborations, including \"Feel This Moment\", \"Say Something\", and \"Moves like Jagger\"; the latter reached number one on the Hot 100, making Aguilera one of the few artists to reach the number one spot over three decades. She found critical success with her follow-up albums Liberation (2018) and Aguilera (2022) and has since performed in two concert residencies. Outside of music, she also starred in the 2010 film Burlesque and contributed to its soundtrack, earning a Golden Globe Award nomination. Her concurrent ventures included a role in the series Nashville (2015), roles in films The Emoji Movie (2017) and Zoe (2018), becoming an ambassador for the World Food Programme (WFP), co-founding the company Playground, and serving as a coach on the reality competition show The Voice (2011–2016).\n\nAguilera is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of over 90 million records sold worldwide.[2] As a triple threat entertainer, she has been named one of the greatest vocalists of all time by Rolling Stone and Consequence of Sound and has been hailed as one of the most successful artists to come out of the 2000s. Billboard named her the twentieth most successful artist of the 2000s decade, and was ranked eighth on VH1's list of greatest women in music. She has since been regarded as one of the most influential Latin artists in the entertainment industry, having helped shape the \"Latin explosion\" in the music industry. Her accolades include five Grammy Awards, two Latin Grammy Awards, six ALMA Awards, two MTV Video Music Awards (VMA), one Billboard Music Award, one Guinness World Record, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nChristina María Aguilera was born on December 18, 1980, in New York City, to Shelly Loraine (née Fidler) and Fausto Wagner Xavier Aguilera.[3] Her father is an Ecuadorian emigrant from Guayaquil while her mother has German, Irish, Welsh, and Dutch ancestry.[5] Fausto Aguilera was a United States Army sergeant, and Shelly Loraine was a violinist in the American Youth Symphony before becoming a Spanish translator.[6]\n\nDue to Fausto's military service, Aguilera's family moved frequently, living in New Jersey and Texas.[8] In 1983, they moved to Japan and lived in Sagamihara for at least two years. During her youth in Pittsburgh metropolitan area, Aguilera attended North Allegheny Intermediate High School before leaving there to be homeschooled to avoid bullying she experienced at school.[11]\n\nIn 1986, the family returned to the United States, and settled in Pennsylvania, where they welcomed her younger sister, Rachel, in 1986. Aguilera has spoken out about her father's physically and emotionally abusive behavior.[13] She noted that this is what made her turn to music, noting that, \"growing up in an unstable environment and whatnot, music was my only real escape\".[14] In 1987, Shelly filed to divorce Fausto and moved with Aguilera and Rachel to her mother's home in Rochester, a suburb of Pittsburgh.[15] She later married James Kearns with whom she had a son named Michael. In 2012, following decades of estrangement, Aguilera expressed interest in reconciling with her biological father.[17]\n\nAguilera moving to her grandmother's home allowed her to explore her grandmother's records, which featured mostly soul and blues singers and increased her interest in music.[18] She also began to practice singing in public and competing in talent contests. Following numerous contests, she earned reputation in her neighborhood as the \"little girl with a big voice\" and received widespread attention from local television and radio programs.[21]\n\nIn 1990, she performed the popular song \"A Sunday Kind of Love\" on the reality competition show Star Search, but was eliminated during the semi-final round.[22] Aguilera was eventually invited to sing \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" before Pittsburgh Penguins hockey, Pittsburgh Steelers football, and Pittsburgh Pirates baseball games, and at the 1992 Stanley Cup Finals.[24]\n\nCareer\n\n1993–1998: Career beginnings\n\nIn 1991, Aguilera auditioned for a position on The All-New Mickey Mouse Club (MMC), aired on the Disney Channel. She ran against 400 candidates, and while she made the shortlist she was ultimately rejected for not meeting the minimum age requirement. One year later, in 1992, Aguilera received a call from one of the show's producers asking if she was still interested in becoming a \"Mouseketeer\". She once again competed for a spot (this time, against 15,000 candidates) and was selected to join the variety program the following year. Her fellow cast members included Ryan Gosling, Keri Russell, Britney Spears, and Justin Timberlake.[27] During the show recordings—which included Aguilera performing musical numbers and comedy sketches—she moved with her family to Orlando, Florida.[28] In 1994, it was reported the series would not return for a new season.\n\nAiming to begin a music career, Aguilera moved to Japan in 1997. She was selected to record a duet with Japanese singer Keizo Nakanishi, with whom she performed in concert shows around the country. Their song, \"All I Wanna Do\", was released as a single but failed to reach commercial success. In June 1997, Aguilera went on to Romania to represent the United States in a singers contest during the Golden Stag Festival, but she failed to win over the audience.\n\nSeeking a recording contract, Aguilera recorded numerous demo tapes directed to record labels, including Walt Disney Records, for which she sent a cover of \"Run to You\" by Whitney Houston. She eventually was chosen to record \"Reflection\", the theme song from the animated film Mulan (1998), which reached number 15 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. Following the attention she received with \"Reflection\", Aguilera caught the ear of Ron Fair, the A&R executive from RCA Records, who consequently signed Aguilera to the label.[8] In late 1998, she began to record her debut studio album into which producers reportedly invested over $1 million worth of writers, producers and vocal lessons.[8]\n\n1999–2001: Breakthrough with debut album\n\nIn May 1999, Aguilera released \"Genie in a Bottle\", the lead single off her long-awaited debut album, which topped the Billboard Hot 100 for five consecutive weeks and became the second best-selling single of 1999.[34] The song became an international success, increasing Aguilera's popularity worldwide, topping the charts in over 20 countries.[35] The single also attracted the attention of conservatives including celebrities such as Debbie Gibson that spoke out against its lyrical content, and was eventually considered \"too provocative\" to be sung by a teen idol.[37] Due to the criticism, Radio Disney replaced the song with a censored version.[38] The song was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.[39]\n\nAguilera's self-titled debut album, Christina Aguilera, was released on August 24, 1999, to critical praise, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200.[40] It catapulted Aguilera into fame globally and sold over ten million copies in its first year.[41] It was later certified eight times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA),[42] and it has sold over 17 million copies worldwide.[43][44] Originally, Aguilera's desire was to create material directly inspired by R&B and soul, but the label opted for a more teen pop production due the genre's high financial return in the late 1990s.[45] At the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards, Aguilera won the Best New Artist category for which Time credited the award for \"[helping] certify her credentials as a real singer\".[46]\n\nAfter the album's release, \"What a Girl Wants\", topped the Hot 100 and is recognised as the first new number one entry on the chart for the 2000's decade. The song was also nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards. This was followed with \"I Turn to You\" which reached number three there,[40] and \"Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)\" which became Aguilera's third number one song and achieved worldwide success.[49] She also released a cover of \"The Christmas Song\" in November 1999 which peaked at number 18 and became the second highest charting position of the song after the original in 1944.[50]\n\nIn May 2000, Aguilera embarked on her debut concert tour, Christina Aguilera in Concert, which toured North America, Latin America, Europe, and Japan until February 2001.[51] Her success continued to rise with the release of her second studio album, Mi Reflejo, in September 2000 which topped both the Billboard Top Latin Albums and Latin Pop Albums for nineteen consecutive weeks.[53] The album featured Spanish-language versions of several songs from her debut album along with new songs, and had Latin pop themes.[54] Three singles were release for the album including the Spanish version of \"Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)\" titled \"Ven Conmigo (Solamente Tú)\", \"Pero Me Acuerdo de Ti\" and \"Falsas Esperanzas\".[55] The latter two were performed at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards.[56] The album went on to be the best-selling Latin pop album of 2000 and was later certified six times Latin platinum by the RIAA.[28][57] Mi Reflejo also reached the platinum stats in Argentina, Mexico, and Spain. At the 2nd Annual Latin Grammy Awards, the album won Best Female Pop Vocal Album.[59]\n\nIn October 2000, Aguilera also released her third studio album, My Kind of Christmas, her first Christmas album, which reached number one on the US Top Holiday Albums chart.[60][61] The album received generally polarized reviews at the time but has since gone on to retrospectively receive praise.[62] Aguilera starred in a holiday special, My Reflection, which aired on December 3, 2000, on ABC. Aguilera's commercial success saw her being named the 2000 Top Female Pop Act by Billboard.[64] The same year, she also filed a fiduciary duty against manager Steve Kurtz for \"improper, undue, and inappropriate influence over her professional activities\".[65] She eventually hired Irving Azoff to manage her career, aiming for control of her career and image.[65]\n\nOn January 16, 2001, Aguilera featured on Ricky Martin's \"Nobody Wants to Be Lonely\", which topped charts internationally and peaked at number 13 on the Hot 100, becoming her fifth top-20 hit in the US.[66][67] The song was ranked at number 65 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Love Songs\",[68] and was nominated for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards.[69] In April of that year, Aguilera featured alongside Lil' Kim, Mýa, and Pink on \"Lady Marmalade\" from the soundtrack for the film, Moulin Rouge! (2001).[70] The song received positive reviews and topped the Hot 100 for five consecutive weeks, becoming Aguilera's fourth number one.[71][72] The song also won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals and the MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year.[73]\n\nIn August 2001, Warlock Records released Just Be Free, a demo album recorded by Aguilera between 1994 and 1995 while she was looking for a recording deal following the end of The All-New Mickey Mouse Club (MMC). She filed a suit against the label and the album's producers aiming to stop the release of the album; however, both parties came to a confidential settlement to release the album, in which Aguilera lent out her name, likeness, and image for an unspecified amount of damages.[75]\n\n2002–2004: New image with Stripped\n\nWith a new management, Aguilera started moving away from her teen pop niche and began working on a new project.[76] She cultivated a new image by adopting the alter ego Xtina, dyeing her hair black, and sporting several tattoos and body piercings.[77] Aguilera's new persona was widely criticized by media outlets.[78][79][80] In September 2002, she released the controversial song, \"Dirrty\", which garnered mixed reviews and peaked as number 48 on Billboard Hot 100.[45] The song's accompanying music video generated controversy for depicting overtly sexual fetishes,[81] and attracted the attention of conservative organizations and moralists who sought to have the video banned on MTV.[82] The video also sparked protests in Thailand and was eventually banned on the country's local television.[83][84] \"Dirrty\" topped the charts in the UK and Ireland,[85] and has gone on to become a cult classic.[86]\n\nAguilera's fourth studio album, Stripped, followed with a release on October 22, 2002.[87] She also executive produced and co-wrote the majority of the songs.[87][88] Upon release, the album received generally mixed reviews but found commercial success and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, and eventually was certified five times platinum by the RIAA.[89][42] In the UK, Stripped sold over two million copies and became the second highest-selling album by an American female artists in the 2000s.[90][91] Since then, it was reported the album sold 12 million copies globally.[92][93]\n\nThe album's second single, \"Beautiful\", was released to widespread acclaim for its empowering lyrics about embracing inner beauty, also becoming a LGBT anthem.[94] The song reached number two on the Hot 100 and topped the chart in various international countries, including the UK, Canada, Ireland and New Zealand.[66] It also reached number one on the US Adult Contemporary chart and the US Dance Club Songs chart.[95][96] At the 46th Annual Grammy Awards, the single won Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.[97] This was followed with the singles — \"Fighter\", \"Can't Hold Us Down\" and \"The Voice Within\".[66]\n\nIn June 2003, Aguilera co-headlined The Justified & Stripped Tour alongside Justin Timberlake.[98] The joint tour visited North America solely, attracting an audience of 546,483 and grossed over $31.8 million.[99] It ranked sixteenth on Billboard's list of Top 25 Tours of 2003.[100] Later that year, she also embarked on The Stripped Tour in Europe, Asia, and Australia.[101] Her performances at the Wembley Arena were taped, broadcast on WB Network and eventually sold as a video album under the name Stripped Live in the U.K.[101] In early 2004, it was reported that she would return to North America to perform a second leg of her tour but was eventually canceled due to a vocal cord injury.[102]\n\nIn August 2003, at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, Aguilera opened the show singing \"Like a Virgin\" and \"Hollywood\" alongside Britney Spears.[103] Halfway through the performance, she was joined by Madonna whom they both kissed, consequently making the performance highly publicized.[104] Various media outlets retrospectively considered it one of the \"most iconic\" VMAs performances of all time.[105] In 2008, MTV listed the performance as the number-one opening moment in the history of MTV Video Music Awards,[106] while Blender magazine cited it as one of the twenty-five sexiest music moments on television history.[107] In November of that year, Aguilera hosted the 2003 MTV Europe Music Awards.[108] She received widespread media attention for dressing up as a nun and being undressed to reveal her underclothes while performing the slutdrop dance style.[109] She was later was named Top Female Pop Act of 2003 by Billboard.[110]\n\nIn August 2004, Aguilera recorded a cover of \"Car Wash\" alongside rapper Missy Elliott for the soundtrack of the DreamWorks Animation film Shark Tale.[111] She also voiced a Rastafarian jellyfish in the film.[112] That September, Aguilera was featured on \"Tilt Ya Head Back\" with rapper Nelly.[113] The songs respectively reached number 63 and 58 on the Billboard Hot 100.[66]\n\n2005–2008: Back to Basics\n\nIn early 2005, Aguilera embraced a new image inspired by Old Hollywood figures, debuting burlesque-style curly blonde hair and makeup. Her new persona was eventually adopted to promote her subsequent music project.[114][115] In March 2006, Aguilera released a duet with Andrea Bocelli, \"Somos Novios (It's Impossible)\", and performed the song together at the Sanremo Music Festival.[116] She also featured on \"A Song for You\" by Herbie Hancock which received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals.[117]\n\nIn June 2006, Aguilera released \"Ain't No Other Man\" as her then-forthcoming fifth studio album's lead single, which received critical acclaim and was praised by music critics.[66] Critics compared her vocals on the songs to older singers such as Etta James and Aretha Franklin.[118] The song achieved commercial success, peaked at number six on Billboard Hot 100 and has sold 1.7 million digital copies in the U.S.[119] The single eventually earned her the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.[120]\n\nAguilera's fifth studio album, Back to Basics, was released as a double album in August 2006.[121] The album was inspired by 1920s–1950s music and was described as a \"throwback with elements of old-school [music] combined with a modern-day twist\".[122] The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, making it Aguilera's first album to top the chart since 1999.[123] It also debuted atop the charts in numerous countries, including Australia, Canada, Germany, Switzerland, and the UK.[124] The album received positive reviews and was nominated a Best Pop Vocal Album at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards.[125][126][127][128] The album was later certified double platinum by the RIAA,[42] and sold over 5 million units worldwide.[129] \"Hurt\" and \"Candyman\" were released as singles following the album's release and reached the topten on various international charts, and peaked top-thirty on Hot 100.[131][66]\n\nIn November 2006, Aguilera performed \"Steppin' Out with My Baby\" at NBC's Tony Bennett: An American Classic special as a duet alongside Tony Bennett.[132] The duo performed the song on Saturday Night Live and at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards.[132] Their live performance was nominated a Grammy Award at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards.[133] Their version was officially recorded in 2012 for Bennett's Viva Duets.[134] That same month, Aguilera also featured on rapper Diddy's song \"Tell Me\" which topped the UK R&B Singles chart and number eight in the UK.[135][136]\n\nAt the end of November 2006 until October 2008, Aguilera embarked on the Back to Basics Tour which visited North America, Europe, Asia, and Oceania.[137] The tour received positive reviews and was divided into acts inspired by juke joints and the circus.[138] Rolling Stone highlighted its \"numerous sets and costumes changes\" emphasizing Aguilera's \"evolution from bubblegum starlet to dirrty vixen to her current incarnation as retro-styled soul siren\".[139] With earnings around 48.1 million, the tour was the highest-grossing concert tour by a female in 2007.[140] Additionally, the performances at the Adelaide Entertainment Centre were taped, broadcast on VH1 and sold as a video album under the title Back to Basics: Live and Down

Nation.[286][287]\n\n2021–present: Aguilera and Voltaire residency\n\nIn July 2021, Aguilera performed two sold-out shows at the Hollywood Bowl with Gustavo Dudamel and the Los Angeles

residency, Christina Aguilera at Voltaire, at The Venetian Las Vegas.[329][330][331] In May 2024, it was reported that Aguilera had parted ways with RCA and signed with 5020 Records, a label distributed by Sony Music Latin.[332]\n\nArtistry\n\nInfluences\n\nAguilera has named Etta James as a \"role model\", and said \"At Last\" made a major impression on her. She later stated, \"I'll still be as raunchy as I wanna be, and I'll have [Etta]'s memory to back me up. She's what I want to be someday\".[335] As a young girl, The Sound of Music (1959) and its lead actress, Julie Andrews, became her early references to sing and perform, in addition to broadening her interest on Broadway.[336] Aguilera's other major influences include Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Billie Holiday, and Ella Fitzgerald.[337] She has also cited rock bands as an influence, specifically the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Nirvana, and Radiohead.[340]\n\nAguilera was also influenced by Latin music. She later recalled singing her first songs in Spanish during childhood, saying: \"I grew up hearing [Spanish] being spoken in my household [and] hearing a lot of Julio Iglesias on the record player\". Some of her other inspirations in Latin music include Chavela Vargas, Vicente Fernández, and younger artists such Rosalía.[342][343] As a performer, Aguilera credits Madonna and Janet Jackson as major inspirations for being \"positive female artists [who] aren't afraid to take chances, be daring, experimental and sexy\".[344] Cher also encouraged her to be a performer and \"a woman who has the guts to do [everything]\".[345]\n\nAguilera's childhood visits to records stores moulded her taste and led to an appreciation for blues and soul music, which she called \"music that really had heart\".[346] Her music has also paid homage to many artists from this genre, including Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye, Nina Simone, and Otis Redding. Her album Back to Basics (2006) features inspirations of musicians from the early 20th century. As she later commented: \"I was just so drawn to that [kind of music] ... [It] has so much pain, so much beauty of raw emotion and passion\".[13] Her other influences in the genre was added for Liberation (2018), including Michael Jackson in \"Maria\" and Janis Joplin in \"Sick of Sittin'\".[347][253]\n\nOutside of the music industry, Aguilera was inspired by actresses from the Old Hollywood.[348] She later stated, \"I'm fascinated with the golden age of film. I wanted to capture the authenticity of the glam era\", after which she cited examples such as Marlene Dietrich, Marilyn Monroe, Greta Garbo, Veronica Lake, and the pin-up models.[349] Her \"Tilt Ya Head Back\" music video also recreated Monroe's signature look, while the video for \"Your Body\" includes a reference to Lucille Ball.[350][351] The video for \"Ain't No Other Man\" presented Aguilera under the alter ego Baby Jane, which was inspired by Bette Davis's character in psychological horror film What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962).[352] Her other inspirations mostly came from art works, including those by Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Banksy.[353][354]\n\nVoice\n\nCritics have described Aguilera as a soprano,[14][357] possessing a four-octave vocal range.[358] She is also able to perform the whistle register.[359] Maura Johnston, a journalist with Slate, called Aguilera's voice \"an instrument that despite its ability to leap octaves has a low-end grounding similar to that possessed by opera singers\".[360] The Boston Globe columnist Joan Anderman highlighted her vocal versatility: \"[She] is a real singer ... blessed with the sort of breathtaking elasticity, golden tones, and sheer power that separate the divas from the dabblers\".[361] In addition to sustain high notes, Aguilera is recognized for making use of the melismatic technique.[355] Jon Pareles from The New York Times emphasized that \"she can aim a note as directly as a missile or turn its trajectory into an aerobatic spiral of leaping, quivering, and scalloping melismas\".[253] Ron Fair—A&R executive from RCA Records—was impressed by her \"perfect intonation\", and concluded: \"She's got the pipes to be the next Barbra Streisand or Céline Dion\".[337]\n\nAguilera's singing technique also yielded comparisons to other singers. Journalist David Browne suggested that, alongside Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston, she \"forms the team of the main proponents\" of the melismatic technique.[356] Richard Harrington from The Washington Post also noticed similarities with both artists: \"She has a genuinely powerful voice that's evoked comparisons [to them], though it for the most part avoids those singers' ornamental mannerisms\".[362] The New Yorker columnist Sasha Frere-Jones also credited the technique by making her become \"a serious singer without needing to reincarnate the Sarah Vaughan\".[363] Songwriter Steve Kipner praises Aguilera's vocal dexterity, including her ability to \"internalize[d] all the riffs from Chaka Khan\".[337] Los Angeles Times music critic Ann Powers wrote that she possesses a \"voice purely powerful as that of Etta James [...] and she's moving toward the expressiveness of Gladys Knight, if not Aretha Franklin\". Powers also associated her vocal ability with Donna Summer when she performs records influenced by rhythm and blues.[364]\n\nHowever, Aguilera's has also been criticized for the frequent use of melisma, as well for her style of singing live during concerts.[365][126] HuffPost columnist John Eskow called her \"the main proponent of oversouling\". Eskow praised Aguilera's voice as a \"great instrument\", though complained she did not \"seem to know when to stop\" with the use of \"gratuitous and confected melisma\".[366] Lucy Davies, music critic from BBC Music, raved about her \"stunning voice\", but offered that \"she could be more varied, simply by cutting out some of the 'ye-e-eeeh, woah' in her songs\".[367] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Chris Willman credits Aguilera's singing style as an influence of Mariah Carey, noting \"her slightly nasal tone that really only becomes obvious when she's overselling a song\".[368] Alexa Tietjen from VH1 acknowledged that Aguilera \"does tend to take it to the extreme at times [...] but her vocal prowess is what's gotten her so far. Love them or hate them, the riffs are a part of who she is as performer\".[369]\n\nMusical style\n\nAguilera's discography is generally categorized as pop, contemporary R&B, soul, and hip-hop.[371][372] According to critics, she has also experimented with other musical genres in her works. In a 2008 interview, she explained that she is \"always inspired by new things\" in music and enjoys \"experimenting with [her] voice\".[155] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian considered the \"boldness in [continually] reinventing\" her music as \"one of her most impressive facets\" as an artist.[373] Initially established as a bubblegum pop singer, she mixed teen pop and dance-pop on her first records, Christina Aguilera (1999) and Mi Reflejo (2000), with the latter also taking inspiration from numerous genres in Latin music.[362][374]\n\nMoving away from the teen niche, Aguilera's post-2000 material mainly incorporated R&B and hip-hop.[371][76] Listed as an executive producer on Stripped (2002), she mixed both genres with Latin pop, rock, neo-soul, gospel, among others, while Back to Basics (2006) was described as a \"throwback with elements of old-school genres combined with a modern-day twist [and] hard-hitting beats\".[375][121] She continued merging R&B with other musical styles on Burlesque (2010), as well on Liberation (2018), which also features hip-hop, soul and blues elements.[376][377]\n\nThe show tune \"Lady Marmalade\" is noted as Aguilera's first musical transformation, which RCA Records initially felt was \"too urban\".[113][378] Despite the renewal in her repertoire, Aguilera continued producing power ballads—which became a signature in her discography—in between her uptempo material.[379] Kelefa Sanneh, music critic from The New York Times, observed the continuous modification in her music, in addition to highlighting her \"decision to snub some of the big-name producers on whom pop stars often rely\".[380] Her sonically drastic ventures include the subversive \"galactic pop\" on Bionic (2010),[162] electropop club on Lotus (2012),[381] and Mexican ranchera numbers on Aguilera (2022).[382]\n\nLyrical themes\n\nAguilera's music has been the subject of analysis. Critics have acknowledged domestic violence experienced during childhood as one of the main topics in her music.[384][385] Mary Anne Donovan, author of Christina Aguilera: A Biography (2010), noted that she \"channeled her fear and sadness away from the abuse in her family to instead create the music that became her art and her livelihood\". It also influenced Aguilera's transition to adulthood and impacted many of her songs, whose lyrics reference female empowerment. In a 2006 interview, she commented: \"I feel a responsibility to share some of these things that aren't kind of the brighter sides of my life. People [who] can relate might not feel as alone in the circumstance\".[389]\n\nAguilera has also often defended the sex-positive movement and denounced social double standards in her music.[93] Reviewing Stripped (2002), Sophie Wilkinson from Vice opined that its music \"explores nuanced articulations of sexual desires and fears while highlighting the social double standards\", in addition to giving \"any woman the confidence to take charge of her sexuality and ownership of her body\".[390] Jennifer K. Armstrong, author of Sexy Feminism: A Girl's Guide to Love, Success, and Style (2013), opined that her music has \"reject[ed] the double standards set forth by sexism and patriarchy\".\n\nChin Wai Wong from Hollins University also observed topics such as romance, introspection of vulnerability, gratitude for support, and sexual liberation in Aguilera's music, representing \"multi-dimensional aspects of life [and] different social responsibilities a woman experiences\".[383] While critics noted the feminist message in her works, Aguilera was acknowledged for her \"refusal to sanitize her own sexuality to meet either the norms of mainstream gender politics or mainline Feminism's resistance\".[392] The Guardian journalist Hermione Hoby opined that she \"incites a sisterly spirit of collaboration [and] is not shy of the odd feministic declaration herself\".[393] Other themes addressed in her lyrics include self-respect, body image, and LGBT rights, in addition to \"fighting for creative freedom and gender equality\".[394][395]\n\nCultural status\n\nPublic image\n\nPublications have called Aguilera a pop icon, a triple threat entertainer[396][397] Her fan base is named the \"Fighters\" drawing inspiration from her 2003 single \"Fighter\".[398] She is one of the most popular musicians on Twitter[399] with approximately 17 million followers,[400] and was one of the most searched artists in the world in 2002, 2004, and 2010 through Google.[401] She was also one of the most popular searches in 2003 by Yahoo! Search.[402]\n\nAguilera has often been labeled a diva for her stardom and persona.[403] Bustle writer James Tison noted comparisons to Mariah Carey adding that \"[Aguilera] has mastered being a diva in the best way possible\".[403] Tison also noted Aguilera's sexual personality and \"willingness to embrace her own sexuality\" as her most important quality.[403] In the early 2000's, Aguilera was involved in a highly publicized feud with American rapper Eminem.[404][405] After the release of \"Can't Hold Us Down\" by Aguilera in 2002, critics noted its lyrical references to Eminem who had negatively referenced her various times in his raps.[406] In 2018, Aguilera noted on Watch What Happens Live! with Andy Cohen that its \"really in the past and [...] it was thirsty then and it's thirsty now\".[406]\n\nAguilera is also recognized as a gay icon;[407][398][408] in 2019, she was awarded by the Human Rights Campaign for using her \"platform to share a message of hope and inspiration to those who have been marginalized [...] bringing greater visibility to the LGBTQ community\".[409] Her 2002 song \"Beautiful\" has been called an anthem for the LGBT community, with UK LGBT rights charity Stonewall naming it the most empowering song of the decade for lesbian, gay and bisexual people and for having \"inspired millions of young people around the world\".[410] In 2023, Aguilera was honored for her LGBTQ allyship and for advocating for the queer community at the Stonewall National Monument.[411][412]\n\nAguilera's style and fashion has attracted significant media attention throughout her career,[413][414] and she has been named a fashion icon.[415][416] Jon Caramanica, journalist from The New York Times, concluded that \"Aguilera will be remembered for her glamour and her scandalous take on femme-pop\",[417] while Janelle Okwodu from Vogue noted that she \"has never been afraid to take a fashion risk [and] has filled her videos with jaw-dropping styles and risqué runway looks\".[418] Following her appearance at New York Fashion Week in 2018, Dazed named her one of the most stylish people of the year.[419] Aguilera's influence on fashion has been noted by several publications.[420][421][422][423] Samantha Sutton of InStyle noted Aguilera's influence on the rising fashion trends of 2021.[424] Writing for Vogue in 2022, Christian Allaire said that Aguilera was \"ahead of her time\" when it came to her provocative image.[425]\n\nSince the beginning of her career, Aguilera has attracted criticism for her revealing clothes,[426] and has been called a sex symbol.[363][6] In an interview with MTV News, Debbie Gibson accused her of \"influencing girls out there wearing less and less\", considering that \"she lives and breathes the sexual image\".[427] In response to negative comments, Aguilera stated: \"Just because I have a certain image, everyone wants me to be this role model. But nobody is perfect, and nobody can live up to that\".[428] VH1, included in the list of the sexiest entertainment artists in 2002 and 2013;[429][430] in publications from FHM and Complex, she received similar honors in 2004 and 2012, respectively.[431][432] In 2003, she was chosen as the sexiest woman of the year by Maxim, stamping the cover of the best-selling issue of the magazine's history,[433] and she was named one of the most beautiful people in the world in 2003 and 2007 by People.[434][435]\n\nReinventions and personas\n\nAguilera has been called a \"Queen of Reinvention\" as she is noted for having reinvented her public image numerous times throughout her career.[114][436][437] Stereogum writer Tom Breihan noted that she originally \"thought of herself primarily as a [...] young Mariah Carey-type\",[438] but was instead marketed as a bubblegum pop teen idol due to the genre's popularity in the late 1990s,[439][440][14] following the success of Britney Spears's debut album ...Baby One More Time.[8][441] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly felt that Aguilera was \"a good girl pretending to be bad\" when compared to Spears' image.[442] In contrast, Christopher J. Farley of Time considered her a more impressive artist.[46] In the early stages of her career, Aguilera was often considered a rival to Spears.[443]\n\nAguilera departed from the teen idol image with the release of Stripped in 2002, by dyeing her hair black, getting body piercings, and posing nude for several publications.[77] This was attributed to her provocative and extravagant alter ego named Xtina.[444] Serving as the host of the 2003 MTV Europe Music Awards, Aguilera opened the show dressed as a nun, accompanied by a choir singing the lead single from Stripped, \"Dirrty\", before showing off a more revealing outfit.[109] While analyzing her new visual, Vice and Rolling Stone magazines wrote that her new clothes echoed as if she were participating in the Girls Gone Wild franchise.[445][446] In a review of her persona, author Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic opined that Aguilera reached \"maturity with transparent sexuality and pounding sounds of nightclubs\".[447] Writing for The Daily Telegraph, Adam White was more positive about her image and recognized that her \"embracing of an overtly sexual image in the wake of adolescent stardom was a tried and tested route to adult success\".[448]\n\nFor the release of Back to Basics in 2006, Aguilera adopted a new persona named Baby Jane, named after Bette Davis's character in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962).[449] The image drew inspiration from actresses of the Golden Age of Hollywood, such as Marilyn Monroe, to go with the album's 1920s–1950s musical direction.[450] In 2008, she adopted a futuristic image, which drew comparisons to the image of then-newcomer, Lady Gaga.[451][452] In 2012, she drew criticism over her weight gain from several publications,[453] and received favorable media attention the following year after a significant weight loss.[454][455] In March 2018, Aguilera appeared on the cover of the spring 2018 issue of Paper, titled \"Transformation\".[456][457] Photographed by Zoey Grossman, the images featured Aguilera with minimal makeup and no photographic manipulation, debuting her freckles.[458] Her appearance in the pictures received significant media attention and widespread praise.[459][460][461][462] This led to other celebrities who had posed similarly receiving attention.[463] For promotion of her ninth studio album, Aguilera (2022), she began showing off a red-haired look.[464]\n\nLegacy\n\nVarious music journalists and authors have noted Aguilera's legacy in the entertainment industry[465][375][448] and deemed her as one of the greatest artists in pop music.[466][467] In 2004, she was listed as one of the most influential people in the music market according to The Independent,[468] and was ranked as the eight greatest woman in the phonographic industry by VH1.[469] Early in her career, Aguilera was labeled as a teen idol,[439][470] and has been named as one of the artists who revived teen pop in the late 1990s.[471][472] Time magazine stated that she was a \"pioneer [in] a different type of teen stardom\", crediting her vocal ability as responsible for the phenomenon.[46] Since then, she has been named as one of the greatest singers in pop music;[473][474] by MTV, she was ranked as one of the best voices in music since the 1980s,[475] while Rolling Stone and Consequence of Sound included her in their lists of greatest singers of all time.[476][477] In 2013, Latina honored her as the best vocalist of Latin origin in history.[478] With the recognition of her vocal ability and influence in the music industry, she has been referred in media with the titles of \"Princess of Pop\"[479][480] and \"Voice of a Generation\".[481][482][483]\n\nUpon launching her music career in the late 1990s, Aguilera was named as one of the artists who shaped the \"Latin explosion\",[484][485] having contributed to the Latin pop boom in American music in early of the century.[486] Considered one of the greatest artists of the 2000s,[122][487] she has been classified between the main references of the Millennials;[488] writing for Vice magazine, Wanna Thompson analyzed her impact in the turn of the century, stating that alongside Britney Spears, \"Aguilera dominated mainstream pop-related discussions. [Her] perfectly packaged music and looks appealed to tweens and teens who wanted to be like the pretty, chart-topping pop stars plastered everywhere\".[489] The commercial success of her first projects as a bubblegum pop singer caused an effect that influenced record labels to invest in new artists who attracted the same youthful appeal, catapulting names like Jessica Simpson and Mandy Moore.[490][491]\n\nCritics also highlighted the impact of her work in popular culture; while Stripped (2002) was called \"the blueprint for divas making the transition from teen idol to adult pop star\",[492] Aguilera is credited for \"paving the way for a generation of pop singers\".[483][493] Jeff Benjamin from Billboard stated that the album explored a \"process of self-identification and declaration still influencing today's mainstream scene\", in addition to \"how of today's biggest pop stars have followed a similar path, exploring and incorporating these strategies into their careers\".[375] In 2007, her self-titled debut album was added to the definitive list from Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, being recognized as one of the \"history's most influential and popular albums\".[494] Since then, Aguilera and her work have influenced various recording artists including Adam Lambert,[495][496] Ariana Grande,[497] Ava Max,[498] Becky G,[499] Britney Spears,[500] Camila Cabello,[501] Charli XCX,[502] Demi Lovato,[503] Doja Cat,[504] Dua Lipa,[505] Grimes,[506] Halsey,[507] Hayley Williams,[508] Iggy Azalea,[509] Karol G,[510] Kelly Clarkson,[476] K. Michelle,[511] Lady Gaga,[512] Lauren Jauregui,[513][514] Meghan Trainor,[515] Nicki Nicole,[516] Olivia Rodrigo,[517] Olly Alexander,[518][519] Rina Sawayama,[520] Rosalía,[521] Sabrina Carpenter,[522] Sam Smith,[523] Selena Gomez,[524] Stacie Orrico,[525] Tate McRae,[526] Tinashe,[527] and Troye Sivan,[528] and athletes such as figure skater Johnny Weir,[529] ice dancers Zachary Donohue and Madison Hubbell,[530] and swimmer Dana Vollmer.[531] In 2010, Whitney Houston, Aguilera's idol herself, cited the singer as an inspiration, admitting in 2010 that: \"Christina Aguilera, Jennifer Hudson and Beyoncé — they stirred my curiosity about coming back and making a record.\"[532]\n\nAguilera has also been praised for emphasizing the importance of feminism in pop music;[394][533] several journalists agree that her use of sexual imagery has helped catalyze public discourse on the topic.[445][534] Lamar Dawson, a columnist from HuffPost, praised her feminist efforts in the music industry and recognized that \"while Christina isn't the first pop star to place feminist rhetoric into pop culture, she led the charge at the beginning of the 21st century of influencing the next generation of impressionable teens who were too young for Janet [Jackson] and Madonna's curriculum\".[535] Gerrick D. Kennedy from Los Angeles Times shared the same point of view and stated that \"for a generation who hit puberty during the great 2000 pop explosion, Aguilera was an essential voice with music that tackled self-empowerment, feminism, sex and domestic violence — subject matter her contemporaries were shying away from\".[372] Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett, co-founder of The Vagenda, opined that the provocative dance routines in Aguilera's music videos were \"empowering\",[534] as she has been referred to as the forerunner of the slutdrop dance style.[536][537]\n\nAguilera's videography impact was also analysed by music critics. While \"Dirrty\" (2002) has been described as \"one of the most controversial videos in pop music history\",[538][448] and one of the greatest music videos of all time,[539] Issy Beech from i-D recognized that the audiovisual work \"paved a path for videos like \"Anaconda\" and \"Wrecking Ball\" [...] paved the way for open sexuality from women in pop\".[540] In the video for \"Beautiful\" (2002), the highlight scene of a gay kiss has been considered one of the most important moments for LGBT culture,[541][542] in addition to start Aguilera's image as a gay icon.[543] Both works was elected as one of the greatest music videos of the 21st century by editors from Billboard,[544] while she was named one of the greatest women of the video era according to VH1.[545] In 2012, her videographic collection and some looks used throughout her career were part of an exhibition by the National Museum of Women in the Arts aimed at illustrating \"the essential roles women have played in moving rock and roll and American culture forward\".[546][547]\n\nAchievements\n\nAguilera has accumulated numerous awards and honorary accolades throughout her career.
