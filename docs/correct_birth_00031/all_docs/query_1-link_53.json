        "text": "Christina María Aguilera (born December 18, 1980) is an American musician, who has contributed songs considerably to the pop genre. Aguilera first appeared on national television in 1990 as a contestant on the Star Search program, and went on to star in Disney Channel's television series The New Mickey Mouse Club from 1993–1994. Aguilera signed to RCA Records after recording \"Reflection\" for the film Mulan. She came to prominence following her debut album Christina Aguilera (1999), which was a commercial success spawning three number one singles on the Billboard Hot 100. A Latin pop album, Mi Reflejo (2001), and several collaborations followed which garnered Aguilera worldwide success, though she was displeased with her lack of input in her music and image.\n\nAfter parting from her management, Aguilera took creative control over her second studio album, Stripped (2002), which - although it received mixed reviews - was popular with the public, and thus produced substantial sales. The second single, \"Beautiful\", was a commercial success and sustained the album's sales amidst controversy over Aguilera's provocative image. Aguilera's third studio album, Back to Basics (2006), included elements of soul, jazz, and blues music, and was released to positive critical reception. Aguilera's fourth studio album Bionic will be released in early 2010."
