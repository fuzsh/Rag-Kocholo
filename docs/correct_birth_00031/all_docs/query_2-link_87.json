        "text": "Welcome to Staten Island's Past\n\nBest known for its vast parks and beach areas, Staten Island is a place where many generations of people\n\nhave come to make a good life for their families. This borough has always been known for its family values and\n\nslower pace of living. Yet, we are just a boat ride away from the most exciting place in the world... \"Manhattan\" For residents of other boroughs, the Island's beaches and parks are a retreat from the crowded city streets. This is a borough, rich in history and I hope to share some of that history with fellow native Islanders and welcome all who\n\nhave made Staten Island their home. Enjoy your tour, in text and photo and please visit often, as I try to update on a\n\nregular basis. Any photos or memories you can share will just make this website better for all. Please write to us\n\nand let us know what you think of our website\n\nCare to take a step back in time to the Staten Island of years gone by? To a time long before developers threatened our rural, sea-kissed landscape with rows of cookie-cutter townhouses, big-name retailers and over-sized \"mini\" malls?\n\nWould you like to sit back, re-live cherished memories and recharge amid the down-home charm of close-knit neighbor\n\nhoods, mom-and-pop shops and bustling beach areas? Would you like to see what's been lost over time and what\n\nthings looked like here when grandma and grandpa were kids?\n\nPerusing the \"Old Staten Island\" Web site, posted in June,2004 is like having a beautifully-illustrated history book of the borough right at your fingertips. Intrigued visitors can, of course, begin their time-travel journey anywhere they'd like, but in order to put the site in the appropriate perspective, it might be best to start with the historical events page. Far from being a tedious lesson in social studies, this page features an engaging timeline of key events in the history of Richmond County dating from the early 1600s through to the present day. For trivia of a different kind, there's the \"Staten Island in Film\" page which references dozens of films reported to contain scenes on Staten Island or from the Staten Island Ferry. Another fun, lighthearted page is \"Famous Islanders,\" which lists the names, along with brief biographies, of those who have, at one time or another, called Staten Island home. (We bet you'll come across a few surprises here!) Once your mind is chock full of details like these, site visitors can take a stroll through the virtual galleries of sentimental postcards and photographs and charming old store and movie ads. Where did Sublett come upon such information in the first place? The public library, of course. In fact, he spent weeks at the St. George Library researching old records and scanning early editions of the Advance to make sure the historical details given were not only thorough, but accurate as well. He also consulted several books written about the borough over the years. \"It's really been a learning experience for me,\" Sublett shared. \"Staten Island has such an amazing history.\" As for the featured photographs, he is grateful to have received most of them as \"donations.\"\n\n~ written by Tamara Valles September 08, 2004 in The SI Advance\n\n\"God might have made a more beautiful spot than Staten Island,\n\nbut He never did\"\n\n~ George William Curtis (from Staten Island)\n\nOur Memories Page has now reached \"1000\" entries,\n\nso if you would like to reminisce for a few hours or so\n\nput on a pot of coffee, get your reading glasses and relive all your childhood\n\nmemories of Good Old Staten Island\n\nGreat for the Holidays for all your family with Staten Island ties, be it past or present these two books and Photo CD will bring back great memories of Old Staten Island\n\nEditorial Reviews\n\nProduct Description\n\nWere there really four airports here? Was the Staten Island Airport shut down each night to ensure no peril to the patrons of the drive-in theater? Did rides and trolleys really exist on the South Beach - Midland Beach Boardwalk? Were there restaurants with a huge hot dog on its roof or one built like a chuck wagon, a jolly trolley or a windmill. Were farms prevalent on the Island and did wildlife roam our backyards? Can it be that there were two movie theaters on New Dorp Lane? Were the beaches so clean that you actually paid to use them? Was fresh milk and bread actually delivered to our front door? Did Santa really ride the Christmas Train and stop at Jersey Street and Richmond Terrace and give out presents to the kids? Was there really a home for orphaned kids (Mount Loretto) (where once a month my mother promised to check me into)? In the 1930's, Which of Staten Island's best known restaurateurs, bought a house across the street from his famous restaurant and built a 200-foot tunnel between the house and the restaurant so that he could safely carry the day's receipts from the restaurant to his home. Did such rock legends, like the Allman Brothers, Vanilla Fudge, Alice Cooper, Black Sabbath and the Kinks really play the Island? Did John F Kennedy, sip coffee at the St. George ferry terminal? Can you believe that a famous Island milk company resorted to rowboats to delivery milk to areas from Oakwood to Midland Beach during some of the worst storms to every hit that area? These were some of the many questions I had as my interest in Staten Islands past grew. In recent years I have come across so much information about our Island's rich and diverse past, that I wanted to share with all Native Islanders and people who have called the Island home. But I did not want this to be another history book on Staten Island, though; at times it may look that way. I will not go into details about the British occupation of Staten Island for seven years, or the draft riots during the civil war, or the burning down of the Quarantine Station. I will try my best to make this a lighthearted look at memories that we have of a place that was and is still close to our hearts. I will try my best to make you say, \"Wow, I remember that\". . . .\n\nFrom the Publisher\n\nBeing a native Staten Islander, I thought I knew all about this Island. In my later years I became very interested in the Islands history. I wondered about all the things I was told about Staten Island but never had the opportunity to personally see. This work is a collaboration of many people and many sources of information.\n\n$17.95 + $3.00 Shipping\n\nBook can be autographed\n\nEditorial Reviews\n\nProduct Description\n\nTo the shores of this Island have come many generations of people who were determined to make a good life for their families.

He hid out on Staten Island while the cops hunted him down ( from a story in The Saturday Evening Post  June 9th 1951 )\n\nUnder the name of Eddie Lynch, he worked as a porter in the Farm Colony Hospital (across the road from Seaview Hospital) for $90.00 a month. He spent a few years at the Farm Colony.\n\nAfter Willie crunched out of the Pennsylvania prison in February 1947, he'd come to Staten Island where he'd spent three whole years scrubbing floors in his hospital job, meanwhile living quietly with a landlady ( a nice Irish lady named Mary Corbett) on Kimball Avenue in Castleton Corners and going to church, on Sundays with her and helping her tend her flowers. During a two week vacation that he had, he waterproofed the cellar of Marys house. He seeded the lawn and painted the house. This small house on a quiet street became his sanctuary. As long as he was in this house he felt completely safe. He felt as if the bank robber \"Willie Sutton' was dead and the fairly decent \"Eddie Lynch\" had taken his place.\n\nThroughout much of this period, he was very patiently observing the daily routines at the Manufacturers Trust Co., 47-11 Queens Blvd., Sunnyside, Queens, getting to know exactly what the guards did when. Accordingly, things went like perfect clockwork when Willie and several pals hit the bank for $63,933 one morning in March 1950.

Bud had an idea to get to the shore. He found and purchased a surplus storage building that the Army had for sale. Bud and his friend, Teddy, refurbished the building making it the only hot dog stand on Graham Beach. All went well. The concession was named Dots Spot, as Dot would be the major operator of the cute stand on the beach. Dot kept a very large drawer filled with baking potatoes on hand, and when weather would allow, she would dole out the potatoes, to beach-goers who had a driftwood fire going. They would throw the potatoes into the glowing embers and then enjoy the wonderful aroma and taste of the charred pommes de terre. Their little girl, Joyce, did indeed regain her health and she along with her brother, Tommy, enjoyed several carefree, adventure filled summers at the shore. Then came a strong Noreaster in the fall of 1948, and the hot dog stand was no more. The storm swept the stand off its foundation, down the road about five(5) blocks and three or four blocks inland, where it was deposited right in the middle of the street until bull dozers came in to clear the streets and redeposit the tons of sand to the beach.\n\nThere has been much comment about how many Wetson's and where they were on the Island\n\nAs far as my research goes I have found four Wetsons locations\n\nThe two addresses in the above photo + two more\n\n#1 - 1525 Hylan Blvd. was on the corner of \"Burgher\" Avenue, Dongan Hills\n\n( Now a Mr Bargain II Auto Parts ) Robert Hall Clothes was across the street\n\n#2 - 1767 Forest Avenue near Morningstar Road, Graniteville\n\n( Now a Firestone Store )\n\n#3 - Forest Avenue between Broadway and North \"Burgher\" Avenue West Brighton\n\n( Now a Bagel/Deli Place)\n\n#4 - Richmond Avenue, New Springville\n\n( Near Pathmark and Costco )\n\n...... A story from the book\n\nMosquitoes Scare off Ulysses S. Grant\n\nAt the close of his presidency he visited Staten Island with the thought of accepting an offer from the American people. That offer was the famed Garner Mansion in West New Brighton. Except for the swarms of mosquitoes that inhabited Staten Island, the prominent American would have become an Island resident. The dwelling which Mr. and Mrs. Grant anticipated occupying was the building which had been erected by a prominent New York businessman, Charles Taber, and sold to Mr. W.T. Garner, Commodore of the New York Yacht Club. After the catastrophe during July 1876, when Mr. Garner and all on board his yacht had been drowned when the vessel capsized during a storm, the house was selected by a committee as the peoples gift to General Grant.\n\nThis plan was, however nipped in the bud by the hordes of mosquitoes which in 1876 were a scourge on Staten Island. On a gloriously bright day in June, General Grant was brought down to inspect the place. The day was ideal and he expressed himself as delighted with the magnificent property and beautiful surroundings, and all that was needed was the approval of Mrs. Grant. But the time selected for her visit proved to be just the reverse. The day was hot and muggy and the mosquitoes swarmed in the millions.\n\nIt was not possible to postpone the visit. So a pair of fast horses whirled the lady across the country, and she was actually in the house before the pests made an impression. Mrs. Grant was as pleased with the house as had been the General, and in due time suggested an inspection of the grounds. Then came all manner of excuses: she was too tired for further exercise on such a warm day: inspection of the grounds and neighboring estates would take an entire day and had best be left to another visit, etc., etc., etc. But she was one who believed in doing it now, and the resulting trip through the mosquito infested shrubbery quenched all desire on her part for a home on Staten Island.\n\nThe building later became a prominent part of St. Vincents Hospital\n\nNew Dorp, Staten Island\n\nSt. George, Staten Island"
