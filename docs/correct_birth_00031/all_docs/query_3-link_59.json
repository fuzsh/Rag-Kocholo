        "text": "Bio:\n\nChristina Maria Aguilera (born December 18, 1980 in Staten Island, New York) is an American recording artist and actress. Aguilera first appeared on TV in the 90s as a contestant on the Star Search program, and went on to star in The Mickey Mouse Club from 1993-1994. In 1999, she started her singing career with her debut album Christina Aguilera, which had three number one singles on the Billboard Hot 100 – “Genie in a Bottle”, “What a Girl Wants”, and “Come On Over Baby (All I Want is You).” She followed her success with her next two albums Mi Reflejo and My Kind of Christmas released in 2000. After becoming displeased with her last two albums, she took control of her image by releasing her fourth album Stripped in 2002, which garnered a successful single “Beautiful.”\n\nShe followed that with a soulful fifth album Back to Basics in 2006, gaining critical acclaim for her three singles “Ain’t No Other Man”, “Hurt”, and “Candyman.” Four years later, she released her next album Bionic in 2010, which incorporated a mix of R&B, electropop, and synthpop. The album had mixed reviews and ended up becoming her lowest selling album.\n\nShe made her feature film debut in the film Burlesque (2010), earning a Golden Globe nomination for Best Original Song. She is currently one of the judges/mentors in the NBC singing competition The Voice.\n\nAguilera’s albums sales are estimated at over 50 million units worldwide, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time.\n\nBest Known For:\n\nHer tween days as a member of the Mickey Mouse Club led to her pop stardom days, where she went from a cute, blonde singer to the dirty Xtina. She cleaned up her act after a few years, but when her marriage to Jordan Bratmen ended, the singer went a little wild and was even arrested for a DUI. Just as her celebrity began to fade a tiny bit, her time as judge on The Voice propelled her back into the A-List spotlight."
