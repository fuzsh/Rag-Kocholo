        "text": "“The Voice” came at just the right moment for Christina Aguilera.\n\nThe Staten Island-born singer was in need of a serious image makeover after a wrenching divorce, an arrest for public drunkenness, and an embarrassing flub of “The Star Spangled Banner” at this year’s Super Bowl.\n\nBecoming a take-charge judge on the overnight sensation “The Voice” “totally transformed her image,” says Brian Balthazar, editor of the gossip Web site PopGoesTheWeek.com.\n\n“She couldn’t have planned this recovery any better if she had tried,” says Balthazar. “A lot of people had the impression that she was a total mess.”\n\nNot any more.\n\nAguilera, 30, has shed the raunchy outfits and ratty hair extensions and is confronting her demons in public.\n\n“I think the most important thing for me to do is to talk about my hiccups and the ups and downs in my career,” she told The Post last month. “I am healing after a really hard time in my life. Now I get to share these experiences.”\n\nAnd she has plenty to share:\n\nDomestic Abuse — As a kid, Aguilera said, she was physically abused by her father, an Ecuadorian immigrant and US military man.\n\n“It began when she was young — 2 or 3 years old,” says Mary Anne Donovan, author of “Christina Aguilera: A Biography.”\n\n“The sound of music was her ultimate escape.\n\n“One day her father was taking a nap and she woke him up and he went berserk. He basically threw her across the room. Christina was bleeding from the mouth.”\n\nThe attack — which Fausto Aguilera denies — prompted her mother, Shelly, to move Christina and her sister to a suburb of Pittsburgh.\n\nSchoolyard Bullying — Landing on “The Mickey Mouse Club” made Aguilera a target at school for jealous classmates.\n\n“By sixth grade, she was having nightmares,” Shelly revealed in a recent interview. “Therapy was involved. It was crazy.”\n\nAfter the tires on her mother’s car were slashed, the family moved again.\n\nSexuality Questions —As recently as last year, the singer stoked speculation that she may be bisexual.\n\n“My husband knows that I get into girls,” she told Out magazine.\n\n“I think it’s fun to be open and play. My husband [music executive Jordan Bratman] and I check in with each other, but I definitely love women. I think they’re more attractive to the naked eye.”\n\nLove Lost — The end of Aguilera’s five-year marriage last fall threatened to throw her life and career into chaos.\n\n“I think she was finally facing herself in ways that were shocking, terrifying,” Donovan says. “Like ‘Oh my God, what am I doing with my life? The happily-ever-after isn’t happening!”\n\nDonovan says the relationship may have fallen apart after Bratman insisted their son, Max, be raised Jewish and began having input into Aguilera’s career.\n\n“I have the impression that he could be a very controlling individual,” she says.\n\nOther reports have suggested that Aguilera may have been unfaithful with current beau Matthew Rutler, 25.\n\nRutler, who worked on the movie crew of “Burlesque,” Aguilera’s unhappy acting debut, was behind the wheel March 1 when Aguilera was charged with public intoxication.\n\nHe was popped for DUI The charges against both were later dropped.\n\nChristina Aguilera, Quickly\n\n* Aguilera first topped the charts at age 18 with the hit “Genie in a Bottle” and won a Grammy her first time out.\n\n* When Christina’s mother married paramedic Jim Kearns in 1991, she instantly acquired two younger step-siblings: Stephanie and Casey. She already had a younger sister, Rachel.\n\n* Christina had 11 piercings removed in 2004. She said she got them originally to help cope with bad times — but didn’t need them anymore.\n\n* When Christina was 12, she performed The “Star Spangled Banner” at home games for all three Pittsburgh teams: the Steelers, Pirates and Penguins.\n\n* She named her son Max Liron, a combination of Hebrew and English which translates as “My greatest song.”"
