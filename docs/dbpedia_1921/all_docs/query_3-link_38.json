Couple Quiz.\n\n♪ Couples Quiz ♪\n\nHi, I'm Neil Patrick Harris.\n\nHi, I'm David Burtka.\n\nAnd we are doing the GQ...\n\n♪ Couples Quiz ♪\n\nLet's try that again.\n\n♪ Couples Quiz ♪\n\n[David laughs] David,\n\ndescribe our first date.\n\nOh! Bonus, if you can\n\nremember what I wore.\n\nIt was a long date.\n\nWe first went to the coffee shop\n\nthat's now at like a Chase Bank.\n\nYeah. In Union Square.\n\nThen we went to a movie, Taking Lives.\n\nYeah, we did.\n\nAnd then we went to dinner at 44 and X\n\nand you ordered the chicken and waffles.\n\nIt was like your thing to wear Abercrombie and Fitch\n\nand baggy jeans and I worked on that.\n\nWrong.\n\nI'm just kidding.\n\nWhat is the best way to make me laugh?\n\nTo say that you\n\nare gonna only buy-\n\nNo. Inexpensive clothes.\n\n[David laughing]\n\nWhat is my favorite gift you've given me?\n\nI have to say your 40th birthday.\n\nGo on. His 40th birthday\n\nscavenger hunt extravaganza across America.\n\nStarted with a surprise party in Los Angeles\n\nand we went cross country\n\npicking up clues and gifts and experiences\n\nto New York with another surprise birthday party.\n\nWeek long, week long. Epic.\n\nEpic. Took me a year to produce.\n\nAnd it was then I finally said I would love you.\n\nWell, why don't you show it?\n\nNext question.\n\nThis is easy. Okay.\n\nWhat made me want to become a chef?\n\nThe sudden passing of your mother.\n\nThat's true.\n\nMaking you realize that life is too short\n\nand you gotta do stuff that you want to do.\n\nYeah. It was a great call.\n\nYeah.\n\nThanks, buddy.\n\nWhat's my best party trick?\n\nThere's so many to choose from.\n\nThere is so many to choose from.\n\nI'd say either your bent fork,\n\nyou can bend a fork with your mind.\n\nTrue.\n\nOr you can make things disappear like-\n\nWrong!\n\nJuggling. I can juggle.\n\nOh.\n\nI've never seen you juggle at a party.\n\nIt's a great party trick. You should see it sometime.\n\nKills.\n\n[David humming circus music] See? Who can juggle?\n\nYou've never seen me do this?\n\nNot at a party.\n\nWait, where'd that one come... Outta my ass.\n\nLiterally. Yeah, right.\n\nOn the beach.\n\nIf you said it was your beach trick, but never at a party.\n\nOh!\n\nHow am I doing?\n\n[audience applauding] Thanks.\n\nThanks so much.\n\nEw! Someone's gotta clean that up.\n\nGet to work.\n\nWhat is my least favorite part of working together?\n\nThe last time we worked together\n\nwas on on Uncoupled season one,\n\nand I would guess that the least favorite thing-\n\nBut we never had scenes together.\n\nI would guess that the least favorite thing\n\nwas that I had a big, like, giant trailer\n\nand you were given like\n\none of the smaller ones. We didn't even\n\nwork together on that day. So what's the answer?\n\nNotes. You giving me notes. [Neil laughing]\n\nI don't give you notes.\n\nPages. Well...\n\nWrong. Sometimes they're earned.\n\nWhat's one food, David, I would absolutely never eat?\n\nPussy.\n\nWow. That wasn't true.\n\nNow! Not a gold star.\n\nOne food that you won't eat.\n\nWhat do I not like on anything?\n\n[imitates buzzer] Raw onion.\n\nOh, I was gonna say egg salad.\n\nIt depends on the egg salad.\n\nIn my opinion... Oh...\n\nWhat's the biggest dinner party faux pa?\n\nBringing flowers without a vase.\n\nDing, ding, ding, ding. Flowers without a vase.\n\nPeople just bring like a bouquet of flowers.\n\nNow I'm supposed to stop what I'm doing in cooking\n\nand get a vase and cut the flowers and put them out?\n\nYou can't bring a vase with it?\n\nHow much more time does it take\n\njust to put it in a fucking vase.\n\nGlass half full, this one. Glass half full.\n\nYou got it.\n\nYa got it. Ya got it.\n\nWhat is a skill I wish I had\n\nbut haven't learned yet?\n\nWoodworking.\n\nNo. I know how to work with wood.\n\n[bell dings] [bubbles popping]\n\nNo, I can't juggle five balls yet.\n\nOh, juggling again.\n\nI can juggle three. Can juggle four, no problem.\n\n[imitates air whooshes] Five to five pattern.\n\n[sighs] I can only play with so many balls.\n\nIf I could eat one thing for the rest of my life,\n\nwhat would it be? Probably a pasta?\n\nOh! Yeah!\n\nI think that's what I'd say. Really?\n\nYeah. Good job.\n\nI thought you were gonna say dick.\n\nWhat is my cocktail order?\n\nMargaritas Ding.\n\nNegronis Gin Negroni. Ding.\n\nManhattan.\n\nOh shit.\n\nRose? Rose, all day.\n\nDing, ding, and one more.\n\nThree outta four, considering you haven't had a drink in-\n\nSeven years. Seven years.\n\nI'm impressed by that. Yeah.\n\nOh, but I noticed how much you drink.\n\nNext question.\n\nWhat is my favorite character you've played?\n\nWhen we first started dating, I did a cabaret at Studio 54\n\nand I was the MC and I got to go around in the audience\n\nand you were sitting in one of those little cocktail tables\n\nand I got to drape myself over you\n\nand you were kind of crushing a little bit\n\nand I was a little flirty.\n\nWas that it?\n\nYeah. I'll give it to you.\n\nYour characters are long and extensive.\n\nLet's go through them. Oh God. Don't, please.\n\nOkay. I don't wanna fight.\n\nIf I were a drag queen, what would my stage name be?\n\nIsn't it, you take your grandma's name\n\nand you put the last dessert you ate.\n\nFor you, Eleanor Donut Hole?\n\n[Dave laughing]\n\nOkay. What would it be for real, for real, for real?\n\nI would take Gideon's favorite drag name for you?\n\nAnita Dolla. Anita Dala.\n\nWhat is my favorite thing you cook for me?\n\nBolognese. Easy.\n\nBolognese for the win.\n\nI mean, that's all day, every day.\n\nThere wasn't even a pause. Not even a question.\n\nThis motherfucker's bolognese is off the chain.\n\nWhether you eat it fresh and it's just made,\n\nor if it's been in the fridge for a day,\n\nor if it's been frozen and reheated.\n\nBy the way, you haven't made bolognese for me\n\nin like months.\n\nI don't do enough for you, do I?\n\nWho made the first move?\n\nI think it was me. I think it was you too.\n\nI think I made...\n\nI dropped you off after that first date.\n\nNo, it happened before that. Really?\n\nUh-huh. Scandalous.\n\nThere was that, like, chamber\n\nbefore you got to the bathroom.\n\n[gasps] Oh yeah.\n\nI did make the first move.\n\nIf you had to describe our relationship in three words-\n\nOh, Jesus. What would they be?\n\nCareful now.\n\nHilarious. Yeah.\n\nNonstop. Oh. Yeah.\n\nAdventure. I'm gonna give you\n\nthose three points. [bell dings]\n\nAll right. It's time- For the-\n\n[Both] Lightning round!\n\n[Dave imitating lightning and thunder]\n\nAre there graphics?\n\n[Dave shudders and groans]\n\nHarold or Kumar?\n\nHerold. Kumar.\n\nCoffee or Red Bull?\n\n[Both] Coffee?\n\nDesert island item.\n\nPuzzles.
