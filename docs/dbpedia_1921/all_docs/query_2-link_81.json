        "text": "When he was growing up in New Mexico, Neil Patrick Harris’ ­family started every Christmas morning the same way: with a giant breakfast of scrambled eggs, lots of bacon, and, his favorite, cinnamon rolls. “They were the ones from…the little guy,” he says, by which he means the Pillsbury Doughboy (real name: Poppin’ Fresh). The best part? Icing the tray of piping-hot pastries straight out of the oven. “That was terribly exciting,” says Harris, who appears in Alexander Payne’s sci-fi comedy Downsizing this December. “We rarely did that except Christmas morning.” Over time, rarely became never and the long-held childhood tradition was eventually forgotten. Until now. This year Harris and his husband of three years, David Burtka, plan to revisit the custom with their seven-year-old twins, Harper and Gideon. “David is a chef, so we will probably go a little more bespoke,” Harris says. “The idea of a nice homemade cinnamon roll on Christmas morning sounds divine right now.” Here’s more on the actor’s holiday traditions.\n\nThere’s a popular notion that people rediscover their love for the holidays after they have kids. Was that true for you?\n\nWithout a doubt. Our first two years [before we moved to New York] we were in Los Angeles, where the holidays have an ephemeral effect because it’s still 78 degrees and sunny all through Christmas Eve. It doesn’t quite invoke rum punches and crackling fires and wearing scarves and caps. The holidays would whisk by and it would suddenly be January. Once you have kids that then start opening gifts, and making gifts for each other, it takes the holidays to an entirely different level. I’m very appreciative of that.\n\nI love that.\n\nAnd then the last couple of years Mr. Claus has given the kids the gift of an experiential adventure. [Last] Christmas morning we got in a car and drove to the airport and went to Hawaii and spent a week there. Now we have a time stamp of that experience as opposed to a pile of wrappings. That may be our new tradition–a little bit of travel.\n\nWhen you’re hosting a holiday party, do you guys cook, order in, dine out, or cater?\n\nI provide some sort of holiday cocktail, mixology situation, usually in the form of punch. And then David is responsible for figuring out the delicious food. And then we follow it up with drunken gift exchange, which goes on until very late in the night, and is incredibly fun for as long as people can remember they were there.\n\nChampagne and eggnog are two mainstays of holiday drinking. I want to know, do you stick to those or are you a cocktail renegade?\n\nI was trained in my mixology education by one of the managers at the NoMad, the bar in New York. He taught me a great love for the process of... being a chemist in making some sort of drink. I learned the hard way, but Champagne and eggnog together do not make a good punch.\n\nAny punch advice?\n\nI try to do a Christmas punch that looks delicious, that is complex in flavor profile, has something to do with the holidays, and most importantly doesn’t get you super wasted super quickly. Because the nature of punch is that there’s a ladle and that you’re supposed to sort of help yourself. And if you arrive at 6 p.m. and it’s a long night, you’re going to have 11 glasses of punch before it’s all said and done, and if it’s very sugary you will regret having ever experienced the evening.\n\nDo you ever root your New Year’s resolution in food reformation?\n\nI don’t. I try to make my resolutions more cerebral. I think the new year is a good time for reflection, as opposed to creating boundaries. My resolution tends to be more like, I want to spend more time in silence, or I want to be more overtly thankful, or I want to eventually write in a journal. It’s not like I’m going to cut out Haagen Dazs chocolate peanut butter ice cream, because that will never happen. And don’t even get me started on Reese’s peanut butter cups.\n\nAre Reese’s peanut butter cups something you indulge in all year round?\n\nI’m offended that they make individual packages of two. No one can eat simply just two Reese’s peanut butter cups because they’re so delicious.\n\nMy last question is actually candy-based. What's your take on candy canes? Edible treat or strictly decoration?\n\nI’m a huge fan of the flavor of the candy cane. [But] I’m a bigger fan of the individually wrapped candies that taste like a candy cane, because I’ve found half-licked candy canes in the pockets of my children's pants, and that will turn me into a Grinch very quickly.\n\nKids try 100 years of candy:\n\nNeed to figure out the perfect holiday gift?
