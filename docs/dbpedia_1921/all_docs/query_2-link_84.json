Have an account? .\n\n\"How I Met Your Mother\" ran for nine seasons, but even big fans might not know all of these facts.\n\nBritney Spears' guest role helped to save the show from low ratings and an early cancellation.\n\nMany of the leading cast members' significant others appeared in small roles on the show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe narrator, who was supposed to be an older Ted Mosby, was voiced by Bob Saget.\n\nJosh Radnor played Ted on the CBS show, but the late Bob Saget was cast to do the \"future Ted\" voice-overs that narrated the series.\n\nThe show wasn't actually filmed in New York City.\n\nNew York City may be a central character in the series, but according to the New York Post, they really filmed on a studio lot in Los Angeles that was designed to look like the Big Apple.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJim Parsons was almost cast as Barney.\n\nBefore Neil Patrick Harris landed the role, Jim Parsons auditioned for Barney on the show. But there are no hard feelings from the \"The Big Bang Theory\" star.\n\n\"Look, it all worked out fine … Neil's better for the part, let's be honest,\" Parsons said on a 2015 episode of \"Live With Kelly,\" according to Yahoo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJennifer Love Hewitt almost played Robin.\n\nReal-life Canadian Cobie Smulders eventually snagged the part of Robin, but only after Jennifer Love Hewitt turned it down.\n\nAccording to E! News, cocreator Craig Thomas wrote on Reddit that Love Hewitt decided to do CBS' \"The Ghost Whisperer\" instead of \"HIMYM.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBritney Spears saved the show from low ratings.\n\nThe pop singer guest-starred as Abby the receptionist on season three, episode 13. According to E! News, cocreator Carter Bays told Reddit that she helped bring in new viewers and saved the show from low ratings.\n\n\"By golly she put our show on the map. It can't be overstated,\" Bays wrote. \"Britney Spears rescued us from ever being on the [renewal] bubble again. Thanks Britney!\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe show's creators are in a real-life band, and they wrote and performed the series' theme song.\n\nThe theme song of \"HIMYM\" is known for its infectiously catchy tune, and it turns out the show's creators had a big hand in creating it.\n\nThe song, \"Hey Beautiful,\" is by the band The Solids, which Bays and Carter are both members of. Bays does vocals and guitar, and Thomas plays the drums.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA real proposal happened during the filming of the show.\n\nAccording to the New York Daily News, Jana Rugan and Timothy Russo really got engaged on the season-two finale.\n\nRusso's friend wrote for the series and arranged for the couple to stand in as extras since it was Rugan's favorite show.\n\nOn the episode, Robin and Ted were on a date when the waiter mistakenly brought Robin a champagne glass with a ring at the bottom. She freaked out — and so did Ted since he wasn't actually proposing — then Russo came over to claim the ring as his and proposed to Rugan for real.\n\n\"At first she thought I was messing up the scene, then it dawned on her and she started crying and everyone was clapping. It was awesome,\" Russo told the Daily News.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of the show's famous props went home with the lead actors.\n\nIn 2014, Bays and Thomas told Yahoo News that some of the show's iconic props ended up going home with the stars after the series ended.\n\nHarris took Barney's Playbook and the tabletop from their booth at McLaren's, Smulders kept Robin Sparkles' bedazzled jean jacket, Alyson Hannigan ended up with a little red British phone booth, and Radnor got to keep Ted's coveted blue French horn.\n\nBays also ended up decorating his own home with the two swords that were hanging up in Ted and Marshall's apartment, and Thomas ended up taking a few set pieces from McLaren's, including one of the gang's red booths.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarris made it his mission to get Barney and Robin together on the show.\n\nSmulders was apprehensive when there were initial chats about the characters getting together, but Harris actively tried to make it happen throughout filming.\n\n\"I'd try to do little things in our scenes together where I gave her an extra look and an extra glance or would stare only at her during a whole scene just to see if anyone was noticing,\" Harris told The Fan Carpet of his own personal mission to get Barney and Robin together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTed probably made Barney sound worse on purpose to make himself look better in the end.\n\nIn 2018, Harris agreed with a popular fan theory in an interview with Digital Spy.\n\nThe theory speculated that Ted made Barney sound extra sleazy and womanizing in his story for his kids because he didn't want them to judge him for falling for Barney's ex-wife, Robin.\n\n\"I think that that's very accurate,\" Harris told Digital Spy. \"Given the story structure, and with [Ted] telling the story to his kids, everything was able to be overdrawn.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of the leading actors' significant others made it onto the show.\n\nLily's high-school sweetheart Scooter was portrayed by Harris' real-life husband David Burtka.\n\nHannigan, who played Lily, also shared the screen with her husband, Alexis Denisof, who had a recurring role on the show as Robin's coanchor Sandy Rivers.\n\nSmulders' husband Taran Killam was another spouse who made it onto \"HIMYM.\" He actually played two characters on the show, a one-time appearance as Derrick and the recurring character Gary Blauman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth Smulders and Hannigan had to hide pregnancies during filming.\n\nDuring season five, the actor who played Robin and the actor who played Lily were both pregnant, but their characters were not. So the props team just kept hiding their growing bellies behind large props and handbags.\n\n\"We have the biggest purses of any show on the air,\" director Pamela Fryman told the Chicago Tribune.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHannigan wanted her daughter to play her on-screen child.\n\nWhen Lily did end up having a child on the show, Hannigan's young daughter was set to play the role.\n\nBut, Hannigan told the HuffPost in 2017 that they decided she was too old for the part.\n\n\"They fired my kid from that role. She was gonna be the baby, but Carter Bays was like, 'Nope. She's too old,' and she got replaced,\" Hannigan said.\n\nHarris' love for magic was added to Barney's character.\n\nAccording to Entertainment Weekly, the actor has even written a children's book about magic, so it's clear that Harris influenced Barney's hobby.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The Bro Code\" really exists.\n\nYou can buy the series-approved version of all of Barney's rules, and it's even \"written\" by Barney Stinson himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost of the websites from the show are real too.\n\nHer Campus reported that most of the websites the characters shout out on the series are actually live on the internet.\n\nSee for yourself at tedmosbyisajerk.com, barneysvideoresume.com, and notafathersday.com to name a few.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe characters' favorite bar was named after the cocreator's assistant.\n\nBays told TV Squad that his assistant, Carl McLaren, lent his name to the bar, McLaren's, and to its bartender, Carl.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fictional bar is also based on a real establishment in New York City.\n\nAccording to the New York Post, McLaren's is modeled after a pub in New York City called McGee's.\n\nBays and Thomas reportedly spent a lot of time in the real-life establishment when they were both writing for \"The Late Show With David Letterman\" earlier in their careers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome fans found out who the mother was on Facebook before they had a chance to watch the episode.\n\nAccording to The Obsessive Viewer, the official \"HIMYM\" Facebook page posted a photo of the mother right after the episode that revealed her identity aired.\n\nHowever, not every fan was able to watch the episode live, so they had the series-long plot point spoiled for them if they scrolled past the post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVictoria would have been the mother if the show had been canceled early.\n\nAccording to E! News, Bays told Reddit that a season-one cancellation would have resulted in them writing Victoria in as the mother.\n\nOf course, the show actually went on for nine seasons, so that plan got scrapped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver seven years after the \"HIMYM\" finale, a sequel series starring Hilary Duff premiered on Hulu.\n\nAfter the failed \"How I Met Your Dad\" spin-off, Deadline reported in 2017 that a \"How I Met Your Father\" series was in development. But it took a few years to get it off the ground.\n\nThe Hulu sequel series stars Hilary Duff as Sophie, the leading Ted-like role, who is telling her son the story of how she met his father.\n\nThis story was originally published in September 2018 and most recently updated on June 15, 2023.\n\nRead More:\n\nRead next\n\nTV TV Show TV Shows\n\nAdvertisement"
