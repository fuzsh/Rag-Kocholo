        "text": "David Burtka: “Can’t do interviews now. I’m in tech rehearsals. Our show ‘It Shoulda Been You’ opens April 14, plus I’m caring for two kids. I’m very busy.”\n\nFinally, talked off the ledge, this U of Michigan grad, veteran of shows like “Gypsy” said: “The play’s about two star-crossed mothers, different religions, and their kids’ wedding. I’m the gentile groom. My face couldn’t play Jewish.\n\n“It’s been a long road. A humble Dearborn beginning. Secretary mom, dad teaching handicapped children. Working for what they had. Eventually I moved to LA but, not good for me, I felt rejected. So I stopped acting and, needing to feel good inside, became a chef. Then 11 years ago I met Neil Patrick Harris. We moved to New York, which we love. We have twins, who are now 4, and we’re married.\n\n“I’m happy ever since stepping back to New York. Nervous a little about the opening. Butterflies are happening inside. It’s my first big break back on Broadway. I got this because, singing and dancing in musicals nobody cared about, I’d also worked for producer Daryl Roth in ‘The Goat.’\n\n“We kept running into one another so it’s like I was on her radar. Behind us at ‘The Lion King,’ with one of our kids asleep, she asked if I’d quit the business. I said no, I wanted back in it. She mentioned doing this new show.”\n\nSo how’s it work with children when one parent’s hosting the Oscars and the other’s opening on Broadway?\n\n“One day it’s swimming, another’s dance class. When Neil did ‘Hedwig’ with all-day rehearsals, I took the reins. Physically, he couldn’t take the kids to school. We have help, but now Neil’s being dad and he feeds them dinner. Listen, when you have kids it takes a village.”\n\nTo check out\n\nComing attractions: Brian Grazer, possessor of Geronimo’s haircut/producer of “Apollo 13” and TV’s “Empire,” mixes it up Tues., April 7, 7:30 p.m., 92nd Street Y’s “Genius and Curiosity,” with Malcolm Gladwell, author of “Outliers” and “The Tipping Point” . . . Plus Avenue magazine’s prepping Peggy Siegal’s annual take on who hic’d, burped, and sulked at the Oscars.\n\nCelebrate Southampton\n\nKindly pay attention. Southampton, New York State’s first English settlement, honors the town’s 375th birthday June 30 — just days after settlers arrived at Conscience Point on June 12, 1640. The Rogers Mansion party is springing for a party. Why they couldn’t celebrate on the exact date, who knows? Maybe a previous bar mitzvah was booked.\n\nI told you so\n\nExcuuuuse me, but did mother not tell you, kiddies, of cats ’n’ dogs scratching and grrring behind E!-TV’s “Fashion Police”??? . . . Academy Awardee Eddie Redmayne’s gift to himself? “Pizza with extra pepperoni” . . . I’ve never been to Quatorze Bis, but George Stephanopoulos had dinner there . . . NY Hilton’s March 28 Inner Circle annual spoof of political figures is titled “Going to Pot.”\n\nOdds & ends\n\nPer Fran Healy, host of MSG-TV’s “The Game 365,” at Da Tommaso: Israel’s goodwill ambassador Tal Brody says a Supreme Court justice there is Arabian . . . Oscar producers Zadan and Meron hoped for more mashups like John Travolta strangling Idina Menzel’s name . . . George Takei, “Star Trek’s” original Mr. Sulu, debuts on B’way this fall. “Allegiance” is based on his own childhood.\n\nComing soon\n\nComedian Stephen Fry, thrilling civilization with third memoir, “More Fool Me,” knows “Napoleon, Socrates, Churchill, even Jesus had lives rendered in single volumes.” . . . And “So Many Roads: Life and Times of the Grateful Dead” is out April 28. Deadheads will salivate back to Haight-Ashbury.\n\nBergdorf’s, Friday, first day of spring, is designer Joanna Mastroianni’s 12-to-4 trunk show. Into spring cleaning? Her couture springs from $4,600 to $16,000."
