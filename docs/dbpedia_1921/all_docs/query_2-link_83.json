        "text": "Chef and actor David Burtka’s new tome is not just a simple cookbook. Yes, Life Is a Party has recipes, but it’s also chock-full of ways to turn any occasion into a cause for celebration. “I think nowadays with what’s going on in the world—the political and the planet and all of us sort of attached to our phones and being in solitude and our own bubble—I think we have an obligation to get out there and be social, grab some friends, and start sharing memorable moments,” says the author.\n\nOne excuse to host a soirée at home, of course, is the Kentucky Derby, which is fast approaching on May 4. Burtka, who lives in New York City with his husband, Neil Patrick Harris, and their 8-year-old twins, Harper and Gideon, says that while in the past he’s spent the day at swanky Manhattan restaurant Eleven Madison Park’s legendary bash, this year he’s considering hosting a small “Derby de Mayo” get together in honor of this weekend’s other holiday. “You can do a take on a Mint Julep Margarita—instead of using bourbon, you could do tequila. In terms of decor, you could do a piñata horse, or a [play on the] Run for the Roses with Mexican flowers and roses. There are multiple things you could do and have fun with,” he says.\n\nBelow, David Burtka shares more of his tried-and-true tips for a classic Kentucky Derby celebration.\n\nCome Up Roses with Your Decor\n\nThe race is nicknamed “The Run For the Roses” because of the garland of 400 red roses presented to the winner each year, which lends itself perfectly to a decor scheme. “You can either get silk flowers which look real or get actual real flowers. I always prefer real flowers, but they can tend to be a bit expensive,” says Burtka. “A table lined with roses in vases, and then maybe put some horseshoes around it, get some pendants up there, some blue ribbons, make a blue garland.” He notes that a little gold spray paint on the horseshoes and your vases will go nicely with the red roses.\n\n3 mint sprigs\n\n1 T light brown sugar\n\nSplash soda water\n\n2 oz. bourbon\n\nPlenty of crushed ice, at least 2 cups\n\nIn the bottom of a julep cup or lowball glass, add the leaves from 2 mint sprigs, the brown sugar, and a splash of soda water. Muddle mint and sugar, being careful not to break the mint into small pieces. Add crushed ice until the cup is half full, then add bourbon and stir vigorously. Add more ice until the glass is full, then garnish with remaining sprig of mint and serve at once.\n\nDelicious Eats\n\nWhen it comes to food, this day is an excuse to indulge in decadent Southern fare. Below, Burtka shares a recipe from Life Is a Party.\n\nCorn Cakes with Bacon Jam\n\nIngredients\n\nMakes 20–24 small cakes and 2 cups jam\n\nFor the bacon jam:\n\n1 lb. bacon slices, cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-wide pieces\n\n1 large yellow onion, thinly sliced\n\n2 T tomato paste\n\n2 T packed dark brown sugar\n\n1/4 cup sherry vinegar\n\n1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes\n\nKosher salt\n\nFor the chive sour cream:\n\n1/2 cup sour cream\n\n4 T sliced chives\n\nFor the corn cakes:\n\n2 cups fresh corn kernels (from 2 to 3 large ears of corn)\n\n2 T unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly\n\n2 large eggs, separated\n\n1/3 cup stone-ground yellow cornmeal\n\n1/3 cup all-purpose flour\n\n1 T granulated sugar\n\n1 tsp. garlic powder\n\n1 tsp. kosher salt, plus more for seasoning\n\n1/4 tsp. freshly ground black pepper, plus more for seasoning\n\n1. Make the bacon jam: Place the bacon in a large cast-iron skillet and cook over medium heat, stirring often, until the fat has completely rendered and the bacon is crispy and deeply golden brown, about 25 minutes. There should only be about 2 tablespoons of rendered fat in the pan at any time; as the bacon cooks, carefully spoon the excess fat into a glass jar or bowl and set it aside. You’ll use it later for frying. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the bacon to a large paper towel–lined plate to drain. Remove all but 2 tablespoons of the fat from the pan, if necessary, and return the pan to medium heat.\n\n2. Add the onion and a splash of water to the pan. Use the back of a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan, then cook until the onion is completely tender and golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes, adding more water as needed if the onion sticks or starts to burn.\n\n3. Stir in the tomato paste, brown sugar, vinegar, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring frequently, until the mixture is thick, about 5 minutes. Transfer the mixture (including the cooled bacon) to a food processor and pulse until thick and jammy, about 15 pulses. Transfer the mixture to a small bowl, taste, and season with salt. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature while you make the corn cakes. (If you’re making the jam in advance, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 7 days.)\n\n4. Make the chive sour cream: In a small bowl, stir together the sour cream and 2 tablespoons of the chives; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.\n\n5. Make the corn cakes: In a blender, combine 1-1⁄2 cups of the corn, the butter, and the egg yolks and blend until mostly smooth. In a large bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Form a well in the center, add the wet corn mixture, and stir until just combined.\n\n6. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Fold the egg whites, remaining 1⁄2 cup corn, and remaining 2 tablespoons chives into the batter.\n\n7. In a large cast-iron skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the reserved bacon fat over medium-high heat. When the fat starts to shimmer, drop about 8 heaping tablespoons of the batter into the pan, 1 tablespoon at a time, leaving enough space between them to allow them to expand and for easy flipping. Cook until the edges begin to set and the bottoms are lightly browned, about 2 minutes, then flip and cook until the second side is lightly browned and the corn cake is cooked through, about 2 minutes more. Transfer the corn cakes to a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Cook the remaining batter, adding more bacon fat to the pan if needed. (Leftover bacon fat can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 month). If needed, season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve the corn cakes hot or at room temperature, topped with the bacon jam and chive sour cream."
