        "text": "As actors and the parents of 8-year-old twins, Neil Patrick Harris and his husband, David Burtka, who is also a chef, know how to improvise. “There is no consistency to our routine except that we’re together and spending quality time with the kids,” Mr. Burtka, 44, said.\n\nMr. Burtka’s first cookbook, “Life Is A Party,” a collection of recipes and tips on entertaining, was published in April. Mr. Harris, 46, recently gave a character-stretching performance in the Netflix show “A Series of Unfortunate Events.”\n\nThe couple also co-produced the documentary “Wig,” which traces the history and influence of “Wigstock,” an annual drag festival that had a 20-year run in Manhattan’s East Village. On June 18, the film will have its premiere on HBO.\n\nMr. Harris and Mr. Burtka live with their son, Gideon, their daughter, Harper, and a dog named Gidget in Harlem.\n\nPANCAKE BAR Neil Patrick Harris: The kids usually wake us up between 6:30 and 7. David and I get out of bed together, and we all head downstairs. Before anything, we use our Jura machine to make ourselves espressos. David Burtka: Harper is into making pancakes and uses a recipe I wrote. The secret ingredient is vanilla. Gideon whips up slow scrambled eggs with herbs, and I make sausage or bacon. I set up a pancake bar with toppings like syrup, lemon curd, peanut butter and powdered sugar."
