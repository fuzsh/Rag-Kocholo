Harris was named one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People in 2010.[4]\n\nEarly life and education\n\nHarris was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico,[1] and grew up in Ruidoso, New Mexico, with his older brother and their parents, Sheila Gail (née Scott; born 1946) and Ronald Gene Harris (born 1946). His parents were lawyers and also ran a restaurant.[5][6][7][8][9] He attended La Cueva High School in Albuquerque, graduating with high honors in 1991,[10] which he attributes to being privately tutored half the school year while on set.[11]\n\nCareer\n\n1989–2003\n\nHarris began his career as a child actor and was discovered by playwright Mark Medoff at a drama camp in Las Cruces, New Mexico.[12] Medoff later cast him in the 1988 drama film Clara's Heart, starring Whoopi Goldberg and based on the novel of the same name by Joseph Olshan. Clara's Heart earned Harris a Golden Globe nomination. The same year, he starred in Purple People Eater, a children's fantasy. Beginning in 1989, Harris played the title role of a child prodigy doctor in Doogie Howser, M.D., for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe. After the show's four-season run ended in 1993, Harris played a number of guest roles on television series, including Murder, She Wrote. From 1999 to 2000, he starred with Tony Shalhoub in the NBC sitcom Stark Raving Mad, which lasted 22 episodes. Harris's first film role as an adult was 1995's Animal Room, although he portrayed a teenager.\n\nHarris played lead roles in a number of made-for-television features including Snowbound: The Jim and Jennifer Stolpa Story in 1994, My Ántonia in 1995, The Christmas Wish in 1998, Joan of Arc in 1999, The Wedding Dress in 2001, and The Christmas Blessing in 2005. His film work also has included supporting roles in The Next Best Thing (2000), Undercover Brother (2002), and Starship Troopers (1997).\n\nHarris has worked on Broadway in both musical and dramatic roles.

In 2004, Harris played a fictionalized, hyper-womanising, lewd version of himself in the Harold and Kumar stoner comedy film Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle. He said that was the shift from roles associated with his sanitized \"Doogie Howser\" character to the more unscrupulous and bawdy part in the Harold & Kumar franchise lead to his role of Barney Stinson in How I Met Your Mother the following year.[14] He would go on to reprise the role of \"Neil Patrick Harris\" in the Harold & Kumar sequels: Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay and A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas.

Channeling his inner Rockette, along with Iggy Pop and Lou Reed by way of the Ramones, he carries off some advanced dance and acrobatic moves\".[34] Harris went on to win the 2014 Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical.[35] Later in 2014, Harris played the role of Desi Collings in Gone Girl, directed by David Fincher.\n\nIn 2014, Harris turned down the chance to replace David Letterman as host of the Late Show on CBS, stating that he feared he would get bored of the repetition that hosting a nightly talk show would entail. He also rejected the suggestion of replacing Craig Ferguson as host of The Late Late Show on the same grounds,[36] although he claims he was never actually offered either job.[37] In October 2014, Harris released a memoir titled Neil Patrick Harris: Choose Your Own Autobiography, which is structured like a Choose Your Own Adventure book.

In a 2008 appearance on The Howard Stern Show, he discussed how the relationship made him realize his true sexuality: \"She's the coolest, nicest chick ever. She's an absolute catch, and I thought, 'If I'm not going to feel the super sparks with her... it probably means I'm gay.'\"[55]\n\nHarris publicly came out as gay in November 2006, saying, \"I am happy to dispel any rumors or misconceptions and am quite proud to say that I am a very content gay man living my life to the fullest and feel most fortunate to be working with wonderful people in the business I love.\"[56]\n\nHarris has been in a relationship with actor and chef David Burtka since April 2004.
