        "text": "David Burtka is an American actor, who portrayed the character of Jerry in the Netflix's original series Uncoupled.\n\nGeneral overview[]\n\nBurtka was born in Dearborn, Michigan, the son of Deborah A. Zajas (died 2008) and Daniel Burtka. He is of Polish descent. He grew up in Canton, Michigan, and graduated from Salem High School in 1993. He trained in acting at Interlochen Center for the Arts, obtained his Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of Michigan and had further training at the William Esper Studios. Six months after Burtka's first How I Met Your Mother appearance, allegations arose that the actor had received the part because of a romantic relationship with one of the show's stars, actor Neil Patrick Harris.[1]\n\nGallery[]\n\n[]\n\non the Internet Movie Database\n\non Instagram\n\nDavid Burtka on Wikipedia"
