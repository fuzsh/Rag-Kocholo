        "text": "The production celebrates the centennial of Miller’s birth, and following two extension announcements, will now run through Dec. 20.\n\nThe cast also includes David Abeles (Once), Curtis Billings (The Trip to Bountiful), James Carpinello (Rock of Ages), AJ Cedeño (Strawberry & Chocolate), Quinlan Corbett (Rosario and the Gypsies), Brian Cross (Desire), Demosthenes Chrysan (Golden Boy), Jonathan Gordon (Orphans), Tony nominee Jonathan Hadary (Gypsy), Alex Morf (Of Mice and Men), Tony Award nominee Jonny Orsini (The Nance), Darren Pettie (Butley), John Procaccino (The Qualms), Alec Shaw, Derek Smith (Desire) and Evan Zes (The Freedom of The City).\n\nTaking place in Vichy, France, during the Nazi occupation, the play sees a group of people called into an interrogation room under suspicious circumstances in an effort to reveal the Jews among them. As foreboding rumors of concentration camps begin to circulate, the men battle over politics, philosophy and an escape. It is billed as a \"haunting examination of the cold, bureaucratic efficiency of evil.\"\n\nIncident at Vichy was last seen on Broadway in 1964. It returns to the Signature Theatre for the first time since Miller's residency there in 1997-98. The design team includes Jeff Cowie (scenic design), David C. Woolard (costume design), David Lander (lighting design), John Gromada (sound design), Rocco DiSanti (projection design), Deborah Hecht (dialect coach) and Mark Olsen (fight direction). Robert Bennett is the production stage manager. Casting is by Telsey + Company, Karyn Casl, CSA."
