        "text": "The actor and his partner David Burtka stepped out for the premiere of \"Smurfs 2\" in Los Angeles yesterday (July 28) with their adorable twins, Harper and Gideon. The 2-year-olds giggled as they posed on the red carpet, flashing their best smiles for the camera to celebrate their dad's new animated flick. Harper wore a mini sequined dress and sandals while her brother sported shorts, a white-collared shirt and bow tie.\n\n\"The older they get, the more I love being a dad,\" Harris told People magazine recently of his kids, who turn 3 in October. \"Now that they're talking, I'm really loving the camp counselor end of parenting. I'm all about reasoning. If they fall and are okay but crying, David will be the hugger, and I'll be the 'Show me where it hurts; let's talk about it' one. I come from a family of lawyers, so explanation is crucial.\""
