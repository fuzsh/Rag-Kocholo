After hitting rock bottom in a harrowing public meltdown, Paul got sober and started a difficult journey to discovering the true happiness he feels today. Together with author, director and screenwriter Tracey Jackson, Paul has written a book, \"Gratitude and Trust,\" outlining six affirmations they say can help people become better versions of themselves. The co-authors claim that the affirmations work for fear-based habits like perfectionism, overeating, fear of intimacy and even smartphone obsession. Paul says, \"When getting help was important enough for me to let go of ego and do it, I began to connect. And that connection, that brought me to life.\" Want more podcasts from OWN?
