        "text": "It might be easier to trace the genealogy of an alley cat than that of the typical Hollywood studio: Over the last century or so, most have accumulated a tangled list of owners and corporate forebears — and none more so than Paramount Pictures.\n\nParamount is currently owned by Viacom Inc., which is in turn controlled by Sumner Redstone and his daughter, Shari, through their privately held National Amusements Inc. But the studio’s family tree will become more complicated if Viacom succeeds in its plan to sell a minority stake in Paramount to an outside investor, yet to be identified.\n\nThat new partial parent will expand a corporate ancestry that has been growing since 1912, when Adolph Zukor, a nickelodeon king, allied with Daniel and Charles Frohman to start what was then called the Famous Players Film Company.\n\nW.W. Hodkinson was a theater owner based in Utah, where he sometimes gazed on a mountain in the Wasatch Range that inspired the logo for his Paramount Pictures Corp. The company was founded in 1914 and became a national film distributor, through which Famous Players and Lasky released movies—but not happily.\n\n“I was not entirely satisfied with that arrangement,” Mr. Zukor wrote in his autobiography, “The Public Is Never Wrong,” referring to the standard deal under which Paramount received 35 percent of the receipts from each film. Paramount’s early output included Jack London-inspired films like “An Odyssey of the North.”\n\nMr. Zukor began buying up stock in Paramount. And in 1916, Famous Players, Lasky and Paramount merged to form what was called the Famous Players-Lasky Corp., with Paramount Pictures as its increasingly famous film brand.\n\nMr. Goldwyn left amid internal conflicts, some provoked by his belief that Mr. Zukor was overpaying stars like Mary Pickford. “The Knickerbocker Buckaroo,” a 1919 comedy with Douglas Fairbanks, soon to become Ms. Pickford’s husband, was among its many star-laden films.\n\nUnder its chairman, Mr. Redstone, who was then 70 years old, Viacom bought Paramount in a deal valued at about $10 billion. The sale followed a bruising fight with a rival bidder, QVC Network Inc., which was run by the former Paramount top executive, Mr. Diller.\n\n“Here’s to us who won,” Mr. Redstone said in toasting the purchase at a family dinner.\n\nMs. Redstone, 61, who is a major shareholder in National Amusements, is expected to wage a fight for control of Viacom upon the eventual death or disability of her father, who is now 92. She does not want to run the company herself, but wants to change the leadership structure. Mr. Dauman, Viacom’s chief executive, has begun to search for an investor who will take a stake in Paramount, and perhaps help to reinvigorate the film operation.\n\nLast year Paramount ranked last among Hollywood’s major studios, according to Boxofficemojo.com, with only 5.9 percent of the domestic box office, notwithstanding a lift from its biggest hit, “Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation,” which had about $195 million in North American ticket sales.\n\nWhich person, company or combination thereof next joins the Paramount ownership family will now be up to Mr. Dauman, Mr. Redstone and the Viacom board. The new part-owner can presumably look forward to the premiere of “Star Trek: Beyond,” set for release in July."
