        "text": "Number Of Movies: 64\n\nBeginning his fruitful acting career in the early '80s, Tom Hanks is one of the most memorable actors of all time. Hanks conveys a likable charm on-screen but is also capable of playing multiple kinds of characters including villains. Hanks has acted in several extremely beloved roles, including his Oscar-winning turns in Forrest Gump, where he plays the extraordinary title character who changes history; and Philadelphia, where he plays a lawyer fired for his sexuality and HIV status. Other monumental roles from Hanks include his leading performances in Big, Cast Away, Saving Private Ryan, Captain Phillips, and A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.\n\nWhat many fans of Hanks may not realize is that he started his career in a little-known slasher called He Knows You're Alone. The film follows a killer who murders brides on their wedding day and Hanks shows up as comedic relief, providing one of the most enjoyable performances in the entire film. This early role is a major indication that the actor would become a major star.\n\nNumber Of Movies: 88\n\nAnthony Hopkins is one of the most famous actors in the world, partially due to his legendary role as cannibal psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs and two of its sequels. Hopkins has the skill to be extremely likable while simultaneously terrifying the viewer with his sadistic charm, making him one of the most sought-after actors of all time.\n\nIn addition to playing Hannibal Lecter, Hopkins is known for playing former President Richard Nixon in 1995's Nixon, Van Helsing in Bram Stoker's Dracula, Alfred Hitchcock in 2012's Hitchcock, and Odin in the Thor films. Anthony Hopkins can also be seen in one of the main roles in 2010's The Wolfman. While Wolfman failed to achieve financial success at the time of its release, Hopkins brings a campy fun to his role and is the main reason to watch it.\n\nNumber Of Movies: 132\n\nIn the world of British cinema, Michael Caine is one of the most prominent names around. Caine's acting style is focused and filled with finesse, and will never fail to fully engage the audience. One of Caine's most revered performances is in the original 1969 Italian Job, though modern audiences will probably be more familiar with his portrayal of Batman's butler Alfred in The Dark Knight trilogy.\n\nOther unforgettable roles from Caine can be seen in Sleuth, Hannah and Her Sisters, Austin Powers in Goldmember, The Cider House Rules, and Youth. Caine may surprise even his most committed fans with his overlooked performance in Brian De Palma's Dressed to Kill, a classic thriller that has been a bit left behind by the younger generations.\n\nNumber Of Movies: 136\n\nAfter starring in several smash hits from Quentin Tarantino, Samuel L. Jackson has cemented himself as a true legend, with his most acclaimed role most likely being hitman Jules from Pulp Fiction. The actor's instantly recognizable voice and force of personality make him stand out from many other leading men in Hollywood.\n\nA more obscure role that Jackson deserves more recognition for would definitely be his work as retired police chief Marcus Banks in Spiral, which is part of the Saw franchise. Jackson's intense screen presence is perfect for that hard-hitting horror movie. Another more underrated performance from Jackson is his villainous turn as Jimmy in Paul Thomas Anderson's first feature, Hard Eight.\n\nNumber Of Movies: 137\n\nThe father of Kiefer Sutherland, Donald Sutherland is a legend who has changed the game time and time again. Donald Sutherland dominates the screen with his alluring voice and commanding presence.\n\nSutherland's most well-known performance may be in the leading role in Invasion of the Body Snatchers. A role that Sutherland never gets enough recognition for nowadays is in Don't Look Now. In Don't Look Now, Sutherland plays John Baxter, a grieving father. The end of Don't Look Now is one of the most shocking endings in horror history, and the film remains one of the most daring of Sutherland's career.\n\nNumber Of Movies: 197\n\nChristopher Lee featured in more film roles than any other actor from his generation. Lee had a wide range when it came to acting and was capable of playing many characters from different walks of life. The actor appeared in about 244 feature films and TV movies throughout his career, earning him the title of most film roles ever in the Guinness Book of World Records.\n\nLee is known for appearing in many Hammer horror films including 1958's Dracula (AKA House of Dracula) and The Mummy. Lee starred as Lord Summerisle in the 1973 folk horror film The Wicker Man, and the actor himself has cited the role as a favorite of his career. Lee is also remembered for playing Saruman in the Lord of the Rings film series and Count Dooku in the Star Wars franchise.\n\nOne of Lee's roles that deserves a lot more attention is his portrayal of Mr. Alfred Rhinegold in 2009's Boogie Woogie, a satire of the art world. Lee also appeared in a little-known sequel to The Wicker Man in 2011 called The Wicker Tree, which will prove to be worthwhile for most fans of the original."
