        "text": "01 of 21\n\nRyan Reynolds as Cal\n\nRyan Reynolds, who returns as Deadpool in Deadpool & Wolverine this summer, stars in the film as Cal, Bea's neighbor who can see IFs. Together, they work together to reunite the IFs with their former kids. In addition to starring in the project, Reynolds also produced the film alongside Krasinski.\n\nReynolds spoke with PEOPLE about IF at the film’s premiere in New York City, noting that his children were super excited to tune in. During an appearance on the Today show, Reynolds added this his daughter Betty has imaginary friends of her own, noting that she had “a very vivid imagination.”\n\n02 of 21\n\nCailey Fleming as Bea\n\nCailey Fleming, 17, stars in the movie as Bea, a young girl who gets the ability to see imaginary friends after going through a troubling experience. During the premiere, Reynolds praised his costar, joking that his children “worship” Fleming and she was easily their top choice to babysit them among the cast.\n\nBefore IF, Fleming got her breakout playing young Rey in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, a role she reprised in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Like Reynolds, she is no stranger to the MCU, having previously played a Young Sylvie in Disney+’s hit series Loki.\n\n03 of 21\n\nJohn Krasinski as Bea’s Dad / Marshmallow Man\n\nJohn Krasinski is pulling quadruple duty for IF, as the director, writer, producer and one of the stars. In addition to playing Bea’s dad, he also voices the character Marshmallow Man.\n\nSimilar to how Krasinski penned A Quiet Place as a “love letter” to his daughters, the Office alumnus was inspired to write the upcoming children’s film because of his girls. \"I made this movie for my kids,\" he told CBS Mornings noting that the story stemmed from watching his kids amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"I saw their light starting to go out. And I saw that the world started to seep in, and that is the definition of growing up,\" Krasinski said. \"I just called everyone up and said 'Listen, you have no reason to do this. It's a movie about imaginary friends. It's also helping kids cope with growing up and stuff like that.' And I said 'If you want to do it, great.' I've never had quicker yeses in my life.\"\n\n04 of 21\n\nSteve Carell as Blue\n\nThe new film features a sweet The Office reunion between Krasinski and Steve Carell, as the latter voices the character Blue, a creature who helps Cal and Bea with their quest. “Blue is played by Steve Carell who happens to be a dear friend,” Krasinksi said of his former costar in a behind-the-scenes clip.\n\n\"Oh my God, The Office reunion we've all been waiting for is in it,\" Krasinski told Entertainment Weekly of the film. \"The truth is, Steve's one of the most talented people on the planet. So whether I had ever worked with him before or not, I would've been gunning for him because I just had his voice in my head when I was writing Blue.\"\n\n05 of 21\n\nPhoebe Waller-Bridge as Blossom\n\nAfter making audiences laugh with her starring role on Fleabag, which she also created, Phoebe Waller-Bridge lends her voice to Blossom, a butterfly creature who was previously the imaginary friend of Bea’s grandmother.\n\n06 of 21\n\nLouis Gossett Jr. as Lewis\n\nThe late Hollywood legend Louis Gossett Jr. voices Lewis, an elderly teddy bear. The film marks one of his final roles following his death in March 2024 at age 87.\n\nThe actor had an illustrious career that spanned film, TV and Broadway. His most notable roles included Roots and An Officer and a Gentleman, the latter of which earned him an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor — making him the first Black performer to win the Supporting Actor Oscar.\n\n07 of 21\n\nEmily Blunt as Unicorn\n\nKrasinski turned IF into a family affair as his wife Emily Blunt voices the character Unicorn. Blunt recently showed her support for Krasinski as they stepped out for a date night at the film’s premiere. Similar to Reynolds sharing the screen with his wife Lively, Krasinski told PEOPLE that his children were excited to see Mom and Dad in a movie together. \"For our kids to have their mom in the movie too was so massive. It was a family affair,\" Krasinski said.\n\nWhile Blunt is well-known for her roles in The Devil Wears Prada, Mary Poppins Returns and recently Oppenheimer, this isn’t her first time sharing the screen with Krasinski. The two previously teamed up for A Quiet Place and its sequel A Quiet Place Part II, where they played a husband and wife raising their children in a post-apocalyptic world terrorized by aliens.\n\n08 of 21\n\nMatt Damon as Sunny\n\nMatt Damon voices the character of Sunny, a pretty flower. Damon was also in attendance at the IF premiere, calling Krasinski a “very good friend” as he spoke with ScreenSlam. “This movie has got so much of him in it and it’s got such a beautiful message,” he added, saying it was a “pleasure” working with him.\n\nWhile Damon is known for his action-packed films such as the Ocean's films and the Jason Bourne franchise, the father of four has taken on some light-hearted family films through the years, including We Bought a Zoo with Scarlett Johansson.\n\n09 of 21\n\nMaya Rudolph as Ally\n\nMaya Rudolph voices a character named Ally, who is a pink alligator. During the film’s premiere, she spoke with The Hollywood Reporter, saying that she would personally love to have Phoebe Waller-Bridge voice her own imaginary friend.\n\nAs a Saturday Night Live alumna, Rudolph is no stranger to making our sides ache with her funny characters.

Awkwafina has made a name for herself with her various funny roles, including Ocean's 8, Crazy Rich Asians and Awkwafina Is Nora from Queens, which she co-created and wrote, though she has shown off her dramatic chops with films like The Farewell, which earned her a Golden Globe.\n\nIn addition to her long list of acting roles, Awkwafina has done a ton of voice work, including Raya and the Last Dragon, The Little Mermaid, Migration and Kung Fu Panda 4, just to name a few.\n\n16 of 21\n\nBlake Lively as Octopuss\n\nBlake Lively joins her husband Reynolds on the screen as she voices Octopuss, who is shown to be a cat dressed up in an octopus costume.
