        "text": "Thanks @Paul154.\n\nYes I do think it helps a lot that I work in the industry as I know what can go wrong and what the price is for that noise, commotion etc. happening in my house and it is NOT the same as the AIrbnb room rate!\n\nI do get the impression from some of the requesters who got stroppy when I said I would not do it for Airbnb rates that some hosts are not aware of any of this and happily accept the booking for the nightly price thinking A. How exciting! My place is going to be in a photoshoot! and B. That's an easy way to make money (just like non-hosts often think hosting is making money without doing any work). WRONG!\n\nSo, that's what I'd like to hear from other hosts. Have you tried it? How did it work out for you? I'm very happy to give advice on the subject if anyone needs it. Apart from my industry knowledge, I learnt a lot from that one bad experience with the film students that has taught me to put down very firm guidelines and not let anyone cross them. So far, that seems to be working.\n\nThe last shoot was a couple of days ago with a small group of students from my former university. They paid for 2 x adults for 2 x nights to shoot here for under four hours and only used the bedroom. I laid down a very strict set of rules for them from the get-go and, as soon as they asked for something not previously agreed to, were told no straight away. I haven't received the review yet (if they leave one) so can't be 100% sure, but they seemed very, very grateful for being able to shoot here.\n\n@Paul154 @Huma0\n\nPaul,\n\nI'm sorry to say, but it doesn't seem you are properly attuned to the discussion raised by Huma. There is rather evidently a dissonance between your two voices.\n\nIndeed, it's an almighty chasm between what Huma speaks of, individual small projects of modest budgets; while you are fantasizing about Block Buster movies, as if Hollywood would come crawling at your door to offer you a measly 50 bucks while raking millions. Dream On!\n\nYou've clearly got an active imagination, but it seems you're projecting something unreal, or at least not based on experience.\n\nI've recounted some of mine, and that's starting from the same base as you, far from Huma's 'expertise', no experience whatsoever, but one that I was attracted to try when inquiries began. It was a big surprise, and as mentioned I consulted another Airbnb hostess in London who was well versed on the subject having been a Location Libary Manageress\n\n.\n\nI summarily believe that Huma's suggestion to Airbnb seems an excellent one, 'they are always launching new categories and this could be a good money maker for them'.\n\nIndeed, Airbnb has such a global array of properties in their portfolio, that would attract all comers, from the small to the large. So why not consider opening their own Location Library as a branch of their enterprise?\n\n@Alon1\n\nYou are right, we are talking about small project here. The ones I get contacted about via Airbnb are typically students, photographers looking to do a simple shoot, e.g. model portfolio shots, or someone launching a new, but small brand. I have never been contacted via Airbnb about a big production. Those people use the location agencies.\n\nI have had bigger production requests via the agency but, as I mentioned to you earlier, they have a real problem with Airbnb guests staying, so that didn't work out. It seems that sort of thing is only possible when you are not hosting or happen to not have guests staying.\n\nI also get adhoc enquiries from time to time by location scouts simply knockng on my door. One time this was for a full on feature film starring a famous actor that I am not too keen on, but they just wanted to shoot my front door and entrance hall. They were pretty serious and came back for a second visit but opted for another property. I did see them filming across the road some time later. For this sort of thing, I would easily expect to be paid over Â£1,000 a day, if not considerably more, but these are not the offers you get via Airbnb. Not yet, anyway...\n\n@Alon1\n\nAh yes, I do remember that listing quite clearly as it always popped up in highlights and articles etc. when I started hosting in my home. Having something unique like that is for sure a real pull for people wanting to do shoots.\n\nThe attraction of my place is that it has lots of period features (in a quite quirky, not totally typical way) and I guess also that I've put quite a lot of effort into the interior decoration. Plus, there are some good sized (but not massive) rooms.\n\nOf course, somewhere that has something unique or grand will always attract more enquiries, but film/TV production companies are always looking for various types of properties, from country piles to council estates, so you don't have to have something 'wow' to get the odd shoot here and there. It's more a matter of being out there on the platforms that people are looking on and I definitely get the impression that more professionals would be looking on AIrbnb if they had a category for hosts that are open to this.\n\n@Ian-And-Anne-Marie0 & @Huma0\n\n1) re. Paul's contribution\n\nWe are all virtual strangers, meaning that outside of this global forum, few if any of us know each other personally.\n\nIndeed, I don't know Paul and therefore can't tell about 'his sense of humour'.\n\nHowever, in my interpretation of his comment, far from exercising his humour, it seemed to me that he rather offered a serious comment on a subject of which he has no experience, and therefore articulated nothing more than the product of his imagination.\n\nPaul did not reply to my comment, but if he did he may choose to confirm one way or the other.\n\n2) re: 'If AirBnb did a Location Library I'd expect the email ....'\n\nContrary to Paul, it seems you are trying to be funny! But I must confess that I find your expression of humour in this case a little frustrating and demeaning, because it does not seem to me that you have taken the time and effort to peruse the contribution of those who do have experience in this field.\n\nI need be more explicit as I note from your Profile biography that you are a Photographer. However, it does not appear that you have had any experience of letting your place via Airbnb to photographers or film makers. Please correct me if I'm wrong.\n\n-------\n\nFinally, then, how might Airbnb consider this venture?\n\nIn addition to what I've posted on this thread, I would just add that my listing states:\n\nRe 'EVENTS': PHOTO/FILM shoots (Please discuss terms).'\n\nre. Discuss Terms: On this thread I've stated the advice I received from the ex-Location Library manageress: 'to be firm but flexible in negotiating price for each individual project.'\n\nI wasn't so explicit to mention on this thread as I have done other places, that in fact, one can achieve considerably higher rates for this type of booking than nightly rates. Moreover, in a private message to Huma I quoted her the price range I've managed to achieve.\n\nHuma replied that she has achieved similar prices, perhaps even higher.\n\nIn sum, it seems Huma and myself are in agreement about the process of negotiation; that it might lead nowhere and be a waste of time; alternatively, one can potentially receive considerably more than nightly rates.\n\n[For me who does not do Instant Book, the process of Inquiry is normal, and conversion rate of Inquiry into Booking has remained remarkably consistent over 6 years at c. 35% .]\n\nConsequently, as we would like to promote the idea to Airbnb of Location Libraries, the question you raise is a pertinent one: how might Airbnb market it?\n\nAirbnb constantly request feedback and inform us that they take stock of our responses. Therefore, it's plausible that they may well understand that on the one hand set prices will be higher than nightly rates; and on the other hand, that it's more than likely that each project will be negotiated separately.\n\nIn short, my suggestion at least that Airbnb should consider to market the Location Library differently than their normal enterprise; and given the primary need for negotation, Instant Book would hardly work with this venture.\n\nIn any case, based on my experience (and it seems Huma and others as well), this could be a potentially lucrative branch of the Airbnb enterprise.\n\n@Alon1 You need a sense of humour injection, and since I 'perused' every post on this thread before commenting, your comment was in fact demeaning.\n\nYes, as a photographer for nearly 40 years I've been involved with location shoots both film and video and none of them have been the type which were inconspicuous. For that reason, communication with the location owner was paramount and negotiation of fees - involved.\n\nThe idea that Airbnb could cater for this is ludicrous.\n\nThe fees banded around here for location rates are appealing... Thats because those fees are obtained by agents understanding the market and the location being part of specialist location finding database specifically for the purpose. If you want to access those, join a specialist listing group who actively promote higher fees reflecting the value of the commodity which @Paul alludes to, and create your own location shoot website promoting your space. Taking negotiations away from Airbnb would be the way to get the rates and terms you want and is already what is happenning.\n\nWithout splitting hairs over contract negotiations and chasing 'AirBnb business development ideas' where it seems they are struggling in their mainstay of home sharing according to many posters on these forums 'hot air' on how best to perform a business shift is eactly that.\n\n\"If AirBnb did a Location Library I'd expect the email \" Dear Ian, A production crew booked a Barn Conversion near you for 23% less. To increase your bookings you might consider reducing your rates\". It's a fast race to the bottom. Lol.\"\n\nIt seems my previous post encapsulated all aspects of this post. Perceptive, factual and... was even humerous!\n\n@Ian-And-Anne-Marie0\n\nJust to clarify, the reason I posted the agency rates (and hopefully I was clear that this is what the agency charges and not what I charge for enquiries via Airbnb), was to show one of the reasons why I would never accept a nightly Airbnb rate for shoots. Some hosts may think they are doing well to get some shooting during the day and not staying overnight for that rate, but I would not.\n\nOf course you are right that it is highly unlikely to get those agency rates via Airbnb and I do not charge anything close to them to contacts that come via Airbnb. If they had that sort of budget, they would have a wealth of locations to choose from via agencies.\n\nThe reason I suggested that Airbnb considers this as a category (and I am aware that this might not be possible due to insurance purposes etc.) is that I get SO many shoot enquiries on here and I am sure I am not alone in that. Listing in that specific category would need to involve higher rates than the guest rates and a different set of house rules etc. I agree also that instant book would not be possible. The person making the request/enquiry would need to fill in different details from a guest.\n\nPerhaps it's pie in the sky thinking, but it would be good to be able to direct those enquiries via a structured system rather than having to explain to (most) of them that they cannot hire a location for a nightly guest rate and that particular rules apply."
