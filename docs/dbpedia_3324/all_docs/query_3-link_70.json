        "text": "Paramount Pictures is bringing Bob Marley's story to life with Bob Marley: One Love.\n\nStarring Kingsley Ben-Adir as the legendary Jamaican reggae singer, the film tells the story of his rise to fame in the mid-1970s until he died in 1981.\n\nWhile the film features many notable people from Marley's life, there were also quite a few of them involved behind the scenes, including two of his children, Ziggy and Cedella Marley, who served as producers and his widow Rita Marley, whom he was married to from 1966 to 1981.\n\n“The authenticity of the Jamaican element of this is something never before seen in a Hollywood production of this size. This movie is a real representation of Jamaica and of Bob and of the creation of his music,\" Ziggy told Paramount Pictures of the film. \"We have approached this as a creative project, not an emotional thing. My emotions are beyond this. It’s about showing the truth.”\n\nAhead, see the cast side by side with the real people they play.\n\n01 of 11\n\nKingsley Ben-Adir as Bob Marley\n\nKingsley Ben-Adir stars as Jamaican singer Bob Marley in the new film, which the actor says was a \"dream role.\" Additionally, Quan-Dajai Henrique stars as teenage Bob Marley, while Nolan Collignon portrays a young Bob Marley in the film.\n\nSpeaking with PEOPLE, Ben-Adir revealed he prepped for the role while filming Barbie, including learning how to play the guitar and studying the musician’s Jamaican accent and Patois language on set.\n\nDuring a Dotdash Meredith Special Screening of Bob Marley: One Love in New York City on Feb. 12, the actor reflected on Marley's inspiring work ethic, telling PEOPLE, \"[It was] something I haven't heard or seen of. This is a man who is dedicated to his craft in a way that any other artist can only dream of working as hard as he did at.\"\n\n02 of 11\n\nLashana Lynch as Rita Marley\n\nThe Marvels actress Lashana Lynch plays Rita Marley, Bob Marley's wife at the time of his death.

I’d heard rumors,” Barrett Jr. told Paramount Pictures about how his role came about. “But I knew this was serious when I got a call from Cedella Marley. She said, ‘What do you think about acting?’ I said, ‘I never acted before.’ She said, ‘Well, we’re doing a movie. And we want you to play your father.’ I said, ‘Alright, no problem.’ I got the greenlight from her, so I just got on with it.”\n\nHe added that it was particularly special continuing his father's legacy following his death in February 2024. “If you really think about this mission a lot of souls have now gone, so it’s been very spiritual,\" he continued. \"The whole experience has been mystical. I can feel Uncle Bob. I can feel everybody. Even though my father isn’t here [on set], I still feel him in spirit. It’s emotional, when you’re shooting scenes, to see the struggles they came through. It’s given us so much more knowledge and understanding [of our fathers].”\n\n06 of 11\n\nDavid Davo Kerr as Junior Marvin\n\nDavid Davo Kerr is also portraying his father in the film — Junior Marvin, who was the guitarist for Bob Marley and The Wailers. “What makes this film so special is that not only are we, Bob’s offspring, involved, but there are also the offspring of other musicians involved too,” Ziggy Marley told Paramount Pictures.\n\n“We have Family Man’s son, who is also a bass player, and he’s [playing] Family Man in our movie. We have Junior Marvin’s son on guitar. He’s playing Junior Marvin,\" he continued. \"The guys are real. Nobody is faking it. Them is a part of this. It’s a good lineup, this thing.”\n\nKerr told Paramount Pictures it was a \"dream come true\" to play his father. \"I’ve always been into acting because of my dad,\" he said. \"He always had a camera. At home, we would do little home videos. And I did Drama growing up. But what makes this special is that I get to relive what he did,\"\n\n07 of 11\n\nAnna-Sharé Blake as Judy Mowatt\n\nAnna-Sharé Blake (known professionally as Sevana) plays Judy Mowatt, who was a member of the I Threes, the backing vocalists for Bob Marley and the Wailers.\n\n08 of 11\n\nNaomi Cowan as Marcia Griffiths\n\nNaomi Cowan plays Marcia Griffiths, who was a member of the I Threes from 1974 to 1981. Cowan, who is the daughter of gospel artist Carlene Davis and reggae singer and producer Tommy Cowan, found herself instantly connected to the sons of the real-life Wailers.\n\nRecalling their first meeting, she told Paramount Pictures, “We immediately all clocked that our dads worked together, which is so special. I’d never met any of them, but we clicked on the spot because we had similar experiences growing up. And I think we all also saw ourselves as carrying a heavy mantle — one that we were all honored to carry.\"\n\n\"I’m so proud of those guys because they were so dedicated to ensuring that they were matching their dads’ energies,\" she continued. \"Not just getting the songs right but even playing and moving in the way that they did.”\n\n09 of 11\n\nHector Roots Lewis as Carly Barrett\n\nHector Roots Lewis plays Carly Barrett, a Jamaican musician best known for being the drummer for Bob Marley and the Wailers.\n\nTalking with Paramount Pictures about the upcoming film and Marley's impact on pop culture, he explained, “I think this movie is going to show that Bob wrote for more than the people.\"\n\n\"He also wrote for an internal thing that he was trying to satisfy within himself,\" he added. \"Bob was more than just this rock star. He was an artist who was crying out to be healed. Crying out for the world to hear him, sharing something he loved.”\n\n10 of 11\n\nTosin Cole as Tyrone Downie\n\nTosin Cole plays Tyrone Downie, who served as the keyboardist and pianist for Bob Marley and The Wailers.\n\n11 of 11\n\nStefan A.
