        "text": "The Celluloid Ceiling: Employment of Behind-the-Scenes Women on Top Grossing U.S. Films in 2023\n\nIn Hollywood’s 2023 box office triumphs, Greta Gerwig’s Barbie took center stage. Yet, amidst the celebration, the 26th annual Celluloid Ceiling Report by Dr. Martha M. Lauzen reveals a stark disparity: women directors accounted for a mere 16% on the 250 top-grossing films, down from 18% in 2022, and 14% on the 100 top films, up from 11% in 2022. The Celluloid Ceiling Report unveils a disconcerting trend – 75% of top-grossing films featured 10 or more men in pivotal roles, while only 4% extended the same opportunities to women. Overall, women represented 22% of directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors, and cinematographers on the 250 top-grossing films, marking a 2 percentage point dip from 2022 and an overall increase of just 5 percentage points since 1998.\n\nIndie Women: Behind-the-Scenes Employment of Women in U.S. Independent Film, 2022-23\n\nFirst initiated in 2008, the Indie Women project monitors the employment of behind-the-scenes women working on films screening and/or streaming at 20 high-profile film festivals in the U.S. This report focuses on the representation of women working as directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors, and cinematographers on domestically and independently produced feature-length documentaries and narrative films selected by the festivals from July 2022 through June 2023. The report showed the amount of screened narratives directed by women remain the same: In 2022-23, the U.S. festivals studied streamed and/or screened an average of 7 narrative films directed by women compared to an average of 10 narrative films directed by men. This marks a slight improvement from 2021-22. The amount of screened docs directed by women rose: For the first time since women’s representation at festivals has been tracked, fests streamed and/or screened equal numbers of documentaries directed by women and men in 2022-23. This marks a slight improvement from 2021-22.

Lauzen, Ph.D., Founder/Executive Director, Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University. In the early months of this year (January through March), male reviewers outnumbered females by more than 2 to 1. Men comprised 69% (69.2%), women 31% (30.5%), and nonbinary individuals 0.3% of reviewers. In every job category, type of media outlet, and film genre, men’s voices dominate. In turn, the data shows that, on average, women reviewers award higher quantitative ratings to films with female protagonists than men reviewers, and that films directed by women comprise a larger proportion of reviews written by women than men. However, women’s underrepresentation as reviewers limits their ability to create a more level, more equitable, reviewing marketplace.

Even the pandemic didn’t disrupt entrenched gender ratios in film that heavily favor male characters to females. The percentages of females in speaking roles and as major characters declined slightly, while the percentage of films with female protagonists increased slightly. An astounding 85% of films featured more male than female characters, but only 7% of films had more female than male characters. In the second box office year impacted by the pandemic, females comprised 34% of all speaking characters, down 2 percentage points from 36% in 2020 but even with the percentage in 2019. In 2021, the most foundational gender stereotypes lingered.

After two consecutive years of increases in the percentage of women working as directors, their numbers declined in 2021. Women comprised 17% of directors working on the 250 top grossing films in 2021, down from 18% in 2020. The percentage of women working as directors on the top 100 films retreated from 16% in 2020 to 12% in 2021. Over 80% of films in 2021 were helmed by men. Overall, women accounted for 25% of those working in key behind-the-scenes roles (directors, writers, executive producers, producers, editors, cinematographers) in 2021, up from 23% in 2020. The rise in the overall percentage is due to increases in the percentages of women working as executive producers and producers.

The report found females comprised 52% of major characters appearing on streaming programs but 45% on broadcast network programs. Programs on streaming services also had substantially higher percentages of women working as creators, directors, and editors than broadcast programs. Women accounted for 30% of creators, 31% of directors, and 24% of editors on streaming programs but 22% of creators, 19% of directors, and 15% of editors on broadcast network programs. The study also found that programs with at least one woman creator featured more female characters in speaking and major roles than programs with exclusively male creators.

Among the top-grossing films dissected in the report, the study found that 17% of female API characters are verbally objectified, and 13.0% are visually objectified — a more common occurrence among API women than white women and other non-API women of color. API characters were also less likely to be shown in a relationship, with 83.3% of lead/co-lead/supporting API characters single, compared to 69.1% of white characters and 75.5% of non-API BIPOC characters.

The study was commissioned by ViacomCBS Networks International’s Race and Equity Taskforce, as part of Content for Change, a global ViacomCBS initiative that aims to counteract racism, bias, stereotypes, and hate through the company’s culture, creative supply chain, and ultimately the content it creates.

The report shines a light on the absence of Hispanic and Latino representation in the film industry. The results reveal that there is little for the Latino community to celebrate in popular films.

The number of women nominated for non-acting Primetime Emmys in 2021 decreased by 3% compared to 2020, according to a Women’s Media Center (WMC) analysis. Of the 2,337 people nominated for non-acting Primetime Emmys in 2021, 68% are men, while only 32% are women. ‘When nearly 7 of 10 nominees continue to be men, something needs to change,’ says WMC president. Since 2017 there has been a slow but steady increase in the number of women nominated for Emmys in non-acting categories. This is the first time since that defining moment that WMC’s annual analysis has shown a downturn.

Dr. Stacy L. Smith says, “Inclusion happens when women are given the keys to the kingdom.” This report demonstrates that Netflix takes its decision-making role seriously, is moving toward inclusion, and will continue to use data-driven metrics to ensure that its choices reflect the diversity of its audience and the talent that exists throughout the entertainment industry. The streamer is outpacing the industry in hiring women of color directors in films and series and have achieved gender equality in leading roles across our films and series.

Lauzen’s 2021 Report\n\nThis study tracks women’s behind-the-scenes employment on domestically and independently produced feature-length films streamed/screened at 20 high-profile festivals in the U.S. in 2020-21. Women accounted for 42% of individuals working as directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors, and cinematographers on documentaries versus 35% of those working on narrative features. Festivals screened an average of 6 narrative features directed by at least one woman versus an average of 9 narrative features directed exclusively by men. Films with at least one woman director had substantially higher percentages of women working as writers, editors, and cinematographers. The percentages of women working in other key behind-the-scenes roles more than doubled. First conducted in 2008, this study has examined over 95,400 credits on more than 9,500 films over the years.

This effort analyzes the representation of women in corporate America, provides an overview of HR policies and programs—including HR leaders’ sentiment on the most effective diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices—and explores the intersectional experiences of different groups of women at work. The data set this year reflects contributions from 423 participating organizations employing 12 million people and more than 65,000 people surveyed on their workplace experiences; in-depth interviews were also conducted with women of diverse identities, including women of color, LGBTQ+ women, and women with disabilities.

Lauzen Releases New 2021 Report\n\nAccording to the latest installment of It’s a Man’s (Celluloid) World, even in the atypical theatrical year that was 2020, it is worth examining the representation of females and males in film. The study considers the representation of female characters in the top 100 grossing films of 2020. The percentage of top-grossing films featuring female protagonists declined precipitously from 40% in 2019 to 29% in 2020. The representation of women as major characters and speaking characters increased slightly last year, with females accounting for 38% of major characters. Due to the interruption caused by Covid-19, the DEG’s “Watched at Home” list from March through December 2020 was compared to the top 100 list as a check that the top 100 films reflect the films that were most viewed.

The in-depth report seeks to answer one main question: Is film producing a sustainable career, as it exists today? Dear Producer has attempted to take a snapshot of who makes up the producing community and what life is like for feature-length film producers working in the fiction and/or documentary space in 2020. The goal was to gather benchmark data on the state of independent film producing in the United States. The secondary goal was to use this data to advocate for producers in areas they identified as most important.

Of the 773 series regular characters scheduled to appear on broadcast scripted primetime television this season, 70 (9.1 percent) are LGBTQ. This is a decrease from the previous year’s record-high percentage of 10.2 percent, and the first season to see a decrease since the 2013-14 report.

Women comprised 18% of directors working on the top 250 (domestic) grossing features in 2020, up from 13% in 2019 and 8% in 2018. Women accounted for 16% of directors working on the top 100 films, up from 12% in 2019 and 4% in 2018. The good news is that these figures represent two consecutive years of growth and recent historic highs. The bad news is that fully 80% of top films still do not have women at the helm. In 2020, the majority of films (67%) employed 0 to 4 women in the roles considered (directors, writers, executive producers, producers, editors, cinematographers), 24% employed 5 to 9 women, and 9% employed 10 or more women. The majority of films employed fewer than 5 women and 10 or more men in these key roles.

Since 1998, the annual Celluloid Ceiling report has tracked women’s employment as directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors, and cinematographers working on the top 250 grossing films. Several big-budget films originally slated for release in the 2020 pre-pandemic world — including Cathy Yan’s Birds of Prey, Niki Caro’s Mulan, Patty Jenkins’s Wonder Woman 1984, Chloe Zhao’s the Eternals, and Cate Shortland’s Black Widow — promised to generate momentum for the issue of gender inclusion in the mainstream film industry this year. Some industry observers predicted 2020 would mark a turning point in women’s employment. The long view provided by The Celluloid Ceiling suggests that evolutionary change is more likely than a revolutionary shift.

A new study from Dr. Martha M. Lauzen, of the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film, has found that women represented 38 percent of directors on indie features and docs selected for major fests in 2019-2020, and 35 percent of writers. This bests last’s year’s numbers — also historic highs of 33% and 32%, respectively. “We have now seen gains over the last two consecutive years for women working as directors, writers, and producers in independent film,” Lauzen said. “The percentage of women working as directors on narrative films has more than doubled over the last decade, rising from 15% in 2008-09 to 33% in 2019-20.” There is, however, plenty of room for improvement. Overall, women make up just 34 percent of all directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors, and cinematographers, and men 66 percent. Across the films considered for the study, women tended to fare better in documentary than in narrative features. Women filled 40 percent of key behind-the-scenes roles on docs, but only 29 percent on narratives.

Streaming services also saw new records of women working as creators, directors, writers, executive producers, producers, editors, and DPs last season. The study examines the representation of females on screen and employment of women behind the scenes on broadcast, cable, and streaming television programs. Women made up 35 percent of streaming shows’ creators, directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors, and directors of photography. They comprised 31 percent of those roles on cable programs and 30 percent on broadcast. Now in its 23rd year, the project provides the most comprehensive historical record of women’s portrayals and employment in television available.

First conducted in 2007, Thumbs Down is the most comprehensive and longest-running study of women’s representation and impact as film reviewers available. The study finds that, before the pandemic shuttered movie theatres in the U.S. last spring, “male film reviewers outnumbered their female counterparts by nearly 2 to 1.” In the opening months of 2020, men comprised 65% and women 35% of print, broadcast, and online film reviewers in the U.S. More than twice as many of the films reviewed by female critics as male critics are directed by women. The overrepresentation of men as film reviewers coupled with the fact that a higher proportion of their reviews focus on male-driven stories and films directed by men advantage these films by lending them greater visibility in the critical marketplace.

The report provides a deeper dive into the ecosystem surrounding popular films. The report also provides insight into the percentage of directors from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups and looks specifically at women of color working as directors. For the first time in over a decade, the number and percentage of women working as directors has increased.

The overall percentage of female nominees in those categories rose by just 5 percentage points, from 25 percent last year to 30 percent this year, compared to 70 percent for male nominees. Gender parity in the movie industry got a boost in 2019. Women wrote and directed more profitable and critically acclaimed films than ever before, and more women had significant roles behind the camera as well. Yet that shift was not reflected in the Oscar nominations.

At the beginning of 2020, before the Covid-19 pandemic began in the United States, the representation of women in corporate America was slowly trending in the right direction. This was most pronounced in senior management: Between 2015 and 2020, the share of women grew from 23 to 28 percent in SVP roles—and from 17 to 21 percent in the C-suite. Women remained dramatically underrepresented, particularly women of color, but the numbers were slowly improving.

Their analysis shows that there is some correlation between the representation of demographic cohorts on screen and their share of the total audience to a particular film. There is a clear opportunity for more films, aimed at a younger audience, to diversify the characters represented on screen considering the power media has on influencing values and thoughts, especially children. They also found that ultimately the industry will succeed if there is more on-screen representation because there is a ready and waiting audience.

Lauzen Releases New 2019 Report\n\nWomen made “unprecedented gains” as protagonists in the top-grossing films of 2019, according to the latest installment of It’s a Man’s (Celluloid) World, an annual report out of San Diego State University and The Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film, led by Dr. Martha M. Lauzen, which found that women achieved “recent historic highs” as lead characters in last year’s biggest hits. In 2019, women accounted for 37% of major characters. This represents an increase of 1 percentage point from 36% in 2018. Men comprised 63% of major characters. Women made unprecedented gains as protagonists in 2019. The percentage of films featuring female protagonists jumped from 31% in 2018 to 40% in 2019, reaching a recent historic high. 43% of films featured male protagonists, and 17% had ensembles. Last year, 45% of female protagonists appeared in studio features and 55% appeared in independent features. This marks a shift from 2018 when females were more than twice as likely to appear in independent features as studio features (68% vs. 32%).

Dr. Martha Lauzen and the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film have released The Celluloid Ceiling: Behind-the-Scenes Employment of Women on the Top 100, 250, and 500 Films of 2019, and its findings once again show how progress has been made off-screen in terms of gender equality. Women comprised 20% of all directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors, and cinematographers working on the top 100 (domestic) grossing films of 2019, up from 16% in 2018. Women accounted for 21% of individuals in these roles on the top 250 films, up slightly from 20% in 2018. Women made up 12% of directors working on the top 100 grossing films in 2019, up from 4% in 2018 (and 8% in 2017), and 13% on the top 250 films, up from 8% in 2018 (and 11% in 2017). These figures represent recent historic highs. However, the percentage of women working as directors on the top 500 films declined slightly from 15% in 2018 to 14% in 2019.

In the newest update of the Inclusion in the Director’s Chair Report run by the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative and led by Dr. Stacy L. Smith, we see multiple new statistics involving inclusion and diversity that are worth paying attention to. While of course, there are still plenty of strides to be made, the report reminds us to celebrate the accomplishments women have made thus far. The report, released on Tuesday, December 31, 2019, revealed 10.6% of the directors of 2019’s top movies were women. This marks a watershed moment as it is the highest percentage of female directors in the top films in 13 years. The study examined the presence of female directors working across the 1,300 top-grossing films from 2007 to 2019. The findings found that 12 women each directed one of the 100 top films in 2019. While the overall percentage of female directors across the 13-year time frame remains 4.8%, 2019’s number was the highest across the years examined.

The study examines dramas, comedies, and reality programs appearing on the broadcast networks, basic and premium cable channels, and streaming services. In 2018-19, the percentages of female characters on screen and women working in key roles behind the scenes increased on television. Across broadcast, cable, and streaming platforms, female characters comprised 45% of all speaking characters, up from 40% in 2017-18. Behind the scenes, women accounted for 31% of all creators, directors, writers, executive producers, producers, editors, and directors of photography.

Smith and the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative in partnership with National Association of Latino Independent Producers (NALIP) and Wise Entertainment called “Latinos in Film: Erasure On Screen & Behind the Camera”, research proves that Hollywood has failed the Latinx community when it comes to their portrayal in popular movies. According to the study, women represented 49% of the leads or co-leads. However, 5 of those 17 roles went to only one female actress (Cameron Diaz). Only 4.5% of all 47,268 speaking or named characters across the last 12 years were Latinx, as were a mere 3% of lead or co-lead actors. This is not reflective of the size and impact of the Latinx community as 77% of U.S. states and territories have a population of Latinos greater than the percentage seen in Hollywood films.

Titled SUPERPOWERING WOMEN in Science Fiction and Superhero Film: A 10-Year Investigation, this study is the second in a series of studies from Women’s Media Center in collaboration with BBC America highlighting the importance of representation. The past five years have seen “some improvement,” with females leading or co-leading 53 percent of superhero/sci-fi films, as compared to 2009-2013’s 36 percent. However, overall, 47 percent of the last five years’ films have featured solo male leads.

This study examines the state of inclusion for women in the animation business and is the first-ever investigation of its kind. In the past 12 years, only 3% of directors for animated movies were women, and just one, Kung Fu Panda 2’s Jennifer Yuh Nelson, was a woman of color. In addition, only 17% of the 120 top-grossing animated films from 2007 to 2018 had a female lead or co-lead, and just three of those movies boasted a woman of color as its protagonist.

The study “WGAW Inclusion Report Card 2017-2018 TV Staffing Season” reports that between 2017-2018 there were 2,985 jobs staffed by writers for TV. And despite the U.S. population being 51% women, only 36% of TV writers jobs are held by women. The gap is even more expansive for people of color, who make up 39% of the U.S. population but only hold 27% of TV writer jobs. And for the 56.7 million Americans who identify as disabled, less than 1% make up all TV writers.

Within the study as a whole, researchers discovered that male leads outnumber female leads two to one. Half of movie-goers are women and 51% of women populate the U.S., yet male characters in family films constitute 71.3% of leading roles. There has been a slight increase of female protagonists within the ten-year study with 30.1% of leads in 2017 compared to 23.8% from 2007.

The study examines leading and co-leading roles in the top 100 grossing movies of 2018 (as well as those from the preceding 11 years for comparison), in order to provide a glimpse of the breakdowns of leading characters in terms of gender and race/ethnicity. The study found that a total of 40 films featured a female lead or co-lead out of the top 100 in 2018, which represents an increase in 8 % from 2017 and 20 percent from 2007. Though this is the highest number of female-led films in the 12 years studied, the percentage is still notably lower than that of the female population of the United States (51%) and that of women who buy tickets to see movies in theaters (50%). Films featuring people of color in leading roles also saw gains this year, with a total of 28 films with an underrepresented lead or co-lead (up 7% from 2017 and 15% from 2007).

Only one woman was nominated in Best Animated Feature Film and the two writing categories. This means 75% of non-acting Oscar Nominees are men. Compared to last years Academy Award nominations, the total number of women nominees in non-acting categories were down for Best Picture, Best Director, Original Screenplay, Editing, Cinematography, Production Design, and Animated Feature. Categories of Adapted Screenplay, Documentary Short, Original Score, and Original Song remain changeless with no women non-acting nominations for the past two years.

The good news: 16 black directors helmed the top 100 grossing films, the highest number by far in the report’s 12-year history. (The previous best was only 7 directors out of 100, back in 2007.) However, only one of the 16 black directors is female: Ava DuVernay. In fact, only 7 black women directors TOTAL have directed a top 100 film since the study began in 2007. The numbers for female directors in general remain dismal, staying flat at 4% across the top 1,200 films from 2007 and 2018. And of those female directors, the vast majority are white.

Despite recent high-profile breakthroughs (Ava Duvernay’s A Wrinkle in Time, Patty Jenkins’ Wonder Woman), the study of the top 250 films of 2018 at the domestic box office found that women comprised just 8% of the directors involved, down from 11% in 2017. The percentages of women directors also declined on the top 100 and 500 films. Overall, women comprised 20% of all directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors, and cinematographers. This represents an increase of two percentage points from 18% in 2017.

As the DGA warned in their report, change is frustratingly slow. Despite efforts at several networks to improve representation among directors, the percentage of African-American directors was unchanged from last year, at 13 percent. Asian-American directors directed 6 percent of episodes, a small tick from 5 percent a year earlier. And Latinos directed just 5 percent of episodes, also a slow climb from 4 percent last year. All told, directors of color helmed 24 percent of all episodes last season, up only 2 percentage points from the previous year. The largest gain came from women, and even that was a relatively small climb. In the 2017-2018 TV season, females directed 25 percent of all episodes — an increase of 4 percentage points from 21 percent last year.

Now in its 21st year, Boxed In study, sponsored by the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University and headed up by executive director Dr. Martha M. Lauzen, provides the most comprehensive historical record of women’s representation and employment in television available. Overall, the numbers are down this year. Females comprised 40% of all speaking characters on dramas, comedies, and reality programs appearing on the broadcast networks, premium and basic cable channels, and on streaming services. This represents a decline of 2 percentage points from 42% in 2016-17. 68% of programs featured casts with more male than female characters in 2017-18. 11% had ensembles with equal numbers of female and male characters, and 21% featured casts with more female than male characters.

Categories like directing, producing, writing, and editing were particularly male-dominated, with WMC reporting that women represented a mere 6% of total directors this year (compared to last year’s 10%), 20% of editors, and 31% of producers.\n\nNew DGA Study Shows Improvement\n\nThe Directors Guild of America has been known to press studios, networks and producers to be more inclusive in hiring for nearly four decades. These efforts include collective bargaining gains that require studios to run TV director diversity programs, ongoing meeting with studios, networks and individual series regarding their hiring records, and publishing reports that detail employer hiring trends. The DGA recently released a study sharing that the pool of first-time episodic TV directors ‘is more inclusive than ever.’ This pool, which includes women and minorities, shows an encouraging employment gain, setting record highs for the second year in a row.

In fact, according to a new study from USC’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, there has been no significant statistical improvement in the representation of women, people of color, LGBT characters, or characters with disability in film over the last decade.The study is a hotbed of disappointing statistics—indicating that the fight to diversify the industry both in front of and behind the camera is an uphill battle. The report, Inequality in 1,100 Popular Films, draws from the top 100 movies each year from 2007–2017. It found that, although women make up roughly half the population, they represented just 31.8% of speaking characters last year.

Now in its second decade, the Thumbs Down: Film Critics and Gender, and Why it Matters study, sponsored by the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University and headed up by executive director Dr. Martha M. Lauzen, is the most comprehensive and longest-running study of women’s representation and impact as film reviewers available. One of their key findings immediately jumps out: male reviewers outnumber female reviewers 2 to 1. Some of the study’s other findings are particularly eye-opening, such as insights into the kind of films that other critics cover and the ways in which they write about them. Female film critics remain the minority in their field, but this latest look at the industry also finds that they are predominantly covering movies for and by women.

Female directors fared considerably better than in recent years — up in numbers by 100% compared with 2013. According to the report, 22 women directed 12.2% of all feature films last year that grossed more than $250,000 — double the number from five years ago. But as a percentage of the population, they’re still more underrepresented than minority directors.

Its new report, “Critic’s Choice?” finds that out of 19,559 reviews, 77.8% were written by men and 82% were written by white critics. White men wrote 63.9% of reviews, compared with 4.1% penned by women of color. More reviews were also written by white women (18.1%) than by men of color (13.8%).

In addition, the report found that sexual harassment and other forms of gender bias are prevalent in these professions. The new report — titled “’Script Girls,’ Secretaries and Stereotypes: Gender Pay Equity on Film and Television Crews” — represents a wide range of below-the-line craftspeople who work on movie and TV sets.

Now, following the TIME’S UP™ movement and actress Frances McDormand’s impassioned call at the 90th Academy Awards for the industry to embrace Inclusion Riders, NYFA’s updated Gender Inequality in Film infographic presents research on gender in film from 2007 to 2017, from more than 40 sources and scholarly studies. “With all that’s happening in the film industry, the New York Film Academy hopes to contribute what we can to the conversation with this infographic. It can be used as a reference and an educational tool to raise further awareness and inspire leaders within the entertainment industry, and beyond,” explains NYFA Chair of Documentary Andrea Swift. “It is an accessible way to interact with key information to support the movement to reach 50/50 by 2020.” See more.\n\nHollywood Diversity Report Says Minority Groups Still “Woefully Underrepresented”\n\nDespite the emergence of film and television series heralded for their diversity, such as Black Panther, Girls Trip, Atlanta and Black-ish, Darnell Hunt, sociologist and co-author of UCLA’s 2018 Hollywood Diversity Report, maintains little has changed both in front of and behind the camera. Hunt highlighted key trends of the five-year study that took place from 2012 to 2016, specifying how, despite the annual steady increase of the national minority population, representation in Hollywood remains disproportionate. The study, titled “Five Years of Progress and Missed Opportunities,” focused on 11 main arenas and their proportion of people of color and women in various film, broadcast, cable and digital sectors.

Men represent 77 percent of the nominees for behind-the-scenes roles, according to a report by the Women’s Media Center. The percentage of women barely inched up to 23 percent, from 20 percent last year, in the 19 major non-acting categories that feature writing, editing, producing, and directing roles.

This study examines the representation and portrayal of female characters in the 100 top grossing films every year. This latest edition considers portrayals in 2017. Last year, females comprised 24% of protagonists in the 100 top grossing films, 37% of major characters, and 34% of all speaking characters (major and minor). This represents a decline of 5 percentage points from 29% in 2016. Read the study.\n\nCelluloid Ceiling 2017 Report Shows Increase in Women Behind-the-Scenes Has Stagnated\n\nThe Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University released their 2017 Celluloid Ceiling Report, a quantified study on the employment of women behind the scenes on the top 100, 250 and 500 domestic films of the year. The findings were not exactly inspiring: in fact, the study provided evidence that the increase in women working in film as directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors, and cinematographers has actually stagnated. In 1998, women accounted for 17% of the above positions in the top 250 films, and in 2017 they still only accounted for 18%. There was an increase this year in the amount of women directing the top 250 films, going from 7% in 2016 up to 11%. But, that increase only puts us back on par with the year 2000, when women also accounted for 11% of top directors. In short, in the span of two decades, there were no significant losses or gains in terms of female employment in key roles on the top 250 films.

The DGA’s annual report on the subject analyzed an all-time high of nearly 4,500 episodes produced in the 2016-2017 television\n\nseason, up from 4,061 episodes in the prior season. Summary of Findings: a) Employer Hiring of Women and Minority Directors Up in Record 2016-2017 TV Season and b) Results Mixed By Studio; Netflix Trailed Behind, Twentieth Century Fox Led the Way. Ethnic and gender diversity among episodic television directors continued to increase this past season, the Directors Guild of America reported today, with the percentage of episodes directed by ethnic minorities rising by 3 percentage points to a record 22% of all episodes, while the percentage directed by women went up 4 points to 21% of all episodes, another all-time high.

Written by Dr. Darnell Hunt, Dean of Social Sciences at UCLA and author of six iterations of the WGA’s “Hollywood Writers Report,” the study concluded that television networks and streaming companies are systematically “excluding or isolating Black writers in writers’ rooms and in the creative process…The ultimate result of this exclusion is the widespread reliance on Black stereotypes to drive Black character portrayals.” Read the full study.\n\nGLAAD Study Finds Fewer Women & Black Characters on TV\n\nThe Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) Entertainment Media Team released its annual “Where We Are on TV” study in October 2017. The Team not only works with entertainment-related media platforms to encourage fair, accurate, and inclusive representation of LGBTQ people, but also to combat problematic content and instances of defamation in these industries. The study concluded that “women and people of color still struggle for representation.” The amount of female series regulars on primetime scripted broadcast series has increased by roughly 1% but one of the largest underrepresented groups is still black women. There 69 female characters versus 111 male characters of color on these series and ultimately, there are still voices that need to be heard.

Written by Lois Spier Gray, Maria Figueroa and Jacob Barnes, the study aimed to identify challenges to the state’s arts and entertainment workforce, particularly when it comes to job security. The study concluded what many women working in film in NYC already know: “workers in the New York State arts & entertainment industry continue to face high rates of contingent and project-based employment, low average income, and inadequate employment protections,” inhibiting individual financial growth and thus the artist’s economic contribution to the state. New York artists and entertainers are three times as likely to be self-employed as the total state workforce. The prevalence of short-term work or self-employment within the New York arts and entertainment community combined with inadequate labor protections also increases the risk for wage theft and abuse of employees. And, the authors noted, the industry unfairly relies on unpaid internships and volunteer work done for experience, as opposed to paid entry-level work. All these factors together create an industry where workers have little to no social safety net.

This is a large jump from last season, when only 38 first-time TV directors (24% of all first-timers) were women. There was also a marked increase in the amount of minority female first-time directors hired this season, rising from 6 in 2015-16 to 18 this season. The DGA reported that along with the increase in the proportion of women in the first-time director pool, the pool itself had expanded to match the explosion of episodic television series, thanks to online streaming. So, even though their proportion went down, the overall number of white men hired as first-time directors actually increased this year.

Lauzen’s Boxed In has tracked women’s representation in prime-time television. The project provides the most comprehensive historical record of women’s on-screen portrayals and behind-the-scenes employment available. The study examines dramas, comedies, and reality programs appearing on the broadcast networks, basic and premium cable channels, and streaming services. In 2016-17, women made modest but pervasive gains on screen and behind the scenes in television. The percentages of female characters increased slightly on broadcast network, cable, and streaming programs, and the percentages of women working in powerful behind-the-scenes roles increased slightly on cable and streaming programs. The findings indicate that streaming programs have now surpassed broadcast programs in terms of gender diversity, on screen and behind the scenes. This is especially interesting in light of Shonda Rhimes’ recent move from ABC to Netflix.

Working with Professor Shrikanth Narayanan in the Department of Computer Science, four doctoral students quantified specific tone and sophistication of language with reference to three groups: gender, race, and age. They examined the language of 7,000 characters in over 53,000 dialogues in almost 1,000 scripts by logging the content and sophistication of a character’s language, as well as their interactions with gender, race, and age. One of the major goals of the study was to determine the extent to which female characters were essential to the plot of a given film.

Smith and the Media, Diversity & Social Change (MDSC) Initiative at USC Annenberg announced their newest study, entitled Inequality in 900 Popular Films. The study, released July 31, 2017, reveals how little top-grossing movies have changed when it comes to the on screen prevalence and portrayal of females, underrepresented racial/ethnic groups, the LGBT community, and individuals with disabilities. The study is the largest and most comprehensive intersectional analysis of characters in motion picture content to date. A few key takeaways from the investigation of 900 top films from 2007 to 2016 (excluding 2011) and 39,788 characters: less than one-third of speaking characters on screen from all 9 years were girls/women, including just 31.4% of characters in the 100 top movies of 2016; characters from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups were 29.2% of all characters in the top-grossing films of 2016, which is not different from 2015; LGBT-identified characters represented 1.1% of all speaking characters, a percentage not different from 2015; and characters with disabilities filled only 2.7% of all speaking roles, which is not different from last year.

Lauren, Executive Director of the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film, has published the latest Women in Independent Film report. Women in Independent Film is the most comprehensive study of women’s behind-the-scenes employment on independent films available. The study considers 10,943 credits on 1,472 films in 2016-17, and over 59,000 credits on more than 6,000 films over the period of 2008 to 2017.

The Status of Women in the U.S. Media 2017 states that in the 250 top-grossing domestic films of 2015-16, only 17% of all directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors and cinematographers combined were female. That rate was 2 percentage points lower than that of 2014-15 and equal to 1998. The study also takes an in-depth look at related fields including TV network news; traditional print and online-only journalism; sports journalism; radio, television and multi-platform journalism; tech, social media and gaming; and more. Importantly, the WMC also offers a roadmap with guidance for media leaders looking to cultivate parity. Men still dominate media across all platforms—television, newspapers, online and wires—with change coming only incrementally. Women are not equal partners in telling the story, nor are they equal partners in sourcing and interpreting what and who is important in the story.

L. Max Nikias Chair in Engineering, and his SAIL Laboratory, to create the Geena Davis Inclusion Quotient (GD-IQ), to create a new software that can measure how long we see and hear women on screen. The GD-IQ scans a film in real time, distinguishing the gender of every person on screen and measures to a fraction of a second how long each person spoke and how long they were on screen for, and then separate this information based on gender. Furthermore, the GD-IQ utilizes the emerging form of programing known as “machine learning,” in which the software learns to perform this action with ever increasing precision over time, in order to insure the precision of the research the software produces.

In the US, the percentages of women that succeed in various entertainment professions are the same as in Canada and other parts of the world: women have more advancement opportunities when they are working on television dramas; on OTT streaming television media such as Netflix; and when they work as writers (more so than as directors) in all types of media. However, even in the most gender-balanced fields, women never make up more than 30% of the profession.

Women were not nominated at all for director, cinematography, or original screenplay. In the last decade women were only recognized in 19 percent of all non-acting Oscar nominations. Nine of the producers nominated for best picture were women – which is the largest number of women represented in any single category. Women also made up almost 75 percent of the costume design nominations.

According to the study, called “It’s a Man’s (Celluloid) World” written by Dr. Martha Lauzen, women comprised 29% of protagonists in the 100 top-grossing films of 2016. This figure represents a recent historical high, and a 7% increase from 2015. Female actors accounted for 37% of major characters, a 3% increase from 2015. The percentage of female characters in speaking roles (both major and minor) stayed basically the same, at 32%, only a 1% decrease from 2015. Read the study.\n\nThe Celluloid Ceiling: Behind-the-Scenes Employment of Women on the Top 100, 250, and 500 Films of 2016\n\nIn 2016, women comprised 17% of all directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors, and cinematographers working on the top 250 domestic grossing films. This represents a decline of 2 percentage points from last year and is even with the percentage achieved in 1998. Women accounted for 7% of directors, down 2 percentage points from 9% in 2015 and 1998. Last year, 92% of films had no female directors. In other roles, women comprised 13% of writers, 17% of executive producers, 24% of producers, 17% of editors, and 5% of cinematographers. The 2016 study also found that only 3% of composers working on the top 250 films were women. Read the report.\n\nWho Talks? Shows Women Analysts Missing from Primetime Convention Cable News Coverage\n\nGina Glantz, founder of GenderAvenger.com, Rutger’s University Center for American Women and Politics (CAWP) and the Women’s Media Center created a project called Who Talks? that monitors gender balance in election coverage. During the conventions, Who Talks? tracked daily coverage and found that when combining both conventions, CNN had the best showing of female analysts (including hosts, guests and substitute hosts) with just 37 percent, followed by MSNBC with 29 percent and FOX with 27 percent. Even as viewers witnessed history with the nomination of the first female presidential nominee, Who Talks? shows women analysts were missing from primetime convention cable news coverage during both the Republican and Democratic conventions. See the full study.\n\nThumbs Down 2016: Top Film Critics and Gender\n\nDr. Martha Lauzen, Executive Director of the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University, published a new study on film critics and gender. This report considers 5,776 reviews written by 247 “top critics” on the popular film review aggregator site, Rotten Tomatoes, during spring 2016 and examines the representation of women and men as film critics. In spring 2016, Dr. Lauzen’s study found that the majority of film critics were men. Women made up 27% while men made up 73% of Rotten Tomato “top critic” individuals. Men also outnumber women regardless of the job title category considered: men comprised 87% of contributors, 75% of freelancers, 74% of film critics, and 72% of individuals with other professional titles. Individuals writing about film for trade publications were made up of 80% men and 20% women. Similarly, men accounted for 71% while women accounted for 29% of those writing about film for large U.S. newspapers. Whether it’s the job title or the type of publication, the study shows that women are underrepresented as film critics.\n\nStudy of Gender & Emmy Nominations\n\nThe Women’s Media Center released a 10-year review of gender and Emmy Award nominations. Men continue to dominate in all behind-the-camera categories. See the infographic here.\n\nGender Inequality in the UK Film Industry\n\nA new study conducted by the Stephen Follows Film Data and Education Blog called Cut out of the Picture: A Study of Gender Equality amongst Film Directors in the UK Film Industry investigates the extreme disparities in jobs, opportunities, funding for women in the UK film industry. According to the study, from a total 2,591 films released between 2005 and 2014, inclusively made in the UK, just 13.6% of working film directors were women. In 2005, 11.3% of UK films had a female director but by 2014 this had only increased to 11.9%. As seen in the graph below, the article illustrates the lack of women in a number of creative positions- Of the main key head of department roles, only two had greater than 50% female representation with the rest ranging between 6% and 31%. In many film schools, the presence of male and female film studies are equal, but the disparity of roles grew from after graduation and in the following years in the industry.\n\nWhere Are The Women Directors? Report on Gender Equality in the European Film Industry\n\nA study conducted by the European Women’s Audiovisual Network (EWA) titled Where Are The Women Directors? Report on Gender Equality in the European Film Industry discusses the growing concern worldwide about the marginalization of female directors in our film culture and aims to provide evidence to inform policy change at a national and European level. The report calls for affirmative action to change the status quo, and based on the results of national reports covering the period 2006-2013, EWA proposes several policies for change around three key stages in women’s professional development. These three key stages being: preparing the ground in school education, encouraging women directors into the industry, and sustaining women’s careers through targeted strategies.\n\nWomen in Independent Film Report Shows Stagnation in Hiring\n\nThe Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University, led by Executive Director Dr. Martha Lauzen, has released a new study title “Women In Independent Film,” which demonstrates that though women directors fared better in the independent realm than with major studios this year, the percentage of women behind the camera is “stagnant.” According to the report, women account for 28% of all directors working in indie film during the past year, a five-point increase over 2014-15 and slightly below the historical high of 29% in 2011-12. Additionally, women make up 35% of documentary directors and 19% of narrative features.\n\nFilm Dialogue From 2,000 Screenplays Broken Down By Gender and Age\n\nA recent article from Polygraph entitled “Film Dialogue From 2,000 Screenplays Broken Down By Gender and Age” uses interactive infographics to confirm that Hollywood films are predominantly about white men using interactive infographics. The creators of this in-depth article wanted to compile more data to back up the rhetoric that most films feature white men and answers to questions like how many movies are actually about men? How do different genres, the film’s era, or box-office revenue influence representation? What circumstances help films achieve more diversity? Polygraph set about compiling the number of lines for male and female characters from approximately 2,000 different films’ screenplays. See the results.\n\nWMC Releases 10-Year Review of Oscar Nominations & Gender\n\nWomen’s Media Center has released a 10 year study of gender and Oscar nominations. From 2006-2015, nominations of women accounted for just 19% of all non-acting nominations (327 women compared to 1,387 men). The Oscars, awarded by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the largest and best-known organization of film professionals, offer prestige and high-profile recognition to their winners and their nominees. The lack of representation of women among Oscar nominees over the last decade both demonstrates and contributes to women’s under-representation in behind-the-scenes roles in film—particularly those with the greatest decision-making power.\n\nComprehensive Annenberg Report on Diversity (CARD)\n\nUSC Annenberg’s Media, Diversity, & Social Change Initiative released the Comprehensive Annenberg Report on Diversity (CARD), a groundbreaking study on inclusivity in entertainment. The study analyzes inclusion in front of and behind the camera at ten major media companies (Sony, CBS, Hulu, Amazon, 21st Century Fox, etc.), focusing on films from major studios released in 2014 and prime-time, first-run, scripted series on broadcast, cable, and premium channels, as well as streaming services, from September 2014-August 2015. In the end, 109 films and 305 broadcast, cable, and digital series were included. The emphasis was on speaking characters (role, demographics, domesticity, and sexuality); gender of directors and writers; race and ethnicity of directors; and gender of high level executives. The goal: to arm media businesses with information they can use to improve their casting and hiring processes. The study was authored by Stacy L. Smith, PhD, Marc Choueiti, and Katherine Pieper, PhD, with assistance from Ariana Case and Artur Tofan.\n\nIt’s a Man’s (Celluloid) World: Portrayals of Female Characters in the Top 100 Films of 2015\n\nIt’s a Man’s (Celluloid) World, Dr. Martha Lauzen’s latest study, analyzes women in the top 100 domestic grossing films of 2015. For this report, Lauzen focuses on the percentages of female and male characters, characters’ demographic traits, and the relationship between on-screen female representation and the representation of women involved behind the camera. Dr. Lauzen has found that only 22% of protagonists in the top 100 domestic grossing films were women. Only 33% of the speaking roles in the top 100 included women, and only 18% of antagonists were women. Lauzen has also found the ethnic and racial diversity of female characters has remained unchanged with 76% of all female characters being white, 13% black, 4% Latina, 3% Asian, 2% other worldly, and 2% other.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter‘s Film Studio Scorecard: How much diversity is there in the Big Six?\n\nIn the middle of ongoing pressure on the film industry to embrace gender and racial inclusion, The Hollywood Reporter has published a diversity scorecard for the decision-makers at the major studios. THR notes that women as a group are better represented than people of color among the listed executives. However, it is important to note that no woman leads a studio at the very top of the pyramid. And only two of the 17 female high profile decision makers who made the cut are women of color. Perhaps most egregiously, in a city where nearly half of the populace is Latino (47.5% according to a 2005-2009 survey), no Hispanics are represented in the scorecard.\n\nResearchers have found a major problem with The Little Mermaid and other Disney movies\n\nLinguists Carmen Fought and Karen Eisenhauer have been working on a project to analyze all the dialogue from the Disney princess franchise. The research, published recently on The Washington Post, demonstrates how films like The Little Mermaid represented a backward step in the princess genre.\n\n2015\n\nThe Women of Hollywood Speak Out\n\nThe New York Times Magazine recently published “The Women of Hollywood Speak Out,”which addresses the struggle it has been for women to create a name for themselves in the entertainment industry. The article, penned by Maureen Dowd, features interviews from several of the entertainment industry’s top woman directors, show runners and executives. Shonda Rhimes, Lena Dunham, and Kathleen Kennedy were a few of the women interviewed that weighed in on what seems to be the industry’s fear of having more women in charge.\n\nDGA Feature Film Diversity Report: Only 6.4% of Directors Are Women\n\nThe Directors Guild of America’s inaugural Feature Film Diversity Report, released December 9th, found that only 6.4% of feature film directors in 2013 and 2014 were women, and 1.3% were minority women. The study also found that the percentage of women directors was significantly lower for films that made over $10 million at the box office: below this marker, 11.6% of directors were women, and above, the percentage dropped to 3.1%.\n\nWomen and the Big Picture: Behind-the-Scenes Employment on the Top 700 Films of 2014\n\nDr. Martha Lauzen’s latest study, Women and the Big Picture, is the first study to track women’s behind-the-scenes employment on the top 700 theatrical released films (foreign films omitted) in a single year. The findings indicate that films with women directors (as well as those with at least one-third female executive producers and producers) employed substantially higher percentages of women in other key behind-the-scenes roles. For example, on films with female directors, women comprised 52% of writers. In contrast, on films with exclusively male directors, women accounted for just 8% of writers.\n\nSundance Institute & Women In Film LA Launch Female Filmmakers Initiative\n\nThis landmark study, authored by Cathy Schulman (President, Women in Film Los Angeles), Kirsten Schaffer (Executive Director, Women in Film Los Angeles), Keri Putnam (Executive Director, Sundance Institute) and Caroline Libresco (Director, Special Project & Senior Programmer, Sundance Institute) analyzes the obstacles facing women in American independent film. The third phase of this project uncovers how female directors fare after premiering at the Sundance Film Festival. The study concluded some interesting things: for example, the director gender gap is most noticeable in top-grossing films. Across 1,300 top-grossing films from 2002 to 2014, only 4.1 percent of all directors were female.\n\nWomen’s Media Center’s Emmy’s Gender Study Shows Lack in Women Nominees\n\nAfter concluding a 10-year gender study, the Women’s Media Center has found that women have received only 22% of the nominations for Primetime Emmy’s in writing, directing, producing and editing. At the most recent Emmy Awards, which aired on September 20, 2015, only 25% of nominees were women. WMC found that the problem stems from women not being hired for behind-the-scenes positions in the first place. Women must be present in the industry in order to be influential power players.\n\nBoxed In Study Shows Women Execs are Key to Female Hires\n\nDr. Martha Lauzen’s latest study of female employment in television reveals that when women are in charge, more women get hired within the industry. Lauzen, executive director of the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University, found that there is a correlation between shows that had a least one woman creator or exec producer and the level of female representation throughout the production. For example, During the 2014-15 season, 32% of writers were female on shows with a female exec producer, compared to 8% on shows with only male exec producers.\n\nDGA Study Tracks Diversity in Hiring of Episodic Directors\n\nA study conducted by the Directors Guild of America analyzing over 3,900 TV shows in the 2014-2015 season shows that women directors represented 16% of all episodic directors for broadcast, cable, and internet-based web series. The numbers show an overall positive trend, citing a 14% increase in women TV directors and a 20% year-over-year growth. This could be due, in part, to the increase of TV episodes aired over the past year; the 3,910 episodes produced yielded an increase in job opportunities for women and minorities alike.\n\nNew USC Study Finds Minimal Growth for Women Characters in Feature Films\n\nThe University of Southern California at Annenberg’s Media, Diversity, & Social Change Initiative has published a seven-year analysis of the gender, ethnic and sexual diversity of characters in feature films from 2007 through 2014. The study also examines people behind the camera, including content creators such as directors, producers, and writers, among others. This study is the most comprehensive analysis of diversity in recent popular films ever conducted, bringing together data assessing gender, race/ethnicity, and LGBT status in the top 100 movies of each year. The study reveals a complete picture of Hollywood’s indisputable bias against featuring females, people of color, and LGBT characters on screen.\n\nSundance Institute and Women in Film LA Unveil Groundbreaking Study on Women Directors\n\nSundance Institute and Women in Film Los Angeles, co-founders of the Female Filmmakers Initiative, unveiled Phase III of their groundbreaking study that reveals the barriers and opportunities in the careers of women narrative film directors after premiering a film at the Sundance Film Festival (SFF). The results from this study, authored by Dr. Stacy L. Smith of USC’s Annenberg School, demonstrate that women directors set out on a course that confirms and triggers a stereotype that may affect the deals they make and the opportunities they are offered.\n\nUCLA 2015 Hollywood Diversity Report: Flipping the Script\n\nA recent study by the Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies at UCLA finds that while an increasingly diverse TV, film and new media audience prefers diverse programming, women and minorities remain underrepresented both in front of and behind the camera.\n\n2015 WGA Report: Women, Minority and Older TV Writers Lose Traction\n\nThis study from the Writers Guild of America shows that employment for women, minority and older (over age 50) writers decreased in 2013-2014. Employment of women writers fell 5%, from 30.5% to 29%. While it is the showrunners and executive producers who do the majority of the hiring, it is the networks who hire the showrunners; minorities held only 5.5% of those jobs last season, down from 7.8% two years earlier. The lack of diversity at the beginning of the hiring process likely ensures the lack of diversity at the end of it.\n\n2014\n\nIt’s a Man’s (Celluloid) World: On-Screen Representations of Female Characters in the Top 100 Films of 2014\n\nBy Martha Lauzen\n\nThis study examines on-screen representations of female characters in the top 100 grossing films of 2014. The number of female protagonists in 2014 was actually 4 percentage points lower than it was in 2002. However, in films with at least one woman director and/or writer, female representation was slightly better. Still, female characters remained heavily stereotyped throughout.\n\n2014 Celluloid Ceiling Report\n\nBy Martha Lauzen\n\nThe results of this study drive home the point that men continue to construct the vast majority of the visual and aural worlds featured in U.S. films. Last year, women comprised 17% of individuals working as directors, writers, executive producers, producers, editors, and cinematographers on the top 250 (domestic) grossing films. In 2014, there were less female-directed films than in 1998.\n\nGender within Film Crews\n\nBy Stephen Follows\n\nA study of the gender split in the 2,000 highest grossing films (1994-2013) found that only 22.6% of all crew members were female. During the last 20 years, Tina Fey’s ‘Mean Girls’ had the highest percentage of women on its crew (42%).\n\nIndependent Women: Behind-the-Scenes Employment on Festival Films in 2013-14\n\nBy Martha M.

Men continue to dominate as film critics accounting for 78% of top critics and writing 82% of reviews.

Lauzen, PhD, Executive Director, Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film, SDSU\n\nThe study reveals that females comprised 33% of all characters in 2011, up from 28% in 2002. However, the percentage of female protagonists decreased from 16% in 2002 to 11% in 2011. Thus, while there are more female characters on screen today, fewer stories are told from a female character’s perspective. Further, female characters remain younger than their male counterparts and are more likely than males to have an identifiable marital status. The study also found that female characters are much less likely than males to be portrayed as leaders of any kind.

It wasn’t an original idea: 1992 had been popularly known as the year of the woman in politics, partly because of the number of new women elected to the Senate that year (4!) and the House (24!). Now the academy was joining the fun with the show “Oscar Celebrates Women and the Movies.” The host, Billy Crystal, rose to the occasion with quintessential Hollywood class. “Some of the most-talked-about women’s parts,” he joked, bada-boom, “are Sharon Stone’s in ‘Basic Instinct.” Full story.\n\n‘Fuck Them’: Times Critic On Hollywood, Women & Why Romantic Comedies Suck\n\nBy Irin Cameron, Jezebel, 12/14/2009\n\n“Two major studios, Paramount Pictures and Warner Brothers Pictures, didn’t release a single mov"
