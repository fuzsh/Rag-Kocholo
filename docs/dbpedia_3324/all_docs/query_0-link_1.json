He planned to have “La Liberté éclairant le monde” (“Liberty Enlightening the World”), later known as the “Statue of Liberty,” to be erected at this site. Returning to Paris, Bartholdi created models that were said to have “the face of his mother and the body of his mistress.” He was also inspired by Freemason iconography, and became a member of the organization during construction. When a full-sized model was complete, a wooden “honeycomb” mold was built to replicate the form, and copper plates were hammered into place. The work was financed by Laboulaye’s Franco-American Union with 600,000 francs donated by French commoners. Still, the structure was not engineered to stand upright. Builder Gustave Eiffel innovated an iron skeleton, supported by a center pylon, that could accommodate movement, expansion, and contraction. Meanwhile, Americans failed to make good on their promise to build the statue pedestal. The delay was attributed to a general mistrust of France, and suspicion of ulterior motives. Critics opposed the symbolism of femininity, and were troubled by a perceived homage to a “pagan goddess.” Despite American antagonism, the Statue of Liberty was disassembled and packed into 210 crates which set sail from Paris on 21 May 1885 aboard the Isère. After nearly capsizing on its way to New York City, the monument arrived unceremoniously, as construction on architect Richard Morris Hunt’s pedestal remained at a standstill. While the statue lingered in boxes for another year, publisher Joseph Pulitzer precipitated an outpouring of public support by printing the name and testimonial of every contributor to the pedestal fund, no matter how much money he or she donated. Gifts generally ranged well under $1, but the effort secured at least $100,000 to finance the pedestal’s completion. Twenty-one years after Édouard René Lefèbvre de Laboulaye conceived the project, and ten years after the American centennial, the Statue of Liberty was finally dedicated on 28 October 1886. At 305 feet, it was the tallest structure in America at that time. Despite the populist, democratic ideals embodied by the statue, the ceremony included only two women, and the speeches made no mention of the immigrants who were meant to see the monument upon their arrival to America. Over time, the symbol of liberty was both revered and commercialized. However, the promise of “freedom” remained a subject of contention for African Americans and migrants who were not always included in the promise of the “American Dream.”\n\nLess"
