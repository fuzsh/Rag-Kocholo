        "text": "Preview:\n\nParamount revealed a lot of news on future movies at its CinemaCon Presentation.\n\nOther movies highlighted included ‘Transformers One’ and ‘A Quiet Place: Day One’.\n\nRidley Scott’s ‘Gladiator 2’ provided the big finish.\n\nParamount had a solid if uninspiring 2023, including a disappointing result for the oft-delayed ‘Mission: Impossible –– Dead Reckoning Part 1’ (which suffered in competition, particularly for IMAX screens, against ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’). But’s best not to bet against Tom Cruise, who will no doubt be doing something to promote the next ‘Mission’ (odds are good we’ll learn the new title). Still, the more recent likes of ‘Mean Girls’ and ‘Bob Marley: One Love’ were reasons to be grateful, even as talk of the studio being up for sale continues to swirl.\n\nBeyond that, expect plenty of promotion for Ridley Scott’s ‘Gladiator II’, ‘A Quiet Place’ prequel ‘Day One’ and possibly the next ‘Transformers’ outing, animated prequel ‘Transformers One’.\n\nEven before the presentation proper kicked off, there was news of new movies in the works. The studio is developing a reboot of the ‘Scary Movie’ spoof franchise to shoot this year for release next year via Paramount’s Miramax subsidiary.\n\nAnd while a sequel to last year’s family friendly ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’ is moving forward, the company also intends to go in a more grown-up direction with a new live-action ‘Turtles’ offering called ‘The Last Ronin’ that will adapt a dark comic book tale set in a totalitarian New York where Shredder’s grandson has employed artificial ninjas to slaughter all but one of the Turtles. The lone survivor swears vengeance. So… yes, definitely a less kid-centric take on the characters, and one that feels even closer to the black and white origins of the story. That one will be produced by former DC movie boss Walter Hamada, who has a multi-year deal with Paramount and ‘Boy Kills World’ writer Tyler Burton Smith is on script duty.\n\nRelated Article: ‘The Fall Guy’, ‘Twisters’ and More Lead Universal’s CinemaCon Show\n\nAnd now, on with the show…\n\nAfter a glitch with the opening reel (effectively a tour of the Paramount lot), the presentation commenced with another highlighting Paramount’s considerable movie history and spotlighting successes such as ‘Sonic’, ‘Mean Girls’ and ‘TMNT: Mutant Mayhem’.\n\nAnd, as suspected, the world of ‘Gladiator’ is a focus, as Roman soldiers stride on to the stage to shepherd the executives. Will those who backed unsuccessful movies have to battle lions? Doubt it, but… would watch.\n\nFirst up to tout two very different movies is one John Krasinski, who is appearing via video from London. He talks first about…\n\n‘IF’\n\nAs Krasinski (who wrote and directed this one) explains, ‘IF’ posits a world where everything kinds imagine is real –– and some imaginary friends are looking to find their humans again (or be connected with new ones).\n\nIt has Ryan Reynolds starring, a stacked celebrity voice cast and leans heavily into the Pixar style of movie making.\n\nHe cues up the final trailer for the film, which you can see here:\n\n‘IF’ is in theaters May 17th.\n\nKrasinski also mentioned ‘A Quiet Place: Day One’, but more on that later…\n\nParamount Presentation: Other News\n\nIn between teases for this year’s releases, there were more news announcements, including confirmation of a ‘Transformers’ and ‘G.I. Joe’ crossover movie, Edgar Wright landing Glen Powell to star in his new take on Stephen King’s ‘The Running Man’, Ridley Scott officially boarding the Bee Gees musical biopic and Damien Chazelle seemingly handed a second chance after the floptastic ‘Babylon’, getting ready to shoot his next movie this year for the studio, with a release planned for 2025.\n\nAlso touted? ‘South Park’ duo Trey Parker and Matt Stone are working on a new, live-action comedy musical with Kendrick Lamar, which will debut on July 4 next year.\n\nWith the title very much back in the public consciousness thanks to the Netflix live-action show, Paramount has the likes of Dave Bautista and Eric Nam lending their voices to what is currently title ‘Aang: The Last Airbender’, with Bautista playing a villain. The movie will be in theaters on October 10th next year.\n\nThat was not the only voice cast confirmed for an upcoming movie. The new ‘Smurfs’ animated movie, which has Rhianna starring, will also see the tonsil talents of Nick Offerman, Natasha Lyonne, JP Karliak, Daniel Levy, Amy Sedaris, Nick Kroll, James Corden, Octavia Spencer, Hannah Waddingham, Sandra Oh, Alex Winter and more. Expect that one on February 15th next year.\n\nContinuing the animated theme, we learned that ‘The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants,’ will debut on December 19th, 2025\n\nIn fact, lots of future slate info dropped, including that the next ‘Star Trek’ movie (whichever it might be from the various options) and the new, Seth MacFarlane produced ‘Naked Gun’ with Liam Neeson starring, will both also arrive next year.\n\nOh, and if you, like us, had “next Mission movie title announcement” on your bingo card, no scratching it off –– there was a mention of it, but zero footage and no word on title.\n\nNow on to…\n\n‘Transformers One’\n\nThe animated ‘Transformers’ movie that follows a titanic battle on Cybertron has ‘Toy Story 4’s Josh Cooley in the director’s chair and Scarlett Johansson and Chris Hemsworth among its voice cast.\n\nFollowing a video introduction from Johansson, Hemsworth (who, if we’re honest, was already in Vegas because of the Warners presentation) arrived on stage to talk up the film. He voices Optimus Prime, with Brian Tyree Henry (who joined him at the event) as Megatron.\n\nFrom the looks of the footage, the tone is aiming for more of a family adventure style, leaning closer to comedy than the live-action/CG movies. And it’s an origin story for many of the characters we love, with Keegan-Michael Key voicing Bumblebee.\n\nAlong with a trailer, a first clip screened –– in 3D, no less –– to wide approval for its epic scale and comedy value.\n\nFind the title treatment below:\n\n‘Transformers One’ will be in theaters on September 13th.\n\nAnd we venture now to more of a terrifying place…\n\n‘A Quiet Place: Day One’\n\nStars Lupita Nyong’o and Joseph Quinn were on hand to debut an extended trailer for the thriller prequel showing how the scary creatures first arrived and began to terrorize New York. As the previous trailer hinted, this one will see devastation, fear and, ultimately… quiet.\n\n‘A Quiet Place: Day One’ heads to theaters on June 28th.\n\nSpeeding from there, we find…\n\n‘Sonic The Hedgehog 3’\n\nGiven that Sonic and pals have become one of the biggest recent franchises for the studio (even extending to the upcoming ‘Knuckles’ series), it’s almost surprising how low key the talk of the new movie was.\n\nThe studio team just showed a trailer, which went heavily on Jim Carrey’s villainous, maniacal Dr. Robotnik and introduced Shadow the Hedgehog.\n\n‘Sonic The Hedgehog 3’ is racing into theaters on December 20th.\n\nFrom that, we pivot back to scares…\n\n‘Smile 2’\n\nA follow-up to the 2022 horror sleeper hit, the new movie will see a Lady Gaga-esque pop star confronted by smile-affected people around a concert venue.\n\nStarring Naomi Scott, Kyle Gallner, Rosemarie DeWitt and more, it looked suitably creepy.\n\nThe ‘Smile’ sequel is aiming to scare up business on October 18th.\n\nAnd finally, Paramount’s big finish…\n\n‘Gladiator II’\n\nSir Ridley Scott appears on screen from London (where he’s still finishing post-production on the movie), to hype his return to the world of ‘Gladiator’.\n\nWe were also treated to an intro reel featuring stars Denzel Washington, Paul Mescal, Joseph Quinn, Connie Nielsen, and Pedro Pascal all raving about working with Scott and the scope and scale of the film.\n\nIt might be unfinished, but that didn’t stop Scott unleashing a five-minute look at the movie.\n\n“I remember that day. I never forgot it. That a slave could take revenge against an emperor,” says Paul Mescal’s Lucius. A boat battle is seen taking place in the Colosseum. Paul Mescal and other Gladiators fight vicious monkeys. “Rage is your gift,” Denzel Washington tells Mescal. Washington and Pedro Pascal watch on as Mescal fights a rhinoceros. The footage ends with a brutal fight between Pedro Pascal and Paul Mescal.\n\nAre we not entertained? Yes, we were entertained. Though animal rights activists and worried Pedro Pascal fans might think differently.\n\n‘Gladiator II’ returns to the theatrical arena on November 22nd.\n\nUpcoming Paramount Movies:\n\n'The Smurfs Musical' (2025)\n\n'The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants' (2025)\n\n'Untitled Naked Gun Reboot' (2025)\n\n'Untitled Bee Gees Biopic'\n\n'IF' (2024)\n\n'Transformers One' (2024)\n\n'A Quiet Place: Day One' (2024)\n\n'Sonic the Hedgehog 3' (2024)\n\n'Smile 2' (2024)\n\n'Gladiator II' (2024)"
