        "text": "Let’s turn the clock back a little over 10 years to Feb. 6, 2011. I was attending a Super Bowl party in Northeast Philadelphia, gorging myself on boneless chicken wings and French fries when one specific Big Game spot made me forget all about my plate of deep-fried food.\n\nIt was a teaser trailer for J.J. Abrams’ Super 8.\n\nThe use of James Horner’s “Through the Window”; the visual of a young boy walking through a field of long grass at dusk; and the words “from producer Steven Spielberg and director J.J. Abrams” captivated my imagination and stuck with me for the rest of the game. I no longer cared about who won the match or the smorgasbord of wings and fries — all I knew is that I couldn’t wait for it to be June so I could see this movie.\n\nAnd that’s exactly what I did four months later. As my junior year of high school wound to a close and the weather turned warm, my father and I went to see Super 8 at our local theater. We’ve watched plenty of movies together — before and since — but Super 8 stands out as a singularly unique experience.\n\nI can distinctly remember my dad, a child of the 1970s, leaning over again and again to nostalgically point out the multitude of references to his formative years (painting models or the Three Mile Island nuclear accident), while I reveled in the depiction of a youthful summer vacation.\n\nMy friends and I rode bikes together and got up to all sorts of hijinks around the neighborhood — just like the kids in the movie. The only difference is we never found ourselves at the center of a government conspiracy involving a telepathic alien.\n\nLike the classic Spielberg/Amblin projects it lovingly pays homage to (Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T., and The Goonies), Super 8 is a timeless piece of cinema that strikes a melodic chord across multiple generations. It’s a wholly original idea that reminds us of the magic of the blockbuster season.\n\n“Super 8 was both a tribute to and a film produced by Steven,” Abrams tells Forbes Entertainment. “So, it wasn't meant to be as much a send-up as it was intended to be part of the ‘Amblin canon.’ It was approached less as a look back, and more like a lost or forgotten volume in the Amblin library.”\n\n“We all got to hand pick the bikes we ride in the film and would ride them all around Bad Robot,” recalls cast member Elle Fanning. “Bikes are such a quintessential nod to Amblin films and movies of that era and we all felt how big of a deal it was to ride a bike in an Abrams/Spielberg film!”\n\nThe coming-of-age story about a group of young teens making a no-budget Super 8 zombie movie over the summer of 1979 — only for that humble production to get hijacked by the arrival of an extraterrestrial in their small Ohio town — checks all the proper boxes. The anxieties of growing up, the heartache of young love, the sorrow of broken families, and the wonder of what’s lurking out there in the night sky are core tenets straight out of the Spielberg playbook.\n\nRoger Ebert summed it up best in the introduction for his review of the film: “With its night skies filled with mystery, its kids racing around town on bicycles, and its flashlights forming visible beams in the air, Super 8 has the visual signatures of an early Spielberg movie.”\n\nWith the film celebrating its 10th anniversary this month, I decided to track down nearly every key member of its production (save for the elusive Spielberg) to learn how it came to be and why it continues to speak to audiences all these years later.\n\nInterviewees:\n\nJ.J. Abrams (writer/director/producer)\n\nBryan Burk (producer)\n\nLarry Fong (director of photography)\n\nMartin Whist (production designer)\n\nMichael Giacchino (composer)\n\nMichelle Rejwan (producer)\n\nDawn Gilliam (script supervisor)\n\nKim Libreri (VFX Supervisor, Industrial Light & Magic)\n\nLana Lan (CG lead artist, Industrial Light & Magic)\n\nSven Martin (VFX Supervisor, Pixomondo)\n\nMaryann Brandon (co-editor)\n\nJoel Courtney (Joe Lamb)\n\nElle Fanning (Alice Dainard)\n\nRiley Griffiths (Charles Kaznyk)\n\nRyan Lee (Cary McCarthy)\n\nGabriel Basso (Martin Read)\n\nKyle Chandler (Deputy Jackson Lamb)\n\nGlynn Turman (Dr. Woodward)\n\nThe story of Super 8 begins decades before the movie’s 2011 theatrical release. Its very title is a reference to the fact that Abrams — and many other members of production — began making movies with their parents’ Super 8 film cameras in 1970s and ‘80s. Some of them even worked together as kids.\n\nBURK: I’m a few years younger than J.J. and I actually met him through Matt Reeves, who is also a few years older than me. I remember when Raiders of the Lost Ark came out, it changed my life. I went to the theater to see it over and over and over. There’s an area here [in Los Angeles] called Westwood Village and it was playing at the theater over the summer. I used to go so often, that I convinced the assistant manager to let me go as often as I wanted — as long as they allowed me to clean up after every showing. That guy was Wade Major. Wade knew that I made Super 8 movies and was older than I was — and he said, “Oh, you need to meet my friend, Matt Reeves. He makes Super 8 movies too. He just cut Steven Spielberg’s movies…” I was like, “What?!” ...\n\nI never made any Super 8 movies with audio. I only started doing audio when video came around and started playing around with that ... But Matt Reeves and J.J. did [make Super 8 movies with sound]. It was something you could really relate to, that idea of getting all the neighborhood kids to rally around your crazy idea and everyone showing up with their parents’ clothes — and the bigger the better and the more outlandish the better.\n\nGIACCHINO: Before I got a Super 8 sound camera, I would just have a tape recorder and I would edit together scores to link up with the [footage] … It was a big pain in the butt, but it actually taught me so much, early on, about how music functions with picture. It was my very first version of music editing at that point. I had a huge record collection, both of my dad’s records and my own soundtrack collection that I loved and I would just pull from whatever worked. It could be anything: Star Wars, Raiders, Planet of the Apes, King Kong ...\n\nAll I did growing up, from nine years on was make movies. I made Super 8 movies, but before that, I made Regular 8 movies before I could afford a Super 8 camera. And I continued doing that all the way through college — I went to film school and everything. There was never a time I wasn’t making movies.\n\nThe seeds for Super 8 had steadily been lengthening their roots in Abrams’ mind for quite some time. The project actually started off as two separate concepts before it was decided to merge them into a single entity. With that decided, Abrams began writing the screenplay.\n\nABRAMS: It just hit me one day that a movie called Super 8, about a group of kids making movies, would be a fun project to work on. I nearly immediately called Steven Spielberg and asked if he'd want to do that with me. He said, “Yes.” We hung up. That was the beginning. From then on, we held many meetings, discussing the shape of the story — wanting it to be a true Amblin movie — giving it a grounded group of characters and something supernatural and otherworldly.\n\nBURK: For a long time, he [Abrams] talked about wanting to do a movie about the U.S. government transporting something on a train from Area 51 in the middle of the night, and there was an accident. That was the catalyst, the jumping off point — that was its own movie. And then separately, he liked the idea of these kids making Super 8 movies and it was a way of bringing them all together in this bonding experience. One day, I just remember he came in and he was like, “What if we mixed this peanut with this chocolate?” … We started getting together every day for many hours and talked through all the things we wanted to see in the movie … I remember at Bad Robot [Abrams’ production company], we had a washboard and it was a big circle that J.J. drew. There would be different [plot] points [on it].\n\nGIACCHINO: I was at Bad Robot and he said, “Hey, do you have time to read something?” I was like, “Sure.” He gave me an earlier version of the script to read and this was maybe 11 or 12 years ago at this point. I remember sitting in the office reading it because I wasn’t allowed to leave the building with it, of course. I just remember after finishing it, one of the first things I said to him was, “You know, this is basically our childhood.” I said, “Take away the monster and you have our childhood[s].”\n\nFONG: I was like, “What? Kids? I don’t want to do a kids thing.” I’m reading [the script] and I’m like, “Why do I have to do it?…Ohhh. Because we love science fiction, we’ve loved monsters and aliens from a young age. We love special effects and we love Spielberg.” ... Even though we were at different schools, I would help him [Abrams] and vice versa. I want to say it was like our childhood, but not totally 100 percent. We didn’t have aliens and trains in our childhood, but the love of film and all that definitely made it personal between him and I. That was the real connection and I guess that’s why he wanted me to shoot it.\n\nWHIST: It’s one of those scripts that … is just really fresh, but kind of nostalgic at the same time. There’s a familiarity, while at the same time, an exciting, surprise angle … almost like going back to the Spielberg of it all. It took that model and elevated it; made it very contemporary and fresh and exciting. The initial feeling was [me being] grateful for being asked to do it and then excited to be a part of something that felt like it would fall into the classic category of that type of filmmaking.\n\nSuper 8’s band of adolescents called for Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney), Charles Kaznyk (Riley Griffiths), Martin Read (Gabriel Basso), Cary McCarthy (Ryan Lee), Preston Scott (Zach Mills, who he declined to be interviewed for this story), and Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning).\n\nCourtney was the most inexperienced of the bunch and never expected to land a coveted Hollywood role on his very first try. Acting (pun intended) on the advice of a casting director friend, he decided to go for broke as Abrams sent out a nationwide call to find the perfect person to play a lovesick boy grappling with the tragic death of his mother.\n\nCOURTNEY: I just walked in on a random day and I auditioned and they put me in another room. I was like, “Ok, this is my first audition. I don’t think this is anything other than procedure.” They put me in another room and they came in with another casting director and gave me a new scene to do. They said, “Alright, we’re gonna try this one out with J.J. He’s gonna run down and we’re gonna do this.” I was like, “Wait…what?”\n\nGRIFFITHS: I was 11 at the time and I had gotten a self-tape submission from my agent. I sent in a video tape and I think two or three months went by, and I didn’t hear anything. [But] I ended up getting a callback and I couldn’t even remember the initial audition that well. Then I flew down to L.A., went to Bad Robot, and there were like nine or ten callback rounds … It kind of dwindled down ... I think Gabe was the last one cast. Gabe came in after we had already started rehearsals, but they told us all in a group. Every callback you would come back for, the group of kids would get smaller and smaller, and we’d keep seeing the same dudes around. So, we kind of knew. I kind of knew because I was auditioning for the chubby kid, so once I saw that there were no more chubby kids, I kind of relaxed a little bit [laughs].\n\nBASSO: There was a fake script and I thought it was terrible. I was at my grandmother’s wake and I really didn’t want to record the audition, obviously, because I was concerned with other things. My mom was like, “No, you have to record this.” So, we recorded it in the bathroom at the wake and then I sent it in. I didn't expect anything from it because I didn’t know it was a fake script. When I got back to L.A., they told me to come into Bad Robot and meet casting. I think it was that same day that J.J. came back in and I read with him and then they tried a bunch of glasses on me.\n\nLEE: I did a self-tape in Austin, Texas and [after] doing many, many self-tapes since, it’s funny that you rarely ever hear back. But I was lucky enough to hear back from J.J.’s team and then flew to L.A. ... The process started getting more serious and then we got into the room with J.J. and had another session where it was sort of a chemistry read between all the potential cast mates. It was a mix and match kind of thing and then, at some point, Joel and I got called into the office. We thought we were doing one more audition and then it was just J.J. in the room. He sat us down individually, but he asked: “Hey, Ryan, do you wanna be in a movie?” [laughs] I was like, “Uhhh, lemme think about that.” But yeah, the rest from there was history. It was just super surreal.\n\nFANNING: I was 12 at the time and remember hearing J.J. Abrams was starting to cast his next movie and there was a part I could possibly play, but the film was wrapped in secrecy. Little Darlings was the working title and naturally, I thought he was remaking the 1980’s Tatum O’Neal/Kristy McNichol camp movie. I watched that film and studied it, in hindsight it’s pretty hilarious that that’s what I thought J.J.’s next film was going to be!\n\nI went in and auditioned [with] what turned out to be “fake” scenes about a summer camp. The casting process was long and I eventually got called back to meet J.J. and read with the boys, so he could watch our chemistry together. One day I got a call from a number I didn’t recognize. It was J.J. personally asking if I wanted to be in his movie. I had no idea what the film was about or who I was playing, but obviously I screamed “YES!”\n\nThe boys and I had already met during the auditions, but once we were cast, we had to be let in on the secret. Joel, Riley, Ryan, Gabe, Zach, and I had weeks of rehearsals at Bad Robot in L.A. We sat at a table with J.J. and each had a script with dark red pages sitting in front of us. J.J. proceeded to read Super 8 aloud to us for the very first time. It still gives me chills thinking about that special moment.\n\nABRAMS: It was just a ton of reading of a lot of young actors. It was a wonderful time, getting to meet all these kids, and see what each of them brought to the roles. What I remember is that all the boys were so struck with Elle, that every time she was in a scene with them, they acted completely differently. They were on their best behavior. They were nervous and self-conscious in a way they never were when she was off set. Which was hilarious.\n\nFONG: She [Fanning] was the den mother in a sense. She was a teenager, but slightly older. Her demeanor is like that of an adult. She’s a unique individual and she would take direction from J.J. like crazy. J.J. would direct the other guys and they’d be distracted, not listening, and running around in circles and not do what they’re told sometimes [laughs]. But then he’d talk to Elle and you’d just see her listening, closing her eyes, and really taking it in. Then they go “Action!” and all the sudden, she’ll perform and it’s like, “What?!” She’d just nail it just like an adult. It was actually freaky.\n\nREJWAN: Elle Fanning, at the time, was the most experienced actor of the group and seeing him [Abrams] pull that together and create that chemistry between them that felt so unbelievably organic and authentic and immediately connected you to a time place and tone and feeling was really spectacular ... It was so fun to watch the kids who had, for the most part, not done anything ever like this before. They all became really good friends and formed that group off-camera as well.\n\nTo ensure a sense of camaraderie among the adolescent actors, Abrams encouraged them to spend as much time together as possible before the cameras started rolling.\n\nFANNING: He let us loose in Bad Robot for months during rehearsal. It was J.J. Abrams summer camp — our own personal fort. And we became inseparable. Just recently, the boys and I were all just chatting and recalling Super 8 memories in our Group Chat, so needless to say the BOND was created.\n\nGRIFFITHS: Bad Robot is like a kid’s paradise: they have a mini-golf [course] on the roof and ping pong and snacks everywhere. We were all in the same hotel, so we were spending pretty much all day with each other and hanging out, playing video games, and that kind of stuff. So we did get super close, even before we started filming.\n\nCOURTNEY: We were all in a hotel and we were all within 30 seconds of another guy’s door. You’d go up the stairs, down the hallway and that was Riley’s room. I was four doors down from him and then Ryan was upstairs or something like that. We just hung out, we just spent time together. We became buddies. We just did it that way.\n\nLEE: It was more important for us to hang out and have fun than it was for us to be good actors and I think that made for a pretty genuine, authentic experience for watchers.\n\nAs for the adult characters, Abrams brought in big names like Kyle Chandler (Jackson Lamb, Joe’s distant father and deputy of the Lillian PD) and Glynn Turman (Dr. Woodward, a local schoolteacher who sets the story in motion when he derails an Air Force train carrying an alien from Area 51). Turman’s involvement carries more significance than meets the eye — the actor played another ill-fated high school educator, Roy Hanson, in the Steven Spielberg-produced Gremlins back in 1984.\n\nTURMAN: I hadn’t worked with J.J., but I did know that Steven Spielberg was one of the executive producers [on Super 8]. So, I was glad to be in his company again. I hadn’t been in his company since I was in Gremlins with him many years before that. I had so much fun on that and it had been a while since I had done a big sci-fi kind of film. I looked forward to the experience and it didn’t disappoint. It was great … Neither one of [my characters] fared very well. One got stuck in the butt [laughs] … They got the short end of the stick, so-to-speak.\n\nCHANDLER: To have had the opportunity to work with J.J. Abrams on a film so close to his heart was quite an honor. The experience itself was as educational as it was enjoyable. I am consistently stunned by the un-phased energy of directors I have had the pleasure of working with over the years. Directors such as J.J., with immense responsibility and yet incredible imaginations, make me respect the saying by Elia Kazan: “There is only one thing a great director needs to know…everything.”\n\nCOURTNEY: I so appreciate J.J. surrounding me — a totally green newcomer actor — with some powerful actors. Elle, Kyle, Ron Eldard [Alice’s father]. Oh my goodness. Just some really spot-on, well-versed actors and then also having the boys around me: Riley, Ryan, Gabe. A little of experience here and there, but mostly green like me. Just the ensemble all together is just one of the best memories working with those guys.\n\nGRIFFITHS: We were always in the same hotel and so, I think we would go down to the front desk and we’d tell the front desk that we were Kyle Chandler’s son or nephew or something and we’d find out what room he was in. We would ding, dong, ditch him all the time, and he’d chase us down and around floors. It was awesome.\n\nCHANDLER: The kids made the set consistently enjoyable with their wonder and excitement, created from either massive explosions during the night shoots or when a new supply of fresh bagels had arrived at the craft service table. Not all kids are enjoyable on sets, but these guys were a gang — and a good gang to have around at that.\n\nDuring pre-production, production designer Martin Whist began searching for a location that could best stand in for the hamlet of Lillian, Ohio — Abrams’ fictional slice of small-town America in the late 1970s.\n\nThat location turned out to be Weirton, West Virginia, which, once upon a time, had been a crucial part of the U.S. steel industry. It was also the shooting location for Michael Cimino’s 1978 Oscar-winning Vietnam War picture, The Deer Hunter. It should be noted, however, that Weirton was mainly used for exterior shots, with almost every other scene filmed on sound stages or at the Bad Robot headquarters back in Los Angeles.\n\nWHIST: I started in Northern Ohio and scouted all through the west side and down to the south and up the riverside [to] the east side of Ohio that borders West Virginia. I got into the whole Rust Belt and must’ve looked at every single small town, all the way up the river … The most important thing was finding a town that had that authentic, American feel to it. Not a depressed feel in any regard, but a real, gritty working-class, almost Wonder Years-type of feel. But, of course, in the ‘70s. Something, that for someone of my age, would feel very familiar as a time when things were still going well and you hung out with your friends and you rode your bikes and you came home when the streetlights went on and everything was fine. People had stable jobs and all that kind of stuff.\n\nFANNING: I remember filming in Weirton, West Virginia, which, to this day, is my favorite place I have ever filmed. It had that wonderful small town quality and J.J. transformed the main street into what it would have been in the ‘70s. We were completely transported back in time.\n\nThen came the process of converting Weirton into a snapshot of the late ‘70s, but the onus didn’t squarely rest on Whist’s shoulders. Crafting the retro illusion was a team effort that encapsulated costumes, hair and makeup, and a perfectly-curated soundtrack of top hits by Electric Light Orchestra, The Commodores, The Knack, The Cars, and more.\n\nWHIST: For me, as production designer, it was basically a backlot and I could go in and do what I needed to do and transform the era of the town. But, of course, these old towns have a lot of the architecture [that] remains from back in the day. It wasn’t like I had to do big architectural things. It was more signage, color, some architecture, and dressing, which was huge. And the [period] cars and all that ...\n\nYou think of the house in E.T. — there’s a casualness to the dressing and it’s not a set so much. It’s very casual, it’s lived-in, it’s authentic to the era. It’s not cliche, and so, that’s kind of the feel that I endeavored to try to get in the sets. Not so much specific looks, but the overall feel of the film.\n\nABRAMS: As for the needle-drops, I went for music I remembered and loved from the era. I was thrilled that we got the tracks that we did — and owe a special thank you to my friend, Jeff Lynne, who allowed us to use the original ELO track, “Don't Bring Me Down.”\n\nREJWAN: There was this moment where Joel Courtney had to make a phone call. He was calling [Alice] in the camera store and, of course, all of us took for granted the prop we had for the phone — it’s a phone from 1979. He had to turn the dial and Joel did not know how to use that phone. He was standing there and we were like, “Oh my God, this is the cellphone generation.” We all felt so old, so it was so hilarious. Joel was probably looking at us like, “What is wrong with you guys?” [laughs]. But we just thought it was so funny.\n\nCOURTNEY: I do remember J.J. giving us this little print-out list of words that they would say back in the day. “Mint” was one of them. There’s one point where I say, “I know my dad’s being a turkey, but we can use his camera.” “You’re a brain.” [Charles says that] when we’re talking about the crash on the TV ... Then there was a list of words where they were like, “Don’t say these because these are too modern.” We had people helping us out with the time zone, the era, and then the costumes really sold it. The haircuts all sold it. The facial hair, all the guys with those big mutton chops. So, it was pretty easy to get into it with all the costuming on point.\n\nFANNING: I have always been a lover of decades past. Getting to transport back in time was extremely exciting for me. I remember my first wardrobe fitting filled with racks and racks of bell bottom jeans. J.J. gave each of us a huge packet full of ‘70s slang terms: “bitchin,” “mint, later days,” etc. and we looked at J.J. like, “Did you REALLY say this stuff?” [laughs]\n\nLEE: You walked onto set and it was all the [period] cars; the gas station had been decorated to the ‘70s ... I felt like I actually experienced a little slice of that time.\n\nGRIFFITHS: I did not know nearly as much [about the ‘70s] as what I learned while filming. I would always call and talk to my parents and be like, “Hey, do you remember this?” I think the craziest thing was…there was a deleted scene in a 7-11 and seeing all the snacks and candies that I’d never heard of. I was so intrigued by that.\n\nBASSO: The one thing that he [Abrams] was adamant about was that we learn that “My Sharona” song. The wardrobe was already there, we didn’t have to worry about that. It was just very much like, “Hey, go be kids, ride around, and learn the lyrics to this song.” ... J.J. was more like, “Dude, just have fun. Be a kid. Hang out.”\n\nLIBRERI: Super 8 is so authentic. We would geek out. We would go on set and look at the kid’s bedroom and be like, “I had that! I had that!”\n\nRight from the get-go, Super 8 was shrouded under a heavy blanket of mystery — like everything Abrams does. Released online in 2010, the very first teaser informed audiences that in 1979, classified cargo from Area 51 was being moved to a more secure facility in Ohio. This was followed by a spectacular train crash and a brief moment of silence before something busts out of one of the train cars.\n\nThis (along with a Portal 2 tie-in) whipped fans into a frenzy of speculation, leading to a viral marketing campaign on par with 2008’s Cloverfield (another Abrams project). In fact, some fans theorized that Super 8 was a sequel to Matt Reeves’ found footage monster movie. While that turned out to be false, the publicity once again proved Abrams’ talent for using the power of the internet to generate buzz.\n\nLIBRERI: There was no movie [at the time]. J.J. was working on his script and we made this teaser trailer for it, which is total J.J. style. I think we did it in 4-5 weeks … We did this trailer in almost no time. It was crazy.\n\nLEE: I remember when the teaser trailer came out, there is a split second at the end where it’s a Super 8 camera and it’s shuttering through the frames. J.J. turned to us and said, “Watch, everyone’s gonna go decipher each one of those frames.” I was like, “Wow. He’s a genius.”\n\nAbrams’ penchant for secrecy ended up getting the better of him when the young cast members decided to play a prank on him — one that may have taken a few years off his life.\n\nGRIFFITHS: I think it was during ADR, they all dared me to tell J.J. that I had lost the script in The Grove and that it was online. There’s this window above J.J.’s desk on the roof of Bad Robot. I look up and I can see everybody’s heads lined up, watching me as I prank J.J. I honestly was so scared because I’d never seen somebody so devastated as when I told him I lost that script … Honestly, I think it took a couple seconds for it to set in that it wasn’t real. All the kids ran in and we were just laughing and pointing at him and stuff. I don’t think he was too happy about it.\n\nLEE: I’m pretty sure that was April Fool’s ... It was me, Joel, Elle, and Gabe — we’re all sitting up top, watching through. We see Riley walk into the office and we see J.J.’s face kind of sink and then his hands go to his head. Riley’s playing it cool, he’s being a good actor. I don’t know if I would’ve kept that up, but at some point, we told him and it was all good. But I’m sure he had a moment.\n\nThe train crash featured in the teaser ended up being one of Super 8’s pivotal action set pieces. While filming a scene for their Romero-inspired zombie flick at the local train depot, Joe and his friends witness Dr. Woodward derail the Air Force train and free its cargo from the clutches of the sadistic Colonel Nelec (Noah Emmerich).\n\nWhile a sole pickup truck would never be able to do that much damage to a locomotive in real life, Abrams wasn’t striving for realism. As he notes on the director’s commentary track, he wanted the crash to feel exaggerated, a reflection of how the kids would one day look back on the experience. Since the production couldn’t really blow things up in West Virginia, they decided to shoot this sequence in the safety of the California desert.\n\nWHIST: We found a location up in North Los Angeles … I guess it was technically Victorville, [We] found a piece of land that we plotted out and started irrigating. We seeded and irrigated very early in production because, of course, this is all brown and all desert. [We needed] the green, the lush of the West Virginia/Ohio/Pennsylvania area. And so, we literally irrigated it to grow this green grass. I then laid probably about 800 feet of railway track and built the little train station there.\n\nSVEN MARTIN: While working on the train crash previz, [ILM Animation Supervisor Paul Kavanagh] and I drove over to Bad Robot to take photos of a tabletop model that the art department had built for this sequence. We wanted to use their layout as a blueprint for our digital scenery. After our first round of reference pictures, J.J. walked by and jumped right into a discussion about the action.\n\nIt was a beautiful model, like a detailed model or train diorama, and while J.J. was exploring how to shoot the scene, he started to rip the model apart, shifting the items around. It was great to witness this director’s point-of-view and how every little piece needs to come to a perfect position to support the story. Of course, we had to do a new round of reference pictures afterwards. I really like how hands-on J.J. is. During another meeting, he squeezed himself between Paul and I on the sofa, took over the mouse, and started to explore the previz scene in Maya by himself.\n\nABRAMS: That was obviously a hugely elaborate set piece — and it required many nights of shooting, and lots of pyrotechnics and having the kids in frame with giant explosions, and, of course, ILM doing all the moving train work. Kim Libreri … did spectacular work — all the artists did — making it seem like there really was a freight train racing past them — and crashing for about 35 minutes.\n\nLIBRERI: We shot a ton of plates [in Weirton] and then in visual effects, we would extend the stuff that we would shoot in L.A. … I think it was 400 feet by 400 feet of grass that we were able to dress with the train crash and then, in the night-time, when all the explosions are going off, we were able to rig up practical effects in a safe way, but it was so exciting to see the kids. Instead of trying to do everything with green screen work, it’s happening at the location, at a safe distance with sensible lens choices for safety, but it made the reactions so good.\n\nLEE: You could feel the explosion from a mile away, 5-10 seconds after. Then there was a little mushroom cloud. In my pyromaniac mind at the time, I was like, ‘THIS IS IT! THIS IS THE ONE!’ That was super cool to see.\n\nCOURTNEY: Filming the actual train crashing scene, running around all the debris — this was my first time working with explosions of any kind. The epic grand scale of that scene was so fun and I remember J.J. showing us some of his storyboards. He was like, “This massive train car is gonna come out of the air and crash right in front of you. It’s gonna be huge. There’s gonna be an explosion.” … We're just like, “Oh my gosh! This is so cool!” Honestly, my entire experience filming that train crash scene was Ryan’s character’s reaction at the end. He’s like, “Did you see those explosions? They were huge. It was unbelievable!”\n\nFANNING: J.J. wasn’t just concerned about making a good movie, he wanted us to have a shared experience that we would remember for the rest of our lives. He did just that. Every moment was an event. His sets create a larger-than-life atmosphere just like his movies. I remember we all got to stay one night and watch the train crash explosion in real time. IT WAS EPIC! I had never seen anything on that scale.\n\nBASSO: I remember them detonating and blowing the thing up and getting hit with the shockwave. We obviously stood far [away] and watched, but when they blew it up, I just remember it almost knocking Riley and I off the fence that we were sitting on.\n\nGRIFFITHS: Something that stands out to me from the train sequence is, once wrapped, that was the last time the whole group of kids were filming together. I remember stepping back and really taking a moment to appreciate the tremendous journey that filming Super 8 was.\n\nTURMAN: The biggest kid on the set every day was J.J. Abrams. It was like he had all these toys to play with. One of the first scenes that we did was the train crash ... I just remember watching him and how much fun he had putting that all together and making that all happen. His fun was infectious.\n\nGIACCHINO: I took my son that night ... and we were there for that giant explosion, which was fun to see. I would say that working on that film felt so much like when I was a kid making movies.\n\nBRANDON: I’ve never seen somebody so happy. I kept saying to J.J. [during editing], “You sure you don’t want to cut it down?” Finally, he said to me, “I know it’s long, but it is so much fun, I just can’t.” And I was like, “Oh my God, you’re so right!” He’s like, “Maryann, just let everyone enjoy it.” I will never forget those words.\n\nThe train crash delivers a multi-limbed — not to mention man-eating — alien onto Lillian. As people and bits of machinery start to disappear, the government sets up a shady presence in the town and the adults run around, totally clueless, blaming all the strange occurrences on a Soviet invasion (a nod to the Cold War paranoia of the time). In true Amblin fashion, it’s up to Joe and his friends to take charge and solve the mystery.\n\nDesigned by Neville Page — who could not be reached for this piece — the cosmic visitor was lovingly named “Cooper” by the production crew. While hidden and obscured for most of the film (a technique utilized by a beleaguered Steven Spielberg on 1975’s Jaws), Cooper shows his full self in the action-packed finale, where Joe and Cary venture into the creature’s subterranean lair to save Alice.\n\nLIBRERI: He [Abrams] wanted a design that he felt could be as iconic as an E.T. or a Predator. And yet, could be something that people have some level of empathy with. Because you know, at the beginning of the movie, it’s bad and evil, doing naughty things. But at the end, you’re meant to feel a bit of a connection with it.\n\nLAN: Much of the time we see Cooper, he is in his dark underground lair. His skin has a quite contrasty black and white pattern. In low light, the white parts really popped and the dark parts disappeared, making him challenging to light in the lair. In some ways, it worked in our favor to obscure his true form in early glimpses, but when he does reveal himself to Joe, we had to massage the lighting in every shot to make his shape read properly.\n\nFor the way Cooper moves, I recall the animation team trying to make him walk like a person and that simply didn't look alien or scary enough for the sequences when the kids go into the lair. Putting him on all six limbs, like a horrible spider, was much more effective and provided a contrast for when he does stand upright and reveal himself to be an intelligent, emotive creature.\n\nTURMAN: I didn’t approach it [freeing the alien] as if it was some kind of absurd thing or like it was not possible. I was approaching it as though it was a serious possible matter that happened and that this was a serious circumstance. I approached it like this thing could happen. And Woodward had a backstory with the creature, so that backstory let me know that Woodward was taking all of this very seriously because he knew what the ramifications could be.\n\nCOURTNEY: The little part where I’m picked up by the alien, I remember being in a harness and then just getting hoisted in the air. They kept telling me, “Joel, you’re smiling too much. You’re having too much fun. This is a scary alien picking you up.” I was probably 15 or 20 feet in the air because they really wanted to get that sudden jolt motion. They were like, “It’s a little more scary. Do more fear.” And I was like, “Ok, ok.” I was just trying to hold in my laughter because I love rollercoasters, I love movement like that. That kind of motion, being in the harness, it was so fun. They were like, “Just remember, you’re scared.” And I was like, “Yayyy.”\n\nFor the score, Abrams turned to his longtime collaborator, Michael Giacchino, who has worked on nearly all of Abrams’ projects since Alias. Perfectly mixing unease with tender emotion and a pure sense of wonder, Giacchino’s music for Super 8 is one of the most criminally underrated movie scores in Hollywood history.\n\nThe summer that the movie came out, I took a film course at the University of Pennsylvania and would listen to the score every single day on my walk home. I loved it so much, in fact, that a few cues made their way into my final project. Simply put, Giacchino’s score deserves to stand besides John Williams’ beloved and iconic compositions for Close Encounters and E.T.\n\nGIACCHINO: The movie [has], in a good way, a split personality. There’s the romantic version of the story and then you have the horror aspect. The sci-fi/horror thing happening. Weaving those things together, that’s not an easy task to do. Not just for me, but for the editors, for J.J. as a director, for all the actors in terms of tone. It’s difficult to do, so we were always keeping our eye on that because every scene had a specific intent of a story point it was trying to convey.\n\nAnd then, of course, all of the ‘duh nuh nuh nuh’ — all of that stuff. For that, I wanted it to feel like there’s something just beyond where you can see and you sense that it’s coming towards you, but you don’t know what it is yet or what it wants from you. That was the feeling that I wanted from it and it was this repeating thing that would just grow and grow until it’s huge.\n\nABRAMS: Michael is responsible for all the feelings you might have watching the film. He did, as always, an extraordinary job capturing the sweetness of the story without it being saccharine. The darkness in the low register that compliments the higher-register melody is the perfect combination of innocence and danger that the movie needed to convey. He's such a genius.\n\nBelow is a video specially created for concert performances of the “Super 8 Suite.”\n\nSuper 8 goes out on an incredibly high note during the end credits with the finished zombie flick we just saw the kids trying to make throughout the film proper. Shot on an actual Super 8 camera, The Case was almost entirely written and directed by the young cast members. Giacchino completes the schlocky illusion of poor lighting, wonky editing, bad acting, and no-budget special effects with an equally schlocky theme.\n\nABRAMS: Filming that last movie was one of the most fun aspects of making the movie. It was actually shot on Super 8 film, and we shot it so quickly — and jumped from shot-to-shot. It really made me want to do a series that was shot that way. It felt incredibly alive and ridiculous, and was probably the most entertaining aspect of the whole film.\n\nFONG: That was so much fun. I lit it badly on purpose, which is always so much fun and then compose it badly. I’d be like, “I can operate this one” and J.J. would go, “No! No! I wanna operate this one!” [laughs]. We’d fight over it. It has cuts and zooms that make no sense and the composition’s really bad. You don’t do overs, you just shoot from the same direction. That’s how it was when you were little. To tap into that was so funny — we’d literally be rolling over with laughter after the takes.\n\nGRIFFITHS: J.J. and Larry gave us full control of the script and filming of the movie within the movie. That was such a great experience. I remember we’d all get together and write, figure out the story, and all that stuff. Then Larry would help us set up the shots.\n\nLEE: Obviously, J.J. let us write and direct that little movie ... That was a really fun, special experience. Doing the zombie, I got to try three different variations of zombies. I’m pretty sure Zombieland was out at that point and I Am Legend — stuff like that. I was sort of trying to recreate those.\n\nREJWAN: That was so hilarious, just watching Ryan with his eyes popping out, being a zombie. We were just cracking up … I remember being there for it [and] trying so hard not to laugh while the cameras were rolling because it was unbelievably funny.\n\nBRANDON: I actually cut that together myself. I said to J.J., “I’m gonna do this in my spare time” because I used to make films like this and it was always so much fun. I took my experience from college, where I was in a film club, and we went around and made films like that. I just put it together like I would’ve put a film together at 18.\n\nGIACCHINO: Since this was a film that the kids were making, we wanted their score to sound like stock music that might have been used in an old school horror movie, or maybe it was something that they had found in their basement on an old album of Hollywood monster music. It definitely had to have the feeling of something that already existed, something that would have been familiar to them from watching the old flicks. Side note: I actually played the theremin on the recording!\n\nBURK: All the films we made [as kids] were also really violent. They were amazingly violent [but] by no means were any of them [good]. They were graphically violent in the concept, but never in its execution. It was water balloons exploding with red dye and it’d be like a head exploding and it looked like a water balloon exploding, but it was the idea of what it was. It’s strangely no different from what we do today, which is somebody has an idea and then you need to figure out how to execute that idea.\n\nOf course, Super 8 would not have been possible without the influence of the great Steven Spielberg. While the legendary director was busy making War Horse around the same time, he still made sure to help guide the production along during principal photography, scoring, and editing.\n\nBURK: They [Spielberg and Abrams] were close before Super 8, but I think they really got close while making that film ... They say don’t meet your heroes and in this case, Steven far surpasses your wildest imagination as to how great he is … So many things keep popping into my head, but more than anything, it was that relationship between Steven and J.J., which I think was good and then really started to get galvanized during the making of Super 8.\n\nGIACCHINO: I remember on the [Fox Scoring Stage], standing there one time with Steven before we started the day with the musicians. Everyone was getting set up and he’s looking around the room and you could tell he was just processing something. I was like, “What are you thinking about?” And he said, “You know, I was just thinking that the last time I stood in this room was when we recorded Jaws.” I was just like, “Wow.” That put it all in perspective for me in terms of how crazy and great it was to be where we were, making what we were making with the people we were making it with.\n\nREJWAN: While we were editing the film, Steven would come to the cutting room and work with J.J. It was just pretty incredible to witness and watch how unbelievable he was at zoning in on precisely when something was really working or have unbelievable solutions and proposals and ideas for ways to make something work if we were having any issues with any portion of the narrative. It was just really neat, taking it all in and just learning the greatest master.\n\nCHANDLER: My favorite scene in the movie is etched in my mind and was not captured on film, rather what was witnessed behind-the-scenes. One day of shooting, there was an elevated ramp going down to the lair of the monster where the cameras and viewing monitor for J.J. were set. Behind J.J., a few feet away, there was another monitor set up for Steven Spielberg.\n\nAs the shot was happening, I had the opportunity to glance up to both watching the scene unfold — separate but together. There was an unmistakable sense of respect between the two great directors. Most incredibly, J.J. and Steven were standing in identical poses. The moment was not lost on this movie viewer because if you know the story behind the story, you know why it is by far my favorite scene of the film.\n\nGILLIAM: The one thing that I can remember, which I thought was really cool, was that Steven Spielberg came down to the set one day and how nervous all the kids were. He was just coming down to visit J.J. and they were just so nervous.\n\nCOURTNEY: To this day, I think that was one of the most nervous and excited [times of my life] just to have him present on set ... There was another time that really stood out. We wrapped filming and at some point, the whole cast and producers and J.J., we went out for dinner. I got sit next to or across from [Steven] at dinner. I remember listening and being like, “I just wanna hear what he has to say. I just wanna glean wisdom. This is insane. This is a once in a lifetime thing. This’ll never happen again.”\n\nFANNING: I remember him coming on set for my big zombie make-up scene, which was the scene I was most excited to film. I absolutely love fake blood (fun fact: movie blood tastes like peppermint). I had been practicing my best zombie impression for weeks in my mirror at home. On the day, I remember seeing Steven and J.J. out of the corner of my eye during a take. They were laughing to each other behind the monitor and my 12-year-old self felt invincible in that moment.\n\nGRIFFITHS: My younger brother [Jade] was actually in the movie as well. He was my younger brother in the movie. And so, the day that Steven came to set, the first day that he came was when we were filming inside the Kaznyk house ... Jade was there and he actually met him before I did. That scene was crazy because they were at the [breakfast] table and they were having a food fight or something, so my younger brother had orange juice all over his hand. Steven came up and introduced himself to my brother and my brother’s hand was all sticky, so he just gave him a fist bump. And I was like, “Dude, do you know who you just fist bumped?”\n\nLEE: I think and Elle were talking and I walked up because I was like, “This is it! This is the moment.” I walked up and said, “Hi.” He goes, “Hi, Cary!” — he knew me by my character name — “Nice to meet you, thanks so much.” And then I’m pretty sure that we just spent the next 10 minutes talking about what new iPhone apps had just come out. Nothing profound, just super normal.\n\nFONG: When he visited, he let J.J. direct. He might’ve had one or two cool ideas that we implemented … It was cool having him on the set because I’d never met him and it was wild to come and see him sitting in my chair.\n\nThat’s what happens when you’re DP. You’re always busy and you’re like, “Who’s gonna be sitting in my chair this time?” Rather than an agent’s girlfriend or something, it’s Steven Spielberg sitting in my chair and I’m like, “Wow, that’s really cool and he can stay there.” When he was introduced to me, he did say, “Hey, the dailies are looking great, thank you.” And I’m like, “Whoaaaa.” That was freaky. That was a bucket list type of thing ...\n\nI’ve always avoided [emulating Spielberg] because you can’t outdo Spielberg. If you’re doing a movie that’s trying to look like him, then you’ll just get raked over the coals because what are you doing? But the cool thing about this movie was Spielberg was part of it, so I’m like, “I have total carte blanche, maybe for the only time in my life, to act Spielbergian on a thing that’s involved with him.” I was really lucky in that respect because I’ll probably never do a movie that looks like that again.\n\nDespite its generous budget and access to all sorts of modern movie-making tools, the folks behind Super 8 affirm that its production felt like a return to the intimate, seat-of-your-pants filmmaking known to all kids who one day hope to one day tell stories on the big screen.\n\nABRAMS: It was a wonderful experience with some wonderfully talented artists and dear friends. Larry Fong ... is someone I've known since I was the age of the kids in the movie. The First AD, Tommy Gormley, is one of the greatest men on the planet, and was, as always, a joy to be with. Dawn Gilliam, the script supervisor, worked with me on Alias and Lost, and we laughed more on that set than anywhere else.\n\nBRANDON: When you work at Bad Robot with J.J., it’s such a family affair. The kids were around a lot and my kids came and went and so, everybody got to know everyone really well … Weirdly, it felt like we were making a home movie, even though it was obviously a studio film. But it felt very personal. I think that’s the biggest thing and why I love Super 8 so much. Because everyone felt open to making crazy suggestions and I think there was a little bit of everyone’s personality involved in that film …\n\nWe shot a couple of additional scenes at Bad Robot. That was really fun. It was literally like making a movie when you were in film school. I think I played the back of Ron Eldard’s head in 2 or 3 scenes because I had the right hair color. I think there’s one scene where I might’ve played one of the kids’ shoulders.\n\nREJWAN: The whole movie had a very special, personal feeling about it and many of us talk about that to this day. That it was just a really unique moment in time and something where I think we were all, given the nature of the story and it being centered around these young kids, just accessing an aspect of our childhood and the movies we grew up loving that made us fall in love with cinema ... It had quite an intimate feeling about it. Like we were making a movie in our backyard with friends.\n\nSuper 8 opened in theaters on June 10, 2011 to generally positive reactions from critics and audiences (the film currently holds a fresh 81% on Rotten Tomatoes). It was also a modest success at the global box office, bringing in a little over $260 million against an equally modest budget of $50 million.\n\nA decade later, however, crew members and fans alike don’t remember the reviews or ticket sales — they only remember how this particular movie made them feel at the time. A sure sign that Abrams had indeed captured a little bit of that indescribable Amblin magic.\n\nABRAMS: Personally, it was a strange time, as I was working on a story about a boy who had lost his mother, when my mother was diagnosed with cancer. I didn't expect to be working through feelings about my mother when I started writing it, but that's what ended up happening. I've always been touched by people for whom the movie meant something special. While it is definitely an imperfect film, it's got a big heart and the kids in it (and adults too) were wonderful, and wonderful to work with.\n\nGIACCHINO: I loved working on the final scene when [Joe] has the locket and it’s floating and he lets go of that whole thing. I actually think it was Mother’s Day when we recorded that and I remember J.J.’s mother, who is sadly no longer with us, was there. I remember we got flowers for all the women in the orchestra and that was a special day. You work a bunch of days on these things, but certain ones stick out more than others and that one certainly stuck out for me.\n\nBURK: I find that a lot of people are now showing it to their kids as the kids get a little bit older. It’s what we hoped it would have elements of. I saw Goonies recently and you realize that it’s this film that every generation [rediscovers]. They can keep showing it at a certain age and by no means do I think Super 8 is half as good as Goonies and the greatness of that, but the idea that there can be another one of those films that hopefully parents — or as you become a parent in 20 years when you have a 10-year-old kid — you can show them this movie and it’s something fun for them to experience.\n\nFONG: I’m surprised how many people come up and still say it’s one of their favorite films, and that’s cool because it was definitely a labor of love. For J.J., it was the smallest movie he’s ever done, but it just goes to show you it’s how personal something is, not a mega-mega budget.\n\nWHIST: When people find out I worked on it, they’re all very excited and ask questions. I think it’s definitely held up and will continue to hold up. It’s one of those films that even in the barrage of content out there … It’s always fresh and fun and touching. It just has the human element, which I think is the key to it. There’s that real connection to character, that touching connection through the mother and the son … There’s a sentimentality to it that’s just kind of right. It’s authentic and feels real.\n\nREJWAN: There are different writers and directors over the years I’ve spoken to who ... mention moments in Super 8 that really inspired them, and it’s really nice to hear because we’re so happy that it could bring the joy we had making it. You go, “I hope this is as fun as we think.” I just think it turned out beautifully and it’ll forever be one of my favorite experiences and films.\n\nGILLIAM: It was an homage to Spielberg, but it was also an homage to just simple, basic filmmaking. Basic storytelling. It’s nice and wholesome. I think that’s why Disney does so well, because they do put out wholesome stuff and people like it. This is maybe a little more advanced, but it still had that wholesomeness.\n\nTURMAN: It’s part of that genre and that era. All the fun films of sci-fi. It’ll be included as one of those that took sci-fi to another niche. It stepped up with the technology and the fun of it and there are a bunch of films that lead the way in that genre. I think Super 8 is one of them.\n\nCOURTNEY: That whole process of filming Super 8, I just fell in love with the industry, the work, the sets, the crew — everybody … It holds in my memory as nothing less than just exceptional … There are some times when you see special effects and it’s like, “Hmmm, this movie’s aged a little bit.” Super 8 has not. It is seamless.\n\nLEE: I remember before the premiere, all the kids sat down to watch the movie. We went to Bad Robot and we went to the little theater room where we’d done all of our rehearsals and whatnot. J.J. goes, “Ok, guys. Enjoy the movie. I’m gonna step out. I’ll see you guys later.” So, we thought J.J. was gone, but really he just pretended to step out, so he could get our genuine reactions ... We were crying and screaming throughout the whole entire movie. That’s where I’m still at. Nothing’s changed.\n\nFANNING: I’ve had a lot of people say Alice was their first crush which is pretty cool ... J.J. poured his childhood and child-like self into this film. It’s a monster movie with a beating heart. Stories about the imagination of kids and strong friendships always connect us.\n\nFive years after Super 8 debuted, Netflix changed the pop culture landscape with Stranger Things. Another send-up to ‘80s-era touchstones, the hit series (now coming up on its fourth season) helped launch a retro renaissance, whose influence can be felt in Andy Musichetti’s two IT movies, Season 9 of American Horror Story, and the recent Wonder Woman sequel. However, Super 8 was ahead of them all, prompting Fong to joke that Stranger Things feels more like “Super 8: The Series.”\n\nABRAMS: I guess it was inevitable that filmmakers who were so powerfully impacted by the Amblin movies would start to tell stories that nodded strongly to those influences.\n\nFONG: I think everything old comes around again. Everything’s new again. You’re even seeing people starting to dress that way a little bit — hipsters and girls wearing bell bottoms and these tight jeans and stuff. It’s hilarious. And then hairstyles. Young people know all the songs that are in our old movies. Kids are like, “I love that song!” And you’re like, “What? You were just born 15 years ago, how do you know?” I’m meeting young people who are asking me, “Hey, Larry...do you know Pink Floyd?”\n\nGILLIAM: I would have to say that J.J. is probably that way and I’ve just always been like that. We’ve always been ahead of the curve. We’re just always coming up with stuff and then people catch on later. I think it’s just part of who he is — to just be at the forefront of things.\n\nFANNING: JJ is always ahead of the curve. I’m sure he’s already thinking 10 years ahead of now.\n\nBURK: I think we just happened to make it first. Stranger Things is definitely its own thing and a fantastic thing. It’s so exciting, and they’re really tapped into capturing that retro ‘80s thing in a way that makes me really explore my youth and remember it in a way that’s just fantastic — let alone just be filled with fantastic storytelling and filmmaking and performances.\n\nREJWAN: I love Stranger Things. I think they did — and do — an absolutely brilliant job … At the end of the day, it’s always about great characters and if you’re gripped by those characters, then you wanna hang out with them and care about them and root for them.\n\nGIACCHINO: It was one thing for us to do it because we grew up with all of these things. But then to see people taking that perspective from the point-of-view of not necessarily having grown up with them, but having seen them as they were growing up as things that came out. In the way that I saw, say, Godzilla movies growing up. I was not a part of their release, but they were a big part of my childhood. I feel like that’s what we’re witnessing.\n\nGRIFFITHS: When I first saw Stranger Things, I was like, “Hmm, that looks pretty familiar right there.” But yeah, I think that Super 8 definitely played a part. It’s crazy how that did happen afterwards … I saw a thing on Twitter…some super cinema buff broke it down and found a bunch of similarities and that was crazy to see.\n\nAbrams has no current plans to revisit the world of Super 8 — even if it’s in a more tangential way (à la the Cloverfield universe).\n\nABRAMS: That movie feels like a beginning, middle and end to me.\n\nBURK: [jokingly] Super 9? We had different conversations about things. Not a sequel necessarily … That’s more of a J.J. question because it was all hatched in his head. It’s one of those things where if one day he said, “I have a crazy idea!”, then that would begin it. But I don’t really think so. There was one thing we talked about, but ask him that question. You can say, “Bryan said you had one time flirted with something, but he won’t go into details…” It was so many years ago. I don’t think it would ever happen, but it would’ve been fun. [Abrams declined to comment]\n\nCOURTNEY: J.J.'s said multiple times [that] Super 8 is a one-off. It is the story of friends and a father-son [relationship] — and oh yeah, there’s an alien. It’s all contained in this one story. We joked about that on set. We were like, “Yeah, what if we do a Super 9?” He was like, “You guys…it would at least be 16mm, not Super 9.”"
