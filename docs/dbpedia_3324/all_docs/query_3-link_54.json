        "text": "Initially reported in the Hollywood trades back in January, today Paramount Pictures has officially slated another new Star Trek film into their theatrical release schedule.\n\nSaid to be “an origin story set decades before the original 2009 Star Trek film,” the next Trek film was mentioned on stage at the studio’s annual CinemaCon panel in Las Vegas this afternoon, and included in their published slate of upcoming releases sent to press.\n\nThe still-untitled Star Trek prequel film is set to hit theaters in 2025 — there is no specific release date yet — with production to begin sometime in 2024 as reported by the in-the-audience SlashFilm. The movie will be helmed by Star Wars: Andor director Toby Haynes, written by Seth Grahame-Smith, and produced by J.J. Abrams’ Bad Robot.\n\nUNTITLED STAR TREK ORIGIN STORY\n\nDirector: Toby Haynes\n\nWriter: Seth Grahame-Smith\n\nProducer: J.J. Abrams\n\nThis project is an origin story that takes place decades before the original 2009 Star Trek film.\n\nThat’s literally all we know! The film still has no official cast or character list yet, so as of today there’s no clear indication if anyone from previous Star Trek adventures — Kelvin Timeline or otherwise — will be part of the project.\n\nWe’ll continue to bring you all the news on this Star Trek theatrical project as things develop!"
