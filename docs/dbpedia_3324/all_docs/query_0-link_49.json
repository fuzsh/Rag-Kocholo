        "text": "By Ben Miller\n\nI was fortunate enough to sit down with Award-wining Vietnamese director Tran Ahn Hung to talk about his wonderful new film The Taste of Things. We spoke about his film's themes, making a film without conflict, and shooting cooking scenes like action sequences.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for clarity. THIS INTERVIEW CONTAINS SOME FILM SPOILERS\n\nBEN MILLER: I loved your film. Thank you so much for having it. I was curious, more than anything else, how the story came about as far as how it relates to the food. Did you come up with the idea of the film, and then have to backfill all the recipes, and the food, and the preparation, or was it vice versa?\n\nTRAN ANH HUNG: I think the idea of the food came first. I always wanted to make a movie about food. So the idea is to find the right project. So, I read a lot of books. I wanted to make a movie about food, but it didn't happen. So when I found this book, I was really happy because there were some pages, that was really nice, about how people talk about food. That was the starting point. And then, since I didn't like the story in the book, it was the opportunity for me to think about the idea of the people at that age, around 50. And how it would be harmonious relationship between a man and woman at that age. Then, I came with the love story between Eugènie and Dodin.\n\nBEN MILLER: It's really interesting how you just said that. You don't really see that kind of like...these characters are not young, but it's never highlighted that they are getting up there in age. They've been together all this time, but there's no real labels on it. It's not a story of \"finally after all these years they can find love.\" They've always been there. How do you describe that?\n\nTRAN ANH HUNG: This is the very important point that you made. Because it's in fact the nature of their relationship which I tried to show in the movie. And this nature is given by Eugènie because she didn't want to marry Dodin. This distance that she put between them made the beauty of their relationship. At the end of the movie, the very clear definition of their relationship, and this definition is understood and accepted by Dodin, about what woman Eugènie would like to be. It's a very strong statement. The whole movie is about this idea of her being a free woman and about Dodin, who accepted it.\n\nBEN MILLER: The big takeaway from the film...you see films or reality shows with cooking and a chef in a high-pressure situation, and it's always very abrasive and overbearing. IN this film, it's like a ballet. It's so graceful, and working together, and understanding each other's movements. And even whenever the child comes in as the apprentice, we are going introduce her in a way to show her how much this is loved. Any conflict in the film has nothing to do with the food. Was that an intentional idea where you said, \"everything is perfect in this situation?\"\n\nTRAN ANH HUNG: I would not say that it's perfect. It's more about this idea of giving up with conflicts. Because conflicts is something that is usually in film. Because somehow it's easier, it's a dynamic thing for a movie. When you don't have conflict, it becomes something that's a great challenge for me to achieve. How to make a movie without conflict and expressing harmony. That was something difficult for me to do, it's not that it's perfect, it's how to create a possible world that has harmony between people. Dealing with different feelings like friendship, love, and transmission. This little girl, Pauline, it's a beautiful character. She carries the theme of transmission, because Eugènie wanted to train her and promised to train her. She appears at the beginning of the movie, disappears, and reappears at the end. When she reappears, Eugènie died, and she has to save Dodin. He didn't want to make up with life. Because of that promise, Dodin needs to find a cook to train her And somehow before dying, Eugènie managed to give Dodin a daughter. This is very beautiful.\n\nBEN MILLER: It's not the kind of film you see these days, because like you said, there's always these films with conflict. Most of the conflict is internal. When watching the film, I saw the Russian aristocrat come in, and I assumed he would be the villain. But that didn't happen. And all of Dodin's friends are very supportive. It must be difficult to write that. Was the intention from the beginning or did it just evolve into that?\n\nTRAN ANH HUNG: Yes, it was the intention from the beginning. When I choose a project, it needs to have a real challenge for me. The challenge here is to film the cooking scenes that is really different from what we see in different movies. And also to find the balance between the love story and the cooking scenes. And how to create this feeling of harmony and pleasure for the audience."
