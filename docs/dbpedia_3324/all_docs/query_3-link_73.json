        "text": "Paramount International Networks & Streaming launched its “No Diversity, No Commission” content policy across the company’s international properties, effective October 2020. The policy, which started at ViacomCBS Networks U.K. in July 2020, is designed to promote and increase diversity in content and production. Among other changes, the policy requires production companies to meet prescribed diversity and inclusion guidelines prior to getting a final sign-off from Paramount International Networks & Streaming. The policy also includes “New Faces, New Voices,” a search for diverse contributors that aims to boost on-screen representation, and the “Promotion Opportunity Project,” created to identify and support the promotion of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) production talent in the UK.\n\nPreviously, Channel 5 commissioned shows under the Diverse Indie Initiative, which it co-founded with The TV Collective in 2019 with the intent to partner with the most culturally diverse production companies to create mainstream programs for the channel. At BET UK, a $1m (£714k) commissioning budget was created to invest in new UK originals addressing themes and topical issues relevant to young, Black British audiences.\n\nIn October 2021, Paramount International Studios (PIS) launched PIS Social Impact. The new studio division will develop groundbreaking social impact-driven content addressing climate, equity, and health for the Paramount portfolio of brands, including Paramount+, as well as for third-party partners. PIS Social Impact is part of Content for Change and will also champion diverse creators and content focused on underrepresented communities. PIS Social Impact commissioned “Protest & Progress” from world-renowned, history-making photographer and social activist, Misan Harriman. The studio is also launching an inclusive writers’ room focused on scripted ideas powered by a diverse group of creatives, with a strong presence of participants from LGBTQ+ communities led by actor, writer and director Thishiwe Ziqubu. Earlier in May, 2021, Paramount International Networks & Streaming launched Narrativas Negras, a writing room of Black writers dedicated to ”developing representative and inclusive content.” The writing team is based in Brazil and led by Marton Olympio."
