It's a perfectly calibrated romp that both embraces and subverts some tried and true tropes of the teen comedy. \"More than a decade and a half after we first met Silverstone's divine Ms. Horowitz,\" EW's critic wrote of the film in 2012, \"she still has an important message for those of us watching at home: Namely, 'tis a far, far better thing doing stuff for other people.'\" —Declan Gallagher\n\nWhere to watch Clueless: Paramount+\n\nEW grade: C+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Amy Heckerling\n\nCast: Alicia Silverstone, Paul Rudd, Brittany Murphy, Stacey Dash, Donald Faison\n\n02 of 22\n\nErin Brockovich (2000)\n\nWhat could have been your standard Julia Roberts vehicle is, in the hands of director Steven Soderbergh, one of the most compelling legal dramas of the modern era. Roberts stars as real-life activist Erin Brockovich, chronicling her journey from unemployed single mother to paralegal presenting evidence for a major class action lawsuit against the Pacific Gas and Electric Company. Brockovich's force of personality makes her the perfect hero for those ordinary citizens affected by the gas company’s contamination coverup, and Roberts makes a meal of her character's take-no-prisoners attitude. The actress deservedly won an Oscar for her work; as EW's critic writes, \"Roberts, in her most forceful dramatic performance, allows us to take in every moment through fresh, impassioned eyes.\" —Kevin Jacobsen\n\nWhere to watch Erin Brockovich: Paramount+\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Steven Soderbergh\n\nCast: Julia Roberts, Albert Finney, Aaron Eckhart\n\n03 of 22\n\nFatal Attraction (1987)\n\nHell hath no fury like a woman scorned. As the unstable Alex Forrest, Glenn Close became one of the all-time great movie antagonists with this iconic erotic thriller. When Alex meets Dan (Michael Douglas) at a business function, there is a charge between them that blossoms into a passionate affair. The problem is, Dan is married and has a kid, and after he coldly tries to end the affair, Alex retaliates with a series of increasingly dangerous actions. What sets Fatal Attraction above the many erotic thrillers released in the '80s and '90s is in how Close brings humanity to Alex, with an undercurrent of loneliness that prevents her from becoming a two-dimensional villain. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Fatal Attraction: Paramount+\n\nDirector: Adrian Lyne\n\nCast: Michael Douglas, Glenn Close, Anne Archer\n\n04 of 22\n\nFerris Bueller's Day Off (1986)\n\nMatthew Broderick inspired an entire generation of kids to be bad in John Hughes’ classic about hipster high schooler Ferris Bueller (Broderick) and his wacky, wild day playing hooky with his morose friend Cameron (Alan Ruck) and girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara). It's a silly romp and perhaps not much more than that, but the movie holds up (and manages to feel a bit modern) all these years later. As EW's critic recalls, \"It's the rare film that charms both Kurt Cobain and Dan Quayle, but like Ferris Bueller himself — who was popular with sportos, motorheads, geeks, sluts, bloods, wasteoids, dweebies, and d---heads alike...Ferris Bueller’s Day Off appealed to just about everyone.\" —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Ferris Bueller’s Day Off: Paramount+\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nDirector: John Hughes\n\nCast: Matthew Broderick, Alan Ruck, Mia Sara, Jeffrey Jones, Jennifer Grey\n\n05 of 22\n\nGalaxy Quest (1999)\n\nThe cast of a cult classic sci-fi show becomes unwittingly involved in an actual alien battle in this clever Star Trek-inspired satire. The actors are stunned to realize that the alien race, known as Thermians, have based their way of life on the show's themes (\"Never give up. Never surrender.\") and hope they can help them defeat an enemy.\n\nThe sci-fi comedy was a solid hit with average moviegoers in 1999, while also meeting the approval of diehard Trekkies, who easily could've been the butt of the joke in lesser filmmakers' hands. Plus, while TV show fandom had been around for decades even by 1999, few could've predicted just how prescient of a film Galaxy Quest would be, considering the rise of fan conventions and general fan investment in the mainstream in the 21st century. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Galaxy Quest: Paramount+\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Dean Parisot\n\nCast: Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, Tony Shalhoub, Sam Rockwell, Daryl Mitchell\n\n06 of 22\n\nGladiator (2000)\n\nRidley Scott's brutal, visceral epic stars Russell Crowe as fallen general Maximus, who becomes a gladiator and undertakes a campaign of revenge against those who wronged him. Gladiator, which was compared favorably to the ”sword-and-sandal movies” of the 1950s and '60s, earned rave reviews and multiple Oscars including Best Picture. And we will soon see Scott return to direct Paul Mescal and Denzel Washington in a follow-up installment, 24 years later. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Gladiator: Paramount+\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Ridley Scott\n\nCast: Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, Richard Harris\n\n07 of 22\n\nGrease (1978)\n\nWe've got chills, and they're multiplyin' every time we watch this campy homage to '50s Americana. After greaser Danny Zuko (John Travolta) regales his fellow high schoolers with stories of his summer spent romancing an Australian girl named Sandy (Olivia Newton-John), he's thrilled to find out she's transferred to his school. Though they each remember their summer lovin' differently, the couple explores their relationship further — while occasionally breaking into song when they can't express themselves in words. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Grease: Paramount+\n\nDirector: Randal Kleiser\n\nCast: John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John, Stockard Channing, Eve Arden, Frankie Avalon, Joan Blondell, Edd Byrnes, Sid Caesar, Alice Ghostley, Dody Goodman, Sha Na Na\n\n08 of 22\n\nLast Holiday (2006)\n\nQueen Latifah and LL Cool J share an enviable chemistry in Wayne Wang's sensitive remake of the 1950 British film of the same name. Last Holiday is about 20 percent broad comedy and 80 percent genuine pathos, which turns out to be more successful than you'd think. Latifah plays an unrealized woman who, when diagnosed with a fatal disease and given weeks to live, decides to live it up at a chalet in Europe. It's nothing groundbreaking, but Wang's film has a pleasingly old-school, unhurried essence, and Latifah is always a welcome dramatic presence. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Last Holiday: Paramount+\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Wayne Wang\n\nCast: Queen Latifah, LL Cool J, Giancarlo Esposito, Alicia Witt, Jascha Washington\n\n09 of 22\n\nLove & Basketball (2000)\n\nChildhood friends grow up with a passion for basketball — and each other — in this winning romantic drama from writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewood. Both Monica (Sanaa Lathan) and Quincy (Omar Epps) prove their prowess on the court and finally give in to their feelings for one another before attending the same college. Struggling to balance their professional goals with their relationship, the duo goes through the highs and lows of trying to have it all. What could have been a cliché sports drama is instead an engrossing character study with electric chemistry between Epps and Lathan. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Love & Basketball: Paramount+\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Gina Prince-Bythewood\n\nCast: Omar Epps, Sanaa Lathan, Alfre Woodard, Dennis Haysbert\n\n10 of 22\n\nMean Girls (2004)\n\nA musical update of Mark Waters' seminal high school comedy — following new girl Cady getting inducted into a group of queen bees headed by the ruthless Regina George — is now streaming on Paramount+. But, there's no better time to revisit the original, which has only gotten funnier with age. It's both laugh-out-loud entertaining and a thoughtful exploration of teenage behavior. As EW's critic wrote in 2004 of the Tina Fey-penned comedy, \"The movie — a vinegary fable with a Splenda aftertaste — is a harbinger of hope not only for future feminist comedies of any grit but also for SNL-staffed feature films that don't disproportionately suck.\" —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Mean Girls: Paramount+\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Mark Waters\n\nCast: Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, Amanda Seyfried, Tina Fey, Tim Meadows\n\n11 of 22\n\nMission: Impossible — Fallout (2018)\n\nEvery Mission: Impossible movie is available to stream on Paramount+, but this sixth entry in the film franchise is arguably the best one yet. Fallout centers on IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) in his quest to stop an expected nuclear attack from a terrorist group. He and his team are joined by CIA assassin August Walker (Henry Cavill) to recover plutonium cores on a mission that proves decidedly more difficult than Hunt could ever imagine. Packed with dazzling set pieces and genuinely shocking twists, EW's critic praises the film as \"the kind of pure, straight-no-chaser pop fun that not only keeps taking your breath away over and over again, it restores your occasionally shaky faith in summer blockbusters.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Mission: Impossible — Fallout: Paramount+\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Christopher McQuarrie\n\nCast: Tom Cruise, Henry Cavill, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Sean Harris, Angela Bassett, Vanessa Kirby, Michelle Monaghan, Alec Baldwin\n\n12 of 22\n\nA Quiet Place (2018)\n\nNot advised for those easily startled, A Quiet Place became an instant horror favorite upon its 2018 release. Predatory alien creatures with hypersensitive hearing have overrun Earth, and any sound can be a death sentence for humans. John Krasinski does triple duty as director, co-writer, and star, playing a man living in this postapocalyptic world with his family, who are trying to survive and find a way to fight back. The gripping tension inherent in its premise would be enough to cause anxiety in viewers, but Krasinski proves adept at deploying maximum terror when you're least expecting it. As EW's critic writes, \"When A Quiet Place has one finger on the panic button and the other on mute, it’s a nervy, terrifying thrill.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch A Quiet Place: Paramount+\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: John Krasinski\n\nCast: Emily Blunt, John Krasinski, Millicent Simmonds, Noah Jupe\n\n13 of 22\n\nRed Eye (2005)\n\nWes Craven's stone-cold brilliant B-movie is so good it almost seems like a disservice to call it a B-movie. A case study in films not needing to be long or intricate to be utterly thrilling and highly cinematic, this sub-80-minute genre-hopper finds Rachel McAdams trapped on a plane with a murderous Cillian Murphy. Red Eye moves like a bullet, jumping from disaster movie to psychological two-hander to blazing action and eventually a pretty gnarly stalker-in-the-house sequence. It's ruthlessly structured and quite different from anything else Craven did. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Red Eye: Paramount+\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Wes Craven\n\nCast: Rachel McAdams, Cillian Murphy, Brian Cox, Jayma Mays, Theresa Press-Marx\n\n14 of 22\n\nRocketman (2019)\n\nBiopics about famous singers are rarely hailed for their originality, but this inventive musical drama based on the life of Elton John is an exception. Taron Egerton, in a Golden Globe-winning performance, portrays the legendary musician through his career peaks and valleys, nailing the flamboyant stage persona and the darker private moments fueled by his addictions to drugs and alcohol. Featuring brilliantly staged musical numbers and an eye-catching color palette befitting of its subject, Rocketman is, as EW's critic writes, \"a musical extravaganza anchored less in the real world than in a sort of glittery jukebox Narnia.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Rocketman: Paramount+\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Dexter Fletcher\n\nCast: Taron Egerton, Jamie Bell, Richard Madden, Bryce Dallas Howard\n\n15 of 22\n\nShe's All That (1999)\n\nAnother particularly broad '90s high school comedy (can you tell we love the subgenre?), this one has an admittedly problematic plot at its core. Cool guy Zack (Freddie Prinze Jr.) is dared to date super-not-cool (but, like, artsy and thoughtful and interesting) Lainey (Rachael Leigh Cook). We've all seen the scene where she walks down the stairs newly beautified, and it's easy to roll your eyes at the concept. The chemistry between Prinze and Cook, though, as well as a smart script (polished by none other than M. Night Shyamalan), set this one well apart from the pack. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch She’s All That: Paramount+\n\nEW grade: B– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Robert Iscove\n\nCast: Freddie Prinze Jr., Rachael Leigh Cook, Matthew Lillard, Paul Walker, Anna Paquin\n\n16 of 22\n\nSuper 8 (2011)\n\nInspired by the wonder-filled '80s-era films by Steven Spielberg, Super 8 is a visually striking homage that works even for those who don't have nostalgia for that time period. Set in 1979, the film centers on 14-year-old Joe (Joel Courtney) and his peers as they film a zombie movie with a Super 8 camera. Their filming is interrupted when they witness a truck crash into a train, which soon leads to mysterious events occurring around town. EW's critic praises the film for its \"original storytelling grounded in a sophisticated respect for storytellers who have come before.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Super 8: Paramount+\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nDirector: J.J. Abrams\n\nCast: Elle Fanning, Kyle Chandler, Joel Courtney, Gabriel Basso, Noah Emmerich, Ron Eldard, Riley Griffiths, Ryan Lee, Zach Mills\n\n17 of 22\n\nThere Will Be Blood (2007)\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson weaves an epic tale of greed and corruption in this riveting Western drama. The film charts Daniel Plainview's (Daniel Day-Lewis) rise to power during the oil boom at the turn of the 20th century, stepping on all who helped him get there. Day-Lewis delivers one of his most towering performances as the ruthless baron whose fractured relationship with his son comes back to haunt him in his later days. \"It can hardly be called an 'act,'\" EW's critic writes, \"so fully does the fictional Daniel come alive, with all the fury, hatred, restlessness, and distrust that courses through him.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch There Will Be Blood: Paramount+\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Paul Thomas Anderson\n\nCast: Daniel Day-Lewis, Paul Dano, Kevin J. O'Connor, Ciarán Hinds, Dillon Freasier\n\n18 of 22\n\nTop Gun: Maverick (2022)\n\nJoseph Kosinski's follow-up to Tony Scott's 1986 original is perfect blockbuster entertainment if you can avoid some of the dubious messaging. Tom Cruise returns, this time teaching a pack of new recruits the aerial ropes to fight a war against an unspecified enemy. It's another perfectly structured genre movie that gets by on pure adrenaline but works because you actually believe in the stakes. Knowledge of the first film helps but isn't entirely necessary; as EW's critic observes, the film \"toggles deftly between winking callbacks and standard big-beat action stuff meant to stand on its own.\" —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Top Gun: Maverick: Paramount+\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Joseph Kosinski\n\nCast: Tom Cruise, Miles Teller, Jennifer Connelly, Glen Powell, Val Kilmer\n\n19 of 22\n\nThe Truman Show (1998)\n\nReleased six years after the premiere of MTV's The Real World, the voyeuristic nature of The Truman Show has only made it more relevant in the decades since. Jim Carrey stars as Truman Burbank, a man living a seemingly ordinary existence, unaware he's the subject of a 24/7 reality TV show watched around the world. Also unbeknownst to him is that every person he interacts with is a paid actor, including his closest friends and family. But, after things go slightly off-script from what the producers have planned, Truman starts to realize the nature of his existence. EW's critic calls The Truman Show \"a beautifully sinister and transfixing entertainment-age daydream.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch The Truman Show: Paramount+\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Peter Weir\n\nCast: Jim Carrey, Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich, Natascha McElhone, Holland Taylor, Ed Harris\n\n20 of 22\n\nWorld War Z (2013)\n\nInitially dismissed for its inflated budget and reported reshoots, World War Z ended up as a neat, efficient thriller. Brad Pitt, as United Nations investigator Gerry Lane, goes on a quest to save the world from a zombie apocalypse. (As his homebound wife, Mireille Enos is given pitifully little to do.) The best part of the movie is ironically the reshot portion, a stripped-down stalking sequence in a laboratory that closes the film. \"World War Z turns the prospect of the end of our world into something tumultuous and horrifying and, at the same time, exciting,\" EW's critic writes. \"It's scary good fun.\" —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch World War Z: Paramount+\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Mark Forster\n\nCast: Brad Pitt, Mireille Enos, Daniella Kertesz, Matthew Fox, Elyes Gabel\n\n21 of 22\n\nYoung Adult (2011)\n\nThis angry and weird little movie was made by Jason Reitman after his Oscars hot streak, seeing him reunite with Juno screenwriter Diablo Cody. It's one of Reitman's best films and definitely Cody's most mature, a spiky and risky examination of a former cool girl (Charlize Theron) who returns to her hometown to show everyone how much better than them she is. As EW's critic notes, \"The queasy brilliance of Young Adult lies in the movie's refusal to make Mavis so monstrously crazy that she poses no threat because she’s obviously a cartoon.\" —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Young Adult: Paramount+\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Jason Reitman\n\nCast: Charlize Theron, Patton Oswalt, Patrick Wilson, Elizabeth Reaser, Collette Wolf\n\n22 of 22\n\nZodiac (2007)\n\nThis police-and-journalists procedural charting the still-unsolved crime spree of the Zodiac Killer is director David Fincher's masterpiece. It's certainly the best \"true crime\" movie and, depending on your tolerance for All the President's Men, might be the best journalism movie. Though more factual than many films, Zodiac moves at a rocketing clip and contains at least six sequences of full-blooded terror — Ione Skye on the highway and Jake Gyllenhaal in the basement, to name but two. This is a movie that was well and truly ahead of its time. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Zodiac: Paramount+\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nDirector: David Fincher\n\nCast: Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey Jr., Anthony Edwards, Brian Cox, Elias Koteas, Donal Logue, John Carroll Lynch, Dermot Mulroney"
