        "text": "Basically, the studio system controls everything from production to showing included the actors. Actors who worked with a studio were under contract with that studio and could only act in that studio's production. These contracts were seven years long and forbids the actors from doing any other projects, like radio or television along with regulating the actor’s lives. The studio actors that were under contract were mostly white; minorities did not get much contracted work. The actors were required to act in whatever film they were cast, do publicity for their films, promote product tie-ins and occasionally even be loaned out to other studios for a film or two. The actors were working six days a week and often for about 14 hours a day. It may have been a hectic schedule but they were putting out 10 to 20 films a year. Studios had everyone under contract from the actors to the directors, from the writers to the technical staff. I think there was an up and down side to the studio system. On the good side, all the employees were under contract and everyone was available when they were needed. Films were getting produced at much faster rate than they are today. I would think there would be less conflict between actors and directors because everyone would have to\n\nThe Hollywood studio system was based on the industrial models developed by Henry Ford of the Ford Motor company. This process streamlined the production of the movies, similar to a production line in a factory. As I mentioned in my week 2 DB post, “The motion picture industry was just that, an industry in need of harnessing its work force for profitability”. The process relayed on every member of the production team and became the standardized system of the five major studios during that time period. The studio system allowed the top five studios to almost specialize in their particular genre of film production. It was cost effective to continuously make the same style of movie, from writing similar style scripts, production of similar stage\n\nIn the Paramount decision of 1948 this was the outcome of the United States vs. Paramount Pictures. This was a monumental case in the right of production companies to own theatres and holding exclusive rights on which theatres could show there movies.it would also change the way Hollywood movies were made, distributed, and exhibited in theatres and other places. The court held that this distributing technique was in violation of the antitrust law that was put in place years before. This case is used in vertical integration cases and is later known as the first nail in the coffin of the old Hollywood studio system.\n\nIn addition, the banning of block booking (the mass selling of films to theaters, sometimes before their production had even begun), which in the 30’s and 40’s had propagated a mass of poorly and quickly made films, forced producers to take more care and create better features. In consequence of both of these factors--reduced budgets and reduced quantity--the standard of quality of films rose. No one could afford to make terrible pictures and expect a profit; therefore, the cost of filmmaking dropped and the quality rose, at least relative to the majority of the forgettable features of the studio system. These factors also allowed smaller studios and independent producers to make their own forays into cinema without competing directly with larger\n\nThe Studio System Key point about the studio system could be: Despite being one of the biggest industries in the United States, indeed the World, the internal workings of the 'dream factory' that is Hollywood is little understood outside the business. The Hollywood Studio System: A History is the first book to describe and analyse the complete development, classic operation, and reinvention of the global corporate entities which produce and distribute most of the films we watch. Starting in 1920, Adolph Zukor, head of Paramount Pictures, over the decade of the 1920s helped to fashion Hollywood into a vertically integrated system, a set of economic innovations which was firmly in place\n\nLooking at the film industry as we now know it, it’s hard to imagine that America wasn’t always the film producing machine we see it as now. Yet, when we begin looking at all the technological advances that took place in film over time and the events which occurred during these periods, it was a complex journey. In the following essay we are going to discuss why I believe that the wars faced both foreign and domestic played the biggest factor in the American Film industry’s rise to dominance by the 1950s.\n\nThe company is a film division for a large entertainment conglomerate.
