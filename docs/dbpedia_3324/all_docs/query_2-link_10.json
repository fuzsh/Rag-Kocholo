        "text": "Today marks the launch of Paramount+, the latest major player in the streaming wars conceived by ViacomCBS as a one-stop show for its vast library of films, shows, news, live sports, and more. An adaptation and expansion of CBS All Access, the streaming service arrives with all the programming you came to expect from the old platform, along with an expanded content library featuring thousands of hours of film and television and a robust slate of existing and upcoming original programming.\n\nSo, what can you watch on the service now that it's officially Paramount+, and what can you expect in the weeks and months to come? We're here to break it all down.\n\nHighlights\n\nNew Launch Day titles: At the moment, while it's certainly not going to be the case for long, it's best to look at Paramount+ as an expansion of CBS All Access with a bigger library and wider variety of movies and shows. Plenty of additional original programming is coming, but in terms of brand-new shows to stream at launch, the biggest genre offerings are the long-awaited Spongebob Squarepants: Sponge on the Run feature film finally making its U.S. debut, and the Spongebob prequel series Kamp Koral. So, that's very good news for fans of all things Bikini Bottom.\n\nUpcoming Originals: Though Paramount+ isn't launching with a vast offering of new original programming, that's going to change very soon. In addition to a massive library of content offered at launch, the streamer announced last month that it's working on a wide variety of upcoming new genre projects.\n\nThe Star Trek universe of shows will continue with two new series — the live-action Strange New Worlds and the animated Prodigy — while the long-awaited Halo series is also set to debut on the service, as is a new origin story based in the world of Stephen King's Pet Sematary, a new installment in the Paranormal Activity franchise, and more. Plus, if you're a fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender, you're in luck: Nickelodeon announced last month that it's founded an entire division within in its animation studio just to produce new Avatar stories that'll eventually find a home on Paramount+.\n\nBig Movies: The Paramount+ library of movies is already vast, but the streamer announced last month that we can expect it to expand in the coming months. Thanks to its association with Paramount Pictures, the streamer will get several major upcoming blockbusters, including Mission: Impossible 7 and A Quiet Place Part II, after a short theatrical window of just 30-45 days. Plus, the streamer has partnered with EPIX to begin offering films from various studios, including the James Bond franchise and The Addams Family films, on the service in \"late spring,\" and will continue that partnership to include streaming of upcoming films (including No Time to Die) after their \"exclusive pay television window\" on EPIX has inspired. So, with a little patience, this service will be packed with big movies over the course of the next year.\n\nWhat's streaming right now?\n\nSo, now that we've covered the overview, let's take a look at the sci-fi, fantasy, and horror programming you can watch on Paramount+ today.\n\nMovies\n\nA.I.: Artificial Intelligence\n\nThe Adventures of Tintin\n\nAeon Flux\n\nArea 51\n\nAvalon (2001)\n\nBelow\n\nBeowulf\n\nThe Boy Who Cried Werewolf\n\nCharlie's Angels: Full Throttle\n\nConsole Wars\n\nDown to Earth\n\nDragonslayer\n\neXistenZ\n\nThe Faculty\n\nFairytale: A True Story\n\nFrom Dusk Till Dawn\n\nGhost Town\n\nThe Gift\n\nHalloween: Resurrection\n\nHalloween H20: 20 Years Later\n\nThe Hole\n\nImagine That\n\nIndiana Jones: Raiders of the Lost Ark\n\nIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\n\nIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade\n\nIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\n\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers (1956)\n\nKate & Leopold\n\nLemony Snicket's a Series of Unfortunate Events\n\nLiar, Liar, Vampire\n\nMimic\n\nMinority Report\n\nMission: Impossible\n\nMission: Impossible 2\n\nMission: Impossible 3\n\nMy Bloody Valentine\n\nNeverwas\n\nNext\n\nThe Nutty Professor (1963)\n\nPet Sematary\n\nPet Sematary Two\n\nThe Phantom\n\nPinnochio (2002)\n\nProphecy\n\nThe Ring\n\nThe Ruins\n\nSin City\n\nThe Skull\n\nSmall Soldiers\n\nThe Spongebob Movie: Sponge on the Run\n\nStar Trek IV: The Voyage Home\n\nStar Trek: Generations\n\nStar Trek: First Contact\n\nStar Trek: Nemesis\n\nTales from the Darkside: The Movie\n\nThe Time Machine\n\nThe Traveler\n\nThe Uninvited\n\nVanilla Sky\n\nVirtuosity\n\nWar of the Worlds (1953)\n\nWes Craven Presents: Dracula 2000\n\nThe Wild Thornberrys Movie\n\nYoung Sherlock Holmes\n\nTV Shows\n\nAaahh!!!
