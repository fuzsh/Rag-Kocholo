        "text": "Adolph Zukor (born Jan. 7, 1873, Ricse, Hung.—died June 10, 1976, Los Angeles, Calif., U.S.) was an American entrepreneur who built the powerful Famous Players–Paramount motion-picture studio.\n\nImmigrating to the United States at age 15, Zukor entered the penny-arcade business in 1903. Between 1904 and 1912 he and his partner Marcus Loew controlled a chain of theatres; in 1912 he left Loew, bought the American rights to the British-French motion picture La Reine Elisabeth (Queen Elizabeth, or Queen Beth) starring Sarah Bernhardt, and made a fortune as the film’s exclusive distributor. Zukor then devised the idea of making films featuring Broadway stage actors in their current successes. He formed Famous Players with the slogan “Famous Players in Famous Plays” and made The Count of Monte Cristo and The Prisoner of Zenda. He later hired Mary Pickford to act in motion pictures in Hollywood.\n\n(Read Martin Scorsese’s Britannica essay on film preservation.)\n\nIn 1916 Zukor merged Famous Players with Jesse L. Lasky’s Feature Play Company; Zukor became president and, in 1917, head of Paramount, which was Famous Players–Lasky’s distribution company. In 1935 he became chairman of the board of Paramount Pictures, a figurehead position but one he retained (emeritus) until his death at the age of 103."
