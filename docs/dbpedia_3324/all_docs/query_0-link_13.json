        "text": "Skydance and Paramount are deep into hashing out a complicated deal that would see the David Ellison’s studio and its backers take control of the storied film and television company owned by Shari Redstone. The exclusive month-long negotiating period through May 3 is likely to be extended perhaps by a few weeks, Deadline hears, given the complexity of the transaction. The rough contours of a Skydance deal would see a circa $2 billion payout to Redstone for a majority stake in family holding NAI (which controls Paramount though its voting Class A shares) as well as the National Amusements theater chain and associated real estate assets. Step two would see Paramount acquire Skydance in an all-stock deal valued at circa $4-5 billion. That’s being worked on and will likely wind up at the high end of the range.\n\nApollo wants to add Paramount by subtraction In what is likely the most serious bid so far, Apollo Global Management, Inc. has apparently made an $11 billion offer for ONLY Paramount's studio assets - TV and film. That's a 27% premium on Paramount's current valuation, and the offer leaves out all the company's networks and streamers - CBS, Nickelodeon, Paramount+ & Pluto TV. On one hand, Apollo has just complicated Redstone's life. This is a hard offer to look away from, but it would make it far more difficult to sell the other assets, without the IP that makes up their backbone. On another, this offer shows a valuation that is far closer to the company's actual worth than at the $9 bil Wall Street currently values it. I don't think a deal like the one offered will close. But interest seems to be climbing, and based on this tender, so will Paramount's stock price and value, I imagine. https://lnkd.in/eMtg9ta7\n\nParamount Global (Viacom CBS) controlled by NationalAmusements is more a mess than people realize. This is conglomerate is: Paramount, Showtime, CBS, BET, MTV, CMT, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, Paramount+, Pluto TV. It is preparing for layoffs, maybe a sale, and closing streaming services. ----- Variety: \"Paramount Global Mulling 1,000-Plus Layoffs Amid Shari Redstone’s Talks to Sell Controlling Interest (Report)\" Variety: https://lnkd.in/giYsJFwf ----- YahooFinance: \"Shari Redstone Weighs Sale of Stake in Paramount Global\" (Thomas Buckley & Michelle F. Davis) (Dec 12, 2023 at 6:33 AM PST·3 \"Redstone has held talks with Hollywood producer David Ellison, and RedBird Capital Partners, about an acquisition of her family’s stake in the business, according to people familiar with the matter. A buyer of Redstone’s stake could generate $13.5 billion by selling Paramount’s TV networks, including CBS and Showtime, according to Wells Fargo & Co.’s Steven Cahall. The remaining businesses, including the Paramount Pictures film studio and production operations behind shows like the hit TV series Yellowstone, could be worth $19 billion, or around $23 a share, he said . Shares of Paramount were down about 1% Tuesday morning in New York at $16.09. Proceeds from asset sales would be used to reduce Paramount’s $15.6 billion in long-term debt by two-thirds. Cahall’s analysis also envisions new owners closing the Paramount+ streaming service, which is projected to lose $1.6 billion this year. Whether a sale actually occurs is in the hands of Redstone, who is Paramount’s chairperson and controls 77% of the voting shares through a family holding company, National Amusements Inc. The websites Deadline and Puck reported on the talks last week. Activision Blizzard Inc. CEO Bobby Kotick, who is leaving that company at the end of the month, has also held talks with Redstone about a potential sale, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. The newspaper also said Paramount is considering layoffs of 1,000 workers early next year. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment on any job cuts.

The theatrical revenue was short of $1B. Some things this data makes me consider: - I didn't realize how little revenue came from the films that these production dynasties compared to the full picture of their offerings. - Paramount has always been a top creator of films in my eyes, but the shift to streaming has made them change focuses slightly. Here are just a few films Paramount produced, helped produce, or distributed in 2023 that make this number surprising to me. The existing IPs of many of these films are so valuable, so it may point toward moviegoers looking for less sequels/original concepts. Transformers: Rise of the Beasts (co-produced with Skydance, Hasbro and others) Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves (co-produced with Entertainment One, Hasbro and others) Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (studio credit, co-production with The Walt Disney Company and others) Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One (co-produced with Skydance and others) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (co-produced with Nickelodeon and others) Killers of the Flower Moon (co-produced with Apple and others) For comparison, Disney had box office revenues of $1.89B (Statista) in 2023. There's more revenue in TV for Paramount than there is in Films at the moment. Is Paramount putting too many of their eggs into this basket? Looking at this from a bidders perspective, do you make a plan to grow the film category? #film #streamingwars #paramount\n\nFrom THR: The Wall Street Journal reported that Apollo Global Management, Inc. made an $11 billion offer just for #Paramount’s #film and television studio. That is higher than the company’s $7.7 billion market cap when the story was published, and the deal reportedly does not include Paramount’s other business lines, like CBS , BET or the former Viacom cable channels. The fate of Paramount has been the talk of #Hollywood in recent months, with a number of potential bidders circling the company, as well as National Amusements, the Redstone family company that has a controlling stake. Gerry Cardinale of RedBird Capital Partners and David Ellison of Skydance have held talks with National Amusements about buying that company (and thus gaining control of Paramount), while Byron Allen made a very public $14 billion bid for the entire company, albeit without financing details. Apollo’s bid is likely to be taken more seriously, with financing unlikely to be a problem. The question is what to do with the remaining businesses: Will there be buyers for the linear #TV networks or Paramount+? Perhaps Warner Bros. Discovery would make a play for CBS? Paramount Pictures\n\nNEWS OF THE DAY! Paramount's Potential Breakup: Sony and Apollo's $26 Billion Bid Sparks Regulatory Rumble 1.Paramount Global, a big entertainment company, might get split up if Sony Pictures Entertainment and Apollo Global Management buy it as per a report. 2.The plan involves selling CBS broadcast network, Paramount's cable channels, and its streaming service, Paramount+. 3.Paramount Pictures would join Sony's movie studio, while Sony and Apollo would keep Paramount's TV shows, movies, and intellectual property. 4.Sony and Apollo haven't discussed this plan with Paramount yet. 5.Shari Redstone, who owns Paramount, might not like the idea, but it's not a deal-breaker. 6.Splitting up Paramount could make it easier for the deal to pass regulations, especially because U.S. laws might not allow Sony to own a broadcast network entirely. 7.Paramount is also thinking about sharing its financial details with Sony and Apollo, which could help with their $26 billion buyout offer. =>Please follow Finplate and stay updated with the latest #mergersandacquisitions news.
