        "text": "From the gorgeous scenery to the rich history, Scotland has so much to offer to visitors.\n\nThe Scottish culture and big personalities of the people throughout the country are amongst the many unique and appealing aspects of our bonnie wee bit of land.\n\nBut if you dive a little deeper, you may find out about things you did not already know.\n\nWhether it be Nessie's lesser-known counterpart Morag or William Wallace's real nickname, Scotland's history is full of surprises.\n\nNot to mention the facts about our iconic ginger hair...\n\nTo celebrate all things Scottish and quirky, here are some of the best hidden facts about the country...\n\n1. Scotland’s national animal is a unicorn.\n\nBecause mythical creatures can be national animals too, you know.\n\n2. Scotland has the highest proportion of redheads in the world.\n\nAround 13 per cent of the population has red hair.\n\n3. Scots are most likely to have blue eyes than people in the rest of the UK.\n\nThe South East of Scotland has the highest proportion of blue-eyed residents at 57 per cent.\n\n4.
