        "text": "Donald “Don” Weiszhaar, 79, of Warner, SD, passed away Wednesday, January 25, 2023, at Avera St. Luke’s Hospital, Aberdeen, SD.\n\nFuneral Services will be 10:00 a.m., Saturday, February 25, 2023, at Schriver’s Memorial Chapel, Aberdeen. A time of fellowship and luncheon will follow the service at Schriver's Memorial Fellowship Center. Burial will be at Sunset Memorial Gardens at a later date.\n\nVisitation will be 4-6 p.m., Friday, February 24, at the mortuary with a prayer service at 6 p.m. Visitation continues one hour before the service at the mortuary.\n\nSchriver’s Memorial Mortuary and Crematory, 414 5th Avenue NW, Aberdeen, is in charge of arrangements. Family and friends may sign the online guestbook and also view the service at www.schriversmemorial.com.\n\nDonald “Don” James Weiszhaar was born December 12, 1943, in Mobridge SD, to Christ and Viola (Sieler) Weiszhaar. Don was a very small baby and was brought home in a cigar box and slept in a dresser drawer. He lived in Java, SD, before moving to Aberdeen in 1950 where he attended Adams School. Don graduated from Aberdeen Central High School in 1962.\n\nAfter graduating, Don drove a beer delivery truck and then worked on the Milwaukee Railroad as a carman (welding). He was injured when cutting trees for firewood and had to retire from the railroad. Don helped his mom and step-brothers (Hanlon Brothers) on and off working in the gravel pit and driving truck.\n\nDon and his family spent many summers with his in-laws in Seneca, SD, helping work on the farm. Farming was new to Don at first, but it became very clear that this was something that he enjoyed doing as he continued to help and work for other friends/farmers his entire life. This led to him meeting many lifelong friends.\n\nDon married Yvonne Bryant on February 25, 1967, in Aberdeen, SD. They had two children, Rhonda and Kyle. The couple lived in Aberdeen, SD, then moved the family to Warner, SD, in 1976, to a home that Don built, that he resided in at the time of his passing.\n\nDon enjoyed hunting, especially pheasants and deer hunting. He loved to take his children, grandchildren, and their friends hunting and fishing. Don also loved attending and watching his children's and grandchildren’s activities. He was very proud of his grandchildren for their accomplishments in life. Don always had a smile on his face and enjoyed joking and making people laugh. When his grandchildren arrived, they started calling him “Pops,” which then the grandchildren’s friends and others began calling him.\n\nGrateful for having shared Don’s life are his daughter, Rhonda (Steve Gunckel) Nelson, of Redfield, SD; son, Kyle (Lisa Mitzel) Weiszhaar, of Aberdeen, SD; grandchildren: Trevor (Brittani Brick) Nelson of Aberdeen, SD, and Trissa (Hiatt Toney) Nelson of Denver, CO; two brothers, Jerome “Butch” (Joan) Weiszhaar and Scott Hanlon; and many nieces and nephews. He also loved his grandpuppy, Topper, as he lived with him for many years.\n\nDon was preceded in death by his parents; his wife of 54 years, Yvonne; three brothers: Darrell Weiszhaar, Lyle Weiszhaar, and Guy Hanlon; two sisters, Joell Snider, and Luci Weiszhaar; and nephew Brandon Weiszhaar.\n\nThe family prefers casual dress. Condolences and monetary donations can be sent to Rhonda Nelson at 931 E 2nd St, Redfield, SD, 57469."
