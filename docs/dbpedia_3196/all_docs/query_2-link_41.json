        "text": "The “Gaelic Bible” Stewarts in Killin, Perthshire, Scotland\n\nBranch VII of the Stewarts of Glenbuckie\n\nThe information on this page has not been updated since 2010.\n\nIt has been copy/pasted from our old Rootsweb site.\n\nLinks below may be out-of-date.\n\nAncestry.com is shutting down access to all old Rootsweb sites starting January 2024, so we have had to hastily copy this information here before we lose access to our old site.\n\nOur volunteers are in the process of updating the information on this page. We cannot provide a timeline for when this page will be updated as it depends entirely on volunteer labour availability.\n\nVII Branch – The Stewarts “of the Gaelic Bible”\n\nThe Stewarts “of the Gaelic Bible” were a cadet branch of theStewarts of Glenbuckie. Please refer to the Glenbuckie page for a full introduction. This family also had one cadet line who resided in Duart in Glen Finglas. Please refer to theStewarts in Glen Finglas page for a full introduction to the Glen Finglas Stewarts.\n\nIn Killin, Perthshire, Scotland\n\nBranch VII of the Stewarts of Glenbuckie is responsible for making one of the greatest contributions to Highland Gaelic culture ever: the translation of the Holy Bible into Scots Gaelic.\n\nStewarts of the South gives no name or designation for this branch. Rather than calling them “the un-named branch” we have decided to refer to them asThe Stewarts “of the Gaelic Bible” in honour of the contributions of two of this family: Rev. James Stewart of Killin and his son, Rev. Dr. John Stewart of Luss, who translated the Bible into Gaelic.\n\nThe line headings below for this branch are not present in the originalStewarts of the South document and have been added in order to make the distinction between lines clearer.\n\nThe original author ofStewarts of the South does not give any indication as to how this branch connects to the main Glenbuckie line. No patriarch is given. It is just claimed that the following branch descends from Glenbuckie.\n\nThe First Gaelic Bible\n\nThe New Testament was first translated into Scot’s Gaelic byRev. James Stewart of Killin in 1767. The Old Testament was later translated by his son,Rev. Dr. John Stewart of Luss, both of whom are of this branch of the Stewarts of Glenbuckie. The following article from Electric Scotland describes the process in more detail:\n\nIt was in every way desirable that a correct translation of theGaelic Bible should be provided for the use of theHighlands, and this was finally undertaken by the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge. The person employed to perform the work was theRev. James Stewart of Killin, a man fully qualified for it, and although his translation retained too much ofthe Irish dialect of O’Donnell’s Irish New Testament, it was welcomed as a highly creditable work, and as a great boon to theHighlands. Many minor changes have been made in theGaelic New Testament of 1767, but it has been the basis of all subsequent editions which have sought merely to render certain portions of the work more idiomatic and pleasing to a Scottish ear. The publishing of this version ofthe New Testament proved a great benefit to theHighlands.\n\nSoon after the publication ofthe New Testament, it was resolved that the Old Testament should be translated intoGaelic also. This work, like the former, was undertaken by the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge, assisted by a collection made throughout the congregations of the Church of Scotland amounting to ï¿½1483. The principal translator employed was theRev. Dr. John Stewart of Luss, son of the translator ofthe New Testament, who translated three portions of the work, while a fourth portion, including the Prophets, was executed by the Rev. Dr. Smith of Campbellton, the accomplished editor of the Sean Dana. The whole work was completed and published in the year 1801. This work has been of incalculable service to theHighlands, and is one of the many benefits conferred upon that portion of the country by the excellent Society who undertook it. Objections have been taken to the many Irish idioms introduced into the language, and the extent to whichthe Irish orthography was followed, but these are minor faults, and the work itself is entitled to all commendation. —http://www.electricscotland.com/history/literat/gaelicb.htm\n\n1 Line – In Duart in Glen Finglas\n\nLine 1 of this branch is described inStewarts of the South as follows:\n\nDuncan Stewart, late tenant in Duart in Glenfinglas & Coirchrom, by [the] Earl of Murray’s estate, had a numerous family, none of which survived him except two sons of three marriages.\n\nDuncan has not been identified in any public documents.\n\n2 Line – In Killin\n\nLine 2 of this branch is described inStewarts of the South as follows:\n\nThe late pious and worthy Reverend Mr James Stewart, Minister of Killin. (A later entry is moved forward to here for continuity.) The Reverend Mr James Stewart had three sons [who lived to adulthood]: John Peter & James\n\nDr John Stewart, Minister of Luss [on] Lochlomondside. He cannot be called a bad man, but has a good deal of unsociable pride, which no minister should have, as their doctrine is humility and charity, which many of them preach and fewer practice. Dr Stewart hath one son:\n\nJoseph\n\nThe Reverend Patrick Stewart, Minister of Killin, who I believe the best before this pedantic coxcomb\n\nJames, a half pay Officer at Croftandeoran near Killin\n\nDonald a manufacturer in Glasgow who died a young man\n\na Thomas who died young also\n\nMrs MacLaggan a real Phoenix.(This is a reference to James’ daughter Catherine who married Rev. James MacLagan, Minister of Blair Atholl. This represents one of the very few references to a daughter in the entirety ofStewarts of the South.)\n\nDonald, his brother, [a] tacksman of Shibhrigh [in the] Breas of Doune [on the] Earl of Murray’s [estate].\n\nDavid Stewart, tacksman [in the] Braes [of] Doune [on] Murray’s estate was brother to the Revd Jas Stewart. [David had] three sons:\n\nDonald, a wright, [who] went to the island of Colossa where he married and became Bowman or Arroch to ?Ardsheal. His wife nursed some children to ?Ardsheal and became a favourite of that family. [They] had three sons:\n\nJames, a quartermaster and Lieutenant in the 91st Regiment — a decent well looking man\n\nAlexander, a manufacturer in Paisley\n\nJohn in the family line in Collosa with his father\n\nDuncan, the wright, a famous character [who] married against his inclinations [and] began drinking and died. [He] left no sons, but some daughters\n\nJohn, [who had] something of Dr Stewart’s character. [John was] a workman to Lord Doune [and] was seized with a palsy [and now] lives near Doune Lodge. [He has] two pecks of meal per week from the Earl of Murray.\n\nThe author ofStewarts of the South then concludes his description of this branch with the following comment: “This finishes that worthy family of whom few clans can boast of such characters.”\n\nWe account for this branch as follows:\n\nUnknown STEWART, b ABT 1670 in Perthshire, Scotland. The accounting of Branch VII of the Stewarts of Glenbuckie begins with three brothers: James, Donald and David whose father is not identified.\n\nRev. James STEWART Minister of Killin b: 1701 in Perthshire, Scotland. James is described inStewarts of the South as: “The late pious and worthy Reverend Mr James Stewart, Minister of Killin. The Reverend Mr James Stewart had three sons [who lived to adulthood]: John Peter & James.”\n\nJames is described in theFasti Ecclesia, Volume 4,as: “James Stuart, born 1701, licensed by the Presbytery of Dunblane 3rd July 1733; assistant at Weem; presented by John, Earl of Breadalbane, in 1736; ordained 23rd March 1737; died 30th June 1789. He translated the New testament into Gaelic, and began a translation of the Old Testament which was finished by his son, minister of Luss. there is a public monument to him in Killin. He married 23rd June 1742, Elizabeth Drummond, who died 22nd Feb. 1796 and had issue — John, DD, minister of Luss, born 31st July 1743; Thomas, born 5th April 1745; Patrick, minister of this parish [Killin]; Elizabeth, born 28th April 1748; James, born 28th April 1751; Donald, born 13th Jan. 1754; Catherine, born 29th April 1756, (married James McLagan, minister of Blair Atholl). Publication – Tiomadh Nuadh ar Tighearna* (Duneudain**, 1767, and in 1796 the editio princeps of the New Testament in Gaelic).” * New Testament; ** Edinburgh.\n\nJames’ accomplishments in translating the New Testament into Gaelic are described in the following article:\n\nIt was in every way desirable that a correct translation of the Gaelic Bible should be provided for the use of the Highlands, and this was finally undertaken by the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge.

Her birth family is unknown. They had the following children:\n\nRev. Dr.John STUART D.D. Minister of Luss b: 31 JUL 1743 in Killin, Perthshire, Scotland. John is described inStewarts of the South as: “Dr John Stewart, Minister of Luss [on] Lochlomondside. He cannot be called a bad man, but has a good deal of unsociable pride, which no minister should have, as their doctrine is humility and charity, which many of them preach and fewer practice. Dr Stewart hath one son Joseph.”\n\nJohn is described in theFasti Ecclesia Volume 3, for the parish of Luss in Dunbarton: “JOHN STUART, born 31st July 1743, son of James S., min. of Killin ; licen. by Presb. of Edinburgh 27th Feb. 1771; ord. to Arrochar 12th May 1774 ; trans, to Weem 2nd May 1776 ; pres. by Sir James Colquhoun of Luss, Bart., Nov. 1776 ; trans, and adm. 27th Aug. 1777; D.D.

She died at age 15, just a few months after her younger sister.\n\nSusan MACLAGAN b: 02 JUN 1822 presumably in Auchtergaven, Perthshire, Scotland, although no record of her birth has been found. Susan died at age 12, just a few months prior to her older sister.\n\nRev. Joseph STUART b: 25 MAR 1798 in Luss, Dunbarton, Scotland. Joseph Stuart, born 24th March 1798, only son of John S., DD, minister of Luss; educated at University of Glasgow; licensed by the Presbytery of Dunbarton 3rd Dec 1822; presented by John, Marquess of Bute, in January and ordained (at Scoulaig) 11th May 1825; died unmarried 1st Sept. 1826.

Patrick is described inStewarts of the South as: “The Reverend Patrick Stewart, Minister of Killin, who I believe the best before this pedantic coxcomb.” The “pedantic coxcomb” is believed to refer to the author ofStewarts of the South himself. Patrick is described in theFasti Ecclesia as: “Patrick Stuart, born 2nd April 1747, son of preceding; licensed by the Presbytery 6th October 1778; presented by John, Earl of Breadalbane in June and ordained (assistant and successor) 27th October 1779; died 18th May 1795.

James is described inStewarts of the South as: “James, a half pay Officer at Croftandeoran near Killin.” James has not been identified in any later records. It is not known if he married or had children, butStewarts of the South makes no mention of such, so it is presumed that he did not.\n\nElizabeth STEWART (twin) b: 28 APR 1751 in Killin, Perthshire, Scotland. Elisabeth was a twin with her brother James.\n\nDonald STEWART b: 13 JAN 1754 in Killin, Perthshire, Scotland.

Catherine is described inStewarts of the South as: “Mrs MacLaggan a real Phoenix.” This represents one of the very few references to a woman in the entirety ofStewarts of the South. She must have been quite a character for the author to have deemed her to be worth mentioning in what is otherwise a strictly patriarchal accounting!

David is described inStewarts of the South as: “David Stewart, tacksman [in the] Braes [of] Doune [on] Murray’s estate was brother to the Revd Jas Stewart. [David had] three sons.”\n\nDonald STEWART b: ABT 1740 in Doune, Kilmadock, Perthshire, Scotland. Donald is described inStewarts of the South as: “1 Donald, a wright, [who] went to the island of Colossa (Colonsay?, Argyll and Bute off Islay and Jura) ) where he married and became Bowman or Arroch to ?Ardsheal.
