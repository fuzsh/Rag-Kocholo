He was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1981.\n\nWhile still in college at Penn State, Core began work as a coal miner with Hillman Coal and Coke Company. In 1938 he joined Pittsburgh Coal Company as an engineer, rising through the ranks of a chief mining engineer and divisional engineer. He joined Buckeye Coal Company in 1947 as chief engineer of coal mines and later served as chief engineer for Island Creek Coal Company in Holden, West Virginia. In 1951 he joined the Frick District of United States Steel Corporation as a district mining engineer, advancing to chief engineer and general superintendent of the Frick District. In 1958 he was named vice president in charge of coal operations for U.S. Steel Corporation, including operations in Alabama, Colorado, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah and West Virginia.\n\nHe retired in 1976 and became an adjunct professor of mining engineering at Penn State. His citations for both honorary membership in AIME and for the Erskine Ramsay Medal emphasized two major hallmarks for his career: promoting mine safety and assisting younger engineers to develop their full potential. Under his leadership, U.S. Steel developed a well-respected, comprehensive coal mine safety program. The lead article in the Wall Street Journal for January 19, 1973, cited U.S. Steel and Core for establishing the best safety record in underground coal mines. Core continually stressed that a safe mine was also a very productive mine. He was also known to be a strong mentor and an excellent role model for young professionals. This was manifested not only at the corporate level but also by his service as an active member of the Old Timer’s Club, which gives yearly awards to outstanding seniors in mining engineering at many of the country’s leading universities. His assistance as an adjunct professor at Penn State is another example of his desire to help younger engineers.\n\nHe was active in many professional societies and groups, including the SME Coal Division of the American Mining Congress and was a past president of the Coal Mining Institute of American and of the Mine Inspectors Institute of America. He was co-founder and first chairman of the Keystone Bituminous Coal Association, a member of the National Mine Rescue Association, the American Iron and Steel Institute, and the Rocky Mountain Coal Mining Institute. He was a registered first-grade coal mine foreman. Core was the king engineer who was interested in many phases of engineering. This interest quickly translated into a love of railroads and railroading and the history of coal mining, geology, and Native American art. Core donated his collections of minerals and paintings of mining scenes to the Penn State’s Earth and Mineral Sciences Museum.\n\nCore was active in the Boy Scouts of America, chairman of the Catholic Committee for Scouting for the Diocese of Pittsburgh and received the Silver Beaver and the St. George Awards for his service to Scouting. He was appointed to President Carter’s Commission on Coal at Penn State.\n\nInducted\n\n2018\n\nEducation\n\nBS Mechanical Engineering, Purdue University\n\nMS Mechanical Engineering, Purdue University\n\nInitiated Chapter\n\nPurdue, 1927\n\nFamily\n\nWife: Stella; Children: Ann & Janice\n\nExperience\n\nNorris “Buck” Crump was a railway executive born into a railway family. Crump began with the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) as a laborer in 1920. He finished high school in night classes and took a leave of absence in 1926 to earn a railway mechanical-engineering degree at Indiana’s Purdue University. He graduated in 1929 and in 1936 received a master’s degree.\n\nCrump was hired back as a night foreman and advanced through various jobs until his combination of hard-rock experience, engineering skill and business talent paid off with the top vice-presidency in 1949.\n\nCrump was especially interested in the new diesel electric engines, and it was becoming clear that the railway would have to confront “dieselization.” Crump was promoted through the CPR’s engineering departments and, as a senior executive, was responsible for the transcontinental flagship train, the Canadian.\n\nHe became president in 1955 and chairman in 1961. Under Crump, Canadian ownership of company stock rose from 15% in 1955 to 55% in 1965 and 63% in 1972. In 1962 Crump diversified the company by forming Canadian Pacific Investments to handle non-transport investments. He retired as president in 1964 and as chairman in 1972.\n\nIn 1971 he became a Companion of the Order of Canada. During his life he received 7 honorary degrees and was director of numerous companies and charitable foundations. He was a governor of the Canadian Association for Latin America and a life governor of the Montreal General Hospital.

Hassebroek has been instrumental in developing newer and better systems for wastewater treatment and hazardous waste disposal.\n\nA 1963 graduate of the University of Wisconsin-Madison in civil engineering, Hassebroek joined CH2M HILL, Inc., a small consulting engineering firm in Corvallis, Oregon, the same year. Hassebroek joined CH2M HILL’s Seattle office in 1965, and moved into positions of increasing responsibility, becoming regional manager of that office in 1978.\n\nWhile in Seattle, Hassebroek organized CH2M HILL’s first environmental sciences work, including its first water quality laboratory. He also helped develop improved waste treatment systems for several Washington cities and developed water quality studies for area watersheds.\n\nIn the mid 1970s, Hassebroek returned temporarily to his home state of Wisconsin to direct a wastewater treatment and sludge utilization program for the Madison Metropolitan Sewerage District. This program, which uses sludge as fertilizer for local farmers, has served as a model for cities and utilities across the nation.\n\nHassebroek was promoted to CH2M HILL’s Northwest District Manager in 1980 and Eastern District Manager in 1983, the latter appointment taking him to Atlanta, Georgia, where he was responsible for company operations in 22 states. He became active in CH2M HILL’s hazardous waste services which have included projects involving the EPA Superfund Program and the DOE Environmental Restoration Program.\n\nIn 1990, after 27 years with the company, Hassebroek became president of CH2M HILL, Inc., headquartered in Denver. As president, he was responsible for the overall operations of a consulting engineering firm with more than 4,000 employees in over 50 locations throughout the U.S. Lyle retired in 1996 following a long and extremely productive career.\n\nThe scrapbook created by coworkers emphasized his mentoring, giving encouragement and guidance with a genuine interest in each individual. One of the firm leaders said, “a person can learn skills for being a top-notch engineer but leadership must be learned as well as earned and implemented with the heart.” This was Lyle’s strength.\n\nBefore and after retirement, Lyle welcomed continued connection to the University of Wisconsin and was honored for his work on “Institute for Environmental Studies-Board of Visitors 1995–2000.” Also, the College of Engineering presented an award to him as a member of “VISION 2000 Committee.”\n\nInducted\n\n2018\n\nEducation\n\nBS Ceramic Engineering, The Ohio State University, 1961\n\nPhD Ceramic Engineering, The Ohio State University, 1964\n\nInitiated Chapter\n\nOhio State, 1957\n\nFamily\n\nWife: June, Children- John, Deborah\n\nExperience\n\nDr. Hench’s ceramics research was focused initially on structural ceramics for radiation and nuclear waste applications. These early experiments were the foundation of the subfield of bioactive materials and led to the coining of the term bioactive glass.\n\nAfter serving 32 years on the faculty of the University of Florida, he “retired” as emeritus professor and in 1996 joined Imperial College London as chair of its Ceramic Materials Department. At Imperial College, his contributions to the fields of science, engineering, and medicine flourished and expanded, as he co-founded, with Julia Polak, the Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine Centre, and was its co-director. In 2008 he established, through the London Materials Society, the annual June Wilson Memorial Award to commemorate his late wife’s achievements in the field of biomedical materials research. In 2011 Imperial College London established the Larry Hench Award for best Ph.D. in Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering.\n\nLarry returned to the United States after a decade at Imperial College.

With over 80,000,000 units sold by 1970, there were few American households without an Instamatic.\n\nIn the 1970’s, Peterson was principally responsible for many of the innovations that made possible the “point and shoot” camera revolution. Automatic focus, off-the-film metering, auto advance and built-in self-quenching flash: all were brand-new and all were featured on the “Project Beehive” camera developed by Peterson and his team and introduced by Honeywell at Photokina in 1972. The technologies from the “beehive” camera continue to resonate throughout the photography, digital photography, cinematography and video industries.\n\nFor his accomplishments in the field, Dean was one of four named Fellows of the Society of Photographic Scientists and Engineers in 1975. He also received accolades from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers and the Society of Plastic Engineers. He received the Distinguished Alumni Award from SDSM&T in 2000 and was posthumously named to the Aberdeen Central High School Hall of Fame in only the second year of its existence in 2007.\n\nBut his influence went well beyond the photography business. He was personally responsible for the development two of most successful products in the history of Fisher-Price Toys: their childproof audiocassette recorder and phonograph, both introduced in the 1980s. He designed a number of important advanced products for the medical industry, and developed a variety of patented methods for improving manufacturing processes, saving manufacturers hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of his career. He developed the first and only successful 3D consumer film camera, the first high-speed video camera for scientific motion analysis, and provided the mechanical design for the world’s first tablet computer. Overall, nearly 80 patents bear his name.\n\nThroughout his life, Dean’s passions were fly-fishing and golf, and he invented advanced products for both. Perhaps his all-time favorite invention was the Morgan Reel™, a single-action fly reel featuring a unique, infinitely-variable drag mechanism which can never be damaged by sand or grit, superior ergonomics, and the ability to operate either with the characteristic “click” familiar in most fly reels or completely silently.\n\nActivities & Associations\n\nElder, Presbyterian Church\n\nFellow, Society of Photographic Scientists & Engineers\n\n2000 Distinguished Alumnus Award, South Dakota Mines & Technology\n\nInducted 2012\n\nEducation\n\nBS Electrical Engineering, Northwestern University, 1944\n\nMS Electrical Engineering, Northwestern University, 1947\n\nPhD Physics, Northwestern University, 1950\n\nInitiated Chapter\n\nNorthwestern, 1943\n\nFamily\n\nChildren: Pamela\n\nExperience\n\nDr. Richard Petritz started his career as a professor at Catholic University and at a Navy research lab.

While in that position Dr. Petritz supervised over 300 technical personnel and, as deputy director, oversaw Jack Kilby and the invention of the Integrated Circuit.\n\nIn 1969 he and a TI colleague formed New Business Resources, the first U.S. venture capital company to focus exclusively on start-up, high-technology businesses. Dr. Petritz went on to serve as President of two companies: Mostek which developed DRAM memories and some of the earliest microprocessors to be commercially available; and Linolex Systems, recognized by the Boston Computing Society as the first true personal computer. Dr. Petritz then provided the seed capital to start Inmos, a Colorado Springs-based semiconductor company. Inmos grew to $144,000,000 in sales and was sold to Thorn EMI, then again to ST Microelectronics.\n\nUpon his exit from Inmos, he formed New Venture Resources and founded Simtek Corporation, of which he managed until his retirement in 1998. His venture capital activities spanned three decades and 21 companies.

Storm knows a thing or two about setting the standard for others to follow. Maybe that is why John has been honored by everyone from Purdue University to the Society of Manufacturing Engineering.\n\nIn his first professional job out of the box, John’s innovations resulted in corporate annual savings of $6,000,000. That’s right, 6 million dollars. In 1977, John started working as a process metallurgist for Detroit Diesel Allison, a division of General Motors. John was in charge of testing a furnace the size of a small building. The result was John being on the edge of creating a new industry standard for furnace applications. John created a furnace application utilizing a methanol nitrogen atmosphere, which saved GM over 6 million dollars per year.\n\nAfter that savings, John was provided a small staff and given the opportunity to work on whatever project he wanted to. John decided to begin with creating an advanced computer-controlled heat treating process for gears. This process eventually became the Micropulse Process, which GM declined to patent. So in 1986, John and GM gear specialist Mike Chapin decided to patent the Micropulse Process and go it alone and created Contour Hardening Inc. Their goal for their company was to create a cost-effective solution to difficult heat treatment applications.\n\nDuring the first five years of their business, they did not sell a single one of their large expensive machines. In fact, John estimates losing between three and four million dollars. But in 1990, Contour Hardening sold its first system to an overseas transmission manufacturer. The rest fell into place from there. Between June 1995 and January 1997, Contour Hardening Inc. had a 300% growth period. In 2002, sales were $11 million.\n\nThis married father of two is also an avid race enthusiast and in 1997, for the first time in racing history, advanced hardening and process control technology was used, resulting in a first and second place win at the Indianapolis 500! Arie Luyendyk crossed the finish line first and Scott Goodyear crossed second, both, using Contour Hardening’s patented gears, which are stronger, lighter than and twice as strong as the industry standards.
