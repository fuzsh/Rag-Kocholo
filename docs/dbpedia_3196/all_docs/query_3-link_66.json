        "text": "Rabbie\n\nPosted on 30 Jan 2017\n\nBurns Night traditions can vary from household to household. But what makes the event truly Scottish?\n\nYou may not be from Auchenshuggle.\n\nAnd you probably don’t eat a Scotch egg for breakfast, play the bagpipes every day, and have Irn Bru pumping through your veins.\n\nBut it doesn’t matter when it comes to Burns Night traditions.\n\nBecause no matter where you’re from, you can enjoy Burns Night like a true Scotsman.\n\nIn fact, the people of Scotland would be honoured if you celebrated Burns Night like a true Scotsman.\n\nSo, read this helpful guide and learn how to have an amazing Burns Night full of honorary traditions.\n\nWhy the Scottish Celebrate Burns Night with Traditions\n\nScottish people celebrate this yearly event simply because they love Robert Burns. In a time without television, his poetry and stories entertained thousands of people. His works showed sincerity and spoke to the common person in a way that other expensively educated poets didn’t.\n\nAnd at Rabbie’s, we especially love this tradition of celebrating Burns Night. In 1993, we named ourselves ‘Rabbie’s’ because we believed the poet was good at a lot of the things we do: storytelling, travelling, being overly romantic about places and enjoying ourselves.\n\nEssential Burns Night Facts\n\nTo be able to celebrate Burns Night with traditional Scottish fashion, you’ll want to brush up on your knowledge. It’s embarrassing when you go to a birthday party and don’t know whose birthday it is.\n\nAnd it’s the same with Burns Night. You’ll avoid humiliation by having a few things to say when a tartan-clad MacStuart asks you ‘what ye know about Burns?’.\n\nSo, here are some quick facts about Robert Burns that you may want to remember.\n\nHe was born on 25th January 1759, in Ayrshire\n\nBurns Night is traditionally celebrated on Robert Burns's birthday\n\nHe died at the age of 37, after dental surgery\n\nHe wrote Auld Lang Syne, which is sung at New Year all over the world\n\nHe had at least 13 children with four women\n\n10,000 people attended his funeral\n\nHis poems addressed love, inequality, and patriotism\n\nUnderstanding the Ceremony\n\nTraditionally, a lot of families just have a small dinner with family, friends, and poetry readings. But if you manage to infiltrate a true Scottish Burns Night, you’ll find out that it’s quite a formal ceremony.\n\nHere’s how the traditional Burns Night ceremony may pan out.\n\nDressing for the Occasion\n\nBurns Night events can be informal or formal. And if it’s formal, it means the men will be in kilts and the women will be in dresses. But don’t worry if you don’t have a kilt, because the Scottish are never too strict about clothing!\n\nHow the Ceremony Starts\n\nIf you are attending a traditional Burns Night celebration, you’ll hear the bagpipes playing as you arrive (probably playing from Spotify or YouTube, if you’re hosting it yourself!). Then the host will welcome the guests. And once everyone has sat down, someone or everyone will say the Selkirk Grace, which is a Scottish thanksgiving that was once said before meals.\n\nThe Selkirk Grace is:\n\nSome hae meat an\n\ncanna eat,\n\nAnd some wad eat that want it;\n\nBut we hae meat, and we can eat,\n\nAnd sae let the Lord be thankit\n\nThe Meal\n\nAfter the grace is said, the haggis will be brought out while a bagpipe tune is playing, and the Burns’ poem, Address to a Haggis, will be said.\n\nThe traditional meal is haggis, potatoes, turnips in a whisky cream sauce. Don’t be surprised when you hear people mention ‘haggis, neeps, and tatties’, you can find many excellent recipes, but we like this traditional Burns Night menu.\n\nIf you’re vegetarian or vegan, you don’t need to worry, because vegetarian haggis is scrumptious. We love this vegan haggis recipe.\n\nThe Rest of the Traditional Burns Night Evening\n\nAs with many Scottish events, the rest of the evening may become a little boisterous. Toasts will be made every few minutes, whisky will be drunk by the gallon, poems will be sung loudly, stories will be told, and if you're lucky, you may even get to enjoy a ceilidh.\n\nPlaces to go on Burns Night in Scotland\n\nIf you're in Edinburgh on Burns Night, here are a few good places to find a good ceilidh, or Burns Night Supper.\n\nSummerhall\n\nPrestonfield House\n\nBrowns Edinburgh\n\nKnow a Line from a Burns Poem\n\nFollowing tradition, Burns Night would not be complete without reciting poetry from Robert Burn’s collection. Be prepared for your celebrations by learning an excerpt of his poetry\n\nA Red, Red Rose (excerpt)\n\nO my Luve's like a red, red rose,\n\nThat's newly sprung in June:\n\nO my Luve's like the melodie,\n\nThat's sweetly play'd in tune.\n\nMeaning: The person he loves is as lovely as the loveliest thing that’s ever been loved.\n\nWe think this poem is even more beautiful when recited by someone. Do you recognise this voice?\n\nTo A Mouse (excerpt)\n\nBut, Mousie, thou art no thy lane,\n\nIn proving foresight may be vain;\n\nThe best-laid schemes o' mice an 'men\n\nGang aft agley,\n\nAn'lea'e us nought but grief an' pain,\n\nFor promis'd joy!\n\nMeaning: No matter how well you prepare for something, there’s a chance it’ll go wrong.\n\nTo a Louse (excerpt)\n\nO wad some Power the giftie gie us\n\nTo see oursels as ithers see us!\n\nIt wad frae mony a blunder free us,\n\nAn' foolish notion:\n\nWhat airs in dress an' gait wad lea'e us,\n\nAn' ev'n devotion!\n\nMeaning: If we could see ourselves as others do, we could become much better people.\n\nTo a Haggis (excerpt)\n\nFair fa' your honest, sonsie face,\n\nGreat chieftain o' the pudding-race!\n\nAboon them a' yet tak your place,\n\nPainch, tripe, or thairm:\n\nWeel are ye wordy o'a grace\n\nAs lang's my arm.\n\nMeaning: Haggis is delicious.\n\nExperience a traditional Burns Night in Scotland"
