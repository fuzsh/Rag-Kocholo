        "text": "1# Granite City\n\nAberdeen is famously known as the \"Granite City\" due to its many buildings made from local grey granite. This granite sparkles like silver due to its high mica content, and this unique aesthetic gives the city a special charm.\n\nMoving to Aberdeen? Certainly! Aberdeen, often called the \"Granite City,\" is a vibrant and historical city in Scotland with much to offer. Here are 10 interesting facts that you might find intriguing:\n\n2# Oil Capital of Europe\n\nAberdeen is often called the \"Oil Capital of Europe\" because of its pivotal role in the North Sea oil industry. The discovery of oil in the North Sea in the 1960s revolutionized Aberdeen's economy and led to significant growth and technological advancement.\n\n3# University of Aberdeen\n\nFounded in 1495, the University of Aberdeen is one of the oldest universities in the English-speaking world.
