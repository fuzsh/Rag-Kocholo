        "text": "Our connection with the Royal Household dates back to 1870.\n\nWhen VSA was born, in March 1870, as the Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor, Queen Victoria accepted the position of Patron which was a fantastic achievement for the city of Aberdeen and a real boost to our charity's profile. Ever since Queen Victoria said yes, the reigning monarch has been the Patron of VSA, spanning six reigns and 150 years. After inheriting the throne, at just 18 years old, she went on to be a national global icon for her strict sense of personal morals and straight-talking.\n\nOn 10th March 1870, one hundred and fifty years ago, the precursor to VSA was born. The Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor came into being as an organised response to supporting the people of Aberdeen, who had the least. It was founded by a group of people who were willing to do three things: make regular donations to support the poor; visit the poor to better help and understand the problems they faced and to manage the Association.\n\nOver 500 volunteers were recruited; each were allocated 10-12 families to build a supportive relationship with “gentle speech and behaviour, kindly inquiry and interest and advice of a practical sort.” It was hoped that this was the only way of coping: “with the great evils that prevail in the midst of the population, by organising a system of combined and harmonising action.” It was inspired by similar poor associations in London, Edinburgh, Liverpool, and Glasgow.\n\nIt was not a religious association and one of its early aims was that relief should be given without reference to any religious distinctions and complete impartiality should be observed. The prosperous people of the city were keen to show that they really cared about those who were worse off and wanted to explore ways to encourage them plus lift them out of poverty.\n\nSome of these aims, set out in March 1870, still ring true today. VSA aims to provide the best of care to enable the best of lives by supporting individuals and communities to fulfil their potential.\n\nWhat an incredible thing it is that the people of Aberdeen have built and maintained these ambitions for over 150 years, and what a powerful thing it would have been for those founding members to know how many generations of Aberdonians their vision would support."
