        "text": "Jessica Tryde- Local Fitness Nut\n\nIf I ask you to name two words to describe Stevie Wonder – your choice of words will most likely be “Singer” and “blind” (unfortunately). But ever think of words like “Sesame Street” or “Shut Up!” (that’s right). Stevie Wonder is not just a singer who’s got great pitch. He’s an absolute legend with more awards you can possibly legend, a man with many admirers and a father to nine kids.\n\nBut really – how much do you know about the great Stevie Wonder?\n\nHe doesn’t just sing\n\nSo he can’t see. That wasn’t going to stop his love for music. Before hitting his teens, he perfected the art of playing the piano, harmonica, drums and bass!\n\nHis instrumental album “Rednow Eivets” is “Stevie Wonder” spelled backwards\n\nClever guy huh. After jamming with Jimi Hendrix, he decided to keep it low and recorded an album only with instruments.\n\nHe wasn’t born blind\n\nSteve Wonders (real name is Steveland Hardaway Judkins) was born premature, thus had to be incubated. The oxygen pumped in his incubator worsened the blood vessels in the back of his eyes, causing him to go blind.\n\nHe temporarily lost his sense of taste and smell\n\nIn 1973, Stevie Wonder was in a car accident, putting him in a coma for several days. When he woke up, he lost his sense of taste and smell! But regained his lost senses shortly after – thank goodness.\n\nGuess who he told to “Shut Up”\n\nStevie Wonder was performing at a club when suddenly he yelled “Shut up!” at Lil’ Wayne (former Best Rapper Alive) who was interrupting his show!\n\nFirst song he learned to play was “Three Blind Mice”\n\nTalk about the irony…\n\nBonus Special:\n\nStevie Wonder Carpool Karaoke with James Corden\n\nWatch here\n\nJessica Tryde, born in Australia, bred in Taiwan, is a creative English copywriter living in Hong Kong. Her job includes whipping out creative ideas and digital executions. During her spare time, you’ll find her weight lifting in the gym, training for a gladiatorial bloodbath in a Muay Thai class or attempting to perform a yoga pose. If not working out, you’ll find her mingling with the locals at the wet market or reading at a local Hong Kong café."
