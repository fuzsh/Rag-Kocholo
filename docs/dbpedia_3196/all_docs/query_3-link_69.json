        "text": "Suckled calf production – calves are reared by their mothers until they're weaned at around six to eight months, and then fattened ready for slaughter, either on the farm where they were born or elsewhere.\n\nDairy-beef finishing systems – calves are bought in from the dairy herd and reared to finishing. They may be kept on the farm that buys them, or sold or moved to different farms for finishing. Sometimes, these animals are kept indoors throughout their lives.\n\nVeal production – calves are reared until they're 8 to 12 months old and then slaughtered.\n\nFinishing – this is when most beef animals are brought in and fed high energy diets to get them ready for slaughter. Such systems can have welfare issues if the diet and housing isn't appropriate.\n\n'Store' cattle – young, weaned cattle are grown and 'finished' more slowly, often at grass."
