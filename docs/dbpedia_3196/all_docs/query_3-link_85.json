        "text": "Scotland census research\n\nScottish national censuses are taken on the same dates as those in England and Wales, but have different rules and arrangements. As in the south, the first census that’s really useful to family historians is the 1841 record, as it lists all the people within each household. Further details, such as family relationships, occupations and birthplaces, were added as time went on. Scottish censuses are subject to strict rules that keep them private for 100 years, so 1901 is the most recent record that’s currently available.\n\nCensus records are held by the General Register Office for Scotland, and you can view them in person at the ScotlandsPeople Centre in Edinburgh. You’ll find full transcriptions of the records from 1841-1901, with all the details from the original records, on Ancestry.\n\nScotland vital records\n\nParish registers - Civil registration was introduced later in Scotland than in England – in 1855. Before this year, the best resources for tracing vital events are the registers of christenings, marriages and burials kept by the established church – in this case the Church of Scotland. These records are less reliable than their English counterparts, due to inconsistent recording and preservation. However, they remain an essential resource.\n\nYou’ll find a growing collection of parish registers on Ancestry, with both searchable transcriptions and images of original records. If we don’t yet have records for your area, the best place to start is the local record office\n\nCivil registers - After 1855, you should find all your ancestors’ events listed in the state registers. These are more detailed than their English counterparts, with gems such as the date of the parents’ marriage in birth entries, and the mothers’ maiden names for marriages. You can search the indexes, and indeed view many of the original entries, at the ScotlandsPeople Centre. For more recent records, you’ll need to order an official copy while you’re there.\n\nScotland research routes\n\nThese organisations provide records, help and advice to support your Scottish research. Also bear in mind that many counties and towns keep extensive family history records in record offices, libraries and genealogical or historical societies, so always check for a local resource."
