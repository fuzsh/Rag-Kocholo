        "text": "Dr. James Donald Thullen of Morehead City, NC, died Wednesday, June 19, 2024. Jim was born December 11, 1941 in Poland, Ohio to Harry & Ada Thullen. After earning degrees in pharmacy & medicine, he moved to NC where he taught and practiced neonatology for 26 years. He was a clinical professor of pediatrics at UNC School of Medicine and he developed and co-directed the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Wake Medical Center in Raleigh. He was honored with numerous medical & teaching awards during his career and was especially proud of the Michael Weeks Humanitarian Award. The Raleigh News & Observer recognized him as a “Tar Heel of the Week” in 1989.\n\nAfter his retirement in 2001, Jim became an avid gardener, birder, boater, fisherman, traveler, cook, boggle master, and card shark. He loved living at the coast and enthusiastically volunteered with several local groups including the NC Maritime Museum, Cape Lookout Lighthouse, and CMAST.\n\nIn addition to his parents, Jim was predeceased by his wife, Amy Carr Thullen; sister, Judy Thullen Walker. He is survived by his devoted friend and caregiver, Alice Johnson; his adored dog Oreo; step-daughters, Katy Norman (Scott), and Sara Bell; step-grandchildren, Quinn, and Luke Norman and all of the Carrs (in-laws, nieces, nephews, and cousins).\n\nIn keeping with Jim’s wishes, no services are planned. Memorial contributions may be made to The Dr. James Thullen Parent Care Fund, Wake Med Foundation, Raleigh, NC, The Amy C & Jim Thullen Endowment, Carteret Community College Foundation, Morehead City, NC or The Maritime Heritage Foundation, Beaufort, NC.\n\nCondolences and life tributes may be sent to the family at www.noebrooks.net."
