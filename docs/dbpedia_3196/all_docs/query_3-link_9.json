        "text": "Every city comes with a number of bizarre facts that can surprise even those who have spent decades in their hometown.\n\nAnd Aberdeen is no different, with the silver city host to several facts you may not have known about.\n\nThe city has become well known for its offshore energy supply, but there are a lot more facts about Aberdeen and those from the city.\n\nSome of which might surprise you, and might even have you wondering how you didn’t spot that.\n\nFrom the National Lottery, to medieval coins, these are some of the most random facts you may not have known about Aberdeen.\n\nWhisky distilleries\n\nScotland has become well-known for its whisky production, but were you aware of where the majority of it comes from?\n\nAberdeenshire currently plays host to the most distilleries in Scotland, with 10 of them around the shire.\n\nAnd you can even tour the lot, including Glen Garioch, The Balvenie, and Knockdhu distilleries.\n\nThe photograph of the moon\n\nThe first Scottish astronomer to take a picture of the moon was born in Aberdeen.\n\nSir David Gill, born in 1843, built a small observatory with a 12-inch telescope that he also made himself in 1866.\n\nThen, in 1869, Gill managed to take one of the few pictures of the moon first uncovered in the 19th century.\n\nHis highly notable achievement brought him fame as a result, and he even has craters on the moon and mars named after him; not bad for an amateur astronomer.\n\nHazlehead Park maze\n\nNestled away in Hazlehead Park, the popular attraction is home to Scotland’s oldest maze.\n\nPlanted in 1935, the maze has been around since before the second World War, and sits amongst a number of sculptures and walking tracks.\n\nThe park forms part of the Freedom Lands which were granted to the city by Robert the Bruce, before being opened to the public in 1920.\n\nSelf-seal envelope\n\nThe first self-seal envelopes were developed in Aberdeen in the 1890’s.\n\nAlong the River Don in the 1800’s, there were 17 operational paper mills that were feeding off the water supply for power and to treat fibres used in the mills.\n\nThen, late on in the century, the mills started producing the first self-seal envelopes, which are being used worldwide to this day.\n\nLargest permanent funfair\n\nCodona’s has become one of Aberdeen’s most popular attractions, with the seaside funfair attracting thousands every year.\n\nHaving stood by the water for over 50 years, Codona’s holds the title of being the largest permanent funfair in the UK.\n\nWith a Ferris wheel, adventure golf, and an indoor play area for the little ones, the family-owned funfair has cemented itself as one of Aberdeen’s top attractions.\n\nNational Lottery winners\n\nYou might want to go out and buy a lottery ticket after reading this.\n\nAberdeen has proven to be one of the luckiest postcodes in the UK, with over 47 millionaires all living within an AB postcode.\n\n276 residents have also scooped over £50,000 in prizes, so maybe it’s worth having a go on the Lotto.\n\nPittodrie seating\n\nSeven years after a blaze left part of Aberdeen’s home ground damaged, the club needed to take action to repair the stricken stand.\n\nDespite the setback, the club was able to rebuild the damaged stand, and in the process turned Pittodrie into an all-seater stadium, which would become Scotland’s first to do so in 1981.\n\nIt also ended up being the first in the UK to adapt the measure before the Hillsborough disaster prompted a change in law in the 1990s that forced all stadia to have seating only.\n\nGolf clubs for every week\n\nIt is no secret that Aberdeen city and Aberdeenshire has a wealth of golf courses.\n\nBut it turns out, there are actually more than 52 clubs around the area, with enough for each week of the year.\n\nWhy not check some of them out yourself and see how many you can play in a year?\n\nMedieval coins\n\nFor the fans who enjoy digging for treasure, you might want to bring a metal detector out with you in the shire.\n\nOver the years, more medieval coins have been discovered in Aberdeen than anywhere else in Britain.\n\nStretching as far back as the Roman times, some coins found include a collection of 12,000 silver coins from the reigns of Alexander III and Edward III.\n\nUnion Street’s name\n\nThe Granite Mile has become a major shopping hub in the city, and an amazing night out with its plethora of pubs, bars, and restaurants along the road.\n\nBut did you know the road was called Union Street to celebrate the act of union between Great Britain and Ireland in 1800?\n\nDespite the two splitting decades later, the name of the street remains to this day, and is now the most popular road in the city."
