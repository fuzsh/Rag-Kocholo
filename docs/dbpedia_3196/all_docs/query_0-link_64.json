        "text": "James (Jim) Donald Aberdeen With many tears of sadness the family announces the passing of James (Jim) Donald Aberdeen on Friday, February 6th, 2009. Jim was born January 3rd, 1955 in Wakaw, SK. He leaves to mourn his wife and best friend Denise; son Jason; daughter Danielle (John); special pal grandson Daylen; brother Bill Aberdeen; sisters Judy (Al) Penner, Linda (Bob) Meidl, Lori Gerbrandt, Karen (Glenn) Leedahl, Norma (Mark) Summers; mother-in-law Catherine Proulx; sister-in-law Lucille (Frank) Stefaniuk; brothers-in-law Denis Proulx, Marcel (Eunice) Proulx, Arthur (Holly) Proulx, Gerry (Sharon) Proulx, Louis Proulx, Earl (Anne) Proulx; numerous nieces, nephews and friends. He was predeceased by his mother Verna in 1976; father James in 1992; stepmother Jean in 2006; sister Brenda in 2006; father-in-law Pierre in 1991. Jim worked at Dept. of Highways for a few years then moved on to start his career with the City of Saskatoon in January 1978 where he worked as a heavy duty mechanic for 30 years. Jim retired April 20, 2008. Jim's battle with cancer was short but his passion for life was long. He loved to hunt and spent hours in the bush in the cold and wet, loving every minute. As a member of the Wildlife Federation he taught hunter safety and was involved with Junior Sportsmen. He was also a coordinator for the gun ranges at the Sports and Leisure Show for many years. Time spent with his family camping, hunting or just getting together for a little time were all very special but nothing compared to becoming grandpa to Daylen two and a half years ago. They were \"Best Friends \" and both will miss their times together. Daylen will have the best guardian angel watching over him. A Memorial Service will be held Tuesday, February 10th, 2009 at 11:00 a.m. at Hillcrest Funeral Home (east on 8th Street, turn right before railway crossing). Interment will follow at Hillcrest Memorial Gardens. In lieu of flowers the family requests in memory of Jim, donations can be made to the Canadian Cancer Society, (101 440 2nd Avenue N, Saskatoon, SK S7K 2C3). Family and friends may send email condolences from the website . Arrangements are entrusted to Jeffrey Sully, HILLCREST FUNERAL HOME 477-4400. 1319318"
