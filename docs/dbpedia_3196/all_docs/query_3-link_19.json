        "text": "The ‘Children of the 1950s’ study began in 1962 when researchers surveyed all the primary school children in Aberdeen aged 7-12 years. At the time they were interested in investigating the occurrence and causes of learning disabilities in a distinct population.\n\nNow, over 50 years later, scientists are using the data collected along with information collected via a postal questionnaire. Their aim is to investigate the factors in infancy and childhood which can shape health and disease in adult life. New research suggests size at birth, growth in childhood and social circumstances can all have an effect. If we can understand some of the causes of ill health, it may help us to produce preventative measures for the future.\n\nTracing the study members\n\nQuestionnaire response\n\nEnsuring the data is valid\n\nHeart disease\n\nPregnancy\n\nIntelligence\n\nAcross the generations\n\nSchooling\n\nMental health\n\n1. Tracing the study members\n\nWe attempted to trace 12,150 of the children in the original school survey in 1962 who were born in Aberdeen. By March 2004 we had found over 97% of the population of whom 477 were deceased and 288 were known to have emigrated from the UK. Of those still found to be living in the UK, 81% still lived in Scotland while 73% were in Grampian region.\n\nBy looking at the data collected in the 1960s and comparing who had moved away and who had not, we found that children who were taller, from higher social classes and those who did better at school tests were more likely to have moved away from Grampian.\n\n2. Response to the questionnaire\n\nWe mailed more than 11,000 study members of whom over 7,000 (64%) completed and returned the questionnaire. This is a good rate of response compared to other similar postal research surveys. We were keen to have as big a response as possible as if any section of the population are not represented this could affect the way we view our results. Encouragingly for the study researchers, 95% of those who responded to the questionnaire were willing to take part in future surveys.\n\nWe found that slightly more women than men responded. Those who had better primary school test results were more likely to return the questionnaire, as were those who had fewer siblings, were taller, heavier and those whose father was in a non-manual occupation at the time of their birth.\n\n3. Ensuring the data is valid\n\nAn important part of our work is to ensure the data we are using is valid. We therefore looked at how the answers in the questionnaire relating to father’s occupation matched up with answers given in the original study in 1962. We found a degree of difference between the two that was enough to affect the interpretation of results. We could therefore suggest that in similar studies, data collected where participants recall past events should be used with caution.\n\n4. Heart disease\n\nCoronary heart disease and stroke are amongst the biggest killers in Scotland today. We were therefore keen to look at their prevalence in this population and any possible explanations as to why some people are more likely to suffer than others.\n\nFirst of all we found that social class at birth was associated with lifestyle behaviours in adult life such as smoking, binge drinking and being overweight. These factors are known to be risk factors for heart disease. Those in the higher social classes were on average less likely to have these ‘risky’ behaviours. There is evidence from the data that levels of education may be an important factor here.\n\nThose study members who had a father in a higher social class according to occupation were less likely to suffer from heart disease than those in the lower classes. Coronary heart disease and stroke were also more prevalent in those with a lower weight at birth. This has been shown in other similar studies of previous generation, but it is interesting that we have found it to be the case in more recent times. Interestingly, we did not find any association between being obese or overweight at primary school age and increased risk of heart disease in adult life. It may be that if weight had been measured later in childhood or in adolescence an increase in risk would have been apparent.\n\n5. Pregnancy\n\nDifferences in temperature during the pregnancies of the mothers of the ‘Children of the 1950s’ affected birth weight of their offspring. The explanation for this is unclear as yet, but this is of interest if weather patterns are changing to more extreme conditions as is suspected.\n\nRaised blood pressure in pregnancy is one of the most common complications, but the causes are not known. We examined the links between poor social circumstances in childhood and this condition. Results indicate that women who lived in poorer childhood circumstances as children were at greater risk of a severe from of high blood pressure known as pre-eclampsia. Unfortunately information on smoking in pregnancy was limited. Ideally we would like to have factored this into our results.\n\n6. Intelligence\n\nIt is known that intelligence in childhood is an indicator for state of health in later adult life. If we knew what factors determine IQ in early life, it may help us to understand how it is related to health. These factors may be social and biological. In this study we found that height in childhood, growth before birth, characteristics of the mother and, especially, father’s social class could be related to IQ as measured by performance in school tests at age 7,9 and 11 years.\n\nSeason of birth also appeared to have a small effect on how children in this study performed in school tests. This effect was found to be due to the differences in the age at school entry as this depends on the time of year you were born.\n\n7. Across the generations\n\nBy linking the female members of the study to the birth records of their own children we have shown that the size at birth of the offspring is related to that of their mother. This is separate from the mother’s growth and circumstances throughout her own life.\n\n8. Schooling\n\nOne of the questions researchers wanted to ask was ‘Can the school you attend influence your later health’. While there was a difference between the average health of those attending different schools, this seemed to be due to the composition of the school intake of pupils rather than a direct influence by the school.\n\n9. Mental health\n\nLow birth weight not due to prematurity was related to adult psychological health in this study. It may be that this is due to impaired development of the brain during growth in fetal life. More research is required to find a possible mechanism.\n\nWe hope to keep you updated on future findings.

That inevitably leads to create rankings. In the context of a primary school, students will likely be able to rank themselves and their peers based on observed grades in a certain subject. Teachers will have an even better perspective on how their pupils rank, as they observe the entire distribution of grades within a class. The existence of a “rank effect” has been documented by the literature: . However, little attention was paid to the impact on the development of social and emotional skills. In this project we would like to investigate whether ranking by ability at the class or grade level in the early years of primary school has long lasting effect on children’s outcomes, including later educational attainment but also behaviour and emotional skills.\n\nMultidisciplinary Ecosystem to study Lifecourse Determinants and Prevention of Burdensome Mid-life Multimorbidity\n\nUniversity of Southampton\n\nA growing number of people are living with multiple long-term health conditions like diabetes, heart disease or dementia. We call this multi-morbidity. Many things throughout a person’s life influence the chances of developing health conditions. People from more disadvantaged backgrounds and/or certain ethnicities are more likely to develop multi-morbidity and to develop it earlier. The order that people develop conditions also varies.\n\nWe aim to understand the way people develop early multi-morbidity over their lifetime and the things that influence that, including broader experiences. By ‘early’ we mean before age 65. This will identify key time points in a person’s life where prevention efforts should be targeted or strengthened to reduce the risk of that person developing burdensome multi-morbidity.\n\nLong-term effect of separation from best friends\n\nH Kawarazaki, University College London\n\nUsing the data from the Aberdeen Children of the Nineteen-Fifties (ACONF), this study examines the long-term effects of attending an elite school. Since childhood environment may affect various statuses in adulthood, we look at health, socioeconomic, and socioemotional outcomes. In addition, many students experience separation from their best friends at primary schools when they proceeded to secondary schools. Therefore, we also examine the long-term effect of this type of separation.\n\nAssociation between childhood epilepsy and socioeconomic status in adulthood\n\nP Mazzone, University of Edinburgh\n\nThe proposed study will use data from the Aberdeen Children of the Nineteen-Fifties (ACONF) to investigate the association between childhood epilepsy and socioeconomic deprivation in adulthood. We will compare our findings to other population-based studies to better understand how changes in education and social support, and how better diagnostic and treatment options since the 1950s have shaped education, health, and deprivation outcomes in children with epilepsy in Scotland.\n\nGuide and Scout participation in childhood and influence on cognitive ability, social mobility and mental health in adulthood\n\nDr Lynne Forrest, University of Edinburgh\n\nThis study examines whether being a member of the Guides, Scouts or Boys Brigade in childhood influences mental health in adulthood, using the Aberdeen Child of the 1950s birth cohort. We also want to look at whether being a member enhances intelligence and social mobility.\n\nGrowing up in Aberdeen\n\nProfessor C Wallace, University of Aberdeen\n\nThis study aims to find out people’s experiences of growing up in Aberdeen. Through face to face interviews, it will help us to understand how the lives of people from your generation were affected by the social and economic changes that have taken place, including the rebuilding of residential areas, the changing educational system, the impact of the oil industry and decline of the fishing industries and other factors.\n\nMultimorbidity\n\nDr M Johnston, University of Aberdeen\n\nMultimorbidity, the co-existence of two or more health conditions, is a growing Public Health challenge due to the ageing of our population and a rise in the number of long term conditions. It is associated with poorer outcomes and the increased use of health and social care services. If interventions are to be developed and services better targeted, there is a need to investigate the prevalence of multimorbidity and the early and later life factors associated with its development and resilience to its effects.\n\nSTRADL\n\nProfessor A Murray, University of Aberdeen\n\nProfessor A McIntosh, University of Aberdeen\n\nClinical depression is a chronic worldwide health problem affecting millions of people and approximately 13 per cent of the UK population. Researchers say that although it is a chronic and recurrent problem for many sufferers, little is known about what makes people vulnerable or resilient to the condition. By studying groupings of people both with and without depression in this way researchers hope to be able to identify its causes and mechanisms, which can be used in the quest for diagnostic tests and new therapies.\n\nThe investigators will test whether the subgroups of depressed individuals correspond to different diseases using tests of memory and intelligence (cognition) as well as brain imaging. website\n\nBenzodiazepines and Z-drugs Prescribing Patterns over Time among the Aberdeen Children of the Nineteen Fifties Cohort\n\nM Khezrian, University of Aberdeen\n\nLong-term benzodiazepines (BZD) and Z-drugs prescribing is a concern worldwide due to the risks associated with these medicines. Guidelines recommend that they should be prescribed only for severe anxiety/insomnia and that prescribing should be limited to the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible time period (up to four weeks). Despite guidelines, in Scotland the sustained level of prescribing over the last decade suggests long-term use. A large amount of the BZD and Z-drugs prescribing occurred in those aged 40-69. Understanding BZD and Z-drugs prescribing patterns and whether particular patient characteristics (such as socioeconomic status and circumstances, social mobility, having several chronic conditions) are related to long-term prescribing might allow us to prevent long-term use.\n\nExperience of social mobility\n\nK Adamczyk, University of Aberdeen\n\nWe are taught from a young age to aim high, to reach for the stars, to want more, more than our parents, more than the generations before us, to climb the social ladder. But as we surge forward, as we grapple for university places and promotions, what are we leaving behind? And from our ladder in the stars, if we look back, what do we see?\n\nThis study employs a mixed-methods approach to examine how individuals understand, experience and evaluate social mobility and the effect of social mobility trajectories on health and wellbeing. Through statistical analysis of survey data and life-history interviews, this research aims to illuminate how people experience life-course transitions, occupational and otherwise, in times of social change.\n\nHow strongly is family socioeconomic status associated with children’s cognitive and scholastic performance during the years of attending primary school?\n\nProfessor von Stum, University of York\n\nFamily background is one of the key factors influences children’s differences in cognitive and scholastic performance.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that children from more advantaged family backgrounds tend to perform better in cognitive tests and school exams than children from impoverished family homes. However, the strength of the association between family background and children’s performance in cognitive tests and school exams during the years of attending primary school in the ACONF sample is yet unknown. For this project, we will estimate this association to compare its strength to that reported for other samples from Britain.\n\nThree comprehensive descriptions of the study have been published:\n\nBatty G D, Morton S M B, Campbell D, Clark H, Davey Smith G, Hall M, Macintyre S, Leon D A.\n\nThe Aberdeen Children of the 1950s cohort study: background, methods and follow-up information as a new resource for the study of life course and intergenerational influences on health.
