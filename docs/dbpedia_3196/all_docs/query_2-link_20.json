        "text": "Gordon Strachan will join Olympic curling hero Eve Muirhead and TV presenter Dan Walker in a celebrity golf tournament at Donald Trump's north-east golf course in August.\n\nThe Staysure PGA Seniors Championship, a marquee event on the Legends Tour, will be arriving at Trump International Golf Links at Balmedie between August 23-27.\n\nAnd the week will kick-off with the star-studded Wapp Celebrity Series featuring stars from the world of sport of entertainment.\n\nREAD MORE: Leighton Clarkson on Aberdeen transfer timeline and why he decided to make permanent Pittodrie switch\n\nStrachan, a former Gothenburg Great with Aberdeen, perhaps has the strongest connection to the north-east but will be joined by an all-star field playing 18 holes.\n\nEx-BBC Breakfast presenter Walker and gold medallist Muirhead will tee it up with snooker legend Stephen Hendry, actor James Nesbitt, football great Robbie Fowler and ex-Scotland rugby captain Gavin Hastings.\n\nAs well as her curling exploits, Muirhead plays off scratch and was previously in the final 16 in the British girls' championship, turning down a number of scholarships to play golf in the United States.\n\nThe Scot said: \"It has been a bit of a whirlwind year or so since we won gold in Beijing. Retiring from curling certainly left me with a lot more time to spend out on the golf course.\n\n“Being able to play one of the best courses in Scotland in a competitive environment will certainly take me back to my days as a youth golfer – except this time there will be quite a big crowd there so that will be a little different.\n\n\"At the end of the day though we’re there to have some fun, to try and qualify for the Wapp Celebrity Series Grand Final and the chance to win a share of £100,000 for charity.”\n\nPhil Harrison, chief executive officer of the Legends Tour, said: “We are delighted to have so many great sporting icons from Scotland, and from across the UK, joining us at Trump International Golf Links Aberdeen for the Wapp Celebrity Series.\n\n“The tournament will be the last opportunity celebrities have to qualify for the Wapp Celebrity Series Grand Final in Mauritius later this year to play for a share of £100,000 for charity.\n\n\"With that in mind it promises to be a great day for all fans, so make sure you grab some tickets and come down to see the celebrities and the Legends Tour professionals up close.\"\n\nPlayers already confirmed for the Seniors PGA Championship include Tom Lehman, Michael Campbell, Ian Woosnam and Adilson da Silva with Aberdeen's Paul Lawrie also expected to play."
