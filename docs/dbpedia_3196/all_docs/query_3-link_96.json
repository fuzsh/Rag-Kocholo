On this site you can search registers kept by the Church of Scotland, the Roman Catholic church and other churches.\n\nBackground to church registers\n\nHow to search church registers\n\nUnderstanding the contents of church registers\n\nChurch register images\n\nWhich parishes and congregations have registers in the index\n\nBackground to church registers\n\nMost churches keep registers of baptisms, marriages and burials and some keep registers of other events relating to people. On the Scotlandspeople site you can search the registers of the Church of Scotland, the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland and some other Presbyterian churches.\n\nOld Parish Registers (Church of Scotland)\n\nThe Old Parish Registers (OPRs) comprise the records of births and baptisms, banns and marriages and deaths and burials kept by individual parishes of the Established Church (Church of Scotland) before the introduction of civil registration in 1855.\n\nThe parish minister or the session clerk usually assumed responsibility for maintaining the registers, but since there was no standard format employed, record keeping varied enormously from parish to parish and also from year to year. As a result, the information may be sparse, unreliable and difficult to read. The oldest register dates from 1553 (baptisms and banns from Errol, Perthshire), but although there was a requirement from 1552 that parishes record baptisms and marriages, many did not commence until much later, and some more remote areas only have registers from the early 19th century. Some registers have been lost or destroyed and the condition of the surviving 3500 is variable. The National Records of Scotland holds the surviving original registers.\n\nRegistration in the Church of Scotland's registers was costly and unpopular, so many people did not bother to register events at all. Although details of some non-conformists can be found in Established Church registers, many members of other religious denominations chose to have events registered in their own churches. In addition, rapid urbanisation during the 19th century contributed to the diminishing influence of the Church and a decrease in registration in these areas. It was estimated at the time that as few as 30% of events actually occurring were being recorded for some urban parishes.\n\nCivil registration started in 1855. However in a small number of districts the local registrar was not in place at the very beginning and therefore there are a small number of events that are recorded in Old Parish Registers but are not featured in our statutory records.\n\nRoman Catholic parish registers\n\nRoman Catholic parish registers comprise records of\n\nbirths and baptisms\n\nmarriages\n\nconfirmations\n\ndeaths and burials\n\ncommunicants\n\nsick calls\n\nstatus animarum\n\nconverts\n\nfirst confessions\n\nseat rents\n\nThe records cover all Scottish parishes in existence by 1855 â€“ before the introduction of civil registration; the records of Glasgow's Catholic cemetery; and the records of the RC Bishopric of the Forces, which records all sacramental events for British service men and women serving in the armed forces worldwide.\n\nUnder the provisions of Church Law, all faithful are to have sacramental information recorded in the registers of the parish. Record format and content varied over time, with the responsibility for the information gathered being placed with the parish priest - since there was no standard format prescribed, record keeping varied enormously from parish to parish and also from year to year.\n\nAs a result, the information may be sparse, unreliable and difficult to read. Approximately 700 registers have survived, the earliest dating from 1703, but most records only begin in the 30 years following the relaxation of legislation against Catholics in the 1790s up to the Roman Catholic Relief Act of 1829 when it was permitted to be a member of a Catholic church.\n\nBear in mind that the Church of Scotland parishes did not cover the same areas as Roman Catholic parishes and the parishes of other churches.\n\nFor further information about the content of these records see the National Records of Scotland's guide on Catholic parish registers.\n\nOther church registers\n\nAs well as the Church of Scotland, other Presbyterian churches in Scotland kept registers of baptisms, marriages and burials from 1716 onwards. These other church registers are in the course of being added to the ScotlandsPeople site. The churches concerned were Presbyterian churches that were originally outside the Church of Scotland (or left the Church of Scotland) but joined (or re-joined) the Church of Scotland at various points. These churches were as follows:\n\nThe Reformed Presbyterian Church\n\nThe Original Secession (or First Secession) Church\n\nThe Associate Synods (Burghers and Antiburghers, and the Auld Licht Burghers, New Licht Burghers, Auld Licht Antiburghers and New Licht Antiburghers)\n\nThe Relief Church\n\nThe United Secession Church\n\nThe United Presbyterian Church\n\nThe Free Church\n\nBear in mind that the other churches did not have the same parish structure as the Church of Scotland.\n\nHow to search church registers\n\nThe church register search allows you to search for baptisms (or births, marriages (or banns), burials (or deaths) and other events (like confirmations, sick calls and confessions in the Roman Catholic church).\n\nChoose which of the type of register you are searching from these four, then select a church (from Church of Scotland, Roman Catholic Church and other churches).\n\nEach church had a different structure of parishes and congregations, so it is not possible to search across all three churches for one parish. When you select a church, the drop-down list of counties and parishes/congregations will load on the search page and if you choose another church, it will take a second or two for the list of parishes/congregations for that church to load on the search page.\n\nOnce you have carried out a search for one church, you can select another church in the filter on the results page and repeat the search for that church.\n\nAs with other records, you might get the best results by doing a wide search first then narrowing down. So, for example, entering a forename and surname and county but not specifying a parish.\n\nExpect inconsistent record keeping, so please make use the search options to vary your search and pick up inconsistent name spelling and cases where the clerk has left a surname or forename blank.\n\nIf you are certain an event was recorded in a particular parish but none of the search options work, try leaving the forename or surname field blank and selecting the parish/congregation and the year. That way you should be able to view all the baptisms, marriages, burials or other events for that parish/congregation that year and can sort by forename and surname.\n\nOf all the events recorded in church registers, those of deaths and burials are acknowledged to be the most sparsely kept. Since there was no requirement to record these, a great many parishes simply did not bother and of those that did, many have not survived. Often the only record that a death has taken place will be implied in the payment of a fee to the parish for the hire of the mortcloth or pall which was draped over the coffin or the body itself for the funeral.\n\nUnderstanding the contents of church registers\n\nBaptisms\n\nChurch registers of baptisms may record the date of birth or the date of baptism or both. There is no indication given in the index as to whether the entry is a birth or a baptism, but it is more usual for the index entry to show the baptism date. The amount of information recorded can be variable and most entries contain very little detail. At best: name of the child, date of birth and/or date of baptism, father's name, mother's name and maiden surname, place or parish of residence, occupation of the father and names (and sometimes occupations) of witnesses. Very occasionally the witnesses' relationships to the child may be recorded. At worst: the mother's name is not recorded at all between certain years or that the entry does not record the sex of the child and the name is ambiguous. Roman Catholic baptism registers sometimes include the father's occupation and the name of the priest.\n\nRegisters of Neglected Entries compiled for each parish by the Registrar-General after statutory registration began in 1855, contain a small number of birth entries proved to have occurred between 1801 and 1854, but not entered into the parish registers. These are indexed in a similar format to other Old Parish Register entries.\n\nWhilst some registers record all of the information above, others record minimal details such as the names of the child and parents and a baptismal date. The information also varies from parish to parish and indeed over time within each parish. There was no standard format for registers, and they can consist of small notebooks, larger unformatted ledgers or pre-printed registers.\n\nPlease note, the birth/baptismal indexes include burial records of children who were not baptised. These were included in the original indexes by the Church of the Latter Day Saints (LDS). In the case of a stillborn child or one who has not lived long, there is usually no name given at all, for example \"a male child\", although there may be reference to a parent, for example \"a child of David Murray\". Occasionally other information is included, for example \"a child of John Murray in Hilton, unbaptized\"\n\nYou can use the information that you find on an birth or baptism entry to further your search in several ways:\n\nThe parents' names (if both are recorded) will help pinpoint a marriage.\n\nRecord any information on witnesses and their family connection (if any), since these can be invaluable in determining the correct line.\n\nUse the location of the birth or baptism to track the family through the earlier census records.\n\nBear in mind that it was quite common for families, in an era of high infant mortality, to name a subsequent child after a dead sibling, so check that you have the correct child's entry.\n\nBanns and marriages\n\nThe proclamation of banns was the notice of contract of marriage, read out in the church before the marriage took place. Couples or their 'cautioners' (sponsors) were often required to pay a 'caution' (pronounced 'kay-shun') or security to prove the seriousness of their intentions. Forthcoming marriages were supposed to be proclaimed on three successive Sundays, however, in practice, all three proclamations could be made on the same day on payment of a fee. If the bride and groom lived in different parishes, the impending marriage was proclaimed in both parishes, although not necessarily on the same days, therefore the dates in each register may be different. You may also find that one register may show the proclamation date and the other the date of the marriage itself.\n\nDo not expect too much from banns and marriages records. The amount of information recorded can be variable and most entries contain very little detail. At best you might find: date(s) of the proclamation of intended marriage and/or date of marriage, names of bride and groom and their parish of residence, sometimes the occupation of the groom and occasionally the name of the bride's father. At worst you should find the following: the names of the bride and groom recorded along with the fee paid in caution.\n\nRegisters of Neglected Entries compiled for each parish by the Registrar-General after statutory registration began in 1855, contain a small number of marriage entries proved to have occurred between 1801 and 1854, but not entered into the parish registers. These are indexed in a similar format to other OPR entries.\n\nBear in mind that 'irregular' marriages, by exchange of promises before witnesses, by betrothal and consummation, or by cohabitation and repute, were forms of marriage recognised by Scots Law, yet may have taken place without any official record of the event.\n\nYou can use the information from a banns or marriage entry to further your search in several ways:\n\nthe names of bride and groom, parish and name of bride's father (if recorded) can help narrow down the search for their births/baptisms.\n\nthe location of the marriage might help you to find the family in the earlier census records.\n\nBurials and deaths\n\nParish registers of death and burial were very inconsistently kept.\n\nSurviving registers may record the date of death or the date of burial or date of payment for hire of the mortcloth, but only one of these will appear in the index. There is no indication given in the index as to whether the entry alludes to a death or a burial or the mortcloth payment.\n\nSome people were not buried in the parish in which they were living. In the Old Statistical Account for Aberdeen, the writer lamented the fact that the figures presented for burials in Old Machar were not accurate because \"many who die in this parish are buried in other parishes, but a far greater number are brought from other parishes and buried here. This is owing partly to their forefathers having lived, died and been buried in this parish; and partly to the burial lairs being much cheaper here\". (Volume 19 Pages 176/7)\n\nSome people did not use the parish mortcloth for burial. Prosperous and important families may have had their own family mortcloth, some trades paid into charitable funds with their own mortcloth. In parishes where mortcloth dues are the only evidence of burial, such cases might have gone unrecorded. Sometimes there was no charge for use of the parish mortcloth, particularly if the family were poor.\n\nDo not expect too much from parish registers of death and burial. The amount of information recorded can be variable and most entries contain very little detail. More often than not you will find only the name of the person who has died, with a date, and sometimes even just the surname. Such paucity of information can make it extremely difficult to pinpoint the correct person. In the case of a mortcloth hire, there is usually a record of the payment made. Some parishes had several mortcloths for hire, of varying quality, including a childs one and the fee will vary accordingly. Sometimes you will find extra information. Besides the name of the person who has died, the date of death and/or date of burial, you may find the name of a relative (for example spouse, father), the place or parish of residence, and sometimes the occupation of the person/father/spouse. A few registers will give cause of death and some age at death. There may be more detail recorded on the death/burial of important and well-to-do members of the parish.\n\nDeaths/burials of married women can be referred to in various ways:\n\nby their married name, which is unusual in Scottish records outside the census\n\nby their maiden name, for example \"Mary Murray, wife of Thos Low, Alyth\"\n\nmerely as Mrs with no first name given for example \"Mrs Easton\", or as Mrs using the husband's name for example \"Mrs William Hackney\"\n\nsimply as someone's wife for example \"James Murray's wife\"\n\nas a widow with no first name given for example \"Widow Graham\", or \"Relict of Samuel Thom, surgeon in Canongate\" or with extra information for example \"Isabel Reid, widow of the late James Wilkie, Alyth\"\n\nIn the case of a stillborn child or one who has not lived long, there is usually no name given at all, for example \"a male child\", although there may be reference to a parent, for example \"a child of David Murray\". Occasionally other information is included, for example \"a child of John Murray in Hilton, unbaptized\"\n\nOther events\n\nThe Roman Catholic registers contain records other than baptisms, marriages and burials. On the ScotlandsPeople site these are collectively referred to as registers of other events. An explanation of these and the event codes that apply to them appear below.\n\nCommunicants and Converts (event code U & I)\n\nList of parishioners under the care of a local priest were often compiled during the course of a year so that the priest would know who was Catholic. Communicant lists often simply list the name of the individual in a parish and a particular date. Often names can be found grouped together in families and can be a useful (but basic) census substitute.\n\nConfessions (event code E)\n\nA small number of registers of confessions have survived. These do not include details of the confessions themselves, but record that an individual went to confession before receiving Holy Communion. They generally record the name of the individual, a parish and a date.\n\nConfirmation (event code I)\n\nThe sacrament of confirmation is generally performed when an individual is a child. In some periods, confirmation may have taken place as young as seven years old, in others as old as 12 years old. Confirmation records provide the name of the child, a confirmation (saints name) taken by the child, and occasionally further family details. These are useful for estimating the age of a child in lieu of any surviving baptismal records. Converts â€“ event code V In some cases, converts were recorded in baptismal records; but a number of convert registers have survived. With the majority of converts generally being in adulthood, there is limited information regarding parentage and families.\n\nSeat Rents (event code R)\n\nA number of churches in the nineteenth century reserved pews for parishioners in return for payment of a fee. These are very useful in confirming the residence of ancestors in a particular parish and also in identifying where your ancestors sat in the chapel.\n\nSick calls (event code S)\n\nTwo registers of sick calls survive. These record the visitations of a priest to a sick person. It could provide an indication of a death following on from the visit (although the parishioner might well have recovered!).\n\nStatus Animarum (event code A)\n\nThis type of record is a 'state of the souls' â€“ an enumeration of all Catholics within a particular area at a particular time. These records should have been diligently and regularly kept, but their survival is somewhat irregular. In a basic record you should find the name of an individual and a place; other records are more detailed with addresses given, family groups shown, and in a small number of cases ages and places of birth. These are valuable census substitutes.\n\nAbbreviations and unusual words and phrases\n\nSome Roman Catholic registers are in Latin. Translating the information given is not very difficult, and you might find a Latin dictionary or glossary will be useful.\n\nThe way registers of baptisms, marriages, burials and other events were recorded can be very idiosyncratic, especially regarding abbreviations used by individual clerks. It is not possible to explain all the content of registers conclusively, but you can find some help with abbreviations and unusual words and phrases in our glossary.\n\nChurch register images\n\nOld Parish Register images are black and white images derived from microfilm and stored in a JPEG format. Roman Catholic register images and other church registers images are stored in a colour jpeg format and are mostly derived from the original records.\n\nWhich parishes and congregations have registers in the index\n\nChurch of Scotland parishes\n\nYou can see a list of old parish registers on the National Records of Scotland site. Bear in mind that the Church of Scotland parishes did not cover the same areas as Roman Catholic parishes and the parishes of other churches.\n\nRoman Catholic parishes and congregations\n\nRegisters
