        "text": "The reunion hit the news, too! There were stories in the Daily Mail, The Herald, The Scotsman, BBC Radio, Press and Journal, Evening Express, and on STV.\n\nThere are lots of lovely school photos that members have put on the study Facebook page, and more photos from the reunion day.\n\nResults from Surveys and Interviews\n\nVolunteering\n\nMembers were very keen to volunteer for more studies. More than 90% were happy to complete a survey, talk to a researcher about growing up, or give a blood sample. Right now, we are organizing another postal survey, and we hope to have more studies for participants to volunteer for soon.\n\n“Give more questionnaires because things change so quickly.”\n\nStudy management\n\nParticipants were satisfied with how the study and research projects are being run by the steering committee and Grampian Data Safe Haven. Many people asked for clear descriptions of the research results, and this is now a top priority for us! In the coming months, we will post summaries of the scientific discoveries made using the Aberdeen Children of the 1950s data.\n\n“Share the general findings of the research, and making us feel that it is of benefit by giving examples of how research findings have helped make things better.”\n\nImportant childhood events\n\nParticipants were asked the key memorable event in their childhood. There were lots of good memories of outings with families and playing with friends. Many mentioned the 11-Plus exams as a big day. People also said they were affected by the illness or loss of a family member. And many remembered the big impact of the typhoid epidemic in Aberdeen in 1964 - with 6 weeks off school.\n\n\"Remember moving house at aged 9, where we had an inside toilet and a bedroom each!\"\n\nNeighbourhoods\n\nStudy members spoke about big changes in their communities since their childhoods. They said that in the 1950s and 1960s, they and their families had close relationships with those living near them. One participant described her childhood street as having “all open doors”. Some said that these days they rely more on friends from work than on their neighbours.\n\n“Where I grew up there was a strong sense of community, people would always be there to help.”\n\nChildhood play\n\nMany described their childhood as having a great deal of freedom, spent outdoors with friends and siblings. Members spoke about playing football in the street and going for picnics at the beach. Several mentioned that Aberdeen always felt like a very safe city. They noted that technology and safety concerns have moved children and the lives of their families indoors today.\n\n\"The beach has changed – it used to have swings and chalets. Families would take picnics and go for the whole day for free.\"\n\nAberdeen\n\nAsked about what makes Aberdeen and Aberdonians special, many mentioned that though it is a small city, Aberdeen has the feel of a village. In particular, that its distance from other cities “being up in our own wee corner of Scotland” has given a strong identity, and sense of community.\n\n“For a growing town it still has a village feel with people looking out for each other.”"
