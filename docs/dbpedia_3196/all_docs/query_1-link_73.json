James was Postmaster in Aiken before being promoted to Augusta in 1975, where he served as Section Center Director of Mail Processing and Manager of Customer Service.

James’ survivors include his wife, Renate Price; his children, Patrick Price (Marianne) and Chad Price and his stepdaughter, Natalie Clarke; his brother, Harold Price (Karen); his grandchildren, Rebecca “Becky” Price, Daniel Price and Angelina Casas; his great grandsons, Atticus and Gustavio and also step- grandchildren.\n\nPer Mr. Price’s wishes, there will be no service.
