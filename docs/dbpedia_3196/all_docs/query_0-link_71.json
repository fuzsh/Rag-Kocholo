        "text": "James Marsh Hendon Jr., 74, of Brandywine, Maryland, passed peacefully on Sunday, July 23, 2023. He was born on September 8, 1948 in Aberdeen, Maryland, to the late Vernice and James Hendon Sr. James attended St. Emma Military Academy in his youth, and later attended the University of Dayton, Ohio. James met and married the love of his life, Mattie Duppins in 1975 at the Smithsonian Institute where James was working at the time. Together they share a loving daughter, Renee Hendon-Bell, 4 grandchildren, and 3 great grandchildren.\n\nJames bravely served in the United States Army as a A7 EM Rifle Expert, Sergeant Missile Guide Repairman, and Hercules Missile Fire Control Crewman and Mechanic. He had many hobbies, including collecting model trains and planes, designing ceramic chess sets, reading science fiction books, playing computer games, fishing, golfing, bowling, and watching plenty of war movies. James will always be remembered and cherished for so many of his qualities and good deeds, including his skills as Grill Master at every family reunion where heâ€™d share Vietnam stories while drinking a cold pepsi."
