        "text": "Famous C3 individuals\n\nAccording to an analysis of the paternal lineages of Tungusic males conducted by Zerjal et al. (2003), Genghis Khan, founder and Great Khan of the Mongol Empire, and his patrilineal descendants are believed to have belonged to Haplogroup C3 (M217).\n\nXue et al. (2005) estimated that Nurhaci (1559-1626), founder and first Emperor of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) of China, and all subsequent Qing emperors, probably belonged to Haplogroup C3c, a subclade that seems to have arisen in Manchuria some 500 years ago. Shin Yan et al. (2014) tested the Y chromosomes of seven modern male individuals who claim belonging to Aisin Gioro family, and they concluded that the haplogroup of the Imperial House of Qing Dynasty was C3b2b1*-M401(xF5483).\n\nFamous D1b1a2 individuals\n\nAccording to this Japanese blog, patrilineal descendants of Emperor Higashiyama had their Y-DNA tested and all belonged to haplogroup D1b1a2 (IMS-JST055457/CTS107), formerly known as D2a1b. Another presumed descendant of the imperial family tested at Family Tree DNA and also belonged to that haplogroup, and more precisely to the D-Z1504 subclade. The article explains that 6 million Japanese men (10% of the male population of Japan) carry the same Y-DNA lineage as the Imperial family and that they share a common ancestor about 1000 years ago. Many medieval emperors had illegitimate offspring (Emperor Saga alone fathered 49 children), who were bestowed the surnames Minamoto (Genji), Taira (Heike) or Tachibana, who in turn became powerful aristocratic clans of their own. The Minamoto and Taira became the ancestors of dozens of samurai clans (see below), while the Tachibana became one of the four most powerful kuge (court nobility) families in Japan's Nara and early Heian periods. A few samurai clans descend from Japanese emperors through imperial princes. This is the case of the Asakura clan. If this is correct, it could mean that all Japanese emperors and a great number of daimyo (feudal lords) and samurai families would have belonged to haplogroup D1b1a2, if non-paternity events did not occur. The other major samurai clans that do not descend from that lineage typically descend from the Fujiwara clan, who belong to haplogroup O1b.\n\nA website published the modal haplotype of Minamoto no Yoritomo (1147-1199), the first shogun of the Kamakura shogunate. He and the Minamonto (aka Genji) clan presumably belonged to the same haplogroup D-Z1504 as the Imperial family, from whom they descend. The Minamoto are the patrilineal ancestors of numerous samurai clans, including the Akamatsu, Akechi, Amago, Arima, Ashikaga (shōguns), Hatakeyama, Hosokawa, Ikeda, Imagawa, Kitabatake, Kuroda, Matsudaira, Miyake, Miyoshi, Mogami, Mori, Nanbu, Nitta, Ogasawara, Ōta, Rokkaku, Sakai, Sasaki, Satake, Satomi, Shiba, Shimazu, Takeda, Toki, Tokugawa (shōguns), Tsuchiya and Yamana. A few kuge (court aristocracy) families also descend from the Minamoto, such as the Koga.\n\nThe Taira clan descends from four 9th-century emperors (Kanmu, Ninmyō, Montoku and Kōkō) and were the ancestors of several daimyo families such as the Ashina, Chiba, Hōjō (shōguns), Kobayakawa, Miura, Sōma, and Oda (whose most famous member was Oda Nobunaga).\n\nFamous E1b1a individuals\n\nZahi Hawass et al. (2012) tested the remains of Ramesses III, the second pharaoh of Egypt's 20th dynasty. Based on 13 STR markers tested his haplogroup can be assigned as E1b1a. The 20th Dynasty of Egypt (1189-1077 BCE) started with Setnakhte and counted nine kings named Ramesses, from III to XI. The pharaohs are buried in the Valley of the Kings.\n\nThe Origins Centre at the University of the Witwatersrand tested the DNA of Nelson Mandela (1918-2013), the famous South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, politician and philanthropist, who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999, and determined that he belonged to haplogroup E1b1a.\n\nFamous E1b1b individuals\n\nE-V13 branch\n\nNeparáczki et al. (2022) analysed the DNA of the remains of John Corvinus and his son Christopher Corvinus, the two last members of the Hunyadi family. Both of them carried the Y-chromosome haplogroup is E1b1b1a1b1a6a1c (E-V13 > CTS12223 > BY3880 > E5017 > CTS9320 > Z17264 > PH1173). John's father, Matthias Corvinus (1443-1490) was King of Hungary and Croatia, and disputed King of Bohemia and Duke of Austria.\n\nGjergj Kastrioti Skënderbe, also known as Skanderbeg (1405-1468), was an Albanian feudal lord and military commander who led a rebellion against the Ottoman Empire in what is today Albania, North Macedonia, Greece, Kosovo, Montenegro and Serbia. One of his patrilineal descendants was identified as a member of haplogroup E-V13 > Z17107.\n\nThe Scottish Clan Colquhoun/Calhoun from Dunbartonshire belongs to the clade E-V13 > BY3880 > Y16729 > Y16721 > Y16733 according to the Calhoun Surname Project. The most prominent member is probably John C. Calhoun (17821850), who was the seventh Vice President of the United States. He is best remembered for being a strong defender of slavery. His beliefs and warnings heavily influenced the South's secession from the Union in 186061.\n\nGiuseppe Garibaldi (1807-1882), the general, politician and nationalist who played a large role in the history of Italy, probably belonged to haplogroup E-V13 based on the Y-DNA results from another Garibaldi from the same province in his ancestral Liguria.\n\nThe Wright Brothers, the inventors of the world's first successful airplane, belonged to haplogroup E-V13. They were supposedly descended from Robert Wright of Brook Hall, Essex, England, which allowed the Wright Surname DNA Project to isolate their paternal lineage.\n\nLyndon B. Johnson (1908-1973), the 36th President of the United States, was identified as a member of haplogroup E1b1b1 through the Johnson/Johnston/Johnstone DNA Surname Project. His haplotype, although not confirmed by SNP testing yet, is predicted as E-V13.\n\nAccording to the DNA results of a relative, Google co-founder Larry Page (b. 1973) might belong to haplogroup E-V13. As of November 2016, he was the 12th richest person in the world.\n\nE-M34 branch\n\nThe Harvey Y-DNA Genetic Project managed to retrace the ancestry and identify the Y-chromosomal haplogroup of William Harvey (1578 -1657), the first person to describe completely and in detail the systemic circulation and properties of blood being pumped to the body by the heart. He belonged to the subclade E-M34.\n\nGérard Lucotte et al. (2012) recovered the DNA of Napoleon Bonaparte from beard hair follicules and compared his Y-DNA to that of one of his present-day descendants, Charles Napoléon. They established that both men belonged to haplogroup E-M34, a subclade which is thought to have reached Mediterranean Europe from the Levant during the Neolithic period. Napoleon I had previously been identified by Lucotte's team as a member of mtDNA haplogroup H.\n\nThe acclaimed theoretical physicist Albert Einstein is presumed to have belonged to Y-haplogroup E-Z830 based on the results from a patrilineal descendant of Naphtali Hirsch Einstein, Albert Einstein's great-grand-father. Approximately 20% of Ashkenazi Jews belong to haplogroup E1b1b.\n\nSteven Pinker is a Canadian experimental psychologist, cognitive scientist, linguist, and popular science author. He is Johnstone Family Professor in the Department of Psychology at Harvard University, and is known for his advocacy of evolutionary psychology and the computational theory of mind.\n\nThe American actor and producer Nicolas Cage (born 1964),has been found to belong to haplogroup E1b1b-M84. His real name is Nicolas Kim Coppola, and his paternal great-grand-father emigrated to the U.S. from the South Italian town of Bernalda in Basilicata. He is the nephew of screenwriter, film director and producer Francis Ford Coppola, who shares the same haplogroup.\n\nE-M81 branch\n\nFranz Kafka, a German-speaking Bohemian novelist and short-story writer, who is widely regarded as one of the major figures of 20th-century literature probably belonged to E-Y161794, a Jewish branch of haplogroup E-M81, based on the Y-DNA test of another Kafka from Czechia at FTDNA.\n\nThe French footballer of Algerian origin Zinedine Zidane (born 1972), is a member of haplogroup E1b1b (M81) according to his brother's DNA test. Zidane was named the best European footballer of the past 50 years in the UEFA Golden Jubilee Poll.\n\nUndetermined E1b1b branch\n\nThe remains of the great Italian Baroque painter Caravaggio (1571-1610) were excavated to confirm the circumstances of his mysterious death at the age of 38. His DNA was compared to modern carriers of the same surname. The study revealed that he belonged to haplogroup E1b1b1.\n\nRonny Decorte, a geneticist from the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, tested relatives of Adolf Hitler and determined that the Fürher belonged to haplogroup E1b1b. Ironically this haplogroup thought to be at the origin of Afro-Asiatic languages, which includes the Semitic languages and peoples that Hitler despised so much.\n\nSir David Attenborough (b. 1926), an English broadcaster and naturalist at the BBC explained in the Tree of Life how the Attenboroughs belonged to haplogroup E1b1b1. In 2002 he was named among the 100 Greatest Britons following a UK-wide vote. His brother is the producer, director and actor Richard Attenborough (b. 1923 - pictured), who won two Academy Awards for Gandhi in 1983.\n\nFamous G2a individuals\n\nÖtzi the Iceman, Europe's oldest natural human mummy, dating from 5,300 years ago, had his full genome sequenced (the oldest European genome ever tested) and was found to belong to haplogroup G2a-L91 (G2a2a2, formerly known as G2a4).\n\nOn 12 September 2012, archeologists from the University of Leicester announced that they had discovered what they believed were the remains of King Richard III of England (1452-1485) within the former Greyfriars Friary Church in the city of Leicester (see Exhumation of Richard III). The skeleton's DNA matched exactly the mitochondiral haplogroup (J1c2c) of modern matrilineal descendants of Anne of York, Richard's elder sister, confirming the identity of the medieval king. Further tests published in December 2014 revealed that his Y-chromosomal haplogroup was G2 (not tested for downstream mutations, but statistically very likely to be G2a3 as a northern European). This however did not match the Y-DNA of three modern relatives (who were all R1b-U152 xL2) descended from Edward III, Richard III's great-great-grand-father. Richard descends from the House of York, while the modern relatives descend from the House of Lancaster via John of Gaunt. Therefore it cannot be determined at present when the non-paternity event occured in the Plantagenet lineage, and whether most of the Plantagenets monarchs belonged to haplogroup G2 or R1b-U152. Both haplogroups are considerably more common in France than in Britain, however, which is consistent with the French roots of the House of Plantagenets.\n\nJoseph Stalin (1878-1953), who ruled the Soviet Union from the mid-1920s until his death, was of Georgian origin and belonged to haplogroup G2a1a. This was determined by testing his grandson, Alexander Burdonsky (his son Vasily's son).\n\nAl Capone (1899-1947), sometimes known by the nickname \"Scarface\", was an American gangster and businessman who attained notoriety during the Prohibition era as the co-founder and boss of the Chicago Outfit. His seven-year reign as a crime boss ended when he went to prison at the age of 33. According to Geni.com, he was a member of haplogroup G2a-P303.\n\nRichard Stockton (1730-1781),was an American lawyer, jurist, legislator, and a signer of the Declaration of Independence. His son, another Richard Stockton (1764-1828) was a senator for New Jersey, and his grandson, Robert F. Stockton (1795-1866) was a United States Navy commodore, notable in the capture of California during the MexicanAmerican War. He was a naval innovator and an early advocate for a propeller-driven, steam-powered navy. They descend from Richard Stockton (1665-1709) from Princeton, NJ, whose lineage was determined to be G2a-L497 > Z1816 > FGC809 > Z39863 by the Stockton Surname DNA Project.\n\nThe American rock singer Alice Cooper (born Vincent Damon Furnier, 1948), who has been dubbed \"The Godfather of Shock Rock\", probably belongs to haplogroup G2a-L497 > Z1816 > Z726 > Z16775 > Z17394 > Z34079 (aka FT106898), based on the testing of his distant paternal cousin Vincent Furnier.\n\nLarry Bird (b. 1956), an American professional basketball executive, former coach and former player for the Boston Celtics, is thought to belong to haplogroup G-Z6748 (downstream of Z1816 and Y8903) based on the testing of several relatives descending from Thomas Bird at the Haplogroup G-L497 Y-DNA Project. Larry Bird is the only person in NBA history to be named Most Valuable Player, Coach of the Year, and Executive of the Year.\n\nFamous H2 individuals\n\nK. Drosou et al. (2020) analysed the DNA of two high-status Egyptian priests from the 12th Dynasty from what is known as the Tomb of Two Brothers, Nakht-Ankh and Khnum-Nakht. Their mtDNA haplogroup was assessed as M1a1. Their genetic analysis demonstrated that the two men were actually half brothers, sharing the same mother but different fathers. Although the study does not mention their haplogroups, further analysis of the data revealed that Nakht-Ankh belonged to Y-haplogroup H2, a very rare lineage today, but which was consistently found among Early Neolithic farmers from the Levant, Anatolia and parts of Europe.\n\nFamous I1 individuals\n\nMalmströma et al. tested the DNA of Birger Jarl and his son Eric Birgersson, and they were identified as members of haplogroup I1. Birger Jarl was one of Sweden's greatest medieval statesman. He was the founder of Stockholm, and acted as regent of Sweden for 18 years. His sons Valdemar and Magnus suceeded each others as kings of Sweden, and their descendants for one hundred years. This dynasty is known as the House of Bjelbo, and all six kings were presumably members of haplogroup I1.\n\nBased on the numerous results from the Gentis Grimaldorum DNA Project, the original House of Grimaldi, which inlcuded the Lords then Princes of Monaco until Louis II of Monaco (1870-1949), belonged to a Scandinavian branch of haplogroup I1-L22 > Y3549 > P109 > Y3662 > S14887. The House of Grimaldi also produced three doges of Genoa, a prince of Salerno, and several archbishops and cardinals. The current Princes of Monaco descend from the House of Polignac.\n\nClan Hamilton is a Lowland Scottish clan whose chiefs descend from Walter fitz Gilbert of Hambledon in 14th-century Lanarkshire. One branch of the clan acquired the titles of Laird of Cadzow (c. 1315), Lord Hamilton (1445), Earl of Arran (1503), Marquess of Hamilton (1599), and eventually Duke of Hamilton (1643) until the 12th duke died without male heir in 1895 and the title passed to Clan Douglas. Another branch became Lords Paisley (1587), Earls of Abercorn (1606), Marquesses of Abercorn (1790), and Dukes of Abercorn (1868) to this day. Hundreds of participants tested at the Hamilton DNA Project, including a close relative of the current Duke of Abercorn. The project proved conclusively that all Hamilton branches descending from Sir James Hamilton, 5th Laird of Cadzow, progenitor of both aforementioned branches, belong to I1-Z63 > BY151 > FGC81364 > S2078 > S2077 > Y2245 > L1237 > Y6634 > FGC9549 > Y6615, with a most recent common ancestor living about 750 years ago.\n\nClan Lyon is a Scottish clan of Anglo-Norman origin descended from Ingelram de Lyons, Lord of Lyons, who arrived in England with the Norman Conquest. The main Scottish branch descends from John Lyon, Lord of Glamis (c.1340-1382), who was Chamberlain of Scotland between 1377 and 1382. The clan chiefs later held the title of Lord Glamis (from 1445), Earls of Kinghorne (1606), and eventually Earls of Strathmore and Kinghorne from 1677 to this day. The 9th Earl took his wife's surname (Bowes), and his descendants carried the hyphenated Lyon-Bowes or Bowes-Lyon patronym. The 14th Earl, Claude Bowes-Lyon was the father of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother and the maternal grandfather of Queen Elizabeth II. Results from the Lyon(s) Surname DNA Project indicate that the aristocratic branch of Clan Lyon belongs to I1-L22 > Z2338 > P109 > S10891, a clade associated with the Viking migrations and the Normans. Several of the tested participants descend from the 4th Earl.\n\nThe Lee family of Virginia and Maryland has been found to belong to haplogroup I1-L22 > P109 > S10891 > Y13930 > Y14227 > Y14225 based on descendant testing. Famous members include Richard Lee I (16171664), founder of the family and wealthy landowner, Richard Henry Lee (1732-1794), one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, and General Robert E. Lee (1807-1870), who was commander of the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War.\n\nResults from the Wilson DNA Project helped determine that the American statesmen, politician, legal scholar, and Founding Father James Wilson (1742-1798) most probably belonged to haplogroup I1. Wilson was elected twice to the Continental Congress, was a signatory of the United States Declaration of Independence, and was a major force in drafting the United States Constitution.\n\nThe Hamilton DNA Project compared the Y-DNA of four descendants of Alexander Hamilton (1755-1804), one of the a Founding Fathers of the United States of America. All shared very close STR values, proving beyond reasonable doubt that they shared a same recent patrilineal ancestor. His deep clade would be I1-Z58 > Z59 > CTS8647 > Z61 > Z60 > Z140 > Z141 > Y15150 > Y48678.\n\nAndrew Jackson (1767-1845), the 7th president of the United States, most probably belonged to haplogroup I1 based on a comparison of his genealogy and results from the Jackson DNA Project. A distant relative of his was Lieutenant General Thomas Jonathan \"Stonewall\" Jackson (1824-1863), the best-known Confederate commanders of the American Civil War after General Robert E. Lee. Both of them are descended from Sir Anthony Jackson (1594-1666) from Yorkshire, England.\n\nA team of geneticists analysed the DNA of the great German classical composer Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827). They concluded that he belonged to haplogroup I1a-Z138.\n\nAmerican inventor and painter Samuel Morse (1791-1872) presumably belonged to haplogroup I1-L22 based on results from the Morse/Moss DNA Project (Family 1, descendant of Anthony Morse, 1606-1686, from Wiltshire, England). After having established his reputation as a portrait painter, in his middle age Morse contributed to the invention of a single-wire telegraph system based on European telegraphs. He was a co-developer of Morse code and helped to develop the commercial use of telegraphy.\n\nThe haplogroup of the celebrated Russian writer Count Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy, usually known as Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910), was inferred by testing one of his descendants, Pyotr Tolstoy. He is regarded as one of the greatest authors of all time, and is best known for the novels War and Peace (1869) and Anna Karenina (1877), often cited as pinnacles of realist fiction.\n\nThe 21st president of the United States, Chester A. Arthur (1829-1886), probably belonged to haplogroup I1-Z63 > BY151 > BY351 based on results from the Arthur/MacArthur DNA Project, as a descendant of Thomas Barnabas Arthur (1680-1725) from Cullybacky, County Antrim, Ireland.\n\nJohn Harvey Kellogg (1852-1943) and his brother Will Keith Kellogg (1860-1951), the inventors of the corn flakes and founders of the Kellog's breakfast cereal brand, belonged to I1-Z58 > Z138 > S2293 > S6277 > Y16450 > A14623 based on relative testing. A distant cousin of his, Frank B. Kellogg (1856-1937) was the 45th U.S. Secretary of State and co-author of the KelloggBriand Pact, for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1929.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt (1858-1919), the 26th President of the United States from 1901 to 1909, and his fifth cousin Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882-1945), the 32nd President of the United States from 1933 to 1945, both belonged to haplogroup I1-Z382 (Z382 > FGC24333 > S26361 > S16414 > S22349 > FGC24357 > FGC24347 > FGC24356 > S10350 > BY19383 > Y125947 > S14393 > FT268649 > BY213758) according to the testing of relatives as reported by Family Tree DNA.\n\nCordell Hull (1871-1955) was an American politician from Tennessee and the longest-serving U.S. Secretary of State, holding the position for 11 years (19331944) in the administration of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt during most of World War II. Hull received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1945 for his role in establishing the United Nations, and was referred to by President Roosevelt as the \"Father of the United Nations\". According to the testing of numerous relatives, he belonged to I1-Z58 > Z59 > Z60 > CTS7362 > Z73 > Y3657 > Z2900 > Y7654 > S2122 > Y11026 > Y13938 (aka BY2841).\n\nCalvin Coolidge (1872-1933), the 30th President and 29th Vice President of the United States, was identified as a member of haplogroup I1 according to testing of relatives. He is praised by advocates of smaller government and laissez-faire economics, while supporters of an active central government generally view him less favorably, although most praise his stalwart support of racial equality.\n\nGeneral George C. Marshall (1880-1959) was an American solider and statesman who served as Chief of Staff under presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, then as Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense under Truman. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1953 for his role in elaborating the Marshall Plan of U.S. foreign aid to Western Europe after WWII. Winston Churchill lauded Marshall as the \"organizer of victory\" for his leadership of the Allied victory in World War II. According to the testing of relatives, he would have belonged to haplogroup I1-Z138.\n\nAccording to descendant testing published on Geni.com, the Nevanlinna family of Finland belongs to haplogroup I1. Notable members include mathematician Rolf Nevanlinna (1895-1980), after whom the Nevanlinna Prize was named; population geneticist Harri Nevanlinna; architect Arne Nevanlinna; composer Tapio Nevanlinna; and philosopher Tuomas Nevanlinna.\n\nAmerican writer and Nobel Prize laureate William Faulkner (1897-1962) was a member of haplogroup I1-Z60 > Z140 > Z141 according to results from the Faulconer DNA Project. Faulkner is one of the most celebrated writers in American literature generally and Southern literature specifically. He is primarily known for his novels and short stories set in the fictional Yoknapatawpha County, based on Lafayette County, Mississippi, where he spent most of his life.\n\nJimmy Carter (b. 1922), the 39th President of the United States from 1977 to 1981, appears to belong to haplogroup I1 according to the testing of a close relative as indicated on Geni.com\n\nThe personal genomics company 23andMe tested the Y-chromosomal haplogroup of business magnate and multi-billionaire Warren Buffett and singer/film producer Jimmy Buffett to determine whether they shared a common patrilineal ancestor. Both men were found to belong to haplogroup I1, though apparently not to closely related subclades.\n\nBill Clinton (born 1946), who served as the 42nd President of the United States from 1993 to 2001, most probably belonged to haplogroup I1 based on the results of distant cousins testing available at Ysearch.org.\n\nThe English musician, singer-songwriter, and actor Gordon Matthew Thomas Sumner, known professionally by his stage name Sting (b. 1951), was revealed to belong to haplogroup I1 by the PBS TV series Finding Your Roots. He was the principal songwriter, lead singer, and bassist for the new wave rock band The Police from 1977 to 1984, before launching a solo career. With The Police, Sting became one of the world's best-selling music artists. Solo and with The Police combined, he has sold over 100 million records.\n\nI2a1a-L161.1 (British Isles)\n\nClan chiefs of Highland Scottish Clan Munro (Munros of Foulis) belong to haplogroup I2a1a-L161.1 > S2639 > A812 > Y12072 > Y12070 > PF4135 > Y11772 > Y12075 > Y12073, based on the testing of numerous clan members at Munro DNA Project.The American statesman James Monroe (1758-1831), one of the Founding Fathers of the United States and the 5th President of the United States from 1817 to 1825, was a descendant of the clan.\n\nI2a1a-L233 branch\n\nThe Lowland Scottish Clan Lindsay descends from Sir Walter de Lindissie, who accompanied David of Scotland, Earl of Huntingdon, to claim his throne. According to Linday International, descendants from this lineage belong to haplogroup I2a1a-S21825 > Y4213 > Y4192 > L1287 > L233 > A8462 > FT11343 (aka Y36039), with a most recent common ancestor going back about 1000 years ago. The Lindsays have possessed the title of Earl of Crawford since 1398 (one of the most ancient extant titles in Great Britain), then also of Earl of Lindsay since 1633 and Earl of Balcarres since 1651.\n\nI2a1a-M26 branch\n\nSeveral branches of the Lowland Scottish Clan Barclay were tested at the Clan Barclay International DNA Project. Most branches (Towie, Collairnie, Fife, Kilbirnie, Perceton) were found to belong to haplogroup I2a1a-M26 > L160 > PF4088 > PF4189 > Y84594 > BY68371. In the 17th century, the Barclay de Tolly, a branch of the Barclay of Towie from Banffshire, migrated to Mecklenburg, and later to what is now Latvia and Lithuania. Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly (1761-1818) was a Baltic German field marshal and Minister of War of the Russian Empire during Napoleon's invasion in 1812 and the War of the Sixth Coalition. He was elevated to the rank of prince in 1815, a title that his descendants would keep until the 20th century.\n\nI2a1b-L621 (Slavic)\n\nThe famous Protestant reformer Martin Luther appears to have belonged to haplogroup I2a-Din-N (L147.2, aka CTS5966 or CTS10228) according to probable relatives whose haplotypes can be found on the Luther Surname DNA Project, including one genealogically traceable 1st cousin 13 times removed, as well as other relatives on ySearch (especially ySearch ID: YTE6E).\n\nMiklós Horthy (1868-1957), was Regent of of the Kingdom of Hungary from 1920 to 1944. Prior to this, Admiral Horthy served as commander-in-chief of the Austro-Hungarian Navy in the last year of the First World War. In 1919, he ousted the communists of Béla Kun from Hungary and banned the Hungarian Communist Party. The following year was declared Regent and Head of State. Cousins of Horthy posted their Y-DNA results at MolGen, and all belonged to I2a-Din-N (or I2a1b3a in current ISOGG nomenclature).\n\nAccording to the results of a cousin posted on Poreklo, the Serbian tennis player Novak Djokovic (b. 1987) belongs to I2-PH908 (downstream of L147.2 and S17250).

Somerland drove the Vikings out of Scotland and became King of Mann and the Isles. He was the founder of Clan Somhairle, the father of the founder of Clan MacDougall, and the paternal grandfather of the founder of Clan Donald (which includes the MacDonalds and MacAlisters). The researcher reported that the tested members of these clans with a confirmed paper trail all belonged to the Norwegian variety of R1a-L448, and more specifically to the subclade L176.1, which to date has been found almost exclusively among the descendants of Somerled. In 2005, geneticist Bryan Sykes asked for DNA samples from clan chiefs (Lord Godfrey Macdonald, Sir Ian Macdonald of Sleat, Ranald MacDonald of Clan Ranald, William McAlester of Loup and Ranald MacDonnell of Glengary) to complete the project, and all matched the presumed Somerled haplotype. Not all Macdonalds, MacAlisters and MacDougalls are descended from Somerled though. The majority (about 70%) are members of the Celtic haplogroup R1b. Check the Donald Clan Genetic Genealogy Project for more information.\n\nClan Cochrane is a Lowlands Scottish clan descending from a Viking who settled in what is now Renfrewshire.

However, the testing of actual relatives, published on the Serbian DNA Project at Poreklo, showed that his Y-DNA line was more probably R1a-M458 (L1029 subclade).\n\nA forensic analysis was conducted by McCall et al. (2019) to solve the Doppelgänger conspiracy theory regarding Rudolf Hess (1894-1987), a Nazi politician who was Deputy Führer to Adolf Hitler from 1933 to 1941. Hess flew solo to Scotland in an attempt to negotiate peace with the United Kingdom during World War II. He was taken prisoner and eventually convicted of crimes against peace, serving a life sentence until his suicide in 1987. He hqs been speculqted thqt the prisoner was an imposter and not Rudolf Hess. The DNA analysis of the only known extant DNA sample from prisoner Spandau #7 proved to be a match to the Hess male line, thereby refuting the Doppelgänger Theory.\n\nR1a-Z280 branch (Balto-Slavic)\n\nThe Swedish actor Max von Sydow, who played in eleven films by Ingmar Bergman and many Hollywood movies and series, including more recently Game of Thrones, was identified as a member of haplogroup R1a-Z280 (Pomeranian P269 subclade) through the the test of a 2nd paternal cousin at FTDNA.\n\nKing Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, belongs to haplogroup R1a-Z280 (north-western Slavic S18681 subclade) according to the testing of a distant cousin with FTDNA. He is the son of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands and German diplomat Claus von Amsberg, whose family hails from Mecklenburg.\n\nR1a-Z92 branch (East Slavic)\n\nThe Russian poet, playwright, and novelist of the Romantic era Alexander Pushkin (1799-1837), who is considered by many to be the greatest Russian poet and the founder of modern Russian literature, probably belonged to R1a-Z92 > YP617 > YP682 according to the testing of a distant cousin descending from Gregory \"Pushka\" Alexandrovich Morhinin, founder of the Pushkin family (reported on the Serbian genealogy website poreklo.rs).\n\nR1a-Z93 branch (Indo-Iranian)\n\nBased on descendant testing, it appears most likely that the sultans of the Ottoman dynasty belonged to haplogroup R1a-Z93. This has not been officially confirmed yet. All sultans of the Ottoman Empire (1299-1922) descend in patrilineal line from Osman I, making it one of the longest reigning Y-chromosomal lineage in history.\n\nThe Israeli politician Benjamin Netanyahu, who has served four times as Prime Minister of Israel, belongs to haplogroup R1a-Z93 (Jewish Y2630 subclade) according to his brother's Ido's DNA test at FTDNA.\n\nUnknown R1a branch\n\nThe DNA of King Béla III of Hungary (c. 1148-1196) was tested by Olasz et al. (2018). His Y-DNA was identified as R1a (possibly the Z93 branch and Z2123>Y934 clade based on STR values, but unconfirmed), while his mtDNA was H1b. Béla was a member of the Árpád dynasty, which ruled over Hungary (and Croatia from 1091) from the arrival of the Magyars in the 9th century until 1301.\n\nA team led by Prof. Albinas Kuncevičius tested the DNA extracted from the remains of Mikołaj \"the Red\" Radziwiłł (1512-1584), Count Palatine of Vilnius and Grand Chancellor of Lithuania, and of his son Mikołaj Radziwiłł (1546-1589). They identified them as a members of haplogroup R1a. By extension, the whole Radziwiłł family would belong to that haplogroup. The Radziwiłł are a princely lineage originally from Lithuania who also played an important role in Belarusian, Polish and German history.\n\nFamous R1b individuals\n\nR1b-S1200 branch\n\nThe Adams Surname Y-DNA Project compared the Y-DNA of 15 families that have an oral history of being related to the US Presidents John Adams (second president of the United States) and his son John Quincy Adams (6th president). All the men tested share the same haplotype that falls into haplogroup R1b-S1200 > S14328 > S1196 > S6868 > FGC23892. The statesman, political philosopher, and Founding Father Samuel Adams (1722-1803) also shares the same paternal lineage.\n\nThe great American inventor Thomas Alva Edison (1847-1931) appears to have belonged to R1b-S1200 > S14328 > SZ5489 > Y28597 > S10242 according to the Edison Y-DNA project (lineage 1). Edison was of one of the most prolific inventors in history with 1,093 US patents in his name. He invented among others the phonograph, the automatic telegraph, the movie camera, the alkaline battery and the long-lasting, practical electric light bulb.\n\nR1b-U106 branch (Germanic)\n\nLarmuseau et al. (2013) tested the Y-DNA of three living members of the House of Bourbon, one descending from Louis XIII of France via King Louis Philippe I, and two from Louis XIV via Philip V of Spain. They concluded that all three men share the same STR haplotype and belonged to haplogroup R1b-U106 (Z381* subclade). These results contradict earlier studies by Lalueza-Fox et al. (2010), who had analysed the DNA from a handkerchief dipped in the presumptive blood of Louis XVI after his execution, as well as by Charlier et al. (2012), who tested the DNA of the severed head which allegedly belonged to Henry IV of France. Both of these studies had identified the remains as belonging to haplogroup G2a. All kings of France being descended in patrilineal line from Robert the Strong (820-866), unless a non-paternity event happened some time before Louis XIII, it can be assumed that all kings of France belonged to the same R1b-Z381 lineage. The House of Bourbon also includes all the kings of Spain from Philip V (1683-1746) to this day with King Juan Carlos, all the kings of the Two Sicilies, the grand dukes of Luxembourg since 1964, and of course all the dukes of Orléans and the dukes of Bourbon.\n\nThe lineage of the House of Wettin was identified as R1b-U106 > Z2265 > Z381 > Z156 > Z305 > Z307 > Z304 > DF98 > S18823 > S22069 > Y17440 > A6535 by the testing of two known descendants of the Wettin line by Brad Michael Little. The results confirmed that the two men, who share a common ancestor in Francis, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, possess the same haplogroup and haplotype. Members of the House of Wettin include the Kings Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII and George VI of the United Kingdom, all the Kings of the Belgians, the Kings of Portugal from 1853 to 1910, the Kings of Bulgaria from 1887 to 1946, several Kings of Poland and Grand Dukes of Lithuania, the Margraves of Meissen from 1075 to 1423, the Electors of Saxony from 1423 to 1806, the Kings of Saxony from 1806 to 1918, and the rulers of the numerous smaller Saxon duchies.\n\nClan Gordon is a Scottish clan originating in the 12th century in the Scottish Borders region. The main branch descends from Elizabeth Gordon, daughter of Sir Adam Gordon, who married Alexander Seton in 1408. Their son was Alexander Gordon, 1st Earl of Huntly (d. 1470), whose patrilineal line was therefore Seton/Seaton and not the original Gordon lineage, was the progenitor of all the subsequent chiefs of clan. His descendants later became Marquesses of Huntly (1599-present), as well as Dukes of Gordon from 1684 to 1836. A cadet branch of the Huntly became Earls of Aberdeen (1682), then Marquesses of Aberdeen and Temair from 1916. The Gordon DNA Project identified the aristocratic Seton-Gordon line as R1b-U106 > Z2265 > S12025 > FGC52782 > FGC15048 (and matching people with the surname Seaton). The parent clade (FGC52782) has been found in Scandinavia and points to a common ancestor living a bit over 1000 years ago, suggesting that the Seton-Gordon line was of Viking origin.\n\nThe main branch of Scottish Clan Sinclair, whose clan chief has held the title of Earl of Orkney from 1379 to 1479, then of Earl of Caithness since 1455, belongs to R1b-U106 > Z381 > L48 > Z9 > Z30 > Z7 > Z346 > S5246 > S5629 > FGC15254 > FGC35613 > ZS5151 according to the St Clair/Sinclair DNA Project.\n\nThe main branch of Scottish Clan Boyd, whose clan chief has held the title of Lord Boyd (1454) then of Earl of Kilmarnock from 1661 to 1746, belongs to R1b-U106 > Z381 > S1684 > U198 > S15627 > DF89 > FGC12770 > FT69836 > JFS0024 according to the Boyd DNA Project.\n\nA descendant of Thomas Cecil, 1st Earl of Exeter (1542-1623) tested at the Cecil DNA Project and belongs to R1b-U106 > Z381 > L48 > Z9 > Z331 > Z330 > Y6669 > S21728 > FGC18850 > Y21406 > Y20959 > FGC51954. His half-brother was Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury. Assuming that there hasn't been any non-paternity event on either line, all the He was the progenitors of all the Earls, then Earls and Marquesses of Exeter and the Earls and Marquesses of Salisbury would belong to this haplogroup. The most famous member was probably Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury who served as British prime minister three times for a total of over thirteen years under Queen Victoria.\n\nBenjamin Franklin (1706-1790), a polymath and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, whose head has featured on the $100 bills since 1914, is a probable member of haplogroup R1b-U106 > Z18 > DF95 according to the testing of relatives. Ben Franklin was a political theorist, a statesnman, a diplomat, and a scientist, among others. He is also known for being the inventor of the lightning rod, bifocals, and the Franklin stove.\n\nJohn Witherspoon (1723-1794) was one of the Founding Father of the United States and the president of Princeton University from 1768 to 1794. He was the only active clergyman and the only college president to sign the Declaration of Independence. Based on results from the Witherspoon DNA Project was a member of R1b-U106 > S263 > L48 > L47 > Z159 > Z4714 > BY35813 > BY56495.\n\nJohn Rutledge (1739-1800) and his brother Edward Rutledge (1749-1800) were both Founding Fathers of the United States. Edward was the youngest signatory of the United States Declaration of Independence. John was one of the original Associate Justices of the Supreme Court and as its second Chief Justice. He also served as first governor of South Carolina after the Declaration of Independence, while he brother was the 10th governor. Descendant testing from the Rutledge/Routledge DNA Project determined that they belonged to R1b-U106 > S263 > L48 > L47 > L44 > L163 > Y23482 > Y23476 .\n\nJames K. Polk (1795-1849), the 11th president of the United States, was a member of L48 subclade based on the results from the Polk-Pollock DNA Project. He was a descendant of William Polk/Pollock (c. 1700-1757). Polk is chiefly known for extending the territory of the United States through the MexicanAmerican War; during his presidency, the United States expanded significantly with the annexation of the Republic of Texas, the Oregon Territory, and the Mexican Cession following the American victory in the MexicanAmerican War.\n\nFranklin Pierce (1804-1869), the 14th president of the United States, was a member of R1b-U106 > Z381 > Z156 > S497 > DF96 based on the results from the Pierce DNA Project (North) (Group C). Pierce was a northern Democrat who believed that the abolitionist movement was a fundamental threat to the unity of the nation, he alienated anti-slavery groups by supporting and signing the KansasNebraska Act and enforcing the Fugitive Slave Act.\n\nNathan Bedford Forrest (1821-1877) was a prominent Confederate Army general during the American Civil War, renowned as a cavalry leader and military strategist. He was the only general on either side who began as a private. After the war he became the first Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, which has made him a controversial figure in American history. His lineage was identified (group B) in the Forrest/Forrester DNA Project, which makes him a member of R1b-U106 > S263 > S499 > L48 > Z9 > Z30 > Z349 > Z2 > Z7 > S5945 > FGC17344 > Y28576 > FGC51332.\n\nAccording to the Grant DNA Project, Ulysses S. Grant (1822-1885), the 18th President of the United States and the military commander of the American Civil War, belonged to R1b-U106 > S263 > S499 > L48 > L47 > Z159 > S3249 > Y2924 > Y3264 > FGC8590 (descendant of Matthew Graunt).\n\nWilliam Howard Taft (1857-1930), the 27th President of the United States and the tenth Chief Justice of the United States, belonged to R1b-U106 > Z381 > Z301 >Z30 > Z338 > FGC1954 according to the results from the Taaffe DNA Project (descendant of Robert Taft, 1640-1725). Taft also served as 6th Solicitor General of the United States (1890-1892), Governor-General of the Philippines (1901-1903), 42th United States Secretary of War (1904-1908), and 1st Provisional Governor of Cuba (1906).\n\nAmerican journalist and writer Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961), who won the Nobel Prize of Literature in 1954, was a descendant of Ralph Hemingway who emigrated from England to Boston, MA. As such he must have belonged to R1b-U106 > Z381 > Z301 > L48 > L47 > Z159 > FGC15335 according to the Hemingway Y-DNA Project.\n\nThe two first human beings to have their whole genome sequenced, James D. Watson, the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA, and biologist Craig Venter both happen to be members of Y-DNA haplogroup R1b-S21 (U106), although they belong to distinct subclades (L48 > Z9 > Z30 for Watson, and L48 > L47 > L44 > L163 > L46 > L45 for Venter). Though both are American citizens, their patrilineal ancestors are respectively Scottish and German.\n\nActor Alec Baldwin (b. 1958) is a descendant of John Baldwin (1635-1683) of Stonington, Connecticut, which places him in the R1b-U106 cluster in the Baldwin Surname DNA Project. Nevgen assign his haplotype to R1b-U106 > Z381 > Z156 > BY12482 with 100% certainty. Baldwin won two Primetime Emmy Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, and seven Screen Actors Guild Awards, making him the male performer with the most SAG Awards in history.\n\nThe Academy Award nominated American actor and a playwright Woody Harrelson (b. 1961) belongs to haplogroup R1b-U106 > Z2265 > Z18 > Z372 > ZP91 > ZP158 > ZP161 > ZP262 according to the Harrelson DNA Project (descendant of Paul Harrelson from Denmark).\n\nR1b-P312 branch (Celtic)\n\nThe Grant DNA Project identified the main lineage of Clan Grant descending from Duncan Grant of Freuchie (c. 1413-1485), 1st Laird of Freuchie and other early chiefs as belonging to R1b-P312 > DF19 > DF88 > Z17274. Later chiefs became Earls of Seafield (1701 to present), Barons Strathspey (1858 to present)\n\nThe ancestral lineage of Lowland Scottish Clan Armstrong appears to be R1b-P312 > FGC84729 > ZZ37 > ZZ38 > Z30597 > Z30600 > Z39305 > A9439 > FT275048 according to the Armstrong Y-DNA Project. The most famous member of the clan was probably the astronaut Neil Armstrong, who was the first person to walk on the Moon, and who took with him a piece of the Clan Armstrong tartan.\n\nThe remains of Philip Calvert (c.1626-1682), 5th governor of Maryland, were analysed by Reich at al. (2016) at Harvard Medical School and found to belong to haplogroup R1b-P312 > DF19 > DF88 > FGC11833 > S4281 > S4268 > Z17112 > S17075 > S10067. He was the son of George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, who was Secretary of State under King James I, and the brother of Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, after whom the city of Baltimore was named, and of Leonard Calvert, 1st Proprietary-Governor of Maryland.\n\nThe influential Randolph family of Virginia belongs to R1b-P312 > Z39300 (aka PH2278) based on the results from the Randolph/Randall/Randle/Randol Surname Group (Albemarle County group). The family contributed numerous politicians, statesmen and military officers in the course of U.S. history. The most prominent carrier of the Randolph name was perhaps Peyton Randolph (1721-1775), who served as the the first President of the Continental Congress during the American Revolution. Edmund Randolph (1753-1813) was the seventh Governor of Virginia, the second Secretary of State, and the first United States Attorney General during George Washington's presidency. George W. Randolph (1818-1867) was a Confederate general who served for eight months in 1862 as the Confederate States Secretary of War during the American Civil War.\n\nWoodrow Wilson, 28th President of the United States, belonged to haplogroup R1b-P312 > Z30597 based on the testing of a descendant of his grandfather, Judge James Wilson (1787-1850) at the Wilson DNA Project (Genetic Family ZZN). Wilson served as the president of Princeton University and as the 34th governor of New Jersey before winning the 1912 presidential election. As president, he oversaw the passage of progressive legislative policies unparalleled until the New Deal in 1933. He also led the United States into World War I in 1917, establishing an activist foreign policy known as Wilsonianism. He was the leading architect of the League of Nations.\n\nR1b-L21 branch (Atlantic Celtic)\n\nThe O'Neill dynasty is a Gaelic Irish lineage that dominated the northern half of Ireland from the 6th to the 10th century. They claim descent from the 4th-century Irish king Niall of the Nine Hostages. According to the O'Neill DNA Project, the latter's probable lineage was R1b-L21 > DF13 > DF49 > Z2980 > Z2976 > DF23 > Z2961 > S645 > Z2965 > M222 > Y2605 > Y2841 > DF104 > DF109 (aka DF105), which split into 29 branches. Among these, it is believed that the S588 clade corresponds to the Cenél nEógain, the DF85 clade to the Cenél Conaill, and the A18726 clade to the Uí Briúin (royal dynasty of Connacht). The O'Neills have held the titles of Earl of Tyrone, Viscount O'Neill, Baron O'Neill, among others. Notable O'Neills include the American playwright and Nobel laureate Eugene O'Neill (1888-1953), the American businessman and founder of the O'Neill brand Jack O'Neill (1923-2017), the 4th Prime Minister of Northern Ireland Terence O'Neill (1914-1990), and the British economist Jim O'Neill, Baron O'Neill of Gatley (b. 1957).\n\nThe Dalcassians are a Gaelic Irish tribe who became powerful during the 10th and 11th centuries, when Brian Boru (941-1014) became High King of Ireland. He was the founder of the O'Brien dynasty, who were at various times in history Kings of Munster, Kings of Thomond (1118-1543), Earls of Thomond (1543-1726), Marquesses of Thomond (1726-1855), and Barons Inchiquin -1543-present), among others. According to the O'Brien DNA Project, most O'Brien members fall within the Dál gCais group belonging to R1b-L21 > DF13 > Z253 > Z2534 > L226, with a most recent common ancestor living about 1500 years ago.\n\nAccording to descendant research conducted by Brad Michael Little, the Reginarids' lineage was identified as R1b-L21 > DF13 > FGC5494 > FGC5561 > A913 > A7607. The Reginarid dynasty includes the first Counts of Hainaut, all the Counts of Louvain & Brussels and the original Dukes of Brabant & Lothier, as well as the entire House of Hesse (Landgraves and Grand-Dukes) and by extension the Battenberg family (Lords Mountbatten).\n\nClan MacLean is one of the oldest clans in the Highlands, with origins going back at least to 852. The clan owned large tracts of land in Argyll as well as the Inner Hebrides. According to the MacLean DNA Project, the chiefly lines of Duart and Lochbuie belong to R1b-L21 > DF13 > DF1 > S5668 > FGC13499 > S5979 > S5982 > Z17816 > A1069 > Z17815, with a most recent common ancestor living about 1000 years ago.\n\nClan Gregor (or McGregor) is a Highland Scottish clan that claims an origin in the early 800s. The clan's most famous member is the folk hero Rob Roy MacGregor (1671-1734). The Clan is also known to have been among the first families of Scotland to begin playing the bagpipes in the early 17th century. The Clan Gregor DNA Project identified the main MacGregor line from Argyllshire as belonging to R1b-L21 > DF13 > Z39589 > L1335 > L1065 > Z16325 > S744 > S691 > S695 > BY144 > S690. The surname MacGregor was proscribed by Royal decree in Scotland from about 1650 to 1750 and many clan members changed their name to Murray. The clan chief has held the title of baronet Murray, then baronet MacGregor of MacGregor, since 1795. Scottish actor Ewan McGregor (b. 1971) could also belong to that haplogroup, although it hasn't been confirmed yet.\n\nAccording to the Buchanan DNA Project, most members of the Highlands Scottish Clan Buchanan belong to haplogroup R1b-L21 > DF13 > L1335 > L1065 > S744 > S691 > S695. The clan is said to descend from Anselan O Kyan, a son of one of the kings of Ulster, who landed on the northern coast of Argyll, near Lennox, about the year 1016 and helped Malcolm II of Scotland in repelling the Danes. Some of the most notable clan members include the 15th President of the United States, James Buchanan (1791-1868), and American political commentator Pat Buchanan (b. 1938), who descends from the medieval clan chiefs.\n\nClan Chattan is a confederaton of Highland Scottish clans. It was formed by descendants of the original clan, namely Clan Macpherson, Clan MacBean (or McBain) and Clan MacPhail, with the Clan Mackintosh and their cadet branches (Clan Shaw, Clan Farquharson, the Ritchies, and Clan MacThomas), and other clans unrelated by blood such as the MacGillivrays and the Davidson. According to the Clan Chattan DNA Project, most of the people with the original clan surnames fit within the R1b-L21 > DF13 > L1335 > S733 > Z16325 > S744 > Y16858 clade.\n\nResults from the Clan Cameron DNA Project indicate that the vast majority of participants of Highland Clan Cameron belong to R1b-L21 > DF13 > Y16233 > A2070 > Y16765 > A7298 > A6138. This includes several cadet branches. However the clan chiefs, Cameron of Lochiel, haven't been tested yet. The origins of the clan are unclear, but one hypothesis is that Donal Dubh, the first chief of Clan Cameron was descended either from the Macgillonies. Genetic genealogy confirms this link as members of Clan MacGillonie carry the same haplotype as the Cameron. British Prime Minister David Cameron and Canadian film director James Cameron probably belong to the same lineage, but it hasn't been confirmed yet.\n\nClan Campbell is historically one of the largest and most powerful of the Scottish Highland clans. The clan chief have held the title first of Lord Campbell (from 1445), then Earl of Argyll (1457), Marquess of Argyll (1641) and lastly Duke of Argyll from 1701 to this day. Another branch became the Earls of Loudoun (1633-1786). The Clan Campbell DNA Project identified the main Campbell line from Argyllshire as belonging to R1b-L21 > DF13 > Z39589 > L1335 > L1065 > FGC10125 > FGC10117, with a common patrilineal ancestor who lived about 1000 years ago.\n\nClan Drummond is a Highland Scottish clan whose clan chief were granted the title of Lord Drummond of Cargill (1488), then of Earl of Perth (1605 to this day). From 1716 to 1800, a Jacobite branch also held the title of Duke of Perth. The Drummond DNA Project determined that the Drummond Peerage belonged to R1b-L21 > DF13 > L513 > S5668 > A7 > Z17623 > S5982 > FGC30224 > ZS4584 > BY4017.\n\nAccording to the Stewart Stuart DNA Project, the House of Stuart, who ruled Scotland from 1371, then also England and Ireland from 1603 until 1707, belongs to R1b-L21 > DF13 > Z39589 > DF41/S524 > Z43690 > S775 > L746 > S781. The most prominent members were King Robert II of Scotland, Kings James I, Charles I, Charles II and James II of England & Ireland. The Confederate States Army general J. E. B. Stuart (1833-1864) descends from the Baronet of Castle Stuart and therefore belonged to the same lineage. Formula One champion Jackie Stuart (b. 1939) desends from an illegitimate branch of King Robert III of Scotland, the Stewarts of Blackhall & Ardgowan.\n\nJames Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth was the eldest illegitimate son of Charles II of England, Scotland, and Ireland with mistress Lucy Walter. He married Anne Scott, 1st Duchess of Buccleuch and daughter of the 2nd Earl of Buccleuch. The firstborn son descending from this couple have been carrying the title of Duke of Buccleuch and Earl of Dalkeith (among others), and been the Chief of Clan Scott ever since. In 2012, the 10th Duke of Buccleuch showed that he shared the same Y chromosome as a distant Stuart cousin, thus confirming that Charles II was indeed Monmouth's father (see House of Stuart above). Other ducal lineages descended from illegitimate sons of King Charles II include the Dukes of Cleveland (extinct in 1891), the Dukes of Grafton, the Dukes of St Albans, and the Dukes of Richmond (combined with the Dukedoms of Lennox and Gordon). The Dukes of Berwick, who have been part of the Spanish nobility since 1707, descend from James FitzJames, the illegitimate son of King James II, and therefore also carry the Stewart Y-chromosomal line. The current Duke of Berwick also hold 3 other dukedoms (including Duke of Alba) and 35 other titles, making him the most titled aristocrat in the world.\n\nClan Mackenzie is a Highland Scottish clan descending from Kenneth Mackenzie, 1st of Kintail (d. 1304). The Mackenzie have possessed the titles of Earl of Seaforth from 1623 to 1781, and of Earl of Cromartie (1703-1746 and 1861 to present). The clan's main branch, including confirmed descendants of Alexander Mackenzie of Kintail back in the 15th century, belong to R1b-L21 > DF13 > DF1 > S5668 > A7 > S7834 (aka S7828), with a common patrilineal ancestor who lived about 1200 years ago, based on the results from the Mackenzie DNA Project.\n\nThe lineage of the clan chiefs of Highland Scottish Clan MacLaren belong to to R1b-L21 > DF13 > Z39589 > L1335 > L1065 > S744 > S764 > Y16252 > BY23333 according to the Clan MacLaren DNA Project.\n\nAmerican statesman and lawyer and Founding Father Roger Sherman (1721-1793) probably belonged to R1b-L21 > DF13 > FGC5494 based on the results from the Sherman DNA Project. He is the only person to have signed all four great state papers of the United States: the Continental Association, the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and the Constitution. Union general William Tecumseh Sherman (1820-1891), who played a key role during the American Civil War, shared a common ancestor with Roger Sherman in the person of Henry Sherman (1511-1590) from Dedham, Essex. So both men would share the same paternal haplogroup. The M4 Sherman, the most widely used medium tank by the Allies in World War II, was named after General Sherman.\n\nAmerican Founding Father Patrick Henry (1736-1799) belonged to R1b-L21 > DF13 > DF1 > S6365 > BY16 > Z16372 according to relative testing at the Henry DNA Project (lineage R1b-06). Henry is best known for his declaration to the Second Virginia Convention (1775): \"Give me liberty, or give me death!\" He served as the first and sixth post-colonial Governor of Virginia.\n\nHenry Clay (1777-1852) was an American attorney and statesman who represented Kentucky in both the Senate and House and served as 9th Secretary of State. He was part of the so-called Great Triumvirate, along with Daniel Webster and John C. Calhoun, who dominated American politics for much of the first half of the 19th century. Clay ran for U.S. president in 1824, 1832, and 1844 and received the electoral votes each time, but nevertheless lost the elections. Many descendants of his great-great-grand-father Charles Clay (d. 1686) from Virginia tested at the Clay DNA Project (lineage 01), which fits into haplogroup R1b-L21 > DF13 > FGC11134 > CTS4466 > A541 > A195 > BY55890.\n\nThe 12th president of the United States, Zachary Taylor (1784-1850) belonged to haplogroup R1b-L21 > DF13 > Z39589 > L1335 > L1065 > S764 > BY3148 > FGC18451 based on the results from the Taylor DNA Project (Group 06), and is ultimately descended from Sir John Taylor (1327-1377), a Knight to King Edward III. Taylor previously was a career officer in the United States Army, rose to the rank of major general and became a national hero as a result of his victories in the MexicanAmerican War. His son, Richard Taylor (1826-1879) was a Lieutenant General in the CSA and became army commander in the Trans-Mississippi Theater.\n\nWilliam Ewart Gladstone (1809-1898), a British Liberal politician who served a record four times as Prime Minister under Queen Victoria, belonged to R1b-L21 based on a comparison of his genealogy with the results from Gladstone DNA Project. His deep clade would be R1b-L21 > DF13 > FGC5494 > FGC5561 > Z16503 > Z16504 > Z16502 > Z17653 > L1444 > BY23824\n\nThe analysis of his descendants's Y-chromosomal DNA confirmed that Joseph Smith (1805-1844), the founder of Mormonism and the Latter Day Saint movement, belonged to haplogroup R1b-M222 (R1b-L21 > DF13 > DF49 > Z2980 > Z2976 > DF23 > Z2961 > S645 > Z2965 > M222).\n\nRutherford B. Hayes (1822-1893), the 19th president of the United States, most probably belonged to haplogroup R1b-L21 > DF13 > L513 > S5668 > Z16357 > Z16854 > ZS349 based on the results from the Hayes DNA Project (Group H, descendant of George Hayes, 1655-1725). Hayes was a lawyer and staunch abolitionist. At the start of the Civil War, he joined the Union Army as an officer. He was wounded five times, earned a reputation for bravery in combat and was promoted to the rank of brevet major general.\n\nGeorge B. McClellan (1826-1885) was an American soldier, civil engineer, railroad executive, and politician who served as the 24th Governor of New Jersey. As major general during the American Civil War he played an important role in raising a well-trained and organized army. He was Commanding General of the Union Army for 5 months. His paternal lineage was identified through the McClellan Y-DNA Project as a descendant of Brig. General Samuel McClellan, making him a member of haplogroup R1b-L21 > DF13 > Z39589 > DF49 > DF23 > Z2961 > M222.\n\nThe American financier and banker J.-P .Morgan (1837-1913) descended from Sargent Miles Morgan who migrated from Wales to Massachusetts. This places him in Group 23 in the Morgan Surname Y-DNA Project corresponding to haplogroup R1b-L21 > DF13 > Z39589 > FGC43861 > BY2868 > BY132302.\n\nWilliam McKinley (1843-1901), the 25th president of the United States, probably belonged to haplogroup R1b-L21 > DF13 > L1335 > S764 based on the results from the MacKinlay DNA Project (descendant of James McKinley b. 1670 in Callender, Perthshire). During his presidency, McKinley led the nation to victory in the SpanishAmerican War, raised protective tariffs to promote American industry, and kept the nation on the gold standard in a rejection of the expansionary monetary policy of free silver.\n\nWarren G. Harding (1865-1923), the 29th president of the United States, belonged to R1b-L21 > DF13 > Z39589 > DF49 > DF23 > ZP75 based on the results from the Harden/Harding DNA Project. He descended from Richard Harding (1583-1657) from Denbury, Devon, England and his son Stephen (1623-1698) who migrated to Braintree, Massachussets and died in Rhode Island.\n\nThe forensic analysis of the skeletal remains of Che Guevara (1928-1967), the Argentine Marxist revolutionary and major figure of the Cuban Revolution, revealed that he belonged to haplogroup R1b-L21.\n\nOne of the greatest boxers of all time, Muhammad Ali (1942-2016), born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr, belonged to haplogroup R1b-L21 (deep clade DF13 > Z253 > Z2185 > Z2186 > L1066 > Z40246 > FGC53689). His Y-DNA haplogroup was determined by Big Y testing of his brother, Rahaman Ali.\n\nActor Matt LeBlanc (b. 1967), well known for playing the character of Joey Tribbiani in the TV series Friends and its sequel Joey, has a genealogy that can be traced back to Daniel Leblanc (1626-1695) who migrated from France to Port-Royal in Acadia (modern Nova Scotia). The same individual is listed in the Normandy Y-DNA Project as a member of R1b-L21 > DF63 > BY592. Geni.com mentions his haplogroup as R1b-M269.\n\nR1b-U152 branch (Italo-Celtic)\n\nBased on the data from the Habsburg Family Project, there is a high likelihood that the haplogroup of the House of Habsburg was R1b-U152 > L2 > Z41150 > DF90 > FGC59564. The Habsburg originated in the eponymous village in northern Switzerland. They first became Kings of the Romans in 1273, obtained thenf Dukes of Austria from 1278, Kings of Spain from 1516, Kings of Hungary and Croatia from 1526... The Habsburgs provided all the Holy Roman Emperors but one from 1440 until the dissolution of the empire in 1806. However the senior Y-DNA line of the Habsburgs ended with Emperor Charles VI (1685-1740), father of Empress Maria Theresa. Check also Haplogroups of European kings and queens for mtDNA lines of many Habsburg family members.\n\nWhile testing for paternal relatives of Richard III of England to confirm the identity of his presumed remains (see Haplogroup G2a), researchers found that three modern relatives with the surname Somerset and descended from House of Lancaster all belonged to haplogroup R1b-U152 (x L2, Z36, Z56, M160, M126 and Z192). Although this points to a non-paternity at some time in the Plantagenet lineage, it is likely that most if not all Dukes of Beaufort, and possibly most Plantagenets monarchs outside the House of York belonged to R1b-U152.\n\nClan Erskine, a Lowland Scottish clan from Renfrewshire, apparently belongs to R1b-U152 > Z36 > BY1328 > BY2151 > A7992 > A8001 > BY32396 based on at least one descendant from John Erskine, 19th Earl of Mar (15581634) at the Erskine/Askey Surname Project. The Erskines have held the title of Earl of Mar since 1404, of Earl of Kellie since 1619, and of Earl of Buchan since 1640.\n\nFamilyTreeDNA collaborated with the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory The first President of the United States to identify the paternal line of the First President of the United States, George Washington (1732-1799). The study determined that George Washington belonged to R1b-U152 > Z36 > Y17161 > BY1328 > BY2151 > A7992.\n\nAbraham Lincoln (1809-1865), the 16th president of the United States, appears to have belonged to R1b-U152 > L2 > Z142 > Z150 > S20376 > S20376. The Lincoln DNA Project tested several descendants from Samuel \"the weaver\" Lincoln, who was Abraham Lincoln's great-great-great-great-grandfather, and they all share the same haplotype.\n\nGrover Cleveland (1837-1908), the 22nd and 24th president of the United States, could have belonged to R1b-L20, a subclade of L2, based on the numerous results from the Cleveland DNA Project.\n\nThe American singer, songwriter and dancer Michael Jackson (1958-2009), who was known as the \"King of Pop\", and he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century, belonged to haplogroup R1b-U152 > L2 > Z258 > Z367 > L20 > BY203086 > FT121435 > FT121274. His Y-DNA was determined by Big Y testing of a relative descending from Michael's paternal great-grandfather Israel Nero Jackson Sr (1838 - 1934) at Family Tree DNA. Not much is known about this deep clade except that it is also found in northern France.\n\nActor Kevin Costner (b. 1955) descends from George Adam Costner (Kastner) from Edenkoben, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, and his father Andreas Kastner. This places him in Group 2 in the Kastner Y-DNA Project, who belong to R1b-U152 > L2 > A19725 > BY39321.\n\nAmerican-Canadian actor Matthew Perry (b. 1969), most famous for playing Chandler Bing in the sitcom Friends, probably belongs to haplogroup R1b-U152 > L2 > Z49 > Z142 > CTS2819 based on results from members of the Perry Y-DNA Project (Family 7). He is a descendant of John Perry (1604-1674) and his father John Perry (1588-1621) from Hampshire, England.\n\nR1b-DF27 branch (Celtic)\n\nClan Bruce is a Lowlands Scottish clan, which was a Royal House in the 14th century, producing two kings of Scotland (Robert the Bruce and David II of Scotland), and a disputed High King of Ireland, Edward Bruce. The Bruces were first Lords of Annandale from 1124 until King Robert the Bruce conferred the title to his nephew, Thomas Randolph. Robert the Bruce successfully fought off the English in the First War of Scottish Independence and is now revered in Scotland as a national hero. Other clan members later became Barons of Clackmannan, Lords Bruce of Kinloss (1608), Earls of Elgin (1633) and Earls of Kincardine (1647), titles that they keep to this day. The Bruce DNA Project determined that the noble lineage of Clan Bruce belongs to R1b-DF27 > ZZ12 > Z46512 > FGC78762 > ZZ41 > S7432.\n\nHighland Scottish Clan Murray and Clan Sutherland both descend from a Flemish nobleman by the name of Freskin, who settled in Scotland during the reign of King David I and was granted lands in West Lothian and the ancient Pictish kingdom of Moray (which would become known as Sutherland). Freskin's descendants were designated by the surname de Moravia (\"of Moray\" in the Norman language), which later became 'Murray'. Freskin's great-grand-son was William de Moravia (c. 12101248), became 1st Earl of Sutherland, a title that the clan chief who keep until 1535, when it passed to Clan Gordon. Clan Murray descends from William's cousin. They would acquire the title of Earl of Tullibardine (1606), Earl of Atholl (1629), Marquess of Atholl (1676), and ultimately Duke of Atholl (1703) to this day. The second son of the 1st Marquess of Atholl and his descendants would become Earls of Dunmore. According to the Sutherland DNA Project, the ancestral Sutherland line belongs to R1b-DF27 > ZZ12 > FGC23071 > FGC23066 > BY48361 > BY130907 > BY67446 and has Y-chromosomal matches in modern Flanders, confirming Freskin's origins. It is believed that Clan Douglas also descends from Freskin and the biggest cluster in the Douglas DNA Project indeed matches the Sutherland and Murray haplotype.\n\nAccording to the Boyle DNA Project, the Earls of Glasgow belongs to R1b-DF27 > Z196 > SRY2627 > BY3222. The Earl is the hereditary clan chief of Clan Boyle, whose ancestors came from the Norman town of Beauville near Caen.\n\nJohn Hancock (1737-1793) was an American merchant, statesman, prominent Patriot of the American Revolution and signatory of the Declaration of Independence. He served as president of the Second Continental Congress and was the first and third Governor of Massachusetts. He was a descendant of John Hancock (1506-1570) from Chesterfield, Derbyshire. Another branch descending from that ancestor tested on the Hancock DNA Project (Group 01) and was found to belong to R1b-DF27 > Z195 > Z198 > Z292 > Z262 > Z201 > Z202 > Z205 > Z206 > Z208. Another notable descendant of the same John Hancock of Chesterfield was Union general Winfield Scott Hancock (1824-1886). Known to his Army colleagues as \"Hancock the Superb\", he was noted in particular for his personal leadership at the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863.\n\nThe House of Bernadotte, which has been the royal house of Sweden since in 1818, and also of Norway between 1818 and 1905 belongs to R1b-DF27 > Z195 > Z272 > S450 > Z295 > S25783 > CTS4065 > S16864 > A5000 > FGC39239 according to the testing of a cousin of King Gustaf V. The dynasty was founded by Jean Bernadotte, a former marshal of Napoleon, who was elected the heir-presumptive to the childless King Charles XIII of Sweden, and became King Charles XIV John. Bernadotte was a native of Pau in Gascony, where this haplogroup is indeed common today.\n\nCommodore Matthew Calbraith Perry (1794-1858), the man who forced Japan to open its ports to Western ships, which eventually caused the downfall of the Tokugawa shogunate and the Meiji restoration, probably belonged to haplogroup R1b-DF27 > Z196 > Z209 > Z295 based on shared genealogy (descendant of Edward Perry 1630-1695 from Devon, England) with members of the Perry Y-DNA Project (Family 11).\n\nBraxton Bragg (1817-1876) was an American army officer during the Second Seminole War and MexicanAmerican War and later a Confederate army officer who served as a general in the Confederate Army during the American Civil War. His most important role was as commander of the Army of Mississippi. His fatherline was identified in the Bragg DNA Project (Family 2, descending from Joseph B. Bragg), making of him a member of R1b-DF27 > Z196 > SRY2627 > Z208.\n\nThe Austrian composer, music theorist and painter Arnold Schönberg (1874-1951) belonged to Y-haplogroup R1b according to his profile on Geni. According to the Schönberg DNA Project his lineage (grandson of Abraham Schoenberg, born in 1812 in Szécsény) falls under the BY16148 clade downstream of DF27.\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush (1924-2018), the 41st president of the United States, and his son George W. Bush (b. 1946), the 43rd president, apparently belong to haplogroup R1b-DF27 > Z196 > Z209 > CTS4065 > S16864 based on the results from the Bush DNA Project (group A). They descend from Reynold Bush (1600-1686) who emigrated from England (Fering Parish, Essex) to the Massachusetts colony about 1640.\n\nCanadian statesman Pierre Trudeau, the third longest-serving Prime Minister in Canadian history, and his son Justin Trudeau, who served as the second-youngest Canadian Prime Minister, probably belong to haplogroup R1b-DF27 > Z196 > SRY2627 > Z208 according to FTDNA's French Heritage Project and their genealogy on Geni.com.\n\nUndetermined R1b branch\n\nYehia Z Gad and his team at the Ancient DNA lab of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo retrieved the DNA of several members of the 18th Dynasty of Egypt (c. 15501295 BCE), which included Amenhotep I to III, Thutmose I to IV, Hatshepsut, Akhenaten and Tutankhamun. The Y-DNA analysis established that The royal male lineage belonged to Y-haplogroup R1b.\n\nProfessor Tomasz Kozłowski tested the Y-DNA of Prince Janusz III of Masovia, Duke of Czersk, Warsaw, Liw, Zakroczym and Nur. He was a direct descendent of the Piast Dynasty, the first historical dynasty ruling over Poland, starting with Prince Mieszko I (c. 930992) and ending in 1370 with the death of King Casimir III the Great. The Piast family continued to rule over the Duchy of until 1526 and the Duchy of Silesia until 1675. Prof. Kozłowski announced that the prince belonged to haplogroup R1b, and therefore probably also other members of that royal lineage, including all the Dukes of Masovia (1138-1526), as long as no non-paternity event took place.\n\nBogdanowicza et al. (2009) tested the Y-chromosomal DNA and mitochondrial DNA of the exhumed remains of the Renaissance astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus. They established that he belonged to Y-haplogroup R1b-P310 and mt-haplogroup H.\n\nRogaev et al. (2009) tested the DNA of the presumed grave of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and all his five children, and compared them against archival blood specimens from Nicholas II as well as against samples from descendants of both paternal and maternal lineages. The results unequivocally confirmed that the grave was the one of the last Russian Royal family. Nicholas II belonged to Y-haplogroup R1b and mt-haplogroup T2. Consequently, all Russian emperors of the Romanov dynasty since Peter III (1728-1762) also belonged to haplogroup R1b. This paternal lineage ultimately descends from the House of Oldenburg, which includes all the Kings of Denmark since Christian I (reigned from 1448) as well as several Kings of Norway, Sweden and Greece, and the current heirs to the British throne (Prince Charles and his son Prince William).\n\nThe great English naturalist Charles Darwin (1809-1882), who proposed the scientific theory of evolution and the process of natural selection, was a member of haplogroup R1b according to the test results from his great-great-grandson.\n\nKevin Bacon (b. 1958), an American actor and musician whose films include musical-drama film Footloose (1984), the controversial historical conspiracy legal thriller JFK (1991), the legal drama A Few Good Men (1992), the historical docudrama Apollo 13 (1995), and the mystery drama Mystic River (2003). Bacon has won a Golden Globe Award and three Screen Actors Guild Awards, and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award. The Guardian named him one of the best actors never to have received an Academy Award nomination.\n\nThe American actor Robert John Downey Jr. (b. 1965) ad his Y-haplogroup was revealed by the PBS television series Finding Your Roots. His father adopted the surname Downey, but before that his paternal ancestors were called Elias, or Eliasovitz before they emigrated to the United States. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor and won him the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role in the movie Chaplin (1992), and won a Golden Globe Award for his role in the TV series Ally McBeal. He is also known for portraying the role of Marvel Comics superhero Iron Man.\n\nFamous T1a individuals\n\nThe testing of Thomas Jefferson's DNA revealed that the third US president belonged to haplogroup T. Descendants of his father, Colonel Peter Jefferson, tested on the Jefferson DNA Project and belonged to haplogroup T1a1a-L208 > CTS11451 > Y6671.\n\nHaplogroups of the main Scottish clans\n\nHaplogroups of the Founding Fathers of the United States\n\nHaplogroups of prominent leaders of the American Civil War\n\nFollow-up\n\nAsk your questions and discuss about haplogroups on the Forum"
