The Facebook group ‘You know you’re from Aberdeen, SD if…’ features a collection of Aberdeen facts and stories, ranging from the town’s creation to today.\n\n“I had seen a few other cities doing the same type of group and noticed that Aberdeen did not have one, and I thought it would be fun,” said group creator Doug Schnell.\n\nThe group was created in August of 2011 and currently has over 13,000 members. Both past and present Aberdeen residents share their memories of the town, with a few mentions of current events sprinkled in. Anyone who has an interest in Aberdeen is welcome to join."
