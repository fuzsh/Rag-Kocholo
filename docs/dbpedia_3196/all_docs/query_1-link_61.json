        "text": "James Donald Szura, born January 9, 1950, in Chicago, Illinois, tragically passed away in a car accident on June 1, 2017. His parents were Theodore John Szura and Frances (McGuire) Szura.\n\nJames grew up in the suburbs of Chicago with his brother, often riding the “L” Train to the outer areas of the Chicago suburbs, exploring other neighborhoods. He was always mechanically inclined, even as a child. He loved playing with his erector sets, even trading with other kids to get their sets when they no longer wanted them. This love for constructing things lead him on the path to become a journeyman machinist.\n\nAs an adult, he served the U.S. Navy as a Seabee in an underwater construction battalion. This allowed him to indulge in another well-loved activity in his life, scuba and hardhat diving. Later in life, he enjoyed astronomy and often studied the stars, moon, planets and asteroids.\n\nHe and his family moved to Mountain Grove in the late 80’s. He ran a machining business that helped many of the local farmers, businesses, and even a few major corporations. He enjoyed his grandchildren and research.\n\nJames was preceded in death by his parents, Theodore and Frances Szura.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Fannie, his two sons, Adam LeRoy Szura and his wife, Joellyn, of Springfield, Missouri, and James Joseph Szura and his wife, Margie, of Kansas City, Missouri, eight grandchildren, Madison and Claire Szura, Mathew and Brandon Moore, Johnathan, Christopher, Nicholas, and Alexander Szura, two great-grandchildren, Andrew and Tucker Moore, his older brother Theodore Joseph Szura and his wife, Linda, of Billings, Missouri, and many other relatives and friends. All who loved him will sorely miss him. Rest in peace Jim."
