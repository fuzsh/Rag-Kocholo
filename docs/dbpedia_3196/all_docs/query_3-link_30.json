        "text": "This narrative is the story of the Aberdeen city region. Our story includes the amazing impact we’ve had on the world through the ages, and the things that make our city region a great place to live, work, study, visit, invest and do business in today. With exciting plans for the future, we have a new story and this resource is designed to help you to tell it.\n\nThis part of the site provides you with all the information you need to celebrate the places, programmes, successes and investments that will underpin the city region’s continued global impact and reinvention. It also highlights a great quality of life, education and research strengths, leisure and tourism assets and new dynamic business sectors. All backed up by a series of facts; some serious and some a little lighter touch but all things that can start conversations about this region.\n\nAberdeen? Abzolutely.\n\nThe chapters below can act as a framework for anyone to use as they talk about the city region, so feel free to use the content in its entirety or copy and paste the sections most relevant to you.\n\nA GLOBAL CITY\n\nAberdeen is a global brand. From its position high on the east coast of Scotland, Aberdeen has exerted its influence right around the planet. Our long and proud tradition of invention and discovery – from subsea technology and the discovery of insulin, to treatments for Cystic Fibrosis and even the first MRI scanner – demonstrates a fundamental element of our region’s DNA, to blaze new trails and shape the future for all of humankind. We’re open to the world.\n\nWe may be known as Europe’s oil and gas capital, but we are so much more. Our impact is felt all around the globe. We are at the forefront of a global energy transition to a lower carbon world. We are recognised as an important centre for life sciences. Our health research is world-leading. And we are home to food and drink brands that are enjoyed right across the planet.\n\nOur internationalism goes both ways. After centuries of global trade we have an incredibly diverse population and in any restaurant, café or the airport arrivals hall, you’ll hear voices from a myriad of nations.\n\nAberdeen has always been enterprising. Established way back in 1136, Aberdeen Harbour Board is Britain’s oldest registered company. Spin on a few hundred years to 1498 – just six years after Columbus discovered America - and one of the world’s oldest transport companies, The Shore Porters Society of Aberdeen, was set up. A son of Aberdeenshire, Thomas Blake Glover, even founded the Mitsubishi Corporation and was known as the Scottish Samurai.\n\nThe fact is that, from our waterfront, we have always reached out beyond our shores. And now with a £350 million investment in our new harbour, we are reaffirming its place at the very heart of our economy.\n\nOurs is not just an illustrious history of global influence and, more recently, leadership in the oil and gas sector. Aberdeen has moved seamlessly into scientific, engineering, digital and low carbon specialisms. The city has one of the largest concentrations of life scientists in Europe and the largest biologics cluster in the UK after Cambridge.\n\nPerhaps there’s something in Aberdeen’s culture that has always made it a magnet for global innovators; the city boasts no fewer than five Nobel Prize winners. It was back in 1922 that one of these winners, biochemist John MacLeod, helped to discover insulin. And Aberdeenshire-born physician Patrick Manson made the momentous discovery that malaria is spread by mosquitoes, credited as one of the most important medical breakthroughs of its time.\n\nThat drive and dynamism continues apace, and today we have Europe’s largest single-site health campus where ground breaking research into cures for contemporary diseases is being carried out.\n\nOur city region is also globally important in the food and drink sector, home to the iconic rule breakers, BrewDog, and arguably the greatest whiskies in the world. Our menu of household brands also includes Mackies and Walkers Shortbread.\n\nAnd as well as being the home of Aberdeen Angus, Europe’s biggest seafood catches are landed at Peterhead and Fraserburgh. Food and drink companies in the city region export to more than 100 countries around the globe.\n\nAberdeen faces forward. It’s a place that gets on with it. Ours is a small European city region with a big personality, punching well above its weight. We don’t wait to see what others are doing and how they’re doing it; we drive on with the business of innovation and don’t stop when we hit the coast. We go further, faster.\n\nHello, world. This is Aberdeen.\n\nSupporting facts:\n\nAberdeen has one of the largest concentrations of life scientists in Europe.\n\nAberdeenshire is a global centre for subsea technologies and expertise. In fact, 75% of the world’s subsea engineering capability is based here.\n\nAberdeen is the centre of a UK industry that has, over 50 years, invested almost £500 billion in extracting oil and gas from the North Sea. Our skills and expertise play a vital part in recovering the 20 billion barrels remaining in the UK Continental Shelf.\n\nBreakthrough research in Alzheimer’s, Cystic Fibrosis and Irritable Bowel Syndrome is taking place here in Aberdeen.\n\nWith regular connections to over 40 international and domestic airports, Aberdeen International Airport looks after around three million passengers each year, travelling right across the world.\n\nAberdeen has the busiest civilian heliport in the world.\n\nThe first Scottish company to be listed on the London Stock Exchange was the City of Aberdeen Land Association, now known as CALA Homes.\n\nRobert Thomson, from Stonehaven, was the acknowledged inventor of the fountain pen and original inventor of the pneumatic tyre.\n\nThe first ever game of water polo took place along the banks of the River Dee in Aberdeen in the 19th century.\n\nThe first written evidence of a game where the ball is passed from player to player to score goals appears in a book from Aberdeen dated 1633.\n\nRobert Gordon University boasts students from 132 countries and has 90,000 global alumni.\n\nGeorge Paget Thomson was professor of natural philosophy in Aberdeen when he discovered the wave-like properties of the electron, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1937.\n\nThe role of mosquitos in spreading malaria was discovered by Aberdeenshire physician Sir Patrick Manson, known as the ‘Father of tropical medicine’.\n\nBritain’s oldest registered company, Aberdeen Harbour Board, was founded in 1136.\n\nThe Press & Journal is one of the oldest existing English-language newspapers in the world and remains the best-read regional daily in the UK.\n\nAberdonian inventor and energy pioneer Robert Davidson built the world’s first known electric locomotive here in 1837.\n\nSir Thomas Sutherland, the founder of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, now known as HSBC, was born in Aberdeen and studied at the University of Aberdeen.\n\nWith a reported 33 places, towns and cities named Aberdeen around the world, and even an Aberdeen Harbour in Hong Kong, we’ve left our mark on the map.\n\nAberdeen has UNESCO-recognised archives – the oldest and most complete collection of records of any Scottish town.\n\nThe terraces of the Houses of Parliament and the original Waterloo Bridge in London were constructed with Aberdeen granite.\n\nPeterhead Port lands more fish than every other UK port combined and is the largest port for landing white fish in Europe. Meanwhile, Fraserburgh lands the highest amount of shellfish in the UK.\n\nThe self-seal envelope was invented by a local entrepreneur.\n\nA GREAT PLACE\n\nWhether you come from near or far, Aberdeen city region is a great place to be. Across the area there is a wealth of culture, amazing heritage, great food and drink and one of the most spectacular landscapes in the world. All this, alongside the buzz of an area that’s really going places. A renaissance city, in a breathtaking region; welcome to Aberdeen.\n\nIf you visit, live, learn or work here, you’ll know why Aberdeen was recently named the best Scottish city to live and work in the Demos-PwC Good Growth for Cities Index. Our quality of life is built around good value homes and top schools, but also a love of the great outdoors, wide open spaces, a passion for culture and a true sense of community.\n\nThere’s always something happening. A packed events programme covers everything from contemporary art and music, to light installations and dance. Sports and outdoor pursuits are also a key feature of our downtime. There are a range of top-class events such as cycling's Tour of Britain and Premier League football at the home of Aberdeen Football Club; the only Scottish team to have won two UEFA European trophies.\n\nWork is well underway to push the bar even higher. There’s a 25-year masterplan that will see new investment create an inclusive, exciting and vibrant city centre. As part of this, more than £43 million has been invested in Aberdeen Art Gallery and Music Hall, part of our distinctive cultural offer and powerful platforms for both global talent and local artists.\n\nA new events complex for Aberdeen, P&J Live, opened its doors in 2019. With a 15,000 capacity arena and over 48,000 square metres of multi-purpose events space, it provides the perfect canvas to attract business and leisure tourists to the area. The price tag of a third of a billion pounds, made by Aberdeen City Council, makes it the largest ever single investment in a new build facility of its kind in the UK.\n\nKey green spaces and buildings, such as Union Terrace Gardens, Marischal Square and Provost Skene’s house are being reinvented, and there are exciting plans to increase city living through new, high quality and contemporary residential developments.\n\nNot far from the city, is the Cairngorms National Park and a stunning coastline – part of which was named one of the most iconic landscapes in the world by National Geographic.\n\nAberdeenshire’s incredible heritage includes more castles per acre than anywhere else in the British Isles, with the royal residence of Balmoral on our doorstep.\n\nOur countryside offers a theatre for activities with some of the world’s best golf courses, beaches, stunning walks and opportunities for skiing, climbing, watersports and cycling.\n\nWith a climate that is warmer than the Scottish average, we have some of the longest summer days, and only half the rainfall of Miami - there’s plenty of opportunity to get outdoors and explore.\n\nIt’s little wonder then that tourism is a critical part of Aberdeen’s present and future. Our regional tourism strategy has the bold but achievable ambition of growing visitor spend in Aberdeenshire to £1 billion per year by 2023.\n\nAnd for those who choose to live here, this great quality of life is a critical factor. It’s why we’re a magnet for talent and for hard workers, and not simply because our economy has so many high-quality jobs on offer. The region as a whole has one of the lowest unemployment rates in Scotland.\n\nEducation is another strength and Aberdeen has a rich tradition of educational achievement, from as early as the 15th century, which continues to this day.\n\nThe University of Aberdeen, established in 1495, is one of the oldest English-speaking universities and in the top 160 in the world. It was named Scottish University of the year in 2019 in the Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide.\n\nMeanwhile Robert Gordon University, established in 1729, is top in Scotland for employability; and Gray’s is the top School of Art in the country.\n\nThese great universities support research and innovation, providing talent to support local business in energy, life sciences, architecture, engineering, medicine, health and the creative industries, all of which flourish in Aberdeen. They have produced entrepreneurs, world business leaders, Nobel prize winners and award winning scientists, writers and industrialists.\n\nIn a recent Grant Thornton index Aberdeen ranks highest out of 32 Scottish local authority areas for prosperity and in the top quartile for equality, inclusion, opportunity and sustainability.\n\nAberdeenshire meanwhile was recognised in the Scottish Social Service Awards for demonstrating the very best practice in joined up health and social care provision.\n\nIf you’re lucky enough to call Aberdeen home, you won’t need convincing. Clean air and big skies. Great days and gorgeous nights. Doors opening and new friends to make. Nature, city and sea, all coming together as one.

Having been a global leader in the oil and gas sector for over half a century, it is now building on that incredible base of skills and research strengths to see other areas of industry flourish and grow. From renewables and low carbon to life sciences, hospitality, food and drink or digital, the Aberdeen city region has a plan for future prosperity.\n\nThe future economy of the area will not be one that rises or falls on the price of a barrel; other sectors of our economy are flourishing.\n\nNo longer just an oil and gas capital, we are becoming a world class all-energy hub utilising the expertise, transferable skills and supply chain in the region; leading us towards a low carbon economy and at the forefront of hydrogen technology in Europe.\n\nAn emerging symbol of this great transition is the world’s first floating windfarm by Equinor, off the north-east coast. And in Aberdeen Bay, Vattenfall’s offshore wind test and research centre will help establish which way the wind is blowing for this exciting energy source.\n\nThese renewable innovations sit alongside NorthConnect, a £1.5 billion project providing an electricity link between Scotland and Norway to increase the use of renewable power. In addition, the UK and Scottish Governments have committed funding to develop a world-leading carbon capture and storage project based at Peterhead.\n\nFor oil and gas the story’s far from over. There are up to 20 billion barrels still to be recovered from the North Sea with a potential £920 billion prize for the UK economy, and with much of the activity focused on Aberdeen.\n\nThere’s also the new Oil and Gas Technology Centre.

Its economic strategy will see it build on its wider strengths and put renewed efforts into buoyant sectors such as health, tourism and food and drink.\n\nOur dynamic enterprise base makes us one of the UK’s biggest exporting regions and we’re a business-friendly city. Around a quarter of Scotland's top 100 businesses are already headquartered in the area and it was recently rated as the best place in Britain to start a new business, boasting the best five-year survival rate for new companies.\n\nA thirst for knowledge and a passion for science and engineering has underpinned our city region’s industry for decades; and we know that Aberdeen’s two highly successful universities are key to its continued prosperity.\n\nWe file more patents per capita than anywhere else in Scotland and are in the UK top five. Ours is a highly talented workforce, with over 50% educated to degree level or over - the fourth highest in the UK.\n\nThe renaissance of our towns and city centre will continue to secure business success, giving creative, young and talented graduates an even stronger reason to stay.\n\nAnd, supported by millions of pounds of investment in thousands of new hotel rooms, it has never been more affordable to visit us.\n\nAberdeen means business and has a vibrant economic future ahead.
