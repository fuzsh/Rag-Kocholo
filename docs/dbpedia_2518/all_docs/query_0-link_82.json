        "text": "The Recording Academy announced its 2021 Grammy nominations on Tuesday, with Beyoncé, rising pop star Dua Lipa and stoner superstar Post Malone leading a diffuse field.\n\nBeyoncé features on two songs in the record of the year category, which essentially rewards the year's best single: the remix of Megan Thee Stallion's \"Savage\" and her own \"Black Parade.\" The latter was also nominated for song of the year, which is awarded to the winner's songwriters.\n\nThe Grammys made several changes to its structure this year, including increasing its voting membership by 2,300 and tweaking its nominations process after years of criticism over a lack of diversity amid the ceremony's top categories. The moves were meant to \"to evolve with the musical landscape and to ensure that the … nominating process and rules are more transparent and fair,\" according to a statement on its website.\n\nThe Academy also made its rules and guidelines public for the first time, including definitions for previously murky eligibility requirements and voting guidelines. It also changed the names of several categories — the Latin Pop Album category was renamed to the slightly more-inclusive Best Latin Pop Or Urban Album — and instituted a method for flagging conflicts of interest on its still-secretive Nominations Review Committees, whose members are not made public.\n\nIn addition, the Academy made several personnel changes, most notably the firing its first female CEO, Deborah Dugan, after less than a year on the job. Dugan had accused the Academy of being \"rigged\" and \"corrupt,\" while the Academy had said she was terminated following a confidential investigation into allegations that Dugan had bullied a senior member of the Academy. Former Google executive Valeisha Butterfield Jones was appointed to Chief Diversity & Inclusion Officer, a new position created in response to recommendations made by a task force focused on diversity and inclusion. She will \"design, build and implement world-class programs and industry standards focused on inclusion, belonging and representation for underrepresented communities and creators.\"\n\nThe results of these efforts at the top of the marquee are mixed. The eight nominations in the album of the year category, for example, are gender-diverse but mostly white, save for the rock group Black Pumas and the multi-racial pop singer Jhene Aiko. Record of the year nominees form a richer field, including the fast-rising rapper DaBaby, pop provocateur Doja Cat, and the aforementioned Megan Thee Stallion. All of the nominees for best pop vocal album are white artists.\n\nThe 2021 Grammy Award Nominations\n\nRecord Of The Year\n\nAwarded to the artist and producer(s), recording engineer(s), mixer(s) and mastering engineer(s), if other than the artist.\n\n\"Black Parade\" — Beyoncé\n\n\"Colors\" — Black Pumas\n\n\"Rockstar\" — DaBaby Featuring Roddy Ricch\n\n\"Say So\" — Doja Cat\n\n\"Everything I Wanted\" — Billie Eilish\n\n\"Don't Start Now\" — Dua Lipa\n\n\"Circles\" — Post Malone\n\n\"Savage\" — Megan Thee Stallion Featuring Beyoncé\n\nSong Of The Year\n\nA songwriter(s) award.
