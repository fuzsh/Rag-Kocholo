        "text": "The sound of the sexiest prog rock on the planet.\n\nThe Sa-Ra Creative Partners member returns after a decade with a years-in-the-making set of psychedelic soul.\n\nAn album that doesn’t reinvent classic R&B, but still feels good.\n\nThe Canadian pop-punk band delivers an audacious spectacle on their third LP.\n\nAn album that sounds grand even in its most intimate moments.\n\nThe Brazilian post-punk band serves up a kind of psychedelic witchery.\n\nA more polished, new wave-leaning effort from the Washington, D.C. post-punk outfit.\n\nA meeting of two unexpected collaborators resulting in one of the year’s most abjectly beautiful albums.\n\nThe Richmond metal band continue to defy expectations while delivering a richer emotional experience.\n\nThe shoegaze icons’ latest is a little too overstuffed with ideas.\n\nA slightly brighter take on the Chicago band’s brutalist post-punk.\n\nLike the loudest collection of prose you’ve ever heard.\n\nA surprising transformation into more artful sounds for the UK-based alt-rock group.\n\nA lush and gorgeous electronic album, but one that feels some distance from past glories.\n\nThe producer teams up with vocalist Trixie Whitley for a set of uncharacteristically dark soul.\n\nMembers of Oranssi Pazuzu and Dark Buddha Rising come together for an epic sci-fi nightmare.\n\nThe Japanese footwork producer balances the cray with the stylish on his new EP.\n\nAn intricate record that finds Natalie Mering going into space."
