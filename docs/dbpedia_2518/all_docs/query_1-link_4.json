        "text": "HALESTORM and I PREVAIL are gearing up to embark on summer 2024 co-headlining tour. Produced by Live Nation, the trek kicks off on July 9 in Raleigh and runs through August 17 in Las Vegas. HOLLYWOOD UNDEAD and FIT FOR A KING will serve as support. The tour is also the catalyst and the creative spark for HALESTORM and I PREVAIL's collaborative track \"Can U See Me In The Dark?\"\n\n\"Can U See Me In The Dark?\" is an epic and explosive pairing, just like the tour itself, thanks to the vocal chemistry between I PREVAIL's Eric Vanlerberghe and HALESTORM's Lzzy Hale, stormy riffs, and unforgettable chorus. It will go down as one of the smash hits of summer 2024. Watch the lyric video below.\n\n\"We're excited to finally have a song come out,\" says Vanlerberghe. \"It was a fun challenge to blend the HALESTORM and I PREVAIL sounds together. We really focused on creating a music bed that felt very much I PREVAIL and letting Lzzy just shine and do what she does best. I feel we found a very sick way to blend the two identities of our bands into one massive song. I'm really looking forward to this tour and possibly playing this song live together for everyone.\"\n\n\"In celebration of our upcoming tour together, we joined forces with the boys of I PREVAIL and wrote an original song together,\" says Hale. \"'Can U See Me In The Dark?' is written for our collective fan bases, our community, our family. We want you to know that you are seen and you are not alone shining through life's myriad of joy and pain. We can't wait to feast our eyes on you this summer!\"\n\nHALESTORM has partnered with mental health organization Sound Mind Live to engage fans to pledge support that will provide free-to-the-community mental health programming across the country for fans and the broader community.\n\nRegarding the inspiration for \"Can U See Me In The Dark?\", Lzzy told \"The Mistress Carrie Podcast\": \"We were talking a lot about the analogy of we're all in the same circus together, as in this is all of our shows. It's not just we're saddling up our wagon against a band, 'We're playing. Here's your set. Here's my set.' We really wanted to create this this haven, this sanctuary for our collective fan base, be, like, 'Hey, he's my buddy too. We come from different walks of life, but here's how we come together,' [and] really showcase that togetherness, especially considering, we all have this different flavor and these different influences. And so it's a really beautiful, powerful song that we're gonna be able to just kind of, like, 'Hey, here's something special for the tour.' So we're very much looking forward to being out with each other. And those guys inspire me to no end. Every time I hear their songs the radio, I'm, like, 'How did they do that?' I want a drop like that' â€” you know, that kind of stuff. So I'm looking forward to being inspired every night and hanging out with all those boys.\"\n\nHaving amassed over 2.5 billion streams globally, the Grammy Award-winning band HALESTORM has grown from a childhood dream of siblings Lzzy and Arejay Hale into one of the most celebrated rock bands of the last two decades. Most recently, the band released \"Back From The Dead\", their fifth full-length studio album which has tallied over 100 million streams worldwide. Rolling Stone called the title track \"a biting but cathartic howler about overcoming all obstacles,\" and that song as well as \"The Steeple\" marked their fifth and sixth number ones at rock radio, respectively. Associated Press said the album \"will definitely be in the running for best hard rock/metal album of the year.\" Their previous album, \"Vicious\", earned the band their second Grammy nomination, for \"Best Hard Rock Performance\" for the song \"Uncomfortable\", the band's fourth #1 at rock radio, and led Loudwire to name HALESTORM \"Rock Artist Of The Decade\" in 2019. Fronted by the incomparable Lzzy Hale with drummer Arejay Hale, guitarist Joe Hottinger and bass player Josh Smith, HALESTORM's music has earned multiple platinum and gold certifications from the RIAA, and the band has earned a reputation as a powerful live music force, headlining sold-out shows and topping festival bills around the world, and sharing the stage with icons including HEAVEN & HELL, Alice Cooper, Joan Jett and JUDAS PRIEST. Additionally, Lzzy was named the first female brand ambassador for Gibson and served as host of AXS TV's \"A Year In Music\"."
