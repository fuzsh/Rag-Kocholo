        "text": "On certain corners of the internet, “The Loveliest Time,” the Canadian singer Carly Rae Jepsen’s seventh album, could be confused for the biggest album of the year. But the average Top 40 radio listener probably hasn’t heard it. And when the Billboard 200 chart posted the week after its arrival last month, “The Loveliest Time” was nowhere to be found.\n\nJepsen’s very active online fan base is part of the ecosystem known as stan Twitter. A spin through obsessively curated social media “update accounts” like @PopCrave and @chartdata leads to the impression that we’re living through a golden age of pure pop, akin to the period of the 2010s in which Katy Perry, Lady Gaga and Rihanna reached commercial dominance with songs constructed from monster hooks and pounding synths.\n\nOnline, conversation constantly bubbles about a set of singers — Kim Petras, Ava Max, Sabrina Carpenter, Bebe Rexha, Rina Sawayama, Rita Ora, Troye Sivan and others — who are debated and adored, often becoming trending topics. To their loyal fans, many of whom are women and queer men (who have always worked hard to valorize underappreciated divas), they are, in the parlance of the internet, pop stars.\n\nThey are undoubtedly celebrities, with considerable social media followings. They may have tasted a version of popularity — a Hot 100 hit, a moment of TikTok virality or simply a very faithful (though modest) collection of devotees that allows them to sell out concerts at midsize venues around the world. But they have yet to make the leap to, or have failed to remain at, music’s mainstream center."
