        "text": "From the start of grunge’s road to global domination to the rise of the nu metal juggernaut, the 90s was truly a golden age for metal.\n\nFor some bands, it was a matter of carrying on, impervious to trends. For others, it was a case of seeing which way the winds of change were blowing and trimming their sales accordingly.\n\nLike any living organism, metal evolved in the 90s. Bands such as Pantera and Machine Head took the thrash blueprint and added guts and groove. Others – namely the host of Satanic-themed bands emerging from the snowy wastes and dark forests of Scandinavia – simply turned up the extremity, ushering in the black metal movement.\n\nYet others still began to experiment with the form, whether that was Brazil’s Sepultura experimenting with tribal sounds or Britain’s Paradise Lost layering a gothic approach on top of their original death metal template.\n\nThe 90s was a time when the genre opened up its padlocked gates to new sounds and new visions. Its past was assured. But now it had a future too.\n\nHere, your definitive guide to the craziest decade in metal history, via the 100 albums that mattered the most.\n\nAlice In Chains - Facelift\n\nDeath - Spiritual Healing\n\nDeicide - Deicide\n\nEntombed - Left Hand Path\n\nJane’s Addiction - Ritual de lo Habitual\n\nJudas Priest - Painkiller\n\nMegadeth - Rust In Peace\n\nPantera - Cowboys From Hell\n\nSuicidal Tendencies - Lights Camera Revolution\n\nSlayer - Seasons In The Abyss\n\nCathedral - Forest Of Equilibrium\n\nGuns N’ Roses - Use Your Illusion I & II\n\nMetallica - Metallica\n\nMorbid Angel - Blessed Are The Sick\n\nMr Bungle - Mr Bungle\n\nNirvana - Nevermind\n\nOzzy Osbourne - No More Tears\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers - Blood Sugar Sex Magik\n\nSepultura - Arise\n\nSoundgarden - Badmotorfinger"
