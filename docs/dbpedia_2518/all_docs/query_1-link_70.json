        "text": "Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds have shared a new song, titled ‘Long Dark Night’.\n\nIt’s the third track to be unveiled from the group’s forthcoming album, Wild God, after they shared the title track upon announcing the record in March of this year and followed it with the song ‘Frogs’ in May.\n\n‘Long Dark Night’, which you can listen to below, is inspired by the poem ‘Dark Night Of The Soul’ by the 16th-century Spanish poet St. John of the Cross. In a statement, Nick Cave described it as “one of the greatest and most powerful poems of conversion ever written”.\n\nSpeaking more widely about the song, he added: “Ultimately, though, it’s a beautiful country tune. It feels like a sweet companion to the song ‘Wild God’.”\n\nThe band will follow the release of their new album with a tour of the UK and Europe through September, October and November this year.\n\nBad Seed / PIAS will release Wild God on August 30, 2024."
