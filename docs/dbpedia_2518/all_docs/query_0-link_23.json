        "text": "Many artists would dream to hit 10 million streams on Spotify with a unique song. Drake did it with more than 400 tracks.\n\nHis productivity is insane, and the way he manages to be successful with everything he releases is just as amazing. We review his one of a kind numbers.\n\nThe Big Picture: Drake’s Career\n\nAfter having spent his younger years acting in the Canadian TV series Degrassi, Drake jumped into the typical route, that many rapper do.\n\nHe began independently releasing mixtapes, an EP and then ultimately signing with a major label, which happened in 2009, after the success of his mixtape So Far Gone earlier that year.\n\nThe Canadian artist is well known for being basketball team Toronto Raptors, number one fan. Ironically, Drake followed exactly the same path as the former star of the team, DeMar DeRozan.\n\nA mere four days before signing for the Young Money label, owned by Lil Wayne, DeMar DeRozan was drafted by the Raptors. In the same way that DeRozan became big inside the NBA in 2010, going from 8 to 17 points per game, Drake went from a Gold EP in the US, to his first Platinum album Thank Me Later, in 2010.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2015 DeRozan kept growing slowly until reaching All-Star status. From 2011 to 2015, the success of Drake remained consistent too.\n\nAt the start of the 2016 season, the Toronto shooting Guard stepped up strongly, with a 34 point average over the first 7 games. This was also the year of Drake‘s definitive breakthrough, with his Views album adding a new dimension to his career, by breaking out on a worldwide scale.\n\nSince then, he kept releasing material, no less than 7 albums and tons of stand-alone hits plus features, so much that it gets difficult to get a clear view of his relevance.\n\nWhat we believe to be true about an artist success, is not always translated into numbers too. While we have PER – Player Efficiency Rating – for basketball players, we had no valid indicator to accurately rate music stars.\n\nThat was until, we here at ChartMasters introduced to you the Commensurate Sales to Popularity Concept! We’ll now apply it to the subject of today, Drake!\n\nChartMasters’ method: the CSPC\n\nAs usual, I’ll be using the Commensurate Sales to Popularity Concept (CSPC) in order to relevantly gauge the act’s results. It will not only bring you sales information for all albums, physical and download singles, as well as audio and video streaming. In fact, it will really determine the act’s popularity.\n\nIf you are not yet familiar with the CSPC method, below is a nice and short video of explaining the concept. I recommend watching it before reading on and to the sales figures. You’ll get the idea in just two minutes.\n\nAnd if you want to know the full method as well as formulas, you can read the full introduction article.\n\nNow let’s get into the artist’s detailed sales figures!\n\nDrake Album Sales\n\nUpdated Studio Album Sales & Comments\n\nAt nearly 15.5 million units sold across five studio albums, one playlist and four mixtapes, that we will be considering as valid albums as per their length, sales of Drake studio albums aren’t the most impressive we’ve met so far.\n\nMaybe even more negative is how Views is far from being utterly bigger than his past albums, in fact it sold even easily less than Take Care and the same amount of copies than both Thank Me Later and Nothing Was the Same.\n\nIn the same line, Scorpion sold significantly less than Views, while all projects since Dark Lane Demo Tapes are selling next to nothing.\n\nMost of the releases since More Life got no physical release at all though, which shows the artist and his label are betting their money elsewhere.\n\nIn fact, our CSPC analysis made us understand that we may not jump into conclusions too fast.\n\nTo judge Drake‘s album sales, one needs to consider he sold almost exclusively in North America up to Views. A pure urban artist, he managed to cross over the general audience thanks to this effort that opened him the door of many countries he hadn’t explore before.\n\nSelling routinely 2,5 million units of his studio LPs to this restricted audience is already way more impressive. His mixtapes sales are just superb since this format is usually fully ignored by the public.\n\nIf results viewed that way are great, it is still not the main fort of Drake as we are going to see below.\n\nDrake songs sales\n\nBelow, we list down results from the artist through physical sales, digital sales and streaming.\n\nPlease be aware that when the artist is regarded as the lead act, he is rewarded with 100% of these units, while featured acts share among them a 50% piece of the totals.\n\nPhysical singles\n\nAs a reminder, the weighting is done with a 10 to 3 ratio between one album and one physical single.\n\nAs many of you may expect, Drake never stepped into the physical singles market, hardly selling anything in this format.\n\nBy his debut in 2009, the US market was dead for 7 years. Now that he broke German or French markets in 2016, the physical market has been dead there for some years too.\n\nAs for most artist a few collectors came out still with mostly irrelevant numbers.\n\nDigital songs\n\nAs a reminder, the weighting is done with a 10 to 1,5 ratio between one album and one digital single.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2011, Drake had no global hit. His success in the US was undoubtable though and moderate to great hits got accumulated at an incredible speed.\n\nHis breakthrough hit was Best I Ever Had, which back then also enjoyed a decent ringtones market. It’s up to over 5 million sales to date.\n\nThen, his first two LPs generated a total of 10 distinct million selling songs and all their album tracks did well too.\n\nThe Motto and Take Care are past 4 million sales, while Over, Find Your Love and Headlines are around 3 million a piece.\n\nTake Care album is home for total download sales north of 20 million singles, worth 3 million equivalent album sales.\n\nThis intermediate period wasn’t well structured around one specific album.\n\nBy 2013, Drake had already understood that the concept of the album itself was dying. As a result, he started dropping mixtapes at fast pace, plus tons of collaborations that are listed as orphan songs or features.\n\nHold On, We’re Going Home is the biggest hit of that period extracted from those studio albums, it moved 4.6 million units.\n\nBoth 2015 mixtapes got good hits in the US but with more modest numbers elsewhere. The strongest was Jumpman at 1.7 million.\n\nIn 2016, the singer exploded globally thanks to songs Hotline Bling and One Dance. It may come as a surprise to see that they only sold 4 million units each.\n\nThe collapse of downloads in favor to streams limited their impact.\n\nIn the same vain, God’s Plan has been a monster #1 smash in many places, but downloads were ever weaker by 2018. It’s up to 1.8 million. Both Nice for What and In My Feelings were huge hits as well.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Drake issued tons of stand alone tracks while also featuring on many hits.\n\nForever, Bedrock and What’s My Name sold over 6 million each. Work, F**kin’ Problems, Right Above It and Moment 4 Life all top 3 million.\n\nOn top of that, 16 more orphan and featured songs are million sellers.\n\nIt reflects something crucial here, more than sales of a unique track, the key element is the unreal volume of Drake‘s catalog. It may seem easy to participate in hundreds of songs, but to do it without losing momentum is insane.\n\nAt the end of the day, the Canadian superstar has sold a tremendous total of 172 million units of downloads and ringtones.\n\nThis figure may seem unbelievable considering his top singles are around 6 million units. As mentioned, his consistency and his activity over many years have been unmatched.\n\nIn fact, Drake is already and far and away the artist with the most entries in the US Hot 100 Singes Chart. He took that incredible distinction when he reached 126 charting hits in August 2016 – a mere seven years after his debut. He went on to increase this record to 321 charting hits so far.\n\nStreaming\n\nStreaming is made up of audio and video streams. Our CSPC methodology now includes both to better reflect the real popularity of each track. The main source of data for each avenue is respectively Spotify and YouTube.\n\nTo factor in the growing impact of multiple Asian countries where these platforms aren’t always the go-to site for music streaming, more sources have been added.\n\nIn order to account for their real popularity in each relevant country, the below sources have been used along with the mentioned ratios that reflect the market share of each area.\n\nAudio Streams\n\n– South Korea: Genie streams * 2.20 (consistent with Gaon streaming numbers)\n\n– Japan: AWA streams * 100 / 4 (AWA has 4% of the Japanese streaming market)\n\n– Arabic world: Anghami streams\n\n– Sub-Saharan Africa: Boomplay + Audiomack streams\n\n– Elsewhere: Spotify streams * Spotify market shares based on artists’ market distribution\n\nVideo Streams\n\n– China* : QQ video streams * 50 if the song is available for audio stream, QQ video streams * 5 elseway (scale built based on known figures for several major artists)\n\n– Elsewhere : Youtube views increased by 10% to account for various local platforms\n\n*since Chinese streaming platforms are mostly video streaming platforms, their streams are weighted on par with YouTube streams.\n\nAudio Stream value – 1,500 plays equal 1 album unit\n\nVideo Stream value – 6,750 views equal 1 album unit\n\nEquivalent Albums Sales (EAS) = ( Spotify * ArtistRatio + Genie * 2.20 + AWA * 100 / 4 + Anghami + Boomplay + Audiomack ) / 1500 + ( QQ views* 50(or 5) + YouTube * 1.1 ) / 6750\n\nTop Hits\n\nTo make it simple, each of these 40 songs would be the signature song of most artists. The streaming success of Drake is out of this world.\n\nOne Dance, blocked for long on YouTube, is now over 2.8 billion Spotify streams. It’s one of the rare songs which has been the most streamed of all-time on the platform at some point, it has since been dislodged by Ed Sheeran‘s Shape of You which was itself topped by The Weeknd‘s Blinding Lights.\n\nGod’s Plan is ever closer, itself over 2 million EAS from streams. This one enjoyed a full availablility on YouTube where it recorded over 2 billion views.\n\nSeveral features are very strong in spite of being downgraded, they include Sicko Mode led by Travis Scott, Work by Rihanna, Bad Bunny‘s MIA, and Future hit Life Is Good.\n\nIn My feelings, Hotline Bling, Nice For What and Passionfruit are also phenomenal performers, each with more than 1.6 million EAS.\n\nWhile Dark Lane Demo Tapes was supposed to be a minor mixtape, the 2020 track Toosie Slide posts incredible numbers as well with 1 billion streams on Spotify. It proved that the artist strength remains huge.\n\nMore recent tracks make this stacked top 40, including 3 from Certified Lover Boy, while Jimmy Cooks and Rich Flex are climbing fast.\n\nThe hip-hop icon has massive tracks from all his releases, and no matter if he pairs with Lil Wayne, Future, Rihanna, DJ Khaled, Meek Mill, Chris Brown, etc., he smashes.\n\nThe most stunning results may be totals as Drake now claims over 90 billion streams on Spotify, near 55 billion on YouTube and 105 million equivalent album sales from streams.\n\nFull catalog breakdown\n\nIf you are familiar with the artist’s catalog and want to check details of each and every song, you can access to all of them right here.\n\nKeep yourself up to date\n\nOur website provides you a fantastic tool which fetches updated Spotify streams as you request them, use it to watch these results grow day after day!\n\nWant to compare Drake’s songs with other top hits?\n\nDrake compilations sales\n\nCompilations sales figures listing\n\nFull Length related records Sales – Summary\n\nAs most of Drake EPs and mixtapes are made of tracks unreleased in his studio albums, their sales are mainly allocated to the orphan folder.\n\nTotal Album (all types) Sales per Country\n\nPlease note that some of the countries totals may be slightly incomplete when the figure is N/A for minor releases.\n\nDrake Career CSPC Results\n\nSo, after checking all the figures, how many overall equivalent album sales has each Drake album achieved? Well, at this point we hardly need to add up all of the figures defined in this article!\n\nAlbums CSPC results\n\nIn the following results table, all categories display figures in equivalent album sales. If different, pure sales are listed between parentheses.\n\n'Av.' stands for Average, 'LD' for Last Day.\n\nAs a reminder:\n\nStudio Album: sales of the original album\n\nOther Releases: sales of compilations generated thanks to the album\n\nPhysical Singles: sales of physical singles from the album (ratio 3/10)\n\nDownload Singles: sales of digital singles from the album (ratio 1,5/10)\n\nStreaming: equivalent album sales of all the album tracks (ratio 1/1500 for Audio stream and 1/6750 for Video stream)\n\nArtist career totals\n\nSee where the artist ranks among remaining singers\n\nThis is it ! If pure album sales aren’t enough to validate the fact that Views is Drake biggest album to date, this turns out to be very clear after adding in all pieces of the jigsaw. Closing in 17 million, the album is one of the biggest releases in recent years.\n\nScorpion has been a tremendous beast as well, now at 14.6 million, just like Take Care, which stands at 12.6 million.\n\nBoth albums Nothing Was the Same and More Life are now virtually at 10 million too.\n\nStarting from the former, Drake scored 5 consecutive albums with 10 million sales or more once we exclude mixtapes and collaborative albums.\n\nWhile his discography has been impressively consistent, Certified Lover Boy felt like a lackluster album. It kept amassing streams though, already claiming over 6 million units.\n\nBoth Her Loss (3.5 million) and For All the Dogs register good numbers considering how recent they still are.\n\nIn some months, once the latter grow while weaker performer Honestly, Nevermind climbs, each of his 14 projects will be over 2.5 million sales.\n\nHis total from orphan songs is massive too at almost 18 million. Then, features combine for an even bigger 22 million. Getting Drake on a track is like striking gold.\n\nOut of all sales figures, the most oustanding one is that Drake has now sold over 140 million equivalent album units through all formats.\n\nHow much is he increasing? He scores organically 30 million Spotify streams per day with his lead songs alone. With features, this equals to well over 300,000 album sales every week thanks to streams alone.\n\nSingles CSPC results\n\nThe list is compiled in album equivalent sales generated by each song. Therefore, these figures are not merged units of singles formats. Instead, it includes the weighted sales of the song’s physical single, download, ringtone and streaming. Also included is its share among sales of all albums on which it is featured.\n\nDiscography results\n\nThanks to our new ASR (Artist Success Rating) concept, we know that sales represent 22.43 million times the purchase of entire discography. Coupled with total sales, it translates into an ASR score of 303.
