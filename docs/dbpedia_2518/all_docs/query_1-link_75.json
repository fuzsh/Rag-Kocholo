        "text": "#30: “You All Over Me (Taylor’s Version)(From the Vault)” feat. Maren Morris\n\nFearless (Taylor's Version)\n\nThis plaintive country ballad was first recorded for Swift’s “Fearless” album in 2008, but it didn’t make the final cut. When you compare it with the big hits like “Love Story” and “You Belong with Me,” we can kind of see why. Swift has gone from strength to strength as a songwriter since these early days. But, the chorus is well-crafted and catchy and the verses are full of striking imagery. The song feels almost like a prequel to 1989’s “Clean.” For “Taylor’s Version,” the backing vocals were provided by fellow country-turned-pop star Maren Morris, whose harmonies add something extra to the track.\n\n#29: “Both of Us” (2012) by B.o.B\n\nStrange Clouds\n\nIt’s not one of Taylor’s best known songs, but “Both of Us” is definitely worth a listen. Swift linked up with B.o.B in the early 2010s after visiting his record label in Atlanta. The rapper had previously collaborated with other big names such as Hayley Williams and Jessie J and Taylor was keen to work with him. The pair co-wrote the song with the help of songwriter Ammar Malik and the track’s producers. B.o.B’s rap discusses poverty and the struggle of the under-dog, while Taylor sweetens the deal with her wistful, melodic chorus. Pretty, with a simple message, the track showcases how these two very different artists make a great team.\n\n#28: “Renegade” (2021) by Big Red Machine\n\nHow Long Do You Think It's Gonna Last?\n\nIndie folk band, Big Red Machine, is in itself a collaboration between Aaron Dessner of The National and Justin Vernon of Bon Iver. Both artists worked with Taylor Swift to help create her albums “Folklore” and “Evermore.” “Renegade” was written after work on “Evermore” wrapped, and everyone agreed it was destined for Big Red Machine. Dessner loved Taylor’s lyrics and we agree that they hit hard. Swift also sings lead vocals on the track. The song was released on the album “How Long Do You Think It’s Gonna Last?” Taylor also contributes backing vocals to “Birch,” another song on the tracklist.\n\n#27: “That’s When (Taylor’s Version) (From the Vault)” (2021) feat. Keith Urban\n\nFearless (Taylor's Version)\n\nAlthough “That’s When” was released in 2021, we’ve got to look at it in context. It’s a vault track from “Fearless” and was written with The Warren Brothers when Taylor was just fourteen. It’s clear she’s very talented, but we also love the fact that she returned to her country roots for her collaborations on “Fearless (Taylor’s Version).” Although “That’s When” was originally a solo, Swift decided that it would work better as a duet. She teamed up with Grammy award-winning country artist Keith Urban, who provides vocals on the song. He also contributed harmonies to a second vault track, “We Were Happy.”\n\n#26: “Anti-Hero” (2022) feat. Bleachers\n\nMidnights\n\nDid we really need a remix of “Anti-Hero” so soon? Probably not, but we love it anyway. This version of the “Midnights” song features Bleachers, the stage name of Swift’s frequent collaborator Jack Antonoff and his band. The remix feels less reflective and more upbeat than the original, while the synths add an eighties vibe and the additional vocals make Swift’s narrator sound less lonely. We love the addition of Antonoff’s reassuring “Taylor you’ll be fine” - which has since become a tradition at the Eras tour. If we could change one thing about this version though, we’d bring back that iconic “sexy baby” line. It’s just not the same without it.\n\n#25: “Babe” (2018) by Sugarland\n\nBigger\n\nWritten by Swift and Pat Monaghan from Train, “Babe” was originally intended for the Red album. It eventually found its way onto Taylor’s Version of the record as a solo, but was first released in 2018 by country music duo Sugarland. Taylor was a Sugarland fan and offered the song to Jennifer Nettles and Kristian Bush when they reunited after a five-year hiatus. Swift also provides backing vocals on the track. “Babe” is a catchy, country-pop ballad that tells the tale of a cheating lover. Nettles’ voice is a perfect fit for the song and Taylor clearly had fun dressing up to play ‘the other woman’ in the music video.\n\n#24: “Two Is Better Than One” (2009) by Boys Like Girls\n\nLove Drunk\n\nPop-rock isn’t Taylor Swift’s usual brand, but somehow this collab with “Boys Like Girls” just makes sense. Swift had previously written with the band’s lead singer, Martin Johnson, and their track “You’ll Always Find Your Way Back Home” was featured in the “Hannah Montana” movie. “Two Is Better Than One” was the official single from the band’s second album, “Love Drunk.” It’s an emotional rock ballad co-written by Swift and Johnson. It also features Taylor as a secondary vocalist. Her voice blends beautifully with Martin’s and the song as a whole makes for a unique addition to the Taylor Swift canon.\n\n#23: “Castles Crumbling (Taylor’s Version) (From the Vault)” (2023) feat. Hayley Williams\n\nSpeak Now (Taylor's Version)\n\nTaylor Swift and Paramore’s Hayley Williams first connected at a Grammy party in 2008, via some genius networking by Taylor’s mom Andrea. “Castles Crumbling” is their first single together - and it was worth the wait. This emotional indie ballad has been dubbed the “dark sister” of “Long Live.” It’s also been compared to other Swift tracks, like “Mirrorball” and “The Archer,” which deal with themes of insecurity and self-doubt. The lyrics are thought to have been influenced by that Kanye West incident at the 2009 VMAs. “Castles Crumbling” is more mellow than we might have suspected from a Hayley Williams collaboration, but it’s also well constructed, poignant and gorgeously ethereal.\n\n#22: “Highway Don’t Care” (2013) by Tim McGraw & Taylor Swift feat. Keith Urban\n\nTwo Lanes of Freedom\n\nIn 2006, Taylor Swift debuted her first ever single, “Tim McGraw.” In 2013, she joined forces with the country music icon to release “Highway Don’t Care.” This love song meets road-safety message also features Keith Urban on guitar. The lyrics tell the story of a heartbroken lover, whose mind is on everything but the road. The music video highlights how easily inattentive driving can lead to accidents. McGraw and Swift share the lead on the verses and the chorus. Their voices pair well together and Urban’s country guitar stylings are the cherry on the cake.\n\n#21: “Breathe (Taylor’s Version)” (2021) feat. Colbie Caillat\n\nFearless\n\nSinger-songwriter Colbie Caillat captured a young Taylor Swift’s attention with her debut album “Coco” back in 2007. Around that time, Taylor was working on“Fearless” and she asked her management to hook them up. The result was a beautiful break-up song, co-written by Caillat, who also provides secondary vocals on the track. Although “Breathe” is often assumed to be a love-song, the lyrics are actually about growing apart from a close friend. It may not have been one of the most popular songs on the “Fearless” album, but we think it’s stood the test of time. Swift and Caillat reunited to re-record the song in the early 2020s and Taylor’s mature vocals make this version even better.\n\n#20: “Lover (Remix)” (2019) feat. Shawn Mendes\n\nSingle\n\nAlthough the original version of “Lover” from the album of the same name remains our favorite, we’re fond of this duet remix too. The addition of Shawn Mendes’s verses turn what was a romantic monologue into a dialogue between two lovers. If the original was a wedding speech, with the narrator declaring her love to the world, the remix is a conversation, with each partner reassuring the other of their feelings. Though Swift’s solo version may feel more personal and more deeply romantic, the remix has its own charm. The new verses bring a youthful, light-hearted vibe and Swift and Mendes’ voices really complement each other.\n\n#19: “I Don’t Wanna Live Forever” (2016) by Zayn & Taylor Swift\n\nFifty Shades Darker (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n\nThe soundtracks were probably the best thing about the “Fifty Shades” movies and “I Don’t Wanna Live Forever” became the highest charting single of the franchise. Written by Swift, Jack Antonoff and Sam Dew, the song was also Grammy nominated and voted “Best Collaboration” at the 2017 VMAs. With its RnB meets electro-pop sound, this sultry duet was a bit of a different direction for Taylor, but she definitely did something right. The critics loved it and so did the mainstream. The track was a great fit for Zayn and helped establish him as a successful solo artist internationally. Zayn and Taylor had great musical chemistry and their voices sounded fantastic together.\n\n#18: “Cowboy like Me” (2020) feat. Marcus Mumford\n\nEvermore\n\nThe lead singer of Mumford & Sons was revealed to be the mystery background vocalist on this “Evermore” track, and we think he was the perfect pick. “Cowboy like Me” is a story-song following two scam-artists who fall in love. It has a laid -back, country-folk vibe that suits Mumford’s voice well. Like “Folklore,” “Evermore” is an album that showcases some of Swift’s strongest storytelling and “Cowboy Like Me” has a compelling narrative. Throwing male harmonies into the mix helps us to see the love story from two perspectives and also creates an earthier sound. This one’s a bit of an underrated gem.\n\n#17: “Snow on the Beach” (2022) feat. Lana Del Rey\n\nMidnights\n\nAfter Swift announced that “Midnights” would include a collaboration with the one and only Lana Del Ray, fans and critics alike were expecting big things. Co-written by Swift, Del Rey and Jack Antonoff, “Snow on the Beach” was the only feature on the original version of the album. Del Rey’s harmonies are woven into a dreamlike production and her voice blends perfectly with Swift’s. The lyrics use memorable imagery to recreate the beautiful but surreal feeling of falling in love. Some felt cheated by the lack of Lana on the track, but Taylor took the feedback on board, releasing an edited version featuring “More Lana Del Rey.” In the new version, Del Rey sings the whole second verse - and we approve.\n\n#16: “Nothing New (Taylor’s Version) (From the Vault)” (2021) feat. Phoebe Bridgers\n\nRed (Taylor's Version)\n\nSwift wrote “Nothing New” back when she was twenty-two and working on her “Red” album. Almost ten years later she dug it out of the vault, dusted it off and took it to indie artist Phoebe Bridgers, who helped turn it into a duet. The song is a gentle, melancholy ballad that explores Swift’s fears of getting older and becoming irrelevant. It’s also been read as a comment on the treatment of young women, both in the music industry and throughout society as a whole. “Nothing New” is a sad story, but a pretty song, and Bridgers’ gorgeous harmonies are the perfect addition to the track.\n\n#15: “ME!” (2019) feat. Brendan Urie\n\nLover\n\nAfter the dark drama of the “Reputation” years, Taylor changed up the narrative and the aesthetic. What better way to signal in a new, more light-hearted era than with this sunny, bubblegum-pop duet? Swift’s lead singles aren’t usually her most complex work, but they’re definitely dance-able. She’s joined on this one by Brendan Urie of Panic! At the Disco, and the musical style is a departure for him too. But he really threw himself into it. Critics were mixed on the track, but it’s feel-good, campy and fun, with a great hook. Plus, how can you hate a song about self-love?\n\n#14: “Soon You’ll Get Better” (2019) feat. The Chicks\n\nLover\n\nTaylor put her heart out on the line with this stripped-back, country tune about her mother’s cancer. Country music legends, The Chicks, (formerly the Dixie Chicks) provide some lovely harmonies, while Swift takes lead vocals. Taylor cites The Chicks as a massive influence on her music, praising their creativity, boldness and their ability to harness female rage into their songs. However, “Soon You’ll Get Better” shows a gentler side to the trio. The song’s production includes banjo, fiddle and slide-guitar but the tone is muted, like a lullaby. It’s a hard listen, as Taylor’s lyrics are painfully vulnerable. But it’s pretty too.\n\n#13: “Half of My Heart” (2010) by John Mayer\n\nBattle Studies\n\nWe know it’s a John Mayer song, but we have to admit, this is just plain good. “Half of my Heart” was supposedly the beginning of Swift and Mayer’s brief love affair and the only track the pair ever collaborated on. In 2009, Mayer tweeted about an idea for a song that he’d love to record with Taylor, saying “She would make a killer Stevie Nicks in contrast to my Tom Petty of a song.” The wheels were put in motion and “Half of My Heart” became a duet, with Swift singing on the chorus and during the bridge. The song has a definite Fleetwood Mac energy, but it’s Taylor’s contribution that really adds that something special.\n\n#12: “Electric Touch (Taylor’s Version) (From the Vault)” (2023) feat. Fall Out Boy\n\nSpeak Now (Taylor's Version)\n\nBoth the original “Speak Now” and Taylor’s Version may not have reached the same heights as her other albums. However, we reckon its vault tracks are some of her strongest. This collaboration with Fall Out Boy might just be our favorite. The band’s frontman, Patrick Stump, provides guest vocals and electric guitar, bringing a pop-punk flavor to the track. Meanwhile, the lyrics are quintessential, early-days Taylor. The song captures the anticipation before that first hang-out with a new prospective romance - could this be the one or will it all end in heartbreak? Feelings of anxiety and youthful optimism are set to a floor-filling, stadium-pop production. The result is a perfect summer banger.\n\n#11: “Coney Island” (2021) feat. The National\n\nEvermore\n\nAs well as featuring on their song “The Alcott”, Swift worked closely with The National’s Aaron Dessner to produce her eighth and ninth albums, “Folklore” and “Evermore.” He and his twin brother, Bryce, wrote the instrumental for “Coney Island”, while their bandmates provided drums, bass and vocals. Matt Berninger, who duets with Swift on the song, said working with her was “like dancing with Gene Kelly. She made [him] look good and didn't drop [him] once.” Berninger’s gruff baritone contrasts starkly with Taylor’s voice, but the light and shade really fits the mood of this song. It’s a smart, well-executed collaboration that we think deserves more love.\n\n#10: “End Game” (2017) feat. Ed Sheeran & Future\n\nReputation\n\nHowever you feel about Ed Sheeran’s rapping, it makes a memorable addition to this “Reputation” track, which also features American rapper, Future. Co-written by Future, Swift and Sheeran, the song alludes to the reputations of the stars and the gossip surrounding them. It’s about finding the right person amid the madness. Sheeran’s verse was inspired by a meeting with his future wife, who he reconnected with at a Fourth of July party at Taylor’s house. “End Game” is an R’n’B-influenced track and just one more example of Swift experimenting with different musical genres. Her lyrics are as sharp as ever, the critics praised Future’s contribution and the three artists are fantastic together.\n\n#9: “Evermore” (2020) feat. Bon Iver\n\nEvermore\n\nAfter being featured on one song from “Folklore”, Bon Iver frontman, Justin Vernon, was back for more on its sister album. The title track is a poignant piano ballad written by Swift and then-boyfriend Joe Alwyn, who also plays the piano part. Vernon’s vocals come in during the bridge, adding a chaotic response that reflects the tumult of emotions described in the lyrics. “Evermore” deals with themes of depression, describing a period where the narrator felt down and hopeless, before coming out on the other side. Swift has said the song is about “the process of finding hope again.” It’s a quiet, unassuming track, but Swift’s vocals here are beautiful and the emotion feels heartfelt.\n\n#8: “Karma (Remix)” (2023) feat. Ice Spice\n\nMidnights - Late Night Edition\n\nWith its infectious, feel-good energy and playful lyrics, the original version of “Karma” was hailed as one of the standouts of the “Midnights” album. For the re-mix and music video, Swift teamed up with rising star, Ice Spice, to add a little something extra. Ice Spice has also worked with Nicki Minaj, Pink Pantheress and even Aqua, but “Karma” is Swift’s first collaboration with a female rapper. With her laid-back rapping style, Ice Spice’s verse brings a change of mood and pace to the track. Her lyrics complement Taylor’s while infusing the song with something new and fresh. And of course, we love the girl power vibe. Facts.\n\n#7: “Safe & Sound” (2012) feat. The Civil Wars\n\nThe Hunger Games: Songs from District 12 and Beyond\n\nWhen putting together the soundtrack for the original “Hunger Games” film, producer T-Bone Burnett reached out to Taylor Swift and folk duo “The Civil Wars.” The result was “Safe & Sound,” a haunting ballad told from the perspective of the movie’s heroine, Katniss Everdeen. Katniss’s home, District 12, is supposedly a futuristic version of the Appalachian mountains, and Burnett wanted this reflected in the music. The steel guitars set the tone, while Swift sings her melancholy lullaby, accompanied by the delicate harmonies of The Civil Wars. The song struck a chord with fans and critics alike. In 2013, it also won a Grammy for “Best Song Written for Visual Media.”\n\n#6: “no body, no crime” (2021) feat. HAIM\n\nEvermore\n\nDo you love a true crime series? Well, you’re in good company. It was Taylor’s obsession with the grizzly genre that sparked the idea for this catchy murder ballad. “no body, no crime” tells the story of a woman’s mysterious disappearance, her friend’s search for the truth and her ultimate revenge. It’s a dark and twisty piece of Americana with a strong country and western flavor. It’s also loads of fun. Swift brought in the HAIM sisters to provide backing vocals and they really got into the spirit of things. Swift even namedrops Este as a character in the story. HAIM later featured Taylor on the 2021 remix of their track, “Gasoline.”\n\n#5: “The Last Time (Taylor’s Version)” (2013) feat. Gary Lightbody\n\nRed\n\nThe critics were divided on “The Last Time” back in 2013, but this overlooked classic remains one of our favorite Taylor Swift collaborations. The song is a duet with Gary Lightbody, the lead singer of Snow Patrol, and it leans into the band’s indie-alt-rock sound. It’s a power ballad exploring the emotions of a couple who appear to be at a breaking point and are struggling to communicate. During this era, Swift was beginning to break away from country music and try out new musical styles. As experiments go, “The Last Time” was pretty successful. Lightbody also returned to re-record his part for the “Red” album, Taylor’s version, which was released in 2021.\n\n#4: “I Bet You Think About Me (Taylor’s Version) (From the Vault)” (2021) feat. Chris Stapleton\n\nRed (Taylor's Version)\n\nTaylor Swift has written some beautiful things about the people she loves and respects - and we appreciate mature Taylor. But you’ve also got to love it when she’s petty. “I Bet You Think About Me” is such a banging vault track that it’s a travesty it was kept from us for so long. In a brief return to her musical roots, Swift got country artist, Chris Stapleton, in on the action. Alongside the harmonica warbles and the steel guitars, Swift joyfully belts out those snarky lyrics. Stapleton’s vocals lend an added authenticity and the pair sound great together. Co-written by Swift and Lori McKenna, it’s all very tongue-in-cheek, but it’s also seriously good.\n\n#3: “Everything Has Changed (Taylor’s Version)” (2013) feat. Ed Sheeran\n\nRed\n\nEd Sheeran has become one of Taylor Swift’s good friends and most frequent collaborators. As well as “End Game,” the pair have also given the world “Run” and “The Joker and the Queen.” “Everything Has Changed” was their first joint outing and it’s still our favorite. It’s a sweet little duet with pop and folk influences, driven by acoustic guitars and pretty harmonies. There are no bells and whistles, just two people singing a simple song about love. It may be too syrupy for some tastes, but it’s performed with a winning sincerity and Sheeran and Swift are magic together.\n\n#2: “Bad Blood (Taylor’s Version)” (2015) feat. Kendrick Lamar\n\n1989\n\nCast your mind back to 2015 and the era of Taylor Swift’s ‘squad.’ “1989” was breaking records, Swift was reportedly feuding with Katy Perry and the “Bad Blood” video was definitely a moment. As well as a host of famous friends, the music video (and a remix of the track itself) included Kendrick Lamar as a featured artist. Lamar’s star turn was praised by critics and Swifties loved it too. A song that had previously been considered one of the weaker tracks on the album became a chart-storming hit and one of the best-selling singles of the year. Characterized by drums, bass and defiant lyrics, “Bad Blood” already had anthem potential, but the remix has the edge on the original. The rapper even re-recorded his verses for Taylor’s Version.\n\n#1: “Exile” (2020) feat. Bon Iver\n\nFolklore\n\nWhen “Folklore” was released in 2020, it blindsided us all and quickly became the music critics’ darling. Much of the praise was heaped on “Exile”, Swift’s memorable collaboration with the band Bon Iver. It’s an undeniably beautiful song, featuring some gorgeous harmonies, vivid imagery and complex melodies. It was co-written by Swift, Joe Alwyn and Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon. “Exile” is an unusual track that grows on you with each listen. Despite its melancholy atmosphere, it never becomes a dirge. Vernon’s deep, melodious voice is balanced by Taylor’s sweeter tone and the final result is something really special.\n\nWhat artists would you love Taylor to collaborate with?
