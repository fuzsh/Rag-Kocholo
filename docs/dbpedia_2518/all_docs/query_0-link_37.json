I’d thought about it a lot and fans who came to these intimate, stripped down shows would often drift by the merch booth at the end and ask “Which of these records sounds like the show you just played?” I’d point to some older releases like “Fluorescent” or the “Live In Bremen” collection I made in 2003 with Jason Victor but none of the documented history could provide a literal translation of what they’d been watching.\n\nIn the last few years I’d been listening quite a bit to Bill Callahan. He’s a great songwriter, daring lyricist and his voice is distinctive and beautiful. But I also really loved the production on his records. They all sound so fantastic. I checked the credits and saw they were almost all recorded by Brian Beattie at a studio in Austin, Texas. I knew that was the sound I’d want to have on my first solo acoustic record.\n\nAs it turned out, the Dream Syndicate had a show in Austin on November 1 of last year and I didn’t have to be anywhere for a few days. I got in touch with Brian and he was free those days so I made plans to record a selection of songs from my back catalogue that I thought would suit his approach and sound. I always enjoy this blind-date, travelogue style of working and in the past I tried to make records in which I would choose or write material to represent some mystical fantasy of what my music might sound like, for example, with Chris Eckman in the pastoral city of Ljubljana (“Crossing Dragon Bridge”) or the blunt ferocity of the band Come in their gritty hometown of Boston (“Melting In the Dark.”).\n\nThis one was a similar approach. Like many songwriters, I’m often tempted to shelter my lyrics and vocals by adding extra layers so that I feel a little less vulnerable. Not this time. I went for some of the most lyric-heavy, emotionally stark songs in my catalog and knew that the vocal would be the focal point of the record. And that’s exactly what happened. Brian’s approach was indeed to put me in a room, surround me with vintage mics, guitars and processors and just capture my performance in the most honest, stark way possible.\n\nWeiterlesen / Read more\n\nKommentare deaktiviert für New STEVE WYNN release on Blue Rose – Solo! Acoustic (Vol. 1) exclusively available through the Blue Rose mailorder and at shows of Steve Wynn!\n\nUS RAILS continues their journey into the next decade with a brand new record, Mile By Mile (Blue Rose Records). Ben Arnold, Scott Bricklin, Tom Gillam and Matt Muir have made a conscious effort to open the gates and let their Rock n’roll horses run free. This is not to say they’ve abandoned their trademark harmony vocal blend. It’s still there front and center, but with more musical muscle underneath. Drawn from their collective influences and takes on rock and vintage R&B, the good-time recording atmosphere of the recording sessions, during a summertime week in Philadelphia, is palpable on each and every track. These rapidly changing times in the U.S. and around the world, show them wearing some of their thoughts and beliefs, as well as their hearts on their well tattered sleeves. Mile By Mile, the band‘s 5th full length original album, shows them growing even more comfortable and loose, diving into some of their ragged, rock roots in a collection of songs that have some of the feel of the past with an eye toward the future.\n\nWhat was once just a one off, go-for-the-thrill experiment, has by now become a fixture in the lives of each member of US RAILS while they all continue to pursue thriving solo careers, producing, recording, and releasing countless albums on their own. It is their separate experience, spun together, which adds layer upon layer to the solid bedrock that forms the foundation of this band’s rare and exceptional sound.\n\nUS RAILS are now looking forward to taking it all out on the road throughout Spain, Italy, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and The Netherlands again this year. Jackson Parten from Austin, Texas will be joining the band on bass guitar for the tour.\n\nA well seasoned, veteran live act, this is a band who has shared the better part of their lives playing masterful, iconic sounding rock and roll in the shadows of the giants but continues to create, evolve, persist, and have a lot of laughs and fun along the way Mile By Mile!\n\nKommentare deaktiviert für Following a covers album US RAILS are back with a new album of eleven originals!\n\nFor several years Todd Thibaud and Kim Taylor had the same management. Their idea was that both musicians should try writing songs together that the management could then submit to their contacts. Both finally met each other in person at SXSW several years ago and struck up a friendship.\n\nWhile they were at SXSW, they made plans to get together for a writing session the next time Kim traveled to Boston from her home in Ohio. When she was in Boston they met up and actually had no luck that day writing a song, but discovered that they really liked singing together. The idea for a collaboration project came from that meeting. They talked about how interesting it would be to focus the songwriting for their collaboration on the struggles and joys of relationships/marriage etc. Both of them were busy with their own projects at the time, but they agreed to stay in touch and make this happen as soon as the time was right. After a few years had gone by without any progress, it was Taylor who took the initiative and got the ball rolling for what would become WATER AND SAND.\n\n„We struggled coming up with a name for our project, sending each other lists of potential options, but nothing seemed to really resonate“, Thibaud recalls. „Both of us were in the process of writing songs at that time for our forthcoming album, and Kim sent me one of her new ones called ‚Water and Sand‘. I loved the song as soon as I heard it, and as the two of us discussed it, I think we both agreed that it would actually make a good band name for our project. We ran it by our management and some trusted friends/family, and everyone seemed to like it. I think for us the name relates to the balances that life imposes and requires of us. The two sides of the coin. The Yin and Yang. The life giving water and the gritty, abrasive sand. There are many joys and good times in our lives, but of course, there are also times of struggle and pain. I think the name points to those co-existing experiences.“\n\nCompared to their own releases, WATER AND SAND is different. „We both wanted to center the project around two vocals, singing together, in harmony, and build things from there; always keeping those elements front and center. We never made any hard and fast rules in regard to other instrumentation. We’ve just always tried to do what’s right for the songs, and not overshadow the vocals too much.“\n\nWeiterlesen / Read more\n\nKommentare deaktiviert für WATER AND SAND is Todd Thibaud and Kim Taylor – they are back with new album Catching Light!\n\nOmnidirectional is the seventh album from The Schramms, a beautiful work of art that was ten long years in the making. Frontman / guitarist / writer Dave Schramm has painstakingly assembled an expansive, cinescopic work that will delight long-time fans and new listeners alike. The album features drummer Ron Metz and bassist Al Greller who’ve played together with Dave in The Schramms since the 1980s, with JD Foster (Lucinda Williams, Richard Buckner, Calexico, Marc Ribot) producing.\n\nDave Schramm is perhaps best known as an original member and lead guitarist for Yo La Tengo, but over the years has worked with a wide assortment of notable artists from the Replacements to Richard Buckner and all points in between. In recent years, he created the Radio Free Song Club with singer / songwriter Kate Jacobs and disc jockey Nicholas Hill, a successful radio show / podcast showcasing a group of songwriting heavyweights that’s included Victoria Williams, Peter Holsapple, Freedy Johnston, Laura Cantrell, Robin Holcomb, Howe Gelb, Peter Blegvad, Jody Harris, Don Piper, Amy Allison, Amy Rigby and Wreckless Eric.\n\nSchramm and Ron Metz had been playing with cult faves Akron, OH’s The Human Switchboard before Dave fell in with guitarist Ira Kaplan and drummer Georgia Hubley, joining Yo La Tengo for their debut album, Ride The Tiger, and the recordings that preceded it. He would re-unite with the band along with Greller on their much-beloved 1990 release Fakebook as well as its 2015 sequel Stuff Like That There.\n\nAfter the release of Ride The Tiger, and a subsequent tour, Schramm struck out on his own, reuniting with Metz who’d recently arrived in New York. At their first gig, they billed themselves „The Schramms“ as a joke, but the name stuck! There were several early line-ups, some including other Yo La Tengo alumni, with personnel shifting even as work started on their first album, Walk to Delphi. The Tall Lonesome Pines‘ Al Greller joined as bassist and has been with the band ever since.\n\nRenowned as musician’s musicians, each of the members of the core band has been tapped to help out other artists over the years. Dave has recorded with Peter Holsapple and Chris Stamey (on Mavericks, It’s Alright, Fireworks), The Replacements (All Shook Down), Yo La Tengo (Fakebook, Stuff Like That There), Richard Buckner (Since), Freedy Johnston (Can You Fly, This Perfect World, Never Home), Soul Asylum (Let Your Dim Light Shine), Whiskeytown and many others. Al was with Peter Stampfel and the Bottlecaps and The Tall Lonesome Pines before The Schramms, and later Yo La Tengo, Beat Rodeo, Paul Presti (of the Unholy Modal Rounders), The Tractors, Riff Doctors, and a Gene the Singing Plumber. Ron contributed to the solo efforts of former Human Switchboard bandmates, Bob Pfeifer and Myrna Marcarian; he currently plays with Glenn Morrow’s Cry For Help and Tammy Faye Starlite. Other erstwhile Schramms would go on to work with musicians like Ian Hunter, Ryan Adams, John Mayer, Little Steven, et al.\n\nSo The Schramms have been keeping busy since their last album’s release – Omnidirectional wound up being recorded in sporadic bursts over the course of a decade, but the end results show it was a labor of love for all involved and well worth the wait.\n\nKommentare deaktiviert für After nineteen years THE SCHRAMMS return with the new studio album Omnidirectional !\n\nKing Of Madrid is Peter Bruntnell’s tenth studio album, and it’s one that focuses on his unique songwriting talents. It also sees him returning to his roots, featuring beautiful, sometimes sixties-flavoured songs with his signature hints of psychedelia. Bruntnell’s warm voice helps create a yearning atmosphere that gives the album a consistent and organic feel.\n\nThe self-effacing Devonian is the ultimate musician’s musician, gaining respect from his peers all over the world for the atmospheric works that he creates with his long-distance songwriting partner Bill Ritchie. Kathleen Edwards, when planning her first album, gave the producer Bruntnell’s Normal For Bridgewater album and asked him to „make it sound like this“. Willy Vlautin simply says, „Peter Bruntnell is my favourite singer in the world“.\n\nKing Of Madrid was recorded in the Kiln, King’s Langley with Bruntnell’s long-term band Mick Clews (drums), Peter Noone (bass) and Dave Little (guitar) and their familiarity and comfortable interaction makes for a confident interpretation of the new songs. It was Bruntnell who wrote the inspirational anti-Trump song „Mr Sunshine“ on 2016’s Nos Da Comrade and politics are never far from King Of Madrid either. „National Library“ and „Thief Of Joy“ are both articulate takes on Brexit, with the writer commenting on the latter: „Of course the thief of joy is Pride, but as far as Brexit and May and the Bullingdon Boys go, obviously everybody already knows that“.\n\nIn „London Clay“ (reprised here from its original version on 2012’s unofficial release Ringo Woz ‚Ere), a man daydreams about ways he could possibly be together with his unrequited love, but even in the dreams it never quite works out. Typically of this songwriting team, odd and mysterious topics are tackled too: „Lucan“ muses whether the elusive lord is fish food or living in Libreville, Africa, while in „Dinosaur“, Mark Zuckerberg gets hit by a meteor. The title track is a lilting, reflective waltz, while the stunning „Broken Wing“, arguably the album’s standout track, is a song concerning a young person growing up in an evangelical cult. The song allows the band to hit a groove and stretch out instrumentally.\n\nHelping to underline the luscious sound (synthesiser, electric twelve-string and pedal steel abound) are guests BJ Cole, Iain Sloan and the Pretenders‘ James Walbourne, who provides synth flourishes.\n\nKing Of Madrid showcases a classic English songwriter at the top of his game.\n\nKommentare deaktiviert für King Of Madrid is PETER BRUNTNELL’s tenth studio album and it’s one that focuses on his unique songwriting talents.\n\nIf you go into the studio planning to hopefully record ten songs in ten days and you come out the other end after little more than half this time with all 15 of your new songs recorded and in the bag, you have every right to call that a successful session! This happened in late October of 2018 at 7V studios in Bockenem/Germany to Markus Rill – considered by experts and fans to be Germany’s finest Americana artist for more than 20 years – and his band The Troublemakers as they recorded their brand-new album Songland. The title tells the story: Rill’s\n\nsongwriting – the joy he finds in poetic, sometimes surrealist lyrics, in creative eloquence as a logical evolution of his earlier, purer storytelling – is at the heart of the album. Musically, Rill and his guys always play in service of the song and do so in absolutely terrific fashion. Not one of the 15 tracks falls short of the others in any way, so Rill’s decision to forget about marketing ploys or saving any song as a possible bonus track makes perfect artistic sense. Almost an hour of Songland – a true feast for fans!\n\nSince 1997 Markus Rill from Würzburg has been living proof that you don’t necessarily need American genes to write and sing authentic folk & roots music. He’s been touring in Germany and Europe for more than twenty years and has steadily released album after strong album which makes his back catalogue quite an impressive one. Since his second album, The Devil & The Open Road (1999), he’s been signed to Blue Rose Records who have released most of his albums since then. There’s the trilogy of albums recorded with some of Nashville’s finest musicians – Hobo Dream (2004), The Price Of Sin (2006) and The Things That Count (2007) -, the meaty Americana songwriter effort Wild Blue & True (2011) and in early 2013 the tremendous band album My Rocket Ship, recorded with The Troublermakers. With Dream Anyway in 2016 Rill & band made a quantum leap. This gem was very varied, sounded fantastic and presented a mature artist with depth and rock’n’roll appeal at the apex of his abilities (up to now). In early 2018 he released Getting Into Trouble for his 20-year anniversary, a double album featuring new material and a collection of rare tracks culled from limited releases or collaborative albums with Swedish New Folk artist Annika Fehling or his German colleagues Hubert Treml & Franz Schuier.\n\nWeiterlesen / Read more\n\nKommentare deaktiviert für The title tells the story – MARKUS RILL’s songwriting is the heart of Songland !\n\nLike his last record, Waterfall, Todd Thibaud’s studio albums have been predominantly full band, rock collections, charged with a collective energy that effortlessly pulls the listener in on his journey. With Hill West, that energy still resonates, but Thibaud steers it toward a more intimate, stark approach, fueled by a changing and uncertain world. Inspired by artists and albums such as Johnny Cash’s American Recordings, Gillian Welch’s Revival, Aimee Mann, and Nick Lowe, Thibaud, a Blue Rose artist since 1997, homes in on the essentials: lyric, melody, and voice.\n\nThe result is a poignant reflection on our modern world – in a time when other artists have chosen to eschew the big questions or sit still with themselves long enough to look inside. In songs like „Find Your Love“, Thibaud shares a glimpse into two people’s struggle to grapple with the fear and pain that surrounds them, zooming his lens out as he goes to view the greater picture of human relationships. „Great Unknown“ explores the nostalgia we all have for the simpler, hopeful times experienced in youth – when uncertainty was fueled by big dreams – with lyrics reminiscent of Pete Yorn’s Music for the Morning After. In the gritty, forceful „Edge of Breaking“, Thibaud takes the wheel of his future, demanding a fearless love from the perspective of nothing left to lose. „Path of Us“, perhaps the barest track with only his voice and an acoustic guitar, turns back to those two lovers, offering a bittersweet delivery but hopeful message. „Something about open doors, makes me feel so unsure… But what I wouldn’t do for you.“ While the narrator may be unsure, the message is clear: we always have a friend to share our burdens.\n\nWeiterlesen / Read more\n\nKommentare deaktiviert für Six years after Waterfall TODD THIBAUD is back with Hill West !"
