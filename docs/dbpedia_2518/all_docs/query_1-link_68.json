        "text": "Hard Rock Titans Unite: HALESTORM and I PREVAIL Announce Co-Headlining Summer Tour with Explosive New Collab\n\nGet ready for a summer of sonic mayhem! Hard rock heavyweights HALESTORM and I PREVAIL are joining forces for a co-headlining tour that promises to scorch the earth (or at least your eardrums) from Raleigh, North Carolina on July 9th all the way to Las Vegas, Nevada on August 17th. Produced by Live Nation, this tour isn’t just about two powerhouse bands sharing the stage – it’s the driving force behind their scorching new collaborative track, “Can U See Me In The Dark?“\n\nA Match Made in Hard Rock Heaven\n\nThis epic collaboration is a perfect reflection of the tour’s energy. Imagine the electrifying chemistry between I PREVAIL‘s vocalist Eric Vanlerberghe and HALESTORM‘s legendary Lzzy Hale, throw in some face-melting riffs and an unforgettable chorus, and you’ve got the recipe for a guaranteed summer smash. Don’t just take our word for it – check out the official lyric video below and prepare to have “Can U See Me In The Dark?” stuck in your head for weeks to come.\n\nHALESTORM: A Force of Nature\n\nHALESTORM is no stranger to rocking the world. This Grammy Award-winning band, born from the childhood dreams of siblings Lzzy and Arejay Hale, has amassed a staggering 2.5 billion streams globally and cemented themselves as one of the most celebrated rock bands of the past two decades.\n\nTheir latest offering, “Back From The Dead,” is a testament to their enduring power. Rolling Stone hailed the title track as “a cathartic howler about overcoming obstacles,” and both it and “The Steeple” marked their fifth and sixth No. 1 hits at rock radio, respectively.\n\nBut the accolades don’t stop there. Associated Press declared the album “a contender for best hard rock/metal album of the year,” while Loudwire solidified their legacy by naming HALESTORM “Rock Artist Of The Decade” in 2019. Fronted by the incomparable Lzzy Hale, with her brother Arejay on drums, guitarist Joe Hottinger, and bassist Josh Smith rounding out the lineup, HALESTORM has earned multiple platinum and gold certifications.\n\nThey’ve dominated stages worldwide, headlining sold-out shows, topping festival bills, and even sharing the stage with icons like HEAVEN & HELL, Alice Cooper, Joan Jett, and JUDAS PRIEST. Lzzy‘s influence extends beyond the stage – she’s the first female brand ambassador for Gibson and graced our screens as the host of AXS TV‘s “A Year In Music.”\n\nI PREVAIL: The Standard Bearers of Modern Hard Rock\n\nI PREVAIL have established themselves as the undisputed leaders of 21st century hard rock. Their latest album, “True Power,” produced by the legendary Tyler Smyth, brings the hammer down with stadium-sized riffs that will leave you grinning from ear to ear and unforgettable melodies that will burrow into your brain and refuse to leave.\n\nPrepare for a sonic assault that seamlessly blends guttural screams straight from the depths of hell with soaring vocals and heartfelt lyrics that resonate deep within your soul. “True Power” isn’t just an album – it’s an experience. This isn’t their first rodeo – I PREVAIL has risen to arena level success, scoring two Grammy nominations (including “Best Rock Album” for “Trauma” and “Best Metal Performance” for the crushing “Bow Down“).\n\nWith over 4.1 billion global streams, 716 million YouTube views, and multiple chart-topping singles (“Hurricane” and “Bad Things” both conquered Billboard’s Mainstream Rock Airplay chart), their music has garnered critical acclaim from publications like Forbes, Billboard, Hollywood Reporter, and NPR.\n\nMore Than Just a Tour: A Celebration of Rock\n\nThis co-headlining tour isn’t just about two bands – it’s about celebrating the power of hard rock. With HOLLYWOOD UNDEAD and FIT FOR A KING along for the ride, this summer promises a sonic adventure unlike any other.\n\nHALESTORM will also be partnering with mental health organization Sound Mind Live to encourage fans to pledge their support, providing free mental health programs across the country. So, mark your calendars, crank up the volume, and get ready to experience hard rock royalty live! Tickets are on sale now – don’t miss your chance to witness this epic collaboration and witness two legendary bands at the peak of their powers.\n\nHALESTORM + I PREVAIL ON TOUR:\n\nWITH HOLLYWOOD UNDEAD + FIT FOR A KING:"
