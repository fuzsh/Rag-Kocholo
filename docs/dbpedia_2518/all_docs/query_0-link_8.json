        "text": "(ALTERNATIVE TITLE: A SELF-INDULGENT APPRECIATION OF MALCOM MUFUNDE’S INCREDIBLE PRODUCTIVITY)\n\nOn June 1st last year, I released “Mukandikoka Ndinouya”, a collab with King Isaac. It’s such a dope, introspective song and I knew I had one, and thought to myself “at the turn of the year, I’ll drop a full album. We’ll do, say ten tracks! Mukandikoka Ndinouya will be the second single (after Hometown hero), and two other songs were recorded and waiting to go. The other six, well, between ideas I had for songs, and the fact that I’m always gonna supplement it with some poetry; ten will be just fine.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTCBX3eARL0\n\nIn fact, on July 25th (I remember, because it’s my birthday eve), I got back in the booth and did a song and two other verses; one a collaboration with a good vocalist friend (my song- to be on the album), and the other a song I was invited to be on with two of my favorite Zim rappers. It must have been the birthday vibes and/or the summer heat, but I felt I killed it.\n\nOn July 28, Malcolm Mufunde released the album, Ekhaya.\n\nIt was the latest in a series of rapid-fire albums that the award-winning spitter had put out since lockdown (sixth since 2021!) While all his works are quality, no doubt; Ekhaya may be my favorite. Or maybe it just found me at the right time. But I put that boy on repeat, and even wrote a review for the project (and if you know me; I only try and review projects I enjoy: and not say anything if I got nothing nice to say ;) )\n\nSo impressed that, after all that was done; I approached him about remixing one of the songs thereon that really stood out to me. I went back in the booth, did my thing. I liked that version so much that I spoke to Malcom and asked if I could put it on my album coming out at the turn of the year. He was too kind about it.\n\nOh, and the collab with the vocalist friend was fire. Got it back by the end of August (still needed to tweak one or two things and get it in the appropriate file.) I also heard back from the other folks I was collaborating with; it was sounding good, and they had big plans for it. The initial plan was to have it out by year-end. Because, thematically, it also fit perfectly, I asked if the song would have been released by then already, I could also put it on my album. They said cool. So, what’s that: five songs done and two, although not in hand per se, but are done. Seven songs. Two more, and then a poem to finish it? We’re well on our way to the album. I’ve been playing around with the concepts of “Memento Mori” and “Wherever you go, there you are” as potential album titles or themes. This should be fun!\n\nOn September 15, Malcolm Mufunde released the album, Treasure; a collaborative project with the GOATed Synik, and whose series predecessor “Trash” won him “Best Underground Artist” at the Zim Hip Hop Awards back in 2021.\n\nAt this point, the school year has started, and I’m all hands-on-deck with that; I wouldn’t get back into the studio until Thanksgiving (end of November.) Knocked out one song (very proud of this one), so one more and a poem, then we’re done.\n\nOn December 1st, Malcolm Mufunde released “Ekwedu,” A departure from some of his cerebral projects earlier, this was a more upbeat project-but fire still. I was pleasantly surprised to hear from the spitter himself that the song “Kuno” was inspired by “Mukandikoka Ndinouya”- kinda felt like I had made it haha.\n\nOn December 15, Malcolm Mufunde won “album of the year” for Treasure at the Zim Hip Hop Awards. Heck of a year.\n\nIt’s about that time on my end too. Having been rather busy/downcast all semester, I hadn’t done much prep. I had, however, asked my students to vote on what the album should be called. Shingi’s Afro-Depressive Rhythms and Poetry (SAD RAP Album) won that poll in a blow-out #PerksoftheJob. As for the two remaining tracks, well, one would just be an already-recorded poem and the last one, against type, would be a song of heartbreak; needed a vocalist. Lucky for me, a good friend (who actually introduced us to the studio and engineer) is an incredible one. I hit up the studio the week before Christmas or something, lay down my verses; he gets in, and he has brilliant ideas, but it’s not working- so he says he’d come back later. No press; he lives 5 minutes from the studio: me? Two hours haha. But since I was done, he could just come and do it himself.\n\nSo where am I? Ten track album: two singles already out; 4 completed songs in hand; two collabs that I was still waiting to get back in their final form, then this love joint that now looked like it would be only done in the new year. Getting nervous now; I had meant to drop one of the collabs that I still didn’t have as the single to start the new year; but you know what, I’ll put out another joint for now: thus the Big Shingi Bounce Remix came out, video and all.\n\nOh, and I’d also written a book, and the publisher had told me it would be out early February. Why; while I’m still gonna push to get all that other stuff, maybe the album delays are for good; I’ll just focus on the book now. Put the album on the back burner for, maybe the second half of March?\n\nOn Valentine’s Day, 2024, Malcom Mufunde dropped the album “Enhle”; a love-themed project that was both in keeping with the customary quality we’re used to and a departure from anything we’d ever heard from the artist.\n\nFor various reasons, I still haven’t received those two collabs; and the other vocalist has been busy with family and work, and the engineer is flooded too in this season; so we keep bumping up those dates. I’m a little frustrated by now, but you know, life a gwaan, and people are taking care of what they need to.\n\nOn April 5, 2024, Malcolm Mufunde dropped the polarizing “Controlla Made Me Do It”, a response to hostilities leveled against him by another rapper, R Peels. Polarizing not because its quality is debatable-never that. But polarizing in the same way that we were divided about Cole leaving the Big Three battle woes/ We wanted smoke, he wasn’t giving us any! And I recognize that this is not an album, but it happened- and it was a moment!\n\nA couple days later, the vocalist and the engineer finally got on the same page, and got in the studio. By Jove, he did it. I wasn’t sure how it would go, so I drove the two hours to be there anyway, and caught the end of it. It was class. And we had a bit more time, so he (an even more incredible instrumentalist than he is a vocalist, although still a great vocalist) and I ended up redoing the poem and putting some music to it, and one more for good measure.\n\nSo that’s it then; all the songs now recorded. Still need to mix and master those from that day, but this engineer is good for it. Two or three days tops. Sure, I still haven’t received the appropriate file for the one collaboration, and nothing from the collab with the two rappers. The former has been going through quite a bit, and the latter, well, it was never really my song, was it? Just glad to be featured, so I decided to let that go; they’ll do as they please with it.\n\nMaaan. How about the usually indomitable engineer comes down with a vile illness, and has barely been to work since mid April. It will be June in a week or so. A year after I made the call on when the album would be out; and 6 months after I expected it to be.\n\nAll this to say, on May 24, 2024, Malcolm Mufunde drops “Ekasi.” You heard me. His fifth album since July 28, 2023. And if my brief reviews here, and the literal awards for his work don’t tell you, let me reiterate: this ain’t Viper running up numbers; these are all quality projects, any of which would elevate many artists’ discographies.\n\nAs for me, well, maybe sometime in June. Or August. Maybe three Malcom albums from now. Oh, and I’ve since changed the name to “Brink of Delirium”- you can see why ;)"
