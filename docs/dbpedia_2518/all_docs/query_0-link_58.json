It will be updated daily with new materials daily while open, and the company teased that the library might include a few hints about what's to come on The Tortured Poets Department.\n\nRelated: Everything to Know About Taylor Swift's New Album, The Tortured Poets Department\n\nThe library will be on display at The Grove in Los Angeles from April 16-18, but for those Swifties who can't attend, fear not — Spotify notes that all the surprises and the album countdown will be available on Swift's album countdown page and music distributor's social channels.\n\nLess than a week out from the release of The Tortured Poets Department, Swift is kicking things into high gear.
