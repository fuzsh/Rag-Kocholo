        "text": "Pearl Jam released its 12th studio album Friday, and those who know me, know I like Pearl Jam. My 350-plus Pearl Jam CDs and the fact my first dog was named after one of the band's songs, Lukin, can attest to that. As I write this at 9:30 a.m. the morning of the release date, I've already listened to the new album, Dark Matter, three times. After a run of three straight OK albums, Dark Matter is Pearl Jam's top release in nearly two decades dating back to 2006's self-titled album, also known as Avacado. Where does it rank among my favorite band's dozen studio efforts? Here is my ranking of Pearl Jam albums, which I publish after every release.\n\n1. Yield (1998)\n\nIn short: The fifth release from Pearl Jam was the best, and that's saying a lot given how great the first four were. Yield, which had amazing booklet artwork, contained radio hits “Given To Fly,” “Wishlist” and “Do The Evolution,” but was much more than its singles. It’s great from start to finish, a diverse, fun, sonically and lyrically powerful 48-minute journey. The band released a documentary of the making of the album called Single Video Theory, which is a great behind-the-scenes watch.\n\nBiggest hit: Given to Fly— This song is one of three Pearl Jam singles to hit No. 1 on the mainstream rock charts. There are similarities to Led Zeppelin's \"Going to California.\"\n\nMy favorite track: Do The Evolution — This song marked the first music video released by the band since 1992 and was produced by comic book artist Todd McFarlane. Fun fact: Guitarist Stone Gossard, who wrote the song, also played bass on the track.\n\n2. Vs. (1993)\n\nIn short: A close second, Vs. is a powerhouse. Pearl Jam is a band on a mission. It scaled back all commercial efforts (limited interviews, no music videos) and delivered its heaviest album that's offset with some great acoustic work (\"Daughter,\" \"Small Town\"). It was less arena rock than its debut Tenbut more raw and powerful. It was lyrically outstanding and was the first full-band effort with four of the band's five members getting full writing credit on individual songs. Pearl Jam is at its best when everybody pitches in during the writing process. This album shows why.\n\nBiggest hit: Daughter— This is one of Pearl Jam's other No. 1 singles on the mainstream rock charts. Eddie Vedder has great talent in writing from a women's perspective. This is an example.\n\nMy favorite track: W.M.A.— It's amazing this song was written in 1992 given the lyrics resonate even stronger 30 years later as one of the most contentious issues in our country.\n\n3. Vitalogy (1994)\n\nIn short: This was Pearl Jam’s first attempt at getting weird with an accordion-driven song about bugs and the 8-minute rant “Hey Foxymophandlemama, That’s Me.” The album was uneven, unpredictable and excellent. It was an experiment gone right. There are mainstream successes like \"Betterman,\" \"Corduroy,\" \"Not For You\" and \"Immorality,\" which is one of my favorite songs to play. Eddie Vedder really took control of this album with six of the 13 real songs – Foxymophandlemama is not a real song – written by him.\n\nBiggest hit: Betterman— And this is the third No. 1 single from Pearl Jam on the mainstream rock charts. It's about an abusive relationship, although people still play it as weddings. Read the lyrics, my friends.\n\nMy favorite track: Corduroy— I was close to putting \"Nothingman\" or \"Immortality\" here, but \"Corduroy\" was an interesting look at Vedder clashing with his new-found fame and popularity.\n\n4. Ten (1991)\n\nIn short: Most rank this No. 1, and I have no issue with that. It's a nearly flawless album, but I've probably heard every song on here a few hundred times. This was Pearl Jam's debut, which made it one of rock’s biggest acts with Nirvana. Even non-Pearl Jam fans know half the songs on this album through radio airplay. Ten contains Pearl Jam's two most emotional songs (“Black\" and \"Release\"); its three most iconic songs (“Alive,” “Even Flow” and “Jeremy”); and its best live song (\"Porch\"). More than 30 yearsafter its release, Ten holds up as a classic. This is among the 10 best debut albums ever as Pearl Jam rose out of the ashes of Mother Love Band.\n\nBiggest hit: Even Flow— \"Jeremy\" had the more popular music video (again, Pearl Jam was way ahead of its time in highlighting social issues), but \"Even Flow\" peaked higher on the charts.\n\nMy favorite track: Release— The most heart-wrenching song in Pearl Jam's extensive category, Eddie Vedder sings about the pain of losing a father he didn't know he had (the man he thought was his father was his stepdad; his real dad died before they could connect). The band started playing the music and Vedder walked to a mic and poured out the lyrics.\n\n5. No Code (1996)\n\nIn short: This band’s fourth album divided hardcore fans from the fray. Pearl Jam’s stadium sound was gone, replaced with garage rock songs and experimental slower-tempo efforts. It wasn’t the commercial success of the first three Pearl Jam albums, but it is still terrific from start to finish. Some songs are so delicate and light and show a side of Pearl Jam not previously seen. It's a beautiful album, almost spiritual in nature, and is the one I still listen to the most, in part because it featured my favorite Pearl Jam drummer, Jack Irons, who also played on our No. 1 (Yield). The album is home to the only non-Eddie Vedder singing track in Pearl Jam's studio releases (Stone Gossard's \"Mankind,\" with Gossard being my favorite Pearl Jam member).\n\nBiggest hit: Who You Are— This song peaked higher in the mainstream rock charts (No. 5) than \"Hail, Hail\" (No. 9), although \"Hail, Hail\" is the better-known song.\n\nMy favorite track: Off He Goes— This acoustic diddy is about a friend who comes in and out of the protagonist's life, although I've always interpreted it as a man talking to his future self and not recognizing that person. Either way, great lyrics.\n\n6. Pearl Jam (2006)\n\nIn short: This is the dividing point. The first five albums on the list are all-time greats. They're Tier I. This is the start of Tier II, although Pearl Jam's self-titled album (nicknamed Avocado) is the band's most underrated effort. This might not be Tier I, but it is legitimately excellent. There isn't a bad song on this 13-track offering, which can't even be said about Yield (\"Pilate\"), Vs. (\"Glorified G\") or Vitalogy (\"Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me\"). It's appropriately self-titled because it's almost as if Pearl Jam wanted to prove it still had the goods. And, yes, it did.\n\nBiggest hit: World Wide Suicide— An anti-war rocker, the lyrics depict an anti-Iraq war message and sorrow for losing soldiers with little fanfare or appreciation for their sacrifice.\n\nMy favorite track: Come Back— There are a lot of guts to this song, which is about being consumed by grief over losing a loved one. It's one of Pearl Jam's most emotional offerings.\n\n7. Binaural (2000)\n\nIn short: The band took a huge departure for this album, its sixth, going from rock songs to atmospheric efforts. The album production was not my favorite. If you cut through some of those issues, the core of this album is strong. Oddly, some of the session’s best songs (\"Sad,\" \"Fatal,\" \"In the Moonlight\") didn’t make the album’s final cut but were later released on Lost Dogs (an awesome double album). If the production was right and the correct songs were picked, this album would move up a couple of spots. Still, I appreciate this album more as time passes. It's more of a grower than a shower. It takes time to appreciate\n\nBiggest hit: Nothing As It Seems — This album didn't have any true hits, although \"Nothing as It Seems\" is one Pearl Jam's most complex songs. Lead guitarist Mike McCready kills it on this one.\n\nMy favorite track: Insignificance — Boeing executives should avoid this song, which fires at you the same way one of that company's planes drops war-time bombs.\n\n8. Dark Matter (2024)\n\nIn short: With new producer and Pearl Jam superfan Andrew Watt working with the band, Pearl Jam is free and easy in this recording. Unlike previous albums, band members didn't come in with nearly finished demos. It was more collaborative, and Pearl Jam is at its best when everybody has a say. I tend to like Pearl Jam rockers, and those are available on four tracks (\"Scared of Fear,\"\"React, Respond,\"\"Dark Matter,\"\"Running\"), but the mid-tempo songs are much improved from Gigaton, Backspacer andLightning Bolt.\"Waiting for Stevie\" feels like it was written by the band in the early 1990s, and\"Something Special\" lives up to its name. Eddie Vedder's lyrics are quite dark, adding to the power this album has the previous three lacked.\n\nBiggest hit: Dark Matter — This album hasn't gotten much of any radio traction, but the title track and first single, Dark Matter, is a great shifting tempo banger.\n\nMy favorite track: Something Special — Eddie Vedder's love song to his daughters is campy in some sections but truly touching given the more love-broke message on the rest of the album. It's in the same lullaby vein as No Code's \"Around the Bend.\"\n\n9. Gigaton (2020)\n\nIn short: Fans waited seven years for this release, the longest between Pearl Jam offerings. It was a better effort than the previous two releases (Backspacer and Lightning Bolt). The first seven songs are elite before things tail off after that, which has been a trend in recent albums. That gives this recording the feeling of a half-album.But after the seven-year wait, I remember thinking it was damn impressive that a bunch of rockers in their mid-50s could still crank out songs this good. It was a nice blend of personal and political messages wrapped up in hard-rock exploration.\n\nBiggest hit: Superblood Wolfmoon— This is strong little rock tune and shows how amazing and underrated lead guitarist Mike McCready is.\n\nMy favorite track: Dance of the Clairvoyants— This is a Pearl Jam song unlike any other and would fit in during 1980's Talking Heads with its funky beat. It's one of the band's best releases this century. This song was a risk worth taking.\n\n10. Riot Act (2002)\n\nIn short: I got this album by digging through boxes at Walmart at midnight of the release date since they hadn't been put on the shelves yet. And the first time I heard the album, I thought, \"Does Eddie Vedder even care anymore?\" He mumbled his way through this effort, holding back the album as the band tried to move forward after nine fans were crushed and killed and 26 more injured during a rain-soaked show at Denmark's Roskilde Festival. The incident almost led to the band retiring. The album has some great songs, but it feels as if the band's hearts were not completely in this one after the incident in Europe, which is understandable.\n\nBiggest hit: I Am Mine— The song contains one of my favorite Pearl Jam lyrics: “I know I was born and I know that I’ll die; the in between is mine.”\n\nMy favorite track: Save You— This song is a straight-forwarded rocker about watching a close friend waste away his or her life away due to drug addiction.\n\n11. Backspacer (2009)\n\nIn short: The first Pearl Jam record to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard charts since 1996, Backspacer was another solid effort on the heels of the self-titled Pearl Jam album. There’s a lot to like on Backspacer, an album in which the band is having fun (which didn’t seem the case in the early 2000s). At 36 minutes, 38 seconds, it's the shortest album in Pearl Jam's catalog and there's some filler in there. There isn't as much meat on the bone of this one as others on this list, but it's still good.\n\nBiggest hit: The Fixer— This song peaked at No. 10 in the charts, which was the lowest-ranked top-rated single for a Pearl Jam album before Gigaton. Still, it's a great rocker, and a song of optimism, which can be rare in Pearl Jam's collection.\n\nMy favorite track: Just Breathe— Eddie Vedder and an acoustic guitar can be a great combination. Now, this is the song you should play as a first dance at a wedding rather than Betterman.\n\n12. Lightning Bolt (2013)\n\nIn short: There was a lot of \"Pearl Jam is back!\" talk after this release, but I thought it was so-so. The first seven songs are dynamic before a sleepy back half. Ultimately, Pearl Jam should be proud it is the last of the grunge-era bands still around and putting out meaningful music considering how many great 1990s Seattle bands had an abrupt ended due to the deaths of their lead singers (Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, Mother Love Bone). Was Lightning Bolt great? No. But Pearl Jam has been pumping out excellent music for more than three decades, and I'm thankful for that.\n\nBiggest hit: Mind Your Manners— This song peaked at No. 2 on the mainstream rock charts, just edging \"Sirens,\" which went as high as No. 5.\n\nMy favorite track: Sirens — A Pink Floyd-inspired song, \"Sirens\" balances the mortality of man and worries about future generations. Life is fragile."
