        "text": "PEARL JAM’s upcoming twelfth studio album, “Dark Matter,” is set to hit shelves on April 19, 2024, courtesy of Monkeywrench Records/Republic Records\n\nYou can already stream the title track below.\n\nGuided by Grammy Award-winning producer Andrew Watt, “Dark Matter” marks PEARL JAM‘s first release since 2020’s “Gigaton.”\n\nIn 2023, PEARL JAM convened at Shangri-La Studios in Malibu, immersing themselves in an intensive writing and recording process overseen by Watt. The album came to life in a mere three weeks, capturing the collective energy of lifelong creative companions playing as if their very existence depended on it.\n\nThe album’s visual presentation boasts light painting art by Alexandr Gnezdilov. Crafting the album cover involved a unique approach using a large, self-made kaleidoscope. Each letter was meticulously captured and handwritten mid-air with a specially designed flashlight to achieve the mesmerizing pearlescent effect.\n\nIn celebration of indie record stores, PEARL JAM will release a special edition of “Dark Matter” on April 20, exclusively at participating stores as part of Record Store Day. More information and store locations can be found at www.recordstoreday.com.\n\nAccording to reports, PEARL JAM hosted a listening party for “Dark Matter” in late January at West Hollywood’s Troubadour. During the event, frontman Eddie Vedder expressed his belief that the album represents the band’s finest work.\n\n2020 marked three decades of PEARL JAM‘s live performances. With eleven studio albums, numerous live shows, and official concert bootleg releases, the band has sustained both critical acclaim and commercial success, boasting over 85 million albums sold worldwide. PEARL JAM was inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame in 2017.\n\nTheir previous album, “Gigaton,” released in March 2020, soared to the top of Billboard’s charts, featuring beloved tracks like “Dance Of The Clairvoyants,” “Superblood Wolfmoon,” and “Quick Escape.” It debuted at No. 1 on multiple Billboard charts and garnered over 200 million global streams, earning critical praise for its blend of new influences and the band’s trademark rock prowess.\n\nPEARL JAM “Dark Matter” track listing:\n\n01. Scared Of Fear\n\n02. React, Respond\n\n03. Wreckage\n\n04. Dark Matter\n\n05. Won’t Tell\n\n06. Upper Hand\n\n07. Waiting For Stevie\n\n08. Running\n\n09. Something Special\n\n10. Got To Give\n\n11. Setting Sun\n\nFormed in 1990, PEARL JAM consists of members Eddie Vedder (vocals), Mike McCready (guitar), Stone Gossard (guitar), Jeff Ament (bass), and Matt Cameron (drums).\n\nThe band rose to prominence with their debut album, “Ten,” released in 1991. Fueled by hits like “Alive,” “Even Flow,” and “Jeremy,” the album became one of the defining records of the grunge era and catapulted PEARL JAM to international fame.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, PEARL JAM continued to release critically acclaimed albums such as “Vs.” (1993), “Vitalogy” (1994), and “No Code” (1996), solidifying their status as one of the most influential rock bands of the decade. Known for their raw energy, socially conscious lyrics, and dynamic live performances, PEARL JAM became synonymous with the grunge movement and garnered a dedicated fanbase worldwide.\n\nIn the early 2000s, they continued to evolve their sound, incorporating elements of garage rock, punk, and folk into their music. Albums like “Binaural” (2000), “Riot Act” (2002), and “Pearl Jam” (2006) showcased the band’s musical versatility and continued relevance in the ever-changing landscape of rock music.\n\nOver the years, the group has maintained a prolific output, releasing a series of well-received albums including “Backspacer” (2009), “Lightning Bolt” (2013), and “Gigaton” (2020). Their music has consistently resonated with audiences, earning them critical acclaim and commercial success.\n\nBeyond their musical achievements, PEARL JAM has also been known for their activism and philanthropy, supporting various social and environmental causes throughout their career.\n\nWith a career spanning over three decades, the band remains one of the most enduring and influential rock bands of all time, leaving an indelible mark on the music industry and inspiring generations of fans around the world."
