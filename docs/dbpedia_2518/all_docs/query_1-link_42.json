        "text": "Long before Jack Harlow was one of rap's buzziest stars, he was making music for his middle-school classmates. Even at just age 12, he knew the art of collaboration, teaming up with a friend to create his first album, and later creating a rap collective with other pals. Fast forward 13 years later, and he's teaming up with some of the biggest stars in the industry.\n\nHarlow has counted several superstars as collaborators since signing with Atlantic Records in 2018; just the track list of his second album, 2022's Come Home the Kids Miss You, featured the likes of Drake, Lil Wayne, Justin Timberlake, and Pharrell Williams. So when Harlow surprised fans with the announcement of his third studio album, Jackman, just days before its April 28 release, it was easy to assume he'd deliver more star-studded tracks.\n\nBut upon the album's arrival, there was not a collaboration to be found. Based on Harlow opting to use his birth name as the title of his latest release, it's not all that surprising that he opted to take the no-features route this time around — and even without collaborators, he sounds more confident than ever.\n\nAlthough Jackman didn't add to Harlow's reputable lineup of guest stars, he has quite the roster already, whether from his own projects or featuring on another artist's track. To celebrate Harlow's new music, GRAMMY.com revisits some of his most memorable collaborations so far.\n\nDaBaby, Tory Lanez, and Lil Wayne — \"Whats Poppin\" (Remix)\n\nHarlow released six mixtapes and two EPs in the many years leading up to his breakthrough hit \"Whats Poppin,\" the lead single off his debut studio album, 2020's Thats What They All Say. Though \"Whats Poppin\" certainly isn't the only of Harlow's raps to reflect on the joys of being rich and famous, his hard-hitting delivery on the new remix verse is a standout among the rest.\n\nAnd with the help of DaBaby and Tory Lanez on the remix as well, the song reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 — an impressive feat for his first-ever entry on the chart. Not only did the song's commercial success put him on the map, but it nabbed Harlow his first GRAMMY nomination in 2021, for Best Rap Performance.\n\nDrake — \"Churchill Downs\"\n\nNamed after Louisville's iconic racetrack, \"Churchill Downs\" is a heartfelt ode to Harlow's hometown; the music video was even filmed at the 2022 Kentucky Derby. Backed by a flute-driven beat, the standout track off Harlow's sophomore album, Come Home the Kids Miss You, is a perfect embodiment of his humble beginnings: \"All that time in the kitchen finally panned out/ I put some flavor in a pot and took the bland out/ I know my grandpa would have a heart attack if I pulled a hunnid grand out,\" he raps.\n\nMeanwhile, Drake's guest verse — which calls out the pitfalls of fame — is considered one of his best in recent years, likely due to the level of vulnerability the Canadian rapper is showing nearly two decades into his career.\n\nThe rags-to-riches tale resonated with fans and critics alike: \"Churchill Downs\" cracked the top 10 of Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and earned the pair a GRAMMY nomination for Best Rap Song in 2022.\n\nLil Nas X — \"Industry Baby\"\n\nLil Nas X recruited Harlow for his multi-platinum single \"Industry Baby,\" a pulsing track laden with triumphant horns and braggadocious lyrics. Accompanied by a provocative music video where both rappers break out of prison while donning bright pink jumpsuits, the song strategically followed Lil Nas X's legal battle with Nike. But the Kentucky rapper's verse arguably steals the show with brow-raising bars, including \"I sent her back to her boyfriend with my handprint on her a— cheek.\"\n\nThe boisterous tune helped Harlow earn his first of two No. 1s on the Hot 100; his second came in 2022 with his solo track \"First Class.\"\n\nSaweetie — \"Tap In\" (Remix)\n\nHarlow was one of three rap stars Saweetie recruited for the remix of her Too Short-sampling single \"Tap In,\" which also featured Post Malone and DaBaby.\n\nWhile the SoCal rapper isn't shy about flaunting her physical attributes (\"Lil' waist, fat a—\") and being able to \"bag a eight-figure n—,\" Harlow just seems happy to be there. \"I just crossed over to Top 40/ I can't even say 'Whats poppin?' now 'cause it got corny,\" he spits before telling listeners that his verse for Saweetie got him \"horny.\"\n\nBig Sean — \"Way Out\"\n\nA solid single choice following \"Whats Poppin\" and \"Tyler Herro,\" Harlow and Big Sean's \"Way Out\" is as straightforward and braggadocious as it is club-ready. Just under three minutes in length, Sean's guest verse does not disappoint — it's packed with punchlines, such as \"I'm anointed, I'm the boss/ I done came out of pocket so much/ You thought that I was disjointed.\"\n\nLil Wayne — \"Poison\"\n\nLil Wayne was no stranger to AutoTune before teaming up with Harlow, but some critics disapproved of his use of it on \"Poison,\" a track from Come Home the Kids Miss You. Even so, his rhyme about stealing someone's girl is pretty iconic: \"I might have to jack your b— 'cause I be on my Harlow sh—.\"\n\nDespite what critics have to say, clearly Wayne enjoys working with Harlow — \"Poison\" marked their third collab, following the \"Whats Poppin\" remix and 2020 single \"P— Talk\" alongside City Girls and Quavo.\n\nPharrell Williams — \"Movie Star\"\n\nOn \"Movie Star,\" Harlow ditches his humble persona to rap about enjoying the perks of his then-newfound superstardom: money, women, and designer clothes. \"Can't imagine being you, ooh, I'd hate to be it / I'm done fakin' humble, actin' like I ain't conceited / 'Cause, b—, I am conceited,\" he declares on the track produced by the legendary Pharrell Williams, a true indicator that an artist has made it in the music industry.\n\nAfter Williams adds some of his flair to the chorus, both stars trade off rhymes in the song's final verse. \"But do it jiggle though?\" Williams asks. Harlow's response? \"I feel like the whole damn city know.\"\n\nJustin Timberlake — \"Parent Trap\"\n\nThe dark side of fame theme resurfaces in \"Parent Trap,\" a collaboration with Justin Timberlake, who lends his signature southern drawl to the chorus. \"Every sky can't be blue/ It's hard to see when you're walkin' in the grey/ So many flights, look at how the time flew,\" he sings.\n\nThough it may not quite measure up to Harlow's top-tier duet with Drake on \"Churchill Downs,\" which tackles similar subject matter, the collab is a fitting one — Harlow referenced NSYNC in \"Tyler Herro\" just two years prior.\n\nEminem and Cordae — \"Killer\" (Remix)\n\nIn late 2020, Harlow told GQ that he \"grew up listening to Eminem\" and idolized him, so it must have been surreal and full-circle when he got to join forces with the 15-time GRAMMY-winning rapper a mere six months later.\n\nRising to the challenge, Harlow holds his own alongside Em and then-fellow newcomer Cordae, demonstrating strong lyrical wordplay — particularly with lines like \"I'm eatin' pizza in Little Italy, damn, I used to hit Caesars.\"\n\nEven alongside his biggest heroes, Harlow has proven his natural ability to command attention — and though it's just him on the mic on Jackman, he seems poised and ready to see who's next.\n\nReImagined: LAVI$H Offers A Soul-Stirring Performance Of Ed Sheeran's \"The A Team\"\n\nAnother month has passed us by, and August brings us closer to the end of the season. However, several new tracks and albums have dropped to lift our spirits. With brand new projects like Khalid's Sincere, Maren Morris' Intermission, and 49 Winchester's Leavin' This Holler, the beginning of August promises bright things ahead.\n\nA slew of singles dropped, too, from exciting collaborations like Charli XCX's \"Guess\" remix with Billie Eilish and Jessie Murph's new track with Teddy Swims to new offerings from Big Sean, Jhené Aiko, Jelly Roll, Suki Waterhouse, and more. Whether you're looking for full projects or a few new playlist additions, you will not be disappointed.\n\nAs you prepare to close out summer, be sure to check out these 10 new songs and albums.\n\nCharli XCX & Billie Eilish — \"Guess\"\n\nJust 24 hours after Charli XCX set the internet ablaze with a tease of her next collaboration, she not only unveiled the special guest, but she also dropped the track as a New Music Friday-eve gift: a remix of \"Guess\" with her fellow pop queen, Billie Eilish.\n\nThe pulsating song keeps the same club-ready aesthetic of the original from Charli XCX's brat, but taps into the sexual fluidity of Eilish's HIT ME HARD AND SOFT with the \"LUNCH\" singer adding a new verse (fans particularly went into a frenzy over Eilish's line \"Charli likes boys but she knows I'd hit it\"). The track offers a raunchy brand of girl power, further emphasized by the underwear-strewn video, as the unworn undergarments will be donated to survivors of domestic violence through I Support the Girls.\n\nKacey Musgraves — 'Deeper into the Well'\n\nSeven-time GRAMMY-winner Kacey Musgraves is expanding the well she first introduced in March. With the release of Deeper Well, Musgraves showcased a softer side of herself that she discovered during periods of self-introspection following significant changes in her life.\n\nNow, with Deeper into the Well, she takes us further along on her journey. Musgraves gave a taste of the additional seven songs with the release of her single \"Irish Goodbye,\" which narrates the tale of someone struggling to find forgiveness for someone who abruptly left. The extended edition also includes two new features, \"Perfection\" with Tiny Habits and \"Superbloom\" with Leon Bridges.\n\nThe release comes one month before Musgraves is set to kick off her Deeper Well World Tour in Pennsylvania; she'll hit cities on both coasts, and conclude in Nashville in December.\n\nRead More: For The Record: Why Kacey Musgraves' Timeless Album Golden Hour Still Shines 5 Years Later\n\nSaweetie — \"My Best\"\n\nMaintaining her message of confidence and self-worth, Saweetie releases \"My Best,\" an unapologetic anthem that emphasizes knowing your worth and surrounding yourself with people who prioritize your best interests.\n\nThe music video visually represents Saweetie's personal growth, both as an individual and as an artist. Shot at hometown landmarks like her high school and childhood neighborhood, she invites fans on a nostalgic journey of introspection — while also reminding them to stay true to themselves.\n\nLearn More: Meet The First-Time GRAMMY Nominee: Saweetie On Her Long-Awaited Album Pretty B^^^^ Music & Why Women Rappers \"No Longer Need A Co-Sign\"\n\nTones and I — 'Beautifully Ordinary'\n\nFour years after her smash \"Dance Monkey\" took over the world, Tones and I releases her second studio album, Beautifully Ordinary. The follow-up to 2021's Welcome to the Madhouse, the 16-song project reflects the artist's growth, exploring themes of nostalgia, love, and self-acceptance. Each song invites listeners to embark on an emotional, personal journey with Tones and I, offering a source of catharsis for those who relate to her experiences.\n\nTones and I first gave listeners a taste of the project in June with lead single \"Dance With Me,\" a track that delves into themes of heartbreak and desperation. Despite its underlying message of loneliness, the track retains Tones and I's signature upbeat rhythms and vibrant instrumentals — and the rest of Beautifully Ordinary follows suit, offering intimate and heartfelt narratives through her radiant musicality.\n\nSam Smith — 'In The Lonely Hour (10th Anniversary Edition)'\n\nCelebrating the six-times-platinum debut album that catapulted them to stardom, Sam Smith is releasing the 10th anniversary edition of In The Lonely Hour. This special edition features a reimagined version of their classic \"Stay With Me,\" and a brand new track, \"Little Sailor.\"\n\nThe original project launched Smith's career into the stratosphere, receiving critical acclaim and earning them four golden gramophones at the 2015 GRAMMYs, including Best New Artist.\n\n\"I feel so incredibly lucky to be celebrating this milestone with you,\" Smith wrote on Instagram. \"My team and I have created this beautiful anniversary edition for us all, and for the last 10 years.\"\n\nLearn More: 9 Times Queer Artists Made History At The GRAMMYs: From Elton John's Collab With BSB To Kim & Sam's \"Unholy\" Union\n\nKiller Mike — 'Michael & The Mighty Midnight Revival, Songs For Sinners & Saints'\n\nFresh off going three-for-three at the 2024 GRAMMYs, Killer Mike delivers another potent project, Michael & The Mighty Midnight Revival, Songs For Sinners & Saints. A follow-up to his autobiographical album 'MICHAEL', the 10-song collection dives deeper into his personal narrative, offering an epilogue filled with introspection and celebration — including the poignant track \"HUMBLE ME,\" which reflects on his arrest after winning his GRAMMYs in February.\n\nKiller Mike provided fans with a gift, releasing the album as a free download for the first 48 hours. In support of the release, Killer Mike electrified audiences with six performances over three nights at the legendary Blue Note jazz club in NYC, including a live-streamed show that attracted nearly 100,000 viewers. This project is a testament to Killer Mike's ongoing dialogue with his audience, addressing both tribulations and triumphs. As the tour continues with a stop at Lollapalooza just one day after the album's release, fans can engage further with tracks like \"NOBODY KNOWS\" and \"HIGHER LEVEL,\" which offer a glimpse into the rapper’s evolving journey and continued impact on hip-hop.\n\nTiera Kennedy — \"Cry\"\n\nStill riding high from her vocals featured on Beyoncé's COWBOY CARTER, country star Tiera Kennedy releases her latest single, \"Cry,\" which samples Justin Timberlake's 2002 Timbaland-produced hit \"Cry Me A River.\" It's another taste of Kennedy's forthcoming debut album, which she dubs \"R&B/country.\"\n\n\"I've been really inspired by the music I grew up listening to,\" Kennedy shared in an Instagram video. \"Timbaland had a hand in a lot of those songs.\"\n\nKnown for her distinctive approach to blending genres, Kennedy invites listeners to immerse themselves in her world of creative storytelling with her latest track. \"Cry\" explores the narrative of someone who has made their bed and has to lie in it, while Kennedy has already moved on.\n\nExplore More: A Brief History Of Black Country Music: 11 Important Tracks From DeFord Bailey, Kane Brown & More\n\nGryffin — 'PULSE'\n\nReturning with his third studio album, electronic artist Gryffin embarks on a new era and unveils a fresh side of his artistry with PULSE. The 14-track album features collaborations with a range of artists, including Rita Ora, Disco Lines, MAX, and more.\n\n\"PULSE is a return to why I fell in love with dance music in the first place, and this is the most creatively inspired I've felt in years,\" said Gryffin on Instagram. \"I can't wait for you all to hear the new sound and feel the passion I've put into these tracks.\"\n\nJohn K — \"Lost\"\n\nAfter more than a year of not releasing music, John K is back with a new single, \"Lost.\" It's a song that vulnerably reveals feelings of completeness after finding the right person — a fitting narrative for the happily married singer, who is expecting his second child with his wife, Lenée. . Becoming a father is one of the several major life changes John K has experienced in the past few years, all of which have shaped his upcoming music and brought his musical artistry to the next stage.\n\n\"I was writing with the aim of challenging myself to do something I hadn't done before,\" John K said in a press statement. \"I shattered the box of what I thought I had to be, and it allowed me to get to deeper levels of honesty and really gain even more confidence. I took risks, and I honestly expressed myself.\n\nJack White — 'No Name'\n\nAfter releasing two albums within four months in 2022, Jack White has essentially gone silent since — until now. Just two days after announcing his sixth studio album, No Name, the rock icon unveils his latest masterpiece.\n\nThe 13-track album stays true to White's DIY philosophy, with the recording, production, and mixing all handled by the artist himself at his own Third Man Studio. Even before the album dropped on Aug. 2, reviews were already glowing, with Variety calling it the album \"fans have been lusting for\" due to its parallels to the rip-roaring rock of his former band the White Stripes — but \"without seeming retro or leaning too heavily on nostalgia.\"\n\nExplore More: Songbook: A Guide To Jack White's Musical Outlets, From The White Stripes To The Dead Weather & Beyond\n\nBootsy Collins — \"Pure Perfection\"\n\nAhead of his forthcoming album, Album of the Year #1 Funkateer, Bootsy Collins has released \"Pure Perfection,\" a smooth, sultry track featuring German rapper FANTAAZMA and rapper Giz. The track also features one of the funk icon's legendary alter-egos, \"Bedroom Bootsy,\" who brings a sultry tone to the tune.\n\nDue Oct. 25 (the day before Collins' 73rd birthday), Album of the Year #1 Funkateer includes an 18-song track list with contributions from Snoop Dogg, Wiz Khalifa and more.

Perry wrote the track alongside songwriter Chloe Angelides and producers Dr. Luke, Vaughn Oliver, Rocco Did It Again!, and Aaron Joseph.\n\nInitially teasing the track through social media, the song drew attention from pop fans globally.

When it comes from the heart, it's never a mistake.\"\n\n7 is set to captivate both loyal fans and new listeners. Centered around the vibrant theme of community, Furtado felt an irresistible pull toward creating new music, inspired by the diverse communities around her.

Co-produced with GRAMMY-nominated Leon Michels of El Michels Affair, this enchanting project underscores a striking blend of musical artistry and innovation.\n\n\"I want afterglowing, and when I call a car / Send me eyes with the knowing that I could pull it off,\" she sings in \"Sexy To Someone,\" the lead single from the album. Putting introspective lyricism at the forefront of all her projects without sacrificing quality instrumentals, this album is no exception.\n\nAlesso & Nate Smith — \"I Like It\"\n\nIn this genre-crossing collaboration, electronic artist Alesso joins forces with country singer Nate Smith on their new single, \"I Like It.\" Though an unexpected blend of styles, the song blends elements from both artists' sounds, seamlessly combining country and dance as they proudly declare, they \"like it like that.\"\n\nWith Alesso's electrifying instrumentals perfectly complementing Smith's spirited country vocals, the track captures the essence of summer in a song and is set to make waves throughout the season.\n\nOne OK Rock — \"Delusion:All\"\n\nFeatured as the official theme song for the upcoming movie \"Kingdom IV: Return of the Great General\", Japanese rock band One Ok Rock releases \"Delusion:All.\" The upbeat, cinematic track is the band's latest contribution to the \"Kingdom\" movie soundtrack series, following their 2019 song \"Wasted Nights.\"\n\n\"It's been a while since we wrote 'Wasted Nights' for the first series of 'Kingdom,' and we are very honored to be a part of the movie again,\" said vocalist Taka in a press statement. \"We tried to reflect \"the various conflicts going on in the world today and the modern society\" in the song, while making it blend into the worldview of 'Kingdom.'\"\n\nCat Burns — 'early twenties'\n\nA love letter to her community and a deep dive into the intricacies of adulthood, Cat Burns presents her debut album, Early Twenties. Accompanying the album is a captivating short film directed by Libby Burke Wilde. The film tells the individual narratives of each character, touching on themes of mental health, relationships, and personal identity, mirroring the album's essence.\n\nWith this well-rounded creative project, Burns showcases her full artistic prowess, making these releases a testament to her pioneering creative vision.\n\nUncle Kracker — 'Coffee & Beer'\n\nMaking a triumphant return to music after 12 years, Uncle Kracker breaks down the boundaries between genres once again with his latest album, Coffee & Beer. The 13-track album intertwines country, pop, and rock, offering a musical journey that ranges from high-spirited anthems to laid-back, mellow tracks.\n\n\"I wanted to give my fans a soundtrack to summer and what's better than the balance of first coffee…then beer? Coffee & Beer is going to be a fun one. Cheers,\" Uncle Kracker said in a press statement.\n\nMeridian Brothers — 'Mi Latinoamérica Sufre'\n\nDrawing inspiration from the golden era of '70s Congolese rumba, Ghanaian highlife, and Nigerian afrobeat, the Meridian Brothers unveil Mi Latinoamérica Sufre. This concept album integrates the electric guitar into tropical Latin music in an innovative fashion. The album showcases a dynamic tapestry of sounds, blending cumbia, champeta, soukous, Brazilian tropicalia, and psychedelic rock, making it an exciting sonic journey.\n\nLatest News & Exclusive Videos\n\nWe’ve been feeling the heat for a minute now, but summer is finally, officially, upon us.\n\nWhat do you have on deck to soundtrack it? Perhaps you’re checking out Camila Cabello’s fourth offering, C,XOXO. Or Jxdn’s expectations-bucking new album, When the Music Stops. And there are so many other worthy candidates for your playlist — from Lupe Fiasco’s Samurai to Omar Apollo’s God Said No.\n\nNo matter where your stylistic compass points, this Friday release day has got something for you. As you gather your sunscreen and shades, let’s breeze through a cross-section of what’s out there.\n\nLISA — \"Rockstar\"\n\nK-pop loves its solo releases, showcasing how the various members of a group can shine individually while combining with ecstatic chemistry. Enter LISA, one-fourth of Korean titans BLACKPINK, who's already turned heads with her 2021 debut album, Lalisa.\n\n\"Rockstar\" is another swing outside her main gig, featuring serrated chiptune production and LISA's commanding rap flow. The gritty, urban, futuristic video is a visual treat, and the chorus's boast of \"Lisa, can you teach me Japanese?\" is a multilingual flex — as well as a maddeningly unshakeable earworm.\n\nKelsea Ballerini & Noah Kahan — \"Cowboys Cry Too\"\n\nThe \"Peter Pan\" heavyweight and four-time GRAMMY nominee Kelsea Ballerini has called 2024 \"a new chapter of music.\" Her collaboration with folk/pop singer/songwriter Noah Kahan, \"Cowboys Cry Too,\" is the tip of the spear.\n\nMore than a month after the pair performed together at the 2024 Academy of Country Music Awards, their first recorded team-up is an aching, yearning ballad about breaking down a gruff exterior and revealing true emotions.\n\n\"Cowboys cry too/ They may not let 'em fall down in their hometown thinkin' they still got s*** to prove,\" Ballerini sings in the chorus. \"That well runs deep/ But when he's showin' his skin, lettin' mе in, that's when he's toughest to mе.\"\n\nLil Nas X — \"Here We Go!\" (from the Netflix film 'Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F')\n\n\"So excited to release the best song of all time this friday!,\" Lil Nas X proclaimed on Instagram. (And on a Beverly Hills Cop soundtrack, no less!)\n\n\"Here We Go!\" comes at an inflection point for the \"J Christ\" singer: \"sorry I've been so scared with my art lately,\" he added in the same post. \"I'm coming around to myself again. I will make you guys very proud.\"\n\nThis pro forma banger certainly inspires pride: tenacious lines like \"I'm livin' and livin' I wanna die/ They tryna get even/ I'm beatin' the odds\" will get under your skin. As for Beverly Hill Cop: Axel F, the Eddie Murphy joint will whiz to your screen July 3 via Netflix.\n\nLucky Daye — 'Algorithm'\n\nLucky Daye picked up a win for Best Progressive Album at the 2022 GRAMMYs, for Table for Two. After a slew of nominations for work with Beyoncé and Mary J. Blige, he's investigating the Algorithm.\n\nThe single \"HERicane\" was just a teaser, with songs like \"Blame,\" featuring Teddy Swims; \"Paralyzed,\" featuring RAYE;\" and \"Diamonds in Teal\" expanding on and honing his soul-funk-R&B vision.\n\n\"Don't know pickin' sides/ 'Cause I'm rollin' in desire,\" he dreamily sings in the gently roiling \"Diamonds in Teal.\" \"I don't know which lie's true/ Or maybe I do, or maybe I'm you.\" It's a suitable mission statement wrapped in a stealthily seductive package.\n\nHiatus Kaiyote — 'Love Heart Cheat Code'\n\nA jazzy, soulful, psychedelic band of Aussies, Hiatus Kaiyote has been wowing audiences for more than a decade. Whether through sampling or features, they've crossed paths with Drake, Anderson .Paak, and Beyoncé and Jay-Z.\n\nLove Heart Cheat Code builds brilliantly on their last three albums: their 2012 debut Tawk Tomahawk, 2015's Choose Your Weapon, and 2021's Mood Valiant. Tracks like \"Telescope,\" \"Everything's Beautiful,\" and \"Make Friends\" are burbling brooks of atmosphere, groove and vibe.\n\nBoulevards — 'Carolina Funk: Barn Burner on Tobacco Road'\n\nAny fans of deep, pungent funk grooves should investigate Boulevards immediately. The project of mastermind Jamil Rashad, their new album Carolina Funk: Barn Burner on Tobacco Road tips its hat to yesterday's funk with a contemporary twist, bringing a refreshing spin on the well-trod template of syncopated basslines and stabbing horns.\n\nAcross highlights like \"Do It Like a Maniac Part 1&2\" and \"Run & Move,\" Boulevards shows — once again — that few can nail this gritty sound quite like Rashad and crew.\n\nHeadie One — 'The Last One'\n\nBritish drill-inflected MC Headie One first made a splash overseas with his 2023 debut album, Strength to Strength. Less than a year later, he's returning with The Last One.\n\nBack in 2022, he hinted at the existence of his sophomore album in his non-album track \"50s\" — \"The fans calling for 'Martin's Sofa'/ It might be the first single from my second,\" he rapped.\n\nHelmed by that single, The Last One features Potter Payper, Stormzy, Fridayy, Skrillex, and more. The album is a leap forward in terms of production, scale and exploration.\n\nKatlin Butts — 'Roadrunner!'\n\nAny theater kid worth their salt knows at least a few bars from the musical \"Oklahoma!\"; country sensation Kaitlyn Butts has just unfolded it into an entire album.\n\n\"It's a love story but there's also a murder and a little bit of an acid-trippy feel to it at times; it's set in the same place where I come from,\" she said in a statement, noting she saw \"Oklahoma!\" with her parents every summer during childhood. \"Once I got the idea for this album,\" she continued, \"I couldn't believe I hadn't thought of it before, and it turned into something that completely encompasses who I am and what I love.\"\n\nA laugh riot as well as a colorful, openhearted statement, Roadrunner! does the old Rodgers and Hammerstein chestnut good.\n\nRead more: 5 Female Artists Creating The Future Of Country Music: Jaime Wyatt, Miko Marks & More\n\nAmaarae — 'roses are red, tears are blue — Fountain Baby Extended Play'\n\nFuturist Afropopper Amaarae made a gigantic splash with her second album, 2023's Fountain Baby — even Pitchfork gave it their coveted Best New Music designation.\n\nThat lush, enveloping album just got an expansion pack: roses are red, tears are blue — A Fountain Baby Extended Play is a continuation of its predecessor with six new songs. The oceanic \"wanted,\" featuring Naomi Sharon, is a highlight, as is a remix of \"Disguise\" with 6LACK.\n\n\"Ooh, I'll be wanted/ I've been wanted,\" a pitch-shifted Sharon sings near the end, as if turning over the phrase. \"Wanted\" is one way to describe Amaraae's position in the music landscape.\n\nLearn more: Meet The Latest Wave Of Rising Afrobeats Stars: AMAARAE, BNXN, Oladapo & More\n\nMC Lyte — \"King King\" (feat.

Fadd, Angie Martinez & More\n\nLatest News & Exclusive Videos\n\nMetro Boomin has spent more than a decade redefining rap music. The gloomy, 808-induced trap beats that flood radio airwaves and blare from nightclub speakers are a symbol of his influence. But now, the Atlanta-based superproducer is on one of his biggest musical runs to date.\n\nIn April, Metro released the second of two joint albums with Future, hinted at a third release this year, sold out a concert at the Kundalini Grand Pyramids in Egypt, and clinched the No. 1 spot on Billboard’s Hot 100 with \"Like That\" featuring Kendrick Lamar. He also delivered a first-of-its-kind instrumental diss aimed at Drake called \"BBL Drizzy,\" accusing the Toronto rapper of going under the knife.\n\nThe diss was in response to Drake’s \"Push Ups\" and subsequent disses toward Kendrick Lamar. \"Metro shut your hoe ass up and make some drums\" he rapped. The verbal blow inspired Metro to release the hilarious instrumental, which he encouraged fans to rap on for a chance to win a free beat.\n\nMonths before the feud, Metro celebrated two nominations for Best Rap Album and Producer of the Year, Non-Classical at the 66th GRAMMY Awards. While he didn’t take home a coveted golden gramophone, the momentum has elevated his career to new heights.\n\nBefore the St. Louis-bred producer kicks off the We Trust You tour with Future on July 30, revisit 10 of Metro Boomin's biggest releases.\n\n\"Karate Chop\" (2013)\n\nA 19-year-old Metro crafted his first charting single right before making a life-changing move to Atlanta. With piercing synths and bubbly arpeggios, the song was the lead single for Future’s highly anticipated sophomore album, Honest.\n\nBut Metro, a freshman at Morehouse College at the time, wasn’t sold on its success. \"I never really like it,\" Metro told XXL. \"Then every time people would come into the studio, he would always play the record and I was like, ‘Why are you so stuck on this s—? We have way harder records.’\"\n\nBut after cranking out a new mix on the original track, \"Karate Chop\" went on to become his first placement on a major label album. The remix with Lil Wayne further elevated the record and, by virtue, Metro’s profile as a musical craftsman.\n\n\"Jumpman\" (2015)\n\nMetro mastered the late-summer anthem in 2015 with \"Jumpman.\" The song was the most notable hit from Drake and Future’s collaborative mixtape, What a Time to Be Alive, and went on to shut down bustling nightclubs and obscure strip joints. And while the record didn’t perform as well as other songs on this list, it secured Future his first Top 20 hit.\n\nThe song — which features Metro’s signature bass and a screeching raven sound effect — also saw a streaming boost after an Apple Music commercial featuring Taylor Swift rapping to the song. According to Adweek, the campaign helped generate a 431 percent increase in global sales\n\nWhat makes \"Jumpman\" even more special is that a collab between Future, Metro, and Drake may never happen again. Reportedly, the duo is at odds with Drake because the OVO artist decided to link with 21 Savage on Her Loss instead of doing a follow-up project with Future.\n\n\"Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1\" (2016)\n\n\"Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1\" is the song that set Kanye West’s album, Life of Pablo, ablaze. Opening with a clip of gospel musician and singer T.L. Barrett’s Father I Stretch My Hands,” Metro’s signature producer tag kicks the record into full gear. The pulsating synthesizers and bouncy percussion match West’s raunchy and sexually explicit lyrics.\n\nMetro’s production received significant praise, with several publications pointing to his contributions on end-of-year listings. And in the eight years since its release, \"Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1\" has been certified six times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, making it one of Ye’s most-sold records of all time.\n\n\"Congratulations\" (2016)\n\nAfter the success of \"White Iverson,\" a young Post Malone was on the hunt for the hottest producers in the rap game. He managed to land Metro, who worked with fellow producers Frank Dukes and the prolific Louis Bell on the triumphant trap record \"Congratulations.\"\n\nOn a 2022 episode of the podcast \"Full Send,\" Metro revealed that the celebratory song was made after watching the world’s greatest athletes eclipse historic feats of their own. \"I remember the Olympics was on TV, and just how the music was sounding, it sounded like some champion s—,\" he said.\n\n\"Congratulations\" marked Post Malone’s second Top 20 hit following his debut, \"White Iverson.\" The song was certified diamond after totaling more than 11 million combined sales. Today, it remains one of Metro’s biggest achievements.\n\n\"Bad and Boujee\" (2017)\n\nFueled by virality and a shoutout from Donald Glover at the 2017 Golden Globes, the Migos and Lil Uzi Vert’s \"Bad and Boujee\" landed Metro Boomin his first No. 1 Billboard hit as a producer.\n\nThe song has every element Metro fans have grown to love: moody keys, hard-hitting bass, and plenty of room for the artists’ adlibs to pierce through the track.\n\nTwo months before its eventual ascension, the song had a steep hill to climb atop the Billboard charts. But Metro’s production and the chemistry between Quavo, Offset, and Uzi helped the record shoot up to its rightful place. It continues to garner praise In the years since its 2016 release, too. It was ranked No. 451 on Rolling Stone’s \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" list\n\n\"Mask Off\" (2017)\n\nWhen \"Mask Off\" dropped in 2017, it scorched the Billboard charts. Hip-hop was flirting with flutes (as heard on songs like Drake’s \"Portland\" and Kodak Black’s \"Tunnel Vision\" — another Metro-produced beat) — but \"Mask Off\" stands out as the biggest song of the short-lived era.\n\nMetro infused jazz-like undertones to perfectly meld the flute lick into the dark and mystic beat. The record led to the remix with Kendrick Lamar, with his verse breathing new life into the already-seismic hit. It’s now certified nine times platinum.\n\nYears after the song’s release, Future said \"Mask Off\" initially put radio programmers in disarray. In his East Atlanta rapper’s Apple Music documentary The WIZRD, he revealed that the song dropped before Carlton WIlliams’ \"Prison Song\" sample was officially cleared. \"Out of all the songs, ‘Mask Off’ wasn’t even legit,\" he said. \"The s— was on the radio, they’re thinking it’s not a sample, but it got so big they were like, ‘It’s a sample.’\"\n\n\"Heartless\" (2019)\n\nThe Weeknd's \"Heartless\" is a pop and electro-clash classic that fires on all cylinders. The visuals are atmospheric, the lyrics are ultra-stimulating, and the production — partly handled by Metro — makes for a lasting club banger.\n\nThe leading single for The Weeknd’s fourth studio album, After Hours, topped the Billboard charts. It marked the Toronto-born crooner’s fourth No. 1 hit and unveiled the depths of Metro’s musical arsenal.\n\nMetro produced four tracks on After Hours: \"Faith,\" \"Escape from L.A.,\" \"Until I Bleed Out\" and \"Heartless.\" On the latter and in his other collaborations with The Weeknd, James Blake, and Solange, Metro’s creative sorcery was tested. He proved, once again, that he could generate a hit outside the confines of trap music.\n\n\"Creepin’\" (2022)\n\nAfter a solid outing on his first album Not All Heroes Wear Capes, Metro returned with another series of hard-hitting records. His second solo venture, Heroes & Villains, featured John Legend, Don Tolliver, Travis Scott, and other premiere artists. But the biggest song to come out of the star-studded lineup was \"Creepin’\" featuring 21 Savage and The Weeknd.\n\nThe only single to Metro’s second solo album struck sonic gold. The Weeknd’s flowy vocals overlay the silky and harmonic record, which transitions to a more trap-induced beat once 21 Savage’s verse kicks in. The remake of Mario Winans’ \"I Don’t Wanna Know\" was a notable departure from Metro’s past singles, which heavily lean on his trap roots. But it still managed to connect with his audience – and even beyond it. \"Creepin\" peaked at No. 3 on Billboard, which was Metro’s highest-charting solo record up until that point.\n\nSpider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse (2023)\n\nFollowing the success of \"Creepin’\" and his other smash singles, Metro extended his creative powers to the film world. He was given the green light to executive produce the soundtrack for Sony’s Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.\n\nMetro Boomin told Indie Wire that he crafted songs from rough animations and selected scenes \"just to get in the world and the story of Miles [Morales] and what he’s going through,\" He even exchanged phone calls and texts with the film’s composer Daniel Pemberton to ensure the soundtrack and score were on the same accord.\n\nFrom the classical serenade \"Am I Dreaming\" to the Latin swing of \"Silk & Cologne\" and the Timbaland-stomping \"Nas Morales,\" the result was an equally transformative musical experience. Each record ranged in musicality and tone while beautifully complementing the vibrant animated superhero flick.\n\n\"Like That\" (2024)\n\n\"Like That\" is easily one of the best beats in Metro’s catalog, and may end up being one of the most memorable. Samples from Rodney O & Joe Cooley’s \"Everlasting Bass\" and Eazy-E’s 1989 classic \"Eazy-Duz-It\" shaped the bouncy trap beat, sinister synths, and spine-chilling baseline. But Kendrick Lamar’s verse turned it into a heat-seeking missile.\n\nWith the song’s thunderous bass and rapid hi-hats in the background, Kendrick dissed J. Cole and Drake for their recent claims of rap supremacy, particularly on 2023’s \"First Person Shooter.\" The lyrical nuke sparked the Civil War-style rap feud, which led to a seven-song exchange between Kendrick and Drake.\n\nThe initial musical blow made the genre stand still. It also led to the massive success of the record, which notched Future and Metro another No. 1 hit song. It also helped the pair’s album, We Don’t Trust You, claim the top spot on the Billboard 200 albums chart.\n\nInside The Metro-Verse: How Metro Boomin Went From Behind-The-Scenes Mastermind To Rap's Most In-Demand Producer"
