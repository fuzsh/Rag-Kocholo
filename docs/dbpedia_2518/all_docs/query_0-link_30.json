        "text": "When two musical artists blend their talents in a creative collaboration, the process is a spectacle to behold, but the quality of the resulting material can vary.\n\nIn the most successful scenarios, a meeting of the minds between artists seasoned and accomplished in their own right can bring the best out of each other. In other instances, budding heads can clash, leading to lackluster efforts or, at worst, feuds between both parties.\n\nHip-Hop and R&B are genres that have both embraced the concept of superstar pairings, particularly over the past three decades, as a number of artists on both sides of the fence have conjoined for full-length releases.\n\nIn 1997, legendary crooners Gerald Levert, Keith Sweat, and Johnny Gill formed LSG, releasing their debut album Levert.Sweat.Gill that year, which peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 and was certified double platinum. Rappers Jay-Z, DMX, and Ja Rule also teased a supergroup dubbed Murder Inc. that, after a handful of collaborations, ultimately fell through.\n\nFive years later, in 2002, JAY-Z and R. Kelly teamed up for The Best of Both Worlds, a project that was also certified platinum, but received mixed-reviews and sparked an ill-fated sequel and bad blood between the hitmakers. While those pairings were hit-and-miss, we’ve since gotten a consistent stream of joint-albums that have proved to reach or even exceed expectations.\n\nIn 2011, JAY-Z linked with Kanye West for Watch the Throne, with the commercial returns equaling its critical acclaim, topping the Billboard album chart and going quintuple platinum. Recently, Yeezy has added to his now lengthy list of collaborative endeavors with Vultures 1, his new album with rap singer Ty Dolla $ign.\n\nDespite being released independently, Vultures 1 debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and has been ranked among the hottest releases of the year thus far. With the buzz surrounding Vultures 1 at a peak, VIBE got nostalgic and took a look back at the five best collaborative albums that shook up the game over the past decade."
