        "text": "Notable line: “I got a future so I'm singing for my grandma/\n\nYou singing too, but your grandma ain't my grandma.”\n\n2. Midnight Marauders by A Tribe Called Quest\n\nOriginating in New York, A Tribe Called Quest is quintessential chilled out East Coast rap. Sampling heavily from Jazz, Midnight Marauders, released in 1993, is a relaxing and rhythmic journey that one cannot help but nod along to. Tribe pushed the boundaries of hip hop with their love of Jazz and even had Logic steal their robotic narrator on his album ‘Under Pressure’.\n\nNotable Line: “All the residential Questers who invade the air\n\nHold up a second son, cause we almost there”\n\n3. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy by Kanye West\n\nReleased in 2010, this album is the conglomeration of the styles of all of Kanye’s albums up until this point. It builds on his experimentation with production and synthetic instrumentals that he began to work with on ‘808s and Heartbreak’ that marked the transition between “old Kanye” to “new Kanye”. Continuing his passion for sampling, notable artists such as Arctic Monkeys and King Crimson can be heard in the instrumentals of several songs. Kanye resurrects his playful and on occasion controversial lyricism that made his simple rap delivery so iconic. With several stellar features, this album never has a sub par track.\n\nNotable line: “Cause the same people that tried to black ball me\n\nForgot about two things, my black balls”\n\n4. Aquemini by Outkast\n\nBig Boi and Andre 3000’s collaboration, Outkast, is classic Dirty South rap. Originating in Atlanta, Outkast embodies the slow drawl mixed with quick rhyming that characterizes Southern rap. Aquemini, the combination of Andre and Big Boi’s horoscope symbols, perfectly represents the duality of the two MCs’ different delivery styles mixing over relaxed, semi-psychedelic instrumentals often including vocal harmonies that fade in and out of the tracks.\n\nNotable line: “Twice upon a time there was a boy who died\n\nAnd lived happily ever after, but that's another chapter”\n\n5. Good Kid, m.A.A.d City by Kendrick Lamar\n\nKendrick Lamar’s second studio album, released in 2012, is a work of storytelling genius. While this album does contain songs that at first listen appear to be party bangers, in the context of the album become powerful narratives of Kendrick’s experiences. Most famously, the song ‘Swimming Pools’, on first listen appears to be a party anthem about drinking in the club, while in reality, it is a solemn warning against alcoholism and the dangers of drinking to escape one’s reality. This album manages to have both an infectious, danceable sound that persists throughout and a harrowing story of Kendrick’s experience of a bad trip. The story is told out of order, and after a few listens, the genius of his storytelling ability becomes clear.\n\nNotable line: “You love your hood, might even love it to death\n\nBut what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?”\n\nCheck out your new intro to hip hop playlist here."
