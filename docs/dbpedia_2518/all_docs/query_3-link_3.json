        "text": "What’s better than an album from one of your favorite artists? How about an album from two of your favorite artists? Who doesn’t love a great collaboration? Especially, when it’s a collaboration between artists who are top notch. If you're in search of the best collab albums to add to your collection, check out our rundown of the 21 best collab albums ever. When it comes to the best collab albums ever, it's no easy feat putting a list together. We took a deep look at some of the most legendary albums of all time where artists came together to make magic.\n\nRELATED: The Best Debut Rap Albums of the 2010s\n\nWithout further ado, here's a look at our list -- which is in no particular order.\n\nCollaborators: Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett\n\nYear Released: 2014\n\nSingles: \"Anything Goes\"& \"I Can't Give You Anything but Love\"\n\n\"Cheek to Cheek,\" is the magical collaboration between Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett. This timeless classic showcases their individual strengths perfectly merging to recreate the golden age of jazz type vibes. With its soulful and nostalgic vibes, \"Cheek to Cheek\" gives listeners a blast from the past and reminds us all of the universal appeal of jazz.\n\nCollaborators: Jay-Z and Kanye West\n\nGroup Name: The Throne\n\nYear Released: 2011\n\nSingles: \"H•A•M,\" \"Otis,\" \"Niggas in Paris\" & \"No Church in the Wild\"\n\nSeeing this album at number 14 on our list is your assurance that its in no particular order. While it's challenging to pick favorites when it comes to albums, Watch the Throne from Jay-Z and Kanye is an undisputed favorite. They made the year 2011 feel like the year 3000, musically speaking.\n\nCollaborators: Drake and 21 Savage\n\nYear Released: 2022\n\nSingles: “Rich Flex,” “Jumbotron Shit Poppin” & “Spin Bout U”\n\nThe creative synergy between Drake and 21 Savage is undeniable, making it no surprise that these frequent collaborators would unite for a joint album. Their 16-track blockbuster, \"Her Loss,\" houses contributions from superproducers like Metro Boomin, Boi-1da and Tay Keith. The album features Travis Scott delivering a Utopia-ready verse on “Pussy & Millions,” while Birdman makes a memorable appearance on \"Middle of the Ocean.\" Lil Yachty's name graces the album credits for his production work on several tracks, including \"BackOutsideBoyz,\" \"Privileged Rappers,\" “Pussy & Millions,” and \"Jumbotron Shit Poppin.\" In the lead-up to the album's release, Drake and 21 Savage stirred up buzz with playful antics, such as mock performances on Tiny Desk, SNL (featuring Michael B. Jordan), and Colors, releasing a spoof Vogue cover, and conducting a faux Howard Stern interview.\n\nUpon release, \"Her Loss\" soared to No. 1, moving an impressive 404,000 album-equivalent units and racking up over 513 million on-demand streams in its first week. This compelling display of artistic collaboration underscores why \"Her Loss\" is considered one of the best collab albums in recent times.\n\nCollaborators: Drake and Future\n\nYear Released: 2015\n\nSingles: \"Jumpman\"\n\nJust as the title of the album states, 2015 really was a time to be alive, especially thanks to Drake and Future's collaborative album. What a Time to Be Alive is one of the greatest albums of the last decade in hip-hop, and has scored a spot on our list, accordingly."
