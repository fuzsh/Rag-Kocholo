        "text": "by Susan Flantzer\n\n© Unofficial Royalty 2019\n\nPrincess Helena of the United Kingdom and Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg were married on July 5, 1866, at the Private Chapel in Windsor Castle in Windsor, England.\n\nHelena’s Early Life\n\nPrincess Helena was the fifth of the nine children and the third of the five daughters of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. She was born at Buckingham Palace on May 25, 1846. Known within the family as Lenchen, Helena’s childhood was spent at her mother’s various homes, in the care of nurses and nannies. An accomplished artist and pianist from a young age, she was overshadowed throughout her life by her siblings. Helena was closest to her brother Alfred, and the two remained so for their entire lives.\n\nHelena’s life would change drastically in 1861, with the death of her beloved father. She began helping her sister Alice who became an unofficial secretary to their mother. After Alice’s marriage, Helena would continue in this role, along with her younger sister Louise, before the role was primarily taken by her youngest sister, Beatrice.\n\nHelena had a brief romance with Carl Ruland, who had served as her father’s librarian. When the Queen discovered her daughter’s interest in one of the servants, Ruland was quickly dispatched back to Germany. Victoria then began a quest to find Helena an appropriate husband.\n\nFor more information on Princess Helena, see Unofficial Royalty: Princess Helena of the United Kingdom, Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein\n\nChristian’s Early Life\n\nPrince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, generally shortened to Schleswig-Holstein was born on January 22, 1831, in Augustenborg, Denmark, the sixth of the seven children of Christian August, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg and Countess Louise Sophie of Danneskiold-Samsøe. His elder surviving brother was Friedrich VIII, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein who married Princess Adelheid of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, a daughter of Queen Victoria’s half-sister Feodora of Leiningen, Princess of Hohenlohe-Langenburg. Among Friedrich and Adelheid’s children was Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein who married Queen Victoria’s grandson Wilhelm II, German Emperor and King of Prussia.\n\nWhile attending the University of Bonn, Christian became close friends with the future German Emperor Friedrich III. This friendship would serve him well in later years, as Friedrich’s wife was Victoria, Princess Royal, the eldest sister of Christian’s future wife.\n\nFor more information on Prince Christian, see Unofficial Royalty: Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein\n\nThe Engagement\n\nHelena was described by her mother as plump, dowdy, uncomplicated, unambitious, obedient, and without charm – which did not help her with marriage prospects. One of Queen Victoria’s requirements for Helena’s husband was that he had to be prepared to live near the Queen so that Helena could continue to be her companion and secretary. This eliminated many potential husbands. The final candidate in Queen Victoria’s search was a 35-year-old impoverished prince, Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, suggested by Queen Victoria’s uncle Leopold I, King of the Belgians.\n\nBeing fifteen years older than Helena, Christian was closer in age to Queen Victoria. When Christian was first summoned to meet Queen Victoria, he assumed that the widowed Queen was inspecting him as a new husband for herself rather than as a husband for one of her daughters. Christian was balding, looked older than his age, and was not considered handsome, certainly not the type of prince a 19-year-old princess sees in her dreams. However, Christian was agreeable and easy-going, spoke fluent English, and had been a long-time friend of Helena’s brother-in-law, the future German Emperor Friedrich III.\n\nIn August 1865, Queen Victoria and all her children went to Coburg to unveil a statue of Prince Albert. It was there that Helena and Christian first met. The possibility of a marriage between Helena and Christian was not met with unanimous approval within the royal family. The Princess of Wales (formerly Princess Alexandra of Denmark) could not tolerate a marriage to someone who, she felt, took the Schleswig and Holstein duchies away from her own father, the King of Denmark. The Prince of Wales supported his wife in this. Helena’s sister Alice also disapproved as she felt Queen Victoria was pushing Helena into this marriage to ensure that Helena would remain near her side. The fact that Christian was 15 years older than Helena certainly did not help that suggestion. However, Helena and Christian knew they did not have many marriage prospects and were both agreeable to the marriage. Their engagement was announced on December 5, 1865.\n\nThe Wedding Site\n\nThe Private Chapel in Windsor Castle was created for Queen Victoria by architect Edward Blore between 1840 and 1847. There were niches with marble sculptures, pews, and a large Gothic chandelier hanging from the ceiling. On November 20, 1992, a fire began in the Private Chapel in Windsor Castle when a painter left a spotlight too close to the curtains. The fire caused much damage to Windsor Castle. The Private Chapel was later restored but the new Private Chapel is much smaller, has chairs instead of pews, and is only able to fit thirty people. The new altar was made by Queen Elizabeth II’s nephew David Armstrong-Jones, 2nd Earl of Snowdon, a furniture designer and maker.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Private Chapel, Windsor Castle in Windsor, England\n\nThe Wedding Guests\n\nThis is a complete list from the London Gazette, Issue 23140, 17 July 1866.\n\nRoyal Guests\n\nQueen Victoria, mother of the bride\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales, brother and sister-in-law of the bride\n\nPrince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, brother of the bride\n\nPrince Louise, sister of the bride\n\nPrince Arthur, brother of the bride\n\nPrince Leopold, brother of the bride\n\nPrincess Beatrice, sister of the bride\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge, great-aunt of the bride\n\nLeopold II, King of the Belgians, first cousin once removed of the bride, and his wife Queen Marie Henriette\n\nErnst, 4th Prince of Leiningen, half-first cousin of the bride, and his wife Marie, Princess of Leiningen\n\nPrince Edward of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach\n\nPrince Friedrich of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, brother of the groom\n\nThe Maharajah Duleep Singh\n\nThe Queen’s Household – participated in the royal, bridegroom’s and bride’s procession\n\nElizabeth Wellesley, Duchess of Wellington, Mistress of the Robes\n\nSusanna Innes-Kerr, Duchess of Roxburghe, Lady of the Bedchamber in Waiting\n\nThe Honorable Mrs. Robert Bruce, Woman of the Bedchamber in Waiting\n\nJohn Townshend, Viscount Sydney, Lord Chamberlain of the Household\n\nValentine Browne, Viscount Castlerosse, Vice-Chamberlain of the Household\n\nJohn Ponsonby, 5th Earl of Bessborough, Lord Steward\n\nGeorge Brudenell-Bruce, 2nd Marquess of Ailesbury, Master of the Horse\n\nLieutenant General The Honorable Charles Grey, Joint Keeper of the Privy Purse, Equerry in Waiting\n\nMajor General Sir Thomas Biddulph, Joint Keeper of the Privy Purse\n\nLord Otho Fitzgerald, Treasurer of the Household\n\nGranville Proby, 4th Earl of Carysfort, Comptroller of the Household\n\nGeorge Bingham, 3rd Earl of Lucan, Gold Stick in Waiting\n\nThomas Foley, 4th Baron Foley, Captain of the Gentlemen-at-Arms\n\nHenry Reynolds-Moreton, 3rd Earl of Ducie, Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard\n\nRichard Boyle, 9th Earl of Cork, Master of the Buckhounds\n\nMajor Sir John Cowell, Master of the Household\n\nFrederick Methuen, 2nd Baron Methuen, Lord in Waiting\n\nLieutenant-Colonel W.H.F.

The design of the lace featured roses, ivy, and myrtle. The train, also made of the Honiton lace, had bouquets of orange blossom and myrtle attached. On her head, Helena wore a wreath of orange blossoms and myrtle with a veil made of Honiton lace which matched her dress. She wore a necklace, earrings, and a brooch, all of opals and diamonds, a wedding gift from her mother Queen Victoria. In addition, Helena wore bracelets set with miniatures and the Royal Order of Victoria and Albert.\n\nThe eight bridesmaids were dressed in white glacé dresses covered with tulle under a long tunic of silver tulle, which was looped up on one side with a chatelaine of pink roses, forget-me-nots, and white heather. The bodice and skirt were also trimmed with pink roses, forget-me-nots, and heather. On their heads, the bridesmaids wore a wreath of pink roses, forget-me-nots, and heather with a long tulle veil.\n\nThe Wedding\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nThe wedding ceremony was held at 12:30 PM on July 5, 1866, at the Private Chapel in Windsor Castle in Windsor, England. At noon, members of the British royal family, along with other royalty and important guests gathered in the White Drawing Room in Windsor Castle. Princess Helena remained in Queen Victoria’s Private Apartments while members of her procession assembled in the corridor outside Queen Victoria’s Private Apartments. Prince Christian, his supporters and members of his procession waited in the Red Room. The Ladies and Gentlemen of The Queen’s Household along with the Ladies and Gentlemen of foreign royalty assembled in the corridor. Ambassadors, Foreign Ministers, Cabinet Ministers, and other guests assembled in the Red and Green Drawing Rooms and were then conducted to their seats. The Archbishop of Canterbury and the other clergy taking part in the wedding ceremony assembled in the Audience Chamber. They then proceeded to the Private Chapel and took their places at the altar.\n\nAfter the Ambassadors, Foreign Ministers, Cabinet Ministers, and other guests had taken their seats and the clergy had assembled in the Private Chapel, the Royal Procession formed in the corridor outside the White Drawing Room and were conducted to the Private Chapel by the Lord Chamberlain and the Vice-Chamberlain. The Lord Chamberlain and the Vice-Chamberlain then proceeded to the Red Room and conducted Prince Christian’s procession to the Private Chapel. Finally, the Lord Chamberlain and the Vice-Chamberlain proceeded to Queen Victoria’s Private Apartments and conducted Princess Helena’s procession to the Private Chapel. As her father had died in 1861, Helena was escorted by her mother Queen Victoria, her eldest brother The Prince of Wales, and her eight bridesmaids.\n\nAs the Bride’s Procession made its way to the Private Chapel, the March from the opera “Scipio” by Georg Friedrich Handel was played. When Helena arrived in the Private Chapel she took her place on the left side of the altar while Queen Victoria was led to her seat.\n\nCharles Longley, Archbishop of Canterbury performed the entire wedding ceremony. The responses of both Helena and Christian were made in a firm and audible voice and Christian spoke with a decidedly foreign accent. When the Archbishop of Canterbury asked, “Who giveth this Woman to be married to this Man?”, it was Queen Victoria, in lieu of her deceased husband, who answered in a dignified and determined manner. During the ceremony, the choir sang a chorale by William George Cusins, specially composed for the occasion. Cusins was the organist in Queen Victoria’s Private Chapels and played the organ during the wedding ceremony.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, Helena was warmly embraced by Queen Victoria and The Prince of Wales. Then, to Ludwig Spohr’s march from the oratorio “The Fall of Babylon”, Helena and Christian proceeded to the White Drawing Room, accompanied by the royal procession and the clergy, to sign the marriage registry along with Queen Victoria, other royalty, and some members of the Royal Household.\n\nPost-Wedding\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nPrincess Helena and Prince Christian leave Windsor Castle for their honeymoon\n\nLuncheon was served to members of the British royal family and other royalty in the Oak Room at Windsor Castle. Other guests were served a buffet in the Waterloo Chamber. At 4:15 PM, guests desiring to return to London boarded a special train. At the same time, the bride and groom left Windsor by special train for Southampton where a boat would convey them to the Isle of Wight for their honeymoon at Osborne House.\n\nLater that evening at Windsor Castle, a banquet was held in the Waterloo Gallery and an evening party was held in St. George’s Hall.\n\nChildren\n\nHelena and Christian had five children:\n\nPrince Christian Victor (1867-1900) – unmarried\n\nPrince Albert, later Duke of Schleswig-Holstein (1869-1931), unmarried, had an illegitimate daughter\n\nPrincess Helena Victoria (1870-1948) – unmarried\n\nPrincess Marie Louise (1872-1956) – married Prince Aribert of Anhalt, marriage dissolved, no children\n\nPrince Harald (born and died1876) – lived just 8 days\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.
