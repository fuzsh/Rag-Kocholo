        "text": "auntie said:\n\nYes, so much in fact, that the rest of the British aristocracy called them \"those Germans\" It only stopped when George V and Mary who tried to bring up their children and marry them off as Englishly as possible!\n\nIt didn't even start with Edward VII and Alexandra? Alexandra was Danish after all, not German? But then her parents were German, so who knows? But of course, George VI, who was George V:s and Mary's son, did get married to Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, a Scottish aristocrat.\n\nAmy said:\n\nI think it was probably only depressing if you were poor. People who weren't poor had a wonderful time.\n\nYour economy doesn't determine if you're happy or not. There will always be poor people, who are happier than some rich people. And I wonder how happy the princes and princesses of this era really were.\n\nAmy said:\n\nI think it was probably only depressing if you were poor. People who weren't poor had a wonderful time.\n\nPeople were very restricted and ruled by very strict norms of behaviour. It was either to suppress all your individual ideas or to be socially ostracized. You lived within your small social circle and you abided by the fixed rules and it was a boring life in which one wrong step could ruin all. In order to create the right people for this kind of life you had to start to train your children early on and with extreme consequence. Books about childrens education during this time are books about torture - believe me. And the worst was thast there was not even the idea that something could be wrong with this lifestyle. It gives me the creeps just to think about it.\n\nAvareenah said:\n\nHelena and Christian's marriage was an arranged one, which many of the family were against, but it proved to be a happy union, with four children.\n\nHelena and Christian were the only members of Queen Victoria's immediate family to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary.\n\nI always get a tingle when reading about their 50th wedding anniversary because their nephew sent them a telegram - so what you say!! He was the Kaiser and the anniversary was during World War One - even in the middle of a war with Britain he still managed to remember his British aunt and her husband and get a congratulatory telegram to them.\n\nchrissy57 said:\n\nI always get a tingle when reading about their 50th wedding anniversary because their nephew sent them a telegram - so what you say!!

That was one of the strange ways about Wilhelm II. He could be capable of great kindness while being almost brutal in his dealings with some -- his own family members too.\n\nchrissy57 said:\n\nI always get a tingle when reading about their 50th wedding anniversary because their nephew sent them a telegram - so what you say!!

Britain was mightier than Germany, and Queen Victoria was still very much remembered. I think the Kaiser had every reason to be proud of having her as his grandmother. And his mother Victoria had probably taught him to appreciate his Brittish relations. So I don't see anything strange with the Kaiser sending a telegram to his Brittish aunt.\n\nAvareenah said:\n\nIt is, yes, but I feel if Edward had lived long enough to celebrate his and Alexandra's Golden Wedding anniversary, it would have been somewhat of a hollow celebration, given the number of liaisons he had during his marriage, whereas Lenchen and Christian really seemed content together!\n\nEven with the infidelity, it would have been a 50th anniversary of a king's and queen's wedding, so I don't think it would be too hollow. Maybe between Edward and Alexandra, but not officially.\n\nFurienna said:\n\nWell, I still don't think the Kaiser had any reason to be ashamed of his mother being a Brittish princess.

And his mother Victoria had probably taught him to appreciate his Brittish relations. So I don't see anything strange with the Kaiser sending a telegram to his Brittish aunt.\n\nMy point was more that it was during the war when getting a telegram between friendly nations was difficult (based on the problems my great-grandmother had sending one to her husband's family telling them of his death - took 6 months to do so) but he managed to get one to a warring country.\n\nEverything I have read about him suggests that he despised his British heritage, except for loving his grandmother. Even aged 4 he is supposed to have told the doctors not to stop a bleeding nose so his 'English blood' could flow out.\n\nI suspect some of it was jealousy that as the eldest child of the eldest child he wasn't the heir to the British throne.\n\nEven with the infidelity, it would have been a 50th anniversary of a king's and queen's wedding, so I don't think it would be too hollow. Maybe between Edward and Alexandra, but not officially.\n\nI actually think that in his way Edward loved Alix, mainly due to the fact that he never ever allowed anyone to insult her. Who knows, if he had more to do officially, maybe he wouldn't have strayed? Then again Alix's illness in her third pregnancy and her deafness was hard to live with for a man who enjoyed company as much as he did - not an excuse of course but a bit of an explanation."
