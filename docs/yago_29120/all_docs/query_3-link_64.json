Have an account? .\n\nPrincess Beatrice of York has become the latest royal to tie the knot at a secret ceremony in Windsor on Friday, July 17.\n\nBeatrice and her new husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi made history with their ceremony, as it was the first socially distanced nuptials for a member of the British royal family.\n\nTo celebrate, Insider has gathered photos from the 30 most iconic royal weddings from modern British history.\n\nBobbie Edsor contributed to an earlier version of this story.\n\nVisit Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApril 8, 1795: Prince George (to be King George IV) married Princess Caroline at Chapel Royal, St James's Palace.\n\nThe first cousins' marriage was not illegal at the time because the dangers inflicted on an incestuous couple's offspring weren't fully understood.\n\nFebruary 10, 1840: Queen Victoria married Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha at St James's Palace.\n\nThe Queen's white dress was unusual at the time. It was more fashionable for brides to wear colorful dresses — especially gold. In the 19th century, a white wedding dress was actually a symbol of wealth rather than purity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanuary 25, 1858: Princess Victoria (daughter of Queen Victoria) married Prince Frederick of Prussia at the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace.\n\nThe people of London filled the streets trying to get a glimpse of the Princess Royal on the way to St James's Palace. Princess Victoria's procession included 18 carriages, over 300 soldiers, and 220 horses, according to historian Hannah Pakula.\n\nMarch 10, 1863: Prince Edward (to be King Edward VII) married Princess Alexandra of Denmark at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.\n\nWhen her son married Princess Alexandra, Queen Victoria didn't join the rest of the wedding procession in the pews of St George's Chapel. Instead, she watched the marriage ceremony alone from an upper balcony, looking over the crowds, according to one portrait of the ceremony.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJuly 5, 1866: Princess Helena (daughter of Queen Victoria) married Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.\n\nPrincess Helena — nicknamed \"Lenchen\" by her family — was reportedly outspoken and tomboyish, according to the Royal Collection.\n\nThis didn't stop Queen Victoria's daughter from dressing up in exquisite, royal fashion with a flower crown adorned with orange blossom (a symbol of fertility) and myrtle (a symbol of love).\n\nMarch 21, 1871: Princess Louise (daughter of Queen Victoria) married Marquis of Lorne at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.\n\nPrincess Louise was reportedly \"the prettiest and liveliest\" of Queen Victoria's daughters. She was the only princess in her family to marry a commoner rather than a fellow royal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarch 13, 1879: Prince Arthur (son of Queen Victoria) married Princess Louise Margaret of Prussia at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.\n\nPrince Arthur was reportedly Queen Victoria's favourite son and worked in the military for most of his life.\n\nJuly 6, 1893: Prince George (to be King George V) married Princess Victoria Mary of Teck at the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace.\n\nIt is rumored that Prince George accidentally caught a glimpse of his bride before their wedding ceremony — which superstitious individuals widely consider to be bad luck. Nevertheless, the pair remained married until the King's death in 1936.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFebruary 10, 1904: Princess Alice (daughter of Prince Leopold — fourth son of Queen Victoria) married Prince Alexander of Teck at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.\n\nPrincess Alice was led down the aisle by her brother, Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n\nJune 15, 1905: Princess Margaret of Connaught (daughter of Prince Arthur — Queen Victoria's third son) married Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden (to be King Gustaf VI of Sweden) at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.\n\nPrincess Margaret and her younger sister, Patricia, were seen as two of the most eligible princesses in Europe prior to their respective marriages.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFebruary 27, 1919: Princess Patricia of Connaught (daughter of Prince Arthur — Queen Victoria's third son) married Alexander Ramsey at Westminster Abbey.\n\nPrincess Patricia and Alexander Ramsey's wedding was the first cause for nationwide celebration since the end of the Great War in November 1918 — and was toasted heartily across the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFebruary 28, 1922: Princess Mary (daughter of King George V) married Viscount Lascelles at Westminster Abbey.\n\nDespite the couple's 15-year age difference, they were perfectly matched.\n\nIn his memoirs, their oldest son said: \"My mother was never so happy to our eyes as children as when she and my father were embarked on some scheme together, as they often were.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApril 26, 1923: Prince Albert (to be King George VI) married Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon at Westminster Abbey.\n\nIt took three separate marriage proposals before Lady Elizabeth finally agreed to marry Prince Albert (commonly nicknamed Bertie).\n\nThe bride-to-be was reportedly scared of the huge changes in her life that marrying into the royal family would cause. Little did she know that she would later become Queen after Bertie's older brother abdicated the throne.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJune 3, 1937: Prince Edward (to be King Edward VIII before later abdicating the throne) married Bessie Wallis Warfield Simpson at Château de Candé, France.\n\nPrince Edward's marriage to an American divorcee not only meant he had to abdicate the throne, but also caused a huge rift between the prince and the rest of his family.\n\nThe pair married in France with only seven people present and the ceremony was reportedly over within five minutes, according to Time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNovember 20, 1947: Princess Elizabeth (to be Queen Elizabeth II) married Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten (to be Prince Philip) at Westminster Abbey.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip reportedly fell in love when the Queen was just 13, in 1939.\n\nThe couple became secretly engaged in 1946 after the Queen's father, King George VI, forbade his daughter from publicly announcing the engagement until she turned 21 one year later.\n\nMay 6, 1960: Princess Margaret (daughter of King George VI) married Antony Armstrong-Jones at Westminster Abbey.\n\nThe happy couple's ceremony in Westminster Abbey was the first ever royal wedding to be officially televised.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApril 24, 1963: Princess Alexandra of Kent (daughter of Prince George — King George V's fourth son) married Angus Ogilvy at Westminster Abbey.\n\nThe pair's ceremony was broadcast from Westminster Abbey and an estimated 200 million people worldwide tuned in to watch the royal wedding, according to historian James Panton.\n\nJuly 8, 1972: Prince Richard of Gloucester (son of Prince Henry — the third son of King George V) married Birgitte van Deurs at St Andrew's Church.\n\nThe pair reportedly met while studying at the University of Cambridge. They opted for a small ceremony at St Andrew's Church in Barnwell, Northamptonshire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNovember 14, 1973: Princess Anne (daughter of Queen Elizabeth II) married Captain Mark Phillips at Westminster Abbey.\n\nPrincess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips met thanks to their mutual love of equestrian sports. The pair announced their engagement when the princess was just 22, and married six months later.\n\nJuly 29, 1981: Prince Charles (son of Queen Elizabeth II) married Diana Spencer at St Paul's Cathedral.\n\n600,000 people filled London's streets to get a glimpse of the couple, a further 750 million watched the ceremony on TV, and St Paul's Cathedral was filled by the 3,500-strong congregation — not to mention that mammoth train.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJuly 23, 1986: Prince Andrew (son of Queen Elizabeth II) married Sarah Ferguson at Westminster Abbey.\n\nDespite divorcing in 1996, the pair reportedly still live together in Royal Lodge, Windsor.\n\nJune 19, 1999: Prince Edward (son of Queen Elizabeth II) married Sophie Rhys-Jones at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.\n\nThe couple were adamant that their wedding would not be turned into a state occasion, and no politicians or heads of state outside of the royal family's close circle were invited.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApril 9, 2005: Prince Charles (son of Queen Elizabeth II) married Camilla Parker-Bowles at Windsor Guildhall.\n\nPrince Charles and Parker-Bowles married in 2005.
