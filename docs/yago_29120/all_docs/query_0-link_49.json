        "text": "“A London correspondent of a New York daily paper comments rather frankly on the unpopularity of Prince Christian in England. \" Prince Christian he says, \" married the English Princess Helena, and the people, by a sort of instinct, came to the conclusion that the young lady had been forced into the marriage, and that the whole business was a 'shame.' Since that time Prince Christian has been growing more and more unpopular, not on account of anything he has done so much as because he is disliked. The other day the prince went with his wife and some of the royal family to Liverpool, and the people who waited outside hissed him, but cheered all the rest. The affair was hushed up but there is reason to believe that it caused some little sensation at Windsor. The photographs of the prince have been partly the cause of his unpopularity. He is a churlish looking man, with a very bald head, and the bald head has, I fear, done this business. The Princess Helena was only 19 when she married, and the English people (who like the royal ladies especially) were not satisfied, and thought her husband not good enough for her. Then, again, the prince of the bald head was unquestionably one of the very smallest of the very small Germans who have been strapped on to the shoulders of the patient and cloudily-witted John Bull. He had, before he came over here, a revenue from his immense income of £200 a year. This enormous income was not enough to get married upon, and very glad he must have been to catch one of the Queen's daughters, and to be taken into comfortable lodgings in the house of the aforesaid John Bull. The next thing, of course, was to make an income for this rather farcical prince. Some very ugly stories are in circulation, most of them probably untrue, but they helped to make people dislike him. Nevertheless Parliament voted him a grant of £30,000 (as a dower to his wife and £6000 a year. imagine what a change for a poor devil to be taken from the midst of debt and poverty to live in one of the Queen's palaces and have a large income given to him, upon no harder condition than that he should marry a well educated and rather pretty girl ! But things do not always go smoothly with Prince Christian. As I have said he was loudly hissed in the public streets the other day, and now this week a stinging caricature has been leveled at him in the Tomdliawk, a paper which is making wonderful progress in-consequence of the boldness and freedom of its cartoons. We are shown an unpleasant little man perched on the back of the British lion and tugging away at his mane. Underneath is written ' Set a beggar on Horseback, or Translated from the German. This will not please the family circle at Osborne for Windsor. I fancy Prince Christian has rather a bad time before him. The Queen is understood to insist upon his residing in this country, and under her own eye apparently with a due regard for the protection of her daughter. A man ought to behave properly on £6000 a year, seeing that he has done nothing to merit a farthing. There are Englishmen (would you believe it?) of better and nobler descent than this very little German, and of handsome private means and station, who would be too happy to make good husbands of any of the royal princesses (except those who are already married, pray understand). But no that would not do. A seedy gentleman, all out at elbows, from Faderlaud, is the only eligible person. The inevitable consequence of such a system is Prince Christian.\""
