        "text": "Packard, p. 113]\n\nDespite the political controversies and their age difference—he was fifteen years her senior—Helena was happy with Christian and was determined to marry him. [Packard, p. 114] As a younger son of a reigning duke, the absence of any foreign commitments allowed him to remain permanently in England—the Queen's primary concern—and she declared the marriage would go ahead. [Van der Kiste, p. 64] Helena and Christian were actually 3rd cousins in descent from Frederick, Prince of Wales. Relations between Helena and Alexandra remained strained, and Alexandra was unprepared to accept Christian (who was also a third cousin to Alexandra in descent from Frederik V of Denmark) as either a cousin or brother. [Battiscombe, p. 76] The Queen never forgave Alice for accusations of possessiveness, and wrote of the Waleses shortly afterwards: “Bertie is most affectionate and kind but Alix [pet name for Alexandra] is by no means what she ought to be. It will be long, if ever, before she regains my confidence.” [Van der Kiste, p. 181]\n\nEngagement and wedding\n\nThe engagement was declared on 5 December 1865, and despite the Prince of Wales's initial refusal to attend, Princess Alice intervened, and the wedding was a happy occasion. [Packard, p. 115] The Queen allowed the ceremony to take place at Windsor Castle, albeit in the Private Chapel rather than the grander St George's Chapel, and relieved her black mourning dress with a white mourning cap which draped over her back. [Packard, p. 116] The main participants filed into the chapel to the sound of Beethoven's , creating a spectacle only marred by the sudden disappearance of Prince George, the Duke of Cambridge, who had a sudden gout attack. Christian filed into the abbey with his two supporters, Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar and Prince Frederic of Schleswig-Holstein, and Helena was given away by her mother, who escorted her up the aisle with the Prince of Wales and eight bridesmaids. [LondonGazette |issue= 23140|date= 17 June 1866|startpage= 4092|accessdate= 2008-02-18] Christian looked older than he was, and one guest commented that Helena looked as if she was marrying an aged uncle. Indeed, when he was first summoned to England, he assumed that the widowed Queen was inspecting him as a new husband for herself rather than as a candidate for one of her daughters. [Van der Kiste, p. 72] The couple spent the first night of their married life at Osborne House, before honeymooning in Paris, Interlaken and Genoa. [Packard, p. 117]\n\nMarried life\n\nHelena and Christian were devoted to each other, and led a quiet life in comparison to Helena's sisters. [Chomet, p. 55] Following their marriage, they took up residence at Cumberland Lodge in Windsor Great Park, the traditional residence of the Ranger of Windsor Great Park, the honorary position bestowed on Christian by the Queen. When staying in London, they lived at the Belgian Suite in Buckingham Palace. [Chomet, p. 133] The couple had six children: Christian Victor in 1867, Albert in 1869, and Princesses Helena Victoria and Marie Louise in 1870 and 1872 respectively. Their last two sons died early; Frederick Harold died eight days after his birth in 1876, and an unnamed son was stillborn in 1877. Princess Louise, Helena's sister, commissioned the French sculptor Jules Dalou to sculpt a memorial to Helena's dead infants. [Packard, p. 192]\n\nThe Christians were granted a parliamentary annuity of £6000 a year, which the Queen requested in person. [Chomet, p. 52] In addition, a dower of £30,000 was settled upon, and the Queen gave the couple £100,000 which yielded an income of about £4000 a year. [Chomet, p. 54] As well as that of Ranger of Windsor Park, Christian was given the honorary position of High Steward of Windsor, and was made a Royal Commissioner for the Great Exhibition of 1851. However, he was often an absentee figurehead at the meetings, instead passing his time playing with his dog Corrie, feeding his numerous pigeons, and embarking on hunting excursions. [Chomet, p. 59]\n\nHelena, as promised, lived close to the Queen, and both she and Beatrice performed duties for her. Beatrice, whom Victoria had groomed for the main role at her side, carried out the more important duties, and Helena took on the more minor matters that Beatrice did not have time to do. [Packard, p. 194] Helena was assisted by her unmarried daughter, Helena Victoria, to whom the Queen dictated her journal in the last months of her life. [Benson, p. 300]\n\nHelena's health was not robust, and she was addicted to the drugs opium and laudanum. [Packard, pp. 269–270] However, the Queen did not believe that Helena was really ill, accusing her of hypochondria encouraged by an indulgent husband. [Packard, p. 193] Queen Victoria wrote to Victoria, Crown Princess of Prussia complaining that Helena was inclined to “coddle herself (and Christian too) and to give way in everything that the great object of her doctors and nurse is to rouse her and make her think less of herself and of her confinement”. [Quoted in Chomet, p. 128] Not all of her health scares were brought on by hypochondria; in 1869, she had to cancel her trip to Balmoral Castle when she became ill at the railway station. In 1870, she was suffering from severe rheumatism and problems with her joints. In July 1871, she suffered from congestion in her lungs, an illness severe enough to appear in the Court Circular, which announced that her illness caused “much anxiety to members of the royal family”. [Quoted in Chomet, p. 129] In 1873, she was forced to recuperate in France as a result of illness, and in the 1880s she travelled to Germany to see an oculist for her eyes.
