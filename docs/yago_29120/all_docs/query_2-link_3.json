        "text": "by Scott Mehl © Unofficial Royalty 2015\n\nPrincess Helena was the fifth child, and third daughter, of Queen Victoria of The United Kingdom and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. She was born at Buckingham Palace in London, England on May 25, 1846. Two months later, on July 25, 1846 she was christened in the Private Chapel at Buckingham Palace with the names Helena Augusta Victoria. Her godparents were:\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm, Hereditary Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (the future Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, husband of Queen Victoria’s cousin, Princess Augusta of Cambridge)\n\nThe Duchess of Orléans (born Helene of Mecklenburg-Schwerin)\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge (her great aunt by marriage, born Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel)\n\nHelena had eight siblings:\n\nVictoria, Princess Royal (1840-1901) married Friedrich III, German Emperor and King of Prussia, had four sons and four daughters\n\nKing Edward VII of the United Kingdom (1841-1910) married Princess Alexandra of Denmark, had 2 sons and 3 daughters\n\nPrincess Alice (1843-1878) married Ludwig IV, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine, had two sons and five daughters\n\nPrince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1844-1900) married Grand Duchess Marie Alexandrovna of Russia, had one son and four daughters\n\nPrincess Louise (1848-1939) married John Campbell, Marquess of Lorne, 9th Duke of Argyll (1845-1914); no children\n\nPrince Arthur, Duke of Connaught (1850-1942) married Princess Louise Margaret of Prussia, had one son and two daughters\n\nPrince Leopold, Duke of Albany (1853-1884) married Princess Helena of Waldeck and Pyrmont, had one son and one daughter\n\nPrincess Beatrice (1857-1944) married Prince Henry of Battenberg, had three sons and one daughter\n\nKnown within the family as Lenchen, Helena’s childhood was spent at her mother’s various homes, in the care of nurses and nannies. An accomplished artist and pianist from a young age, she was often overshadowed in life by her siblings. She was closest to her brother Alfred, and the two remained so for their entire lives. Helena’s life would change drastically in 1861, with the death of her beloved father. She began helping her sister Alice who became an unofficial secretary to their mother. After Alice’s marriage, Helena would continue in this role, along with her younger sister Louise, before the role was primarily taken by her youngest sister, Beatrice.\n\nHelena had a brief romance with Carl Ruland, who had served as her father’s librarian. Of course, when Queen Victoria discovered her daughter’s interest in one of the servants, Ruland was quickly dispatched back to Germany. Victoria then began a quest to find Helena an appropriate husband. It was in May 1865 while visiting Coburg that Helena met her future husband, Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, the son of Christian August, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, and Countess Louise Sophie af Danneskiold-Samsøe. After receiving formal consent from Queen Victoria and agreeing that they would live in the United Kingdom, their engagement was announced on December 5, 1865. As she had done with her other children, Queen Victoria arranged for Parliament to grant Helena an annuity of £6000 per year and a £30,000 dower. She also personally gave the couple £100,000, which provided them an income of about £4000 per year.\n\nThe engagement was not met with unanimous approval within the royal family. The Princess of Wales (formerly Princess Alexandra of Denmark) could not countenance a marriage to someone who, she felt, took the Schleswig and Holstein duchies away from her father King Christian IX of Denmark. The Prince of Wales supported his wife in this. Another of Helena’s sisters, Alice, disapproved as she felt her mother was pushing Helena into this marriage to ensure that Helena would remain near her side. The fact that Christian was fifteen years older than Helena certainly did not help that suggestion. However, Helena was truly in love with Christian and was determined to marry him for her own happiness.\n\nDespite the misgivings of some of her siblings, Helena had the full support and blessing of her mother and the wedding went on as planned. Helena and Christian married on July 5, 1866, in the Private Chapel in Windsor Castle in Windsor, England. Following a brief stay at Osborne House, they set off on a honeymoon in Paris, Interlaken, and Genoa.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Wedding of Princess Helena and Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein\n\nUpon returning from their honeymoon, the couple settled at Frogmore House in Windsor, England, and over the next eleven years, had five children:\n\nPrince Christian Victor (1867-1900) – unmarried\n\nPrince Albert, later Duke of Schleswig-Holstein (1869-1931), unmarried, had an illegitimate daughter\n\nPrincess Helena Victoria (1870-1948) – unmarried\n\nPrincess Marie Louise (1872-1956) – married Prince Aribert of Anhalt (marriage dissolved)), no issue\n\nPrince Harald (born and died1876) – lived 8 days\n\nIn 1872, Helena and her family moved from Frogmore House to Cumberland Lodge in Windsor Great Park. Cumberland Lodge was the traditional home of the Ranger of Windsor Great Park, a position to which Prince Christian had been appointed in 1867. She took a very active role in royal duties and engagements when this was not nearly as common as it is today. Helena was very involved in charity work, particularly nursing. She served as president of the Royal British Nurses Association and was one of the founding members of the British Red Cross. She was also the founding president of the Royal School of Needlework.\n\nIn the late 1870s, Helena suffered several losses. Her young son, Prince Harald, died just 8 days old in 1876, and the following year she would give birth to a stillborn son. The next year, her sister Alice died from diphtheria. Despite their strained relationship at the time of Helena’s marriage, Helena recognized that Alice was looking out for her happiness, and she was devastated by her death. Helena later wrote a forward for a book of letters from Alice to Queen Victoria. The second edition, published in 1885, was titled “Memories of Princess Alice by her Sister, Princess Christian.”\n\nMore tragedy would come at the turn of the century. Her favorite brother Alfred died in July 1900, and in October, her oldest son, Christian Victor, died of malaria in South Africa while serving in the Boer War. The year 1901 would bring the death of her mother Queen Victoria and eldest sister Victoria, The Dowager German Empress.\n\nFollowing Queen Victoria’s death, Helena continued to support the monarchy, although she was not very close with her brother King Edward VII. With King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra now residing at Buckingham Palace, Helena needed a new home in London. Unlike many of her siblings, Helena did not have a separate London home and stayed in the Belgian Suite at Buckingham Palace when she was in London. In August 1902, King Edward VII gave her use of the former De Vesci House at 77-78 Pall Mall in London, England, which had recently been given to the Crown. It soon became known as Schomberg House, and Helena would live there for the rest of her life. Schomberg House would then become the home of Helena’s two daughters until 1947.\n\nHelena and Christian celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary in 1916, the first in the family since King George III and Queen Charlotte in 1811. In July 1917, Helena’s nephew King George V asked his family to relinquish their German titles. Helena’s family dropped the ‘of Schleswig-Holstein’ designation from their titles, and Helena officially became just Princess Christian. Unofficially, she was most often known simply as Princess Helena. Just a few months later, on October 8, 1917, Helena’s husband died at Schomberg House.\n\nPrincess Helena died on June 9, 1923, at Schomberg House in London, England at the age of 77. She was survived by three of her children and three of her siblings. Following her funeral on June 15, 1923, held at St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle in Windsor, England, she was interred in the Royal Crypt at St. George’s Chapel. In 1928, her remains, along with those of her husband and son Harald were moved to the newly established Royal Burial Ground at Frogmore in Windsor, England.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.
