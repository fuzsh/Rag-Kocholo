Despite heavy winds, the two windows of the carriage remained open so the trio could look out upon the enthusiastic faces of their citizens.[4]\n\nIn a May 1867 correspondence, the Queen revealed to Helena's brother Albie that Helena and her husband had since moved to Frogmore, England, affectionately referring to Helena as \"Lenchen\" in the letter.[5]\n\nAppearances[]\n\nAssassin's Creed: Syndicate (mentioned only)"
