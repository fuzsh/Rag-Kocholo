        "text": "Helena Augusta Victoria, born on May 25, 1846, was the third daughter and the fifth child of Queen Victoria and prince consort Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n\nYouth\n\nHelena was a lively and outspoken child. One of her former talents was painting. Like her other sisters, Helena was also skilled in playing the piano, riding horses and sailing.\n\nDeath of Prince Albert\n\nHelena’s father died on December 14, 1861 at the age of 42. Queen Victoria was deeply grieved and a heavy period of mourning began. The entire court moved to Osborne House, on the Isle of Wight. Also the death of Prince Albert was a heavy blow to Helena and she wrote a month later to a friend:\n\nWhat we have lost nothing can ever replace, and our grief is most, most bitter … I adored Papa, I loved him more than anything on earth, his word was a most sacred law, and he was my help and adviser … These hours were the happiest of my life, and now it is all, all over.”\n\nQueen Victoria was pretty selfish about her daughters. Ideally, they should never marry and always stay with her. Alice, Louise and Helena had to perform more and more secretarial tasks, such as writing Victoria’s letters. Helena also helped her mother with political correspondence and spent a lot of time together with her mother.\n\nWedding and family\n\nHelena met Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein during a visit to Coburg in September 1865. The two fell in love and became engaged in December of that year. Queen Victoria gave permission for the marriage on condition that the couple would live in England.\n\nChristian and Helena married on 5 July 1866 in the private chapel of Windsor Castle. Christian and Helena first lived in Frogmore House. Later they moved to Cumberland Lodge in Windsor Great Park.\n\nSix children were born from the marriage:\n\nPrince Christian Victor (1867 – 1900), died during the Boer War\n\nAlbert, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein (1869 – 1931), unmarried\n\nPrincess Helena Victoria (1870 – 1948), unmarried\n\nPrincess Marie Louise (1872 – 1956), married Prince Aribert of Anhalt\n\nPrince Harald (12–20 mei 1876)\n\nAn unnamed stillborn son (17 mei 1877).\n\nPrincess Helena in later life\n\nUntil the death of her mother in 1901, Helena remained at her side, but usually managed to escape her strict control. She was also surrounded by two daughters: Marie Louise and Helena Victoria. Princess Marie Louise married in 1891 with Prince Aribert of Anhalt, a son of Frederik I of Anhalt. The marriage was dissolved again in 1900, after which Marie Louise returned to England, where for 40 years she and her unmarried sister Helena Victoria fulfilled royal obligations for the British royal house.\n\nIn 1899 Helena became the patroness of the Young Women’s Christian Association (YWCA) and the National Society of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and Children. Helena has done a lot to improve the care facilities of England and founded the Princess Christian Nursing Home in Windsor.\n\nPrince Christian died in London at the age of 86 in 1917. Helena a few years later on June 9, 1923. Both were buried at the royal cemetery at Windsor Great Park.\n\nDo you want to see more images of Princess Helena? Have a look at my Pinterest board:"
