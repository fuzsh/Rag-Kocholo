        "text": "A Century of Queens' Weddings\n\nIn this photograph from the 2002 exhibition in London, \"A Century of Queens' Wedding Dresses,\" Queen Victoria's gown is shown in the foreground, and the gown of Queen Elizabeth II is shown in the background in reflection.\n\nVictoria and Albert\n\nWhen Queen Victoria married her cousin Albert on February 11, 1840 at the royal chapel of St. James, she wore a white satin dress, a custom that has been imitated since by many brides, royal and not royal.\n\nVictoria and Albert Again\n\nThere seems little doubt that Queen Victoria loved her husband, Albert. Fourteen years after they married, the two reenacted their wedding so that photographers—not around the first time—could capture the moment.\n\nDetails About Queen Victoria's Wedding Dress\n\nQueen Victoria married her cousin, Albert, in 1840 in this wedding gown, which is here shown in a 2012 exhibition as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrating 60 years since the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The gown, made of silk trimmed with lace, was designed by Mrs. Bettans, one of Victoria's dressmakers.\n\nVictoria, Princess Royal, Marries the Future Emperor Frederick III\n\nQueen Victoria's daughter, also named Victoria, met her future husband in 1851. They were engaged when he was second in line for inheriting the Prussian throne.\n\nTheir engagement was made public in May of 1857, and the couple was married on May 19, 1857. The Princess Royal was seventeen at that time. In 1861, Frederick's father became William I of Prussia, and she became Crown Princess of Prussia and her husband the Crown Prince. It was not until 1888 that William I died and Frederick became the German Emperor, at which time Victoria became The German Empress Queen of Prussia, a position she held for only 99 days before her husband died. Victoria and her husband Frederick were notably liberal in comparison to both his father and their son, William II.\n\nPrincess Alice Marries Ludwig (Louis) IV, Grand Duke of Hesse\n\nQueen Victoria's children and grandchildren intermarried with many of the royal families of Europe. The reception following Alice's 1862 wedding, depicted here, was attended by Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, and the Prince of Wales (Edward VII).\n\nThe couple had seven children. Their daughter Alexandra became the most famous of their offspring as Tsarina of Russia, killed with her family during the Russian Revolution.\n\nPrince Philip, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, is also descended from Alice and her husband, Ludwig.\n\nAlexandra of Denmark Marries Albert Edward, Prince of Wales\n\nPrincess Alexandra Caroline Marie Charlotte Louise Julia of Denmark was the choice to marry the Prince of Wales, Albert Edward, Queen Victoria's second child and eldest son.\n\nFrom a relatively-obscure branch of the Danish royal family, Alexandra's father was promoted to the heir to the throne of Denmark in 1852, when Alexandra was eight. She first met Albert Edward in 1861, introduced by his sister Victoria, then Crown Princess of Prussia.\n\nAlexandra and the Prince of Wales were married at St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle on March 10, 1863.\n\nAlexandra's Wedding Dress\n\nThe small venue of St. George's Chapel in Windsor was chosen in part because of the recent death of Prince Albert, influencing the fashion choices of those attending the wedding: mostly muted tones.\n\nAlexandra and Albert Edward had six children. Albert Edward became King-Emperor of Great Britain in 1901 on the death of his mother, Queen Victoria, and he ruled until his death in 1910. From then until her death in 1925, Alexandra had the official title of Queen Mother, though was usually called Queen Alexandra.\n\nAlexandra and Edward with Queen Victoria\n\nThe husband of Queen Victoria, Prince Albert, died in December of 1861, shortly after their son Albert Edward met his future bride, Alexandra of Denmark.\n\nAlbert Edward did not propose to Alexandra until September of 1862, after he'd ended his relationship with his mistress Nellie Clifden. It would be 1901 before Albert Edward would succeed his mother and rule for a few years—sometimes called the \"Edwardian era\"—as Edward VII.\n\nPrincess Helena and Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein\n\nHelena's marriage to Prince Christian was controversial because his family's claim on Schleswig and Holstein was a matter of contention between Denmark (where Alexandra, Princess of Wales, was from) and Germany (where Victoria, Princess Royal, was Crown Princess).\n\nThe two were engaged on December 5, 1865, and married July 5, 1866. The Prince of Wales, who had threatened not to attend because of his wife's Danish connections, was present to accompany Helena and Queen Victoria up the aisle. The ceremony took place in the private chapel at Windsor Castle.\n\nLike her sister Beatrice and her husband, Helena, and her husband remained close to Queen Victoria. Helena, like Beatrice, served as a secretary to her mother.\n\nHelena served as President of the British Nurses Association, in support of nursing. She and her husband celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary shortly before Christian's death.\n\nPrince Arthur Marries Princess Louise Margaret of Prussia\n\nPrince Arthur of Connaught and Strathearn, Queen Victoria's third son, married Princess Louise Margaret of Prussia, a grand-niece of Prussian Emperor Wilhelm I, on March 13, 1879, at St. George's Chapel at Windsor.\n\nThe couple had three children; the eldest married Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden. Arthur served as Governor-General of Canada from 1911 to 1916 and Princess Louise Margaret, Duchess of Connaught and Strathearn, was styled Viceregal Consul of Canada for that period.\n\nThe father of Princess Louise Margaret (Luise Margarete before she married) was a double cousin of Prussian Emperor Frederick III, who was married to Arthur's sister Victoria, Princess Royal.\n\nLouise, Duchess of Connaught, was the first member of the British Royal Family to be cremated.\n\nBeatrice's Engagement With Prince Henry of Battenberg\n\nFor many years, it looked like Princess Beatrice, born shortly before her father Prince Albert died, would have as her responsibility staying single and being a companion and private secretary to her mother.\n\nBeatrice met and fell in love with Prince Henry of Battenberg. After Queen Victoria initially responded by not speaking to her daughter for seven months, Beatrice persuaded her mother to permit her to marry, and the young couple agreed that they would live with Victoria and Beatrice would continue to assist her mother.\n\nBeatrice Marries Henry of Battenberg\n\nBeatrice wore her mother's wedding veil at her wedding on July 23, 1885, to Prince Henry of Battenberg, who gave up his German commitments to marry Beatrice.\n\nThe two had a short honeymoon because Queen Victoria was unhappy with even such a short separation from Beatrice.\n\nThe Marriage of Beatrice and Henry of Battenberg\n\nBeatrice and Henry stayed with Victoria, traveling only rarely and for short periods without her, during their marriage. The two had four children before Prince Henry died in the Anglo-Asante war, of malaria.
