        "text": "History\n\nMarie Louise was born in 1872, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria. Her dad — clearly a history buff — named her after Napoleon’s second wife, but the family called her “Louie.”\n\nHer parents, Princess Helena and Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, lived at Victoria’s beck and call. Once, when Victoria was watching the kids, she sent Helena a reassuring telegram:\n\n“Children very well, but poor little Louise very ugly.” ¹\n\nLouise inherited her grandmother’s blunt honesty and deep family loyalty.\n\nShe was close with her only sister, Thora, and her cousin, Alix. That cousin would grow up to be the last empress of Russia, Alexandra Feodorovna. In the picture below, you can already see Alix’s brooding intensity (top left) and Louise’s open sincerity (bottom left)."
