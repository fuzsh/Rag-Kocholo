        "text": "Victoria, Princess Royal. Married Prince Frederick William of Prussia\n\nShe was born 21 November 1840 and died 5 August 1901\n\nHer eldest son, Kaiser Willhelm II, was on the opposing side to his cousin King George V of Great Britain during World War One\n\nAlbert, Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII. Married Princess Alexandra of Denmark\n\nBorn 9 November 1841 and died 6 May 1910\n\nHis eldest son, Prince Albert Victor – the Duke of Clarence and Avondale, was linked to the Cleveland Street scandal and was posthumously accused of being Jack the Ripper (there is no evidence for this – court records prove he was not in London on several of the murder dates and he even dined with Queen Victoria on one crucial date)\n\nPrincess Alice. Married Prince Louis of Hesse and the Rhine\n\nBorn 25 April 1843 and died 14 December 1878\n\nQueen Victoria was so revolted that Alice preferred to breastfeed her children, she named one of the royal cows on her estates ‘Princess Alice’. Alice’s daughter, Alexandra (Princess Alix of Hesse), married Tsar Nicholas II and was murdered by the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution\n\nPrince Alfred. Married Marie, Grand Duchess of Russia\n\nBorn 6 August 1844 and died 30 July 1900\n\nKnown as Affie, he enjoyed a Naval career and inherited the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg on the death of his uncle – his brother, the Prince of Wales, having renounced his claim\n\nPrincess Helena. Married Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein\n\nBorn 25 Mary 1846 and died 9 June 1923\n\nHelena and Christian enjoyed a 50-year marriage, the first members of the royal family to reach that milestone since King George III and Queen Charlotte\n\nPrincess Louise. Married John Campbell, Marquis of Lorne\n\nBorn 18 March 1848 and died 3 December 1939\n\nLouise studied at the National Art Training School in Kensington, London and was the first female sculptor to have a statue erected in public – the statue depicted her mother, Queen Victoria\n\nPrince Arthur. Married Princess Louise of Prussia\n\nBorn 1 May 1850 and died 16 January 1942\n\nArthur went to the Royal Military College at Woolwich and enjoyed a full military career. He lived till the age of 91\n\nPrince Leopold. Married Princess Helen of Waldeck-Pyrmont\n\nBorn 7 April 1853 and died 28 March 1884\n\nLeopold was a haemophiliac – the first known sufferer in the royal family and believed to be a genetic mutation from his mother. His sister Alice was a carrier. Her daughter Alix’s son, Tsarevitch Alexis, was also a victim of this cruel disease. Leopold died after a fatal brain haemorrhage resulting from a fall downstairs aged 31\n\nPrincess Beatrice. Married Prince Henry of Battenberg\n\nBorn 14 April 1857 and died 26 October 1944\n\nTwo of Beatrice’s three sons were haemophiliacs and her daughter was a carrier and took the disease into the Spanish royal family\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://www.historyinanhour.com/2014/01/22/victoria-alberts-children/\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/wilhelm_kaiser_ii.shtml\n\nhttp://www.englishmonarchs.co.uk/haemophilia.html\n\nhttps://www.spectator.co.uk/2014/01/the-mystery-of-princess-louise-by-lucinda-hawksley-review/"
