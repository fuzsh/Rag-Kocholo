        "text": "HH Princess Marie Louise\n\n1. Princess Marie Louise, Coronation 1953\n\n2. Princess Marie Louise 1954\n\n3. Princess Marie Louise 1956\n\n​\n\n.. .. . . . . . .... . .\n\n​\n\nRe: Marie Louise from Wikipedia\n\nPrincess Marie Louise\n\nFranziska Josepha Louise Augusta Marie Christina Helena\n\nformerly Princess Marie Louise of Schleswig-Holstein (12 August 1872 – 8 December 1956), a member of the British Royal Family and a granddaughter of Queen Victoria.\n\nPrincess Marie Louise was born at Cumberland Lodge, in Windsor Great Park. Her father was Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, the third son of Duke Christian of Schleswig-Holstein and Countess Louise of Danneskjold-Samsøe. Her mother was The Princess Helena, the fifth child and third daughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Her parents resided in the United Kingdom, and the Princess was considered a member of the British Royal Family. Under letters patent of 1866, she was styled Her Highness Princess Marie Louise of Schleswig-Holstein. She was christened on 18 September 1872. Her godparents were The Emperor of Austria and The Queen of Hanover.\n\nOn 6 July 1891, Princess Marie Louise married Prince Aribert of Anhalt (18 June 1866 – 24 December 1933) at St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle. Prince Aribert was the third son of Frederick I, Duke of Anhalt, and his wife, Princess Antoinette of Saxe-Altenburg. The bride's first cousin, the German Emperor Wilhelm II, had been instrumental in arranging the match.\n\nThe marriage, however, was unhappy and childless. (Years after the fact, it was debated that Aribert was homosexual and had been caught in bed with a servant, either by Marie Louise or his father.) In December 1900, her father-in-law used his prerogative as reigning Duke of Anhalt to annul the marriage. Princess Marie Louise, on an official visit to Canada at the time, immediately returned to Britain. According to her memoirs, she regarded her marriage vows as binding, so she never remarried. Her memoirs do, however, indicate rage over her marital experience and an obvious dislike of her former husband.\n\nAfter the annulment, Princess Marie Louise devoted herself to charitable organizations and patronage of the arts. She inspired the creation of Queen Mary's Dolls' House to showcase the work of British craftsmen. She established the Girl's Club in Bermondsey that served as a hospital during World War I. She was also active in the work of the Princess Christian Nursing Home at Windsor.\n\nIn July 1917, when George V changed the name of the British Royal House from the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to the House of Windsor, he also requested that his numerous cousins and in-laws who were British subjects discontinue using their German titles, styles, and surnames. Never taking other titles or surnames, Princess Marie Louise and her unmarried sister, Princess Helena Victoria, became known simply as \"HH Princess Marie Louise\" and \"HH Princess Helena Victoria,\" giving them the odd distinction of being Princesses but not, apparently, members of any particular Royal Family. This approach differed from the one accepted by George V's other relatives, who relinquished all Princely titles, not just their German designations, and acquired British titles of nobility. Under that precedent, Marie Louise and her sister likely would have been known as \"Lady Marie Louise New Surname\" and \"Lady Helena Victoria New Surname.\" Though their titles as derived from their parents' designations, as bestowed by Queen Victoria, were essentially British, they were not officially Princesses of the United Kingdom. However, their unmarried status and their right to be styled Highness rendered their situations awkward, so that it was easier to allow them to retain their status as Princesses while avoiding the question of immediate family membership altogether.\n\nPrincess Marie Louise attended four coronations in Westminster Abbey, those of Edward VII and Queen Alexandra in 1901; George V and Queen Mary in 1911; George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1937; and Elizabeth II in 1953. In 1956, she published her memoirs, My Memories of Six Reigns. She died at her London home, 10 Fitzmaurice Place, Berkeley Square, a few months later and is buried at Frogmore Royal Burial Ground at Windsor Great Park.\n\nPrincess Marie Louise was a frequent visitor to the Anglican Shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham before the Second World War. A report comes in from a London Vicar saying when she visited that church she saw a shrine of Our Lady and exclaimed “Oh! Our Lady of Walsingham”. Fr. X said: “Have you been there?” “Of course I have! And I am the first of our family to visit it since Henry VIII.”\n\nHH Princess Helena Victoria\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nfrom birth: HH Princess Helena Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein\n\nfrom 1917: HH Princess Helena Victoria\n\nPrincess Helena Victoria in 1920\n\n​\n\nPrincess Helena Victoria\n\nFormerly Princess Helena Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein, a member of the British Royal Family and a granddaughter of Queen Victoria.\n\nFull name: Victoria Louise Sophia Augusta Amelia Helena\n\nHouse: Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg\n\nFather: Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein\n\nMother: Princess Helena of the United Kingdom\n\nBorn: 3 May 1870 at Frogmore House, Windsor\n\nDied: 13 March 1948 (aged 77) at Berkeley Square, London\n\nBurial: Frogmore, Windsor\n\nPrincess Helena Victoria was born at Frogmore House, near Windsor Castle. Her father was Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, the third son of Christian, Duke of Augustenborg and Countess Louise of Danneskjold-Samsøe. Her mother was The Princess Helena, the fifth child and third daughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Her parents resided in the United Kingdom, at Cumberland Lodge, and the Princess was considered a member of the British Royal Family. Under letters patent of 1866, she was styled Her Highness Princess Helena Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nShe spent most of her childhood at Cumberland Lodge, her father's residence as Ranger of Windsor Great Park. Known to her family as \"Thora,\" or sometimes \"Snipe,\" in reference to her sharp facial features. She officially used the names \"Helena Victoria\" out of her string of six Christian names.\n\nPrincess Helena Victoria never married. She followed her mother's example in working for various charitable organizations, most notably the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA), Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) and Princess Christian's Nursing Home at Windsor. During World War I, she founded the YWCA Women's Auxiliary Force. As its president, she visited British troops in France and obtained the permission of the Secretary of State for War, Lord Kitchener, to arrange entertainments for them. Between the world wars, she and her younger sister, Princess Marie Louise, were enthusiastic patrons of music at Schomberg House, their London residence. After a German air raid damaged the house in 1940, the two princesses moved to Fitzmaurice Place, Berkeley Square.\n\nIn July 1917, King George V changed the name of the British Royal House from the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to the House of Windsor. He also relinquished, on behalf of himself and his numerous cousins and brothers-in-law who were British subjects, the use of their German titles, styles, and surnames. Princess Helena Victoria and Princess Marie Louise ceased to use the territorial designation \"of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenberg.\" Instead, they became known simply as \"Her Highness Princess Helena Victoria\" and \"Her Highness Princess Marie Louise,\" giving them the odd distinction of being Princesses but not Princesses of any family or monarchy. Although the two Princesses had borne German titles, they were both quintessentially English.\n\nIn ill health and using a wheelchair after World War II, one of Princess Helena Victoria's last major appearances was at the 20 November 1947 wedding of her first cousin twice removed, the then-Princess Elizabeth, to the then-Lt. Philip Mountbatten, RN.\n\nPrincess Helena Victoria died at Fitzmaurice Place, Berkeley Square. Her funeral took place at St. George's Chapel, Windsor and she was buried at Frogmore Royal Burial Ground, Windsor Great Park.\n\nI am reading Louisa, Lady in Waiting which is about Louisa Grey McDonnell, Countess of Antrim and Lady in Waiting to both Queen Victoria and Queen Alexandra. The Countess of Antrim started service with Queen Victoria the year Louise was married and was invited to the wedding. The book, which is not in novel form but consists of diary entries, short summaries of royal terms of waiting and numerous photographs and mementoes, has the wedding invitation which states that Ladies are to wear Evening Dress Demi-Toilette and Genlemen, Levee Dress.\n\nThe caption under the illustrated portraits of Aribert and Louise state that he tried to divorce her after squandering her dowry. Queen Victoria sent a firm telegram: \"Tell my granddaughter to come home to me. V.R.\"\n\nLouise's sister, Princess Thora as she was commonly known, became great friends with Lady Antrim. Thora often travelled with her grandmother, Queen Victoria, and like Lady Antrim, Thora became a keen cyclist. When the Queen died, the Countess of Antrim was in Canada where her sister was the wife of the Governor-General. Thora wrote to thank the Countess for her kind words: \"I know you of all others would be able to realize what the loss of darling Grandmama is to me.\"\n\nYou are very welcome Katrinna!\n\nVasillos - I love that story of Queen Victoria! I believe Marie's father in law attempted to divorce Marie Louise when she was out of the country and shame her. Victoria put an end to that.\n\nI have read Memories of Six Reigns....and Princess Marie Louise (known to the family as Louie) is a great joy!\n\nIn the book, the Princess recounts a conversation she had with George V and Queen Mary which goes something like this:\n\nP 141. \"Louie, thinking things over, Aribert really did you a good service when he turned you out of house and home. Imagine if you were still in Berlin with this awful war going on. What would you have done?\n\nI prompty answered, \"I should have run away home to England.\"\n\nThe King, with a twinkle in his eye, said, \"Then I should have had to intern you!\"\n\nTo which I replied, \"That would have been indefinitely preferable to remaining in Germany.\"\n\nETA: Interesting to know that she always considered England home. I believe that she had an awful experience living in her husbands homeland."
