The most im- | fortant step of progress in this direction is that taken Hi connection with the Baltimore Belt Line Tunnel, in which the steam locomotives have been discarded, aud powerful electric locomotives, operated on the overhead wire system, adopted to draw heavy trains through the tunnel. This system has proved so successful that in 1896 two 96-ton locomotives were added to the plant. — An underground electric railroad is in operation under the city of London (City and South London line); excavations are being made (1897) for the Waterloo »nd City line, and others are projected in the British metropolis. wheels. The underground system is similarly divided into two methods, the one being a continuous bare conductor placed in a open-slotted conduit, the other a sectional bare conductor similarly placed. The conduit may be placed in the centre of the track, or at its side in connection with one of the rails, as in the 6treet railway system of Budapest. In the first method, par¬ allel conducting wires traverse the conduit and are connected with the terminal wires of the generating dynamo. The current is taken from them by means ot a traveling brush or roller, known as a plow, sled, or shoe, which takes up the current and conveys it to the motor in the car. In the second or sectional method, Fig. 2840. — underground electric railway — single track. Conducting Systems. — Various methods have been tried in the problem of conducting electricity from the •tationary dynamo to the motor in the car, aud also in the application of storage batteries (borne on the car itself) to car propulsion. The method at first tried, that of employing the rail itself as a conductor, soon proved impracticable, despite its ease aud economy of installa¬ tion, both from the difficulty of insulating the conduc¬ tor and the dauger likely to arise from its use. In elevated railways, however, the use of a third insulated rail as a conductor is entirely practicable, arid is the system now generally employed. For street traffic two systems are now in use, the overhead aud the under¬ ground, the former being employed, on account of its superior cheapness, in much the larger number of in¬ stances. The overhead system embraces two varieties; the continuous trolley wire, and the divided or sectional trolley wire method. In the continuous wire method the trolley wire is connected with a number of feeder wires, which in some cases extend from the generating station the whole length of the line, and are connected with it at successive points, or separate feeders extend from the generator to points on the line where they are tapped into the trolley wire. This system is especially employed in suburban districts and small towns. In the divided or sectional wire method the feeders extend the entire length of the line, while the trolley wires are divided into sections, the feeders being connected to the central points or the ends of each section. As em¬ ployed in city streets, the feeders are carried under¬ ground and pass upward throughvthe supporting poles at suitable intervals, being extended from the top of those poles to the central trolley wire. The current is taken from the wire by the aid of a small rolling wheel ortrolley, passing downward through a conducting pole and insulated wires to the motor under the car, whence the current escapes to the rails of the track through the the conducting wire is divided into sections that, on the passage of the car over them, become automatically connected with the generating dynamo. In these sec¬ tional systems, magnets are ingeniously employed to produce the necessary contact. The main conductor passes through the conduit, and is lifted, as the car passes, by the attraction of maguets beneath the car; the conductor being thus brought into contact with short sections of conductive material fixed in the top of the conduit, which become temporarily charged with electricity', and supply it to the motor. When the car passes, the conductor, no longer attracted, sinks, aud the contact-sections lose their charge. In order to regulate the speed of electric cars, various devices are employed, consisting of rheostats, or resistances, introduced \"into the circuit or removed from it by means of a hand lever. To change the direction of the car’s motion, the motor must be made to reverse its direction of rotation. This is done by the aid of some reversing gear which shifts the commutation brushes or otherwise effects the purpose. Storage Battery System. — The storage system has important advantage in principle over the trolley sys¬ tem, each car carrying its own source of power and acting independently of all others, while all the com¬ plex arrangement of conducting and feeding wires, and of specially laid and connected rails can be dispensed with. In this system, each car is provided with a set or battery of storage cells, placed under the seats of the car; or these are placed in a separate locomotive. They are charged again, when near exhaustion, at dynamos suitably sit¬ uated, the removal of the batteries and their replacement by fresh ones being quickly performed. The advantages of thi* syetem are counterweighted with serious disadvantages which have prevented its wide introduction. These are the weight of the batteries, the cost of renewing them when injured by rough treatment on the road, and the lack of effectiveness as compared with the trolley system. These drawbacks have hitherto pre¬ vented any general introduction of the storage battery system, it being employed only in cities where there is legal prevention of the use of the overhead trolley. In New York city, where the overhead wire is pro¬ hibited by law, steps are now (1897) being taken for the introduction of the underground system for the surface street railways. Practical Application. — The current is supplied from the station dynamos, through the copper trolley wire to the motors, at a potential of SOU volts, the strength of current varying to meet the work required on each particular road or system of roads. Ordinarily, the trolley wire is suspended over the center of the track from poles planted at the side of the street, by means of cross wires, which are insulated from the trolley wires except where utilized for feed purposes. In suburban districts the feed wires are carried over¬ head, mounted on glass insulators carried on the poles. But for ordinary street surface roads they are buried underground in conduits and are much more thoroughly insulated. The trolley pole, which rises from the top of the car and carries the contact wheel, is pivoted and pressed upward by a spring, which keeps the trolley uniformly in contact with the wire, whose current is carried down through metallic conductors to the motors, which are flexibly suspended on the car trucks, one end of the motor being pivoted to the axle and the other suspended by springs from the car frame. This mode of suspension is required to prevent shocks to the motor that might damage the insulation of the wires. The current from the motor armature is conveyed to the axle by suitable conducting methods, and thence passes to the wheels and tracks. To drive an ordinary 16-foot car, two 15 horse-power motors are employed, one attached to each axle and connected in series. In practice the generator should be able to furnish from 20 to 25 horse-power for each car used, in order to provide sufficient reserve power for contingencies. Under aver¬ age conditions a car uses about 1 horse-power per car mile per hour. As regards the attainable speed, it is claimed to go far beyond that to be had from steam locomotives, and it is said that 130 miles an hour have been attained experimentally. — Generators and Motors. As the principle of operation of the motor by which electric cars are driven is not generally understood, some brief explanation of it is in place here. The principle involved in the generator is explained under Dynamo-Electric Machines (5. v.), and only a partial restatement of it is here demanded. In the dynamo, the electric current is produced in the coils of an arma¬ ture which is made to revolve with great rapidity before or between the poles of a powerful electro-magnet, steam or hydraulic power being usually employed to rotate the armature. Themotionofthe armature isstrongly resisted by the attraction of the magnet, and a powerful force is required to overcome this resistance, which is sufficient to considerably retard the motion of rotation. The steam power is employed in overcoming the resistance, ti Fig. 2841. — UNDERGROUND ELECTRIC RAILWAY — DOUBLE TRACK. 1058 ELEC ELEC ELEC which acts upon the molecules or atoms of the armature, and causes the lost power of rotation to be changed iuto some form of molecular or atomic vibration. The form produced is that known as electric current. This cur¬ rent possesses au energy equivalent to that of the steam or other power exhausted iu its production, and its outflow over the conducting wire is equivalent to the transfer of this quantity of energy to a distant point, — in this instance to the armature of the car motor. This motor is a dynamo precisely similar in principle to the $enerating dynamo, though differing in form to meet die requirements of the situation. The current gener¬ ated in the primary armature, in its passage through the motor armature, has the effect to cause this to rotate in turn, through the action upon it of its electric mag¬ nets; the energy fed into it by the current being thus converted iuto mechanical energy. It would appear that the passage of the electric current through the armature coil energizes the attraction upon the coil of the neigh¬ boring magnets, and causes the portions of the coil energized to move foward the magnetic poles, the arma¬ ture moving in an opposite direction to that given to the generating armature, the process being essentially a restoration of the original conditions. The motion thus given the armature is derived irom the electric energy of the current, which is converted back again, through the magnetic attraction, from molecular to mass motion, the armature revolving with an energy equivalent — except for certain items of loss — to that given the generator armature. All electric motors, therefore, depend for their operation on the tendency of a conductor carrying a current to move in a magnetic field ; or, in other words, on the action of electric attrac¬ tion and repulsion on such a conductor. In all cases the rotation is in such a direction as to induce in the armature an electro-motive force opposed to that of the driving current; therefore called the counter electro¬ motive force. This force exerts a resisting influence and opposes the passage of the driving current until, when a certain maximum speed is attained, very little current passes. Iu practice, however, this maximum speed is not attained ; a small current is expended in overcoming friction iu the bearings, air friction, &c. When the load is placed on the motor, or work required to be done by it, the speed is reduced aud the counter electro-motive j force decreased, thus permuting a greater current to I pass. The fact that the load thus regulates the’ current automatically, renders electric motors very economical in operation. Electric Repul'sion. The driving apart, by a seeming repulsive force, of two bodies containing a similar electric charge, or of two wires of an electric circuit whose currents are flowing in opposite direc¬ tions. It is opposed to electric attraction , which takes place between opposite electric charges, and between two wires whose currents are flowing in the same direc¬ tion. Electric Resist'ance. All substances, even the best conductors, resist the passage of electricity in some degree, while certain dielectrics resist it almost abso¬ lutely. Gases offer very high resistance to the flow of a current. Liquids are a1 so much more resistant than solids, with the single exception of mercury. Solids vary greatly in this particular, metals usually having small resistance; no two are alike. Silver has the smallest of all known resistances. — Resistances, as they are denominated, are often placed in an electric circuit to produce some special effect. They consist of coils, strips, bars, or spirals of metal, plates of carbon, metallic powders, liquids, etc. The effect of resistance is a con¬ version of electric energy into heat, yielding iucaudes- cence if toe resistance be considerable. The incandescent light is the res ilt of the high resistance of the carbon filament. Heat increases the resistance of nearly all metallic conductors, but it decreases that of the carbon of an incandescent lamp. The electric resistance of dielectric and n m-conductors generally decreases with increase of temperature. Electric Shock. The physiological effect produced in an animal by the electric discharge. It is much employed iu electro-therapeutics for curative purposes. A severe shock, like that of the lightning stroke, is often followed by death; though this is not due to the shock, but to the disrupting effects of the discharge. Electric Spark. See Electric Discharge. Electric Stor'age Bat'tery. The subject of elec¬ tric storage is referred to in several of the accompany¬ ing articles, and the use of the storage battery in power propulsion is mentioned under Electric Railway. A description of the principle involved in this so-called storage of electricity is here proposed. A storage bat¬ tery is composed of a number of storage cells, so arranged as to work in unison. A storage cell is com¬ posed of two plates of metal, or of metallic compounds, immersed in an electrolytic liquid, which lias no power of acting on them to any important extent until after their surface chemical conditions have been changed by the passage of an electric current from one plate to the other. The simplest storage cell is that of Plante, the discoverer of electric storage. As originally con¬ structed, this consists of two plates of lead immersed in dilute sulphuric acid. Through the cell, as thus com¬ posed, a current of electricity is passed, one plate serv¬ ing as the positive and the other as the negative pole of the electrolytic arrangement. As a result, decompo¬ sition of lead takes place and lead peroxide (PbOa) isj formed and deposited on the positive plate, while finely divided, spongy lead is formed on the negative plate. The cell is now charged with stored electricity, to use the common phrase; though what has really taken place is the production of dissimilar chemical condi¬ tions in the two plates, the resulting arrrangement being one capable of setting up galvanic action, with the production of an electric current iu a reverse direc¬ tion to the originating current. As a result, when the charging current ceases, and an interior circuit between the plates is formed, electric action begins, the peroxide of lead (PbOj) giving up one of its oxygen atoms, which makes its way to the spongy lead on the other plate and converts it into monoxide of lead (PbO). The final result is that both plates become covered litharge have been employed. They have the advan. tage of a greater storage capacity per unit weight than I where a grid is used, but their resistance is greater.! A storage battery is composed of a number of these I cells held together in a suitable receptacle, and so I arranged that their conducting wires form a single circuit, and their sum of energy is combined. They do not in any sense store electricity, but the term is con-* 1 venient and has been retained. One or more storage bat. teriesmay be employed in the running ot a street car or for other purpose. One advantage which they possess is that electricity which is being developed, but is tempor¬ arily not in use, may be employed iu charging storage cells for subsequent use, its waste being thus avoided. Electric Tar' get. Au ingenious device whereby an ! indicator dial at the shooting stand records, by means of electricity, the exact effect of each shot that bits the target. The latter is divided into radial sections, the ; bull’s eye consisting of four of these. Push-buttons i form the face of the sections, having bolts projecting rearward, each bolt being encircled by a spiral spring | Fig. 2842. — waddell-enz storage battery. with the monoxide and, being similar in condition, the chemical action ceases. While the activity continues an electric current passes through the circuit in an opposite direction to that of the charging current, and this current is capable of being utilized for power pro¬ duction or other purposes. To increase the capacity of storage cells, the charging current is sent through them alternately in both directions, charging and discharg¬ ing, until the plates have been acted upon to a consider¬ able depth, and as large a coating of lead monoxide as possible produced. By this means the time of their discharge is prolonged. The chemical action above stated is not the only one which takes place, but simply the final result of the action, hydrated sulphate of lead being intermediately formed, aud then decomposed. The original Plante cell has been superseded by one in which the lead plates are replaced by metallic plates covered with a surface layer of red lead (Pb304). On charging these the Pb304 is converted iuto Pb02 at the (2). The indicator dial is correspondingly divided into sections, and connected by wire with the target. The impact of a bullet on one of the push-buttons drives back Its connected bolt, on the end of which is a con¬ ducting plate. At the same instant a plunger is pro- j jected in the corresponding section of the indicator. ■ An electric bell may be included in the circuit, ringing at the same time any one of the plungers is released. Electric Tel'pberage. The system known as tel-; pherage was first devised by Professors Fleeming Jenkin, ; Ayrton and Perry, as a ready means of transport for minerals across uneven country, over which their car- ! riage by road would be tedious and expensive. The first telpher line erected was as Glynde, near Lewes, England, in 1886. It was about a mile long and was used to transport clay from a pit to a railway, so as to avoid its carriage over intervening fields and water, j One was subsequently erected in Cornwall to convey minerals from a mine over a piece of difficult country. This system lias also been used for the transportation I of logs (Fig. 2844). The conducting wires are sms. Fig. 2844. — electric transportation of logs. • * anode, and deoxidized, or converted into metallic lead, at the cathode. Or, in other cases, red lead is placed on the anode and litharge (PbO) on the cathode. By this means the time required for charging is decreased. The plates are perforated or otherwise made irregular on the surface, that they may the better support the active material, which is held in place by being com¬ pressed iuto the apertures or boles. Such a plate is known as a grid, front its bearing some resemblance to a gridiron. Recently, plates composed of compressed pended in the air on posts, or otherwise, and on these run small electric motors which take directly from the wires the current necessary to set them in motion. From the travelling motors are suspended carriages for the transport of the load to be moved. Two lines are provided, an up and doum line, each being in segments, the alternate segments being insulated from each other, but in electric connection through cross-pieces on the supporting posts. The carriages are connected in trains long enough to touch two segments at once and thus ELEC ELEC ELEC 1059 carry the current from one segment to the nest one. Where a current can be generated by water-power, a telpherage line is useful and economical ; but the system has as yet been little employed. Electric Weld'ing. Metals may be united by the use of electric heat with a rapidity and perfection un¬ equalled in any other process. In this system of electric welding, as devised by Prof. Eliliu Thomson, the metals are heated to incandescence by currents obtained from transformers, aud are then caused to combine by pres¬ sure or hammering. In the dynamo employed for this purpose no commutator is used, the alternating cur¬ rents being well adapted for heating purposes. There¬ fore, the terminals of the dynamo can be directly con¬ nected to the clamps that hold the bar to the welder. A step-down transformer (see Electric Current) inter¬ venes and reduces the voltage greatly while correspond¬ ingly increasing the current strength, which may, for short intervals, be augmented to thousands of amperes. The welding process consists in conducting the current into the piece to be united through their points of junction when brought into firm contact. As the cur¬ rent crosses the junction, the resistance to its passage causes a great rise in temperature, sufficient to soften Fig. 2845. — electric welding. Showing clamps, conducting wires, and point of contact. the metal, when the pieces are firmly pressed together by the motion of the clamps or holders. The pieces are prepared for the process by being made 6liglitly convex i at their junctions, so that they touch at but a single 1 point or narrow space, near their centers. The welding heat is first reached at this point of contact, and as the x pressure is applied the softened metal yields and newr parts of the area come into contact, until all the surface is at welding temperature. This process is remarkable for its rapidity, only a few seconds being needed to pro¬ duce union in small work, and only a few minutes for large work. The heating is local, extending but a short distance from the immediate area of contact, so that there is a marked saving in heat. Electric welding is somewhat widely employed in manufacturing opera¬ tions, in some cases where large masses of metal are involved. Pipes, steel rails, and heavy projectiles and guns have thus been welded ; and rails having been united in this way, after being laid in position in rail¬ road construction. Elee'trieal, a. Of or pertaining to electricity or electric science and appliances. Electrical Agriculture. Numerous experiments have been made of late years to ascertain the influence of electricity on the growth of plants, with very interesting Tesults. It has been shown that both atmospheric and terrestrial electricity are highly favorable to the germ¬ ination of seeds and the increase of plant tissue. The electricity of the atmosphere has been conducted down¬ ward by the use of tall collecting poles and conducting wires which ramify through the soil. The use of this device is claimed by some to increase the productivity of a given area by 50 per cent. Prof. Spechneff, of Kiev, by the use of such an arrangement, condensed atmospheric electricity over an enclosed area, with the result that the ordinary grain crops showed an increase of from 28 to 56 per cent, in weight of grain, and from 16 to 60 per cent, in weight of straw. Potatoes showed an increase of 11 per cent. By electrifying the earth the root harvest was made 4 times greater, and that of the leaves 2 or 3 times. He also tried the effect of elec¬ trifying the seeds before planting, and found that when subjected to the current for only 2 minutes their rapidity of growth was nearly doubled. The experi¬ ment stations of the U. S. have tried the effect of the electric light on garden vegetables with varied results. Some of these vegetables were injured or spoiled. On carrots, peas, cress, spinach, and some other plants, the results were not fully satisfactory. Lettuce was re¬ markably stimulated, but it was found injurious to expose it continually to the light. In truth, the expos¬ ure of plants to the electric light at night, while largely increasing their growth, is not considered beneficial, plants apparently needing periodical periods of rest. One experimenter found, with the use of continuous electric light on Alpine plants, that they presented points of structure identical with those of Arctic plants which grow under the rays of the midnight sun. It has been found that flowers under the influence of electricity bloom much sooner and show finer and more brilliant coloring than under ordinary conditions. Glass, however, must always be interposed between the light and the plant, as the naked light is too bright, and is found to injure the foliage. What will be the ultimate result of these experiments it is too soon to say. They may lead to an important development in agriculture, or may prove to yield unfavorable results not yet determined. It seems entirely probable that the artificial stimulus of nature’s processes, by means of collected electrical forces, will be surely followed by a reaction corresponding to that which affects animate beings after alcoholic or tonic stimulation, so that at the end there will be no net gain in vitality or pro¬ ductiveness.

Elec'trical Purilica'tion of Sew'age. The first efforts to purify sewage were made in 1762. since which date the question of the best method of effecting this has occupied the attention of scientific men. Many methods have been tried, with a certain amount of , success, though none of them fully satisfactory,; and a few years ago Mr. Webster, an English scientist, began to experiment upon the effect of currents of electricity on sewage matter. His experiments proved so encour¬ aging that he obtained permission from the authorities to set up an experimental plant at the Crossness outfall of the London sewage system. He erected here a plant large enough to act on a million gallons a day. The system consists in a long brick or cement shoot or con¬ duit, suspended in which are a number of cast-iron plates placed lengthwise, so that the sewage flow passes between them. Half these plates are connected to the positive and half to the negative poles of a dynamo which yields a large current of low potential. As thej sewage flows slow ly between the iron plates, the electric current acts on it, the visible effect being the giving off of bubbles of gas, and the gathering of a quantity of muddy matter on the top of the liquid. Some portion of the iron plate connected with the positive pole is dissolved, and powerful oxidizing bodies are formed in the liquid, which rapidly convert the dangerous nitro¬ genous substances into harmless compounds. Compli¬ cated chemical changes take place, which are not yet fully understood. After flowing through the shoots, the liquid passes into reservoirs, where it is left for two or three hours. The mud settles to the bottom, and the liquid is pumped into the river, it being now perfectly harmless. It has been found, by using 27 horse-power of electrical energy, that a million gallon* of sewage can be purified in 24 hours. The amount of iron dis¬ solved is about two grains per gallon of sewage; or, for purifying a million gallons daily, about 70 tons per year. Plates cast direct from blast furnaces are pure enough to answer the purpose. The advantage of this system is in its yielding a perfectly pure effluent, and a smaller deposit of mud than is the case where the sewage is treated with chemical substances. Electrical Transmission of Power. The transmission of the power of water-falls or oilier source* of power, by means of the dynamo and conducting wire! to distant stations, has greatly developed of recent years, practical results having been achieved w hich 20 years ago were looked upon as mere scientific possibilities. The difficulty in the way of profitable power transmission has been the resistance and loss of power in the con¬ ductor, which, under former circumstances, was so great as to practically exhaust the power sent into the wire. It was early perceived that, to avoid tills source of lose as much as possible, currents of high potential must be employed, the resistance being in this way reduced to a minimum. In the experiments made by Deprez, at the Munich Exhibition in 1862, continuous currents of 2.000 volts were employed. But great difficulties with the working of the dynamos and motors stood in the way of rapid progress in this direction, tiie dynamos of that day being unable to withstand the severe strain put upon them. The distance over which it was sought to transmit power was 37 miles, the loss ot power in this distance being 50 percent. Since that period the intro¬ duction of alternating currents of high tensi m, the im¬ provements in dynamos for the production of such cur¬ rents, the invention of transformers, and the experience gained in the insulation of conductors have overcome these difficulties to a striking degree, and made the economical transmission of power over long distances practical and satisfactory. The first clear demonstra¬ tion of this was made at the electrical exhibition at Frankfort-on-the-Main. At Lauffen, a village 1U7 miles from Frankfort, the river Neekar yields 1,600 horse¬ power, of which 600 was employed in manufacturing, leaving 1,000 unemployed. It was decided to trausmit a portion of this power to Frankfort and in this way test the efficiency of this process. The method adopted w as the only one in which success could have been attained. It was proposed to transmit the current at a pressure of 15 000 volts, and, as it was not an easy matter to construct dynamos that could yield electricity at so high a pressure, the current was geneiated at 50 volts, transformed in Lauffen to 15,000 volts, and in Frank¬ fort transformed down again to 100 volts for use in motors, lamps, etc. The wire was very carefully in¬ sulated, the rotary or multiphase current was used instead of the ordinary alternating current, and the highly encouraging result produced of the transmission of 74 per cent, of the generated current. (The term rotary, rotating , multiphase, or polyphase current is applied to one that results from the combination of a number of alternating currents, whose phases of alter¬ nation do not coincide. In practice, three alternating currents are combined.) The success of this experi¬ ment has led to a number of large transmission plants. In Europe the most important one is at the city of St. Etienne, France, where there is a very considerable water power. A highly successful experiment was that made at Sacramento, California, in 1895, the electricity generated by the falls of the American river at Folsom being taken to that city, 24 miles away. There is at Folsom an immense irrigation reservoir, a portion of whose waters have been employed to drive four great dynamos of 1,000 horse-power each, the largest in the world except at Niagara. The potential is raised from 7,000 to 10,000 volts by “step-up” transformers. A very large percentage of the power reaches Sacra¬ mento, where it is employed to move trolley cars, yield light and heat, and for other purposes. Far the greatest result of this newly developed system, however, is the enormous power plant at Niagara, where a portion of the water above the falls is diverted into a canal 250 feet wide and 12 deep, and carried to great turbines placed at a great depth beneath the surface at a point below the falls. These turbines each develop 5,000 horse-power, the whole plant being calculated to yield 100,000 horse¬ power. They are used to run immense dynamos, each of 5,000 horse-power, developing about 2,000 volts. The power developed is largely employed at Niagara, but a considerable portion of it is transmitted to Buffalo, where it is used for street railway motors and othei purposes. Ten of these great generators were installed, giving a capacity of 50,0n0 horse-power, or half the total capacity of the canal. In 1901 this company made a large extension of its plant, and is now the largest elec¬ trical transmission company in the world. The St. Lawrence Power Co., at Massena Springs, N. Y., has iu view a 150,000 horse-power plant. Eleetrical U'nits. There are two series of units known in electrical science, the absolute and practical. Absolute units are based on the centimeter for the unit of length, the gramme for the unit of mass, and the second for the unit of time, and are generally termed the centimeter-gramnie-second (C. G. S.) units. The practical units are multiples or fractions of the above, and have been introduced because the absolute units are either too small or too large for actual use. The practi¬ cal units have been named from famous electricians, as Ampere, Coulomb, Faraday, Ohm, Ac., and are the fol¬ lowing: The ampere is the practical unit of electric current, and is such a current or transmission of elec¬ tricity as would pass with an electro-motive force of one volt through a circuit with a resistance of one ohm; or a current of strength sufficient to deposit .006084 grain of copper per second. If comparison be made with a stream of water, the ampere is the unit rate of flow, or the number of cubic inches of flow per second. That which causes the flow is the pressure or head of water, equivalent to the electro-motive force, while the resist¬ ance is equivalent to the friction of the water, which varies with varying circumstances. The coulomb is the unit of electric quantity, or a fixed amount of the thing I0G4 ELEC ELEC ELEC called electricity, and is measured by the quantity of electricity that would pass in a second in a circuit whose resistance is one ohm and electro-motive force one volt. It is thus equivalent to an ampere,' but differs in repre¬ senting quantity, while the ampere represents energy , or current flow. A farad is the practical unit of elec¬ tric capacity, and represents such a capacity of a con¬ ductor or condenser that it requires a coulomb of electricity to produce in it one volt of electro-motive force or difference of potential. Electricity acts as if it were a very compressible gas, so that the quantity required to fill any condenser is not always the same, but depends on the electro-motive force with which it enters the condenser. A henry is the practical unit of self-induction, or the counter current which a conductor induces in itself when making and break¬ ing. A joule is the unit of heat developed by the passage of a current of one ampere through a resist¬ ance of one ohm. The ohm is the unit of electric resistance. It represents a resistance capable of limit¬ ing the flow of electricity under one volt of electro¬ motive force to a current of one ampere or a quantity »f one coulomb per second. It is equivalent to a definite retarding force of friction in a stream of water. A volt is the practical unit of electro-motive force, and is a force capable of settingup a current of one ampere against a resistance of one volt; or of charging a con¬ denser of one farad capacity with one coulomb of elec¬ tricity. A watt is the unit of electric power, and is Equivalent to a volt-ampere, or the combination of cur¬ rent and pressure. It represents the power developed when 44 25 foot pounds of work are done per minute. As a volt-ampere equals a watt, so a volt-coulomb equals a joule. The absolute of current is equal to 10 amperes ; of quantity to 10 coulombs; of capacity to 1,000,000,000 farads ; ®f resistance to nnuR?stnroa ohms ; and of electro¬ motive force to xvvishvwTI volts. Elec'trically, adv. In the manner of electricity, or by means of it. Elec'tricalncss, n. Quality of being electrical. Electri'cian, n. A person who studies or is versed in the science of electricity. Electric'ity, n. [Fr. electricity; Sp. electriciddd ; It. elettricita, from Lat. electrum; Gr. electron, amber.] (Physics.) One of the great forces of nature; also that branch of physical science which lias sprung from the investigation of phenomena depending on this particular force. The term is derived from the Greek elektron, amber, in which substance the property of at¬ tracting light bodies after friction was first observed. The fact that certain bodies, when rubbed, acquire the power of attracting light particles of matter, was known to the ancients. Thales, of Miletus, developed this prop¬ erty in amber 600 years before the Christian era, and concluded that the substance was animated by an un¬ known spirit or element. Theophrastus, 6ome centuries later, observed the same attractive property in a crystal termed the lyncurium, now supposed to be the tour¬ maline. Pliny and other naturalists refer to the at¬ tractive power of amber as something well known, but say nothing to lead us to suppose that their knowledge of electrical phenomena went beyond the discoveries of the old philosophers. The first attempt toward a general¬ ization of electrical phenomena was made toward the close of the lGth century, by Dr. Wm. Gilbert, in a treatise on the magnet. In the following century. Dr. Wall, Boyle, Newton and others, accumulated many new facts ; but these were not of a nature to lead to the discovery of general principles. The electric spark was first noticed by Dr. Wall. In the early part of the 18tli century, Dr. Hawksbee made many electrical experi¬ ments, from which he ascertained that glass is a sub¬ stance which can bo readily electrified by friction ; and that some other bodies, especially metals, treated in the same manner, appeared to manifest no electrical power whatever. In 1728, Mr. Stephen Grey, a pensioner at the Charter House, performed a number of experiments, which led to the discovery of electrical conduction, and to the classification of bodies into conductors and non¬ conductors. The conclusions arrived at by Grey were firmly established by the researches of Dufay, a French philosopher, to whom we are indebted for the discovery that there are two opposite states of electrical excitation, in which forces are developed attractive of each other. In 1745 and 1746, numerous attempts were made to con¬ fine electricity in glass vessels containing water or mer¬ cury; and, almost simultaneously, Von Kleist, in Ger¬ many, and Cuneeus, in Holland, became acquainted with the disagreeable effects of the electric shock. Musschen- broek, of Leyden, repeated the experiments of Cunteus, and published a report of the effects of the shock re¬ ceived from the apparatus, which is still known as the Leyden jar, or vial. The discoveries of Franklin fol¬ lowed soon after, and greatly advanced the science of electricity. By a series of beautiful experiments with a common kite, this celebrated philosopher ascertained, what had been before conjectured, that lightning is an electrical phenomenon. Cavendish afterward entered with great 6pirit into the field of electrical research, and thoroughly investigated the conditions of bodies charged with electricity. About the year 1789, Galvani, of Bologna, discovered that the mere contact of metals with the muscles and nerves of a frog, recently killed, produced convulsive motions; and by repeating Galvani’s experiments, the celebrated Volta, of Pavia, discovered the apparatus now known as the voltaic pile, which discovery gave rise to a new branch of electrical science called galvanism (q. v.), or voltaic electricity. Davy’s researches proved that the voltaic current is a most potent agent in chemical analysis. In 1820, Oersted discovered that the current exerts a peculiar influence on the magnetic needle, and founded the science, soon afterward fully developed by Ampere, of electro-magnetism (q.v.). Faraday, in his “ Experimental Researches in Electricity,” published between 1830 and 1840, described the phenomena of volta-electric and magneto-electric induction, and thus established the beautiful science of magneto-electricity (q. ».). Seebeck, of Berlin, found that an electric current may be generated by the tin- equal effect of heat on different metals in contact, and to the new branch of science which sprung from this observation he gave the name thermo-electricity (q. v.). These are but a few of the many experiments and dis¬ coveries made in the first half of the nineteenth century, during which a large number of able physicists devoted themselves to this subject. The peculiar power called electricity is known to us only by its effects, and such terms as electric current , and electric fluid are to be under¬ stood as figurative. Many theories respecting electricity have been advanced for the purpose of explaining elec¬ trical phenomena. That of Dufay and Symmer sup¬ poses electricity to be an infinitely attenuated fluid pervading all bodies, and composed of two primary elements possessing distinct and opposite properties. These elements, called vitreous and resinous electricities, are supposed to neutralize each other when combined, electrical repose being the result. When, however, a disunion of these elements takes places, each becomes active. In accordance with this theory, electrical ex¬ citation consists in a separation and abstraction of one of the elements, leaving the other in excess or uncom¬ pensated. The theory started by Franklin supposes the existence of a single homogeneous imponderable fluid of extreme tenuity and elasticity, in a state of equable distribution throughout the material world. This fluid is assumed to be repulsive of its own particles, but attractive of all other matter. When distributed in bodies, in quantities proportionate to their capacities or attraction for it, such bodies are said to be in their natural state. When we increase or diminish the natural quantity of electricity in any substance, ex¬ citation is the result, and the substance, if over-charged, is said to be electrified positively, or, if under-charged, negatively. The theories of Eales and Cavendish are less defective than those of Dufay and Franklin, upon which they are respectively based ; but even these are now found to be inadequate for the elucidation of elec¬ trical phenomena. Adopting the views of Faraday, scientific men of all nations now recognize two kinds of electrical force, distinguished by the terms positive and negative, but do not assume the existence of any peculiar kind of matter to which the term electric fluid may be applied. By frictional electricity we distinguish that portion of this subject which relates to the phen¬ omena of ordinary electricity from those comparatively new sciences referring to the phenomena attendant on electrical excitation by chemical action, magnetism and heat. The fundamental principles of electricity are illustrated by the electric p"
