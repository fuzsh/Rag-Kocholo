We help unite every department to better focus on customers with Customer 360, the world’s #1 CRM.\n\nWe allow everyone, on every team, to share a single source of truth with integrated collaboration capabilities that guide essential conversations and decisions right where people work. And with Tableau, we help companies uncover deep insights and take data-driven actions to better serve their customers.\n\nThe cloud was born. In 1999, four Salesforce founders, working shoulder to shoulder in a small San Francisco apartment, launched a customer relationship management (CRM) system with a groundbreaking twist. All the software and critical customer data would be hosted on the internet and made available as a subscription service. This pioneering “software as a service,” or SaaS, model quickly spread across the technology industry.\n\nEarly adopters of our cloud-based model took a significant leap of faith. There was only one formula for earning their trust — that is, by building trusted relationships. Over the decades, our product has grown in scale and sophistication.\n\nWe now provide essential services to many of the world’s biggest and most critical businesses, governments, and organizations. Trust is an ever more valuable commodity. Relationships are gold.\n\nWe are passionate proponents of stakeholder capitalism, committed to doing well by all our stakeholders — our customers, employees, partners, communities, the planet, and society as a whole.\n\nAnd we lead by example, spearheading initiatives in philanthropy, racial equality and justice, climate action and advocacy, and the ethical and humane use of technology.\n\nA win-win-win approach.\n\nOur founders launched the 1-1-1 model, which commits 1% of our equity, our technology, and our peoples’ time to improving education, equality, and the environment for everyone. Today, more than 18,000 companies worldwide have joined us in our Pledge 1% movement."
