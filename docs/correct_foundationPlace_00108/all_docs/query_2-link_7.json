These five values shape our culture, influence who we are, what we do, and even who we hire. They're hard-wired into our DNA and will stay the same as we continue to grow.\n\nWe take 'Don't #@!% the Customer' seriously because our customers are the reason why we do what we do. It's even why we price our products so every company can afford them. They inspire us, challenge us, and in turn, help us build better products.\n\nWorking Open\n\nWe believe all teams have the potential to do amazing things when work is Open.\n\nMuch of the world works, often unwittingly, in a closed way. Information is hidden or lost, bonds between teams and teammates are weak, and perspectives are withheld. The result? People burn out. Knowledge is wasted. Potential is left on the table. Forward progress is halted. This is why Open matters. This is why we do what we do at Atlassian.\n\nOpen work has always been central to our values. It's in the DNA of our products and we bring it to life through our practices. But it doesn't just happen. Our teams make an effort to work, communicate, and collaborate openly every day to lead by example.\n\nOpen unlocks new opportunities. Open brings us together. Open unleashes potential."
