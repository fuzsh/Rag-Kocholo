        "text": "Definition\n\nAmazon\n\nBy\n\nKinza Yasar, Technical Writer\n\nIvy Wigmore\n\nWhat is Amazon?\n\nAmazon (Amazon.com) is the world's largest online retailer and a prominent cloud service provider.\n\nOriginally started as an online bookselling company, Amazon has morphed into an internet-based business enterprise that is largely focused on providing e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming and artificial intelligence (AI) services.\n\nFollowing an Amazon-to-buyer sales approach, the company offers a monumental product range and inventory, enabling consumers to buy just about anything, including clothing, beauty supplies, gourmet food, jewelry, books, movies, electronics, pet supplies, furniture, toys, garden supplies and household goods.\n\nHeadquartered in Seattle, Amazon has individual websites, software development centers, customer service centers, data centers and fulfillment centers around the world.\n\nHistory and timeline of Amazon\n\nAmazon has come a long way since it was founded by Jeff Bezos in his garage in Bellevue, Wash., on July 5, 1994.\n\nThe following is a brief history and timeline of events that have evolved Amazon from its humble beginnings to a multinational business empire.\n\nThe 1990s\n\nAmazon officially opened for business as an online bookseller on July 16, 1995. Originally, Bezos had incorporated the company as Cadabra but later changed the name to Amazon. Bezos is said to have browsed a dictionary for a word beginning with A for the value of alphabetic placement. He selected the name Amazon because it was exotic and different and as a reference to his plan for the company's size to reflect that of the Amazon River, one of the largest rivers in the world. Since its inception, the company's motto has always been \"get big fast.\"\n\nThe 2000s\n\nIn 2005, Amazon Prime This membership-based service for Amazon customers offers free two-day shipping within the contiguous U.S., as well as streaming, shopping and reading benefits.

The tech giant is also being held responsible for creating the Amazon effect -- the evolution and disruption of the retail market due to the company exhibiting monopolistic behaviors.\n\nFollowing are a few concerns and allegations that Amazon has faced over time:\n\nMonopolistic and anticompetitive behavior. Due to Amazon's size and economies of scale, it has been outpricing local and small shopkeepers and is accused of displacing an open market with a privately controlled one. This is leading to the slow death of the brick-and-mortar store model built by companies such as Sears and J.C. Penney.\n\nUnfair treatment of workers. Amazon is frequently under the microscope for providing unfair work conditions in its warehouses, including treating workers as robots, providing low wages and creating unsafe work conditions.\n\nHuge carbon footprint. Over the past two decades, Amazon has been accused by environmental activists of having a staggering carbon footprint. Transport of any merchandise relies on oil, and since Amazon delivers anything everywhere, it leaves a long-lasting carbon footprint that automatically falls on its shoulders.\n\nE-waste. A recent investigation conducted by British television network ITV uncovered how Amazon is contributing to the world's e-waste crisis by destroying millions of unused or returned products. This also includes millions of electronics, such as phones, computers and TVs that are toxic to soil, water, air and wildlife.\n\nCounterfeit product listings. Amazon has been under scrutiny by brands, shoppers and lawmakers as counterfeiters have been listing and selling fake products on Amazon through its third-party marketplace. To crack down on counterfeit products on its site, Amazon destroyed 2 million counterfeit products sent to its warehouses and blocked 10 billion fake listings in 2021.\n\nAvoiding taxation. Edging fast toward a monopoly status, Amazon has been criticized for often avoiding tax payments despite making huge profits. According to a report by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, the company avoided around $5.2 billion in corporate federal income taxes in 2021.\n\nAmazon finances\n\nAccording to a news release posted on Amazon's investor relations website, Amazon experienced a significant increase in net sales but a decrease in operating income in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nFollowing are some notable statistics from the release:\n\nNet sales increased 7% to $116.4 billion in the first quarter, compared with $108.5 billion in the first quarter of 2021. Excluding the $1.8 billion unfavorable impacts from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter, net sales increased 9% compared with the first quarter of 2021.\n\nOperating income decreased to $3.7 billion in the first quarter, compared with $8.9 billion in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nNet loss was $3.8 billion in the first quarter compared with net income of $8.1 billion in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nBesides being recognized as a company with business interests in e-commerce, cloud computing and AI services, Amazon also offers an extensive list of subscription services.
