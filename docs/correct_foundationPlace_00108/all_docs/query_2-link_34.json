        "text": "About OpenFOAM\n\nOpenFOAM is the free, open source CFD software developed primarily by OpenCFD Ltd since 2004. It has a large user base across most areas of engineering and science, from both commercial and academic organisations. OpenFOAM has an extensive range of features to solve anything from complex fluid flows involving chemical reactions, turbulence and heat transfer, to acoustics, solid mechanics and electromagnetics. More...\n\nOpenFOAM is professionally released every six months to include customer sponsored developments and contributions from the community. It is independently tested by ESI-OpenCFD's Application Specialists, Development Partners and selected customers, and supported by ESI's worldwide infrastructure, values and commitment.\n\nQuality assurance is based on rigorous testing. The process of code evaluation, verification and validation includes several hundred daily unit tests, a medium-sized test battery run on a weekly basis, and large industry-based test battery run prior to new version releases. Tests are designed to assess regression behaviour, memory usage, code performance and scalability.\n\nOpenFOAM releases are scheduled every six months in June and December.\n\nAbout OpenCFD\n\nOpenCFD Ltd has been managing and developing OpenFOAM since its debut in 2004, releasing all versions prior to 8th August 2011, when OpenCFD transferred the IP rights to the US foundation \"OpenFOAM Foundation, inc.\". After that date OpenCFD Ltd. continued to manage and develop OpenFOAM, preparing all releases whose IP was later transferred to and released by OpenFOAM Foundation Inc. until 2014. Thereafter OpenCFD Ltd. the owner of the OpenFOAM Trademark directly released its version of OpenFOAM from January 2016 to the present day.\n\nOpenCFD Ltd is a wholly owned subsidiary of the ESI Group. Our mission is to sustain the future of OpenFOAM as the highly functional, freely available and open source CFD software, offering a long-term and viable complement to CFD codes which are constrained by licence costs and multi-user, multi-processor cost inflation.\n\nOur team of Developers, Application Specialists, Trainers and Testers are located globally in far-east Asia, India, Europe and North America.\n\nMore..."
