        "text": "We are always looking for developers, engineers, end users, and others who may be interested in participating in our projects. There are many levels of contribution – both technical and non-technical. If you are interested in helping support the industry’s open source community, and want to join a diverse and inclusive community, we encourage you to get involved.\n\nThe Academy Software Foundation was created four years ago by a group of like-minded technology executives and software developers who saw a need for a neutral place, a common ground, where studios and vendors could come together to write open source software that would benefit everyone.\n\nA lot has happened in this short period of time. This document tells the story of the Foundation: where it came from, what it has achieved so far, and where it aims to go next."
