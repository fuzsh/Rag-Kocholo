Day in the Life of a Software Engineer at MathWorks – An average day – It's not just code!

My workday is pretty awesome. I'm actually happy when I wake up knowing it's a workday. I get to head into the office, solve interesting problems, invent new things with my friends, and if I'm really lucky, I get to teach a class!

MORNING: We start with basics: email maintenance, internal news, new bug assignments...have all my tests passed? Jobs accepted? Rejected? Furrow brow. Figure out why.

LUNCHTIME: By mid-day I've had a standup, reviewed a peer's code, and given feedback on a design or two. I look where I left off with my deliverables for this iteration. Lunch is with friends. Then it's specifications or coding, maybe mixed with a visit from someone needing answers or perhaps swinging by to answer my own requests for help. If I need to really focus I close my door and go head-long at the task.

AFTERNOON: 2:00 Friday? Cookie time.

Finally before leaving I look at what's up for tomorrow, check any jobs I have running, and head home to my family. Perfect!
