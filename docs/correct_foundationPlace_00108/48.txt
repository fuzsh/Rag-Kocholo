We are always looking for developers, engineers, end users, and others who may be interested in participating in our projects. There are many levels of contribution – both technical and non-technical. If you are interested in helping support the industry’s open source community, and want to join a diverse and inclusive community, we encourage you to get involved.

The Academy Software Foundation was created four years ago by a group of like-minded technology executives and software developers who saw a need for a neutral place, a common ground, where studios and vendors could come together to write open source software that would benefit everyone.

A lot has happened in this short period of time. This document tells the story of the Foundation: where it came from, what it has achieved so far, and where it aims to go next.
