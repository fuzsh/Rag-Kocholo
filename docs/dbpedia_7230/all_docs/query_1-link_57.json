        "text": "Psychological Healing Through Creative Self-Understanding and Self-Transformation (ISBN: 978-1-62857-075-5) Are you ready for psychological healing? This book is your liberating guide to psychological growth, including self-understanding, self-transformation, healing psychologically painful inner conflicts, as well as achieving psychological and spiritual fulfillment. Some aspects of psychological health and fulfillment clarified in this book include, authenticity, sincerity, integrity, creativity, intuition, empathy, inspiration, vitality, courage, strength of character, unselfish love (or warmhearted caring), emotional security, inner wholeness, and fulfillment. Readers will discover a new understanding of effective psychotherapy, groundbreaking diagnostic psychological testing research, as well as the distinction between the ego self-concept, the experiential self, and the transpersonal self (the real self, the relational self, or the holistic self). The authors deeply explored their own psychological pain and experiential truth to write this book, as a way of helping readers achieve greater self-understanding, fulfillment, and liberation from psychological pain. These principles of psychological self-understanding and healing self-transformation can also enhance the development of interpersonal relationships, as well as facilitate effective and fulfilling ways of living in society. Self-transformation at your fingertips! About the Authors The primary author, Dr. Max Hammer, was a distinguished Psychology Professor and supervisor of graduate students and interns in the clinical psychology, psychotherapy, and counseling practice training program of the Psychology Department at the University of Maine, for many years, as well as a respected psychotherapist and clinical psychology consultant and diagnostician. Dr. Max Hammer was one of the original core clinicians who founded and developed the Clinical Psychology program at the University of Maine, beginning in the 1960’s. In his work with graduate and undergraduate students in that program, Dr. Max Hammer provided a refreshing Humanistic and Transpersonal perspective, with an emphasis on flexible, warmly caring, empathic responsiveness to the needs of the individual psychotherapy client. A secondary contributing author is Dr. Alan C. Butler, a distinguished colleague and friend of Dr. Max Hammer’s. Dr. Butler, a Cooperating Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Maine, as well as a psychotherapist, clinical psychology consultant, and diagnostician, was one of the original staff members at the University of Maine counseling center, and served as the Training Director for its internship program for over thirty years, which he was instrumental in developing. Both Dr. Max Hammer and Dr. Alan C. Butler helped gently nurture and encourage thousands of graduate and undergraduate psychology students in their own individual journeys of personal reflection and transformation. The other secondary contributing author, Dr. Barry J. Hammer, also from Maine, has a specialization in the history of world religions, and for many years has studied the process of psychological and spiritual transformation, and its applicability to enhancing human relationships and compassionate social change. The primary author, the late Dr. Max Hammer, was an editor and a major contributor of two previously published books, The theory and Practice of Psychotherapy with Specific Disorders (Springfield, Illinois: Charles C. Thomas Publisher, 1972); and The Practice of Psychotherapy with Children (Homewood, Illinois: Dorsey Press, 1967). He also published about 30 articles in the fields of psychotherapy and clinical psychology. The primary author, Dr. Max Hammer, is deceased, therefore, this website will be managed by his eldest son and secondary contributing author Dr. Barry J. Hammer. Another secondary contributing author is Dr. Alan C. Butler.\n\nPhilosophy of Management is a relatively new term compared to the tradition of Philosophy itself. If Management as a university discipline is barely a century old, Philosophy of Management has a history of only a few decades. As Management broadly concerns conducting the affairs of a corporation or a business enterprise effectively, writers on management hesitate to adorn the title Philosophy to the issues they deal in their discourse. Management Department in universities and colleges invariably project their fields as a science with tools, techniques and methods of their own. Increasingly University dons in Management and successful executives of top business corporations began sounding about Philosophy of Management. A century after the first MBAs graduated from the US universities, Philosophy of Management has emerged as an academic discipline of its own. Personal Development of corporate executives, frontline business personnel and lowly staff members of business houses has bee...\n\nHospitality is the meeting of two persons: you, and the other. Two questions guide good hospitality: who is the other? And who am I? This chapter focuses on elaborating on who am I and who do I want to be? Knowing and understanding the self is an essential point of departure for personal growth. A key word here is unity. To grow, one must unite the different powers within oneself—reason, desires for pleasure, desires which give energy against difficulties, and free will—integrating these in choice and activity. One must unite inner attitudes and outer expressions, forming a personality that is coherent whether in private or in public. To achieve unity of life, one must consciously direct one’s powers toward a worthwhile goal. This goal is greater than becoming a good professional; it means striving to be a good human being. Virtues are crucial to this unity, as they perfect one’s powers toward this goal. This chapter discusses four classical virtues, sketching out how they shape the work of a hospitality professional, and ultimately contribute to societal growth through the development of its members."
