However, I happened to read his blog and had several thoughts of my own.\n\nThe guy knows how to use his words to incite, inflame and I suppose invigorate his readers (imagine manly menÂ here). He has some points about bachelorette parties where women do stupid games and become sexually suggestive/aggressive. But yikesorama, how oh how, does this paint these particular guys who cheer Roissy, bed a different womanÂ every night, and eschew marriage as being in a better light?\n\nHere are a few examples of the male superiority exhibited in this blog: All I want to do when I see the girl wearing the white veil is shoot a load of my hot spunk in her hair until sheâs crying that Iâve ruined her $300 wedding coif. Wow… Your hot spunk. Well that’s obviously the more highbrow response that in no way whatsoever is as immature and animalistic as what these women do.\n\nHe goes on to say that bachelorette parties come in two types: the bride is the hottest in the bunch or the ugliest. Maybe he should stop looking at everything through his Roissy colored beer glasses. Don’t get me wrong; I have never been out on such a low grade, cheesy bachelorette party (a lot seem to take place in Texas?) and they’re tacky but when he says, In my experience, bachelorette parties are dead-ends for pickup, it sounds an awfulÂ lot like, wah wah, sour grapes that I can’t find a bride to be to screw right now and add another notch to my studly belt.\n\nI’veÂ written erotica and edited for erotic publishers but I learned a new word today: cockblocking; when a woman’s friend stops her drunken buddy from going off to screw withÂ any dog boy looking for a place to put his bone. I guess I just don’t frequent those high class joints with women rubbing crotch to crotch with guys, or where guys are down on the ground with their nosesÂ up everyone’s skirts. (Thank god!)\n\nHere is where I think Roissy is actually trying on purpose and fairly obviously to incite his readers. He’s probably married with children but likes to stir the pot from hisÂ armchair: There is no good reason for a girl who is about to vow sexual fidelity to the man she loves for the rest of her life to suck from a veiny penis-shaped straw and dare horny drunk men to bite candies fromÂ the necklace nestled in her cleavage. (The bachelor party is perfectly acceptable because men sacrifice a lot more when they get married.)Â Â Excuse me while I laugh at this ludicrous image. Women should of course be chaste and sweet and at home cooking and warming the man’s slippers/bed and never have a wild moment, but men…well men are supposed to thump their chests, scratch their large and pendulous balls and swing from the trees picking up every Jane and giving her a good fuck to confirm their manly virility even if they are going to be shackled to one woman for the rest of their lives. Because they lose soooo much more. Personally, low class girls and low class guys (as exhibited in Roissy’s tales) deserve each other.\n\nRoissy does wisely say: Word to the wise: $20K on an engagement ring wonât banish the inner whore from your dearly beloved. Save your money. And likewise, the guy who does or doesn’t have his engagement/wedding ring on is also playing with his inner whore. Somehow it’s always a woman who is a slut, whore, skank if she sleeps around, but a man…oh he’s just being manly and sewing his oats. It’s too badÂ Roissy’s most riled up because these types of women act exactly like the men he likes to hang out with. Looking in the mirror is sometimes a bit of an eye opener, isn’t it?\n\nIn my book, skanky bachelor and bachelorette parties that have the soon to be married trawling bars for cheap sex thrills tells me these people have too many doubts to be getting married. And friends that egg them on…aren’t really friends. But there is one big saving grace in Roissy’s blog and many of the commenters; they hate marriage. Hopefully this will keep them from breeding and making more egotistical men and women who think their world is a better place of crotch cruising.\n\nMe, I guess I’ll just keep going to the places that actually seem to have people in them, that have neither bachelor nor bachelorette parties. Sure there are always the guys out to get laid (and women too)Â but anyone with any sense can usually figure that out and decide if it’s a good venture. There are classier ways to do it than fingering someone at the bar too. And yeah, I now feel superior about my attitude but only because I like to think that I have taste.\n\n2 Comments\n\nPosted in culture, entertainment, humor, relationships, sex | Tags: bachelor party, bachelorette, bars, cockblocking, cockteasing, crotch cruising, culture, manly men, Roissy, sex, skank, weddings, whore, woman's place\n\nPosted by: colleenanderson | August 11, 2008 Conservation: Working on a Way of Life\n\nI have been working on lessening my carbon footprint since I was a teenager, long before there were all the fancy catchwords that included “go green,” “eco” this and that, and “carbon footprint.” Recycling was the biggest, newest buzz word. As a teenager I had already read about the Gaia Hypothesis so I had a concern for the planet and pollution. About all I was doing at that stage was trying not to litter. It was a small start, but a start.\n\nOver the years I never threw anything out that could be re-used. It makes me a bit of a pack-rat and I have sometimes had old computer monitors or printers on my floor for a year before I could find a home for them. I can’t bear to put working or perfectly good items into the landfill. I also stopped cleaning with abrasive, chemically enhanced cleansers. I clean with baking soda, almost exclusively, using low phosphate detergent and soaps and rags and cloth napkins instead of paper towels and napkins.\n\nI started using cosmetics not tested on animals but I’m probably still eating/wearing my fair share of lead and other toxic chemicals, which are not yet regulated for cosmetics. That’s something I hope to work on soon. Unfortuanately I still drive, but my attempts to change that to something more fuel and energy efficient are being thwarted at the moment. (Previous blog entries cover public transportation, carbon tax and cars.)\n\nI also try to avoid the overpackaging that supermarkets give. This includes bringing a cloth bag, or if I have just a few items, carrying them out in my hands or my purse. Also, the “buy this 24-pack of cookies/chips” prepackaging is something I studiously avoid. Instead of paying more for all that extra bagging of chips, which are then placed in a cardboard tray and shrink wrapped, I’ll buy a large bag of salad greens, or nuts or whatever, and then re-use plastic containers and bags that I do have at home. I haven’t bought a container in years, nor prepakaged thingamagooeys.\n\nI rewash plastic cups from parties and put out bags to recycle bottles and plastic. I don’t wash my clothes or dishes until I have a full load. I don’t wear animal furs but I do wear leather. Shoes just don’t work well made of plastic or as long if made of cloth. But I do wear my shoes until they wear out, and try to fix them as long as I can.\n\nI could compost more, but my garbage during the garbage strike was only one small grocery bag every three weeks. I don’t buy wrapping paper anymore and do re-use what people give me. But I also keep old calendars and use the pictures on those as wrapping. I also make re-usable cloth bags. I save buttons off of shirts and turn clothes into rags if they can’t be sent off to a goodwill store.\n\nAm I perfect? Hell no. There are many ways I could improve especially when it comes to the car, though I do walk if I’m in my neighborhood. I try to keep an eye on what I do and improve it. For my own health and for my environment, I’ll look further into safe cleaners, nontoxic cosmetics and rechargeable batteries. Right now, I save batteries and take themÂ to recycling facilities. If we all try a little bit, it can make the environment a lot better for everyone and everything. It still saddens me when people toss things because they “can’t be bothered” or are too lazy. That’s fine if you’re living on your own world, but not when you’re sharing with everyone else.\n\nIn BC, you can contact the Recycling Council of BC’s recycling hotline on what to do with various items. http://www.rcbc.bc.ca/index.htm\n\nNo Comments yet...\n\nPosted in cars, consumer affairs, culture, environment, fashion, health care | Tags: eco, environmentalism, Gaia hypothesis, pollution, recycling, conservation, Recycling Council of BC, litter, garbage, carbon footprint, consumer packaging, overpackaging, go green, toxic chemicals, cosmetics, cleansers\n\nPosted by: colleenanderson | August 8, 2008 Writing: Grist for the Mill\n\nIt’s Friday and I’m feeling lazy. My brain is half empty from drinking at a BBQ last night. I could write about the opening of the Olympics but I’ve already done one rant, and I just don’t care. I could write about the really bad drivers I had to deal with this morning but I can’t work up my vim. I could write about life but I’m kinda tired.\n\nSo… I’ll just do a wee catchup on writing. For Aberrant Dreams http://www.hd-image.com/fiction.htmÂ I have accepted two new stories: “Exposure at Dejima” by K. Bird Lincoln, which takes place in medieval Japan and is a touching tale of love, kamis and presenting a particular face to society. The other is “Rhindor’s Remission” by William Argyle, a wonderful, humanistÂ tale about an old wizard who just doesn’t care anymore. Unfortunately I’m not sure when they’ll go up on the site. We’re a bit behind but catching up on the backlog and should be caught up by the end of September. That’s for fantasy. Joe Dickerson has finished with the anthologies so he’ll be devoting more time to the site.\n\nI’ll soon be helping out at Chizine http://www.chizine.com/Â as one of the two assistant poetry editors to Sandra Kasturi. That should start in the next month. I finally sent my bio in to Sandra.\n\nAnd I finally, finallyfinished a story I started fifteen years ago. My gods. It’s a novelette called “Awaking Pandora,” and it is the grist for the mill. I’m going to be tossing it to the wolves, or two (hopefully) writerly friends who can give me feedback. I’ve been looking at bits and pieces for so long that I need other perspectives on the story.\n\nI have a fair number of stories that I start and then they languish. Usually, it’s because I have a germ of an idea, a setting, a world, even a what-if. But often I have no solution to the conflict, no way to resolve the story. My bane; getting my conflicts down. It’s for this reason that I don’t think I could ever write a mystery and I quite admire the minds that do. To resolve all those puzzle pieces is like a finely woven tapestry.\n\nMy Kama Sutra story will finally be out at the end of the month in The Mammoth Book of the Kama Sutra. I’m looking forward to seeing it and barely remember the story right now.\n\nI’ve also still been managing to write 200 words of fiction a day, though yesterday was more bits of rewrite so I may have to write extra today. And this weekend I’ll be starting on the antagonist for my novel, writing his first chapter and seeing how that goes. I’ve been ruminating for weeks and I’m still trying to come up with a good name for him. But that can change anywhere along the way.\n\nOh yeah, and I wrote a new poem this week, titled “A Good Catch.” Rhea Rose and I sometimes work on a poem byÂ picking a word/object/phrase and then we put both of them into a poem. So I gave “fish scales” and Rhea gave “spoons.” We have each written a poem that has those images in some way. The poem in Chizine, “The Trials of Lemons” was conceived this way with the images of lemons and of dragonflies. It’s fun to mesh them and think along new paths. Now, I’m going to work on another half-finished story.\n\nNo Comments yet...\n\nPosted in 1, Fantasy, Publishing, Writing, entertainment, fairy tales, myth, science fiction | Tags: Writing, Colleen Anderson, Rhea Rose, Publishing, Aberrant Dreams, fantasy, reading, science fiction, poetry, speculative fiction, Chizine, Sandra Kasturi, short fiction, Joe Dickerson, William Argyle, K.

When I was sixteen I had my ears pierced. What might have been unusual about this was that my family doctor did it. I doubt anyone would think of going to their GP these days or even that one might consider piercing someone’s ears, but when I had mine done it was only the nasty piercing guns that blasted away some of the flesh on the way through. I went in and my doctor put a bit of freezing on my lobes, then poked a needle through.\n\nI walked around with loops of surgical thread (thick surgical thread) through my ears for weeks. When I finally put earrings in I had these little diamond (quartz/rhinestone really) studs. And then I suffered as the cheap earrings flaked off into my ears and if I didn’t already have it I developed a nickel allergy. My ears puffed up and turned red and crusty. Pretty icky. I eventually bought some silver rings and put those in.\n\nThis first piercing experience and the loops of thread reminded me of being in Nepal, seeing the young girls (as early as four) walking around with small pieces of wood keeping their earholes open. Since many people are poor I presumed that they couldn’t yet afford rings for their girl’s ears but pierced ears were so much part of Nepalese culture.\n\nAnd that’s just it. Poking things into or through our skin, or decorating it has been something we’ve been doing since humanity first grabbed that shiny or bright object and started designing. Other cultures have laced things through their noses and lips and chests and genitalia. North American counter culture picked up the piercing traditions of many tribal and African countries. So no matter how trendy, on the edge, neo-goth, punk, burlesque, tribal we’ve made ourselves here, there was someone else who did it first, probably centuries earlier.\n\nThe second time I had one ear pierced, I was not the first, not even in Calgary. I was one of the very few though, especially in Calgary. And that piercing was done with a gun. Ouch. Took a year to heal. Then I went to India where I entertained having my nose pierced, not with the stud through the nostril flesh, but a ring through the septum. I didn’t get that done but when I came back I ended up having my other ear pierced again. So I have two holes, close together on the left ear. The right ear has two holes but the second is right before the upper curve.\n\nAbout three or four years ago I saw a friend in the States who I hadn’t seen in a while. She had this really cute diamond stud above her lip, like a beauty mark. It looked great on her and on a spur of the moment kind of thing (with a bit of research on studios) I went in and had a Monroe piercing done. Of all the piercings this one was the most irritating and if I had known the nuisance it would be, I probably wouldn’t have had it done. It’s also a bad one for wearing at teeth though I haven’t had that problem yet.\n\nThe piercing itself did not hurt but I kept catching the back on my teeth and pulling it through the flesh. It seems I have an especially thin lip and went in for downsizing three times while it healed. Again the piercing didn’t hurt but my gums were so sore for the first week or two, from the stud back (a flat piece) rubbing up and down any time I talked or moved my mouth. Before I finally had the final size (and mine is shorter than most other people’s) I would still catch the stud on my teeth. A very disconcerting feeling.\n\nThe other annoyance was that any time you have a piercing right on the front of your face, your fingers get in the way and you can’t see what you’re doing if you have to put in a new piercing. The stud goes through the flesh and the screw is the head/jewel of the piercing and it is incredibly tiny and hard to hold with the wee screw part sticking out. Couple that with trying to get something through the inside of your lip that isn’t made for turning inside out to the mirror and you have frustration city. This might not be a big deal but a lot of talking or kissing seems to unscrew the thing.\n\nThe first nine months of having the Monroe it seemed to unscrew itself a lot. And where did it do this? In restaurants in the dark about 90% of the time. Amazingly, I’ve found the head every single time. I carry a spare for the time that I don’t find it. I need a few more though. The worst was when it dropped out in a restaurant at lunch and I couldn’t get the head back on. A half hour later I tried to get a friend to do it but I couldn’t get the stud through the flesh. The hole had already started to close up and I had to go down to the studio three hours later. That hurt like a damn when they had to thread the stud through again, and that was nine months after the piercing.\n\nSo yes, it was a pain in the ass. I could go to the flatter nose screw that my friend used in hers, but once I downsize I can’t use the bigger pieces again. I need to decide that before I spend more money. Since I went through all the effort to heal, there was no way I was going to get the thing taken out…not until it starts damaging my teeth. I have friends who have had all sorts of body parts pierced: brows, tongues, lips, septums, bridges, backs, necks, nipples, navels, labia, hoods, scrotum, penis…you name it. I think I’m done. But then I thought that before the Monroe.\n\nNo Comments yet...\n\nPosted in culture, entertainment, fashion, memories | Tags: culture, fashion, designs, body art, tattoos, piercings, skin, pierced ears., body decoration, tribal traditions, ear piercing, body piercing, monroe, downsizing, counter culture, studs, tribal\n\nPosted by: colleenanderson | August 6, 2008 Losing it in India\n\nIn1989 I travelled through India for two months. The first month I spent in a tribal state with a friend and the second I travelled through northern India and Nepal. There are many tales from that trip but this one takes place in the last two weeks.\n\nI was in Delhi and sick as a dog with dysentery. I was puking, had diarrheaÂ and generally could not eat. But I tried to see a couple of things and finally dragged myself out one day. I can’t remember but I think I went to the Red Fort. I bargained with a rickshaw driver for a price. This was one of the motorized rickshaws and when we finally agreed on a price, I said to the driver, that’s for both directions, there and back? And he agreed.\n\nSo off we went. When we arrived, he asked how long I would be, and I said an hour or two. I had no idea because it was a large site and I was still pretty sick and lethargic. So I wandered around and took pictures and then came out about an hour and a half later. The driver started berating me, standing with about eight other drivers, saying I’d taken too long and that it would cost more, etc. After some arguing, with the other drivers giving their opinions in his support, I couldn’t take it and felt ganged up onÂ so I took out half the money for half the trip and gave it to him and then went and got a bicycle rickshaw.\n\nBy this point I was completely distraught and depressed and didn’t even pay attention to anything. I just let the driver take me back to the hostel. Except the hostel was off of Connaught Circle (can you see British influence in that name?), a gigantic traffic circle with radial roads. Far too much traffic zooms through there so bicycle rickshaws must stop at stands at the edge of the circle so as not to interrupt traffic flow.\n\nWe arrived at the stop, I paid the rickshaw driver and started to walk when I heard “memseeb, memseeb.” I turned and there was the motorized rickshaw driver with two cops. At that point I completely freaked out. I started crying and shouting at them, holding my wrists together to them saying things like, “Just lock me up. Your country is trying to destroy me. Go ahead and take me away.”\n\nThe cops were so flabbergasted I don’t think they said two words to me and in truth I never even tried to argue reasonably. I’d already seen how the baksheesh (bribe) system worked. I continued crying and took all the money from my wallet and threw it at them. Then I went and sat on a wall and bawled my eyes out. I don’t know how long I was there crying but the police made the rickshaw driver give me back any money above what he’d asked (I presume–I never counted it.) He gingerly placed it at my feet when I yelled at him and asked why he didn’t just takeÂ everything. Then they went away.\n\nI stayed and cried and cried. I had been ill for three weeks at this point and was in fact my sickest in Delhi and Varanasi. Eventually I noticed about six men standing around me in concern as I cried, asking, “Memsahib, what is wrong?” To which I wailed, “Nothing. Your country is just trying to keep me here.” I wasn’t exactly in my right mind.\n\nI eventually got up and walked disconsolately back to my hostel. At one point a beggar came up to me and touched me. I already knew that in India people don’t touch each other unless they think you don’t know the culture. It’s a sign of disrespect. The beggar touching me was just another injurious straw. At that point I was so distressed with the day that I said, “Oh just go die. It’s easier.” To a beggar. A child. Because I wanted to. It was not one of my more stellar moments.\n\nIndia was the hardest place I ever travelled to, where nothing ran on time, bribes were expected, and no one would say they didn’t know something so you could end up with six directions to get somewhere and none of them would be right. The culture was different enough and the concept of time was hard to grasp. With trying to fathom these things, on top of trying to find signs, which were few, and if they were there they were in Urdu or Hindu, as well as being severely sick and carrying an overburdened pack, it was too much.\n\nI learned something about myself in India. I found my melting point and my darker side. But I came back from my trip and was forever changed. This of course wasn’t my only adventure in India but it was my hardest.\n\nWe wear a lot of masks in our society. There are ones for work, for friends, for dates, for family. Sometimes there are layers and layers of masks. I had them when I went to India but I had way fewer when I came back. India stripped me down to an essential aspect of myself. I truly was just surviving the experience by the end of the trip and was sick for another month after I returned. To this day, I have fewer masks. India made me integrate myself and my different aspects.\n\nEveryone gets much more a blend of me these days. I remember one friend telling me I was more accessible after going to India.The barriers had been stripped away and I built new ones, but not as high nor as thick.\n\nNo Comments yet...\n\nPosted in Writing, culture, entertainment, environment, memories | Tags: taxis, culture, travel, India, New Delhi, traveling, dysentry, cultural differences, beggars, rickshaw, traveling alone, baksheesh, Nepal, Connaught Circle, haggling, masks, personality\n\nPosted by: colleenanderson | August 5, 2008 Writing: Managing Markets\n\nEvery writer has a wayÂ of tracking their submissions. If they don’t, they run the chance of embarrassment; sending a story to the publication twice, sending the same story to more than one publication when simultaneous submissions are not allowed.\n\nIn the past, I know there have been software programs for tracking submissions. Places like www.duotrope.com track submissions to a particular publisher, though it’s not yet easy to use and many market listings still don’t show the average number of days to an acceptance or a rejection.\n\nFor tracking where I send my own submissions I use a double card system. My publisher markets go on a 3X5 index card, where I write the name of the publisher, editor, address, types of subs/genres, pay and whether they take email submission/replies or not. On each card, I’ll write the story name and date: The Trials of Lemons 7/08. I never get as specific as putting the actual day.\n\nEach story and poem is on a smaller index card. I started color coding them: blue=dark fantasy/horror, yellow=SF, green=fantasy, pink=erotica/mainstream, white=poems (except the spec poems are now on green). On these cards I’ll write where I sent them to. So for “The Trials of Lemons” (a poem),Â I’ll write:Â Chizine 7/08. When the story/poem is returned I mark the month: 9/08. If it’s an acceptance I put a “P” and circle it, meaning published. Actual date of publication isn’t put on the cards but on my vitae.\n\nUngainly? Perhaps. I could put this all on an Excel sheet, and once did try a computer generated card system,Â but I’m a fairly visual person and I find that I need to have the cards in my hand when I’m matching markets and submissions. Once I’ve matched things and submitted, I put my “sent” cards at the back of the box, with a paperclip separating sent and unsent material. I have a box for markets, one for fiction and one for poetry.\n\nIn recent years, I find I’m not using the market cards as much. Now that there are good and reliable sites like Duotrope and www.ralan.com, which keep information very up to date, I tend to always go to Ralan’s to check what the status of the publisher is. They sometimes close to submissions and may not always mark it on their own website (annoying) but it will be on Ralan’s, so in fact, his site is more up to date than the publisher website. If a market is a one-off anthology I don’t make a market card. If I’m also trying them for the first time, I wait. But now there are markets where I don’t bother making a card right away and then I run into trouble if I don’t read the story card close enough. This happened last week when I had already sent a story to a publisher and then sent a second a week later. I realized it right away and sent a withdrawal notice.\n\nSome day there may be a computer program that’s visual enough for me, but for now I shuffle cards and can see at a glance where I’ve sent a story or poem and how long it’s been with a publisher. I can also count in a moment, how many submissions I have out but I’m not that anal. Really.\n\nNo Comments yet...\n\nPosted in Fantasy, Publishing, Writing, culture, science fiction | Tags: culture, fantasy, horror, index cards, markets, poems, publishers, Publishing, rejections, science fiction, speculative writing, stories, submissions, tracking submissions, Writing\n\nPosted by: colleenanderson | August 2, 2008 Writing Bits: Grants\n\nI’ve just found out I sold a poem, “The Drowning Ones” to ON Spec. I’m not sure when it will be out but I imagine in the next year.\n\nI’ve also been asked to write a skewered fairy tale for an erotic anthology, I believe. I’m waiting for more details at this point and nothing is for sure.\n\nI finally received my study assistance grant from the BC Arts Council. I had applied for this to help defray costs of the Kansas CSSF workshop. It wasn’t as much as I asked for but talking to writer friend Linda DeMeulemeester, she received one on the same day and less than what she’d asked for. I believe with first time appliers they probably do give a smaller amount, testing the waters, you could say. The caveat is to turn in a report on the workshop for which they gave the grant, as well as receipts.\n\nIt’s much better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick to have received this (makes me feel like a real writer) and it opens up the possibility of applying for larger grants to take time to write, most likely working part time. I’ll be looking into that in the near future so see if I can get going on the novel.\n\nI also finished a story that came out of being in Kansas. The words “exegesis” and “apocryphal” stuck in my head while there. You have no idea how often writers can use these words. So I have sent a story out on its fledgling flight, titled “Exegesis of the Insecta Apocrypha.” It is indeed a mouthful.\n\n“A Kind Hand,” Which took ten years to finish, was completed in Kansas (I was there for novel writing but some short fiction was written as well.) I’m now trying very hard to get the first draft done of “Awaking Pandora,” even longer in the making and will be a novelette when it’s done. The first was fantasy and the latter will be SF.\n\nI’ve also been ruminating on the novel and think I can now start writing through the chapters on my antagonist. I plan to write his through story first, then go back and write the second antagonist’s through story. Then I’ll go back and write my major viewpoint character and slot them all together. I’m sure there will be enough to iron out. But breaking it down into smaller chunks will make this more doable for me and now that I have a better idea of all the story arcs I think it will be fairly smooth sailing.\n\nSince returning from Kansas I’ve also been writing at least 200 words a day in fiction. A couple of days were major rewrites and I counted those. I hope to keep up writing at least that amount every day.\n\n1 Comment\n\nPosted in Fantasy, Publishing, Writing, entertainment, fairy tales, science fiction, sex | Tags: Writing, Publishing, fantasy, science fiction, CSSF, BC Arts Council, story arc, grants, ON Spec, The Drowing Ones, speculative writing, protagonist, antagonisht, through story, novelette, Linda DeMeulemeester, viewpoint character\n\nPosted by: colleenanderson | August 1, 2008 Genre vs Literary Works\n\nNow that movie technology has advanced, movie makers create worlds with all manner of special effects. There are a great number of fantastical, science fictional works. There is the whole gamut of superhero movies from the various comic books. And then there are movies based on books. Back in the sixties, science fiction movies went way out on a limb when 2001: A Space Odyssey was filmed. And then there was Bladerunner, based off of P.K. Dick’s Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep (an awesome title by the way). There were many others, which ran the range of B and lower–the Godzillas and Blob and other somewhat campy horror flicks.\n\nAnd then came Star Wars, an epic story with star spanning special effects. Full steam ahead and there are many movies now out at the same time. For example, right now we have Hell Boy II, Dark Knight, Journey to the Center of the Earth and the Mummy III, to name a few. So, a lot of these are good fun and not particularly deep. Hollywood does love to turn speculative fiction into only eye and mind candy. When you look at the evolution of speculative (SF, fantasy, horror) novels, we’ve gone from bug-eyed aliens to very complex stories and worlds that look at the human condition, ethical and moral tales and what-ifs of future technologies.\n\nOn top of covering a host of possibilities with humanity, an author has to often create a viable, believable world that works. It must still follow rules and must be shown enough to paint dimensions so the reader can see it. This is of course, much easier in a movie, and yes a picture is worth a thousand words, maybe even five thousand. Good speculative writing is not for the faint of heart, nor for the undisciplined and uneducated.\n\nAll of these skills that one must learn for speculative writing apply for any type of writing. Know your market, which means read, read, read. Then write, write, write and learn and perfect. This never stops, ever. I tend to lump all the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror and even the myths of long ago under the umbrella term of speculative. In reality, anything that is not considered a history or telling of true life events, is in fact speculative.\n\nNow the truly interesting thing is that a speculative writer can write science fiction and it will be looked down the long narrow noses of literary academics and called “genre” (said with nose in the air, as if smelling bad, and with an English accent). But a literary writer can write something that is speculative fiction and it will be praised and lauded and given awards. Case in point; Margaret Atwood has written two speculative novels (at least that I’ve read): Oryx and Crake and The Handmaid’s Tale.Â They are sometimes claimed to not be speculative, orÂ speculative butÂ not science fiction, getting to the fine hair splitting of genre names. But she takes those technologies and does a what-if into the future. That is indeed speculative and even science fiction.\n\nWhen I was slowly progressing toward a degree in Creative Writing at UBC, one had to specialize in three areas: I chose short fiction, children’s fiction and poetry. In my kiddy lit class, the instructor didn’t like it when we wrote anything to do with fantastical worlds. She said they didn’t sell that well. Well, Ms Alderson, are you eating your hat after the fame of Harry Potter? This attitude was reflected throughout the department. However, George McWhirter who was the department head, and the only person worth his weight in gold, understood that writing well came first and what you wrote came second. He was not of the opinion expressed in The Boston Globe: “[T]he genre of the comic book is an anemic vein for novelists to mine, lest they squander their brilliance.” Ow.\n\nA champion for blending or removing the snobbery borders between genres (or lowbrow and highbrow as some put it) is Michael Chabon. He won the Pulitzer Prize for his novel The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Klay. For his most recent book The Yiddish Policemen’s Union he was award the Nebula and the Campbell Awards. He was purported as saying the SF related Nebula meant more to him than getting the Pulitzer.\n\nPerhaps with such writers as champions, we’ll see “genre” fiction being treated as writing and not drivel, where the best of all writing will rise to the top and more “genre” works will be nominated for awards. I’m not holding my breath…yet.\n\nNo Comments yet...\n\nPosted in Fantasy, Publishing, Writing, culture, entertainment, science fiction | Tags: Bladerunner, bug-eyed aliens, creative writing, Dark Knight, fantasy, genre, George McWhirter, Handmaid's Tale, Hell Boy, horror, Journey to the Center of the Earth, literary, literature, Margaret Atwood, Michael Chabon, movies, Nebula Award, novels, Oryx and Crake, Pullitzer Prize, reading, science fiction, speculative fiction, Star Wars, The Mummy, UBC, Writing, Yiddish Policemen's Union\n\nPosted by: colleenanderson | July 31, 2008 Gay Pride and Whole Rainbow of Possibilities\n\nThis coming weekend marks the gay pride parade in Vancouver. I have only managed to go once and it was a so-so parade. I was expecting big Kermit floats and others covered in flowers. Mostly it came across as ways for different businesses to advertise while showing support. Though you do get some colorful individuals and the bare-breasted dykes on bikes. We probably have the second largest population of gay and lesbians after San Francisco. Why the west coast? I’m not sure. Probably because it’s warmer but also port cities tend to always be a blend of tradition and new ideas brought in by different ships and crews. Port cities are usually more liberal.\n\nOne of the news items associated with this year’s gay pride parade was about a Sikh man who has been trying to put a Bollywood style float together and running into some opposition: people don’t want the Sikh religion associated with homosexuality. It’s kind of odd because it’s not the religion that should be associated with homosexuality but homosexuals who are associated with the Sikh religion. Homosexuality isn’t drawn to a particular religion.\n\nNo matter what right wing fundamentalist may think, homosexuality isn’t a choice. People are born with a particular preponderance. A very good friend of mine, Greg, told me that by the age of six he knew he was gay and wanted to play “rubbing dinkies” with the boys. Most of the gay men I know tried sex with the other gender but it just didn’t work for them.\n\nSomeone posted on wordpress a while back (I wished I’d gone and responded) that their theory was that women who had a “best friend evah” who was gay were women who were dumb, vapid and not too deep (is that the same thing?). I believe the personÂ went on to say that gay men only want theseÂ Barbie doll types of women as friends. (I didn’t read all of the article) I’ve heard some ludicrous things over the years and this rates as one of them.\n\nExample: one of my best friends evah is gay. My other best friends are not. I have two degrees and have never been called stupid by anyone. My neighbors are gay and we’re all friends. My landlady is an architect. I certainly see no correlation with one type of person being the preferred friend type to a gay person (and I use gay here to mean men or women). Like all people, gay people have a range of personalities and religious beliefs. They are of all religions and none, varying tastes and desires and life goals. The only difference; they prefer to have sex with the same gender.\n\nOf course, these odd prejudices of only one type for one type can also happen amongst certain gay people. I’ve been accused by gay men of being a fag hag. I hate this term and to me it means a woman who exclusively hangs around with gay men, hoping to eventually have sex with/sway one over to the other side. Even if it only means a woman who only hangs with gay men, I still take offense. If I want to go out with my gay friend, what’s wrong with that and why should it be assumed that’s all I do? Do people presume such things if you’re out with a straight male or a woman?\n\nMy biggest problem with people being against homosexuals is–what business is it of yours what they do in their bedrooms? They’re not warping your children’s minds. You can’t sway someone to the “gay side” unless they’re already gay. And as far as I’m concerned any religion that would ban someone just for being born the way they are, is a religion I want nothing to do with. Of course, mostly what happens is religious interpretation by individuals, which can get skewed. Love thy neighbor, but not if he’s gay? Do unto others as you would have them do unto you, but not if they’re gay?\n\nI haven’t studied all religions but if compassion means it’s only for someone who is like you, then that’s a pretty narrow definition. Those who protest the most against being gay are probably those who have questioned their own sexuality and repressed it. Live and let live and stop repressing the homosexuals. If they were accepted in most cases as part of society, the need to flaunt or protest goes waaay down. Hooray for Canada, which legalized same sex marriages. And here’s to the gay pride parade which will be needed until everyone accepts that homosexuals are part of the overall population; 10%.\n\nNo Comments yet...\n\nPosted in culture, family, relationships, religion, sex | Tags: Vancouver, gay, lesbian, homosexual, gay pride, gay pride parade, San Francisco, Sikh, fag, fag hag, sex, gender preference, same sex marriages, dyke\n\nPosted by: colleenanderson | July 30, 2008 Airport Security=Paranoia Keeps Them in Line\n\nIn the past year, I’ve flown to Ireland and to Kansas. Flying to the US took far more rigmarole, extra gates and scrutiny of bags and clothing than going through Scotland and on to Ireland.\n\nFor US flights, you have to cart your luggage along, to then eventually toss it on a conveyor belt. Why? God only knows. To humiliate I guess. And Canada and the US share a border, but you never know what we might infest the US with either: politeness?\n\nAs everyone who has flown since 9/11 knows, you must take off your shoes when you’re going through, because some idiot decided to try and bomb with his shoe. Even if you’re wearing flip flops, some airports are supper anally retentive on all shoes. And of course, you can’t take a sharp metal object: no knives and no metal utensils on the plane.\n\nThen there were the guys trying to splash about some liquids to make bombs. Now you have to put everything in a separate bag, and have no more than a few ounces of any particular liquid. And even if you use the airport approved bag, you may still not be able to carry it on the plane as my sister found out, because the rules change from airport to airport.\n\nSo, what’s next? Someone who puts some form of bomb material into a tube of lipstick, a suppository or a fake tooth? We have to take off all metal bits going through a metal detector but as I found, a bra can now set off the super sensitized detectors. Watch out, everyone who has piercings. Soon you may have to take every piece out. There has already been one case of overzealous customs guards making a woman take out her nipple piercings.\n\nHow ridiculous and useful is this? Well sure they scan for certain chemicals on laptops, but what about PDAs and phones? If someone wanted to kill or hold someone hostage on a plane, there are a million ways. What about someone who holds a black belt? They can kill someone with their hands. “Excuse me, sir. We’re going to need you to check your hands.”\n\n“I can’t check my hands. They’re part of me.” “Well then we’ll have to tie them behind your back.” “But what if I have to go?” “The attendant will assist you.” “What! One person can’t fit in those bathrooms, let alone two!” “We’ll give you a cup, no charge.”\n\nOh and hmmm, let’s see. Many of us wear shoes with laces, or belts. They all can be used to tie or strangle someone. “I”m sorry, ma’am, you’re going to have to check those laces. Oh and the strap to your shoulder bag. You’re not wearing thongs, are you?” Remember, just after 9/11 when they were taking people’s tweezers and knitting needles? They must have been afraid of bad eyebrow pluckings.\n\nBe prepared to arrive a day earlier than your flight, where you will strip down and be given orange scrubs and cloth booties to go through on the flight. Your checked clothing will be returned to you on the other side. Oh and bring lube, but in less than 2 ounces, for your cavity search. You don’t mind a probe do you?\n\nAll this supposed airport security is really one giant smoke and mirrors game. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain because he’s not doing anything. The attitude of the US, which Canada and other nations have followed is to fake us out with this “great” measure being taken to “keep us safe.” Really. Yes, safe. Don’t you feel it? I don’t. I keep thinking that mass stupidity and paranoia is all that I’m seeing. I think this sentiment was best echoed by other Americans when we were in the line-up to get to our planes. All I heard them say was, “This is ridiculous. What a farce.”\n\nYep but if those governments think we think we’re being protected, well then, spending money on half-assed measures always works better.\n\nNo Comments yet...\n\nPosted in culture, flying, politics, security | Tags: travel, airlines, flying, airports, airport security, metal detectors, paranoia, customs, border guards, secuirty measures, homeland security, shoe bombs, scary liquids, US flights, sarcasm\n\nOlder Posts »\n\nCategories\n\n1\n\ncars\n\nconsumer affairs\n\nculture\n\nentertainment\n\nenvironment\n\nfairy tales\n\nfamily\n\nfashion\n\nflying\n\nhealth care\n\nhistory\n\nhumor\n\nIreland\n\nmemories\n\nmyth\n\npolitics\n\nPublishing\n\nrelationships\n\nreligion\n\nscience fiction\n\nsecurity\n\nsex\n\nSpirituality\n\nWriting\n\nFantasy\n\nPages\n\nAbout Colleen\n\nEditing Resume\n\nInterests\n\nPublished Works\n\nARTICLES\n\nAwards/Nominations\n\nPOETRY\n\nBlogroll\n\nChizine\n\nColleen Anderson\n\nHillary Rettig–Lifelong Activist\n\nKelp Queen Press\n\nRecycling Council of BC\n\nSF Canada\n\nWordPress.com\n\nWordPress.org\n\nArchives\n\nAugust 2008\n\nJuly 2008\n\nJune 2008\n\nMay 2008\n\nApril 2008\n\nMarch 2008\n\nTags Aberrant Dreams BC BC government Canada carbon tax cars Colleen Anderson conservation CSSF culture editing editor environment fairy tales fantasy gas prices green greenhouse gases health horror humor Ice Queen inspiration Ireland Kansas Lawrence muse people poetry politics Publishing reading recycling rejections relationships Rhea Rose science fiction society speculative fiction stories travel Vancouver Warrior Wisewoman writers Writing Category Cloud 1 cars consumer affairs culture entertainment environment fairy tales family Fantasy fashion flying health care history humor Ireland memories myth politics Publishing relationships religion science fiction security sex Spirituality Writing August 2008 M T W T F S S « Jul 123 45678910 11121314151617 18192021222324 25262728293031 Recent Comments joecetta on Errr, Bachelorette Partie…Patrick Bateman on Errr, Bachelorette Partie…Muslims Against Shar… on Omar Khadr, Politics and …maxwelljay on Writing Bits: Grantsobelmimbisask on Saving Energy and Environment …\n\nBlog at WordPress.com. | Theme: Ocean Mist by Ed Merritt\n\nNotEng\n\nNotCS\n\nCS\n\nBaseball Toaster: The Griddle [View Page]\n\nPosts:[The Griddle: Day 1 of Olympic baseball], [The Griddle: I miss 'In play, out(s)'], [The Griddle: 20+ hits just don't go as far as they used to (Recurring feature!)], [The Griddle: Will the last player to leave Cleveland please turn off the light?], [The Griddle: Scouts caught up in Federal gambling probe], [The Griddle: Heart and Soul, Canadian style], [The Griddle: Cheery-Os], [The Griddle: 70 and more], [The Griddle: What's the connection?], [The Griddle: Reporting from Your Nation's Capital], [The Griddle: Karl Kuehl, 1937-2008], [The Griddle: Karstens joins rare company in Bucs history], [The Griddle: Wall ball], [The Griddle: Nietzsche comes to Cincinnati], [The Griddle: Waters hope quick start doesn't lead to bad finish], [The Griddle: Quick news of the day], [The Griddle: And I'm sure all the fans stayed until the end], [The Griddle: Raul Ibanez almost becomes as famous as Fernando Tatis], [The Griddle: Serving up slams daily], [The Griddle: The CI alarm has been sounded!

Falzarano, who is presently free on $200,000 bail, faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison.\n\nSources close to the bookmaking probe identified one of the alleged bettors as Alan Marr, a respected high-ranking scout fired by the Baltimore Orioles last month. Marr acknowledged knowing Falzarano, but declined further comment when reached by ESPN.com at his home in Sarasota, Fla.\n\nThe investigation has identified \"seven or eight\" other scouts who bet through Falzarano, though it's possible that number could grow as New York City police continue to pursue the case. Major League Baseball's newly formed investigative unit is also assisting law enforcement.\n\nPermalink | Comments (0) Heart and Soul, Canadian style 2008-08-11 11:11 by Bob Timmermann\n\nSteve Simmons of the Edmonton Sun writes about the \"heart of Canadian baseball?\"\n\nRussell Martin?

He struck out three and walked three. George Sherrill pitched the ninth to save the 3-0 win for the Orioles.\n\nSince 1956, just six pitchers have made their major league debut by pitching at least 8 innings and giving up only one hit.\n\nStarting with the oldest:\n\nA young Dominican named Juan Marichal gave up an 8th inning single to Clay Dalrymple of the Phillies and nothing else. Marichal went the distance in a 2-0 shutout on July 19, 1960. Marichal would toss 52 shutouts in his Hall of Fame career.\n\nCalifornia Angels lefty Rudy May pitched 9 innings and gave up just one hit to the Detroit Tigers on April 18, 1965. Pinch hitter Jake Wood doubled in the 8th and would score the tying run on an error by Bobby Knoop. The Tigers won in 13 innings at Anaheim by a 4-1 margin.\n\nOn April 14, 1967, Billy Rohr of the Red Sox came within one out of a no-hitter before Elston Howard singled to right. The Red Sox won the game 3-0. Rohr would win only three games in his major league career.\n\nJimmy Jones was the third pick in the 1982 Amateur Draft (Shawon Dunston was #1 and Augie Schmidt was #2) by the San Diego Padres. Jones made his major league debut on September 21, 1986 against the Astros in Houston. The only hit Jones gave up was a third inning triple by Astros pitcher Bob Knepper (he actually hit two in his career.) Jones pitched in parts of eight seasons for the Padres, Yankees, and Astros and was 43-39 with a 4.46 ERA.\n\nOn September 18, 1988, Bob Milacki of the Orioles pitched eight shutout innings at Tiger Stadium and gave up only a third inning double to Tom Brookens. Tom Niedenfuer pitched the ninth inning to get the save as Baltimore won 2-0.\n\nFinally, on July 28, 1997, Steve Woodard of the Brewers bested Toronto and Roger Clemens 1-0 in the first game of a doubleheader at County Stadium. Otis Nixon led off with a double for the only game. Mike Fetters pitched the ninth to save a 1-0 win.

Back on this day in 2001, the Cleveland Indians overcame a 14-2 deficit in the bottom of the 5th inning to defeat Seattle 15-14 at Jacobs Field.\n\nThe game was nationally televised and was the ESPN Sunday Night game. The Mariners were on their way to winning 116 games, but this was one game that eluded them.\n\nSeattle hit Cleveland starter Dave Burba hard, scoring seven runs in two innings. Reliever Mike Bacsik gave up another seven runs in six innings of work in his major league debut.\n\nCleveland started its comeback in the 7th. Russell Branyan hit a leadoff homer against Mariners starter Aaron Sele. With two outs, the Indians loaded the bases and John Halama came out of the pen to relieve. Jolbert Cabrera, who had come in to give Roberto Alomar a rest, singled in two to make it 14-5 after 7 innings.\n\nJim Thome led off the 8th with a home run and it was 14-6. Branyan was hit by a pitch and Marty Cordova homered and it was now 14-8. Singles by Einar Diaz and Kenny Lofton drove Halama out of the game and Norm Charlton relieved. Omar Vizquel doubled off of Charlton to make it 14-9, but the Indians threat died when Lofton was out at the plate trying to score on a pitch in the dirt and Cabrera struck out.\n\nAll Cleveland needed to do now was make up five runs in one inning. No problem.\n\nEd Taubensee, who had replaced Juan Gonzalez at DH, led off with a single. Thome flied out and Branyan struck out and the Mariners were one out away. But Cordova kept the game alive with a double, sending Taubensee to third.\n\nSeattle manager Lou Piniella opted now for Jeff Nelson to face the loveable Wil Cordero. Cordero walked to load the bases. Diaz followed with a single to drive in two to make it 14-11.\n\nPiniella was now in a thoroughly foul mood and he called on his closer Kazuhiro Sasaki. Sasaki was a closer who needed a lot of time to warm up and it's quite possible that Sasaki just wasn't ready because he was generally awful. Lofton greeted Sasaki with a single to load the bases. And then Vizquel cleared the bases and tied the game with a triple. Cabrera grounded out to end the inning.\n\nIn the bottom of the 10th, the Indians got two runners on with two outs against Arthur Rhodes and Piniella then made another change, switching right fielder Charles Gipson to left to trade places with Al Martin. I think Piniella had heard from Martin that he could throw a baseball 550 feet on the fly at a speed of 87 mph. Rhodes got Cordero to strike out.\n\nThe Mariners didn't score in the top of the 11th (Seattle had just three hits after the fifth inning) and Jose Paniagua was the next man out of the Seattle pen.\n\nPaniagua retired Diaz to start the inning, but quickly got into trouble as Lofton and Vizquel singled to put runners at first and third with one out. Cabrera put an end to the game with a single to score Lofton and send what was left of an announced crowd of 42,494 home seeing something that happened since 1925. The game ended about 15 minutes past midnight, just in time for the fans to enjoy all the famous late night dining that Cleveland has to offer.\n\nThe last team that had blown a 12-run lead had been the 1925 Indians who led the A's 15-3 in the seventh inning before giving up a run in the bottom of the seventh and then 13 in the eighth. That was on June 15, 1925.\n\nThe Detroit Tigers are the other team that has come back from 12 down and they did so at home against the White Sox on June 18, 1911, who overcame a 13-1 deficit in the fifth to pull out a 16-15 win.\n\nThe NL record for biggest deficit overcome is 11 and it's been done three times, most recently on July 18, 1994 by the Astros against the Cardinals.\n\nPermalink | Comments (2) Raul Ibanez almost becomes as famous as Fernando Tatis 2008-08-04 21:53 by Bob Timmermann\n\nSeattle's Raul Ibanez hit a grand slam home run in the bottom of the seventh inning at Safeco Field off of Minnesota's Glenn Perkins. That made the score 6-5.\n\nThe Mariners then kept scoring. And getting on base. And with two outs, Willie Bloomquist drew a walk off of Matt Guerrier to load the bases. And who was coming up, none other than Ibanez.\n\nBut Fernando Tatis' place in history remained secure as Ibanez could manage nothing more than a 2-RBI single.\n\nIbanez's 6 RBI inning tied an AL record held by 10 others and most recently done by Bobby Abreu of the Yankees on September 12, 2006 against Tampa Bay. Abreu had a 3-run homer and 3-run double in the first inning.\n\nPermalink | Comments (4) Serving up slams daily 2008-08-04 21:25 by Bob Timmermann\n\nOn Sunday, Edwar Ramirez of the Yankees gave up a grand slam homer to Mark Teixeira of the Angels, although the Yankees would win the game 14-9.\n\nTonight, Damaso Marte of the Yankees gave up a game-ending grand slam homer to Marlon Byrd of the Rangers that gave Texas a 9-5 win.\n\nThat was the first time since August 31 and September 1, 1990 when Yankee pitchers gave up slams in consecutive games.\n\nOn August 31, 1990, Luis Rivera of Boston hit a slam against Jeff Robinson. The next day, Mike Greenwell hit an inside-the-park grand slam against Greg Cadaret.\n\nI warn Yankee fans that the boxscore for the September 1 game is not for the squeamish.\n\nPermalink | Comments (3) The CI alarm has been sounded!

This horrific possiblity must not stand!\n\nWith the Diamondbacks and the Dodgers each struggling to stay around the .500 mark, if not falling below it, it’s possible that, as a division winner, a team with an under-.500 record (in other words, a losing team), would automatically qualify for the postseason.\n\nShould that happen, it would make a mockery of the playoff structure. A team with a losing record does not deserve to be in the playoffs, much less deserve to be considered a champion of any division or anything.\n\nIt may not happen. The Diamondbacks, now three games over .500, and the Dodgers, at .505 but presumably reinforced by Manny Ramírez’s bat, each may rise well above .500 over the last two months of the schedule.\n\nAnderson proposes that if a division winner not have a winning record, then a second wild card team be accepted.\n\nI can think of a lot of horrible things that could happen in baseball. I think a team winning a division with a record below .500 is not one of them.\n\nFor starters, what if it's your favorite team that has the losing record and wins the division? What are you rooting for down the stretch? Is there something so much more magical about team winning 81 games than 80?\n\nIn 1973, the Mets won the NL East with an 82-79 record? There were no calls in the New York Times to ask for the NL East champ to be removed from the playoffs if no team in the division had a winning record (which was the case as late as September 21, 1973).\n\nI still think the chances of the NL West champ having a losing record are pretty slim mainly because Arizona and Los Angeles get to play lots of games down the stretch against the likes of San Francisco and San Diego (and Colorado to a lesser extent).\n\nAnderson brings up the example of the 1994 season ending with the Rangers atop the AL West at 52-62. The Rangers poor record that year wasn't helped by the team losing 9 of 11 games before the Great Unpleasantness began.\n\nThe 2005 Padres had to win the final game of the season at home against the Dodgers to avoid finishing at .500.\n\nBut remember the hard and fast rule of writers like Anderson: New York teams with bad records winning pennants (1973 Mets and 2000 Yankees) are gutty underdogs, but teams like the 2006 Cardinals or the 1988 Dodgers are just flukes and not worthy of mention.\n\nAnd Anderson does like to point out that when there were no divisions, there was no danger of the pennant winner not having a losing record.\n\nAmazing things those kids do with math today.\n\nPermalink | Comments (9) Skip Caray: 1939-2008 2008-08-03 19:20 by Bob Timmermann\n\nLongtime Atlanta Braves broadcaster Skip Caray, son of Harry Caray and father of TBS announcer Chip Caray, passed away in his sleep today in the Atlanta area at the age of 68.\n\nCaray had suffered from numerous ailments in the past several years, many of them related to diabetes and he had to curtail his schedule to just covering home games.

The rule change, proposed by AL President Will Harridge upon the advice of Lew Fonseca, would have allowed a team to have a player re-enter a game (unless he was ejected or removed for some other rules infraction) after sitting out one complete inning.\n\nCasey Stengel's quote: \"There's nothing wrong with the way the game is played. All baseball needs is more good ballplayers. If they want to make a change, why don't they outlaw the curve ball.

Art and Satire in Iran WNYC News, May 24, 2008\n\nArdeshir Mohassess: Art and Satire in Iran is the first major U.S. retrospective of Mohassess's work. The self-taught artist presents 70 monochromatic ink drawings that comment on Iranâs social, political and cultural life before and after the 1979 revolution. Making a statement\n\nBoston Globe, May 23, 2008\n\nJazz bassist and vocalist Esperanza Spalding is on the express track. At 23, she's not only a Berklee College of Music alumna, but already on the school's faculty, and she's gigging amid the jazz elite, from backing Joe Lovano or Pat Metheny to hitting the top festivals like Newport. Her new self-titled record marks another career jump, as she has left the European indie label of her 2006 disc, \"Junjo,\" for Heads Up, with its well-regarded roster of established jazz, blues, and world artists. The new record came out this week, and Spalding plays a CD-release show at the Regattabar Thursday.\n\nContinue reading \"Making a statement\" »\n\nBringing about a reunion of fusion pioneers\n\nBoston Globe, May 18, 2008\n\nA ritual of summer takes on a jazz flavoring this year, as perhaps the season's most anticipated reunion tour is the one featuring the classic lineup of Return to Forever, one of the most iconic jazz units of the '70s.\n\nContinue reading \"Bringing about a reunion of fusion pioneers\" »\n\nSax man likes to go with the flow\n\nBoston Globe, May 16, 2008\n\nNEW YORK - When he was about 12 years old, Pete Robbins knew he wanted to learn a wind instrument so he could play in his school band.

WNYCâs Siddhartha Mitter reports on a group of international artists who are making the neighborhood their base.\n\nHaale's sound stretches from New York to Iran Boston Globe, May 6, 2008\n\nCall her Persian.

Photos by Annie Shreffler. A Walk Down 125th Street WNYC News, April 25, 2008\n\nChanges are coming to 125th Street. Plans to rezone Harlemâs main artery look headed for approval in the city council, after a compromise to limit the height of new buildings to 19 stories. The amount of affordable housing in the plan has also been increased. While the look of 125th Street will change, itâs less clear what will happen to its identity. A life in between worlds\n\nBoston Globe, May 2, 2008\n\nNEW YORK - It's your basic immigrant success story, really: A young man grows up in a faraway country, feels the call of a challenging vocation, sets his eyes upon a dream. He works with relentless purpose and finds his way to America where, under the tutelage of masters in his field, he becomes, at just 35, a master in his own right.\n\nContinue reading \"A life in between worlds\" »\n\nApril 08, 2008 Remembering a world-music giant\n\nBoston Globe, April 4, 2008\n\nLast October, Andy Palacio, a brilliant musician and activist from Belize, capped a landmark year by standing on a stage in Seville, Spain, to accept world music's highest tribute: the WOMEX Award.\n\nContinue reading \"Remembering a world-music giant\" »\n\nVictor Wooten trades his funky soul for a spiritual one\n\nBoston Globe, March 28, 2008\n\nMystical visitations are much on the mind these days of Victor Wooten. In addition to a new album, \"Palmystery,\" out next week, the Nashville-based contemporary bass guitar hero is also releasing a book, a work of fiction titled \"The Music Lesson,\" in which a young player learns wisdom well beyond musical technique alone from a chance encounter with a spiritually advanced stranger.\n\nContinue reading \"Victor Wooten trades his funky soul for a spiritual one\" »\n\nMarch 24, 2008 New York's Clergy Talk Politics\n\nWNYC News, March 23, 2008\n\nToday is Easter Sunday and many New Yorkers are headed to Church. Last Tuesday Democratic Candidate Barack Obama talked about the conflicts he as a congregant has had with some of what his pastor, the Rev Jeremiah Wright has said in the past. WNYCâs Siddhartha Mitter spoke with some New York clergy about how they handle potentially divisive topics when addressing their congregations.\n\nSurviving a rough patch\n\nBoston Globe, March 21, 2008\n\nLast year was a time of transition for the Drive-By Truckers, the Athens, Ga., band with the dual gift for high-octane rocking and magisterial front-porch storytelling. Personnel flux and a sense of fatigue led the group to pare down its sound, perform acoustic gigs, and take time out to serve as backing band on a soul-music project.\n\nContinue reading \"Surviving a rough patch\" »\n\nAn Iraqi Musician in New York\n\nWNYC News, March 19, 2008\n\nFive years after the US invasion of Iraq, an Iraqi-American musician is preserving the classical music of Baghdad here in New York.

After 9/11 there were fears that funding and opportunities for Arab artists would dry up. Siddhartha Mitter reports on the thriving scene for Arab music in New York.\n\nA banjo, a piano, and two willing masters\n\nBoston Globe, February 29, 2008\n\nIn four decades exploring seemingly every nook and cranny of straight-ahead jazz, Latin jazz, and fusion, the pianist Chick Corea has exemplified versatility and spirit of adventure to as great an extent as any musician today. But even omnivorous curiosity has limits. So when asked how much interest he had ever taken, until recently, in working with a banjo as accompanying instrument, Corea's reply is frank and succinct: \"Zero.\"\n\nContinue reading \"A banjo, a piano, and two willing masters\" »\n\nStructure and roughness\n\nBoston Globe, February 24, 2008\n\nIn the Japanese tradition, the ronin is the masterless samurai. The consummate free agent, he rejects conventional authority and moves through the world with defiance and dignity. In jazz today, Ronin designates something no less rigorous and idiosyncratic. It's the name that Swiss pianist Nik BÃ¤rtsch chose for his quintet, a one-of-a-kind unit that performs what BÃ¤rtsch calls Zen-funk - a cerebral music influenced by minimalism, yet blessed with head-nodding, foot-tapping rhythmic tendencies, and an exhilarating sense of pacing that makes each composition a fascinating adventure.\n\nContinue reading \"Structure and roughness\" »\n\nFebruary 17, 2008 For saxman, it's all adding up\n\nBoston Globe, February 15, 2008\n\nNEW YORK - He's a self-described egghead, a numbers nut who could have become a mathematician or economist. He's a science-fiction fan who loves William Gibson's \"Neuromancer\" and is liable to zone out to sci-fi reruns on TV. But when Rudresh Mahanthappa takes the stage, it's with an alto saxophone, not chalk and blackboard, that he burrows into theorems and explores alternate planes, in a musical language so vivid and complex that hard-bitten jazz arbiters have dared to compare him to Ornette Coleman or John Coltrane.\n\nContinue reading \"For saxman, it's all adding up\" »\n\nAn avant-garde thinker takes a turn with a trio\n\nBoston Globe, February 8, 2008\n\nImprovised music never happens in a vacuum. It's the product of an encounter, when musicians listen and respond together in a way that none could have achieved alone. The deeper the encounter, the more fully present the players, the greater the liberties they can take with conventions and still produce beautiful music.\n\nContinue reading \"An avant-garde thinker takes a turn with a trio\" »\n\nFebruary 04, 2008 Campaign Theme Songs: A Tough Balance\n\nWNYC News, February 02, 2008\n\nItâs not exactly the Grammys, but as the presidential field winnows down, so does the list of campaign theme songs that might â come November â be crowned the Winning Presidential Anthem of 2008. WNYCâs Siddhartha Mitter evaluates the contenders.\n\nContinue reading \"Campaign Theme Songs: A Tough Balance\" »\n\nPlaying around with nature's soundtrack\n\nBoston Globe, February 1, 2008\n\nJazz and the great outdoors aren't commonly associated with each other, but for bassist and bandleader Jason Davis, they've been the twin poles of an emerging career that's as much - pardon the pun - about timber as it is about timbre.\n\nContinue reading \"Playing around with nature's soundtrack\" »\n\nJanuary 31, 2008 Spanning, spinning global beats\n\nBoston Globe, January 30, 2008\n\nNEW YORK - She's as conversant in the arcana of classic, early-'90s hip-hop as she is in the folk music of her family's native Punjab, India. Spinning on her turntables today, you might find Bollywood anthems, baile funk from Brazil, or neo-Balkan brass-band grooves from her adopted Brooklyn.\n\nContinue reading \"Spanning, spinning global beats\" »\n\nSpirit guides Moses on his journey\n\nBoston Globe, January 25, 2008\n\nWhen John Coltrane passed away in 1967, he was just a few years into the spiritual quest that his later albums document, with titles like \"Om\" and \"Interstellar Space,\" and the liberation they reflect from conventions of jazz form and expression. Coltrane was only 40 at his death, and no one knows where h"
