I have never seen someone as inspired as he is. I follow him on all social networking sites and have taken some of his online courses. Needless to say, they are awesome. He is awesome. My love and respect for him increased manifold after I read ‘The Saint, The Surfer and The CEO.\n\nThe book answers three important questions that we must all ask ourselves at some point in our own lives. The only three questions, the answers to which will matter when we are on our deathbed awaiting to go where we have all come from.\n\nDid I live wisely?\n\nDid I love well?\n\nDid I serve greatly?\n\nI along with Jack on his unusual journey realised that there is so much more to life than we realise, if only we choose to open our eyes and heart to it. It is imperative to do what we love and to do whatever we do with love.\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nRobin Sharma is an International Best selling Canadian writer, best known for his book ‘The Monk who sold his Ferrari. He is also sought after worldwide as a life coach to people committed to creating extraordinary lives. In 2007, an independent survey of businesspeople named Sharma as one of the most influential leadership gurus in the world.\n\nName of the book : The Saint, The Surfer And The CEO\n\nAuthor: Robin Sharma\n\nPages : 221"
