Sometimes called the “sanitarium of the south,” it was noted for its salubrious climes, which were considered an antidote to havoc wrought on delicate constitutions by tours in the equatorial colonies. Some two centuries later, the heart-shaped landmass 150 miles off the mainland’s southeast coast is still seen as a place of invigorating isolation.\n\nRoughly the same size as West Virginia, with a population of just over half a million, Tasmania is a patchwork of pastures and wilderness surrounded by rugged coastlines and windswept bays. About 50 percent of the island is protected from development; nearly a quarter is World Heritage listed.\n\nThe island’s antipodean charms and violent history have long captured the imagination of artists. William Charles Piguenit, born a convict’s son in Hobart, the Tasmanian capital, in 1836, saw his depictions of the island’s landscape shown in Paris and London around the turn of the 20th century and is widely regarded as one of Australia’s first artists of note. Throughout the 20th century, fine art continued to flourish in Tasmania. The Polish sculptor Ewa Pachucka and the Czech painter Tom Samek were among a slew of international and interstate artists who took up residence there."
