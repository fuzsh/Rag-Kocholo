What we read sounds like the wisdom that we already know, just forgot for the time being, and by focusing our mind on it we find it again.\n\nRobin Sharma: The Saint, the Surfer and the CEO\n\nSome of my favorite ideas/sentiments from the book:\n\n\"Your faith in the fact that this world has your best interests in mind but often send its miracles disguised as difficulties must be far bigger than your fear of those difficulties ruining your life. Your faith in the intelligence of the universe must be a lot larger than your fears that you’re all alone. There’s a much bigger plan unfolding, and you must trust in it. Once you do, the enchantment of your life will be given permission to rise to the surface.” (from \"The Saint, the Surfer, and the CEO: A Remarkable Story About Living Your Heart's Desires\" by Robin Sharma)\n\n\"For your life to be great, your faith must be bigger than your fears. It’s only when you have faith in the fact that, as you say, the universe is a friendly place and it’s bigger than the fears that have limited you—only then will your brightest life come calling.\" (from \"The Saint, the Surfer, and the CEO: A Remarkable Story About Living Your Heart's Desires\" by Robin Sharma)\n\nOne of the practices that I have taken home with me from this book is to have this little word medley on the bedside table, focusing on aligning myself with these principles when I wake up first thing in the morning and before bedtime (feel free to use it or make your own):"
