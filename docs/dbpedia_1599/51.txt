This chapter focuses on Logicofobista exhibition and the International Surrealist Exhibition exhibitions and, especially, the works that Fundacio Angel Planells exhibited on those occasions, which are representative of the artist’s best surrealist production. In 1929, Rene Magritte and Camille Goemans facilitated for Planells the publication of two surrealist drawings in the Belgian magazine Varietes to accompany a poem by Paul Morand. The aesthetic similarity among the six works analysed, with perhaps the exception of Still Life, demonstrates that whether under the umbrella of Logicofobisme or under the more general aegis of surrealism, Planells was indeed producing the same type of work. Roland Penrose’s curatorial activity with regard to Midday Sorrow and Familiar Phantoms was vital in order to grant Planells a certain level of artistic recognition beyond national boundaries. The chapter analyses the historical details of these acquisitions, paying attention to cataloguing processes and ultimately to the procedures that facilitated the relocation of the works to the United States.
