        "text": "Drumroll please! A project 20+ years in the making has finally come to fruition. I am happy to announce the official release of The Girls Who Lived in the Refrigerator! What started off as a bedtime story to entertain my daughters, has now evolved into a children's book offered in four formats - hardcover, paperback, ebook, and an Audible audiobook version - available through Amazon and other distributors, worldwide! As with my previous books, this story did not write or illustrate itself without the support and encouragement of many friends, family and colleagues. I especially want to thank my amazing and loving wife Sharon for always having faith in me and for being my biggest supporter and to my three daughters Chloe, Katie and Madison, who were the inspiration for the food fairies and driving force to share this story with the world. Thank you to Brian Dumm for bringing this story to life through his incredible illustrations and to the countless others who have provided valuable input and guidance along the way. I hope you and your family enjoy The Girls Who Lived in the Refrigerator as much as my family has and can't wait to hear if they were inspired to try new foods, especially fruits and vegetables! Enjoy! Madison Grotto, MBA, RDN, LDN Chloe De Jager Sharon Grotto, RN Kate Grotto Beth Shepard Brian Dumm\n\nThe Girls Who Lived in the Refrigerator releases in 1 week!! Yay! I'm excited to share some early reviews from noted experts which will appear on the first page of the book. Also happy to announce that the website is up - https://lnkd.in/gtkUs2yC “As a pediatric nutritionist, I love the message of The Girls Who Lived in the Refrigerator - it has all the makings of a children's classic: a story line that's perfect for bedtime, but also perfect to read to every child at pre-K! It's a win for kids and a win for parents. Now I want another story about these incredible fairies!” - Keith Ayoob, Ed.D., RDN, Associate Clinical Professor Emeritus of Pediatrics at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City “This delightful story is more than a sweet, entertaining read, it is bound to inspire kids of all ages to step out of their comfort zone, make new friends, try new foods, and maybe even whip up a colorful salad!” - Ellie Krieger MS RDN, Food Network and PBS show host and James Beard award-winning cookbook author “Phenomenally fun…and so adorable! Love the food fairies, Sam and Maisey, and their inspiring messages. This book made me appreciate fruits and vegetables even more than I already do!” - Lisa Lillien, aka “Hungry Girl” and #1 New York Times best-selling author \"As a registered dietitian, there’s nothing better than sharing the joy of healthy eating with others. In his heartwarming book, The Girls Who Lived in the Refrigerator, author David Grotto, RDN (longstanding colleague and friend), beautifully transforms his love for nutritious foods into an enchanting tale of fridge fairies to help ignite children’s curiosity for nourishing fare. Inspired by his own daughters, this story encourages young readers to be adventurous and embrace new foods. It's not just helpful for picky eaters; it's a reminder to everyone about the rewards of exploring new flavors and experiences.\" - Joy Bauer, MS, RDN, Health and Nutrition Expert for NBC’s TODAY Show and #1 New York Times best-selling author Joy Bauer MS, RD @elliekrieger Keith Ayoob Hungry Girl, Inc.\n\nSo excited to be presenting and attending on behalf of Kellanova Away From Home. I will be joined by Alyson Foote from Action for Healthy Kids and Steve Abbott, director of Food and Nutrition Services, Campbell County Schools, as we discuss \"How to Market Like a \"Boss\" to Change Hearts and Minds About the Food YOU Serve in K-12. We will share some great insights on how to debunk myths and misinformation about the quality and nutrition worthiness of the foods served in K-12 today. Steve and Alyson will also address what are effective marketing tools to engage and gain allies with both internal and external stakeholders that impact participation in school meal programs. Hope to see you there! School Nutrition Association #ANC2024 Kellanova\n\nWell...I was going to wait to tell all of you, but I'm too excited not to share this great news!! I have a new book coming out this summer and its my first children's book! And though its not out yet, it is already ranked #1 on Amazon for Children's Multicultural Folktales! I created this story for my daughters when they were young as a unique way to entice them to try different foods and it worked! This story became an important tool to inspire healthy eating that they practice to this very day. As a registered dietitian, I discovered that people value taste and enjoyment above all else, and children are no different. Research shows that colorful iconic characters resonate with young children and can be influential in their choices. #TheGirlsWhoLivedintheRefrigerator is a story where three whimsical food fairies go on an enchanting adventure where they meet Sam, a shy little boy, and his loyal dog, Maisey. Sam is afraid to try new things, but everything changes when he discovers a magical world where refrigerators hold more than just food; they harbor magic and friendship. It's a heartwarming tale of bravery and the wonderful surprises that await when you dare to explore! I’m thrilled to bring the food fairies to families everywhere who want to make eating healthy, both fun and enjoyable and encourages children to make good choices and develop a positive relationship with food. Stay tuned for for the official release! #fruits #vegetables #dairy #magic #friendship #adventure #pickyeaters #fairies #Multiculture #recipe #storytelling"
