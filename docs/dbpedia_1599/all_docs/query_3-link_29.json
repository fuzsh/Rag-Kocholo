The role of qualified nutrition professionals has increasingly been overshadowed by individuals seeking profit, leading to the spread of misleading information about food and metabolism. What is your perspective on this situation? Looking ahead, where do you see qualified nutrition experts in the coming years? Will we have opportunities that offer respect and adequate compensation, or will we need to take on additional responsibilities imposed by firms to sustain our roles? Who bears the responsibility for this shift ‚Äì is it the influence of social media platforms, or are the highly qualified nutritionists, including those with MPhil and PhD degrees or members of professional organizations like the IDA, at fault? Furthermore, what is the value of pursuing a Registered Dietitian (RD) credential if such issues are not addressed? The scope of nutrition, health, and wellness extends far beyond just weight and fat loss; there are many more aspects to consider. I would appreciate your thoughts on how to address these challenges within our profession. Comment belowüëáüèª\n\nIf you're a dietitian or nutritionist - this is for you. Okay, so we've established you're on LinkedIn (you're reading this post aren't you?!) but ... how confident are you that you're using LinkedIn to it's potential? You're right - most dietitians and nutritionist I know are ALL OVER Instagram. But maybe your clients, connections and future employers are on LinkedIn?! Have you thought about that? I'm so pleased to tell you about a course starting in January by the amazing Christianna Gozzi, MA, MS, RD, LD, CDN. In this 5 part online course, she'll make sure you feel super-confident networking on LinkedIn. Learn how to use it to make industry connections, find clients and jobs!

As an early-career dietitian, one piece of advice I always receive from more senior professionals, webinars, TED talks, LinkedIn posts, et cetera is \"find a lane and stay in it\". While I understand that when you pick a subject area as your 'thing', you're able to dedicate more time to mastering said thing and making a name for yourself in that area, I'm not sure I fully support closing yourself off too soon in your professional journey. The field of nutrition/dietetics is super wide and super deep; I could probably name 15 sub-specialties under clinical dietetics alone without stopping to take a breath. I know some people are sure from day 1 what area they'd like to specialise in, but I personally fall in love with various facets the more I learn about them. I chose to study nutrition because I found the idea of clinicals very interesting, particularly targeting diabetes, but before I graduated I had become fascinated by many specialties and in the years since, several more have joined that list. Among the dozens of nutrition branches I've encountered so far, there are only 2 or 3 I'm absolutely positive I don't want to pursue. As my career grows, the opportunities ahead of me are bound to be diverse and abundant. I'd love to hear your thoughts: should I heed the 'Jack of all trades, master of none' admonishment or be like Goldilocks and taste all of life's offerings until I find the one that's just right? Do you think I really, truly, definitely need to pick a niche right now? Have you picked a niche in your industry, and if so, at what stage did you make that decision? #Nutrition #Dietetics #CareerJourney #ProfessionalDevelopment\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£On 2024 a marketing professional can claim to be a qualified nutritionist. 2Ô∏è‚É£An economics graduate can also claim to be a qualified nutritionist. 3Ô∏è‚É£An IT professional can claim to be a qualified nutritionist. 4Ô∏è‚É£A biology teacher can claim to be a qualified health & wellness coach. 5Ô∏è‚É£A mathematician can claim to be a wellness coach. 6Ô∏è‚É£A chef can claim to be a qualified Dietitian. 7Ô∏è‚É£A science doctorate becomes a Dietitian, that to a team lead. All of this without any appropriate certification, degrees or credentials . ü§° But they are able to gather a decent amount of audience from viral social media marketing. ü™Ñ‚ú® The clients never check their qualifications but they check their follower count.ü§° These so-called professionals then hire qualified dietitians. And for that they put up posts here at #linkedin. And people like me, that are qualified professionals pour in comments that they are #interested. All this is true, no sarcasm, no story. Why are we doing this? Why are we promoting such quacks ? As a client why are we not checking credentials of the experts we choose to give responsibility for your health? Please join hands & promote against this everyone. What's your opinion on this ? Let me knowüëá #quack #fake #dietitian #nutritionist #wellness #coaching #marketing\n\n„ÄêFinally official Sports Nutritionist registration! But this is not the end„Äë I couldn‚Äôt bite it because it's paper, not the medal. But otherwise I would! After 4 years since graduation from King‚Äôs, my UK registration as a nutritionist from Association for Nutrition got an expert title in Sports & Exercise. Thank you so much for my mentors who have been providing me unwavering support. Every country has a different system of healthcare professional registration. When I was in the UK, I was exposed to a clear differentiation between Nutritionist and Dietitian. Basically, ‚Äúwho should provide nutrition guidance to whom‚Äù. Are you at the hospital? Dietitians will be the ones to diagnose and treat you. Outside the hospital? Nutritionists are the ones who provide nutrition guidance since that‚Äôs their expertise, outside clinical scope. Of course there are many other cases, but this is the most simplified overview. This is why it's important to collaborate with each other. Just like any other healthcare/medical field, nutrition science is tricky because the evidence or theory we thought is true today could change over time. Getting registered after showing knowledge and capability doesn‚Äôt mean everything, because continuous learning as a professional is required. This paper is like a marriage certificate to me - ‚ÄúI, Yuri Nemoto, do take this profession to live together, to take it seriously, and to never stop learning from new sport nutrition literature. #RNutr #AfN #SportsNutrition"
