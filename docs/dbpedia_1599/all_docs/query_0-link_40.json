In these essays, leading Hispanists explore the dialogue and interrelation between cultural discourses and artistic practices in a variety of nineteenth- and twentieth-century texts from the perspectives of literary criticism, cultural analysis, media studies, politics and the history of art. The contributors address fundamental questions about the relationship between artistic media and cultural fields and provide insights into the way identities -- social, political or cultural -- are bound up with the textual.\n\nFederico Bonaddio and Xon de Ros lecture in Modern Spanish Studies at King's College London.\n\nReviews:\n\n‘Federico Bonaddio and Xon de Ros have put together a very useful series of short and punchy articles which span over a hundred and fifty years of Spanish culture, from the 1860s to the present day... Without doubt this collection would make an excellent addition to any university library. The essays on canonical texts may very well prove invaluable to undergraduate students while those on lesser-known writers, artists, and cinematographers will surely fulfil the same function for postgraduates and the academic community in general.’ — Jean Andrews, Modern Language Review 101.3, July 2006, 876-77 (full text online)\n\nContents:\n\nCite this volume in standard MHRA style\n\nBibliography entry:\n\nBonaddio, Federico, and Xon de Ros (eds), Crossing Fields in Modern Spanish Culture (Legenda, 2003)\n\nFirst footnote reference: 35 Crossing Fields in Modern Spanish Culture, ed. by Federico Bonaddio and Xon de Ros (Legenda, 2003), p. 21.\n\nSubsequent footnote reference: 37 Bonaddio and Ros, p. 47.\n\n(To see how these citations were worked out, follow this link.)\n\nCite this volume in MHRA author-date style\n\nBibliography entry:\n\nBonaddio, Federico, and Xon de Ros (eds). 2003.
