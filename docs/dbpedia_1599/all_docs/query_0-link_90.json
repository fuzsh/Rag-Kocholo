As you may be aware, the Europeans culturally have very stringent privacy standards, an issue they almost define with their identity. The Americans on the other hand ascribe the same stringent standards to the Freedom of Expression, thereby resulting in something that can only be construed as The Clash of Civilizations in its truest sense. This has manifested itself in the now (in)famous Google case in France where the French court has ruled effectively that a persons data is their own, and if it is inadequate, irrelevant, no longer relevant or excessive a person can request for links to that search be removed by Google. Re-iterating a person’s Right to be Forgotten.\n\nHowever, Google’s position which has been supported by a number of US civil rights organisations including the EFF (article below) believes that CNIL, the French regulatory authority position is excessive as it demands that not only should the search results be removed from the European sites like Google.fr and Google.uk and Google.com (which after a struggle Google has recently complied with) but all sites worldwide. However, Google has appealed CNIL’s position to the highest French court challenging its order to remove all the links across the whole wide world. This according to Google would set a dangerous precedent as other not so democratic countries may want unsavoury information about their acts of repression also removed. This would also infringe US laws resulting in stifling speech in the US.\n\nThis is such a fascinatingly complex issue, I’m going to try and reduce it to its bare bones with clips and illustrations trying to identify the issues and balance the argument.\n\nFirst of all, can you imagine a universe with eternal memory…well that’s where the internet is taking us (I honestly see no escape). Imagine NOT being unable to forget the pain of a parents demise, the pain of a lost child, the pain of childbirth, honestly if each memory lay vivid in our imagination all day everyday, it would be a trauma to live, to awake to a new dawn, to try again, to cross the finish line, to cradle a bundle of joy. And yet, some memories serve a wonderful purpose for we remember to turn off the stove, we remember to wedge the baby with cushions as we prepare its feed, and we remember to look left and right before crossing the street (literally and metaphorically), and we remember to stub out our cigarettes before we dispose of them least we have all of our golden hillsides and Berkeley in flames again.\n\nHowever there is a medical condition called Hyperthymesia where a person cannot forget, has full memory of all the events that have dotted his/her past. See the brilliant NPR article below and the associated nightmare of not being able to forget. Also see below the Telegraph article about the Channel 4 documentary on the same issue. These are real issues and the Europeans are justifiably passionate about them. Viewing it from an American perspective, we have to recognise the dilemma presented and the cultural basis from which it stems. Remember we creatures on the Galapagos have now forged our own unique culture.\n\nNPR: When Memories Never Fade The Past Can Poison the Present\n\nhttp://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/12/18/255285479/when-memories-never-fade-the-past-can-poison-the-present\n\nThe Telegraph: The Boy Who Cant Forget\n\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9563744/The-Boy-who-Cant-Forget-Channel-4-preview.html\n\nSee below the articles by The Guardian and Peter Fleischer (Google):\n\nThe Guardian – Google takes the right to be forgotten to the highest court:\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/19/google-right-to-be-forgotten-fight-france-highest-court\n\nGoogle is appealing to France’s highest court so that it is not compelled to censor search results worldwide. “We comply with the laws of the countries in which we operate. But if French law applies globally, how long will it be until other countries – perhaps less open and democratic – start demanding that their laws regulating information likewise have global reach?”\n\nReflecting on the Right to be Forgotten – Peter Fleischer, Global Privacy Counsel\n\nhttps://blog.google/topics/google-europe/reflecting-right-be-forgotten/\n\nFletcher outlining his position as defending the right of each country to balance the freedom of expression and privacy it chooses, not what is imposed upon it, ie, what another country chooses for it. Delisted links on all European versions of google search like Google.fr, google.uk and in March 2016 also removed links from Google.com so that persons from countries requesting delisting could NOT access the requested blocked links. CNIL request based on the EU Right to be forgotten is that it be blocked from everywhere, ie, every country on the globe.\n\nFinally, but most significantly, The EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation, see article below) has come out in support of Google position stating that it has an issue with France’s unilateral declaration of universal jurisdiction, ie, that France cannot unilaterally decree what a global citizen, not resident in France (or the EU) can view or not view. They cannot dictate the terms of the world’s viewership and access as it is out of their jurisdiction. Specifically by highlighting US law and the US position on the Freedom of Expression:\n\n– US publishers have a right to publish truthful information (acquired legally) pertaining to a matter of public interest even if it conflicts with privacy interests\n\n– US publishers have the right to publish information contained in public court documents\n\n– Accurate republication of statements made during official proceedings\n\n– US law protects internet intermediaries (like Google) based on content provided by 3rd parties\n\n– The Right to receive information, advertise and be advertised to (would all be compromised by CNIL’s regulations)\n\nEFF – Right to be forgotten\n\nhttps://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/11/we-wont-let-you-forget-it-why-we-oppose-french-attempts-export-right-be-forgotten\n\nRights at Odds: Europes Right to be Forgotten Clashes with US Law https://www.eff.org/files/2016/11/29/rtbf-us_law_legal_background.pdf\n\nIn my (first generation immigrant) opinion, there needs to be a balance between right to privacy and freedom of expression as without privacy there can be no freedoms. The court protected publication of a sexual assault victim’s info (Daily Mail Rule as mentioned in the EFF article above) and publication of documents of persons who have been rehabilitated and merged back into society, in my opinion upsets this fine balance as society aims not just to punish but protect, rehabilitate and reincorporate persons into society giving them a second chance, and this goal of society would be stripped if records of misdeeds are always front and centre looming for eternity. No one would be motivated to reform, rehabilitate as they would be no exit from jail time in jail or out in society. We also have to recognise that publication in the online sphere is not mere publication of a document like ink on paper, but like the printing press which served to propagate news across a broad spectrum but still contained it within a certain geographic region, publication in the online sphere is nothing like the printing press or publications that man has known before, for it publishes information exponentially, as there are no boundaries or barriers to the propagation of this information. I would still like to adhere to the basic tenet: To Err is Human, To Forgive Divine. And would hope that laws made by humans for humans would take that into consideration.\n\nMy opinion falls more in line with the following comment by Julia Powels (Univ of Cambridge researcher on Law and Technology) taken from her article below: There is a public sphere of memory and truth, and there is a private one. This is fundamental to higher, egalitarian values. Without the freedom to be private, we have precious little freedom at all.\n\nJimmy Wales is wrong: we do have a personal right to be forgotten\n\nJulia Powles (a law and technology researcher at University of Cambridge)\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/08/jimmy-wales-right-to-be-forgotten-wikipedia\n\nHowever, all said and done about privacy, I too don’t believe it is or should be in the jurisdiction of one nation or group to determine the mode, form or fashion of information generated and accessed by all of humanity. Perhaps this dilemma about the Right to be Forgotten, EU customs V US customs, will provide us with the opportunity to define the issue. Very simplistically:\n\n– Who decides, which one makes the call about what is correct and acceptable, the procedure to follow – ie – The Code of the Net\n\n– Can any one country dictate this code based on the customs and code in their territorial space and expect it to be applied universally across this new realm – the Net\n\n– All this boils down to the core issue of what is the Code of the Net, which laws apply and how do the customs culture and laws the nations of the world translate into this cybersphere\n\n– There is a need for consensus in both the territorial and cyberworld. The laws of the territorial world we have already seen cannot be blindly imposed upon the cyberworld and expected to be seamlessly applied. The denizens of the cyberworld might not fall into the neat categories of the territorial nations they physically inhabit or are aligned with, they may each have their own identity and allegiance online. They may be grouped based on a distinct philosophy, they may have acquired value/ status in the cyber realm not based age and education but interaction and presence, contribution to the expansion of the cyberworld thus generating value in this space as opposed to the real world. We already have a host of undefined tax issues relating to the same.\n\n– However these are humans inhabiting this world so they are bound to fall into philosophically and ideologically distinct groups which will represent the Nations of the Net. Eventually any laws passed by the nations of the real world would also require to have consensus amongst the Nations of the Net which at this point appear to be ruled by Pirates as they attempt to escape the real world and take shelter in this alternate space. Only upon getting the consensus of the Pirate Lords can the codes that originate in the real world have any hope of being applied in the cyber world.\n\nSee clip below of my fav movie of all times The Pirates of the Caribbean. Pirates of the Caribbean At World’s End –\n\nThis is a classic tale of the establishment /oppressive powers of the British Colonists, Spanish Empire and The East India Company versus the anti establishment fighting for their right to exist and express represented by the Pirates.\n\nIn the following clip from the above movie the Pirate lords convene in Shipwreck Cove to elect a pirate leader who would unleash Calypso. See below Peter Coffin’s Pirate at The De Young Museum, San Francisco below:\n\nhttps://www.sfchronicle.com/entertainment/garchik/article/The-shiny-new-swashbuckler-in-the-de-Young-Garden-10941641.php\n\nFrom the above linked article: Coffin emailed to make his point of view clear: “I believe the spirit of San Francisco still embodies the ideas of ‘the West,’ where dreams come from, where the frontier expands to the ocean, etc. That sense … is closely tied to its unwillingness to be restricted, its history of resistance and its fight for freedom against authoritarianism.”\n\nOur story continues…Feng, the Singapore pirate lord appoints Elizabeth Swann as his successor as Pirate Lord before dying. Thus Elizabeth’s presence at the Brethren Court ( and I am of course Elizabeth Swann in an alternate world being appointed by Feng Gic, the Pirate Lords of Singapore and the Straits of Malacca). Upon identifying themselves and confirming their attendance with their pieces of eight, the Pirate Lords are compelled to vote for a Pirate King upon whose command Calypso would be released. Each pirate of course votes for himself, but here Jack Sparrow votes for Elizabeth Swann and she gets elected as the Pirate King.\n\nSee Purnima in Singapore with the Pirate Lords of Singapore and The Straits of Malacca.

A leaf from my diary –\n\nThe Ballad of the South.\n\nThe story opens in Madras on February 22nd, 1914, the night my paternal grandmother Kowshiki was born. It was a night etched in Madras history as a sneaky pirate ship, a German light cruiser called the SMS Emden slowly snuck up into the Madras harbour and bombarded it until all the Burmah Shell petroleum reserves had blown up and the harbour was in flames. This theatre of this audacious pirate ship that dodged all in its path unfolded in the first couple of weeks of World War I. The aim of this attack being to blow up the British colonial assets, ie, the petroleum stocked in the harbour by Burmah Shell Company. The SMS Emden was also known as The Swan of the East and was harboured at the port city of Tsingtao (my fav beer) and commanded by the very smart officer Karl Von Muller who managed to unleash a trail of chaos upon the South China seas sabotaging and destroying the Allied ships and resources that came in its path, and yet managing to travel undetected in the high seas. The captain cleverly camouflaged his ship by adding an additional dummy smokestack in order to resemble a British ship, and once near it would hoist its colours like a pirate would and embark on a full fledged attack. Through these tactics and its deft evasion skills it gained great fame/ notoriety and its journey, its story and the story of its crew is memorialised in much of history, film and literature.\n\nThe story of the Emden is very relevant to the my story, The Ballad of The South, because my great grandfather, S. Duraiswami Iyer, who was a prominent lawyer in the Madras High Court and an a covert revolutionary fighting for India’s independence from British rule, celebrated this event (ie) the blowing up of the British Colonial assets by a pirate ship that had snuck into the harbor on the night of the birth of his first child, and seized this opportunity to thumb it to the British colonists by naming her Emden. So my grandmother was named Kowshiki Emden. As you can see from the image below my grandmother Kowshiki was truly The Swan of the East. This was a name she wore for many years until she was teased to tears (for Emden was known in Tamil to connote someone sly and treacherous like the ship)and forced her father to change it Kowshiki in the birth records.\n\nImage of my grandmother Kowshiki – Swan of the East:\n\nSee below the fabulous clips about the voyage of the SMS Emden and the plague in Madras:\n\nMilitary History Now – The Astounding Voyage of the SMS Emden:https://militaryhistorynow.com/2013/05/08/the-kaisers-pirate-ship-the-unbelievable-voyage-of-the-sms-emden/\n\nThe Story of the SMS Emden – The Great War\n\nMadras – The Emden Plaque – Memorializing the night of September 22, 1914 and the bombardment by the German Cruiser SMS Emden of Madras Harbor:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SMS_Emden_Plague.JPG\n\nPlaque regarding bombardment of Madras. This plaque is near the Judge’s gate at Madras high-court.\n\nEmden – The Pirate Ship – Must read article in The Hindu:\n\nhttps://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/how-german-cruiser-emden-struck-terror-in-the-heart-of-the-british-empire-and-became-a-tamil-word/article30881258.ece\n\nThe Bombardment of Madras Harbor:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bombardment_of_Madras_by_S.S._Emden_1914.jpg\n\nThe Men of Emden – movie (2012)\n\nSuch was the passion of the freedom fighters from the South(India), that even a grand personal home like Palm Grove, our ancestral home in the south where my father and his siblings were born, and now is a part of the historic home tour of Madras, was given away by my great grandfather S. Duraiswami Iyer along with all his other assets to the Aurobindo Ashram and to the revolutionary cause for which he had sacrificed his blood, sweat, tears and family to gain India’s Freedom from British Colonial rule.\n\nMy grandmother used to recount that this was a home where great artists, writers, poets, philosophers and freedom fighters were housed and taken care of. The evenings used to resound with dramatic orations from Subramania Bharati considered the greatest of modern Tamil poets, and music from the veena that wafted from the balconies while my grandmother Kowshiki sat on the lap of Ramana Maharishi (a much regarded Hindu sage and philosopher known to have achieved liberation or “Jivan-mukta”) as he recounted to her the meaning of life. This is the story of the Tamil people and one that seems to have slipped from their collective memories as the great revolutionaries from the southern states are all but forgotten within barely a mention in any of our history books. Where are these stories from the south of valour and passion, intrigue and revolution to uphold freedom and liberty which would excite the imaginations of children even today, stories of S Duraiswami in Surat in 1907 or his clandestine helping of the revolutionaries by finding novel means of getting messages across to Subramania Bharati who was sheltered (by the French) in Pondicherry, or even S Duraiswami being sent as an envoy of Aurobindo to meet with Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress (the Crips mission) and dissuade them from partitioning the country. I don’t remember reading about these southern revolutionaries, fired and inspired by their tactics and stories to free their Motherland, in my history books in Delhi or Madras or even Calcutta. Suchi, “Vande Mataram” was the cry echoed across India, regardless of the language of the people, this cry formed the core of S Duraiswami Iyer, as he embraced it as his life’s motto. For Madras to forget or not to forget is now irrelevant as this memory is to be rebuilt in the New World, see below S. Duraiswami Iyer:\n\nImage S Duraiswami Iyer:\n\nCrips Mission and S Duraiswami:\n\nhttp://sabda.sriaurobindoashram.org/catalog/show.php?id=eNews1204\n\nPalm Grove – S Duraiswami Iyer’s home\n\nhttp://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/from-one-mans-home-to-many-childrens-school/article4161345.ece\n\nRoots\n\nhttp://madrasmusings.com/Vol%2019%20No%2016/historic_residences_of_chennai_31.html\n\nMusic to Dust – The House of Tiruvottiyur Tyagier:\n\nhttps://sriramv.wordpress.com/2012/12/18/music-to-dust-the-house-of-tiruvottiyur-tyagier/\n\nIronically, but very aptly even though my great grandfather was funding and working covertly with the revolutionaries to overthrow British Colonial rule in India, thus celebrating the German light cruiser SMS Eden’s assault on British assets, ie, the oil tanks of the Burmah Shell company that were located in the Madras harbour and naming his first child, my grandmother Kowshiki, Emden. S Duraiswami’s son, and my grandmothers brother Thyagarajan “Tiger” who was studying in England upon the breaking out of WWII joined the RAF and went on to blow up the assets of Nazi Germany. His purpose was completely inspired and in line with his father, S Duraiswami Iyer, for Tiger in his capacity, wished to do his best to help remove the tyranny and injustice of the fascist forces (Nazis) like his father had striven to dedicate his life to get rid of the tyranny and injustice imposed upon the people of India by the British Colonial forces.\n\nSee below a well compiled profile dedicated to the memory of my grand uncle “Tiger” Thyagarajan of the Whirlwind Fighter Squadron (1943) by Aircrew Remembered in the link below:\n\nhttp://aircrewremembered.com/thyagarajan-sayana-puram.html\n\nTall handsome Tiger, my grandmother’s favourite sibling and the one she remembered and missed most with all her heart until the day she passed, and one who was the rightful inheritor of my great grandfathers legacy, sharing his passion for justice, and our base in the South, and was shot down over Normandy ton the 25th August 1944, the day Paris was liberated. His remains were collected and buried in a church in Normandy, the memory being narrated by a child who saw the plane crash into the fields (see below). There was also a memorial service by the French, British and Indian nationals recognising his valour and contribution. Thus ends the story and the links to the south of my family, this long forgotten family of Madras.\n\nSee below Tiger Thyagarajan on the engine cowl:\n\nI shared this post on the 101st birthday of my granduncle Tiger Thyagarajan: Tiger was our family’s anchor to the South (India), the eldest son of an old musical family. He was fired with the same passion that flowed through my family that had sacrificed much resisting British colonial rule in India. Upon the outbreak of WWII, he followed on his footsteps, but this time aligning with the British by joining the RAF to crush the forces of bigotry and oppression. His typhoon fighter jet plane was shot down on a field in Normandy the day Paris was liberated.\n\nA wonderful article and a fitting tribute to Pilot Officer Sayanapuram Duraiswamy Thyagarajan (Tiger) written by David McMahon\n\nhttp://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/history/ww2/veterans/1048-thyagarajan.html\n\nVoice of Britain – 1944- One of Our Aircrafts are Missing (video clip):\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/xo969rupwxdroii/TIGER-%20One%20of%20our%20aircraft%20is%20missing.mpg?dl=0\n\nImages of “Tiger” Thyagarajan:\n\nhttp://www.cieldegloire.com/002_riaf_thyagarajan_s_d.php\n\nThe story of Tiger Thyagarajan is especially poignant, as the family gradually moved out of Madras due to the pressure of continuous surveillance by the British, with my great gandmother Meenakshi leaving Madras with the children to settle in Pondicherry by 1927 under the protection and shelter of Sri Aurobindo, at Aurobindo Ashram. As this French controlled part of India was adjacent to Madras presidency, S Duraiswami Iyer continued his work at the Madras High Court at the same time covertly supported the revolutionary cause. Sri Aurobindo, the great philosopher and revolutionary, based in Pondicherry and supported by the French was the anchor for the revolutionary movement, fanning the cries of Vande Mataram or freedom of the motherland for the revolutionaries across India, especially in the South. Tiger spent his youth here in French India at the Aurobindo ashram and breathed his last as his typhoon fighter jet crashed into the below pasted field in Normandy, France on 25th August, 1944, the day Paris was liberated, liberating what he called his Mother’s Land. Both for his mother who was sheltered and embraced by Aurobindo and The Mother, Sri Aurobindo’s spiritual partner in the Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry, French India. She joined the ashram in 1927 and continued to live there till the end of her life 1993, well after Pondicherry accession into the Republic of India 1962.\n\nSee Tiger Thyagarajan below(right) with his brother Mitran (@Sorbonne) on the left in this old photo from The Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry, India:\n\nField in Normandy where Tiger’s RAF typhoon aircraft crashed on August 25th, 1944.\n\nThe Soldier – Poem by Rupert Brooke – Quoting the same, my fathers words for his uncle “In that Rich Earth, a Richer Dust Concealed”\n\nhttps://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/soldier\n\n“Tiger” Thyagarajan the RAF Pilot – website\n\nhttp://www.cieldegloire.com/002_riaf_thyagarajan_s_d.php\n\nMemorial held for Thyagarajan in Normandy by the British, French and Indians with a plaque that commemorates Tiger Thyagaran’s sacrifice at The Battle of Normandy. Tiger’s remains were taken by the priest and buried in the church of La Lande-Saint-Léger near the field where his typhoon fighter jet crashed. My grandmother who was unable to journey to Normandy for the ceremony was very touched to hear that a memorial was being held for her beloved long lost brother, the one she mentioned all the time to me as he lived vivid in all her memories. She was especially touched that the tombstone over her brother’s grave read- Aum Bhagavate Namah – Here Lies A Hindu Airman :\n\nThe Remains of The Tiger\n\nWe Shall Not Forget\n\n*The RAF Typhoon Aircraft:\n\n*Hawker Typhoon – incredible sound\n\n*Typhoon aircraft documentary- photo of Tiger sitting on the engine cowl:\n\nOut of Duraiswami’s large family of five children, only Kowshiki (my grandmother) survived and married Viswanathan. I’d like to think that my grandfather Venkat Viswanathan ICS, who was so much a part of the British Raj, (the very people my revolutionary Great grandfather was fighting), was the reason why the story of Duraiswami Iyer continues to this day as I carry forward not only S Duraiswami Iyer’s blood but his fire to the New World!\n\nHope you enjoyed the ballad from The House of Tiruvottiyur Tyagier, tell me can you hear the music?\n\nBig hugs\n\nPurnima\n\nPS: See in pic below all the characters of the Grand Theatre of the South.\n\n(Top row L-R): Mithran Iyer (@Sorbonne) Duraiswami’s son, (?),(?), V.Viswanathan(Palghat- my grandfather), S.Duraiswami Iyer (The Madras lawyer/revolutionary – my great grandfather) holding my aunt Kadambari, Tiger Thyagarajan (RAF) my granduncle Duraiswami’s son, shot over Normandy and buried there.\n\n(Bottom Row Seated L-R) ?, My great-grandmother from Palghat with my father Vijay Viswanathan on her lap, (?), Kowshiki “Emden” Viswanathan (my paternal grandmother), Anu Iyer (grand aunt) daughter of Duraiswami Iyer with my uncle PK Viswanathan resting his arm on her lap, (?)\n\nDear Suchi,\n\nAfter prompting you to review all our correspondence to check if it can be published unedited, I found myself doing the same expecting the regular errors of auto correct, missing words, grammatical and punctuation related errors and omissions which can result from uncontrived spontaneous writing and require no editing in my opinion. However, I stumbled upon this inexcusable error, the omission of a negative, the word “not” which renders the entire analysis bankrupt. So, I am compelled in this specific instance to make the correction, insert the missing word “not”, and resend the letter. See below:\n\nReflecting on the Right to be Forgotten – Peter Fleischer, Global Privacy Counsel\n\nhttps://blog.google/topics/google-europe/reflecting-right-be-forgotten/\n\nFletcher outlining his position as defending the right of each country to balance the freedom of expression and privacy it chooses, not what is imposed upon it, ie, what another country chooses for it. Delisted links on all european versions of google search like Google.fr, google.uk and in March 2016 also removed links from Google.com so that persons from countries requesting delisting could NOT access the requested blocked links.\n\nAnd since I have ventured to edit and resend this letter, I have taken the liberty of adding an additional hyperlink relating to my grandmother brother Thyagarajan “Tiger”, the RAF pilot shot over Normandy on the day Paris was liberated. This link is absolutely essential as it has his details and his photos capturing the charismatic persona that my grandmother never stopped talking about. She was well into her 80’s when they announced that they had founds her brothers remains on a field in Normandy. It was a lifetimes wait for her and I am so glad she left knowing that he was found, embraced by the community, carried into a church and buried in their grounds with a plaque that stated “Here lies a Hindu airman”.

But this is a mild error compared to others I have encountered including having my phone hacked (by my kids) and words replaced, where every time I typed baby or darling it would autocorrect to an obscenity. But this I still would not touch as it could be recognized as an autocorrect error. I would like to keep the natural flow as much as possible.\n\nI’m off to Delhi for a day tomorrow for my cousin 50th. She is my fathers elder brothers (Priya Kumar Viswanathan)daughter, the one who grew up in Bombay. And if my family story couldn’t get more complex, her father, Priya Kumar Viswanathan, my grandmother Kowshiki “Emden’s” eldest son, joined the Burmah Shell Oil Company right out of college, yes the assets of the one that the SMS Emden bombed in Madras harbor the night that my grandmother was born. For Burmah Shell was British Petroleum. He retired relinquishing the proposed chairmanship option to join the Dutch (Phillips). So there we have it, circles within circles. All a part of our great boxwalla story!\n\nCircles within Circles: Dear Suchi, my uncle Priya Viswanathan, my dad’s elder brother, my grandmother Kowshiki’s (Emden’s) son, was the quintessential Company Man. He joined Burmah Shell straight out of college and spend most of his career at the helm of this grand ship. Burmah Shell, a joint venture with Shell was the Indian successor to The Burmah Oil Corporation, the largest oil company of the British Empire. The Meg that was the Burmah Oil Corporation we know today as BP or British Petroleum. So, in my family story, The Ballad of The South, the son of Emden (my grandmother Kowshiki) and the grandson of S.Duraiswami Iyer, the fierce nationalist from the south who named his daughter Emden because she was born the night that the German light cruiser The SMS Emden slunk into Madras harbor and blew up the tankers of British Petroleum assets lining Madras Harbor, went on to to lead this very same company, relic of the British Empire in India, as a highly regarded Company Man. Circles within circles!\n\nSee below my uncle Priya Viswanathan, the quintessential Company Man: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/t5lgfegp6sioboea3frlr/Screenshot-2024-05-08-at-9.48.53-PM.jpg?rlkey=dey070a1rqst3bdt2o787axpn&dl=0\n\nAnd to wrap up, since we on the subject of pirate ships I have to share a clip, a mini theater I created, inspired by a visit to The Maritime Museum of San Diego where I found my long lost wheels or should i say fins. Upon standing on the hull of the USS Dolphin, the deepest diving (mechanical submarine) in the world, I found it reverberating, being breathed back into life (despite having it’s engine removed) upon meeting its long lost captain lol! I quickly made my way to its command center, engine room, grabbed its suspended periscope and recreated an episode from this very blog, The Ballad of the South. Of course, in that instance, the SMS Emden was a light cruiser, a ship above water, in my instance it was a Submarine. I peered out of its periscope pretending we had slunk into Madras harbor undetected in the inky darkness of the night and had spotted the tanks of British Petroleum lining Madras harbor, The next command was to unleash the torpedoes, and fire of course recreating a slice of world military history and the story of my family from the South.\n\nVideo links pasted below:\n\nhttp://USS Dolphin-Ballad of the south-Emden-British petroleum.MOV\n\nhttp://USS Dolphin -The Ballad of the south-Emden.MOV\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/hyi48y779msg6mc1emea6/USS-Dolphin-Ballad-of-The-South-Tiger-RAF-Emden.MOV?rlkey=jfiv08n9538wo8ncpwafsbcxa&dl=0\n\nWith the tale of the USS Dolphin, I bring our stories of the Old World into the New World, for upon assuming command, I have 20,000 leagues and a world of adventures that I have committed to cover, this is for all my girls out there all over the world, dream on, follow on.\n\nMay 13, 2024\n\nDear Suchi, After assuming various personas for the above pasted video clips, like captain Karl Muller of the SMS Emden, I assumed command of the USS Dolphin (please note this is a headless Dolphin for its brain /engine lives outside its body) and have pledged to traverse 20,000 leagues across oceans and cultures, battling giant squids and other archaic weapon wielding life forms in order to serve as an example and empower my girls with the belief that when the hurdles appear insurmountable, it’s not the time to cry or die, but to embrace the steely hub of the USS Dolphin and plough through the troubles with single minded devotion, till they get to the other side.\n\nUSS Dolphin – 20,000 LEAGUES\n\nhttp://20,000 LEAGUES https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/equ14004l3i51q95e28nm/The-USS-Dolphin-20-000-leagues-Load-The-Torpedoes.MOV?rlkey=i1nflft04saml8vo5fhirpio7&amp;dl=0\n\nBig hugs will write when I’m back!

It was the quickest visit yet and I’m now back to complete part II of my letter which I must complete otherwise this too (along with the other many half finished mental drafts) will drift off into ether by the morn. To keep the flow, I am re-sending part I, but do scroll down to part II to continue.\n\nPart II\n\nNow Roger, prying you away from pictographs and logograms, I wish to hold your hand and take you on a journey where these pictograms and logographs have been words, language generating art, culture, poetry for many millennia. A journey along the Silk Road as my birthday gift.\n\nAs I had mentioned to you in my earlier emails, my youngest aunt, my mothers youngest sister’s birthday also falls on October 7th, and that makes me feel especially connected with you as she not only raised me as a baby, but also continued to have a special impact on my life through adulthood. She was our spectacularly charming beautiful young aunt who was closely involved with raising and caring for every child of the family, until of course she was taken by the tribes of the North (yes the people of Peshawar/Tora Bora). She left laden with her weight in gold, her eyes forever California Dreaming. We all remember her very fondly on this day, and I dedicate this following song to her, to you and all those born on October 7th, the ones forever looking beyond the horizon. Do see my aunt Renu Shourie California Dreaming below:\n\nSee Renu as a bride below leaving our home bedecked in the gold of the Tribes from the Borderlands – Peshawar and Tora Bora (There’s a lot of gold in dem dar caves!):\n\nDo watch a song which I dedicate to my aunt Renu one who evokes its music and ethos, see below from Coke Studio- Bibi Sanam:\n\nhttp://grapesaresour.blogspot.in/2010/06/bibi-sanam-janam-lyrics.html\n\nThis beautiful song from Afghanistan sung in Daari( Farsi or Persian) is a melody about a beautiful woman(our beloved aunt), as sweet as the pomegranate of Sistan, whose home is at the gates of Tashkurgan. So as my aunts eyes wander to the horizon, this song leads her to her home, the gates of Tashkurgan. So remember as the bombs hit Afghanistan, they pass over her as she sits there listening to these nostalgic tunes in Daari with glazed eyes making rotis (bread) over an open fire for her two lovely daughters.\n\nSee below a video from Coke Studio about the performance of the song Bibi Sanam Janem. Here the musicians share that through this performance they are giving breath to their old folk song about love from the Herat province of Afghanistan:https://youtu.be/I9KVeJy6J2o\n\nTashkurgan almost has a mythic dimension, and was for long a central point in northern Afghanistan (Kholm) an important destination along the Silk Road, and a place remembered as Aornos, Alexanders last bastion. It is also a place in the East in Xinjiang, along the silk road. Before we head out along the Silk Road, let me head south with you to Peshawar, the capital of the North West Frontier provinces and forward in time, to the British Raj. I would like to share with you Rudyard Kiplings Ballad of East and West published in 1889 and often remembered by these misquoted lines:\n\nDo see the following link The Ballad of The East and West: http://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/poems_eastwest.htm\n\n0h, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet,\n\nTill Earth and Sky stand presently at God’s great Judgment Seat;\n\nOf course the poem ends with with the assertion that all distinctions are irrelevant when two men of great courage stand face to face, as evidenced by the following lines from the above link:\n\nBut there is neither East nor West, Border, nor Breed, nor Birth,\n\nWhen two strong men stand face to face, though they come from the ends of the earth!\n\nHowever, my take extends Kipling and goes on to say that East and West, Kamal and the Colonel’s son represented by me and you, do come together in a space beyond that of equal courage and strength, in a new land, far away, one that is neither the East or the West, but is a whole New World. Yes Roger, this is our story for in the New World, we meet, Europe and Asia. So since I have assumed the persona of Kamal the fleet footed Afghan horse thief (quite aptly so) who so flagrantly raids the border between Afghanistan and British India/ Peshawar, and I have assigned for you the role of the Colonel’s son. I wish for you to know that I take your most beautiful horse just for the chase. And I take you outside the borders of this poem, beyond the point of no return, through the Khyber pass to the gates of Tashkurgan and for a journey along the Silk Road.\n\nSee below a fab find at the book fair in Aix-en-Provence, you will find me in its pages: Air de Chasse, illustrations by Jacques Cartier\n\nBut before we proceed, once again we have to stall and return today and our life as we live it.\n\nIn answer to your question about Tara and her future plans, I have some great news to share, Tara is confirmed to go for the exchange program to France in February, and she is over the moon. It has been a long tough journey for Tara, as she been moved from destination to destination, continuously being uprooted, journeying far away from home. I know I often revert back to my favourite poem by Longfellow, Evangeline – A Tale of Acadie, but Roger this is a true story, its Tara’s story in Pictures, a poem and a few words.\n\nSee link Longfellows Evangeline: http://www.hwlongfellow.org/works_evangeline.shtml\n\nTara was conceived in Arcadia (even though this was a beautiful place in Singapore), and she took her first few steps in California where she blossomed and grew under the California sun in her charming home surrounded by fragrant flowers and many types of tree ripened fruit, her sibling, her parents and her friends. Then the storm came which brought with it fire, and she had to flee her charmed life and home. Like Evangeline she boarded a boat with all her household gods and set sail to an unknown future. Do see pictures posted of Tara/Evangeline with the following lines from Evangeline pasted below from the following link: http://www.bartleby.com/42/791.html\n\nMANY a weary year had passed since the burning of Grand-Pré,\n\nWhen on the falling tide the freighted vessels departed,\n\nBearing a nation, with all its household gods, into exile,\n\nExile without an end, and without an example in story.\n\nDo see the attached image of Tara’s first home with her household gods (from an article in the Singapore Tatler June 2000), and the images of a Goa sculpture of Saint Francis and the many Gandharas (buddha friezes and heads). I have also attached Tara’s home in Geneva with its household gods and images. Our story of Evangeline, Grand pre and Tara continues on to Angers, France. However, as the journey has been hard and long, Tara’s household goods and gods are scattered around the globe, as she moves from one shore onto another searching for home. However, in my interpretation of Evangeline, Tara does return to Acadie, and into the arms of her beloved who will be waiting for her at her journeys end.\n\nBut the household gods, the Gandharas, from the attached images take us back to Kamal and the Colonels son, back to Tashkurgan and the Silk Road.\n\nSee below The Centaur-Sea Serpent Gandhara Lintels from The Asian Art Museum San Francisco, showcasing a distinctive fusion of Greek and Central and South Asian Styles:\n\nhttp://AAM Centaur Sea Serpents http://searchcollection.asianart.org/view/objects/asitem/search@/11?t:state:flow=382d91f4-7d30-4247-93e2-0a6ec780a973\n\nThese sculptures particularly took my fancy, as steeped in the legend of Andromeda who is captured by the sea monster Cetus whom the valiant Perseus slays, is a legend which I have made my own (from a previous blog where I embrace the role of the mother of Perseus), see links to the sea monster Cetus from the Greek legend:\n\nhttps://mythus.fandom.com/wiki/Cetus\n\nhttps://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/constellations/cetus.html\n\nSee below an echo from the Old World reflected in the sparkling waters of The New World: The Sea Horse-Sea Serpent sculptures of the Clarence F. Buckingham Memorial Fountain in Chicago (Chicago being an apt destination as my story is connected to this charming city and the old Continental Bank of Chicago) which features four sets of Art Deco style sea horses representing the four states that border Lake Michigan. And in one of these states lived a Nereid, a sea nymph, who anticipated the arrival of a baby to born far away on a island in the exotic east, a birth she celebrated, a baby she embraced, perhaps it was whispered in the wind sweeping the icy stretches of Minnesota that the brave and valiant Perseus from Greek mythology was earth bound: https://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks-facilities/clarence-f-buckingham-memorial-fountain\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/e60grkm6wwfl9xa/Clarence%20F.%20Buckingham%20Memorial%20Fountain-Chicago.MOV?dl=0\n\nSee the beautiful Nereid below in the image of Judith Soobee standing in the middle of the Buckingham memorial fountain with the water snorting Sea Horse-Sea Serpents representing one of the states that borders lake Michigan looking out for the baby Perseus. The Sea Horse Sea Serpents of the Buckingham Memorial fountain is reminiscent of the Indo-Greek Centaur Sea Serpents from Gandhara posted above from The Asian Art Museum of San Francisco.\n\nSee the link to the Hippocampoi below. These fish tallied sea horses from Greek Mythology were the vehicles of the Nereids and the sea horses that pulled Poseidon’s chariot known to found in the far reaches of the Indian Ocean. Once again through Greek mythology we have the artistic merging the East with the West, and through the Buckingham fountain which I interpret as Poseidon’s four unruly Hippocampoi, with the beautiful nereid in its midst emerging from Lake Michigan, I have extended Greek mythology bringing the story to the New World. A world like the Indo-Greek world, which is neither the East nor the West, but a meeting point where Kamal and the colonels son come together.\n\nHIPPOCAMPS (Hippokampoi) – Fish-Tailed Horses of Greek Mythology\n\nhttps://www.theoi.com/Ther/Hippokampoi.html\n\nJudith Soobee, my dear friend Stacy’s mum, despite never having met me, was as excited about my baby-to-be as any member of my family from back home. She remotely followed me through my pregnancy and organized my baby shower in Singapore, handcrafting the invites and the decorations all the way from Minneapolis. Even though she has left the mortal realm, through her love stretching across the oceans, the beautiful nereid that inhabited the shores of Lake Michigan has emblazoned her memory in all our hearts. Her daughter, my friend Stacy Ramdas, shared this below pasted image of her mum, which I adorned with my art.\n\nSee below another Indo-Greek sculpture from Gandhara, A Nereid Riding an Aquatic Dragon from the San Diego Museum of Art https://collection.sdmart.org/objects-1/info/19629:\n\nDhruvum as as the Greek hero Perseus below:\n\nAnd veering the tale back to Tara, see below Tara Household Gods– A Tale of Acadie, Tara as Evangeline:\n\nThe Gandhara Head– Tara’s Household Gods – Gandhara head with bronze Jain deity and stone Buddha head.\n\nTara’s Household Gods (see below from Geneva, Switzerland)- Balgopal (baby Krishna), Krishna playing the flute and Sacred slippers of The Guru.\n\nSt Francis Sculpture from Kerala, India – Tara’s Household Gods\n\nTara’s Household Gods: Varaha or Vishnu avatar in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nArcadia – Tara’s Home (Photo by The Singapore Tattler Magazine)\n\nVery briefly as I have a library to fill on this material…Gandhara is an area that covers parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan and is known for the Greco-buddhist, Bactro-Zorastrian influences that moulded its art and subsequently went on to influence the art and culture of Central Asia, China all the way across the Silk Road to Korea and Japan. After Alexander’s conquest of this region in 4th century BC, Greek art and culture combined with the prevalent culture and religion of the region, which was predominantly Buddhist with strong Zoroastrian influences. In fact, the Indo Greeks passionately embraced Buddhism, (as famously showcased through the Milinda-Panha, a philosophical dialogue between the Indo-Greek king Menander with the buddhist monk Nagasena) and the resulting merger of these two ideas resulted in the most magnificent art the region has known: Gandharan art and sculpture. In fact the numismatic art work is said to have far exceeded in fitness even its contemporary Greek origins (much more to say about Indo-Greek numismatics). See below an example of fine Indo-Greek coinage from The National Museum of Delhi, India:\n\nThe Gandharas were images of the buddha modeled after Apollo, in finely draped robes, and curly hair which highlight its greek origins. There are numerous images of the Buddha with Hercules and numerous other Greek deities standing guard over the buddha. These images patronized by the IndoGreek kings in the first and second century BC became further fine-tuned and widespread by the Indo-Scynthians, Kushans and thus travelled with silks, spices and Buddhism along the Silk Road to China and beyond and helped mould the image of the buddha in the lands it touched along the Silk Road. And we, in another time, along with our household gods, the Gandharas traveled alongside these caravans through Central Asia.\n\nDo see some fab images of Gandharas from my travels across the globe pasted below:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Buddhist_art\n\nThe Terracotta Gandhara from the Asian Civilization Museum in Singapore https://www.dropbox.com/s/vdml29r1tsio1bz/Teracotta%20Gandhara-ACM%20Singapore.mov?dl=0\n\nAnd Finally, Tara did go for that exchange program to France, a place she seemed to embrace like home. And as I came to bid her goodbye at her school I found her completely engrossed in conversation with her new friends, I wasn’t quite sure if it was a wave good bye from a distance or a wave off (like please don’t dare come here and try to practice your faltering French with my new found friends). It seemed as though this California grape ripened under the warm California sun was being squeezed into a French bottle and happily so. Soon we might have her back at our table with a French label affixed to her lapel!\n\nHowever, despite her having turned coat overnight, I was more perturbed by her quizzing me over our last supper as to why she should ever consider returning to California. I found upon taking my umpteenth photo in an attempt to collect all the memories I could gather of my little girl, she stopped smiling, appeared visibly upset at my continuous clicking, and stuck two French fries into the corners of her mouth like a fuming wild boar. I was immediately put at ease, for I realized that even if you put this grape in a French bottle, affix a French label, she will return home, for she will always remain a bold California wine lol! See below Teenage Tara – A Robust California Vintage:\n\nTara in France- Mom Put Down That Phone-I Am Not Amused!\n\nTara in France-A Bold California Vintage!\n\nIt’s good old California root stock that make the French eyes sparkle : )\n\nHere Kamal says goodbye to the Colonels son and promises more adventures in the future.\n\nFace with Tears of Joy 😂\n\nWith lots of love,\n\nPurnima\n\nSat, May 30, 2015, 9:44 AM\n\nDear Purnima,\n\nI have read with dismay about the terrible heat wave that is plaguing India at present. Whereas the most hard-hit areas are in the southeastern part of the country, I’m sure you have been feeling its effects in Delhi. It must be terrible to suffer in such heat. I do hope you have a good, air-conditioned refuge from the heat.\n\nAre you making progress on your masterpiece? With a heat wave on the prowl, it’s probably a good time to hole up somewhere and write.\n\nWhile we are on the subject of the weather, it has been rather cool here this spring. We still haven’t set up our table outside for meals because it gets so chilly in the evening that it would be uncomfortable to eat outside, but I rather like it this way.\n\nHow are your children doing? Have you been able to spend some time with them?\n\nOur little family drama is still evolving, but for the most part, in a positive direction, and everyone remains good friends with open channels of communication.\n\nDo take care of yourself and stay cool.\n\nLove,\n\nRoger\n\nRoger Stevenson\n\nPurnima Viswanathan\n\nBlog Disclaimer 😛\n\nAll persons, places, events are fictitious; all imputed relationships purely aspirational.

I have been thinking about you the past couple of days and wanted to write, and your FB comment spurred me on.\n\nWe have been back in Chiang Mai for four days now. It’s so wonderful to be here again. The weather is nice and warm, but not terribly hot, and the people are so lovely and friendly and then there is the food, not to mention the wonderfully delicious massages. Last night we went to the weekly Sunday Night Street Market in the center of the city. It is such a delightful experience and there is a such a variety of creative things that they sell. The only drawback is the huge number of tourists that crowd the street. Sometimes it is almost impossible to move. We spent a couple of hours walking up and down the street and then we capped the evening off with dinner at one of our favorite restaurants. We had a lovely table right next to the pool.\n\nHow are you doing since your return from your latest California jaunt? It was so nice talking to you when we were in San Diego. I’m sorry it didn’t work out to talk further while you were in Northern California.\n\nWe have been saddened by the terrible and horrendous attacks in Paris. One of the restaurants hit, La Belle Equipe, is just around the corner from the apartment we rented in October when we were in Paris and we walked past it often. I’m afraid that this will change so many things in the world, just like 9/11 did, and I don’t know where or when it will all end. I deplore the vicious attacks on innocent civilians, especially since it is in the name of a religious cause. The only heartening thing, if you can call it such, is the solidarity that has been expressed not just among the French people but from all corners of the globe. However, I fear the long term social and political consequences. France will have presidential elections next year, and I fear that the far right, anti immigrant parties will reap a lot of votes because of this.\n\nThat was a wonderful picture of Tara that you posted on FB when she left for school. She has grown into such a fine young woman. You must be proud of her. Is she still at the same school in the north of India ?\n\nSpeaking of northern India, I am just finishing watching (only one more episode to watch) a marvelous British series called “Indian Summers”. It deals with India just before independence and the fact that the British administration of India moved their headquarters to northern India, at the foot of the Himalayas in order to escape the summer heat in Delhi. It is such a damning portrait of the arrogant British and their racial attitudes toward the Indian people and how manipulative they were in their public displays of how they handed out justice to the Indian people. There are, of course, several romantic involvements between Indians and Brits, and it all comes together so delightfully. It’s one of the best series about India that I have seen in a very long time. I’m just hoping there will be a second season.\n\nWe are flying to Bangkok on Saturday and on Monday we fly to Kuala Lumpur for two nights and then on to Singapore for two more before we fly back to LA.\n\nMore when we get back to Ojai.\n\nLove and hugs,\n\nRoger\n\nRoger Stevenson\n\n– – –\n\nPART I\n\nDear Roger,\n\nHow wonderful to get a lovely long email from you! It sure sounds like Thailand has carved out a special place in your heart, and it certainly did mine but I got to see a lot of it from under a 100 feet. Yes, the sea, sand and massages were incredible, but I used to leave Mirko sunbathing on the beach ( a strange western custom in my eyes), and head out to the deep ocean for scuba adventure. Yes, I married a New Yorker who didn’t drive and wasn’t keen to get more than his ankles wet. I now yearn to return to Thailand in this new found second life for the sea and for the food.\n\nWhat happened in France was beyond a tragedy, with so many innocents murdered, the world just doesn’t make any sense. I’m so glad you were far from the danger, and not at your summer rental. Annick must be very disturbed, do give her my regards. However, I believe the main the test for the French nation and French values that the whole world admires is now, to see that they in this very intense time of crisis uphold Liberty, Egalite and Fraternity. What do you sense from the murmurs on the ground?\n\nOn home ground, I’m always looking for interesting movies and tv shows to fill my evenings. The British show Indian summers seems right up my alley. As you know, my family was very much a part of that story, The British Raj and all the stories around it are the lives lived by my grandparents and then my father as a child of the Raj. The summer capital you refer to is Simla, where my family spend many summers and in my memory it will always be a place superimposed with images of my family and of course an integral part of the story of Kadambari (for woven in the story of Kadambari is the story of my family, the story of the Raj). Roger, for me to get images of Kadambari, I will have to visit the British , French and US archives, and you will have to help. Yes, even the US archives, for This is an American Story!\n\nWe last spoke on your birthday, October 7th, when I was visiting Anaheim, and I have been remiss in not responding to your earlier email, but I was gripped by the most intense jet lag/exhaustion after my travels and have just about managed to recover. It was really unfortunate that we were unable to meet, but I’m sure you had a lovely birthday weekend treat to San Diego with Annick.Well Roger, since Annick took you on a birthday trip, I would also like to do the same. However, my planned journey is a rather more exotic one, as I hope to take you for a tour of the Silk Road and Central Asia (perhaps one day for real as well). So seat belts on, let’s see how steady you are on a camel.\n\nBut first, before we embark upon our exotic travels, I would like to share with you a piece of news that has tickled me and had me engrossed over the last couple of days and I’ve been raring to share, The Oxford English Dictionaries word of the year for 2015: “Face with tears of joy”,😂 an emoji!\n\nSee the OED blog below:\n\nhttp://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2015/11/word-of-the-year-2015-emoji/\n\nThis has caused a furore over the internet, and I’ve been having fun following the expletives. People just can’t seem to be able to wrap their minds around this, its been declared an outrage, a betrayal among many other colorful terms. It is that all too familiar yellow round face with tears pouring from the side of its eyes, to convey an image of unrestrained laughter or LOL, laughing out loud. Apparently, not only are emoji’s which have only recently entered out universe (1990) fast taking over as the most popular means of communication, this particular emoji “face with tears of joy”, is the most popular of the lot. Once again, the emoji is an image, pictograph as opposed to the emoticon which is an arrangement of punctuation like a smiley face 🙂 The overriding question was on the various online forums was “How is this even a word?” It’s an image, a picture, a symbol …\n\nWell according to the oxford dictionary, a word is defined as below:\n\nhttp://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/word\n\nDefinition of word in English:\n\nnoun\n\n1A single distinct meaningful element of speech or writing, used with others (or sometimes alone) to form a sentence and typically shown with a space on either side when written or printed:\n\nI don’t like the word ‘unofficial’\n\nwhy so many words for so few ideas?\n\nThe Merriam-Webster dictionary defines “word” as:\n\nhttp://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/word\n\n: a sound or combination of sounds that has a meaning and is spoken or written\n\n: a brief remark or conversation : something that a person says\n\n: an order or command\n\nRoger, as you know the earliest written communications primarily comprised of pictographic representations. This logographic language quickly evolved to represent both images for the thing described and similar sounds for other objects, like the hieroglyphics. So pure pictorial symbolism for an object is truly rudimentary, and that was the charge being leveled against the OED word of the year, that it was a process of regression and not evolution.\n\nSee below:\n\nhttp://www.ancientscripts.com/chinese.html\n\nThe Chinese writing system is a unique phenomenon in the modern world of alphabet scripts. Instead of a few dozen letters, it has developed thousands of complex signs or “characters” that represent morphemes and words. Even related writing systems such as Japanese and Korean, while sharing many of the same characters, can fully function as purely phonetic scripts. And while it is not the only living logographic writing system in the modern world, it is the only one serving as the primary writing system for hundreds of millions of people.\n\nHowever, on the most vocal charge of all on how is this image/pictograph even a word, I found myself revisiting the China Institute in New York where I had spend a summer, and recalling all the images from the characters of the Chinese script that were very much a pictorial image of the object represented, like man, mountain and tree. I know haters will hate and objectors will object, but are all these objectors really saying that the Chinese character for man, mountain and tree is not a word? Are they really saying that the only words that exist, exist in the English language and the rest of the world could just lump it? Are they saying that Mandarin, Korean and Japanese are not really languages, even though they are spoken by millions of people? What then constitutes language?\n\nSee below Logographic scripts and Chinese characters for Man, Mountain and Tree:\n\nhttp://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Logogram\n\nA logogram, or logograph, is a written or pictorial symbol that is used to represent an entire word, unlike phonograms, which represent phonetic sounds.\n\nAs a purely logographic script would be impractical for most languages, writing systems that incorporate logograms also make use of phonetic elements. Thus, such writing systems make use of a combination of phonetic and logographic symbols, including ideograms.\n\nFor example, symbols for currency like “$,” “€,” and “£” are universally recognized to mean “dollar,” “euro,” and “pound” respectively…mathematical symbols like “+” (plus), “<” (less than), and “π” (pi). While the spoken representation of these symbols may change according to the language, the symbols themselves transcend language barriers.\n\nChinese characters are traditionally divided into six types, of which only a very small number are true logograms, representing a single word. Some of the oldest Chinese characters are stylized pictographs, like 人 for “man,” 木 for “tree,” or 山 for “mountain.” See below the Chinese characters for man, tree and mountain that actually look like the image of the word they represent.\n\nPerson/Man: 人\n\nhttps://www.chinese-word.com/data/0071.html\n\nTree: 木\n\nhttps://www.chinese-word.com/data/2330.html\n\nMountain: 山\n\nhttps://www.chinese-word.com/data/1209.html\n\nSee below a fabulous installation at The Asian Art Museum in San Francisco titled Collected Letters by Qui Jianhua where a cascade of ceramic letters in Roman script and Chinese radicals that form Chinese characters appear to tumble down from the ceiling and dangle in midair suspended on an invisible string aptly dovetailing with my letter as they represent art, pictographs and the evolution of language, see exhibit below:https://www.dropbox.com/s/gsfn1ud5670x5v8/AAM%20Installation-%20Chinese%20and%20Roman%20Letters%3ACharacters.mov?dl=0\n\nWhat is interesting to note is that while the Oxford Dictionary deals with current usage, the Oxford English Dictionary is a historical dictionary and it traces the development of words in the English language. Do see video pasted below:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivV8x2K_DSU\n\nAnd as a historical dictionary it is doing just the right job of following the natural progression of the English language not just in print and spoken form but in the most relevant of all forms and forums today: The World Wide Web!\n\nNow Roger, I ask what if language is not as it was, traditionally limited to one group, community, society or culture but is required to be widely disseminated, accessed and understood by the global community, what then should be the role and goal of this language? This is the world of today and this is the world of the internet. By incorporating the emoji as the word of the year, the OED is declaring that the English language has morphed and transcended into another dimension, the dimension most relevant today, the virtual world, the web. I say bravo and three cheers for the pundits behind this move, English is and will continue to be the lingua franca of the new realm, the new world for it does what language must primarily strive to do, help facilitate communication. Ironically, the word lingua franca come from the all pervasive/ prevalent language of the enlightened world- French, but and unfortunately, the French seem to be fighting on different battlefields. If I provoke, I do to get a response, would love to hear you Roger as we have discussed the evolution of language in the past, what are your views on this now? Tragically, my French is almost non-existent due to lack of usage.\n\nThe Eggplant Emoji 🍆\n\nI would like to wrap up this discussion with something that made me roll on the floor with “face with tears of joy”. I couldn’t stop laughing out loud and absolutely had to share, it is also connected to a subject close to my heart:censorship. Well, during this journey through the internet chasing the emoji face with tears of joy, I came across an article that said that Instagram had banned/ censored the usage of an emoji of an eggplant. Yes, the image of an aubergine, eggplant, a vegetable has been censored. You are no longer permitted to send this innocuous looking eggplant image on instagram as it is meant to represent a “penis”. Yes, the character of an eggplant in the modern world has the same sound as penis! This has resulted on another furore on the internet and liberal souls like myself are demanding that we FreeTheEggplant. Do see link below:\n\nhttp://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/24561/1/freetheeggplant-instagram-bans-emoji-from-search-function\n\nI find the world has come to a most ridiculous end when vegetables are being not only viewed as phallic symbols (even if the boys on tinder are liberally using the image of the eggplant must we all be denied?). Now, everytime I say, “I love eggplants, I would like to have an eggplant for dinner, I dream of having an eggplant meal”, I have to hold myself back to re evaluate my audience and its response. I have to ensure I am conforming to contemporary community standards before I ever read out a recipe from my vegetarian cookbook. As I read out the baby books I must censor strictly: A is for Apple, B is for Ball, C is for … (carrot? I’m not sure if even that is permissible as the dimensions don’t conform, for the Length is greater than the width. I am certain its on the not permitted list), D is for Dog and E is …NOT FOR EGGPLANT…help!!! I envision a censorship squad in our supermarkets blotting out the names of horse radishes, cucumbers, carrots and eggplants. Those of us who inquire as to its location are whipped on the hands by the grocery store staff. There is a censor squad sent to all kindergartens to ensure the books are correctly labelled and the inappropriate images of eggplants and other objectionable phallic vegetables excised with immediate effect. Roger, welcome to the universe of today, and tomorrow…you thought The Brave New World was bad wait for this edition! Do check out the vegetable song for kindergarteners that I played to my children but will probably not be able to play to my grandchildren, must watch I promise you will laugh with tears of joy:\n\nThe Vegetable Song: https://youtu.be/0bxZylSiJ78\n\nI have to sign off now Roger as I’m off for a funeral and I promise to leave all my eggplant images back home as I leave for this sombre occasion. But wait for me, Part II which is a continuation of the above is coming up and I promise you an incredible journey.\n\nOk, so I last left you with an eggplant in your hand. But this is serious stuff regarding censorship, what are these contemporary community standards and who gets to determine what appeals to the prurient interest. Does something banned on the internet/ instagram like the eggplant emoji get translated into eggplants being censored in the real world as discussed above and more relevantly for us today, things that we censor or ban in the real world, can that be directly translated into the internet and can we automatically ban the same. This question has been raised in numerous cases in the US courts where the site being banned questioned the community standards, and whether what is considered pornography in the real world may not translate directly into the virtual world as there are different standards. Well, hello, I’m very interested to know what these standards are and how are they different or the same. Is anyone out there? Can anyone hear me? Chinese, French, English, Emoji…anything??\n\nNow Roger, even though I have given the OED my thumbs up, three cheers and bravo (and this may be because I’m innately inclined towards the Oxford Dictionaries as I was given my first copy by a Don of Oxford from the 1920’s and 30’s, do see my copy attached, and I’m very aware as I turn the pages that my fingerprints overlap his), as language stretches there are very grave issues that arise relating to the law to consider.\n\nMy grandfather Viswanathan’s OED below: Viswanathan’s Oxford English Dictionary\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/plyvwo1pnjvyf24/Viswanathan%27s%20Concise%20Oxford%20Dictionary.tiff?dl=0\n\nNow I’m going to hold your hand as we become web ants and walk through the California Evidence Code. I do this in order to better understand our corpus of laws in this ever changing linguistic landscape, we have to ask some pivotal questions. The one that comes to the top of my mind in this context is “What is a writing?“\n\nLet’s say hypothetically, a legal document is under review, the question is whether it can be admitted into evidence. Let’s say its a will. What if that will was drafted by a goof ball (comme moi), who after adhering to all the legal requirements, signs off with the emoji “face with tears of joy”, relieved that the final task is done.\n\nThe question is…Have I invalidated the document by signing off with an emoji ?\n\nMy take: After all the emoji, face with tears of joy was the OED’s word of the year! It’s a word, if the oxford dictionaries said so, it has to be a word!!\n\nThe question is: Is this a writing admissible as evidence (as defined under the evidence code)?\n\nSee below the relevant sections of the California Evidence Code:\n\nhttp://www.leginfo.ca.gov\n\n140. “Evidence” means testimony, writings, material objects, or\n\nother things presented to the senses that are offered to prove the\n\nexistence or nonexistence of a fact.\n\n250. “Writing” means handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, photocopying, transmitting by electronic mail or facsimile, and every other means of recording upon any tangible thing, any form of communication or representation, including letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combinations thereof, and any record thereby created, regardless of the manner in which the record has been stored.\n\nSection 250 above “Writing” covers pictures and symbols as well. An emoji is certainly a picture, and possibly a symbol as well, it can certainly be understood as a combination of word, picture, symbol, so under the evidence code. I read the emoji “face with tears of joy” as a writing.\n\nNow that we have answered the first question whether it is a writing, we have to ask if this is the writing we are talking about, ie, authentication. Let’s say the Will can be produced and authenticated. However, upon further inquiry relating to the content of the writing, I suspect we slip down a slippery slope.\n\nThe question is whether by the insertion of this emoji, “face with tears of joy” which also has as an alternate meaning LOL or “laughing out loud”, we are inserting ambiguity and invalidating the document. Even if the dictionary definition of the emoji is “face with tears of joy”, by the insertion of the emoji in the will could I be saying “This is not a Will” haha, laughing out loud. Or could I be creating a document that states, “She is a surgeon, Not” by inserting the emoji at the end of my letter of verification that confirms “She is a surgeon”. Though verbally stating sentences that end with Not, may now have become common parlance borrowed from slang, if the emoji serves to ridicule or disdain as many have claimed the emoji face with tears of joy does, it would destroy legal documentation forever!\n\nSo as we cheer, we have do so with caution, as it will impact much more than our language, it will impact our laws and the universe as we know it.\n\nThe Squirt Gun Emoji 🔫 (An excerpt from Purnima’s Emoji Paper to The CLA – a must read lol)- See a marked up screenshot of Jailbreak from The Emoji movie below also posted by me on Snap:\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/nrbojkaco08pab1/SNAP_20190520-111239.mp4?dl=0\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/93aguh0160eyuxp/Money%20Museum.mp4?dl=0\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/049maox98mijory/Gun%20Emoji.mp4?dl=0\n\nDo Check out Eric Goldman’s paper on Emojis and The law: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2961060\n\nGoldman points out how this depiction diversity can lead to misunderstandings and confusion. Unicode takes a somewhat lackadaisical approach to cross-platform compatibility\n\nit could attempt to sanction platforms that implement emojis so differently than the official Unicode outline that the meaning is changed, such as the Apple squirt gun implementation of a pistol firearm. Apple can offer its users a water gun emoji; but it can’t do so using the numerical code that Unicode assigns for the pistol emoji. Of course, Apple can choose not to implement the Unicode pistol emoji, though that will lead to recipients seeing the empty-square omission notice on incoming messages from other platforms (or the incoming emoji being omitted entirely).\n\nPurnima reflections: The other way to get around the Unicode Indexing system is by developing consensus across platforms as to the depiction of an image, then regardless of what a gun looks like in the real world in the world of emojis we would recognize its representation as a squirt gun. It now appears that not only has Apple kept a squirt gun emoji in the place of a pistol (weapon) but this has worked to persuade the other large platforms to do the same. Now Google, MS, Samsung, FB, Whattsapp, Twitter have squirt gun emojis in place of the gun symbol. However, this stream of reasoning doesn’t do much to resolve the underlying issue due to which the realistic gun image was converted to represent a toy- a squirt gun. The squirt gun as we have seen above when used in conjunction with other realistic emoji weapon depictions is just as threatening and incur the same civil and criminal liabilities when used with the intent to threaten.\n\nIn order to truly achieve the aim of denoting a gun (weapon) as a squirt gun, in addition to persuading all major platforms to adopt the squirt gun, it is imperative to eliminate all signs of the squirt gun from the real world – yes its time we wrestle away that squirt gun from our seven year olds hands and create a bonfire toy squirt guns. It is only in that instance that the image of a squirt gun (squirt gun emoji) could truly and absolutely represent the gun and claim the Unicode numerical code for the gun. The noble idea of eliminating the gun and all the mischief associated with it still remains a distant dream which this inversion doesn’t really solve.\n\nIn fact this inversion, representation of a gun by a squirt gun brings us back to the original question, how far are we willing to modify the real world to reflect our lives in the digital realm and in whom do we entrust this power. If an image is inverted in the digital realm, in order to maintain compatibility and coherence do we also accept corresponding inversions to our real world?\n\nLove\n\nPurnima\n\nPS: Do Check out Jailbreak from The Emoji Movie below:https://emojimovie.fandom.com/wiki/Jailbreak\n\nPURNIMA VISWANATHAN\n\nBlog Disclaimer 😛\n\nAll persons, places, events are fictitious; all imputed relationships purely aspirational.

I couldn’t be closer, so if I miss you on this trip to California, it will be a real pity. Are you back, when are you back? I really hope to see you and catch up over lunch, dinner or even a coffee! I fly out from LAX to SFO at 1:30pm Oct 11th.\n\nAs my writing to you is often a journey into my “dear diary” I’m going to leave you with this haunting melody which encapsulates my childhood and all the wonderful memories within. As I journeyed through the last rocky decade, my magical childhood somehow seemed to appear an illusion, something I had conceived, and life had contaminated. I struggled to revisit the fragments of my past, those blissful memories of my childhood, my parents and our very regular and very happy family. But whenever I caught a piece, it seemed to evaporate, or rather disintegrate due to the last few traumatic years. I found that I was unable to hold or retain a single pure uncontaminated memory, and that truly broke me.\n\nSee below a surrealist art work titled Magnetic Mountain by Kurt Seligmann at The Art Institute, Chicago evoking the shards of memories of a house atop a mountain, my childhood home, with the mighty Brahmaputra flowing by:\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/92bzd2nb93jidg0/AAB4qymRTK6jNfL9X2W8Annva?dl=0\n\nAnd then…as magic happens..when one falls to the bottom with no where to go… in the dark depths I heard… music…pure, clear, unadulterated sound bringing back a rush of beautiful pure unadulterated memories. It was in this musical piece (Fur Elise by Beethoven) that my entire childhood in all its giddy laughter, happiness and bliss was retained in its essence.\n\nSee below a video of music box playing Beethoven’s Fur Elise:\n\nAs my mother adorned, anointed and wrapped herself in her saree, I often played with her jewels dancing around her dressing room. There, in the depths of that special cupboard used to lie a silver music box with two dancing figures, it was magic to open it for out streamed Beethoven’s Fur Elise as the two exquisite dolls, one male and one female, twirled around each other as elegant dancers at a great ball. It’s for you Purnima, my mother used to say, and now I know “Fur Elise” was really “For Purnima”, for in the music was retained an entire idyllic childhood, untampered, and uncontaminated. For music is memory. See attached a picture of Mom and me.\n\nDo see below Fur Elise by Ludwig Van Beethoven:\n\nSee pasted below Mom and Me:\n\nAnd Roger, since I have two full hours before my flight I’m going to share a blurb I had written just the other day about …The Alphabet, Googol, EIC, Art, Love, Logic and Ode to Joy…all inspired after reading an article posted by a friend on The East India Company (EIC) by William Dalrymple. See The Guardian article below:\n\nThe East India Company: The Original Corporate Raiders\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/04/east-india-company-original-corporate-raiders\n\nSo Roger Here goes my take on the modern day equivalent of The East India Company and its implications, can’t wait to hear what you think.\n\nLet me take you for a ride on The Magic School Bus and let your imagination fly free: Imagine all the possible permutations and combinations of all the letters of the alphabet, artworks or the musical notes containing within it all the art, history, literature, philosophy and creative expression of mankind. What if someone claimed The Alphabet, Would we be relinquishing all the past present and future of humanity’s expressions to that entity?\n\nSee below Jasper Johns Alphabet from The Art Institute, Chicago\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/ow5zhnmnmdlu9sb/AADXM1CHwbYHFQ8dGwCkqQuLa?dl=0\n\nJasper Johns–Alphabet\n\nhttps://www.artic.edu/artworks/229353/alphabet\n\nhttps://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/342067\n\nJasper Johns Numbers 0-9 At The Tate:https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/johns-0-through-9-t00454\n\nCould an “all expansive” corporate entity, in the sense that it has no defining (limiting) corporate goal (charter of world domination), indeed claim the Alphabet? It’s as ridiculous as a foreign company from a distant and diminutive island traveling across the seven seas aspiring to trade, control and eventually posses all of Hindustan, India, the much coveted dream and destination of a large part of humanity since ancient times. Well, the East India Company did exactly that, and finally had to be absorbed by the Crown, are we seeing another EIC in the form of the omnipresent, omnipotent Googol or (heh heh) should we portentously call it The Alphabet aspiring to conquer the realm of our dreams, physical and virtual destinations!?!\n\nWhat are the ramifications for humanity? Are we, humankind, due to progress in technology, (over which we seem to have limited control) coming closer to relinquishing our core humanity: human speech, expression and core freedoms that makes us man? Who safeguards these freedoms for mankind as a whole, is it a particular nation (unlikely as each will strive to claim fire for themselves), a group of nations ( as we have seen they will act primarily in their own interests, ie, the interests of the economically dominant nations over the others claiming higher moral authority just on the basis of economic prowess), or then The Unite Nations (God help us all)!\n\nIn my opinion, the fate of humanity has to be secured by its humans. No nation, state, organized group or forum, but the individuals who stand jeopardized as their humanity is being wrestled from under their noses under various pretexts. No one speaks for me for one, I speak for myself and that is the speech I wish to be heard and registered as I’m arm twisted in giving it all up. How can we make this happen? How can we express ourselves freely, unconfined by the nation state, religious, ethnic and educational or vocational or gender distinctions? I strive to ensure that my voice is crisp clear and unadulterated as I fight for my right to retain my humanity not having this wrestled out of me by persuasive and influential voices that purport to represent my interests.\n\nMore… Much more to follow…For in the world of tomorrow, the world from which I edit, the cauldron is brewing over with images of AI Art…a note for another time… for in this letter I hope to showcase The Art Institute (AI) Art\n\nSee images of Purnima at the Art Institute of Chicago below:\n\nPhilosophical dilemmas:\n\nIs Art/ creativity really bound by its medium (language, music, numbers) or is the medium merely an expression, one of numerous avenues or dimensions to express the idea. The idea being in a nebulous effervescent form in an undefined space until it is realized and expressed by man in any of the numerous avenues open to him to express the same. By enumerating every permutation and combination of letters, numbers and musical notes, and scanning the corpus of literary and artistic works can we conceivably say that we have listed/ defined every past present and future expression of Art or creativity of humankind?\n\nIn a universe where man is not only looking to simulate but create a virtual existence starting from digital copies of viruses to worms, can we similarly attempt merely by listing all the possible permutations of the Alphabet (etc) to state that we now have (have been able to simulate or express in a digitized form) all of mankind’s Art/Creativity?\n\nCan you really conceive of an algos to represent creative expression?\n\nI think…not!\n\nIn attempting to represent this human realm, man through his gargantuan omnipresent omnipotent corporate entities, will wrestle as much knowledge/data as he can in order to accurately simulate this world. The danger of course lies when man is unable to wrestle (for example) the Alphabet and all its permutation combinations back out of the hands of the corporation. When due to IP restrictions or other laws bestowing possession to the corporate entity excluding the rest of humanity we are not somehow deprived of all that we believe makes us human to list a few: our physical image, our movements and facial expressions, our texture, color and all physical attributes, our unique verbal and physical expressions, our distinctive mode of communication, all our financial relationship and professional history both in pictures and text including search data covering relationships, emotions, desires and passions all neatly contained in a data packet tucked into the pocket of the corporation. Can you conceive of a time where the corporate will claim pre eminence over our data, where we will have to line up and pay the corporate entity, commit to eternal enslavement, to reclaim ourselves our information our image and our data back from the corporate? And how and why we will ask did we get here…ALL because the nation state, whether individually or through the agglomeration of nations failed us, all because the organizations designed to protect were compromised! This is not an event in the misty realms of tomorrow, this is the reality of today.\n\nHowever … fortunately… I believe there is a land of rainbows and unicorns beyond this cloud of gloom as I believe that completely erasing or enslaving humanity will just not be possible AND this is despite ourselves…because I believe art is the expression of that elusive spirit that refuses to be confined by the devices of Man or the Algos(AI gods).\n\nAs these virtual realms get built with all our data packets, attempting to find a formulaic representation of creative expression is where the simulation of the universe will hit a roadblock so it will attempt the next best thing, it will list all potential permutations and combinations of the ( for example) Alphabet to represent all of humanity’s creativity past present and future, in the belief that creativity is somehow embedded in the forum or the channel of expression, and a catalogue of every potential expression through all known channels would encapsulate all of mankind’s creativity. And with this final flourish this future entity will declare it has replaced human experience and existence in a virtual form. Fortunately life and Art are not so simple to replicate, and humanity will eventually prevail with a new Ode to Joy that will blow everyone s brains off!\n\nDo check out the MIT Tech article below:\n\nTHE MIT TECH REVIEW – A PHILOSOPHER ARGUES THAT AI CANNOT BE AN ARTIST (4/15/20) https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/02/21/239489/a-philosopher-argues-that-an-ai-can-never-be-an-artist/\n\nThis above pasted MIT Tech article gives humanity a thread to hang on, for it shows how despite producing an algos for every musical notation and it’s combination, AI wouldn’t necessarily be able to produce pathbreaking creative work/music as (giving the example of Schoenberg below) novelty and creativity may lie outside the form and format of music which might mean redefining music and it’s notations, and similarly all of artistic expression. AI could only work from the subset provided and would not be in a position to redefine it (music or art).\n\nWe count Schoenberg as a creative innovator not just because he managed to create a new way of composing music but because people could see in it a vision of what the world should be. Schoenberg’s vision involved the spare, clean, efficient minimalism of modernity. His innovation was not just to find a new algorithm for composing music; it was to find a way of thinking about what music is that allows it to speak to what is needed now.\n\nAnd I wrap up this missive with these final words:\n\nThe universe is a balance between Love and Logic, disorder and order, with Art as its expression. We may be able to duplicate artistic expression with permutation of historical creative expression but in my belief never replicate it. For in order to meet the next Picasso, the one that turns the world upside down, challenges norms and changes human perception, we will have to live in the realm of man and not in the realm of AI gods, for Picasso can only exist in the “real” human world.\n\nSee below images from The Art Institute of Chicago that showed us new ways to dream…\n\nImages:https://www.dropbox.com/sh/uijm6jphird2gm5/AABjPN_uhqOyS5fShg-B11J1a?dl=0\n\nAs I explore the above pasted collection from the Art Institute Chicago, I realize how my life experience is enriched and taken to another threshold, an experience that a literal translation of the title into an art form would not produce: Viewing Picasso’s Man With A Pipe, we can barely count the varied textures, dimensions and sensations we are exposed to as we journey into the man’s half shut eyes and inhale; In the Nude under a Pine Tree, Picasso once again deconstructs and reconstructs our perception of the human form, using perspective to telescope us on to another realm; Fernand Leger’s Still Life feels eerily un-still, the painting as I see it are the accoutrements of a man of those times (1928) a top hat, a cane and a pipe all of which appear in a hurry; Rene Magritte’s The Banquet leads me to a familiar place, dinner at sundown on the patio, but with the seemingly familiar is surrealistically unfamiliar as the incandescent setting sun presents itself like a glowing orb in front of the trees instead of silently setting in the horizon behind them; Personages With Star-Joan Miro…c’est quoi…what? Oh now I see it…the glamor, the glitter, the hallucination, fabuleux! And finally, Angel Planells – Midday Sorrow, this masterful work of languid oozing grief and procrastinated sorrow in multiple dimensions says it all, for it talks to the soul.\n\nI now wrap this up with a bunch of videos from my trip to The Art Institute of Chicago where I query the magnificent lions that guard the facade, Sher Khan and Simba, “Do you know where the Jabberwocky is?” 😂 A Must Watch!\n\nVideo 1:https://www.dropbox.com/s/8iebwztp0wrptpx/1%20Sher%20Khan%201.MOV?dl=0\n\nVideo 2:\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/50sl0skawe09xd5/2%20Sher%20Khan%20do%20you%20know%20where%20the%20jabberwocky%20is%3F.mov?dl=0\n\nVideo 3: https://www.dropbox.com/s/la4uv4h0hioz268/3%20Sher%20Khan%20Points%20To%20Simba.MOV?dl=0\n\nVideo 4: https://www.dropbox.com/s/9ifi5k1z3e5vbn3/4%20Hello%20Simba.MOV?dl=0\n\nVideo 5: https://www.dropbox.com/s/8zhsdfhzbg18hgm/5%20Simba%20do%20you%20know%20where%20the%20jabberwocky%20is%3F.MOV?dl=0\n\nLots of love to everyone, can’t wait to see you all and hear about your recent adventures in Paris!\n\nPurnima\n\nPurnima Viswanathan\n\nDisclaimer 😛\n\nAll persons, places, events are fictitious; all imputed relationships purely aspirational.

Where have you been, why not a whisper? Am I not even entitled to even a basic comment like “hmmrph” or “boring” on my last three (what I consider epic) outpourings? Well, here goes yet another with the hope of retrieving you from some distant recesses of the www where you may have been temporarily detained.\n\nMy summer break with the kids turned out to be more fun than I had expected. We flew to Vienna where we spent a couple of days just walking the streets soaking in that magnificent city, we also managed a bus and tram tour of the Ringstrasse constructed in 1860 by emperor Franz Joseph with its many iconic buildings like the State Opera, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Parliament, Imperial palace and University and of course Cafe Landtmann where we spent a leisurely afternoon imagining conversations with its famous patrons like Freud and Mahler, Marlene Dietrich and Burt Lancaster. The art, architecture, food and culture was truly an overload for the senses. What I enjoyed most was the buzz in the city, it seemed young and bustling, teeming with life. I was certainly glad I had read Fin-de-Siecle Vienna by Schorske before landing as I was brimming with information for the kids, excited about my anticipated role as tour guide. Unfortunately, my kids had heard enough of my voice and would run the moment I appeared to open my mouth. So I resigned myself to either talking to myself all alone or spending time with the kids walking the city but in silence, of course I chose the latter.\n\nThere is much to say about Vienna and I’m not sure I can do so in one breath, but we did cover the highlights like the Hofburg Palace and Royal quarters, Treasury, and the Sisi museum, a collection built around the fascinating empress of the Austro-Hungarian empire Elizabeth, wife of Franz Joseph (whom I had mentioned in my last mail). This enigmatic personality continued to have its intense draw as her desire for freedom above all eerily resonated with my soul. The kids loved the Prater, the Vienna amusement park, where we returned more than once. We enjoyed the Natural History Museum with its spectacular collection of minerals and fossils, and the next day found our way to the famous Kunsthistorisches museum.\n\nSee below Purnima at the Vienna Library:\n\nDhruvum points the way- Hofburg Palace Vienna:\n\nVienna Horses with Crotched Red Earmuffs:\n\nKids at the Kunsthistorisches museum:\n\nThe Egyptian galleries at the Kunstmuseum blew us away! Apart from the collection of artifacts housed in the museum, the actual halls…in fact the entire wing was a work of art. Egyptian motifs collected from Egyptian tombs in the 18th and 19th centuries were painstakingly and beautifully painted on to the walls to provide a sense of being in the tombs of Egypt and viewing the artifacts within, Do see attached a photo of the Egyptian Gallery at the Kunstmuseum.\n\nApart from my desire to take a giant size bite of this delectable city, and savour its contents, I sensed I was being sampled by Vienna in turn. Do see attached pic of me lying on a giant tongue and being sampled by Vienna in turn.\n\nPurnima Lying on a Giant Tongue:\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/vdpvkno0allxvta/PURNIMA%20ON%20THE%20GIANT%20TONGUE%20BEING%20SAMPLED%20BY%20VIENNA.tiff?dl=0\n\nThe highlight of this trip to Vienna was the Secession building, with which I will wrap up this mail, an absolute must see!\n\nWe then took the train to Salzburg, where we enjoyed spectacularly good food. The weiner schnitzel (a traditional pork cutlet, beaten thin and then breaded), the rib eye steak and the gargantuan traditional egg dessert called the Salzburger Nockerl were outstanding(see pic below):\n\nThe highlight of Salzburg for me was The Sound of Music Tour with a chance to visit the real life sites of my childhood memory(movie). See below a scene from my fav movie replayed – my kids aged 16 and 17 standing beside the original Gazebo featured in the song with the same title from the movie Sound of Music:\n\nSee below the Sound of Music palace- Schloss Leopoldskron:https://www.schloss-leopoldskron.com/en/our-history/the-sound-of-music\n\nMy kids aged 16 and 17 standing beside the original Gazebo in The Sound of Music movie:\n\nHere we spent a lovely afternoon in Salzburg with the kids Austrian cousins all dressed up in their traditional gear of lederhosen who were all warm, welcoming and extremely generous- see link of an example below (http://www.gosauapartment.com/uploads/8/0/7/4/8074434/5183426_orig.jpg)\n\nWe walked the streets enjoying the sculptures and architecture of the buildings and palaces, peered at Mozarts home from below, posed outside a sign that said “Schmuckpassage” and “Badgasse” adding much to the kids sense of entertainment who were exhausted by endless palaces and museums, we finally made our way up to the Hohensalzburg fortress which offered gorgeous views of Salzburg.https://www.salzburg-burgen.at/en/hohensalzburg-castle/\n\nWe ended the night at the famous beer halls of Salzburg. Here kids aged 16 are permitted beer, it’s all a part of the culture, so I told the kids that we must do in Rome as the Romans do and they could sip a “radler” which is a kind of shandy, made of beer and lemonade. But first, we had to collect our beer mugs wash it in the spring water fountain and then take it to be filled, all in all quite an experience! The kids loved Salzburg so much that they would have been happy to have been left there until graduation (two years hence). Will try and forward the above-mentioned pics in my next email. See below The Beer Halls of Salzburg:https://youtu.be/vThk9DlPEQo\n\nSee Kids in Smuckspassage below:\n\nSee Purnima in Bad(g)asse below:\n\nSee Purnima in Salzburg (Fortress)\n\nWe reluctantly left Salzburg behind, and caught the train to Innsbruck where we spent two nights. See below Purnima in Innsbruck:\n\nThis Alpine ski destination surrounded by magnificent snow capped peaks, clear blue skies, crisp clean air was truly breathtaking and an ideal stopover before the long train ride to our destination, Geneva. See images of Innsbruck below:\n\nWe did walk the streets and try all the local cuisine, but the highlight of Innsbruck for us all was the Alpenzoo (http://www.alpenzoo.at/en/), a zoo housing animals native to the Alps.\n\nGetting to the zoo was a trek, and walking around was another hike, but it was well worth it! Do see the photo of the kids with the Chamois, the gentle looking mountain goat, which you might remember from Chamonix, at least I did as I have spotted them during my numerous ski trips and cable car rides up the mountain. We saw the Lynx, the Moose, and of course the Alpine Ibex. See images from The Alpenzoo below:\n\nIn my prior emails to you, you must have sensed my excitement over the Ibex, and it remains an animal close to my heart (Did I ever read you The Story of the Ice Mommy?). My father had a similar fascination for this elusive and magnificent beast, and here we were face to face. The Alpine Ibex was extinct across most of Europe and Switzerland in the 19th century, and had resurged in northern Italy only after a careful plan of reintroduction and preservation, and is now in the “least concern” list. However, the same is not true of the Pyrenean ibex which is virtually extinct, the "
