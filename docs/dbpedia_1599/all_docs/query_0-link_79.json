        "text": "January 26, 2002 - March 16, 2002\n\nUbu Gallery presented Behind the Surrealist Curtain in association with private dealer Timothy Baum, and paralleling the exhibition Surrealism: Desire Unbound at The Metropolitan Museum of Art. This exhibition explored Surrealism’s erotic side. Influenced by the Freudian notion that sexual instinct was fundamental to the development of the psyche, the Surrealists saw erotic desire as important to self-awareness and the representation of desire as a vehicle to tap into or reflect the sub- and unconscious. No subject matter was too extreme to be excluded, censored or ignored by the Surrealists. In their investigation of dreams, the various states of consciousness, and the libido, they drew little distinction between private and public domains. In presenting works from the first historical art movement to address pointedly the subject of erotic desire (certain of the works are, in fact, sexually explicit), this exhibition raised issues that remain at the fore of consideration in contemporary art and culture.\n\nARTISTS\n\nVictor Brauner, Joseph Cornell, Oscar Dominguez, Marcel Duchamp, Max Ernst, David Hare, Georges Hugnet, Valentine Hugo, Marcel Jean, René Magritte, Marcel Mariën, André Masson, Roberto Matta, Pablo Picasso, Angel Planells, Man Ray, Kurt Seligmann, Jindřich Štyrský, Dorothea Tanning, Raoul Ubac, Laurence Vail\n\nRESOURCES\n\nExhibition checklist\n\nPress release\n\nAnnouncement edition ubu #23\n\nA catalogue produced in conjunction with the exhibition is available for purchase at the Ubu Gallery store.\n\nPRESS\n\nThe New York Times / Art in Review / March 1, 2002 / Grace Glueck\n\nFrance / Exhibits / Winter 2001 – 2002 / 1 reproduction\n\nThe Art Newspaper / The Wider Commercial Scene / January 2002 / S.E.

Ubu exhibits paintings, drawings, photography, sculpture, and ephemera (books, posters, graphic design, etc.) and, wherever possible, highlights the interrelationships among these art forms.\n\nUbu Gallery is a well-known presence on the international cultural scene and enjoys a worldwide reputation for its serious explorations of areas covered by few other galleries, including acclaimed survey exhibitions of Polish, Romanian and Czech avant-garde art. Ubu’s focus on the avant-garde, particularly on historically important artists and movements that have not received appropriate attention, has earned the gallery frequent reviews in press throughout the world focused on the visual arts. Ubu participates in the most important Parisian art fair, FIAC, held annually in the Grand Palais (2010-2016), and has participated significantly in Art Basel (2003–2011) and the encyclopedic Frieze Masters fair (2012–2015) showcasing the best of antiquities to modern art, in Regent's Park in London."
