        "text": "As we transition to the 2017-18 year, we say goodbye to our excellent 2016-17 student representatives (except Lauren Rice, who is staying on as public relations co-chair). Enjoy this Q&A interview, conducted by our new president, Angel Planells, MS, RDN, CD. Q: Prior to entering nutrition, tell us briefly about yourself Amanda van Duren: I […]\n\nMore\n\nI would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to current members, prospective members and all those following activities of the Greater Seattle Dietetic Association (GSDA). As GSDA president during the 2016-2017 calendar year, I had the pleasure of experiencing some of my favorite events to date, such as learning the art of soul food […]\n\nMore\n\nMornings can be chaotic and many people don’t have time to eat a healthy breakfast though it is one of the most important times of the day to fuel your body. There are plenty of good reasons to eat breakfast but there are also many barriers. Some people do not feel hungry in the morning, […]\n\nMore\n\nWe’re excited to announce the new GSDA board for 2017-2018. We have a great mix of returning board members and new, which we celebrated at our transition meeting yesterday. We have lots of ideas for continuing education and social events for the next year, and are eager to get to work. Stay tuned for updates […]\n\nMore\n\nGSDA is extremely proud to have not one, but two Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics spokespeople on it’s board: president Angel Planells and nominating committee co-chair Ginger Hultin. Angel works as lead dietitian in the home-based primary care program at the Veterans Administration in Puget Sound. He is also owner of a private practice and […]\n\nMore\n\nIf you’ve never had the opportunity to hear GSDA legislative co-chair Chris Vogliano, MS, RDN, speak on sustainable food systems and reducing food waste, you’ve missed out. Chris has spoken on these topics at several venues, including FNCE 2016 in Boston, the Washington State Academy conference in Yakima last April, as well as the Today’s […]\n\nMore\n\nCue the drum roll and break out the champagne (or kombucha, as you will), GSDA finally has a new website. While some things are forever, web design is not, and this is a much-needed overhaul (we’re sure you’ll agree). If you came to this blog post by direct link, you can check out our home/splash […]\n\nMore\n\nWe would love to hear from you! Contact a board member directly by going to the Board Members page and clicking on the name of the person you wish to contact.\n\nReach us by Email or Facebook."
