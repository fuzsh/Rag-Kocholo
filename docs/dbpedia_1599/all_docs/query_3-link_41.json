They're making a huge difference in their local communities, nationally, and even globally. Each year Today's Dietitian (TD) asks our readers to nominate colleagues and mentors they believe are going above and beyond their call of duty to make a positive impact in the dietetics field.\n\n​In honor of National Nutrition Month® and Registered Dietitian Nutritionist Day, TD has chosen 10 outstanding dietitians who deserve recognition for their exceptional work in the field. Some of them are entrepreneurs, authors, and leaders in clinical care, foodservice, community nutrition, and sustainability. They're motivating employees to do their best work each day, offering nutrition education and counseling services to clients and patients locally and abroad, and providing healthful meals to food insecure and underserved populations. We hope you're inspired by their stories as much we are and will continue to do the amazing work you do in the nutrition profession.\n\nVeterans Health Administration\n\nThis year, the following four NFS RDNs were recognized by VA Central Office Patient Care Services (PCS). These individuals will be honored at the PCS Awards Ceremony, scheduled for Feb 17 in Washington DC at VA Central Office:\n\nAngel Planells, MS, RDN, CD; Home Based Primary Care (HBPC) RDN at VA Puget Sound; Patient Care Services (PCS) Clinical Nutrition Practice\n\nMr. Planells was recently named a Hero in the Academy of Nutrition & Dietetics Food & Nutrition Publication for September –October 2015.
