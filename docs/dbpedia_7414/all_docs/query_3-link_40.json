        "text": "Band Name: Tommy Tutone\n\nWebsite: Tutone.com\n\nMembers: Tommy Heath, lead vocals, performing with the local rhythm section of Bobby Salamone, drums, and Victor Castaneda, bass and vocals. “They’ve played with me in many gigs from Detroit to Minneapolis,” Heath said.\n\nCity based in: Portland, Ore.\n\nFormed in: 1977\n\nName inspired by: “My personal nickname from my love of two-tone 54 Chevy’s,” Heath said.\n\nWe sound like: No one else sings like Tommy Tutone. He is inspired by Van Morrison, ‘60s soul, country, and ‘50s rockabilly.\n\nKnown for: The hit “867-5309/Jenny,” which peaked at No. 4 in 1982 going gold on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nCoolest story so far from a show: “My first big concert ever was in 1980 opening for Tom Petty at the Red Rocks amphitheater in Colorado,” Heath said."
