Have you ever confused a single artist with a band or vice versa?\n\nPost by Zach on\n\nI fully thought The Ready Set was a band to the extent that I even had a name in my head for another member (Daniel). Where I got that name from I'm still trying to figure out to this day.\n\nMy friend just learned that Bon Jovi (the band) is in fact constituted of multiple people a few weeks ago.\n\nPost by Leaf on\n\nThought was a band:\n\nFive for Fighting\n\nThought was a person:\n\nBon Jovi\n\nVan Halen\n\nMarilyn Manson (although he has also been solo)\n\nBon Iver\n\nPost by lyhom on\n\nI thought that salt ashes and marina & the diamonds were a band\n\nI thought that bob moses was a person\n\nPost by Harx on\n\nI have just recently found out that Carlos Santana was in a band called Santana.\n\nPost by Sambalada on\n\nI thought that salt ashes and marina & the diamonds were a band\n\nI thought that bob moses was a person\n\nit's not a group?! :X\n\nI've just figured it out now\n\nPost by Zach on\n\nI thought that bob moses was a person\n\nHold on just one second! Bob Moses is a duo?!\n\nPost by yuh yuh on\n\nAt first I though Cascada was only one singer (but is an Euro-Dance group, consisting of 3 persons)\n\nPost by Harx on\n\nI thought The Weeknd was a band\n\nSame here, but that's because there was a terrible band in my country of this name (except it was The Weekend, not The Weeknd), that's why I had this association in my mind when I first heard of him when \"Love Me Harder\" became a hit.\n\nPost by MTSChart21 on\n\nI thought that salt ashes and marina & the diamonds were a band\n\nI thought that bob moses was a person\n\nit's not a group?! :X\n\nI've just figured it out now\n\nWow, same. I seriously thought it was a group...\n\nPost by Ling-Ling on\n\nI thought La Roux was one person when they came out. Now they are, haha. So I don't feel so bad.\n\nI thought Goldfrapp was a solo act as well.\n\nAnd I also thought Marina & The Diamonds was a band.\n\nPost by YourFaveIsAFlop on\n\nit's not a group?! :X\n\nI've just figured it out now\n\nWow, same. I seriously thought it was a group...\n\nThe Diamonds are her fans, not her band.\n\nPost by Zach on\n\nWow, same. I seriously thought it was a group...\n\nThe Diamonds are her fans, not her band.\n\nMind blown.\n\nPost by Harx on\n\n-Gnarls Barkley\n\nOh yes\n\nWhen I found out it was CeeLo Green singing it blew my mind. I thought it was a person for almost a decade.\n\nPost by YourFaveIsAFlop on\n\nWhere would you guys put the Pussycat Dolls? Technically they're a band because all of the girls are members, but all of the vocals are Nicole's...so...\n\nPost by Az Paynter on\n\nNicole didn't do 100% of the PCD's vocals. I mean, Melody got a few adlibs here and there. :sip2:\n\nPost by Linnethia Monique on\n\nNicole didn't do 100% of the PCD's vocals. I mean, Melody got a few adlibs here and there. :sip2:\n\nMy girl had verses and bridges on the 2nd album\n\nPost by Relaxing Cup on\n\nNicole didn't do 100% of the PCD's vocals. I mean, Melody got a few adlibs here and there. :sip2:\n\nMy girl had verses and bridges on the 2nd album\n\nPost by trustypepper on\n\nLol I remember on Behind the Music when Nicole \"revealed\" that she was the only one doing vocals. She was so dramatic about it.\n\nPost by chicken077 on\n\nI didn't know Rae Sremmurd was a duo and not a person until like two days ago.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nI thought the Tony Rich Project (everyone's favorite thing: a OHW) was a group, but it was just one guy trying to pass himself off as a group because he thought people would take him more seriously than if they knew he was a soloist.\n\nConversely, I thought Florence + the Machine was the stage name for one woman.\n\nPost by Sherane Lamar on\n\nOwl City.\n\nI still don't buy the idea that Lukas Graham is a band. He might have some instrumentalists following him around, but the song is about when HE was 7 years old. And what HIS mama said to him. Not anybody else. So I'm not buying it. Is Drake a band just because he usually works with Noah Shebib? I don't think so. So I don't buy the idea that he is a band.\n\nSame with La Roux. \"English singer and songwriter La Roux has released two studio albums, one mix album, two extended plays, one mixtape, five singles, two promotional singles and seven music videos.\" lol."
