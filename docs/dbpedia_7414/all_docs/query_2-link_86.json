Made me wonder if, after all these years, there were fools still calling this number.\n\nIf Snopes is to be believed, there are!\n\n867-5309 / Jenny\n\nS0mebody got assigned that number almost a decade ago, and looked what happened:\n\nOur New Phone Number is Jenny's 867-5309 and it's Not Funny Anymore!\n\nHave to bet that some members here called that number when the song was a hit!\n\nI wonder if people call 777-5311? It was Dez Dickerson's actual phone number at the time but the onslaught of callers forced him to get it changed.\n\nTake it one step further. If you want to get the benefit of a retail rewards card but don't have one, input (area code)867-5309. Yes, it works!\n\nIs the woman's name Jenny?\n\n777-9311 is whats on the record, amazing drum machine programming on that. The b-side to the single \"Grace\" was pretty wild also.\n\nI saw Tommy Tutone once at a club in Detroit and some guy tossed a couple of coins onstage during the song and totally got the stinkeye from Tommy.\n\nBEechwood-4 would be 234 (B and E correspond to 2 and 3 on the telephone keypad)."
