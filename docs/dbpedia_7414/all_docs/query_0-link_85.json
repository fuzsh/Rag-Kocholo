        "text": "CEDAR PARK, TX (September 18, 2018) – Rick Springfield is back with the Best in Show 2018 at H-E-B Center at Cedar Park on Friday, November 2nd, with Loverboy, Greg Kihn and Tommy Tutone, welcomed by 103.5 BOB-FM. The \"Jessie's Girl\" and General Hospital icon will be rockin' all his classics, plus new music off his critically acclaimed release, The Snake King.\n\nRelive all the 80s hits as Loverboy belts out, Working for the Weekend,\" Greg Kihn sings \"Jeopardy,\" and Tommy Tutone gives us Jenny's number one more time, 867-5309!\n\n“The Best In Show” tag for the tour is a nod to my album, “Working Class Dog” and also represents what I feel is a big value package for fans of the era. Four full band performances per show from some of the biggest names in the music video era will give ticket buyers a real bang for their buck this summer,” says Springfield about the summer 2018 tour.\n\n“Working Class Dog” was the break-through album released in 1981 which contained the hits, “I’ve Done Everything For You”, “Love is Alright Tonight”, and the #1 smash “Jessie’s Girl.” Concert goers can expect to hear not only these and other Rick Springfield smashes, but all of the many hits from the supporting artists.\n\nSpringfield also just released his critically acclaimed 20th studio album, “The Snake King” and the music video from the new single, “Voodoo House” beautifully shot on location in the swamps of New Orleans.

The creator of some of the finest power-pop of the ’80s, a Grammy winning singer, songwriter, and musician who has sold 25 million albums and scored 17 U.S. Top 40 hits, including “Jessie’s Girl,” “Don’t Talk to Strangers,” “An Affair of the Heart,” “I've Done Everything for You,” “Love Somebody,” and “Human Touch.” He’s an accomplished actor who has starred opposite Meryl Streep in the feature film Ricki and the Flash, gave a chameleonic performance as the creepy Dr. Pitlor in HBO’s prestige drama True Detective, earned great reviews for his portrayal of Lucifer this season on the CW hit, Supernatural and most recently played Pastor Charles on American Horror Story. In 2014, Springfield was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, located around the corner from the first apartment he lived in when he first arrived in the U.S. from Australia in 1971.\n\nRick’s latest Album, “The Snake King” finds Rick travelling down a dusty dirt road to explore the blues side of his rock ‘n roll and marks a definite departure from the power pop he has been known for.\n\nLoverboy\n\nLoverboy are currently enjoying a cultural renaissance, with major companies such as Taco Bell and Radio Shack using the band’s image and music to promote their products to the ‘80s generation which grew up on the group and others who are just being introduced to their anthems. These days, Loverboy’s not just “Working for the Weekend” but “Lovin’ Every Minute of It,” too, performing for those fans who “Get Lucky” enough to catch one of their shows.\n\nGreg Kihn\n\nAs a pioneer with the legendary Beserkley Records, Greg Kihn helped write the book on revolutionary west coast rock and roll. He’s toured the world, had hit records, and has won several awards for his hit songs “Jeopardy”, “Break Up Song” and “Lucky.\"\n\nGreg recently obtained the rights to all his old recordings and has re-released his entire catalogue. In support of these releases and his NEW album “ReKihndled,\" the iconic San Francisco Bay area rocker, radio personality and author has been going out with the Greg Kihn Band across the country.\n\nTommy Tutone\n\nIn 1982, Tommy Tutone exploded onto the music scene with what is one of the best known songs in history. The song that sparked millions of prank calls is none other than \"Jenny/867-5309.\" Coming on the scene at the same time as MTV certainly didn’t hurt at all either, thus cementing him a place in the culture of the 80’s."
