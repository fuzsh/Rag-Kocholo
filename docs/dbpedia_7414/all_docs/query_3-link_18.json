        "text": "Tommy Heath says he never expected to get the kind of success that came when his band Tommy Tutone hit the jackpot in 1981 with “867-5309/Jenny,” a song made so ubiquitous by a combination of the then-new MTV and radio that just to mention its title is enough to trigger most any fan of ’80s rock into singing a few bars of its irresistible chorus.\n\n“It seemed like it had happened to another guy,” Heath says from Portland, Oregon where he’s lived off and on for most of the past two decades. “I’d hang out where ever I was living, get on a plane and go somewhere and be Tommy Tutone.”\n\nHeath, 70, has worked as a computer analyst and software engineer for years, but still heads out on the road for 30 or 40 shows a year, usually with his current version of Tommy Tutone. He’ll come to Orange County solo on Friday, Oct. 27, to sing “Jenny” and maybe another song or two as part of a group of vintage rockers who’ll play at the 4th annual Goodwill Gala, a charity benefit for Goodwill of Orange County.\n\nOthers on the bill for the event to be held at the Monarch Beach Resort in Dana Point include Martha Davis of the Motels, Wally Palmar of the Romantics, Rick Derringer of the McCoys, Skip Martin of Kool & the Gang, and Eric Troyer of Electric Light Orchestra Part II.\n\nTommy Tutone had achieved a measure of success with the single “Angel Say No,” which just cracked the Top 40 in 1980. But it was “Jenny,” which arrived just three-and-a-half months after the debut of MTV unleashed a huge demand for music videos, that became its legacy.\n\n“MTV was a big part of it,” Heath says. “I would be recognized on the street in Omaha, Nebraska. We were from San Francisco and didn’t get the time of day there. We’d get on a plane and fly to Texas and they’d literally have actual red carpets for me.”\n\nThe band got categorized as New Wave, a label Heath says he never really understood, and like lots of bands that breakout unexpectedly the pitfalls of overnight success were waiting.\n\n“We did the usual screw ups,” Heath says. “Instead of going and knocking one out (after the “Tommy Tutone 2” which produced “Jenny”) we went for a big concept album like we were Brian Wilson or something.\n\n“We were song-oriented people,” he says. “We weren’t great musicians but we were original. People seemed to look at us and say, ‘Gee, they’re kind of like us.’ As opposed to being kind of far out trendy rock guys.\n\n“I think we had a good run there,” Heath says. “Could have been better. It’s just a one-hit wonder, but there aren’t many books on two-hit wonders.”\n\nHeath says he got used to that fact – that for years no one wanted to hear him sing much else but “Jenny” – over time.\n\n“I got so tired of going on and playing a bunch of songs, and you’d see people thinking, ‘None of these sound like “Jenny,” and I can’t tell if they’re any good,'” Heath says.\n\nAs for why that song struck such a strong chord with listeners he’s not entirely sure: “There’s some kind of thought control going on because of the way the syllables work together,” he offers.\n\nToday he’s content playing what he wants when he wants to. He’s done new albums, good records, with his band based in the Pacific Northwest. He’s got a trio project on the side in Nashville – “this real kind of Garrison Keillor-approved trio that I’m working on.” And there’s a memoir deal in the works, too.\n\n“I’ve also started playing solo guitar now,” Heath says. “I’ve become this old storyteller, and it seems like an area I could keep going on and playing, so that’s nice, too.”\n\nGoodwill Gala\n\nWhen: 6 p.m. Friday, Oct. 27\n\nWhere: Monarch Beach Resort, Dana Point\n\nTickets: Individual tickets are $550, while sponsorship packages run $5,500-$100,000\n\nInformation: Call Amy at 714-480-3355 or email gala@ocgoodwill.org."
