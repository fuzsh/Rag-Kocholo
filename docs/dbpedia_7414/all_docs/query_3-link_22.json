        "text": "It’s probably the most famous telephone number in rock ‘n’ roll: 867-5309 (couldn’t resist singing it, could you?).\n\nSo well known are the seven digits that some people who were unfortunate enough to have that as their real home phone number were forced to change it because of all the prank calls.\n\nIn the early 1980s, “867-5309/Jenny” by Tommy Tutone was inescapable on the radio. The power pop song about a name and number scrawled on a wall was a No. 4 hit and can still be heard on oldies radio.\n\nTommy Tutone founder Tommy Heath said even in the age of cell phones, the song remains a calling card.\n\n“If I could figure out how to get royalties on passwords, I’d be rich,” Heath said. “It’s the number three password in the world, something like that.”\n\nHeath is scheduled to perform a solo show Saturday, June 29, at the Blue Note Grill in Durham. You can bet “867-5309/Jenny” will be on the playlist.\n\nHealth and Jim Keller formed Tommy Tutone in the late ‘70s. The band released its first album in 1980.\n\nIn 1981, the band released its biggest-selling album, “Tommy Tutone 2,” which included “867-5309/Jenny,” co-written by Keller and Alex Call.\n\nSince then, the catchy tune has popped up in innumerable TV shows, movies and ‘80s retrospectives, long outliving its pop song shelf life — the ultimate earworm.\n\nHeath attributes the song’s longevity to “some magic in the number sequence or something.” And yes, he still performs it in his shows.\n\n“It is the big song now. It’s still fun to play once a day,” Heath said in a recent telephone interview. “I can’t complain about that one.”\n\nNot that he hasn’t tired of the song over the years.\n\n“Back in the ‘90s it was a bit of a problem,” Heath said. “People didn’t want to hear anything new.”\n\nAnd Heath continues to make new music, long after Tommy Tutone’s early ‘80s heyday.\n\nTommy Tutone released its most recent album, “Beautiful Ending,” last month; Heath said he believes it’s the best thing they’ve done in 30 years. The album’s first, self-titled single is available on iTunes.\n\nThe album also contains a power pop version of the Jim Croce classic, “Operator,” which Heath describes as “my concept of The Clash playing Jim Croce.”\n\nOther recent Tutone songs such as “My Little Red Book” also feature that driving, guitar-based sound of the late ‘70s and early ‘80s, when songs like “My Sharona” and “Turning Japanese” were all over the radio.\n\nHeath said that’s the style he prefers.\n\n“I don’t go to concerts to hear the guitar solos,” he said, “I go to hear the songs.”\n\nAnd while Heath said he’s “ready to retire from being an ‘80s guy and be a modern guy,” he also acknowledges the lasting appeal of his band’s best-known song.\n\n“My guitar is named Jenny,” he said. “Anybody who comes to the show can get their picture taken with it for free.”\n\nStaff writer Rodger Mullen can be reached at rmullen@fayobserver.com or 910-486-3561."
