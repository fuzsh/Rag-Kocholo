        "text": "Tommy Tutone is an American power pop band, known for its 1981 hit \"867-5309/Jenny\", which peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100. Though some people consider the band to be a one-hit wonder, they did reach the Top 40 the year before with \"Angel Say No\".\n\nHistory\n\nTommy Heath and Jim Keller founded the band in 1978 along with bassist Terry Nails (Steve Jones, Ozzy Osbourne), with Heath acting as the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist, also playing keyboards on occasion. Keller played lead guitar and Terry Nails played bass and provided supporting vocals. Heath and Keller were the only constant members of Tommy Tutone during the band's heyday, and the lineup featured a rotating membership of bassists and drummers. Bassist Jon Lyons (original name Jonathan Lyons Terlep), who performed on \"867-5309\", replaced founding member Terry Nails, but was soon himself replaced by Greg Sutton, Pete Costello, and more recently Jimmy James. Mona Gnader, the bassist in Sammy Hagar's The Waboritas band, played with the band as well. Original drummer Kenny Johnson (of Chris Isaak's band) was replaced by Mickey Shine (Clover and the first Elvis Costello album), then Victor Carberry for the band's second album, and later Jerry Angel. John Cowsill of The Cowsills played percussion (and sang) on \"867-5309/Jenny\". From 2001 to 2010, the band consisted of Heath, James, Greg Georgeson (guitar), and Andy Gauthier (drums). By 2012, Tommy Heath had become a computer analyst and software engineer and moved to Portland, Oregon. In 2007, the band signed a recording contract with Spectra Records.\n\nIn 2017, with the addition of Steve Fister (Steppenwolf, Lita Ford) on guitar, Jimmy James switched to drums and the band released the single \"My Little Red Book\".\n\nJim Keller went on to become the director of Philip Glass's publishing company, Dunvagen Music Publishers. He still performs in New York City.\n\nIn 2019, the band released their first studio album since 1998, Beautiful Ending.\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n\nYear Album details Peak chart\n\npositions US\n\nCAN\n\n1980 Tommy Tutone\n\nRelease date: February 17, 1980\n\nLabel: Columbia/CBS Records\n\n68 82 1981 Tommy Tutone 2\n\nRelease date: September 23, 1981\n\nLabel: Columbia/CBS Records\n\n20 44 1983 National Emotion\n\nRelease date: April 16, 1983\n\nLabel: Columbia/CBS Records\n\n179 — 1996 Nervous Love\n\nRelease date: January 22, 1996\n\nLabel: Appaloosa Records\n\nNote: re-released in 2011 as A Long Time Ago\n\n— — 1998 Tutone.rtf\n\nRelease date: July 28, 1998\n\nLabel: Secret Disc Records\n\n— — 2019 Beautiful Ending\n\nRelease date: May 9, 2019\n\nLabel: One Music Group\n\n— — \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n\nSingles\n\nYear Single Peak chart positions Certifications\n\n(sales threshold) Album US\n\nUS Main\n\nCAN\n\nAUS\n\nNZ\n\n1980 \"Angel Say No\" 38 — — — — Tommy Tutone 1981 \"867-5309/Jenny\" 4 1 2 22 32\n\nUS: Gold\n\nTommy Tutone 2 1982 \"Which Man Are You\" — — — — — 1983 \"Get Around Girl\" — — — — — National Emotion 2017 \"My Little Red Book\" — — — — — Non-album singles 2018 \"Time Won't Let Me\" — — — — — 2018 \"When You Walk In the Room \" — — — — — \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n\nSee also"
