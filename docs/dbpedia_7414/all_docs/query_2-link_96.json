But... how do you ever remember CONCAT, LEFT, RIGHT, SEQUENCE, LEN?\n\nIn a special guest appearance on the 40th anniversary of the release of 867-5309 (Jenny), the lead singer of Tommy Tutone joins us with a song from his upcoming album - Music for Fellow Nerds.

An easier way to reverse text.\n\nHey, welcome back to the MrExcel netcast. I am Bill jeLEN.\n\nToday a question from me.\n\nActually, you know when we're trying to FIND a word inside some other text, we have two options here.\n\nWe have FIND and we have SEARCH that work really great, so they have no problem FINDing Jenny.\n\nUnless Jenny is backwards RIGHT then FIND and SEARCH don't have any way to say go backwards.\n\nSo the question is how do we reverse text so we can use FIND or SEARCH?\n\nYou've seen me do it just recently - three weeks ago in video 2439, I switched over into VBA and wrote this little loop.\n\nIf you watched the Financial Modeling World Cup semi-finals Lianna, who was competing head-to-head with like 5 minutes left to go.\n\nFlips over to VBA, and has the forethought to name her function, FlipItAndReverseIt. With this StrReverse, which is so much simpler.\n\nBut during this broadcast, Dan Mayoh, who was my Co-host on the show, said.\n\n“Well, you know you could do this with native functions…”.\n\nAnd you can see me just shaking my head like no, I'm not going to be able to do with native functions.\n\nBecause the native functions are too **** confusing.\n\nA comment on that video from Jose Carlos said “Oh no, hey yeah you can do it”. It's just CONCAT LEFT RIGHT SEQUENCE LENgth.\n\nI'm like what? how am I ever going to remember CONCAT LEFT, RIGHT SEQUENCE LENgth?\n\nI'm not making this up: from 1991 to 1999, I was working in Akron, ohio.\n\nAnd I had two Post-it notes on my wall.\n\nOne of them was this just simply trying to nest two functions.\n\nHow the MATCH goes inside the INDEX and now it's five functions? Look, it's not that I can't learn.\n\nYou know, over the years I've taken various memory training courses.\n\nAnd and one I remember taught me how to say the alphabet backwards.\n\nZ Y X W V U T S R Q P O N M L K J I H G F E D C B A.\n\nAnd it was just 40 years ago this week that Tommy Tutone taught the entire world how to memorize this number. 1981 November 1981 Jenny 867-5309.\n\nWe all still remember that and so I'm I'm wondering how am I ever going to remember CONCAT LEFT RIGHT SEQUENCE LENgth. It turns out, that Tommy Tutone is still alive.\n\nHe had a long career in I.T..\n\nHe still plays and still plays Jenny and I reached out. And here's his suggestion.\n\n[ Tom ]OK, I'm going to teach you how to search in reverse.\n\nRepeat after me. It's easy with five little words.\n\nCONCAT, LEFT, RIGHT SEQUENCE LEN. Your turn!\n\nCONCAT, LEFT, RIGHT SEQUENCE LEN. That's how you search in reverse.\n\nThat's how you turn it around. Its just five little words.\n\nCONCAT, LEFT, RIGHT SEQUENCE LEN. CONCAT, LEFT, RIGHT SEQUENCE LEN.\n\nCONCAT, LEFT, RIGHT SEQUENCE LEN. CONCAT, LEFT, RIGHT SEQUENCE LEN.\n\nI think you got it.\n\nThat's on my next record: Music For Fellow Nerds. Take care of yourself.\n\n[ Bill ] CONCAT LEFT, RIGHT SEQUENCE LENgth. Well, I think I've got it.\n\nI've got it now. Now the question is how does this work?\n\nHow do we take this string and turn it into “Jenny I've got your number”?\n\nInside, starting on the inside the LENgth of A3 is 26.\n\nThe SEQUENCE of 26 gives us numbers one through 26 as a spillable array, which is awesome.\n\nAnd then the RIGHT of A3 starting with 1, then 2, then 3, then 4.\n\nWorks backwards from the end of the string until we get the whole string backwards at the very last one.\n\nAnd then the LEFT, the LEFT gets the first letter: “Jenny I've got your number”. And then CONCAT puts it all together.\n\nSo there is a great way to do it.\n\nFive functions if you can just remember this hot little tune from Tommy Tutone. Check out my book MrExcel 2021 Unmasking Excel.\n\nLots of great formulas in there, although certainly not the reverse formula.\n\nWouldn't it be simpler if Microsoft just gave us =REVERSE?\n\nOf course then we never would have heard this great song Hey yeah, shout out to Tommy Tutone. You can find him on Cameo.\n\nHe will sing a nice little song for your next birthday, anniversary or whatever.\n\nCheck it out - great guy.\n\nIf you like these videos, please down below, Like, Subscribe, and Ring the Bell.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions or comments down in the YouTube comments below. Well, I want to thank you for stopping by.\n\nThanks to Tommy for agreeing to let me use this song here in this video.\n\nWe'll see you next time for another netcast from MrExcel."
