        "text": "The Gourds are the toast of Austin and unexpected places\n\nThe Gourds are the best band in Austin, Texas, according to the American-Statesman newspaper. Outside the region, they’re relatively unknown … except in the Netherlands, Belgium and England. Try to explain that one. “It all stems from our main record label, which is Munich Records, in Europe,” guitarist-mandolinist Kevin Russell\n\nRead More »\n\nTommy Tutone is back on the line\n\nDuring MTV’s infancy in early 1982, it was hard to escape Tommy Tutone’s infectious, million-selling “867-5309/Jenny.” Even 16 years later, that phone number is more recognizable than 10-10-321. Lead singer Tommy Heath, who started the San Francisco rock group with guitarist Jim Keller in 1978, acknowledges the song’s impact, but\n\nRead More »\n\nGetaway Cruiser drives a hard bargain\n\nIn just two short years, Getaway Cruiser has gone from a favorite in hometown Ann Arbor, Mich., to signing a big-label deal with 550 Music and releasing a new album produced by the in-demand Butcher Brothers. But anyone who thinks the rock quintet hasn’t paid its dues would get an\n\nRead More »\n\nIt’s still the time for the season of The Zombies\n\nChris White can’t help but laugh. Last November, the British rock quintet shared the same stage for the first time since its December 1967 breakup, brought together for a launching party for the release of the acclaimed box set “Zombie Heaven” (Ace). With no rehearsals, White (bass) and band mates\n\nRead More »\n\nBadfinger has that Special Touch\n\nThere are more deserving groups for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame than Badfinger, says original guitarist Joey Molland, but he would be honored just the same to be mentioned in the same breath. “We had a few hit records,” Molland said recently from his home in Shorewood, Minn.,\n\nRead More »\n\nPraga Khan is finally set free\n\nA track off Praga Khan’s new Antler Subway album, “Pragamatic,” says it all for leader Maurice Engelen: “My Mind Is My Enemy.” Engelen, who is one-third of the techno gods Lords of Acid, spent the past five years in the studio working on “Pragamatic,” as well as masterminding Lords of\n\nRead More »\n\nGeorge Benson Never Gives Up on a Good Thing\n\nEven in the late 1990s, George Benson still is breezin’ past conventionality, always looking for fresh, new ideas. On his latest GRP album, “Standing Together” (released June 2), the Grammy-winning jazz guitar and vocal legend continues down his familiar soul-jazz path, but he also veers off to add Afro-Cuban rhythms\n\nRead More »\n\nStanford Prison Experiment explores ‘Wrecreation’\n\nIf there’s any justice left in this world, “Compete,” the first single off Stanford Prison Experiment’s debut Island album, “Wrecreation,” would be a hit. A big hit. “Being in America, where we’re a true capitalist society,” singer Mario Jimenez said recently, “you’d think it’d make a lot of sense, but\n\nRead More »\n\nPete Seeger enjoys the good life\n\nPete Seeger seemingly has done it all in his 79-year life. In 1940, he formed the Almanac Singers with Woody Guthrie. He was one-fourth of the Weavers, the most influential and commercially successful folk group of the 1940s and ’50s. He was blacklisted by anti-Communist zealots in the early ’50s\n\nRead More »\n\nBig Brother’s still out for some cheap thrills\n\nWhen forming Big Brother and the Holding Company in 1966, guitarist Sam Andrew and bassist Peter Albin quickly learned they were not lead-singer material.
