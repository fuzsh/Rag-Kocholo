        "text": "Tommy Tutone is a power pop band, known for its 1981 hit \"867-5309/Jenny\", which peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100. They are an example to some of a one-hit wonder, even though they did reach the Top 40 the year before with \"Angel Say No.\"\n\nHistory[]\n\nTommy Heath and Jim Keller founded the band in 1978, with Heath acting as the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist, also playing keyboards on occasion; Keller playing lead guitar and supporting vocals. Heath and Keller were the only constant members of Tommy Tutone during the band's heyday, and the lineup featured a rotating membership of bassists and drummers. Bassist Jon Lyons (original name Jonathan Lyons Terlep), who performed on \"867-5309,\" replaced original bassist, Terry Nails. However, Lyons was soon replaced by Greg Sutton, later Pete Costello, and more recently Jimmy James. Mona Gnader, the bassist in Sammy Hagar's Waborita band, played with the band as well. Original drummer Mickey Shine (Clover and drummer on the first Elvis Costello album) was replaced by Victor Carberry for the band's second album. Carberry was in turn replaced with Jerry Angel. John Cowsill of The Cowsills played percussion (and sang) on \"867-5309/Jenny.\" From 2001-2010, the band has consisted of Heath, James, Greg Georgeson (guitar), Andy Gauthier (drums). Tommy Heath became a computer analyst and software engineer and moved to Portland, Oregon. In 2007, the band signed a recording contract with Spectra Records.\n\nIn 2017 with the addition of Steve Fister (Steppenwolf, Lita Ford) on guitar, Jimmy James switched to drums and the band released the single \"My Little Red Book\".\n\nJim Keller went on to become the director of Philip Glass's publishing company, Dunvagen Music Publishers. He still performs in New York City."
