        "text": "Who doesn’t love random cover songs? I absolutely love it when an artist drops a cover of a band that’s totally unexpected. Now, David Lee Roth has unleashed a cover of Tommy Tutone’s Top 5 classic “867-5309 / Jenny,” which he calls “That Telephone Song.” Of course, he’s joking when he calls it “That Telephone Song,” but that’s a pretty good name for it. You can listen to Roth’s cover via the YouTube player below. It’s cool to see this unexpected cover. I mean, you expect a metal band to cover Metallica, but when a pop or hip-hop artist covers Metallica, that’s something extra special.\n\nDavid Lee Roth Covers Tommy Tutone\n\nDavid Lee Roth stays pretty true to the original 1981 song, but he does go acoustic on the track. He turns down the powerful, electric guitars and instead adds acoustic strumming and an almost alternative rock approach. He also adds a bluesy harmonica solo instead of a guitar solo. So, even though the song structure stays true to the 1981 classic, Roth definitely puts his own stamp on it. I like the new version, but I think it’s hard to replace the nostalgia of that original Tommy Tutone classic. Many artists have tried to recreate its magic over the years. For whatever reason, the one that sticks in my head is Everclear’s cover of “867-5309 / Jenny.” The guys would often perform it live, too.\n\nI always think it’s chancy to cover such a massive hit, such as the Tommy Tutone one, but Roth has earned the right to take that risk. I’m curious to see what other random songs he decides to recreate in his own voice. He should do death metal next or folk and really switch things up. He’s already been pretty experimental when it comes to the kind of solo music he puts out there.\n\nThis isn’t the first bit of music Roth has shared with fans this year. He’s been active on YouTube lately and has unleashed a range of songs, as well as dance videos and even spoken-word pieces. About two months ago, he released a cover of the rap-rock anthem “Election Year.” Last year, Roth also revisited Van Halen‘s discography and put out new renditions of some classics, including “Panama” and “Ain’t Talkin’ Bout Love.” Roth has also teamed back up with former guitarist John 5 over the years to release some songs, such as “Somewhere Over the Rainbow Bar and Grill” and “Nothing Could Have Stopped Us Back Then Anyway.” So, now we can just wait to see what Roth has coming next.\n\nAnne Erickson started her radio career shortly after graduating from Michigan State University and has worked on-air in Detroit, Flint, Toledo, Lansing and beyond. As someone who absolutely loves rock, metal and alt music, she instantly fell in love with radio and hasn’t looked back. When she’s not working, Anne makes her own music with her band, Upon Wings, and she also loves cheering on her favorite Detroit and Michigan sports teams, especially Lions and MSU football. Anne is also an award-winning journalist, and her byline has run in a variety of national publications. You can also hear her weekends on WRIF."
