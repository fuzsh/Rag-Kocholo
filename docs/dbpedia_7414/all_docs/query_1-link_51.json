        "text": "Achieving success in the music industry isn’t easy under the best circumstances. Carving out a successful niche over the course of 40 years is immeasurably difficult.\n\nThe history of recorded music is littered with cautionary tales and stories of wasted potential, victims of excess, bad contracts, shady management, fickle trends, changes in technology and so much more.\n\nFor singer, songwriter, guitarist, manager and publisher Jim Keller, the key to survival was born out of desperation, the result of a willingness to learn from his experiences and an ability to adapt.\n\nIn November of 1981, Los Angeles pop rock group Tommy Tutone released the single “867-5309/Jenny.” By May of 1982, the song had cracked the top 5 in America, topping out at #4 on Billboard’s Hot 100 singles chart, a gold single which spawned infamous stories of prank calls, business stunts and pop culture placement everywhere from Cheers to Parks and Rec decades apart.\n\nToday, it stands as one of the most memorable songs of the 80s. But that six month climb was an eternity by pop standards.\n\nWhat came before it took even longer. Keller co-founded Tommy Tutone in 1978 alongside lead singer and rhythm guitarist Tommy Heath. Following the release of the group’s self-titled debut album in February 1980, they cracked the top 40 in America with the single “Angel Say No.”\n\nBut it took Tommy Tutone about four years to chart their biggest hit, not the overnight success story the group is often assumed to be. While the single, co-written by Keller and Alex Call, started to top out early in 1982, “Jenny” nevertheless lingered on the charts as the band delivered its third album National Emotion in April of 1983.\n\nWhile the rise took time, Tommy Tutone’s decline was quick.\n\n“About halfway through the record, how’s that?” jokes Keller when asked how long after the release of their third album it took before Tommy Tutone split up. “Would I have loved to have the third record be a platinum blockbuster? Hell yes. But we did not have it together to do that. And pop bands aren’t supposed to be around for a long time!” he explained. “All of the classic food groups were involved. Take your pick: Management, the label, the band. And the record wasn’t any good to me. We weren’t new wave. What the f—k is new wave? We were already imploding throughout the course of that record.”\n\nTouring large venues with acts like Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers, while charting a pair of hits, it seemed like Tommy Tutone had defied the pop odds. For Keller, it wasn’t easy processing the group’s fall.\n\n“The crash and burn part? It’s kind of a shock to the system,” he said. “I didn’t like swallow the record business hook, line and sinker. But I still lodged the hook in there pretty good. There was no way I was going to be able to spit that out. Even having some perspective, when you have a hit like that? That’s all I wanted to do at that part of my life. And it was happening! Then for it to start not happening, when the third record was going on and the major food groups were being tapped into by everybody involved, you don’t see straight. But everybody around you is still talking like it’s going to go platinum. You can’t help but believe that. So when it doesn’t happen? It was years before I made peace with that. And that’s not pretty.”\n\nKeller hit pause on the making of music in 1994, picking it back up again by 2005. But he didn’t leave the music industry.\n\nTaking stock of his experiences, Keller would apply what he learned from the rise and fall of Tommy Tutone, and his navigation of pitfalls as a major label recording artist, as he began his unlikely next music industry chapter.\n\n“I was a completely broke, unemployable, pop rock guitar player from a band that had self-destructed seven years before,” said Keller directly. “I couldn’t get a gig in New York, which is where I was living at the time. I couldn’t relate to the jingle scene. I don’t know how to score [music for film and television]. My music wasn’t really resonating in whatever was going on in the marketplace at that time. Nor do I think I was ready to be successful at that point again. You’re not owed it.”\n\nThe classical music world circa the mid-90s was an insular one, with gatekeepers largely controlling access to a kingdom populated primarily by the old guard.\n\nWhile his influence is unquestionable today, at that point, legendary pianist and composer Philip Glass was operating largely outside the conventional classical world, developing a ravenous, almost cult-like following while achieving success on his own terms.\n\nKeller has now worked alongside Glass for more than 25 years despite knowing virtually nothing about classical music. How did it happen? When Glass tells it, their meeting was born out of happenstance, paths crossing thanks to a little luck. Keller is a bit more blunt.\n\n“I bulls——ed my way into meeting him,” he said with a chuckle. “I like his story. Or mine. They’re both basically the same thing. It was an act of desperation that I had just kind of heard that his company had a vacancy. So I just called.”\n\nWhat started as a job grew. Keller came to handle Glass’s publishing, as director of the composer’s Dunvagen Music, eventually taking on the role of manager.\n\n“I was a little older than everybody else that was applying for the job. Everyone else was like young lawyers and stuff like that. I knew I was smart. I knew I was relatively sophisticated. It wasn’t like I had lived a sheltered life and came out of law school. I had been around the block. So I knew I had street smarts. But I had no idea,” said Keller, looking back. “I basically said, ‘Look, I’ll work for nothing. And if it doesn’t work out, you don’t lose anything. If it works out, then you can start paying me…’ Something to that effect. Which he loved. Because Philip came up from the street. He fought his way. Nothing was handed to Philip. So he related to the fact that I was coming from a similar place,” he continued.\n\n“I’ve told this story a million times but it’s true. On the last interview - and this had gone on for like six weeks or something - but he looked at me in his house, in his brownstone in the Village, and he said, ‘Jim, I never asked you… Do you know anything about my music?’ I looked him in the eye and I said, ‘No. I don’t.’ And he said, ‘OK.’ It was a testament to Philip that he didn’t need somebody else blowing smoke up his butt. And it worked. It worked for him.”\n\nKeller’s working relationship with Glass began just as the music industry was about to undergo radical upheaval amidst the rise of online file sharing and streaming that would come to define the next 20 years.\n\nClassical music is less dependent upon touring and album sales than the rock and pop worlds, leaving it a bit more insulated during the rise of the internet or even amidst pandemic.\n\nBut as friends, and artists he knew or once performed alongside, tried to navigate their new reality, as the major label system was upended by the ease of the online experience, Keller helped Glass forge ahead, seizing upon new revenue streams despite his lack of working knowledge in the classical market.\n\n“At that point, Philip was clearly established as who he was in the classical world and the modern music world. What was not happening was that he was not taking full advantage of all of the other areas of income or commerce that he might want to be a part of, whether that was film scoring or commercials,” Keller observed. “I got Martin Scorsese involved for Kundun and Peter Weir for The Truman Show - interesting film projects. With commercials, people were knocking Philip off left and right. And it was like, ‘Philip, you should be getting that money. That’s your music.’ I spent years not only opening those doors but saying, ‘Hey, we’re here and we’re not gonna bite.’”\n\nKeller went on to co-found, alongside Glass, his own boutique publishing and management company. Today, St. Rose Music handles publishing for artists like experimental singer songwriter Tom Waits and Indian sitar star Ravi Shankar. On the management side, he works with artists like young classical/pop composer and arranger Nico Muhly.\n\nSt. Rose doesn’t work with a large talent roster, the rare publishing/management group that truly caters to the artist, focusing instead on friends and like-minded musicians.\n\nWhile “bulls—t” may have gotten him in the door, Keller is keenly aware that honesty landed him the gig with Glass. It’s become a hallmark of his unique approach to artist management.\n\n“I am not your normal manager. Period. I’m not right for everybody,” he said of his business perspective. “I was having this meeting with a lawyer one time and he said to me something to the effect of, ‘I will not leave one dime on a negotiating table if I can get it.’ And I looked at him and said, ‘Man, I don’t really care about that one dime. Life is too short.’ I was thinking to myself, ‘I would never work with this guy in a million years,’” said Keller. “I always say to people who work for me, ‘The truth is incredibly impactful.’ Because you don’t have to remember what you were lying about. And people are just taken aback when you say ‘no.’ They’re like, ‘Wow! I’m not used to that.’ We’re surrounded in the management/agent world by people who will say anything they think you want to hear. I can’t do that.”\n\nIn 2005, Keller began writing, recording and performing again. And honesty impacts his songwriting perspective too. He released three solo albums and his Tuesday night residency performances in New York became infamous for the special guests that often seemed to be dropping in.\n\nHis latest album By No Means, now available, is a stripped down affair where songwriting shines. On his latest project, Keller sings in a low register, channeling Tom Waits, a record which features longtime colleague David Hidalgo (Los Lobos) on guitar, alongside a rhythm section rounded out by famed session musician Bob Glaub (Jackson Browne) on bass and drummer Michael Urbano (John Hiatt). Producer Mitchell Froom (Crowded House, Paul McCartney) ties everything together, sprinkling in keyboards throughout.\n\n“I hadn’t done a record in a handful of years. It had been awhile. I was doing some work with Mitchell Froom with somebody else. And he and I just hit it off. But I sent him 25 or 30 songs,” Keller recalled. “When I write, I sit with an acoustic guitar in my lap and I sing in either this voice you’re hearing or lower. Because it’s usually in the morning. So half of the songs I sent him were me singing down in this low key with just my acoustic guitar quietly. Mitchell got back to me. He literally called me the next day and said, ‘I totally love this. There is a thing here completely and I have a beat on it.’ He said that the intimacy of those core demos - the very, very simple ones - really resonated for him. So, from the get go, that is what he gravitated toward - this down and dirty approach.”\n\nWorking with songwriting partner, and Lumineers multi-instrumentalist/backing vocalist, Byron Isaacs, Keller crafted the new batch of 11 songs with an emphasis on storytelling.\n\n“Don’t Get Me Started” evolved online early in the pandemic to include a host of quarantined friends adding a solo to the track’s end. A diverse array of artists ranging anywhere from Wilco’s Nels Cline to Philip Glass put a unique stamp on the song, one which lays out the sad tale of a man going through a rough patch amidst the onset of COVID.\n\nKeller donated the proceeds from “Easy Rider,” a track which nostalgically examines the life of a touring musician, to Sweet Relief Musicians Fund, a charity which helps artists in need.\n\nThe word pivot has been thrown around frequently over the past year as artists attempt to adapt to a world where traditional live performance remains off the table indefinitely amidst pandemic.\n\nFor Keller, making the transition from pop star to working songwriter, while embracing the worlds of management and publishing, is a process that played out over the course of four decades.\n\nReflecting on his fourth solo album By No Means, he’s clear on what’s responsible for that longevity.\n\n“The first word that came to mind is desperation. I don’t mean that to be trite. It’s like I have to do this. I have to play music. Because I stopped for a while. When I first started working with Philip, and I got married and had a kid, I stopped for almost 10 years. Didn’t play. And my world flipped upside down. It did not work anymore. And it wasn’t until I brought music back in that it worked again. And it’s because I did not have a choice,” said Keller. “When I tried not to do it, my world didn’t work. So when I say it’s desperation, it is. And I don’t care what it is in your life - for me, it’s music. But what are the two most important things to me? Well, it’s family and music. And I’m not sure which order they go in. Don’t tell my family I said that,” he continued with a knowing laugh.\n\n“But it’s like oxygen. And if you don’t have that irrational enthusiasm, then you don’t really need to do it. And you probably won’t when things get tough. But if you can’t live without it, then you do anything it takes to get to it, you know? And there is a desperation in that to some degree.”"
