We provide a wide array of programs for all levels of the hunter/jumper sport, and are mindful of the well-being of our equine partners. We are committed to preserving the history of our sport and the association. Through our Colorado Hunter Jumper Foundation, CHJA supports charitable and benevolent services.\n\nCHJA Vision\n\nOur vision is to increase awareness and participation in our programs and services for all involved in the hunter/jumper competitive sport. We strive to provide value to our members, as well as strengthen the positive image of CHJA both within and outside the hunter/jumper sphere.\n\nStrategic Intent\n\nAnyone participating in hunter/jumper competitive sport within the state of Colorado or its nearby contiguous areas will be aware of the existence of CHJA and will be partaking in or benefitting from at least one of its programs, services or offerings.\n\nCHJA Core Value\n\nOur core value is the creation of member satisfaction through the delivery of excellent programs, competitions, and educational opportunities based on the four cornerstones."
