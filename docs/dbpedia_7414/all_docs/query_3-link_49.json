        "text": "I never knew this in the 1980s but the singer is not Tommy Tutone…that is the band’s name. They were led by Tommy Heath and Jim Keller and originally called themselves Tommy and the Two-Tones.\n\nIf you were listening to the radio in the eighties you remember this song. A great little power pop song that gave you a phone number you could not forget. The song peaked at #4 on the Billboard 100 and #2 in Canada in 1982. After it became a hit I started to think about the poor souls who had that number under different area codes. It changed their lives…\n\nMrs. Lorene Burns, an Alabama householder formerly at +1-205-867-5309; she changed her number in 1982: When we’d first get calls at 2 or 3 in the morning, my husband would answer the phone. He can’t hear too well. They’d ask for Jenny, and he’d say “Jimmy doesn’t live here anymore.” … Tommy Tutone was the one who had the record. I’d like to get hold of his neck and choke him.\n\nThe song, released in late 1981, initially gained popularity on the American West Coast in January 1982… many who had the number soon abandoned it because of unwanted calls.\n\nAsking telephone companies to trace the calls was of no use, as Charles and Maurine Shambarger (then in West Akron, Ohio at +1-216-867-5309) learned when Ohio Bell explained “We don’t know what to make of this. The calls are coming from all over the place.” A little over a month later, they disconnected the number and the phone became silent.\n\nJim Keller, the lead guitarist of the band, claims that Jenny was a girl he knew and that some friends wrote her number on the wall of a men’s room as a prank. Keller says he called her and they dated for some time. Yet Alex Call, who co-wrote the song with Jim Keller, claims there was never any Jenny and that 867-5309 came to him “out of the ether.” They are lucky no one got to them and…get hold of his neck and choke him.\n\nAlex Call: “Despite all the mythology to the contrary, I actually just came up with the ‘Jenny,’ and the telephone number and the music and all that just sitting in my backyard. There was no Jenny. I don’t know where the number came from, I was just trying to write a 4-chord rock song and it just kind of came out.\n\nThis was back in 1981 when I wrote it, and I had at the time a little squirrel-powered 4-track in this industrial yard in California, and I went up there and made a tape of it. I had the guitar lick, I had the name and number, but I didn’t know what the song was about. This buddy of mine, Jim Keller, who’s the co-writer, was the lead guitar player in Tommy Tutone. He stopped by that afternoon and he said, ‘Al, it’s a girl’s number on a bathroom wall,’ and we had a good laugh. I said, ‘That’s exactly right, that’s exactly what it is.’\n\nI had the thing recorded. I had the name and number, and they were in the same spots, ‘Jenny… 867-5309.’ I had all that going, but I had a blind spot in the creative process, I didn’t realize it would be a girl’s number on a bathroom wall. When Jim showed up, we wrote the verses in 15 or 20 minutes, they were just obvious. It was just a fun thing, we never thought it would get cut. In fact, even after Tommy Tutone made the record and ‘867-5309’ got on the air, it really didn’t have a lot of promotion to begin with, but it was one of those songs that got a lot of requests and stayed on the charts. It was on the charts for 40 weeks.”\n\n867-5309 / Jenny\n\nJenny Jenny who can I turn to\n\nYou give me something I can hold on to\n\nI know you’ll think I’m like the others before\n\nWho saw your name and number on the wall\n\nJenny I’ve got your number\n\nI need to make you mine\n\nJenny don’t change your number\n\nEight six seven five three oh nine\n\nEight six seven five three oh nine\n\nEight six seven five three oh nine\n\nEight six seven five three oh nine\n\nJenny jenny you’re the girl for me\n\nYou don’t know me but you make me so happy\n\nI tried to call you before but I lost my nerve\n\nI tried my imagination but I was disturbed\n\nJenny I’ve got your number\n\nI need to make you mine\n\nJenny don’t change your number\n\nEight six seven five three oh nine\n\nEight six seven five three oh nine\n\nEight six seven five three oh nine\n\nEight six seven five three oh nine\n\nI got it (i got it) I got it\n\nI got your number on the wall\n\nI got it (i got it) I got it\n\nFor a good time, for a good time call\n\nJenny don’t change your number\n\nI need to make you mine\n\nJenny I’ve called your number\n\nEight six seven five three oh nine\n\nEight six seven five three oh nine\n\nEight six seven five three oh nine\n\nEight six seven five three oh nine\n\nJenny Jenny who can I turn to (eight six seven five three oh nine)\n\nFor the price of a dime I can always turn to you (eight six seven five three oh nine)"
