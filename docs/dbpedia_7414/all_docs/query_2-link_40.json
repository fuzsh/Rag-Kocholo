        "text": "If your phone number in 1981 happened to be “867-5309,” regardless of the area code, chances are your phone was ringing off the hook with someone asking for Jenny.\n\nThat number was part of pop band Tommy Tutone’s hit “Jenny,” which reached No. 4 in the Billboard Charts that year.\n\nAnd lead singer Tommy Heath said he’s sorry.\n\n“We were just kidding around, just making something that comes off the lips,” he said during a telephone interview from his Portland, Ore., home. “It caused a lot of trouble, which I learned about because people who were mad at me put my phone number in their article about me. I had to change it. I’m sorry folks, we were just messing around.”\n\nHeath will perform Friday, Aug. 15, at Hollywood Casino in Charles Town, W.Va., as part of the show called Rock of the ’80s. Also performing are The Smithereens, The Romantics and Marshall Crenshaw.\n\nEven after more than 30 years, Heath is still amazed by the kind of staying power “Jenny” continues to have.\n\n“I had no idea it would have that kind of lifetime. It seems to keep on growing. It’s everyone’s PIN number. I just have to figure out how to get royalties,” he joked. “It’s nice to see something you create floating out there. I don’t know what it is, or why, but there it is.”\n\nOn the stage despite shyness\n\nA child of the 1950s and a teenager of the 1960s, Heath, 67, said his older brother was in bands. Heath also played piano. By the time he was in high school in the ’60s, the incredibly shy Heath “sat in my room and played banjo and folk guitar.”\n\nSome of the shyness seemed to wear off by the time he was in college, and his love for music became stronger.\n\n“Eventually, when I got in college in the 1970s, I didn’t really like any of the music out there,” he said. “So I started playing music in self-defense with my friends. I, the shyest person in the room, stepped on the stage and took over and became this really obnoxious, almost Jerry Lee Lewis kind of kind of guy, and became the leader, much to everyone’s surprise.”\n\nAnd although the band Tommy Tutone would be considered more pop, Heath said all during the 1970s, he “wasn’t into rock ‘n’ roll.”\n\n“I played in country-western bands and soul bands, some reggae bands, swing bands,” he said. “I was kind of studying all these kinds of music, kind of preparing for something. I wasn’t sure what.”\n\nAlthough he was experimenting with music, Heath continued his college education and earned a teaching certificate.\n\n“Turns out, I’m a terrible teacher,” he said.\n\nJourney of a band\n\nIn 1978, Heath and Jim Keller founded Tommy Tutone. That same year, Heath moved back to San Francisco.\n\n“And people were telling me we were new-wave. I said, ‘What’s that?’ It went from there,” he said.\n\nThe band released its self-titled debut album in 1980, which produced its first single, “Angel Say No.”\n\nA year later, the band released “Tommy Tutone 2,” which gave it the highest-charting song, “Jenny.”\n\nIn 1983, the group released its final album, “Nervous Emotion,” which featured the single “Get Around Girl.”\n\nHeath said he can still remember the first time he heard one of the band’s songs on the radio.\n\n“Music sounds really different when you play it in the studio than when you play it on the radio. That’s vinyl, folks, for those of you who remember. It’s much more compressed and powerful, and it was our first album,” he said. “We had two songs, an AM hit and an FM hit. And the FM hit was called ‘Cheap Date.’ It’s really a sparse, reggae song. I just thought it sounded totally loopy on the record, but when it came on the radio, it was ... Producer Eddie Thacker knew what he was doing. .... It was really amazing for me. And my voice really comes through on radio more than some other people’s. Like if you listen to The Boss, he’s got a huge band. And he’s got to go to the piano and stuff because his voice can’t cut through the whole band. I can cut through anything. I may not be a great singer, but I can cut through.”\n\nMemorable moments\n\nOne of Heath’s favorite appearances was on “The Dick Clark Show.” He grew up in Philadelphia and his older sister appeared on the show when it was still a local one.\n\nClark wanted the band to perform “Jenny.” But that meant Heath had to lip-synch.\n\n“I sing the song different every night. It was a story that I told. I told a slightly different version,” he said. “My manager told me, ‘Well, you’ll have to practice.’ And he turned on the radio and there it is. I practiced singing to myself while on my way to lip-synch to my song.”\n\nHeath also remembers singing in a theater in Louisville, Ky., where “the great debaters debated in this thing without a PA system.”\n\nDuring a performance, Heath said he realized the band didn’t need a PA system, either.\n\n“I got the band to play quiet. And I went down and sat on the front of the stage and sang without a microphone,” he said. “I can belt it out. That really meant a lot to me. I try to tear down that fourth wall between us and the audience.”\n\nHeath said he never really completely got over his shyness.\n\n“I could sing to 20,000 people before I could talk in a board meeting to five people,” he said.\n\nDual hobbies\n\nToday, Heath is a software engineer.\n\n“Not any more than musician. Both hobbies I’ve tried to make money at basically,” he said.\n\nSoftware was just a hobby that grew for him.\n\n“I got into software as a hobby really, really not pointing toward anything,” he said. “A true generalist just waiting for the assignment to make sense, coming to me from outer space, where I have to know a little bit about everything. Music was just one of those many things. I was a weekend warrior for most of the ’70s and I got serious about it.”\n\nHeath said he didn’t really get to know the other performers when they were all playing during the ’80s.\n\n“I got to know them in the 1990s, when we were all just trying to make it through the ’90s. Before we got cool again,” he said. “There’s nothing worse than 10 years out and out of date. When you get to be 15 years out, you’re hip again.\n\nHeath said when he lived in Nashville, Tenn., he used to watch The Smithereens perform.\n\n“They’re one of my favorite all-time bands, but I never thought of them as the ’80s,” he said. “There needs to be a different name for the period of ’87 to ’94, which had its own thing.”\n\nIn the 1990s, Heath said he played a benefit concert with The Smithereens in Wisconsin that got rained out.\n\n“We moved it to this local bar and we played in this local bar for people, but not everyone could fit in,” he said. “So we played two or three sets and had different people fill up the bar. We both love to play, we’re not charging by the note here. So we hung out a bunch together with The Smithereens.”\n\nThe Romantics and Tommy Tutone are playing more together. Heath said Mike Skill lives in Portland, too.\n\n“And we gradually got to know each other over time,” he said.\n\nNo pretending\n\nHeath said he opted during the 1990s to stay off the road because he didn’t want to play other people’s songs.\n\n“There was a period in the ’90s, I just wouldn’t bother if I had to do songs by other people. I’d do a song because it was a song that I liked, but it wouldn’t sound anything like them. When my idea of a cover band, you play and you make it your own, not sound like them, that sounds stupid to me. And I don’t know if I’m good enough,” he said. “I tell my band they’re musicians and I’m an artist because I’m just kind of pretending to be a musician. That’s how I present my art. I don’t consider myself a real serious musician. But somewhere along the way, I learned to play good enough. And I just connect with people. I feel the energy floating around and channel. I really depend on the people feeding back. You do these big concerts sometimes and we have these speaker systems where we have these things called side fills, well they’re aimed at us so we can hear ourselves in addition to the monitors. If I notice that people on the fourth row can’t hear me talk, we turn the side fills and turn it at them. That’s the person I’m singing to.”\n\nHeath said Tommy Tutone’s music is really Americana. His last album, “Soul Twang,” explores the Americana roots.\n\n“It’s not based on any rock ‘n’ roll. I’m writing music based on how rock ‘n’ roll was originally invented,” he said. “I take a soul song, a country-western song and rockabilly song and put them together and create a rock ‘n’ roll song. I listen to a few things for fun. I’m not stealing from rock ‘n’ roll songs at all. Every song I’m trying to assemble to see a different versions of rockable. And they’re all based on stories. Danceable stories, hopefully. Some are going to be fun. Some are from the heart. And then none of them sound like ‘Jenny,’ and ‘Jenny’s’ unique.”\n\nHe’s working on a new album called “Slow Learner,” which is filled with new songs.\n\nAs for those who are coming to see him perform at Hollywood Casino, Heath said to expect more than “Jenny.” Or even a set list.\n\n“I do stream of consciousness,” he said.\n\nWHAT: Rock of the ‘80s\n\nWHEN: 9 p.m. Friday, Aug. 15\n\nWHERE: Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races, The Event Center, 750 Hollywood Drive, Charles Town, W.Va.\n\nCOST: Tickets cost $24.05 and $57.35.\n\nMORE: Concert featuring The Smithereens, The Romantics, Marshall Crenshaw and Tommy Tutone\n\nCONTACT: Go to www.hollywoodcasinocharlestown.com."
