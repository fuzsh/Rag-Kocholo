        "text": "Recently, while working on a project where I needed to document some procedures here at Quadel - I was writing a sample script that included a phone number. I couldn’t resist sprinkling in just a little bit of humor, so I added the phone number, 867-5309. #iykyk To my delight, a co-worker who was later reviewing the procedures found my little Easter egg and sent me a message. She thanked me for brightening her day, and it put a huge smile on my face! Thanks for letting me know Nydia Parries ;) It’s moments like these that remind me of the fantastic connections we can build in the workplace. It’s not just about getting the job done; it’s about sharing a laugh and making each other’s days a little brighter. Having fun at work is not just a perk; it’s absolutely necessary for fostering creativity, boosting morale, and strengthening our bonds as a team. Here’s to building strong connections with your co-workers, infusing a bit of fun into the daily grind, and finding joy in every workday! #WorkplaceFun #Teamwork #EasterEgg"
