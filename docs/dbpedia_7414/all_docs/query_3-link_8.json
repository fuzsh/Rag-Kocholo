        "text": "In 1981, you couldn’t pass a radio without hearing “Jenny,” also known as 867-5309, by Tommy Tutone. The catchy tune about a guy romanticizing a phone number he found on a bathroom wall reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart, and is now firmly entrenched in 1980s pop culture. We thought it would be interesting to catch up with Tommy Heath, the lead singer and rhythm guitarist of Tommy Tutone. Heath, 72, now lives in Portland, Oregon, and works part-time as a computer programmer and musician. Following are edited excerpts from a longer conversation.\n\nJim Clash: Why was the song “Jenny” so popular?\n\nTommy Heath: It’s numerology or something, a magic combination. It’s kind of a nursery rhyme, but I think I injected some soul into it. You know, if I could only figure that out, if there was a formula. I did do a follow-up record a few years later when I was on my own. I took it in to this guy, and he listened and couldn’t find anything that sounded like “Jenny,” so he didn’t know if it was any good. He literally couldn’t tell! Just for laughs, I did another song called, “Jenny’s Got The Blues.” In it, Jenny and I get married, we have a daughter Jenny, and she’s running wild calling me from a phone booth on the edge of town. It’s a good story. Anyway, I put it on the record later, and sure enough this time the same guy says, “Of course, he had to copy himself to come up with something [laughs].”\n\nClash: Was there really a Jenny, or was it somebody in the song-writers’ heads - Alex Call and Jim Keller? There seems to be debate here.\n\nHeath: They tell me I have a tenuous hold on reality. But Jenny and I think she’s real, and Jim and Alex say she’s not. That’s all I can say. She did give me that number, and I did write it on the bathroom wall instead of giving it to Jim. But they claim that never happened.\n\nClash: Who is the guy in the song?\n\nHeath: The guy’s a stalker. Somehow I, being such a great character, am able to convince you that he’s got a heart of gold, so everybody likes him. But he’s this whole character in some of our early songs. We call him dumb but concerned. He just can’t figure some stuff out. You can hear him on “Cheap Date” and “Angel Say No” on the first album. He’s a character in my head.\n\nClash: Do you ever get sick of doing, “Jenny?”\n\nHeath: No, I love the song. In fact, I’m still learning from it. When I do remakes, I can’t sing out of tune the way I did, so I recently had to use one of those “put yourself in tune” things to put myself out of tune [laughs]. But it’s actually a piece of work that you can learn something new from each time you do it. Guys try to make me play it like we’re in a karaoke band, but I just play it however I feel. There’s a lot to do in there. I even wrote a swing version.\n\nClash: I heard that when People magazine interviewed you, they published your real phone number. True?\n\nHeath: Yes, and that’s a good RF [joke], as we used to say in the college days. If you can’t take a good RF, move out.\n\nClash: Did you get calls?\n\nHeath: I had to convert to a fan phone. I put one of those old answering machines on it. It never stopped ringing.\n\nClash: Do you make much off of royalties from “Jenny?”\n\nHeath: Some years, yeah, when you have a jingle or it’s in a movie.\n\nClash: You’re known for having that little gap between your front teeth, like David Letterman. Ever think about getting it fixed?\n\nHeath: There was a blog once, really before the Internet was big, and a guy had a picture of me, Dave, the guitarist from Sultans of Swing [Mark Knopfler] and one other person, and he put them all up there and said these are guys who actually are in one family. And it looks exactly like a big family of guys with the gap.\n\nEditor’s Note: Tommy Heath’s latest effort is, “Beautiful Ending.”"
