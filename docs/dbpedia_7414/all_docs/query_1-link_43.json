        "text": "‘Jenny Jenny, who can I turn to? You give me somethin’ I can hold on to’…the famous track from the 80s power pop band is a favourite of many, and when Tommy Tutone began to play it half way through their set, they had the entire audience in the palm of their hand, singing and dancing along like mad. Although the line up of the band had changed considerably since their formation in the late 70s, Tommy Heath, the front man, has remained present throughout their alterations, and has helped the audience to stay grounded in their origins.\n\nThe band are known for their high energy shows and tight backing vocals, and all of this was on top for when I got the chance to see them perform. They opened the show with their single Get Around Girl, and accompanied it with a small choreographed dance routine, which immediately showed the audience that they were in for a great show! They played through a selection of tracks from their various albums, such as Nervous Love, and Titone.rtf. They took time to thank the audience, and introduce is thoroughly to their songs, which was awesome, because it’s an experience you can only have live.\n\nRead more"
