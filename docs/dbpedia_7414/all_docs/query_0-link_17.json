        "text": "By Kady Weddles\n\nThe 80s hit band Tommy Tutone, best known for its hit single “Jenny/867-5309”, will perform in a free outdoor concert at the Martin Event Space, 13440 Holmes Rd. Saturday, October 2 starting at 2pm. The M80s, an 80s cover band, will open the show.\n\nMartin City Brewing Company will be selling beverages from inside the event space. Nick Lewman, president of the Martin City Business Community Association which is sponsoring the event, encourages visitors to plan to have lunch, carryout or dinner at the many surrounding restaurants in Martin City. Food trucks and barbecue will also be for sale at the concert.\n\nLawn chairs and blankets are encouraged.\n\nTommy Tutone had its biggest–and only–hit in 1981 when the song 867-5309 peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n“This is our chance to bring the community together for some live music and a great time,” said the brewery’s creative director, Lynne Pierce. “We encourage all guests to spend the day in Martin City, showing love to all of our amazing retailers and restaurants.”"
