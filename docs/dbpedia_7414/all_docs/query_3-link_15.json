        "text": "Tommy Tutone is a power pop band, best known for its 1981 hit \"867-5309/Jenny\", which peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100. Although it is usually referred to as a San Franciscoband, it was actually based in Willits, California, at the time that \"Jenny\" was released. The song became so popular that people in the United States to this day dial this telephone numberand ask for Jenny as a prank. Regarding the famous number, \"We had people threatening to sue us. It was the Buffalo Chief of Police's daughter's number in New York,\" said frontman Tommy Heath.\n\nA common misconception is that Tommy Tutone is the name of the lead singer; it is actually the name of the band. Tommy Heath is the lead singer. The name of the band developed from its original name, Tommy and the Tu-tones, to merely Tommy Tutone.\n\nBassist Terry Nails also worked for Ozzy Osbourne. Mickey Shine also worked for Elvis Costello and the Attractions. John Cowsill of The Cowsills played drums on Jenny.\n\nGenres[]\n\nPower Pop"
