Heath and company never quite reclaimed the sparkle of the band’s single top five entry, splitting up in 1984 before retooling in 1996 with the record Nervous Love, but Heath has kept busy. He’s tried his hand as a country songwriter, was a substitute teacher for a few years, and by-and-large treats music as a hobby that can pay for itself.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles by David Staples, Keith Gerein and others, Oilers news from Cult of Hockey, Ask EJ Anything features, the Noon News Roundup and Under the Dome newsletters.\n\nUnlimited online access to Edmonton Journal and 15 news sites with one account.\n\nEdmonton Journal ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSupport local journalism.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles by David Staples, Keith Gerein and others, Oilers news from Cult of Hockey, Ask EJ Anything features, the Noon News Roundup and Under the Dome newsletters.\n\nUnlimited online access to Edmonton Journal and 15 news sites with one account.\n\nEdmonton Journal ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSupport local journalism.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\nThat being said, the 72-year-old Heath doesn’t carry the nostalgia tag very well. He’s got a new Tommy Tutone album in the can called Beautiful Ending, and looks forward to the next few years introducing fans to his new songs. We spoke with Heath in advance of his show at Hawrelak Park on Saturday night.\n\nQ: It feels a little as though you’ve got a secret identity; during the day you’re mild-mannered software engineer Tommy Heath, and at night you’re rock star Tommy Tutone, even if you were never actually Tommy Tutone.\n\nA: Oh, man, I could never stand the way that rock stars walk around. It’s so corny. I have musician friends that can’t go out in public, and I don’t know how they can stand it. Plus, from a writer’s point of view I want to write about regular people, not rock stars.\n\nQ: After the band broke up in ’84 was it hard to make the adjustment to a life in the real world?\n\nA: It was hard because we blew it in a way. You have a big hit and instead of following it up with another we decided to do our big concept album (National Emotion), which eight people in the world ended up hearing.\n\nQ: That’s a comedown.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nA: It could be frustrating, especially because nobody in the ’90s wanted to hear my new music. Unfortunately I’ve never been good at promoting myself. Things are changing, though; I’ve sold whole shows where nobody has heard of any of the songs. I’m looking forward to (the Rock Music Festival) because I have a single, Beautiful Ending, and we’re pushing it old school with interviews and in-store appearances. I feel like if I can get people to listen to the songs they’ll like them.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nQ: I hear a connection between your singing and the singing of Craig Finn from the Hold Steady, so I wouldn’t be surprised if you could grab that audience.\n\nA: I don’t know those guys but I admire people who channel earlier music. Like Martha and the Motels, who were thoroughly modern but you could still hear the echoes of Roy Orbison in their music. My early history was in rockabilly, soul, and country; I didn’t play rock until the ’70s.\n\nQ: Tommy Tutone guitarist Jim Keller and Alex Call of Clover wrote 867-5309; what do you think you would have done with the money if you’d had a slice of that chart scorcher?\n\nA: Well, I’m a cheap date. I don’t think I would have gone crazy with money, though I’m generous in some ways. I mean, I would never have spent it all on dope or anything.\n\nQ: People don’t remember the song Cheap Date, but that was your first notable success.\n\nA: It got bootlegged off my record and became an AOR phenomenon. That song helped K-ROQ in Pasadena establish the modern sound.\n\nQ: Are you enjoying this latter-day Tommy Tutone resurgence, with accompanying festival dates? Do you think you’ve improved over the years?\n\nA: I’ve become a much better storyteller, yes, and I’m enjoying the times when I play acoustic. Sometimes it’s just me and my guitar with a washboard player. It feels good; I just put my dad in the ground at 99, so I figure that maybe I have legs.\n\nPREVIEW\n\nTommy Tutone at the Edmonton Rock Music Festival\n\nWhen: Saturday at 8:15 p.m.\n\nWhere: Heritage Amphitheatre, Hawrelak Park\n\nTickets: $140 weekend pass, available in advance from the Rock Fest website; single day tickets also available\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
