        "text": "Tommy Tutone\n\nTommy Heath and Jim Keller founded the band in 1978 along with bassist Terry Nails (Steve Jones, Ozzy Osbourne), with Heath acting as the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist, also playing keyboards on occasion. Keller played lead guitar and Terry Nails played bass and provided supporting vocals. Heath and Keller were the only constant members of Tommy Tutone during the band’s heyday, and the lineup featured a rotating membership of bassists and drummers. Bassist Jon Lyons (original name Jonathan Lyons Terlep), who performed on “867-5309”, replaced founding member Terry Nails, but was soon himself replaced by Greg Sutton, Pete Costello, and more recently Jimmy James. Mona Gnader, the bassist in Sammy Hagar’s The Waboritas band, played with the band as well. Original drummer Kenny Johnson (of Chris Isaak’s band) was replaced by Mickey Shine (Clover and the first Elvis Costello album), then Victor Carberry for the band’s second album, and later Jerry Angel. John Cowsill of The Cowsills played percussion (and sang) on “867-5309/Jenny”.[1] From 2001 to 2010, the band consisted of Heath, James, Greg Georgeson (guitar), and Andy Gauthier (drums). By 2012, Tommy Heath had become a computer analyst and software engineer and moved to Portland, Oregon.[2][3] In 2007, the band signed a recording contract with Spectra Records.\n\nIn 2017, with the addition of Steve Fister (Steppenwolf, Lita Ford) on guitar, Jimmy James switched to drums and the band released the single “My Little Red Book”.\n\nJim Keller went on to become the director of Philip Glass’s publishing company, Dunvagen Music Publishers.[4] He still performs in New York City.\n\nIn 2019, the band released their first studio album since 1998, Beautiful Ending."
