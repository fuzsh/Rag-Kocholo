        "text": "He gave voice to the most famous phone number in music history.\n\nTommy Heath, lead singer of the band Tommy Tutone, will perform a solo acoustic set in Walsenburg Dec. 5. The show is a fundraiser for the historic Fox Theatre, where the concert will be held.\n\nHeath sang Tommy Tutone's biggest hit, “867-5309/Jenny,\" a song that has become a classic rock staple. As a solo artist, Heath has released several albums, but also continues to perform with the band. He currently lives in Nashville, Tenn., and plans to release a new CD in 2010.\n\nFred James and Mary-Ann Brandon will open the show. The husband-and-wife team has earned nine Grammy nominations for blues compositions. They have performed with numerous artists, including Tommy Tutone, and written songs for Koko Taylor, Johnny Winter, Bonnie Raitt and others.\n\nThe concert is being put on by the nonprofit Spanish Peaks Alliance for Arts and Education. The organization is renovating the theater in hopes of turning it into a regional performing arts center.\n\nThe concert starts at 7:30 p.m. Tickets are $20. For information, call 719-742-3069 or visit www.spanishpeaksalliance.org .\n\n- Amy Matthew"
