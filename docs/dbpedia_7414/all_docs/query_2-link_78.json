        "text": "Tommy Tutone will be the headline act as BOB Stock returns for its second year of free music at Riverside Park on July 11 and 12.\n\nTutone is best known for “867-5309 (Jenny),” which became a hit in 1982 and started a fad of people calling the number, which was valid in dozens of area codes, and asking for Jenny. That was a source of irritation to a local family that had the number, which happened to have a Fort Morgan prefix.\n\n“There was no Jenny,” songwriter Alex Call (who co-wrote the song with Jim Keller) told a Tampa, Fla., columnist in June 2009. “The number? It came to me out of the ether.”\n\nBOB Stock is put on by Media Logic Radio, BOB FM 97.5.\n\nThere will be two stages for continuous live music throughout Saturday at BOB Stock, said organizer Patti Rousselle. Music is slated for 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. at Riverside Park.\n\nThere will also be booths providing crafts, food and games for all ages.\n\nChristian Music from local artists is slated Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the same location.\n\nAppearing along with Tommy Tutone on Saturday’s schedule are Subrosa Union, an alternative power rock trio just back from a USO tour and featuring frontman Mike Anaya, whose father Michael is CEO of Colorado Plains Medical Center in Fort Morgan; Penchant, a tribute to Led Zeppelin; Synthetic Elements, most of whose members have their roots in Fort Morgan; local rock cover bands Unleashed and Bittersweet; and local garage band As of Late, among others.\n\nAs of Late will open the show and is the first in a planned series of local “garage bands of the year.”\n\nMedia Logic plans to have a progression of performers at BOB Stock each year, from garage bands just getting started to acts that have had big hits.\n\nSponsors include the City of Fort Morgan, Colorado Plains Medical Center, Ehrlich Toyota East, Verizon dealer Ensignal, Bath Farms, Bellendir Tire, Blake Electric, Brush Cleaners, Club Tap, Don’s Diesel, Fort Morgan Auto Body, Fort Morgan Area Chamber of Commerce, Fort Morgan State Bank, Kay Jan Inc., Korf Continental, LAN Wrangler, Mavericks, Mega Music, Morgan Community College, Morgan County Tourism Panel, Morgan County Rural Electric Association, Morgan County Economic Development Corporation, Morgan County REA, SOS Staffing, Tio Charlie’s, Wal-Mart, Wells Fargo Bank and WTC Feed.\n\nSaturday’s schedule includes:\n\nMain stage, 11-11:30 a.m. — “As Of Late,” local punk band.\n\nSecond Stage, 11:30 a.m.-12:15 p.m. — ”Tommy Gun Geisha,” young rock band from Monticello, Ill.\n\nMain Stage, 12:15-1 p.m. — “The 4-40 Band,” local variety rock.\n\nSecond Stage, 1 p.m. — “Black to White,” rock duo from Sterling.\n\nMain Stage, 2 p.m. — “Penchant,” tribute to Led Zeppelin and more.\n\nSecond stage, 3 p.m. — Unleashed,” local classic rock.\n\nMain Stage, 4 p.m. — “Juke Joint Cruisers,” rockabilly.\n\nSecond stage, 5 p.m. — “Bittersweet,” local classic rock.\n\nMain stage, 6 p.m. — “Synthetic Elements,” ska music.\n\nMain stage, 7 p.m. — “Subrosa Union,” alternative power rock trio.\n\nMain stage, 8 p.m. — Headliner “Tommy Tutone,” famous from the ’80s for “867-5309 (Jenny).”\n\nSunday’s lineup includes:\n\n10-11 a.m. — Jimmy Kernodle.\n\n11 a.m.-noon — Church of God of Prophecy.\n\nNoon-1 p.m. — Christ Congregational Church.\n\n1:30-2:30 p.m. — Unleashed.\n\n3-4 p.m. — Bob Duffield.\n\n— Contact John La Porte at news@fmtimes.com.\n\nOriginally Published: July 2, 2009 at 2:41 p.m."
