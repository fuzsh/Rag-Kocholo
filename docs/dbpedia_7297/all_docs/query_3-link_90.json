        "text": "ON THE LOT\n\n1922\n\nComedian Harold Lloyd leaves Hal Roach Studios and moves to Jasper's lot with his entourage. In May, Fred Newmeyer directs Grandma's Boys. Later in the decade he teams with screenwriter Sam Taylor to direct Girl Shy, Hot Water, and The Freshman. Alone, Taylor directs For Heaven's Sake in 1926.\n\n1923-25\n\nThe studio changes hands once, when it's bought by some LA businessmen in 1923 and then again in 1924 when B. P. Schulberg, the producer who discovered Clara Bow, buys a controlling interest in the studio for Preferred Pictures Corp. In January 1925 , the studio is flipped over a third time when John Jasper leaves and Al and Charles Christie, producers of the Christie Comedies and owners of the Christies Film Corporation, buy the lot. Toberman takes with him the frontage on Santa Monica Boulevard and the studio entrance is moved to the Las Palmas side. William Sistrom, formerly a production manager at Universal City, is named the new manager.\n\n1925\n\nAfter being talked into making a picture by a movie star acquaintance, the restless millionaire, Howard Hughes leaves the management of the family oil drilling business to his financial advisers and makes himself president of Cado Pictures. An unsalvageable disaster, Swell Hogan doubles in budget and is never released, but Hughes, the producer, has bought himself a film school education on real sets. Lewis Milestone, sells him on his next picture the nine-reel Two Arabian Knights in 1927. (Milestone won his first best director Oscar for the picture; today he's perhaps most famous for the Rat Pack Vegas caper movie Ocean's Eleven.)\n\nDuring the summer or '26, Metropolitan's executives hear the sound of the future and, yes, it involved audio. They break ground on the Metropolitan Sound Stages. It is the introduction of sound that converts filmmaking to an indoor activity--audio requires packing production into a soundstage where recording levels and acoustics could be better controlled. By 1929, Stages 1 and 2 are being outfitted with Vitaphone equipment and the Las Palmas lot is renamed Metropolitan Sound Studio.\n\nWhile Harold Lloyd plays handball in a garage on the lot, Howard Hughes goes from dilettante producer to wannabe auteur. He cans two directors and takes over the helm of the WWI dogfight film Hell's Angels , part of which is shot at GSS. Enamored as much with audio as with aviation, Hughes reshoots with sound for many sequences and fires his leading lady and replaces her with Jean Harlow, who makes her screen debut.\n\nON THE LOT\n\n1940\n\nAt the peak of their creative golden age, United Artists leases General Service studio for their producers, Alexander Korda and Benedict Bogeaus. Korda, came to the US from war-torn Britain, with the reels of The Four Feathers as collateral against which he raises nearly $4 million for the production of six pictures (four to be made in the States). Korda edits The Thief of Bagdhad on the lot and goes on to direct Laurence Olivier and Vivian Leigh in That Hamilton Woman. Writer Gore Vidal remembers the film, a glorification of war, in Palimpsest: ..the film was made..to glorify resistance to a predator-tyrant like Hitler. British propaganda in the thirties and forties was most effectively deployed in Hollywood films so that the American people would be emotionally ready to fight, yet again, with England against Germany.\" Later Korda produces Lydia and Jungle Book.\n\nBy '42 Korda and other high-profile producers had left, precipitating a downward slide in UA's slate that continues unchecked until 1950.\n\nFor the next four years, there are only a few producers working on the lot. The very popular RKO actress Constance Bennett and UA are among the most active. Expat Jean Renoir directs The Southerner for David Loew in 1945 and the Marx Brothers star in A Night in Casablanca the following year. By March 0f 1946, Bogeaus is back. He reorganizes his company, acquiring the land and all of the buildings of the studio. By May, he begins a $500,000 construction program of television sound stages.\n\nIn July, William Cagney (brother and partner of Jimmy) purchases a substantial interest in the studio. Bogeaus aligns his production company with Cagney Productions which moves into 1040 N. Las Palmas. (Charles is president, Jimmy is vice president, and Edward serves as secretary.) Blood on the Sun (1945) and The Time of Your Life (1948) are both made on the lot. It's not a long stay, the Cagneys decamp to Warner Bros., their distributor, in 1949.\n\n1948\n\nAnother trio of brothers Jimmy, George, and Ted Nasser, managers for Bogeaus/Cagney buy into the studio. By 1950 they own it outright. They zero-in on the niche of television which the majors reject after being barred from entering the new medium by a monopoly-wary FCC. Because they can't join 'em, the studios are forced into a beat 'em mentality. Seeing only competition from television, they bar it from their lots. As television was passing from its live era in New York, to its prerecorded form in LA, the Nassers capture a windfall of new business. Burns and Allen moves in during the early fifties (George Burns was a tenant until March 1996 when he died at 100 years-old).\n\nAt this time, there is only other place in LA to produce television, Hal Roach Studios. TV at the turn-of-the-decade is really in the hands of advertising agencies and sponsors, it's not until the 50's that the networks take control of programming, largely through deals with independent producers.\n\nON THE LOT\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola takes over the lot March 14, 1980, intending to film a slate of his own pictures there. Zoetrope produces Hammett, One From the Heart, The Outsiders, The Black Stallion Returns, Rumblefish, and The Escape Artist.\n\nIronically it's One From the Heart, an elaborate modern musical that pushes the studio into financial difficulty. The budget escalates on the picture largely due to the creation of lush period sets within the studios' sound stages. In 1984, the studio is acquired by the Singer family, Canadian real estate developers.\n\nON THE LOT\n\nStudio Management Services, headed by Tim Mahoney, moves quickly to renovate the entire facility and within a year, all eight sound stages are revitalized. Office space is redone to house a community of new tenants. The stages are marketed to commercial spot producers, independent feature film producers, and the music industry, which uses the stages for rehearsal. A new rock & roll client base starts shooting music videos and specials, including artists Stevie Wonder, Lionel Richie, Crosby, Stills & Nash, Jackson Browne, Michael Jackson, Prince, and Ray Charles.\n\nAlso during this period, the eighties classics Body Heat and When Harry Met Sally shoot on the lot.\n\nON THE LOT\n\nToday the lot is a creative neighborhood that is home to TV series, commercial production companies, production support, special effects and post outfits and new media operations. And if you've heard the HCS referred to as \"being wired,\" it's because you can jack into the vanguard of new digital production services here. Review storyboards, edits, or casting sessions from other cities, or set up digital video conferences.\n\nHollywood Center Studios taps into the digital revolution in 1995, when Alan Singer and Tim Mahoney start to lay the infrastructure for the most advanced sound stage facilities in Hollywood by wiring the studios with the bandwidth necessary to carry high-quality digital images and sound around the lot.\n\nThis decade has seen the production of Robert Altman's instant classic Hollywood satire The Player, many TV shows, and hundreds of commercials."
