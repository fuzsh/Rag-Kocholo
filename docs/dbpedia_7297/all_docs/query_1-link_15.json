        "text": "Art lovers around the world have come to appreciate the wonders of world-class street art. Whereas street art was once looked down upon, back when it was commonly known as graffiti and viewed as a nuisance, it has now become a desireable art form. In New York and elsewhere, street art has become an attraction as a host of cities offer their own developed street art trails for visitors to explore. More and more cities are encouraging famous street artists to visit and leave their mark as a way to breathe new life into forgotten neighborhoods. And of course some of the art world’s biggest names (with the auction prices to match) now come from the world of street art. But that doesn’t mean these masters’ best works can only be found at museums and in private collections, as countless incredible works remain on display in their natural settings, out in the public domain.\n\nUnlike other forms of art, street art often results from unpredictable conditions and improvised workspaces, making it all the more impressive. This partially explains why some of the planet’s most esteemed museums and institutions have hosted career retrospectives by some of the street art world’s biggest names. However, given the fleeting nature of street art, it’s hard to be confident that these works will stand the test of time and last forever. So get out there, get inspired and pay your respects to these famous street artists. Who knows, after being captivated by such mind-blowing work, you may find yourself itching to try your hand at developing your own tag or decorating that empty wall with a cheeky mural."
