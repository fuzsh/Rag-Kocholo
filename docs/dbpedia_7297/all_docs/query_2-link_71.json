        "text": "After 20 years of serving clients, governments, agencies and nonprofits as a consultant across the interactive, immersive & generative media strategic landscape, I'm working on a new endeavor that I'm excited to share with you. Realitycraft, my gallery for new concept development includes R&D into #AIagents #digitaltwins #worldbuilding #smerf #splats #3dart and research into new methods of mediamaking. You can hire me by the day, week or month to work with your team and help you get ahead of these emerging fields and how they'll impact your work. **Here's a bit of how we can help your teams:** * Last year I consulted an immersive XR film team working on a new feature, teaching them generative media and promptcraft skills to make new worlds * Our research into 3D creative spaces includes the natural world and art mixed with AI agents, Digital Twins and using the best of the web continues with Metaverse Standards Forum (our panel from this month's CES is at https://lnkd.in/gwHfczqy and was featured in news such as https://lnkd.in/gFam6Zdr * I gave over 20 talks last year on the future convergences coming in generative, immersive and interactive media and how your teams can work with these new capacities for ethical and appropriate design in your field. If you need talks or workshops, get in touch directly for 2024 bookings. I consult funds, agencies, organizations, companies and artists directly. * Last year we generated over 60,000 written elements, images and videos, art and media assets with and for clients in a wide variety of fields from nonprofits and cultural festivals to leaders in supreme courts and international organizations addressing injustice, equity and policy for technology * Consulting for media and technology companies, our work spans from smartglasses, spatial web and XR to the live and interactive prototyping we do with media networks and streaming media providers.

Instead of just using AI to automate processes, I see and use it as a source of collaboration. It's like having an extension of my mind that helps me explore new ideas and research. This technological integration not only makes my work easier, but I also believe it puts me at the forefront of the contemporary art scene, where innovation and experimentation are key. A SINGULAR MOMENT OF YOUR CAREER? - I believe it was in 2021 when I was in charge of creative coordination at BRIFW and I was dealing with AR JAM project, to bring together the experience of programmers and artists in multidisciplinary teams to exhibit works in augmented reality at SP-ARTE. [...] And last year, when I held my first exhibition at BRIFW & Wired Conference with the works resulting from this dive. HOW HAS TECHNOLOGY CHANGED YOUR LIFE? - I started to delve deeper into this relationship between humans, nature and the digital, where borders become blurred and ideas flow freely. Me, who was completely analogue, was observing the process of technology and tools, and trying to make the connection between everyday life, observation, the photographs I take in my daily life with a more attentive and detailed look at something that goes unnoticed [...] WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS FOR YOUR PROFESSIONAL FUTURE? - Create more.

It enables artists to push past traditional boundaries, explore new mediums, and involve audiences in immersive experiences that blend the physical and virtual realms. Digital tools have transformed the artistic process, offering artists a wide range of new possibilities. From virtual reality sculpting to AI-generated imagery, technology has broadened the creative palette, allowing artists to delve into uncharted realms of expression. Technology has sparked the growth of interactive and immersive art forms, encouraging audiences to interact with artworks in fresh and dynamic ways. Interactive installations respond to viewer input, creating a participatory experience that blurs the line between observer and participant. Virtual and augmented reality technologies transport viewers into immersive environments, providing multi-sensory experiences that transcend physical limitations. Technology has also given rise to entirely new mediums and artistic expressions. Digital painting, generative art, and data visualization have emerged as distinct art forms, challenging traditional notions of art. These new mediums have provided artists with avenues to explore concepts of identity, perception, and the nature of reality. In terms of accessibility, technology has made art more accessible to a broader audience, breaking down geographical barriers through online galleries and virtual exhibitions. Social media platforms have empowered artists to directly connect with audiences, fostering a sense of community and shared appreciation. While technology offers incredible opportunities, it also presents challenges. Concerns about authenticity, ownership, and the preservation of digital art require careful consideration. Additionally, the rapid pace of technological advancement can create a gap between those with access to the latest tools and those without. Technology's impact on the creation and consumption of art is significant and multi-faceted. It has expanded the boundaries of artistic expression, giving rise to new forms of engagement, and made art more accessible than ever before. As technology continues to evolve, it will undoubtedly continue to shape the future of art, offering both challenges and opportunities for artists and audiences alike.\n\nüöÄ Exciting Announcement üöÄ On Tuesday, 13th February 2024, The Art of Law is honored to host a very special guest ‚Äì Atif Nasim, the visionary CEO and founder of Immersive Horizons.

Turns out, a lot more than you think. When building Embodied Labs, our founders discovered that using a first person perspective, and interactive, immersive storytelling could actually bring humans closer together. A topic our own CEO, Carrie Shaw brought to the audience during her keynote speech last week at the National Memory Care Symposium. When we look at the numbers of those affected by conditions across the aging care continuum, one thing becomes clear ‚Äì the need for empathetic, humanized care and the training mechanisms to assist that. In Embodied Labs case, our platform brings care providers closer to the person whose care they are supporting ‚Äì whether in a professional, or a home care environment, by leveraging VR or web technology for training. These experiences put the provider in the prospective patients shoes, giving them a first hand view of what it feels like to have conditions like Alzheimer‚Äôs, dementia or macular degeneration. The outcome? ‚Ü≥ 75% higher retention of information ‚Ü≥ 3.75x more emotionally connected ‚Ü≥ Reduced burnout, errors, and turnover in staff ‚Ü≥ Better quality of care As a team who is passionate about creating a world that we ourselves want to age into, bridging the gap between technology and human connection in care will always remain front and center. A huge thank you to LeadingAge Maryland and LifeSpan Network for including our team at the National Memory Care Symposium last week. It‚Äôs always an honor to be a part of reshaping the picture of memory care."
