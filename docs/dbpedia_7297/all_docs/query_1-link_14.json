        "text": "OZARK - Art was the heart of Howard Garrison’s life.\n\nThose who knew him are quick to speak to that in a literal sense, sharing the paintings he created of people and places, and with such passion and perfectionism that he wouldn't sign pieces that didn’t fully please him.\n\nIn the minds of many Ozarkers, however, his work wasn’t limited to beauty for the eyes: He also created a living expression of art through his Riverside Inn, a restaurant on the outskirts of Ozark that became iconic for generations as “the” place to go. He painted many surfaces in the restaurant, but the experience he created helped hearts, minds and memories leave so satisfied that, even today, people hunger for another serving.\n\n“He was always thinking in terms of being an artist,” says Bil Tatum, a local journalist who worked at Riverside Inn in various capacities over an approximately 30-year period. “And the way he ran Riverside, the way he decorated Riverside, the way he required the food at Riverside to look good and the people to conduct themselves with class. He wanted Riverside to be known as not just a restaurant, but as a destination, a place where people went to enjoy themselves, have a good time, to be taken care of and feel like they were special because they were in a special place.”\n\nMore than 50 years have passed since its founder’s death, and facts are starting to fade.\n\nThere are, of course, bullet points that remain of the restaurateur who was often styled in a plaid shirt and with a cigar in his mouth. He was an excellent cook. He liked expensive cars, but not for the cachet, and he drove them at extremely slow speeds. He donated sections of land for Ozark’s public library. He was deeply kind – when he wanted to be.\n\n“I refer to him as my guardian angel,” says Phil Garrison, Howard’s nephew. “He was a very, very independent person who did things his own way. And he came across as very gruff to some people. Despite hosting generations night after night, he didn’t particularly enjoy interacting with people. And beneath all that there was a gentleness and kindness that showed through the various ways.”\n\nThe backstory\n\nDespite his artistic flair, even Howard likely couldn’t have imagined what he was to create as he stood fishing on the banks of the Finley River around a century ago. There, the 20-something man saw an image in his mind’s eye.\n\n“I thought how beautiful this place was, right here on the bend of the river and how much I would love to have some of my mother’s good fried chicken, and decided right then I would build the restaurant,” he recounted in a 1973 Sunday News and Leader article.\n\nHoward’s roots are in Christian County. He grew up around Billings, a little town better than 20 miles away from where the inn would later be built.\n\nIt was clear that, even from a young age, Howard was not bound by conventionality. According to one article, he didn’t graduate from high school, and disappeared when he was 17. There was a period of his life when he simply was gone, and it wasn’t clear where he went.\n\nBut when he came back, that fateful day along the river showed him the largest art project of his life.\n\n“In 1922 Howard Garrison, a native of Billings, Mo., with an abiding desire to paint, decided to open a restaurant,” noted an article in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch from 1959. “Realistic enough to know that he couldn't live on art alone, he asked only that the restaurant provide for his simple needs.”\n\nHoward and his father, Landon Garrison, worked for a year to clear the land and build the first restaurant.\n\nLocated outside Ozark, it was originally known as Blue Moon, and the small wooden structure held around 30 people. There was a Coca-Cola sign out front, but it really didn’t do anything to stop traffic. If you were there, you intended to be.\n\n“It was the era of winding dirt roads that were dusty in summer and muddy in winter. Travel was slow and short distances were long,” noted the Post-Dispatch. “To build a restaurant that could serve 40 persons on a back road a mile from Ozarks and 16 miles from Springfield was regarded as foolish. Even sillier was to make it a chicken-dinner place when frying-size chickens were seasonal.”\n\nBut when was that very first day when history was made? Pull the lever and see what you get.\n\nWithin a few short years, those descriptors changed: Riverside became a place touted as “Bohemian,” glamorous, and characterized by liquor-fueled parties that went into the night.\n\n“Parties often brought their own music to Riverside and all would dance to strains of banjos, guitars and ukeleles strummed by those who came as guests,” noted pages in the Springfield Leader in 1929. “At Riverside, saleswomen often called society matrons by their first names and shop girls laughed in the faces of ‘big business men’ with whom they danced. ‘The best people’ might easily be found chatting at some table with men and women who were bootleggers and their sweeties.”\n\nWhile the off-the-path place was perhaps frequented because of those things, rather than in spite of them, they were an issue for the law. The United States was in the depths of Prohibition, which outlawed the manufacture, transportation and sale of intoxicating liquor between 1920 and 1933.\n\nWho knows how, why or when gambling and liquor made their way to Riverside. Perhaps it was due to pressure a 20-something Howard experienced– either to satisfy customers, or simply to survive.\n\n“We do what we have to do to get by ‘til tomorrow,” he said in a news article near the end of his life. “Paint a little, lie a little, gamble a little, sell a little booze. Anything to keep going.”\n\nThe wrong side of the law\n\nThose decisions caught up with Howard in 1929. That year, he was arrested twice for activities at Riverside. The first was in February, as a result of him operating a slot machine, and for which he was sentenced to a year in jail but was released on parole.\n\nLess than a month later – on March 6, 1929 – there was a much more significant moment when Riverside was raided by a number of government officers, as well as U.S. District Attorney W.L. Vandeventer, and Narcotic Agents Lulu La Roche and W.O. McDonald.\n\nAs a result of the arrest – and Howard’s claims that he “couldn’t remember” the names of those he worked with in liquor traffic – the restaurateur was sent to prison for two years.\n\nRiverside had a rocky go while Howard was away. In June 1929, it was ordered “padlocked” for a year. News articles share it being leased more than once, but none of the efforts lasted. As a 1930 Ozark newspaper put it, the inn was “equally famous for its chicken dinners and its inability to stay in business.”\n\nBut as time ticked to the next year, Howard came back.\n\n“No one else has been able to make a success of Riverside Inn, perhaps because they do not know the art of entertaining as well as Howard Garrison does,” printed a Springfield Leader article in 1931. “Windows which for months have been dark and empty again are bright patches against the night, and the sound of laughing voices tells the passerby of old patrons who have returned happily to Riverside with the revival of the old regime.”\n\nTwo years later, Prohibition was repealed. That, however, didn’t affect Riverside’s distribution of alcohol. Because of his felony conviction for bootlegging, Howard was forever unable to obtain a license to sell liquor.\n\nBut there was always alcohol — “and it was generously shared,” says Elise Crain, who grew up in Christian County and whose memories of Riverside go back to the 1950s.\n\nInstead of drinks, Garrison sold “set-ups,” she says, which were buckets of ice and glasses. Then patrons brought their own alcohol.\n\n“My husband worked at Collins Market, and on Saturday night or sometimes on Friday, Howard would show up and he would need 1,000 pounds of crushed ice,” says Mary Adams of Ozark. “He had the buckets and Dean would go into the ice house, by hand, and turn out 1,000 pounds of crushed ice.”\n\nIf Dean was allowed to make the delivery himself, it was even better: He was given a bag of fried chicken for his effort, Adams says.\n\nThe person who gave him that chicken was Mary Ellen Marley, a Black woman who Howard hired as cook when he opened the restaurant.\n\nKey faces\n\nHoward was understandably and justifiably the icon of Riverside, but there were other individuals who helped make it a success — one of which is the aforementioned Mary Ellen.\n\nWhile Howard is remembered as good in the kitchen, it was Mary Ellen’s hands that cooked Riverside’s famous fried chicken for many years. And, in Riverside’s early days, just the two of them ran the restaurant.\n\nIt’s unclear how Howard and Mary Ellen became connected. She was born in Iowa in 1869, but moved to Christian County relatively early in her life, and it’s said she was raised on a farm near where Ozark’s North Elementary stands today.\n\nA vocalist praised for her ability to sing spirituals, Mary Ellen was hired to cook at local parties before she came to Riverside. During one of the restaurant’s historic floods, she was carried to safety by the aforementioned Gratz Anderson. She was there on that fateful night in 1929 when the feds arrived – and was arrested after being found pouring liquor down the drain in the kitchen. And, each time when Riverside reopened, she was there to cook the food.\n\nIn addition to Mary Ellen, another key figure was Jack Engel. Many today remember Jack, who joined the restaurant as a dishwasher and worked his way up to the leadership position by the early 1940s. Known for being a very sharp dresser, and someone who brought even more advancement to the restaurant in later years, Engel bought Riverside in 1970 and sold it to Eric Engel, his son, a few years later.\n\n“They kind of had a love-hate relationship,” says Eric Engel, who grew up in the restaurant. “Dad was good for Howard. And sometimes Howard didn't see things, you know, Dad's way, and stuff. So they were always kind of biting each other.”\n\nHe gives an example of an intercom system that his father installed to play dinner music through the restaurant. One evening, Howard was trying to talk to the cook, who couldn’t hear him well over the music — so he went and got a pair of pliers and cut the connection.\n\nChanges during WWII\n\nAs the world made changes during World War II, so did Riverside. Rationing of gasoline and tires forced a bit of creativity: Instead of customers — who often were from Springfield — coming all the way to Riverside, Howard decided to go to them.\n\n“Tire rationing has resulted in our coming to Springfield in order to maintain contact with our patrons,” Howard said in a Springfield paper’s pages.\n\nIn 1942, he opened a second restaurant: Called the Town House, the establishment was located in Springfield in the “old Milligan mansion,” the paper noted, on St. Louis Street next door to the Shrine Mosque.\n\nBy the 1950s, the team, tempo and tone had shifted once again at Riverside. It was solidly the “supper club” era, and a place where people would go out and stay all evening.\n\nPerhaps the Town House introduced even more guests to Riverside who made the trek to Ozark when the Springfield restaurant closed in the early 1950s.\n\n“People came there and spent the evening. I mean, they would get there at six or seven o'clock and wouldn't leave until 10 or 11. It was not a place where you would come and eat dinner and leave and be gone in an hour,” says Garrison. “And it was unique in that way. It was really ‘the’ place for a long time.”\n\nThat it was “the” place to go was also evident through milestone events: weddings, anniversaries, proms, retirement parties and more were long held within its ever-expanding walls and sprawling patio, which eventually could accommodate hundreds of guests – and new places to paint.\n\n“Garrison is always on the go, finishing a new dining room or parlor, planning a new one and redecorating an old one,” noted the Post-Dispatch article from this period. “He does the intricate ornamental work that frames archways and windows. He always uses fresh-cut flowers for table decorations, grown in gardens which he tends himself or in his greenhouse. He says he likes to consider himself an artist first and a restaurateur second.”\n\nThe aforementioned Gratz Anderson and family were frequent guests at Riverside during this period.\n\n“It really became a place where you'd go for special events because there weren't too many places in our area for them,” says Jim Anderson, Gratz’s son. “And he had all kinds of different rooms that had different themes. And that was part of it, too. You know, the artwork was different in every area that he did.”\n\nAnderson’s parents were part of a group of friends who regularly ate at Riverside, but their children were often guests at the restaurant, too.\n\nThe Anderson family owned a hardware store in town, and would swap credit at the store for meals at the restaurant from time to time – or Howard would use his art in exchange for purchases. Anderson points to a painting at his home, showing a log cabin, which was traded to his parents in exchange for a bill Howard owed them.\n\n“He always had a pretty good account at the hardware store,” says Anderson. “And many times we would work out what he owed us by going reverse.”\n\nSupport was seen for Howard and the restaurant in other ways, such the times when the Finley defied the restaurant’s name and became much closer than Riverside.\n\n“When it would flood, we would all bundle up and go out there and use a hose and scrub brush and scrub the walls and scrub the floors,” says Crain.\n\n“It was a community event,” adds Adams.\n\nGarrison also notes the times when Howard would let local civic clubs use rooms for meetings, and give meals very cheaply as a thank you for helping clean up the restaurant when it flooded.\n\nHoward the person\n\nRiverside’s founder was consistently at the restaurant every day for decades, often holding court from a table in the kitchen. But, even though he was visible there, he was not truly seen by many.\n\n“Howard was not a person who was going to tell you his inner thoughts, unless he was mad at you,” says Garrison of his uncle. “He did not reveal his inner self.”\n\nHoward was not known as being particularly outgoing or friendly, and his relationships were seemingly limited. Aside from a brief marriage in the late 1940s or early ‘50s to a woman named Nadine, he seemingly remained single, and he had no children.\n\n“Howard is a very hard person to accurately describe, and that’s because of his gruffness and the fact that he didn’t associate with people very much,” says Garrison. “I think that’s given people the wrong impression of Howard over the years.”\n\nOne example is shared by Crain from the mid-’60s, when her mother was recuperating from some health challenges.\n\n“Howard saw her in the post office, and he said, ‘Oh, Helen, I am so glad to see you. I heard you were sick and I didn’t have time to go to any god-damn funeral,’” recalls her daughter. “That’s a quote.”\n\nAnother moment of his personality was evident the night the cast from the famed Ozark Jubilee TV program came to Riverside after the show, bringing along New York syndicated columnist Earl Wilson. Red Foley, star of the Jubilee, hoped to introduce the writer to the restauranteur.\n\n“Howard had already gone to bed, so Red goes to the foot of the stairs and yells up to his apartment, ‘There’s a man here that wants to see you,’” recounts Garrison. “Howard says, ‘Who is it?’ Red says, ‘It’s Earl Wilson.’ ‘Who the hell is Earl Wilson?’ ‘He’s a syndicated columnist from New York.’ Howard says, ‘You tell him if he wants to see me, come back tomorrow.’”\n\nStill, examples of Howard’s kindness shone through.\n\n“Beneath all that, there was a gentleness and kindness that showed through various ways,” continues his nephew, speaking of people who worked for him at Riverside. “For instance, if some of their family was in need, or having tough times, he would often send food home with them. Just to help them get by.”\n\nEngel also saw the same side of Howard, whom he wasn’t related to but thought of as an uncle.\n\n“He's always kind to me. I mean, really kind,” says Engel, who notes that Howard paid for a semester of his college. He also recalls Howard’s soft spot for animals.\n\n“He loved his cattle,” he continues. “He’d drive his Cadillac or his old Chrysler out in the field. He’d get out and walk up to some bull. One bull was Alfonso, and (he’d ask) ‘How’s Alfonso today?’”\n\nHe was good friends with Lucile Anderson, the founder of the current iteration of the Christian County Library in Ozark. In the early 1970s, he donated two sections of land where the library stands today.\n\n“He was kind in all the ways that matter,” says Tatum, the former employee and newsman. “I think he had a gruff exterior, especially in his later years.\n\n“He would give people a break when they needed a break. And yeah, he was tough too; he was a tough businessman. He was tough to work for at the restaurant sometimes. I never experienced that myself, but I certainly have heard stories about how demanding he could be. So you know, there was that too, but he was a good person.”\n\nIt’s just one example, but one that perhaps points to a value of friendship or loyalty or both: When he died, Howard was buried next to Mary Ellen, his former cook.\n\n“Mary Ellen's headstone is a very nice headstone in the Ozark Cemetery,” says Garrison. “I suspect that Howard installed that.”\n\nIn perhaps a sad sign of the times, however, Mary Ellen’s death certificate said nothing about her legacy at Riverside. It simply said she was a housewife.\n\nPainting a common theme\n\nAbove all else in his life, Howard loved to paint. It was a passion that went far beyond his time in jail – where some say it started – and began when he was a child. At around 5 years old, a woman named Bessie Bedford told him he was talented. Perhaps she was a teacher of his, as from newspapers, that appears to have been her vocation.\n\nThat was enough.\n\nThe comment grew into a love that would last the rest of his life.\n\n“I found I could paint after learning I couldn't play the piano,” he said in a 1970 Daily News article. “I wanted to play the instrument all the time.”\n\nAs with other details of Howard’s life, information about his professional art training is a bit unclear. An article in Springfield! Magazine, printed after Howard’s death, said that he took a correspondence art course, which was later followed by two years of art study at Washington University.\n\nRegardless of what study he did or didn’t have, his formal art education was limited. He painted what he saw – both literally, and in his mind. Landscapes and still life imagery showing flowers and people he knew. And, of course, at Riverside, where as mentioned many surfaces bore his artistic touch.\n\n“I think for him in particular, there's such a connection to place, not only because he was living and working here, but because of how he incorporated art into the Riverside Inn, which that to me is pretty unique,” says Sarah Buhr, curator of art at the Springfield Art Museum.\n\n“I cannot think of another restaurant where the restaurateur also decorated … all the surfaces. So the idea of, you know, all of the people in this town and in the surrounding areas that ate at that restaurant, year after year after year, and then also were surrounded by his artwork and his decorations. That's a really unique story and something very unique to this area.”\n\nFrom a professional perspective, Buhr says that Howard did not adhere to specific styles of the day, which by the ‘60s were moving into a more abstract expressionism.\n\n“Certainly like the art world capital A, this would have looked very kitschy to them and they would have said, ‘Oh, that's that's old fashioned,’” says Buhr.\n\nThat reality, however, does not change the fact that Howard’s work is important to preserve for the future, she says.\n\n“I think in terms of that nature of the experience, it's really important to still keep his work around, especially since the building's gone now,” she says. “So you can't experience that anymore. But you can still get an idea of what it might have looked like by the pieces that still remain and that are in our collection and in private collections, to kind of hopefully provide a link to that story that still exists.”\n\nLooking back at life\n\nIf the stories of Riverside and Howard say anything in between the lines, it’s that norms or what was conventionally popular was not especially important. That sentiment was reinforced by the 1973 Sunday News and Leader article, which was titled “I do as I please.”\n\nIt touched on the sale of Riverside to Jack Engel, which occurred in 1970. He was the only person, Howard said in a news article, to whom he would have considered selling the business.\n\n“I wanted someone to have it who would love it as much as I did and do, and Jack is the only person I know of who fills that bill,” he said through the newspaper page.\n\nThe Sunday paper feature is seemingly the most comprehensive piece done about Howard and his life. It was based on six hours of interviews with him at his McCracken studio, where he moved upon the sale of Riverside. It featured photos by the famed News-Leader photographer Betty Love, and was written by the aforementioned Bil Tatum, who then was a young reporter for Springfield Newspapers.\n\n“Howard was not shy,” says Tatum. “He was not shy about, you know, attention or publicity and had never been, so he was more than willing to go along with me on (an article).”\n\nIt wasn’t Tatum’s first encounter with Howard. Tatum – whose wife, Julie, was Jack Engel’s step-daughter – began working at Riverside around 1970 when he began serving at holiday events. That connection gave him exposure to Howard, and a desire to share his story.\n\n“I wanted to do something about Howard because, as an artist, I felt like he was somebody who needed more attention than maybe he’d gotten,” the writer says.\n\nA frame containing the news page of his final interview hangs on the wall. Even though both friends are gone, their legacies continue in the ways they lived.\n\n“The restaurant’s gone, even though it's still very much alive in my imagination, and a lot of other people who have spent years and years and years working there and being around the place,” says Tatum. “But the art, the art is still there. It's in collections all over southwest Missouri. It's in art museums. And I just hope that his reputation, and what he accomplished there as an artist, isn't forgotten.\n\n“That's what I hope people remember about him: That he was he was creative, and his work had substance. You know, it wasn't just it wasn't just imagery. And if you look at his work, you can see he was a man of incredible scale and feeling.”\n\nEpilogue\n\nNearly five decades have passed since Howard’s death. Riverside Inn had a much longer story: It only closed in 2009, after years of repeated flooding led its then-owners to ask FEMA to buy the property. The sale was approved, and Riverside was torn down.\n\nToday, all that physically remains to speak of the restaurant is a sign noting “Riverside Inn Park” near where the sprawling building used to stand.\n\nMemories, however, remain and remind. One example is Riverside Bridge, which in 2021 was moved to Finley Farms in Ozark. Another soon-to-come tie is through The Garrison, a new destination also at Finley Farms that is set to open in the coming months.\n\nThe speakeasy-style stop will serve food and drinks in a place of “rustic opulence” that speaks to Riverside Inn and The Ozark Mill, the latter which The Garrison is tucked beneath. (Stay tuned for more info about The Garrison in the coming weeks.)\n\nHoward’s art — sourced from his family members, the Christian County Library and the Christian County Historical Society — will be a key focus of the space, which will also feature his paint palette, as well as a fireplace and large ornate mirror original to the Riverside Inn, says Dayle Duggins, marketing manager for Finley Farms.\n\n“Howard Garrison really embodies the spirit of the Ozarks with his rebellious attitude, creativity and genial hospitality,” says Duggins. “We are saddened that this landmark is no longer a part of our community, but being only a mile down river, we are thrilled to be able to honor that legacy and offer the community a new place to make special memories on the Finley River.”\n\nThe creation of this article is funded by a collaboration between Ozarks Alive and Finley Farms.\n\nResources\n\n“Bootlegger shields ‘rum kings’!” Springfield Leader, April 5, 1929\n\n“Down by the Riverside,” Jamie Cox, OzarksWatch Magazine, 1996\n\n“Gaming charges planned on pair,” Springfield Daily News, Aug. 9, 1943\n\n“Garrison to open new dining spot, he says,” Springfield Leader and Press, April 1, 1942\n\n“Founder of Riverside now busy with art,” Mike Sears, Springfield Daily News, Nov. 21, 1970\n\n“I do as a please,” Bil Tatum, Sunday News and Leader, Feb. 18, 1973\n\n“I paint because I can’t help it,” Bil Tatum, Springfield Leader & Press, June 28, 1974\n\n“Interest in art finds expression in thriving inn near Ozark, Mo.,” St. Louis Post-Dispatch, April 10, 1959\n\n“Library to leave livery stable,” Springfield Daily News, Feb. 7, 1972\n\n“Padlocks for raided rum joints,” Springfield Leader, March 7, 1929\n\n“The rich history of Riverside,” Kaitlyn McConnell, Ozarks Alive, May 26, 2016\n\n“Riverside builder’s funeral on Friday,” Springfield Leader & Press, June 28, 1974\n\n“Riverside gleams again,” Springfield Leader, April 29, 1931\n\n“Riverside Inn emerges from beginnings as embattled rebel artist’s speakeasy,” Edgar A.
