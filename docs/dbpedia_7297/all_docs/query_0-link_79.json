They are pioneering digital apps that are emotion-based for entertainment, enterprise, video communication and online education.\n\nRana earned her PhD from Cambridge University, after which she joined as a research scientist at MIT media labs. She was instrumental in the application of emotion recognition technology in a number of different fields, including mental health. She quit MIT to co-found Affectiva, which is a pioneer in the field of Emotion AI. As an AI leader in the domain, it now works with 25% of the Fortune 500 companies.\n\nForbes named Rana in their list of America’s Top 50 Women in Tech while she was included in the list of 40 under 40 by Fortune. Rana speaks frequently on the topic of ethics in Artificial intelligence and overcoming biases. Her mission is to integrate artificial emotional intelligence to ‘humanize technology’ and develop deep learning platforms for various aspects of emotions such as facial expressions and tone of voice to understand how users are feeling.\n\n12. Daphne Koller\n\nCo-Founder of Coursera, Founder and CEO of insitro.\n\nWebsite: https://ai.stanford.edu/~koller, Twitter: @DaphneKoller, Google Scholar.\n\nDaphne is a computer scientist and a professor in the Department of Computer Science at Stanford University. She is most popularly known as the co-founder of Coursers, the world’s largest MOOC platform. Her primary research area is artificial intelligence and its application in biomedical sciences. Her work focuses on concepts such as decision making, inference learning and representation in applications pertaining to computer vision and computational biology.\n\nDaphne launched Coursera together with Andrew Ng in 2012, in which she served as co-CEO along with Ng. She then took up a role as President of Coursera and was recognized as Time magazine’s 100 most influential people in 2012. In 2014 she was also on the Fast Company’s Most Creative People 2014. In 2016 she left Coursera to become the chief computing officer at Calico. She later moved on in 2018 to start Insitro, which is a drug discovery startup. In 2009 she co-authored a textbook on probabilistic graphical models. She later offered the subject as a free online course in February of 2012.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile this list doesn’t encompass the tremendous contributions of other giants in the field, it is sorted on the basis of the Twitter followers these leaders have online. With that said, there is much depth to be explored in the contributions of these 12 AI leaders, who also happen to have a lot of overlap in their research, work and interactions."
