        "text": "Teddy Roosevelt Arrives at the Wawona Hotel, 1903\n\nPresident Teddy Theodore Roosevelt arrived to Yosemite’s Wawona Hotel on May 15, 1903. His visit was part of a grand tour of twenty-five states in eight weeks, including sixteen days in Yellowstone National Park where he was accompanied by wildlife writer John Burroughs. After their visit, Burroughs said of Roosevelt, He is doubtless the most vital man on the continent, if not on the planet, today. He is many-sided, and every side throbs with his tremendous life and energy.\n\nRoosevelt at Hill's Studio, 1903\n\nWhile visiting Wawona, President Teddy Roosevelt visited the studio of preeminent landscape artist Thomas Hill. In the photograph, Willeta Hill and Estella Washburn bid President Roosevelt goodbye. Of conservation, Roosevelt wrote, \"It is also vandalism wantonly to destroy or to permit the destruction of what is beautiful in nature, whether it be a cliff, a forest, or a species of mammal or bird. Here in the United States we turn our rivers and streams into sewers and dumping-grounds, we pollute the air, we destroy forests, and exterminate fishes, birds and mammals -- not to speak of vulgarizing charming landscapes with hideous advertisements. But at last it looks as if our people are awakening.\"\n\nToday, Hill's Studio serves as the Wawona Visitor Center.\n\nRoosevelt at the Grizzly Giant, 1903\n\nPresident Roosevelt chose to camp with John Muir under the Grizzly Giant in the Mariposa Grove rather than stay at the Wawona Hotel. He said the grove was \"a temple greater than any human architect could by any possibility build.\" The President bedded down on a pile of 40 wool blankets. In the photograph, Roosevelt is fifth from the left and Muir is seventh.\n\nRoosevelt and Muir at Glacier Point, 1903\n\nTwo months prior to his visit, Roosevelt wrote to Muir asking him to guide him through the park. “I do not want anyone with me but you, and I want to drop politics absolutely for four days and just be out in the open with you.” Muir rearranged his schedule to accommodate this request. Muir admitted that during their trip, \"I stuffed him pretty well regarding the timber thieves, and the destructive work of lumbermen and other spoilers of the forest.\" When it snowed overnight on their camp at Glacier Point, Roosevelt said, \"This is bullier yet.\"\n\nTeddy Roosevelt and John Muir, May 1903\n\nUpon arriving in Yosemite Valley, Roosevelt told the reporters and crowds that, \"We were in a snowstorm last night (at Glacier Point) and it was just what I wanted.\" They camped another night in a meadow across from Bridalveil Fall. In 1906, Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove were receded to the United States for inclusion in Yosemite National Park, which was established in 1890.\n\nSentinel Hotel and Yosemite Falls, 1902\n\nNestled on the south bank of the Merced River in the old Yosemite Village, the Sentinel Hotel was originally called the Yosemite Falls Hotel. At the beginning of an economic depression in 1893, the Yosemite Grant Commissioners authorized a new lease to a hotelier A.B. Glasscock, an associate of the Washburn brothers. He renovated the hotel into first-class conditions, mimicking the design of the Washburn’s Wawona Hotel. The Sentinel Hotel was well positioned to benefit from the end of the depression a few years later.\n\nSentinel Hotel and Half Dome\n\nAs visitation to Yosemite Valley soared in the late 1890s, the Sentinel Hotel was remodeled to add more rooms. But the hotel and its cottages could handle only two hundred guests, an insufficient number given the destruction of the Stoneman House in 1896. In 1915, the Department of the Interior moved to consolidate Yosemite’s concessions. The Desmond Park Service Company was able to acquire the Sentinel Hotel as well as Camp Ahwahnee, Camp Lost Arrow, Thorton’s general store, the butcher shop, Coffman’s stables, and the Mountain House at Glacier Point. The Desmond Park Service Company, along with the Curry Company, was the precursor to the Yosemite Park and Curry Company, which controlled most park concessions until 1993.\n\nStephen Mather Descending Lembert Dome, 1921\n\nBorn in San Francisco on July 4, 1867, Stephen T. Mather was the first director of the National Park Service when it was established in 1916. He was a millionaire industrialist, a graduate and strong supporter of UC Berkeley, and a member of the Sierra Club. He also suffered from manic-depression and died of a stroke in 1930.\n\nConness Glacier and Ranger Sharsmith, 1932\n\nRanger naturalist Carl Sharsmith led a group climbing over Conness Glacier to the top of Mt. Conness in 1932. Sharsmith was a biology professor who worked each summer in the park from 1931 until he died in 1994 at age 91 as the National Park Service’s oldest ranger (at that time). The glacier itself has shrunk dramatically due to extended periods of above-average spring and summer temperatures. Between 1903 and 2014, based on photographic comparisons, Conness Glacier shrank by at least 60%.\n\nWawona Tunnel, Winter 1933\n\nIn 1927, Stephen Mather, Director of the National Park Service, initiated the development of a new Wawona Road that would meet the demands of modern automobile traffic. To minimize the new road’s impact on the park landscape, a design to bore a tunnel through the granite below Inspiration Point was adopted. The Wawona Tunnel construction began on November 30, 1930 and was formerly dedicated on June 10, 1933. At the time, it was the longest tunnel in the Western United States with its length of 4,230 feet. It cost $847,500 to build and required 275 tons of dynamite to blast through the solid granite. No workers lost their lives during its construction.\n\nTenaya Lake in Winter, 1933\n\nIn 1851, the Mariposa Battalion drove the Ahwahneechee from Yosemite Valley and captured their chief, Tenaya, on the shore of the lake that now bears his name. Lafayette Bunnell, a member of the Mariposa Battalion, wrote of telling Tenaya of the naming of the lake, “‘I called him up to us, and told him that we had given his name to the lake and the river. At first he seemed unable to comprehend our purpose, and pointing to the group of glistening peaks, near the head of the lake, said: ‘It already has a name; we call it Py-we-ack.’ Upon my telling him that we had named it Ten-ie-ya, because it was upon the shores of the lake that we had found his people, who would never return to it to live, his countenance fell and he at once left our group and joined his own family circle. His countenance as he left us indicated that he thought the naming of the lake no equivalent for the loss of his territory.’”\n\nGertrude Stein at the Yosemite Museum, 1935\n\nCelebrities, politicians, business notables, and artists have made the pilgrimage to Yosemite over the years. In 1935, Gertrude Stein, the noted poet, playwright, and novelist, visited and stayed at the The Ahwahnee. She wrote a postcard with a photograph of a mother bear and her cubs to Carl Van Vechten, a writer, photographer, and patron of the Harlem Renaissance. It read, \"Here we are unexpectedly and loving it, you must come next year with us and photograph the trees, they are worthy of your camera, really.\""
