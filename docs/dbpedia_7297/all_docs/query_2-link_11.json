        "text": "Howard Beckerman, beloved animator, teacher, author, historian and fellow Berndt Toast Gang member, passed away on Saturday. He was 93. His daughter, Sheri Beckerman Weisz, wrote \"It is with great sadness to report that my father, Howard Beckerman passed away early this morning.”\n\nAnimation Magazine:\n\nBeckerman began his career in animation in 1949, right after graduating from high school when Paul Terry hired him to join his famous studio Terrytoons. As he wrote in his biography, “It was a golden age of comics and animation, and I decided to do both. One day by taxi, subway and trolley, I left Flatbush for Terrytoons to work on Mighty Mouse and Heckle and Jeckle cartoons, and soon I was drawing Popeye and Casper the Friendly Ghost at Paramount’s Famous studios.”\n\nAfter serving in the Korean War, Beckerman return to create create TV spots for UPA and numerous New York animation studios. In 1970, he launched the Beckerman studio with my wife Iris, where they created commercials and sponsored films. “They brought smiles to audiences, and our independent films brought awards,” he wrote. “I traveled the globe as VP of International Association of film animators. Soon, I began teaching as a favor and I’m still at it after many years at Parsons School of Design and School of Visual Arts — all grist for writing my book Animation: The Whole Story for all those who are excited about animation.”\n\nIn the 1960s, Beckerman worked on animated shorts such as The Trip, The Plumber, Forget-Me-Nots. In the 1980s, his credits include Boop Beep (1984) and Doug TV series (1981). He also produced animated segments for Sesame Street.\n\nJerry Beck:\n\nAnimator/educator/historian Howard Beckerman passed away (perhaps symbolically, this past Saturday Morning). I met Howard back in my SVA and Asifa-East days in the early 1970s. He was always open and free to speak – recounting his personal experiences at the studios (50s Famous, UPA, 60s Paramount, etc.). His stories gave me insight and perspective on animation history I wouldn’t have gotten anywhere else.\n\nHoward has only passed on – his memory will live forever; his films will continue to entertain; his influence on a younger generation will inspire for decades to come. Howard was beloved by the community.\n\nThere was such an outpouring of love by everyone who knew him, or took his classes, or read his articles, on Facebook and other social media, I wasn’t sure what to post today in tribute. Don Yowp posted this nice tribute on his Tralfaz blog.\n\nHow to remember Howard? It’s too soon for me to wrap my head around that. I asked our Devon Baxter if I could repost his audio commentary with Howard, over Howard’s brilliant little Paramount cartoon, The Trip (1966). Devon also sent a selection of Howard’s hilarious print cartoons from Top Cel. I can’t think of anything that sums it up better. I included a few other Paramount cartoons to this post which Howard contributed story and design. We will all miss him.\n\nA Beckerman cartoon from the New York Union newsletter, TOP CEL.\n\nHoward was one of the members of a panel I moderated back in 2006. From left, standing: Howard Beckerman, Sandy Kossin, Mike Lynch, Stan Goldberg; sitting: Mort Drucker and Rina Piccolo.\n\nHoward was always just the nicest fellow and terribly unassuming. I remember the panel and some of the comments these pros made. It was a good “state of the cartooning art” talk at the Great Neck Arts Center. I asked, “What’s the impact of the internet?” This was the time when a 56k modem was considered pretty darn fast. Howard correctly predicted, “Pretty soon, you're going to be able to watch cartoons on anything, anywhere, any time\" He thought for a second, then his eyes twinkled, and added, \"On your shoe.\"\n\nAdrian Sinnott:\n\nThe Berndt Toast Gang and I are so sorry to hear of the passing of the wonderful, talented, kind and generous, Howard Beckerman.\n\nHoward has been an inspiration to me, all the BTG and, of course, thousands of animators, cartoonists and students.\n\nHoward’s book, “Animation, The Whole Story,” will continue to inspire generations of animators.\n\nI shall miss seeing that wonderful, beaming smile, listening to his wonderful stories and learning from his vast experience.\n\n“May his memory last an eternity”\n\nJerry Beck's post above has links to many images and cartoons. Here's The Trip. Jerry Beck again:\n\nThe mid 1960s at Paramount was a little paradise for several animator/designers working under Shamus Culhane. Culhane, Gil Miret and Howard Beckerman had free rein to create shorts (albeit on a low budget). Here is one of his best – with an audio commentary by myself and Howard.\n\nMore:\n\nDaily Cartoonist\n\nThe Geezer Show\n\nCartoon Research: Celebrating Howard Beckerman\n\nVia Cartoons on Film:"
