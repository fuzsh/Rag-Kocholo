        "text": "Ron Howard began his career as a child star and in recent years, he has shined as a director in some big projects. He has certainly left his mark on Hollywood and at 70 years old, continues to showcase his talents. He is perhaps best known for playing Richie Cunningham in the series Happy Days and developed some lifelong friendships from the show. After Happy Days ended, he decided to focus more on directing, although he has been known to show off his acting chops now and again. Howard turns 70 years old on March 1 and has his first animated feature, The Shrinking of Treehorn, slated to come out on Netflix later this year. Let’s celebrate with some fun facts about the star!\n\nCan you remember his directorial debut?\n\nHis very first time directing was in the lo-budget film Grand Theft Auto in 1977 produced by Roger Corman. He also starred in the film and co-wrote it with his dad. His first big theater debut was Night Shift (1982) which starred fellow Happy Days star Henry Winkler.\n\nHis career began as a baby\n\nWhile many know that he starred as Opie on The Andy Griffith Show as a young kid, his first role was in the film Frontier Woman at the age of eighteen months.\n\nHe co-founded a film and television production company\n\nHoward and Brian Grazer are the co-founders of Imagine Entertainment, which has brought to us films and TV shows such as A Beautiful Mind, 8 Mile, The Nutty Professor, Felicity, Parenthood, and many, many more.\n\nHis family is big into the entertainment world\n\nHis father was actor Rance Howard, who he casts a lot along with older brother Clint, and several of his four children have gone into acting including the famous Bryce Dallas Howard. Howard and his daughter worked together on a documentary called Dads, which was Bryce’s directorial debut. Fun fact: All of his kids are named after the places they were conceived.\n\nHoward and his wife have been together for almost 50 years\n\nHoward and his wife Cheryl have been married since 1975. They met in high school and it was love at first sight even though he did appear on The Dating Game in 1971.\n\nHoward once said, “I met her, and there was never anybody else. She’s unbelievably supportive and always has been. Our compatibility has endured through all kinds of experiences.” So sweet!\n\nHe was the voice of a popular sitcom\n\nAlthough he was only filling in on the pilot, Howard became the narrator and even made a cameo on the show Arrested Development.\n\nHe shared his top five favorite movies of all time\n\nIn 2023, he revealed his favorite movies of all time including The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), The Emigrants (1971), The Exorcist (1973), Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939), and One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (1975)."
