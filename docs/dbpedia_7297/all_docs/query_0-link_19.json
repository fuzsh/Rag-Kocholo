        "text": "\"Honestly, I feel like a zaddy,\" Omar Apollo says with a roguish grin, \"because I'm 6'5\" so, like, you can run up in my arms and stay there, you know what I mean?\"\n\nAs a bonafide R&B sensation and one of the internet’s favorite boyfriends, Apollo is likely used to the labels, attention and online swooning that come with modern fame. But in this instance, there’s a valid reason for asking about his particular brand of \"zaddyhood\": he’s been turned into a Bratz doll.\n\nIn the middle of June, the popular toy company blasted a video to its nearly 5 million social media followers showing off the singer as a real-life Bratz Boy — the plastic version draped in a long fur coat (shirtless, naturally), with a blinged-out cross necklace and matching silver earrings as he belts out his 2023 single \"3 Boys\" from a smoke-covered stage.\n\nThe video, which was captioned \"Zaddy coded,\" promptly went viral, helped along by an amused Apollo reposting the clip to his own Instagram Story. \"It was so funny,\" he adds. \"And it's so accurate; that's literally how my shows go. It made me look so glamorous, I loved it.\"\n\nThe unexpected viral moment came with rather auspicious timing, considering Apollo is prepping for the release of his hotly anticipated sophomore album. God Said No arrives June 28 via Warner Records.\n\nIn fact, the star is so busy with the roll-out that, on the afternoon of our interview, he’s FaceTiming from the back of a car. The day prior, he’d filmed the music video for \"Done With You,\" the album’s next single. Now he’s headed to the airport to jet off to Paris, where he’ll be photographed front row at the LOEWE SS25 men’s runway show in between Sabrina Carpenter and Mustafa — the latter of whom is one of the few collaborators featured on God Said No.\n\nApollo’s trusted co-writer and producer, Teo Halm, is also joining the conversation from his home studio in L.A. In between amassing credits for Beyoncé (The Lion King: The Gift), Rosalía and J Balvin (the Latin GRAMMY-winning \"Con Altura\"), SZA (\"Notice Me\" and \"Open Arms\" featuring Travis Scott) and others, the 25-year-old virtuoso behind the boards had teamed up with Apollo on multiple occasions. Notably, the two collabed on \"Evergreen (You Didn’t Deserve Me At All),\" which helped Apollo score his nomination for Best New Artist at the 2023 GRAMMYs.\n\nIn the wake of that triumph, Apollo doubled down on their creative chemistry by asking Halm to executive produce God Said No. (The producer is also quick to second his pal’s magnetic mystique: \"Don't get it twisted, he's zaddy, for sure.\")\n\nApollo bares his soul like never before across the album’s 14 tracks, as he processes the bitter end of a two-year relationship with an unnamed paramour. The resulting portrait of heartbreak is a new level of emotional exposure for a singer already known for his unguarded vulnerability and naked candor. (He commissioned artist Doron Langberg to paint a revealing portrait of him for the cover of his 2023 EP Live For Me, and unapologetically included a painting of his erect penis as the back cover of the vinyl release.)\n\nOn lead single \"Spite,\" he’s pulled between longing and resentment in the wake of the break-up over a bouncing guitar riff. Second single \"Dispose of Me\" finds Apollo heartsick and feeling abandoned as he laments, \"It don’t matter if it’s 25 years, 25 months/ It don’t matter if it’s 25 days, it was real love/ We got too much history/ So don’t just dispose of me.\"\n\nElsewhere, the singer offers the stunning admission that \"I would’ve married you\" on album cut \"Life’s Unfair.\" Then, on the very next song — the bumping, braggadocious \"Against Me\" — Apollo grapples with the reality that he’s been permanently altered by the love affair while on the prowl for a rebound. \"I cannot act like I’m average/ You know that I am the baddest bitch,\" he proclaims on the opening verse, only to later admit, \"I’ve changed so much, but have you heard?/ I can’t move how I used to.\"\n\nMore Omar Apollo News & Videos\n\nGiven the personal subject matter filling God Said No — not to mention the amount of acclaim he earned with Ivory — it would be understandable if Apollo felt a degree of pressure or anxiety when it came to crafting his sophomore studio set. But according to the singer, that was entirely not the case.\n\n\"I feel like I wouldn’t be able to make art if I felt pressure,\" he says. \"Why would I be nervous about going back and making more music? If anything, I'm more excited and my mind is opened up in a whole other way and I've learned so much.\"\n\nIn order to throw his entire focus into the album’s creation, Apollo invited Halm to join him in London. The duo set up shop in the famous Abbey Road Studios, where the singer often spent 12- to 13-hour days attempting to exorcize his heartbreak fueled by a steady stream of Aperol spritzes and cigarettes.\n\nThe change of scenery infused the music with new sonic possibilities, like the kinetic synths and pulsating bass line that set flight to \"Less of You.\" Apollo and Halm agree that the single was directly inspired by London’s unique energy.\n\n\"It's so funny because we were out there in London, but we weren't poppin' out at all,\" the Halm says. \"Our London scene was really just, like, studio, food. Omar was a frickin' beast. He was hitting the gym every day…. But it was more like feeding off the culture on a day-to-day basis. Like, literally just on the walk to the studio or something as simple as getting a little coffee. I don't think that song would've happened in L.A.\"\n\nPoetry played a surprisingly vital role in the album’s creation as well, with Apollo littering the studio with collections by \"all of the greats,\" including the likes of Ocean Vuong, Victoria Chang, Philip Larkin, Alan Ginsberg, Mary Oliver and more.\n\n\"Could you imagine making films, but never watching a film?\" the singer posits, turning his appreciation for the written art form into a metaphor about cinema. \"Imagine if I never saw [films by] the greats, the beauty of words and language, and how it's manipulated and how it flows. So I was so inspired.\"\n\nPerhaps a natural result of consuming so much poetic prose, Apollo was also led to experiment with his own writing style. While on a day trip with his parents to the Palace of Versailles, he wrote a poem that ultimately became the soaring album highlight \"Plane Trees,\" which sends the singer’s voice to new, shiver-inducing heights.\n\n\"I'd been telling Teo that I wanted to challenge myself vocally and do a power ballad,\" he says. \"But it wasn't coming and we had attempted those songs before. And I was exhausted with writing about love; I was so sick of it. I was like, Argh, I don't want to write anymore songs with this person in my mind.\"\n\nInstead, the GRAMMY nominee sat on the palace grounds with his parents, listening to his mom tell stories about her childhood spent in Mexico. He challenged himself to write about the majestic plane tree they were sitting under in order to capture the special moment.\n\nBack at the studio, Apollo’s dad asked Halm to simply \"make a beat\" and, soon enough, the singer was setting his poem to music. (Later, Mustafa’s hushed coda perfected the song’s denouement as the final piece of the puzzle.) And if Apollo’s dad is at least partially responsible for how \"Plane Trees\" turned out, his mom can take some credit for a different song on the album — that’s her voice, recorded beneath the same plane tree, on the outro of delicate closer \"Glow.\"\n\nBoth the artist and the producer ward off any lingering expectations that a happy ending will arrive by the time \"Glow\" fades to black, however. \"The music that we make walks a tightrope of balancing beauty and tragedy,\" Halm says. \"It's always got this optimism in it, but it's never just, like, one-stop shop happy. It's always got this inevitable pain that just life has.\n\n\"You know, even if maybe there wasn't peace in the end for Omar, or if that wasn't his full journey with getting through that pain, I think a lot of people are dealing with broken hearts who it really is going to help,\" the producer continues. \"I can only just hope that the music imparts leaving people with hope.\"\n\nApollo agrees that God Said No contains a \"hopeful thread,\" even if his perspective on the project remains achingly visceral. Did making the album help heal his broken heart? \"No,\" he says with a sad smile on his face. \"But it is proof of pain. And it’s a beautiful thing that is immortalized now, forever.\n\n\"One day, I can look back at it and be like, Wow, what a beautiful thing I experienced. But yeah, no, it didn't help me,\" he says with a laugh.\n\nLatest News & Exclusive Videos\n\nBeloved by fans around the globe, yet increasingly unaffordable for many artists, concert tours are central to the world of entertainment and local economies. After the pandemic-era global shuttering of concert venues large and small, tours are back, and bigger than ever.\n\nTaylor Swift’s Eras Tour issmashing records, selling more than four million tickets and earning more than $1 billion. But that tour made headlines for another reason: as reported inBusiness Insider and other outlets, for a six-month period in 2023, Swift’s two jets spent a combined 166 hours in the air between concerts, shuttling at most a total of 28 passengers.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, heightened concerns about the global environmental cost of concert touring have led a number of prominent artists to launch initiatives. Those efforts seek both to mitigate the negative effects of touring and communicate messages about sustainability to concertgoers.\n\nA 2023 study sponsored by Texas-based electricity provider Payless Power found that the carbon footprint of many touring bands was massive. In 2022, concert tours in five genres — country, classic rock, hip-hop/rap, metal and pop — were responsible for CO2 emissions totaling nearly 45,000 metric tons. A so-called greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide contributes to climate change by radiative forcing; increased levels of CO2 also contribute to health problems.\n\nNo serious discussion of climate issues suggests a worldwide halt to live music touring, but there exists much room for improvement. Both on their own and with the help of dedicated nonprofit organizations, many artists are taking positive steps toward mitigating the deleterious effects that touring exerts upon the environment.\n\nSmart tour planning is one way to lessen an artist’s carbon footprint. Ed Sheeran’s 2022 European run minimized flights between concert venues, making that leg of his tour the year's most environmentally efficient. Total carbon dioxide emissions (from flights and driving) on Sheeran’s tour came to less than 150 metric tons. In contrast, Dua Lipa’s tour during the same period generated 12 times as much — more than 1800 metric tons — of CO2.\n\nIn July, singer/songwriter and four-time GRAMMY nominee Jewel will embark on her first major tour in several years, alongside GRAMMY winner Melissa Etheridge. During the planning stage for the 28-city tour, Jewel suggested an idea that could reduce the tour’s carbon footprint.\n\n\"I always thought it was so silly and so wasteful — and so carbon footprint-negative — to have separate trucks, separate lighting, separate crews, separate hotel rooms, separate costs,\" Jewel says. She pitched the idea of sharing a backing band with Etheridge. \"I’ve been trying to do this for 25 years,\" Jewel says with a laugh. \"Melissa is the first person who took me up on it!\"\n\nThe changes will not only reduce the tour’s carbon footprint, but they’ll also lessen the cost of taking the shows on the road. Acknowledging that there are many opportunities to meet the challenges of touring’s negative impact upon the environment, Jewel emphasizes that “you have to find [solutions] that work for you.”\n\nSheeran and Jewel aren’t the only popular artists trying to make a difference. A number of high profile artists have become actively involved in creating the momentum for positive change. Those artists believe that their work on sustainability issues goes hand in hand with their role as public figures. Their efforts take two primary forms: making changes themselves, andadvocating for action among their fans.\n\nThe Climate Machine\n\nNorhan Bayomi is an Egypt-born environmental scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a key member of theEnvironmental Solutions Initiative, a program launched to address sustainable climate action. She’s also a recording artist in the trance genre, working under the nameNourey.\n\nThe ESI collaborates with industry heavyweights Live Nation, Warner Music Group and others as well with touring/recording acts likeColdplay to examine the carbon footprint of the music industry. A key component of the ESI is theClimate Machine, a collaborative research group that seeks to help the live music industry reduce carbon emissions. \"As a research institution, we bring technologies and analytics to understand, in the best way possible, the actual impact of the music industry upon climate change,\" says John Fernández, Director of the ESI.\n\n\"I’m very interested in exploring ways that we can bridge between environmental science, climate change and music fans,\" Bayomi says. She explains that the tools at the ESI’s disposal include \"virtual reality, augmented reality and generative AI,\" media forms that can communicate messages to music fans and concertgoers. Fernández says that those endeavors are aimed at \"enlisting, enabling and inspiring people to get engaged in climate change.\"\n\nThe Environmental Solutions Initiative cites Coldplay as a high-profile success. The band and its management issued an \"Emissions Update\" documentin June 2024, outlining its success at achieving their goal of reducing direct carbon emissions from show production, freight, band and crew travel. The established target was a 50 percent cut in emissions compared to Coldplay’s previous tour; the final result was a 59 percent reduction between their 2022-23 tour and 2016-17 tour.\n\nA significant part of that reduction came as a result of a renewable-energy based battery system that powers audio and lights. The emissions data in the update was reviewed and independently validated by MIT’s Fernández.\n\nChange Is Reverberating\n\nGuitarist Adam Gardner is a founding member of Massachusetts-based indie rockersGuster, but he's more than just a singer in a rock band. Gardner is also the co-founder ofREVERB, one of the organizations at the forefront of developing and implementing climate-focused sustainability initiatives.\n\nFounded in 2004 by Gardner and his wife, environmental activist Lauren Sullivan, REVERB began with a goal of making touring more sustainable; over the years its focus has expanded to promote industry-wide changes. Today, the organization promotes sustainability throughout the industry in partnership with music artists, concert venues and festivals.\n\nREVERB initiatives have included efforts to eliminate single-use plastics at the California Roots Music & Arts Festival, clean energy projects in cooperation with Willie Nelson and Billie Eilish, and efforts with other major artists. Gardner has seen sustainability efforts grow over two decades\n\n\"It’s really amazing to see the [change] with artists, with venues, with fans,\" Gardner says. \"Today, people are not just giving lip service to sustainable efforts; they really want to do things that are real and measurable.\"\n\nTheMusic Decarbonization Project is one tangible example of REVERB’s successes. \"Diesel power is one of the dirtiest sources of power,\" Gardner explains. \"And it’s an industry standard to power festival stages with diesel generators.\" Working withWillie Nelson, the organization helped switch the power sources at his annual Luck Reunion to clean energy. At last year’s festival, Nelson’s headlining stage drew 100 percent of its power from solar-powered batteries. \"We set up a temporary solar farm,\" Gardner says, \"and the main stage didn’t have to use any diesel power.\"\n\nBillie Eilish was another early supporter of the initiative. \"She helped us launch the program,\" Gardner says. Eilish’s set at Lollapallooza 2023 drew power from solar batteries, too.\n\nWith such high-profile successes as a backdrop, Gardner believes that REVERB is poised to do even more to foster sustainable concerts and touring. \"Our role now,\" he says, \"isn’t just, ‘Hey, think about this stuff.’ It’s more how do we push farther, faster?\"\n\nAdam Gardner believes that musicians are uniquely positioned to help make a difference where issues of sustainability are concerned. \"When you’re a musician, you’re connecting with fans heart-to-heart. That’s what moves people. And that’s where the good stuff happens.\"\n\nSmall-scale, individual changes can make a difference — especially when they’re coordinated and amplified among other concertgoers. Gardner provides real-world examples. \"Instead of buying a plastic bottle, I brought my reusable and filled it up. Maybe I carpooled to the show.\" Conceding that such steps might seem like drops of water in a giant pool, he emphasizes the power of scale. \"When you actually multiply [those things for] just one summer tour, it adds up,\" he says. \"And it reminds people, ‘You’re not alone in this; you’re part of a community that’s taking action.\"\n\nGardner understands that REVERB’s arguments have to be framed the right way to reach concertgoers. \"Look,\" he admits, \"It’s a concert. We’re not here to be a buzzkill. Our [aim] now is making sure people don’t lose hope.\" He says that REVERB and its partners seek to demonstrate that, with collective action and cultural change, there is reason for optimism.\n\n\"There’s a wonderful feedback loop between hope and action,\" Gardner says with a smile. \"You can’t really have one without the other.\"\n\nSustainable Partnerships\n\nTanner Watt is Director of Partnerships at REVERB; he works directly with touring artists to develop, coordinate and implement initiatives that bring together his organization’s objectives and the specific personal concerns of the artists. \"I get to come up with all the fun, big ideas,\" he says with a wide smile.\n\nWatt acknowledges that like every concertgoer, each touring artist has a certain level of responsibility where sustainability is concerned. \"And everyone can be doing something,\" he says, noting a number of straightforward actions that artists can put in place while on tour. \"They can eliminate single-use waste. They can donate hotel toiletries that [would otherwise] hit the landfill.\"\n\nWatt stresses that artists can lead by example. \"Nobody wants to listen to an artist telling them what to do if they’re not doing it themselves,\" he says. \"But we believe that everybody cares about something.\" He suggests that if an artist has cultivated a following, \"Why not use [that platform] to be that change you want to see in the world?\"\n\nEach artist has his or her own specific areas of concern, but Watt says that there’s a base level of \"greening\" that takes place on every REVERB-affiliated tour. Where things go from there is up to the artist, in coordination with REVERB. Watt mentions Billie Eilish and her tour’s sustainability commitment. \"The Venn diagram of food security, community health, access to healthy food, and the impact on the planet is a big cause for her,\" he says. \"So there’s plant-based catering for her entire crew, across the entire tour.\"\n\nSpeaking toBillboard, Eilish's mother Maggie Baird said championing sustainability starts with artists. \"If artists are interested, it does really start with them telling their teams that they care and that it’s foremost in their thoughts.\" In the same conversation, Eilish called the battle for sustainability \"a never-ending f–king fight.\"\n\nWatt acknowledges that with so many challenges, it’s important for a concerned artist to focus on the issues that move them the most, and where they can make the biggest difference. \"Jack Johnson is a great example,\" he says. While Johnson is a vocal advocate for many environmental issues, on tour he focuses on two (in Watt’s words) \"cause umbrellas\": single-use plastics solutions and sustainable community food systems. Each show on the tour hosts tables representing local nonprofit organizations, presenting concertgoers with real-world, human-scale solutions to those specific challenges.\n\nFour-time GRAMMY winnerBrittany Howard is another passionate REVERB partner. \"Knowing that I wanted to make my tours more sustainable was a start,\" she tells GRAMMY.com, \"but working with REVERB really helped me bring it to life on the road. REVERB has helped us with guidelines and a green rider to keep our stage, greenrooms and buses more sustainable.\"\n\nAfter listing several other specific ways that her tour supports sustainability, Howard notes, \"By supporting these efforts, I am helping ensure future generations have access to clean water, fish, and all that I love about the outdoors.\" A dollar from every ticket sold to a Brittany Howard concert goes toward support of REVERB’s Music Decarbonization project. \"I’m also excited to see industry-wide efforts that are reducing the carbon pollution of live music,\" Howard continues. \"Because it’s not just [about] a single tour, it’s every tour.\"\n\nThere’s a popular aphorism: \"You can’t manage what you can’t measure.\" From its start, REVERB has sought not only to promote change, but to measure its success. \"As long as I’ve been at REVERB, we’ve issuedimpact reports,\" says Tanner Watt. \"We include data points, and give the report to the artists so they understand what we’ve done together.\" He admits that some successes are more tangible than others, but that it’s helpful to focus on the ones that can be quantified. \"We’re very excited that our artists share those with their fans.\"\n\nWatt is clear-eyed at the challenges that remain. \"Even the word ‘sustainable’ can be misleading,\" he concedes, suggesting that the only truly sustainable tour is the one that doesn’t happen. \"But if folks don’t step it up and change the way we do business in every industry — not just ours — we’re going to get to a place where we’re forced to make sacrifices that aren’t painless.\" Getting that message across is REVERB’s aim. \"We can’t stop the world,\" Watt says. \"So we find ways to approach these things positively.\"\n\nWatt says that the fans at concerts featuring Jack Johnson and theDave Matthews Band — both longtime REVERB partners — are already on board with many of the sustainability-focused initiatives which those artists promote. \"But there are lots of artists — and lots of fan bases — out there that aren’t messaged to, or have been mis-messaged to,\" he says. \"I’m really excited to find more ways to expand our reach to them, beyond mainstream pop music. Because these are conversations that are meaningful for everyone, regardless of political affiliation or other beliefs.\"\n\nReimagining The Planet’s Future\n\nSinger, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Adam Met does more than frontAJR, the indie pop trio he founded in 2005 with brothers Jack and Ryan. Met has a PhD in sustainable development and is a climate activist; he's also the founder/Executive Director ofPlanet Reimagined, a nonprofit that promotes sustainability and activism through its work with businesses, other organizations and musicians.\n\n\"I’ve spent years traveling around the world, seeing the direct impact of climate change,\" Met says. He cites two recent and stark examples. \"When we pulled up to a venue in San Francisco, the band had to wear gas masks going from the bus into the venue, because of forest fires,\" he says. AJR’s road crew had to contend with a flash flood in Athens, Greece that washed out their hotel. \"And in Rome, some of our crew members fainted because of the heat.\"\n\nEncouraged by representatives from the United Nations, Met launched Planet Reimagined. Met’s approach focuses on tailored, city-specific actions to empower fans and amplify diverse voices in the climate movement. Through social media and live shows, Met strives to galvanize climate activism among AJR fans. And the methods he has developed can be implemented by other touring artists.\n\nMet points out that one of the most climate-unfriendly parts of the entire concert tour enterprise is fans traveling to and from the concerts. And that’s something over which the artist has little or no control. What they can do, he says, is try to educate and influence. Working closely with Ticketmaster and other stakeholders, Met’s nonprofit initiated a study — conducted from July to December 2023, with results published in April 2024 — to explore the energy that happens at concerts. \"In sociology,\" he explains, \"that energy is called collective effervescence.\" The study’s goal is to find ways to channel that energy toward advocacy and action.\n\nPolling a quarter million concertgoers across musical genres, the study collected data on attitudes about climate change. \"Seventy-three percent of fans who attend concerts believe that climate change is real, and that we need to be doing more about it,\" Met says. \"Seventy-eight percent have already taken some sort of action in their lives.\" He believes that if his organization can activate even a fraction of the estimated 250 million people annually who attend concerts around the globe, \"that’s the ballgame.\"\n\nMet’s goal is to do more than, say, get concertgoers to switch from plastic to paper drinking straws. \"At scale those things make a difference. But people want to see actions where there’s a track record,\" he says; a return on investment.\n\nAJR will be putting a plan into action on the second half of their upcoming arena tour. Part of the initiative is encouraging concertgoers to register to vote, and then actually vote. Beyond that, Met has specific actions in mind. \"At every single stop, we’re putting together materials around specific policies that are being debated at the local level,\" he explains. \"We give people a script right there, so they can call their elected representative and say, ‘I want you to vote [a certain way on this issue].’\"\n\nHe believes the initiative will lead to thousands of people contacting – and hopefully influencing – their representatives. With regard to sustainability issues, Met is convinced that \"the most impact that you can have as an artist is when you give fans ways to pick up the mantle themselves.\"\n\nArtists Who Are Going On Tour In 2024: The Rolling Stones, Drake, Olivia Rodrigo & More\n\nWhen the Backstreet Boys released \"I Want It That Way\" on April 12, 1999, they likely had no idea how beloved their smash hit would still be a quarter-century later.\n\nWritten by the Swedish powerhouse team of Andreas Carlsson and Max Martin, \"I Want It That Way\" is undoubtedly BSB's signature hit, particularly thanks to its memorable undulating melody and its long-debated cryptic meaning. But perhaps the most surprising part of the song's legacy is how it has resonated across genres — from a TikTok cover by Korn to a hip-hop sampling by Lil Uzi Vert.\n\nAs the Backstreet Boys celebrate the 25th anniversary of \"I Want It That Way,\" take a look at how the song has been diversely covered, lovingly lampooned and karaoke jammed by an array of voices in the business.\n\nWeird Al Yankovic (2003)\n\nWhen the king of parody songs selects one to skewer, you know it's an iconic song. Weird Al Yankovic paid tribute to the largeness of the Backstreet Boys classic when he used \"I Want It That Way\" as the basis of a song called \"eBay\" in 2003.\n\nYankovic's chorus replaces the original's with, \"A used pink bathrobe/ A rare mint snow globe/ A Smurf TV tray/ I bought on eBay.\" The Backstreet Boys send up appears on Yankovic's album Poodle Hat, which won Best Comedy Album at the 2004 GRAMMYs.\n\nOne Direction (2013)\n\nThree years One Direction formed on \"The X Factor,\" the five lads — Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan, Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson — included a cover of \"I Want It That Way\" on their 2013 concert set lists, the young boy band paying homage to the ones that came before them. Though their English accents poked through at times, their version was loyal to the original, and got their crowds singing along.\n\n\"Glee\" (2013)\n\nPoking fun at the presumed rivalry between *NSYNC and Backstreet Boys, a medley of the former's \"Bye Bye Bye\" and \"I Want It That Way\" was featured in Season 4, Episode 16 of \"Glee.\" In the episode — aptly titled \"Feud\" — choir director Mr. Schuester (Matthew Morrison) and glee club heartthrob Finn (Cory Monteith) face off in an epic boy band battle, which ultimately proved the groups' respective music was more cohesive than divisive.\n\nBrittany Howard and Jim James (2016)\n\nThe lead singers of Alabama Shakes and My Morning Jacket covering a boy band classic. It doesn't sound real, but Brittany Howard and Jim James did just that in 2016 when they recorded \"I Want It That Way\" for an animated short cartoon called \"A Love Story.\"\n\nReleased by the fast food chain Chipotle Mexican Grill, the clip was part of a creative campaign to showcase the company's focus on natural ingredients. Howard and James highlight the poignancy and versatility of the song by adding lush string arrangements and dramatic beats.\n\nBackstreet Boys x Jimmy Fallon and The Roots (2018)\n\nThe 2018 live performance of \"I Want It That Way\" by the Backstreet Boys, Jimmy Fallon and The Roots for \"The Tonight Show\" is arguably the sweetest rendition of the song — and not just because they're using a mini xylophone, baby tambourine and other toy classroom instruments. It's even more endearing than the previous collaborations between Fallon and Backstreet Boys: a barbershop singing version of Sisqo's \"Thong Song\" and a \"Bawkstreet Boys\" version of \"Everybody (Backstreet's Back),\" with everyone dressed like fluffy birds.\n\nThe 1975 (2020)\n\nBritish rockers The 1975 performed a fairly faithful cover of \"I Want It That Way,\" hitting all the high notes at several of their 2023 world concert tour stops. But it's not the first time frontman Matty Healy has hinted at the Backstreet Boys' influence on his band: he told Pitchfork in 2020 that \"College Dropout-era Kanye West meets Backstreet Boys\" was part of their veritable moodboard at the time when working on their own song called \"Tonight (I Wish I Was Your Boy).\"\n\nLil Uzi Vert (2020)\n\nIn 2020, Lil Uzi Vert released a rap song called \"That Way\" that includes a refrain of \"I want it that way\" sung to the tune of the Backstreet original, but with an AutoTune twist. From there, the lyrics become quite a bit naughtier than anything the BSB guys have uttered in any song.\n\n\"I don't know how [the idea of] Backstreet Boys got involved in this song, I really don't,\" the song's producer Supah Mario told Splice at the time. \"I think it was all Uzi. But it was a game changer.\"\n\nThe interpolation was so good, in fact, that Nick Carter even invited Lil Uzi Vert to collaborate: \"Now you're gonna have to be featured on our next album bud,\" he tweeted upon the song's release.\n\nKorn (2022)\n\nFans of Korn know that the nu metal band has a sense of humor, but few could've expected that Jonathan Davis and crew would post a TikTok of themselves singing \"I Want It That Way\" in 2022.\n\n\"I never wanna hear you say… 'Worst Is On Its Way,'\" reads the caption on the post, a tongue-in-cheek reference to Korn's 2022 song of the same name.\n\nBackstreet Boys responded on the app via a hilarious Duet video with Nick Carter. In the video, Carter — who sports fabulous metal eye makeup and a long silver wig — doesn't actually say or sing anything, he just drops his jaw in amazement.\n\nBackstreet Boys x Downy (2022)\n\nDowny hired the Backstreet Boys to poke fun at \"I Want It That Way\" with the now-viral \"Tell Me Why\" commercial in 2022. All five members — Nick Carter, Howie Dorough, Brian Littrell, AJ McLean and Kevin Richardson — appear as a Backstreet Boys poster on the wall that comes to life, using the \"tell me why\" hook of their hit to engage a woman doing laundry in a conversation about washing her clothes.\n\nAs Saatchi group account director Jen Brotman told Muse at the time, the nostalgic ad also spawned some memories for the folks working on the ad campaign.\n\n\"The moment [BSB] stood in front of the camera, they rehearsed 'I Want It That Way' just to get the notes right, and we felt like we were getting serenaded on set,\" Brotman recalled. \"We couldn't believe how emotional we all got — there may or may not have been tears in some eyes. The song has always been a karaoke favorite of the team, so we knew which 'tell me whys' we wanted them to hit, and we still can't get it out of our heads.\"\n\nEd Sheeran (2023)\n\nWhen he fancies singing a bit of karaoke, Ed Sheeran loves leaning on \"I Want It That Way,\" as the star showed at his favorite Nashville bar in July 2023. A patron caught him on camera and his happiness level is undeniable when belting out this enduring pop classic.\n\nAs Sheeran told CBS News a few months later, he grew up on the pop hits of everyone from Backstreet Boys to Britney Spears. But what he said about \"I Want It That Way\" specifically may be the best way to describe its long-lasting impact: \"You can't be in a bar, a couple of beers in, and 'I Want It That Way' comes on and not be like, 'This is a good song.' You can't.\"\n\n24 Songs Turning 20: Listen To 2004's Bangers, From \"Yeah!\" To \"Since U Been Gone\"\n\nWillie Nelson, \"Always On My Mind\"\n\nBest Country Vocal Performance, Male, 1983\n\nIn this cover, Nelson sings to the woman in his life, lamenting over those small things he should have said and done, but never took the time.

This quintessential 2010s bop from one of music's most formidable couples captures why their alliance set the world's hearts aflame (and so did their steamy GRAMMYs performance of it).\n\nEd Sheeran, \"Thinking Out Loud\"\n\nSong Of The Year / Best Pop Solo Performance, 2016\n\nAlong with his abundant talent, Sheeran's boy-next-door charm is what rocketed him to the top of the pop ranks. And with swooning lyrics and a waltzing melody, \"Thinking Out Loud\" is proof that he's a modern-day monarch of the love song.\n\nLady Gaga & Bradley Cooper, \"Shallow\"\n\nBest Pop Duo/Group Performance / Best Song Written For Visual Media, 2019\n\nA Star is Born's cachet has gone up and down with its various remakes, but the 2018 iteration was a smash hit.
