        "text": "1. Eric Adams\n\nNew York City Mayor\n\nNew York City wouldn’t quite be New York City without a larger than life leader – and Mayor Eric Adams never fails to deliver. The city’s nightlife-loving cheerleader in chief waited years to ascend to the city’s top post, a development he often attributes to divine intervention and one that he says has made him a “symbol of Black manhood in this city, in this country.” While some crime figures have improved on his watch, the mayor is now contending with a migrant crisis, an emboldened City Council and questions about a federal investigation – as well as dismal poll numbers that have his rivals waiting to pounce.\n\n2. Andrea Stewart-Cousins\n\nState Senate Majority Leader\n\nState Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins has been exerting her power in Albany, leading her chamber in defeating Gov. Kathy Hochul’s nomination of Hector LaSalle for chief judge, leading the Clean Slate Act to passage and shaping a budget to include the top priorities of her caucus. Stewart-Cousins said the Clean Slate Act will stop New Yorkers from having a criminal record hanging over them after they have repaid their debt to society. Stewart-Cousins touted the inclusion of child care funding, expanded school lunches and new mental health funds as wins.\n\n3. Carl Heastie\n\nAssembly Speaker\n\nThe 100th speaker of the Assembly, Carl Heastie may represent the Bronx but he’s also focused on a statewide agenda that benefits communities. In 2023, his biggest priority was addressing New York’s housing needs, and he was not afraid to point out where Gov. Kathy Hochul’s ambitious – and ultimately failed – housing agenda was lacking. Heastie said Hochul’s failed plan to add 800,000 new units statewide needed more emphasis on ownership than rentals. With housing remaining a top 2024 Albany agenda item, look for Heastie and Hochul to joust again on the issue.\n\n4. Adrienne Adams\n\nNew York City Council Speaker\n\nSometimes New York City Hall is Adams vs. Adams – Mayor Eric Adams and the City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams. While they’re both outer-borough Democrats with moderate political leanings, they aren’t always on the same page. Adrienne Adams has pushed back on big issues like the proposed budget cuts of 5% across the board and led the council in overriding the mayor’s veto of landmark housing legislation and on criminal justice issues. Adams has the distinction of being the first African American speaker of the City Council and the first woman to represent her Queens district.\n\n5. Hakeem Jeffries\n\nHouse Minority Leader\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries may be a gerrymandered New York electoral map away from one of Washington’s most influential perches. With New York redrawing its congressional districts again, the flipping of a few seats could help elevate the Brooklynite to House speaker next year. Unlike Speaker Mike Johnson and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, the disciplined Jeffries won all of the votes in his conference in 2023’s marathon speakership votes. Jeffries would be the nation’s first Black House speaker, and the first speaker from New York since Theodore Pomeroy of Auburn held the job for one day in 1869.\n\n6. Letitia James\n\nState Attorney General\n\nLetitia James may go down in history as one of a handful of prosecutors to successfully bring charges against Donald Trump. Yet the former president is not the only powerful figure James has taken on as she has positioned herself as the nation’s most consequential state attorney general. She was part of a coalition of state attorneys general who got tech giant Google to pay out $700 million for having a monopoly on Android apps. James is also taking on the National Rifle Association and brought down its powerful longtime leader. The Brooklynite is the first woman of color to hold statewide office in New York history.\n\n7. Ingrid Lewis-Martin\n\nChief Adviser to the New York City Mayor\n\nVery few first names cause New York City Hall staffers to snap to attention than Ingrid. Ingrid Lewis-Martin, the chief adviser to Mayor Eric Adams, has positioned herself as a key locus of power within city government. Lewis-Martin officially advises Adams on all personnel moves and issues such as civic engagement, but her influence goes beyond those areas, including as perhaps the mayor’s most trusted aide. Her power derives from the long-standing alliance between her and Adams, which includes her stint as his deputy borough president in Brooklyn.\n\n8. Jumaane Williams\n\nNew York City Public Advocate\n\nWhether it’s taking on the city’s worst landlords, supporting equitable congestion pricing or ending solitary confinement in New York City jails, New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams is on it. Williams has gone from community organizer to the City Council to a job that puts him first in line of succession to the mayoralty. Williams has shown himself adept at taking a job with limited official powers and turning it into a platform where he’s been able to push his agenda through over the objections of Mayor Eric Adams.\n\n9. Crystal Peoples-Stokes\n\nAssembly Majority Leader\n\nCrystal Peoples-Stokes stands out as a trailblazer in New York politics. The first African American woman to serve as majority leader of the Assembly, Peoples-Stokes came to Albany after working as a schoolteacher, in the Buffalo Urban League and Citizen Action of New York and in the Erie County Legislature. A longtime leader on Buffalo’s East Side, Peoples-Stokes has been an advocate for minority- and women-owned businesses and the driving force behind the state’s cannabis legalization law. She is also on the advisory council for the Smithsonian American Women’s History Museum.\n\n10. Jamaal Bailey, Jabari Brisport, Samra Brouk, Cordell Cleare, Leroy Comrie, Robert Jackson, Zellnor Myrie, Kevin Parker, Roxanne Persaud, James Sanders Jr. & Lea Webb\n\nState Senators\n\nState Sen. Jamaal Bailey holds a pair of influential posts: Codes Committee chair and Bronx Democratic leader. In Albany, Bailey is championing legislation to require that all youth questioned by police be given legal consultation.\n\nState Sen. Zellnor Myrie made headlines with the passage of the Clean Slate Act, which will seal many criminal records. The Elections Committee chair – and a potential New York City mayoral candidate – kicked off the 2024 session by passing a voting rights package, including legislation to criminalize voter suppression. State Senate Banks Committee Chair James Sanders Jr. is also celebrating a high-profile legislative victory with the enactment of a measure creating a commission to study reparations for slavery.\n\nA rising star in democratic socialist circles is state Senate Children and Families Committee Chair Jabari Brisport. He has called for the state to raise taxes on top earners and has had some success advocating for increased child care funding.\n\nState Senate Corporations, Authorities and Commissions Chair Leroy Comrie oversees the state’s public authorities, most notably the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. He stalled the governor’s initial Penn Station overhaul, saying a new plan was needed. State Sen. Robert Jackson in 2022 took over the Civil Service and Pensions Committee, a key post due to the heavily unionized public sector workforce in New York. Jackson, who fended off a primary challenger backed by Rep. Adriano Espaillat in 2022, is a staunch advocate for increased public education funding in New York City.\n\nState Senate Mental Health Committee Chair Samra Brouk has been focused on doula care, issuing a report on doulas while trying to increase access to doulas in childbirth. The Rochester senator attended a White House meeting with first lady Jill Biden on national child care policy last year. State Senate Social Services Committee Chair Roxanne Persaud is targeting domestic violence, including unveiling a report on the state of domestic violence prevention and care. She has opposed a migrant shelter at Brooklyn’s Floyd Bennett Field, saying it’s unsafe for migrants. State Senate Aging Committee Chair Cordell Cleare is focused on issues facing senior citizens. Cleare criticized Gov. Kathy Hochul for vetoing the Grieving Families Act and said the governor needed to work with lawmakers on a compromise.\n\nWomen’s Issues Committee Chair Lea Webb is the first Black woman to represent Broome County in the state Senate. The former Binghamton City Council member began the 2024 session by passing a reproductive rights and maternal health package.\n\nState Senate Energy and Telecommunications Committee Chair Kevin Parker is aiming to address climate change and bolster the electric grid. Parker is facing a lawsuit, filed under the state’s Adult Survivors Act, that accuses him of raping a woman in 2004. The governor called the allegations “disturbing” but did not call on him to resign, and the state Senate has weighed action against him, but as of now he remains chair of the energy committee.\n\n11. George Gresham\n\nPresident, 1199SEIU\n\nIt’s not easy when the buck stops with you and you’re in charge of the largest health care workers union in the nation, but George Gresham has been serving as president of 1199SEIU since 2007 and continues to push his influence in city government. Gresham was a leading voice in favor of tenant protections during last year’s state legislative session. In addition to playing a critical role in negotiating contracts and working conditions, he is also on several boards including that of the NAACP.\n\n12. Damian Williams, Breon Peace & Trini Ross\n\nU.S. Attorneys, Southern, Eastern and Western Districts of New York\n\nAs the top federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams is following his predecessors’ path of launching high-profile cases. Williams is prosecuting U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, the first time in history a sitting senator has been alleged to be working for a foreign government. Williams is pushing for a federal takeover of Rikers Island and he made national headlines for convicting cryptocurrency king Sam Bankman-Fried on fraud charges. His next big target could be New York City Mayor Eric Adams.\n\nThe top federal prosecutor on Long Island, Breon Peace, is at the center of one of the most high-profile cases in the country: the prosecution of former Rep. George Santos. Last year Peace was named to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland’s advisory committee, giving him a role in shaping national criminal justice policy.\n\nU.S. Attorney Trini Ross is not just leading federal law enforcement in the Buffalo area but also helping to shape national policy. Also a member of Garland’s advisory committee, Ross chairs a subcommittee focused on assisting victims, community relations policy and better coordination between law enforcement.\n\n13. Rowan Wilson\n\nChief Judge, State Court of Appeals\n\n“If I think of myself as an important person, I will not do my job well,” Rowan Wilson said when he took office as New York’s chief judge. That’s the level of humility New York’s first Black chief judge brings to his role leading the state Court of Appeals and the state’s judiciary. Wilson is a liberal-leaning jurist who from 2017 to his appointment as chief judge was an associate judge of the Court of Appeals. Wilson – who was elevated after lawmakers blocked the governor’s first pick – has helped expand workers’ and defendants’ rights and played a pivotal role in the court’s decision to order another round of redistricting for the state’s congressional seats.\n\n14. Sheena Wright, Anne Williams-Isom & Phil Banks\n\nNew York City First Deputy Mayor; New York City Deputy Mayors\n\nNew York City First Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright, who has long been part of Mayor Eric Adams’ inner circle, focuses on strategic initiatives, overseeing such agencies as the Office of Management and Budget, and the Office of Policy and Planning. Wright, who was promoted to first deputy mayor in January 2023, has worked on a variety of issues including the MyCity portal and a new child care strategy.\n\nAnother confidant and longtime ally of Adams is Phil Banks, who presides over the city’s public safety apparatus as deputy mayor for public safety. The former NYPD chief of department has taken a key role in developing police policy, a key priority for the mayor. Banks also oversees the city’s beleaguered Department of Correction and the Fire Department. Banks has declined to comment on speculation that he is planning to exit City Hall.\n\nThe city’s deputy mayor for health and human services, Anne Williams-Isom is at the center of one of the biggest issues facing the city – the migrant crisis – and is overseeing the housing and care of the buses of migrants arriving from Texas. She has also focused on women’s health and domestic violence prevention.\n\n15. David Banks\n\nChancellor, New York City Department of Education\n\nAs New York City’s chief educator, David Banks brings a wealth of experience in education and community engagement to the job. Before becoming chancellor, Banks was a principal and founded Black EdFluencers United, an organization dedicated to raising awareness of systemic racism within schools. Banks has made improving the city’s “dismal literacy rates” the centerpiece of his agenda. Banks said he’s staking his entire reputation on it, because if you don’t get literacy rates up, “all these other things don’t really matter.”\n\n16. Jeffrion Aubry, Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, Pamela Hunter, Kimberly Jean-Pierre, J. Gary Pretlow, Karines Reyes, Michaelle Solages, Clyde Vanel & Latrice Walker\n\nAssembly Members\n\nAssembly Member Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn derives more power as Brooklyn Democratic boss than as majority whip in Albany, but the chair of a subcommittee on minority- and women-owned businesses is no slouch as a legislator. During the Brooklyn Democrats’ annual holiday party, she outlined a political agenda anchored in winning the House speakership for Rep. Hakeem Jeffries and keeping fellow Brooklynite Chuck Schumer in the Senate majority leader’s office.\n\nAssembly Member Michaelle Solages, who chairs the Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic & Asian Caucus, raised her profile recently when Gov. Kathy Hochul signed the Long Islander’s legislation on a commission that will study reparations and develop recommendations. Assembly Member Karines Reyes, who chairs the Puerto Rican/Hispanic Task Force, was miffed that state Court of Appeals Associate Judge Jenny Rivera was not considered for the chief judge post. Reyes passed legislation to allow for expanded early mail ballot access last year. Assembly Member Latrice Walker, the Election Law Committee chair, has been a staunch defender of state bail reforms, staging hunger strikes in a failed bid to prevent lawmakers from rolling back the reforms.\n\nSpeaker Pro Tempore Jeffrion Aubry is in his last year in Albany, though the veteran criminal justice reform advocate is not slowing down. Aubry is pushing legislation to allow Mets owner Steve Cohen to build a casino on Citi Field’s parking lot. And with a downstate casino expansion looming, Racing and Wagering Committee Chair J. Gary Pretlow is also at the center of the action – while sponsoring legislation to allow online gambling in the state.\n\nAssembly Member Kimberly Jean-Pierre declared her first year as Veterans Affairs Committee chair a “success” after passing a number of bills supporting military veterans. Assembly Pamela Hunter also took the reins of a new committee last year. The Banks Committee chair has offered reassurances that the banking system is safe following a string of bank shutdowns and is exploring banking access in the cannabis industry. Assembly Member Clyde Vanel, who chairs both the Committee on Oversight, Analysis and Investigation and the Subcommittee on Internet and New Technology, is a futurist focusing on artificial intelligence and technological innovations.\n\n17. Alvin Bragg & Darcel Clark\n\nManhattan District Attorney; Bronx District Attorney\n\nAlvin Bragg may not have the longevity of some of his predecessors as Manhattan district attorney, but he’s the only one to have taken a lead role in a case involving a former president. Bragg was the first prosecutor in the country to file criminal charges against former President Donald Trump, kicking off a series of Trump indictments from other prosecutors spanning three states and the District of Columbia.\n\nDarcel Clark easily captured a third term as Bronx district attorney last year, after dispatching a challenger in the Democratic primary. Last year, Clark announced her support for a package of parole reform bills in the state Legislature. In December, Clark announced that her office would be joining several other city agencies to investigate a Bronx building collapse in order to see if any criminal charges are warranted.\n\n18. Al Sharpton\n\nFounder and President, National Action Network\n\nOne of the best known civil rights activists in New York City and the country, the Rev. Al Sharpton has been active in the civil rights space since the late 1960s. In 1991, Sharpton founded the National Action Network, and then sought a U.S. Senate seat in 1992, finishing in third place in the Democratic primary. A political powerhouse, Sharpton hosts a well known MSNBC show and is a commissioner of the U.S. Commission on the Social Status of Black Men and Boys.\n\n19. Twyla Carter\n\nAttorney-in-Chief and CEO, Legal Aid Society\n\nTwyla Carter has the double distinction of being the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead Legal Aid Society in its 145-year history. As attorney-in-chief and CEO, Carter contributes to the society’s mission of ensuring justice for marginalized individuals. She also served as senior staff attorney for the ACLU. Carter has been focused on defending New York City’s right to shelter, in light of Mayor Eric Adams trying to unravel the policy.\n\n20. Gregory Meeks\n\nMember of Congress\n\nRep. Gregory Meeks wields power internationally, in Washington and at home in Queens. The top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Meeks chaired the committee under the Democratic majority and could reclaim the gavel if Democrats take the majority in November. Following the indictment of former Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair Bob Menendez over alleged bribes from Egyptian officials, Meeks called for a halt on aid to Egypt. He also praised President Joe Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war. Back in New York, Meeks runs the Queens Democratic Party, putting him in the thick of party politics, including the special election to replace former Rep. George Santos.\n\n21. Ritchie Torres\n\nMember of Congress\n\nSince his election to the New York City Council, Democrat Ritchie Torres has staked out a role as a vocal advocate for the Bronx and a political leader on the rise. Torres, now a member of Congress, has become one of the most vocal supporters of Israel in its war against Hamas. Torres grew up in poverty in public housing in the Bronx, which informs his vocal advocacy for affordable housing. He is also the first out gay Afro Latino person elected to Congress.\n\n22. Selvena Brooks-Powers, Amanda Farías, Kamillah Hanks, Crystal Hudson, Rita Joseph, Farah Louis, Darlene Mealy, Mercedes Narcisse, Sandy Nurse, Chi Osse, Kevin Riley, Pierina Sanchez, Althea Stevens & Nantasha Williams\n\nNew York City Council Members\n\nThe biggest winner in the New York City Council’s recent game of musical chairs is Amanda Farías, who supplanted a colleague as majority leader despite – or rather because of – her relatively short time in office. The Afro Latina lawmaker remains chair of the Economic Development Committee, a post she has used to promote the city’s industrial zones, support manufacturing and make ferries more affordable. Farías joins what’s now an all-female leadership team that includes Council Speaker Adrienne Adams as well as Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, an Adams ally who’s staying put in her dual roles as majority whip and chair of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.\n\nOne of the biggest shifts is Council Member Sandy Nurse’s move from Sanitation Committee chair to leading the Criminal Justice Committee, which immediately makes her a point person on hot-button issues like the recently vetoed measure to ban solitary confinement in city jails. Nurse is stepping up to co-chair the legislative body’s Progressive Caucus as well.\n\nCouncil Member Farah Louis is also on the move, from the helm of the Landmarks, Public Sitings and Dispositions Subcommittee to leading the Women and Gender Equity Committee. Louis has prioritized domestic violence prevention and maternal health.\n\nMany other committee chairs were unchanged. Council Member Rita Joseph, a former New York City public school teacher, oversees the city’s public schools in a key role as Education Committee chair. Council Member Pierina Sanchez still chairs the Committee on Housing and Buildings and Council Member Althea Stevens chairs the Children and Youth Committee. Council Member Mercedes Narcisse continues to monitor major health care institutions as Hospitals Committee chair, while Council Member Crystal Hudson is the Aging Committee chair and co-chair of the LGBTQIA+ Caucus. As Civil and Human Rights Committee chair, Council Member Nantasha Williams has presided over debates on reparations legislation and providing for a marker at the site of New York state’s first slave market.\n\nCouncil Member Kevin Riley, who’s chairing the Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee for another term, has been in the thick of the land use process and the push for more affordable housing. Council Member Kamillah Hanks traded being chair of the Public Safety Committee for the role of leading the Landmarks, Public Sitings and Dispositions Subcommittee. At the helm of another subcommittee is Council Member Darlene Mealy, who heads the Subcommittee on Senior Centers and Food Insecurity.\n\nCouncil Member Chi Ossé, meanwhile, discovered that bucking Council Speaker Adrienne Adams seemingly has consequences. The young lawmaker lost his chair of the Cultural Affairs Committee after voting against the budget – and no longer has a ticket to the annual Met Gala that came with the post.\n\n23. Stacy Lynch\n\nChief of Staff, Office of the Governor\n\nStacy Lynch serves as the chief of staff to Gov. Kathy Hochul, bringing deep experience in government to the role having been chief of staff for former Lt. Gov. Brian Benjamin and then a senior adviser to Hochul. Lynch is also well-versed in New York City politics, previously holding top spots for former Mayor Bill de Blasio. While in City Hall, Lynch helped launch projects like Brothers Thrive, an initiative spearheaded by former first lady Chirlane McCray to remove the disparities for Black men in mental health care.\n\n24. Camille Joseph Varlack\n\nChief of Staff, New York City Mayor’s Office\n\nCamille Joseph Varlack currently serves as the chief of staff to New York City Mayor Eric Adams, moving to one of the top jobs in city government from her former position as Adams’ senior adviser. Varlack has been weighing in on the city’s migrant crisis, and is an immigrant herself. She came to New York from Trinidad and Tobago as a child and was inspired to go into public service by her mother.\n\n25. Adrienne Harris\n\nSuperintendent, State Department of Financial Services\n\nNew York sits at the center of the world’s financial markets, and Adrienne Harris is the state’s top regulator of the banking and insurance industries. Harris’ Department of Financial Services seized control of Signature Bank last spring, a key step in the government’s response to a string of bank failures. She now has her hands full crafting regulations for the growing cryptocurrency industry. Harris has greatly expanded the department from three people to over 60, and her regulatory approach has been cited as a model for federal regulators and other states. Harris has said she wants New York to be the “gold standard” of crypto regulation.\n\n26. John B. King Jr.\n\nChancellor, State University of New York\n\nHailing from a long line of Brooklyn educators, it’s no surprise that John King entered education. King brings a background as state education commissioner and U.S. education secretary in the Obama administration to SUNY’s top job. King, who started at SUNY last year, said that while budget circumstances will require cuts to academic programs at campuses, he does not see any SUNY schools needing to close. King has outlined an ambitious agenda including proposals to increase student success, new diversity initiatives and a goal to expand SUNY’s research and economic development impact.\n\n27. Bill Thompson\n\nChair, City University of New York\n\nA venerable leader in New York City government, education and finance, Bill Thompson has served since 2016 as chair of the board of trustees of the City University of New York. Thompson has guided the public higher education system, a key social mobility engine in the city, while recently navigating the debate over antisemitism in the city. Thompson, a former city comptroller, ran for mayor in 2009 and 2013. He’s also a partner at the investment firm Siebert Cisneros Shank & Co., a prominent minority- and women-owned firm.\n\n28. Yusef Salaam & Chris Banks\n\nNew York City Council Members\n\nYusef Salaam has earned a place in New York City history as one of the most remarkable paths to political office. A member of the Central Park Five, once wrongly jailed for a rape he did not commit and eventually exonerated, Salaam defeated two sitting state legislators last year to win a Harlem seat in the City Council. Salaam will now have police oversight powers as chair of the Public Safety Committee.\n\nA fellow newcomer to the City Council this year is Chris Banks. For the first time in over two decades, East New York is not represented on the City Council by a member of the Barron family. After initially falling short against both Charles and Inez Barron, Banks unseated Charles Barron in June’s Democratic primary to seize the seat.
