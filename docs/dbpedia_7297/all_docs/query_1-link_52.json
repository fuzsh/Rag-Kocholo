        "text": "Ballet Nègre gives its debut performance at the annual Beaux Arts Ball in Chicago. One of the numbers on the program is Negro Rhapsody, which is well received. No engagements follow, and the group disbands.\n\nDunham marries Jordis McCoo, a postal worker. Although he dances in some of her productions, he does not share her interests. They gradually drift apart.\n\nIn a Chicago Opera production, Dunham dances the leading role in Ruth Page's ballet La Guiablesse (The Devil Woman). Based on a Martinican legend, it has an all-black cast. Dunham continues to appear as a guest artist with the Chicago Opera, where she acts as assistant to its ballet director, Ruth Page.\n\nDunham revives her company, Ballet Nègre, with students from her school, the Negro Dance Group. Works in the repertory choreographed by Dunham include Spanish Dance and Fantasie Nègre.\n\nDunham and her company appear at the Chicago World's Fair.\n\nDunham receives a grant from the Julius Rosenwald Fund to study the dances of the West Indies. After a course of study with Melville Herskovitz, head of the anthropology department at Northwestern University, she embarks for the Caribbean with letters of introduction written by Herskovits to Haitian anthropologist Dr. Jean Price-Mars, Colonel Simon Rowe of the Maroon people of Jamaica, President Stenio Vincent of Haiti, and other government officials and scholars in Haiti.\n\nDunham arrives in Whitehall, Jamaica, whence she travels to the mountain village of Accompong. After a brief stay, she travels to Martinique and Trinidad. She conducts anthropological fieldwork wherever she goes.\n\nDunham and her company make a one-time appearance at the Young Men's Hebrew Association (YMHA) on Ninety-second Street in New York City, joining African and African-American modern dancers Edna Guy, Alison Burroughs, Clarence Yates, and Asadata Dafora for A Negro Dance Evening. On the first half of the program, Dunham presents a suite of West Indian dances. In the second half of the program, \"Modern Trends,\" Dunham presents Tropic Death, which casts Talley Beatty as the fugitive from a lynch mob.\n\nAs part of the suite called Primitive Rhythms, Dunham premieres Rara Tonga at the Goodman Theater in Chicago. It will subsequently be performed as an independent work.\n\nDunham and her dancers premiere Tropics at the Abraham Lincoln Center in Chicago. The suite of dances includes Woman with a Cigar.\n\nDunham choreographs and produces her first full-length ballet, L'Ag'Ya, which debuts in January at the Federal Theater, Chicago. Based on a fable of love, jealousy, and revenge, culminating in a staged version of the ag'ya, the fighting dance of Martinique, Dunham's ballet became part of the repertory of Ballet Fedré, a component of the Federal Theater Project, at the Great Northern Theater.\n\nRead notes on the ballet L'Ag'Ya\n\nView video clips of L'Ag'Ya and Katherine Dunham:\n\nPas de deux from L'Ag'Ya\n\nMazouk from L'Ag'Ya\n\nCharm Dance from L'Ag'Ya\n\nAg'Ya Fight from L'Ag'Ya\n\nKatherine Dunham on L'Ag'Ya\n\nKatherine Dunham on \"Mazouk\" from L'Ag'Ya\n\nTropics is performed at the Goodman Theater in Chicago.\n\nDunham is named director of the Negro Unit of the Chicago branch of the Federal Theater Project and stages dances in several Chicago productions, including Run Li'l Chil'lun and The Emperor Jones.\n\nDunham choreographs A las Montanas, one of her first solos, and dances it at the Abraham Lincoln Center in Chicago.\n\nDunham submits a thesis entitled \"Dances of Haiti: Their Social Organization, Classification, Form, and Function\" to the Department of Anthropology at the University of Chicago in partial fulfillment of the requirements for a Master of Arts degree.\n\nDunham choreographs and performs in Barrelhouse, a duet. It is one of her earliest works of Americana.\n\nRead notes on Barrelhouse\n\nDunham choreographs Son (Sound) and, in October 1938, introduces it into the suite Primitive Rhythms. On a Caribbean island plantation, a slave sings a love song while his companions work. A girl becomes possessed, dances herself into a frenzy, and falls exhausted.\n\nKatherine Dunham and Jordis McCoo divorce.\n\nKatherine Dunham and Dance Company perform for the Quadres Society of the University of Cincinnati.\n\nDunham begins her film career with Carnival of Rhythm, a short film written by Stanley Martin, directed by Jean Negulesco, and produced by Warner Brothers is devoted entirely to her, her company, and her choreography. She, Archie Savage, and Talley Beatty are the stars. Released in 1941, it includes Ciudad Maravillosa and early versions of Los Indios, Batucada , and Adeus Terras. All are based on Brazilian themes.\n\nKatherine Dunham and Dance Company perform Tropics and Le Jazz \"Hot\" in the College Inn Panther Room at the Hotel Sherman in Chicago.\n\nDunham choreographs Bahiana, which premieres at a concert at the University of Cincinnati. Set to music by Don Alfonso, it concerns a woman of Bahia, Brazil, who dances and sings as she becomes entwined in the ropes of a group of dockside rope weavers at work. This number would become one of Dunham's most celebrated characterizations and would remain in her repertory throughout the 1940s.\n\nPublished under the pseudonym Kaye Dunn and the heading \"Sketchbook of a Young Dancer in La Martinique,\" two articles by Dunham appear in Esquire: \"La Boule Blanche\" (September 1939) and \"L'Ag'ya of Martinique\" (November 1939).\n\nDunham begins work on Broadway. She is invited to contribute new material to the popular musical revue Pins and Needles, produced by the International Ladies Garment Workers' Union Players. For the second edition, entitled Pins and Needles 1940, she creates a dance to music by Harold Rome for \"Bertha, the Sewing Machine Girl, or It's Better with a Union Man.\" Archie Savage is among the dancers.\n\nFor the American Negro Light Opera Association of Chicago, Dunham stages and choreographs Tropical Pinafore, a takeoff on the popular Gilbert and Sullivan work. The costumes are designed by John Pratt.\n\nAs Pins and Needles 1940 continues its run at the Windsor Theater, New York, Dunham books her own company into the theater for a Sunday performance, which is so popular that the company repeats the Sunday performances for another ten weeks. These concerts, billed as Tropics and Le Jazz \"Hot,\" consist of dances based on Latin American and Caribbean sources (Island Song, Tropic-Shore Excursion, and Woman with a Cigar) and dances based on African-American sources (Br'er Rabbit an' de Tah Baby, Flaming Youth, 1927, and Floyd's Guitar Blues ).\n\nDunham remounts scenes from the Spanish Earth, originally choreographed as a benefit for Spanish Civil War victims, at New York's Windsor Theater,\n\nThe Dunham Company opens the nightclub at the Hotel Sherman in Chicago with a repertory that includes the Polynesian-influenced Rara Tonga, Barrelhouse , Bre'r Rabbit an' de Tah Baby, Cakewalk, and Woman with a Cigar. George Balanchine and Vernon Duke see a performance and invite Dunham and her company to come to New York to perform in a new Broadway show.\n\nDunham collaborates with Balanchine on choreography for dances in the musical play Cabin in the Sky. The show opens at the Martin Beck Theater in October 1940 and runs until March 1941, playing 156 performances.\n\nRead notes on Cabin in the Sky .\n\nImpresario Sol Hurok presents Katherine Dunham and her company in Tropical Revue, which opens at New York's Martin Beck Theater. The show is billed as \"a musical heatwave … voodoo! Boogie! Shimmy! jazz and jive! primitive rites!\" The show opens with lively Latin American and Caribbean dances and, in the second part, a dramatic ballet, such as Rites de Passage or L'Ag'Ya , is featured. The finale usually consists of plantation dances, dances set to Negro spirituals, and American social dances. The original two-week engagement is extended by popular demand into a three-month run. After eighty-seven performances on Broadway, the company takes the show on a national tour.\n\nDunham and her company appear in the film Stormy Weather, a show-business story starring Bill Robinson and Lena Horne.\n\nRead notes on Stormy Weather .\n\nIn January, Dunham premieres Choros (nos. 1-5) at the Royal Alexandra Theatre, Toronto. Set to music by Vidaco Gogliano, Choros is a stylized version of a nineteenth-century Brazilian quadrille. Two of the sections (nos. 1 and 4) would later be joined and performed as an independent work.\n\nIn February, Flaming Youth, 1927 premieres in New Britain, Connecticut. The scene is a small Chicago nightclub, where a hostess wearily awaits the arrival of customers. The women are dressed as flappers, in knee-length beaded dresses and cloche hats; the men wear slickers and raccoon coats; a gigolo sports a satin shirt. They dance the Charleston, the Black Bottom, the Mooch, the Fishtail, and Snake Hips. A drunken woman starts a fight. The police are called.\n\nThe Dunham School of Dance and Theater opens in New York in Caravan Hall (Isadora Duncan's former studio) on West Fifty-ninth Street.\n\nDunham and her company appear in such clubs as Chez Paree in Chicago, El Rancho Hotel and the Trocadero in Las Vegas, and Ciro's in Hollywood.\n\nTropical Review appears for one week at Cleveland's Hanna Theater. Plain Dealer critic William F. Mc Dermott writes that the show \"is frantic in movement, primitive in feeling, bold in suggestion and yet it is projected with a finesse and adroitness based on discipline, control and intelligence…. Miss Dunham is a show woman of great deftness, both as a director and as a performer.\"\n\nIn October, Dunham addresses the all-white audience at Memorial Auditorium in Louisville, Kentucky, in a curtain speech in which she speaks out against segregation. \"It makes me very happy to know that you have liked us . . .,\" she says, \"but tonight our hearts are very sad because this is a farewell to Louisville. . . . I have discovered that your management will not allow people like you to sit next to people like us. I hope that time and the unhappiness of this war for tolerance and democracy . . . will change some of these things. Perhaps then we can return.\"\n\nThe Dunham School in New York moves to 220 West 43rd Street, where it will continue to operate until 1957.\n\nTropical Review tours to Los Angeles, where critic Edwin Schallert raves that \"Miss Dunham virtually had the audience tearing down the house at times with applause, and there was hardly a moment of her varied program that did not intrigue with its strange veerings from violence to languor\" (Los Angeles Times, 9 April 1945).\n\nThe Katherine Dunham Dancers appear at the Belasco Theater in New York in Blue Holiday, a Negro variety show starring Ethel Waters. Dunham creates and stages two numbers: \"Voodoo in Haiti,\" featuring Josephine Premice, and \"Fiji Island,\" featuring Lavinia Williams and Talley Beatty. The show closes after eight performances.\n\nDunham choreographs, directs, and stars in the musical play Carib Song, which opens in September at the Adelphi Theater in New York. The finale to the first act is Shango , a staged interpretation of a Vodun ritual that would become a permanent part of her company's repertory.\n\nRead notes on Carib Song and Shango\n\nJohn Pratt is drafted into the U.S. Army, and Dunham assumes charge of the company's costumes and sets, in addition to directing the company.\n\nDunham's article \"Goombay,\" a memoir of her visit to the Maroon people of Jamaica, appears in the November issue of Mademoiselle.\n\nIn January, Dunham premieres Nañigo and La Camparsa, as numbers in the suite Motivos, at the Temple Theater in Portland, Oregon. Nañigo, set to music by Gilberto Valdes, is a choreographic interplay among a group of male practitioners of an Afro-Cuban religious cult. A soloist represents ancient Yoruba dance tradition, while the other dancers perform modern variations. La Camparsa, set to music by Ernesto Lecuona, centers on a lone woman, wandering the streets in the early-morning hours after Carnival, who encounters three men, one of whom she believes may be her husband.\n\nThe Dunham School is now known as the Katherine Dunham School of Arts and Research. Its components are the Dunham School of Dance and Theater, the Department of Cultural Studies, and the Institute for Caribbean Research. Teachers in the Dance Division include Todd Bolender (ballet), Marie Bryant (tap and boogie), and José Limón (modern dance). Dunham Technique is taught by Tommy Gomez, Archie Savage, Lavinia Williams, and Syvilla Fort, who also teaches ballet. Teachers in the Drama Division include Herbert Berghof (acting), John Pratt (visual design), and Karl Vollmoeller (history of drama, play writing). Among performers who study at the school over the years are Arthur Mitchell, James Dean, Peter Gennaro, Marlon Brando, Chita Rivera, Eartha Kitt, and José Ferrer.\n\nDunham's first book is published: Journey to Accompong (New York: Henry Holt, 1946; reprint, Westport, Conn.: Negro Universities Press, 1971). It recounts her experiences among the Maroon people of Jamaica in 1935-1936.\n\nJohn Pratt is discharged from the army. He rejoins the company in time for the production of Bal Nègre, a music and dance revue directed and choreographed by Dunham.\n\nRead notes on Bal Nègre .\n\nIn December, after a nine-month tour, Bal Nègre opens at New York's Belasco Theater. It receives glowing reviews.\n\nBal Nègre attracts attention from European producers, which leads to the company's first European tour and results in an invitation by Doris Duke, the tobacco heiress, to appear in Mexico under a contract with Teatro Americano.\n\nThe Katherine Dunham Experimental Group presents Caribbean Backgrounds at Howard University in Washington, D.C.\n\nDunham choreographs the musical play Windy City, which premieres at the Great Northern Theater in Chicago. The show concerns the character and vitality of the people of Chicago and is said to have influenced Jerome Robbins's choreography for West Side Story.\n\n\"Dances of Haiti,\" Dunham's thesis written for the University of Chicago in 1937, is translated into Spanish by Javier Romero and published as Las danzas de Haití as a special issue of Acta antropológica 2.4 (Mexico, 1947). It will subsequently be published in French as Les danse d'Haïti, with a foreword by Claude Lévi-Strauss (Paris: Éditions Fasquelle, 1950), and in English as Dances of Haiti, with photographs by Patricia Cummings (Center for Afro-American Studies, University of California, Los Angeles, 1983).\n\nRhumba Trio is premiered at Mexico's Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes.\n\nBal Nègre plays at the Geary Theater in San Francisco.\n\nDunham choreographs Angelique, Blues Trio, and Veracuzana for engagements at Ciro's nightclub in Hollywood. Veracruzana will be included in later revues and will become one of Dunham's most popular numbers. In his review of a performance in 1955, Walter Terry writes, \"'Veracruzana' . . . is alive with colorful and humorous incidents and inspired passages of choreography. In this number, one of the most unforgettable of Dunham images is to be found, the sight of the star herself dressed all in white and lolling on an enormous white swing which spans the stage\" (New York Herald Tribune, 23 November 1955).\n\nDunham and her company appear in the film Casbah, a romantic tale of jewel thieves in Algiers starring Yvonne de Carlo, Tony Martin, and Peter Lorre. Dunham (uncredited) appears as Odette; Eartha Kitt appears as herself. Dunham choreographs and stages two scenes: the Ramadan Festival and the Casbah Nightclub.\n\nDunham appears with her company in London at the Prince of Wales Theatre in A Caribbean Rhapsody, a music and dance revue. Theater critic David Lewin notes that \"A first-night audience was bewildered, enthralled, wildly enthusiastic about a new-type musical which exhilarates with its speed and animal primitiveness\" and observed that Dunham \"scored the greatest hit since Danny Kaye\" (Daily Express, 6 May 1948).\n\nDunham delivers an address, \"The State of Cults among the Deprived,\" to the Royal Anthropological Society in London.\n\nDunham and her company perform at the Alhambra Theater in Brussels.\n\nDunham premieres Jazz in Five Movements at the Théâtre National de l'Opéra in Paris.

Louis Armstrong, Fernandel, and Isa Miranda are also featured. Two numbers from the Dunham repertory, Batucada and a segment of Jazz in Five Movements, are included.\n\nDunham choreographs Afrique and a new version of Adeus Terras while in Rome.\n\nKatherine Dunham and John Pratt adopted their daughter Marie-Christine, aged fourteen months, in Paris.\n\nAfter years of mental illness, Dunham's beloved brother Albert dies in Saint Elizabeth's Hospital, Washington, D.C.\n\nDunham purchases Habitation Leclerc, an estate in Haiti said to have been the residence of Pauline Bonaparte Leclerc, sister of Napoleon.\n\nThe Dunham School in New York is renamed the Katherine Dunham School of Cultural Arts.\n\nA photograph of Dunham appears on the front cover of Ballet magazine (March 1952).\n\nDunham is named a chevalier of the Haitian Légion d'Honneur et Merite.\n\nDunham's short story \"Afternoon into Night\" appears in Bandwagon (June 1952). It is later reprinted in Best Short Stories by Negro Writers, edited by Langston Hughes (Boston: Little, Brown, 1967).\n\nDunham and her company perform in Denmark to high critical acclaim. The Berlingske Tidende (12 July) noted that the performance \"became one of the great and rare experiences in which an artist and an artistically managed ensemble quite simply overwhelmed its audience on their first appearance.\" Berlingske Aftenavis (12 July) said that the audience \"was wild with joy and cheered the unrivaled Dunham with hurricanes of applause.\" According to Politiken, the company took ten curtain calls and the Aftenbladet (12 July) claimed that the performance was a gift to Copenhageners, \"the richest and most varied theater evening offered us in a long time.\"\n\nDunham choreographs and performs in Acaraje for Hommage à Dorival Caymmi in Arachon, France.\n\nDunham and her company perform at the Windsor Palace in Barcelona.\n\nDunham and her company tour North Africa (1952-1953).\n\nDunham and her company tour Mexico.\n\nAlong with Carmen Amaya and her flamenco dancers, Dunham and her company appear in the Mexican film Música en la noche. The Dunham Company dances Dora and Cakewalk. The film is released in the United States in 1958.\n\nDunham and her company perform in the Greek Theater, Los Angeles.\n\nSol Hurok presents Katherine Dunham and Her Company in a dance revue in three acts and twelve scenes (i.e., Caribbean Rhapsody) at the Broadway Theater, New York. Dance critic Walter Terry writes, \"Miss Dunham presents one of the handsomest productions you are likely to see in these parts\" (New York Herald Tribune, 23 November 1955). Terry singles out three numbers for special praise: Veracruzana, Rituals (i.e., Rites of Passage), and Barrelhouse . The show closes after thirty-two performances.\n\nDunham's third book is published: A Touch of Innocence: Memoirs of Childhood (New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1959; reprint, University of Chicago Press, 1994). In a note to the reader she says that \"this book is not an autobiography. It is the story of a world that has vanished. . . . And it is the story of a family that I knew very well, and especially of a girl and a young woman whom I rediscovered while writing about the members of this family.\"\n\nDunham and her company embark on their third major European tour, which takes them to Denmark, Germany, France, Greece, and other countries.\n\nKatherine Dunham and John Pratt lease a house in Dakar, Senegal, where she completes the manuscripts for Island Possessed (published in 1969) and a fantasy for young people with a Senegalese setting, Kasamance (published in 1974).\n\nOn her return to Illinois, Dunham collaborates with Buckminster Fuller on a proposal for a cultural arts center in East Saint Louis. Dunham receives a $400,000 grant from the federal Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) but is thwarted by local politicians who do not share her vision.\n\nThe Equal Opportunity Commission, as part of the Southern Illinois University's Experiment in Higher Education, funds Dunham's proposal for creating a Performing Arts Training Center (PATC) in East Saint Louis, which eventually results in an educational center, children's auxiliary company, and a semiprofessional dance group that would tour the midwestern, southern, and eastern United States.\n\nDunham establishes a cultural education program at the Alton campus of Southern Illinois University and, with two former members of the Dunham company, establishes classes at Rock Junior High School in East Saint Louis.\n\nDunham receives an honorary doctorate of fine arts from Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville and is awarded the grande croix of the Légion d'Honneur et Merite by the Haitian embassy.\n\nIn December, Dunham is one of five recipients of the Kennedy Center Honors in Washington, D.C. At the evening performance, Agnes de Mille makes the presentation to Dunham from the stage of the opera house, giving a graceful, affectionate tribute to her friend and showing film clips of some of Dunham's signature works. Dunham and her fellow honorees – singer Frank Sinatra, actor James Stewart, stage and movie director Elia Kazan, and composer and critic Virgil Thomson – watch from the Presidential Box, where they are seated with President and Mrs. Ronald Reagan.\n\nThe Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater produces \"The Magic of Katherine Dunham,\" which opens the Ailey company's 1987-1988 season. Among the works reconstructed under the supervision of Dunham are Choros, L'Ag'Ya, Shango, Flaming Youth, 1927, and Cakewalk.\n\nDunham receives the Ebony Magazine American Achievement Award in Fine Arts and the Candice \"Trailblazer\" Award from the National Coalition of One Hundred Black Women.\n\nDunham is awarded honorary doctorates of fine arts from Tufts University and Buffalo State College.\n\nDunham is named a Founder of Dance in America and is honored as such at the National Museum of Dance in Saratoga Springs, New York External.\n\nDunham is awarded a star on the Saint Louis Walk of Fame for the field of acting and entertainment.\n\nIn November, in the East Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., President George Bush makes the fifth annual presentation of the National Medal of the Arts to nine people in various fields of arts and letters: Alfred Eisenstaedt (photography), Dizzy Gillespie (jazz), John Updike (fiction), Katherine Dunham (dance), Walker Hancock (sculpture), Czeslaw Milosz (poetry), Robert Motherwell (painting), Leopold Adler (historic preservation), and Vladimir Horowitz (music). John Frohnmayer, chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, reads the citations. Dunham is honored \"for her pioneering explorations of Caribbean and African dance, which have enriched and transformed the art of dance in America.\"\n\nDunham reaches the venerable age of ninety, and a large birthday party is planned. Former Dunham dancers, students, friends, and community officials gather to dance for her and to pay tribute to her in East Saint Louis. Although a heavy rainfall causes a last-minute change of venue, the celebration is not dampened. During the course of the evening, a grant from the Illinois Arts Council is announced, and a Smith Award is presented to Dunham by representatives of the Smithsonian Institution. An observer describes Dunham as \"resplendent in pink from the top of her head to her toes.\"\n\nKatherine Dunham is named one of \"America's Irreplaceable Dance Treasures External\" by the Dance Heritage Coalition. The Library of Congress receives $1 million from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation to undertake the Katherine Dunham Legacy Project.\n\nThe superintendent of School District 189 in East Saint Louis and other community leaders present plans for the Katherine Dunham Academy of Performing, Visual, and Cultural Arts. The superintendent attends an institute at City Center in New York in August 2000, during which dance educators consider a pedagogy that incorporates Dunham's methods and ideas about dance and society.\n\nA photograph of Dunham in L'Ag'Ya appears on the front cover of Dance Magazine (August 2000). The feature article in the issue, written by Wendy Perron, is entitled \"Katherine Dunham: One-Woman Revolution.\"\n\nIllinois governor George Ryan announces a $57.4 million educational grant to the East Saint Louis district at a meeting with singer Harry Belafonte and actor Danny Glover, who, at Dunham's request, were conducting a fact-finding mission in East Saint Louis preliminary to seeking funding for cultural and economic development projects.\n\nIn late March, \"A Conversation with Katherine Dunham\" is presented at Barnard College in New York City. Dunham is interviewed by Paul Scolieri, an assistant professor of dance, in a large lecture hall where there is standing room only. Although confined to a wheelchair, Dunham does not seem frail. She notes that she will soon be ninety-five years old but says that she intends to live to be a hundred and forty, because she still has so much to do. The audience responds with applause.\n\nIn April, Katherine Dunham headlines Baila USA, the annual African-American cultural festival in Miami, Florida, sponsored by the Ifé-Ifé Afro-Cuban Dance and Music Ensemble. She teaches a master class, with assistance from Theodore Jamison, and attends a gala performance and a bembé, a traditional party of the Santería religion."
