        "text": "D’Zyre Jones is a senior majoring in computer information systems with a concentration in cyber security and minor in graphic design. She is part of a variety of organizations on campus, including student government, which she credits with cultivating her into the bold and vivacious young Black woman she is today. For the 2019-2021 academic year, she was the vice president of the School of Business Student Council, where she prioritized creating a more gender-neutral, LGBT+ friendly environment at the School of Business and providing students with the resources they need to succeed. Jones is a mental health first aid-certified mentor to with Mentoring Youth and Teens Health (MYTH) and the 2020-2021 programming chair for the Howard Chapter where they focus on bringing awareness to mental health in the Black community. Additionally, she is a cadet in the Air Force ROTC program, a member of the National Congress of Negro Women, and a content writer for HERCampus Howard chapter. She is also part of the Student Life and Activities team of student workers where she helps with programming ideas to facilitate a closer connection between Howard faculty and Howard Students.\n\nJones’s favorite thing about Howard is the people—not just students, but professors, staff, faculty, and everyone in between. When she first stepped on campus, she was “graced with everything I thought Black people were and were not.” According to Jones, Howard chose her as much as she chose Howard; once she visited, she knew Howard was the epitome of Black excellence and that it would be her home. The most important lesson Jones has learned at Howard is, in her words, that “what’s for you will not pass you…It took me years to understand that Allah had already carved my path and if it’s not for me right now it’s okay— I’m okay — but if it was really for me it will come back, meaning it never passed.”\n\nNira Headen is a senior afro-american studies and sports administration double major, Spanish minor from Baltimore, Maryland. She is very active on campus, with affiliations and leadership roles including serving as the elections commissioner, social action chair of Alpha Chapter, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., and president of the National Panhellenic Council, to name a few. In addition to her impressive campus participation and academic work, Headen has excelled in various internships during her time at Howard, with positions at Howard University Men's Basketball Team and Sports Information Department, Under Armor, the NBA, Growth by Design Talent and an internship with TLS Talent Agency. Nira is passionate about sports and racial equality and she seeks to utilize sports to make the world a better place.Headen’s favorite thing about Howard is having the space to be unapologetically Black. She states from her classwork and internships to the fashion she wears, her Blackness is celebrated. Ironically, Headen did not want to attend Howard at first, as she has a family legacy at Howard and wanted her own experience. However, after visiting a friend at Howard and attending a lecture, Headen knew that Howard would mold her into the Black woman sports executive that she wants to be. The most important lesson that she has learned is that excellence is earned: “As a student, you are flooded with emails of awards and grants won by the University and so you start to want the same for yourself. But your friends, classmates, professors, and advisors will not give it to you; you must earn it.”\n\nA native of South Carolina, Chadwick Boseman graduated from Howard University and attended the British American Dramatic Academy at Oxford, after which he began his career as an actor, director and writer.
