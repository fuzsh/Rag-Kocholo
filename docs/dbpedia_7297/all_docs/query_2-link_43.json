        "text": "Desert Island Objects: Howard Hodgkin Selects\n\nby John Guy, V&A Album, 1986\n\nIn 1986, Howard Hodgkin spoke to John Guy about his favourite items in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.\n\n‘ During our tour, one was aware of the painter’s eye at work, constantly seeking objects which offered satisfying solutions to the most formal problems of design through the value assigned to colour, texture and materials to create the correct degree of surface tension. Howard Hodgkin’s ten objects draw on the full cultural eclecticism and diversity of media which characterises the V&A. The search for shared design values across cultures and materials is perhaps the element which most unites these objects in a common vision, together with a horror vacui, that fear of empty spaces which underlies the impulse to adorn.\n\nHoward Hodgkin began with the 1937 evening jacket designed by Charles James (Fig. 1), “One of the most original fashion designers of the twentieth century”. “It is like a piece of architecture applied to the body and yet produces an effect of total glamour, achieved with great economy (really just a piece of old eiderdown). The jacket has a presence and autonomy which renders the wearer almost incidental, simply a prop on which to display the strong arabesque forms which stand away from the body with a life of their own”. ‘"
