Some key contrasts: â†’ Families are bound by blood. Teams are assembled by merit first. â†’ Families tolerate all performance. Teams demand excellence. â†’ Families are forever. Teams will evolve and grow. Here's a snippet from Netflix's careers page: \"Netflix Culture â€” Seeking Excellence We model ourselves on being a professional sports team, not a family. A family is about unconditional love. A dream team is about pushing yourself to be the best possible teammate, caring intensely about your team, and knowing that you may not be on the team forever. Dream teams are about performance, not seniority or tenure. It is up to the manager to ensure that every player is amazing at their position, plays effectively with others and is given new opportunities to develop. Thatâ€™s how we keep winning the championship (entertaining the world). Unlike a sports team, as Netflix grows, the number of players also grows. We work to foster players from the development leagues so they can become the stars of tomorrow.\" -- So. Why does this matter? Because confusing the two can lead to challenges as you try to reach your next phase of growth. You need A players to become a category defining company. A players want to work with other A players.\n\nThe foundation of Netflix's winning culture? \"We are not a family\" â€” we operate like a pro sports team.
