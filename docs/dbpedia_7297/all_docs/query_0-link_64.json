You‚Äôve been with me through it all, from the first stage play to now, and I don‚Äôt take that lightly.\n\nYour love and support have been a constant source of strength for me, and I‚Äôm so incredibly grateful for every one of you. Of course, I must also thank Oprah and the many black actresses in Hollywood who inspired me.\n\nWhen I started, I never could have imagined we‚Äôd come this far together. I‚Äôve always said that my stories are yours, and that‚Äôs the truth. Everything I create, I do with you in mind. I want you to feel seen, heard and understood. I want you to laugh, cry, and think about life in ways you may haven‚Äôt before.\n\nI‚Äôm still working hard to bring you more‚Äîmore laughter, inspiration, and stories that reflect the beauty and complexity of our lives. As long as you‚Äôre with me, I‚Äôll keep pushing forward, creating from a place of love and purpose.\n\nSo, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for sharing this journey with me. I appreciate you more than words can express, and I can‚Äôt wait to share what‚Äôs next.\n\nStay blessed, and keep the faith.\n\nTyler Perry\n\nTyler Perry Studios\n\nAtlanta, Georgia\n\nWhat People Are Saying‚Ä¶"
