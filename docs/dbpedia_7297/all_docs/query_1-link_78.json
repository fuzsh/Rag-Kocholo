        "text": "Selznick International and MGM Make a Deal\n\nLet’s Go to the Movies\n\nSelznick and Sam Goldwyn Not on Same Page\n\nDuring the month of February 1938 Selznick and Sidney Howard were working hard on a script that would use every prominent line possible from the book.\n\nOverall film length was a concern, but they hoped to have a script, that would meet their expectations as to content and running time, ready when cameras rolled. Selznick was so concerned with the overall length that he admonished Cukor to be careful not to add extra lines during the shooting process. Those line changes at the time might give the actors something fresh to work with, however in the long run they would be counter productive as they would end up adding dialogue and as a consequence too much to the overall length of the film.\n\nGary Cooper was high on Selznick’s list for the role of Rhett Butler and he was trying to put a deal together with Sam Goldwyn that would have United Artist distribute the film – but only as a package that included Gary Cooper. Sam Goldwyn was traveling to Europe and left on his trip before Selznick got any kind of agreement. And as a consequence Gary Cooper was taken off the number one prospect list to play Rhett Butler.\n\nHowever, the concern over losing Cooper was short lived. The search teams out looking for Scarlett and supporting actors were being peppered with questions by book fans that were asking for Clark Gable. As the chorus grew louder the press picked up the fans enthusiasm and it soon became obvious that Gable was the public choice.\n\nSelznick had not overlooked Gable, but in the early going he had little luck in making a deal with MGM for the loan of their biggest star. It was also known to Hollywood insiders that Gable didn’t want to be the stand-alone star in the film in case it was a dud. And secondly he didn’t want to do a Southern accent.\n\nOf course Louis B. Mayer head of MGM might have something to say on the matter. And sometime in May 1938 Mayer posed the idea to Selznick to allow MGM to buy the property from Selznick International and produce the picture at MGM. The positive element in that proposal was the certainty that Clark Gable would play Rhett Butler and satisfy public demand.\n\nDavid Selznick gave Mayer’s offer considerable thought, but after talking it over with Jock Whitney, the original champion of the film, Selznick said no.\n\nOf course MGM had opened the door to possible negotiations and within a week they began to work on a deal. Louis B. Mayer had mentioned two of the most important issues in his original proposition to buy the film, Gable and distribution.\n\nAt the time those talks were going on between Selznick and Mayer the public was growing more vocal in its demand that Gable to play Rhett Butler. And in the end they got their wish because with the help of Jock Whitney securing more financing a deal was struck where MGM would loan Gable to Selznick International along with a million and a quarter dollars and distribution rights. Selznick International would in turn give up fifty percent of the films profit. A terrible deal on the surface, but the finance situation being what it was with Selznick, he likely figured half a loaf was better than none.\n\n(To be continued)\n\nAnother part of ‘The Story Behind Gone With The Wind’\n\nBy Sally Trippett Rains author of ‘The Making of a Classic.’\n\nCreative Book Publishers International\n\n(Continued from last week)\n\n“I was very close to Mr. Selznick,” Marcella Rabwin said. “People always said, ‘what did you do?’ and I say, ‘anything he didn’t have time for.’ I was involved in every phase of the production of his films from the beginning when you bought the thing to the time when it was finished and you could breathe again.” According to her (Marcella Rabwin) the film cost “four million, eighty-five thousand, seven hundred and ninety dollars.” Selznick’s original plan was for a movie that lasted 2 ½ hours and cost about two million. At that time it was the most expensive film ever made or even imagined. As noted by Tom Barnes, Selznick had originally turned away from buying the rights to Margaret Mitchell’s very famous book, but his money-man Jock Whitney--urged on by Kay Brown-- told him that if Selznick did not buy it, then Whitney was going to. “We had no idea of the enormous task ahead of us when we took it on,” said Marcella Rabwin. “That book (Gone With The Wind) had become such a Bible to so many people---there were 20 million copies of the book sold in the first year. The first time we ran it as a consecutive piece of work it was five hours, and I didn’t know how he was going to cut it. Every minute of it was a beauty but still he had to get it down to what it was; 3 hours and 45 minutes.” The year 2009 marks the 70th Anniversary of Gone With The Wind's movie premiere in Atlanta, Georgia. Author Sally Tippett Rains has interviewed over 70 people involved with the movie including actors, historians, and other authors. She was fortunate enough to work with one of Margaret Mitchell's cousins who has a scrapbook full of stories from her own family. Many of the stories that had been passed down from Mitchell's relatives who lived through the Civil War were similar to stories in Gone With The Wind. In her upcoming book The Making Of A Classic, Margaret Mitchell and Gone With The Wind. Rains gives insight into how Mitchell may have come to write about her various characters and stories. She worked with Tom Barnes on a chapter where there was a cross-over from one of his books, Doc Holliday's Road To Tombstone with Gone With The Wind. It seems Doc Holliday was a cousin to Margaret Mitchell. He had a special relationship with another of her cousins, Mattie Holliday (who was also his cousin.) Barnes' research tells him it was love, but it was unrequited, for he left to go out West. According to Barnes' book, after the Gunfight at OK Corral she realized he was never coming back. She joined the convent and changed her name to Sister Mary Melanie and she was called Sister Melanie. Was it a coincidence that there were at least two storylines which may have come from this Mitchell family story. There was a woman named Melanie (Melanie Wilkes)who married her cousin (Ashley); and in another part of the book, a memory of Scarlett's mother Ellen falling for her cousin, who left for the \"west.\" Barnes has researched his book for many years and stands by his story.\n\nWriters Notebook:\n\nMaxwell Perkins, one of America’s best-known editors worked for Charles Scribner’s Sons, New York and edited works of such famous writers as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway and Thomas Wolf. Perkins wrote in answer to a letter, received from a young man in the Military, regarding the active pursuit of a writing career had this advice for the young man. ‘As to perhaps a couple of years in college, I should think that might be a great advantage, in the general sense, but don’t try to learn about writing there. Learn something else. Learn about writing from reading. That’s the right way to do it. But then it can only be done by those who have eyes and ears, and by seeing and listening. Very few of the great writers had that formal education, and many of them never mastered spelling or grammar. They got their vocabulary by reading and hearing. But the way they teach literature and writing in college is harmful…’\n\nWriting courses have changed a lot since Perkins made those remarks, however much of his advice is still valid. Being a good observer and developing good reading habits will likely take you farther along the path to a writing career than anything else.\n\nTom Barnes -- Actor, Writer and Hurricane Hunter.\n\nCheck out my website for books, blogs, western legends, a literary icon, reviews and interviews.

By that time in the production the working script was in place and Selznick’s idea was to drive forward and complete filming as soon as possible.\n\nTo accomplish that goal he wanted to have as many as five units shooting various scenes on the same day. And as a means to that end Selznick would take Sam Wood up on his offer and then add several other second unit directors to shoot various location scenes.\n\nPreviously mentioned second unit directors Yakima Canutt and James A Fitzpatrick were already on the list.\n\nFitzpatrick was in Georgia shooting background scenes from the actual Tara area.\n\nIn order to have enough directing talent available Peter Ballbusch, a solid utility director was added to the second unit director’s list.\n\nB. Reeves Eason had a wide range of experience as actor, writer and director also signed up as a second unit director.\n\nChester M. Franklin was hired for his experience dating back to the silent days.\n\nWilliam Cameron Menzies the present production designer and art director of GWTW was pressed into service as a second unit director. The versatile Menzies was also a film director, producer and screenwriter.\n\nMenzies would later add to his resume the film ‘Around the World in 80 Days’ where he shared producer credits with Mike Todd and Kevin McCloy.\n\nThe Kentucky Derby\n\nThis week’s sports pages all over the world will be filled with stories about Saturday’s Kentucky Derby. Horses, trainers and owners will all get their moment of fame. Some of the stories will be original and insightful while most will be boilerplate rhetoric you could have read the week before any past derby. And some of the best stories may be overlooked this week simply because late in the afternoon on the first Saturday in May at Churchill Downs the Kentucky Derby will be run. And sometimes a star is born.\n\nBut once the winner gets that blanked of roses, be it favorite or unbelievable Longshot a new cycle begins with talk in the Sunday morning sports pages about the 2009 race for the Triple Crown.\n\nBack in 1919 a star and a tradition was born.\n\nThe big story coming out of the 1919 Kentucky Derby was that Sir Barton was not in the race to win, he was entered as a rabbit to go out fast and wear down the favorites giving Sir Barton’s stable mate Billy Kelly a chance to come from behind and take all the marbles. Well, it didn’t work out that way because Sir Barton didn’t tire; he just went on to win the race.\n\nSir Barton was immediately put on a train and shipped to Baltimore where only four days later he won the Preakness. Then a couple of weeks after that race he took New York by storm and won a race at Belmont, which was later to become the Belmont Stakes.\n\nAnd that was the beginning of a horse racing tradition known as the Triple Crown.\n\n(To be continued)\n\nNazi Stolen Art\n\nExcerpt from ‘The Goring Collection.\n\nJacob Meyers, head of the Founders Group Intelligence Division, hooks up with Interpol’s international art investigation. Two suspect paintings, a Manet and Cézanne, are sold in Berlin as copies and tracked to the Berghoff Gallery in Chicago where they sell as originals. The paintings came from cache plundered by the Nazi’s now controlled by Cartel.\n\nFGI Operatives investigate and report a flurry of Cartel activities in Chicago, Atlanta, San Francisco and Las Vegas. Accidental shooting at the Chicago Gallery, two murders in San Francisco, political blackmail in Las Vegas and a rogue group within the Cartel dealing drugs in West Georgia. That hodgepodge of crimes makes no sense until Jacob gets a tip from informant giving him date and place for Cartel’s upcoming grand auction. But the real bombshell comes when Cartel member – ex Senator Tripp Farrell – is linked to San Francisco murders.\n\nA task force made up of FGI, Customs, DEA and a local sheriff quashed the Cartel’s multi-million dollar auction and shut down the drug trafficking operation. But the hunt for Cartel’s main stash continued and leads to Europe where FGI, Interpol and a Danish Partisan group team up to search for the Goring Collection.\n\nWriters Notebook:\n\nA lesson from Hemingway’s ‘A Moveable Feast.’\n\n‘…good and severe discipline.’\n\n‘It was in that room that I learned not to think about anything that I was writing from the time I stopped writing until I started again the next day. That way my subconscious could be working on it and at the same time I would be listening to other people and noticing everything…’\n\n‘Going down the stairs when I had worked well, and that needed luck as well as discipline, was a wonderful feeling and I was free then to walk anywhere in Paris. If I walked down by different streets to Jardin du Luxembourg in the afternoon I would walk through the gardens and then go to the Musee du Luxembourg…’ ‘I went there nearly every day for the Cézanne’s and to see the Manet’s and the Monet’s and the other Impressionist’s that I had first come to know about in the Art Institute in Chicago…’\n\n‘But if the light was gone in the Luxembourg I would walk up through the gardens and stop in at the studio apartment where Gertrude Stein lived at 27 rue de Fleurus.’\n\nAnother example of what the writer observes is what eventually goes onto the printed page. And Hemingway believed that those observations after passing through the subconscious was the way to build from, ‘that one true sentence,’ he talked about so often.\n\nTom Barnes -- Actor, Writer and Hurricane Hunter.\n\nCheck out my website for books, blogs, western legends, a literary icon, reviews and interviews.

Wyatt stopped by Virgil's room and Doc simply poked his head in the door and called a greeting to Virg. Then he went down the hall to Morg's room and found his friend sitting in the middle of his bed, cross-legged, rolling a cigarette. He was in pain, but managed a grin. \"How did you fellows make out in court today?\"\n\n\"Could have been better, I guess.\"\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\n“Johnny Behan was at it again.” Doc took out his notes and quoted large portions of Behan's testimony and pointed out several discrepancies. Then he said, “Here’s one you might remember. The district attorney was questioning Behan about a conversation Behan had with Wyatt, shortly after the shooting was over. It was when Wyatt said to me, 'Behan, you have deceived me. You said you had disarmed them. Then Behan said, 'I did not say anything of the kind. I had said. 'Earp, I told you that I was there for the purpose of arresting them and disarming them. He said he thought I said that I had disarmed them.’”\n\n“Bullshit!” Morg roared. “That’s exactly what the son-of-a-bitch said, ‘I have disarmed them.’”\n\n“You got that right, Morg.” Then Doc leaned back in his chair, took a long drag from his cigarette. \"But that son-of-a-gun finally stumbled into the truth. He said the nickel-plated pistol got off the first round.”\n\nMorg grinned and looked knowingly at Doc.\n\n“Something else, this afternoon, a Mrs. King took the stand and told of a remark you supposedly made to me, in front of Bauer's Butcher Shop, just before the fight.”\n\n\"What was it?\" Morg asked.\n\n\"I don't remember you saying it, but here's the way she put it. ”Doc referred to his notes and then did a pretty good imitation of the lady. 'I heard the gentleman on the outside say to Mr. Holliday, 'Let them have it.' And Mr. Holliday said, 'All right.\"'\n\nMorg hooted, \"Quit that, Doc, it hurts too much to laugh.\"\n\nDoc chuckled. \"Do you remember that?\"\n\nMorg shook his head. \"Don't remember nothin' like that. But I do remember when we got to Bauer's place we were all jawin' with the sheriff. Seems to me, you had dropped back a ways by then.\"\n\n\"I don't figure Mrs. King to be a liar,” Doc said, “but she could be mistaken. Another thing, she's probably been coached by the prosecution.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"Lawyer's sometimes tell witnesses how to say things. Now this might sound picky, but at the inquest she gave two different versions of what you were supposed to have said. I read that inquest transcript. In one place she said, 'Let them have it,' and in another she changed it to, 'Give it to them.' Nobody questioned her about it.\"\n\n\"Comes down to pretty near the same thing don't it, \" Morg remarked.\n\n\"Maybe, but she never said the second version in Spicer's court.” Doc twirled the end of his mustache. \"I think the prosecution made sure the lady used the phrase that pictured us in the worst possible light. Yep, 'Let ’em have it,' sure makes it sound like we were spoiling for a fight.”\n\n\"Think the judge saw it that way?\"\n\n\"Don't know.\" Then Doc shook his head and grinned, \"I'll tell you something, Morg -- of all the poker faces I've read in my life -- that old man's got one of the best. I swear I never know what he's thinking.\"\n\nSpicer Hearing Excerpts: (To be continued)\n\nLet's Go to the The Movies\n\nHollywood Silents 1914-1929 Part 3\n\nDuring 1914 Los Angeles looked like a boom town – film companies forming and location filming was going on all over the city. Local citizens decried the invasion of the movie makers and Frances Marion describes the situation in her autobiography, 'Off With Their Heads.'\n\n'How could anyone resent the lively fun they had brought into this dull environment? You encounter the gypsy-like caravans where ever you went. Indians in full war paint rode hell bent for leather across the dusty river beds. Mack Sennett's Cops leaped aboard the cable car that climbed a midget hill known as Angels Flight. Even the little parks became outdoor stages. During the noon hour you were apt to see Bluebeard and all his wives cozily eating ham sandwiches and hard boiled eggs, while the Apostle John sat under a pepper tree with his arm around a bathing beauty...'\n\nMany in the legitimate theater thought little of the movie people either. Ms. Marion continues, ...'At the theater during rest periods the stock company often discussed the rising influence of the movies. Our star, Laurette Taylor, said, 'I shall never be lured into it, though they have trapped Madame Bernhardt, Lillie Langtry, and Minnie Maddern Fiske.'\n\n'Those totting tintypes!' Shouted Jimmie Gleason, 'I wouldn't be caught dead in 'em.'\n\nGleason apparently had a conversion later on because he became one of the movies best known character actors and was a member of the group that founded the Screen Actors Guild.\n\nSunshine and fair weather drew those would be film makers from the east to the Los Angeles area like a giant magnet. Dozens of independent film makers would put a company together in order to make one film. For example 'Fatty's Wine Party,' Production Company.\n\n'The Patchwork Girl of Oz,' The Oz Film Manufacturing Company.\n\nThen there was the Apollo Film Company that made 'The Great Pasadena Rose Tournament of 1914.'\n\nThose with a bit more staying power included The William Selig Company.\n\nNew York Motion Picture Company – Bison Division.\n\nBiograph films.\n\nMutual Film Corporation.\n\nMack Sennett's Keystone Film Company.\n\nLasky Feature Play Company, which included Sam Goldwyn, Cecil B. DeMille, Jesse L. Lasky and Arthur Friend produced \"The Squaw Man' the first feature film made in Hollywood. Their production headquarters was an old yellow barn located at Selma and Vine. (That barn was moved and turned into a museum, which is now located in Griffith Park, across the street from the Hollywood Bowl.)\n\nSam Goldwyn's given name was Sam Goldfish, a name without destinction. And since he was in a business known for hyperbole he wanted a name that sounded more sophisticated, something that had a ring of success to it. As Sam went over his options he thought of a past associate named Selwyn and it occured to him that by splitting their names in half, and moving the parts around you had two different names. Selfish and Goldwyn. Sam picked the winner and chose a name that eventually made Sammy Goldfish famous.\n\nThere is another name in the movie business that means little to people outside the industry, but a man of vision that rose to the top of the film industry and stayed there. That name is Adolph Zukor.\n\nZukor's life in show business started out in New York's penny arcades and later Nickelodeons. He got into the movie business when he and a partner, Broadway producer, Charles Frohman bought the American rights to a French made film 'Queen Elizabeth' starring Sarah Bernhardt.They rented the Lyceum Theater, papered the city with advertising and opened the film July 12, 1912. Theater goers and society figures would have probably shunned the film except for one fact, the star was Sarah Bernhardt.\n\nThe 40 minute film was of poor quality, however it became a big hit for them. And from that success Zukor and Frohman founded the Famous Players In Famous Plays Film Company. The name was later changed to Famous Players. Their company produced 'The Prisoner of Zenda' and 'The Count of Monte Cristo' in 1913. Both films were successful and by the end of 1913 Zukor realized what was going on in the west and moved his part of the operation to Los Angeles.\n\nIt took Adolph Zukor only six months to set up shop in Hollywood, and by the middle of May 1914 Mr. Zukor managed to gather several small companies including Jesse Lasky's Feature Players Company the into one operation. And once they were all under one umbrella the group formed Paramount Pictures, which became the dominant motion picture company in Hollywood.\n\nIn 1914 motion picture companies began to promote their stars along with their films. Mary Pickford was the first Paramount star and Mack Sennett's Keystone Films countered with Fatty Arbuckle and Charlie Chaplin.\n\n(To be continued)\n\nWriters Notebook:\n\nWords and phrases – the search goes on.\n\nEver get hung up on a word that’s almost but not quite right?\n\nPeg Bracken has and she gives us some thoughts on the subject. ‘I do a great deal of rewriting. Almost never is a paragraph right the first time or the sixth or seventh time either for that matter. You are always looking for that right word. There’s a grave difference between a B and a B flat. And it matters too where it falls in the measure. I believe there’s only one best word. Of course one doesn’t always find that best word, but it is the thing to aim for.’\n\nTom Barnes -- Actor, Writer and Hurricane Hunter.\n\nCheck out my website for books, blogs, western legends, a literary icon, reviews and interviews.
