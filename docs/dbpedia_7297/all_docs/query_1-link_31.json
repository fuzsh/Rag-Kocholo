        "text": "Barbara Eden, born Barbara Jean Morehead in Tucson, Arizona, became one of America's most endearing and enduring actresses. A graduate of Abraham Lincoln High School in San Francisco, California, Eden would go on to study at San Francisco's City College as well as the San Francisco Conservatory of Music and the Elizabeth Holloway School of Theatre. While her aspirations as a singer motivated her during her early years for a career in music, it was her starring role in the NBC TV comedy series, Bezaubernde Jeannie (1965) where Barbara Eden immediately gained international acclaim.\n\nAlthough most remembered for her role as \"Jeannie\", Barbara Eden has starred in more than 20 theatrical feature films and made-for-television films for at least four different movie studios: 20th Century Fox, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Columbia Studios, and Universal Studios, most notably in the film Flammender Stern (1960), when she acted as Elvis Presley's leading lady. Other films in which Barbara Eden had a leading role were Unternehmen Feuergürtel (1961), Die Wunderwelt der Gebrüder Grimm (1962), Fünf Wochen im Ballon (1962), Der mysteriöse Dr. Lao (1964) and Mein Zimmer wird zum Harem (1964). The Brass Bottle comedy movie led to Sidney Sheldon's creation of Bezaubernde Jeannie (1965) comical TV series.\n\nIn television, Eden made her first featured appearance on Country Club Dance (1957), as the series was nearing cancellation (there were just two more episodes). Eden immediately landed a starring role in the television version of Wie angelt man sich einen Millionär? (1957), where she portrayed the same character role originated by Marilyn Monroe. Another memorable appearance came on The Manicurist (1962), featuring her in the character role, special guest-star, as well as her occupation being titled.\n\nIn 1965, Barbara Eden was cast the leading role in Sidney Sheldon's NBC sitcom, Bezaubernde Jeannie (1965). It televised weekly, for five successful and humorous seasons with 139 episodes. After \"Jeannie,\" Barbara Eden went on to star in many other comical and family productions including Die Rache der blonden Hexe (1978) and Chattanooga Choo Choo (1984) among other numerous highly rated made-for-television movies well into the 1990s. She has also acted in multiple western series and thrillers.\n\nOutside of her film and television works, Barbara Eden headlined major hotel resorts and casinos including Lake Tahoe, Atlantic City and Las Vegas. She also was the star attraction at the MGM Grand, Harrah's, Caesar's Palace and on concert stages and legitimate theaters across the country.\n\nUtilizing her singing ability, Eden released an album titled \"Miss Barbara Eden\" in 1967, for record company, Dot Records. She has also been a musical guest star in a wide range of variety television shows. Eden's appearances included 21 Bob Hope special shows, along with The Carol Burnett Show (1967), The Jonathan Winters Show (1967), The Sonny and Cher Show (1976), The Jerry Lewis Show (1963), Die Tom Jones-Show (1969), Tony Orlando and Dawn (1974), and Donny and Marie (1975).\n\nDuring the Persian Gulf War, she traveled with Bob Hope to the middle-east to perform for the combat troops and then continued on with Hope in a whirlwind eight-day, around-the-world USO tour entertaining servicemen during the Christmas season.\n\nTo celebrate the 2002 Yuletide season, she responded to an invitation from President George Bush; Barbara journeyed to Washington D.C. and sang \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\" at the annual White House \"Lighting of the National Christmas Tree\" event where she also hosted the show and pageant with President and Mrs. Bush for an audience of 6,000 cheering fans on the Ellipse near the White House.\n\nA multi-talent, Eden starred in the national touring musicals Meine Lieder, meine Träume (1965) and Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1998). In the latter production, she played Lorelei Lee, the character created on Broadway by Carol Channing and performed by Marilyn Monroe in the 20th Century Fox film version. Eden also toured vastly in various stage productions like Neil Simon's Der Letzte der feurigen Liebhaber (1972), Das schönste Freudenhaus in Texas (1982), Annie Get Your Gun (1967), Die Südsee (2009) and Nite Club Confidential (1996). In the play \"Love Letters,\" Eden reunited with her Bezaubernde Jeannie (1965) co-star, Larry Hagman. The duo toured metropolitan and major cities, across the United States. Eden starred in Neil Simon's \"The Odd Couple: Female Version\", and \"Social Security\" (1985). She has also been seen in TV series like, All Star Blitz (1985), Entertainment Tonight (1981) and Larry King Live (1985).\n\nIn 2011, Crown Archetype, a division of Random House, published Barbara's memoir, \"Jeannie Out of the Bottle,\" which debuted at number 14 on the New York Times Best Seller List and on Australia's Best Seller List, published there by Harper-Collins, Inc. The autobiography chronicle's Eden's colorful life and remarkable Hollywood career that spans more than 50 years.\n\nOne of Hollywood's busiest actresses, Barbara filmed a starring role in Always and Forever (2009), a movie filmed by and for the Hallmark Channel. The move was televised numerous times during the year it was filmed and released. On the road, she hosted productions of Ballets with a Twist (1996), the new groundbreaking show that stars rotating celebrity emcees and dancers from Dancing with the Stars (2010). Barbara Eden has appeared recently in a recurring role on Lifetime's Army Wives (2007) series, guest-starred on ABC's George Lopez (2002), and enacted a recurring role on Sabrina - total verhext! (1996). During her long career, Barbara has starred in 25 feature films, five network TV series and 19 top-rated network made-for-television movies.\n\nBarbara has been featured in TV commercials for Old Navy, AT&T, and she introduced the Lexus SUV, which was later named Car of the Year by Motor Trend Magazine.\n\nPeople Magazine named Barbara \"One of America's 200 Greatest Pop Icons of the 20th Century.\" She has been honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7003 Hollywood Boulevard near the front of the world famous Grauman's Chinese Theatre. She was named one of TV Guide's Most Popular Comedy Stars and has received Lifetime Achievement Awards from the Broadcasters Hall of Fame, The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, and the TV Land Television Network.\n\nWhen there is time in her crowded schedule, Eden works actively on behalf of numerous charities including The Trail of Painted Ponies Breast Cancer Research, American Cancer Society, the Wellness Community, the Make-A-Wish Foundation, the March of Dimes, the American Heart Association, Save the Children and Childhelp USA.\n\nBarbara Eden resides with her architect/real estate developer husband Jon Eicholtz in the Benedict Canyon area of Beverly Hills.\n\nMartha Wentworth was an American actress from New York City, and a versatile voice actress in radio and animation. She is better remembered for voicing the shape-shifting witch Madam Mim in the Arthurian animated film \"The Sword in the Stone\" (1963). This was Wentworth's last credited voice role, but Mim turned out to be one of the most popular characters introduced in this film. Mim went on to become a significant recurring character in Disney comics, often depicted as the roommate and best friend of fellow witch Magica De Spell.\n\nIn 1889, Wentworth was born in New York City. She made her theatrical debut c. 1906, at the age of 17. She was one of the proteges of the veteran actress Minnie Maddern Fiske (1865-1932). In the early 1920s, Wentworth started regularly voicing radio characters.\n\nIn 1935, she was hired to voice the horror host Old Nancy, the Witch of Salem in the horror-themed radio series \"The Witch's Tale\" (1931-1938). She replaced Nancy's previous actress Adelaide Fitz-Allen, who had died in 1935. Wentworth also voiced the recurring villain Wintergreen the Witch in the Christmas-themed serial \"The Cinnamon Bear\" (1937).\n\nWentworth voiced Jenny Wren in \"Who Killed Cock Robin?\" (1935), one of Disney's \"Silly Symphonies\". She also voiced the terrorist Mad Bomber in \"The Blow Out\", the first solo cartoon for Porky Pig. She voiced several minor characters in late 1930s \"Merrie Melodies\". She voiced the radio announcer of the \"witching hour\" in \"Fraidy Cat\" (1942), one of the earliest Tom and Jerry short films.\n\nWentworth was one of the regular supporting players in the radio show \"The Abbott and Costello Show\" (1940-1949). The show's stars were the comedy duo of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello. She voiced Daffy Duck's domineering wife in \"His Bitter Half\" (1950). Wentworth voiced three relatively minor characters in the animated feature film \"One Hundred and One Dalmatians\" (1961). Her characters in the film were the loyal housekeeper Nanny, the helpful goose Lucy, and Queenie, the leader of a group of cows. During its initial release, the film earned 14 million dollars at the domestic box office.\n\nWentworth retired from acting in the mid-1960s. She died in March 1974, at the age of 84. Though her radio fame has faded, she still has a loyal following among animation fans. Her voice has continued to entertain generations of fans, long after her heyday.\n\nAlthough versatile character actor and voice extraordinary Henry Corden will forever be associated with, and fondly remembered for, providing the bellicose, gravel-toned rasp of cartoon immortal Fred Flintstone, he enjoyed a long and varied career prior to this distinction, which took up most of his later years.\n\nBorn in Montreal, Canada, on Tuesday, January 6, 1920, his family moved to New York while he was still a child. Henry received his start on stage and radio before heading off to Hollywood in the 1940s. He made his film debut as a minor heavy in the Danny Kaye vehicle, Das Doppelleben des Herrn Mitty (1947), as Boris Karloff's bestial henchman, and continued on along those same lines, often in uncredited/unbilled parts. A master at dialects, he was consistently employed as either an ethnic Middle Eastern villain or some sort of streetwise character (club manager, salesman) in 1950s costumed adventures and crime yarns, both broad and serious.\n\nHe seldom made it into the prime support ranks, however, with somewhat insignificant parts in Abbott und Costello als Legionäre (1950), Asphalt-Dschungel (1950), Viva Zapata (1952), Scaramouche - Der Mann mit der Maske (1952), Ich beichte (1953), Der Talisman (1954), Jupiters Liebling (1955) and Die zehn Gebote (1956). On TV, he could regularly be found on both drama (\"Perry Mason\", \"The Untouchables\") and light comedy (\"My Little Margie,\" \"Mister Ed\"). A heightened visibility on TV included playing Barbara Eden's genie father on \"I Dream of Jeannie\" and as the contentious landlord \"Mr. Babbitt\" on \"The Monkees\".\n\nHenry made a highly lucrative move into animation in the 1960s supplying a host of brutish voices on such cartoons as \"Johnny Quest\", \"The Jetsons\", \"Secret Squirrel\", \"Atom Ant\", \"Josie and the Pussycats\", and \"The Harlem Globetrotters\". He inherited the voice of Fred Flintstone after the show's original vocal owner, Alan Reed, passed away in 1977. He went on to give life to Flintstone for nearly three decades on various revamped cartoon series, animated specials and cereal commercials. He was performing as Flintstone, in fact, until about three months prior to his death of emphysema at the age of 85 on Wednesday, May 19, 2005.\n\nMarried four times, he was survived by wife Angelina; two daughters (from his first marriage), and three stepchildren (from his last union).\n\nA rather wanderlust fellow before he latched onto acting, Denver Pyle--who made a career of playing drawling, somewhat slow Southern types--was actually born in Colorado in 1920, to a farming family. He attended a university for a time but dropped out to become a drummer. When that didn't pan out he drifted from job to job, doing everything from working the oil fields in Oklahoma to the shrimp boats in Texas. In 1940 he moseyed off to Los Angeles and briefly found employment as a (somewhat unlikely) NBC page. That particular career was interrupted by World War II, and Pyle enlisted in the navy. Wounded in the battle of Guadalcanal, he received a medical discharge in 1943. Working for an aircraft plant in Los Angeles as a riveter, the rangy actor was introduced to the entertainment field after receiving a role in an amateur theater production and getting spotted by a talent scout. Training with such renowned teachers as Maria Ouspenskaya and Michael Chekhov, he made his film debut in The Guilt of Janet Ames (1947). Pyle went on to roles in hundreds of film and TV parts, bringing a touch of Western authenticity to many of his roles. A minor villain or sidekick in the early 1950s, he often received no billing. Prematurely white-haired (a family trait), he became a familiar face on episodes of Rauchende Colts (1955) and Bonanza (1959) and also developed a close association with actor John Wayne, appearing in many of Wayne's later films, including Der letzte Befehl (1959), Alamo (1960), Der Mann der Liberty Valance erschoss (1962) and Geier kennen kein Erbarmen (1973). Pyle's more important movie roles came late in his career. One of his most memorable was in Bonnie und Clyde (1967) as Texas Ranger Frank Hamer, the handcuffed hostage of the duo, who spits in Bonnie's (Faye Dunaway) face after she coyly poses with him for a camera shot. He settled easily into hillbilly/mountain men types in his later years and became a household face for his crotchety presence in Der Mann in den Bergen (1977) and, especially, Ein Duke kommt selten allein (1979). He died of lung cancer at age 77.\n\nMean, miserly and miserable-looking, they didn't come packaged with a more annoying and irksome bow than Charles Lane. Glimpsing even a bent smile from this unending sourpuss was extremely rare, unless one perhaps caught him in a moment of insidious glee after carrying out one of his many nefarious schemes. Certainly not a man's man on film or TV by any stretch, Lane was a character's character. An omnipresent face in hundreds of movies and TV sitcoms, the scrawny, scowling, beady-eyed, beak-nosed killjoy who usually could be found peering disdainfully over a pair of specs, brought out many a comic moment simply by dampening the spirit of his nemesis. Whether a Grinch-like rent collector, IRS agent, judge, doctor, salesman, reporter, inspector or neighbor from hell, Lane made a comfortable acting niche for himself making life wretched for someone somewhere.\n\nHe was born Charles Gerstle Levison on January 26, 1905 in San Francisco and was actually one of the last survivors of that city's famous 1906 earthquake. He started out his working-class existence selling insurance but that soon changed. After dabbling here and there in various theatre shows, he was prodded by a friend, director Irving Pichel, to consider acting as a profession. In 1928 he joined the Pasadena Playhouse company, which, at the time, had built up a solid reputation for training stage actors for the cinema. While there he performed in scores of classical and contemporary plays. He made his film debut anonymously as a hotel clerk in Leichtes Geld (1931) starring Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney and was one of the first to join the Screen Actor's Guild. He typically performed many of his early atmospheric roles without screen credit and at a cost of $35 per day, but he always managed to seize the moment with whatever brief bit he happened to be in. People always remembered that face and raspy drone of a voice. He appeared in so many pictures (in 1933 alone he made 23 films!), that he would occasionally go out and treat himself to a movie only to find himself on screen, forgetting completely that he had done a role in the film. By 1947 the popular character actor was making $750 a week.\n\nAmong his scores of cookie-cutter crank roles, Lane was in top form as the stage manager in Napoleon vom Broadway (1934); the Internal Revenue Service agent in Lebenskünstler (1938); the newsman in Mr. Smith geht nach Washington (1939); the rent collector in Ist das Leben nicht schön? (1946); the recurring role of Doc Jed Prouty, in the \"Ellery Queen\" film series of the 1940s, and as the draft board driver in Blindgänger der Kompanie (1958). A minor mainstay for Frank Capra, the famed director utilized the actor's services for nine of his finest films, including a few of the aforementioned plus Mr. Deeds geht in die Stadt (1936), Arsen und Spitzenhäubchen (1944) and Der beste Mann (1948).\n\nLane's career was interrupted for a time serving in the Coast Guard during WWII. In post-war years, he found TV quite welcoming, settling there as well for well over four decades. Practically every week during the 1950s and 1960s, one could find him displaying somewhere his patented \"slow burn\" on a popular sitcom - Topper (1953), The Real McCoys (1957), The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis (1959), Mister Ed (1961), Verliebt in eine Hexe (1964), Mini-Max oder die unglaublichen Abenteuer des Maxwell Smart (1965), Gomer Pyle: USMC (1964), Die Munsters (1964), Green Acres (1965), The Flying Nun (1967) and Maude (1972). He hassled the best sitcom stars of the day, notably Lucille Ball (an old friend from the RKO days with whom he worked multiple times), Andy Griffith and Danny Thomas. Recurring roles on Dennis, Geschichten eines Lausbuben (1959), The Beverly Hillbillies (1962) and Die Ausgeflippten (1977) made him just as familiar to young and old alike. Tops on the list had to be his crusty railroad exec Homer Bedloe who periodically caused bucolic bedlam with his nefarious schemes to shut down the Hooterville Cannonball on Petticoat Junction (1963). He could also play it straightforward and serious as demonstrated by his work in Unwahrscheinliche Geschichten (1959), Perry Mason (1957), Unsere kleine Farm (1974) and L.A. Law: Staranwälte, Tricks, Prozesse (1986).\n\nA benevolent gent in real life, Lane was seen less and less as time went by. One memorable role in his twilight years was as the rueful child pediatrician who chose to overlook the warning signs of child abuse in the excellent TV movie Sybil (1976). One of Lane's last on-screen roles was in the TV-movie remake of Dexter Riley - Total verkabelt und nichts begriffen (1995) at age 90. Just before his death he was working on a documentary on his long career entitled \"You Know the Face\".\n\nCinematically speaking, perhaps the good ones do die young, for the irascible Lane lived to be 102 years old. He died peacefully at his Brentwood, California home, outliving his wife of 71 years, former actress Ruth Covell, who died in 2002. A daughter, a son and a granddaughter all survived him.\n\nArmed with an entrancing whiskey-like voice that complemented her stunning, creamy blonde looks, Southern-bred beauty Joanna Moore had so much going for her when her film and TV career first took off in the late 1950s. Sadly, what began as an exciting Hollywood carnival ride would all too soon careen out of control and turn into a dangerous and tragic rollercoaster ride filled with personal and professional ups and downs.\n\nBorn Dorothy Joan Cook on November 10, 1934 in Americus, Georgia, Joanna was the elder daughter of Dorothy Martha (née English) and Henry Anderson Cook III. A fatal car accident in 1941 took the lives of both her mother and her baby sister. When her father died from his severe injuries a year later, 7-year-old Joanna lived with her grandmother; when the lady grew too feeble to look after her, Joanna was adopted locally by a well-to-do family who changed her name from Dorothy to Joanna. In 1951, the 16-year-old girl married another teenager, Willis Moore, and divorced him within the year. She later enrolled at Agnes Scott, a women's college in Decatur, Georgia (near Atlanta).\n\nAround this time, Joanna won a local Georgia beauty contest that would take her straight to Hollywood. Spotted at a party by a Universal producer, the actress was tested and quickly signed. A brief, impulsive marriage (1956-1957) to minor actor Don Oreck also occurred during this early career stage. She began as a lovely presence on such TV anthologies as \"Lux Video Theatre,\" \"Goodyear Theatre,\" \"Studio One in Hollywood\" and \"Kraft Theatre,\" and also found work in top female lead and second lead roles in \"B\" movies. She started out promisingly as handsome George Nader's love interest in the film noir Appointment with a Shadow (1957), directed by Richard Carlson wherein both play crime reporters--he with an alcohol problem. She followed this with second femme roles in both the western comedy Slim Carter (1957) starring Julie Adams and Jock Mahoney as the title country singer, and the romantic drama Flood Tide (1958), which reunited her with Nader.\n\nAfter Orson Welles gave her a small cryptic role in his classic film noir Im Zeichen des Bösen (1958), Joanna went on to a secondary femme role in the Audie Murphy western Der weiße Teufel von Arkansas (1958) and co-starred as Arthur Franz's fiancée in the cult sci-fi horror programmer Der Schrecken schleicht durch die Nacht (1958) with Franz playing a Jekyll-and-Hyde college professor who turns ape caveman-like thanks to his radioactive exposure. She ended the decade with another second femme role in an \"A\" picture--Der Zorn des Gerechten (1959) starring Oscar-nominated Paul Muni as a Jewish doctor and featuring Joanna in a romantic subplot involving married TV producer David Wayne.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Joanna suffered severe auditory nerve loss (otosclerosis) to the point of having to read lips. An operation thankfully restored her hearing (in one ear) in 1962. By this time, Joanna had moved more towards TV and enjoyed guest parts on such dramatic shows as \"Bourbon Street Beat,\" \"Maverick,\" \"The Rifleman,\" \"Bat Masterson,\" \"Tales of Wells Fargo,\" \"The Rebel,\" \"Adventures in Paradise\" and \"The Untouchables,\" with a few comedy shows such as \"Bachelor Father\" and \"The Real McCoys\" thrown in for good measure.\n\nJoanna went on to portray more than a few wily females on screen as she did with her neurotic \"Miss Precious\" in the drama Auf glühendem Pflaster (1962), sexy \"Alisha Claypoole\" in the Elvis Presley vehicle Ein Sommer in Florida (1962), and Southern belle \"Desiree de La Roche\" in the light-hearted Disney comedy Der Pauker kann's nicht lassen (1962). She played the same kind of crafty gals on such TV shows as \"Perry Mason,\" \"Route 66,\" \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents,\" \"Bewitched\", and \"The Wild Wild West.\" She is perhaps best remembered, however, for her down-home benevolent role of Peggy, the four-episode girlfriend of Sheriff Andy Taylor (Andy Griffith) in the third season of TV's The Andy Griffith Show (1960).\n\nAt the peak of her career, Joanna married her third husband, \"Prince Charming\" actor Ryan O'Neal, on April 3, 1963. O'Neal would soon make a huge TV impact as handsome but troubled \"Rodney Harrington\" on the prime time soaper Peyton Place (1964). The exceptionally good-looking couple became a popular Hollywood twosome and went on to have two children who also became actors: Tatum O'Neal and Griffin O'Neal. Joanna's marriage to O'Neal was stormy, to say the least, and they divorced in February 1967.\n\nJoanna went into a gradual, deep decline after her divorce from O'Neal. Depression set in and she developed a severe amphetamine and alcohol addiction. Multiple arrests over time for drunk driving (one much later resulted in the loss of three fingers) led to her losing custody of her children in 1970. That same year she checked into a state hospital for psychiatric treatment. Sadly, both her children, Tatum and Griffin, would battle similar substance abuse problems as adults. There was also talk that Joanna was growing more and more bizarre, living in self-styled communes and isolating herself from any Hollywood contact. She went on to marry and divorce a third and fourth time.\n\nFor awhile Joanna managed to stay afloat on both film with such occasional second-string offers as the sci-fi chiller Countdown - Start zum Mond (1967); the comedy caper Wie klaut man ein Gemälde? (1968); the \"bikersploitation\" yarn J.C. (1972) and the all-star thriller Die Hindenburg (1975). She also co-starred in the TV adaptation of Three Coins in the Fountain (1970) with Yvonne Craig and Cynthia Pepper and was seen fairly regularly on such late 1960's TV programs as \"The Virginian,\" \"Judd for the Defense,\" \"The High Chaparral,\" \"The F.B.I.,\" \"The Name of the Game,\" \"The Waltons,\" \"Kung Fu,\" \"Bronk,\" \"Police Story,\" \"Petrocelli\", and \"The Blue Knight.\"\n\nAfter this, however, Joanna's personal life unravelled dramatically, which spilled into her professional career. By the late 1970s, Joanna, still abusing drugs and alcohol, had to be supported financially by daughter, Tatum, now an Oscar-winning film star. Little was heard for nearly a decade when it was learned that the actress was living in the Palm Springs area (Indian Wells) involving herself in small theater projects.\n\nA long-time smoker, Joanna was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1996 and died a year later on November 22, 1997, age 63, with Tatum by her side. She was interred at Oak Grove Cemetery in her hometown of Americus, Georgia. In 2015, grandson Kevin Jack McEnroe (son of Tatum and her then-husband/tennis star John McEnroe) published a gripping novel entitled \"Our Town,\" a \"fictionalized account\" of the damaging effects of substance abuse on a family. It is said to be strongly based on his own grandmother's devastating struggles.\n\nLovely Joan Staley was born Joan McConchie on May 20, 1940 in Minneapolis, Minnesota and started taking violin lessons by the time she was three years old. Living in Los Angeles, her prodigious talent was obvious. She soon joined a baby orchestra in Los Angeles and, within a few years, became a Junior Symphony performer at age six. She also made her unbilled specialty debut on film as a child violinist in Ich küsse Ihre Hand, Madame (1948), starring Bing Crosby and Joan Fontaine.\n\nHer father's business had the family traveling throughout Europe growing up but she later relocated to California and briefly enrolled at Chapman College in the Los Angeles area. Becoming a stunning, statuesque beauty, she re-directed herself back to a career in show business, singing backup on records for Sam Phillips and working as a secretary to make ends meet while appearing in local L.A. stage productions.\n\nIn 1958, she was approached by a photographer and eventually posed for Playboy magazine, becoming November's centerfold. The attention warranted her an MGM contract and cheesecake bit parts came her way with such movies as Frankie und seine Spießgesellen (1960) and Frühstück bei Tiffany (1961). She appeared front-and-center à la Raquel Welch as a scantily-clad prehistoric turn-on in Valley of the Dragons (1961), but nothing much came of it.\n\nFollowing her perky love interests in the mediocre western Der Colt ist das Gesetz (1966), starring Audie Murphy, and The Ghost and Mr. Chicken (1966), a Don Knotts comedy film, and guest appearances on such TV shows as \"Rango,\" \"Pistols and Petticoats, \"Mission: Impossible,\" \"Ironside\" and \"Adam-12,\" Joan's career went on hiatus after a horse-riding accident.\n\nBriefly married to Chuck Staley, her second husband is former Universal exec Dale Sheets. Twins were born to them, a boy and girl, on March 24, 1971. Since then, with the exception of a brief appearance on an episode of \"Dallas\" in 1982, Joan remained with family life and other outside pursuits. She died on November 24, 2019.\n\nEleanor Audley was an American actress, with a distinctive voice that helped her find work as a voice actress in radio and animation. She is primarily remembered as the first actress to voice Lady Tremaine and Maleficent, two of the most memorable Disney villains.\n\nAudley's real name was Eleanor Zellman, and she was from New York City. She was Jewish, but little is known about her family background and she apparently never married.\n\nShe made her acting debut in 1926, aged 20, at the Broadway production of \"Howdy, King\". She remained primarily a theatrical actress through the 1920s and the 1930s. During the 1940s, Audley started playing a number of prominent roles in radio serials. Among them was mother-in-law Leticia Cooper in \"My Favorite Husband\" (1948-51), receptionist Molly Byrd in \"The Story of Dr. Kildare\" (1949-51), and neighbor, Elizabeth Smith in \"Father Knows Best\" (1949-54).\n\nAudley was hired by Disney to play the role of wealthy widow Lady Tremaine in the animated feature film \"Cinderella\" (1950). Audley was also used as the live-action model of the character, and her facial features were used by the animators who designed the character. In the film, Lady Tremaine is depicted as the abusive stepmother of Cinderella (voiced by Ilene Woods) and the domineering mother of Anastasia Tremaine (voiced by Lucille Bliss) and Drizella Tremaine (voiced by Rhoda Williams). The film was a box office hit, and its profits helped rescue the Disney studio from a financial decline that had lasted for almost a decade.\n\nFor the rest of the decade, Audley appeared regularly in supporting roles in film, and guest roles in television. She returned to animation when hired to voice the evil fairy Maleficent in \"Sleeping Beauty\" (1959). As before, Audley was also used as a live-action model for the character. During the film's production, Audley was struggling with tuberculosis. While nominally the villain, Maleficent received more screen-time in the finished film than titular protagonist Princess Aurora (voiced by singer Mary Costa).\n\n\"Sleeping Beauty\" had box office receipts of more than $51 million in the U.S. and Canada, against a budget of $6 million. It finished the year second in ticket sales, behind the number one film, \"Ben-Hur.\" Audley was not invited to voice other villains. The film earned critical and popular acclaim through later re-releases, and Maleficent has been revived many times by Disney. But never with her original voice actress.\n\nIn the 1960s, Audley played supporting roles in then-popular television series. Among her most prominent roles were Irma Lumpkin in \"The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis\", Peggy Billings in \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\", Millicent Schuyler-Potts in \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" , Aunt Martha in \"Mister Ed\", Jenny Teasley in \"Pistols 'n' Petticoats\", Eunice Douglas in \"Green Acres\", and Beatrice Vincent in \"My Three Sons\".\n\nAudley worked with Disney again to voice psychic medium Madame Leota in the Haunted Mansion attractions in Disneyland and Walt Disney World. Leota is depicted as a ghost who communicates with the living, and other actresses have since voiced the character.\n\nHer long career ended prematurely in the 1970s, due to increasingly poor health. She lived in retirement until her death in 1991, at the age of 86. The cause of death was respiratory failure. Audley was interred at the Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles. Her character of Madame Leota received its own tombstone in 2001. The epitaph reads: \"Dear sweet Leota, beloved by all. In regions beyond now, but having a ball.\""
