        "text": "Greenwich Village (called \"the Village\" by New Yorkers) is known for its interesting history and its unique energy, both of which make it worth visiting.\n\nIt's a popular neighborhood for those looking for lively nightlife as it is filled with restaurants, bars, live music, and comedy clubs.\n\nAt the same time, the Village has a charm about it with its quiet, small side streets lined with historic row houses and brownstones.\n\nYou could easily spend a day here wandering its leafy streets, shopping at small local shops, and people-watching in Washington Square Park.\n\nThis post covers things to do in Greenwich Village, in particular, the West Village, with recommendations from a native New Yorker.\n\nIncluded are the top sights to see, places to eat and shop, and where to see live music and theater.\n\nWe are a group of local tour guides who lead daily walking tours of Greenwich Village and throughout New York City.\n\nSome of us live here, have lived here, and we all work here.\n\nAnd in the video below, Renee, a tour guide with us, Tours by Foot NYC, takes you on a virtual walk of the neighborhood.\n\nWe know a thing or two about this place. We even wrote and published an audio tour of the area.\n\nHere's a sample talking about the Friends Building.\n\nNow, without further ado, let's get to the post.\n\nTop Things To Do\n\nRestaurants\n\nNightlife\n\nShopping\n\nHotels\n\nPlan Your Visit\n\nWhere to Stay in NYC\n\nTop Things To Do In Greenwich Village\n\nBelow we list the best attractions and things to do in this wonderful neighborhood, including seasonal events so you can see what's going on when you are here.\n\nWe also recommend restaurants and places to stay.\n\nTo get to know this special neighborhood, join one of our pay-what-you-like guided tours!\n\nWe also offer a GPS audio tour you can take at any time.\n\nGreenwich Village Seasonal Events and Activities\n\nThere's plenty to do year-round, as you will see just below.\n\nBut first, here are three upcoming Village annual traditions happening this Fall and Winter.\n\nAnnual Village Halloween Parade\n\nOctober 31, 2024. Each year thousands of New Yorkers line 6th Avenue to see the most creative Halloween costumes you will ever see! Read more about it here.\n\nChristmas in Washington Square Park\n\nThe annual Christmas Tree lighting occurs the first week in December (2024 date TBA).\n\nOn Christmas Eve at 5 p.m., join the locals in the park for Christmas caroling.\n\nWinter Jazzfest\n\nJanuary 9-15, 2025, featuring 100 bands across the city, with many performing in Greenwich Village, home to famous jazz clubs. Find out more.\n\nTHINGS TO DO YEAR-ROUND\n\nWashington Square Park\n\nThis park is the heart of Greenwich Village. It's one of the best places to sit and relax and watch the world go by.\n\nIn the 1960s, hippies hung out here and played folk music. Today it's still a place where people gather, sing songs, hang out, and be themselves.\n\nAt the north end of the park is the historic Washington Square Arch, built in 1892 to commemorate the centennial of George Washington's inauguration.\n\nThe arch marks the end of Fifth Avenue.\n\nOn the southwest corner of the park are the legendary chess tables where Bobby Fischer and other world-famous players have played.\n\nYou can even get in on a game if you dare!\n\nRead more about the history of Washington Square Park here.\n\nSee The Friends Apartment Building\n\nAt the corner of Bedford Street and Grove Street, you may come across a small crowd looking up at a not particularly interesting building.\n\nWhat makes this building such a famous attraction is that it is where Monica and Rachel lived from Friends, one of the most beloved TV shows of the 1990s.\n\nThere is some irony in the fact that Monica and Rachel, who did not have large incomes, lived in Greenwich Village, one of the most expensive neighborhoods in Manhattan.\n\nBut fans of the show know the secret of how they were able to afford living here.\n\nFind out by reading our post on visiting the Friends building which also includes other Friends locations in NYC.\n\nGet to Know the West Village on a Tour\n\nWe offer several Greenwich Village walking tours, including a ghost tour and a food tour.\n\nSearching Availability...\n\nSeveral tourist concession passes include a free tour of Greenwich Village.\n\nIf you prefer to explore the Village at your own pace, use our self-guided Greenwich Village Tour or our GPS-enabled audio tour narrated by one of our tour guides.\n\nHave a Cappuccino at Caffe Reggio\n\nThe United States owes a big thanks to this cafe and its original owner, Domenico Parisi, who introduced Cappucino to America in 1902.\n\nIt's located at 119 Macdougal Street and worth a visit to sip on a frothy Cappuccino and people-watch on this very lively street.\n\nAfterward, walk south on Macdougal St. to get a sense of what the West Village is all about.\n\nStroll Down Bleecker Street\n\nBleecker Street is one of the most popular streets in Greenwich Village, especially when it crosses into the West Village, where there are great restaurants and boutique shopping.\n\nBleecker Street is named for the Bleecker family who, in 1808, deeded a large part of this farmland to New York City.\n\nIt’s hard to believe this street was part of a farm!\n\nFor much of the 20th century, the Village was known as a neighborhood for bohemians.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, it was a hub for Beatnik poets and writers like Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, and William Burroughs.\n\nThe folk music scene blossomed in Greenwich Village in its intimate music venues along Bleecker Street, like The Bitter End.\n\nYou can still see great live music here (see the section on Nightlife below).\n\nSome of the best bites to be had in the Village are stops on our Food Tour of Greenwich Village.\n\nWatch an Off-Broadway Show at the Cherry Lane Theatre\n\nThe Cherry Lane Theatre opened in 1924 and has presented works by some of the most famous American playwrights including Eugene O’Neill, Sam Shepard, and David Mamet.\n\nGreenwich Village has several theaters, some almost over 100 years old!\n\nThey offer all types of performances and they are generally less expensive than Broadway shows.\n\nSee the section on Nightlife below for a listing of other theaters.\n\nBe sure to check our post about how to get concessionary tickets on Off-Broadway and Broadway shows and plays.\n\nAdmire The Historic Architecture\n\nIn Greenwich Village, you can find Federal-style homes from the early 1800s as well as Greek-Revival townhouses.\n\nThere is the gorgeous Victorian Neo-Gothic Jefferson Market Library from the mid-1800s. It was built as a women-only jail!\n\nPeek through the gated entrance to Grove Court, located on Grove Street between Bedford and Hudson Streets.\n\nAt 75 1/2 Bedford Street, you can see the narrowest house in Manhattan. It's just 10 feet (9m) wide!\n\nYou'll see several attached three-story Federal houses built in 1847. They are now multi-million dollar condominiums.\n\nWe stop by many of these historic houses on our walking tours of Greenwich Village.\n\nWalk Along One of NYC’s Smallest Streets\n\nSnugly fit between Christopher Street and Waverly Place in Greenwich Village is Gay Street.\n\nJust one block long, it is one of NYC’s shortest streets.\n\nIn the late 18th century, the street was an alley for horse stables. As horse carriages were replaced by cars, the street widened.\n\nIt was not lengthened though and is one of NYC’s shortest streets. Read more about other famous streets in NYC.\n\nThe origin of its name is not definitive and one possibility is that it is named after the Gay family that lived in the area.\n\nIt is pure coincidence that Gay Street is in a neighborhood known for its large LGBTQ community.\n\nEat Your Way Down Macdougal Street\n\nGreenwich Village is known for its food scene. You can find an array of ethnic cuisine here at budget prices, especially along MacDougal Street.\n\nAlong Macdougal between West 3rd Street and Bleecker Street are Taco Village (Mexican), Thelewala (Indian), Saigon Shack (Vietnamese), Pommes Frites (Belgian-style French fries), Munchiez (Chinese snacks), Artichoke Pizza and Mamoun’s Falafel.\n\nIf you want to sample some of the Village's best food, come on our pay-what-you-wish Food Tour of Greenwich Village.\n\nWe stop at Artichoke and Mamoun's because they are simply the best on the block!\n\nCan't make our scheduled tour?\n\nYou can try our GPS-Enabled Audio Tour, which can be taken day or night.\n\nAlternatively, you may also want to try a fully guided Greenwich Village Pizza & Gelato tour from the popular company Take Walks.\n\nBelow we list some of our favorite places to eat in all price ranges.\n\nSee The Stonewall Inn and Gay Liberation Monument\n\nFor four days in 1969, the Stonewall was the site of a riot by the LGBTQ community in response to police actions that paved the way for the Gay Rights Movement in the United States.\n\nIts historic significance makes it a must-see attraction in Greenwich Village. Across the street is a small park with the Gay Liberation Monument.\n\nThe monument sculpture by artist George Segal commemorates the historic events at the Stonewall Inn and pays tribute to those who fought against the oppression of the LBGTQ community.\n\nStonewall is still an operating bar, and a living memorial to the events of June 28, 1969. It's officially a National Historic Landmark.\n\nRead an in-depth history of the Stonewall Inn Riots.\n\nStop By Carrie Bradshaw's Stoop\n\nFor fans of the tv show, Sex, and the City, this is a must-see sight.\n\nAlthough Carrie Bradshaw lived on the Upper East Side, her stoop is actually a building in Greenwich Village.\n\nOur post about Sex and the City locations explains how to find the building.\n\nRead more about other film locations in Greenwich Village. You are sure to recognize many of them!\n\nWatch Great Basketball for Free\n\nThe iconic West Fourth Street Courts are where the best locals come to shoot hoops.\n\nNicknamed “the cage” because of the 20-foot chain-link fence around the playing surface. This small non-regulation size court ups the ante and games can get quite intense.\n\nOver the years the Cage has produced NBA stars like legendary Dr. J (Julius Irving), Dwight Howard, Jayson Williams, and Anthony Mason.\n\nGrab a spot along the chain-linked fence for the kind of close-up view you won't get at a professional game.\n\nThe court is at 6th Avenue between West 3rd Street and West 4th Street.\n\nShop Small\n\nGreenwich Village is the place to go if you’re looking for unique, eclectic, or handmade items.\n\nThere are very few neighborhoods in NYC where you can still find old-school record stores selling vinyl.\n\nThe neighborhood is also known for its chess shops, conveniently located near Washington Square Park's chess corner mentioned above.\n\nThere are also lots of candy shops, small non-chain bookstores, and the oldest apothecary in America, C.O. Bigelow at 414 6th Ave.\n\nCheck below for a list of some of the one-of-a-kind shops in Greenwich Village.\n\nHear Live Jazz\n\nOne of the very best venues to hear Jazz is the Village Vanguard at 178 7th Avenue South.\n\nThis renowned jazz club opened in 1935 and John Coltrane and Sonny Rollins were among the long list of performers.\n\nMost shows cost $30+ per person but line-ups are awesome. Reservations are a good idea.\n\nWalk in Bob Dylan's Footsteps\n\nIf one name is synonymous with Greenwich Village, it has to be Bob Dylan.\n\nHe hung out at cafes, writing songs, and conversing with Beatniks. He got his start performing at small venues like Cafe Wha and the Bitter End.\n\nThe cover of his breakthrough album, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan was photographed on Jones St. in the Village.\n\nUse our self-guided tour of Bob Dylan's Greenwich Village to see Dylan's haunts in the Village.\n\nVisit Nearby Neighborhoods\n\nAt the far northwest boundary of Greenwich Village is the entrance to the High Line, an amazing urban park, built on top of an abandoned elevated railroad.\n\nSouth of Greenwich Village is SoHo and to the east is the appropriately named East Village, both great neighborhoods to spend time in.\n\nHave a Good Laugh at the Comedy Cellar\n\nThe Comedy Cellar at 117 MacDougal St. has been showcasing top-notch comedy since 1982.\n\nComedians Chris Rock, Aziz Ansari, and Dave Chappelle have performed here.\n\nYour ticket gets you between five to seven comics performing 20-minute sets.\n\nThe chances are good that you’ll see at least one or two hysterical performances.\n\nSee more comedy clubs below.\n\nSee American Masters at the Whitney Museum\n\nAt the southernmost entrance to the High Line at Gansevoort St. and Washington St. is the esteemed Whitney Museum of American Art.\n\nThis museum's collection focuses entirely on contemporary American art from 20th and 21st-century artists like Edward Hopper, Jasper Johns, Georgia O'Keefe, and Mark Rothko.\n\nAdmission is free on Fridays from 7 pm-10 pm. See our post on other free museums in NYC.\n\nCatch an Independent Movie at the IFC Center\n\nThe IFC Center is an arthouse cinema showing first-run independent, foreign, and documentary features across its five screens.\n\nThis movie theater regularly has midnights and weekend classics series and occasional repertory series.\n\nIt's a popular spot in Greenwich Village for a night of entertainment.\n\nNibble on World Cheeses at Murray's Cheese\n\nSince 1962, Murray's Cheese has been a prime destination for New York City's cheese lovers.\n\nThey have an incredible selection of cheese imported from around the world. Whatever you are craving, Murray's carries it!\n\nMurray's also sells charcuterie meats and all sorts of savory and sweet treats to serve up with your cheese plate.\n\nThey even have classes such as \"Hands-on Mozzarella Making\" and \"The Basics of Wine Pairing\".\n\nMurray's is not to be missed.\n\nSing Broadway Tunes at Marie’s Crisis Cafe\n\nFor a wacky night out, head to Marie’s Crisis Cafe, for cabaret sing-alongs that last into the wee hours of the morning.\n\nMarie’s is primarily a gay bar, but not exclusively. Anyone who loves show tunes is welcome!\n\nMarie’s sits on the location where Revolutionary War era American philosopher and political theorist Thomas Paine lived for a while and died in 1809.\n\nThe current building was constructed in 1838 and used as a brothel, and eventually just a bar.\n\nIt was bought in 1929 by Marie DuMont and the bar became \"Marie's\".\n\nThe Crisis in the name comes from Paine’s pamphlet, The American Crisis. (1776).\n\nRestaurants in Greenwich Village\n\nBelow are some of our favorite places to eat in the Village.\n\nYou can get more suggestions and details from our post on 14 Top Greenwich Village Restaurants.\n\nCheap (under $20)\n\nBleecker Street Pizza 69 7th Ave.\n\nKnown for their Nonna Maria slice, with a thin crispy crust and fresh mozzarella cheese.\n\nIt's so good we stop there on our Greenwich Village Food Tour!\n\nMamoun's 119 MacDougal St.\n\nThis is the ultimate in cheap, amazingly good Middle Eastern food.\n\nA menu staple for Villagers for over 4o years, you cannot beat the prices and the taste.\n\nOpen until 5 a.m. every day!\n\nSaigon Shack 114 MacDougal St.\n\nTasty Vietnamese noodles and sandwiches.
