        "text": "Our History\n\nAny discussion about American music that doesn’t include Muscle Shoals, Alabama isn’t really a discussion at all. Heart-pounding. Soul-shaking. Iconic. Many words have been used to describe the Muscle Shoals sound. It’s the sound that implored a generation of musicians to travel to the southern banks of the Tennessee river, searching for a bit of that Muscle Shoals magic. Fame Recording Studios is where it all Started and where that sound lives on today.\n\nOriginally housed above City drugstore in Florence, Alabama, Florence Alabama Music Enterprises was founded in 1959 by Rick Hall, Billy Sherrill and Tom Stafford.\n\nIn 1960, Hall took over sole ownership and shortened the name to the acronym FAME and temporarily moved to Wilson Dam Highway in Muscle Shoals. This is where Muscle Shoals would have its first international success. With Arthur Alexander’s “You Better Move On”. Hall took that money, along with a borrowed $10,000, built and moved the studio to its current location at 603 East Avalon Avenue, Muscle Shoals. Beginning with the legendary session that produced Jimmy Hughes’ “Steal Away”, FAME has been producing chart-topping hits ever since.\n\nThe famous sign above the entryway into FAME’s studios reads: “Through these doors walk the finest Musicians, Songwriters, Artists, and Producers in the World”. This is as true today as it was in 1961. Since it first opened its doors, FAME has welcomed a literal who’s who of music royalty from Etta James, Wilson Pickett, and Aretha Franklin to Alicia Keys, Demi Lovato, and Jason Isbell. They have all come searching for the beautiful, soulful, sonic footprint that defines FAME Recording Studios.\n\nFAME Recording Studios’ lush acoustics and unique musical legacy have made it one of the most sought after recording studios in the world. It’s the room where Aretha Franklin found her sound. It’s the room where Wilson Pickett whaled on “Mustang Sally”. It’s where Clarence Carter has recorded for five decades. It’s the room that continually produces chart-topping, generation-defining music year after year after year, including the 2019 #1 Americana album Muscle Shoals – Small Town Big Sound which included #1 Americana single, Grace Potter’s “I’d Rather Go Blind”\n\nFAME Publishing was founded in 1959 by Rick Hall, Billy Sherrill and Tom Stafford.\n\nFAME writers Billy Sherrill, Dan Penn and Rick Hall have cuts on Roy Orbison, Brenda Lee and Tommy Roe.\n\nRick Hall took over as sole owner of FAME.\n\nLate 1961 Rick Hall produced Muscle Shoals’ first hit record on Arthur Alexander. The song, “You Better Move On”, was later covered by the Rolling Stones.\n\nFAME’s first house rhythm section included Norbert Putnam, David Briggs, Peanut Montgomery and Jerry Carrigan.\n\nFAME moves its studios and offices to the current location on Avalon Avenue in Muscle Shoals.\n\nJimmy Hughes has a huge hit with “Steal Away” on FAME Records, the first record done at the new location. Hughes went on to have seven hit records most of which were for FAME Records.\n\nThe Tams record their huge hit “What Kind Of Fool Do You Think I Am”.\n\nBuddy Killen brings Joe Tex to FAME to record the gold record “Hold On To What You’ve Got”.\n\nRick Hall produces Etta James’ Tell Mama album. This was James’ biggest hit. This album has been praised as one of the greatest albums of the Rock and Roll era. “Tell Mama” was written by Clarence Carter and published by FAME.\n\nFAME helps place the Muscle Shoals classic “When A Man Loves A Woman”. FAME Records Clarence Carter has his very first hit with “Slip Away”. Clarence went on to record three gold records, “Patches” , “Too Weak to Fight” and “Slip Away” among many other hits at FAME. Clarence’s recent recording marks the fifth consecutive decade that he has cut at FAME. Clarence was also a writer for FAME Publishing. In 1972 Clarence’s record “Patches” was nominated for a Grammy.\n\nWilson Pickett comes to FAME to fire off a string of classic recordings. “Mustang Sally”, “Funky Broadway”, “Land of 1000 Dances” and “Hey Jude” featuring Duane Allman are only some of the songs that came from these sessions.\n\nJerry Wexler brings his newly signed artist Aretha Franklin to FAME. Franklin had been signed to Columbia for four years with no success. Her first cut at FAME was the million selling double sided smash, “I Never Loved A Man” and “Do Right Woman”. This album won a Grammy for Album of the Year. FAME also published “Do Right Woman”.\n\nOtis Redding brings Arthur Conley to FAME to record the soul classic “Sweet Soul Music”. On a later visit to FAME Otis cut one of his last records, “You Left The Water Running” which was also published by FAME.\n\nThe second house rhythm section, later memorialized as the “Swampers” in Lynyrd Skynrd’s “Sweet Home Alabama”, left in 1969 to form their own studio, Muscle Shoals Sound.\n\nFAME Records inks a joint venture with Capitol Records for Capitol to distribute FAME Records. FAME’s artist roster included: Clarence Carter, Candi Staton, Dan Penn, Arthur Conley and Willie Hightower. In 1970 Mike Curb brought a new young group, the Osmonds, to FAME. The Osmonds sold eleven million records in 1971. They had a string of smashes with “One Bad Apple”, “Yo-Yo”, and “Down By The Lazy River”. Donny released several FAME recorded solo albums which were all million sellers, including the hits “Go Away Little Girl” and the Rick Hall/Billy Sherrill song “Sweet and Innocent”. In 1974 Marie Osmond came to town to do her This is the Way That I Feel album. The Osmond Brothers returned to FAME in the 80’s to do their first country record, and had two hits off of the Electra album. Marie also returned to do some work in the 90’s. In 2001 Marie’s son Steven Craig came to Muscle Shoals for a little magic on his upcoming Def Jam release.\n\n1970 Rick Hall was nominated for a Grammy in the “Producer of the Year” category.\n\nIn 1971 Mac Davis started recording a string of twelve albums of FAME.
