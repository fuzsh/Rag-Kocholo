        "text": "'Eeny Meeny and Moe' (Teen Town Comics #48).\n\nHoward Post was been active in the fields of comic books and animation since the 1940s. Publishing in comic books since the mid-1940s, he was best known for his funny animal work, among others in National/DC's 'More Fun Comics'. He did features like 'Stone Age Stan' in titles like Slapstick, and did cartoon and funny animal features for Feature Comics.\n\nFrom the early 1950s on, Post was a regular at Harvey Comics. He drew 'Spooky, the Tuff Little Ghost', and from 1957 on, was the main artist on Harvey's 'Hot Stuff', about a little devil in a surreal environment. He also wrote and drew stories with other Harvey characters, including 'Richie Rich' and 'Casper the Friendly Ghost'.\n\n'Frank Furter' (Teen Town Comics #48).\n\nPost also did DC's light adventure comic 'Anthro' as well as several other funny animal, western and personality strips, such as 'Jiminy & the Magic Book', 'Doodles Duck', 'J. Rufus Lion', 'Bob Hope' and 'Dean Martin & Jerry Lewis'. Between 1968 and 1982, he drew the syndicated strip 'The Dropouts' for United Features. For Marvel, Post illustrated horror and funny animal stories (a.o. 'Nellie the Nurse', 'The Monkey and the Bear') in the 1950s. He returned to the company in the 1980s with art on licensed titles like 'Strawberry Shortcake', 'Care Bears', 'Heathcliff' and 'Danger Mouse'.\n\n'Dropouts'.\n\nPost also worked in animation, at first as an in-betweener and animator for Famous Studios, later as a storyman and as the creative head of Paramount's cartoon studio in the early 1960s. He also taught at the School of Visual Arts for several years. He passed away from complications due to Alzheimer's in May 2010.\n\nHoward Post was an influence on John Kricfalusi."
