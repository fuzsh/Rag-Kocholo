        "text": "Howard Beckerman of Flushing, NY was born on December 25, 1930 in the Bronx and grew up in Brooklyn. He passed away in the early morning of Saturday June 29, 2024 at Calvary Hospital. He was 93 years of age.\n\nHoward is survived by his loving children Mara Sneiderman (Richard), Sheri Weisz (Gaston), and Amy Zarndt (John); his grandchildren Shayna Brubaker (Thomas), Naomi Sneiderman, Danielle and Jeffrey Weisz, and Jamie Zarndt; and his great-grandchild, Everett Brubaker, who he was lucky enough to get to know before his passing; his many extended family members, loyal colleagues, and the many hundreds of students he took so much joy in teaching at the School of Visual Arts, Parsons School of Design, and NY Phoenix School of Design in Manhattan for over 40 years. Howard was predeceased by his wife, Iris, also a gifted illustrator as well as actor and dancer.\n\nDuring his long and storied career as an animator, writer, and director Howard worked on Mighty Mouse, Heckle & Jeckle, Popeye, and Winky-Dink (among others) for Terrytoons and Paramount Famous Studios. Through his own company, he created films for Sesame Street and national advertisers. He wrote over 500 articles for trade magazines and was most proud of the widely praised book he authored, Animation: The Whole Story, a compendium of his decades of knowledge and experience.\n\nHoward will be remembered for his ever present sense of humor, his passion for making art and teaching, his encyclopedic knowledge of the history of animation, his gifts for storytelling, his uncanny Popeye impression, and the indelible mark he has left on the fields of animation and cartooning, for which he received numerous accolades in life and which will continue to shape and influence the mediums for years to come."
