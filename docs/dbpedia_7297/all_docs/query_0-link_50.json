        "text": "In a busy city like NYC, being able to disconnect from the hustle bustle and unwind your body and mind is key. When it comes to fitness options, you’ll find gyms and studios galore to help you on your health journey. But what if you want to find specific studios and exercise types to keep you moving? Lately, pilates in the city has been on the rise, thanks to its focus on strengthening both body and mind! While some gyms can offer classes, it’s usually better to go to a pilates-specific studio. If you’re interested in training your body with some of the best trainers and equipment in the country, we’ve got the list for you. These studios are the best spots to find your new home for pilates in New York City.\n\n1. Avea Pilates\n\nPraised as a hidden gem of Manhattan, Avea Pilates is first on our list and has three different locations to choose from. With modern and clean equipment, and classes designed to always give you personalized attention, it’s perfect for pilates in NYC. The style of instruction here is a mix of both classical and contemporary pilates, ensuring that you’ll find a workout flow that’s best for you. Classes here are also offered for all skill levels, physical abilities or body types, making Avea one of the most inclusive and accessible studios around. Classes start at $40 a piece or can be packaged up into deals of multiple classes!\n\nWhere:\n\nEast Village – 130 E 7th St, Fl 2\n\nWest Village – 3 W 13th St, Fl 2\n\nKips Bay – 314 E 34th St, Fl 4\n\n2. New York Pilates\n\nOne of the most well-known pilates spots is the namesake New York Pilates, favored by the fashionable fitness enthusiasts of the city. Of course, you don’t have to be an A-lister to get access here; and, with four locations in the city (and more on Long Island), finding your perfect place to access is easier than ever. With locations in West Village, Bowery, SoHo, and soon Flatiron, you’re sure to find a spot that works for you. New York Pilate’s signature class style of “ABS, ARMS, and ASS” is personally our favorite, and will surely have you sweating like you never have before. With lights, music, and amazing instructors to guide you every step of the way, this is one high-intensity workout you’re sure to fall in love with.\n\nWhere:\n\nSoho – 25 Howard St, Fl 3\n\nWest Village – 124 W Houston St\n\nBowery – 262 Bowery, Fl 2\n\n3. Dynamic Body Pilates\n\nFor one of the better pilates studios for mobility, fitness, and ease, Dynamic Body Pilates is a quieter, boutique location. Though you can get typical pilates classes here, the true emphasis here is on physical therapy and pain management type exercises. No matter who you are or what type of health you’re in, the dedicated team will do everything they can to teach you how to move your body with ease and grace. Described as expert, creative, focused, and motivational, the trainers can come up with a custom routine to meet your personalized needs – making sure you feel seen and safe during every step of the journey. Their Union Square studio is inspired by the Alexander Technique, Feldenkrais, alongside dozens of other movement modalities, meaning there’s truly an option for every client.\n\nWhere: 80 Fifth Ave, Ste 1003\n\n4. Body Evolutions\n\nWhen you’re seeking a simpler, more Zen style of pilates, Body Evolutions keeps classes small, straightforward, and stylish. What sets Body Evolutions apart from other pilates studios in NYC is their dedication to assisting clients both young and old and helping them be able to experience the joy of moving freely. Their studio is bright with natural sunshine and plant-filled, making it the perfect calm environment while you work out. The best part is their private sessions that are custom-crafted to meet your goals and provide in-depth, one-on-one support each time.\n\nWhere:\n\nEast Village – 266 E 10th St\n\nUnion Square – 857 Broadway, 2nd Fl\n\nUWS – 140 W 72nd St, 2nd Fl\n\n5.
