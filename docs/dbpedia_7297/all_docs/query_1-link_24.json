        "text": "Ben: Welcome to season 14 episode 5 of Acquired, the podcast about great companies and the stories and playbooks behind them. Iâm Ben Gilbert.\n\nDavid: Iâm David Rosenthal.\n\nBen: And we are your hosts. Seven years ago, David and I did an episode on the Starbucks IPO, just the IPO. That episode was a mere 1 hour and 24 minutes, and Starbucks is a $90 billion institution in our world that deserves the full Acquired treatment.\n\nDavid: What were we thinking?\n\nBen: Well, it actually was amateur hour back then, David.\n\nDavid: Got to start somewhere.\n\nBen: Well today, we have a very special third co-host to discuss this third place, Howard Schultz. Howard started working at the small chain of three Starbucks stores in 1982, eventually buying it and becoming CEO. As you probably know, he is effectively the founder of the Starbucks we know today that exists on every corner of the earth.\n\nI come to you, David, and listeners as an unabashed Starbucks fan. In this tumultuous time for the company, I am absolutely pulling for them in every way possible, and that is going to come through in our conversation.\n\nYou may have seen the news recently that they had a very rough last quarter with a key metric that you may remember from previous episodes as same store sales. These dropped and their stock price plummeted as a result. This is on top of a tumultuous pandemic era, some of their stores unionizing, and a change in leadership.\n\nWe thought that this would be the perfect time to sit down with Howard and unpack why Starbucks worked in the first place, and how it works at such a grand scale. What can other founders and business leaders learn from what got them here? And although he is no longer CEO, where do they go now?\n\nDavid: It really is incredible. One of the very, very small number of food and beverage establishments that has scaled to the entire world.\n\nBen: Most of those types of concepts do not work in different countries and continents. But Starbucks is different. Today, theyâre in over 80 countries with 39,000 stores across the world. Theyâre even huge in China, a country that didnât consume very much coffee until Starbucks arrived.\n\nThey are a bank scale financial institution as well. At any given time, Starbucks holds $1.7 billion that customers have loaded onto gift cards but not yet spent. So how did they go from one store selling beansânot even drinks and cups, just beansâto the default meeting place in communities everywhere? Today, we tell that story. And listeners, this episode has video. We recorded it in person in Seattle at the Schultz Family Foundation, and you can watch it on YouTube.\n\nAll right, well listeners, we have a gigantic announcement for you.\n\nDavid: Yes. Save the date. If you love Acquired, you are going to want to be physically in the city of San Francisco on Tuesday, September 10th, 2024.\n\nBen: And we canât say much about every detail of it just yet, but it will be the biggest thing that Acquired has ever done. Itâll be in partnership with our good friends at J.P. Morgan Payments. So mark your calendars now. Save the date. And if you want to be first to know details, you can sign up at acquired.fm/sf or click the links in the show notes.\n\nDavid: Speaking of J.P. Morgan Payments, just like how we say every company has a story, every companyâs story is powered by payments, and J.P. Morgan payments is a part of so many companiesâ journeys from seed to IPO and beyond.\n\nBen: And if you want more from David and I, you should check out our second show, ACQ2, where we interview founders, investors, and experts, often as deeper dives into topics that we covered on the main show.\n\nRecent episodes have been awesome with the CEO and the founder of Synopsys, of Starfish Space, further exploring the space industry, and weâve got some great stuff in payments coming up next, too.\n\nDavid: We do.\n\nBen: All right, so with that, this show is not investment advice. David and I may have investments in the companies that we discuss, and this show is for informational and entertainment purposes only. Onto our episode with Howard Schultz.\n\nWell, I do have to tell you, and I think Iâve told you this off camera, for the last almost 10 years, every single day starts with a spinach in feta wrap. I assume there are other people like me in the world, but itâs always an iced almond milk latte with whipped cream and a spinach in feta wrap. So thank you for powering approximately a third of the cells in my body.\n\nHoward: Oh God, thatâs a great start.\n\nBen: I alsoâhereâs another stat that Davidâ¦\n\nDavid: Youâve done the math on.\n\nBen: I have done the math. I exported all of my credit card transactions since 2011.\n\nHoward: Of course you did.\n\nBen: And I wish I had more history than that, but that was the oldest I could get. Iâve spent $23,000 at Starbucks since 2011.\n\nHoward: Oh God. Okay.\n\nBen: We want to start with Starbucks 1.0. Listeners may know that there were three founders of Starbucks, none of which were named Howard Schultz.\n\nHoward: Correct.\n\nBen: So take us back in the Starbucks prehistory before you arrived. How did the company start?\n\nHoward: Well, since I wasnât there, this is what I know. There were three founders, Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl and Gordon Bowker. The story that was told to me is that one or both of them were going to school in California in the Bay Area, and they became enamored with Peetâs coffee company whichâ\n\nBen: Alfred Peet?\n\nHoward: Yeah. Alfred Peet, more than anyone else in the history of coffee in America, was the true pioneer. He brought specialty coffee, Arabica coffee to Northern California. Jerry Baldwin and Zev became so interested and intrigued with what Peetâs was doing, and given the fact that they were from Seattle, decided they would try and bring Starbucks coffee in the form of Starbucks to Seattle, Washington.\n\nNow, what is not known is that when Starbucks opened in the Pike Place Market in 1971, they were using Peetâs coffee.\n\nBen: Really?\n\nHoward: No one knows that. Thatâs new. Because they were not roasting coffee. They were bringing coffee from San Francisco to Seattle. They were not calling it Peetâs. They were calling it Starbucks.\n\nBen: It was Peetâs coffee in Starbucks bags.\n\nHoward: Yeah. Again, I wasnât there, but thatâs the folklore. After the three founders built that store, opened that store, I get the sense that there was some fallout between the three of them. Zev Siegl eventually left the company.\n\nThat brings us to 1979â1980, around that time when I came to Seattle, Washington for the first time. I was working for a Swedish housewares company based in Sweden called Hammarplast. That company had a beautiful, non-electric coffee maker, kind of a thermal unit.\n\nWe had a big customer in Macyâs in Northern California. I was in California on a sales call and I had heard that there was a small company in Seattle, Washington that was buying a lot of this product. Given the fact Iâd never been to Seattle, I was already on the West coast, I figured Iâd come to Seattle and see what was going on.\n\nDavid: Was Starbucks buying it for use inâ¦\n\nHoward: They were selling it in their store.\n\nDavid: Because this was a consumer device.\n\nHoward: Yeah, but you have to remember. Starbucks coffee company from 1971 until around 1985â1986 only sold pounds of coffee. There was no beverage. Weâre going to get into the epiphany of that. I walked into the Pike Place store for the first time on a beautiful day just like this.\n\nThe sun was out, there was snow on the mountains, the clean, fresh air, and I walked into the Pike Place Market. I walked into the Starbucks store, and I was blown away by the experience, the romance of coffee, the education. It just spoke to me.\n\nI had never met Jerry Baldwin, the founder, who was the CEO at the time. I became interested and intrigued with what Starbucks was doing, and asked if I could meet Jerry.\n\nOne thing led to another, I met Jerry Baldwin, we really hit it off, and we established a vendor-customer relationship over a course of a year or so. Starbucks had three stores at the time, only three. Over the course of the next year or so, I became more and more interested and intrigued with the possibility of leaving New York City.\n\nSheri and I were dating, weâre not married, and I maneuvered my way into a job working for Starbucks. So Sheri and I drove to Seattle, Washington on Labor Day weekend in our old Audi car with a golden retriever. We came here because I was offered the job as the head of marketing for Starbucks when they were getting ready to open their fourth store in 1982.\n\nDavid: Still just selling beans.\n\nHoward: Only beans. Yeah, still the beans. The interest that the company had in me at the time (I think) was they were really interested in expanding, but their dream or the plan at the time was, could we expand to Portland, Oregon? Remember it was a tiny company.\n\nBen: It was a grand ambition.\n\nHoward: Yeah, and I never had any idea (of course) what was about to happen and unfold over the subsequent years. I arrived in 1982 as a head of marketing.\n\nDavid: When you and Sheri arrive here, what was the coffee landscape? There were these three-soon-to-be-four Starbucks beans stores right here in Seattle. Alfred Peet was down in the Bay Area. What was coffee culture? I mean, it was like Folgers and Maxwell House, right?\n\nHoward: Yeah, it was de minimis. It was another coffee company, which was Seattleâs Best Coffee, which was another retailer that was at the same size and scale at Starbucks, both equal at the same time. But you couldnât even get a New York Times in Seattle in 1982â1983. It was no good food to speak of, and Starbucks was a true pioneer where they were educating customer after customer about what good coffee tastes like.\n\nThe Pike Place Market gave them an interesting vehicle because of the tourists. So Starbucks actually started establishing a mail order business as a result of all the people who were coming into Seattle. If I remember, there were so many points that I can remember where people were talking about Starbucks way outside of Seattle as if it was some iconic big company. I think people came to Seattle and were like, this is it? This is the 800â900 square foot store in Seattle, Washington and Pike Place Market. This is the Mecca.\n\nBen: Tourists would come, they would buy a bag, and then they would fill out some information, say Iâd like to have this mailed to me. Because I donât have anything like it in my city.\n\nHoward: Yeah, thatâs what happened. And because coffee has a shelf life of basically a week to 10 days, and we didnât have a vacuum bag at that time, we were shipping small amounts because to Jerry Baldwinâs credit, he had such a fastidious point of view about quality and freshness, and I think that had a huge impact on me.\n\nDavid: But this couldnât have been a great business. Youâre shipping small amounts. . The logistics costs, the scaleâ¦\n\nHoward: This was a small business, but the equity of the brand even back then was much larger than the size of the business. The opportunity that I saw, even when we had four or five stores, was well beyond Portland, Oregon. I was always pushing, we could do so much more, and then the whole thing blew up for me when I went to Italy in 1983.\n\nBen: Before the Italy trip, I just want to really contextualize coffee in America. I think coffee has been declining since like 1940. Itâs still part of the American culture, but itâs not that itâs on the way out. Thereâs nothing new or interesting except for this little segment ofâ\n\nHoward: Especially coffee, which was tiny. I think what youâve just described, the reason for that is that coffee was terrible. It was instant coffee, stale coffee, and primarily Robusta beans, which was the low-grade coffee that Starbucks was never involved in.\n\nDavid: Walk us through the two types of beans.\n\nHoward: Thereâs mainly two types of agricultural coffee grown for commercial useâRobusta beans, low-end coffee, primarily in instant coffee, and high-grade Arabica coffee. But even within the Arabica coffee, thereâs significant segments of quality and integrity, and Starbucks has always played from 1971 to today at the highest level.\n\nDavid: My understanding from our research is that the Robusta market really developed (as you say) with the instant coffee market, and that was a product of World War II. It was like, hey, we got to get the troops this product to survive. We just need a lot of beans, and we need to ground them up and create this instant product. I believe Maxwell House was involved in inventing.\n\nHoward: Youâre exactly right. It was just fuel, bitter, acidic. I think World War II and the GIs were the impetus for that quality coffee, or not quality coffee to exist and have any run after the war.\n\nBen: So you show up at Starbucks, you know a little bit about the market because youâve been a supplier of theirs, but you happen to be a pretty talented salesman from your time at Xerox. I want to make a tie here. Our previous episode was the Microsoft episode, or at least Microsoft Volume I. You were selling word processors made by Xerox. Tell me what word processors were in the mid-70s.\n\nHoward: My territory was 42nd to 48th Street, from Fifth Avenue to the river. I had to make 50 cold calls, physical cold calls a day. That was the job. The Xerox job taught me incredible amounts about not only selling, but humility. Because the rejection every day was so significant.\n\nYou put on your suit and tie, you go in an office buildingâthere was no security at that time; just go in and you go from the top floor to the bottomâand then there are other people selling other products who are doing the exact same thing. And you had to get by the receptionist. I was making $1000 a month and living at home when I started. Okay. The word processor was a big machine in which you are editing on that machine to basically create a letter.\n\nBen: Does it have a screen or is it like a typewriter?\n\nHoward: Itâs a typewriter. No screen.\n\nDavid: Itâs like a typewriter with a little bit of cache so you could fix mistakes for one line, right?\n\nHoward: Exactly. The job at Xerox at the time was like working for Google. Xerox and IBM were the two pillars of technology and high-tech companies. You told somebody youâre working at Xerox, you had a whole different patina that you were wow, thatâs working for Xerox, wow.\n\nBen: So you quitting what seemed like a stable or pretty good job to drive across the country to provincial little Seattle is nuts.\n\nHoward: I knew after a couple of years if I stayed at Xerox for a longer period of time, I was going to be locked in there. But Iâll tell you the story that got me to realize Iâve got to get out of here.\n\nAt the end of the year, the performance appraisal at Xerox was basically a scorecard from one to five. Youâd have a qualitative discussion with your manager, and then he would give you a number. When I got a three, I said to myself, I worked all year, I just had a performance appraisal for my manager, and Iâm a three.\n\nDavid: This is amazing. Howard Schultz got a three. This inspiration for all entrepreneurs out there.\n\nHoward: I got a three. As soon as I got to three, I swear at that moment, I knew Iâve got to get out of here. Thatâs when I started putting myself in a position of meet other opportunities, and by and large, I was able to get the Hammarplast job, which was the general manager of the company, which was based in Sweden in the US. But I was a three.\n\nDavid: Do you think having that background at Xerox give you a piece of perspective that helped build Starbucks to what it is today?\n\nHoward: When I hear the question, I have to go back to my childhood and think everything that Iâve experienced growing up in the projects in more or less a dysfunctional family because of the pressure of money. Getting the Xerox opportunity and having some level of success but realizing I wanted more, the humility which came with rejection, the shame I had as a poor kid living in the projects, all of that I think crystallized in me.\n\nI give Sheri so much credit in realizing that together we wanted to build a different life, and gave me the courage, the conviction, and the drive to try and do something that I felt I was destined to do. I didnât know what it was. I certainly didnât know moving to Seattle was going to create the opportunity of a lifetime. But I always felt I had to get out of that station in life where I was positioned not to get to the level that I thought I deserve to be.\n\nBen: I donât think it is common with someone for your backgroundâpoor kid in the projects coming from nothingâto get two great jobs, be wildly dissatisfied, and not feel like Iâve made it, but rather, no, thereâs got to be something more than this. Thereâs something deep inside you that caused you to be willing to take a risk.\n\nHoward: I was really insecure about not succeeding. I didnât view what I was doing as the success that I was, not destined forâthat sounds wrongâthat I had the appetite for.\n\nBen: All right, so weâre getting to the big risk. The year ticks over to 1983. You are sent, or maybe you asked to go to an international housewares conference in Milan. What do you discover?\n\nHoward: I went to a trade show called Macha with a big convention center. Itâs a giant houseware show with equipment and all kinds of stuff. I was staying at a relatively cheap hotel within walking distance to the convention center.\n\nI get out of the hotelâIâd never been to Italy beforeâand all of a sudden I am being intercepted with the physical manifestation of one coffee bar after another in the business that Iâm supposed to be in. But it wasnât the business that Starbucks was in.\n\nI walk in like a normal person thatâs never seen this before, and I am just like, Iâm in a black and white movie, and all of a sudden everything was color. It was so rich. I couldnât get enough of it. I just went from one to the other, to the other, to the other. I was just blown away, and more or less raced back to America, sat down with Jerry and Gordon, and said, holy shit. Whatâs happening in Italy is the business that Starbucks has to be in. They had seen it. Theyâve been to Italy. And they said, no, thatâs not what we want to do. I just said, seriously?\n\nI banged on the door for two years. In two years they finally let me open up a coffee bar on the corner of Fourth and Spring in Seattle. It was the sixth Starbucks store. Out of about 1200 square feet, I got 100 feet. I designed and opened the coffee bar, worked behind the counter as a barista. Starbucks probably had 200â300 customers a day selling/holding coffee. We were at 500 in a week introducing lattes, cappuccino, and espresso.\n\nBen: And thereâs nowhere else in town to get a cafÃ© latte.\n\nHoward: No one in Seattle had it. Well, CafÃ© Allegro had it and that was Dave Olsen. After a few months or six months or so, Jerry said, I donât want to repeat this. I donât want to do it. I donât want to be in the restaurant business.\n\nDavid: What was the objection? Was it the stigma of the restaurant business?\n\nHoward: I donât want to speak for Jerry, I have so much respect for him, but he didnât think it was clean. He didnât like it. Now, between 1983 and 1985, Jerry Baldwin, because of his love of Peetâs and his relation with Alfred Peet, had an opportunity for Starbucks to acquire Peetâs coffee company. And they did. Unfortunately, Starbucks buys Peetâs and they get into financial trouble.\n\nBen: So really at this point, it was like their mentor was retiring. This person who was a steward of the industry, weâre operating six points of retail distribution in Seattle for our beans. Why donât we just buy your effectively the same business, but in Northern California? Keep them separate for now.\n\nHoward: Well, itâs important to know that between the opening of the Fourth and Spring coffee bar inside of Starbucksâ\n\nBen: Starbucks number six.\n\nHoward: Yeah, and Jerry and Gordon saying, we donât want to repeat this, I was so frustrated. I said, Iâm going to leave Starbucks. What did I do? I had no money to open up a coffee store. Jerry says, Starbucks does not want to open up coffee bars, but we will invest in Il Giornale.\n\nDavid: Which was the company you started too.\n\nHoward: Yeah, so before they get into financial trouble, Starbucks is an investor. Iâve always thought he did that, so I would sell and market Starbucks coffee in the coffee bar, which I wouldâve done anyway.\n\nStarbucks makes an investment, a couple of people that we know make an investment, but I didnât have enough money. I go to see two Italian companies. Iâve never told this. One is the espresso company, Faema, and one is the large Italian coffee company, Lavazza. I asked them both to invest in my idea, and both of them turned me down.\n\nBen: At this point, youâre in Italy, youâre trying to get ideas and investors for what would become Il Giornale, and only Starbucks and a couple of other people have committed,\n\nHoward: But I didnât have enough money. I still needed more money.\n\nBen: You were raising $1.6 million?\n\nHoward: Yeah, about $1.6â$1.7 million. They said no one is going to buy Italian espresso in Seattle or in America.\n\nBen: Which is stupid because you watched it happen. I ran this store for six months and it was flying out.\n\nHoward: They didnât want to do it. Lavazza and Faemaâjust get that on the recordâturned me down, okay? Theyâll deny it. Thatâs a fact. So then I go back to the US, Iâm trying to raise money, and I hit the three titans in SeattleâJack Benaroya, Herman Sarkowsky, and Sam Strumâthree of the leading citizens of Seattle, Washington at the time.\n\nThe three of them have a little bit of an investment together in other things. They say, weâre going to believe in you, and they take me over the hump. We opened three Il Giornalesâtwo in Seattle, one in Vancouver, BCâand all three are doing well. All three. But I didnât have enough money to expand.\n\nDavid: And needing the money to expandâjust to pause on that for a minuteâbusinesswise, obviously coffee bars are a much better business long-term than coffee beans, but probably more capital-intensive, right? Needing more staff?\n\nHoward: More labor, yes. But the stores werenât that expensive to open because they were small, less than 1000 square feet. We understood how to do it. I was working as a barista with Dave Olsen and other people to keep the cost down. We were behind the counter and I had no salary. I had no salary for almost two years while Sheri was working and pregnant with our first child.\n\nBen: So looking increasingly worse from a traditional perspective of leaving a high-quality job, moving across the country, than just a couple of years later, here you are not making any money again, while raising millions of dollars to try to start your own business.\n\nHoward: It gets worse. Sheri is 6â7 months pregnant, sheâs working, her parents visits you. Theyâre from Ohio. Father asked me to take a walk.\n\nDavid: Oh no.\n\nHoward: As God as my witness, my true story. Take a walk. He says whatever youâre doing, I respect it, but itâs not a job. Itâs a hobby. You need to get a job. My daughterâs pregnant. Sheâs working. Youâre not. I start crying.\n\nBen: I bet\n\nHoward: Yeah, so embarrassed. I come home at 3â4 oâclock in the afternoon, whatever it is, I donât say a word, completely shaken by the whole conversation. Her parents go to bed after dinner, Iâm sitting with Sheri, and I said, I got to tell you something that happened. She was so angry at her dad and so upset. She said, thereâs no way weâre turning around. We are going.\n\nShe is the glue to everything thatâs happened. I donât know if she ever had a conversation with her fatherâIâm sure she didâbut the whole thing could have been over.\n\nBen: And that wouldâve been a very understandable response if Sheri had said, I wasnât going to say anything, but look at our situation objectively here.\n\nDavid: Putting ourselves in your father-in-lawâs shoes, how could you not feel that way for your daughter and her impending family?\n\nHoward: Her father was a great guy. I understood, but I was embarrassed and humiliated. How could I not be?\n\nDavid: I guess thatâs another dimension here, too. This was not 2024. Itâs not like being an entrepreneur was a glorified profession here.\n\nHoward: In a business that he clearly did not understand, a coffee store.\n\nBen: The other interesting thing to point out around this time is, for the people who were seeking high risk business investments, this is the late 80s. Itâs time to look at tech. Weâre now 12 years into Microsoft, Appleâs four years past the Macintosh, and youâre trying to raise money for a coffee house chain.\n\nHoward: With names that people couldnât pronounce, and serving it in a paper cup to-go.\n\nBen: That does not sound innovative to me. I donât know why Iâm putting my risk capital into yourâ¦\n\nHoward: I would bring investors to the two or three stores, and I would make sure there was a fair amount of people in the space. Thatâs when I started talking about the language of community in the third place. Thatâs what I saw in Italy. The unlock and the epiphany, of course it was the romance of espresso, but it was the sense of community. That is what was happening very early on in the two stores in Seattle and the one in Vancouver. You could see it.\n\nDavid: What would people do after they bought the coffee? You said, these are very small places.\n\nHoward: They would stand up because the two stores didnât have seating right away. They would stand up at the coffee bar at the window on Columbia Center. It was at 8â9 oâclock in the morning, they were hanging out there, and then late morning they were coming back. You could just feel the relationship that people were having with one another around human connection. I know it sounds trite, but I could see it back then.\n\nAs I was talking to people about the investment opportunity, I was pointing out, look, whatâs happening here. Thereâs something happening. Thereâs some magic going on here. Itâs not just the coffee. The coffee was the conduit.\n\nBen: All right, so weâre at the pivotal moment.\n\nHoward: Starbucks and Peetâs gets into financial trouble. The debt to equity was north of 6:1 for a company that was tiny. Jerry comes to me and says, Jane (his wife) and I are going to move to California. Weâre going to keep Peetâs and Iâm going to sell Starbucks. My heart is pounding. I said, okay. Then he finished it and he says, I think youâre the person to buy Starbucks. I said, thatâs fantastic, but I donât have any money.\n\nDavid: You going to give it to me?\n\nHoward: I have no money. How much is it? $3.8 million. Now weâre in 1986â1987. Now we get into a story I have told but not 100% because I protected the guy, but Iâm going to tell it. I go out to raise money. Iâm having a hard time.\n\nJerry gave me about (I think) 90 days to raise $3.8 million. Around the second month, he just came to me and said, where are you with all this? I think I had about half of it raised. I might have fibbed a bit and said I had a little bit more, but I had about half. He lays a bomb on me and says, Howard, listen. Weâre in a tight situation here, and one of your investors has put an all cash offer on the table with no due diligence, and wants to close right away.\n\nBen: For him to take it over, not you.\n\nHoward: Yeah, Iâm out. Iâd be out. I said, who is it? He told me, Iâll save that. Iâm absolutely annihilated, crushed because I didnât have the wherewithal, and I could just envision, as soon as I heard that name, I knew it was over.\n\nI was in a basketball league at the Seattle Club. Iâm playing basketball that night. My good friend Scott Greenberg, whoâs an attorney at a prestige firm in Seattle, the Gates firm, Iâm basically crying to him after the game and telling him the story. He says, youâve got to come to the office tomorrow and meet our senior partner and tell him the storyâBill Gates Senior.\n\nBen: A titan.\n\nDavid: Incredible.\n\nHoward: The other Titan.\n\nDavid: We foreshadowed this on the Microsoft episode.\n\nHoward: There were three titans there, but here is the titan.\n\nDavid: And Bill was 6â7â?\n\nHoward: Heâs 6â7â a mountain of a man and very imposing. So nine oâclock in the morning I put a suit on. I mustâve been sweating through my shirt. I was just so anxious, so nervous, and at the same time, so scared about what was going to happen. I go in there and I mustâve been trembling. I was just so nervous. I tell him exactly what I just told him.\n\nHe interrupts me and he says, Howard, Iâm just going to ask you two questions. Is everything you told me true? I said, Mr. Gates, yes. Have you left anything out? No. And he says, come back in an hour. I said, okay, to do what? He says, Iâll see you in an hour.\n\nWe walk out, and walking around I think we probably went to Columbia Center to get a coffee and come back. I go back with Scott and Mr. Gates says, Scott, Iâm going to see Howard alone. Scott leaves. Now Iâm alone in his office. I hardly sit down, and he says, weâre going for a walk. I said, where are we going? He says, weâre going to see the man, who was Sam Strum.\n\nBen: One of your investors.\n\nHoward: One of the investors. We walk across the street to the old Rainier Tower. I think Sam had one of the biggest offices. We walk in there, and I swear, even though itâs so many years later, I have a perfect vivid account for what took place.\n\nSam is sitting behind his desk and this is what happened, because it was five minutes. Bill Gatesâremember heâs a huge guyâleans over to the desk with his hands on Samâs desk and says, I donât know what you are planning, but whatever it is, itâs not going to happen. And he says, Howard Schultz is going to acquire the Starbucks coffee company and heâs never going to hear from you again. That was it. And we walk out. Thatâs it. Thatâs the whole thing.\n\nBen: Did you hear from Jerry that the bid had been dropped?\n\nHoward: We walk out, and I say to Mr. Gatesâ\n\nBen: Thereâs one little problem. You still need the money, right?\n\nHoward: Yes. I say to Mr. Gates, what just happened? He said, youâre going to buy Starbucks coffee company, and my son and I are going to help you. We raised the money and thatâs the story.\n\nI never spoke to Sam Strum again. Iâve never mentioned his name publicly. I never mentioned his name in this book. And I say it respectfully. Iâm not trying to, but thatâs the story.\n\nBen: And Samâfor anyone who doesnât live in the Seattle areaâhis name is on buildings and community centers. I mean, this revered philanthropist, I actually donât know his business background. How did he become the titan that he was?\n\nHoward: He was involved in real estate and also in those auto stores.\n\nBen: How did you get him off the Il Giornale cap table? Wasnât he an investor in your existing business?\n\nHoward: No, he was still an investor. He and his family were investors to the end until they got out.\n\nDavid: Looking back now, what do you think happened? Did he have any legitimate criticisms of you as running the company?\n\nHoward: No. He had a henchman who was his money guy who figured out we could just take this company, and what do we need Howard Schultz for? Heâs this young kid. Mm. He and Sam had experience with retail, with those auto stores.\n\nBen: I see. He could install some professional management from some other venture.\n\nDavid: Run the playbook.\n\nHoward: It wouldâve been over. But the thing about Bill Gates is I saw him socially 100+ times. He never ever said anything public about what he did. He never took credit for it.\n\nBen: For listeners, Howard told this elsewhere. You spoke at the Microsoft CEO summit. You recounted this story to the Fortune 500 CEOs, and Bill Gates III, Microsoft founder comes up to you afterwards and says yeah, who was the guy?\n\nHoward: But Bill did not know the whole story. He didnât know any of it. He didnât know what his father had done for me. Heâs hearing it for the first time.\n\nBen: This is 2015 or something. You would thinkâ\n\nHoward: No, he didnât know.\n\nBen: Someone would want to tell their family I played some significant role in this, but thatâs not the type of guy he was.\n\nHoward: Bill Gates Senior never told a soul what he did for me. Again, humility. Incredible lesson about humility.\n\nBen: Itâs amazing. Were Bill Gates Senior and Bill Gates III investors in that $3.8 million round?\n\nHoward: Bill Senior was, but I donât know if it was part of Bill orâ\n\nBen: Yeah, Microsoft. Interesting. I asked Sheri about this when I was preparing for the episode, and her recollection was, it was something like one to two weeks before the three-month exclusivity for you was going to be up. This event happens, but now you need to come up with the money, and you have this unbelievably short period of time to do so.\n\nShe said that you were calling everybody you knew. She was calling her clientsâbecause sheâs a designerâtrying to just find pockets of $50,000 here, $100,000 there, anywhere you could to make it happen.\n\nHoward: Yeah, but I had another angel who helped me by the name of Jack Rodgers, who became a lifelong friend who passed away a couple of years ago. He was part of an investor group and he brought them along.\n\nDavid: So the acquisition goes through.\n\nHoward: Yeah, August of 1987. We bought the six Starbucks stores, we had the three old Il Giornales, and there were two stores under construction. At the end of the calendar year, we had 11 stores and 100 employees in 1987.\n\nDavid: All in the Northwest. Meanwhile, the original Starbucks folks, theyâve now gone down to California.\n\nHoward: They went to California.\n\nDavid: When did Peetâs open coffee bars?\n\nHoward: Many, many years later.\n\nDavid: Ah, so you werenât competing right away.\n\nHoward: No.\n\nBen: But this is one of the great observations, David. Il Giornale buys the Starbucks stores, rebrands Il Giornale Incorporated as the Starbucks Corporation, and the original Starbucks had owned Peetâs and now needs a new name, so it rebrands the company, Peetâs. So Peetâs was actually Starbucks. Starbucks was actually Il Giornale. Itâs amazing.\n\nSome stats just for listeners to understand the gravity of this situation. For the initial $1.6 million that you raised for Il Giornale, you talked to 242 investors, 217 of which said no. Anybody whoâs griping about their fundraising journey, and those are rookie numbersâ\n\nHoward: But you asked me a question earlier about what did the years at Xerox teach me? The rejection I was going through, the Italians turned me down. People in the US turned me down. Nobody would believe in the idea. It was like I was cold calling again at Xerox.\n\nBen: The other thing that is worth pointing out is the Starbucks company with the six stores, when they bought Peetâs with that 6:1 debt to equity ratio, basically backed themselves into a corner, where now they had these big debt service payments to make. There was really no risk they could take or innovation that they could do because the whole business needed to spit out a certain amount of cash every month so they could pay down the debt.\n\nWhen youâre in that situation, Starbucks in the 40 years ahead from this point in the story, has tried all sorts of crazy things to become the business that it is today. When you first created this combined company, you were pretty religious about no debt.\n\nHoward: No debt. I want any debt again because of my childhood.\n\nBen: I was going to ask you, was that informed by what you had seen with the Starbucks situation or more your childhood?\n\nHoward: It was totally my childhood. My parents were always in debt. Bill collectors were always calling, and no, we never had any debt the entire time. Never.\n\nDavid: This is probably a good point in time to talk about the business model a little bit. Youâve alluded to a stigma at least among potential investors and the original Starbucks founders of the restaurant business. What did the economics of the business of the coffee bar business look like when you bought the Starbucks stores?\n\nHoward: What did we buy? We had the stores, we had the brand name, and we had a roasting facility on Airport Way in Seattle. The ability to source and roast coffee, and put that through the supply chain of a beverage gave us probably at the time an 80% gross margin.\n\nDavid: That is not the ârestaurant businessâ that people are imagining.\n\nHoward: And I could begin to see even early on the accretive nature of frequency, where I can see what was going on here is people were not coming for coffee in the morning anymore. The morning rush was getting bigger, the need for more labor, and I could sense that the business that Starbucks was in was going to be significantly in the back, and the beverage and the romance of the theater, and the third place was the hero. It didnât take us long to realize we had the beginning of lightning in the bottle.\n\nDavid: Even the best, most successful restaurant you could possibly imagine, how many times are their most loyal customers going to come there in a week?\n\nHoward: There was a time in the northwest when we were really at our peak where the average customer was coming 18 times a month. I should rephrase it, maybe the most loyal was coming 18 times a month.\n\nBen: Thereâs some magic to this idea that itâs not a terribly expensive item. I think I saw some research that said that itâs sub-1% of someoneâs household income and often far less than that. But it is repeat and it is high gross margin.\n\nWhen you say lightning in a bottle, thereâs a cultural lightning in a bottle, but thereâs also this ridiculous business model where the way it shows up is your stores basically from this point forward, for all of Starbucksâs life, you build a new store and the profits from that store would totally cover the costs within two years, and often a year-and-a-half.\n\nHoward: But Iâll tell you the economic model that we applied to every single store we were opening. By the way, I chose the first 500 locations myself. I was in it in so many ways. But the economic model and Wall Street, when we went public in 1992, when they heard the model, I said, well, weâve never seen a model like that. The model basically was a sales to investment ratio of 2:1 and an operating profit of 20%.\n\nBen: What does that mean, sales to investment ratio?\n\nHoward: If the sales were $1 million, the investment was $500,000. Just the sales to invest had to be a 2:1.\n\nDavid: And youâre one of operations?\n\nHoward: Yeah, and the operating profit was north of 20%.\n\nDavid: You get that two years at the last payback. The retail world had never seen a model invest before. There was no physical storefront that had this business model before this.\n\nHoward: Early on it became clear to us that customers were also starting to customize the beverage on their own. The barista was behind the counter and somebody would say, can you put something else in there? Yeah, what do you want? The average ticket started growing as a result of the customerâs personalizing and customizing their beverage.\n\nBen: And to be clear, the era of Starbucks we are in right now, you produce drip coffee and you produce espresso, and you can put that espresso in froth milk. Those are basically your options. None of thisâ¦\n\nHoward: Exactly. But can I tell you a mistake I made?\n\nDavid: Please.\n\nHoward: When Il Giornale was getting ready to open, the standard cup in the world was that terrible styrofoam cup that is used in diners in New York City. Remember that cup?\n\nBen: Yeah.\n\nHoward: I put boiling water into that cup. Five minutes later, the cup is starting to turn a golden color because of the chemical.\n\nBen: That canât be good for your insides.\n\nHoward: Or the taste of the coffee. We had to change the cup. This was such a smart move in retrospect, but we were just trying to figure out, now no one in America that is in the paper business had any cup or lid that was compatible with what I was trying to do. In fact, they didnât understand it. Why not just use the cup that exists? I said no, because it doesnât taste good and it doesnât feel right.\n\nBen: Why go to the trouble of this perfected roast of these beautifully sourced Arabica beans from all these farmers if youâre going to pour it into styrofoam?\n\nDavid: Do people think you were a hippie?\n\nHoward: They dismissed me. We went to Chicago, to the International Paper company. They had a cup, but the cup didnât have a lid, a compatible lid. They found a lid, that beautiful sip lid which is now ubiquitous in the world. Howard Schultz should have said to them, I want an exclusive on that lid, because that lid became the standard for the world. If I wouldâve just understood that.\n\nThe other thing I didnât do is we introduced cafÃ© latte to America. We didnât trademark it. We trademarked Frappuccino later on, but we didnât trademark cafÃ© latte. I wasnât thinking.\n\nBen: You got enough right. You donât need to get them all right.\n\nHoward: No, I missed it.\n\nDavid: When the sizingâgrande, venti.\n\nBen: The hidden trenta.\n\nDavid: Right. When did that start?\n\nHoward: There was a brilliant, brilliant guy who was the architect of the name Starbucks, named Terry Heckler in Seattle, and he was a fantastic design guy. Weâre just sitting one day and I was just talking about the importance of language. We got to get the language right. We got the cup, we got to get the language. We just started talking about changing it from the pedestrian words of small, medium, large to what it became, which was short, tall, and grande. People made fun of it, but they loved it.\n\nBen: Was venti not an original?\n\nHoward: We didnât have that size when we started. That was later on. Who wouldâve thought somebody wanted this?\n\nBen: This is America.\n\nDavid: Yeah, this is. My one more question on this. Writing the customerâs name on the cup.\n\nHoward: That didnât come from me. As the stores got busier and busier, the baristas were having a hard time with whose cup is it? What are we going to do? Someone at Starbucks, I donât know who it was, started writing names on the cup, and it just became standard. So much of Starbucksâ success came from customers asking for things we werenât doing, and Starbucks employees who became partners in 1991, understanding the business better than me.\n\nDavid: This is all to my mind, just starting to create this incredible flywheel of youâve got this 80% gross margin business, where the key lever is repeat loyal customer visits. Youâve got customization that is making customers more loyal, and increasing your margin at the same time because you can charge more for it. Youâve got the interpersonal relationship with the baristas, sure, but also the name on the cup, thatâs something that scales even as thousands and thousands of people come into the store.\n\nHoward: The intimacy with the customer and the barista became a very powerful component of the equity of the experience. And Iâve always thought in so many ways, Starbucks became the first experiential brand at scale. We didnât spend any money on marketing. Zero. There was no money for marketing. And the iconic cup became a badge of honor, because people were doing something that was new and novel and walking in the street with it, and people what is that? Itâs a lot of that kind of stuff.\n\nDavid: Itâs your free billboard that people are proud of.\n\nBen: Well, listeners, this entire episode so far, we have broadly been talking about the concept of customer experience with Howard. We want to talk about another business that has been innovating on the customer experience, and thatâs J.P. Morgan Payments. When it comes to digital commerce, J.P. Morgan Payments is all about personalization and convenience, both for consumers and businesses.\n\nDavid: On the consumer side, technology has completely changed expectations for shopping and commerce, whether itâs a sneaker drop or a coffee order. Customers expect functionality like ordering in an app but picking up in store, getting real time updates, and having our preferences and past orders synced and remembered.\n\nBen: And importantly, we expect our payments to be simple no matter where or how we want to pay. Which creates real challenges for the business on the other side of that to create the magic, even with super complex transactions like a marketplace website where you arenât just buying from one single retailer but a merchant on the other side of that platform.\n\nYou can imagine there are plenty of technical and regulatory complexities to make that frictionless across different countries and currencies. But with great embedded finance and innovative commerce solutions, you can delight customers without really taking that all on yourself.\n\nDavid: No matter how big or small your company is, you have to manage a complex technology ecosystem that now includes online payments, in-app payments, social payments, in-store payments, digital wallets, and much more in the future.\n\nBen: Oh yes, like biometric payments, which remarkably research shows that will reach 3 billion users and $5.8 trillion in value globally by 2026. That is insane.\n\nDavid: Yup. And just like Howard pioneered many firsts in his industry, J.P. Morgan is doing the same with biometric payments. Itâs essentially a pay-by-face solution that allows you to complete transactions seamlessly and securely, removing the need for carrying a wallet or digging into your bag to pull out your phone.\n\nBen: If any of you were at the Formula One race in Miami last month, you may have even seen J.P. Morganâs biometric payments powering the fast lane checkouts in the merch store. In last yearâs pilot, literally every single payment was processed in under one second.\n\nDavid: Crazy. And for businesses, speed of payments is obviously great to shorten lines. To quantify that, biometric payment solutions have shown to decrease checkout times by up to 35 seconds per transaction and increase purchase value by 4%, driving incremental revenue and maximizing profitability.\n\nBen: I can totally attest to this as a customer. I basically only used tap-to-pay with my watch or phone everywhere I go now, which just felt like sci-fi a few years ago. But unsurprisingly, that capability for merchants to accept contactless payments is now also being powered by J.P. Morgan Payments.\n\nDavid: Whether you want a full stack omnichannel service with biometric payments or streamlined online payments with the latest APIs, J.P. Morganâs Commerce Solutions work to drive your business forward with the foundation and security of a leading global bank, and the innovation of a FinTech.\n\nBen: The very best of both worlds. That is why we here at Acquired work with J.P. Morgan. You can check them out, jpmorgan.com/acquired to learn more and discover more payment solutions, powering growth for your business across every industry from startups to the Fortune 500.\n\nDavid: In this era, you must just be getting more and more excited every day.\n\nHoward: I was out of my mind.\n\nBen: David, Howard sent me a 1988âI canât believe this was filmedâshareholder and employee meeting, where itâs great. The whole thingâs like an hour-and-a-half. Itâs all there. You are using all the same language that you use today back in 1988. We focus on our people. Those people delight the customer. The customer delights or satisfies the shareholder. The conviction that you have is like watching a preacher.\n\nYouâre up there, youâve got I think 11 stores or something, and youâre like, you have no idea what we have here. We are on top of something that is going to changeâyou donât say the worldâAmerica, and this thing can become Americaâs coffee house.\n\nIt was interesting because I think the whole room was already scared of your ambition of going nationwide with this thing that there did not exist another example of a national coffee house chain. Everything was just these little cities, these small markets.\n\nThereâs this great quote that you have at the end of the meeting that says, âThe company since 1971, has been growing at a very, very slow pace. As a result of that, you combine Il Giornale and Starbucks together. Weâre going to take your 6 stores that youâve built in 17 years and weâre going to go to 26 in one year, and weâre going to go to over 100 in 5 years.â That must have just sounded bonkers, but that is literally what happened.\n\nHoward: Thatâs what happened.\n\nBen: The pace of growth approximately, you just doubled stores year over year over year. Was there some moment in 1988, 1989, 1990 where youâre just looking around realizing, we must expand as fast as we possibly can because this concept is the concept the world needs now. And if we donât pull out all the stops, someone else is going to do it.\n\nHoward: There were regional competitors who were making noise about doing what we were aspiring to do. I was very mindful because one of them was franchising, that was Gloria Jeans out of Chicago. At one point, I think they had more stores than we did because of the franchising opportunity. Thatâs one of the reasons why I went to Chicago as well in 1987â1988.\n\nBen: Because Chicago was the first market outside of Seattle and Vancouver. right? Even before LA.\n\nHoward: Yeah, and it didnât work right away. Howard Behar should be credited with so much of the cultural texture and the tapestry of the humanity of the company. Said, I will go to Chicago and fix it. He went to Chicago and stayed in Chicago through the winter, and recalibrated the mistakes we were making. Of course, he and Orin were so instrumental into the loneliness that exists as a entrepreneur and their ability to help me build the company that you know today.\n\nBen: I have in my script here; this is literally labeled the H2O era. For anyone who was a partner at Starbucks, knows what Iâm talking about. Anybody else outside has no idea. Thereâs two Howards. Thereâs Howard Schultz and Howard Behar. Howard Behar joined in 1989. Orin Smith joined in 1990.\n\nThe way that it looks to me from the outsideâand you can tell me if this is rightâyou were the vision and ambition that would almost take any ambition that anybody else had and force them to think bigger and faster. Howard Behar was in many ways the soul. He brought the idea of servant leadership. He brought the idea of nothing else matters if we arenât people first. Obviously, that became a huge tenet of Starbucks as we knew it through the 90s and 2000s, but that seems like it really arrived with him. And then Orin is like a numbers God.\n\nHoward: No. He was the adult in the room. More than the numbers. He had the style, he was quiet, he was a gentleman, he was the only MBA in the company, but he was the wise man who behind the doors could say to me and Howard, youâre both full of shit. Weâre not doing that. And we listened, more or less.\n\nBen: Is it true that the three of you had dinner every Monday night for a decade?\n\nHoward: More or less, that is true. Sometimes more than once if we had a crisis or two, which generally we did, or we had a disagreement. Thereâs a lot of creative conflict, especially between Howard and I. Because he had to operate what we were trying to do, and at times he thought we were growing too fast or ahead of the resources.\n\nBen: Because he was basically training all these operators, the management fleet of the company.\n\nHoward: He was building the operating system for us to be able to open the store, design the stores, which more or less I had done, build them, operate them, train them, and create the system to handle the flow of customers. His job was much harder than mine.\n\nDavid: Speaking of system, what did your technology look like at this point?\n\nBen: Donât embarrass him.\n\nHoward: No. There was no technology.\n\nDavid: Were you running like an Oracle system or?\n\nHoward: Not at that time. No.\n\nDavid: Weâre talking paper?\n\nHoward: Yeah, it was mostly manual.\n\nBen: Eventually, when they did get point of sale terminals, they were DOS-based all the way through 2008, right?\n\nHoward: Yes.\n\nBen: The iPhone was out and you guys had DOS-based point of sale systems.\n\nHoward: Sounds right.\n\nBen: But obviously technologyâ\n\nHoward: Technology was not the secret sauce.\n\nDavid: Iâm foreshadowing here of the future of the company.\n\nBen: Letâs take it forward from this 1988, 1989, 1990. The first market after Chicago, after you rided that ship, that you decide to enter on the West Coast is LA.\n\nHoward: Thatâs the big fight between Howard and I.\n\nBen: I donât think I realized it was a big fight.\n\nHoward: I just felt in my bones we had to go to LA. He said, weâre not ready for LA. Weâre going to San Diego. I said, San Diego? Whoâs in San Diego? No, weâre not going to San Diego, Weâre going to LA and Iâve got the location.\n\nBen: You wanted to play in the majors.\n\nHoward: Yeah. So we had a meeting about it and it erupted, erupted into a bad scene. One thing led to another. We did go to LA.\n\nBen: Iâm shocked.\n\nHoward: We did go to LA and it was fine. The equity of the brand, I could see, I could envision the warm weather, everyone walking around with our cups, the media, the celebrities, and just the iconic way. There was nothing in the market. Nothing at all that even appeared to be in the business that we were in. Anyone who was doing it was not doing it well. We had to go.\n\nEven though we maybe were not ready, we just had to do it. And we did. I think Howard would agree today that that ended up being the right decision. And LA, the halo on Starbucks from Seattle to Vancouver and Chicago was nothing. When we went to LA it just exploded because celebrities embraced Starbucks.\n\nBen: Was there an intentional strategy to create a luxury brand out of Starbucks? Like the cool people were carrying the Starbucks cup? It might be a little bit expensive, but you can afford it.\n\nHoward: No. I can never remember a discussion about segmentation of the brand because we wanted Starbucks to be accessible to all. Youâd have a CEO of a company and the person behind him was a blue collar truck driver because everyone could afford the affordable luxury of Starbucks at the time.\n\nBen: When you say affordable luxury, what about it was luxury?\n\nHoward: The quality of the coffee, the experience, and what it felt like to walk around with that cup at the time. It was a badge. It was like you were in the know. It wasnât a badge of luxury. It was just something new.\n\nBen: It became a trope for decades now that itâs, oh, itâs a $6 latte or an $8 latte. Where does that come from? In your mind, is Starbucks premium priced? Is there actually a Starbucks gets to charge a little bit more because the brand has more cache? Or is that just completely a farce or myth?\n\nHoward: I think the pricing of Starbucks was directly linked to the economic model that I alluded to earlier, and the rising costs of labor, rent, and the fiduciary responsibility that we all felt to achieving the promise we had to our shareholders. Now weâre talking about as a public company.\n\nThere certainly was a fair amount of discussion all the time about the sensitivity of the price points. In later years, maybe in the last couple of years, given the consumer inflationary time, I think itâs become a bit of a problem.\n\nCertainly, Iâve always said as Starbucks was growing, that the ubiquity of Starbucks was an enemy to the company. The challenge was we have to figure out a way to ensure the fact that we are getting smaller as weâre getting bigger, specifically how do we maintain intimacy and the currency of trust with our customers and our people.\n\nThat unto itself is the capsule of making sure that the growth doesnât become so intoxicating and so seductive that we lose sight of the really secret of the company, which was the internal culture and values, which built the brand and built a relationship with the customer.\n\nDavid: Can you tell us about the people? This is such a huge pillar to our minds of building Starbucks.\n\nHoward: Again, we started this conversation talking about childhood. I really want to build a different kind of company. How do I do that in a way that provides respect and dignity, because I was so imprinted with how my father felt disrespected, devalued, and vilified as an uneducated blue collar veteran working in a series of jobs that he just never made it, and living through the dysfunction of a poor family always under pressure with money.\n\nI wanted to crack the code on how do we create benefits that would in a way take the company in a direction no oneâs ever been in before. So early on, we started talking about exceeding the expectations of our people so they can exceed the expectations of the customer. The first time we actually were able to manifest, that was a year before the IPO.\n\nThat was an incredible struggle because I had on my board two venture capitalists. I was proposing something that had never been done before, and that was, I wanted to give equity in a form of stock options to every single employee in the company. They just said, what? What are you talking about? Weâre not doing that. So the fight became.\n\nUltimately, we gave 14% of everyoneâs base pay in the form of stock options at the end of the year based on the strike price. I had to do it the year before the IPO. Had to, so everyone wouldnât miss it. I think the turning point of the culture of the company was the day we announced that and we became partners.\n\nTo the credit of Craig Foley, who was the VC, and Jamie Shannon, they believed that performance would be enhanced, attrition would be lowered, and that the brand would just elevate as a result of that. And it was true. Completely true. That changed Starbucks for decades, along with some other events based on doing the right thing.\n\nBen: The healthcare for part-time workers.\n\nHoward: Healthcare, I think 25 years before the Affordable Care Act, what we did with Comprehensive Health Insurance. That also I grew up in a family with no health insurance, and I saw what happened. All of that is that is the origin story of mine, and the tragedy is my father passed away and never saw what we were able to do.\n\nBen: Do you want the stats on that initial employee stock grant?\n\nHoward: Iâd love to hear it.\n\nBen: The program was called Beans Stock, listeners that Howard was alluding to. Amazing name. In 1988, the health benefits roll out even to part-time employees, including gay couples in domestic partnerships, I believe the first of its kind, that was a 33-store company at that point.\n\nA few years later you had grown to 55 stores, you did the LA expansion. Then in 1991, which is the year before the IPO, Beans Stock happens, equity in the form of stock options goes out to everyone working 20 plus hours a week. There were 1300 employees at the time. I believe is the first time in history that part-time employees were offered a program like this.\n\nThose initial grants, the strike price was $6 per share. Today as we speak, the share price is $77, but there have been six splits since then, which comes out to a 64X. That initial grant has 800Xâd since even the part-time employees and baristas were offered the opportunity to buy Starbucks stock.\n\nHoward: A lawyer, I think Scott Greenberg at the time came to me and said, we canât do this unless we get approval from the SEC because we were over 500 shareholders.\n\nDavid: Weâve studied lots of amazing companies on this show who have lots and lots of different business models. But one thing that just kept striking us as we were preparing for Starbucks are the similarities to your neighbor here in the Northwest and Costco.\n\nHoward: Costco, right.\n\nDavid: And how you treat your people, specifically.\n\nHoward: Thatâs not by accident.\n\nBen: Both from a itâs-the-right-thing-to-do perspective and the amazing business model benefit of retaining employees. Itâs so expensive to train a new employee. Itâs not expensive to keep an existing employee, so you can just pay people more if you keep them for longer. You just basically have extra money lying around is what Costco discovered.\n\nThereâs so much about Starbucks to Davidâs point thatâs similar to Costco. Did you ever speak with Jeff Brotman or Jim Sinegal or any of those guys about this concept?\n\nHoward: Do you know the answer to that or is that I actuallyâ\n\nDavid: No, we donât.\n\nBen: I assume the answer to this, but I donât know it.\n\nHoward: First, Jeff Brotman invested in Starbucks in the round to buy Starbucks.\n\nDavid: No way.\n\nHoward: Yeah, in that 1987 round. Thatâs when I met Jeff for the first time. Jeff became a board member of the early imprinting of Starbucks and clearly a mentor of mine. Then he introduced me to Jim Sinegal.\n\nThere were many moments of me sitting with Jeff and Jim, including the huge decision to put Starbucks coffee in Costco, which there was a revolt inside the halls of Starbucks saying no effing way. And we did it.\n\nJeff and Jim took me to a parking lot in Kirkland when I said, I donât know if we can do this. I donât know if I can sell it inside. I donât know. Okay. Meet us on a Sunday morning, whatever it was. Look at the cars. These are your customers.\n\nIn fact, putting Starbucks in Costco, we were able to measure directly the increase in volume in the stores on the east side as a result of the proximity to the Costco store.\n\nBen: You sold beans in Costco.\n\nHoward: We sold beans, yes.\n\nBen: And that brand awareness of I buy Starbucks beans at home meant that that group of people went to the stores [...].\n\nHoward: Because we introduced thousands of beverage customers to Costco through the beans. Jeff and Jim were instrumental in so many things and were so kind to me as a young kid. And then we went nationwide with Costco.\n\nBen: This is a thing that I think many people donât realize now that Starbucks is ubiquitous. We forget about this time when it wasnât and where people had to find some way to experience Starbucks. You only get a few stores in each of these cities, youâre only in a few cities, but there are ways to scale brand awareness.\n\nYou can do things like become the official coffee of United Airlines or be in Costcos all over the US. You did this a number of times and I feel like the rest of the world did not catch on to what you were doing, was just finding little billboards everywhere where you could put the Starbucks logo and create that ubiquity.\n\nHoward: If you thought the Costco revolt was high, you can imagine when I said we have an opportunity for United Airlines. People thought that was absolutely blasphemy. Donât do that. Again, the exposure and the opportunity to surprise and delight customers in places that theyâd never had anything close to good coffee. All these things when you consider, we didnât spend a dollar, a dollar of marketing dollars ever.\n\nThe reputation of the company was built basically word of mouth, both inside our stores and exactly right in places that we could surprise the customer. Then we also started putting Starbucks coffee in grocery stores, which was the other thing. Because remember, we were building a beverage business, and we were then going back to our core business in new channels of distribution.\n\nBen: Itâs like the ultimate goal is to capture those margin dollars from selling cups of coffees in the stores that you operate. But thereâs all these other things that you can do that actually might spit off some profit dollars, but at the very least, itâs a break even way to do customer acquisition and brand building in the rest of the world.\n\nHoward: I donât know what our cost of customer acquisition was back then, but it was low.\n\nDavid: You werenât spending any money on marketing, so.\n\nBen: United Airlines was paying you for coffee, I assume. I donât know exactly how the thing went down. I have to assume the Barnes and Noble is basically the same thing.\n\nHoward: Barnes and Noble was a different deal. I met Len Riggio, the founder of Barnes and Noble. Very interesting guy, very smart guy, great merchant. We just started talking. He was from Brooklyn. I was from Brooklyn. We had a natural relationship. I said, what do you think about us opening Starbucks inside Barnes and Noble, given you are the ultimate third place is what we are. And it just, again, became a natural extension of our stores.\n\nDavid: We have a fun piece of trivia that you may know related to Costco. Do where Jeff Bezos and Jim Sinegal met for the first time?\n\nHoward: Sounds like in a Costco?\n\nDavid: Not in Costco, in the Starbucks, in the Barnes and Noble in Bellevue.\n\nHoward: Did not know that.\n\nDavid: That led to so many things, Amazon Prime among them.\n\nHoward: Did not know that. And I still am friendly with Jim Sinegal today.\n\nBen: Your companies rhyme in so many ways. Thatâs not surprising at all.\n\nI want to talk a little bit before we get to the IPO here about what the strategy was when you expanded market by market. Did you try to sprinkle a few stores in and see? Did you try to move into a market with force and be the dominant coffee house chain in that city? In particular, it could be worth talking about Boston.\n\nHoward: Bostonâs an anomaly because of the acquisition. Behar was so strident in not expanding to multiple markets at once. He was 100% right. We went to Chicago, Went to LA, and we stayed there for quite a while. Went to Portland. We werenât ready for New York City in terms of the issues there, but we were very diligent.\n\nBen: You went to DC first.\n\nHoward: Went to DC. We were not expanding to multiple markets until we had enough evidence in the existing market that we had success, and we werenât going to compound the growth in another market with problems that weâre having in the existing one. And I think thatâs all Behar, because was managing all the operations.\n\nBoston was very different. We had a very strong, high quality competitor called the Coffee Connection in Boston, with an owner-operator in George Howell, who was not unlike Alfred Peet, kind of a gospel of coffee culture on the East Coast. We knew Boston was going to be tough for Starbucks to enter. We also had Dunkin Donuts there.\n\nBen: A lot of the good real estate was taken by the Coffee Connection, right?\n\nHoward: Yeah. So George and I never saw eye-to-eye, but it was clear that if we came to Boston in a significant way, we were going to impact his business. I think to his credit, he was willing to sell. So Coffee Connection was the first acquisition. We had to tread very lightly after the acquisition because of the loyalty, be careful with the name, solicit Georgeâs help and advice. Also we needed him to validate for us what we were trying to do. Ultimately, it ended up being a very good strategy.\n\nBen: I think the numbers areâit was a little bit after IPO in 1994â$23 million. They had 23 locations and they were doing $16 million a year in revenue. If you just look at the purchaseâ\n\nHoward: I think it was a one-time sale.\n\nBen: Or maybe a little over a one-time sale. And the original Starbucks, ironically enough, was exactly a one-time sale, right? Thatâs what you bought it from the founders for. If they had the lock on all the best real estate and they had burned all the capital figuring out what stores we should be in, what stores we shouldnât be in, and then you just get to move into that market for one-time sales, 1.5 whatever it is, with all that already figured out, thatâs pretty amazing.\n\nHoward: It probably seemed high at the time, though.\n\nBen: Iâm sure it did. Well, isnât that the thing about valuations? It always seemed like in the good old days everything was undervalued.\n\nOkay. Letâs talk about the IPO. It seems like you knew the moment that you bought Starbucks from the founders, this going to be a public company.\n\nHoward: There was so much about being a public company that meant something to me personally, that it validated the company. It validated me, my own shame and security as a kid. I was a driving force all along. Certainly the year before with Beans Stock is an indication what I was planning. If Beans Stock was turned down, I wouldâve waited. That had to be done. I think we only had a couple of quarters of profitability and I think we had about 130 stores.\n\nBen: What was the revenue at the time?\n\nHoward: I donât remember exactly. I know what the market cap was the day it went public.\n\nBen: I think you ended up doing $93 million that year, but the year before was $50 million or something like that. Companies went public when they were smaller back then.\n\nDavid: You were a small cap IPO.\n\nHoward: Yeah, we were, and, we got turned down by Goldman Sachs, you know that?\n\nBen: I did not know that.\n\nHoward: I couldnât believe it. I wanted Goldman Sachs. They were the patina on the prospectus to have Goldman Sachs.\n\nBen: It would be a very Starbucks thing for Goldman Sachs to be the lead left.\n\nHoward: Well, Blankfein. I had a good friend who was a senior partner there who since passed away. I thought I had it locked. It was just so many things about it. New York, everything. And they said, no, youâre too small.\n\nBen: Well, the thing that Dan Levitan told us years ago when we did an episode on the Starbucks IPO was that you were really only considering smaller banks because it was going to be a smaller IPO.\n\nHoward: Well, I was considering it because Goldman Sachs [...]. I had no choice. Brotman at the time was not a big fan of [...] Schroeder, which was Dan Levitanâs thing, so Alex Frown became the lead. I had my own ego attached to this. I had so much fun on the road show. I was just in my element.\n\nBen: I was trying to figure out your public comps at the time. I think there were zero publicly-traded coffee companies. Not bean companies, not retailers, not coffee house chains, truly unheard of. So when youâre going on this road show, I think people of course are mystified. Thereâs literally no public companies like yours.\n\nDavid: You have a huge investor education problem, right?\n\nHoward: Yeah. I think we had to take them through everything. We had the product there. We served coffee. I gave them the whole show. We had a short video that was probably in black and white. The comp always was a restaurant, and I was always fighting, weâre not a restaurant. Weâre a hybrid retailer. I never referred to us as a cafÃ©. It was always a store. We are a store. We are merchants.\n\nBen: Fascinating. I go there and eat many, many meals sitting in your store.\n\nDavid: But as weâve been talking about, I mean the economics, you were a store.\n\nHoward: We were a store. We were a retail store.\n\nBen: Howard, Iâm going to take us through the IPO. Youâre the first publicly-traded coffee company. You do end up doing $93 million in revenue that year. Do you remember the exact price that you IPOâd at?\n\nHoward: Yes. We went out at $17 and the price was $21. The market cap (I think) was $250 million.\n\nBen: Can you imagine today a $250 million market cap company going public? And people considering that a success. This is greatâ¦\n\nHoward: At the time.\n\nBen: For your employees, how crazy is that? Whatâ12, 18 months before? I guess 12 months before, itâs $6 a share.\n\nHoward: We tripled their money.\n\nBen: Fantastic. And that was when you started calling them partners, right? When they becameâ\n\nHoward: 1991, as soon as Beans Stock was instituted, everyone was a partner.\n\nBen: Is that when titles all became lowercase also?\n\nHoward: No. Everyone was lowercase from the beginning, out of respect. Everyone was lower case.\n\nBen: Listeners, when you look up a Starbucks employee on LinkedIn, it always looks like, is that a typo? And then you realize thereâs a pattern. All employees always put lowercase titles.\n\nAnother interesting thing, I was reading The S one last night, the management team inclusive of you owned 18%, but only 9%â10% of that was you personally. The rest of the management team owned just as much as you did as the founder. That does feel unusually high. Do you think that that played a role in getting peopleâs buy-in and getting them to bleed Starbucks as much as you did?\n\nHoward: Not intentionally, no.\n\nBen: Okay. Not a strategy.\n\nHoward: No. That was not a strategy.\n\nBen: Interesting. From there, you open in Washington, DC on the East Coast. I think that the reason you picked DC was because your mail order business was strong there. You had proprietary data to know that that was going to be a good coffee city.\n\nHoward: I donât know how you found that out, but thatâs accurate.\n\nBen: In 1995, you crossed 500 stores. You had just bought the Coffee Connection, as we talked about in Boston. They had one asset that was perhaps much more valuable than any of the real estate or any of the sales that you would generate from there. They owned the trademark on the word âFrappuccino.â\n\nHoward: And Iâm so smart that I looked at that Frappuccino with disdain.\n\nBen: Really?\n\nHoward: I didnât like the name. I didnât like the beverage. I didnât think it was appropriate for Starbucks. I just saw Starbucks as such a purity with regard to coffee. I was wrong. Dead wrong, obviously.\n\nDavid: Putting myself in your shoes back then. Now Starbucks and Frappuccino are like a synonym. You canât disentangle them. But yeah, itâs very different than coffee.\n\nHoward: Completely different. A blended cold drink. That was the first cold drink weâve ever introduced. It was not a coffee forward beverage. When we introduced it in Southern California, it went crazy.\n\nDavid: What changed your mind to green light it?\n\nHoward: I didnât have a choice. Coffee Connection had it, then we had it in Boston, people wanted it. I just went along.\n\nBen: You ended up like reformulating it, right? It wasnât exactlyâ\n\nHoward: A store manager in Santa Monica reformatted it, and she was on it. I think Howard Behar loved it. People in California loved it. Thereâs a fantastic story about Frappuccino because of what we did with it. Not in its existing form of retail, but what we ended up doing with it in terms of leveraging the brand and distribution. Thatâs a another great story.\n\nDavid: Was that your first bottled drink in retail?\n\nHoward: Yeah. I went to Atlanta and Pepsi in the same day.\n\nBen: Atlanta being Coke.\n\nHoward: I went to Coke, I went to Pepsi in the same day. The Coke meeting was a meeting lasted less than 30 minutes. I canât remember who I met with. They dismissed me, didnât view Starbucks, didnât understand what I was trying to do, and didnât give me much time to even explain it. Then I went to Pepsi.\n\nBen: And this is 95-ish?\n\nHoward: Mid-90s.\n\nBen: Five hundred stores, youâre a public company.\n\nHoward: Yeah, but on East Coast, Starbucks wasnât really well-known. I went to Pepsi and purchased New York, met Roger Enrico, the iconic CEO, and Craig Weatherup, the president of Pepsi. They loved the idea, and we started talking about this.\n\nSubsequently, Craig Weatherup and I, on a napkin, I swear, shook hands and created a multi-billion dollar business for Pepsi and Starbucks and a 50/50 JV and bottled Frappuccino. Craig Weatherup deserves all the credit for that.\n\nCraig became a board member of Starbucks. Roger and I were friends until his death, and served on the Dreamworks board together.\n\nDavid: How did you find yourself at Coke and Pepsi pitching a bottled beverage?\n\nBen: And was there an internal revolt? Because I could imagine people saying this is a bridge too far.\n\nHoward: I donât think people knew what I was even doing. I think maybe a few people. I just had the thought we got to put this in a bottle. We have to put this in a bottle.\n\nBen: This product, if Iâm remembering right, was so successful the instant that it hit short store shelves. You had to pull it all off because you needed to create new manufacturing processes and spin up new factories in order to make enough to actually satisfy demand.\n\nHoward: Basically correct. We also early on had a recall where they found glass in the bottle. Pepsi, to its credit, took all the blame for that and fixed it. But yeah, from minute one, the power of Starbucks and bottled Frappuccino and doing something we had neverâthere was no bottle of coffee, let alone. Again, just like the Costco story and the United Airline story, the flywheel of the awareness and people drinking something they could enjoy at home or at work, again, it just created another level of velocity on the brand.\n\nBen: Iâm just thinking about between the cups, but then United Airlines and Costco and the CPG products, thereâs got to have been 50 billion Starbucks logos printed.\n\nHoward: Iâm sure that was maybe more.\n\nBen: Iâm sure I could estimate it better at another time.\n\nHoward: But you can see where the size of the equity of the brand was much bigger than the size of the company. Much bigger.\n\nBen: Because at this point you were then 800 stores?\n\nHoward: Yeah, then something else happened. We wake up one day and someone says Starbucks is in a movie. We said, what movie? Youâve Got Mail.\n\nBen: That wasnât coordinated?\n\nHoward: First of all, Starbucks never paid for placement. Someone must have approved it. I knew nothing about it. And then someone said, you got to see this movie. Starbucks is all over it. I said, what movie? Tom Hanks, Youâve Got Mail with Meg Ryan. I knew nothing about it. It was just another thing where it was just like a little fairy dust on the brand.\n\nDavid: Did you know that it was like the good old days where youâre like, this is just likeâ¦\n\nHoward: We were so in the mud. We were so in it that we didnât have time to look up. We were just running so fast, so hard. When youâre growing at this pace, itâs almost virtually impossible to catch the growth in terms of the infrastructure.\n\nYouâre constantly back and forth trying to create that fragile balance between the seductive nature and the intoxication of growth and success, and the foundation necessary to support it, and not falling too far behind where you lose it. But you never are in a position. At least we were never in a position. We were ahead of it. Never.\n\nThere was a constant push, and I think this is where Orin was the wise man in the room to say, Howard, we just canât do that now. We donât have the infrastructure, we donât have the people, we donât have the systems. Iâd be screaming, we got to do it. If we donât do it, someone else is. We got to do it. That takes us to international. We werenât ready for that.\n\nBen: I want to putting a bow on Frappuccino. The year after it launched in 1996, Frappuccinos were 7% of revenue, which I can attest to maybe freshman year of high school. I had my first tall Mocha Frappuccino with whipped cream and a little chocolate drizzle on top. And now here I am drinking, what are we drinking here?\n\nHoward: Youâre drinking coffee from India.\n\nBen: No cream, no sugar. The Frappuccino began my journey to the good stuff. So thatâs the Frappuccino story, 1996, 1997, 1998. This is the international story. I love the Japan story. Youâve told this to me before, but Iâd love to hear.\n\nHoward: Okay. Thereâs a couple of things about this. I started taking a couple of trips to Europe and Asia just to get a sense of what the opportunity would be and how would we do it. I quickly wrote off Europe because coffee was there. I didnât think we could possibly enter as an American company.\n\nDavid: This would be like an American luxury leather goods company coming in and competing with Hermes.\n\nHoward: Yeah, not going to happen. So we just took it off the map. Then we narrowed our focus very quickly on Japan. Japan had a couple of thousand coffee stores named Doutor. You walk in there and it was smoke-filled, mostly men, dark, but they were successful. I said to the board, we want to go to Japan.\n\nThe board was incredibly resistant to the idea. Why? Youâve got all this white space in America. Thereâs no need to do this at the time. I just said, okay. One thing led to another and my board member said, if youâre considering this, hire an outside resource to do a study. I was a livid about that.\n\nBen: Arenât there some consultants you could possibly pay to help?\n\nHoward: Yeah. We hired a consultant who came back with a big book, presented it to the board. I had a preview, and it basically was, this is a non-starter. You canât possibly succeed there. In the meeting, I could feel my blood just boiling because with every statement it was getting worse.\n\nThe economics wonât work. No one in Japan will ever walk in the street with a cup of coffee. They would lose face. Your no smoking policy, which we had from the beginning, is a non-starter. You canât afford the economics, the rent. Donât go. Well, that only made me more furious.\n\nBen: Itâs like theyâve never met you.\n\nHoward: And more intentional. So we kept thinking about this. Then one day we get a handwritten letter from a Japanese company. The founder of the company, Yuj-san, had an LA restaurant, and he was enamored with Starbucks. We sit down with him, we fall in love with him. We werenât ready, but we decided weâre going to give it a shot.\n\nWe go to Tokyo, we meet him, we ended up forming a JV. The folklore at Starbucks, which is not that unrealistic, is the reason we went to Japan as an international market is because it had a direct flight to Seattle. That was the extent of our understanding.\n\nNow we open up in August. If youâve been to Tokyo in August, itâs hot. Itâs like 95 degree temperature and 100% humidity. Itâs like getting out of a New York City subway in the middle of August. As soon as you walk out, you need a shower. Itâs going to be a tough opening because of the hot weather. Iâm very concerned about it.\n\nI get back to my hotel room and I have a message that CNN is covering the opening live. They got cameras.\n\nBen: High risk, high reward.\n\nHoward: Iâm so nervous. At 6:00 AM we get in the car, itâs so hot. The tie around my neck feels like a noose. Weâre driving up to the store in the Ginza and thereâs like 200 people on line. I turned to the translator and I said, did he hire extras? I cut the ribbon, and a young man who slept over the night before to be the first person, a college student, speaks no English, rushes to the front of the line. I follow him, no English, and he says, double tall latte.\n\nAs God is my witness, just like that. And I said, holy shit. How did they know? And Japan was an extraordinary success from minute one. We got 2000 stores there. I was there a lot two months ago. Incredible. We have a roastery there.\n\nBen: Why were there people lined up around the block? Why did it work so well instantly? Was it a strong coffee culture orâ¦?\n\nHoward: No, it was the iconic reputation and anticipation of something that they had convinced themselves was unique, proprietary, not in Tokyo, not in Japan, that they wanted to have. By the way, the research, that cup was all over Tokyo in months. Everyone was walking around with that cup.\n\nBen: This is nine years after you bought the six stores. It has turned into this icon. In all the events we just covered, Starbucks has already become Starbucks. It is already this globally desirable brand, thereby 1996.\n\nHoward: I honestly havenât thought about it in that way, butâ¦\n\nBen: Thatâs so fast to build something thatâ\n\nHoward: It did seem fast to us.\n\nBen: I bet.\n\nDavid: The parallels to the Microsoft story are just so apt. Japan was Microsoftâs first international market.\n\nHoward: Did not know that.\n\nDavid: It was half their business, and it started in the same way. Bill and Paul got a cold call from Kay Nishi, who was guy in Japan, who had somehow gotten a hold of the BASIC interpreter, loved it, and said, Iâm so passionate about this, I want to bring it to Japan. Fifty percent of Microsoftâs revenue for the first, at least five years.\n\nBen: They stayed 50% international permanently after that.\n\nDavid: And thatâs what took them from this Albuquerque to like, hey, weâre international.\n\nAll right, listeners, this is a great time to talk about one of our big partners here in season 14, ServiceNow.\n\nBen: Yes. As you know, ServiceNow is the AI platform for the enterprise, helping to automate processes, improve service delivery, and increase efficiency. Over 85% of the Fortune 500 runs on them, and they have quickly become one of the worldâs most important enterprise technology vendors.\n\nDavid: Today, we want to do a little case study on how ServiceNow works with another very well-known consumer brand, NASCAR. Little known fact: NASCAR is a family-owned business. Even at todayâs scale, in their 75th year, theyâre continuing to innovate with events like their race through the streets of Chicago and growing with over 1000 NASCAR-sanctioned events per year.\n\nBen: The operations are mind-bending. I was looking into it. They move a huge part of the company and set up a new base of operations in a new city every week. The whole thing is like a roving circus that needs to build a festival from scratch while keeping consistent infrastructure to ensure that fans and teams have a seamless experience from race to race.\n\nDavid: So how do you do that? Well, NASCAR has turned to ServiceNow to help it become one of the most innovative and technologically-advanced organizations in the sports entertainment industry. With ServiceNow, theyâve been able to automate manual and outdated business processes, and unify fragmented technology into a single platform.\n\nTheyâve also been able to enable their employees to build low-code applications that can be speedily deployed to all employees without having big IT projects associated with it.\n\nBen: The NASCAR story is a classic one for ServiceNow. They first became a customer for the IT operations, but as they saw the power of the ServiceNow platform, they extended it into every corner of their business from employee experience to app engine.\n\nDavid: So if you want to learn more about the ServiceNow platform and how it can turbocharge your business transformation and the time to deploy applications including AI for your business, go over to servicenow.com/acquired. When you get in touch, just tell them, Ben and David sent you.\n\nBen: So Japanâs 1996 in 1997, you cross 1000 stores globally. Youâre getting your feet under you. Youâre saying, okay, international is going to be a thing. In 1999, youâ\n\nHoward: Two thousand stores. Because we had a goal of 2000 by 2000. We beat it by year.\n\nBen: Ah, 1999 you also opened in Beijing. Whatâs the calculus on entering China, and did you realize it could become such a pillar of the company like it is today?\n\nHoward: I honestly donât think we had any real understanding of what weâre getting into. We went there with a partner that didnât work out. I should tell you that we had a theory of the case that any international market that we opened that didnât speak English, we needed a partner. Japan was a partner, successful. We entered in a partnership in China early on that was not successful, did not share our values. We got out and ended up going.\n\nBen: You closed all the stores?\n\nHoward: No. We got out of the partnership, bought them out and became company owned.\n\nBen: That was legal to do that, to be an American-owned company operating in China.\n\nHoward: But we struggled in China for almost a decade. Lost money. There was tremendous pressure inside the company to closed China. Until Belinda Wong, maybe the most valuable person in the company from my view.\n\nBen: Really?\n\nHoward: Yeah.\n\nBen: When did Belinda get involved with the company?\n\nHoward: Belinda started with Starbucks in Singapore, but she was working in Hong Kong. We were open in Hong Kong. I saw something in her, it was just extraordinary operator and had a touch with people. I said, we were dying in China. Weâre really in trouble. Would you come to China and run it? She said, I would consider doing that, but youâve got to decentralize it. We couldnât do that right away. It was just too much. But she changed the course of history for Starbucks in China.\n\nBen: What year was that that she took over the role?\n\nHoward: I think itâs about a decade after we opened. But sheâs still there today.\n\nBen: I asked because I want to come back to it. Thereâs a whole interim between 2000 and 2008 where you are not the CEO of the company. If youâve been listening to this episode, the theme that should be occurring to you is, oh my God. Basically everything worked. I know it didnât feel like that on the inside.\n\nYou read all those investment banking reports and itâs like, hereâs all these price targets for Starbucks and hereâs what we think theyâre going to do in earnings. And oh, they beat it again. And like, I dunno, 30â40 quarters in a row. Itâs just like this. I would say perfectly predictable, except you actually kept exceeding the expectation, so it wasnât predictable.\n\nHoward: I did 100 quarterly conference calls as CEO. A hundred. Thatâs a lot.\n\nBen: I bet. Thatâs a lot of earnings prep because each one of those has two weeks before it.\n\nHoward: The truth is the majority of those were no script, which became the lead. The lawyers took over after that many years, but no script.\n\nBen: Which is your preferred communication style. It seems like whenever I see you up speaking, thereâs no teleprompters. Itâs from the heart.\n\nAt this point, I donât want to say it, it would be incorrect to say Starbucks is running itself, but itâs in a great place, and you step into the role of, is it Executive Chairman?\n\nHoward: Yes, Executive Chairman with Orin as the CEO.\n\nBen: In 2000.\n\nHoward: Yeah.\n\nBen: What was yourâ\n\nHoward: I think I was physically and emotionally exhausted. Kids were getting older. I had missed a lot. Just think about all the things weâre doing. I had so much confidence in Orin, so it was no problem. Thatâs what I did. I was still engaged, but I was not running it day to day.\n\nBen: At this point, itâs 3500 stores, the companyâs doing $2.2 billion in revenue. It feels like, okay, I can get some distance. I can do other things in life. Itâs going to work out. At some point, Orin transitions the CEO role to Jim Donald, which I assume youâre also very involved in working with him. What was that transition about?\n\nHoward: Orin never wanted to be the CEO. Heâs not a front guy. In fact, heâs shy and never wanted to be on the stage as a CEO. So he said, Iâll do it for a couple of years. But heâs always knocking on my door saying, we need a new CEO. We didnât have anyone internally. Behar didnât want it. So we did a search.\n\nWe met Jim Donald, great, great guy. Had all this operational experience. Then certain things started appearing that we would just werenât hitting our stride the way we usually do. The economic environment was getting tougher. Things just unveiled itself that it wasnât going to work out. By the way, Jim is a great guy, a really good person, but it just wasnât the right fit.\n\nBen: How long had he been in that role of CEO?\n\nHoward: Iâd say less than three years. Two years maybe.\n\nBen: But basically the 2008 happens.\n\nHoward: The cataclysmic financial crisis is unfolding, and that plus the cracks that we were experiencing. I donât think the board meeting was set up for me to return, but it just happened in the meeting about, okay, we got all these problems. What are we going to do? Do you want to come back? Yeah, Iâm going to come back.\n\nBen: That was never your intent. When you stepped away, you thought you were staying away.\n\nHoward: It was not my intent to come back. It was certainly not my intent that weâre going to run into problems. In the Christmas vacation of 2007, I knew I was going to return in January. I was on holiday and I was starting to think through what I was going to do.\n\nOn that holiday, a friend of mine, I didnât know he was there but it was Michael Dell was there, and I must have talked to him almost every day about the transformation of Starbucks. He was going through a similar thing at Dell, almost at the same time. We had so many things to talk about. We were comparing notes and everything. So in early 2008, I spoke to Jim and I came back in 2008.\n\nBen: When you came back in 2008, this is the whole crux of your book, Onward. Thereâs an entire bookâs worth of material here, so weâre not going to do it all. But suffice to say, just to put some numbers on it, the market cap had dropped from $30 billion to less than $7 billion. Same store stales. The comparables number, when you compare the store this quarter last year to this quarter, or this year to last year had dropped, growth began to slow. You come in and you have to make these really horrible decisions. Youâre faced with two terrible options, and you got to make the right decisions for the business.\n\nHoward: First off, every rock I turned over was worse than I thought. There were a lot of unperforming stores that should have never been opened that we need to close. I think we closed a thousand stores. I had a company-wide meeting. I remember it vividly because I started crying and apologized to everybody that we got to close doors, we got to lay people off.\n\nWe were on our trajectory for all this time, and all of a sudden we not only hit a speed bump, but the world, the music was just stopping. The stock price (I think) broke $6. I was so afraid that we were going to get acquired, but the only cover we had is that the world was coming undone so no one had any resources. I was terrified. I just stood up, apologized, and said weâve let you down. I promise Iâm doing my best, but weâre trying to save the company. Literally we were trying to save Starbucks. Things were that bad.\n\nBen: You say that we were trying to save Starbucks. In my head, I always thought, well, it couldnât have been that bad. This is a big, successful company, itâs fast growing, itâs profitable, and then I read you were seven months from being insolvent.\n\nHoward: We didnât have enough cash. We never had negative comps in the history of Starbucks.\n\nBen: Every single quarter was better than [...]\n\nHoward: Never had a negative comp month in my history of the company. I didnât understand that. Such an anomaly. We close all those stores and then you got to decide, okay, how do we turn it? What do we do?\n\nGoing back to your line of questions in the past about the people, is of all the things that I could point to that demonstrates what Starbucks is, has been, and needs to be, itâs the humanity and the people of the company. The company was built on being a performance-driven company through the lens of humanity. Thatâs how it was built. Whenever weâve lost our way, weâve lost our way because people in power didnât understand that equation. I just said, I need to be in front of every store manager. I need a meeting with 10,000 people.\n\nBen: Itâs a big conference room.\n\nHoward: So in 2008, no American company was traveling. The municipalities were hungry for Starbucks to potentially have a meeting at a discount. We had Detroit come in, we had Houston come in, and then New Orleans came in. What they presented to us was the need for Starbucks to come as a result of Katrina.\n\nWhen we heard that, we realized weâve got to go to New Orleans. In fact, what weâre going to do in New Orleans is weâre going to have one full day of 50,000 hours of community service in the ninth ward.\n\nNext day, we walk through and we built basically a tutorial on how to restore the business and have people walk through it. We had classes and we had all these things going on.\n\nOn the third day was my speech in the basketball coliseum to 10,000 people. About an hour before, I was really feeling the burden of how important what I was going to say is. The CFO at the time who subsequently resigned a week laterâwasnât my guyâasked me what Iâm going to say. I said, Iâm going to tell them the truth. He says, you canât possibly do that. Youâre going to scare the out of them. I went up there, and I laid it out chapter and verse. I think we have seven months left. We are going to be insolvent.\n\nDavid: I can see why he was freaked out about this. If word got out to Wall Street that youâ\n\nHoward: Social media didnât exist at that time, but I just laid it out. What if that store was the difference between the food on your table and its success? Then I had this economic formula of how many customers it would take per store to turn comps around, and the number was low. Itâs less than 10 per day, or 11 per day. I said, letâs just talk about New Orleans. How many new incremental customers itâll take in your store? It was manageable and tangible.\n\nBen: Because you could actually imagine, okay, if 10 more people walk in the door today, and I delight them in a particular way that brings them back tomorrow, weâre turning this thing around. Weâre turning this one store around, and if everybody does that.\n\nHoward: The problem when you get this big is you start thinking about large numbers. But if you reduce it to the locus, lowest common denominator, one store, one cup of coffee, one customer, one partner, and what if all of that works? Well, we rushed out of New Orleans like an effing tidal wave, and we never looked back. And less than a year was turned.\n\nBen: You did crazy. I mean, the tactics involved in the turnaround.\n\nHoward: We closed the stores.\n\nBen: For what, noon onward, right? For an entire afternoon and evening.\n\nHoward: Because the previous administration had done things that diluted the integrity of coffee to maximize yield.\n\nBen: What does that mean?\n\nHoward: Letâs say youâre making a batch of brewed coffee. Well, what if that brewed coffee was based on a number of ounces of coffee? What if you just reduced it just a little bit? No oneâs going to know. Just little things.\n\nBen: Ten thousand little scratches of efficiency that dilute the experience.\n\nDavid: But that does reflect a misunderstanding of the fundamental business. that this is a business about a store with high gross margins based on customer loyalty.\n\nHoward: But we were beginning to face headwinds.\n\nBen: What are the headwinds?\n\nHoward: Headwinds were the level of attrition of customers.\n\nDavid: As the financial climate deteriorated, spending that $6 on the latte daily habit gets harder to justify.\n\nHoward: And we werenât as good as we were when we were small.\n\nDavid: Then it makes it easier to give up.\n\nHoward: This goes back to what I said earlier, growth covers up mistakes and success breeds hubris. And it did.\n\nBen: How could it not? Starbucks today is so fricking ubiquitous, which again, is one of the things I love about it. Itâs consistent. Anywhere I travel in the world, I can count on it. I can mobile order and pay. Thereâs all these wonderful things. But when you beco"
