Jesse Jackson, George Wendt, and George Foreman, according to The Business Journal.\n\nEvidently business has been booming ever since, with a presence scaling from the Seattle area to Spokane, WA, and parts of Oregon, the outlet mentions. What’s more, the family-owned business is opening a 2,500-square-foot location at 12559 116th Ave. NE, which will be the 18th Ezell’s Famous Chicken.\n\nA grand opening is scheduled for Tuesday, Aug. 6, 2024, the company shared via Instagram.\n\n“Attention Ezell’s fans, far and wide,” the company said on Instagram. “Our brand new Ezell’s Famous Chicken in Kirkland will officially open its doors this Tuesday, August 6th at 10:30am! Grab your squad, bring your appetite, and get ready to celebrate with us.”\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Ezell's Famous Chicken (@ezells_chicken)\n\nWhile Ezell’s Famous Chicken continues to build on its success, it is also actively working on doing the same for other Black-owned businesses. According to Eater Seattle, the company launched the Raising Up Black Businesses (R.U.B.B.) Initiative, which provides financial management guidance and coaching as well as grant funding to entrepreneur’s across Seattle and Portland. Already over $75,000 in grants has been dispersed since 2021.\n\nSamantha Dorisca\n\nSamantha Dorisca is a Houston-based journalist and photographer whose mission is to impact communities through the gift of storytelling using the written word or visual media.
