EDITORS NOTE:

Animator/educator/historian Howard Beckerman passed away (perhaps symbolically, this past Saturday Morning). I met Howard back in my SVA and Asifa-East days in the early 1970s. He was always open and free to speak – recounting his personal experiences at the studios (50s Famous, UPA, 60s Paramount, etc.). His stories gave me insight and perspective on animation history I wouldn’t have gotten anywhere else.

Howard has only passed on – his memory will live forever; his films will continue to entertain; his influence on a younger generation will inspire for decades to come. Howard was beloved by the community.

There was such an outpouring of love by everyone who knew him, or took his classes, or read his articles, on Facebook and other social media, I wasn’t sure what to post today in tribute. Don Yowp posted this nice tribute on his Tralfaz blog.
