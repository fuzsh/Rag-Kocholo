In Tegelort, apart from the Havel and the Tegeler Forst, which covers more than two thousand hectares, the second largest body of water in Berlin is particularly fascinating: Lake Tegel. Its unique feature is the large and small islands that additionally enrich the surroundings with their individual usage concepts and create a maritime atmosphere. The new construction project is being built in precisely this longing location, the picturesque lakeside promenade of Tegelort. 17 condominiums, with an underground garage and a direct waterfront location, combine the advantages of contemporary, sophisticated and natural living.

In the south, the Tegeler See spreads out with its islands and wooded shores. In the west, the Havel, which is very wide and partly extended like a lake, forms the border of this district. In the east and north, the large Tegel Forest extends to Hermsdorf and Frohnau. The rural colony, characterized by restaurants, single-family houses and boat docks, is one of the most beautiful excursion destinations in Berlin and is a popular place to live.

The property at Scharfenberger Str. 26e is on the tongue of land between the Havel and Tegeler See. It has direct access to the shores of Lake Tegel and to the jetty planned for the residents. The three planned multi-family houses each consist of a basement, two full floors and a stacked floor. The spacious three- to five-room apartments have balconies and terraces on the water side. The penthouse apartments with 5 rooms planned on the penthouse floor have their own roof terrace and sauna. All apartments inspire with a water view of the Tegeler See, open kitchen-living rooms and light-flooded rooms.
