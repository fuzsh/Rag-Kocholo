Living by the water is reinterpreted here. Anyone who wants to combine proximity to the city of Berlin, comfortable luxury and living by the water will find the center of their life here. The future residents are welcomed by three architecturally modern and elegantly designed city villas with plenty of space for individual wishes. With three floors each and a direct connection to the underground car park, barrier-free access is guaranteed. A sculptural stairwell with a concrete staircase, matching the concrete-look walls, forms the reception, while deliberately selected light accents create a cozy atmosphere as soon as you enter the house. The glamorous, clean design with a linear façade also extends inside in all facets of the design. Design and surroundings merge into one formation here.\n\nAll units have a view of the water and enjoy additional development in the park-like community garden with direct access to the lake. Floor plan variants with three or four rooms, distributed over an area of ​​approx. 109-243 m², allow for a residential comfort in a class of its own. On request, floor plans can also be adapted to your individual needs.\n\nThe combined underfloor heating, which ensures pleasant cooling in summer, offers particular comfort. A significant priority in this project is the selection of materials and outfitting features, which is based on the highest standards and reflects the characteristics of the clear architecture of the house body. Depending on your design preference, you can choose between wooden floorboards or sanded exposed screed for laying the floor. If the clean look is favoured, the ceilings can also remain in exposed concrete. Apartment doors that are flush with the wall and a ceiling height of almost 3m make transitions appear fluid and convey a loft character. Filigree aluminum windows installed room-high underline the upscale residential ambience. Those who live here have a direct view of the idyllic Tegeler See from the large window fronts, which seems close enough to touch. Particular attention is paid to the bathrooms, which are to be understood as a wellness oasis and shine with a very upscale facility. Each master bathroom welcomes its residents with large-format tiles in tasteful color coordination. Individually manufactured washbasins in combination with design fittings in a matt gold finish, made-to-measure mirror cabinets, free-standing bathtubs, floor-level showers with floor-to-ceiling, tinted shower walls make a statement for luxurious life.\n\nAn extension of the dream home can be found in the spacious terraces, which have become everyone's favorite place. Each domicile has at least one large south-facing terrace and some also have private garden areas - all with a view of the lake. Enough space for versatile use with individual design options."
