        "text": "3,000 lakes and far more than 30.000 kilometres of watercourses: as the most water-rich region in Germany, Berlin and the surrounding area of Brandenburg have bathing spots like sand by the sea - from Wannsee to Müggelsee. And that's especially great in summer for a dip in the water! Whether it's a traditional lido, an idyllic bay in the middle of the forest, an artificial quarry pond or a bathing beach on the Spree, Havel or Dahme - when the temperatures rise, the often crystal-clear water is a great place to cool off.\n\nSo that you know where you can take a dip in and around Berlin, we have created our Bathing map with an overview of the swimming spots that can be reached by public transport. Pack your swimming trunks...\n\nTip 1: Dämeritzsee – the lake in two states\n\nEvery year, the beach at the Dämeritzsee has its first full weekend on Easter, although swimming's usually not on the agenda just yet. As the temperatures rise, the lawn slowly gets greener, the water warmer, and the beach even more popular with Berliners. After all, it only takes 30 minutes to get from Alexanderplatz to Dämeritzsee with the S-Bahn. For an even more active workout, you can also cycle Euro-Route R1 straight to the lake and take a dip to cool off before heading back into the city. Incidentally, if you pass through the middle of the lake you swim in Brandenburg waters.\n\nWhere: S3 to Erkner (Oder-Spree)\n\nTip 2: Liepnitzsee – the turquoise lake in Berlins surroundings\n\nFor most, it is love at first sight when they stand with their bicycle at the edge of the forest and catch a glimpse of the turquoise waters of the Liepnitzsee between the beech trees. And as you take the last train back to Berlin's Gesundbrunnen station, it feels like you've come back from a day's vacation in some other world.\n\nWhere: RB27 to Wandlitzsee (Bernau) + short walk through the woods\n\nTip 3: Wannsee – the classic and most popular lake in Berlin\n\nThe Strandbad Wannsee is a classic. With its chic 1920s architecture and white sand, it is one of Berlin's most popular destinations for swimmers, splashers and sun worshippers. The queues are correspondingly long on sunny days, so I arrive early in the morning to get a shady place and enjoy a long day on and in the water. The bathing areas on the opposite side of Lake Wannsee on the promenade are also beautiful.\n\nPlease note that you currently have to book tickets online in advance.\n\nWhere: S1/S7 to Nikolassee\n\nTip 4: Tegeler See and Flakensee Berlin – like being on the Mediterranean\n\nAs the second largest lake in Berlin, the Tegeler See attracts with beaches, sailboats and a real promenade. If it's too crowded for you here and you're not afraid to drive a little further, we recommend the Mediterranean feeling at Flakensee. If you walk along the promenade from the Woltersdorfer lock, the scent of the surrounding pine forest makes you think of the Mediterranean. At its deepest, the Flakensee is a good 8 m (27 ft) deep and is therefore very popular with water sports enthusiasts.\n\nWhere: Flakensee S3 to Rahnsdorf, then Tram 87 to Schleuse Woltersdorf, Tegeler See S25 to Tegel + Bus 133 to Wassersportclub\n\nTip 5: Flughafensee – the lake around the corner\n\nFancy a quick swim after a day in the office or touring the city's museums? Then a good choice is the Flughafensee. The sandy path to the two larger beaches and several coves takes you through a small wooded grove. Usually it's just a couple of kids messing around on the bridge behind the inlet lake, using it as a base for diving into the water. Otherwise, the lake's a hive of activity, but the water is clear and sometimes even a pretzel vendor will make his way along the beach.\n\nWhere: U6 to Otisstraße (Reinickendorf), then walk along Laubenkolonie towards the lake\n\nTip 6: Groß Glienicker See Süd - the clear one\n\nThe wonderfully clear Groß Glienicker See in Spandau has several DRLG bathing sites. The one at Groß Glienicker See Süd (Moorloch) has a lawn under trees where you can spend the day comfortably with a picnic. The best way to combine the excursion with a bicycle tour.\n\nWhere: Bus: 135 - Waldallee; Bus 234 - Krampnitzer Weg/ Selbitzer Str.\n\nTip 7: Müggelsee – the biggest lake in Berlin\n\nThe Wannsee of East Berlin - that is Lake Müggelsee, which is also Berlin's largest lake. Here you can feel sand between your toes, play beach volleyball and eat delicious fries. The lido is also great for families with children, as there is a playground and a huge shallow water zone - which is of course also great for water games. Lake Müggelsee is also popular with surfers and sailors.\n\nWhere: S3 to Friedrichshagen, then Tram 61 to Strandbad Müggelsee\n\nTip 8: Schermützelsee – a swimming lake bursting with nostalgia\n\nThe Schermützelsee in Buckow has been appreciated for its clean air since the 19th century and before. This pretty little town in the state of Brandenburg is surrounded by wooded hills and several lakes and has been a popular retreat for many, including authors Theodor Fontane and Bertolt Brecht. So it's a great spot for an excursion and not just when you want to go for a swim. The lake's water is so clear that you can even see your own feet underwater. I especially like spending summer evenings here at the lake as it slowing becomes less crowded, the sailing boats start returning to their marinas, and the greenish water glistens in the setting sun.\n\nWhere: RB26 towards Kostrzyn, Poland; get off at Müncheberg, then take Bus 928 to Buckow Strand\n\n* Not to be confused with the Scharmützelsee in Bad Saarow\n\nTop 9: Strandbad Orankesee - the hidden one\n\nA natural lake that has been a popular bathing lake with a beautiful sandy beach and green sunbathing lawn since 1929. You can also hire beach chairs, sun loungers and deckchairs here. And all those who enjoy having fun can use the 52-metre-long slide. For the little ones, there is a children's water slide and a pool for non-swimmers. The Strandbad Orankesee is a little hidden, but once you've discovered it, you'll keep coming back.\n\nWhere: Tram 4 or bus 259 from Buschallee/Hansastraße or tram 5 from Freienwalder Straße - then a 10-minute walk\n\nTop 10: Strandbad Grünau - Baltic Sea feeling\n\nLocated directly on the River Dahme, Strandbad Grünau offers what its name promises: a wonderful natural backdrop and a marvellous sandy beach. As well as cosy beach chairs, you can hire parasols and sun loungers and even your own cabana. A welcome retreat for anyone who wants to experience even more relaxation and a little touch of luxury for a perfect day at the beach. But for those of you who like to exercise, there are also beach volleyball courts and equipment and various SUPs to choose from. You can end the day with a romantic sunset. Or you can check out the events calendar at Strandbad Grünau, where there is plenty on offer, including the regular beach festivals. Please note: the lido is completely cashless\n\nWhere: S Grünau, then take tram 68 to Strandbad Grünau\n\nTip 11: Plötzensee - the hidden swimming lake in Berlin\n\nAs you relax in the water surrounded by trees, it's hard to imagine that you're actually in the middle of Germany's largest city and had pedalled past factories and the Westhafen port on your way here. The lido at Plötzensee imbues 1920s chic, like a smaller version of the beach at Wannsee, a bit of the countryside right in the middle of the city. In addition to a small beach there are also extensive lawns.\n\nWhere: U9 to Westhafen, S 42 to Beusselstraße. Best reached by bicycle"
