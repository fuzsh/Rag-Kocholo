        "meta_description": "Lakes are known to be strongly affected by climate change as a result of their sensitivity to atmospheric forcing. The combined response of urban lakes to climatic changes and to urbanization of the catchment may be further altered by water quality management measures. We studied Lake Tegel in Berlin, Germany as a representative urban lake profoundly influenced by intense water management measures and a resulting complex hydrodynamic situation: Lake Tegel is fed by nutrient-rich river discharges and effluents from a phosphorus elimination plant (PEP). We estimated changes in water temperatures, the Wedderburn number, and the buoyancy frequency, as well as concentrations of dissolved oxygen and phosphate under climate change using a one-dimensional vertical hydrodynamic model coupled to a water quality model. Further, we investigated how four management scenarios with varying discharges of the PEP could affect the lake system. In all simulations, water temperatures increased and summer stratification extended. The modeling results demonstrated that the water management system buffers the high nutrient supply from the river inflow and can effectively mitigate negative effects of climate change on Lake Tegel, thus highlighting its importance for the lake ecosystem.",
