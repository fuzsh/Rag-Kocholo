        "text": "If the centre of Berlin holds no secrets for you and you need some fresh air, why not consider a nature excursion to Lake Tegel? The best way is to go to the Alt-Tegel underground station, the terminal of the U6 in the north. From there, take the pedestrian walkway through the old village of Tegel to the lakeside: the glaciers, pizzerias, snack bars and other amenities along the way will give you plenty of time to recharge your batteries before the walk. At the lake, you will come across the Greenwich Promenade. You can then take the lovely red painted steel bridge for a stroll along the lakeshore.\n\nIf it's summer, there are small beaches all around the lake if you feel like taking a dip. If you would like to take a trip to the other islands that line the lake, i.e. the Valentinswerder and Maienwerder islands, go to Tegelort at the very south of the Schwarzer Weg. There you take the (infrequent) ferry, which makes a loop before taking you back to the starting point, i.e. across the shore, but further south to Saatwinkel. There you can eat and drink there or take another ferry to the island Reiswerder, which offers a nice place for bathing. If you've reached this point, well done, you've come round Lake Tegel! To reach the Alt-Tegel underground station, walk up Bernauer Straße or take bus 133."
