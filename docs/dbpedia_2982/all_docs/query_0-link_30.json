        "text": "It’s no secret that we love to travel and are often exploring the world. Yet, there is this one place where we are happy to come back to again and again. Especially after a long journey, things are often quite similar: First one evening on the couch, relaxing and arriving back home. But the very next day we often go out and have a look at “our” Lake Tegel. A wonderful constant which will be here forever, whenever we come back to Berlin.\n\nWhen in June 2011 I finally bought the Canon 500D, I obviously immediately went to Lake Tegel, 5 minutes from my home. It was pretty late already around 10pm but there was still the last light on the horizon. It was more a tryout of the new camera than a planned shooting but nevertheless: If the light is right, there is not much to do wrong. In all years that passed since then, I rarely saw a sky quite like that again at Lake Tegel.\n\nWhat can I say, the scene was perfect. The water was still a bit frozen, a couple of clouds in the sky and a beautiful red-orange sunset. This cannon at Lake Tegel is a present of the London District Greenwich. Reinickendorf, the Berlin district in which the lake is located, is twinned with Greenwich. Therefore also the whole promenade is called “Greenwich-Promenade”."
