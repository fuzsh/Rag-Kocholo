        "meta_description": "This imposing Wilhelminian-style corner building at Alt-Tegel 25, replete with a charming tower, catches the eye from afar. And that’s saying something in this beautiful Alt-Tegel neighbourhood, which is home to a large number of classic properties, tall trees and cobblestone streets. A residential and commercial building, Alt-Tegel 25 was built in 1910. Bay windows, dormers and balconies delineate the facade.\r\nThe property is home to sixteen apartments and three commercial units on five floors. The apartments feature between two and four rooms, with floor plans ranging from approx. 59 to 116 sqm. Street-facing balconies and roof terraces provide a place to relax in the fresh air for many of the apartments. Most bathrooms are equipped with bathtubs. Most of the four-room apartments also have a half-bathroom for guests. The three commercial units are on the ground floor and are used as an Indian restaurant, pizzeria and cosmetic studio.",
