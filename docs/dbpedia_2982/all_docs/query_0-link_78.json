The lake is navigable to its eastern end, and navigation is administered as part of the Havel–Oder–Wasserstraße.\n\nMost of the waterfront of the lake is privately held. Within the lake are the islands of Hasselwerder, Lindwerder, Scharfenberg, Reiswerder, Baumwerder, Valentinswerder and Maienwerder. Scharfenberg, Valentinswerder and Maienwerder are accessible by some of Berlin's ferry services.\n\nLake Tegel"
