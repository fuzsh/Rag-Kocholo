        "text": "Prediction of mixing intensity of water masses in riverine Lake Tegel (Berlin, Germany) can be used to trace the fate of pollutants that enter the lake through several inflows. Because the contributions of each inflow have not yet been quantified and because the lake features complex bathymetry and numerous islands, a hydrodynamic circulation model with high spatial resolution and dynamic wind forcing is useful. We applied the two-dimensional version of the Princeton Ocean Model to separate the influences of wind and river discharge on the currents and mass transport in Lake Tegel. For model validation, we compared the simulation results with 1 year of electrical conductivity data, which was used as a conservative tracer to distinguish between water from the River Havel and water supplied by a smaller second inflow. Calculation of currents alone is insufficient to investigate water exchanges between rivers and lakes, especially when several islands create multiple pathways for river intrusion. Therefore, mass transport simulations are applied. Our calculations based on archetypical scenarios indicate that the proportion of (polluted) water from the River Havel in the main basin of Lake Tegel fluctuates with river discharge and wind, which either amplify or neutralize each other."
