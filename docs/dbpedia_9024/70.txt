6PM Doors

Buffalo Iron Works

Formed in New Orleans in 1998, by trombone players Mark Mullins and Craig Klein (who from 1990-2006, were also members of Harry Connick Jr.’s big band), Bonerama bills itself as a brass/funk/rock band but Bonerama is much more than that. Bonerama is a New Orleans musical institution. They are one of the most genuine, unique and interesting bands to have ever come out of the Crescent City.

Bonerama incorporates jazz, brass, funk, fusion, soul, pop, rock, blues, a touch of alternative and even a bit of reggae into its one-of-a-kind sound. Three trombones front the band, plus a sousaphone, guitar and drums all delivering a powerful sound that you have to hear to believe.

Known the world over for its incendiary live performances, Bonerama has been bringing its specialized brand of New Orleans music to the masses for 20 years. Bonerama is currently comprised of Mullins (trombone, electric trombone and lead vocals), Klein (trombone and lead vocals), Greg Hicks (trombone and vocals), Bert Cotton (guitar), Matt Perrine (sousaphone and electric bass) and Walt Lundy (drums).
