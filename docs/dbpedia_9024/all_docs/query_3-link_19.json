        "text": "When New Orleans’ Bonerama takes the stage, you can guess it’s not like any brass band you’ve seen. Founded by Mark Mullins and Craig Klein, former members of Harry Connick Jr.’s Big Band, Bonerama carries the brass band concept to places unknown.\n\nNow Bonerama is bringing years of concert experience-performing, recording, composing and practical knowledge-to the classroom, offering clinics, workshops and live performances to select middle schools, high schools, colleges and universities worldwide. Bonerama’s passion for music is contagious and they consistently seek to instill this same enthusiasm for music in their students and fans alike.\n\nClinics or workshops can be custom tailored to cover preferred topics chosen by your faculty and students. Trombone Master Class, Fundamentals of Brass, Intonation, Jazz Improvisation, Small Group Performance, A Musician’s Life and Fundamentals of The Music Business are just some of the most frequently requested clinic topics.\n\nBonerama conducts their workshops, clinics and concerts in a group setting, sharing ideas and demonstrating a hands-on application of useful performance tips. Students move forward with a sense of renewed direction and a greater appreciation for their instrument and live performance that will last a lifetime.\n\nNEW! – Sheet music is now available in our store for Shake Your Rugalator by Craig Klein. The download includes parts for: 4 trombones, guitar, organ/piano, bass/sousaphone, drum kit, vocals (in bass and treble clefs) and a complete conductors score. As a bonus, we’ve also included an MP3 of Shake Your Rugalator by Bonerama from Live From New York, along with the ‘Rugalator info sheet,’ which tells the story of the rugalator and explains more about the feel of the song. Buy your copy for your school group and learn to play it today.\n\nAlso available: Sheet music for Bap Bap by Mark Mullins.\n\nTESTIMONIALS: Here are a few recent testimonials from educators across the country.\n\n“What an amazing experience we all had. I cannot thank you or your entire crew enough for giving us memories that will last a lifetime! Great people….all of your folks were awesome….great music….and an absolutely PRICELESS experience for my students, our school and certainly for me! We loved it and would love to have you all back to Arlington again!”\n\nRichard Guillen\n\nDirector of Bands\n\nArlington High School\n\nLaGrangeville, NY\n\n“Bonerama was just plain awesome. Thank you so much for coming to our trombone camp. The kids just raved about your performance and I cackled with glee with “The Ocean” started, and I’m not much of a cackler.”\n\nTimothy Riordan\n\nMerit School of Music\n\nChicago, IL\n\n“You guys are amazing. I had hopes that you would show up and inspire my students in ways that go outside the typical “School of Music” music experience, and you guys went way beyond that. It was never about the trombone- it was always about the music and the voice you use to make your music. It was apparent right at the start of your class that you guys were genuine and honest with your art and serious about your craft. The casual and supportive nature of your interaction with us all day shows what drives you in the first place. You’ve certainly given me some inspiration to keep reaching out artistically. Thank you for bringing such a great vibe to our school and for playing such a magnificent concert!”\n\nMark Hetzler\n\nAssoc. Professor of Trombone, Brass Area Chair\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin at Madison – School of Music\n\nRECENT PRESS: Read what Dan Brechlin at the Record Journal in Connecticut had to say about Bonerama’s 5/27/11 clinic and concert at Francis T. Maloney High School in Meriden, CT (click here)."
