        "text": "Tune In, Turn On\n\nBy Doug Deutsch\n\nSouthern rock is a genre that’s still going strong. For more than half century, bands such as Lynyrd Skynyrd, Little Feat, Wet Willie and of course, The Allman Brothers Band paved the way for today’s generation of Southern rockers. In that spirit, Whiskey Myers will take the stage at Hard Rock’s Etess Arena Friday, Aug. 9, with Special Guest Blackberry Smoke.\n\nWhiskey Myers, hailing from Palestine, Texas, has a lead singer, Cody Cannon, whose vocals are reminiscent of Skynyrd’s Ronnie Van Zandt. Their most recent recording, “Tornillo,” was released in 2022.\n\nOpeners Blackberry Smoke from Scottsdale, Ga., are a good fit with the headliners. Their gritty, soul-tinged hard rock can be heard to best effect on their new album, “Be Right Here.” I’ve seen them live and they’re lots of fun.\n\nFun Fact: The Black Crowes’ Chris Robinson, friends with members of Blackberry Smoke, gave the group their name. See them 7:30 p.m. Friday, Aug. 9, at Hard Rock’s Etess Arena. Tickets/info: Ticketmaster.com.\n\n‘Kid Rock’ Kobi Reese: Every once in a while we here at Tune In Turn On come across up-and-coming talent that we have to follow. One such act to watch is Kobi Reese (pictured above, center, with band). At just 13 years old, the vocalist (and avid drummer) fronts an always-busy seven-piece band. He also takes charge of most important band activities, including hiring the musicians and dealing with the media.\n\nKobi and band normally sport rock attire for their shows, with Kobi even channeling Rob Halford of Judas Priest, dressed all in black leather. Recently they chose a much different look, putting on sharp white suits for their new song and video, which drops Aug. 9.\n\n“We were on the beach at sunrise filming the music video for my new song,” Reese told us this week. “We covered an amazing song. We added a bit of our own rock vibe to it.” Then, he adds, “My band is younger now, but now we are amazing and we are ready to spread our music throughout the world!”\n\nSee Kobi Reese rock out under the stars in AC’s Orange Loop at the Tennessee Avenue Beer Hall 8 p.m. Saturday, Aug. 10 (no cover). See kobireese-theband.com.\n\nNew Orleans (Re) Re-Visited: Last week this column covered the terrific recent New Orleans-inspired Tony Mart Last Waltz concert on the AC Boardwalk, featuring some of the Crescent City’s finest roots musicians, including horn player extraordinaire Mark Mullins of Bonerama. On Wednesday, Aug. 14 at 7 p.m., Mullins brings Bonerama back for an evening of funky, brassy music called “Mardi Gras on the Boardwalk.”\n\nSpeaking of Tony Mart, their AtlantiCare-sponsored Somers Point Beach Concert Series features reggae greats Third World on Friday, Aug. 9 (nothing better than dancing with your honey to “Now That We Found Love” on a warm summer night by the bay), and our favorite blues sax player, Jimmy Carpenter Friday, Aug. 23. Carpenter is a multi-Blues Music Awards winner whose new album, “Just Got Started,” drops Sept. 13 on Gulf Coast Records. Concerts on the Beach start at 7 p.m. at Morrow Beach. Info: tonymart.com and somerspointbeachconcerts.com.\n\nTill next week, Tune In Turn On, and please support local."
