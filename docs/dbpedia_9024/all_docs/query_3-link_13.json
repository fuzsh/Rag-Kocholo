        "text": "Equally adept at delivering extraordinary originals or blistering covers of artists as diverse as Led Zeppelin; The Beatles; The Allman Brothers; Jimi Hendrix; even Black Sabbath, Bonerama’s distinctive, inimitable, genuine, one-of-a-kind sound is unmatched, high-energy, fun, dynamic and bold. “Bonerama is fun. Bonerama is powerful,” raves ALL ABOUT JAZZ.\n\nAcclaimed Funky Brass & Fusion Band BONERAMA is a band that in many ways defies categorization. A funky rock band with brass...a funky brass band that rocks! Bonerama is a \"brass-band force of nature\" raves NPR. Bonerama is a New Orleans-based band that fuses everything that has made that city's music famous into a genre defying gumbo. The band has taken the best elements of Rock, Soul, Fusion, Pop, Jazz, Funk, Brass, Gospel and Blues to forge its unique sound. Formed in 1998, Bonerama is the brainchild of trombone players Mark Mullins and Craig Klein (who from 1990-2006, were also members of Harry Connick Jr.'s big band). Currently comprised of Mullins (Trombone, Electric Trombone and Lead Vocals), Klein (Trombone and Lead Vocals), Greg Hicks (Trombone and Vocals), Bert Cotton (Lead Guitar), Matt Perrine (Sousaphone and Electric Bass) and Walt Lundy (Drums), Bonerama is one of the funkiest and most unique bands to ever come out of New Orleans! They deliver epic live shows!"
