        "text": "\"A brass-band force of nature\"\n\n– NPR\n\nAnybody who’s been to a Bonerama live show is no stranger to the band laying down some funked-up, brassy renditions of classic rock songs. Fans of those moments are in for a treat, because the band is gifting the world an album of nothing but Led Zeppelin covers*.\n\nBonerama Plays Zeppelin is exactly what you think it is, a collection of your favorite songs from the greatest rock band of all time covered by the greatest trombone band of all time. If you have any doubt that a Trombone-centric band can really rock, pick a tune at random from this release, and be defied. Whether it be the lava-hot vocals on “Black Dog,” the distorted wah-wah trombone replacing the traditional guitar on “In My Time of Dying,” or even a surreal lightning-fast sousaphone solo on the funkified version of “Heartbreaker,” Bonerama proves they can rock with the best of them.\n\nMembers:\n\nMark Mullins (trombone, lead vocals)\n\nCraig Klein (trombone, lead vocals)\n\nGreg Hicks (trombone, vocals)\n\nBert Cotton (guitar)\n\nMatt Perrine (sousaphone, electric bass)\n\nWalter Lundy (drums)\n\n*Two full sets will be performed: first set will be original Bonerama material, and the second set will be music from the great Led Zeppelin.\n\nJoin us for dinner before or during the show.
