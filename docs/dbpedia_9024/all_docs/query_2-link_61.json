        "text": "Leon Majcen is a musician whose story is one of resilience and determination. He grew up on the Gulf Coast of Florida, the son of Bosnian war refugees who had fled their homeland in search of a better life for their children. From a young age, Leon was drawn to the power of storytelling through music, particularly the work of artists like Townes Van Zandt, John Prine, Bob Dylan, and Guy Clark.\n\nLeon began playing in local bars while still in high school, honing his craft and building a loyal following. After graduating, he decided to pursue his passion for music in New York City, while attending college at New York University and playing shows around town. After a while, Leon came to the realization that the hustle and bustle of the city wasn't where his heart was at.\n\nHe returned home to Florida and took a job at a commercial fishing dock, filleting and packing fish while he planned his next move. And that move was to Nashville, where Leon hoped to make his mark as a singer-songwriter. Since arriving in Nashville, Leon has continued to develop his unique blend of Americana, folk, and country music, drawing on his experiences and his love of the outdoors to craft songs that are both poignant and powerful. With his heartfelt lyrics, soulful voice, and deft guitar work, Leon has built a strong following in Music City and beyond.\n\n​\n\nBonerama is a brass funk rock band from New Orleans that will be performing at The Ark Bowl & BBQ in Arkville, New York aka Catskill Mountains on Friday, August 16, 2024 at 7pm.\n\nBonerama was formed in 1998 by trombone players Mark Mullins and Craig Klein, who, from 1990 up until late 2006, were also members of Harry Connick Jr.'s big band.\n\nEven in a city that doesn’t play by the rules, New Orleans’ Bonerama is something different. They can evoke vintage funk, classic rock and free improvisation in the same set; maybe even the same song. Bonerama has been repeatedly recognized by Rolling Stone, hailed as “the ultimate in brass balls” (2005) and praised for their “…crushing ensemble riffing, human-feedback shrieks and wah-wah growls” (2007). Bonerama carries the brass-band concept to places unknown; what other brass band could snag an honor for “Best Rock Band” (Big Easy Awards 2007)? As cofounder Mark Mullins puts it, “We thought we could expand what a New Orleans brass band could do. Bands like Dirty Dozen started the “anything goes” concept, bringing in the guitars and the drum kit and using the sousaphone like a bass guitar. We thought we could push things a little further.”\n\nJoin us on Saturday, March 9th at 7pm in the Front Room with the Grooviest Classic Rock n' Roll Band in the Catskills and parts of Poughkeepsie.\n\nCold Beer, wine for the refined in our hood, Barq's Root Beer. Burgahs and Rock n' Roll...\n\n$5 cover at the door.\n\nJoin us on Sunday, August 18, 2024 at 3pm for an afternoon of The Blues performed by the Jimmy Carpenter Band of Las Vegas, Nevada by way of New Orleans & North Carolina.\n\n​\n\nJimmy Carpenter is a Saxophonist, singer-songwriter, arranger, and Gulf Coast Records recording artist, the Jimmy Carpenter Band is on a roll!\n\nJimmy won the 2021 and 2022 Blues Music Award (BMA) for Best Instrumentalist/Horn and he is now a Grammy-Winning Composer, for a composition he contributed to the New Orleans Nightcrawlers’ winning album, \"Atmosphere\".\n\n​\n\nJimmy has toured internationally with Tinsley Ellis, Jimmy Thackery, Walter Wolfman Washington, Eric Lindell, and Mike Zito and the Wheel. The Jimmy Carpenter Band record \"Soul Doctor\", the bands first album released in 2019 on Gulf Coast Records, was extremely well-received worldwide, and in September 2022, the band released his fifth solo album, The Louisiana Record, a collection of his favorite New Orleans songs, also on Gulf Coast. Jimmy has been a working musician for over 40 years, spent many years in New Orleans, and now resides in Las Vegas, where he is the Musical Director of one of the hottest blues festivals in the world, The Big Blues Bender."
