        "text": "Is it possible that there are simply no good band names left? First there was Does It Offend You, Yeah?, a group that is somehow popular enough to play Coachella despite having the single worst name ever, and now I find out that Thrill Jockey just signed a band called Thank You. Reminds me of the old joke about the band that called itself Free Beer, except it isn't funny. There are more horribly named bands with recent or upcoming releases, most of which you will never hear: Ascension of the Watchers, Stewboss, Cadence Weapon, School of Language, Pegasuses XL, The XYZ Affair, The A.K.A.s, Asturiana, E for Explosion, Anti-Flag, and Bonerama.\n\nActually, Bonerama is pretty great.Here's a tip, kids. If you've never used a word in a sentence, don't put it in your band name. Unless it's a made up name, like Sebadoh or Fugazi or … well, Bonerama. But not Asturiana. (Advanced tip: your made-up name should never have more than one vowel in a row.)\n\nAlso, I don't care how much you like Clap Your Hands Say Yeah—don't use a whole sentence as your band name.\n\nAnd what's with all the letters and abbreviations? There's a reason the Fab Four didn't call themselves the B-tles.\n\nFinally, what the fuck is a Cadence Weapon?\n\nPersonally, I blame MySpace for this epidemic. It's having the same effect the Screen Actors Guild has had on actors (we've gone from James Dean to Haley Joel Osment in 50 short years) but times a million. I defy you to think of a solid, strike-down-the-middle band name that is not being used by some trio of pimpled A-levelers in Wankersbury, England.\n\nThat's why I think there should be a message board online where retiring bands can offer up their used names to anyone who wants them. As a former member of such inexcusably named bands as Aural Fixation, Gesso, and Floorboard, let me be the first to extend this offer."
