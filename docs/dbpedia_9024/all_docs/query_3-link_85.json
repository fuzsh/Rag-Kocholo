        "text": "THE BAND\n\nThe Funky Butt Brass Band was formed in 2008 by six talented musicians who respect and revere the New Orleans brass band tradition. The FBBB takes classic New Orleans brass tunes and gives them a twist, in the style of Dirty Dozen Brass Band, Rebirth and Bonerama. But don’t be surprised if you also hear some Minneapolis funk, Southern rock, Memphis soul, Chicago blues and St. Louis R&B in the mix.\n\nADAM HUCKE\n\n// trumpet, vocals\n\nAdam is originally from Millstadt, Illinois. Along with playing trumpet and singing in FBBB, Adam performs with numerous other local bands, including as one-half (with Cody Henry) of Sophisticated Babies. In 2017, he released a critically-acclaimed eclectic solo album, Madam I'm Adam. Adam also enjoys cooking, playing ukulele, good beer and laughing a minimum of 400 times a day. He and his wife Diana live in St. Louis City.\n\nBRYAN FRITZ\n\n// sax, vocals\n\nBryan was born and raised in St. Charles, MO, where he discovered his love for music at an early age and found his true calling on saxophone as he entered middle school. His parents would often take him to the city to see (and sit in with) some of the finest musicians in St. Louis, including Oliver Sain, Benny Smith and Willie Akins. Bryan earned a bachelor’s degree in music from Northern Illinois University and moved to Chicago in 2010. After five years playing salsa, jazz, blues, r&b and stage shows, Bryan moved back to St. Louis, where he resides with his wife Michelle and a feisty dog.\n\nAARON CHANDLER\n\n// trombone, vocals\n\nAaron's musical history stretches back to his great-grandfather Pryor Thurman, a hell of a hand on fiddle. At 12, he discovered the trombone and quickly became a \"not quite\" child prodigy. He was accepted into the music program at Southeast Missouri State University, which led to numerous opportunities including playing with such legends as Clark Terry, The Temptations, and Rufus Thomas. With his wonderful wife Erica, two rowdy young sons Milo and Hank, a thriving trombone repair business, a love of fine sandwiches and an active musical career, Aaron considers himself one of the luckiest guys on Earth.\n\nRON SIKES\n\n// drums\n\nBy day, Ron is a mild-mannered band director and college percussion instructor. By night, he’s a freelance musician, composer and arranger. He and wife Catie live in Jefferson County with their three lovely daughters. Besides drumming with FBBB and his many teaching responsibilities, Ron stays busy playing with the Unity Quartet, Back Pocket Trio and the Southside Creole Playboys. He is also an accomplished jazz vibraphonist, an aspiring bass player and is endorsed by Lewi® Customs Cajons and Vic Firth Sticks and Mallets.\n\nJIM PETERS\n\n// guitar, vocals\n\n​\n\nJim Peters hails from the mean streets of Brentwood, MO. He began playing guitar at age eleven and within a couple years was regularly sitting in with some of the top Blues and R&B acts in St. Louis. Jim has performed and/or recorded with a wide range of artists over his 30+ year career- including Javier Mendoza, The Sleepy Rubies, Celebration Day, Voodoo Players, Street Fighting Band, The Provels, The Fog Lights, The Upright Animals and many more. He is a diehard Cardinals fan and enjoys watching selection screens on streaming services. Jim and his wife Melissa live in St. Louis with their 2 children.\n\nCODY HENRY\n\n// sousaphone\n\nCody teaches jazz trombone at Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, where he studied jazz and received a Bachelors and Masters. Cody believes versatility is a strength and plays a number of instruments in a variety of styles from jazz and classical to hip-hop and R&B. Along with performing, he is an active jazz clinician. He also plays with Adam Hucke in the ukulele-and-tuba duo, Sophisticated Babies, and with Ron Sikes in the Unity Quartet. Cody lives in High Ridge, MO with wife Tami (also a trombonist) and their children."
