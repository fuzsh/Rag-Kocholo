        "text": "Craig Klein, a true New Orleans native, soaked in the city's music from an early age. His trombone journey started in high school, inspired by the sounds of Preservation Hall. He joined the Pair-A-Dice Tumblers and later co-founded The Storyville Stompers (1981) and The New Orleans NightCrawlers (1994). In 1990, he landed a gig with Harry Connick, Jr., touring and recording for 16 years. In 2006, he left to focus on Bonerama, a unique brass band with multiple trombones. Craig's also a founding member of the Grammy-winning New Orleans Nightcrawlers. The band's name came about spontaneously during a recording session at Toulouse Cabaret. In 2020, Craig released a tribute record, \"Talkative Horns,\" honoring his friend Lucien Barbarin. Craig's extensive discography includes over 150 records and his solo work, like \"New Orleans Trombonisms\" (2004). He's played alongside music legends such as Dr. John, The Neville Brothers, and Allen Toussaint.\n\nPhoto Credit: Frances Scanlon"
