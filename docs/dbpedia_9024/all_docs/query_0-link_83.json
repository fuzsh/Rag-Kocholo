        "text": "VAIL – New Orleans brass band Bonerama blows in today to play the second Street Beat concert of the season.\n\nThe band has had recent acclaim as it secured a national gig as the house band for the “Comic Relief” 20th anniversary show, which aired Nov. 18 on HBO. The initial stirrings of the trombone cavalcade known as Bonerama began in 1998, when Mark Mullins and Craig Klein found themselves with some rare time off from their steady gig in Harry Connick Jr.’s Big Band. Though both had exposed their jazz abilities, Mullins and Klein didn’t envision a jazz trombone assemblage. Instead, the Bonerama sound was to deliver pure horn muscle – rock ‘n’ roll along with the funk of their New Orleans’ roots. The sheer force of four trombones playing simultaneously was to be Bonerama’s calling card. New Orleans is well known for its excess and it should be no surprise that its musicians are prone to overindulge. Still, when Mullins and Klein formed the trombone blitzkreig of Bonerama, skeptics and traditionalists raised their voices in puritanical protest. A funk-rock troupe of trombone players had never been done, even in the “anything goes” environs of New Orleans.\n\nBonerama’s appearance marks the second installment of the Street Beat free concert series taking place in Vail Village. After Wednesday’s show, the series will take a hiatus for almost eight weeks, getting back under way with Tab Benoit on Feb. 14."
