Jambalaya Brass Band [Get Tickets]\n\n6pm-7pm Happy Hour with amazing drink specials\n\nThe Jambalaya Brass Band is a group of seasoned musical pros from a variety of impressive previous musical settings as diverse as the Duke Ellington Orchestra to the Lounge Lizards. These purveyors of authentic American ‘roots’ music play a delightful spicy musical gumbo of New Orleans fare from the likes of Jelly Roll Morton and Louis Armstrong, to the Rebirth and Dirty Dozen brass bands, to the heights of their own modern sounds which incorporate elements of R&B, Gospel, Funk, Zydeco, Latin, Hip-Hop and Be-bop.\n\n2/12: Flow Tribe [Get Tickets]\n\nStraight out of New Orleans and into your earholes, Flow Tribe comes at you with the delicacy of a sledgehammer. They create “backbone cracking music”, a soul shaking mixture of styles and sounds guaranteed to drive you wild. These are 6 seasoned performers who have shared the stage with the likes of Trombone Shorty, Juvenile, and BIll Summers just to name a few. A relentlessly touring band that plays major venues and festivals around the country bringing with them a heat and passion best described as “bizarrely irresistible”.\n\n2/20: John Papa Gros Band [Get Tickets]\n\nBorn in New Orleans, John “Papa” Gros, formerly of Papa Grows Funk, has spent more than a quarter-century championing the music of the Big Easy. He’s played it all — New Orleans funk, rock & roll, jazz, blues, Americana, pop/rock — and he swirls those styles into a genre-bending gumbo that pays tribute to his influences while still pushing ahead into new territory. Like Allen Toussaint and Dr. John, Gros is a proud local who carries on the tradition of New Orleans music, both honoring its past and helping to shape its future.\n\n2/25: Marc Broussard with The Last Bandoleros, Peter Aristone [Get Tickets]\n\nBroussard is an old-school Southern soul singer blessed with a rarefied gift and innate stylistic and emotional authenticity.\n\n3/16: The Modern Nolatet (Johnny Vidacovich, Mike Dillon, James Singleton, Brian Haas) [Get Tickets]\n\nFt. Truthseekers\n\nThese four men have been in each other’s lives, either in close proximity or as distant heroes for many years. Johnny Vidacovich (drums) and James Singleton (upright bass) have been New Orleans’ best rhythm section since 1977. Mike Dillon (vibes and percussion) and Brian Haas (piano) have been sharing co-bills and sitting in with each other’s bands on the same touring circuit for over 20 years. All four musicians are fiercely independent iconoclasts and bandleaders who compose, play and navigate their musical lives in their own unique way.\n\n3/25: Bonerama [Get Tickets]\n\nFt. Elise Testone’s For The Love Of NOLA\n\nThis 15 year old powerhouse brass touring band from New Orleans is unlike anything you’ve heard before.
