        "text": "In almost any town anywhere in the world, at any time, ever, the very thought of a trombone jam would be reason enough to reschedule your night out, stay home and take cover in the basement, away from windows or other potential hazards.\n\nNew Orleans isn't any town. So in 1998, when trombonist Mark Mullins used his weekly slot at the French Quarter joint Tipitina's to partner with fellow trombonist Craig Klein and organize a trombone super session, what resulted was a stage packed with top players making a huge sound that was actually cool and inspiring.\n\nIn that noise, Mullins and Klein, who'd been playing in the super-structured soundscape of Harry Connick Jr.'s band, heard the future, and it was a wall of trombones (backed by drums, bass, guitar and an organ), blasting everything from brass band standards to Black Sabbath covers.\n\nBonerama was born -- if you have to have a label, you could do worse than the \"funk/rock/jam band\" tag on the band's MySpace page, but stop worrying about labels.\n\n\"It's the basis of what New Orleans is all about,\" Mullins says. \"It's like that with the food. It's like that with the culture. It's like that with the way the city is run, the politics. You have all these different influences, all these beautiful cultures melding together in this incredible petri dish.\"\n\nIt's a place where musical possibility drifts in the air, where you go to a birthday party and find out the guest of honor's father happens to play in the one band you want to join.\n\nBig Sam Williams has always been Big Sam. Even when he was a kid he was big, too big to play basketball it turned out. Imagine that.\n\n\"I wound up joining my middle school marching band,\" he says. \"I just wanted something to do.\"\n\nSomeone handed him a trombone, and he asked, \"What's that?\"\n\nHe figured it out, and by the time he got to high school he wanted to do more, and because he was in New Orleans, he could stumble upon a record like \"Ears to the Wall,\" by the Dirty Dozen Brass Band.\n\n\"The things they were doing blew me away,\" Williams says.\n\nHe and some friends started a brass band, and he started playing with the Soul Rebels and then, one day, he was at a birthday party and noticed all kinds of jazz records. He remembers telling the girl whose birthday it was that he didn't know she liked jazz. She said they were her father's records.\n\n\"He plays trumpet,\" she told him.\n\nHis name was Efrem Towns. He played in the Dirty Dozen Brass Band.\n\n\"Where he at?\" Williams asked.\n\nHe laughs as he retells the story.\n\nThree years later, he got a call and hit the road with Dirty Dozen. His first gig was in Colorado with Widespread Panic. So you had a kid who'd joined the marching band, discovered jazz, discovered funk, joined a brass band that played all of that and was now playing in front of 20,000 people with a jam band from Athens, Ga. Since then he's played with everyone from Dave Matthews and Modest Mouse to Elvis Costello and Allen Toussaint.\n\nYou'll hear all those sounds listening to Big Sam's Funky Nation. Plus, the guy's a hell of a dancer, and he will get down.\n\nAt the end of April and the beginning of May, Bonerama and the Funky Nation were, like so many of New Orleans' musicians, all over and everywhere celebrating the Jazz and Heritage Festival.\n\nLate night/early morning shows in the French Quarter? Always. Guest appearances throughout the festival? Yep, plenty of those. On May 2, while one end of the festival was packed with Bon Jovi fans and the other was packed by Kings of Leon fans, a small stage in the middle filled with Midnite Disturbers, an all-star brass band that includes both Williams and Mullins.\n\n\"The tunes we play,\" Williams says. \"We do some brass band music, we do some Led Zeppelin tunes.\"\n\n\"There's so much going on during the jazz fest period,\" Mullins says. \"You look around and see who you're playing with, because you might actually forget.\"\n\nWith both bands in town for the Waterfront Blues Festival -- not to mention the July 4 super jam at the Marriott -- the only certainty is a good time. Mullins said they'd have to work up something for their July 4 set, and as much as Williams said he'd like to sit and enjoy Bonerama's set, he's never been able to pull that off. He always ends up on his feet and onstage.\n\n\"All I can do is worship a trombone band,\" Williams said."
