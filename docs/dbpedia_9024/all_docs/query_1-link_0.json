        "text": "American brass band\n\nBonerama is a brass funk rock band from New Orleans.\n\nBonerama was formed in 1998 by trombone players Mark Mullins and Craig Klein, who, from 1990[1] up until late 2006, were also members of Harry Connick Jr.'s big band. Shortly thereafter, they added trombone players Steve Suter, Brian O'Neill, and Rick Trolsen, sousaphone player Matt Perrine, guitarist Bert Cotton, and drummer Eric Bolivar. New Orleans drummers Russell Batiste, Stanton Moore, Doug Belote, Chad Gilmore, Terence Higgins, and Kevin O'Day have also been playing with Bonerama for periods of time. Later, Charlie Wooton and Nori Naraoka electric bass replaced Matt Perrine before his return to the band in 2013. Brian O'Neill had a heart attack and died while on a solo piano gig in New Orleans in December 2005.\n\nBonerama released their debut album in 2001. On January 2, 2008, Bonerama performed the national anthem at the 2008 Sugar Bowl. On February 5, they released a joint EP with OK Go, entitled You're Not Alone, to raise money for New Orleans musicians displaced by the 2005 Hurricane Katrina. After the departure of Rick Trolsen and Steve Suter in early 2009, trombonist Greg Hicks joined the band.\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nLive at the Old Point (Bonerama, 2001)\n\nLive from New York (Mule Train, 2004)\n\nBringing It Home (MTP, 2007)\n\nShake It Baby (Bonerama, 2013)\n\nHot Like Fire (Basin Street, 2017)\n\nBonerama Plays Zeppelin (Basin Street, 2019)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
