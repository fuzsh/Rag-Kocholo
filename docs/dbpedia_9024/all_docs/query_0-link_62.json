        "text": "« All Events\n\nThis event has passed.\n\nBONERAMA\n\n- 10:00 pm EDT\n\n$20\n\nAfter last year’s command performance at the Xerox Rochester International Jazz Fest, The Historic German House is proud to welcome Bonerama, on Saturday, November 4th!\n\nAfter four years since their last recording, New Orleans Brass & Rollers, Bonerama return with their seventh album Hot Like Fire on October 6, 2017, their first to be released by Basin Street Records.\n\nHot Like Fire finds Bonerama developing its dynamic, high-energy, fun, happy and bold moods further\n\nthan ever before. The New Orleans stalwarts deliver nine wonderfully brassy musical landscapes–seven\n\nof which are original compositions (including the concert staple “Mr. Okra”) along with powerful covers\n\nof Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” and the late Allen Toussaint’s “Basic Lady”.\n\nTickets for this can’t-miss event are available now!\n\nhttp://thehistoricgermanhouse.tunestub.com/event.cfm?cart&id=270585\n\nFormed in New Orleans in 1998, by trombone players Mark Mullins and Craig Klein (who from 1990\n\n-2006, were also members of Harry Connick Jr.’s big band), Bonerama bills itself as a brass/funk/rock\n\nband but Bonerama is much more than that. Bonerama is a New Orleans musical institution. They are one\n\nof the most genuine, unique and interesting bands to have ever come out of the Crescent City. Bonerama\n\nincorporates jazz, brass, funk, fusion, soul, pop, rock, blues, a touch of alternative and even a bit of reggae into its one-of-a-kind sound. Three trombones front the band, plus a sousaphone, guitar and drums all\n\ndelivering a powerful sound that you have to hear to believe.\n\nKnown the world over for its incendiary live performances, Bonerama has been bringing its specialized\n\nbrand of New Orleans music to the masses for 20 years. Bonerama is currently comprised of Mullins\n\n(trombone, electric trombone and lead vocals), Klein (trombone and lead vocals), Greg Hicks (trombone\n\nand vocals), Bert Cotton (guitar), Matt Perrine (sousaphone and electric bass) and Walt Lundy (drums).\n\n16+\n\n$2 additional for guests under 21\n\nDetails\n\nTime:\n\n8:00 pm - 10:00 pm EDT\n\nCost:\n\n$20\n\nEvent Category:\n\nClub & Events Calendar\n\nVenue\n\nThe German House\n\n315 Gregory St.\n\nRochester, NY United States + Google Map\n\nPhone:\n\n585-563-6241\n\nWebsite:\n\nhttp://siteline.vendini.com/site/historicgermanhouse.com/"
