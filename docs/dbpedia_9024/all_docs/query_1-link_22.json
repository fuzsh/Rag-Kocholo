        "text": "Last year, a certain university-friendly soda company’s commercial suggested the pull of its glowing machine was what attracted Jimi Hendrix to the guitar.\n\nNow imagine Hendrix had picked up a trombone — “Purple Haze” would sound quite a bit different, no?\n\nActually, it’s not as odd as you’d think — particularly if you’ve got a wah-wah pedal attached to the trombone, as Mark Mullins does when he and his band cover the Hendrix classic “Crosstown Traffic.”\n\nOf course, Hendrix on trombone isn’t the only eyebrow-raising part of that scenario: Mullins’ New Orleans-based band — which will perform at Baltimore’s Funk Box Thursday as part of the club’s Funky St. Patty’s Day Party — boasts four trombone players, a sousaphone player, a guitarist and a drummer. And, oh yeah, it’s called Bonerama.\n\n“People knew [Bonerama] was gonna be different, but they didn’t know if it was gonna be weird,” Mullins says on the phone from New Orleans. “But from the first song, we had people on their feet and you could just tell they seemed to be responding to it well. And that was cool to see — that they weren’t running for the doors.”\n\nMullins has a sense of humor about the brass behemoth that is his livelihood, which is a good thing. Not only is the trombone a less-than-traditional instrument to front a band, but in particular the band’s name can make navigating the Internet a bit dicey: A “.com” typed next to the moniker will take the average Bonerama fan to what could be termed a startling — and less than G-rated — destination. Mullins laughs when he recounts the time his mother mistakenly visited the site, and carefully notes the official address is a “.net.”\n\nBut that specification is just about the only rule — musical or otherwise — Mullins seems to follow. He sheepishly categorizes Bonerama as a “brass, funk and rock band,” even though he has a strong attachment to rock music.\n\nFor the past 15 years, Mullins and Bonerama bandmate Craig Klein have played with Harry Connick Jr.’s big band. And while Mullins also cites legendary New Orleans funk ensemble The Meters as a major influence, he regularly listens to Elliott Smith and Jeff Buckley and, of course, pays homage to Led Zeppelin and Hendrix in Bonerama’s set lists.\n\n“I would just be hearing these things on the radio and say, ‘Aw, now that would be cool to do with trombones!’” he says of the band’s repertoire, which includes Black Sabbath covers and a version of Edgar Winter’s “Frankenstein.”\n\nThe catalog also includes original tunes such as the infectious “Shake Your Rugulator” and the funk-rock swinger “Bone Up,” which features Mullins and his decidedly guitar-like, wah-wah distorted trombone trading notes with guitarist Bert Cotton.\n\nBut Mullins’ penchant for the electric guitar isn’t the only force driving Bonerama, which has been together for seven years. He says his fellow trombonists draw on everything from funk to classical trombone music, the latter thanks to bandmate Steve Suter — not to be confused with a certain star wide receiver — who used to play in the Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\n“There are so many trombone players here [in New Orleans],” Mullins says. “And every one’s different. Every one has a real distinct personality that they communicate to you in the way they play … We have all these different influences, and we thought it’d be fun to bring them all together and play some music and see what direction it goes in.”\n\nThe band often takes an unexpected course — particularly in its live shows. Both of the band’s records — 2001’s Live at the Old Point, recorded at New Orleans’ Old Point Bar & Grill, and 2004’s Live from New York, recorded over two nights at Tribeca Rock Club in lower Manhattan — are live recordings, which is a custom Bonerama purposely adopted.\n\n“We find that there are so many things that happen in our gigs that are spontaneous,” Mullins says. “We like the arrangements a lot, but an equal part of what we do is when we get off the page and we start messing around. To me, it’s all about reacting to the people, too, to the audience. I don’t think it would show what we do very well if we tried to capture that in the studio.”\n\nThis week’s appearance in Baltimore isn’t Bonerama’s first in the city, but Mullins says the band looks to expand its touring schedule and fanbase beyond funk-friendly cities such as New York and San Francisco. Fortunately, no matter how far-flung the band’s gigs become, the influence of legendary brass hotbed New Orleans will be hard to shake.\n\nThe members of Bonerama either grew up in the city or have spent a great deal of their careers there; Mullins, who as a kid formed his own Dixieland band to march in the city’s bevy of parades, graduated from Loyola University New Orleans’ College of Music and got himself a double education of sorts. By day, he’d learn technique, but he had the evenings to troll New Orleans’ music clubs and pick up what he calls “the real world stuff.”\n\n“It’s not a real big city,” Mullins says. “Yet there’s so much talent here, and so many people who are just great musicians. Even people who aren’t professionals, it seems like everybody plays something. There must be something in the water.”"
