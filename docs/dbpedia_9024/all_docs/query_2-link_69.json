        "text": "Biography\n\nTour\n\nUpdates\n\nMark Mullins has played a significant role in helping elevate the status of the trombone in New Orleans music over the last 30 years. As a driving force in fronting Bonerama and the award winning MuleBone from the 1990’s with the trombone, his unique funk rock approach to the popular instrument has been widely respected and recognized for years. As one of the main rock influencers in Bonerama, Mark is a fearless cover artist and arranger taking on anything from Led Zeppelin to the Allman Brothers through the voice of the trombone with a sense of arrangement sensibility that brings new life to each song.\n\nIn 1990 Mullins began touring and recording with The Harry Connick Jr. Orchestra as lead trombone while locally being a member of George Porter Jr.’s early Runnin’ Parnders band throughout the 90’s before eventually shifting gears to Bonerama. In 2005 Rolling Stone Magazine’s David Fricke dubbed Bonerama as “the ultimate in brass balls” and Bonerama still continues to entertain festival and club audiences across the country today. Mark’s appearances as a special guest with the Radiators exposed him even further to music fans here in New Orleans as a dynamic trombonist and soloist that could fit seamlessly in the long extended live jams the radiators are so known for.\n\nIn recent years Mark has been doing extensive work as a horn arranger, often serving as horn arranger for the New York City based Blackbird Presents series of concerts that feature Don Was as musical director. Mark’s horn arrangements and horn section “The Levee Horns” have backed Bruce Springsteen, Keith Richards, Sheryl Crow, Gregg Allman, Peter Frampton, John Fogarty, Michael McDonald, Dr. John, Warren Haynes, Mavis Staples, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Eric Church and more.\n\nIn 2019 Mark’s original song “Empty World” (Bonerama) was released on Basin Street records and features Michael McDonald on lead vocals in a tribute to the late New Orleans music legend Allen Toussaint.\n\nJoin us Friday April 9, 2021 as Mark Mullins performs at the Funky Uncle with Cass Faulconer (bass), Chris Adkins (guitar) and Alvin Ford Jr. (drums).\n\nNo upcoming event scheduled\n\nOur Twitter feed is currently unavailable but you can visit our official twitter page @markmullins."
