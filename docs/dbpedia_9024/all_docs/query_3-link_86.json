        "text": "When Hurricane Nate was threatening the gulf coast, the city of New Orleans ill-advisedly instituted a city-wide curfew 36 hours before the unpredictable storm was slated to make landfall. Perhaps the early warning was because of devastation wrought in Houston or long memories of Katrina. Though the storm ended up to the east of us, numerous shows were cancelled including Bonerama’s album release party.\n\nBack in October, their seventh studio album, Hot Like Fire, the first on New Orleans’ premier independent label, Basin Street Records, was released on schedule and has been earning rave reviews. Due to the only-in-New Orleans, trombone-driven funky rock band’s relentless touring schedule, the party was rescheduled for Saturday night. Darcy Malone and the Tangle are the opening act.\n\nBonerama first burst on the scene twenty years ago with a sound unlike anyone had ever heard. With three trombones out front, led by founding members Mark Mullins and Craig Klein, the group moved past genres into a category of one.\n\nWith a sousaphone and drum kit (Matt Perrine and Walt Lundy respectively) driving the beat, they can sound like a brass band. With a driving electric guitar, played with jazzy aplomb by Bert Cotton, they can rock. Given this is a New Orleans band through and through, heavy funk is in the DNA as well provided in a large part by third trombonist Greg Hicks. Consider his solo on the album’s last cut, “Christiania.”\n\nHot Like Fire finds the band entering another phase of their illustrious career. The new album sparkles sonically with mostly original compositions from the pen of Mullins, Klein and Perrine.\n\nThe opener, Perrine’s “Bad Dog” positively rocks. The title cut, written by Klein, grooves like a sunny day with the sousaphone bubbling underneath. Mullins’ “Happy” has a pop feel and a melody line that sums up its title. Cotton’s blazing solos in the middle of the song and the outro keep their New Orleans cred intact. The group even reaches into reggae and doo wop with Perrine’s “Sun Lion.”\n\nThe two covers, Radiohead’s classic, “Paranoid Android” and Allen Toussaint’s relatively obscure “Basic Lady,” don’t so much show the band’s influences as much as demonstrate their depth. On the intro of the latter, the group gives an instrumental shout out to one of Toussaint’s biggest hits, “Java,” before Mullins shows off his vocal chops.\n\nBasin Street mainstay Tracey Freeman provides strong production work and mixing making Hot Like Fire a wonderful addition to both Bonerama’s discography and the label’s catalog. However, there is still nothing like seeming them live with solos blazing and the rhythm section surging."
