        "meta_description": "Advance Ticket $20Day Of Show $24.67 + sales taxVeteran award winning New Orleans trombonist Mark Mullins (Bonerama) brings his latest assembly into Chickie Wah Wah for a rare live show Sat. Dec. 9, 2023. Mark Mullins - trombone (Bonerama), Chris Adkins - guitar (George Porter Jr.), Cass Faulconer - bass (Cowboy Mouth) , Deven Trusclair - drums (Dumpstaphunk), Mike Lemmler - keys (George Porter Jr.)﻿Mark Mullins has played a significant role in helping elevate the status of the trombone as a lead instrument in New Orleans music for over 30 years, predating the emergence and popularity of future great New Orleans trombone fronted bands such as Trombone Shorty and Orleans Avenue, Big Sam’s Funky Nation and others. As a driving force in fronting Bonerama and the award winning MuleBone in the 1990's with the trombone, his unique funk rock approach to the popular instrument has been widely respected and recognized for years. As the main rock influencer in Bonerama, Mark is a fearless cover artist, composer and arranger taking on anything from Led Zeppelin to the Allman Brothers through the voice of the trombone with a sense of arrangement sensibility that brings new life to each song. In 1990 Mullins began touring and recording with The Harry Connick Jr. Orchestra as lead trombone while locally being a member of George Porter Jr.'s early Runnin' Parnders band throughout the 90’s before eventually shifting gears to Bonerama. In 2005 Rolling Stone Magazine's David Fricke dubbed Bonerama as “the ultimate in brass balls” and Bonerama still continues to entertain festival and club audiences across the country today. Mark's appearances as a special guest with the Radiators exposed him even further to music fans here in New Orleans as a dynamic trombonist and soloist that could fit seamlessly in the long extended live jams the radiators are so known for.In recent years Mark has been doing extensive work as a horn arranger, often working with the New York City based Blackbird Presents series of concerts that feature Don Was as musical director. Mark's horn arrangements and horn section \"The Levee Horns\" have backed Bruce Springsteen, Keith Richards, R.E.M., Robbie Robertson, Sheryl Crow, Gregg Allman, Peter Frampton, John Fogarty, Michael McDonald, Dr. John, Warren Haynes, Mavis Staples, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Eric Church and more. In 2019 Mark’s original song “Empty World” (Bonerama) was released on Basin Street records and features Michael McDonald on lead vocals in a tribute to the late New Orleans music legend, Allen Toussaint.",
