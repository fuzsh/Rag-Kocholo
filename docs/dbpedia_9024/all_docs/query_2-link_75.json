        "text": "MOBILE, Alabama – Some places, the guys in Bonerama might have to explain a little bit about Mardi Gras before launching into some Mardi Gras music. But not in Mobile, said band co-founder Mark Mullins: \"We know y'all know how to do it, too.\"\n\nBonerama appears Saturday, Jan. 26, at Soul Kitchen Music Hall, a show that will be headlined by Trombone Shorty & Orleans Avenue. \"It's going to be a really slamming New Orleans music show for the good people of Mobile,\" Mullins promised.\n\nStart with Bonerama: As the moniker indicates, this is a band with a flair for audacity.\n\n“For the people that aren’t aware of what we do, the name of the band is probably enough shock and awe for some people right away,” Mullins promised. “Then they see these three trombone players at the front of the stage, playing anything from New Orleans funk to Black Sabbath to any sort of funk or party-type music.”\n\nActive since 1998, Bonerama has made a name for itself as a crowd-pleasing brass band from which no piece of classic rock is safe. The group is well-equipped to play more traditional New Orleans funk, but fun YouTube clips abound of it taking on tunes such as Black Sabbath’s “War Pigs,” Led Zeppelin’s “The Ocean” and the Allman Brothers’ “Whipping Post.”\n\nMullins acknowledged that there’s a fine line between being novel and being a novelty, but said he’s confident Bonerama’s players stay on the right side of it.\n\n“We try to spell out pretty quickly for people that we’re there to have fun, but we also try to communicate that we do take our music seriously,” he said. “But we don’t get stuck on ourselves too seriously, to where we’re not going to have a good time on stage. We gotta have a good time on stage. People want that, we want it, it’s what we all go to see shows for, to enjoy ourselves.”\n\n“We’ve been going for 14 years and it never gets old,” he said. “It’s definitely no gimmick. It’s no gag or freak show. It’s a band of really solid, for-real New Orleans players.”\n\nMuch of that also applies to the act at the top of the bill. Troy “Trombone Shorty” Andrews is one of the younger stars of the New Orleans scene, but also one of the brightest. In the years following Hurricane Katrina, he achieved national prominence as an exponent of New Orleans’ musical wealth. He calls his eclectic, high-energy sound “Supafunkrock.”\n\nMullins is among the elders who got to know Andrews as a kid and now think of him as a peer.\n\n“We’ve known him since he was, well, since he was really “shorty.” There was something special about Troy at a young age that I think a lot of people could see,” Mullins said.\n\n“He’s got this work ethic and focus and determination and drive. And at the top of that list should be talent,” he said. “He’s doing everything and more that everybody hoped he could be doing. It’s a great thing for New Orleans musicians of all kinds to have somebody like him kind of rise out of the crowd and be like this new young ambassador for New Orleans and New Orleans music. And we all have the utmost respect for what he’s doing.”\n\n“His band just gets better and better all the time,” Mullins said. “He’s got a really entertaining show, which doesn’t at all take away from the musical integrity of what they’re doing.”\n\nThe funny thing is that when the bands take the same stage, it’s usually not in New Orleans. They’re more likely to meet when they’re on the road, Mullins said.\n\nAnd speaking of that road, Mullins said he hopes it brings Bonerama to more stops in Mobile in the future. The group regularly travels to points farther east, but usually finds itself just passing through Mobile and Pensacola.\n\nBonerama has a new album nearing release, one that features special guests such as Dr. John, Dave Malone of the Radiators and Mike Mills of R.E.M. So maybe they’ll be back sometime in the spring with new music. But in the short term, they know what they need to do, since they’ll be hitting Mobile on the second night of the downtown parade season. (Showtime is 10 p.m.; tickets are $20 in advance, $24 day of show; patrons younger than 18 must be accompanied by a parent. Tickets available through www.soulkitchenmobile.com and at Mellow Mushroom restaurants in Mobile.)\n\n“I’m sure you’ll see some Carnival music on the set list,” Mullins said. “We’ll be bringing that straight from I-10 West.”"
