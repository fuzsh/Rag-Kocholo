The group Bonerama, known best for the group of trombone players from whom the band gets its name, has rightly gained the reputation as go-to musicians when other bands need a brassier sound.

They’ve attracted a wide range of acts, from R.E.M. to the Sierra Leone Refugee All Stars to Clap Your Hands Say Yeah lead singer Alec Ounsworth on his solo debut.

“With R.E.M., you would think they wouldn’t have horns on their songs, but they did want them,” said Mark Mullins, the group’s co-founder and one of its trombonists.

“For us, it’s full circle. We’re inspired by those people anyway. We’re not afraid to tackle any genre. And watching how other people work, you might be surprised the process is pretty similar, although everyone finds their own way in making and creating the music that they love.”

But the group is happiest doing their own music, and Bonerama will be performing their own songs this week in South Florida, including a show Saturday at the Funky Biscuit in Boca Raton.

Mullins said playing a room like the Funky Biscuit – or Lake Worth’s Bamboo Room, which has seen a few Bonerama shows — gives their music a completely different vibe than, perhaps, a festival date, which Bonerama plays a good deal.

“I like to look at a room before I write the set list,” Mullins said. “It’s not necessarily a small room or big room thing. But a room can affect how the show goes, and what happens inside songs. The magic stuff happens in the solo section, and depending on the room, those sections can have so much intensity. There’s a tighter energy sometimes, and you can feed off a crowd when they’re right on top of you.”

Bonerama also has a show on Friday in Miami at The Stage.
