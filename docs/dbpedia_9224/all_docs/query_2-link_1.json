        "text": "Images\n\nActivities\n\nMotivational Activity:\n\nPlease note that for this lesson, instructors will need copies of the complete lyrics to the song “School Days” by Chuck Berry.\n\nAsk students to define the word “teenager.”\n\nPoll sample answers and write them on the board.\n\nBriefly discuss:\n\nHave teenagers always existed?\n\nHow would you characterize the relationship between teenagers and adults?\n\nPlay the first 1:30 of Chuck Berry’s “School Days” (1957), which includes the first two stanzas (through “Gee but the teacher don’t know how mean she looks”).\n\nDistribute lyrics to the song.\n\nBriefly discuss:\n\nWho is the “you” in the song?\n\nWhat happens to the person in the song?\n\nWhat audience do you imagine Chuck Berry had in mind when he recorded this song in 1957? Who did he think might buy the record?\n\nWhat conclusions can you draw from this song about the influence of teenagers on popular music in the 1950s?\n\nProcedure:\n\n1. Explain to students that they will be seeing a series of images depicting teenagers before World War II and in the 1950s. For each set of images, you will ask a series of questions. Instruct students to write down their observations on Handout 1 – Comparing Images and Documents About Teenagers.\n\n2. Show Comparison 1 on the board: The first image is a photograph of a factory girl, aged 14 or 15, taken by photographer Lewis Hine in Massachusetts in 1911. The second image is of teens in Boston in the late 1940s. Discuss with students:​\n\nHow old are the people in the pictures?\n\nWhat is the girl in the first picture doing?\n\nWhat are the boys and girls in the second picture doing?\n\nWhat do you imagine the girl in the first picture does with the money she earns? Does she keep it for herself, or use it to help support her family?\n\nDo you think the boys and girls in the second picture have jobs? Why or why not? What kinds of jobs might they have?\n\nIf they do have jobs, what do you think they do with the money they earn? Do they keep it for themselves, or use it to help support their families?\n\nWhat do these images suggest about how much leisure time middle-class teenagers had in the postwar years, compared to earlier times? About how much spending money they had?\n\nAverage weekly income of a teenage boy (allowance plus job earnings)\n\n1946 1956\n\n$2.41\n\n$8.96\n\nSource: Time magazine, “Bobby-Soxers’ Gallup,” Aug. 13, 1956\n\n3. Show Comparison 2 on the board. Discuss with students:​\n\nHow much more did the average teenage boy have to spend per week in 1956 than in 1946?\n\nWhat kinds of things do you imagine the teenager in 1956 would have spent this money on?\n\nIf teenagers in this era were able to spend more money on themselves than teens in earlier times, how do you think this might have affected their relationship with their parents?\n\n4. Show Comparison 3 on the board: a Coca-Cola advertisement from 1940 and a 7-Up advertisement from 1954. Discuss with students:\n\nWho do you see in the first advertisement?\n\nWhat does the picture in the first advertisement suggest about the relationship between parents and children?\n\nWho do you see in the second advertisement? Who is no longer in the picture? What does this suggest to you about changes in family life in the 1950s?\n\nIn the first advertisement, whom is Coca-Cola trying to convince to buy its product?\n\nWho is 7-Up trying to convince to buy its product in the second advertisement?\n\nWhy do you think the advertisers changed their focus in this way between 1940 and 1954?\n\n5. Show Comparison 4 on the board: advertisements for radios from 1938 and 1959. Discuss with students:\n\nWhat is the first advertisement trying to get consumers to buy? Who is most likely going to make the decision about whether to buy it?\n\nWhat is the second advertisement trying to get consumers to buy? Who is most likely going to make the decision about whether to buy it?\n\nLook at the radio in the first advertisement. In what room in the house would it have likely been? Who do you think would have decided what programs to listen to?\n\nLook at the radio in the second advertisement. How is it different from the radio in the first ad? Where would someone be most likely to use it? Who would have decided what to play on it?\n\nWhat conclusions can you draw about how the relationship between teens and their parents changed from the 1930s to the 1950s?\n\nWhat conclusions can you draw about how teenagers might have influenced the kinds of music that was played on the radio in 1959?\n\n6. Distribute Handout 2 – An Excerpt from Life Magazine Article, published Aug. 31, 1959.\n\n7. Show photograph from the Life magazine article illustrating the kinds of goods teens purchased in the 1950s on the board.\n\n8. Have the class read the article out loud, with a new student reading each paragraph. Discuss:\n\nAccording to the article, how much money did teenagers spend in a year in 1959?\n\nGeneral Motors was the largest car manufacturer in the world at the time the article was written. How does the article say teen spending compared to the total sales of GM cars?\n\nBased on the article, what kinds of things were teens buying in this era? Would you characterize these things as necessities or luxuries?\n\nOut of that total spending, how much was spent specifically on entertainment? On records?\n\nIf you were a record company executive in 1959, how would this information influence the kinds of artists you signed contracts with and the kinds of songs you asked them to record?\n\nSummary Activity:\n\nPlay the final minute of Chuck Berry’s “School Days.” Discuss:\n\nWhat does the “you” in the song do after school?\n\nDoes the song suggest that life revolved around the home in this era? What conclusion can you draw from this about how independent teenagers were in 1957?\n\nWhat does the last verse say about Rock and Roll?\n\nWhat does the song tell you about who would have been listening to this record?\n\nWhat conclusion can you draw from this song about how important Rock and Roll was to the teenage experience in 1957?\n\nWriting Prompt:\n\nHave students write a short response reflecting on the birth of teen culture in the 1950s. Students should craft their responses as a narrative from the perspective of the teenage “you” in the song, and include details from the readings, photos, and advertisements in their descriptions of teen culture.\n\nExtensions:\n\nAsk student to reflect on today’s marketplace and teen culture and compare it to the teenage demographic of the 1950s. Questions to consider may include:\n\nOn what do teenagers today spend their money? How is that different from what teens spent money on in the 1950s? How is it similar?\n\nHow has technology affected the spending habits of teens since the 1950s?\n\nHow do teens’ tastes today influence their households’ consumption?\n\nHow does today’s music industry attract teen buyers?\n\nHow do other businesses use music to attract teenage customers?\n\nOverall, do you think teens have less, more, or the same influence over popular culture as they did in the 1950s?\n\nAsk students to investigate the relatively new marketing demographic of “tweens” and compare its influence on popular culture both to the that of teenagers today and that of teenagers in the 1950s. Research could focus on the ways music, fashion, entertainment, and other products have been marketed to all three groups.\n\nHave students research records from the 1950s and early 1960s that had the word “teen” in them. Discuss how these songs are a window onto the teenage experience of the times in which they were released.\n\nHandouts\n\nHandout 1 – Comparing Images and Documents About Teenagers Handout 2 – Excerpt from Life Magazine Article\n\nStandards\n\nNew Jersey State Standards\n\nNew Jersey State Learning Standards for English Language Arts: Reading\n\nNJSLSA.R1: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences and relevant connections from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.\n\nNJSLSA.R5: Analyze the structure of texts, including how specific sentences, paragraphs, and larger portions of the text (e.g., a section, chapter, scene, or stanza) relate to each other and the whole.\n\nNew Jersey State Learning Standards for English Language Arts: Writing\n\nNJSLSA.W3: Write narratives to develop real or imagined experiences or events using effective technique, well-chosen details, and well-structured event sequences.\n\nNew Jersey State Learning Standards for English Language Arts: Speaking and Listening\n\nNJSLSA.SL2: Integrate and evaluate information presented in diverse media and formats, including visually, quantitatively, and orally.\n\nNew York State Standards\n\nNew York State Next Generation English Language Arts Learning Standards\n\nReading Anchor Standards\n\nKey Ideas and Details\n\nStandard 1: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly/implicitly and make logical inferences from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.\n\nCraft and Structure\n\nStandard 5: Analyze the structure of texts, including how specific sentences, paragraphs, and larger portions of the text (e.g., a section, chapter, scene, or stanza) relate to each other and the whole.\n\nWriting Anchor Standards\n\nText Types and Purposes\n\nStandard 3: Write narratives to develop real or imagined experiences or events using effective techniques, well-chosen details, and well-structured event sequences.\n\nSpeaking and Listening\n\nComprehension and Collaboration\n\nStandard 2: Integrate and evaluate information presented in diverse media and formats (including visual, quantitative, and oral).\n\nNext Generation 6-12 Literacy Standards in History/Social Studies, Science, and Technical Subjects\n\nLiteracy 6-12 Anchor Standards for Reading\n\nKey Ideas and Details\n\nStandard 1: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly/implicitly and make logical inferences from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.\n\nCraft and Structure\n\nStandard 5: Analyze the structure of texts, including how specific sentences, paragraphs, and larger portions of the text (e.g., a section, chapter, scene, or stanza) relate to each other and the whole.\n\nLiteracy 6-12 Anchor Standards for Writing\n\nText Types and Purposes\n\nStandard 3: Write narratives to understand an event or topic, using effective techniques, well-chosen details, and well-structured sequences.\n\nTexas State Standards\n\nTexas Essential Knowledge and Skills for ELA & Reading\n\nMake inference about text and use textual evidence to support understanding.\n\nSummarize, paraphrase, and synthesize texts in ways that maintain meaning and logical order within a text and across texts.\n\nMake intertextual links among and across texts, including other media (e.g. film, play, music) and provide textual evidence.\n\nMake complex inference about text and use textual evidence to support understanding.\n\nTexas Essential Knowledge and Skills for Social Studies\n\nCulture: The student understands the relationship that exists between the arts and the societies in which they are produced.
