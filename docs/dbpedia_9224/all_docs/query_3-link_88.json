        "text": "Teens exist in the murky space between youth and maturity—and in decades past, when the teen babysitter was a staple of American life, adults seemed to understand that. They recognized, my colleague Faith Hill writes in a new essay, that the teen babysitter “was grown-up enough to be an extra eye in the home—but childlike enough to go looking for snacks.”\n\nFaith reports that, today, the teen babysitter has all but disappeared: Many parents now believe that kids who are 12 or 13, once a standard babysitting age, shouldn’t even be left alone at home. “People seem to worry less about adolescents and more for them, and for their future prospects,” she writes.\n\nAs Faith traces the decline of the teen babysitter, she hits on the particular nuances of adolescence. Adolescents are intelligent, reckless, ambitious, naive. And, as I wrote in this newsletter last year, everyday life experiences—eating lunch, talking to other human beings, deciding what to wear—carry tremendous emotional intensity at that age. Their stage of life defies clear categorization, but, as Faith notes, they can be capable of more than adults give them credit for.\n\nOn Adolescent Brains\n\nDon’t Tell America the Babysitter’s Dead\n\nBy Faith Hill\n\nFor decades, sitting was both a job and a rite of passage. Now it feels more like a symbol of a bygone American era.\n\nRead the article.\n\nTeen Brains Are Perfectly Capable\n\nBy Emily Underwood\n\nTeenagers have plenty of cognitive control. They just don’t always use it.\n\nRead the article.\n\nWe’re Missing a Key Driver of Teen Anxiety\n\nBy Derek Thompson\n\nA culture of obsessive student achievement and long schoolwork hours can make kids depressed.\n\nRead the article.\n\nStill Curious?\n\nOther Diversions\n\nP.S.\n\nIf you’d like to spend time with those on the cusp of adulthood for just a bit longer, I recommend my colleague Amy Weiss-Meyer’s profile of Judy Blume—or, as Amy dubs her, “the poet laureate of puberty.”\n\n— Isabel"
