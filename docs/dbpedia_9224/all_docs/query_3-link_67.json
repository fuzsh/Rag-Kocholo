        "text": "The U.S. Sur­geon General’s 2023 Social Media and Youth Men­tal Health advi­so­ry out­lines the lat­est sci­en­tif­ic evi­dence regard­ing social media’s effects on youth men­tal health. The report rec­om­mends actions that pol­i­cy­mak­ers, tech­nol­o­gy com­pa­nies, par­ents and oth­ers can take to ensure the online safe­ty of young peo­ple. This post high­lights key find­ings from the advisory.\n\nKey Take­aways\n\nTeenagers use of social media is wide­spread and pervasive.\n\nSocial media use can ben­e­fit teens, but it can also be detri­men­tal to a young user’s health, lead­ing to tech addic­tion, sleep deficits, increased lev­els of stress and more.\n\nSocial norms and expec­ta­tions, a fear of miss­ing out and a desire to con­nect with friends are some of the fac­tors fuel­ing social media among teens.\n\nFam­i­lies, tech com­pa­nies, pol­i­cy­mak­ers and oth­ers must work togeth­er to cre­ate safer and health­i­er social media envi­ron­ment for young people.\n\nKey Dri­vers of Social Media Use in Teens\n\nA num­ber of fac­tors dri­ve social media use among teens. These include:\n\nA desire to con­nect with others.\n\nA fear of miss­ing out.\n\nSocial pres­sure and expectations.\n\nHyper­con­nec­tiv­i­ty to technology.\n\nFeel­ings of stress, anx­i­ety, depres­sion or boredom.\n\nSocial media tools are, by design, filled with click-bait con­tent and acces­si­ble 24–7. These tools can elic­it a grat­i­fy­ing dopamine response in some users that can lead to psy­cho­log­i­cal crav­ings and addiction.\n\nCur­rent Lev­els of Teen Social Media Use\n\nVir­tu­al­ly all teens (95%) ages 13 to 17 use social media, with more than 1 in 3 report­ing that they use it ​“almost con­stant­ly.” While most U.S. social media plat­forms require users to be at least 13 years old, near­ly 40% of kids ages 8 to 12 use social media. The advi­so­ry also noted:\n\nAdo­les­cents who use social media more than three hours per day face twice the risk of expe­ri­enc­ing poor men­tal health outcomes.\n\nA recent sur­vey found that eighth and 10th grade stu­dents spend an aver­age of 3.5 hours per day on these platforms.\n\nHow Does Social Media Affect Teens\n\nSocial media use can affect teenagers in both pos­i­tive and neg­a­tive ways. Researchers are still eval­u­at­ing the long-term risks of social media, due to the new­ness of the tech­nol­o­gy. How­ev­er, a grow­ing body of evi­dence strong­ly links heavy social media use among teenagers to a num­ber of neg­a­tive outcomes.\n\nNeg­a­tive Psy­cho­log­i­cal Effects of Social Media on Teen Men­tal Health\n\nNumer­ous stud­ies show that high­er lev­els of social media use among chil­dren and ado­les­cents are linked to adverse effects:\n\ndepres­sion and anxiety;\n\ninad­e­quate sleep (which can dis­rupt neu­ro­log­i­cal devel­op­ment and lead to depres­sion and sui­ci­dal behaviors;\n\nlow self-esteem;\n\npoor body image;\n\neat­ing dis­or­der behav­iors; and\n\nonline harass­ment.\n\nThese risks are greater for girls ver­sus boys and for those already expe­ri­enc­ing men­tal health issues. Addi­tion­al risks include:\n\nNear­ly 2 in 3 ado­les­cents are ​“often” or ​“some­times” exposed to hate-based con­tent on social media.\n\nStud­ies have found a con­nec­tion between social media cyber­bul­ly­ing and depres­sion among young people.\n\nTeen girls and LGBTQ youth are more like­ly to expe­ri­ence cyber­bul­ly­ing and online harass­ment, which can lead to neg­a­tive emotions.\n\nBen­e­fits of Social Media on Teen Men­tal Health\n\nThere are also pros to teens using social media, such as:\n\nSocial engage­ment, includ­ing keep­ing in touch with exist­ing friends and class­mates as well as dis­cov­er­ing new con­nec­tions and net­works of mutu­al­ly shared interests.\n\nOppor­tu­ni­ties for cre­ativ­i­ty and self-expression.\n\nCivic and com­mu­ni­ty engagement.\n\nExpand­ed access to infor­ma­tion and ser­vices (for exam­ple: online therapy).\n\nSocial media use can be par­tic­u­lar­ly use­ful for con­nect­ing mar­gin­al­ized young peo­ple, such as sex­u­al and gen­der minori­ties. For instance, accord­ing to the Sur­geon General’s advi­so­ry, social media may boost the men­tal health of LGBTQ youth by:\n\nfos­ter­ing con­nec­tions with peers;\n\nfacil­i­tat­ing iden­ti­ty devel­op­ment; and\n\nenabling social support.\n\nAdo­les­cence Is a Vul­ner­a­ble Phase of Development\n\nThe mount­ing evi­dence regard­ing social media’s adverse effects on youth is espe­cial­ly con­cern­ing giv­en that ado­les­cence is a crit­i­cal peri­od of devel­op­ment, when dif­fer­ent areas of the brain begin to inte­grate and the pre­frontal cor­tex devel­ops at an accel­er­at­ed pace.\n\nIn this phase of devel­op­ment, the ado­les­cent brain is espe­cial­ly open to learn­ing and grow­ing, and teens may have inten­si­fied sen­si­tiv­i­ty to the nature of social media, accord­ing to the Sur­geon General’s advisory.\n\nAdo­les­cence also involves pro­found phys­i­o­log­i­cal changes — young peo­ple are simul­ta­ne­ous­ly nav­i­gat­ing increas­ing auton­o­my, form­ing their iden­ti­ties, devel­op­ing rela­tion­ships and more. Giv­en these fac­tors, experts warn that social media use dur­ing this vul­ner­a­ble phase war­rants par­tic­u­lar attention.\n\nSigns Social Media Use is Neg­a­tive­ly Impact­ing Your Teen\n\nThere is no set play­book to iden­ti­fy unhealthy social media use. Fac­tors to watch out for include social media use that leads a teen to:\n\nMiss out on real-world friend­ships and social­iza­tion opportunities.\n\nBecome high­ly self-crit­i­cal (often due to com­par­isons to false real­i­ties pre­sent­ed on social media).\n\nExpe­ri­ence cyberbullying.\n\nFeel increased lev­els of depres­sion, anx­i­ety, stress or isolation.\n\nStrug­gle to con­cen­trate at school or at work.\n\nFail to sleep sound­ly or get a good night’s rest.\n\nStop prac­tic­ing pos­i­tive self-care and self-reflection.\n\nHow to Pro­tect Teens on Social Media\n\nWhile social media offers ben­e­fits for some, grow­ing evi­dence of its poten­tial harm to many chil­dren and youth has led the Sur­geon Gen­er­al to issue an urgent, cross-sec­tor call to action.\n\nThe Sur­geon Gen­er­al notes that pol­i­cy­mak­ers, tech com­pa­nies, researchers, fun­ders, fam­i­lies, advo­cates and oth­ers must work togeth­er on mul­ti-pronged strate­gies to cre­ate safe and healthy social media envi­ron­ments for young peo­ple. The call to action also includes tar­get­ed guid­ance for key groups.\n\nFor Pol­i­cy­mak­ers\n\nThe Sur­geon Gen­er­al advis­es pol­i­cy­mak­ers to take steps to strength­en pro­tec­tions for chil­dren inter­act­ing with all social media plat­forms. This advice involves:\n\nDevel­op­ing age-appro­pri­ate health and safe­ty standards.\n\nRequir­ing a high­er stan­dard of data pri­va­cy for children.\n\nStrength­en­ing and enforc­ing age minimums.\n\nAddi­tion­al guid­ance to pol­i­cy­mak­ers includes:\n\nEnsur­ing tech­nol­o­gy com­pa­nies share data rel­e­vant to the health effects of their platforms.\n\nSup­port­ing increased fund­ing for future research on both the ben­e­fits and harms of social media use and oth­er tech­nol­o­gy and dig­i­tal media use for chil­dren, ado­les­cents and families.\n\nFor Tech­nol­o­gy Companies\n\nThe Sur­geon Gen­er­al’s advice to tech­nol­o­gy com­pa­nies calls for:\n\nAde­quate­ly and inde­pen­dent­ly assess­ing the impact of social media on chil­dren and adolescents.\n\nPri­or­i­tiz­ing user health and safe­ty when design­ing and devel­op­ing social media prod­ucts and services.\n\nFor­mal­iz­ing a strat­e­gy for inves­ti­gat­ing the requests and com­plaints of young peo­ple, fam­i­lies, edu­ca­tors and others.\n\nFor Par­ents and Caregivers\n\nAction items for par­ents and care­givers covers:\n\nCre­at­ing a fam­i­ly media plan with agreed-upon expec­ta­tions to estab­lish healthy social media bound­aries at home.\n\nCre­at­ing tech-free zones and encour­age in-per­son inter­ac­tions, which may involve lim­it­ing use of devices around bed­time and meal­times, pri­or­i­tiz­ing fam­i­ly rela­tion­ships and build­ing social bonds.\n\nMod­el­ing respon­si­ble social media behav­ior, as chil­dren often learn from what they see around them.\n\nLearn More About Social Media and Teen Men­tal Health\n\nRead the U.S. Sur­geon Gen­er­al’s full Social Media and Youth Men­tal Health advi­so­ry.\n\nSee the Amer­i­can Psy­cho­log­i­cal Association’s 2023 Health Advi­so­ry on Social Media Use in Ado­les­cence.\n\nLearn more about Gen Z and Men­tal Health.\n\nView this Tip Sheet on Social Media Use and Men­tal Health.\n\nAccess state and U.S. data on chil­dren and teens with anx­i­ety or depres­sion and all men­tal health data on the KIDS COUNT® Data Cen­ter."
