        "text": "There are many different categories of mental health illness, and those who struggle with any of them do not do so by choice. A variety of factors can cause or lead to the development of mental illness in teens. Mental health looks different for everyone, and the associated symptoms can make everyday, mundane tasks overwhelming and stressful.\n\nAdolescent Wellness Academy is a teen mental health treatment center in Davie, Florida. Contact us today to learn more about our teen mental health and substance abuse treatment in South Florida.\n\nDespite common misconceptions and beliefs, disorders related to mental health do not selectively target adults. Mental illness is becoming increasingly common among teenagers throughout the United States and globally. Recent studies indicate that approximately one in five teens between ages twelve and eighteen suffer from at least one diagnosable mental health disorder.\n\nA study published in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology in 2019 indicates the teen mental health crisis continues to grow. In fact, mental health professionals and medical community members have referred to the current rising trend in teens seeking (or needing) mental health treatment as an epidemic. The same study provided a few troubling facts relating to the increase in mental health issues between 2009 and 2017.\n\nA teen’s life is often thought to be more carefree and less stressful than that of adults. While their lives have their fair share of ups and downs, for the most part, teens are not saddled with the same stress-inducing responsibilities as adults. Given the pervasive nature of this thought process, it may come as a surprise to know that research has shown approximately 50% of all lifetime cases of mental illness will develop before the age of seventeen. Unfortunately, teen mental health issues are often overlooked or written off as “typical teen angst” that will go away on its own.\n\nIt is difficult to point to one singular cause responsible for the stark decline in teen mental health. The impact of various environmental, genetic, and situational factors varies depending on the person; therefore, one cause does not fit all. However, a few common factors have been found to contribute to mental health difficulties in almost every case.\n\nTeens who are struggling with the emotional difficulties brought about by mental health disorders will often turn to alcohol and drugs as a coping mechanism. This form of maladaptive self-medication often provides short-term relief but can lead to disastrous long-term impacts. In the short term, alcohol and drug use can help to mitigate the symptoms of hopelessness, anxiety, and other negative thoughts. In the longer term, chronic use begins to exacerbate these issues and often leads to addiction and dependence. In teens, experimentation often escalates to teen addiction at a much faster rate than seen in adults, and the progression from experimentation to addiction is more likely in teens with co-occurring mental health disorders. According to a study conducted in 2016, almost half of teens with a mental health disorder will be diagnosed with a co-occurring substance abuse disorder if their mental health condition is not treated.\n\nHaving a teen who is struggling with mental illness can be challenging. It is important to keep in mind there are ways to make the difficulties less disruptive to both their lives and the functioning of the family dynamic. The first thing you must do is take notice of your teen’s symptoms. This includes paying attention to changes in mood, behavior, and emotions. Seeking treatment early is essential, as mental health conditions often get worse without therapeutic intervention.\n\nOther ways to help your teen include learning all you can about their mental health condition, working with your school to ensure they receive the appropriate services, and working with your child to “find a new normal.”\n\nFinally, treatment must be a consideration. Many evidence-based medications and therapy models are used to treat mental health conditions in teens. Choosing the right combination of treatments and post-therapeutic support is essential to recovery. The best treatment choice will vary from teen to teen. Even those with the same diagnosis will have different symptoms, needs, and objectives for their treatment outcomes. Don’t let mental health disorders ruin your teenager’s future. Consider treatment opportunities at an outpatient rehab center for teens, such as the Adolescent Wellness Academy."
