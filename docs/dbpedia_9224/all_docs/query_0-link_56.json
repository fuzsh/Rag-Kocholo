        "text": "Suicide is a serious public health problem. Among youth, it exacts an enormous toll due to the significant years of potential life lost. In 2021, suicide was the second-leading cause of death among those ages 10-14 and 20-34. Rates of teen suicide have been on the rise since 2007.\n\nIn addition to those who die by suicide, many more adolescents have suicidal thoughts or attempt suicide and survive. Results from the 2021 Youth Risk Behavior Survey showed that 22% of high school students seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year and 10% attempted suicide in the past year.\n\nRisk factors associated with suicide among adolescents include:\n\nMental and behavioral health conditions such as depression, substance abuse, and personality and eating disorders, particularly when two or more conditions exist simultaneously.\n\nPrevious suicide attempts.\n\nFamily history of depression or suicide.\n\nFamily factors such as violence at home.\n\nPhysical or sexual abuse.\n\nAcademic stress, bullying or disciplinary problems at school.\n\nIn 2019, the economic burden of suicide among those younger than 25, including medical expenses and work loss were estimated at nearly $80 billion.\n\nYouth suicide is preventable. Prevention efforts can be aimed at all levels of influence: individual, relationship, community and societal. Suicide rates for at-risk youth can be substantially reduced by:\n\nKnowing the signs. Four out of 5 suicide deaths are preceded by warning signs such as suicidal threats, previous suicide attempts, depression, preoccupation or obsession with death or making final arrangements.\n\nSchools are implementing school-based mental health services. These programs help students achieve academically in addition to building social skills, self-awareness and leadership.\n\nMaking it more difficult to die in an act of deliberate self-harm. Interventions include building suicide barriers on bridges, removing guns from homes with at-risk youth and lethal means counseling.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists several strategies to prevent suicide, including:\n\nStrengthening economic support.\n\nCreating protective environments.\n\nImproving access to and delivery of suicide care and other mental health services.\n\nTeaching coping and problem-solving skills.\n\nIdentifying and supporting people at risk.\n\nFurther, Youth.gov provides several resources on preventing youth suicide. In 2022, the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline was launched to provide an easy-to-remember number for 24/7 confidential crisis support for people in distress. Services are also available via text and online chat, and the Lifeline website offers other accessibility, prevention and crisis resources as well.\n\nBarber, Catherine W., and Matthew J.
