        "text": "Overview\n\nIn the United States, teenagers drive less than all but the oldest people, but their numbers of crashes and crash deaths are disproportionately high. Using data from the National Household Travel Survey, the fatal crash rate per mile driven for 16-19 year-olds is nearly 3 times the rate for drivers ages 20 and over. Risk is highest at ages 16-17.\n\nBeginning in the mid-1990s, all states adopted graduated licensing systems, which phase in full driving privileges. National studies of graduated licensing found that strong laws were associated with substantially lower fatal crash rates and substantially lower insurance claim rates among young teen drivers covered by the laws. Strengthening restrictions on nighttime driving and teen passengers, as well as raising the licensing age, reduced rates of fatal crashes and insurance collision claims (McCartt et al., 2012; Trempel, 2009 ).\n\nThe following facts are based on analysis of data from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Fatality Analysis Reporting System.\n\nPosted June 2024.\n\nTrends\n\nA total of 2,883 teenagers ages 13-19 died in motor vehicle crashes in 2022. This is 67% fewer than in 1975 and 7% fewer than in 2021. About 2 of every 3 teenagers killed in crashes in 2022 were males. Since 1975, teenage crash deaths have decreased more among males (70%) than among females (60%).\n\nMotor vehicle crash deaths among 13-19 year-olds by sex, 1975-2022Year Male FemaleTotal* Number%Number%Number% 1975 6,532 75 2,215 25 8,748 100 1976 6,826 73 2,530 27 9,356 100 1977 6,983 72 2,650 28 9,633 100 1978 7,295 73 2,645 27 9,940 100 1979 7,280 73 2,639 27 9,920 100 1980 6,932 73 2,591 27 9,524 100 1981 6,014 72 2,301 28 8,315 100 1982 5,354 73 1,969 27 7,323 100 1983 4,850 71 1,955 29 6,805 100 1984 4,947 71 2,005 29 6,952 100 1985 4,715 70 2,022 30 6,737 100 1986 5,280 71 2,182 29 7,466 100 1987 5,107 70 2,186 30 7,293 100 1988 5,036 70 2,204 30 7,242 100 1989 4,528 68 2,158 32 6,688 100 1990 4,420 69 1,944 31 6,364 100 1991 3,891 68 1,867 32 5,760 100 1992 3,495 67 1,713 33 5,215 100 1993 3,678 68 1,742 32 5,421 100 1994 3,770 67 1,859 33 5,632 100 1995 3,702 65 1,970 35 5,675 100 1996 3,855 66 1,963 34 5,819 100 1997 3,715 65 2,014 35 5,730 100 1998 3,649 65 1,960 35 5,610 100 1999 3,745 65 2,007 35 5,752 100 2000 3,759 66 1,925 34 5,685 100 2001 3,735 67 1,859 33 5,594 100 2002 3,939 66 2,015 34 5,954 100 2003 3,772 66 1,946 34 5,718 100 2004 3,696 65 1,948 35 5,645 100 2005 3,496 66 1,803 34 5,300 100 2006 3,415 66 1,744 34 5,159 100 2007 3,280 66 1,701 34 4,981 100 2008 2,694 66 1,373 34 4,070 100 2009 2,222 64 1,257 36 3,480 100 2010 2,034 65 1,087 35 3,121 100 2011 1,991 66 1,041 34 3,033 100 2012 1,863 66 972 34 2,837 100 2013 1,661 65 880 35 2,543 100 2014 1,802 69 828 31 2,630 100 2015 1,811 66 935 34 2,747 100 2016 1,867 66 969 34 2,837 100 2017 1,829 66 933 34 2,762 100 2018 1,580 63 914 37 2,496 100 2019 1,589 66 804 34 2,394 100 2020 1,887 68 873 32 2,767 100 2021 2,074 67 1,010 33 3,090 100 2022 1,980 69 897 31 2,883 100\n\nIn 2022, teenagers accounted for 7% of motor vehicle crash deaths.

This is especially true at low and moderate blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) (Vaos et al., 2012). The estimated percentage of fatally injured passenger vehicle drivers ages 16-17 who had BACs at or above 0.08% in 2022 was 22%, down 47% since 1982. Most of this decline took place in the 1980s. This age group experienced a similar decline in alcohol involvement as drivers ages 18-20 (46%).
