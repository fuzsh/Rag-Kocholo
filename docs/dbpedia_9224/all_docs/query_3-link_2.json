        "text": "Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, American vocal group popular in the mid-1950s, prime exponents of the doo-wop vocal style. The members were Frankie Lymon (b. Sept. 30, 1942, New York, N.Y., U.S.—d. Feb. 28, 1968, New York), Herman Santiago (b. Feb. 18, 1941, New York), Jimmy Merchant (b. Feb. 10, 1940, New York), Joe Negroni (b. Sept. 9, 1940, New York—d. Sept. 5, 1978, New York), and Sherman Garnes (b. June 8, 1940, New York—d. Feb. 26, 1977, New York).\n\nThe broad-based success of this vocal ensemble helped signal the emergence of rock and roll as a part of mainstream teenage culture. The prepubescent soprano of 13-year-old lead singer Lymon, sounding innocent and girlish, represented one of the most appealing sounds in early rock and roll, and many later pop groups would feature a preteen male lead, most notably the Jackson 5. The Teenagers’ first successful record, “Why Do Fools Fall In Love” (1956), was followed by five more singles that appeared on the national survey lists of the most popular records in the United States. The Teenagers also appeared in two popular rock-and-roll movies starring disc jockey Alan Freed, Rock, Rock, Rock (1956) and Mister Rock and Roll (1957)."
