A certificate of completion will be a requirement for an Intermediate License.\n\nClick here to begin the course.\n\nWhile Learner Permits, Intermediate Licenses, and Unrestricted Licenses are not inherently REAL IDs, a REAL ID credential can be added to them at the time they are issued. If you would like to have the Real ID credential added, please bring the required Real ID documents with you to your appointment. Use the Real ID Interactive Checklist to ensure you bring the correct documents by clicking here.\n\nParent Taught Driver Education is an alternative to conventional Driver Education that is recognized by Service Oklahoma. It is offered as correspondence study through Approved Parent Taught Driver Education Providers.\n\nThe student must be at least 15 years of age in order to be eligible to start the classroom portion of the course. The student cannot start any behind-the-wheel training until they have a Learner Permit.\n\nYou can find the Parent Taught Driver Education Affidavit by clicking here. The packet will detail the process of how to get started and what actions need to be taken.\n\nPlease see the Transfer Page for information on how to transfer Learner Permits, Intermediate Licenses, and Unrestricted Licenses from another state.\n\nFor more information on transferring a Learner Permit from another country, please visit a Licensing Office."
