That equates to 43% of a teen’s waking hours.\n\nBy comparison, that’s 24 minutes more than the global average of 6 hours 58 minutes.\n\nA recent survey reveals that 47% of parents allow their children to have 3+ hours of screen time per day. While 85% of parents permit at least an hour of screen time every day.\n\nAnd those findings are corroborated by a French study, which shows that 43% of 7 to 19-year-olds clock up upwards of 3 hours of daily screen time. In total, 85% spend at least 1 hour looking at screens each day.\n\nSources: Gitnux, Nationwide Children’s, DataReportal, CivicScience, Ipsos\n\nAverage Screen Time for Teens Over Time\n\nEntertainment screen time among US teens has increased significantly in recent years.\n\nIn 2015, American 13 to 18-year-olds averaged 6 hours 40 minutes of screen time each day.\n\nThat figure rose to 7 hours 22 minutes in 2019.\n\nAnd sits at 8 hours 39 minutes as of 2021.\n\nThat means that since 2015, average screen time among teens has increased by 1 hour 59 minutes.\n\nHere’s how those figures compare to American tweens (8 to 12-year-olds):\n\nData from the UK supports this idea of increasing dependence on screens among teenagers (and indeed all age groups).\n\nThe share of 16 to 24-year-old respondents who use smartphones grew from 86% in 2012 to 98% in 2021.\n\nSources: Common Sense Media, Ofcom\n\nTeen Screen Time by Gender\n\nOn average, teenage boys spend longer looking at screens than teenage girls.\n\nTeenage girls wrack up approximately 8 hours and 2 minutes of daily screen time.\n\nWhereas teenage boys average 9 hours and 16 minutes of screen time per day.\n\nHere’s how these figures compare to tweens:\n\nSource: Common Sense Media\n\nTeen Screen Time by Activity\n\nTeenagers devote the largest proportion of their screen time to TV/videos - 3 hours 16 minutes. That’s almost 2x more than any other screen-based activity.\n\nGaming (1 hour 46 minutes) and social media (1 hour 27 minutes) make up the rest of the top three.\n\nHere’s a full breakdown of screen time split by activity among US teenagers:\n\nLooking specifically at social media, people under the age of 18 spend an average of 1 hour 47 minutes on TikTok every day.\n\nSnapchat isn’t too far behind with an average of 1 hour 12 minutes.\n\nHere’s the full list of daily social media use among children:\n\n*Data unavailable.\n\nSources: Common Sense Media, Qustodio\n\nConclusion\n\nScreen time continues to increase across the population, but it’s perhaps most alarming in teenagers.\n\nAt well over 7 hours, many teens are spending almost half of their waking hours looking at screens - a concerning statistic."
