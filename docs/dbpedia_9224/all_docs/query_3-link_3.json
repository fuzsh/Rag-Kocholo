He told him if he looked in the camera one more time he was fired. I then grabbed his arm and said look if you are fired so am I because you are my dance partner and I want to finish this movie so when the camera comes my way look at me okay. so the camera came our way I grabbed his arm and yanked him down a bit and he looked down at me and smiled. Oh and the actress was a complete brat I hated the way she acted and the way she treated everyone talk about a non diva thinking she is LOL"
