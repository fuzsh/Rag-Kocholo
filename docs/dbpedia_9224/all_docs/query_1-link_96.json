        "text": "Teenage dating can be confusing for parents. Your child might not even wait for the teenage years before they ask you if they can âgo outâ with someone. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, kids start dating at an average age of 12 and a half for girls and 13 and a half for boys.\n\nEvery teen â or preteen â is different, though, and your child might be ready sooner or later than their peers.\n\nTalking to Your Teen About Dating\n\nIf your child has started to bring up dating, start by figuring out what they mean by âdating.â When a 12- or 13-year-old talks about a budding relationship with someone, they might mean anything from texting back and forth with a crush to a group movie outing including the crush and other friends.\n\nYounger teens are more likely to date in a cluster, rather than one-on-one. Itâs part of the natural transition from same-gender social groups to coed groups and finally to one-on-one dating. Co-ed groups let kids experiment with dating behaviors in a safer setting with less pressure.\n\nTalk to your teen or preteen about what dating or going out entails in their friend group. You need to know what they want to do before you decide whether youâre comfortable with it.\n\nWhen Is Your Teen Ready to Date âSoloâ?\n\nEventually, teens are ready to make the move and start going on what an adult would recognize as a date. Some pediatricians suggest that kids wait until theyâre 16 to start this kind of one-on-one dating.Â\n\nThatâs a good place to start the discussion, but every kid is different. Some are more emotionally mature than others. Some teens come from communities and families where one-on-one dating starts earlier or later.Â\n\nThe best thing is to talk about one-on-one dating before it becomes a possibility. If your 13-year-old is âhanging outâ with someone â teen talk for casual dating without a commitment â itâs not too early to start talking about dating rules.\n\nSetting the Rules\n\nDonât feel like if you set rules about dating, youâre infringing on your teenâs independence. Research has shown many times that teens thrive when loving parents set and enforce clear limits.\n\nExperts say that itâs best to set rules as a family â with your teenâs involvement. Talk about what your family thinks is the right age to start dating one-on-one and why. Ask your teen if they feel ready to date.\n\nAlso, take this time to talk about other rules around your teen dating. That includes what kinds of places the couple can go and what time you need your teen to be home. Keep in mind that some counties have curfews for minors, and those curfews can vary based on age and whether itâs a school night.\n\nAlways talk with your teen about why the rules are what they are. This tells them that you believe in their ability to make responsible, informed decisions.\n\nKeeping Your Teen Safe\n\nParents naturally hope that the worst a teen will experience in the dating scene is temporary heartbreak, but thatâs not always the case.Â\n\nDating violence. Violence in teen dating relationships is more common than many people know.\n\n33% of American teenagers experience sexual, physical, emotional, or verbal abuse from a date\n\n1.5 million high schoolers reported suffering physical harm by a romantic partner within a year\n\n25% of high school girls in the US have experienced physical or sexual abuse\n\nOnly a third of teens in abusive relationships tell someone about the violence. Parents need to watch out for warning signs. Watch out for signs that your teenâs partner:\n\nTries to control their friendships and activities\n\nInsults them or puts them down\n\nGets angry easily\n\nDating abuse is confusing and scary for anyone, but teens havenât had much experience with relationships and might not know what a healthy relationship looks like.Â\n\nTeens might not know how to bring up possible dating abuse to an adult. If youâre worried, ask your teen if theyâre being hurt or if they feel safe. It can open an important discussion. No matter whatâs going on with your teenâs relationships, take their feelings seriously. You may know as an adult that young love doesnât last, but it can mean a lot to your child."
