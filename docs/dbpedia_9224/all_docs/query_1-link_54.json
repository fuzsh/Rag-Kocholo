Specifically, 37% of teens say they spend 5 or more hours a day, 14% spend 4 to less than 5 hours a day, 26% spend 2 to less than 4 hours a day, and 23% spend less than 2 hours a day on these three apps.\n\n[Related: Potential risks of content, features, and functions: The science of how social media affects youth]\n\n60%\n\nPercentage of the highest frequency social media users who report low parental monitoring and weak parental relationships who said they had poor or very poor mental health, compared with 25% of the highest frequency users who report high parental monitoring and strong parental relationships. Similarly, 22% of the highest users with poor parental relationships and monitoring expressed thoughts of suicide or self-harm compared with 2% of high users with strong parental relationships and monitoring.\n\nStrong parental relationships and monitoring significantly cut the risk of mental health problems among teen social media users, even among those with significant screen time stats."
