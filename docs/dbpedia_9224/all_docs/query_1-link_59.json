        "text": "Key Takeaways\n\nTeens need 8-10 hours of sleep per night for their well-being.\n\nTeens often have a natural tendency to stay up late due to their changing biological clocks.\n\nObligations like early school start times, homework, extracurriculars, and social activities can make it hard for teens to get enough sleep.\n\nGood sleep hygiene, limited screen time, reduced caffeine, and a consistent sleep routine can help improve teen sleep quality.\n\nSleep is essential for teenagers because it plays an important role in their physical and mental development. Most teens should get between 8 and 10 hours of sleep per night. Unfortunately, research indicates that many teens get far less sleep than they need.\n\nTeens face numerous challenges to getting consistent, restorative sleep. Recognizing those challenges helps teens and their caregivers make a plan so that teens get the sleep they need.\n\nHow Many Hours of Sleep Does a Teenager Need?\n\nExperts recommend that teens between the ages of 13 and 18 get 8 to 10 hours of sleep per night. But this recommendation changes for preteens and adult teenagers Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source .\n\nEvery teenager is different, though, and some teens need more than the recommended amount of sleep per night while others may require less.\n\nWhy Is Sleep Important for Teens?\n\nSleep is vital for people of any age. But especially in teens, profound mental, physical, social, and emotional development requires quality sleep.\n\nThinking and Academic Achievement\n\nSleep benefits the brain and promotes attention, memory, and analytical thought. It makes thinking sharper, recognizing the most important information to consolidate learning. Sleep also facilitates expansive thinking Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source that can spur creativity. Whether studying for a test, learning an instrument, or acquiring job skills, sleep is essential for teens.\n\nGiven the importance of sleep for brain function, it is easy to see why teens who do not get enough sleep tend to suffer from excessive drowsiness and lack of attention Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source that can harm their academic performance.\n\nEmotional Health\n\nMost people have experienced how lack of sleep can affect mood, causing irritability and exaggerated emotional reactions. Over time, the consequences can be even greater for teens who are adapting to more independence, responsibility, and new social relationships.\n\nProlonged sleep loss may negatively affect emotional development Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source , increasing risks for interpersonal conflict as well as more serious mental health problems.\n\nSleep-deprived teens are more likely to report Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Improving sleep in adolescents may play a role in preventing and managing these mental health conditions.\n\nPhysical Health and Development\n\nSleep contributes to the effective function of virtually every system of the body. It empowers the immune system, helps regulate hormones, and enables muscle and tissue recovery.\n\nSubstantial physical development happens during adolescence, which can be negatively affected by a lack of sleep. For example, researchers have found that adolescents who fail to get enough sleep have a troubling metabolic profile Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source , evaluated through blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other factors. These findings may put them at higher risk of diabetes and long-term cardiovascular problems.\n\nDecision-Making and Risky Behavior\n\nSleep deprivation can affect the development of the frontal lobe, a part of the brain that is critical to control impulsive behavior. Not surprisingly, numerous studies have found that teens who do not get enough sleep are more likely to engage in high-risk behaviors Trusted Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) As the nation’s health protection agency, CDC saves lives and protects people from health threats. View Source like drunk driving, texting while driving, riding a bicycle without a helmet, and failing to use a seatbelt. Drug and alcohol use, smoking, risky sexual behavior, fighting, and carrying a weapon are also more common Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source in teens who get too little sleep.\n\nBehavioral problems can have widespread effects on a teenager’s life, putting their safety in jeopardy, harming their academic performance, and sometimes damaging their relationships with family and friends.\n\nAccidents and Injuries\n\nInsufficient sleep in teens can make them prone to accidental injury and even death. Of particular concern is an elevated risk of accidents as a result of drowsy driving. Studies have found that sleep deprivation can reduce reaction times with an effect similar to that of significant alcohol consumption. In teens, the impact of drowsy driving can be amplified by a lack of driving experience and a higher rate of distracted driving.\n\nAre Teens in America Getting Enough Sleep?\n\nBy almost all accounts, many teenagers in America are not getting the recommended 8 to 10 hours of sleep per night. Around 6 out of 10 middle schoolers and 7 out of 10 high schoolers do not get enough sleep Trusted Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC is the nation’s leading science-based, data-driven, service organization that protects the public’s health. View Source on school nights.\n\nInsufficient sleep has been found to be higher among girls and people assigned female at birth. Older teens report getting less sleep than younger adolescents. Surveys have also found that teens who identify as Black, Asian, or multiracial have the highest rates of sleeping less than eight hours per night.\n\nWhy Is It Hard for Teens to Get Good Sleep?\n\nThere is not one specific reason for sleep insufficiency among teens. Instead, several factors contribute to this problem, and these factors may vary from teenager to teenager.\n\nDelayed Sleep Schedule and School Start Times\n\nAdolescents develop a strong tendency toward being a “night owl,” staying up later at night and sleeping longer into the morning. Experts believe this is a two-fold biological impulse affecting the circadian rhythm and sleep-wake cycle of teens.\n\nFirst, teens have a sleep drive that builds more slowly, which means they do not start to feel tired until later in the evening. Second, the body starts producing melatonin later in the day, which is the hormone that helps promote sleep.\n\nIf allowed to sleep on their own schedule, many teens would get eight hours or more per night, sleeping from 11 p.m. or midnight until 8 a.m. or 9 a.m., but school start times in most school districts force teens to wake up much earlier in the morning. Because of the biological delay in their sleep-wake cycle, many teens simply are not able to fall asleep early enough to get eight or more hours of sleep and still arrive at school on time.\n\nWith reduced sleep on weekdays, teens may try to catch up by sleeping in on the weekend, but this can exacerbate their delayed sleep schedule and inconsistent nightly rest.\n\nTime Demands\n\nMany teenagers have a jam-packed weekly schedule. School assignments, work obligations, household chores, social life, community activities, and sports are just some of the things that can require their time and attention.\n\nWith so much to try to fit into each day, many teens do not allocate sufficient time for sleep. They may stay up late during the week to finish homework or during the weekend when hanging out with friends, both of which can reinforce their night owl schedule.\n\nAdditionally, pressure to succeed while managing these extensive commitments can be stressful, and stress has been known to contribute to sleeping problems and insomnia.\n\nUse of Electronic Devices\n\nElectronic devices like cell phones and tablets are ubiquitous, and research has found that 89% or more Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source of teens keep at least one device in their bedroom at night.\n\nScreen time late into the evening can contribute to sleeping problems. Using these devices can be stimulating, and incoming notifications can disrupt sleep. Evidence also points to suppressed melatonin production from exposure to the light from smartphones.\n\nSleep Disorders\n\nSome teens have poor sleep because of an underlying sleep disorder. Adolescents can be affected by obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which causes repeated pauses in breathing during sleep. OSA frequently causes fragmented sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness.\n\nThough less common, teens can have sleep disorders like restless legs syndrome, which involves a strong urge to move the limbs when lying down, or narcolepsy, which is a disorder affecting the sleep-wake cycle.\n\nMental Health Conditions\n\nMental health conditions like anxiety and depression can be a challenge to quality sleep in teens as well as adults. Insufficient sleep can contribute to these conditions as well, creating a bidirectional relationship that can worsen both sleep and emotional wellness.\n\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\n\nNeurodevelopmental disorders, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source , can make it harder for teens to sleep well. Lack of sleep may also contribute to more pronounced symptoms of these conditions.\n\nHow Can Teens Get Better Sleep?\n\nTeens who are having sleep problems should start by talking with their doctor about how much sleep they are getting and how it impacts their daily life. Their pediatrician can work to identify any underlying causes and craft the most appropriate and tailored treatment.\n\nDepending on the cause of sleep problems, medications may be considered; however, in most cases, treatment with medications isn’t necessary for teens to get better sleep.\n\nA beneficial step is for teens to review and improve their sleep hygiene, which includes their sleep environment and habits. Some healthy sleep tips that can help in this process include:\n\nBudgeting eight hours of sleep into your daily schedule and keeping that same schedule on both weekdays and weekends.\n\nCreating a consistent pre-bed routine to help with relaxation and falling asleep fast.\n\nAvoiding caffeine and energy drinks, especially in the afternoon and evening.\n\nPutting away electronic devices for at least a half-hour before bed and keeping them on silent mode to avoid checking them during the night.\n\nSetting up your bed with a supportive mattress that’s the best mattress for you. And don’t forget to bring your best pillow.\n\nKeeping your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet.\n\nSleep hygiene modifications may be included in cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), a form of talk therapy for sleeping problems that has demonstrated effectiveness in adults and may be helpful to teens. CBT-I works by reshaping negative ideas and thoughts about sleep and implementing practical steps for better sleep routines.\n\nHow Can Parents Help Teens Get Better Sleep?\n\nFor many parents and caregivers, a first step is asking their teenage children about their sleep. Encourage teens to see a doctor while also working with them to make gradual sleep hygiene improvements. Some research has found that teens whose parents set a firm bedtime get more sleep and have less daytime drowsiness Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source .\n\nAnother avenue for caregivers is advocating for later school start times with their local school district. A number of districts have delayed school start times and seen benefits Trusted Source American Psychological Association (APA) APA is the leading scientific and professional organization representing psychology in the United States, with more than 121,000 researchers, educators, clinicians, consultants and students as its members. View Source such as increased attendance, improved academic performances, and fewer car accidents involving students.\n\nParents and caregivers can also work with their teens to avoid overscheduling and balance commitments that can generate stress with maintaining adequate time for sleep."
