destructive behavior appear to take place among older teens and young adults.\n\n2.08 million or 8.33% of 12- to 17-year-olds nationwide report using drugs in the last month.\n\nAmong them, 83.88%

the criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) in the last year.\n\nYouth Drug Abuse\n\nYouth drug abuse trends may provide clues about the future public health as well as the efficacy of educational
