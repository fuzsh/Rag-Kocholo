        "text": "Content warning: Suicide, gun violence\n\nAsk any one of the millions of preteen and teenage students heading back to school and they’ll confirm: The stresses of school in 2024 extend far beyond class schedules, homework, and a lack of time with friends.\n\nIn fact, things are so stressful that the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and Children’s Hospital Association have declared a national state of emergency in children’s mental health. This was echoed by the extensive 2021 U.S. Surgeon General’s report, Protecting Youth Mental Health. This Advisory noted that rates of depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness and suicide have been skyrocketing long before the COVID pandemic.\n\nIn May 2023, the U.S. Surgeon General released an Advisory indicating that we are amid a loneliness epidemic and the largest sector of the population affected are Gen Z youth, ages 16 to 24. This has been increasing consistently since 1976 and 2019.\n\n“Preteens and teenagers are in a perfect storm,” explains Gene Beresin, MD, MA, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at Mass General Brigham. “They are worried about their future and are concerned about mass shootings, gun control, climate change, economic instability, sexual assaults, marginalization of people of color, immigrants, and LGBTQ individuals, war in Ukraine and the Middle East, and a seriously polarization of our population with difficulty if not inability to have civilized conversations and resolve conflict. In short, many feel deep anger, depression, and anxiety about the world they are inheriting.”\n\nDr. Beresin is the executive director of the Clay Center for Young Healthy Minds at Massachusetts General Hospital. Dr. Beresin holds over 40 years of experience working with youth, with a particular focus on prevention, early intervention, and treatment for teens and young adults. In this article, Dr. Beresin discusses back-to-school stress, shares the best coping skills for teens and preteens to use in times of stress, and explores ways parents and guardians can help.\n\nHow does loneliness affect young people?\n\nLoneliness has a devastating impact on young people, including:\n\nIncreases in mental health disorders (depression, anxiety and suicide)\n\nSleep deprivation\n\nInability to self-regulate emotions and behavior\n\nIncreases in medical illnesses\n\nWeakened immune system\n\nOver-eating\n\nMisuse of substances\n\nWhat causes loneliness in teens?\n\nIts potential causes (though we do not know for sure which are most important) include: loss or detachment from a loved one or friends; overuse and misuse of social media, and possibly of greatest importance is that preteens and teens today are overscheduled. They are pressured to perform in academics, sports, community service, internships, play a musical instrument, and much more — in fact, they are booked solid 24/7, 7 days a week.\n\nTeens need time to hang out with each other, to process their social and emotional experiences, and to have the space to develop a personal and social identity. Ways to help loneliness are noted below.\n\nSocial media and mental health: Cyberbullying and other potential harms\n\nMost recently, the U.S. Surgeon General released a new Advisory on Social Media and Mental Health in youth. While there are potential benefits of social media for some young people, there are clear dangers that require further research.\n\nIt is one more constant pressure they feel that derails them from developmental goals, and is potentially harmful for their identity, self-image, self-esteem and isolation from others in real time. Moreover cyberbullying is a clear and present danger, and may have life-long impact.\n\nUncertainty about the future\n\nAnother major stress factor is the significant concern our preteens, teens and young adults have about their future. They are living in an age of uncertainty."
