        "text": "Even though teenagers are less likely to suffer severe illness from COVID-19, the safety precautions had adverse outcomes. Three out of four parents said COVID hurt their children’s social interactions, and 46% of teens showed signs of a new or worsening mental health condition during the pandemic, according to the University of Michigan.\n\nHelping Teens Navigate Social Issues\n\nAs a parent, taking a fresh look at current problems teenagers face will help you lookout for concerns before they become a serious issues. Here are the top 12 teen social issues parents should be aware of and how you can help.\n\n1. Anxiety\n\nHigh expectations and pressure from parents to succeed are causing our teens problems. New technology allows parents to monitor their teens 24 hours a day. Tracking your teen’s location, driving skills, and grades may provide you with peace of mind, but it’s stressing your teen.\n\nHow to Help. Give your child a responsible amount of independence and the ability to make mistakes to teach them the skills they need to cope with stress.\n\n2. Stress\n\nHigh expectations and pressure from parents to succeed are causing our teens problems. New technology allows parents to monitor their teens 24 hours a day. Tracking your teen’s location, driving skills, and grades may provide you with peace of mind, but it’s stressing your teen.\n\nHow to Help. Give your child a responsible amount of independence and the ability to make mistakes to teach them the skills they need to cope with stress.\n\n3. Depression\n\nSuicide is the fourth leading cause of death for teens. Current events, including the war in Ukraine and mass shootings, are making kids more vulnerable to depression.\n\nHow to Help. Be on the lookout for signs of depression. Don’t hesitate to seek professional help for your teen.\n\n4. Social Media\n\nA study from Common Sense Media revealed teenagers spent an average of 87 minutes every day on social media. While social media keeps teens connected during remote learning, it can expose them to cyberbullying and negatively impact their friendships and mental health.\n\nHow to Help. Talk to your children about healthy ways to use social media and take steps to limit screen time. Make your teen take a break from their phone at least one hour before bed.\n\n5. Bullying\n\nAs mask guidelines expire, teens are accusing their peers of wearing masks to hide their appearance. “Mask fishing” is just the latest in the long list of ways teens face bullying.\n\nHow to Help. Be on the lookout for warning signs, such as increased isolation, irritability, and difficulty sleeping. Help your child problem-solve the issue and get school administration involved if it continues.\n\n6. Eating Disorders\n\nThe National Eating Disorders Association helpline saw a 40% jump in calls in the first year of COVID. Propelled by unrealistic expectations on social media and the entertainment industry, eating disorders continue to be a problem for many teens, especially females.\n\nHow to Help. Be a good role model and have conversations about how the media distorts the perception of beauty.\n\n7. Peer Pressure\n\nNegative peer pressure can lead to underage drinking, drug abuse, and teen pregnancy.\n\nHow to Help. Teach your teen effective exit strategies and get to know their friends to assess risk.\n\n8. Desensitization\n\nMany parents relaxed screen time rules during the pandemic to enable them to telework effectively. Kids are exposed to copious amounts of violence in video games, social media, movies, and the news. Desensitization can decrease a teen’s ability to empathize and increase aggression.\n\nHow to Help. Resume screen time limits and find teachable moments to talk to your kids about violence in the media.\n\n9. Poverty\n\nCOVID created economic hardships for many families. The Pew Research Center reported four in 10 kids say poverty is a problem among their peers.\n\nHow to Help. Volunteer with your teen. Doing good will give them a sense of purpose and allow them to help their peers who are suffering.\n\n10. Low Motivation\n\nNavigating the new normal can be difficult for teens, including finding that motivation for academics and sports again.\n\nHow to Help. Encourage your teen to set small achievable goals to help them reach their ultimate objective.\n\n11. Drug Addiction\n\nDespite being at the lowest level since 1975, 32% of high school seniors reported using drugs in 2021.\n\nHow to Help. Talk to them about the perils of illicit drugs and the dangers of abusing prescription medication. Establish clear rules and make sure they understand the consequences.\n\n12. Drinking Alcohol\n\nUnderage drinking continues to be one of the top problems teenagers face. According to the Journal for Adolescent Health, while the prevalence of teens who abuse alcohol is down, many parents relaxed their no-tolerance drinking rules during the pandemic. Underage drinking can lead to mental health issues and affect the still-developing brain.\n\nHow to Help. Arm yourself with underage drinking facts and start the conversation with your teen about the dangers of underage drinking. Talking regularly about underage drinking is the best way to prevent it.\n\nTake the Pledge Today"
