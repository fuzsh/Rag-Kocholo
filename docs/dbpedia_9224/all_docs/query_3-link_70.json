        "text": "Adolescence is the developmental transition to adulthood that includes rapid changes in the brain and body, often at different rates and is a time for healthy exploration of identity and learning independence. It can also be a stressful or challenging for teens because of these rapid changes.\n\nAlthough every adult has gone through puberty and has personal experience with this transition, it is still important to understand the different types of changes occurring physically and psychologically during adolescence. The following overview covers the major types of development, the related changes, and common challenges that may result.\n\nThese TAG Talks address different topics related to adolescent development and learning more about what is most helpful to youth experiencing this transition:\n\nThe Power of the Adolescent Brain: This video uses research to shine a light on adolescent brain development and explores what researchers have discovered about adolescent brain development, functioning, and capacity and provides practical suggestions for practitioners and families with adolescents.\n\nThe Changing Transition to Adulthood: This video is about the transition to adulthood today, how it has changed over time, what skills and capacities are helpful for youth, and the roles of families, education, and employment in the process.\n\nAdolescent-Centered Healthcare – The Mount Sinai Model: This video is about the growing understanding that adolescents and young adults need healthcare that is geared specifically to their needs and is distinct from services provided to adults or young children.\n\nAdolescent Substance Use, Addiction, and Treatment: This video is about addressing substance use and addiction in adolescents and young adults and the most effective approaches to treating addiction, including opioid addiction.\n\nThe Crisis of Connection for Adolescent Boys: This video explores the crisis of connection, its impact on the health and well-being of adolescent boys, and the implications for supporting teens.\n\nPhysical Development\n\nCognitive Development\n\nPsychosocial Development\n\nResources\n\nThe Promise of Adolescence: Realizing Opportunity for All Youth\n\nThis report examines the neurobiological and socio-behavioral science of adolescent development and outlines how this knowledge can be applied, both to promote adolescent well-being, resilience, and development, and to rectify structural barriers and inequalities in opportunity, enabling all adolescents to flourish. The report focuses on leveraging the developmental opportunities to harness the promise of adolescence—rather than focusing myopically on containing its risks. In addition to discussing adolescent development and the impact of inequality and injustice, accompanying resources include a communication toolkit, commissioned papers, and a video series in English and Spanish with recommendations for the education, justice, child welfare, and health care systems.\n\nAdolescent Development Explained\n\nThis webpage from the Office of Population Affairs examines the major developmental changes that occur in adolescence and provides suggestions on how parents and caring adults can support young people as they navigate through this critical period.\n\nYouth Risk Behavior Survey: Data Summary and Trends Report 2007-2017\n\nThis report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Division of Adolescent and School Health (DASH) provides data summary and trend information on varying topics, including sexual behavior, high-risk substance use, violence victimization, mental health and suicide, and minority youth.\n\nBullying and Pediatricians\n\nThis fact sheet from StopBullying.gov explains how pediatricians and healthcare providers are important allies to help determine if a child is being bullied. They can alert parents to the signs of bullying and how it may impact a child’s health, and can provide resources for intervention, relief, and healing.\n\nIntegrated Healthcare\n\nThis research summary from StopBullying.gov describes how psychosocial matters, including bullying, can be addressed during adolescent well-care visits, annual school physicals, sports physicals, and acute care.\n\nPhysical Activity Guidelines for School-Aged Children and Adolescents\n\nThis second edition of the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, issued by the US Department of Health and Human Services, provides guidelines for physical activity for school-aged children and adolescents.\n\nNational Youth Sports Strategy\n\nThis webpage provides details on the National Youth Sports Strategy, which is an essential resource for policymakers and key decision-makers in youth sports. It aims to unite U.S. youth sports culture around a shared vision: that one day, all young people will have the opportunity, motivation, and access to play sports — regardless of their race, ethnicity, sex, ability, or ZIP code.\n\nEating Disorders\n\nThis health topic page from the National Institute of Mental Health provides comprehensive information on eating disorders, including risk factors, types of treatment, and other resources."
