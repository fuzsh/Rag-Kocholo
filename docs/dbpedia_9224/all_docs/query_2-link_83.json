        "text": "JUDY WOODRUFF:\n\nBut first: International tests are one way of gauging how American kids are doing in school compared with other countries.\n\nTraditionally, the U.S. performance has been described as mediocre, and this year was no different. The most recent test scores show the U.S. is stagnant in reading and science. In math, our country ranks toward the bottom of developed nations.\n\nWhat these results tell us about educational priorities around the world is a bit more nuanced.\n\nSpecial correspondent Kavitha Cardoza with our partner Education Week met with international students to ask them first-hand about the differences.\n\nIt's part of our weekly series Making the Grade.\n\nKAVITHA CARDOZA:\n\nTwo years ago, Calvin and his family moved to the U.S. because of his father's work. His mother Margaret, says if he was still living in his home country, Hong Kong, just like his former classmates, Calvin would have had to give up soccer.\n\nMARGARET TSANG, Parent from Hong Kong: Calvin's friends in Hong Kong have to give up playing soccer because they have to focus and concentrate in their studying.\n\nKAVITHA CARDOZA:\n\nHong Kong is also known for being a place that does very well on international tests, unlike the U.S., where the academic performance this year was lackluster.\n\nThe U.S. ranks in the middle of the pack when it comes to reading and science. In math, it ranked 31st out of 35 countries.\n\nThe PISA test is taken every three years by 15-year-olds from dozens of countries. What makes this test interesting is that it doesn't gauge what students can memorize, in other words, what you can Google. The PISA test looks to see what students can do with what they know.\n\nKAVITHA CARDOZA:\n\nAndreas Schleicher oversees the PISA test. He says the school systems of today are the economies of tomorrow.\n\nANDREAS SCHLEICHER, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development: You look at a country like Korea in the 1960s. Korea had the level of the economic development of Afghanistan today, one of the least developed education systems. But it got education right. It became one of its most successful economies. The power of education to transform societies and generate both economic and social outcomes is just tremendous.\n\nKAVITHA CARDOZA:\n\nEconomic prosperity, international competitiveness, national security, those are a few of the reasons countries take education and, by extension, these rankings so seriously.\n\nAs President Obama said back in 2009, countries that out-educate us will outperform us.\n\nThe U.S. spends markedly more money compared to other developed countries on education, but, by high school, American students fall behind. Schleicher says it's not about how much a country spends on education, but how it spends the money. He says, in other countries, it's all about teacher quality.\n\nJOHN KING:\n\nSure, we have to be cautious about these results. At the same time, we can look at a country like Canada that's had a very large influx of immigrants over the last few years and is doing better.\n\nWe can look at countries around the world like Poland, which is a country that has significant population of low-income students, and yet they have made a lot of progress over the last decade. And we should ask why.\n\nKAVITHA CARDOZA:\n\nAnd that's part of the problem, says Tom Loveless with the Brookings Institution. He says homecoming, prom, rallies may help teach teamwork and creativity, but don't improve academics. He says we need to look at the role culture plays in reinforcing education.\n\nLoveless surveyed almost 400 foreign exchange students who spent a year in an American high school, and asked them about the relative importance given to math and sports.\n\nTOM LOVELESS:\n\nI asked them, among your friends, among your peer groups, how important is it to be successful at mathematics?\n\nAnd they said, well â€” the foreign exchanges said, well, back home, it's fairly important whether or not you're good at mathematics. In the United States, not so much.\n\nAnd then I asked them about sports. How important is it to be a good athlete?\n\nAnd with both boys and girls, and no matter from what country they came from, they said, in the United States, the emphasis on being a good athlete was much more important in the United States than back with their peer groups in their home country."
