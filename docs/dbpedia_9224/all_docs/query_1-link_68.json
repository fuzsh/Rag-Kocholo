        "text": "Polaris Residential Treatment Centers For Teens\n\nA Safe Haven for Recovery\n\nPolaris was created by a team of mental health professionals whose life’s work is to help young people and their families. As a highly focused teen treatment center, we identify the unique qualities of your child and adjust to their needs.\n\nJoint Commission Accredited\n\nThe teen years are an especially vulnerable time for young people.\n\nThe formation of identity begins as we bridge the gap between childhood and adulthood. Adolescents with psychological, behavioral health, and mental health concerns may think, feel and act in ways that are confusing, frightening, and unmanageable for both their parents and themselves.\n\nA breakdown in family communication and functioning can lead to a sense of despair and hopelessness. There is hope. Our Residential Treatment Centers for Teens provide proven, evidence-based care that addresses these complexities, reuniting families in the process.\n\nThe Polaris difference\n\nAt Polaris, our team believes in a different approach to recovery. We address teenage mental health disorders in a unique, mindful way; allowing adolescents to confidently begin the journey into the next chapter of their lives.\n\nRecovery, healing & growth\n\nResidential Program\n\nAbout us\n\nExpert Team\n\nMeet the team behind Polaris.\n\nAdmissions\n\nGet Started\n\nTo determine eligibility, our experienced team of intake professionals will conduct an in-depth interview and thorough evaluation.\n\nOur Mission & purpose\n\nOur mission is to provide the best possible treatment for your son or daughter. Teen mental health issues can be caused by a variety of factors: trauma, biological predisposition, environmental factors at home or in school, and so forth. We deeply understand the need for a thorough clinical evaluation and personalized treatment planning to ensure a successful long-term impact.\n\nOur clinically trained staff treats the whole person using customized, tailored strategies for teens struggling with depression, anxiety, bipolar and other mood disorders. We also treat subsequent secondary destructive behaviors like self-harm, substance abuse, and eating disorders.\n\nWhat We Treat\n\nMental health can be complex. Polaris treats a multitude of primary and co-occurring mental health conditions and can facilitate psychological testing for diagnostic clarification.\n\nMental Health Primary Diagnosis\n\nMajor Depressive Disorder\n\nPolaris uses a variety of both evidenced-based and cutting-edge treatment models to effectively alleviate depressive symptoms and support your child in developing successful coping strategies that they will be able to use long after they leave Polaris. With the proper mental health treatment, teens who are depressed can get better.\n\nAnxiety & Panic\n\nTeen anxiety is a common mental health struggle caused by constant worrying, stress, and fear. And while anxiety affects people of all ages, teenagers struggle with it the most.\n\nPost Traumatic Stress\n\nPost Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) can significantly impact a teen’s daily life, often resulting from a traumatic event or series of events. Polaris offers a compassionate and secure environment where teens with PTSD can receive evidence-based treatments tailored to their specific needs. Our goal is to help them manage their symptoms and develop resilience, ensuring they can lead a fulfilling life beyond their time with us.\n\nBipolar I/II\n\nPolaris provides a loving, safe environment to help manage all types of bipolar disorders. With support from experienced professionals, your teen will receive specialized care to ensure long-term impact.\n\nAutism Spectrum Disorder\n\nAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) presents unique challenges that require specialized approaches. At Polaris, we utilize both proven and innovative treatment models to support teens with ASD. Our dedicated professionals work to enhance their social, communication, and behavioral skills, empowering them to thrive in various aspects of life. With the right support, teens with ASD can achieve significant progress.\n\nObsessive Compulsive Disorder\n\nObsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) can be overwhelming, causing distressing thoughts and repetitive behaviors. Polaris offers a nurturing and structured environment where teens with OCD can access effective treatments. Our experienced team focuses on helping them manage their symptoms and develop healthier coping mechanisms, fostering long-term improvement and well-being.\n\nCo-occurring Diagnosis\n\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder\n\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) can challenge a teen’s ability to focus, control impulses, and manage daily tasks. At Polaris, we offer a supportive environment and evidence-based treatments designed to help teens with ADHD thrive. Our dedicated professionals work on enhancing their attention, organization, and coping skills, ensuring long-term success.\n\nGender Dysphoria\n\nGender Dysphoria can deeply affect a teen’s emotional well-being and sense of identity. Polaris provides a safe, inclusive space where teens can explore their gender identity with the support of experienced professionals. Our personalized treatment plans aim to alleviate distress and promote self-acceptance, helping teens lead fulfilling lives.\n\nSpecific Learning Disorder\n\nSpecific Learning Disorders can make academic achievement and daily functioning more challenging for teens. At Polaris, we employ specialized and innovative treatment approaches to support teens in overcoming these obstacles. Our team focuses on enhancing their learning strategies and building confidence, enabling them to reach their full potential.\n\nEating Disorder\n\nBody Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) involves an obsessive focus on perceived flaws in appearance, causing significant distress. Polaris provides a compassionate environment where teens with BDD can receive targeted treatments. Our experienced professionals help them develop healthier self-perceptions and coping strategies, fostering long-term improvement.\n\nAttachment Related Disorder\n\nAttachment Related Disorders can impact a teen’s ability to form healthy relationships and manage emotions. Our treatment programs aim to address the underlying issues and build strong, positive attachment patterns, promoting emotional stability and healthy relationships.\n\nSecondary Behaviors\n\nNonsuicidal Self Injury (NSSI)\n\nNonsuicidal Self Injury (NSSI) involves self-harm behaviors that can be a coping mechanism for overwhelming emotions. With our experienced, compassionate professionals, we at Polaris help teens develop healthier coping strategies and emotional regulation skills to address the underlying causes of NSSI.\n\nSchool Avoidance\n\nSchool Avoidance can significantly disrupt a teen’s academic and social development. At Polaris, we work to identify the root causes and develop strategies to re-engage them in their education, ensuring long-term academic success.\n\nTechnology Use\n\nOveruse of gaming, social media, and online relationships can impact a teen’s mental health and daily functioning. Polaris provides a balanced approach to help teens manage their technology use. Through structured programs and guidance from our experts, we aim to restore healthy habits and promote meaningful real-life connections.\n\nSubstance Use\n\nThe early stages of substance use, such as cannabis or alcohol, can lead to more significant issues if not addressed.

She was cheerful and positive and looked healthier than she has all year. We talked a lot about her goals for this year and what she would like to get out of it. And, we laughed a lot together. Thank you for taking such good care of her and giving her the structure and stability to continue on this journey.”\n\n– Molly\n\n“Polaris really helped our family. We are grateful for everything the staff did for us. They taught us skills through family and individual therapy. The team was supportive through the entire process.

All of the staff were friendly, the therapists were extremely helpful, and I made so many friends here that I still talk to. I cannot say enough good things about this place. It really made a big difference for me and I can confidently say that I am a better person today because of it. Thank you to all the Polaris staff who helped me!”\n\n– Ginger\n\n“I attended Polaris a year ago and it was an amazing experience. Not only did i learn to surf, but made some great friends, began opening up to my parents, and learned to trust. Towards the later part of my stay, my team there really helped me and my family find a long term placement for me. For anyone looking into short term residential, I would highly advise going here.”\n\n– Genevieve\n\n“If not for Polaris, I’m not sure where I’d be. The program was extremely helpful, yet the staff is really what made my experience wonderful. They were so encouraging and helpful, and I made some amazing connections while there. Thank you, Polaris!”\n\n– Nico\n\n“By far the best adolescent treatment center in the country!! The whole staff is caring and professional. They really listen and want to help not just the adolescent but the whole family. My daughter was not in a good place making lots of bad choices and she has completely changed for the better. Has goals and is working towards them. Thanks to all she learned at Polaris. Can’t say enough good things about them.”\n\n– Magdalena\n\n“Working here has been an amazing experience.

Our staff has dedicated their lives to treating troubled teens. We take an individualized approach to treatment that includes a variety of proven modalities.\n\nSafe Setting\n\nFeeling comfortable and safe is absolutely essential to a successful recovery. The approach was to create an environment that was both peaceful and private, yet central enough to Los Angeles, with access to the best clinicians and recreational activities that our teens so enjoy. We provide need-adapted treatment that is detached from the stigma of mental healthcare.\n\nTools For Life\n\nOne of the reasons the teenage years are particularly difficult is because they are a challenging transition between childhood and adulthood. Because we specialize in addressing the specific needs of adolescents, we know what it takes to help them overcome the challenges they are facing, and prepare them to thrive as adults today.\n\nCall Today To Speak With\n\nAn Admissions Specialist\n\nLearn more about our program – Get started\n\nPolaris Newsletter\n\nSee Our Latest Newsletters\n\nAugust 2023\n\nPolaris Primary Therapists Jovon Riggins, LCSW & Katherine Abdelkerim, LMFT At The IOCDF Conference\n\nNovember 2023\n\nPolaris Celebrates This Season Of Gratitude!
