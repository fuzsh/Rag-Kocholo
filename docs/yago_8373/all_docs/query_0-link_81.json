        "text": "The meeting take place every Thursday morning in an opulent building near the Champs Elysées, where Artmédia occupies three floors. Seven managers from Europe's leading art agency take a sit around a gigantic table, with large notebooks and agendas. If it weren't for the dozens of photos of stars hanging on the walls, you'd think you were in a meeting where the future of the world is being decided. This is the heart of a triumphant French film industry which, in the 1970s and first half of the 1980s, attracted more moviegoers to cinemas in France than Hollywood.\n\nArtmédia represents some of the biggest names: Catherine Deneuve, François Truffaut, Patrick Dewaere, Jean-Paul Belmondo, Isabelle Adjani, Sophie Marceau, Coluche, Miou-Miou, Romy Schneider and Gérard Depardieu. It's quite simple, with the exception of Alain Delon and Lino Ventura, all the stars are \"managed\" here. They were attracted by the agency's founder, the mysterious and charismatic Gérard Lebovici, who was found dead, in 1984, in a car park with four bullets in the back of his head.\n\nArtmédia has been run by Jean-Louis Livi since 1982. He knows what a star is. This tall, cultured and witty man from Marseille is Yves Montand's nephew. He has also been in charge of Depardieu's career since 1971. The actor nicknamed his mentor \"the little black eye.\" In fact, nothing on the movie planet – projects, desires, moves, cancellations, moods – escapes his agent's notice. A traffic light governs access to his office. When it turns red, no one is allowed in. In 1982, Livi was in a good position to see how the tectonic plates were shifting. At the end of May, Schneider, a major star of the Artmédia stable, died prematurely at the age of 43, and this tragedy confirmed a kind of tipping point.\n\nClosing the actress's file on his marble table, the reputedly organized former accountant noted an impressive statistic: At the time of her death, he had received only one shooting proposal for her. He had 16 for Depardieu. \"It's very simple, he was wanted for everything.\"\n\nPlans for 'Gérard'\n\nThe actor earned this special status after Les Valseuses (Going Places, 1974), when he made a dozen major films in just six years. The list is staggering: Sept morts sur ordonnance (Seven Deaths by Prescription, 1975) by Jacques Rouffio, 1900 (1976) by Bernardo Bertolucci, Barocco (1976) by André Téchiné, Préparez Vos Mouchoirs (Get Out Your Handkerchiefs, 1978) and Buffet Froid (\"Cold Buffet,\" 1979) by Bertrand Blier, La Dernière Femme (The Last Woman, 1976) and Rêve de Singe (Bye Bye Monkey, 1978) by Marco Ferreri, Maîtresse (Mistress, 1975) by Barbet Schroeder, Le Camion (The Truck, 1977) by Marguerite Duras, Mon Oncle d'Amérique (My American Uncle, 1980) by Alain Resnais, Le Dernier Métro (The Last Metro, 1980) by François Truffaut."
