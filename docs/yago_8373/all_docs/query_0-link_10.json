        "text": "The monstrous towers of the World Trade Center loom over a scene so chaotic it belongs in a mad Italian movie. Across the beach of landfill created for the future Battery Park City, four Caterpillar earth‐movers are rumbling like Panzers on maneuvers. Above, a helicopter clatters into view, then out. A tugboat steams up the Hudson, its whistle tooting. A truck rolls through the sand with a portable toilet on its back. A police siren wails from lower Manhattan.\n\nIn the midst of all this, two dozen technicians are chattering in three languages, gesturing at a make‐believe Kong‐sized ape figure reclining in the landfill. Geraldine Fitzgerald stands alone, vocalizing into the din. Marcello Mastroianni, with a fake mustache, rumpled clothes and a three‐day growth of beard, lurks soulfully, like a defrocked priest, behind a Panavision camera. A trainer pulls a baby‐blue sweater off a squealing little chimpanzee, while a flock of newsmen crowd behind a short, portly man with a beard as he issues orders in Kong's direction.\n\nMarco Ferreri is making a mad Italian movie. And if this keeps up, “Ferreriesque” may join “Felliniesque” in the vocabulary of film buffs. He already has forced them to sit up and take notice. Over the past few years, Ferreri has created almost as many scandales as ‘Italy has created governments. Among his controversial films were “La Grande Bouffe,” in which four men die during an orgy of over‐eating, and last year's “The Last Woman,” in which the hero slices off his sex organ with an electric carving knife.\n\nNow, Mr. Ferreri is winding up several weeks at the World Trade Cen‐. ter and elsewhere in New York making his first American feature, “Bye Bye Monkey.” As currently planned, it features several women gang‐raping Gerard Depardieu (the same unfortunate fellow who mutilated himself in “The Last Woman”) and the devouring of the chimp by New York's rat colony.\n\nMr. Depardieu plays an engineer—the same job he had in “The Last Woman”—who lives in ‘a metropolis where police squadrons are trying to exterminate rats that have overrun the city. A free spirit, symbolically named Lafayette, he has a brief affair with Miss Fitzgerald, who plays a ??? widow longing for love. Mr. Mastroianni is another friend, a decrepit asthmatic character whose main interest in life is protecting his little vegetable garden. James Coco, acclaimed last spring for his performance Off Broadway in “The Transfiguration of Benno Blimpie,” plays the bizarre owner of a wax museum where Mr. Depardieu works. The scene shot at the Battery Park landfill is supposed to take place at a city dump, where our hero has taken Miss Fitzgerald, Mr. Mastroianni and another friend on an excursion, and accidentally happens upon the chimp and the Kong‐sized ape.\n\nIf all this sounds like an incoherent send‐up of “King Kong,” don't be fooled. Mr. Ferreri's movies are difficult to explain in words, yet—once on the screen—they prove effective and often deal compellingly with major social issues. Just as “The Last Woman” was about the disintegration of sex roles and the nuclear family, “Bye Bye Monkey” seems to be about the breakup of the urban way of life, a continuation of a theme Mr. Ferreri explored visually in the stark, inhuman modern European factories and high‐rises of “The Last Woman.”\n\nIndeed, he is regarded as a major artist by many critics. “The Last Woman” won rave notices from Vincent Canby and other critics, and “La Grande Bouffe,”, “The Ape Woman” and “The Conjugal Bed” have been praised as well. Mr. Ferreri often shows the excessive, the repulsive, the ugly. But he believes that his ferocious satire captures images of contemporary society on the verge of social breakdown, and many serious students of film believe he does it brilliantly. This winter, the Museum of Modern Art will mount a full‐scale retrospective of Mr. Ferreri's movies.\n\n“Mottore!” the director calls to the cameraman as he focuses on Mr. Mastroianni, seated in the sand against the huge dead creature named Macho Kong. Mr. Maitroianni cradles the baby chimp in his arms, murmuring endearments in heavily accented English. “Stop!” cries Mr. Ferreri. “Ecco bene!” But Mr. Mastroianni's words now turn into Italian curses. Disgustedly, he hands the chimp back to its trainer. The animal has defecated right in the lap of Italy's greatgt sex symbol.\n\nMr. Depardieu sympathizes. “lie pee on me, too,” he assures Mr. Mastroianni.\n\nAh, what suffering actors go through for Mr. Ferreri, a 49‐year‐old Milanese native who started out to be a veterinarian. Mr. Mastroianni, currently riding high on the notices he received for his portrayal of a homosexual in “A Special Day” with Sophia Loren, plays only a supporting role in “Monkey.” It is his first old, decidedly non‐romantic character..Why consent to Mr. Ferreri's call for a cameo?\n\n“I like his world, his view of life,” says Mr. Mastroianni. “I think he's very modern, more than modern, in fact. And he chooses an actor because he likes what's inside, your sensitivity.” This is his fifth Ferreri film. (Mr. Ferreri later repays the compliment by saying he enjoys using Mr. Mastroianni because of “a certain desperation he expresses.”)\n\nMr. Depardieu, one of the hottest young European actors, who shares top billing with Robert De Niro in Bertolucci's “1900,” is equally loyal. Working with Mr. Ferreri, says this jolly Frenchman with the build of a linebacker and the smile of a choirboy, is “very emotional, intense,” even though Mr. Ferreri never tells him in advance what the plot is. “He just say ‘come,’ so I come.”\n\nMr. Ferreri, who resembles a benign, big‐bellied troll, is serious. Over dinner at a midtown Manhattan restaurant one night, he explained through his translator, the actress Anselma Dell'Olio, that “my job when I talk with people from the newspapers is to tell them that society is finished. The values that once existed no longer exist. The family, the bourgeoisie—I'm talking about values, morals, economic relationships. They no longer serve a purpose. My films are reactioA translated into images. The Roman Empire is over. We are entering the new Middle Ages. What interests me are moments when the wqrld is dissolving and exploding.”\n\nPressed for examples, Mr. Ferreri didn't take long to recall some. “You see it in New York. A long blackout—that's the moment. There are skyscrapers ‐41 here, and below them there are huge potholes in the streets. That's the Middle Ages. We're in a society we're told works, but we know it doesn't.”\n\nNew York, he continued, is the perfect metaphor for his ideas, since gang rape by women and an infestation of rats are not outside the realm of believability here. One of Mr. Ferreri's rare smiles emerged as he told a favorite story about shooting on location here. “I planted a vegetable garden near where we are shooting. People passing by ate the peppers we had put in the ground. That's the Middle Ages,” he chuckled. (For the required scene, he finally planted plastic peppers.)\n\nHow doei he reply to those who accuse him of using wretched excesses for shock value alone? “That was a question asked 10 years ago,” he declared with disdain. “Doesn't life shock you enough? The shock I shoW is no bigger than the shock we see in daily living.”\n\nAlthough Mr. Ferreri has made 16 Italian features, only a handful have been released here. Audience recognition has been slow as well. Why is America, Mr. Ferreri's “center’ of the Empire,” so far behind Europe in responding to his message? “Over there, they have already got the picture” of a self‐destructing civilization, he maintained. Young Europeans “see their own reality” in “The Last Woman,” for instance. But Americans haven't yet “come up against the blank wall.” By way of illustration, he noted that younger American members of his “Monkey” crew refused to believe that his portrayal of rats in New York was anything but science fiction. “The day will come when they will see,” Mr. Ferreri said ominously, polishing off the last of the lemon chicken.\n\nJacqueline, his wife of 19 years,. a French‐Canadian who is executive producer on “Monkey,” hinted that Mr. Ferreri is just a sweet little’ neighborhood guy underneath that world‐weary, intellectual exterior. “He is a man who likes cafes and train stations,” she said. They have homes in the St. Germain des Pres neighborhood of Paris and the historical district in Rome, as far from modernity as you can get. She and her husband love the sea and they go fishing a lot, but he cares little for natural beauty. “Foliage isn't interesting,” he said at one point. Then, at another, in response to a query on why he decided to film “Monkey” in New York, he said, “Don't talk to me about geographical questions. I chose this backdrop because this setting will move to Europe 10 years from now. I seem to make films that are 10 years ahead of the times.”\n\nIT so, we sure have some gruesome times in front of us.\n\nLosIlle Tovoll\n\nMarco Ferreri directing “Bye Bye Monkey”‐“Society is finished.
