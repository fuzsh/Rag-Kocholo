She translated and adapted for dubbing the dialogues of a long list of films including CLERKS, THE EMPIRE OF THE SUN and THE COLOR PURPLE. Her mentor was Mario Maldesi, for many decades the most coveted dubbing director of national and international authors. Those were the days when even Italian films were dubbed in their entirety. Since 1996 Anselma has followed the festivals of Venice and Rome for \"Il FoglioQuotidiano\". She has been a permanent critic for the weekly television program \"Cinematografo\" (Rai1) since its inception in 2003. She has been the main film critic for \"Moby Dick\" magazine, the artistic section of the \"Liberal\" newspaper (2008-2013). She has written about art and leisure for \"Fairchild Publications\" and many others. She wrote about cinema for \"Azure\", the magazine of the Shalem Institute, a think-tank from Jerusalem. She wrote columns for many years for \"Grazia\", \"Cosmopolitan\" (Italy) and for the international magazines \"W\", \"M\" and \"Women's Wear Daily\". She directed a documentary for Rai1 on American feminism, VIAGGIO NEL FEMMINISMO AMERICANO, and the documentary WHATEVER BECAME OF for the Canadian TV CBC (EneRiisna). She also wrote the screenplay HEART'S DESIRE on the life of Frances Xavier Cabrini - the first American saint, traveler and adventurer of the world, as well as patron of immigrants - optioned by Rai but not yet produced. In 2017 she wrote and directed the documentary film MARCO FERRERI: DANGEROUS BUT NECESSARY, presented at the Venice Film Festival (2017) in the Venezia Classics section. The film also won a Silver Ribbon and a David di Donatello for best documentary."
