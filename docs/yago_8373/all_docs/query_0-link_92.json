        "meta_description": "Italian postcard by Rotal Foto, Milano (Milan), no. 250.\n\t\n\tFilm actor <b>Marcello Mastroianni</b> (1924 - 1996) was Italy's favorite leading man since the 1950’s, as well as one of the finest actors of the European cinema. In his long and prolific career, Mastroianni almost singlehandedly defined the contemporary type of Latin lover, then proceeded to redefine it a dozen times and finally parodied it and played it against type.\n\t\n\tMarcello Vincenzo Domenico Mastroianni was born in Fontana Liri, a small village in the Apennines, in 1924. He was the son of Ida (née Irolle) and Ottone Mastroianni, who ran a carpentry shop. Marcello grew up in Turin and Rome. He appeared as an uncredited extra in Marionette (1939, Carmine Gallone) and later appeared as an extra in Una storia d'amore/Love Story (1942, Mario Camerini) and I bambini ci guardano/The Children Are Watching Us (1944, Vittorio De Sica). He worked in his father's carpentry shop; but during World War II he was put to work by the Germans drawing maps. During 1943–1944 he was imprisoned in a forced-labor camp, but he escaped and hid in Venice. In 1944, Mastroianni started working as a cashier for film company Eagle Lion (Rank) in Rome. He began taking acting lessons and acted with the University of Rome dramatic group. In the university's production of Angelica (1948) he appeared with Giulietta Masina. His first real film credit was in I Miserabili/Les misérables (1948, Riccardo Freda) with Gino Cervi. That year Mastroianni joined Luchino Visconti's repertory company, which was bringing to Italy a new kind of theater and novel ideas of staging. The young actor played Mitch in A Streetcar Named Desire , Happy in Death of a Salesman , Stanley Kowalski in Visconti's second staging of Streetcar , and roles in Chekhov's Three Sisters and Uncle Vanya. He also acted in radio plays and he had first substantial film role in the comedy Una domenica d'agosto/Sunday in August (1949, Luciano Emmer). In 1955 he co-starred with Vittorio De Sica and Sophia Loren - an actress with whom he would frequently be paired in the years to come - in the screwball comedy Peccato che Sia una Canaglia/Too Bad She's Bad (1955, Alessandro Blasetti) and later worked with De Sica again on the comedy Padri e Figli/ Like Father, Like Son (1957, Mario Monicelli). His roles gradually increased in importance, but for the most part both the casts and crews of his projects were undistinguished, and he remained an unknown outside of Italy. Mastroianni permanently sealed his stardom in Italy, playing a timid clerk whose love is not reciprocated, in Le notti bianche/White Nights (1957, Luchino Visconti). He soon became a major international star appearing in films like I soliti ignoti/Big Deal on Madonna Street (1958, Mario Monicelli) with Vittorio Gassman. In this classic crime caper he displayed a light touch for comedy, playing the exasperated member of an inept group of burglars. In 1960 he played his most famous role as a disillusioned and world-weary tabloid columnist who spends his days and nights exploring Rome's high society in Federico Fellini's La dolce vita/The Sweet Life (1960) with Anita Ekberg. La dolce vita changed the look and direction of Italian cinema. The picture was a global smash, and star Mastroianni became a worldwide success story. \n\t\n\tDuring the 1960’s Marcello Mastroianni played in many great films and regularly worked with the top Italian and French filmmakers. He appeared as the title character in Il bell'Antonio/Bell' Antonio (1960, Mauro Bolognini) and starred in Michelangelo Antonioni’s masterpiece La notte/The Night (1961), where again his distanced, expressionless demeanor fit perfectly into the film's air of alienation and remote emotionality. He appeared in interesting films like L'assassino/The Assassin (1961, Elio Petri), La Vie Privée/A Very Private Affair (1962, Louis Malle) with Brigitte Bardot, and Cronaca familiare/Family Diary (1962, Valerio Zurlini) with Jacques Perrin. Mastroianni followed La dolce vita with another signature role for Fellini, that of a film director/Fellini’s alter-ego who, amidst self-doubt and troubled love affairs, finds himself in a creative block while making a film in Otto e Mezzo/8½ (1962, Federico Fellini). The film won two Academy Awards. Mastroianni won the British BAFTA award twice for his roles in the black comedy Divorzio all'Italiana/Divorce, Italian Style (1963, Pietro Germi) and the deliciously funny three-part sex farce Ieri, oggi, domani/Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow (1963, Vittorio De Sica) costarring with Sophia Loren. He and Loren starred together again in the equally amusing sex comedy Matrimonio all'italiana/Marriage Italian Style (1964, Vittorio De Sica). According to Elaine Mancini on Film Reference “Mastroianni's masculinity blends perfectly with Loren's exuberant earthy personality” in both these films. While he was to become known for playing Latin lover roles (wgich he spoofed in Casanova 70 (1965, Mario Monicelli)), his characters often were far more complexly drawn. They were not one-dimensional pretty boys; rather, beneath their handsome exteriors they were lazy, world-weary, and doubt-ridden. Other films were, La decima vittima/The Tenth Victim (1965, Elio Petri) with Ursula Andress and the Camus adaptation Lo Straniero/The Stranger (1967, Luchino Visconti) with Anna Karina.\n\t\n\tMarcello Mastroianni won in 1970 the Best Actor award at the Cannes Film Festival for Dramma della gelosia - tutti i particolari in cronaca/Drama of Jealousy (1970, Ettore Scola). In 1987 he would win the award again for Oci ciornie/Dark Eyes (1987, Nikita Mikhalkov) and Mastroianni, Dean Stockwell and Jack Lemmon are the only actors to have won the award twice. During the 1970’s Mastroianni continued to work in interesting films by prolific directors like Leo the Last (1970, John Boorman), Permette? Rocco Papaleo/My Name Is Rocco Papaleo (1971, Ettore Scola) with Lauren Hutton, Liza (1972, Marco Ferreri) with Catherine Deneuve, Che?/What? (1972, Roman Polanski) with Sydne Rome, La Grande Bouffe/Blow Out (1973, Marco Ferreri), Touche pas à la femme blanche/ Don't Touch the White Woman! (1974, Marco Ferreri), La donna della domenica/The Sunday Woman (1975, Luigi Comencini) with Jacqueline Bisset, Ciao maschio/Bye Bye Monkey (1978, Marco Ferreri) with Gérard Depardieu, Così come sei/Stay as You Are (1978, Alberto Lattuada) with Nastassja Kinski, L'ingorgo - Una storia impossibile/Traffic Jam (1979, Luigi Comencini) with Annie Girardot, and La terrazza/The Terrace (1980, Ettore Scola) with Vittorio Gassman. He played against his Latin lover image in Scola’s Una giornata particolare/A Special Day (1977, Ettore Scola), in which Mastroianni's homosexual and Sophia Loren's oppressed wife come together on the day in 1938 when Hitler was cheered on the streets of Rome during his visit to Mussolini. His seemingly detached air was perfectly suited to satire as well, as he demonstrated in films as diverse as the historical drama Allonsanfàn (1974, Paolo and Vittorio Taviani), and La città delle donne/City of Women (1980, Federico Fellini). Yet he remained perfectly capable of playing highly dramatic roles, as he did so well in The Organizer , cast as a highborn but now indigent professor who becomes involved in union organizing activities in turn-of-the-twentieth-century Italy. \n\t\n\tIn the latter stages of his career, Marcello Mastroianni continued to take serious dramatic roles. For instance, he played the senior citizen who simply looks back on his past. In Stanno tutti bene/Everybody's Fine (1990, Giuseppe Tornatore), he is an elderly man who is absorbed in his memories, and who travels through Italy to call on his five adult children. In Oci ciornie/Dark Eyes (1987, Nikita Mikhalkov), he gives a tour-de-force performance as a once young and idealistic aspiring architect, who married a banker's daughter, fell into a lifestyle of afternoon snoozes and philandering, and proved incapable of holding onto what was important to him. His on-screen presence has also been directly linked to his earlier screen characterizations. In Prêt-à-Porter/Ready to Wear (1994, Robert Altman), he was reunited with Sophia Loren, and at one point in the scenario, she recreates her famous steamy striptease sequence from Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow . Loren is as beguiling as she had been 30 years earlier but Mastroianni is no longer the attentive young lover, so Sophia's seductive moves only put him to sleep. Mastroianni's appearance in two of Fellini's final features is especially sentimental. Ginger e Fred/Ginger and Fred (1986, Federico Fellini) is sweetly nostalgic for its union of Mastroianni and Giulietta Masina, two of the maestro's then-aging but still vibrant stars of the past. In Intervista (1987, Federico Fellini), he appears as himself with Anita Ekberg, with whom he had starred decades before in La dolce vita . Mastroianni's entrance is especially magical; the sequence in which he and Ekberg (who, he remarks, he has not seen since making La dolce vita ) observe their younger selves in some famous clips from that film is wonderfully nostalgic. \n\t\n\tIn 1988 Marcello Mastroianni was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the European Film Awards. He kept appearing in critically acclaimed films like To meteoro vima tou pelargou/The Suspended Step of the Stork (1991, Theodoros Angelopoulos), in which he was quietly poignant as an obscure man who may have once been an important Greek politician who had disappeared years earlier. Other films were Al di là delle nuvole/Beyond the Clouds (1995, Michelangelo Antonioni) and Trois vies et une seule mort/Three Lives and Only One Death (1996, Raúl Ruiz) with Anna Galiena. His final film was Viagem ao Princípio do Mundo/Voyage to the Beginning of the World (1997, Manoel de Oliveira). Marcello Mastroianni was married to Italian actress Flora Carabella (1926 - 1999) from 1948 until his death. They had one child together, Barbara. Mastroianni also had a daughter, actress Chiara Mastroianni, with the actress Catherine Deneuve, his longtime lover during the seventies. Both Flora and Catherine were at his bedside in Paris when he died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 72, as was his partner at the time, author and filmmaker Anna Maria Tatò. According to Christopher Wiegand and Paul Duncan in their book Federico Fellini, when Mastroianni died in 1996, the Trevi Fountain, which is so famously associated with him due to his role in Fellini's La dolce vita, was symbolically turned off and draped in black as a tribute. His brother Ruggero Mastroianni (1929-1996) was a highly regarded film editor who who edited several of Marcello's films directed by Federico Fellini, and appeared alongside Marcello in Scipione detto anche l'Africano/Scipio the African (1971, Luigi Magni), a comedic take on the once popular peplum/sword and sandal film genre. Marcello Mastroianni had held starring roles in about 120 films over the course of his long career.\n\t\n\tSources: Elaine Mancini (Film Reference; updated by Rob Edelman), Jason Ankeny (All Movie Guide), Wikipedia and IMDb.",
