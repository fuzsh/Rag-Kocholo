In adapting his arthistorical model for a survey of the American avant-garde film I am not suggesting that the remarkable achievement of the latter can be compared with the sublimity of the former. Nietzsche's model is particularly appropriate for an art that undergoes a rapid evolution within a single country and for a limited audience that is totally familiar with all the art that\n\nworks\n\nin the continuity of its tradition.\n\nNew American Cinema\n\nThe\n\nnew film-maker under consideration coupling\n\npresence of Dionysos and the oneiric illusion-\n\nism of Apollo no element can be found\n\nfilm.\n\nThe\n\nearly history of the\n\neye) and Le Sang d'un Poete (the cyclic suicides and the break-up of the statue-hero\n\nIn Deren and Hammid's an intricately structured cyclic dream ends in sparagmos.

At the climax of the third repetition, three versions of herself perform a ritual around the dining-room table which ends in the election of one to attack the sleeping figure with a knife. But just at the point of\n\ngrace of the 'first run'. If the American film-maker\n\nstabbing, the\n\non the themes and techniques of his European precursors, he did so with significant revisions. From the mid-40s until now, the New American Cinema has had a history of revisions, amplifications and attempted breaks with the accumulating past, with both the European film-makers of the 20s and with the Americans who preceded each\n\nAmerican avant-\n\ngarde film provides a thematic spectrum of the sparagmos. Its cinematic sources go back x.o Un Chien andalou (particularly the sliced\n\ntion of several objects\n\ndrew heavily\n\nwhich\n\nnot a combination of both forces. Within the dialectic of the New American Cinema the Dionysiac theme is sparagmos: the ripping apart of the flesh, most dreadfully concretized in the Orphic dismemberment of Pentheus in Euripides' Bacchae. Throughout the 40s the sparagmos is continued and mediated by a series of structures that identify the essence of cinema as a self-reflexive dream. Yet by the late 60s the mediations of illusionism will become the subject of films, and the duration and editing of those films will project the sparagmos as the form of the is\n\none of the very rare situations within the history of the cinema where these conditions apply. For the most part the cinema has been international and anti-traditional. The network of film festivals and the production patterns of most prolific commercial filmmakers reinforce the illusion that the cinema operates like the solar year, producing styles and personalities which are pushed into the level limbo of history once they fall from the is\n\nhere.\n\nof Dionysos and Apollo as dialectical functions breaks down simplistic form content distinctions.

When they lie down together she suddenly grabs the knife and jabs it into his face. Yet at the moment of contact it is revealed to have been an illusion. She has stabbed and shattered a mirror in which his face had been as\n\nAmerican Avant-Garde Cinema\n\n30 reflected. The pieces of the mirror fall mysteriously to the edge of a sea. Thus is climaxed a series of images and metaphors\n\nfor self-reflection: the veiled\n\nwoman\n\nat\n\none\n\npoint showed she had a mirror for a face; the knife blade had functioned as a mirror; and here the sparagmos occurs within a mirror. In the final cycle of the film a man approaches and enters the house again in the same pattern as her previous entrances only to find her dead, her throat apparently cut, with seaweed clinging to her, and the fragments of the shattered mirror about her.\n\nThe films of Dali and Bunuel and Cocteau nourished a formal mode which expanded in the wake of Meshes of the Afternoon into the dominant avant-garde film genre of the late 40s and early 50s: the trance film. In it a somnambulistic protagonist wanders through a forbidding landscape or a mysterious house in quest of a revelation of his own sexuality. When the film-maker assumes the role of protagonist, we identify that type of trance film as a psychodrama. Meshes of the Afternoon had the unique distinction of being a collaborative psychodrama: Deren and Hammid, who were married when they made the film, played the female and male roles themselves.\n\nform\n\nis\n\nHowever,\n\nits\n\nintricate\n\ncyclic\n\nuncharacteristic of the trance film.\n\nIn her second film, At Land (1944), Maya Deren (using a camerawoman but not a collaborator) is washed out of the sea which had rolled upon the broken mirror in her previous film. The entire film explores a spatial-temporal trope which had occurred briefly in Meshes. There when the figure with the knife rose to stab her sleeping self, she stepped from the floor onto sand, weeds, stone and carpet in the illusory time of a continuous walk from the table to the armchair. In At Land the unbroken progress of her bewildered quest takes her through a shifting labyrinth of interior and exterior scenes as if they were miraculously contiguous. The illusion of spatial continuity through continuous and fused movements is closely connected to the cinematic figure which permits the illusion of the protagonist meeting herself. In At Land that option is postponed until the climax of the film, when a tentative image of sexual identity (the protagonist caressing the hair of another woman) gives rise\n\nwhich the running filmwatched by herself from several\n\nto a final flight in\n\nmaker\n\nis\n\ncrucial locations described in her initial odys-\n\nThis fragmentation of the self sometimes substitutes for and sometimes supplements the moment of sparagmos. sey.\n\nIn Kenneth Anger's Fireworks (1947), the film-maker plays dreamer who wakes from one dream, in which he is held, bloodied, in the arms of a sailor, into another dream in which he dresses and in his masochistic quest encounters the same sailor and his companions,\n\nwho\n\nbeat\n\nhim and\n\ntear his flesh like a\n\nBacchic chorus. The sparagmos ends in a symbolized orgasm which revitalizes him and eventually leads him back to the bed (this time with the sailor) where the film began. In\n\nmajor\n\nher\n\nAnagram\n\ntheoretical\n\nof Ideas on Art,\n\nMaya Deren\n\n'An\n\nessay,\n\nForm and\n\nFilm',\n\nidentified herself as a Classicist.\n\nShe did so to distinguish her art from both the Romantic irrationality of surrealism and the graphic concerns of cubism. For Maya Deren the camera and its mechanisms constitute the ontological base of cinema. She rejects all attempts to distort or replace the\n\nphotographic\n\nillusionism and Renaissance perspective of the conventional photographic image. The formal manipulation of realistic units into an Apollonian ritualistic stitutes for her the art of\n\nform con-\n\ncinema.\n\nOn\n\nthis\n\nbasis she rationalizes her privileging of dance\n\nover painting as a model and subject for film. Variations on this basic structure, both filmic and mythic, occur in the first films of most film-makers who began their careers in the late 40s or early 50s. Curtis Harrington's Fragment of Seeking (1946) records the pursuit of a blonde girl by the filmmaker/protagonist through the corridors of a building to her room. At the very point where he embraces her, she becomes a skeleton with a wig; and in the final moments of the film, it is the protagonist himself, again in a wig, who is the object of his own sexual pursuit.\n\nThe most\n\nsophisticated and elaborate of\n\nthe early versions of The Bacchae within the\n\nAmerican avant-garde cinema was Sidney Peterson's last film, The Lead Shoes (1949). Its space compressed by consistent use of anamorphic photography, its sound a hysterical scrambling of two ballads, the film in-\n\nAmerican Avant-Garde Cinema corporatcs\n\nclliptically\n\nand Oedipal\n\nrendered\n\nAn\n\n31\n\nscenes\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nthemes of Entr'acte and Le Sang d'un\n\nintricate inter-\n\nPoete; like Cocteau, Peterson interiorizes the\n\nplay between the words of the ballads, them-\n\nviolence and paradoxes of his eclectic cinematic language. In his subsequent films, The Petrified Dog (1948) and Mr Frenhofer and the Minotaur (1949) Peterson continues the portrayal of the artistic sensibility at the horizon of sparagmos. The former film seems to draw from the film-maker's two incomplete academic careers, as a medical student and as a sculptor. Here he resurrects a Victorian Alice in Wonderland whose chronic blinking provides a metaphor for the operation of the camera's shutter, to wander through a park and an anatomy class filled with fools, whose madness is defined by cinematic figures of fast, slow and reverse motion. Mr Frenhofer and the Minotaur, like all\n\nfratricide\n\neros.\n\nAmerican corruptions of British originals, and the images of the film, often abstracted and reinflected by reverse or fast motion, incorporates within its montage a selves\n\nprinciple of displacement analogous to the\n\ndream world. Thus, the unburying of a son husband (the situation is ambiguous) by\n\nor\n\nwoman in the film, through reverse motion filming of her covering him with the\n\nsand, evokes the pains of childbirth; or the synchronization of bits from the ballad 'The Three Crows', which describes birds devouring a body, with fragmentary shots of the son eating bread, anticipates the surrealist dripping of blood from the bread which follows, and even the subsequent replacement of the son at the table by a dog nibbling a large bone. The cinematic strategies of The Lead Shoes offered a new option for future avant-garde film-makers. The montage of Deren, Anger and Harrington had derived from the conflict between the illusionary space within shots and the potential for subverting that illusionism by editing disjunctive spaces (and times) together. anamorphic Peterson's photography and rhythmic intercutting of a hopscotch through the film had the effect of fusing the different images, of negating the priority of montage and dynamizing imagery\n\nand\n\nallusion.\n\nPeterson's style ultimately derived from\n\non the tactics of Rene Clair's and Francis Picabia's Entr'acte, a dadaist film with a quasi-narrative of absurd causes and effects ending in a frantic, fast-motion intercutting of a runaway hearse, a roller coaster ride, and speeding cars, boats and planes. The hearse itself conveys the innocent victim of a nonsensical shooting: a hunter on the his elaboration\n\nrooftops of Paris kills a man while trying to shoot, alternately, a bird and an egg. In Peterson's version, The Cage (1947), he extended several of the transitions and cine-\n\nmatic tropes of Entr'acte into an allegory of the artistic personality, which fused the sexual\n\nand the aesthetic quest. The film depends\n\nupon an elaborate and discontinuous\n\ninter-\n\nplay between subjective and objective shots: a weaving of the perspectives of a loose eyeball, the schizophrenic artist who lost it, and his\n\n'realistic'\n\ncompanions. Thus,\n\nit\n\nblends\n\n,\n\nPeterson's films after his initial collaboration\n\nwith James Broughton, The Potted Psalm (1946), grew out of a classroom project: teaching cinema as a means of encouraging painters and sculptors at the California School of Fine Arts to think inventively. In this work he deliberately conflated three sources: Balzac's story The Unknown Masterpiece, Picasso's Minotaur omachia and the punning stream of consciousness style of Joyce's Finnegans Wake. The rhythmical intercut-\n\nfrom the story, as well two characters reading the story, images from the etching, and the undertext of the Joycean monologue, continually shifts referential levels in a complex interplay between the passions of artists and the passions depicted in their art, between the act of modelling and represented model. The shifting images are visually unified by the consistent use of anamorphic photography for the first time in Peterson's brief ting of elliptical scenes as shots of\n\ncareer as a film-maker.\n\nPeterson has described his ambitions in Mr Frenhofer and the Minotaur:\n\nmaking\n\nIt was my decision to do a thing about the Balzac story, taking seriously as the theme of the story the conflict between Poussin's classicism and its opposite. So, as strained through my mind, it became\n\nway of exploring the conflict stated Rousseau's remark to Picasso: 'We are\n\nreally a in\n\nthe\n\ntwo greatest\n\npainters:\n\nEgyptian manner, and\n\nI\n\nyou\n\nin the\n\nin\n\nthe\n\nmodern.'\n\nAmerican Avant-Garde Cinema\n\n32 In\n\nthe\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nhistory\n\nof the Peterson reformulated the Picasso-Rousseau distinction as one between himself and Deren. If ritual structures and mythic evocations constitute the Apollonian pole of this cinema, the radical rejection of illusionary deep space is its Dionysianism. True to the Nietzschean formulation, Deren, with whom the Apollonian has been theoretically identified, breaks down the spatial illusionism of Ritual in Transfigured Time (1946) with freeze frames and negative imagery; just as Peterson, the initial theorist of the Dionysiac, organized his films accorddialectic\n\nAmerican avant-garde\n\nfilm,\n\ning to the ritualistic and mythic patterns. The succession of The Cage, The Petrified\n\nDog and\n\nMr\n\nFrenhofer and the Minotaur deprimacy of the imagination in Peterson's cinema and a developing scribes an increasing\n\nsureness in the ability of cinematic tropes to represent subjective states. But with the making of The Lead Shoes he initiated an exploration of mythopoeia where the portrait of the artist blends with family romance; there, for the first time, the cinematic figures seem to give birth to the narrative they elaborate, rather than to be born of it. As a whole, Peterson's cinema forecasts the evolution from the trance film to the\n\nmythopoeic cinema, much as Maya Deren's too brief career had done. Yet it would not be until the mid-6os that the full implications of that tradition could be found. The first film Peterson worked on had been a collaboration with James Broughton; The Potted Psalm was a thorough conflation of their later styles, the subjective-objective inflection of a divided self and a mad erotic Chaplinesque. Broughton's first film on his\n\nAmerican Avant-Garde Cinema\n\n33\n\nown, Mother's Day (1948), remains among the highest achievements of the American avantgarde. It is a cinematic family album, in an ironic tone, wherein adult children farcically re-enact\n\nthe\n\nmother. The simply the\n\nVictorian fantasies of their age differential of the actors is most obvious of the many\n\nstrategies Broughton employs in his treatment of the irrecoverable past. Foreground and background placement, loop printing,\n\nstop-motion\n\nmodes of\n\nphotography,\n\nare\n\nthe\n\nchief\n\ninflecting the temporal disjunction\n\nthroughout the film, while the emphasis on games and play ironizes the fundamental violence of his vision of maternal domination.\n\nBroughton uses the cinema both for the evocation and the analysis of an ironic nostalgia. In Mother's Day the cinematic tropes, the costumes from various periods, the representation of children's games by adults and the formal association of the whole film with a family album, all serve to underline the presence of the images and to locate the film in the mind of a remembering subject. In many of his subsequent films, such as The Adventures of Jimmy (1950), Looney Tom, the Happy Lover (1951), Four in the Afternoon (1951) and This Is It (1970), the interplay of verse or prose narration with the imagery creates comparable disjunctions of time. Broughton, like his less successful contemporary Willard Maas, was a poet before he became a film-maker; like Maas, he believed that Cocteau's Le Sang d'un Poete provided the essential model for the avantgarde film of the future: a welding of montage and poetic language. 'The camera's challenge to the poet,' he has claimed, 'is that his images must be as definite as possible: the magic of his persons, landscapes, and actions occurring in apparent reality. At this point something approaching choreography must enter in: the finding of meaningful gesture and movement. And from the beginning I decided to make things happen head on, happen within the frame, without vagueness, without camera trickery so that it would be how the scenes were organized in the montage that would evoke the world I wanted to\n\n—\n\nexplore.'\n\nIn this system Broughton aligns himself with the position of Maya Deren, even including the metaphor of choreography,\n\nDionysiac cinema of Peterson ('camera trickery'). In his cyclic films, Four in the Afternoon., The Bed (1967;, The Golden against\n\nPositions\n\nthe\n\n(1970),\n\nBroughton\n\nincorporates\n\ncomic choreographic movements into schemata of essential life rituals. The most significant heir to Broughton's cinema was Ron Rice, whose picaresque films The Flower Thief (i960), Senseless (1962) and The Queen of Sheba Meets the Atom Man (1963) substitute a matrix of social alienation for Broughton's sense of the life cycle, but maintain the essential typology of his films. Robert Nelson, following both Broughton and Rice in his most ambitious film, The Great Blondino (1967), attempted an integration of the Dionysiac breakdown of 'actions occurring in apparent reality' when he introduced superimposition, distorted imagery\n\nand\n\nreflexive allusions to the facticity of the filmic materials in his picaresque story of the adventures of a tightrope walker.\n\nThe most important\n\navant-garde films of 50s sought formal alternatives to the trance film. The characteristic strategies of this period for breaking down the fictional authority of the dream landscape as mediated the\n\nby\n\na somnambulistic representative of the\n\nwere the multiplication of protagonists within a single film, the drawing of attention to the raw materials of cinematic illusion, and the conscious interplay of deep and shallow space within the imagery. Christopher MacLaine's The End (1950), Stan Brakhage's Reflections on Black (1955) and Ken Jacobs' Blonde Cobra (1962, but edited from footage taken by Bob Fleischner in 1959) are the most important examples of the late and self-doubting trance film as it survived into the 50s. The films of MacLaine and Jacobs share several congruent tactics even though the latter film-maker did not know of the former until his films were completed. They both intercut colour and black and white footage in ways that undermine the authority and stability of both illusionary textures; they thrust the burden of narrative logic upon an ironic series of commentaries which often occurred during long stretches of blackness, so that the visual montage at times becomes a synecdochic and metaphoric commentary on the monologues. Jacobs' version of the discontinuity of the self\n\n— 34\n\nAmerican\n\nself in Blonde Cobra is even more complex than MacLaine's. Jacobs keeps himself out of the film completely. His mediator is Jack Smith, himself a major film-maker, and the film itself is constructed from fictional tapes and films of Smith made in the late 50s. Although there is no direct address to the audience, there is an ironic reference to the form of the film in its opening. When Smith quotes Ginger Rogers ('Let's call the whole thing off), the film suddenly seems to break off in flashes and leader and slowly recovers\n\nmake\n\na fresh start.\n\nMore\n\ndramatically Jacobs calls for the placement of two live radios in the audience at every performance. The radios are cued to certain acts within the film, and they have the effect of undermining what tenuous illusion there is in the cinematic imagery. In the multiplication of roles and disguises that Smith assumes, in black itself to\n\nand white and colour, or\n\non the soundrendered highly problematic. A slip of the tongue in the intensity of the first long story shifts from the third to the first person, lending a momentrack, the self or the\n\ntary\n\nreferential\n\nSmith\n\nego\n\nstability\n\njust is\n\nto\n\nthe\n\ncharacter\n\nhas already recorded and liked it because it was vague. The intrusion of the authorial voice, the naming of the past and the future, and finally the indication of a present lost in\n\nmoment of replay, put into question the Active immediacy of the film pieces themselves. Similarly the central ambiguity of the self in both The Efid and Blonde Cobra devolves upon the very temporality of filmic construction, which begins with a moment of immediate presence the act of photo-\n\nthe\n\n— —which undermined by subsequent reflexive —the editing and the introduc-\n\ngraphy\n\nis\n\nacts\n\nBy refusing to gloss over these discontinuous principles with an illusionary continuity such as the older trance films employed, the two film-makers make the temporal disjunctiveness of the film-making process an attribute of the self as they represent it. In a more linear fashion Brakhage encounters the same formal problem in Reflections on Black. He resolves it in terms of the polarities I have previously associated with the tion of sound.\n\nstylistic\n\ndifferences\n\nbetween the films of Peterson. Brakhage\n\nMaya Deren and Sidney\n\nwho walks a then climbs three storeys of a tenement house. At the landing of each storey the blind man 'sees' a drama of establishes\n\nplays.\n\nAv ant-Garde Cinema\n\na\n\nblind mediator\n\nThe corresponding transition occurs near the end of the film when Smith, dressed in baby clothes, smashes a radio with a hammer\n\nNew\n\nand\n\nsexual frustration. Thus Brakhage conflates the linearity, and subjectivism of the early trance films with the multiple narratives of\n\na radio in the audience goes off synchronously. Both the early verbal slip which introduces the ego and the later moment which brings the radios into the Active texture of the film and which initiates the most optimistic moment as the infantile protagonist calmly puffs a cigarette to lullaby music are the contrasting moments of movement towards an autonomy of the self of its subject. In the rest of the film the ironies of montage, disguise and commentary substitute a chain of intertextural strategies for a stable self in the film. By contrast, Jacobs introduces himself into both the soundtrack and the images of Little Stabs at Happiness (1958-61). Here he disturbs the quality of presence in a series of unedited rolls of film, each representing the ambiance of an undramatic moment, when he talks over one roll to relieve the audience's restlessness, as he tells us. He talks about his past relationship with the people in the film and about his future plans. At one point he even tells us that he has played back what he\n\n—\n\nYork\n\nstreet at night,\n\nThe mediator's blindness is underlined by brilliant white scratch marks which the film-maker made over his eyes on the processed film. At times the scratch marks fill the whole, otherwise empty screen, as if we were looking through the scratches. These marks are both metaphors of the vision of the mediator and affirmations of the physical materiality of emulsion and celluloid in filmic illusion. In his previous film, The Way to Shadow Garden (1955), a more conventional trance film, the film-maker followed a moment of symbolic self-blinding with a switch from positive to negative, and the film ends as its subject wanders in a shadow garden of blazing white flowers and leaves against a black background. Here too the metaphor, which comes directly from the ending of Deren's Ritual in Transfigured Time, calls attention to the cinematic their successors.\n\nprocess.\n\nAmerican Avant-Garde Cinema\n\n35\n\nIn the central episode of Reflections on Black the blind man sees himself, temporarily capable of sight. He begins to make love to a woman only to be interrupted by another man, presumably the woman's husband. At\n\nand ground for the temporal ecstasies. For Brakhage the cinema is primarily a visual medium with no dircci means of representing a past which has not been recorded on film. He rejects the fictional dramatic film and\n\nthem-\n\nbases his concept of temporality upon the discontinuity between shooting and editing\n\nthis point the scratch stars manifest\n\nselves before his eyes.\n\nThe sudden\n\nappear-\n\nance of the scratches converts an arbitrarily into an episode etiological atemporal representation of the past of the self. By the late 50s and early 60s Brakhage had invented a new form, the lyrical film, which was radically to extend the Sidney Peterson approach to imagery and which would represent the self and its temporal ecstasies in terms of the modalities of a continuous present.\n\nAnticipation of the Night (1958) takes up the opening of Meshes of the Afternoon and elaborates it in terms of a Peterson-like consciousness.\n\nWe\n\nsee those parts of the\n\nbody\n\nwhich\n\na subject sees himself: the shoulders, the legs and especially the negative image the body projects as shadow. The shadow man of Anticipation of the Night leaves his home at\n\nthe beginning of the film and encounters\n\nand human universe as of imaginative loss which ultimately\n\nsights of the natural stations\n\nlead to his suicide.\n\nIn this film Brakhage fully achieves for the time a dialectical fusion between the image represented on the screen and the filmmaker/subject's reaction to it. By constantly moving the camera in imitation of the movement of the eyes and the fluctuations of\n\nfirst\n\nand by editing the movements in rhythms that suggest both the sudden and the gradual intrusions of memory and anticipation on the flux of the present, Brakhage mediates the visual world without a mediator. In his subsequent lyrical films the shadow man disappeared and the montage attention,\n\ndirectly represented the\n\nmoments\n\nof vision\n\nand thought. Reading Gertrude Stein, Brakhage found a narrative mode which corresponded to his theory of vision and which guided his theory\n\nwhich MacLaine and Jacobs found paradoxical.\n\nFor Anticipation of the Night, Brakhage adapted Stein's drifting, repetitive syntax to the cinema. Complexes of images undergo variations throughout the film; new elements are introduced gradually; images from the opening complexes have the charge of pastness when they recur later in the film; and proleptic imagery constitutes a future. Thus the present of the film incorporates\n\nboth\n\nown memory and\n\nits\n\nand there which is not\n\nanticipation,\n\nmoment\n\nits\n\nfaculty for\n\nnever a present\n\nis\n\nqualified\n\nby\n\nthe\n\necstasies.\n\nThree obsessive images of children dominAt the beginning of his theoretical book, Metaphors on Vision, Brakhage was to write: ate the film.\n\nImagine an eye unruled by man-made laws of perspective, an eye unprejudiced by compositional logic, an eye which does not respond to the name of everything but which must know each object encountered in life through an adventure of perception. How many colours are there in a field of grass to the crawling baby unaware of 'Green'? How many rainbows can light create for the untutored eye? How aware of variations in heat waves can that eye be? world alive with incomprehenand shimmering with an endless variety of movement and innumerable gradations in colour. Imagine a world before the 'in the beginning was the word'.\n\nImagine sible\n\na\n\nobjects\n\nEarly in Anticipation of the Night the shadow man attempts imaginatively to reconstruct the adventure of grass to a pre-verbal infant.\n\nThe camera moves through\n\nleaves\n\nand\n\ngrass,\n\nof temporality. All Brakhage's lyrical films operate upon the fiction of a man, the film-\n\nencounters and pursues a rainbow, explores the tactility of ground movement and ultimately reveals the mediation of a crawling\n\nmaker, looking on a natural sight and responding to it imaginatively. That encounter is always conceived as a crisis, and the moment of crisis provides the present tense\n\nwhom the shadow man observes. The very structure of the sequence as hysteron proteron, in which the childlike vision is imitated before the child is seen, suggests the child\n\nAmerican Avant-Garde Cinema\n\n36 ultimate failure of the imaginative attempt. Somewhat later the film-maker sees children delighting in the rides of an amusement park at night and tries to participate in their rap-\n\nmoving\n\ncamera in sympathy with movements. Finally, near the end of the film he sweeps over the sleeping bodies of children. Their stasis emphasizes ture,\n\nhis\n\ntheir whirling\n\nthe isolated consciousness of the film-maker.

Here the recovery is the strongest in the film, perhaps because it is without an external guiding gesture, but it too fails with the breaking of dawn and its implicit reduction of the entire quest for renewed vision to a nightly cycle. The shadow man fastens a rope to a tree and\n\ntries to\n\nhangs himself. Brakhage's subsequent lyrical films depend upon an ascesis of dramatic structure and mediating presences. In the remarkable short film The Dead (i960), for instance, he tests a series of metaphors for the horizon of death and finds them all insufficient. The very act of imagining and testing constitutes the\n\nmovement\n\nof the film. Starting from two cliche sites the graveyard and the river the film-maker goes on to propose their superimposition, and then the negative image of the graveyard, as images of death vision. In the course of his mediation he presents both the poles of whiteness (images washing each other out) and blackness (black leader). Yet he dwells longest on a figure of discontinuity unique to the cinematic process: he superimposes the same negative and positive images filmed by a continually moving camera through the graveyard; they are a fraction of a second out of synchronization, except at a few points where their coincidence causes a solarized flash of an eerie white light as if\n\n—\n\n—\n\nemanating from the tombstones. The tension between the imitation of eye movement of the film-maker walking through the cemetery and the mechanical of the positive/negative time-lag grounds the metaphor in the temporality of the editing process, which is further emphasized by the play of the colour river scenes against the black and white graves in rhetoric\n\nother\n\nmoments\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nfilm.\n\nThe\n\nradical\n\ndualism of nature and self that emerges from and the other lyrical films of Brakhage\n\nthis\n\ndirectly challenges the optimistic Apollonianism of Maya Deren's cinema and extends the Dionysiac inversion of illusionism that Peterson initiated.\n\nWhen Maya Deren\n\ndied in 1961, Jonas the polemical leadership of the American £vant-garde. At first he at-\n\nMekas assumed tempted\n\nto shift the terms of its dialectic. Since 1955 he had been moving from a position of militant opposition to the avant-garde a reconciliation, which was acby the making of his own first film, Guns of the Trees (1961). At that time Mekas was deluded by what was happening in Europe into thinking that a countercommercial cinema of 35-mm feature films was about to emerge in force in America. He saw the virtually simultaneous completion of his own film, Robert Frank and Alfred Leslie's Pull My Daisy (1958), Gregory Markopoulos' Serenity (1954-61) and Shirley Clarke's The Connection (i960) as a composite harbinger of a New American Cinema that would challenge Hollywood on its own\n\ntowards\n\ncelerated\n\nground. In addition to promoting these films through his magazine Film Culture and his column in the Village Voice, he proceeded with the apparently logical step of organizing a distribution outlet to service the\n\ncommer-\n\nwere hypothetically anxious to screen these films. Although that effort failed, the organization he founded, the Film-Makers' Cooperative, became the focal point for a concentration and revival of avant-garde film-making which far surpassed cial theatres that\n\nthe earlier high point of the late 40s.\n\nThe phase\n\nof the American avant-garde\n\nhave called 'agnostic' abandoned an omniscient camera eye and a stable firstperson perspective. A discontinuous relationship between the film-maker and his film is most frequently rendered by direct or indirect admission of his lack of authority over the\n\ncinema\n\nI\n\nnarrative or the structure of his film, most frequently presented on the soundtrack. The\n\nworks that Mekas first hailed as the origin of new mode of film-making in America drew upon these principles no matter how uncon-\n\na\n\nscious of their history the new film-makers Jack Kerouac's ironic monologue which makes up the soundtrack of Robert\n\nwere.\n\nFrank and Alfred Leslie's Pull\n\nMy\n\nDaisy\n\nis\n\nAmerican Avant-Garde Cinema\n\n37\n\none example of this; the Active director intrudes on the acted 'reality' of Shirley The Connection is another. In Clarke's Mekas' own Guns of the Trees a variety of sound strategies complement the pictorial range from documentary through fiction to symbolic mime. A more subtle form of disparity between subject and the film-maker's authority oc-\n\ncoincided with a revitalization of avant-garde film-making in America. Therefore when\n\ncurred in the films of the same period that were hailed for their 'spontaneity'. Cassavetes' Shadows (1959), Leacock's Primary (i960) and Rice's The Flower Thief are examples of a novelistic film, a documentary and a picaresque fantasy, all three characterized by hand-held camera work, elliptical editing and attention to gesture as a primary\n\ntheoretical speculations.\n\njust\n\nwho\n\nmode\n\nof\n\ncharacterization.\n\nThat\n\nstyle\n\nin-\n\ndirectly calls attention to the peculiarities of\n\nobservation and the physical presence of the cameramen shooting the film. As such it aligns itself with the lyrical film. However, the observing sensibility does not correspond to the subject of the film; and although the discontinuity is by no means as radical as in films like Guns of the Trees, the authority of the subject matter in each of these works is subtly undermined. The paradigmatic example of this tension can be seen in Jonas and Adolfas Mekas' treatment of The Brig (1964). They entered into the stage production as if they were documentary cameramen in the Leacock style and filmed the play. In 1964 the Venice Film Festival gave it an award as a pure\n\ndocumentary.\n\nThe\n\nnatural direction for this\n\nmode\n\nof\n\nfilm-making was adopted by Jonas Mekas when he turned to his own daily life as a subject and began to construct a filmic diary. limitations of a film journal, such as the impossibility of recording what has passed and the transformation of action that occurs\n\nThe\n\nwhen one becomes both the recorder and actor of life, are acknowledged in his Diaries, Notes and Sketches (1968) and Reminiscences of a Journey to Lithuania (1971) by organizing elements such as intertitles and spoken commentary which reflects upon both the filmic\n\nimages and the action they represent.\n\nNew\n\nAmerican Cinema The failure of the Group and of the Film-Makers' Cooperative to create a commercial alternative to the Hollywood studios and distribution system\n\nKenneth Anger, Gregory Markopoulos, Harry Smith and Stan Brakhage began to exhibit long films in the early 60s, after public\n\nsilences\n\nof\n\nmany\n\nyears,\n\nthe Film-Makers'\n\nCooperative provided them with a limited but encouraging distribution and Film Culture magazine offered a forum for their\n\nBoth the trance\n\nfilm\n\nand the\n\nlyrical film\n\npresented versions of the self in a quest for sexual identity. By the early 60s these forms no longer seemed to satisfy the most ambitious film-makers. They began the elaborate mythic structures that equated the dialectics of individual consciousness with the elemental struggles of gods or demi-gods, much as the Romantic poets had done. The major works of this phase, such as Anger's Scorpio Rising (1963), Markopoulos' The I Iliac Passion (1967), Harry Smith's Heaven and Earth Magic (also known as Number 12 and The Magic Feature, 1943-58), Jack Smith's Flaming Creatures (1962), Brakhage's Dog Star Man (1959-64) and Jacobs' unfinished The Sky Socialist (1965), subarchetypal conflicts for narrative stitute exposition.\n\nEach of the central works of the mythopoeic phase presents its own mode of mythology and its own strategy for calling into question the authority of its mode. Kenneth Anger moved towards mythopoeia earlier than most of his contemporaries. One might almost say that he was the first to seize\n\nupon the\n\ndirection indicated for the avantfilm by Maya Deren. Anger's garde Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome (first version, 1954) depicts a convocation of Egyptian and Hellenic deities under the control of a\n\nMagus and a 'Scarlet Woman' from the mythopoeic imagination of his chosen master, Aleister Crowley. From the opening ritual of waking and dressing the film acknowledges the ad hoc nature of its divine personifications. It is both the making new of ancient myths and a contemporary masquerade.\n\nThe turning point of the film, the poison-\n\ning of Pan and his subsequent sparagmos, coincides with the assuming of new masks and the compounding of guises. From the\n\nbeginning Anger had conceived of his film as\n\nAmerican Avant-Garde Cinema\n\n38 a triptych.\n\nWhen\n\nhe projected\n\nit\n\nas\n\nsuch\n\nat\n\nthe Second Experimental Film Festival at Brussels in 1958, the poisoning of Pan was the moment at which the images expanded\n\nfrom the single to the triple screen. In the version in distribution (1966) Anger introduced superimposition at this point and incorporated\n\nstrategies\n\nfrom Scorpio Rising\n\nfor calling attention to the illusionary status\n\nof mythology. In Scorpio Rising he establishes an ironic series of comparisons between a mythologized archetype of an American motorcyclist and his positive and negative prototypes, Hitler and Christ. Whenever analogies are introduced they are effected by\n\nmost vulgar representations of the popular images of those figures. Nazi checkerboards, magazine photos and flags present the image of Hitler, while Christ appears through the mediation of a Hollywood a collage of the\n\nEvery time a clip from this its comic absurdity, Anger indirectly reminds us that we are the subject of a parallel illusion in watching his film. The same distancing is achieved in the religious film.\n\nfilm occurs with\n\n1966 version of Inauguration of the Pleasure the incorporation of images of flaming moats and dying sinners from Lachman's Dante's Inferno in the montage of the diabolical spells of the Magus. Furthermore, Anger stresses the themes of masking,\n\nDome by\n\nmotion picture illusionism and his own ambiguous relationship to both, by superimposing most of the dressing sequence from his early, fragmentary film, Puce Moment (1948). For Anger the mythopoeic aspiration of the American avant-garde film-maker is dialectically related Hollywood's vulgar to mythologizing, and every attempt by an American artist to transcend that tinsel Olympus must somehow be grounded in it. Only the first of Jack Smith's three major Flaming Creatures, Normal Love films, (begun 1963) and No President (1969), was definitely completed and distributed. All three exploited the chemical changes that occur in film stock not used until long after the recommended time limit for exposure. Smith derived this heightened textural ambiguity from seeing Ron Rice's picaresque\n\nTaylor Mead, in The Flower Thief. However, he carried it to an extreme that Rice had not exploited. By cos-\n\nportrait of a beat poet,\n\nturning his actors in black and white gowns before flagrantly artificial white backdrops,\n\nhe capitalized upon the tendency of outdated film stock to wash towards whiteness. In the colour film Normal Love, a comparable pastel effect was achieved by elaborating an imagery that would coincide with the tendencies of outdated tolour 'material. Both films derived their mythologies from Hollywood. After exhibiting Flaming Creatures,\n\nSmith acknowledged\n\nhis\n\ncom-\n\ndebt to von Sternberg and his ironic enthusiasm for the world envisaged in the arabesque films of Maria Montez. Normal Love, on the other hand, depicts a convocation of Hollywood types from horror positional\n\nfilms: the\n\nWerewolf, the\n\nWoman. Yet\n\nMummy,\n\nthe\n\nCobra\n\nSmith's films the distance between homage and parody, between naive aspiration and irony, is so problematic that it is difficult to determine the degree of consciousness the film-maker had in the astounding distancing of his illusions. Perhaps these films should not be situated within the mythopoeic phase of the American avant-garde at all. The insistence of Smith's art on the evocation of a polymorphousperverse innocence is so strong that there is in\n\nabsolutely no hierarchical distinction in his\n\nwork between play, sex-play and ad hoc mimesis for the camera. Only after seeing No President, in which a documentary of the life of Wendell Wilkie is intercut with highcontrast tableaux reminiscent of Flaming Creatures in an indisputably ironic manner, might a critical viewer of the earlier films conclude that the cyclic myth of creatures destroyed in an earthquake only to be reborn for more dancing and pseudo-necrophiliac sex-play, or the combination of these images with popular Spanish and rock music, is also ironic.\n\nWhile Scorpio Rising describes the limitaof the mythopoeic imagination by grounding it in Hollywood archetypes, Flaming Creatures offers a more complexly tions\n\nironic version of the dialectic play of imagina-\n\ntion\n\nand nature. In the pivotal scene of the\n\nfilm an act of imagination, or more exactly of the fancy, engenders a physical convulsion:\n\nthe camera responds to a comic orgy by gyrating in sympathy to it; yet before the orgy is over an earthquake occurs and the\n\nsame\n\nspastic\n\nmovement\n\nis\n\npresented again as\n\nAmerican Avant-Garde Cinema\n\n39\n\nresponse to the natural disaster. After the earthquake, which temporarily destroys all the creatures, the possibility of a rebirth is explicitly tied to the power of cinematic montage. Into the middle of a long static passage of a fly clinging to and moving slightly over the brightly lit and gently swaying cloth backdrop, Smith proleptically injects a shot of a coffin lid beginning to move, emphasized by a synchronous change from the whining violin music which accompanies the fly to a 30s song. Then, as if he had been too hasty in cutting to the coffin, he returns to the empty scene and begins the coffin episode after another long static passage. Scorpio Rising, however, describes the ritual preparation for, and achievement of, a sparagmos (the death of a motorcyclist in a race at the end of the\n\na\n\nThat movement is expanded and commented upon by a montage of parallels film).\n\nand antitheses. The sparagmos of Flaming Creatures is itself the result of an excess of enthusiasm in the act of filming, and montage in this film is the agency of renewal and cyclic continuity.\n\nA very\n\ndifferent relationship\n\nbetween\n\nedit-\n\ning and mythopoeia can be found in the long\n\nGregory Markopoulos from this perIn his early work, Psyche (1947-48) and Swain (1951), he had used impressive montages of recapitulation as an organizational principle in the former and as the climax of the latter. Twice a Man (1962-63), Markopoulos' version of the myth of Hippolytus, employs a complex schema of memory within memory and a shifting mediation in the minds of four figures. The whole film is first posited in the memory of the Asclepius figure who is both the hero's lover and the agent of the cosmic rebirth. The Phaedra figure is divided into a young and old mother; the scene of rebirth is framed within the silent monologue of the former, while the latter is the emblem of the memory process itself. Finally, the episodes of the life of the hero are seen as his own films of iod.\n\nmemories\n\nas\n\nhe wanders through the house\n\nThe ambiguous movement between and prolepsis\n\nin this film\n\nis\n\nrecol-\n\ngrounded\n\nvery structure of the editing of every shot. Rather than directly splice one shot to the next and build his dynamics on the stress accent of the point of change, as in the clasin the\n\nwill\n\nstrategies\n\nof his youth. lection\n\nmontage of Eisenstein, Markopoulos introduce one or two frames of the forthcoming shot before the 'present' shot is completed; he also allows a series of brief flashes from the former shot to recur periodically as echoes after the former shot has ended as the dominant image. Thus one image breaks into the next in a moment of vibrating fusions of past, present and future time. With this structure operating throughout the film Markopoulos can introduce metaphors and complexly bracketed themes into his montage; he can also shift easily to extended passages of recapitulation. There are two passages at the end of the film in which hundreds of two-frame flashes from earlier scenes are repeated. The film-maker saw in this system an affirmation of the priority of montage over spatial transfiguration in the tradition I have associated with Maya Deren. In his crucial essay, 'Towards a New Narrative Film Form', he joins her in rejecting the use of filters, anamorphosis, or any other means of transforming the spatial given-ness of the cinematic image. He extends her commitment to the immanent aesthetics of the filmic material in a direction which she never took, when he points out that the fact that all films are a strip of still, rapidly changing frames has been 'understood only as a photographic necessity'. He emphasizes that rather than being a contingent fact about cinema this is the potential source of its primary structures. The operations of the single frame then became the focus of Markopoulos' later theoretical work. In The Illiac Passion Markopoulos no longer used this single-frame montage technique as a vehicle of psychological bracketing; nor are there any recapitulations in the film. Here, in his most ambitious work of mythopoeia, more than a dozen mythological episodes are interiorized as the passions of a modern Prometheus. The single-frame editing places the myths on a simultaneous level, while the film-maker employs a number of sical\n\nto\n\nidentify\n\nhis\n\ncharacters\n\nas\n\nimaginary beings. Most flagrantly he enters the scene himself at unpredicted moments to light-meter reading, set a prop in motion or adjust a costume. The elaborate costumes themselves set the actors off from the landscapes and cityscapes in which take a\n\nAmerican Avant-Garde Cinema\n\n40 Markopoulos has placed them. The Romantic myth of a divided and reunited selfhood is also the subject of Harry Smith's Heaven and Earth Magic. Here a female figure is injected by a magician with a substance that simultaneously makes her ascend to heaven and divides her body. The mental landscape of heaven is envisioned in a series of cyclic attempts to reconstitute her, ending with both her and the magician being swallowed by a titanic figure. After they descend through his body in an elevator they are defecated by him, whole again, on earth. Smith's film is the major instance of an animated mythopoeic film and also the example from this phase that most fully uses combined sound and image to attest to its fictionality. At the very beginning of the film, as the magician brings into the frame the basic elements out of which the woman will be initially constituted, we see him exit on screen right and then re-enter from screen left as if he had walked round the back of the screen.\n\nSimilar\n\nacknowledgements\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nanimation occur throughout the film.

As a work of the graphic cinema Smith's film has a fundamental orientation towards of spatial illusion. He wittily acknowledges this near the opening of the film when the magician pulls a photograph of a watermelon patch into the frame. The photograph has a horizon in Renaissance perspective, but the frame of the film does\n\nthe\n\nreorganization\n\nnot.\n\nHe\n\ntakes a\n\nwatermelon out of the photo-\n\ngraph for his manipulation in the more ambiguous black field of the film. When Smith speaks of sources for his mythopoeia MacGregor Matthews' presentations of the Caballah, Wilder Penfield's\n\n—\n\nopen\n\nsurgery on epileptics, and Schrcber's Memoirs of My\n\nbrain\n\nespecially\n\nD.\n\nNervous\n\nIllness\n\nP.\n\nmyth-making\n\n—\n\nbetween\n\nlink\n\na\n\nradical\n\ncomand paranoia manifests itself.

This action\n\nis\n\nconcentrated in the first and fourth parts of the film. The second and third are dialectical opposites. They describe alternative modes of visionary revival for the fallen woodsman as he lies on the mountain after his collapse. Part Two explores the idea of innocent\n\nwhich haunted Anticipation of is bracketed by images of the man lying on a rock, while superimposed infantile vision\n\nthe Night.\n\nThe\n\nfilm\n\nover him are the ragged images of a film strip of a naked female 'emanation'. The core of the film portrays an infant baby in black and white blinking his eyes, flexing his arms and turning in his cradle, while over his image a rapid montage of spring-like streams, trees, glittering textures, richly lush and almost fragrant landscapes, and a mother's breast, flash by in superimposition. In this section Brakhage proposes the untrained perception of an infant as one pole of the renovated vision that might revive the fallen\n\nDog\n\nStar\n\nMan. In Part Three he explores the other pole, that of vision heightened through sexuality. layers of superimposition mix images of a gradually accelerating human heart with solid colour, generally close-up shots of naked male and female bodies, and with scratches on the surface of the film rhythmically correlated to the beating heart. In the\n\nThree\n\nPart Four, the hero rises in quadruple superimposition and chops a tree. In the rapid and highly complex interlaying of four levels of imagery, his chopping is metaphorically extended to a procreative cycle of sex, birth, breast feeding and an encounter with\n\nfinal\n\nan infant crawling\n\nin front of a fire.\n\nAmerican Avant-Garde Cinema The\n\ndeliberately\n\ncycle\n\nments from\n\nall\n\nquasi-narrative\n\nwhich the child technique\n\nof\n\nreconstructs\n\n41 ele-\n\nthe earlier sections into a sequence. At the point at faces the fire, the collage\n\nPart\n\nTwo\n\nis\n\nreintroduced.\n\nThere Brakhage had cut tiny pieces of film out of a strip and inserted them into another base strip as if he were making a mosaic. Thus a coloured ear inlaid into the black and white image of the child in that earlier section both called attention to the momentary emphasis on hearing in the catalogue of his senses and affirmed the filmic materials themselves. In Part Four the crawling child ends the cyclic episode and the image of the fire in the hearth elliptically becomes the winter sun above the Dog Star Man on his mountain. He looks up to it before he falls in slow motion, through a cascade of images from autumn, to another hibernal desolation. In the final images of the film, Brakhage shows him again chopping wood. Here his negative image is superimposed upon the night sky as if he were a constellation, and the rhythm of his chopping is reflected in the sputtering flares and scratches on the film stock until an ultimate metaphorical association between the woodchopper and the film cutter is made clear. In that final identity of the mythopoeic prototype and the maker of the film, Dog Star Man ends. Brakhage has also released a version of this film called The Art of Vision (1961-65), in which all the layers which make up the parts are seen separately and in their possible permutations; so that the thirtyminute double-layered Prelude lasts for an hour and a half as its two layers are seen individually followed by their composite. In this version the six-minute four-layered Part Four decomposes through all the triple and double-layered possibilities to its four single layers over eighty-four minutes. The distended version of the film both impresses the viewer with the structure of the spatial illusionism of superimposition and reinforces the cyclic theme of the myth. In both versions Brakhage uses superimposition, anamorphosis, painting and scratching over images, and collage effects to create a spatial vision that is his own rather than that of the camera. He also affirms the\n\nad hoc quality of his mythopoeia in this way. However, there is a sequence at the end of\n\nPart One, the only unsuperimposed part in the epic, which dramatizes most fully the relationship of raw nature to the cinematic imagination as it veers towards paranoia. Throughout the climb the Dog Star Man is accompanied by his dog. As the film progresses, the angle of the mountain grows steeper until, near the end, he is climbing a cliff of seventy-five degrees. At this point, however, Brakhage gives us a shot of the Dog Star Man desperately crawling while the dog leaps easily at his side, confirming any suspicion the viewer might have had that the angle of the mountain was a function of the tilt of the camera. Yet rather than stop here at the unmasking of his own epistemological deception, Brakhage then tilts the camera all the way and shows the Dog Star Man slowly making his way up a ninety-degree wall!\n\nThe American avant-garde cinema began with an essential bifurcation which I have not yet treated. On the one hand, young filmmakers like Deren, Anger, Broughton, Peterson, Markopoulos and Brakhage absorbed from their Dadaist and Surrealist precursors those formal tactics which allowed them to invent a cinema that could describe the crisis of the self. Thus the early psychodramas bluntly posited the film-maker himself or herself as the figure of selfhood and the film was the description of that figure's\n\nquest for a sexual identity through a landscape that was aggressively alien. At the same time such film-makers as John and James Whitney, Jordan Belson, Robert Breer and Harry Smith derived from many of the same Dadaist and Surrealist sources a cinema that rigorously excluded all effigies of the self. Theirs was the graphic cinema (see AvantGarde Animation). In Harry Smith's Heaven and Earth Aiagic we found an early instance of the convergence of the subjectivist cinema with the graphic. Yet for the\n\nmost\n\npart,\n\nthe\n\nmythopoeic cinema was\n\na\n\ndirect outgrowth of the limitations of the trance\n\nAs long as the film-maker was limited to presenting the dialectic between nature and imagination in terms of a single passive consciousness and an active universe, he could not begin to elaborate discontinuities within the self and even more fundamental discontinuities between the self and its cinematic film.\n\nrepresentation.\n\nComposite structures such\n\nas\n\nAmerican Avant-Garde Cinema\n\n42 The End and Blonde Cobra were attempts at overcoming these limitations, and acknowledging those discontinuities.\n\nRomantic mythopoeia sciousness\n\nprojects\n\nin\n\nitself\n\nwhich the con-\n\nas\n\na\n\nnumber\n\nof\n\nindependent archetypes allowed the filmmakers to create elaborate forms in which certain epistemological issues fundamental to cinema could be dramatically represented. Since cinema is for the most part both an illusionary and an indexical medium (that is, one whose illusions are created by an external reality: the object filmed), one initial problem for the American avant-garde film-maker was to create a cinema in which his imagination and his will would be more evidently powerful than the actuality of the objects in front of his camera. The menacing landscapes of the psychodrama, as mediated by the trance figure, were clearly such transfigured actualities. The primary theoretical discussion which I have traced here centred on whether or not that transformation was to be essentially temporal or spatial. The success of the trance film brought with it the paradoxes of a strong selfhood: the spectres of solipsism and paranoia. If indeed the most pernicious illusion of cinema was Michael Snow's Wavelength: the\n\nloft.\n\nnot its spatial and temporal continuity but the deception that a cinematic image attested to the existence of an external reality, which the most advanced mythopoeic films sought to unmask, was there any possible subject for cinema aside from the self? What would a transcendental cinema be that presented things in thetnselves? The graphic filmmakers, who had purged their works of the more obvious metaphors of selfhood, were affirming the filmic frame, the screen, grain patterns and the projector light as the basic elements of an anti-illusionist cinema. With the emergence of the structural film the graphic and the subjectivist tendencies converged.\n\nFor purposes of brevity and\n\na clarity\n\nthe complexity of very recent\n\ndoes not permit,\n\nI\n\nshall confine\n\nwhich\n\nphenomena\n\nmyself to the\n\ndiscussion of two works which directly address themselves to the problems of the evolution of the American avant-garde film I have been schematizing it. They are Michael Snow's Wavelength (1967) and Landow's Remedial Reading George Comprehension (1970). Snow's film begins with a manifestation of\n\nas\n\nAmerican Avant-Garde Cinema\n\n43\n\npurely indexical cinema. We see an empty loft from a high viewing position looking across the whole room to and through a bank of windows at the far wall. The only sounds\n\nwe hear\n\nare those of the traffic\n\nfrom the\n\nstreet\n\nmove\n\nbook-\n\noutside, until a group of people\n\na\n\nloft. We see and hear them as in conventional film, that is, as if they were not being filmed, as if there were no camera there. When they leave, the image flickers and goes blank, calling attention to the actual flatness of the screen and the illusory nature of cinematic depth, but there is as yet no injection of the selfhood of the film-maker. The scene immediately returns. Two women enter the loft, go to the back wall and listen to a radio. As the Beatles' song 'Strawberry Fields' is heard from the radio mixed with the natural sounds of the women and the traffic, the tone of the whole image begins to change. This change occurs in such a way that we are forced to realize that someone (the film-maker) is placing different filters over the lens; the reddish tone of the image seems a fanciful response to the words of the\n\ncase into the a\n\nsong ('Nothing forever').\n\nThe\n\nis\n\nreal\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nStrawberry\n\nfields\n\nheld by hand, its deliberately obvious. This\n\nfilter\n\nis\n\nmanipulation is playful, but banal, strategy takes on meaning in the context of Brakhage's lyrical cinema. By affirming the presence of the film-maker behind the camera, Brakhage presented the photographic imagery as what the film-maker personally sees. Snow's manipulation of the filter calls attention both to his presence behind the camera and to the mechanical nature of the recording instrument; he refuses to allow Brakhage's metaphor to operate and reveals it as such, a metaphor. Snow wrote of this film: I\n\nwanted to make\n\nnervous\n\nsystem,\n\na\n\nsummation of\n\nreligious\n\ninklings,\n\nmy and\n\nwas thinking of planning time monument in which the beauty and sadness of equivalence could be celebrated, thinking of making a definitive statement of pure Film space and time, a balancing of illusion and 'fact', all about seeing.

By superimposition or\n\nfilters\n\noften\n\nalternate\n\nby\n\nfiltering in the printing he gives different colour tones to the black and white negative. The shifting filters make us aware of another limitation in the original image of the room. It is only when a strong filter dims the light within the loft that the signs and buildings outside the windows can be seen. Without such a filter the brightness of the daylight in relation to the artificial light within the room is such that the light at the windows blinds\n\nus to what\n\nWhen\n\nis\n\nthe\n\noutside.\n\nwomen\n\nturn off their radio and\n\nthe camera slowly zooms forward in minimal jerks, gradually closing in on the back wail. The moment of their exit is leave the\n\nloft,\n\nmatched with a switch from the 'received' sound to a generated sine wave, an electronic buzz, which asserts its priority over indexical sound until the end of the film. Even in the two places where natural sounds occur the gradually rising sine wave continues. Midway through the film there is a sound of broken glass and noises as if someone were breaking into the loft. The sound continues until a man enters and collapses on the floor. However, while the sound representation is continuous, the image continually changes degree of graininess, colour tone; very moment of the man's appearance it suddenly becomes night (the windows are black). By this point, the visual images have become as much a projection of the film-maker's will as the sine wave. As the zoom passes over the body towards the wall, superimpositions occur which present among other things a deeper daylight image of the loft, from the 'past' of the film, over the night scene. The whole room becomes daylight and night again before the final dramatic act. A woman enters, goes to the far wall and telephones someone to say that there is a body in the loft. Then she leaves. After she has departed, her image,\n\ntexture,\n\nand\n\nat the\n\nAmerican Avant-Garde Cinema\n\n44 in\n\nblack\n\nand white and cut\n\nflashes, appears\n\nin\n\nelliptical\n\nsuperimposition repeating, silently, her entry, call and exit. The ghost\n\nimage\n\nis\n\nin\n\nthe most subjective in the film.\n\nraises the notion of the loft as the\n\nIt\n\nextended\n\nlocus of an obsessed consciousness. It is the point of maximum humanization of the contemplated space, ambiguous and troubling as it is.\n\nHowever, Snow continues beyond this point towards an evocation of transcendence. The image slowly zooms in on a photograph tacked to the back wall. It is a black and white image of waves in the sea. As the camera frames the picture, surrounded on all sides by the immediate space of the wall, a superimposition dimly appears of the picture even\n\ncloser, filling the\n\nwhole screen.\n\nproleptic, indicating the point towards\n\nIt\n\nis\n\nwhich\n\nthe image is moving. The forward movement occurs not by a zoom but by a change of light values.\n\nWhen Snow\n\ngives\n\nmore\n\nlight to the\n\nimage and less to the picture framed by the wall, the earlier image becomes the dim remembrance of where we had been, behind the 'now' of the waves. That superimposition ends and the camera slowly zooms forward over the frozen waves towards a horizon which is doubly illusionary (a photograph within a film), and in that final movement the motion of the camera is freed of the last vestiges of a residual grounding in 'real' space, which it had been shedding since closer\n\nthe introduction of the sine wave. The trajectory of Wavelength is initially mechanical, then a fusion of mechanism and the humanized presence of the film-maker. But after the telephone call it provides a metaphor for a superhuman authority. At the middle stage, when the film-maker is copresent with his machine, Snow incorporates the strategies of Andy Warhol, whose long takes of a man eating a mushroom {Eat, 1964) or of a building {Empire, 1965) and arbitrary zooming about the room where someone is delivering a confessional monologue (much of The Chelsea Girls, 1966) were themselves deflations of the metaphor of the camera as an eye or the mind.\n\nWavelength might be construed as a complex reaction to both the early and the late Warhol styles: the fixed camera and the impulsive zoom. Warhol's unbudging camera was at first a radical dehumanization of the\n\ntactics\n\nof\n\nearlier\n\nfilm-makers\n\nwithin\n\nthe\n\nAmerican avant-garde. He recognized, at least implicitly, that their way of making cinema was closely bound to' the aesthetics of Abstract Expressionism which he had been dehumanizing in his paintings. His shift to film-making involved an attack on the same front in a different rrfedium. However, as he became involved in making cinema, Warhol seems to have found himself possessed by the work of Jack Smith. Under Smith's influence, he slowly turned from the dialectically\n\nleast\n\ncold presentation of affective or at gestures (sleeping, getting a\n\nprivate\n\nhaircut, kissing, eating, etc.) to a\n\ncinema that\n\nfocused on unstable psychologies and sadistically induced paroxysms of confession by its very refusal to be affected, as Stephen Koch has brilliantly analysed in his book Stargazer.\n\nThe unceasing zoom action which characmuch of Warhol's middle period tends\n\nterizes\n\nbe a direct refutation of the conventional action of the moving camera. Rather than\n\nto\n\npress\n\nin\n\nupon the\n\nface\n\nor\n\nthe\n\nrevealing\n\ngestures of the subjects of his films, Warhol prefers to is\n\nmake\n\nit\n\nperfectly clear that his eye\n\ninterested in everything but his subjects.\n\nHe zooms round\n\nthe\n\nroom almost\n\nas if he\n\nwere pushing the zoom lever back and forth without looking, just as his fixed camera had manifested a special kind of disinterest. Wavelength captures the obsessive concentration of the earliest Warhol films by the slowness and steadiness of its attention at any given moment in the film. The camera seems basically still even though we cannot fail to see it jerking forward. In the movement to-\n\nwards and into the photograph there is a parallel to Warhol's arbitrary zoom. However, it shifts from aleatory to intentional at a crucial moment. Until the last minutes of the film, the ultimate object of its progress is unknown. When it finally fixes on the still image of the waves, a new insight into the very nature of the zoom lens emerges. Initially the engineers who invented the zoom lens must have understood that the\n\nmoving camera, which actually traverses space, usually on tracks for smoothness, could be imitated by the ratio of two lenses to each other. In the shifting focal length effected by a lever without moving the camera itself, the illusion of forward or backward dollying\n\nAmerican Avant-Garde Cinema\n\nPope Ondine\n\nin\n\nAndy Warhol's The\n\nChelsea Girls.\n\n45\n\n46\n\nAmerican Avant-Garde Cinema\n\ncould be created. Earlier avant-gardists such as Gance and L'Herbier dreamed of such flexibility when they mounted their cameras on wires to imitate the flight of a snowball {Napoleon) or to fall to the floor of the stock\n\nmarket {V Argent). In Wavelength, Snow illustrates the deceppowers of the raw film material, the degree of lighting and finally the zoom lens itself to portray depth. When he moves from the 'surface' of the photograph, bounded by the wall, into its depicted space, he specifically calls to our attention the ability of the zoom lens to continue its illusion of moving forward by a simple change of lens ratio. In terms of film theory, he moves at the beginning of the film from the kind of affirmation of reality that Kracauer would emphasize (its pure indexicality), to a subjective,\n\ntive\n\nhumanized cinema\n\nthat\n\nDeren and Brakhage\n\nspeak of despite their disagreements; and he finally affirms a position close to both Jean Epstein and Dziga Vertov, who held that the camera and the techniques of editing provided man with a machine for the transcendence of his sensual limitations. The essential rhetorical and cinematic figure\n\nbehind\n\nmetalepsis,\n\nthat\n\nthe is,\n\nstructural\n\ncinema\n\nis\n\nthe figure of a figure.\n\nSnow's zoom lens comments on the moving camera; his still photograph comments on the still frames of filmic illusion. George Landow too had elaborated a metaleptical cinema in an attempt to overcome the excesses of selfconsciousness in his tradition. His early films the trope of refilming a film off a screen in order to emphasize its cinematic quality. In Remedial Reading Comprehension he marshals his gift of parody to reflect on the history of the American avant-garde film utilize\n\nand to construe his own autobiography as a film-maker. It is the second part of an autobiographical series, the first of which, Institutional Quality (1969), explored the influence of television and academic testing situations on his choice of becoming a filmmaker. In Remedial Reading Comprehension he combines images of himself jogging, a girl dreaming, a classroom assembling, a film exercise for speed reading and an ironical advertisement for processed rice. The images of Landow himself are second generation. He refilmed them off a screen to destroy illusion-\n\nary depth. Furthermore, he superimposed a frontal image over a silhouette. On top of these images, which occur near the beginning and the end of this short film, he printed the words 'This is a film about you' and later 'not about its maker'. The explicit introduction of the category of the second person\n\nacknowledges^ implicit theme in much structural cinema. There is an effort to present or rather to induce an experience without the mediation of a protagonist. Wavelength in its complex way attempts this. If the entire history of the American avant-garde film has been an exploration of the selfhood, as I have proposed, then Landow's film deceptively attests to it in the imagery and denies it in the text.\n\nThe dreaming woman\n\nis\n\na version of\n\nMaya\n\nDeren's persona, and her association with the classroom refers to the place her\n\ncinema has\n\nin the origins of\n\nLandow's own\n\nbe a film-maker. However, he presents himself as somehow more advanced than she because he acknowledges the act of desire\n\nto\n\ncounterfeiting (exemplified by the imitation rice commercial) which occurs in the middle\n\nof the film.\n\nBoth Wavelength and Remedial Reading Comprehension aspire to be films of de-mythologization.\n\nThey\n\nare characteristic of the\n\nmost advanced achievements of the American avant-garde film in the late 60s and early 70s. Like each of the crucial films in their tradisought a greater 'purity' than the films from which they sprang. That purity itself can be analysed as the reference to and the balancing of the successive stances of tion, they\n\ntheir predecessors.\n\nFollowing the principles set down in the Introduction, I have chosen one of its chief partisans to write about the American avant-garde. P. Adams Sitney is not only a partisan; he is, with Jonas Mekas, one of the chief pillars of the movement. And therefore, as in his exhaustive study Visionary Film: The American Avant-Garde (1974), he is the ideal mediator, to use one of his favourite words. There is, I think, no better exponent of the movement; however, it will be noticed that he shares the tendency of all avantgardists to see no salvation outside the movement. Therefore, there are many statements in his essay (like 'By the 40s, the Hollywood cinema was moribund') which will\n\nexcite\n\ninstant\n\npremature, perhaps.\n\ndisbelief.\n\nA\n\nlittle\n\nAmerican Cinema of the 70s\n\n47\n\nOn\n\nthe other hand, he does explain the and tenets of this movement better than anyone else: e.g., his statement that 'one initial problem for the American avantgarde film-maker was to create a cinema in beliefs\n\nwhich his imagination and his will would be more evidently powerful than the actuality of the objects in front of his camera'. This sentence, I believe, explains the reason why the movement has excited both hostility and adherence; this need for the film-maker to assert himself, this mistrust of reality is the principal quality (or defect, according to one's point of view) of the American avantgarde film. Sitney's article on the graphic cinema, entitled Avant-Garde Animation, must be read in conjunction with this article, if only it is there that he discusses the work of the film-maker whom I find the most important of them all, Hollis Frampton. See also Jonathan Rosenbaum's piece on Michael Snow, Tony Rayns on Shirley Clarke, and\n\nbecause\n\nmy own\n\narticle\n\non Robert Kramer.\n\nFor those who feel that Sitney has somewhat glossed over the films of Warhol, there are two excellent books: Stephen Koch's Stargazer: Andy Warhol's World and His Films (1973) and Peter Gidal's Andy Warhol: Films and Painting (1971). Other works on the experimental cinema that can be profitably consulted include: Experimental Cinema: a 50 Year Evolution (1971) by David Curtis, Gregory Battcock's critical anthology (1967)\n\nThe\n\nand\n\nNew American Cinema\n\nSheldon\n\nRenan's\n\nAn\n\nIntro-\n\nduction to the American Underground Film (1967), republished in Britain in 1968 as The Underground Film: An Introduction to its\n\nDevelopment\n\nin\n\nAmerica.\n\nAMERICAN CINEMA OF THE 70s Richard Corliss\n\nOf the dozen or so American film directors who have come to deserved prominence since 1970, a surprisingly high percentage are the products of graduate film programmes at such schools as the University of Southern California, U.C.L.A. and New York University. The schools themselves may have provided little more than way stops for a generation of ambitious young cineastes (one could compose intriguing lists of direc-\n\ntors\n\nwho,\n\nas\n\nactors,\n\nearly in their careers, cartoonists,\n\nwashers); but\n\nit's\n\nhad worked\n\nengineers,\n\ndish-\n\nlikely that systematic ex-\n\nposure to\n\nclassical\n\nhistorical\n\nmoment when\n\nAmerican\n\nfilms, at just the\n\nthese films were at intellectually respectable, had\n\nbecoming to do with convincing these Young Turks that the Hollywood tradition was an honourable one, and one ready to be reformed and revitalized from within. There is also an imposing roster of filmschool graduates who have become screenwriters: Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck, David Ward, Walter Hill, Paul Schrader, W. D. Richter. And there are several young cinematographers, editors and, no doubt, key grips who have done a stretch as at least last\n\na\n\nlot\n\nmigrant workers in the groves of academe. But even the hot-shot scenarists earning $300,000 for an original script hope to direct some day soon it has replaced movie stardom as the American 'showbiz' dream. The filmmakers mentioned below have already arrived. They include some of the most powerful men in the business, who now have the responsi-\n\n—\n\nbility to make innovations, and take risks, on multimillion-dollar budgets. Only time will tell\n\nwhether they\n\nelephantiasis\n\nfall\n\nprey to stagnation and\n\n—become middle-aged—and are\n\noverthrown by the next generation, the\n\nclass\n\nof 1980. Peter\n\nBogdanovich (born an 1939), honours graduate of the Film Buff School of New York, has been accused, by critic Richard Eder, of knowing how to make films, but not why. His films are genre pieces (horror movies in Targets, 1968; screwball comedy in What's Up, Doc?, 1972; fonder-guardian sentiment in Paper Moon, 1973; literary adaptation in Daisy Miller, 1974; musical comedy in At Long Last Love, 1975), as seen from a revisionist rather than revolutionary point of view genuine imitation valentines to the Hollywood system, of which\n\n—\n\nNickelodeon (1976) is failed fond, his only the most blatant. Even The Last Picture\n\nShow vich's\n\n(1971), which established Bogdanoreputation, echoes an earlier film:\n\nMartin Ritt's Hud (1963), also based on a Larry McMurtry novel, which dealt in the same drawling ironies, the same seducing of puritan losers by libertine predators. Only in his foibles and failures do passion and eccentricity surface: in his\n\nobsession with Cybill\n\n— 48\n\nAmerican Cinema of\n\nShepherd (Bogdanovich's Susan Alexander), and in his insistence on shooting the songs in At Long Last Love with direct sound. Generally, though, and despite his devotion to such humanists as Renoir and McCarey, the director's true mentor in style, spirit and\n\n—\n\n—\n\nmasterly direction of actors is that ultimate technician, William Wyler. Francis Ford Coppola (born 1939) had made a couple of 'nudie films' (The Wide Open Spaces and The Belt Girls and the Playboy, c. 1961) and a baroque horror movie (Dementia 13 [U.K.: The Haunted and the Hunted], 1963) before even enrolling at U.C.L.A.; his master's thesis was You're a Big Boy Now (1967). But after two more films (the ho-hummable Finian's Rainbow, 1968; the underrated The Rain People, 1969), Coppola had yet to find a personal or visual style or to hit pay dirt so he kept busy by writing scripts (notably Patton) for other directors. But with his two Godfathers (1972 and 1974) Coppola fused operatic intensity with a murky languor, and turned one of the most energetic of pulp novels into, in effect, a six-and-a-half-hour art film that grossed almost $200,000,000.
