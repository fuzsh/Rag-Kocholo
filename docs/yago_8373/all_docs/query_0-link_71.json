        "text": "April 21: Gone Legitimate — A movie featuring an adult film actor in a mainstream role.\n\nMarco Ferreri is probably best known for his film La Grande Bouffe. Here, he sets a film in an end-of-the-world-feeling New York City, a place of only the strange and the rats, a place where Gerard Lafayette (Gérard Depardieu) lives in the basement of Andreas Flaxman’s (James Coco) wax museum, which is all about the Roman Empire.\n\nHe also volunteers at an all-female theater group, which has Mimsy Farmer, Francesca De Sapio (The Godfather Part II) and Stefania Casini (Sara from Suspiria) as members. Their latest play is about how women could easily overpower men and rape them. To prove their theory, Gerard is knocked out with a bottle of Coke and Angelica (adult actress Abigail Clayton, billed as Gail Lawrence; she was in 7 Into Snowy, Sexworld and Alex de Renzy’s Femmes de Sade. After going into legitimate movies, she played Rita in Maniac) volunteers to be the one to take him.\n\nMeanwhile, in Battery Park, Gerard finds a baby monkey in the arms of a King Kong sculpture — or is it Kong, fallen from the Twin Towers? — and a group of eccentrics led by Luigi (Marcello Mastroianni). He takes his new simian child home but Andreas tells him that the baby will destroy his dreams. Angelica moves in as she’s pregnant, possibly with their child of rape, but when he doesn’t care about their child being born, she leaves and while the baby ape is alone, the rats eat him.\n\nGerard responds by breaking into the wax museum and causing a fire that kills both he and Andreas, while Angelica sits on the shore with her new child."
