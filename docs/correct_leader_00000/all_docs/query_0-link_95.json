        "text": "Former Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon's health has deteriorated further, with hospital officials now saying he is in a \"slow, steady decline.\"\n\nZeev Rotstein, director of the Tel Hashomer hospital, said on Friday that Sharon's kidneys and other vital organs are now malfunctioning.\n\nThe hospital said Thursday the 85-year-old former Israeli leader was in critical condition. He has been in a coma since suffering a stroke in 2006 at the height of his political power.\n\nSharon was one of Israel's most iconic and controversial figures. In mid-2005, he directed a unilateral withdrawal of Israeli troops and settlers from the Gaza Strip, ending a 38-year military control of the territory.\n\nIt was considered by many to be a shocking turnaround for a man who had been a leading player in building Jewish settlements in captured Palestinian territories.\n\nVOA News\n\nThe Voice of America provides news and information in more than 40 languages to an estimated weekly audience of over 326 million people.
