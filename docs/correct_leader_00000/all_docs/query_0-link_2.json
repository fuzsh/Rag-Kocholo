It was the first, and to date only time an election for Prime Minister was held without parallel elections for the Knesset, and one of the first acts of the new government was to repeal the law which introduced separate elections.[1] Despite his large margin of victory in the election, because there had been no Knesset elections, Sharon's Likud was not the largest party in the Knesset, resulting in the formation of a national unity coalition that at some point included Labor–Meimad (the largest faction in the Knesset), Shas, the Centre Party, the National Religious Party, United Torah Judaism, Yisrael BaAliyah, the National Union-Yisrael Beiteinu, the New Way and Gesher.[2] Shas left the government on 23 May 2002, but returned on 3 June, whilst Labor–Meimad left on 2 November 2002.\n\nThe government initially had 26 ministers and 15 deputy ministers, making it the largest in Israeli political history, and resulting in a new $10,000 horseshoe-shaped table having to be installed in the Knesset plenum.[1] There were four Deputy Prime Ministers and eight Ministers without Portfolio during the government's term, during which the total number of ministers rose to 29.[2] Although there had previously been Israeli Arab deputy ministers, with the inclusion of the Druze politician Salah Tarif as Minister without Portfolio, the twenty-ninth government was the first to have a non-Jewish minister.[3] Sharon formed a center-right coalition government that was not dependent on the ultra-Orthodox parties.[4]\n\nThe government held office until Sharon formed the thirtieth government on 28 February 2003, following Likud's comprehensive victory in the January elections.\n\nIsraeli government formation, 2001\n\nPosition Person Party Prime Minister Ariel Sharon Likud Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres (until 2 November 2002) Labor-Meimad Silvan Shalom Likud Natan Sharansky Yisrael BaAliyah Eli Yishai 1 Shas Minister of Agriculture Shalom Simhon (until 2 November 2002) Labor–Meimad Tzipi Livni (from 17 December 2002) Likud Minister of Communications Reuven Rivlin Likud Minister of Defense Binyamin Ben-Eliezer (until 2 November 2002) Labor–Meimad Shaul Mofaz (from 4 November 2002) Not an MK Minister of Education Limor Livnat Likud Minister of the Environment Tzachi Hanegbi Likud Minister of Finance Silvan Shalom Likud Minister of Foreign Affairs Shimon Peres (until 2 November 2002) Labor–Meimad Binyamin Netanyahu (from 6 November 2002) Not an MK Minister of Health Nissim Dahan 1 Shas Minister of Housing and Construction Natan Sharansky Yisrael BaAliyah Minister of Immigrant Absorption Ariel Sharon Likud Minister of Industry, Trade and Labour Dalia Itzik (until 2 November 2002) Labor–Meimad Ariel Sharon (from 2 November 2002) Likud Minister of Internal Affairs Eli Yishai 1 Shas Minister of Internal Security Uzi Landau Likud Minister of Jerusalem Affairs Eli Suissa 1 Shas Minister of Justice Meir Sheetrit Likud Minister of Labour and Social Welfare Shlomo Benizri Shas Minister of National Infrastructure Avigdor Lieberman (until 14 March 2002) Yisrael Beiteinu Effi Eitam (from 18 September 2002) Not an MK Minister of Regional Co-operation Tzipi Livni (until 29 August 2001) Likud Roni Milo (from 29 August 2001) Centre Party Minister of Religious Affairs Asher Ohana Not an MK Minister of Science, Culture and Sport Matan Vilnai Not an MK Minister of Social Co-ordination Shmuel Avital Not an MK Minister of Tourism Rehavam Ze'evi (until 17 October 2001)2 National Union Benny Elon (31 October 2001 -
