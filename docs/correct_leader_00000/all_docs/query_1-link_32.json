        "text": "Ariel Sharon's decades of military and political leadership made him one of Israel's most formidable and controversial figures.\n\nHis actions on the battlefield and later on in the political arena helped shape the modern state, but also often polarised opinion.\n\nPerhaps more than any other Israeli leader, Mr Sharon was admired and reviled in equal measure.\n\nHis paramount aim in life was to ensure total security for Israel on his terms, even at a political cost.\n\nMr Sharon was long-time champion of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, but one of his final acts - pulling Israel out of Gaza - caused shockwaves among many of his supporters. Shortly afterwards his career was abruptly ended when he suffered a succession of strokes, leaving him in a coma.\n\nMr Sharon was born in Palestine in 1928, when it was under British mandate.\n\nAs a young man he joined the Jewish underground military organisation Haganah, and fought as a platoon commander in the Arab-Israeli war of 1948-49.\n\nIn the 1950s he led a team of special forces, called Unit 101, in reprisal raids for cross-border attacks by Palestinian militias.\n\nMr Sharon fought in all of Israel's wars since the state's founding in 1948, and earned a reputation as a fearless soldier and brilliant strategist.\n\nHe led a paratroopers' brigade in the 1956 Suez War and rose to the rank of major general. In the war of June 1967, Mr Sharon commanded a division in the Sinai where his success against the Egyptian army played a key part in Israel's capture of the entire peninsula.\n\nSix years later, when Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack on Israel, Mr Sharon led a division which cut off Egypt's Third Army in the Sinai, a move which turned the tide of the war and helped Israel win.\n\nMr Sharon was elected to the Israeli parliament (Knesset) as an MP of the new right-wing Likud party two months later, but resigned the following year to serve as a security adviser to Yitzhak Rabin.\n\nHe was re-elected to the Knesset in 1977 and was appointed minister of defence in Menachem Begin's government in 1981.\n\nIn the wake of shelling of northern Israel by Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) in southern Lebanon, Mr Sharon masterminded Israel's invasion of its northern neighbour in 1982.\n\nWithout explicitly informing Prime Minister Begin, he sent the Israeli army all the way to Beirut, a strike which ended in the expulsion of the PLO from Lebanon.\n\nThe move stopped the PLO using Lebanon to launch attacks against Israel, but also resulted in the killing of hundreds of Palestinians by Lebanese Christian militiamen in two Beirut refugee camps under Israeli control.\n\nThe incidents, known as the Sabra and Shatila massacres, made Mr Sharon notorious among Palestinians, and hated.\n\nMr Sharon was removed from office in 1983 by an Israeli tribunal investigating the 1982 Lebanon invasion, finding him indirectly responsible for the killings.\n\nAfter Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing coalition came to power in 1996, the new Israeli prime minister brought him into his cabinet.\n\nOn appointing him as foreign minister in 1998, Mr Netanyahu said Mr Sharon was the best man for the job.\n\n\"We shouldn't deal with bygones,\" he said. \"He has a record throughout his public life and during the past 15 years that people should be proud of.\"\n\nMr Sharon went on to become leader of the Likud Party in opposition after Mr Netanyahu's defeat in the 1999 general election.\n\nAfter the failure of the 2000 Camp David talks, Mr Sharon sought to stir a public groundswell against the then Prime Minister Ehud Barak, depicting him as a usurper ready to trade Jerusalem for a peace agreement.\n\n''Barak does not have the right to give up Jerusalem, which the people received as a legacy,'' Mr Sharon said at a parliamentary session."
