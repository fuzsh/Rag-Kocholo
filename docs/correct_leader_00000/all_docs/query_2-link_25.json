Shuttle buses have been taking people to the Knesset from various pick-up points across Jerusalem and the surrounding region.\n\nThe coffin holding Sharon’s body, draped in the national flag, was carried onto a plinth outside the Knesset this morning.\n\nWriting in a tribute today, Israel’s justice minister Tzipi Livni said: “They say old soldiers do not die, they fade away. Arik Sharon faded away eight years ago, and now we truly say goodbye to him.”\n\nAriel Sharon dies: Former Israeli Prime Minister's life in pictures\n\nShow all 12\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
