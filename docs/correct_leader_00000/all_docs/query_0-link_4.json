        "text": "Early life and military career\n\nBorn Ariel Scheinerman—like many Israelis, he Hebraized his name in the early years of the state—Sharon grew up in a family of Russian immigrants in then British-ruled Palestine. His early years were marked by experiences in the secular, socialist Labour Zionist movement and in the Haganah, the underground Zionist militia, which he joined at age 14. In December 1947 he became a full-time soldier. In 1948, Sharon fought as a junior officer in the battle of Laṭrūn; when Israeli forces there were routed by Jordanian troops, Sharon’s platoon was destroyed, and he was seriously injured. He later said that he was “eaten up by despair and the shame of the defeat.” After the war he remained in uniform and served as an intelligence officer while studying Middle Eastern history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n\nIn July 1953 Sharon was appointed the head of Unit 101, a commando group charged with conducting reprisal raids against Jordanian border villages in response to incursions by Arab irregulars. Sharon was accorded considerable independence of action, to which he added a natural impetuosity and recklessness. In October one such operation, a retaliatory attack against the village of Qibyā (in the West Bank), left 69 civilians dead, many of them women and children. The episode evoked criticism both in Israel and abroad. Israeli foreign minister Moshe Sharett, who had opposed any such retaliation, decried the raid as having exposed Israel before the world “as a gang of bloodsuckers, capable of mass murder.” But Sharon was protected by the country’s combative first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, who described the young Sharon as original and visionary. In his diary Ben-Gurion also noted, “Were he to rid himself of his faults of not speaking the truth and to distance himself from gossip, he would be an exceptional military leader.”\n\nIn 1955 Sharon led another raid, this time directed at the Egyptian forces that were occupying the Gaza Strip. The incident, in which 38 Egyptians and 8 Israelis were killed, heightened tensions between Israel and Egypt. In late October 1956 the crisis culminated in the invasion of Egypt by Israel, in secret alliance with Britain and France (see Suez Crisis). In the ensuing campaign, Sharon commanded paratroopers who captured the strategic Mitla Pass in the central Sinai Peninsula. He exceeded orders and sustained heavy losses, again garnering a mixture of praise for his military ability and criticism of his headstrong leadership.\n\nIn 1957 he was sent to Staff College in Camberley, England, for officer training. Later he studied part-time at what was then the Tel Aviv branch of the Hebrew University and graduated with a law degree in 1966.\n\nIn late May 1967 Egypt remilitarized the Sinai and declared a blockade against Israeli ships passing through the Strait of Tiran. When the Israeli government appeared to hesitate about its response to Egypt’s actions, Sharon proposed to the chief of staff, Yitzhak Rabin, that the military high command take power and hold the cabinet in detention while the armed forces launched a preemptive attack on Egypt. A few days later, however, the government itself decided to go to war.\n\nSharon, by then a major general, commanded one of three armoured divisions operating against Egypt in the Six-Day War of June 1967. After the Israeli air force destroyed most of Egypt’s warplanes on the ground in the first day of the conflict, Israeli ground forces again swept across the Sinai, where they encountered little opposition. Sharon was hailed as a military hero.\n\nAfter the war, Sharon opposed the construction of the Bar-Lev Line (a chain of fortifications built to defend against Egyptian assault) along the Suez Canal. He favoured a more mobile, activist strategy in the face of Egyptian pinprick attacks, but he was overruled. As General Officer Commanding, Southern Command (1969–72), Sharon held the line against Egypt’s War of Attrition along the Suez Canal. In 1971–72 he was responsible for crushing incipient Palestinian resistance to continued Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip, often resorting to brutal methods."
