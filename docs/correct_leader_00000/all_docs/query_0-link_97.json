        "text": "Contact: Drew Hammill, 202-226-7616\n\nSan Francisco – Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi released the following statement today on the passing of former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon:\n\n\"Prime Minister Ariel Sharon dedicated his life to building, defending, and leading the state of Israel. He was a soldier and an officer, a public servant to his people and a powerful voice for his beliefs and values. Whether you agreed with his policies or opposed his politics, you always knew where he stood, where he intended to direct his troops, where he sought to lead his fellow citizens.\n\n\"In his political career, Sharon always maintained the courage of his convictions. Yet, as times and circumstances changed, he had the courage to alter his course as well. Perhaps in no other area was this characteristic on greater display than in his decision to disengage from the Gaza Strip. It was not a step taken lightly or without concern; it was a difficult choice founded in the same tenet that defined so much of Sharon's career: the national security interest of the people and the nation of Israel.\n\n\"The passing of Ariel Sharon marks the end of an era for Israel's families and communities, and I join with all of them in mourning this loss. I only hope it is a comfort to his wife, his sons, his family and friends that so many share in their grief at this sad time.\"\n\n# # #"
