        "text": "Ariel Sharon's life was intimately entwined with the life of the country he loved from the moment of its birth.\n\nHe fought in its war of independence in 1948 and from that point until he slipped into a coma in 2006 it seemed there was hardly a moment of national drama in which he did not play a role.\n\nHe was always a controversial figure in Israeli politics - certainly not universally loved - but in mourning his passing, Israelis are marking the loss of one of the few public figures left whose career stretched back to the earliest days of their state.\n\nAriel Sharon's roots were in the world of Zionist pioneering zeal - he was born between the two world wars in Palestine when it was under British control - to a Jewish couple who had fled to the Holy Land from Belarus.\n\nHis reputation as an uncompromising and unapologetic defender of his country's interests dates back to his military career.\n\nHe was still a teenager when he fought in the war of 1948 and in his autobiography, fittingly called Warrior, he described intense fighting against soldiers from the Jordanian Arab Legion for control of a crucial police fort on the road between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.\n\nHe and his men lay in fields ignited by gunfire in the burning heat with water and ammunition running low.\n\nHe remained a soldier for many years afterwards, fighting with distinction in Israel's battles with its Arab enemies in the wars of 1967 and 1973.\n\nHe helped set up Unit 101 - a commando detachment whose job was to conduct reprisal operations across the border in Arab territories to retaliate for attacks against Israel.\n\nSuch was his reputation as a military commander that some accounts of his army career say he was nicknamed the Lion of God after a particularly daring tactical parachute operation against Egypt in 1967 in the Sinai desert.\n\nHe was minister of defence when Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982. The strategic goal was to bring stability to the country's northern border by crushing Yasser Arafat's PLO, which was then holed up in southern Lebanon and Beirut.\n\nBut the war was deeply controversial at home as well as in the wider world.\n\nAnd there was worse too.\n\nFighters from a Christian militia group which was co-operating closely with the Israelis carried out extensive massacres in Palestinian refugee camps in Sabra and Shatilla.\n\nIt is likely the names of those camps will be associated with Mr Sharon's own name as long as the history of that conflict is remembered.\n\nEventually an Israeli inquiry held that Ariel Sharon was \"indirectly responsible\" for the killing.\n\nThe war cost many lives - Israeli as well as Palestinian and Lebanese - and it casts a long shadow over his historical legacy.\n\nIn a volatile place, he could be a provocative figure.\n\nIn the year 2000, flanked by hundreds of Israeli riot police, he staged a visit to the area of the Old City in Jerusalem which contains sites sacred both to Jews and Muslims - the Temple Mount or Harem al-Sharif.\n\nEven though the area is in the part of East Jerusalem captured by Israel in the war of 1967, Jewish rights to pray there are limited - and it is a microcosm of the tensions that fuel the dispute between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nIntense rioting followed his visit there and many people trace the outbreak of the second Palestinian intifada to that moment.\n\nAriel Sharon was characteristically unrepentant.\n\nPeace remained elusive then as it is elusive now.\n\nIt was on his watch as prime minister that construction of a barrier began with the intention of preventing suicide attacks on Israel from the Palestinian territories.\n\nHis supporters would argue that it worked. Its detractors would say it entrenched an already deep sense of separateness.\n\nHe did not shy away from bold political moves though. The man who had supported Israeli settlers ordered their removal from Gaza when he decided to withdraw from the Palestinian enclave beside the Mediterranean in 2005.\n\nIt was precisely his reputation as a hardliner that allowed him to sell to his supporters a decision with which many felt instinctively uncomfortable.\n\nNot long afterwards, he slipped into the coma from which he was never to emerge and we will never know how he would have followed up that decision or where it might have led.\n\nAriel Sharon died hated by Israel's enemies but there are plenty of Israelis who would argue that the depth of that hatred was a measure of the success with which he always defended the country he served."
