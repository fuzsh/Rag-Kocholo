He embodied courage and resourcefulness, and served his country with honour and distinction. His passing is a great loss to Israel.\n\nSingapore and Israel enjoy a longstanding friendship. Our ties have been strengthened over time by the efforts of leaders like Mr Sharon. Our thoughts are with you and the people of Israel during your time of sorrow.\n\nWith my deepest sympathies,\n\nLEE HSIEN LOONG"
