        "text": "Like many Israeli former generals, Sharon decided to enter politics. He joined the centre-right Liberal Party and in 1973 played a major role in the Liberals’ agreement with Menachem Begin, leader of the right-wing Herut Party, to form the Likud political bloc.\n\nAt the outset of the Yom Kippur War of October 1973, Sharon was recalled to active military service. On October 16 he led the decisive Israeli counterattack against Egypt westward across the Suez Canal, a battle that marked a turning point in the war. Again Sharon disregarded orders from above (he later claimed that his fellow commanders “had no idea of what [wa]s happening on the ground”), and again a dramatic military victory silenced critics.\n\nIn December 1973 Sharon was elected to the Knesset (the Israeli parliament) for the Likud. In January 1974 he departed the armed forces for politics with a barely veiled denunciation of his fellow generals. The commander in chief, Gen. David Elazar, cancelled his commission, and the army officially termed his statement “an affront to the other commanders” and “a violation of military discipline.” A few months later, however, Elazar himself was severely criticized by a commission of inquiry into the war, and he was compelled to resign from the army. Meanwhile, Sharon, frustrated by opposition politics, resigned from the Knesset in December 1974. Rabin, then prime minister, reappointed Sharon to a reserve command in the army, and in 1975–76 he served as a special counterterrorism adviser to Rabin.\n\nAn attempt by Sharon to win the leadership of the Likud ahead of the May 1977 election was unsuccessful, and he formed a small party of his own, Shlomzion (“Peace in Zion”). Little more than a personal vehicle for Sharon, the party won only two Knesset seats. This election, a watershed in Israeli politics, ended the hegemony of Labour Zionism and brought to power a Likud-dominated coalition government headed by Begin.\n\nThe new prime minister appointed Sharon minister of agriculture. In that position he sponsored the construction of Jewish settlements in occupied Arab territories. A strong opponent of the concept of a Palestinian state, Sharon adopted the slogan “Jordan is Palestine,” endorsing the idea that Jordan—though shorn from the West Bank—might, with its majority Palestinian population, adequately meet Palestinian demands for self-determination. In the 1978 cabinet vote on a proposed peace treaty with Egypt, Sharon registered one of two dissenting votes, but in the subsequent Knesset vote he set aside his objections and voted for approval.\n\nIn June 1981 Begin appointed Sharon minister of defense. In that capacity, in the spring of 1982, he supervised the involuntary evacuation of Israeli settlers in Sinai and the demolition of the settlements prior to the return of the territory to Egypt.\n\nSharon was the principal architect of Israel’s invasion of Lebanon in June 1982, a war that led to the removal from Lebanon of the Palestine Liberation Organization and its armed offshoots. Israeli troops reached Beirut, and a peace treaty was signed between Israel and a new Lebanese government, but the pact was soon disowned by the Lebanese. The conflict exacerbated Lebanon’s long-running civil war, failed to realize Sharon’s broad objectives of creating a new political reality on Israel’s northern frontier, and bogged Israel down in an unproductive 18-year engagement in southern Lebanon.\n\nIn September 1982 militia members of the Phalange (a right-wing Maronite Lebanese group then allied with Israel), acting under an Israeli military umbrella, committed massacres at the Sabra and Shatila Palestinian refugee camps in Israeli-occupied Beirut. As a result, some of Sharon’s enemies dubbed him the “butcher of Beirut.” Widespread public outrage over Sharon’s actions forced the Israeli government to convene a judicial commission of inquiry. Its report, issued in early 1983, was severely critical of Sharon, who was found “indirectly responsible” for the massacres and was declared unfit to retain office as defense minister. Calling the accusations against him a “blood libel,” he accused Begin of handing him over “to the mob.” In February 1983 Sharon very reluctantly resigned.\n\nAlthough it looked to some like the end of Sharon’s career, he nevertheless soon returned to office as minister of industry and trade (1984–90) and minister of construction and housing (1990–92). As holder of the latter portfolio, he continued his earlier policy of promoting intensive Israeli settlement in the occupied territories. In 1996 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu created the cabinet post of minister of national infrastructure for Sharon. Two years later Sharon was named foreign minister, and in 1999 he succeeded Netanyahu as Likud party leader."
