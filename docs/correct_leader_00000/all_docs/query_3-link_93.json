        "text": "Danon was alone with the prime minister in his study on the evening of Dec. 18, 2005. \"I was showing him something, but then he suddenly started to mumble. I realized immediately that he was having a stroke.\"\n\nIt was only a minor stroke, but when doctors examined him afterwards they discovered what was apparently a congenital heart defect, a small hole between the left and right ventricles. Sharon was scheduled for surgery on Jan. 5. On the day before the operation he asked his deputy, Industry Minister Ehud Olmert, to come to his office. Sharon told Olmert that he was going to transfer his official duties to him for three hours on the next day. \"Can I fire everyone?\" Olmert joked. \"Yes,\" Sharon replied, \"but don't touch Marit.\" That evening, Sharon had a second, more severe stroke and fell into a coma, leaving behind a mystery.\n\nHad he simply mellowed into a nice old man? Or had he become politically more moderate? Danon, at any rate, still votes for the left-leaning Meretz Party and not Sharon's Kadima.\n\nThe Political Advisor: Dov Weissglas\n\nIf anyone can address the issue of Sharon's political transformation, it is Dov Weissglas. The 64-year-old, wearing a neatly pressed white shirt and a tie, is early for our scheduled meeting in a café on Rothschild Boulevard in Tel Aviv. His office is around the corner. \"I feel uncomfortable saying this,\" says Weissglas, \"but I'm the one who made Prime Minister Sharon.\"\n\nWhen Weissglas met Sharon in 1982, he was working in the legal department at the Defense Ministry. The young lawyer prepared Sharon's statement before the investigative committee charged with determining who was responsible for the massacre in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. As the investigation dragged on, Weissglas became Sharon's personal attorney.\n\nOn Feb. 21, 1983, Time published an article claiming that Sharon, according to a secret report, had allegedly discussed the \"need for revenge\" against the Palestinians with the Christian Falangists. Weissglas successfully sued the magazine.\n\nEighteen years later, Sharon was looking for someone to head the prime minister's office. The first person in the job had left after a few months. \"Sharon was bursting with self-confidence at the time,\" says Weissglas. \"Even though he was one of the most hated people, he had managed to get himself elected prime minister. Criticism didn't affect him, and neither did praise.\"\n\nWeissglas changed that. \"I taught him that life isn't as dichotomous as he had thought.\"\n\nA Note from Bush\n\nThe advisor paid special attention to relations with the United States. Weissglas proposed a deal to the Americans: Israel would withdraw from the Gaza Strip and, in return, Washington would recognize the large settlements in the West Bank. The US government, sensing that Sharon was merely trying to rid himself of a burden by withdrawing the Gaza settlements, asked him to clear three additional settlement blocks in the West Bank. \"You don't get anything for the Gaza withdrawal,\" Weissglas says, quoting the Americans, \"but for three settlements in the West Bank you'll get a letter from Bush.\"\n\nSharon agreed. On April 14, 2004, the US president gave Sharon his written assurance that the \"facts on the ground\" that had been in place since 1967 would be recognized as part of a peace solution. This was code for the three key settlement blocks, Ariel, Ma'ale Adumim and Gush Etzion. It was Sharon's biggest success.\n\nBut would Sharon really have allowed the Palestinians to form a state? \"Sharon didn't believe that such a state was in Israel's interest. But he understood that it could no longer be prevented. That's why he said to himself: Let's make the best of it.\"\n\nThis change of heart led to the so-called Roadmap for Peace in the Middle East in 2003. It envisioned the creation of a Palestinian state, but it also required the Palestinians to fight terrorism. To marginalize Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Weissglas introduced the idea of a Palestinian prime minister. The post was given to Mahmoud Abbas. When Arafat died, Abbas became president, and Salam Fayyad, an old acquaintance of Weissglas, took his place as prime minister. Today Prime Minister Netanyahu is in peace negotiations with the Abbas/Fayyad duo.\n\nWeissglas doubts that Netanyahu has as much courage as Sharon when it comes to breaking ranks with the hardliners on the right. But even if Netanyahu manages to bring about a peace treaty, Weissglas will be able to say with confidence that Netanyahu merely completed what Sharon began.\n\nThe Personal Physician: Dr. Shlomo Segev\n\nDr. Shlomo Segev has known his patient for more than 10 years. They met in 2000, when Sharon's wife Lili was on her deathbed. \"He sat at her bed for hours. He didn't do anything. He was just there for her,\" says Segev.\n\nLili Sharon died shortly before Sharon became prime minister. He had never had a personal doctor, but it was a requirement for the head of state, and Segev became his official physician. \"He wasn't interested in medicine,\" says Segev. \"He thought it was superfluous.\"\n\nSharon regularly invited the doctor to his ranch, not for his health but because he wanted company.\n\nNo Never\n\n\"Arik never pretended to be sick, but he would take advantage of every little cold to talk to me. I came, examined him and then we went to the table. We ate and talked, often for hours. The food played a central role in our conversations.\"\n\nEven today, when Segev returns from a trip, he goes to Sharon's room and tells him about the restaurants he went to and the food he ate.\n\nHow much of this is Sharon aware of? \"When you say his name, he senses that someone is there,\" says Segev. \"And when you walk around his bed, you have the feeling that he's following you with his eyes.\" He reacts to pain, such as when someone presses against his hand. He has received oxygen treatment to reactivate his brain.\n\nWhat are the chances that he will wake up from the coma? \"The statistics aren't his favor,\" says Segev. \"But medicine is like love: There is no 'never' and no 'always'.\""
