        "text": "Israeli general Ariel Sharon stands on the right bank of the Suez Canal in January 1974, just a few days before leaving the army to become a right-wing politician.\n\nA maverick both in war and in politics, and a divisive figure in his homeland, Sharon was a commander in the army since the birth of Israel in 1948, and later the prime minister who would pull out of Gaza.\n\nFamously overweight, he suffered a stroke that put him into a coma in 2006, when he was at the height of his power. He died on Saturday, January 11, 2014, without ever apparently regained consciousness.\n\n1955\n\nAriel Sharon briefs his unit before an operation in Khan Younis, Aug. 30, 1955.\n\nSharon was born to Russian immigrant parents on Feb. 26, 1928, in the small farming community of Kfar Malal, north of Tel Aviv. He joined the Haganah, the pre-state Jewish defense force, at 14 and later went on to command an infantry platoon during the 1948 Mideast war over Israel's creation. He was seriously wounded in battle with the Jordanian Legion over control of the road to Jerusalem.\n\nBy 1953 he was commanding Unit 101, a commando force formed to carry out reprisals for Arab attacks.\n\n1955\n\nAriel Sharon, standing second left, poses with military commanders including Moshe Dayan, center, Oct. 28, 1955.\n\nIn 1956 Sharon was rebuked for engaging in what his commanders regarded as an unnecessary battle with Egyptian forces in which some 30 Israeli soldiers died.
