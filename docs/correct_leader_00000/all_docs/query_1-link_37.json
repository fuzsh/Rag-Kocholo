        "text": "Ariel Sharon sits in the kitchen of the prime minister’s official residence in Jerusalem, sipping tea with saccharin, fishing an occasional cashew out of a bowl of mixed nuts, and smiling. The news outside, as usual, is horrible: barely an hour earlier and a few miles away, a Palestinian from Hebron sprayed gunfire at a city bus, injuring 46 and killing two schoolchildren, whose happy faces will inevitably appear on the front pages of tomorrow’s Israeli papers. Outside Sharon’s window, sirens sound, and in Israel more than in most places, people take sirens personally. Two aides hand Sharon the latest details of the shooting, which he peruses briefly and then moves on; after 50 years of death, dodging it or meting it out or dealing with it, he takes it all in stride. Ask him about even the most serious topic—how the state of Israel has evolved, the persistence of terror, the manipulations of his political rivals, his family history, his relations with the two George Bushes (everything, in short, but Yasser Arafat)—and the famously ferocious Sharon will manage a chuckle.\n\nAt 73 years old, eight months into his utterly improbable tenure as Israel’s leader, Ariel Sharon is plagued with problems. He promised to bring peace and security, and he has produced neither. Israel not only remains at war; by Sharon’s own lights, peace with the Arabs is more distant now than it was 53 years ago, when Israel won its independence. Israelis continue to die in suicide bombings and bus shootings and drive-by killings, and Arafat refuses either to punish those responsible or to hand them over to Israel. Israeli troops are mired in several West Bank cities they were supposed never to see again; Israeli operatives conduct a wave of “targeted killings” of Palestinian activists. Relations with the United States have been rocky since Sharon, perturbed by U.S. efforts to include Israel’s enemies in the American anti-Taliban coalition, at least implicitly likened George W. Bush’s actions to Neville Chamberlain’s appeasement of the Nazis.\n\nBut despite the bullets, metaphorical and real, flying all around him, Sharon is contented, almost mellow, even jolly. He has found peace with at least one entity in the Middle East: himself. He has achieved his life’s goal of becoming prime minister. He knows what he wants and can put everything, including all the tragedies and criticism, into perspective. This is apparently what can happen when a man forever dissatisfied with everyone else, including most of Israel’s important historical figures, is finally in charge, when the most vilified, polarizing, demonized person in Israeli history—someone who once asked the Anti-Defamation League to help him because he was the most defamed minister in the Israeli government—is suddenly among the most appreciated.\n\nTo Israelis, Sharon is the man of the hour. With the 1993 Oslo Middle East peace accords in tatters, he seems to embody their fears, their ambivalence, their anger, their hesitancy, and, lurking somewhere in the mix, their remaining modicum of hope. With Hitler having murdered many of Israel’s grandparents, and after the disastrous, short-lived tenures of his two youngish, unseasoned predecessors, Benjamin “Bibi” Netanyahu and Ehud Barak, Sharon, one of the last living links to Israel’s founding fathers, satisfies a deep-seated national longing for gray hair. Having cobbled together a broad unity government, he has brought weary Israelis a welcome respite from perpetual partisanship. And after several years under an Americanized Madison Avenue import (Bibi) and a political work in progress (Barak), he comes to the job fully formed, refreshingly real, recognizable. In short, he is himself.\n\nSharon has spent a lifetime bending the truth, crossing lines, going too far, ticking off or taking on nearly everyone he has encountered: his childhood playmates, his fellow army officers, his political colleagues, foreign leaders, the press. That was certainly true on September 28, 2000, when, with peace talks in the balance, he traipsed around one of Islam’s most sacred sites, the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, an event that apparently did not cause the second intifada—it had already been brewing—but certainly provided an excuse for it. “Human relations is not his outstanding trait,” Henry Kissinger says. Similarly, nearly 20 years ago an Israeli commission found Sharon, then defense minister, “indirectly responsible”—by failing to safeguard against it—for the horrific 1982 massacre of more than 800 Palestinians by Israel’s Lebanese Christian allies at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps during Sharon’s star-crossed military campaign in Lebanon. That experience should have ended his political career. Instead, Sharon proved astonishingly resilient, even indispensable.\n\nNot only does Sharon have a heap of trouble on his doorstep, but, as the political columnists Nahum Barnea and Shimon Schiffer wrote recently in Yediot Aharonot, Israel’s largest daily newspaper, there is a long line of people who covet his job. Sharon has always been a political party of one, without colleagues or heirs or disciples. Impervious to criticism, convinced he’s always right, he needs little vindication. Still, for someone who has spent much of his political life either in the wilderness or the woodshed or waiting in the wings, this turn of events is very sweet indeed. “I’m not sure how much he enjoys the job, but when he looks at the line of people who want it, he enjoys it very much,” says Barnea, the dean of Israel’s political analysts.\n\nIn the venomous and volatile world of Israeli politics, all this could quickly change. Sharon’s coalition, comprising his own, right-of-center Likud Party and its arch-rival, the moderate-left Labor Party, along with a host of smaller groups, is as fragile as George Bush’s; too great a lunge toward either war or peace could sink it. Sharon’s survival strategy thus far has been to do almost nothing, and it’s worked. But it’s unclear how long that can last. In the meantime, a familiar face is breathing down his neck, threatening to take over Sharon’s party: Netanyahu.\n\nIn Ha’aretz, the Israeli equivalent of The New York Times, columnist Doron Rosenblum recently characterized Sharon’s record as “not just failure, but failure multiplied: no hope, no prospects, no security, no peace, no economic growth, no nothing. Only blood, flowing like water.” Why, then, does Sharon enjoy a 55 percent approval rating in a recent Israeli Gallup poll? Rosenblum offered three reasons: first, Arafat is Arafat, making any Israeli leader look reasonable; second, Sharon, while lacking his predecessors’ talents (creativity, daring, the ability to reduce terror and inspire hope), also lacks their flaws (arrogance, charlatanism, naïveté); and, finally, Sharon “is the first prime minister in many long years who is not being attacked and battered by the interminable reproaches, conspiracies, pressures, and provocation of Ariel Sharon.”\n\nMany of Sharon’s harshest critics come from his old allies on the Israeli right, who gripe that Israel isn’t getting the genuine Sharon these days but some weak, emasculated imitation. Outside Israel, the notion of Sharon MICHA BAR’AM suddenly going soft seems absurd. But to these critics he is almost a Lear-like figure, aged and failing, more eager to be loved than feared, traumatized into impotence by the grievous Israeli losses during the 1982 Lebanese war, and led around by manipulative advisers, among them his 37-year-old son, Omri.\n\nMICHA BAR’AM\n\nInstead of the Sharon of old, who would have “screwed the Arabs,” there is old Sharon, the critics say. “He is crippled by the Lebanon legacy,” says Michael Kleiner, a member of the Knesset, Israel’s parliament. “You cannot take a crippled man and put him in as prime minister.” After Israel’s tourism minister—Sharon’s old army comrade Rehavam Ze’evi—was slain by Palestinian terrorists in October, Ze’evi’s middle-aged son, Yiftach-Palmach, made the same point, with Sharon standing nearby. “And you, Arik [Sharon’s nickname], such a close friend of Dad’s from the beginning, avenge him as he would have avenged you!” he said to the prime minister, with great ardor and thinly veiled rage. “Lead us like you used to.”\n\nConversely, Sharon has won over, or at least mollified, some of his harshest detractors, primarily to the left. They, too, say they are not getting the undiluted Sharon, but they feel relieved rather than short-changed. Sharon, they believe, has matured, grown into his job, toned himself down. In other words, he could have been much worse. I ask Uzi Benziman, a columnist at Ha’aretz and author of the 1985 biography Sharon: An Israeli Caesar (literal translation of the Hebrew title: “He Doesn’t Stop at Red Lights”), whether Sharon has turned out to be as bad as he had feared. “I have to admit, the answer is ‘No,’” he replies.\n\nI put the question to Sharon himself: Is there a new Arik Sharon? “No, the same Arik, the same Arik,” he replies. “I’m in a place where I have to take into consideration many other things. It’s a complicated situation, very, very complicated.” To the hardliners, he pleads for the moderation he rarely showed to others before he took the reins. “All those ideas that you can come and destroy! And attack! How many times can you do it? Once? Twice? The fight against terror has lasted more than 120 years,” since Jews began colonizing Palestine in large numbers. But when it comes to his critics, Sharon generally doesn’t give a damn.\n\n“Look, you have to understand one thing: I’m 73 years old,” he continues, with another laugh. “I’m not depending upon anyone; as a matter of fact, you have to know, my strengths never came from [having a] political apparatus. I had, of course, a lot of support: one could have seen it in the last elections. But it came entirely from different things: from my family, from home, from the fields, from the land, from the earth that I can touch and feel, from the flowers and the beauty of the terrain and things I love, like music.”\n\nSharon is not a brilliant man. Rarely is one impressed by the depth or subtlety of his mind. His worldview is simple; so are his tastes. Whatever happens, he can go back to his beloved ranch in the Negev, an hour’s drive south of Tel Aviv, and work with his cattle, ride horses, take out his tractor. “You know why they never managed to overcome me?” he asks. “I can feel the earth between my fingers.”\n\nIt is a pleasure Sharon has enjoyed since his childhood on another farm, at Kfar Malal, 15 miles northeast of Tel Aviv. He was born there to Russian Jewish immigrants (the family name was originally Scheinerman) in 1928. Kfar Malal, a commune, or moshav, of about 40 families, has since been swallowed up by sprawl and history. When the narrow sandy path that cut through it was paved over and widened, the stately casuarina trees alongside had to be chopped down. So different does it all look now that when Sharon last visited he missed the turnoff.\n\nSharon’s boyhood house still stands, though what was once a simple wooden structure has grown into something more suburban and prosperous. It now belongs to Omri, who rents it out to friends. The cows and chickens are long gone, and the orange trees that Sharon’s cantankerous, independent father coaxed out of the sandy soil are now gnarled, desiccated things, something from late van Gogh. Sharon’s mother, an intellectual who provided for their perpetual care in her will, would be horrified were she to see them. Sharon himself seems mildly disturbed by the news and says he will ask Omri to check into the matter.\n\nFor all that’s changed there, Kfar Malal is still the key to Sharon’s psyche: it explains his love of the land, his obsession with security, his attitude toward the Arabs, his lifelong status as a loner. The irascible nonconformity of his father—the first in the communal village to put a fence around his house—left Sharon an outcast, carrying around a club to protect himself from other children. That explains his aggressiveness and taste for the military life. The moshav is also responsible for Sharon’s famous gluttony and generous girth: his Spartan diet there, consisting largely of peanuts and yams, left him with a yen for rich food and a life-long desire to make up for lost meals. It explains, too, his proprietary attitude toward the West Bank of the Jordan River, which he could see from the farm and which Israel would come to occupy in 1967. From his earliest days, Sharon looked out at the West Bank, sometimes longingly, sometimes apprehensively: at 13, armed with his club and an engraved Caucasian dagger he’d gotten for his Bar Mitzvah, he began guarding against Arab intruders.\n\nStanding by the dying orchard, you can see not just the Arab villages from which marauding gangs occasionally came, but also Alshei Menasche, one of the red-roofed Jewish settlements that Sharon planted nearby. Climb the silo across the path and you see the Palestinian town of Qalqiliya, reoccupied until recently by Israeli troops. The bullets and shells fired there can’t reach Kfar Malal, but the sounds of them can, and do.\n\nSharon wanted to be a farmer; in 1947 he enrolled in an agronomy program at Hebrew University. But wars, declared and undeclared, changed all that. In the War of Independence he led a platoon. In the early 1950s he formed and commanded the famed and often controversial anti-terrorism Unit 101, in which he both dazzled his superiors with his courage and tactical genius and alarmed them with his impudence, duplicity, violence, and indifference to life, at least that of Arab civilians; in one raid, on the Jordanian village of Qibya, around 70 Arabs, half of them women and children, were killed. Israel’s leaders weren’t quite sure what to do with their strategically brilliant but dangerous son. “I’d rather have spirited horses than lazy bulls,” Moshe Dayan, the famous Israeli general and politician, said of him. Israel’s first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, complained once that Sharon the anti-terrorist was “too successful.” Ben-Gurion had other misgivings as well: “If only he would be cured of his weakness of not speaking the truth, and he would steer clear of gossip, he could be an exemplary military leader,” he wrote of Sharon in his diary. But it was Ben-Gurion who viewed the young man as the archetypal new Israeli and urged him to assume the Hebrew name “Sharon,” which is what the country’s verdant midsection (where Kfar Malal is located) is called.\n\nIn the 1956 war with Egypt, Sharon outraged his superiors by ordering an advance into the Mitla Pass, costing dozens of Israeli lives. But in 1967 he led a famously successful tank attack against the Egyptians, and during the Yom Kippur War six years later he staged what became a storied tank counteroffensive across the Suez Canal. Despite Sharon’s triumphs, his fellow officers, believing him reckless and untrustworthy, maneuvered constantly to marginalize him or run him out of the army altogether. They were jealous, Sharon insists. Off the field, too, his life was tumultuous. In 1962 his first wife, Margalit, the mother of his eldest son, Gur, died in a car crash. Sharon and Margalit’s younger sister, Lily, married a year later and had two sons, Omri and Gilad. In 1967, Gur, then 10 years old, was shot to death while he and a friend were playing with one of the Sharon family’s rifles. Precisely what happened that day has never been made clear.\n\nWhen his army career ended, Sharon entered politics, helping to form the Likud and making it Israel’s first real opposition party to the entrenched Labor Party. Menachem Begin, who in 1977 became the Likud’s first prime minister, named Sharon minister of agriculture. It was then that Sharon began planting settlements up and down the occupied territories, placing most of them on the rocky, unpopulated hillsides of the West Bank, the better to defend Israel’s vulnerable coastal plain. Sharon’s purpose was military, but his fervor was religious; he erected 64 of them in four years.\n\nIn 1981, Begin—who once called Sharon “our Hannibal”—named him minister of defense. It was in that capacity that Sharon led Israel into its most controversial and unpopular war, in Lebanon. Originally, the objectives were modest: to march far enough into the country to clear away Palestinian terrorists who were shelling Israel’s northern villages. But it mushroomed into something much larger; people still debate whether Sharon acted on his own or with Begin’s approval. Israeli soldiers eventually occupied Beirut, but sustained enormous losses doing so. Meantime, Israel’s Lebanese Christian allies entered the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila, ostensibly to root out terrorists, and murdered more than 800 people, nearly all civilians.\n\nTo Sharon, the massacre was utterly unanticipated. To his detractors, it was eminently predictable, and they branded him a war criminal. A special government commission assigned to investigate landed somewhere in the middle, concluding that, while Sharon played no role in the killings, he should have anticipated them. (Time magazine later accused Sharon of orchestrating the massacre; Sharon sued it for libel and forced the magazine to acknowledge that it wasn’t true.) The commission suggested that Sharon resign, which he reluctantly did. To him, the episode amounted to a political lynching, another in a long series of attempts by his rivals to bring him down. Sharon’s supporters still feel that way.\n\n“When an outstanding figure stands 10 feet tall, he arouses jealousy automatically,” says Uri Dan, the New York Post’s longtime Middle Eastern correspondent and for more than 40 years Sharon’s greatest champion. “Maybe it’s human nature, and when it comes to Jews, it’s a hundred times more. And when someone casts a shadow on your own ambitions, then jealousy turns to hatred.” In 1973, after then major general Sharon was passed over as army chief of staff, Dan made a prediction. “Those who rejected him as chief of staff will get him in due time as defense minister,” he said. “And those who will reject him as defense minister will get him as prime minister.”\n\nBy 1984, Sharon was back in government, this time at the invitation of Prime Minister Shimon Peres. By 1990 he was minister of housing and infrastructure, building homes (largely for Russian immigrants) and, predictably, more settlements. Sharon’s policies complicated the first Bush administration’s peace efforts in the Middle East so much that then secretary of state James Baker discouraged officials from holding formal meetings with Sharon; when HUD secretary Jack Kemp saw him, it had to be in the Israeli Embassy. Sharon won’t say much about the senior George Bush. For Bush the younger, to whom he gave a guided tour of Israel by helicopter when Dubya was still governor of Texas, he has only praise: “Clear, straight, understands, and friendly. Determined. And friendly.”\n\nMost people who know Sharon like him, with those who see him up closest—secretaries, security guards—liking him most. He is forever surprising people: Shirley MacLaine, who visited Sharon’s ranch once, recalls how he baked bread, joked with his farmhands, and called all of his plants and animals by name. “He was personally involved with every living thing,” says MacLaine, who describes Sharon as a “big Old Testament professor” and a “mensch.” “I sort of sat with my mouth open for two days, because this was not how I thought a hawk should act.” But in the early 1990s, when his Likud Party was in the opposition, his public image—contentious and harsh, associated only with settlements and terrorism—needed an overhaul. Sharon began granting more interviews. He also went on television and cracked jokes. “Suddenly people said, ‘Wait! He’s a human! He laughs like us! He’s warm!’” recalls Sharon’s longtime media adviser, Shia Segal. Helping matters was that Sharon’s perpetual critics on the left had found themselves a new whipping boy: Netanyahu. “Bibi was painted as an artificial American package, and the Israelis, center and left, disliked him,” recalls Reuven Adler, who produced Sharon’s ads for the last campaign. “Arik needed a Bibi to become Arik.”\n\nThis new, friendly Sharon flummoxed the critics. “I think he’s a war criminal, but I could see how you could forget what this person stands for and be conquered by his charisma,” says Avi Mograbi, an Israeli filmmaker whose 1997 documentary, How I Learned to Overcome My Fear and Love Arik Sharon, depicts how Sharon had charmed Mograbi while campaigning for Bibi the previous year. (It was not an easy task; praising Bibi, Sharon once complained, was like “swallowing a frog.”) “I wanted to [show] the monster who lives inside his big body,” says Mograbi, “and it turned out that the monster never peeped out.”\n\nDespite Sharon’s efforts on his behalf, Netanyahu promptly shut him out of his Cabinet. Within two years, however, Sharon was back yet again, this time as foreign minister. When Barak beat Netanyahu in 1999 and Bibi temporarily withdrew from public life, Sharon took over the Likud. And when Bibi, holding out for Knesset elections that never came, declined to run earlier this year, Sharon became the Likud standard-bearer. With an assist from Arafat, who’d countered Barak’s unprecedentedly generous peace offer with another intifada, Sharon won overwhelmingly. Even Barak, who had tried repeatedly to recruit Sharon for a government of national unity, recognized his appeal. “Take care of him,” he urged Sharon aide Ra’anan Gissin a few months before the election. “We need him.”\n\n‘No one can preach to me about peace,” Sharon says, noting his years of combat, of watching fellow soldiers die, of suffering injuries himself. “I understand the importance of peace better than many or most of the politicians who have never seen these experiences.” But his capacity and inclination to make peace, like much else about him, are in dispute. A large man, Sharon inspires comparisons to large historical figures. Supporters see in him a potential de Gaulle, the general strong enough to end France’s war with Algeria. Detractors see a von Hindenburg, the general who, old and infirm, brought disaster to Germany.\n\nAll across the Israeli political spectrum, no one can divine Sharon’s intentions. There is talk of the “Sharon of the gut” and the “Sharon of the head,” the two perpetually at war. “Even for me he is an enigma; I don’t know his real intentions,” says Yossi Sarid, who, as leader of the left-wing Meretz Party, now commands Sharon’s feeble opposition. “Sometimes I think he has no idea what he’s going to do tomorrow, and sometimes I suspect he has a master plan. I don’t know whether from the very beginning he meant to bring Yasser Arafat to the point of collapse or not.”\n\nA minority sees Sharon’s government as one not just of national unity but also of individual rehabilitation. According to this theory, Sharon and his foreign minister, Shimon Peres, are two old men in search of redemption: the former for the carnage, Israeli and perhaps Arab, in Lebanon, the latter, as one of the principal architects of the foundering Oslo accords, for being, among other things, too naïve. Peace would be the ultimate vindication for both of them. While Sharon built the settlements, it is noted, he is also the only person ever to dismantle one: Yamit, a small community that Israel evacuated and destroyed upon leaving the Sinai in 1982.\n\nMany people, however, see Sharon as strictly a transitional figure, too hidebound, too suspicious, too circumscribed politically to do anything too dramatic. True, another right-wing leader, Menachem Begin, made peace with Egypt. But Begin was at heart a lawyer. “With all the awful experiences of the Jews, Begin had a deep belief in people, in truth, in keeping agreements,” one Knesset member tells me. “To Sharon the world is not run by agreements. The real thing is strength.”\n\nThat’s certainly how Saeb Erakat, minister of local government and chief negotiator for the Palestinian Authority, evaluates Sharon. “Many people said, ‘O.K., now he will do it, he wants to end his life by being a peacemaker,’” he tells me. “I heard some top American officials, European officials, some Arab officials even, saying that, and, honest to God, I could not help myself but laugh. Because in the United States I think there is a saying: You cannot teach an old dog new tricks.” Convinced Israel can’t exist without external enemies, he says, Sharon has spent his life fomenting fear. “The man is not about politics, is not about winning or losing the elections. The man is doing it out of his conviction, ideological conviction. He doesn’t believe that Israel needs peace; Israel needs to be strong, to be united. And stronger than all Arabs combined.”\n\nI spoke to Erakat in Jericho, a short drive and a world away from Jerusalem, past the modern mega-settlement of Ma’ale Adumim and through the timeless moonscape of the West Bank. Ten years ago Jericho was a hopeful place, filled with roadside shops and Palestinian flags. Today, after a year’s worth of the intifada, it is a ghost town, brightened only by bougainvillea. The Oasis, the casino where Palestinians exacted a small measure of revenge on their former occupiers by fleecing them, has been shuttered for a year; 25 restaurants have also closed. “Let’s say Arafat is a terrorist, but Sharon is a butcher,” my Palestinian driver had said en route. “Between a terrorist and a butcher, it’s not so easy to make peace.” Another driver put it even more grimly: soon Arabs would no longer dip their bread in olive oil, then zaatar (a tangy powder of oregano, thyme, marjoram, and sesame seeds), but in blood, then sand.\n\n“Maybe a Palestinian like me cannot be objective in analyzing this phenomenon called Sharon,” Erakat continues over Turkish coffee with cardamom, as noontime chants from the nearby mosque fill the air. He speaks of the massacres, the intransigence, and, above all, the settlements: “What he was doing [in the 80s] was putting obstacles in the face of my generation of Palestinians who are convinced that we must recognize Israel and must live side by side with Israel and we must reach an agreement with Israel.”\n\nOddly enough, the settlers themselves are also unhappy with Sharon. In the Jerusalem offices of the Yesha Council, the settlers’ organization, hangs an Israeli Army map of the West Bank, distinguishing those roads that are ostensibly safe (in blue) from those that are not (in red). For even on the blue highways, Palestinians are shooting and killing Israelis, and, according to settlers, Sharon is not doing enough to stop them. “Some days he wakes up in a very Jewish mood and wants to protect the Jews,” says Karny Eldad of the council. “Other days he wakes up in an Arabic mood, or a pro-U.S.A. mood, and wants to hear what the world thinks about our living here, instead of taking care of us living here.”\n\nWhile Sharon is having problems with his core constituency, he is picking up support in unlikely quarters. This I learned one afternoon in Tel Aviv, at a reunion of regiment 890, the paratroopers who’d served under him in the 1956 war with Egypt. Apart from being the shortest soldiers I’d ever seen, they were the best preserved. They were the Israelis of lore, Zionism’s answer to the hothouse, bookish, defenseless Jews of the Diaspora. Like Sharon, they grew up on communal farms, singing, “How good and pleasant it is when brothers sit together.” And like Sharon’s, too, theirs are the faces of an older, more cohesive, more elite, and more secular Israel.\n\nThese soldiers, like Sharon, were raised as socialists, went into the army, then graduated to the Labor Party; unlike him, they remained there. They fault Sharon for his recklessness as an officer—referring, presumably, to his notorious order to enter the Mitla Pass in 1956. Forty-five years later, when Sharon ran for prime minister, most did not vote for him. But, pleasantly surprised by his moderation, most say they are with him now. One observes, approvingly, that Sharon has belatedly discovered first gear. Another says Sharon has finally learned the difference between hectoring from a balcony and holding the harness.\n\nLike the paratroopers, the people who have stayed at Kfar Malal, Sharon’s birthplace, would probably not normally support him. But here, too, he’s won over some of the skeptics. Joseph Margalit, 76, who grew up with Sharon and became the commune’s resident historian, says that Israel’s current crop of leaders have little in common with the statesmen who preceded them. But among contemporary politicians, he says, Sharon stands out, at least a bit. “Now all the grove is small trees, and one is a little higher. And this is Arik Sharon.”\n\nEven if Sharon wanted to make peace, a large bloc of legislators would stand in his way. Should the killings continue, one close friend of Sharon’s told me, he could well try to crush the Palestinian Authority, reoccupy the territories, and expel Arafat. It is a scenario the Bush administration is well aware of, says this friend, because both he and Sharon believe that American officials listen in on the phone calls Sharon makes from his ranch. In any case, Arafat has so lowered Israeli expectations that Sharon faces no groundswell to do anything very dramatic very soon. Quite the contrary: any significant move to the left or right would imperil his ramshackle coalition. Up to a point, then, every Palestinian bomb buys Sharon more time. “He’s the default option; there’s no real alternative,” says Ari Shavit, a columnist for Ha’aretz.\n\nSharon says he will seek another term in November 2003, but the Likud could easily drop him, either then or before. While Netanyahu, who has built his career sounding bellicose about terrorism and has faulted Sharon for his leniency, has legions of enemies and doubters, he has one great advantage: at 52 he probably has a long political future before him. He will be around for many years after Sharon leaves the scene, something that self-interested politicians will not overlook.\n\nA mid all of the confusion about who Sharon is and what he intends, even a brief time with him is a clarifying experience. His confidence, his vehemence, the way he personalizes his points, his transparency (one can almost see the convictions working their way up from his gut), all suggest how genuinely unyielding he is. Repeatedly offered chances to sound open-minded or conciliatory, he invariably just swats them away. The phrase with which Justice Clarence Thomas has regaled his acolytes could easily be spoken by Sharon: “I ain’t evolving!”\n\nTake Arafat, with whom Sharon has yet to meet since taking office, though the Palestinian leader called to congratulate him on the birth of twin grandsons and to wish him a happy Passover. Sharon has apparently dropped “our bin Laden” from his arsenal of epithets for him, but other choice terms—such as “murderer”—remain. “I know who is Arafat,” he tells me. “I never changed my mind. Maybe I changed my words, but I’ve not changed my mind.” When the two met in 1998, during negotiations at the Wye River Summit in Maryland, Sharon refused to shake Arafat’s outstretched hand, forcing Arafat to switch hastily to a salute. “It’s very hard for us living in Western society and democratic countries even to realize that he looks into your eyes and lies,” Sharon says. “Lies. It’s an empire of lies.” About 20 years ago in Beirut, Sharon recalls, an Israeli soldier had the Palestinian leader in his cross-hairs. But he didn’t shoot—it would have violated the cease-fire—and now, Sharon says, that was probably too bad; a more pragmatic Palestinian leader might have emerged.\n\nSharon says it is premature even to discuss the fate of the settlements until a final agreement is reached. But once that happens, he maintains, there will be no reason to do so: if Jews and Arabs can coexist in Israel, why can’t they on the West Bank? The 1982 dismantling of Yamit, Sharon stresses, was an exception: for one thing, it was in the Sinai, which, unlike the West Bank, was never part of biblical Israel. Israel’s only mistake in building on the West Bank lay, he says, in failing to stress the land’s historic and religious (as well as its strategic) significance, something that would have made Israelis cling to that land even more tenaciously. Sharon still regards the settlers as pioneers, worthy heirs to the people—his own parents among them—who chose to build up the land of Israel rather than sip coffee in Tel Aviv.\n\nSharon even spurns the chance to play de Gaulle. “I have full respect for his achievements, but there is a tremendous difference between Israel and France and Algeria or Samaria and Judaea,” he declares, using the biblical names for the West Bank and pounding the table for emphasis. “We live in ‘Algeria’ here. That’s the difference. We don’t have anywhere to go.”\n\nIn late October, under a chuppah of blue cloth and evergreen trees near Mount Herzl National Cemetery in Jerusalem, the great trauma of modern Israel was being revisited. Six years had passed since Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin had been assassinated by a right-wing Jewish law student intent on halting the peace process, and some things had changed: Leah Rabin, the slain prime minister’s widow, now lay next to her husband; Noa Ben-Artzi Pelossof, the teenager who gave a much-commented-upon, heart-wrenching eulogy for her grandfather, is a woman now, wearing her hair frosted and smoking cigarettes like an old pro. But the wound left by the killing, so slow to heal, has been torn open anew by the intifada. This year’s guests at the annual memorial were mourning not just Rabin but the entire peace process.\n\nIn the two front rows, closest to Rabin’s grave, sat most of Israel’s political establishment, including Ariel Sharon. There was Peres and Barak. To Barak’s left sat Avraham Burg, who might challenge Sharon for the top job should he take over the decimated Labor Party. The famously secular Yossi Sarid sat alongside the elaborately robed Sephardic chief rabbi, Eliahu Bakshi-Doron. To Sharon’s right was Chief Justice Aharon Barak, who served on the commission that censured Sharon for Sabra and Shatila. Just about the only missing notable was Netanyahu, who, as is often true these days, was abroad. (“Bibi lives in America and does his laundry in Israel,” as one Israeli diplomat recently put it.)\n\nSharon, like Netanyahu, had bitterly denounced Rabin; when Rabin was burned in effigy by right-wing protesters in Jerusalem’s Zion Square, Sharon had reportedly been on hand. But Sharon and Rabin, veterans of communal agricultural pasts and the upper reaches of the Israeli Army, belong to the same exclusive Israeli club, and of Sharon the Rabins were more forgiving. Rabin’s daughter, Dalia Rabin-Pelossof, is deputy defense minister in Sharon’s government; after making his remarks and observing the Jewish tradition of laying a pebble on the grave, Sharon kissed Rabin-Pelossof on both cheeks.\n\nBefore and during the ceremony, Sharon said nothing to anyone, even to his chief aide, Uri Shani, who sat beside him. Watching the proceedings, Sharon seemed disengaged and passive, like an old, contented animal. His massive farmer’s arms, which bypass the wrists and merge into his hands, did not budge. He moved only to blink his eyes and, when the time came, to read his speech. He did so mechanically, and when it was all over, he walked away silently, with his shambling gait.\n\nIt is to this Sharon that disgruntled right-wingers point. Few expected him to bring peace; if Barak, who offered the Palestinians far more than Sharon would ever dream of doing, couldn’t pull it off, Sharon surely couldn’t. But they had counted on security. Instead, the number of victims—measured by statistics such as “terrorist deaths per month”—has doubled. Some Sharon critics say that without his beloved wife, Lily, who died last year, he has grown more susceptible to persons with their own more liberal, less resolutely antiterrorist agendas. One culprit is Peres, long the bête noire of the Israeli right. Sharon and Peres are the old married couple of Israeli politics. Their careers intertwine like two thick, twisted branches of wisteria, going back to the days of Ben-Gurion; their relationship is a complex amalgam of camaraderie, admiration, disdain, condescension, dependence, shared history, and mutual manipulation.\n\nThe elegant and suave Peres, a Europeanized Israeli, who served as prime minister three times but never managed to get elected to the post, surely considers Sharon a kind of ruffian, someone who sees the world through the sight of a weapon. Peres is a Utopian thinker, who envisions a Middle East without borders, one in which Arabs and Jews intermingle freely and tackle their joint problems together. Conversely, Sharon considers Peres a luftmensch, a dreamer. “The old stupid guy of the ‘New Middle East,’” he once called him. But they also respect each other, and, in the way of dance-marathon partners, are propping one another up. Sharon has given the 78-year-old Peres a last tour on the world stage, and a final chance to salvage some semblance of Oslo; Peres has given Sharon a broad coalition and helped neutralize his war-mongering image.\n\nWhile placards at a recent right-wing demonstration declared PERES = HERES (Hebrew for disaster), Sharon dutifully refers to him as “my friend.” Approach Peres about Sharon, though, and he’s strangely testy. After oozing charm recently before an adoring crowd at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York—Peres is another of those Israeli politicians, like Netanyahu, who comes to America for succor—he recoiled when asked about Sharon. “I don’t want to make any personal comments,” he huffed. (At times, their relationship has become almost comical, particularly when Sharon decrees whether Peres can meet with Arafat, and where, and how often, and what they can discuss, and for how long. Sharon recently felt compelled to assure Likud skeptics that Peres could never strike some deal with Arafat behind his back—Israeli intelligence would find out and inform him.)\n\n“Peres is a very smart man,” Yehoshoua Mor Yossef, of Yesha, the council of Jewish settlers, tells me. “If you only let him prepare the tea in the prime minister’s office, he’s going to be the man who controls it.” Also implicated in the “Who Lost Sharon?” puzzle is his chief aide, Uri Shani, and, more critically, Sharon’s son Omri. To conservative politicians Omri is an ambitious closet moderate, entirely too at home in Tel Aviv nightclubs and yuppie-ish political circles, pulling his father to the left and, in the meantime, feathering his own political nest. Ariel Sharon has had Omri meet with Arafat three times, presumably because he didn’t trust anyone else. To many Israelis, such nepotism is not just unappealing; worse, it’s what a corrupt Arab regime would do. “Sharon has a lot of credit in Israeli history, and it’s very sad to see the situation he’s now in,” says Israel Katz, a Likud member of the Knesset.\n\nChemi Shalev, a reporter for Ma’ariv who appears frequently on CNN, tells me that a year ago he actually saw the befuddled, obsessive, perseverating Sharon his critics describe. “He seemed very tired, out of focus. I wouldn’t say ‘senile,’ but showing his age,” says Shalev. But all that, he says, has since changed: “Obviously the responsibility and the lofty office have sort of re-invigorated him.” Sharon certainly seems alert and vigorous to me. He appears a bit trimmer than in his portly past, perhaps because he’s more disciplined; rather than wolfing down the cakes and cookies before us, he eats only an occasional nut from the bowl. Is he still up to his taxing job? “It’s better if you would discuss this with my medical doctor—if I had one,” he replies with a laugh.\n\nSharon says he is not overly dependent on Omri, though he acknowledges that his family is unusually close. (His youngest son, Gilad, who is in his mid-30s, runs the day-to-day operations of the family ranch.) Sharon has tried to make light of the relationship with Omri; in introducing him to French president Jacques Chirac, he described him as “Arafat’s good friend.” As for his Likud critics, Sharon once compared them, unfavorably, with the sheep on his ranch: the sheep, at least, were loyal. “The Jews are great, they’re really great,” he tells me. “They’re talented, capable, ambitious—they are great. Innovative. You see how many Jews got the Nobel Prize. That’s as individuals. As a nation, they are not as good.”\n\nWhen I ask Sharon how he would like his obituary to begin, he demurs. “For two reasons I don’t have an answer,” he explains. “It’s too early; I don’t know what will be added still. And it won’t depend on me. Everyone will say whatever they want.” Actually, he offers a third reason as well: too many people would be too eager to write it. “If I tell you,” he says, “they will start writing immediately.”\n\nMuch of it, though, will concern the Arabs. Sharon has always known Arabs and says he respects them both as people and as fighters. His friends say he understands them far better than many Israelis who claim to care about them more. Until the suicide bombings started in Israel, Sharon employed Arab workers on his farm, sometimes as supervisors. “I used to say that our farm was the only successful Jewish-Arab club in the country,” he has written. (He now uses Thai workers.) Sharon says that relations between Jews and Arabs were better in his youth, before the Palestinian Authority made extremists out of people. “What Arafat really managed to bring to this region is hatred,” he says. But Sharon is not sentimental about the old days; when the anti-Jewish incitement started, he says, Arabs killed their Jewish best friends. His vision of Jewish-Arab relations seems unremittingly bleak. “The names change, but it’s always the same killers,” he says.\n\nIn his 1989 autobiography, Warrior, Sharon quotes the dying words of Matti Shmulevitch, a member of the pre-state Jewish underground hanged by the British in the 1940s. “Deep inside, you know we are not criminals,” he told his executioners. “Deep inside you know that the aspiration of the Jewish nation for freedom will never be suppressed, not by murder, not by torture, not by hanging!” I ask Sharon whether a Palestinian can say the same thing. “There is a difference, I tell you,” he replies. “We don’t have any intention to control their lives. We are ready to negotiate.”\n\nBut when it comes to specifics, he is vague. His words, such as “We are ready to negotiate,” “painful compromises,” even “Palestinian state,” have the same mechanical, slightly coerced quality as Arafat’s repeated assurances about fighting terror or establishing “the peace of the brave.” The Palestinian plight does not seem to gnaw at Sharon, except insofar as it inconveniences the Jews. His real agenda peeks out from a bona fide commitment of his: to bring a million more Jews to Israel by the year 2020, from places like Argentina, Ethiopia, South Africa, the former Soviet Union, and France. (“There are more than five million Arabs in France, and it is becoming a very, very unpleasant place for Jews to live,” he notes.) Such a migration, he says offhandedly, “might be the best answer to most of our problems.” In other words, his approach is to overwhelm the Palestinians, and take two decades to do so.\n\n“He tends to judge the Arab-Israeli conflict as he did his encounters with Arab boys as a teenager,” says Nahum Barnea. “If you have a problem, send someone to the head of the village. If you can’t convince him, buy him off. And if that doesn’t work, take out the clubs. In the end, you impose your will on them.”\n\nFar from apologizing for his ethnocentrism, Sharon flaunts it. It may sound odd, but most Israeli prime ministers have not been especially Jewish, as a matter of either observance or consciousness; Zionist culture rejected much of that. But Sharon rejects that rejection. “Look, I am a Jew,” he tells me. “For me, to be a Jew is very, very important. If something really bothers me, [it’s] what will happen to the Jews in 30 years, 300 years, or 3,000 years. That’s behind everything that I do.” In 1999, when he invited the Pope to visit Israel for the millennium, Sharon told him something that he believes none of his deracinated Zionist predecessors have ever cared to say, but that Sharon tells all and sundry. “I said, ‘I am a Jew,’” he says. “‘I am a member of a Jewish government in Jerusalem, the capital of the Jewish people for the last 3,000 years, and united and undivided capital of the state of Israel, with the Temple Mount—the holiest place of the Jewish people—in the center.’\n\n“As a matter of fact the Pope listened and did not fall from the chair,” Sharon continues, with yet another laugh. “And then he said one thing. He said, ‘The land of Israel is holy for Jews, for Christians, for Muslims. But it has been promised only to the Jews.’\n\n“Holy for all the others, promised only to the Jews,” Sharon repeats, a contented look on his face. “That is exactly what I felt.”"
