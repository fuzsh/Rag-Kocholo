        "text": "Â\n\nFormer Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was well known for his unflinching attitude towards \"preserving security\" for Israel, even at the cost of prolonging and escalating conflict with Palestine. He initiated the construction of the separation wall, and later a unilateral disengagement from Gaza. But few commentators today still recall his responsibility for the massacre of innocent civilians in Lebanon in 1982. For this and other deeds legal experts, such as Professor Richard Falk, were certain that Sharon was indictable for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Sharon suffered a major stroke in January 2006 and has remained comatose ever since.\n\nAriel Sharon: \"The Accused\" (June 2001)\n\nThis documentary accuses Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of actively participating in the 1982 massacre of Palestinians in Shabra and Shatila. Because he had a legal resonsibility to ensure the safety of civilians in Beirut, legal experts argue, Sharon's actions that night constitute a war crime for which he should be indicted. (BBC-Panorama)\n\nSabra and Shatilla Massacre\n\nTomis Kapitan gives a brief description of the events and decisions leading up to the massacre in Sabra and Shatilla. (Encyclopedia of War and Ethics)\n\nAriel Sharon Eulogists Ignore the Blood on His Hands (January 11, 2006)\n\nIn failing health, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has received praise from people like US President George Bush. Bush hails Sharon as a \"man of peace\", but the author states that this title is far from the truth. From a 1953 assault on the El-Bureig refugee camp south of Gaza, to the 1982 invasion of Lebanon with 18,000 dead, Sharon is more an \"unindicted war criminal\" than peacemaker, argues the Australian.\n\nWar Criminal at the UN (September 22-28, 2005)\n\nIgnoring Ariel SharonÃ¢â¬â¢s war crimes and allowing him to address the UN Millennium+5 Summit Ã¢â¬Åsmacks of the most stinging hypocrisy and shameless disregard for international law,Ã¢â¬? writes the author of this editorial. The author maintains that Sharon should be brought to trial for the war crimes he committed decades ago, as well as for his more recent support of the construction of the Ã¢â¬Åapartheid wallÃ¢â¬? in Jerusalem. (Al-Ahram Weekly)\n\nSharon Made Safe by Belgian Vote on War Crime Law (April 3, 2003)\n\nBelgianÃ¢â¬â¢s universal jurisdiction law looks certain to be Ã¢â¬Ådiluted beyond recognitionÃ¢â¬? by a parliamentary vote. The law in its current form allows Belgian courts to hear cases of war crimes committed by anyone, anywhere and at anytime. Actions against world leaders have strained BelgiumÃ¢â¬â¢s diplomatic relations, prompting the legislative changes. (Guardian)\n\nGetting to Know Ariel Sharon (March 7, 2003)\n\nThis article provides some insight on Ariel Sharon's record in power. For example, it reveals his \"indirect responsibility\" for the massacre at Sabra and Shatila in 1982, and discloses his \"private fantasies\" for the utter destruction of the Palestinians. (Forward)\n\nItÃ¢â¬â¢s OK to Eat Belgian Chocolates (February 23, 2003)\n\nThis article lampoons IsraelÃ¢â¬â¢s hypocritical, angry response to a Belgian court ruling authorizing the prosecution of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. The author argues that universal jurisdiction, invoked by the ruling, offers an interim solution to impunity while the International Criminal Court finds its feet. (Znet)\n\nBelgium Asserts Right to Try Sharon (February 13, 2003)\n\nThe Belgian appeals court rules that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon can be tried for genocide in Belgium once he has left office. The case relates to SharonÃ¢â¬â¢s responsibility for the massacre of Palestinian refugees in Beirut in 1982. (Guardian)\n\nBelgium May Revive Sharon War Crimes Case (January 17, 2003)\n\nThe Belgian Parliament is redrafting their 1993 Ã¢â¬Ëuniversal competenceÃ¢â¬â¢ law to allow its courts to try cases of war crimes committed by anyone, anywhere and at anytime. Proceedings against Ariel Sharon for his role in the massacre of 800 Palestinians in Lebanon were previously dismissed but the legislative changes may reinstate the case. ( Guardian)\n\nIf I Were Mofaz (January 1, 2002)\n\nAccording to Uri Avnery, Shaul Mofaz, Benjamin Ben-Eliezer and Ariel Sharon have serious reasons to worry. Other countries could pass laws similar to the 1993 Belgium law, which would give universal jurisdiction for the prosecution of any alleged war criminal. (Israelinsider)\n\nTrying to Try Sharon (September/October, 2001)\n\nThe Belgium court will decide whether Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon can be tried for his alleged role in the massacres of Palestinian and Lebanese civilians in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. (MERIP)\n\nTwenty Years On, Sharon Is Up To No Good (June 27, 2001)\n\nTwenty years ago, then-Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon fabricated stories about ArafatÃ¢â¬â¢s links to a terrorist group in order to get a Ã¢â¬Ågreen lightÃ¢â¬? from Washington for a major military adventure that culminated with the Sabra and Chatila massacres. Today, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon appears to be looking for another green light, as he tries to convince US President Bush of a missile threat in south Lebanon. (Independent)\n\nIsrael: Sharon Investigation Urged by Human Rights Watch (June 20, 2001)\n\nHuman Rights Watch believes Sharon should be investigated for committing war crimes. (New York Times)\n\nRethink Over War Crimes Law (June 19, 2001)\n\nMembers of Belgian government, saying they are embarassed by the recent charges against Prime Minister Sharon, plan to tighten its war crimes legislation to prevent further such cases being brought in its courts.
