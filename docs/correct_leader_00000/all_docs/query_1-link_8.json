Founder of the Likud Party, Sharon served in Knesset and became minister of defense in 1981, later taking on other posts. He was elected prime minister of Israel in 2001 and served until 2006. Sharon died on January 11, 2014 at the age of 85.\n\nï¸\n\nLimmud FSU Belarus 2014\n\nSpecial photo exibition in Minsk\n\n\"I am very excited to stand here at the opening of the exhibition on the life of my fatherâ Â - Gilad Sharon\n\nSharonâs parents were Shmuel Scheinerman (1896-1956) from Brest-Litovsk and Vera Scheinerman (1900-1988) from Mogilev; both towns are in what was then Belorussia and is now Belarus.\n\nLimmud FSU 2014 conference in Belarus featured a special event in memory of Sharon.
