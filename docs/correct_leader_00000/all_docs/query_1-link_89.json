        "text": "Ariel Sharon, who has died aged 85, was Prime Minister of Israel from March 2001 and one of the Middle East’s most formidable politicians.\n\nAlways controversial, Sharon’s skill and ruthlessness in his earlier years as a professional soldier were equally evident in his career in politics. In both spheres he exhibited an almost limitless capacity to surprise — never more so than when, in 2005, he unilaterally withdrew from the Gaza Strip and from four settlements in the northern West Bank, a move which outraged many of his people; or when, in November 2005, he announced that he was leaving the Likud party to establish a new centrist party, Kadima, which also included figures such as the former Prime Minister Shimon Peres, who resigned from the Labour party to join Kadima.\n\nBut Sharon’s leadership came to an abrupt end on January 4 2006, when he suffered a stroke from which he never recovered; his deputy, Ehud Olmert, was confirmed as the acting prime minister in his place.\n\nSharon had come to power five years earlier. He decisively defeated the incumbent prime minister, Ehud Barak, and formed a Likud-Labour coalition government. He then embarked on a remorseless campaign to crush the Palestinian intifada, or uprising, in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, declaring Yasser Arafat “irrelevant”, bombing the Palestinian leader’s private helicopter and sending tanks to surround his headquarters at Ramallah, effectively putting Arafat under house arrest.\n\nPrime Minister Menachem Begin once said of Sharon: “He’s a brilliant general, but a vicious man.” Sharon had been defence minister in Begin’s Likud government from 1981 to 1983 and the architect of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in June 1982. This invasion, triggered by an attempt on the life of Israel’s ambassador in London, was aimed at crushing Arafat’s Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) in Lebanon and pushing Syrian forces out of Beirut.\n\nSharon assured ministers that the operation would be short — between 24 and 48 hours — and that there would be no confrontation with the Syrian forces in Lebanon. But when Operation “Peace for Galilee” started, Sharon expanded it into a fully-fledged war, instructing his forces to go deeper into Lebanon and to provoke the Syrians into a conflict.\n\nHaving secured the departure of the PLO and the Syrians from Beirut, Sharon set out to install the Maronite leader, Bashir Gemayel, as the President of Lebanon. But with hundreds of Israeli soldiers killed, and following the assassination of Gemayel, Sharon lost the support of many of his soldiers and of ministers.\n\nWhen, in September, the Christian Phalange massacred hundreds of Palestinians in the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila, 400,000 Israelis gathered in Tel Aviv to protest.\n\nThe Israeli president, Yitzhak Navon, went on television demanding that the government investigate the tragic events in the camps, and hinted that he would resign if his demands were not met; Prime Minister Begin conceded, appointing a commission of inquiry under Yitzhak Kahan, the Chief Supreme Court judge, which published a report blaming Sharon for culpable negligence and advising Begin to consider removing him, which the prime minister duly did.\n\nAriel Sharon during the Six Day War in 1967 (EPA)\n\nThe youngest of two children, Sharon was born Ariel Sheinerman at Moshav Kfar Malal, a cooperative farming village in Palestine, on February 27 1928. His parents, Russian immigrants, did not get on well with their neighbours, and the other children kept their distance from “Arik”, as he was known. “I felt isolated, lonely,” he later recalled. “The slights hurt deeply.” His upbringing was strict, and he was an average student at the Geula high school in Tel Aviv.\n\nAt 14 he joined Hagana, the largest underground organisation in Palestine (then under the British Mandate). After being trained to use pistols and knives he was transferred to an elite platoon called the Signallers.\n\nAs a Hagana member, Sharon took part in the civil war between Jews and Arabs in Palestine which broke out following the UN resolution of November 29 1947 to partition the land between the two peoples; it was then that Sharon was marked out as a brave and charismatic leader. He had a talent for reading a battle quickly and accurately, and for exploiting the terrain to maximise an advantage; he always preferred the bold frontal attack. That winter he was made a platoon commander in the Alexandroni brigade.\n\nOn the night of May 25 1948 Sharon’s platoon joined other forces in a battle against the Jordanian Legion at Latrun, a fortress controlling the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem road from where the Jordanians blocked Jewish food convoys from reaching besieged Jerusalem.\n\nThe operation was meant to take part under cover of darkness, but it started late; Sharon’s platoon, attacking Latrun from the south, was caught in the glare of the morning sun in an exposed position on a rocky hillside. For most of the day his force was heavily mortared and pinned down by intense fire; the heat was oppressive, water and ammunition were running out and, when a bullet smashed into the radio, his force became separated from other attacking units.\n\nWhen he realised that these units had retreated, Sharon ordered his men to withdraw. But by now 15 of the original 35 were dead; and another 11 — including Sharon, who had been hit by two bullets — were wounded. His clothes soaked with blood, Sharon crawled with the remnants of his platoon over the rocks.\n\nBy mid-July Sharon had recovered from his wounds and was well enough to return to full service; he then participated in battles in central Israel and against the Egyptians at “the Faludja Pocket”.\n\nWhen the 1948 war ended, he was appointed commander of the Golani Brigade’s reconnaissance company and, after a stint as the Intelligence Officer at Central Command, in 1952 he was appointed to the same job in Northern Command — then headed by Moshe Dayan, the future Chief of Staff of the Israeli Army.\n\nAs they sat chatting amiably, Sharon suddenly stood up, pulled a pistol from his pocket and forced the three shocked Jordanians into his car. That evening he left a note to Dayan: “Moshe — the mission is accomplished. The prisoners are in the cellar. Shalom, Arik.”\n\nAriel Sharon with Moshe Dayan on the western side of the Suez Canal in 1973 (AP)\n\nIn 1953 Sharon hoped to take a degree in Oriental History at the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, but he was summoned by the Chief of Staff, who asked him to establish and command Unit 101, a commando force charged with undertaking special operations against insurgents who were launching frequent attacks on Israel from bases in Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nOn October 15 1953, in response to the killing of a Jewish mother and her two infants by these fedayeen, Sharon led Unit 101 against Kibia, an Arab village on Jordanian territory. His team carried 600 kilograms of explosives and blew up 45 houses, in the process killing 69 Jordanians, half of them women and children. Kibia became notorious in Arab circles for its ruthlessness, and marked Sharon as a feared enemy.\n\nIn January 1954 Moshe Dayan, the newly-appointed Chief of Staff, merged Unit 101 with the paratroopers and made Sharon its commander. In February 1955 Sharon led his paratroopers in a raid against the Egyptian Army camp in Gaza. The moderate prime minister, Moshe Sharett, had approved a limited operation and instructed that the enemy must not suffer more than 10 casualties. But under Sharon the operation was expanded; 36 Egyptians, Palestinian soldiers and irregulars were killed. Sharett was furious, while President Nasser later claimed that the “Gaza Raid” convinced him that no peace settlement between Israel and Egypt was possible.\n\nDuring the 1956 Sinai campaign, Sharon commanded the paratroop brigade which was sent into Sinai to link up with Israeli forces which had been dropped near the Suez Canal. Sharon was specifically warned not to attack the heavily-defended Mitla Pass, where Egyptian forces were dug in; but he could not resist the temptation to take the high defile and, obtaining permission to send in a “patrol”, he sent a large detachment straight up the pass into an Egyptian ambush. He then had to commit the rest of his brigade to extricate the trapped force; 38 of his soldiers were killed and 120 wounded.\n\nThe paratroopers demanded Sharon’s resignation. But Prime Minister David Ben Gurion, a great admirer of Sharon, decided that he should remain in the Army. Nonetheless, the Mitla debacle cemented Sharon’s reputation for indiscipline and slowed down his promotion.\n\nIn the autumn of 1957 Sharon was sent to the Staff college at Camberley. His return to Israel was the beginning of what he called “my years of frustration”. For three years he was Commander of the Infantry School, but he felt that had been sent into exile by his superiors. During this period he devoted much time to studying Law at Tel Aviv University. Then, in 1963, Chief of Staff Yitzhak Rabin appointed Sharon head of the Northern Command Staff on condition that he “behaved himself”. Sharon complied, and was promoted to major-general and given command of a reserve armoured division.\n\nSharon (centre) in the Negev desert in 1967 (EPA)\n\nWhen Nasser sent troops into Sinai in May 1967, Sharon put pressure on the prime minister, Levy Eshkol, to strike at Egypt. His moment came on June 5, when Israel did just that. As one of the three divisional commanders in Sinai, Sharon planned, and brilliantly executed, a complex night operation which required meticulous timing and co-ordination between armoured, infantry and paratroop forces against the heavily-fortified defence system of Abu Ageila and Umm Katif. After the breakthrough battles, Sharon’s force destroyed the retreating Egyptian armour.\n\nIn December 1969 he was appointed OC Southern Command. Then Chief of Staff Haim Bar Lev insisted on building a chain of fortifications along the Canal (the “Bar Lev line”) to protect Israeli soldiers from the heavy Egyptian bombardments. Sharon strongly opposed this idea, arguing that the strength of the Israeli army was not in static defence, but rather in its ability to move and manoeuvre.\n\nHaving failed to persuade the Chief of Staff not to build the line, Sharon gradually shut down the fortifications. By the time he finally handed over the Southern Command, only four months before the Yom Kippur War, he had closed half the forts of the line; and, when five Egyptian infantry divisions (100,000 men) crossed the Suez Canal on October 6 1973, the fortifications — manned by only 450 Israeli soldiers — were overrun.\n\nThe young general: Ariel Sharon during his time as head of the Southern Command of the Israeli Army in 1969 (KEYSTONE/GETTY)\n\nFrom 1970, with Palestinian resistance growing to Israeli occupation in the Gaza Strip, Sharon had been ordered by Dayan, then Defence Minister, to suppress it. He divided the Gaza Strip into squares and ordered elite commando units to comb the area, square by square. He also had the lower branches of the trees in all orchards lopped off, in order to improve the soldiers’ field of vision and to eliminate cover. Within a few months Sharon had managed to crush the Palestinian opposition.\n\nAt the age of 45, Sharon decided that his chances of heading the IDF were slim, so he retired from regular service and subsequently went into politics. He was instrumental in bringing about the alignment of Herut, the Free Centre, the State List and the Liberal Party within the framework of the Right-wing Likud bloc.\n\nOn Yom Kippur, October 6 1973, Egyptian and Syrian forces launched a simultaneous surprise attack on Israel, bringing Sharon back to active military service as a reserve officer in command of an armoured division.\n\nThe first days of the war were disastrous for the Israelis; but then Sharon located a seam between the Second and Third Egyptian Armies which he managed to penetrate before establishing a bridgehead and then crossing the Suez Canal into Egypt. He was the hero of the hour, but his superiors, who frequently clashed with him, complained that he was indisciplined and uncontrollable; twice during the war the Chief of Staff (David Elazar) wanted to fire him, but Dayan resisted.\n\nAfter the war, Sharon returned to Likud; and in December 1973 he was elected to the Knesset. He used his position to criticise the Labour government and the military command for the unsatisfactory conduct of the war. He also declared his willingness to negotiate with the PLO leadership about a solution to the Palestinian problem, within the framework of his “Jordan is Palestine” concept.\n\nIn June 1975 Sharon left Likud and was appointed special adviser on security affairs to the then Labour Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. The following April, however, he resigned to form his own party, Shlomzion, which won two seats in the 1977 elections and joined with Begin’s Likud to form the government; Sharon was appointed Minister of Agriculture. He was also chairman of the ministerial committee for the settlements.\n\nWhen Prime Minister Begin was negotiating with President Sadat at Camp David — on the agenda was the removal of Jewish settlements from Sinai in return for peace — Begin telephoned Sharon and got his support for the removal of settlements. This proved decisive, and Begin abandoned his opposition to their removal. In August 1981 he appointed Sharon a defence minister.\n\nLess than two years later — in February 1983 — Sharon was forced to resign in the wake of the Kahan report, although he remained a minister without portfolio. From 1984 to 1990 he was Minister of Trade and Industry and a member of the inner cabinet.\n\nIsrael Today profile of Ariel Sharon\n\nSoon after his appointment he went to America to attend the hearings of the libel action he had brought against Time magazine for publishing an article claiming that a secret appendix of the Kahan Commission Report contained evidence that he had encouraged the Christians to kill Palestinians in the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila. Although the jury found the article defamatory, it decided that it had been published without malicious intent — and Sharon was denied his $50 million compensation claim.\n\nIn 1993 Sharon was dismayed when the younger Benjamin Netanyahu succeeded Yitzhak Shamir as Likud leader. In December 1995 he announced that he would not be standing as a candidate for the premiership, as had been expected, and he called on the entire Right-wing opposition to stand behind Netanyahu’s candidacy. Following Netanyahu’s victory in the elections, Sharon was made a Minister of Infrastructure.\n\nAfter the resignation of Netayahu in May 1999, Sharon became an interim leader of Likud, and in September he was elected its chairman. On September 28 2000, wearing dark glasses and escorted by more than 1,000 police officers, he visited Jerusalem “to examine archaeological sites on Temple Mount” – a highly provocative tour of a site considered holy both by Jews and Muslims. He was attempting to weaken further the already wounded Prime Minister Barak by showing a strong position on Jerusalem. But his visit proved the spark that ignited the second Palestinian intifada, with its ever-worsening cycle of terror attacks and harsh reprisals.\n\nSharon announced his plan to disengage from Gaza in December 2003, saying that if the Palestinians did not respond positively, Israel would act unilaterally. He secured American guarantees that, in any future agreement, Palestinian refugees displaced by the creation of Israel would be allowed to exercise their “right of return” only to the future state of Palestine, and not to Israel; and that any final settlement must take into account the Israeli settlements on the West Bank.\n\nIn 1989 he published (with David Chanoff) his memoirs, Warrior.\n\nSharon never recovered consciousness after his stroke, but was kept alive for years on life-support. This month the hospital where he was treated reported that his kidneys had begun to fail and that his situation was critical.\n\nAriel Sharon’s first wife, Gali, was killed in a car crash. He later married her sister, Lili, who died in 2000. His son Gur, by his first marriage, was killed at the age of nine while playing with a gun; he is survived by the two sons of his second marriage."
