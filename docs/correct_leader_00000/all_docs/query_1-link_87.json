        "text": "Sycamore Farm, which is said to be the largest private farm in Israel, comprises a thousand acres of citrus groves and grazing land near the desert town of Sederot. It is the home of Ariel (Arik) Sharon, the retired major general and, if the polls are to be trusted, Israel’s next Prime Minister. One afternoon, he took me on a tour. We stepped out of the main house, a spare, white stucco building, and got into a dirt-smeared four-by-four. Sharon drove. A second truck followed, filled with plainclothesmen from the Shabak, Israel’s internal security service, who carried Uzis. Sharon is Israel’s most polarizing public figure; he goes nowhere unprotected, not even to the sheep pens downwind from his house.\n\nIt was a cold day: the sky was ash gray, and the wind whipped up from the desert. Sharon, who wore a flannel shirt and jeans, was in a fine mood; he seems to take joy in his land, though the hard physical labor of farming is left to a group of workers imported from Thailand. (Like many Israelis, he has not given permanent employment to Palestinians for several years.) He talked about the price of cattle. “Ranchers always think they’re getting too little,” he said. As we drove past a stand of orange trees, he remarked, “Sometimes you can hear the jackals howling from here.”\n\nThe farm is hilly, and at several spots the dirt tracks descend steeply into the wadis, or dry gulches, that cut across the land. As we approached the drops, Sharon didn’t brake but pressed on the accelerator. At one point, we bounced so hard that he hit his head against the roof. The Shabak truck behind us fought to keep pace.\n\nEventually, he pulled up by a grove of clementine trees, opened the door, and eased himself down. Sharon is very large—shorter than one imagines, but mountainous; his head is small, and his body flares out beneath it. (His appetite is legendary: before the tour, while we talked in his kitchen, he ate an entire tube of Pringles potato chips.) His hair is white, and his skin is marked with liver spots, but at seventy-two he is still a vital man. He walks as if he doesn’t feel his own weight.\n\nIn the citrus grove, he picked a clementine off a tree and cut it open with a small knife. “This is Zionism,” he said, gesturing to his trees. “Farming the land, holding the land, is Zionism.”\n\nIt was a performance, but a performance deeply felt. Sharon’s philosophy is not complicated. “Zionism is physical,” he said. “It means that we defend ourselves and our land. And if we leave”—surrender—“a part of our land, we should do it only if it is in our best interests.”\n\nThere are just two men still prominent in public life here who can claim a direct connection to the founders of the modern Jewish state: Sharon and Shimon Peres, the former Prime Minister and Nobel Peace Prize laureate. Both were protégés of David Ben-Gurion, the George Washington of Israel, and both began their careers as security hawks: in the first years of statehood, Sharon was the Israeli Army’s preëminent commando, and Peres is the father of Israel’s nuclear-weapons program. Over the past ten or fifteen years, though, Peres’s beliefs have shifted; today, he envisions a “new Middle East,” a borderless place organized not along the principles of blood and tribe but around high technology and free trade. Sharon, on the other hand, maintains his belief in the efficacy of high walls; if anything, he wants to top them with razor wire, not tear them down.\n\nUntil last fall, Sharon’s view was not popular among Israelis, many of whom believed that the Palestinian people were inexorably reconciling themselves to the reality of Israel’s existence. In 1993, after secret negotiations in Oslo, Yasir Arafat shook hands with the Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on the lawn of the White House, and forswore the use of violence as a political tool. The Oslo process was structured so that the easier issues were dealt with first: soon after the signing, Israel granted to the newly created Palestinian Authority autonomy over much of Gaza, which most Israelis—particularly those who served as Army reservists there—could not wait to be rid of. The most difficult issues—the disposition of Jerusalem, the status of Palestinian refugees—would be postponed until the end of the process, after several years of confidence building.\n\nThe process moved in fits and starts—its low moment came in 1995, when Rabin was assassinated—but by the time his spiritual heir, Ehud Barak, was elected Prime Minister, less than two years ago, it seemed likely that the hundred-year war between Arab and Jew might be coming to an orderly close. At the Camp David summit last July, Barak proposed giving the Palestinians their own state, which reportedly would occupy not only Gaza but about ninety per cent of the West Bank. And Barak, by many accounts, was ready to give up Israeli sovereignty over much of the Old City of Jerusalem, including the Temple Mount. For the first time in Israeli history—for the first time in Jewish history, in fact—a Jewish leader volunteered to cede parts of Jerusalem to his enemy. But Arafat rejected the plan, and left Camp David without making a counteroffer.\n\nThen, in Jerusalem on September 28th, Sharon and several prominent fellow-members of the opposition Likud Party, in a highly public and provocative act, walked up a stone ramp and entered the Temple Mount. It is a roughly thirty-five-acre man-made plateau situated at the southeastern corner of Jerusalem’s walled Old City. In Biblical times, the First and Second Jewish Temples stood there, but today the surface is entirely Muslim: the Dome of the Rock, Jerusalem’s most recognizable landmark, sits near its center, and the cavernous al-Aqsa mosque anchors its southern end. Muslims refer to the Mount as the Noble Sanctuary; the Prophet Muhammad is said to have ascended to Heaven from a large rock that the Dome now encloses. Jewish tradition holds that the Mount was built over the spot where Abraham prepared to sacrifice Isaac, and where the high priest of the Jews spoke aloud the ineffable name of God, on the Day of Atonement. An exposed retaining wall of the plateau—the Western Wall, which is sometimes referred to as the Wailing Wall—is Judaism’s holiest site, but it is sacred only because of its relation to the Second Temple, which it once surrounded.\n\nJews don’t ordinarily visit the top of the Mount; rabbinical rulings forbid it. The Mount is not a site of Jewish prayer but the object of Jewish prayer. Administratively, the Mount remains under the control of a Muslim trust, which is in turn controlled by the Palestinian Authority, but the Israelis handle security matters. The only Jews generally authorized to be on the Mount are policemen.\n\nSharon’s critics ascribe various motives to his visit. Some say it was calculated to upstage his Likud Party rival, the former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Sharon himself told me that he was simply gathering facts. For years, archeologists have complained, with good reason, that the Muslim trust is gradually removing evidence of the Jewish religious presence on the Mount. “I wanted to see if the Arabs were really destroying the remains of the Temple,” Sharon said. To many Israelis, it looked as if he wanted to assert the Jewish claim to the Mount at a time when it was feared that Ehud Barak was ready to cede it to the Palestinians.\n\nWhen I asked Sharon what information he had gathered in the course of the visit—he is not an archeologist—he didn’t have much to say. He finally remarked, “You know, there was a disruption when I was up there.”\n\nAs Sharon made his way around the Mount, guarded by hundreds of Israeli policemen and soldiers, Muslims began screaming epithets. He was confronted, too, by several Arab members of the Knesset, or parliament, who had come forward specifically to challenge him. The next day, riots broke out atop the Mount, across the West Bank and Gaza, and, soon after, in Arab areas of Israel proper. It was the beginning of what came to be known as the al-Aqsa Intifada.\n\nIsraelis were split: even those who consider Sharon distasteful and his timing terrible found it difficult to condemn a Jew for visiting a Jewish holy place. The rest of the world had no trouble turning against Sharon: he was accused of making an incendiary gesture at a moment of extreme delicacy in the Middle East peace process.\n\nAs the riots entered their second week, however, it began to appear that the uprising couldn’t be explained away by Sharon’s walkabout. “The explosion would have happened anyway,” Marwan Barghouti, the Palestinian leader of the uprising on the West Bank, told me recently. “It was necessary in order to protect Palestinian rights. But Sharon provided a good excuse. He is a hated man.”\n\nWhen I first began following Sharon around Israel last fall, he was not yet a candidate for Prime Minister. He was chairman of the Likud Party, but he was perceived to be a caretaker, keeping the seat warm until Netanyahu returned to politics. Then, in December, in the crisis atmosphere of the uprising, Prime Minister Barak, who had earlier lost his parliamentary majority, suddenly resigned his post, forcing the snap election that is scheduled to take place on February 6th. Barak did this, it seems, to thwart Netanyahu’s return. Netanyahu ultimately chose not to run, leaving Sharon as the foremost right-wing candidate to face Barak. Until Barak’s maneuver, Sharon had no reasonable expectation of ever becoming Prime Minister.\n\nPerhaps because of this, Sharon felt free to speak to me in blunt terms about what he sees as the pipe dream of peace, and about Islam, which he sees as Judaism’s implacable foe.\n\n“You know, the Koran doesn’t mention Jerusalem once,” he told me, in defense of the Jewish claim to the city. “In the Bible it is mentioned six hundred and seventy-six times. Muhammad was never in Jerusalem. When the Muslims occupied Jerusalem, it was seven years after Muhammad’s death. They say he came here and went to Heaven. Yeah—seven years after he died. You know, when the Jews pray, all over the world, they face the Temple Mount. When an Arab prays, he prays to Mecca. Even when an Arab is on the Mount, his back is to it. Also some of his lower parts.”\n\nI asked Sharon about the extraordinary rage his name provokes among Arabs. He said, “They hate me because I’ve had a major role in saving Israel every time it was in trouble.”\n\nSharon was born in a communal farming village north of Tel Aviv, the son of Russian immigrants to Palestine. While still in his teens, he joined the Haganah, the Jewish self-defense organization, and by the time of Israel’s War of Independence he was already, at twenty, a platoon commander. In the early nineteen-fifties, he led Unit 101, a commando squad staffed largely by cowboys like him. Unit 101 carried out raids against Jordanian villages suspected of harboring Palestinian guerrillas, and he gained a reputation as a commander who would repeatedly escalate confrontations with the Arabs. In one raid, on the Jordanian village of Qibbiya, he and his men destroyed more than forty houses and killed sixty-nine people, including women and children.\n\nIn the 1956 war against Egypt, Sharon was once again accused by his superiors of exceeding his orders—by provoking an Egyptian attack at the Mitla Pass when his orders were to avoid contact. As a result, his advancement within the Army was thwarted for several years. Yitzhak Rabin, who became the Army chief of staff in 1964, gave him his first significant command, and three years later, in the Six-Day War, Sharon waged a brilliantly successful tank attack against the Egyptians at Abu Ageila. In 1970, he was called upon by the Army to combat terrorist cells in the Gaza Strip, occupied by Israel after the war, and he did so, brutally and effectively.\n\nIn the Yom Kippur War of 1973, Sharon was once again cast as the hero, after leading a tank force across the Suez Canal, to within striking distance of Cairo. He left the Army soon after, but he was not finished making war. Four years later, he joined Menachem Begin’s right-wing government as Minister of Agriculture. The fact that he owned an enormous farm in Israel—financed in part with a loan from the Hollywood mogul Meshulam Riklis—drew criticism, but Sharon wasn’t particularly interested in farm price supports. His real job was to oversee the building of new Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, settlements that would make it difficult for any future government to return these lands to Arab control. He built these settlements with alacrity—he earned the nickname Bulldozer—and today they are strewn across the West Bank, many of them looming over Palestinian towns. In 1981, Sharon became Begin’s Minister of Defense, and a year later he launched the war against Yasir Arafat’s Palestine Liberation Organization, which had turned the south of Lebanon into a forward base for attacks on Israel. It was, some argue, the only war Israel fought out of choice rather than necessity. Hundreds of Israeli soldiers lost their lives, along with thousands of Arabs, and the Israeli Army, which claims as its ethos “Tohar Ha’neshek” (“the purity of arms”), gained a reputation for callousness and excess.\n\nWhen Sharon launched the attack on Lebanon, he told Prime Minister Begin’s Cabinet that the attack would last two days and Israeli forces would advance only about twenty-five miles into Lebanon. But Sharon and the Cabinet were driven by grandiose desires: to install a Christian-led government in Beirut that would sign a peace treaty with Israel and to eradicate the infrastructure of the P.L.O. The war culminated in Israel’s siege of Beirut and the massacre of innocent Palestinians by Sharon’s Christian allies, the Phalangists, at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. The Phalangist militia, bent on vengeance, entered the camps shortly after its leader, Bashir Gemayel, was assassinated. The Phalangists murdered nearly eight hundred people, many of them women and children. The massacre took place over thirty hours, within view of Israeli positions. A commission of inquiry eventually found that although Sharon did not have prior knowledge of it, he should have foreseen its likelihood when he agreed to send the Phalangists into the refugee camps.\n\nSharon was forced out of office, but the consequences for Israel were lasting. Israeli forces remained in southern Lebanon for another eighteen years, until Ehud Barak withdrew them late last spring. Sharon’s invasion further radicalized the Palestinians: it turned Lebanon’s Shiite Muslims against Israel (the Shiite Hezbollah is the most effective terrorist group Israel has ever faced), and it failed, of course, to eliminate the P.L.O. or Palestinian nationalism. Five years after the invasion, the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza rose up against the Israeli occupation, beginning their six-year Intifada.\n\nAfter Lebanon, Sharon refused to fade away. He held a number of Cabinet positions through the late nineteen-eighties and early nineteen-nineties. When Rabin’s Labor government took power, in 1992, Sharon served in the Knesset in opposition; he was appointed Foreign Minister by the Netanyahu government in 1998.\n\nSharon’s record is not altogether without nuance. Under Netanyahu, he agreed to the Israeli withdrawal from most of the West Bank city of Hebron, which is one of Judaism’s holiest cities, and he also agreed reluctantly to the withdrawal from thirteen per cent of the West Bank.\n\nSharon dissents from the Peres vision of the Middle East, but his dissent is not rooted in the quasi-messianic beliefs of the Greater Land of Israel movement, in which settlements are seen as a concrete fulfillment of a Biblical imperative. He is driven, instead, by a belief in the immutability of Arab hatred.\n\nWhen I asked him if he had any regrets now about going to the Temple Mount, he replied without a moment’s hesitation. “I am really sorry for every casualty, Jewish and Arab. But the only one who is responsible for that is Arafat.” Then he said, “Look, I unmasked the Palestinians! That’s what I did. So something good did come out of this. We saw their true intentions.”\n\nThe Ashkenazi-dominated ideological left continues to despise Sharon (Yossi Sarid, the leader of the Meretz Party, compares him to Nero), but in another Israel—of the settlers, of the Orthodox, of the Russian immigrants and of the Sephardim, the Jews who came to Israel from the Islamic world—he is a giant.\n\nOne night, at Sharon’s farm, I bumped into Uzi Landau, a Likud member of the Knesset. We were there to celebrate the holiday of Sukkot. Sharon had erected a sukkah, the booth in which Jews eat during the holiday, by the side of his house. Most sukkahs generally fit ten or fifteen people; this one fit two hundred. There were a half-dozen other members of the Likud Knesset faction present, as well as a group of teen-agers wearing “Likud Youth” T-shirts and a pack of mid-level Party leaders, tough-looking Sephardic men who wore their shirts open to their navels and chewed on cigars as they conducted political business: the smoke-filled sukkah. I asked Landau how he felt about the collapse of the peace process and the Palestinian return to violence. “Oslo is Munich, and Arik is Churchill,” he said.\n\nAnother evening, after watching Sharon deliver a series of speeches in Ofakim, a desert town not far from Sycamore Farm, I attended a dinner in Sharon’s honor at the home of Ofakim’s mayor, Yair Hazan. Hazan is, like many of his constituents, a Jew of Moroccan descent. The foyer of his house is hung with portraits of great Sephardic sages, including two framed drawings of the legendary Moroccan wonder rabbi known as the Baba Sali. Hanging next to one of the Baba Sali’s portraits is a khamsa, an inverted hand made of painted plaster, which is placed near the front door to ward off the evil eye.\n\nSeated across from me at dinner was the deputy mayor of Ofakim, Shlomo Azran, a young, standoffish rabbi and member of the Sephardic Shas Party. To my right sat a local city-council member named Moshe Peretz, a heavyset man with a walrus mustache, wearing a small red kippa on his head. Much of the talk was about “the situation”—the Israeli euphemism for the current uprising. “You want me to tell you about the Arabs? I’ll tell you about the Arabs,” Peretz said. He leaned in close to my face, inadvertently dragging his jacket sleeve through my hummus, and said, “If you treat the Arabs badly, they love you. If you treat them nicely, they’ll eat you for dinner.”\n\nAcross the table, Rabbi Azran happened to overhear us, and smiled. “In the Torah, it says that the goyim will always hate the Jews, no matter what,” he said. “All the goyim. Forever!”\n\nI turned back to Peretz. “The Rabbi isn’t wrong,” he said. “All you need is a strong hand, and the whole situation will come to an end.”\n\nI asked the men around me whether Sharon’s record ever gave them pause. Peretz looked at me coldly and answered, “Sabra and Shatila doesn’t bother me. Does it bother you?”\n\nWe ate in silence for a moment. Then someone said, “Arik needs hummus,” and I passed a dish to Sharon, who was lost in his food and appeared not to have been listening to our conversation.\n\nLater, when I asked Sharon to explain his conception of the conflict, he answered, “The Arabs don’t want the Jews to be here. That is the secret of this whole story.” He went on, “This land we are on is considered by the Muslims to be holy land. They will never let anyone else possess it. You should read the Koran. You’ll see what they think about the Jews. They want to take this land by violence.”\n\nAs Sharon spoke, I recalled a conversation I’d had earlier in the day. On the way to Ofakim, I had stopped in the town of Arad, not far from the Dead Sea, in order to talk to its most famous resident, the writer Amos Oz. He is the face of the humane Israel—the Israel that reined in Sharon after the disaster in Lebanon.\n\nOz greeted me in his basement study. He is sixty-one, and no longer quite the picture of Sabra virility he once was, but his face still has a chiselled quality.\n\n“At Camp David, Barak offered to recognize a Palestinian state that would extend over ninety-four per cent of the occupied territories,” Oz said. “Plus, there would be swap of territory for the remaining six per cent. Plus, East Jerusalem would be the capital of Palestine. Well, Arafat turned this down. I suspect now that they prefer to give birth to Palestine on the battlefield, not at the negotiating table. The battlefield is more heroic, more macho, perhaps—more Muslim, I don’t know.”\n\n“What do you mean, exactly?”\n\nHe reflected a moment. “More in line with the tradition of militant Islam,” he said. “Arafat himself says that this is a holy war for holy land. It’s written in the Koran that the faith of Muhammad is the sword.”\n\nFor Oz, a particular phase of the Middle East peace process has come to a crashing conclusion. “There is something very American, very Christian, if you don’t mind, about this process,” he said. “They speak of liking one another, of the need to understand one another. But we do understand each other. Perhaps that is the problem.”\n\nAmos Oz in agreement with Ariel Sharon. Who could have foreseen it?\n\nThere are in fact very few Israelis left who believe that a peace of roses is in store for the Middle East. After more than seven years of direct American intervention, the spirit, if not the letter, of Oslo is dead. Positions have hardened; hatreds seem absolute.\n\nOne person whose views have remained firm despite recent events is Shimon Peres, the former Prime Minister, who shared a Nobel Peace Prize with Yitzhak Rabin and Yasir Arafat for the achievements of Oslo. If Barak loses heart and withdraws from the race, Peres will most likely become the Likud Party candidate.\n\nPeres is Israel’s greatest optimist, its foremost proponent of what he has termed “the new Middle East.” In a 1993 book of that name, Peres wrote, “The Middle East can apply the lessons of both the computer revolution and the rise of Asian economic power. To do this, its leaders must abandon the conflicts of yesterday and invest in education instead of the arms race.”\n\nPeres has become a figure of some ridicule in Israel: Right-wingers call him a solipsist; those in the center call him a fabulist. The left-wing Foreign Minister, Shlomo Ben-Ami, in a conversation with me last November, mocked Peres’s oft-stated belief that Israel might one day be able to join the Arab League. But Peres stubbornly continues to push his vision.\n\n“There is a need for a new Middle East,” he told me one day in November as we sat by a window in the Knesset cafeteria. He seemed out of place there: he is dignified in demeanor, and impeccably dressed, whereas the cafeteria is more Second Avenue Deli than Senate Dining Room—the service lacks a certain grace, and almost everyone talks louder than is absolutely necessary. At a table near us sat almost every member of the Shas Party faction, and they were all yelling at each other.\n\n“We are between Africa and Europe,” Peres said. “This region can easily become like Africa, and that would be the old Middle East, or we could go the way of Europe, become an extension of Europe.”\n\nBut what happened?\n\n“The two parties both have their own perceptions,” he said. “We think the Palestinians have a grand design to make our lives miserable. They think we have a master plan to cut them to pieces. Well, we don’t have a master plan and they don’t have a grand design.”\n\nMany Israeli leaders, on the left as well as the right, are today calling for a kind of forced, almost punitive, disengagement by Israel from the Palestinians. Shlomo Avineri, a left-wing advocate of Palestinian statehood who formerly served as director-general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, told me that he would advocate placing minefields between Israel and the future state of Palestine, should border security be threatened. “The alternative to making war is not making love but not making war,” he said.\n\n“What is he talking about?” Peres said, when I mentioned Avineri’s comments. “Walls don’t stop missiles. Walls don’t stop pollution. Walls will stop trade, though.”\n\nAs we talked, Uri Savir, a Knesset member from the Center Party who is the president of the Peres Center for Peace, came by to tell Peres about a Palestinian attack. Three Jews, including a mother of five, had been killed by gunmen near the Jewish settlement of Ofra, on the road that runs up the spine of the West Bank.\n\nBeepers and cell phones were sounding across the room, and the volume of a television set parked at the center of the cafeteria was turned up as Knesset members took in the news.\n\nWhen Savir left, I asked Peres what he made of the attack.\n\n“Setbacks are an important part of crises,” he answered calmly. “I’m not terribly impressed by crises. Life is difficult, but compared to what?”\n\nThis is one reason Shimon Peres lost so many races for Prime Minister. Three Jews are dead by the side of a road, and he doesn’t bother to express regret. For Peres, it seems, only the future is real; the hardships of today are abstractions.\n\nII—ORIGINAL SIN\n\nOn December 15th, which was the third Friday of the holy month of Ramadan on the Islamic calendar, the Israeli police barred Muslim men under the age of thirty-five from attending prayers at the al-Aqsa mosque on the Temple Mount. Seven Palestinians had been killed on the Mount the day after Sharon’s visit, and the police were eager to keep young Muslims away from a place electric with the promise of martyrdom.\n\nAt about eleven-thirty Friday morning, I joined a group of young Palestinian men as they walked through East Jerusalem toward the Damascus Gate, which is the main entrance to the Muslim Quarter of the Old City. Black clouds hung overhead, and the stone walkways were slick with rain and rotting garbage. The Palestinians collected rocks as they approached the gate. As we reached the plaza in front of it, we saw Israeli policemen in great numbers before us. Green-uniformed border policemen stood on the walls of the Old City, each one carrying an automatic rifle with an attached sniper scope. Other border policemen stood in clusters before the walls, holding tear-gas grenade launchers and wooden batons.\n\nBy a quarter to twelve, about a thousand young Palestinian men had gathered before the gate, facing two hundred helmeted police officers and soldiers. The police were screening everyone: only women, older men, and children were allowed into the Old City. A group of young men tried to push their way through, and were forced back. The crowd grew mean. The Palestinians taunted the border policemen, many of whom were Jewish immigrants from Ethiopia. “Go back to the jungle!” one Palestinian man yelled, in Hebrew, directly into the face of an Ethiopian. The Ethiopian was stoic, but another policeman beside him told the Palestinian, in Arabic, “I’m going to fuck your mother!” The Palestinian replied, “You’re the cunt brother of sixty-six whores!”\n\nSeveral Palestinians began setting piles of garbage on fire, and the crowd surged forward, chanting “Allahu akbar!” (“God is great!”) Then a dozen mounted police arrived, their horses fitted with plastic visors. “Give them strong hits!” the commander of the mounted unit told his men, and then they charged. The horses terrified the Arabs, who scattered down the side streets. Police on foot followed behind, smacking the stragglers with batons.\n\nThe police then pulled back, and the Palestinians gave up; they organized prayers on the wet ground, using ragged pieces of cardboard as prayer mats. In the near-distance stood the shimmering Dome of the Rock, close yet unobtainable.\n\nIn Jerusalem, more so than in any other place, the three monotheistic religions are in direct competition. It is a small historical irony that today many religious Jews see the presence of the Dome of the Rock on the Mount as an insult, because the Dome was built in the seventh century as a rebuke to Christianity. The early Christian rulers of Jerusalem had turned the Temple Mount into a rubbish heap, as an expression of triumph over Judaism. When the Muslims conquered the city, they immediately cleaned up the Mount, and venerated it by building the Dome, inscribing anti-Christian quotations on the walls.\n\nThe competition between Jews and Muslims for primacy on the Mount is a comparatively recent phenomenon. The current uprising is frequently compared with the Palestinian Intifada that began in the late eighties, but in its origins it resembles a much earlier Arab uprising, one that took place in 1929, when Great Britain governed Palestine. In the 1929 riots, Arabs killed more than a hundred Jews in such cities as Hebron and Safed. The riots began after a period of increased militancy on both sides. Arab religious figures, led by the Mufti of Jerusalem, Hajj Amin al-Husseini, inflamed their followers by warning of a concerted Jewish attempt to conquer the Temple Mount and destroy its Islamic holy places. Their proof: Jewish worshippers had placed tables and prayer partitions in front of the Western Wall.\n\nToday, the Mufti of Jerusalem is a cleric named Sheikh Ekrima Sabri. In his capacity as preacher of the al-Aqsa mosque, he became known as an extremist and a conspiracy theorist. He was appointed Mufti by Arafat six years ago. In the past, Sabri stated publicly that the Jews exaggerated the scope of the Holocaust in order to win world sympathy for their quest to take Palestine. (In late November, he told me that “the Jews” were trying to steal the American election for Al Gore. “They will steal it, and then they will remove him, and then the Jew Lieberman will take over. That is why we support Bush.”)\n\nWhen I mentioned the 1929 riots to the Mufti, and their echoes in the uprising of today, he quickly corrected my recounting of the Jewish provocation. “The Jews tried to put a desk there,” he said. “And chairs. They put chairs there!”\n\nAnd the Jews, the Mufti said, are at it again. He cited the names of several Jewish organizations that want to build a Third Temple on the site where the Dome of the Rock now stands.\n\nJews who would like to bring about a violent end to the Muslim holy places number perhaps in the hundreds. They are dangerous, of course—the Shabak has in the past broken up at least one cell of extremists bent on bombing the Dome—but they have no significant following. According to the Mufti, though, the desire to rebuild the Temple is lodged in the heart of almost every Jew, and certainly in Ariel Sharon’s. “We have all this information that he was coming to look for a new place to build the Temple,” the Mufti said.\n\nMuslims have constructed an alternative history of the site, one that denies its Jewish origins. “There isn’t even a single stone in the Old City of Jerusalem that is Jewish,” the Mufti said. “There is no proof at all that the Jews were ever in Jerusalem.”\n\nThat the Jews have no religious claim to the Temple Mount is a belief shared by a cross-section of Palestinians. Palestinian peace negotiators argued this line to President Clinton at the Camp David summit last July. (Clinton, according to the Israeli Foreign Minister, Shlomo Ben-Ami, “deeply believes that the Temple is there, testified that this is the case, that the Temple is there, in the Baptist meaning.”)\n\nArafat has not let go of the argument. At the Arab summit in Cairo last October, he accused Israel of denying the truth of the Noble Sanctuary, by “forging its history and reality and saying it is the place where the Temple was built.” He also accused Israel of “licentiously attacking the worshippers in its mosques and those defending its honor and sanctity” and “attempting to Judaize holy Jerusalem and its Christian and Islamic holy places.”\n\nOne such Muslim holy place Judaized by Israel, the Mufti told me, is the Western Wall itself, which is also sacred to Muslims, who know it as al-Buraq, after the winged steed that carried Muhammad to Jerusalem on his journey to Heaven. Muslims believe that Muhammad tethered al-Buraq to the Wall before ascending the Mount.\n\nThe Mufti said, “The Jews can pray at the Wall if they want—under Muslim protection. I don’t know why they need to pray there, but they can if they want.”\n\nI asked the Mufti to explain his understanding of the Jewish relationship to the Mount and to the Wall.\n\n“First, there is no Temple. This is a lie. You should know that.” He paused, and went on, “But the Jews cry at the Wall for two reasons, one reason that they’ll tell you and one that they won’t. The first reason is that they believe that Moses lost the Ten Commandments somewhere on the mountain, and they come to cry at the Wall because they are sad. This is the reason they give. The second reason—this is the one they won’t tell you—is that they cry because God has forsaken them and they know it. They are angry with God. In the Torah, it says that the final prophet will be Jewish. But they are so angry, because God chose his final prophet from among the Arabs, not the Jews. They are crying because God has forsaken them.”\n\nThe Islamization of the conflict has permeated many levels of Palestinian society. At a funeral march that I attended in Ramallah recently, the struggle against Israel was cast not in modern political terms but in the stark language of an age-old religious war. (Ramallah, of course, was the site of the lynching of two Israeli reserve soldiers last October; young Palestinian men dipped their hands in the blood of the Israelis and waved them in triumph.) The vehemence of Ramallah is one of the consistently surprising aspects of this uprising. Situated immediately to the north of Jerusalem, it is a cosmopolitan city, and many of its residents hold American citizenship. It has fine restaurants and sophisticated hotels. Ramallah is not Gaza.\n\nThe funerals were for two men killed by the Israeli Army in al-Birah, a Ramallah suburb. The Army said that the Palestinians were firing weapons at the nearby Jewish settlement of Psagot. The Palestinians say that the two men were merely helping to move people away from a firefight.\n\nThousands of people attended the funerals. The procession was claustrophobic—too many men for the narrow streets, too much bumping—and the crowd was sullen; a number of the marchers were armed. The bodies were borne on trucks well in front of where I walked. I was stuck behind a Mitsubishi pickup, on which sat a Fatah activist with a megaphone. He shouted, “Give us weapons, O Abu Ammar, and we will set the West Bank on fire!” (Abu Ammar is Arafat’s nom de guerre.) The crowd chanted with him. “O Saddam, send your missiles to Tel Aviv!” Then I heard, from behind me, another slogan taken up by the crowd: “Khaybar, Khaybar, ya Yahud, jaysh Muhammad sawf ya’ud!” (“O Jews of Khaybar, the army of Muhammad is returning!”)\n\nI had not heard this particular slogan since 1991, during the first Intifada, but that was in Gaza, and it was the fundamentalists of the militant Islamic group Hamas who had chanted it. This crowd was beardless—a mostly secular crowd. Khaybar is the name of an oasis near Medina that, in the time of Muhammad, was populated mainly by Jews. In the year 628, Muhammad led the Muslims against it, defeating the Jews in battle and subjugating the survivors, who would later be expelled from Arabia. The intent of the slogan, then, is clear: what the army of Muhammad did to the Jews fourteen hundred years ago in Arabia it would soon do again in Palestine.\n\nAt the cemetery, which sits across a narrow valley from the Psagot settlement, the uprising leader, Marwan Barghouti, arrived to deliver a eulogy. Barghouti, a short, compact man who, in the spirit of Oslo, once told me that he had more than thirty friends in the Israeli Knesset, now looked hollowed out; there were bags under his eyes, and he was accompanied by armed bodyguards. A week before, another Fatah leader, Hussein Abayat, had been assassinated outside Bethlehem by missiles fired from an Israeli helicopter. Two Palestinian bystanders, both women, were killed as well.\n\nBarghouti’s eulogy was more a war cry than a remembrance of the dead: he seemed to tear apart his vocal cords as he spoke. “Heaven is opening its doors to receive these martyrs of al-Aqsa!” he said. “The Israelis are sending our people to Heaven every day. They are killing us every day with helicopters, but they will never be able to destroy us. Look at that settlement!” He pointed in the direction of Psagot. “Those settlers will learn, I promise.”\n\n“Allahu akbar!” the mourners shouted.\n\nIn the distance we heard sirens. “Those ambulances are going to collect the blood of our people,” Barghouti said.\n\nThen Barghouti said something surprising. “Let us close the bypass roads!” He meant the roads, some built recently by the Barak government, that connect the settlements to each other and to Israel proper. These are roads that avoid Arab-populated areas, allowing Jews to drive safely through the West Bank. (The roads, which are patrolled by the Israeli Army, make it difficult for Palestinians to travel between their own cities; they not infrequently must endure the inexplicable delays and petty harassments of multiple Israeli checkpoints.) Many settlers commute to work in Jerusalem or Greater Tel Aviv. When the roads are closed, the settlers are trapped. When they find themselves trapped, the theory holds, many of them will pick up and leave, go back to Tel Aviv. Attacks on roads travelled by Jews have become commonplace—in one of the more notorious, the son and daughter-in-law of the late Arab-hating extremist Meir Kahane were killed in an ambush near Ofra.\n\nBarghouti closed with a message to the gunmen scattered through the crowd. “We are asking everyone not to shoot in the air,” he said. “Don’t shoot in the air at rallies or at funerals. These bullets have a job to do. We need to save these bullets for the important targets.”\n\nThe war of the bypass roads has become a gang fight. There has been no exodus of settlers from the West Bank or Gaza in response to the Palestinian attacks. Instead, many of these settlers—or, more to the point, their young, Israeli Army-trained sons—have become roving vigilantes.\n\nNot long after the funerals, I was travelling at night to a village north of Ramallah. I was being driven by a Palestinian man named Mustafa Nobilsi, who works frequently with Western reporters. As we were driving along a bypass that runs near the Jewish settlement of Beit El, we saw fires burning on the road ahead of us. At the junction, a group of settlers were pouring gasoline over burning tires. Other settlers—maybe twenty of them—had linked arms and formed a human barrier across the two-lane road. There were about fifty in all. They seemed to be in their early twenties, and they wore white shirts, and large knit kippot on their heads. “No Arabs on the road!” one of the settlers yelled. “These are our roads!”\n\nI was afraid the settlers would drag Mustafa out of the car, but then I remembered that he can pass as Jewish. He speaks fluent Hebrew, and his skills include mimicking the chin-forward swagger and impatient speaking style of the young Israeli male.\n\nThe settlers allowed us to pass, and we parked by the side of the road to see what would happen next.\n\nA few minutes later, a truck approached the blockade. It was driven by a man who could never pass as Jewish. The settlers let out a whoop, and swarmed the truck. The driver locked the doors. The settlers pounded on the windshield and screamed for him to turn around.\n\nThen the police arrived, and soldiers from the nearby checkpoint. Fires were burning; the settlers were furious, red-faced. Ten or fifteen of them still stood in front of the truck, not allowing it to move. The police presence emboldened the driver: he opened his door and began cursing the settlers. They cursed back. “You dirty Arab son of a bitch!” a young yeshiva student shouted. “Get off our road.”\n\n“Fuck you, you cunt!” the driver responded, in Arabic. Then, in Hebrew, he yelled, “Son of a whore!” The settlers reached for him, but police officers pushed them back. A chant went up: “Dirty Arab! Dirty Arab!” The police pushed the settlers back again.\n\nMustafa, in the meantime, had sidled up close to the driver, and spoke to him in Arabic. Then he said to me, “He’s a Druze!”\n\nThe Druze are a Muslim sect centered in Israel’s north. They are citizens of Israel, and serve in its armed forces; they are well represented in the border police, where they have gained a reputation among Palestinians for brutality.\n\nI asked the truck driver in Hebrew if he had served in the Israeli Army. He reached into his wallet and showed me a card identifying him as a veteran. The police captain saw this, and said, “He’s one of ours!” The settlers seemed stunned, and moved away from the truck. Mustafa asked the driver why he hadn’t identified himself as an Israeli Army veteran in the first place.\n\n“Fuck them,” he said. “I don’t have to explain anything.” As he drove away he yelled out to the settlers—fellow-veterans of the same Army—“I’m proud to be an Arab, you assholes!”\n\nIn the late nineteen-eighties, I worked for a time on a kibbutz in the Jezreel Valley, southeast of Haifa. I was a great believer in the philosophy known as avoda ivrit—the idea that Jews will redeem their land and themselves by hard physical labor. So I enjoyed working in the chicken houses, great long buildings that were burning hot and stank horribly of the feces of five thousand birds. These were egg-laying birds, on a six-month cycle. After the sixth month, we loaded the chickens up on trucks bound for slaughter. Then it was time to clean out the house. We pulled up the floor slats and hosed them down, and scrubbed the egg-catching machines. All that was left to do was clean out the droppings under the slats, a layer three feet high. I asked the foreman when we would begin shovelling out the house. “We’re not cleaning the shit out,” he said. “We get the Arabs to clean up the shit. That’s why we have Arabs.”\n\nThe Arabs we used in the chicken houses came from the town of Umm al-Fahm, which lay not far away, to the south. Its residents were citizens of Israel, members of its million-strong Arab minority: the Arabs who didn’t leave in 1948, when Israel gained independence. Today, the Arabs of Israel make up about nineteen per cent of the country’s population.\n\nI went to Umm al-Fahm shortly after the beginning of the uprising. The town had exploded. For the first time, large numbers of Israeli Arabs—today, a preferred term is “Palestinian Israeli”—had joined the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza in violent protest. Thirteen Israeli Arabs were killed by the police, two in Umm al-Fahm. Many Israelis, Jews and Arabs alike, felt that the police overreacted; a commission of inquiry has been appointed, and the Barak government has promised to spend about a billion dollars to aid the Arabs, whose towns and schools have been chronically underfunded by the government in Jerusalem.\n\nUmm al-Fahm is one of the most radicalized of the Israeli Arab towns. It is under the control of the northern faction of the Islamic Movement, which is fundamentalist in outlook and denies Israel’s right to exist. The leader of the Islamic Movement in Israel, Sheikh Ra’id Salah, is the town’s mayor. I met him in his office there. An Islamic Movement official, Abdulhakim Mufead, translated, and added his own commentary.\n\nIt is commonly said in Israel that its Arab citizens were rioting not in defense of al-Aqsa but out of frustration with their economic plight—they no longer want to be treated like second-class citizens. I mentioned this to the Sheikh, and to Mufead, and they laughed.\n\n“Al-Aqsa is not a market where everything is for sale,” the Sheikh said. “This is our right as Muslims, to defend al-Aqsa.”\n\n“They think all we want is material,” Mufead said. “They think we’re just bodies, without souls. Money, money, money! This is for our animals. The solution to our problem is not material.”\n\nI was curious, naturally, to hear their opinions of the area’s kibbutzim: unlike the settlements of the West Bank and Gaza, the kibbutzim here are populated not by right-wing Orthodox Jews but by left-wing secularists. My chicken boss aside, the people I knew from the area were not insensitive to their Arab neighbors. But Mufead said, “The kibbutzim are the worst. They’re worse than the settlers. Because they’re hypocrites! They’re part of the same system, but they deny it.”\n\nOn the way out of town, I stopped by the office of Hashem Mahameed, an Arab member of the Knesset. He is not a religious man; he is a former Marxist sympathizer, and I expected his analysis to be more sophisticated than that of his fundamentalist constituents. But what he said was “I think we have learned recently that there’s a little Kahane in the heart of every Jew.”\n\nUmm al-Fahm is situated in the area of Israel known as the Triangle. It holds one of the two major concentrations of Arabs inside Israel. The other area is the Galilee, parts of which have experienced a catastrophic breakdown in the relations between Arab and Jew. There are roughly fifty thousand Jews in the heart of the Galilee, and three hundred and fifty thousand Arabs.\n\nIn the late nineteen-seventies, Ariel Sharon launched a program in the Galilee called Mitzpim, or Lookouts. It was a plan to strengthen the Jewish presence there by building Jewish villages on the mountaintops. The Lookouts program was not controversial among Jews—the Galilee is part of Israel proper, not the occupied territories—and it drew a very different type of Israeli from the hard-core, rifle-carrying right-wingers who were settling the West Bank. Idealistic left-wing Zionists came to the villages in numbers.\n\nToday, there are ten thousand Jews in twenty-eight Mitzpim villages of the central Galilee. The mayor of the regional council is named Erez Kreisler, and one day he invited me to his office in Misgav, a kind of county seat of the Jewish enclave.\n\n“In 1982, the Misgav regional council made a strategic decision about how to deal with the Arab population around us,” Kreisler said. “The council decided that it wanted to live here in peace and coöperation and coexistence. They decided not to be separatists, like the West Bank. It was a major ideological decision.” Roads were built to benefit both the Jewish settlements and the Arab towns; water and sewage lines were connected; a school for Jews and Arabs was opened.\n\n“Most of the people of Misgav are from the left,” Kreisler said. “We wanted not only to speak about coexistence but to practice it.” People in Misgav also tend to be secular, not religious, and the region draws an eclectic mixture of artists and entrepreneurs, and seekers as well: one village is populated entirely by practitioners of transcendental meditation.\n\n“I’m not being patronizing when I say we thought our Arab neighbors could benefit from our being here,” Kreisler said. “I know it may sound like that, but if we weren’t helping they’d say we were discriminating.”\n\nPointing out a factory in the valley below, Kreisler said, “Two thousand Arabs work there. They make underwear for Calvin Klein and Victoria’s Secret. Underwear, but quality. The factory wouldn’t be there if we hadn’t come.”\n\nSo it was a shock to the liberal Jews of Misgav when their Arab neighbors, in the first days of the al-Aqsa Intifada, tried to burn down their villages and hold them under siege for days at a time. As in the West Bank, the Arabs targeted the roads, stoning the Jews’ cars.\n\nBefore my visit, an Arab Galilean named Aziz Haidar, who is now a professor at Al-Quds University, in Jerusalem, had wondered aloud to me how the Israelis could be surprised, saying, “Their idea of coexistence is the coexistence between the donkey and the rider.” I mentioned this comment to Kreisler.\n\n“Bullshit!” he said. “O.K., so the country of Israel was born in a kind of sin. Yeah, there were Arabs here, and they attacked us, and they lost the war and they became refugees—we know the history.”\n\nIn 1947, the United Nations voted to divide Palestine into two states, one Jewish, one Arab. With great reservations, the Jews of Palestine accepted the plan; the Arabs rejected it. When Israel declared independence the next year, Arab armies attacked, and were defeated on the battlefield. In the course of battle, many thousands of Palestinian Arabs either fled from their homes or were expelled by advancing Jewish forces. For most Jews, the question of who started it is easy: the Arabs rejected compromise, and launched a war that they then lost. For the Arabs, the answer is equally easy: the Jews had no national rights in Palestine, and the creation of the refugee crisis is their fault.\n\n“I say that as a Jew it is my right to live in this country,” Kreisler went on. “This is the only Jewish land in the world, and we won’t run out. What do they want? To go back to the beginning and erase everything? To be frank, they wish they didn’t live near us, and the Jews wish they didn’t live near them. But the reality says we have to coexist.”\n\nKreisler said the residents of Misgav are only now opening up, in a limited way, to their Arab neighbors. “Our basketball teams are beginning to play in the Arab villages now.” But something broke when the uprising started, he added, and it can’t be fixed. “People are suspicious now, and that will take a long time to change.” One result of the violence, he said, is that the residents of Misgav, who support Ehud Barak on most issues, do not want to see thousands of Palestinian refugees returning to the Galilee from Lebanon. Or even hundreds. “That would be a lot to ask right now,” he said.\n\nIt is exactly what the Palestinians are asking for right now. In the first, shining years of the Oslo peace process, any talk about the most intractable issues confronting Israel and the Palestinians was assiduously avoided. So it came as a surprise to many in Israel—and to Israel’s friend in the White House—when the Palestinians at Camp David made it clear that they were unready to bring an end to their claims, and an end to the conflict.\n\nI discussed this issue with a friend, Akram Hanieh, who is the editor-in-chief of the newspaper Al-Ayyam. He is an Arafat confidant, and was expelled from the West Bank in 1986. (Ehud Barak, then a major general, signed his deportation order.) Akram made his way to P.L.O. headquarters in Tunis, where he served as a deputy to Arafat’s No. 2, Abu Jihad, until Israeli commandos assassinated Abu Jihad, in 1988. Akram returned to the West Bank in 1994, just before Ramallah came under Palestinian self-rule.\n\nAkram is a literary man. He writes short stories, and he recently published in book form a series of articles about the collapse of negotiations at Camp David, which he attended in his capacity as an adviser to Arafat. He believes that the Americans convinced themselves that the proper setting could induce the warring sides to make peace. He writes acerbically about the atmosphere of Camp David: “[Madeleine] Albright once invited delegates to a movie, and delegates were also invited to play a basketball game. As none of the Palestinian delegates showed up, the Israelis ended up playing with the Marines.”\n\nI asked Akram to explain the Palestinian turn toward violence: after all, the underlying principle of the entire peace process was an agreement to retire the gun and the bomb as tools of negotiation.\n\n“Is building a settlement violence?” he asked. “What about the humiliation of people at the roadblocks?”\n\nAt Camp David, Akram was assigned to the committee discussing the situation of the Palestinian refugees. Arafat’s position is that Israel must accept the principle that any Palestinian refugee or descendant of a refugee has a right to return to pre-1967 Israel. The refugee question has bollixed up past negotiations even more than the fate of Jerusalem. Agreeing to this Palestinian demand, Barak has said, would mean national suicide for Israel; if it were to grant citizenship to the several million members of the Palestinian diaspora, it would cease to be a Jewish state.\n\nA second Palestinian demand is perhaps still more difficult for Israel to meet. Palestinian negotiators are demanding from Israel an admission of responsibility—a statement in which Israel accepts blame for creating millions of refugees.\n\nAkram told me that in 1948 his parents were driven from the village of Abu Shusha by the nascent Israeli Army. The village stood near the place where Ben-Gurion International Airport now stands. If the Jewish claim to the Temple Mount is a cornerstone of the Zionist narrative, then Palestinian victimization in 1948 is the linchpin of the Arab narrative.\n\nIII—THE PRECIPICE\n\nOn a weekday morning last month, I was sitting in the office of Avraham Burg, the speaker of the Knesset. Burg is forty-five, a combat veteran, a founder of Peace Now, and a religious Jew. If Ehud Barak fails to win reëlection, Burg is likely to become the leader of the Labor Party. He is widely considered to be a future candidate for Prime Minister.\n\nAs we spoke, Burg’s secretary announced that Barak was on the line. Burg rolled his eyes. “All of a sudden, he wants friends,” he said. “Listen to my end of the conversation. I’m sure you’ll find it interesting.” Burg doesn’t like Barak. He is not alone: much of the Cabinet is exasperated with Barak as well.\n\nThe Prime Minister was calling to seek Burg’s help: Barak was desperate to block Shimon Peres from launching his own candidacy for the office.\n\n“Ehud, you’re talking to the wrong address,” Burg said over the telephone. “Talk to your Interior Minister.” This was a dig: the minister in question, Haim Ramon, has become a Barak adversary.\n\n“Ehud, listen to me,” Burg continued. “I don’t know what you want from me. We don’t want a Florida here. Talk to someone else on this.”\n\nBurg hung up. “He’s killing me,” he said. “He’s a very smart man, but he lacks emotional intelligence.”\n\nEarly in his tenure, Barak cut out of the peacemaking process most of the Labor leadership—men like Burg and Peres, who had negotiated the original Oslo Accord. Barak was so sure of himself, and of his ability to negotiate an end to the conflict, that he sought no help. Now he stands at the precipice of epic failure, and he is almost entirely alone.\n\nI spoke to Barak last month in his office, in a fortified compound in West Jerusalem just down the street from the Knesset. When we met, he did not seem like a man under any special pressure; he was as relaxed as someone on holiday. He joked, and told stories, and ignored his secretary’s requests to bring the interview to an end.\n\n“I feel very calm and quiet,” he said. “I know that what I’m doing is right.”\n\nFew Israelis agree with this assessment. Ariel Sharon is widely unpopular, but he is destroying Barak in the polls. And those who say they are supporting Sharon over Barak are not necessarily right wing. When polls ask voters to choose between Sharon and Shimon Peres, the result is a tie. Barak, then, is less popular than two of the least popular men in Israeli public life. The fact that potential Sharon voters would jump to Peres, should he replace Barak, means that this election is more about desperation than ideology: Israelis are looking for someone, anyone, to lead them out of the mess.\n\nBarak made perhaps his most fateful decision last spring, when he began to push hard for a final resolution to the conflict with the Palestinians. He was always dubious of the Oslo schedule: he believed, he said, that it was dangerous for Israel to give up territory incrementally without an understanding of the Palestinian endgame. So he pushed for a summit, and the clarity it would bring.\n\n“I had decided that in order to avoid a tragedy, a deterioration into full-scale violence, that we have to—without breaking from our vital interests—just put everything on the table and try to solve it.”\n\nHis reading of Israeli history told him that it was time for painful compromise. “We were clearly heading toward a tragedy that should be avoided,” he said. “I was a lieutenant colonel in the 1973 war, and I witnessed how we moved toward the iceberg collision, blinding ourselves into believing that the Arab world would accept the result of the Six-Day War,” in which Israel conquered the West Bank, Gaza, the Sinai, and the Golan Heights. “That blindness cost us the lives of three thousand Israelis. I have seen how we suffered from hubris. After the peace treaty with Egypt, we went into Lebanon to create a new order there. It was a tragedy, and I put an end to it unilaterally. I was a major general when the Intifada started. Once again, it was a misjudgment of reality to believe that a Jewish democratic state could rule over another people for twenty years.”\n\nAnd so, at Camp David, Barak broke the final taboo, and discussed sharing Jerusalem with the Palestinians. By attempting to fulfill one campaign promise—to bring peace—he broke another: a commitment to keep Jerusalem whole and in Jewish hands. It was, he said, a wrenching moment for him. “Emotionally, I feel like a right-winger,” he told me. “In my head, I’m kind of left. Not left, but realistic, pragmatic. But in my heart I can easily understand the dreams. The first time I went up to the Temple Mount, I got goosebumps.”\n\nBut Barak did not have to resolve the contradiction between obtaining peace and holding Jerusalem. Instead of making a deal, Arafat encouraged an uprising—a political gift to Ariel Sharon—and because of it Barak, trailing by about twenty points in the polls last week, will most likely lose his job.\n\nWhen I asked Barak if he was wrong to trust Arafat, he replied, “I don’t know what it means, to trust. He is the Palestinian leader, not the Israeli leader, and he is determined to do whatever he can to achieve the Palestinian objectives. The real question is not whether we trust him. The question is whether there is a potential agreement that could be better over all for both sides, a win-win, not a zero-sum, game.\n\n“The real task of statesmanship in these situations is not to erase national visions or national dreams. Who else but the Jewish people can testify that no one can erase the dreams of a nation? My objective is not to make the Palestinians stop dreaming or make Islam stop being what it is. . . . We have to make compromises on the practical level. They might be painful, but they might not kill the dreams, and they will establish something that by its own presence will gradually create an incentive not to go back to violence.”\n\nBarak has made many unsettling and contradictory moves in recent months: he alienated his own supporters even more than he alienated his opponents; he told the Palestinians he would not negotiate in an atmosphere of violence, and then did so; he did not take into sufficient account the mystical attachment many Jews feel toward the Temple Mount. But he also did something almost impossibly brave: He broke, in the words of Shlomo Ben-Ami, the “genetic code” of the Arab-Israeli conflict. He offered the Palestinians much of what they said they wanted. He tested the thesis of the right—that the demands of the Palestinians are never-ending. So far, at least, Arafat, despite an offer last week to hold “marathon” negotiations, has done little to disprove that thesis. Sharon may claim credit for revealing to Israel that the Palestinians weren’t ready to make a final deal, but if anyone has lifted the veil it is Barak.\n\nIf the Palestinians continue to reject his compromise offers, Barak told me, he could now lead Israelis to war with a clear conscience: “We will be able to look into the eyes of any mother, father, wife, widow, or children or orphans of an Israeli and tell them, ‘We are now struggling because we have no choice.’”\n\nBack in November, before Sharon knew that he would be a candidate, I asked him to outline his ideas for peace. He said that he would never divide Jerusalem. The Jordan Valley, a strip of the West Bank that protects Israel’s eastern flank, would remain under Israeli Army control, and no settlements would be dismantled. He would try to connect the Arab cities of the West Bank by roads that do not pass through Israeli-held areas. Palestinian refugees, of course, would not be allowed to return to Israel.\n\nAnd when Arafat rejects this plan?\n\n“He can accept it, reject it—I don’t care.”\n\nIn Sharon’s view, the idea that Israel could bring about an end to the conflict was absurd. “You know my position about it,” he said, referring to peace. “It cannot be achieved.” The best that Israel could hope for now was something akin to a “non-belligerency” pact. In other words, an armed truce. (The idea is not the Likud’s alone: several years ago, the spiritual leader of Hamas, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, told me that although religious beliefs would preclude Palestinians from making a permanent peace with a Jewish state, they would allow for a hudna, or truce.)\n\nSharon seemed bored back then when we spoke of political strategy. But he lit up when I asked him how he would suppress the current uprising. Unlike many defense stategists, he believes that there is a military solution to the problem of Palestinian violence. He was quickly transported back to 1970, when he wiped out terrorism in Gaza.\n\n“You always have to think of new things to do,” he told me. “Once, we captured a Lebanese fishing boat. And we filled it with Lebanese food and newspapers and we put our soldiers in it, dressed as Arabs, who spoke Arabic. And they landed on the beach in Gaza, and the Palestinians hid them. They thought they were their people, fugitives. And we were pursuing them ourselves, making believe they were hunted terrorists. The Palestinians took them to meet an important group of terrorists in the northern part of the Gaza district. And when they met them our soldiers killed them. Then they were evacuated out of Gaza. You have to think of things like that. You have to be creative.”\n\nIt was Sharon’s theory, back in November, that if he became Prime Minister the Arabs would fall into line. “They know what I’ve been doing all those years,” he said ominously. Concessions are fruitless. “Israel will not look good, even if we make all the concessions,” he said. “The greater the concessions we make, the harder it will be to look as if we were ever right.”\n\nSharon was blunt on the subject of Arafat. “He’s a murderer and a liar,” he said. “He’s an enemy. He’s a bitter enemy.” Sharon has devoted a great deal of time and energy to Arafat. By Arafat’s own count, Sharon has tried to have him killed thirteen times. Sharon wouldn’t fix on a number, but he said the opportunity had arisen repeatedly. “All the governments of Israel for many years, Labor, Likud, all of them, made an effort—and I want to use a subtle word for the American reader—to remove him from our society. We never succeeded.”\n\nWhen I spoke to Sharon a final time, last week, I heard a somewhat different message. In order to win the election, he needs to convince Israelis that he will not lead them into an avoidable war, and so he has become more cautious in his public pronouncements. His campaign slogan now is “Only Sharon Can Bring Peace.” A few weeks ago, he sent Arafat holiday greetings to mark the end of Ramadan.\n\nLast week, I asked Sharon if he viewed this election campaign as a chance to redeem himself for Sabra and Shatila.\n\n“I don’t have a black cloud over my head,” he said. “What I was blamed for is that I did not anticipate that that might happen. But the heads of the Mossad and Military Intelligence also didn’t anticipate it. Sabra and Shatila is not the only thing I’ve done—or not done, as the case is.”\n\nI asked him if, as Prime Minister, he would attempt to reoccupy areas now under Palestinian autonomous control. “The things that have been done are irreversible,” he said. But when I asked him what he would do if Palestinians used their cities to launch guerrilla attacks on settlements or other Israeli targets, he said, “I’m against escalation, but at the same time I will defend the lives of Israeli citizens. And I don’t think I have to elaborate. The Arabs know me. And I know them.”\n\nDuring the fall, Sharon suggested to me more than once that only the strongest measures could possibly avert war. In Ofakim, he told an audience of two hundred Russian immigrants, “Israel is a strong country, but it behaves like a weak country.”\n\nThe Russians were mostly old and used to being ignored, so this visit by Sharon to their desert outpost was a full-dress occasion; the men had pinned to their suit jackets the medals they won in the Second World War, and the women, thick-legged matrons with gold teeth and rheumy eyes, carried their best purses.\n\n“Tonight, I will speak to you the way a soldier speaks to soldiers,” Sharon said. The Russians applauded furiously. “In the past, it was forbidden to lynch Jews in this country. We wouldn’t have allowed this then. But do not worry. We will soon return to the way things used to be. We will find ourselves again, and we will learn how to respect ourselves.”\n\nLater that evening, he told a group of high-school students, “For you, now is the time for service. Service in the Army, service in the combat units, the Air Force, Intelligence. That’s what your role is: to become educated and to serve. That’s all I have to say.”\n\nOne of the students happened to draw Sharon’s attention: a seventeen-year-old boy who wore a gold ring in his pierced eyebrow.\n\n“What is that?” Sharon asked, astonished.\n\nThe boy mumbled something about self-expression.\n\n“Well, it doesn’t matter,” Sharon said. He spoke matter-of-factly. “Soon you’ll go into the paratroopers, and you’ll have to take it out, or else it will get caught in the line of your parachute.” ♦"
