        "text": "Staying in Likud means wasting time in political squabbles rather than acting on behalf of the good of the country.\n\nAt a news conference announcing that he was leaving Likud to form a new political party, 21 November 2005\n\nI came here with a message of peace. I believe that we can live together with the Palestinians. I came here, to the holiest place of the Jewish people, in order to see what happens here and really to have the feeling of how we need to move forward. There was no provocation here: the provocation was only on the other side.\n\n28 September 2000 after Ariel Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount - known to Muslims as the Haram al-Sharif - in Jerusalem. Palestinians rioted afterwards and the secondn intifada (uprising) ensued.\n\nEverybody has to move, run and grab as many [Palestinian] hilltops as they can to enlarge the [Jewish] settlements because everything we take now will stay ours... Everything we don't grab will go to them.\n\nAs foreign minister, in comments broadcast on Israeli radio in November 1998\n\nNot for a moment did we imagine that they [the Christian Phalange militia] would do what they did... They had received harsh and clear warnings. Had we for one moment imagined that something like this would happen, we would never have let them into the camp.\n\nAnd:\n\nI'm the only minister of defence in the world - the only one - who left his post and went back to work on a tractor, on his farm, as a result of what Christians did to Muslims. The only one.\n\nIn 1993, after being forced to resign from his post as defence minister. An official Israeli Commission looking into the 1982 massacre of Palestinians at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in Lebanon had found Sharon responsible for failing to give suitable instructions to prevent or reduce the danger of a massacre before allowing the Lebanese militia into the camps.\n\nWhile civilian deaths were a tragedy, the Qibya raid was also a turning point.... [It] was now clear that Israeli forces were again capable of finding and hitting targets far behind enemy lines. What this means to army morale can hardly be exaggerated.\n\nFrom Sharon's autobiography Warrior. In 1953, Sharon's special army commando \"Unit 101\" blew up more than 40 houses in Qibya, a village in the West Bank, then ruled by Jordan. The raid, in which 69 Arabs died, was a reprisal for a Palestinian guerrilla attack. Sharon later said he thought the houses were empty."
