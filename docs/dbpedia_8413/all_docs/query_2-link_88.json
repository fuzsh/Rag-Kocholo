        "text": "Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpinion\n\nWhat a view\n\nby Stephen McCarty\n\nWhat a view\n\nby Stephen McCarty\n\nNetflix disaster series Japan Sinks: People of Hope and Apple TV+ show Invasion examine our impending doom\n\nHuman activity and global warming threaten to submerge part of the country in Netflix’s Japan Sinks: People of Hope, an adaptation of a 1973 disaster novel\n\nAn alien race threatens our planet in Apple TV+’s Invasion, while Netflix series The Billion Dollar Code tells how a duo sued Google in 2014 over software\n\nLook, absolute climatic apocalypse with the associated planetary destruction isn’t all bad: at least it’s inspiring multiple artistic endeavours, among them another adaptation of Sakyo Komatsu’s 1973 disaster novel Japan Sinks, seen previously as an animated series.\n\nComing soon to Netflix is the live-action season one of Japan Sinks: People of Hope, in which human activity (primarily seabed drilling) coupled with global warming threatens to submerge the Kanto region. But don’t worry, say the elected leaders and other establishment yes-men: Japan has always been here, therefore it always will be.\n\nUpsetting the apple cart of complacency is seismologist and calamity predictor Yusuke Tadokoro (Teruyuki Kagawa). Because he’s a maverick scientist whose eccentricity means he even talks like a cartoon character, most suits consider him easily dismissible. Less convinced are the environment ministry’s Keishi Amami (Shun Oguri) and journalist Minori Shiina (Anne Watanabe), who must shatter the culture (and conspiracy) of conservatism to save lives.\n\nBureaucrats fiddling while the world burns isn’t a new story – although it has remained current for decades. Much like the sacrificing of solid science for the sake of economics and political popularity ratings.\n\nBecause why not aliens?\n\nYou always know bad news is coming when a television programme shows a deserted Shibuya Crossing (a famous intersection in Tokyo). It’s a kind of shorthand for disaster.\n\nAnd aside from the more blunt catastrophe shows (see above), it is impossible in the current climate not to think of every such programme as an allegory about, well, the climate. Especially if peppered with sandstorms, fires, frazzled crops and shrinking ice floes.\n\nInvasion, now streaming, is another whistles-and-bells cinematic feast from Apple TV+ and visualises our fate – were an alien species to decide it was time we moved over. Fair enough: it’s difficult to imagine anyone making a worse job of preserving it.\n\nIn Yemen, a camel herder reaches out to touch a slippery, amorphous creature that has fallen from the sky; in New York, the lights go out and houses are torched; horrified Japanese mission controllers discover their space capsule has disintegrated; and in Oklahoma, Sheriff John Bell Tyson (Sam Neill) spots an impact crater whose creators are certain to ruin his impending retirement.\n\nAnd so the series continues, dropping in on scenes of confusion and devastation around the world. At least there are strong women in the shape of Mitsuki Yamato (Shioli Kutsuna) and Aneesha Malik (Golshifteh Farahani) to provide some leadership. But when all telecommunications collapse even they must face the mortifying prospect of a world without mobile phones. Disaster!\n\nWhen hackers sued Google\n\nComputer nerds! All aboard for a time trip back to the swinging Berlin of the early 1990s – all grunginess, illegal raves and thumping techno music. The young hackers of the Chaos Computer Club, plus their artist friends, are inventing a means of calling up, onto a computer, a map of anywhere on the planet and zooming in, Superman-style.\n\nSound familiar? Four-part Netflix series The Billion Dollar Code tells how Juri Müller (Marius Ahrendt and Misel Maticevic) and Carsten Schlüter (Leonard Scheicher and Mark Waschke) sued Google in 2014, with their software central to the case.\n\nTerravision is hardly the name on the world’s lips these days, whereas Google Earth seems to be something else the planet can’t live without. Something perhaps built on the naivety of two forgotten visionaries. But while we are cheering for the little guys hopelessly taking on the monster corporation, we can nevertheless indulge in some retro-mania thanks to Onyx computers, Silicon Graphics and clunky VR headsets."
