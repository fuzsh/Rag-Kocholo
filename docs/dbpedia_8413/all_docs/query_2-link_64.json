        "text": "Noriyoshi Ohrai is one of my favourite poster artists, responsible for many iconic pieces of art used to advertise films including The Empire Strikes Back, The Goonies and several fantastic posters for the Heisei series of Godzilla films. Until recently the artist was almost a complete enigma to me since there was little information about him online beyond the basics and there are certainly no English-language books that have been written about his life and career.\n\nWhen it was announced that an exhibition featuring practically all of Ohrai’s original artwork would be held in Japan during February/March 2014, which was to be the first time any of Ohrai’s art had been seen in public since his last exhibition in 1981, I knew that I had to make every effort to attend.\n\nIn March 2014 I flew over to Tokyo and then a few days later took an internal flight down to the Island of Kyushu with my friend and fellow poster collector Toru Onozatu (AKA Poster-man). The exhibition was located in the Art Center in downtown Miyazaki, which is the city that Ohrai has called home since 1973. We were very lucky to have been given a personal tour by the curator Tatsuya Ishida who kindly guided us around the exhibition’s multiple rooms that were spread over two floors. I recorded his comments as we walked and they are featured throughout this article.\n\nThe exhibition featured almost all of Ohrai’s original art for film, book covers, video games, editorial work, biology text books and more, with only a tiny handful of the film art missing (some with their current location unknown). A lot of the art still belongs to Ohrai himself but some of it had been flown to Miyazaki from collectors including George Lucas (for some of the Star Wars pieces), as well as the Japanese studio Toho who lent several of the Godzilla artworks to the exhibition. It was certainly a unique situation that all of these paintings were gathered together under one roof.\n\nThe exhibition began with a room containing a floor-to-ceiling pyramid of paperback novels and magazine covers that Ohrai worked on over a 30 year period, and this was surrounded by walls covered in framed posters of Ohrai’s film and commercial work. It was certainly a thrill to see them all together like that. The rest of the exhibition, in which photography was not permitted (I’ve included a handful of cheeky snaps), went through themes, beginning with Godzilla, moving onto book and magazine covers and a display of gigantic, incredibly detailed video game cover artworks. Also featured were some incredibly impressive portraits of famous figures, plus a room featuring Ohrai’s ‘Beauties in Myths covers for SF Adventure magazine. The last room contained posters for the Star Wars franchise, plus more film posters and several war-related paintings.\n\nI wanted to share the visit with Film on Paper readers and the following pictures will hopefully give you an idea of what this memorable experience was like, plus I’ve also had the biography from the back of the exhibition catalogue translated into English and that is included at the end. Also featured are several photographs of pages from the catalogue since I was unable to actually photograph the artwork.\n\nMr Ishida explained to Toru and I that Ohrai worked on about 1300 book covers during his career and that the pyramid of books contained only about a third of his total output. In 1986 alone he worked on 130 book covers and he was completing a new illustration every 3 days or so.\n\nFor each book he would read it first and then think about what would make the best cover. He wasn’t just being given a title and then making something up. Mr Ishida explained that Master Ohrai did quite a lot of work for a few specific book authors and he developed a particular style for each one so that their books became instantly recognisable. In the 1970s he would get paid about 150000 Yen for each book cover.\n\nNoriyoshi Ohrai was born in Akashi City, Hyogo prefecture in 1935. His family was evacuated to Sendai City, Kagoshima Prefecture after their house was bombed during the war and Mr Ishida told us that Ohrai went to an art university in Tokyo but dropped out after a while. Mr Ishida said, “he told me that the reason why was because he felt he had nothing more to learn from the teacher”.\n\nOhrai moved to Miyazaki from Tokyo in 1973 because it’s his wife’s hometown. He bought an old farmhouse and converted part of it into a studio.\n\nOhrai started out doing illustrations for newspapers then moved onto book covers and eventually started doing more and more posters after the huge success of the one he painted for The Empire Strikes Back.\n\nOhrai’s first film poster was for the 1973 film Japan Sinks and he painted it in his new studio.\n\nMr Ishida explained that the turning point for his work on film posters was definitely after George Lucas had asked him to illustrate one for The Empire Strikes Back. After that he was very much in demand.\n\nOhrai understood how a painting would look when printed at a certain scale, so he used certain techniques that meant he didn’t have to spend too long on details that wouldn’t be noticed when it was scaled down to book size.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s there were some Japanese video game manufacturers like Koei and Konami who commissioned Ohrai to do elaborate paintings for their game covers. The actual paintings, which were on display , were huge and for each he would get figures like 1 million yen and more. Mr Ishida explained that the companies own the paintings outright so they kindly leant them to the exhibition.\n\nOne of the first pieces of artwork on view in the exhibition was for The Return of Godzilla and Mr Ishida explained that Ohrai drew the buildings with perspective in the background and then he painted Godzilla right over the top of it, not around it. Apparently he would often do painting in layers like this.\n\nAnother Godzilla artwork on display was for Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla II (1993) and we were told that when the painting was sent to print the colours were darkened and you could definitely see the difference when looking at the original art. Also the logo covers some of the detail.\n\nThere were lots of paintings of spaceships, used for book and magazine covers, on display and Mr Ishida explained that they were almost all from Ohrai’s imagination. He was a massive fan of the film Alien and was very inspired by it.\n\nOne of the rooms contained all of the paintings that Master Ohrai worked on for the SF Adventure magazine in Japan that was dubbed Beauties in Myths. He was commissioned to do a series of paintings that started in 1980 and lasted for almost 8 years. The theme he chose was depicting famous women from history and myths, like Queen Elizabeth I and Messallina, wife of Roman emperor Claudius, alongside modern military technology and sci-fi apparatus. The paintings were absolutely stunning and crammed with detail. The actual magazines were printed at around A5 size so Ohrai was able to hide various details in the art (see below).\n\nOhrai painted a lot of scenes and characters in space and he liked to experiment with different colours. His space scenes were often either green-tinged or purple/pink.\n\nFor the drawings of old battleships when he couldn’t find a reference photo he would research the actual engineering plans and so his drawings are incredibly accurate.\n\nMr Ishida said that there are many artists of Ohrai’s generation and of his skill level that traveled to cities like New York, establishing big studios and holding prestigious exhibitions. Ohrai wasn’t interested in the fame or earning lots of money, he just wanted to paint; “He’s a real artist without any greed”.\n\nOhrai still owns most of the artwork, with the exception of the Godzilla paintings, which are the property of Toho studios, and the game covers that are owned by the companies.\n\nOhrai never left Japan once so he painted many things from his imagination. He had a brain aneurism in 2011 and he’s okay now but he can longer draw sadly.\n\nAfter finishing our guided tour from Mr Ishida, Toru and I were presented with the four B2 posters used to advertise the exhibition (and not for sale to the public), which was very generous and I’ve added these to the Film on Paper poster archive. There was also a shop from which were able to purchase the exhibition catalogue as well as a few other goodies like artwork prints, postcards and more.\n\nThe next day Toru and I returned to the exhibition for a second look around without Mr Ishida to soak in the artwork once more. It will always be up there as one of the most memorable art exhibitions I have ever seen and if the exhibition is ever repeated I urge all Film on Paper readers to try and attend.\n\n————————————\n\nTo see the other posters I’ve collected by Ohrai click here.\n\n———————————–\n\nNoriyoshi Ohrai Biography\n\nThe exhibition catalogue features an extensive biography at the back but, frustratingly for me, it’s all in Japanese. My good friend Brian who has lived in Japan for several years helped to translate the majority of it and I felt it was worthwhile publishing it. The translation below features several footnotes.\n\nNovember 1935 (Showa era year 10[1])\n\nNoriyoshi Ohrai is born in Akashi City, Hyogo Prefecture.\n\n1945\n\nEvacuated to Sendai City, Kagoshima Prefecture (present day Satsumasendai City)[2].\n\n1951 (Showa 26)\n\nEntered Kagoshima Prefectural Sendai High School (Japanese name: Kagoshima kenritsu sendai koutougakkou)\n\n1954 (Showa 29)\n\nEntered a painting course in the Fine Arts Dept of Tokyo University of the Arts.

Green is best for bringing out depth. The interior becomes deeper. If you think about the wondrous colour scheme of cell biology, whatever colours may be in outer space won’t seem strange.’\n\n———————————\n\nFootnotes\n\n[1] Showa era ran from December 25, 1926 to January 7, 1989, corresponding with the life of Showa Emperor Hirohito.\n\n[2] Sendai City (川内市）in Kagoshima Prefecture no longer exists; not to be confused with present day Sendai City (仙台市）in Miyagi Prefecture.\n\n[3] According to Kodansha’s own literature, the company was founded in 1909, which doesn’t match with 1966 being its 60th anniversary!\n\n[4] I think Ohrai did the illustration on this English edition.\n\n[5] As with other names, I’ve written his name in western order (given, surname), but in English translation he’s often credited as Edogawa Rampo, Japanese-style.\n\n[6] At first I thought 一寸法師 (Issun Boushi) referred to a famous Japanese fairytale, often translated into English as ‘The Inch-High Samurai’ , but it refers to a 1926 story by Rampo, featuring one of his main recurring characters, translated as ‘The Dwarf’ . I don’t know if ‘The Dwarf’ is based on ‘The Inch High Samurai.’\n\n[7] Japanese wikipedia says that Ohrai did the cover, frontispiece and illustrations for ‘Wolf Guy.’\n\n[8] Literally means ‘Day of Resurrection’, but English title is ‘Virus’\n\n[9] English listing here.\n\n[10] I’ve translated it as ‘Japan Sinks’ (that’s how Sakyo Komatsu’s original book was translated), but the English release of this film was called ‘Tidal Wave’\n\n[11] http://www.amazon.ca/Japan-Diary-Goemon-Kadokawa-Bunko/dp/4041308054\n\n[12] Japanese English title ‘From Darkness Tiger’\n\n[13] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsengumi\n\n[14] See here.\n\n[15] This is the cover.\n\n[16] See here.\n\n[17] I’m not sure if this means a crew of Americans, or a Japanese crew working in America!\n\n[18] See here.\n\n[19] Difficult to think of a punchy English translation – literally means ‘Human beings that get destroyed / will be destroyed’. Think it has a fatalistic ring to it, so perhaps something like ‘Humanity Doomed to Destruction’ might be apt?\n\n[20] Satsumasendai City didn’t actually exist until 2004 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satsumasendai,_Kagoshima). At the time it would have been Sendai City (see footnote 2)\n\n[21] This series is still going – it’s called Dynasty Warriors on PS4 and PS3 etc"
