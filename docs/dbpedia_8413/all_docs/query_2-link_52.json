        "text": "This is going to revolutionize the field of space archaeology!\n\nOriginal Japanese Version\n\nSayonara Jupiter has been my white whale for so long but finally, after so long, today is the day I have finally managed to sit down and watch it and boy is it so much better than its reputation suggests. I'll admit it's no masterpiece with a fair amount that doesn't quite work and is almost comparable to being a retread of Gorath but on a solar level. I will say that Bye-Bye Jupiter as it's also known, as a whole, it's greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nIn the 22nd century, scientists from an energy-depleted Earth research new fuel sources in the far corners of…\n\nWhat happens when you take Japan's most brilliant science fiction writer, one of Toho's most underrated directors (who would go on to make one of the greatest Godzilla films), an up and coming visual effects director and give them one of the most lavish productions and budget for a Japanese science fiction film? Turns out nothing like you'd ever expect...\n\nSAYONARA JUPITER is certainly a film with a lot of effort put into it. The special effects and production design are just gorgeous. Toho really gave Kawakita and co a lot to work with here because these are easily some of the best visuals I have seen for a space film. This can easily stand toe to toe with contemporary…\n\nwhat a mess of a movie! and i think i liked it??\n\nmy god is the pacing awful. the plot is at times, incredibly confusing and hard to follow. the acting from almost all of the non japanese performers in this is just abyssmal. its so hilariously bad. but its so bad that i cant hate it. i kind of love it. so bad its good kind of vibe.\n\nthis movie also features a zero gravity sex scene. they float naked through the cosmos. its great. we should put more zero gravity sex scenes into our movies.\n\nsayonara jupiter really drags throughout most of its runtime. but then it gets...really good in the last 20-ish minutes? i geniuenly really loved…\n\nLet’s Blow Up Jupiter\n\nThis is such a strange movie, it is low budget high concept hard sci-fi from the 80s. It is about as commercially impossible as a documentary about the 17th century hedgerows of Alsace. It is slow, it is strange, and I am absolutely here for it. It might be the time of day, it is late on Thanksgiving, I’m mostly full of turkey and its chilly so I am disinclined to move at all but I really got on this movie’s wavelength. It is a strange combination of weighty sci-fi, naked zero-G sex, a cult led by a dolphin, and then laser gun battles. It feels like one of those niche animes like Legend of Galactic…"
