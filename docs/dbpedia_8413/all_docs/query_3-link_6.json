        "text": "By Curt Phillips: As those who know me best are all too aware, I’m hosting a radio show every Friday evening this summer on WEHC-FM, the public radio station of Emory & Henry College in Emory, VA. So far, that show has been called “Class of ’77” and has featured classic rock or other music that I felt like playing — such as the Seattle band ThorNton Creek, who sent me some fantastic review CDs recently. I’ll be playing them heavily on my August 5th show and you should all tune in for that because it’s one of those great bands that no one’s discovered yet. Check their website at www.thorntoncreek.com and you’ll see what I mean.\n\nMy Friday night show will come to an end in September and so for my final show I’m throwing the airwaves open to any music makers or creators of audio wonders within the sound of this e-mail. If you are a musician (and I define that term loosely) and you’d like a chance to be heard on a radio station with a potential world-wide audience (via our streaming audio broadcast on the world-wide web), send me your recordings. If you know a good band or musician that would like a little exposure, send them this note and suggest that they send me their recordings.\n\nNow, I’m only distributing this initial announcement within Fandom (if you’re part of it you know who I mean) and a very few select friends simply because I want to start it that way, but each of *you* may forward this announcement to anyone or anywhere you like. I trust you. You have generally good taste. Go forth, spread the word, and make me proud… I admit that I’ll listen a little closer to anything sent to me by a known fan or someone I recognize (and yes, I’d love to get enough good material to make an all-fannish show), but I’ll try to listen to every submission I receive and give it a fair hearing. If I get over whelmed, know that I’ll try to do my best. I can’t promise personal responses to each submission, but I’ll try to do that too.\n\nYou can send your CDs (sorry, no tapes), or vinyl records to me at the mailing address below. I prefer CDs (and CD-Rs are fine, by the way), but if you want to e-mail me an audio file I can accept it but I’ll have to run it through virus software before I can even listen to it and if time grows short, guess which format will go unlistened to first? If you want your cd’s returned I’ll be glad to do so IF YOU ENCLOSE a stamped, self-addressed mailer to return them with. Otherwise I’ll not be able to return them, sorry.\n\nAll submissions should either be licensed through BMI or ASCAP, or should otherwise be your own work. Your submission of the material shall be considered to be your release to Curt Phillips and/or WEHC-FM to air that material with no compensation. All submissions must be identified by title and name of artist as you prefer, and a little background information on the material and artist would be good to have too. I’ll probably quote such material in my on-air introductions. All submissions should be air-play ready and should comply with all requirements and restrictions of the Federal Communications Commission. In other words, no bad language and no plagiarized material. If you sample, please identify the sources.\n\nThe station is WEHC-FM, 90.7 Emory, Virginia, USA, and the live audio stream can be heard at http://www.ehc.edu/wehc . Click on the “Listen Live” link at the top of the page. My show is heard every Friday night through this summer from 7:30 to 9:00 p.m. Eastern Standard time and I invite you to listen in. And also to my Old Time Radio drama and Big Band music show every Sunday afternoon from 3:30 to 5:00 p.m. on the same station.\n\nI’ll consider any submission in any length (but remember, this is a 90 min. show), genre or style. All the material has to do is impress me. The deadline is Friday, Sept. 2, 2011. And Sept. 2, 2011 at 7:30 p.m. is when this one-time show will air. Any questions? Ask me. Otherwise, ready, set, go…\n\nCurt Phillips\n\n19310 Pleasant View Dr.\n\nAbingdon, VA 24211\n\nUSA\n\nE-mail: Absarka_prime (at) comcast (dot) net\n\nMichael Burstein wondered if the Post Office in West Newton, MA where Isaac Asimov once got his mail is among those the USPS is reviewing for potential closure. An example of Asimov’s letterhead with his old West Newton address appears at Letters of Note.\n\nThe USPS says it may close some of its 32,000 retail offices nationwide because more customers are doing their postal business online or on smartphones. The shuttering of these small offices will certainly be felt in their neighborhoods:\n\nThe West Newton Post Office also on the list, is on Waltham Street, just steps from the police station and movie theater. Toward closing time yesterday, about a dozen people stopped by to pick up and drop off letters and packages.\n\n“You feel like you’re losing all of the community feel when they close all these little branches,’’ said Lynne Georgian, 53, of West Newton.\n\nEd Seiler believes Asimov’s post office is not on the hit list:\n\nThere are three post offices in the area: West Newton 02465, at 525 Waltham St., Auburndale 02466, at 2122 Commonwealth Ave., and Newtonville 02460, at 914 Washington St.\n\nAs you can see in the Horn Book letter [on Letters of Note], his postal code at the time was 65, which I believe is equivalent to 02465. I think that 45 Greenough Street is still in 02465, although it is extremely close to the border of 02466.\n\nThe picture caption clearly indicates Newtonville, and [an old New York] Times article describing his first-in-the-morning pickup and disposal of junk mail jibes with In Joy Still Felt, so I’m inclined to think that the Washington St. post office is the one at which he picked up his mail, and that location does not appear to be on the list.\n\nAsimov’s memoir In Joy Still Felt dramatically retells his experience of being in line at the local post office when a car nearly crashed into the building:\n\nIt was an automobile, hard up against a telephone pole just outside the post office, with the driver slumped over the wheel. There was no mystery about what had happened. The driver had had a heart attack while driving, and was dead. Had he been pointed in a slightly different direction at the moment of attack he would have gone through the glass front of the post office and all of us in line might have been killed.\n\n[Thanks to Michael Burstein, Jamie Todd Rubin and Ed Seiler for the story.]\n\nUpdate 07/28/2011: Revised story to address Seiler’s information."
