        "text": "In the next of my posts about movies which I studied for my article “Disaster Narratives by Design: Is Japan Different?“, I am writing about Shuto Shōshitsu (首都消失) (Toshio Masuda, 1987), known in English as Disappearance of the Capital or Tokyo Blackout. Like The Core, this was a movie which pushed the boundaries of what sort of science fiction movies were included in the study.\n\nA summary on IMDb about the movie is as follows:\n\nBased on a science-fiction novel by Sakyo Komatsu. Tokyo is suddendly covered by a dome shaped electromagantic cloud for an unknown reason and is totally blocked and isolated from other parts of the world. The temperature inside the cloud is slowly increasing. The Soviet Pacific fleet is getting closer. The U.S. is forcing Japan to form a new governmemt. Scientists and research workers outside Tokyo have to race against time to find out how to get through the cloud in order to rescue the 12,000,000+ lives in Tokyo and the fate of the country.\n\nhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094160/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0\n\nPerhaps if I had come across this movie earlier in my study I would have been tempted not to include it due to its science fiction content. However, I had already viewed a range of English-language narratives, and, thanks to these, had refined what types of science fiction stories would be included. As Shuto Shōshitsu doesn’t have monsters and extra-terrestrial invaders, it was included although it seems unlikely a disaster like this would ever happen."
