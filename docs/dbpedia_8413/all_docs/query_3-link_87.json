        "text": "Hello, Kaiju Lovers! This year for Godzilla Day (Nov. 3), Toho celebrated the 50th anniversary of Godzilla vs. Megalon with the release of the short film, “Operation: Jet Jaguar.” In it, everyone’s favorite smiley superhero robot (and Jimmy From NASA’s “sidekick”) battles Godzilla in epic fan service at its best. But it’s more than just that. Nate waxes philosophical about it in this special mini-sode as part of Ryan “The Omni Viewer” Collins’ Minus One Monstrous Moment series on YouTube.\n\nScript by Nathan Marchand.\n\nAdditional music:\n\n“Jet Jaguar’s Theme (SYNTH COVER)” by Alyssa Charpentier (https://youtu.be/kG71Y1FnJk0?si=CVjp63CKf-eRYtRz)\n\n“Global Defense Force: Jet Jaguar” by Heavy Melody Music (from Godzilla Unleashed)\n\nSound effects sourced from Freesound.org.\n\nCheck out Nathan’s spinoff podcasts, The Henshin Men and The Power Trip.\n\nWe’d like to give a shout-out to our MIFV MAX patrons Travis Alexander; Danny DiManna (author/creator of the Godzilla Novelization Project); Damon Noyes, The Cel Cast, TofuFury, Eric Anderson of Nerd Chapel, Ted Williams, Wynja the Ninja, Brad “Batman” Eddleman, Christopher Riner, The Indiscrite One, Jake Hambrick, Edwin Gonzalez, Matt Walsh (but not that Matt Walsh), and Jonathan Courtright!

This week he discusses the almost-forgotten hard sci-fi tokusatsu film from 1984, Sayonara Jupiter (aka Bye Bye Jupiter). It was something of a transitional film for Toho since its cast and crew included players from both the Showa and Heisei eras, including Akihiko Hirata (in his final role), Sakyo Komatsu (author of Submersion of Japan), Koichi Kawakita (FX director for the Heisei Godzilla series), and Koji Hashimoto (director of Return of Godzilla/Godzilla 1985). Unfortunately, the Hollywood-caliber special effects can’t save it from an overstuffed script that has a Jupiter Solarization Project, an eco-cult/terrorist group, and Nazca lines on Mars, among other things. If the film is known for anything, though, it’s the (in)famous zero gravity sex scene (which may or may not be intrepid producer Jimmy From NASA’s favorite part). Yep.\n\nAfter Nate gets into all of this, he reads some listener feedback in the form of three new Apple Podcasts reviews and then gets a visit from Monster Island’s security chief, Captain Douglas Gordon, who brings along a famous friend he says is upset with Nate. This leads to an important announcement about MIFV’s next episode series.\n\nAfter the credits, Nate and Jimmy are visited by Jessica, still fresh off of her exploits as magical girl superheroine Crystal Lady. She’s been given some, shall we say, “special” earrings by the nefarious Monster Island Board of Directors. Let’s just say Nate and Jess butt heads more than usual because of them.\n\nGuest stars:\n\nSarah Marchand as Jessica Shaw\n\nEpilogue Parts 1-2 (“Introducing Godzilla Redux” and “Influencers”) written by Nathan Marchand.\n\nAdditional music:\n\n“Chant My Name!” by Masaaki Endo\n\n“in case…” by BiSH\n\n“Opening the Way” by Pablo Coma\n\nSound effects sourced from Freesound.org, including one by InspectorJ, and the Toho Foley library.\n\nWe’d like to give a shout-out to our MIFV MAX patrons Travis Alexander and Michael Hamilton (co-hosts of Kaiju Weekly); Danny DiManna (author/creator of the Godzilla Novelization Project); Eli Harris (elizilla13); Chris Cooke (host of One Cross Radio); Bex from Redeemed Otaku; and Damon Noyes!

This heavily-edited Americanized version of Gamera the Giant Monster was given the Godzilla, King of the Monsters! 1956 treatment—but it’s far less interesting as a movie and as a piece of kaiju film history. Nate details the key differences—one being the de-emphasis of Psycho Kenny, er, Toshio-san—and explains the rather mundane reasons for why the movie was drastically changed. Also, he gives the Board-appointed “king of the monsters” a new nickname: “Gamera-Double-M.”\n\nUp next: Godzilla vs. Kong!\n\nWe’d like to give a shout-out to our MIFV MAX patrons Travis Alexander and Michael Hamilton (co-hosts of Kaiju Weekly); Danny DiManna (author/creator of the Godzilla Novelization Project); Eli Harris (elizilla13); Chris Cooke (host of One Cross Radio); Bex from Redeemed Otaku; and Damon Noyes!

Think of it as a kaiju film without a kaiju. It’s based a novel by Sakyo Komatsu, who Adam describes as “the Japanese Michael Crichton.” The novel was a blockbuster, and this film was an even bigger hit. You can tell this was what Toho invested most of their money into and not Godzilla vs. Megalon that year. Adam and Nate discuss the film’s better-than-Hollywood special effects, the horribly truncated and re-edited U.S. version called Tidal Wave made by Roger Corman, and the film’s wrestling with Japanese national identity, among other things.\n\nAlso, Nate’s “pseudo-sister” magical girl superheroine clone, Jessica, meets him just before the broadcast to let him know she just moved back to Monster Island.

It was supposed to be an epic episode on Godzilla vs. Kong…but instead Nathan is joined by Matt and Gratton from the “Giant Monster Ben Shapiro,” er, “BS” podcast to discuss Space Amoeba (aka Yog, Monster from Space), a weird lesser classic from the Toho tokusatsu library. Released in 1970, it marked a shift in the Showa era for Toho films. This was the year special effects wizard Eiji Tsuburaya died, the studio contract system was discontinued in Japan, and Ishiro Honda left Toho, just to name a few big changes. Jet Jaguar hung out with the intrepid Jimmy From NASA in the producer booth to act as a “dump button” in case the GMBS boys went full-tilt HBO on a family show. They along with Nathan discuss the film’s quirky characters and plot, its three well-executed but almost forgotten monsters, and the wonders of the “Weedmobile” before Jimmy is called away to quell a rowdy Godzilla and Kong with his newly rebuilt Mechani-Kong. That goes about as well as you’d expect, so Nathan, Matt, and Gratton have to pilot another giant robot to save his intrepidness.\n\nMerry Christmas and Happy New Year, kaiju lovers!\n\nRead Jimmy’s Notes on this episode.\n\nListen to Matt and Gratton’s episode on Space Amoeba.\n\nThe prologue and epilogue were written by Nathan Marchand.\n\nThis episode features sound effects sourced from www.FreeSound.org, Brand Name Audio, and the Pipeworks/Atari Godzilla video games.\n\nThe music tracks heard in this episode are “Global Defense Force: Moguera” by Heavy Melody Music (from the Godzilla Unleashed OST) and “King Kong 2 – Main Theme (Metal Cover)” by Sharp Rain Music.\n\nThe episode thumbnail was created by Michael Hamilton.\n\nWe’d like to give a shout-out to our Patreon patrons Travis Alexander and Michael Hamilton (co-hosts of Kaiju Weekly); Danny DiManna (author/creator of the Godzilla Novelization Project); Eli Harris (elizilla13); Chris Cooke (host of One Cross Radio), and Bex from Redeemed Otaku!

Brothers\n\nWriting Giant Monsters by John LeMay\n\nHello, kaiju lovers!\n\nThis week’s episode is a “traditional” mini-analysis of Latitude Zero, an almost obscure 1969 Toho science fiction film directed by Ishiro Honda, who probably had to take a dip in the “Bath of Immunity” to endure the stress of making it. To say it was harrowing would be an understatement. This strange American/Japanese co-production has a troubled history full of clashing sensibilities and creative differences (which you can hear more about in MIFV episode six). However, the main topic of the episode is the concept of utopia because Latitude Zero seems to be a rare example in fiction of a successful one. Spoiler warning: Nathan doesn’t buy it.\n\nAfterward, Nathan and Jimmy are visited by the Monster Island Board of Directors’ executive assistant, Ms. Perkins, who is the Island’s head of PR. She wanted to discuss recent “fake news” being spread by Jimmy From NASA and also announce the Board’s decision on Nathan’s proposals for season two of MIFV. All this plus listener feedback!\n\nThis episode features Celeste Mora as Ms. Perkins (Twitter: @VOCelesteMora).\n\nThe song heard in the episode is “Opening the Way” by Pablo Coma, which is a remix from the video game Shadow of the Colossus.

Nathan is joined by Travis Alexander, co-host of Kaiju Weekly and the biggest Baragon fan we know (#Justice4Baragon), to discuss this wild if uneven Toho classic directed by Ishiro Honda. We discuss the film’s relation to the hibakusha, the discriminated survivors of the atomic bombings, because Frankenstein’s plight in the film mirrors their real-life struggles. Also, Travis gets to meet Godzilla’s bumbling nephew, Godzooky (he’s practically Travis’s spirit animal), who helps Jimmy From NASA in the producer booth because he’s still reeling from his beatdown at the hands of Daimajin.\n\nEpisode image created by Michael Hamilton.\n\nWe’d like to give a shout-out to our Patreon patrons Travis Alexander (of course) and Michael Hamilton (co-hosts of Kaiju Weekly); Danny DiManna (author/creator of the Godzilla Novelization Project); Eli Harris (elizilla13); Chris Cooke (host of One Cross Radio), and Bex from Redeemed Otaku!
