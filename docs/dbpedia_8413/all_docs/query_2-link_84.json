He was a graduate of Kyoto University where he studied Italian literature. Reading Abe Kobo and Italian classics made Komatsu feel modern literature and SF were the same.

His story The Savage Mouth was translated by Judith Merril and has been anthologized.\n\nIn 1984, Komatsu served as a technical consultant for a live concert in Linz, Austria by Japanese electronic composer Tomita Isao.\n\nHe won the 1985 Nihon SF Taisho Award.\n\nKomatsu was one of two Author Guests of Honor at Nippon 2007, the 65th World Science Fiction Convention in 2007 in Yokohama, Japan.
