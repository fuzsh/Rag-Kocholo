A novel which was both an enormous best seller in Japan and the basis for a very popular film. The Japanese archipelego is being wrenched by enormous forces - a parable for our times on how we deal with natural disasters, the consequences of global warming, national identity and the essential relocation of millions of people. Translated from the Japanese by Michael Gallagher. 184 pp. Very good in a good dust jacket (some sunning to the edges of the boards, rubbing and edgewear to the dj) - JAPAN SINKS.",
