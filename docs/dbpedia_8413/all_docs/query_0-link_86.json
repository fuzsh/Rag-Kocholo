        "text": "Highly acclaimed late science fiction writer Sakyo Komatsu is attracting renewed attention for his short story, \"Amerika no kabe\" (American wall), with fans calling it a prophetic tale of the United States under the administration of President Donald Trump.\n\nThe short story by Komatsu, known for such novels as \"Nihon Chinbotsu\" (\"Japan Sinks\") and \"Fukkatsu no hi\" (\"Virus\"), will be made available for download as an e-book starting Feb. 10.\n\nFirst released 40 years ago in 1977, \"Amerika no kabe\" describes the U.S. under a president who upholds the slogan of a \"shining America.\" Three years into the presidency, a wall suddenly appears, cutting North America completely off from the rest of the world, both physically and communication-wise. Both the president and American citizens become introverted and withdrawn, resulting in widespread isolationism.\n\nThe book is currently available in e-book form as part of Komatsu's short story collection titled \"Amerika no kabe,\" but the softcover version is sold out. Starting Feb. 10, the short story will be available as an e-book for 100 yen in the first month, and for 200 yen thereafter.\n\nAn increasing number of people who had read Komatsu's \"Amerika no kabe\" had been taking to the internet to point out the parallels between the book and President Trump's remarks and presidential orders, with some saying that \"reality was growing closer to science fiction.\"\n\nAccording to Komatsu's former assistant, Junko Otobe, the book was written shortly after the Vietnam War, and Komatsu, through close friends, one of whom had formerly worked for the U.S. State Department, had some knowledge about the internal struggles going on in the U.S. government. Otobe believes that Komatsu also understood the worn-out state of American society.\n\nSays Otobe, \"Komatsu watched a U.S. that had seen itself as the world's policeman and upheld the standards of justice become shattered by the Vietnam War and lose its confidence. That may have been the foundation of which the story was built.\""
