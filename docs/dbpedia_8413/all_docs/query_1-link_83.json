        "text": "\"A chillingly realistic work of science fiction.\"The New York Times.\n\nAfter dropping anchor for the night near a small island to the south of Japan, a crew of fishermen awaken to find that the island has vanished without a trace. An investigating scientist theorizes that the tiny island has succumbed to the same force that divided the Japanese archipelago from the mainlandand that the disastrous shifting of a fault in the Japan Trench has placed the entire country in danger of being swallowed by the sea.\n\nBased on rigorous scientific speculation, Japan Sinks recounts a completely credible series of geological events. The story unfolds from multiple points of view, offering fascinating perspectives on the catastrophe's political, social, and psychological effects. Winner of the Mystery Writers of Japan Award and the Seiun Award, this prescient 1973 science-fiction novel foreshadowed the consequences of the 1995 Osaka-Kobe earthquake and the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami.\n\nDover (2015) republication of the edition originally published by Harper & Row, New York, 1976.\n\nSee every Dover book in print at\n\nwww.doverpublications.com"
