        "text": "In 1964, when the Japanese media started playing up the Japan World Exposition Osaka 1970 as the next big event to follow the Tokyo Summer Olympics, science fiction writer Sakyo Komatsu (1931-2011) formed an Expo 70 study group with six other people, including academics.\n\nTokyo at the time was undergoing, in Komatsu’s words, “tremendous construction chaos” due to Olympic-related investments. He was alarmed by the prospect of the same madness occurring in the Kansai region in and around Osaka.\n\nAfter a few months of intensive discussions, Komatsu’s group concluded: “Depending on how Expo 70 is held, it could turn out to be a highly worthwhile event.”\n\nLater, some of the group members became directly involved in the project, such as drafting the basic principles of Expo 70.\n\nIn a book he later published, Komatsu chronicled his struggles in organizing the event. I read the book and was deeply impressed by his fervent commitment to the cause.\n\nFor instance, in his determination to honor the theme of “Harmony and Progress for Mankind,” he traded sharp words with government officials who sought to use Expo 70 as a platform for promoting Japanese exports instead.\n\nKomatsu was in his 30s at the time and still quite “green.” He had yet to write his epic 1973 novel “Nihon Chinbotsu” (Japan Sinks).\n\nBut young and callow as he was, he could not have been more right with his assertion: “Expo 70 is a means, not an end.”\n\nAnd he went on to declare that the purpose of Expo 70 “is to seek and find a better future for the entire human race. ... and build a world where there will be less pain and suffering.”\n\nWhat about the 2025 Osaka Kansai Expo, which is scheduled to open less than 500 days from now?\n\nThe project’s costs keep snowballing, construction of foreign pavilions is being delayed and some nations have decided to drop out.\n\nAnd instead of the ideals of this event, we are hearing excuses from authorities trying to escape responsibility, alongside optimistic projections of the expo’s economic benefits.\n\nPast expos have pointed to humanity’s “prospects.” Will the 2025 expo be able to present images of an attractive future? In this era of armed conflicts continuing in the world, is it really possible to talk about hope?\n\nI cannot help but suspect that holding this event is the sole purpose for the organizers.\n\n--The Asahi Shimbun, Dec. 4\n\n* * *\n\nVox Populi, Vox Dei is a popular daily column that takes up a wide range of topics, including culture, arts and social trends and developments. Written by veteran Asahi Shimbun writers, the column provides useful perspectives on and insights into contemporary Japan and its culture."
