        "text": "When it comes to Japanese disaster narratives there is one that stands out from the crowd, Nihon Chinbotsu (日本沈没), “Japan Sinks“, by Sakyo Komatsu. That’s not to say that it’s the best story or the movies are the best, but it stands out as being particularly iconic. And there have been many different versions in part due to this.\n\nI have previously written a post about the two movie versions, which I had studied for my article about disaster movies. There has also been an animated version (see “Japan Sinks 2020” – Japan Gets That Sinking Feeling… again). Then there was a TV (live action) adaptation – “Japan Sinks – People of Hope” (日本沈没-希望のひと).\n\nThis year marks the 50th anniversary of the publication of the original book and to tie in with this Nippon.com has a feature article about the book, including an interview with Takeshi Hamei who worked at the publisher which originally published the book. You can read the article here.\n\nThere are many interesting bits of information about the book. In particular I was interested about the writing process, about the second part that has never appeared, and the way in which issues of Japanese identity are discussed within the book. This is something that continues to be a part of my research and also in my book “Japan: The Basics”."
