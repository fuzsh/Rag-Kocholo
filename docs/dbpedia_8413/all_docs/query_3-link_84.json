        "text": "This introduction provides a comprehensive historical, cultural, and political background for the individual chapters in this edited volume. It examines the sociopolitical and literary scenes, genre issues, main authors and their works, and major characteristics of Chinese science fiction in various historical periods in modern China: the emerging period from the Late Qing to the Republican Era; the socialist Mao era from 1949 to the late 1970s; the post-Mao thaw period from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s; and the new wave period from the late 1980s to the 2010s. This introductory chapter demonstrates that Chinese science fiction represents a significant contribution to modern Chinese cultural production, both in terms of its value, speaking powerfully to our modern condition, and its sheer volume in terms of production and consumption. It speaks to China’s rapidly shifting sociocultural ambiance, its political complexity, and its unpredictable future, voicing the anticipations and anxieties of a new epoch filled with accelerating alterations and increasing uncertainty. The genre unfolds invisible and hidden dimensions of and beyond China’s contemporary realities and weaves together new trends in science and technology, ethics and aesthetics, and public versus private lives."
