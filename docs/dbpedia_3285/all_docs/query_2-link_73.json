        "text": "Three X-Men-related books out today, Uncanny X-Men #1, From The Ashes #9 and today's Avengers #17 get all post-Krakoa on us.\n\nArticle Summary\n\nStorm joins the Avengers as Sam Wilson recruits her out of guilt, setting a new direction for Marvel's mutant team-ups.\n\nUncanny X-Men #1 introduces Warden Ellis and a disassembled Xavier's School, raising stakes for mutantkind.\n\nX-Men Unlimited: From The Ashes #9 dives into Limbo with Madelyne Pryor, exploring deeper mutant storylines.\n\nGail Simone’s Uncanny X-Men spotlights Rogue uniting mutants and addresses her complex sexuality and history.\n\nThree X-Men-related books out today, Uncanny X-Men #1, From The Ashes #9 and today's Avengers #17, as Captain America, Sam Wilson, is recruiting Storm to join – and lead – The Avengers, he is doing it partially out of guilt.\n\nWhile Captain Marvel may have condemned them for missing Blood Hunt, and Black Panther hits back, the Orchis situation was a little more cut and dry.\n\nSo the Avengers need a mutant on board… and the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver don't count anymore. So Storm is up… as Havok is otherwise engaged.\n\nIn today's X-Men Unlimited: From The Ashes #9, in Limbo with Madylene Pryor, not looking his best.\n\nThough they may all be safe from Doctor Ellis and Captain Ezra, approaching Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, most recently Xavier's School for Higher Learning, over in the new Uncanny X-Men #1.\n\nAnd it is being stripped for parts.\n\n\"Warden Ellis\". Well, that's one way to get him back into Marvel Comics I guess. Just a little R&D switch. And yes, quite an uncompromising and harsh Warren Ellis type character, just without the smoking and the personal tech obsessions.\n\nOkay, maybe some tech obsession. Public hangings on Netflix? Might they get Mister Beast involved, I hear he is looking for something new. As for the other X-Men titles…\n\nX-Men: From The Ashes Unlimited has Madelyne Pryor literally talking about the soap story structure cycle… While in Uncany X-Men, mutants still being hunted, literally, like deer. Because some of them are deer.\n\nBring out the Garth Marenghi at this point I think.\n\nAs for the other X-titles and how they will interact…\n\nX-Men from Jed MacKay and Ryan Stegman are doing their own thing.\n\nWhile Exceptional X-Men by Eve L Ewing and Carmen Carnero are doing theirs. A definite textual separation between the books.\n\nBut with Harvey X, a definite attempt to show the legacy of the X-Men throughout, back to the original appearance of Krakoa as well…\n\nSetting up the perfectly timed return of Rogue, Gambit and Gambit's accent.\n\nAs well as Gail Simone's answer to Rogue's sexuality, bound up as it is with all the memories and life experiences of people she has absorbed over the years…\n\nHer sexuality is X-Men. That should do it…\n\nAnd even Polaris and Havok are back together again. The cycle turns and turns and turns back again.\n\nUNCANNY X-MEN #1\n\nMARVEL COMICS\n\nJUN240610\n\n(W) Gail Simone (A/CA) David Marquez\n\nPROFESSOR X…IS GONE!\n\nA core group of essential X-Men rise FROM THE ASHES to face a world without a home – and without Professor X!
