The comic book series spurred on 10 television shows and six films (and counting), with movie spinoffs on the way.\n\nThe newest Spider-Man television series, Marvel’s Spider-Man, is set to premiere later this year on Disney XD. The latest film installment, Spider-Man: Homecoming, is directed by Job Watts and stars Tom Holland alongside Michael Keaton, Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans and Zendaya. The film hits theaters July 7.\n\nBelow is a list of the Spider-Man films and television moments leading up to its most recent iteration."
