        "text": "This isn't really a discussion thread, but I guess we could make it one if we want, but its more so just something I've always wondered. So...why was Spectacular Spider-Man cancelled? I LOVED that show. It was honestly the best Spider-Man series ever, WAY better than the 90s series. It had a fresh and interesting take on the character and his villains that I hadn't seen in a long time. And Josh Keaton was perfect in the role of Spidey.\n\nThey had planned a third season, but for some reason, it was cancelled before production could begin. That really annoys me cuz it feels like it was left unfinished. They never resolved the Peter/Gwen relationship. And although, I was never a fan of Peter/Gwen pairing, I still wanted it to run its course. But, I would have eventually wanted it to follow the comics and have Mary Jane become his primary love interest. Well, without Gwen dying, that is, lol. I would also have liked to have seen so many more of Spidey's villains come into the series, like Hydro-Man, Scorpion, Swarm, Vermin, and, of course, Jackal. They did after all introduce Miles Warren, but he never realized his fully villainous potential.\n\nI guess it was for the best. If Spectacular Spider-Man wasn't cancelled, then we wouldn't have gotten Young Justice, which is just as good, if not better. But I still miss it. And Greg Weisman could have multitasked. At least, that's what I think. Anyway, what do you guys think? Did you want a third season out of Spectacular? And more importantly, why was it cancelled in the first place???\n\nBad Timing\n\nI blame it simply on bad timing Spectacular Spider-man probably suffered from the worst timing of any show ever, you might even say it suffered the \"Parker Luck\" but that would be dumb.\n\nAnyways the show ending up on Kids WB six months (or was it three) before the block died was the first problem. This was really the start of the show having no perminate home in america until it was too late. No one knew where the show was going to end up for a while while season two was already airing everywere else in the world. The second season was completed and most of the crew had moved on to new things before the show even had a new home on Disney XD.\n\nThe Disney buy out of Marvel did not make things better since one thing Disney wanted to go was to take everying over unify the animated shows in house and stuff like that. For them making a new Spider-man series was probably easier then continuing Spectacular Spider-man, and honestly that was probably for the best. I mean what if Disney continued Spiectaular Spider-man but did not bring back most of the original crew. The end result could have been like Goliath Chronically\n\nSo really I blame bad timing and bad luck for why Spectacular Spider-man ended so soon, ended before it's time.\n\nBut ah I guess the stuff with Sony had a lot to do with it to if not more.\n\nThere's more to an active fanbase than simply demanding that your favourite show be brought back. If fan participation is cut off and everyone just writes the show off as an aborted project, how is it going to leave a legacy of any kind? That's the type of organized fan response Spectacular is continuing to lack, and at the current rate I fear that in a few years it will be nothing more than an obscure might-have-been remembered only by a handful of people.\n\nGenerally I've found the fanbase rather vocal in their support in the show, it even got #2 of IGN's \"Top 25 Comic TV Series\" list right behind BTAS, but they're not very active. I haven't found much fan art around, especially compared to other fandom's, and the animosity with the 90s fans certainly didn't help.\n\nI think the art style is what kept some people away. If the show had more detailed art and the same level of animation we might've seen a more active fanbase. I like the artsyle and don't see what's wrong with it other than a few design quirks, but every style has it's own quirks.\n\nThat's certainly what Marvel and DXD are banking on with Ultimate. Even if the show winds up being a mess, they're going to ensure that it overshadows TSSM both currently and historically through sheer overexposure alone.\n\nI think it's a bit premature to say what's going to happen with USM. Marvel and DXD are probably hoping to have it overshadow the critical acclaim of SSM, but that doesn't mean it'll happen. We'll see what happens.\n\nThis thread is like salt in the wound.\n\nDisney wont even reair the show late nights on DXD like the other Marvel series.\n\nWhat kind of world do we live in when Spider-Man Unlimited which didn't even have a proper season conclusion much less a series conclusion and less than 26 episodes gets rerun constantly and Spectacular Spider-Man with a neat little package of 26 episodes that at least had a semi-conclusion doesn't get re-aired at all and half the series still isn't on Netflix IIRC but all the entirety of the other Spider-Man series that are on Netflix are as complete as they'll ever be.\n\nI'm glad it at least got DVDs and that I happen to own those DVDs but man, Spectacular Spider-Man deserves better than to be shoved under the rug like this. Especially since Ultimate keeps getting delayed and when it shows up I'm sure they'll have no qualms with airing their usual trio of Spider-Man series late nights on DXD while Ultimate gets the daytime slots.\n\nAt least give it a few more runs before Ultimate finally airs. That's not that much to ask for people who don't have the DVDs.\n\nSpectacular Spider-Man was victim to a series of unfortunate events and ultimately was shelved so Disney could produce their own Spider-Man cartoon. Really it just sucks but the show just couldn't catch a break.\n\nI personally don't mind if there isn't any more Spectacular Spider-Man. I could never really get into it since, as someone else mentioned, I didn't care too much for the art style. And that's very hard for me to say knowing that this came from the guy who created Gargoyles, which is still something that's difficult to believe when the former show is so obviously better looking and the difference in how the two look is so night & day to me. Ultimate Spider-Man is looking to be more like something I would watch, so Spectacular Spider-Man probably could have grabbed my interest better if it had that same amount of effort and Venom didn't seem so ridiculously simplistic looking.\n\nAnd I'll admit, I'm probably only saying that I don't mind if the show is gone cause I was never that into it from the start. I would occasionally see \"peeks\" of it on Disney XD, but I guess I must have been too busy watching 90's Spider-Man and wishing that I had Toon Disney back.\n\nAnd that's very hard for me to say knowing that this came from the guy who created Gargoyles, which is still something that's difficult to believe when the former show is so obviously better looking and the difference in how the two look is so night & day to me.\n\nGreg Weisman is a writer not an artist. He did not create the designs for either show and only really had a hand in approve the style and designs for the shows.\n\nFurthermore Gargoyles had a larger budget than SSM and what they wanted to do with SSM, animation wise, was a lot different than what they did with Gargoyles. Greg Weisman and Vic Cook decided that for SSM they really wanted to showcase Spidey's agility, that he would be jumping all over the place essentially, and in order to do that with the budget they had to get a really simplified and stylised art style. The animation in SSM is very fluid and does what they set out to do.\n\nGargoyles and SSM both used design principles from Bruce Timm's Batman TAS. Simplified designs equals better animation.\n\nso Spectacular Spider-Man probably could have grabbed my interest better if it had that same amount of effort and Venom didn't seem so ridiculously simplistic looking.\n\nEffort had nothing to with it. A tremendous amount of effort was put into the animation to make it as smooth and as lively as possible. The fight scenes were amazing, Spidey doing anything looked stunning. None of the animation I've seen so far from USM looks half as good as SSMs animation (imo). The designs for USM look nice but there hasn't been enough footage released for me to think the animation is going to be better than SSM.\n\nI'm also not sure why you singled out Venom when he looked like Venom normally does and no different or didn't have more simplistic design than anyone else."
