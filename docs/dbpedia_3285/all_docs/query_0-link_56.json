        "text": "Tart Time Machine\n\nby Wolfen Moondaughter\n\nTwo years ago, to commemorate the release of the first Spider-Man movie, I wrote an article that was a predecessor of sorts to this column. In it, I took readers on a walk through the non-comic side of Spidey, talking about the various animated series that had featured him, among other things. This year, I thought I'd see what my fellow Tarts had to say about their non-comic Spidey experiences, as well as talk a little about the newest cartoon, which had not yet aired at the writing of the original article.\n\nFirst up, Rebecca Salek talks about Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends, which was co-produced by animation giant Lee Gunther, and ran on NBC, in one form or another, from 1981 to 1983.\n\nRebecca S: Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends was one of my favorite Saturday morning series when I was a kid. I knew nothing about Marvel or the Marvel Universe at that time ... I just loved the show. Basic premise: college students Peter Parker (Spider-Man), Angelica Jones (Firestar) and Bobby Drake (Iceman) discover each others' identities and team up to battle the various evils which threaten their small midwestern town. I loved the characters, especially Firestar; I think I had my little self half-convinced that someday I would have fire powers, too. I loved the voice-over narration by Stan Lee; even at that age, I recognized it as over the top - but it was fun over the top. I even loved the setting; after all, I lived in a small midwestern town, too. ;)\n\nThe animation was another matter. Not so hot. :( Even by the standards of the early '80s, it was rough. But it was bright and the fastpaced stories did a pretty good job of distracting me from any shortcomings in the animation, at least until I got older.\n\nMy favorite episode of all was Firestar's origin story (Mine too! - Wolfie). She was the unpopular girl at school, constantly picked on by the In Crowd. Then she got her fire powers, and she used them to save her father's life when he fell from a skyscraper, and got revenge on the cruel girls who had tormented her. And as her powers grew and her ability to control them grew, so did her self-confidence. She matured and became more sure of herself. What a metaphor for the lives of so many teen girls! :)\n\nMy other favorite episode was a time travel story. Two teens from the distant future accidentally traveled back in time and met Spider-Man and Firestar and Iceman. Naturally, the girl from the future (totally blanking on her name) and Peter fell in love. He decided to live in the future with her and give up being Spider-Man. For some reason never clearly explained, he couldn't survive in the future and so returned to the present, heartbroken. So sad! (You know, I thought I remembered an episode like this, but then thought I must have just imagined it! I wish I could see it again now! - Wolfie)\n\nAnyone know if this series was ever picked up by another network? I don't know. Did it ever air on, say, Cartoon Network? Or Nickelodeon? Or USA, back when that station aired old cartoons? I wouldn't mind seeing it again, if only for nostalgia reasons. :)\n\nWolfie here again. In answer to Rebecca S's question, they made videos; I have a few. I wouldn't be surprised if they start going to DVD, since the old '60s cartoon has.\n\nAnd now to pass the reins over to Rebecca Henely, so she can share with us her feelings on the series that ran on Fox from 1994 to 1998 (and featured one of Spider-Man's creators, Stan Lee, as one of the executive producers!)\n\nRebecca H: What was the Fox series of Spider-Man about? What were any of them about? A young man named Peter Parker who gets bitten by a radioactive spider and gets superpowers, duh! However, the Fox series had one thing that all of the other animated series did not: it was actually reasonably close to the comic. Mind you that the principal words here are \"reasonably close.\" In fact, there was a lot that was different from the comic book. However, the Spider-Man Fox series was significant for keeping the spirit of the comic books - particularly when it came to portraying the chaos of Spider-Man's life.\n\nBut of course I had no way of knowing that at the time. When I was 11 or 12 I was an absolute TV zombie and during the '90s Fox had a really fun line-up of cartoons on Saturday morning. My brother and I would start watching the boring shows at about eight or nine and go on until Spider-Man, which came on at eleven, was over. I originally started watching Spider-Man because I loved superheroines, and was waiting for that glorious day when the Black Cat (who up to then I had only heard about) would make her appearance. However, to my shock I found that not only did I relate to Spider-Man the most, but I related to him more than any superheroine I had come across.\n\nSpider-Man was a character to be both loved and pitied. He was so selfless and tried so hard, yet life always seemed to deal him a bad hand. My life started to change for the worse at 12, and I found a sympathetic voice in Spider-Man. Not only that, but he was so, so funny. Or at least I thought so at the time. Now that I'm older he's not so gut-busting, but at 12 he was right up there with my favorite comedians.\n\nThe character of Peter Parker/Spider-Man wasn't the only thing that drew me. The action was fun, as was his romance with the lovable Mary Jane Watson. While Spider-Man doesn't have my favorite canon of villains (that honor goes to Batman, even though I don't like him very much), many of their stories proved interesting. I especially liked the Vulture - an old man desperately in search of his lost youth.\n\nHowever, I'll be the first to admit the show had its problems. Christopher Daniel Barnes was a good Spider-Man, but whenever he had to scream or get angry his acting got really, really horrible. Even at 12 I remember being really embarrassed during these scenes. Also, the show seriously fell apart at the end. The mystical mumbo-jumbo with Madam Web got very tiring (although Stan Lee's wife gave her a fun voice), as did the nonsense with Mary Jane being a clone made out of water. I guess one can make the argument that the show did plan to go on for another season, but could they really have done anything after Spider-Man met Stan Lee? (I remember that! Talk about jumping the shark! - Wolfie) It was a cute moment, but I think after that the show really couldn't take itself seriously again. Luckily, it was the last episode.\n\nOh and ... let's not talk about the horrible theme \"song.\" (Which was performed by Aerosmith's lead guitarist, Joe Perry, if I'm not mistaken. - Wolfie)\n\nStill, for all its problems, the Fox series represents a special place in my heart. It was the show that introduced me and started my love for Spider-Man. Even though there have been times when I haven't read his books (like now ... aargh! I'm so poor), in my heart Spider-Man reigns supreme and I have this show ... this fun, over-censored, silly show ... to thank.\n\nWolfie here; thanks, Rebecca H! And let's not discuss Spider-Man Unlimited, the \"sequel\" series to the Fox series, which saw Parker trapped on an alternate earth. Far as I'm concerned, it doesn't exist. (Sorry Rino Romano; I loved you as Eduardo, but Christopher Daniel Barnes, in my mind, will always be Spider-Man.)\n\nSo I guess this bring us to the latest animated MTV (which, as far as I know, is on indefinite hiatus), the first thirteen episodes of which are available on DVD.\n\nI was excited when I first heard about it; MTV had given us the likes of Liquid Television (which included Aeon Flux) and Daria, so I hoped this meant that their take on Spidey would be more \"adult\". I'd also heard that the series was going to pick up where the movie left off, although such turned out to not actually be the case; instead, it's only a similar scenario. Okay, fine, I can deal with that. Because hey, Ian Ziering as Harry! Loved him as Vinny on Biker Mice from Mars! (Yeah, okay, and he was good as Zack on Beverly Hills 90210.) And Lisa Loeb as Mary Jane! I love her song Stay. And Brian Michael Bendis, the genius behind the Ultimate Spider-Man comic, was the executive producer! So it has to be good, right?\n\nI wish it were so. Oh, the show's not terrible, don't misunderstand me. The writing is fine, I suppose, although I've only seen a few episodes, and none all the way through (I kept forgetting when it was on and what channel MTV was on my cable.) I confess to certain biases from the start.\n\nI don't hate Neil Patrick Harris (yeah, I watched Doogie Howser, MD - admit it, you watched it too!), but I read an interview with Christopher Daniel Barnes (who was also the voice of Prince Eric in The Little Mermaid, as well as a fine face actor in the series Day By Day, and played Greg Brady in the two Very Brady spoof movies) in which Mr. Barnes had said he really hoped to be cast as Spidey's voice in the series. And then he wasn't. I was more than a little pissed. Harris just is not Spidey, to my ears.\n\nAnd I'm not the biggest fan of computer-animated TV series. Most of them - and this series is no exception - use \"motion tracking\" to animate them, where someone wears a body suit that moves the characters onscreen, sort of like a puppet. You'd think that it would make the animation look more natural, but to me it comes off quite the opposite, making it virtually unbearable to watch. And it doesn't help that I hate the character designs for this series. Spidey in particular looks like a really bad action figure. The only plus to the look of the series is the cell-shading, a type of colouring used in 3-D animation to make it look more like traditional, 2-D animation. Well, that and the colours themselves. Wolfie likes bright colours. :)\n\nI wish I could tell you more about my thoughts on the story, but try as I might, I couldn't find a copy of the DVD to rent, and I can't really remember the episodes I saw. I do somewhat remember an episode where Spidey was in a building where people were being held hostage, and Peter was flummoxed as to how to save them without revealing his identity. I think I liked that one, overall. I do think the series is worth looking at, so if you can find the first season to rent, give it a shot. But as far as buying it goes ... well, as you can see, I wasn't willing to shell out the bucks for this article. But maybe that's just me."
