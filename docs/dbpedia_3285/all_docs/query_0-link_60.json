        "text": "In December 2018, Sony Pictures Animation released the film \"Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse\", which had Miles Morales/Spider-Man meet with other spider-powered superheroes from alternate realities, including Gwen Stacy/Spider-Woman, Spider-Ham and alternate versions of Peter Parker/Spider-Man. While the film has an impressive list of celebrity guest voices, such as Hailee Steinfeld as Spider-Woman and Nicolas Cage as Spider-Man Noir, none of the alternate Peter Parkers are voiced by any previous Spider-Man actors in film or television. With so many talented actors to choice from, we would like to see the Into The Spider-Verse sequel include any of the following actors as alternate reality Spider-Men:\n\n- Nicholas Hammond, who starred in the live-action 1970s \"Spider-Man\" television series\n\n- Christopher Daniel Barnes, who was the voice of Spider-Man for five seasons on the Fox Kids network's \"Spider-Man\" animated series and various TV commercials\n\n- Rino Romano, who provided the voice of Spider-Man for the short-lived \"Spider-Man Unlimited\" animated series and the two Neversoft \"Spider-Man\" games\n\n- Tobey Maguire, who portrayed Spider-Man in the original \"Spider-Man\" film trilogy by Sony from 2002 to 2007\n\n- Neil Patrick Harris, who provided the voice of Spider-Man for the 2003 \"Spider-Man\" computer-animated series on MTV and the voice of Spider-Man in the \"Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions\" video game\n\n- Josh Keaton, who provided the voice of Spider-Man on the Kids WB network's \"The Spectacular Spider-Man\" animated series and the video game \"Spider-Man: Edge of Time\"\n\n- Andrew Garfield, who played Spider-Man in Sony's two \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" movies directed by Marc Webb\n\n- Tom Holland, who currently plays Spider-Man in the films made by Marvel Studios, who made his debut in the film \"Captain America: Civil War\"\n\nWhether they could voice any alternate reality versions of Peter Parker/Spider-Man or provide the voice of other spider-powered heroes, such as Miguel O'Hara/Spider-Man 2099, we, the fans, feel it would be fun for Sony to bring back previous Spider-Man actors to be involved with the sequel."
