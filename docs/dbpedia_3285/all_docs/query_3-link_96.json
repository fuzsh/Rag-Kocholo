        "text": "Even though I found Across the Spider-Verse incredibly disappointing, I would be interested in a few of the figures on this list. It doesn't specify, but I'm assuming the Gwen would be in casual clothing like the listed Miles. I would hope Spider-India would have as much detail as Spider-Punk did. Would be a bit of a let down otherwise. Not sure how I feel about the Spider-Man Unlimited figure being in a Spider-Verse wave. Kind of makes sense, but makes me wonder how accurate it'll ultimately be.\n\nOnly figure from the comic Spidey wave that catches my eye is Arachno-Man. He'd be an easy but kind of fun repaint of the Ultimate Spider-Man figure. Don't know where I'd put him in my collection, but I'm sure I'd find a spot. Looking at the wave as a whole, it would be kind of cool if the BaF was Princess Python's giant snake, lol.\n\nThe X-Men Legacy wave is intriguing. The wave seems mostly based around the third film, but with the additions of Cyclops and Nightcrawler. I'll have to see how the figures turn out before putting any thought into which ones I would get. Even though I greatly prefer his look in Deadpool and Wolverine, a figure of Hugh in the black gear he wore early on would be kind of cool. Kelsey Grammar's Beast would also be really tempting, especially if he's wearing the jacket he had.\n\nEdit: Just realized that, with the exception of Wolverine, the wave could be themed around the Dark Phoenix movie. Beast would become an easy pass for me, but Cyclops would be kind of tempting for me.\n\nHopefully next year will have a Disney+ wave at some point. I really want a figure of Echo.\n\nPosted by: @bolt\n\nHoping this is true, an entire wave like that of Fox X-men Legends would make me really happy! Guessing they would be from assorted movies/eras like before. If its just from one movie, I think the only movie that would really line up is X-Men Apocalypse.\n\nThat was exactly my thought. Nightcrawler and Beast were only together in Apocalypse, right? I admit I didn't see Dark Phoenix. And I have always longed for figures of the team at the end of Apocalypse.\n\nBut I wonder if it's more spread out than that. They could easily do each of those from different movies, but I definitely won't buy anyone wearing a black leather costumes, except maybe Storm."
