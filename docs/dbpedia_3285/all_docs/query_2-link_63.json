From Saturday-morning cartoons, to the latest installments from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Disney+ has quickly become the exclusive home to Marvel TV shows and movies that cater to fans both new and old.\n\nStudio chief Kevin Feige announced at the Disney Investors Day presentation last year that 2023 would see massive releases on Disney+, especially with the studio taking the reins on producing new original TV content. But for now Disney+ has the highly-anticipated X-Men ’97 series coming up, as well as a trove of existing Avengers and MCU content all in one place. If you’re wondering where the latest release The Marvels fits into the MCU timeline, or how to watch everything in order, it’ll require some jumping around the different Marvel Phases. That being said, we’ve got you covered on how to watch every Marvel movie and series in chronological order (and release order).\n\nHow Can I Watch Disney+ Online Free?\n\nIf you want to get up to speed on the most important Marvel storylines, or jump straight into recent films come to streaming like Ant Man and the Wasp: Quantumania online, it’s easy to sign up for a Disney+ subscription. Disney+ subscribers can watch it on-demand from their TV, laptop, tablet, phone, or gaming console.\n\nA monthly subscription to Disney+ will get you all the ad-free content at just $7.99 a month. You can save yourself some cash when you sign up for a year-long plan instead at $79.99 (about a $14 discount). Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+ have also teamed up to offer a bundle deal that gets you access to all three streamers for just $13.99 a month.\n\nIf you are a Verizon subscriber, you may be eligible for their “Disney+ on Us” deal, which gets you six months of Disney+ for free. Get the deal or see if your current Verizon plan qualifies here, which will let you stream all the MCU movies and series on Disney+, including Avengers: Infinity War, plus offerings from Pixar, Star Wars, National Geographic, and more.\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nHow to Watch the MCU In Chronological Order\n\nBefore The Marvels comes to streaming, you can re-watch all the other Marvel movies and TV series currently available on Disney+. If you’re a tru MCU completist, this is the ultimate guide to watching the events of the MCU play out in chronological order, even if time travel shenanigans might make things a bit complicated. If a TV series or film takes place during multiple time periods, we’ve listed it where the bulk of the plot takes place.\n\nHow to Watch the MCU In Release Order\n\nAs far as recommended viewing order goes, we suggest you watch the Marvel Cinematic Universe films and TV series in release order, which is the order we’ve listed below. Yes, we know release order isn’t technically chronological — Captain Marvel takes place in the nineties and is the first canonical appearance of Nick Fury, while Captain America: The First Avenger is set during Steve Rogers service in World War II. But if you want to catch up without jumping between TV episodes and films along the timeline, this is the way to do it.\n\nRelated\n\nWhich 20th Century Fox Marvel Movies Are Available on Disney+?\n\nEven before the studio was acquired in 2019, 20th Century Fox had a history of producing some popular Marvel films, including the X-Men franchise. Disney has recently brought many of their most popular titles to the streaming service, but don’t expect to see everything here.\n\nNOT CURRENTLY ON DISNEY+: Daredevil (2003), Elektra (2005), X-Men: First Class (2011). Again, you can find those movies on Amazon.\n\nWhat Live-Action Marvel TV Shows Are Currently on Disney+?\n\nMarvel Television was originally a separate division of Marvel Studios up until recently, and gave us shows like Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., starring Clark Gregg, reprising his role as Agent Phil Coulson from The Avengers. Exactly how “canon” Marvel Television-produced shows are is up for debate, most considering them not a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. However, all upcoming Marvel shows on Disney+ will be canon, as they are being lead by Kevin Feige and are developed exclusively by Marvel Studios. If you want to dip your toes into the wider “Marvel” canon, here are all the Marvel TV shows available on Disney+.\n\nWhich Marvel Animated Series and Movies Are Streaming on Disney+?\n\nIf you’re sick of CGI live-action fight sequences, or are just on a nostalgia kick for your favorite childhood superhero shows, Marvel has a surprisingly large list of their best animated shows streaming right now.\n\nNOT CURRENTLY ON DISNEY+: Marvel’s M.O.D.O.K. is the latest character from the pages of Marvel Comics to get their own animated series—if you want to watch that floating robotic engineered head, you can stream M.O.D.O.K. online on Hulu. But as mentioned previously, Disney+ does offer a bundle deal right now with Hulu and ESPN+, so you can get all three streamers for $13.99 a month.\n\nWhat Marvel Documentaries are on Disney+?\n\nIn addition to the MCU, Marvel has produced several documentaries and docu-series that showcase the history of the comic book giant, as well as behind-the-scenes footage from the creative teams behind multiple Marvel films. Here’s what’s on the streaming site right now.\n\nTrending\n\nWhat Upcoming MCU Shows and Films Will Be Streaming on Disney+?\n\nSeveral new spin-off series and films will be released to Disney+ in the upcoming months, so we’ve got the full list of what to expect (and what’s been announced so far), as well as when they’re all expected to drop on the platform. So grab some popcorn and strap in for another another year of twists and turns from the MCU’s newest additions."
