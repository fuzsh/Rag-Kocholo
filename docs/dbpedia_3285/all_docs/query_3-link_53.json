Anyway, despite it's screwy premisis, I don't think the producers where stupid enough to have it all end on a cliffhanger (after all, one of them was Micheal Reeves of Batman [and Gargoyles?] fame!). What I've never quite gathered is, what was supposed to happen in season 2? What happened to the synombtic (spelling?).\n\nWas he ever supposed to get back to MJ on earth?\n\nIve been interested in this myself. I know Spider-Man Unlimited wasnt very popular, but im still curious how it was supposed to end, or at the very least how they were gonna solve the cliffhanger. I once remember reading they actually did write up a script for the season 2 premier, does anybody know if it ever showed up on the internet?\n\nBlackoutCreature said:\n\nIve been interested in this myself.

Awesome. They really had something going for the series with the opening sequence of the pilot episode--until Spidey was thrown out of his element by sending him to Counter Earth. The writers would have made a wonderful sequel to Spidey:TAS."
