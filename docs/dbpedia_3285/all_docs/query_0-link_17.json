        "text": "The show was vastly overshadowed by the anime Pokémon, which began airing at the same time and garnered far higher ratings. The series had been doing well on its own, pulling in mid-to-high 3.0 ratings, airing against Pokemon. Despite only airing three episodes, the series was put on a two-month hiatus following \"Where Evil Nests\", where one month later it was announced that the series was being cancelled.\n\nRick Ungar, who had then recently been named president of the newly formed Marvel Character Group making him responsible for Marvel's television animation projects, stated that Fox needed to devote more time to shows that could compete with Pokemon.\n\nFox Kids had been in fourth place the previous year behind Kids' WB, Nickelodeon, and ABC but had managed to move back up to third. Fox kept shuffling the shows around the times, putting The Avengers: United They Stand in this show's slot, with the programming changing from week to week with only Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century, Digimon, and Beast Machines: Transformers maintained their timelots. Without a steady timeslot, audiences had a difficult time watching it week-to-week.\n\nBetween Marvel's bankruptcy problems, the comparatively low ratings, and fact that it fulfilled the thirteen-episode contract need the series was picked up for further episodes. Although the season one ended on a cliffhanger and several scripts were written for a second, no more came from the series.\n\n“What’s happening is Fox is dealing with the realities of Pokémon as a competitor,” Ungar stated while eating his breakfast. “They felt they needed to devote more time to those types of shows, which I understand. At the same time, you’ll notice that The Avengers came on last weekend.\n\n“What’s happening is Fox’s Saturday programming has been really fluid. It hasn’t been the same from week to week. The real problem is they have a ton of really good shows over there and they are trying to find the right formula to be competitive. I think they’re getting there from what I’m seeing.”\n\nAvengers In, Spider-Man Out--For Good?"
