        "text": "This page contains a list of cheats, codes, Easter eggs, tips, and other secrets for Spider-Man Unlimited for Windows Phone. If you've discovered a cheat you'd like to add to the page, or have a correction, please click EDIT and add it.\n\nSave Your Currency\n\nThere are a variety of ways to spend your currency, but most of them aren't efficient. Keep a tight grip on your currency, except when you have opportunities to buy additional suits. That way, you can send out your extra Spider-Man characters to work on your behalf when you're away from the game, plus you can enjoy their improved benefits when you keep playing yourself.\n\nSide Missions Are Your Friend\n\nAs you progress through the game, you'll find that missions are accessible only if your level is high enough. The easiest way to gain levels so that you can explore later stages is to complete side missions that appear on your map in blue. It's a great way to grab precious experience points. Don't forget that if you wear the standard suit, you'll also receive an additional 15% experience points, to make the process go even more quickly!\n\nPower-ups Are Just a Bonus\n\nPower-ups are nice, but you shouldn't make gathering them a priority when you're trying to survive. Often, a power-up will be positioned near a hazard, and you should weigh the benefits of grabbing that power-up (which will only help you for a few seconds) versus the risk. Don't plan your runs around the power-ups in a given area. Instead, grab only what you can conveniently snag.\n\nKnow Your Suits\n\nThere are numerous outfits available, and they grant benefits that will help you as you work through the game. Pay close attention to the suits and make sure you spend time leveling up the ones that appeal to you. Helpfully, the suit you start with grants a 15% boost to experience gained, so that should be one of the first you level up extensively."
