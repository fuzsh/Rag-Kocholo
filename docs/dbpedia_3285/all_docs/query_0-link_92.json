        "text": "When Stan Lee creations like Spider-Man and The Fantastic Four began taking the world by storm in the early '60s, it wasn't long before other forms of media came calling. Just like the production frenzy that followed the success of Superman in the comics, Spider-Man was a natural for other forms of media.\n\nIn 1967, Marvel and Krantz Films in New York contracted Gantray-Lawrence Animation in Canada to produce 52 episodes of a Spider-Man series that was to run on the ABC television network. Unfortunately, Gantray-Lawrence went bankrupt after producing the first 20 episodes so the remainder of the series' production was moved to Krantz's studios in New York under new producer, Ralph Bakshi.\n\nUsing a lot of elements from the early run of the comic book series, this series was a lot of people's introduction to the world of the wall crawling superhero. Some stories were almost complete re-tellings of Lee / Ditko stories while others were fairly standard Saturday morning kid-vid fare. The addition of a snazzy theme song didn't hurt, either. That song, more than anything else about the series, has remained an enduring element of the Spider-Man mythos ever since, with versions appearing in both theatrical films and even as a bonus track on a Ramones CD.\n\nWhen the first animated Spider-Man series left the air in 1970, Marvel had a number of other projects in the works, most of which ran into insurmountable problems long before they could be realized. This started a trend that fans of Marvel comics became all too familiar with, an uncanny knack for Marvel film & television projects to either be terrible or never make it to the production stage. Even so, Marvel managed to have some luck in the latter part of the '70s and, as always, their flagship character was in the forefront.\n\nOne of the places you had a chance to see Spidey on the television was during the classic PBS series, The Electric Company. From 1974 to 1977, Spider-Man appeared on the series in his own segment, Spidey Super Stories. Speaking only in voice balloons, this will probably be the only time you see Morgan Freeman and Spider-Man in the same scene. The segments were incredibly popular and spawned a comic version aimed at younger readers. Thanks to reruns, the Spidey Super Stories segments have helped introduce generations of young audiences to the character who might never be allowed to watch a regular animated series.\n\n1977 saw the broadcast of Marvel's first live action television series, The Amazing Spider-Man (another Marvel series, The Incredible Hulk, would follow the next season). While the series had some problems and looks pretty dated today, many of the elements present in the comics at the time made it into the scripts. Focusing more on Peter Parker's (Nicholas Hammond, best known for being one of the kids in The Sound of Music) work at the Daily Bugle than his college career, J. Jonah Jameson (Robert F. Simon) was a central figure in the series. Like most other Marvel-based television projects that followed, there wasn't a \"super villain\" to be seen.\n\nThe series just didn't click with viewers. The network blamed Star Wars and assumed that the audience wanted more science fiction, not superheroes and pulled the series after only 14 episodes were produced. If only they could have held on a little longer...\n\nOn December 15th, 1978, Warner Brothers released Superman to critical and financial success. Many producers who had taken a pass on comic book characters for years were suddenly desperate to get their hands on a superhero property. Any superhero property. Predictably, a Spider-Man project went into development with full page ads in the trade newspaper Variety touting the film for release in the near future. That film never saw production but an even more interesting Spider-Man project hit the airwaves, even though audiences in America were never supposed to see it.\n\nIn 1978, Marvel Comics and Japanese production giant Toei created a series for the Japanese market based on the wall crawler. A Japanese version of Spider-Man was attempted as a manga series in 1970 but the vigilante aspect of the series turned the young readers off. Learning from that misstep, Toei made this incarnation of Spider-Man a little less social outcast and a little more Ultraman.\n\nIn the Japanese version, a teenaged motorcyclist receives his spider powers from an alien while searching for his scientist father. The last survivor of Planet Spider, the alien warns of an impending invasion by the Iron Cross Group, a gang that looks a lot like every other set of villains in a Japanese superhero series (think Power Rangers if you need a point of reference). The alien's space ship, the Marveller (get it?) is also there to help the newly created Spider-Man in his fight against the invaders, along with some other super vehicles like the GP-7 super car and a giant spider robot called Leopardon.\n\nInterestingly enough, the basic Spidey costume is intact and the shots of Spider-Man crawling up buildings look far better than those used for the US television series. The series also had far better luck than its US counterpart. Toei's Spider-Man series ran 41 episodes and is considered a classic Japanese drama or dorama, as they're called in Japan. Unfortunately, the series has never been translated into English or released on DVD. One interesting side note: According to The Dorama Encyclopedia by Jonathan Clements and Motoko Tamamuro, Toei had also planned on a similar re-imagining of Marvel's Captain America but that idea eventually became the series Battlefever J. With the announcement of the upcoming re-imagining of Spider-Man in India on the way, can it be long before we see a Bollywood version of the webslinger?\n\nIt wasn't long before viewers in the US got to see Spidey on their screens again. In 1981, a new animated Spider-Man series was sold into syndication. This new series focused on Peter Parker's college years and showcased stories featuring long time Spider-Man foes such as Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin and many others. The first animated series from the newly-formed Marvel Productions, it would be one of only two Marvel characters actually animated by the studio (the other was the Incredible Hulk) over the 9 years the company existed.\n\nAs Marvel readied its new Spider-Man series for syndication, the NBC television network contacted the studio about a new Saturday morning series based on the character. NBC wanted a different kind of series that would appeal to a wider audience so Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends was born. Drawing on more of the Marvel universe than just the Spider-Man books, Amazing Friends featured not only Spider-Man but Iceman (one of the original X-Men) and a new heroine created specifically for the series, the flame haired Firestar, a character that looked a lot like Mary Jane Watson. Focusing on their exploits as super-heroes and very little on their personal lives, the series was also featured the first television appearance of the X-Men, the Avengers and a number of other Marvel heroes. It remained the definitive interpretation of Spider-Man for a decade.\n\nIn 1994, the FOX Kids Network launched the most ambitious Spider-Man animated series to date. Spider-Man included some of the most recent and popular villains from the comics, including the Hobgoblin, Carnage and Venom. A more adult series than any that came before it, FOX's Spider-Man had stories that interconnected in much the same way the comics do. Seasons 2, 3 and 4 featured season-long story arcs while season 5 included episodes based on Marvel's Secret Wars mini-series and the Spider-Man clone saga.\n\nIn 1999, after 5 seasons, the series was supposed to have been replaced by Spider-Man Unlimited, a bizarre take on the character that had Spidey battling Venom & Carnage on an alternate Earth that is ruled by the High Evolutionary. The series also featured an updated costume that featured nanotechnology and looked only a little like the classic costume. FOX balked at the series and it remained unaired in the US for years.\n\nIn 2002, the long awaited film version finally hit screens. Breaking box office records, Spider-Man finally proved the box office potential of the character. Sam Raimi's film brought new fans to the character and also a new animated series to run, of all places, on MTV (which is supposed to stand for Music TeleVision but hasn't focused on music for years). This new animated series was a departure from previous series in that it was completely computer generated. Voiced by actor Neil Patrick Harris, this incarnation of Spider-Man picked up where the film left off, following Peter Parker, Mary Jane Watson (voiced by Lisa Loeb) and Harry Osborn (voiced by Beverly Hills 90210 actor Ian Ziering) during their first year as students of Empire State University. The series kept most of the conventions of the universe established in the film and even included an episode with Stan Lee as the voice of a man who gives Spider-Man some advice.\n\nWith the release of the highly anticipated Spider-Man 2, there has been some talk of a second season but there hasn't been any confirmation of this. One thing is certain, with a third film guaranteed for 2007, we're certain to see even more Spider-Man."
