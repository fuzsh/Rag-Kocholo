        "text": "Deadpool & Wolverine brings the X-Men and MCU universes together in the biggest way yet, but you might be a bit confused as to where it exactly fits.\n\nLuckily, the movie makes it easy to place as after a flashback to March 2018 in Earth-616 (shortly after the events of Deadpool 2), the majority of the movie takes place six years later around March 2024 in Earth-10005.\n\nAccording to the official MCU timeline, that means Deadpool & Wolverine takes place around the events of Shang-Chi and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier in spring 2024.\n\nEven though Deadpool & Wolverine is an MCU movie, the previous two Deadpool movies and the X-Men movies aren't officially part of the MCU, so you'll need to check out our X-Men movies in order guide for those.\n\nIf you did want to rewatch the entire MCU ahead of Deadpool & Wolverine (good luck doing that at this stage), we're here to help with the definitive guide of how to watch the entire MCU in order, including movies, TV shows, TV specials and One-Shot shorts.\n\n(While we've got you, were you looking for Star Wars' timeline? We've got that covered. X-Men's movie order? Help yourself. What about DC Comics movies' chronological order? Easy peasy. All the Spider-Man movies? We've got them all caught up in a web.)\n\n(Oh, and if you're wondering why we haven't included Venom: Let There Be Carnage and Morbius it's because even though their credit scenes feature MCU crossovers, the movies themselves aren't MCU movies.)\n\nWhat is the correct order of the MCU?\n\nBefore you start on your MCU rewatch, you might be wondering if there's a 'correct order' to watch every movie and TV show released to date.\n\nIn short, there's not really a correct order and it's kind of up to you to decide the best way to tackle the MCU.\n\nThere are a couple of main ways to approach an MCU rewatch though if you want to have some sense of order.\n\nYou can either watch everything in the order they were released, or you can watch everything in chronological order which will require some jumping around the various Marvel Phases.\n\nHow to watch MCU in release order\n\nIf you want the easiest way to watch the entire MCU to date, then stick with the release order – although there are obviously still a lot of movies and TV shows to get through with this method.\n\nYou could slim down this list by not watching Agents of SHIELD or the Netflix shows as even though they are part of the MCU with recurring characters, it's now official that they're not part of the Sacred Timeline of the MCU. Instead, they take place in other timelines, but they're still canon.\n\n(Yes, we know that the likes of Charlie Cox and Vincent D'Onofrio are back as Daredevil and Kingpin, but just don't think about it too much.)\n\nThis all changed on the TV side from Phase 4 onwards as any show after WandaVision was very much part of the MCU, sometimes critical even to understanding what happened in the movies they were connected to.\n\nIn the following list, movies are in bold type, shorts are in italics and TV shows and one-off specials are neither.\n\n(We've left X-Men '97 off this list as it's not technically part of the MCU and is a continuation of the original '90s series instead. If you want to include it anyway, it ran from March-May 2024.)\n\n1. Iron Man (May 2008)\n\n2. The Incredible Hulk (June 2008)\n\n3. Iron Man 2 (April 2010)\n\n4. Thor (April 2011)\n\n5.

Deadpool & Wolverine (July 2024)\n\nMCU timeline: How to watch the MCU in chronological order\n\nThis is the ultimate watch order for MCU completists to watch events of the MCU play out in chronological order, but there are some rules we've had to impose to make it as straightforward as possible.\n\nIf something takes place in multiple time periods, such as Eternals, we've put it where the bulk of the movie or TV show takes place.\n\nAs for The Marvels, it picks up straight after the credit scene of Ms Marvel, but it's also definitely after Secret Invasion as Nick Fury is back up in space on SABER station which means that, chronologically speaking, The Marvels is the latest MCU outing.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine technically takes place before the majority of Phase 4 in March 2024, but given that the movie features gags about the Multiverse, you could also watch it after everything else as there's no real connection to wider MCU events.\n\nWe'd also suggest watching both seasons of Loki after Avengers: Endgame, not only because that's when 2012's Loki breaks off into his own timeline, but also because the events of the second season establish how the multiverse was created which is a major part of Phase 4 onwards.\n\nWhat If...? also exists in its own space and could technically be watched any time given that it involves multiple universes and timelines.\n\nThe same goes for the second season, so we've popped them next to each other on the chronological order, but you could really watch any of the episodes at any time during your marathon MCU watch.\n\nWe'd suggest watching What If...? after Loki though, as that's the show that introduces the multiverse to the MCU.\n\nAnd don't even get us started on Agents of SHIELD's final season, which mostly took place in an alternate timeline before eventually merging back with the main MCU timeline. For the sake of ease, watch it all after season six, and it'll make as much sense.\n\nX-Men '97 was confirmed to be its \"own thing\" by showrunner Beau DeMayo (who has since been let go by Marvel) so we've left it off the chronological order timeline as it doesn't cross over with the main MCU (at least, not yet).\n\nBut aside from that, it's generally pretty straightforward even when the multiverse comes into play.\n\nAs with the release order list, movies are in bold type, shorts are in italics and TV shows and one-off specials are neither.\n\n1.
