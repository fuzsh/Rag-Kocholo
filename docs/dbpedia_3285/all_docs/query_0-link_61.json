        "text": "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112175/trivia\n\nA sixth season was planned for \"Spider-Man\" which would have had Spider-Man find the real Mary Jane Watson from limbo with the help of Madame Web. Story editor John Semper said in an online interview that it purposefully left unresolved to see Spider-Man find the real Mary Jane because the crew thought they were going to get another season or two of \"Spider-Man\". However, Margaret Loesch, who was the president of Fox Kids network at that time, hated one of the show's executive producers, Avi Arad, and she wanted to put Arad out of business. When the sixty-five episode contract for \"Spider-Man\" was up, Loesch decided to cancel the show and had permanently shut down Marvel Films Animation, the company that provided the animation for Spider-Man.\n\nAvi Arad seems to be kind of a greedy weasel anyway. He for instance, forced Sam Raimi to shoe horn Venom into Spider-Man 3 (even though Raimi hated the character and had already planned on using Vulture instead). Naturally, the finished product was a crammed mess. Also, he apparently mandated that animated episodes had to be centered on one particular character in order to justify selling more toys (rather than if there's an interesting story to tell).\n\nI'm willing to give Loesch the benefit of the doubt since she was instrumental in finally getting an X-Men TV series on the air in the first place. Therefore, she isn't a Dawn Ostroff-type of TV executive, who hates anything that seems to be geared more towards boys.\n\nThis one I had never heard before.\n\nWasn't it around this time that Marvel cartoons were kind of going out?\n\nI mean after Spider-man ended we got only one season of Silver Surfer which had a planned second season that never went into production. There was also the 1990's Captain America animated series that never saw the light of day either that would've been awesome.\n\nAnd then we got those horrible Avengers and Spidey Unlimited shows.\n\nI think John Semper is the main reason 1990's Spider-man was as good as it was from the interviews.\n\nAvi Arad did a lot of good for Marvel in making movie and TV deals for Marvel that ultimately helped Marvel survive. However, I think the flaw is that Arad had a penchant for micro-managing the properties a little too much. Like I remember Semper for example was not allowed to use certain characters in the cartoon like Electro and Sandman because Cameron was trying to do them in his movie which never materialized. And then Semper did end up using Electro, but he had to do a totally new and different origin to put him in there. Semper also couldn't use Ghost Rider because Arad was determined to get a Ghost Rider animated series made. The Ghost Rider cameos in FF and the Hulk shows were like a backdoor pilot for an animated Ghost Rider show that never got made either."
