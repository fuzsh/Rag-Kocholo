        "text": "Although the series ended on a cliffhanger, an outline for the second season of 13 episodes was created and 6 scripts were produced, but never animated. Further episodes of the series would have taken Spidey on solo adventures after he helped the rebels end the war with the High Evolutionary to restore peace to Counter Earth and returned him to earth.\n\nThe series premiered on Fox Kids' lineup in October 1999. However, the show was airing in the same timeslot as Kids WB's Pokémon (1997) and was losing in the ratings. As a result, Roland Poindexter, Vice President of Programming for Fox Kids, began altering the programming lineup after realizing Kids WB had become a serious competitor in Saturday Morning Television and began altering the schedule in order to develop shows that could compete with Kids' WB's hit shows like Pokémon and Batman of the Future (1999). As a result, this series was pulled from Fox Kids after the third episode and was replaced with Die Rächer (1999). The show came back and re-premiered in December 2000 by re-airing the first three episodes that were aired back in 1999 and then continue the rest of the 13 episodes that Marvel and Saban produced."
