        "text": "The Spectacular Spider-Man\n\nDrawing inspiration from the Amazing Spider-Man comic run by Stan Lee, Steve Ditko and John Romita Sr., as well as as the Ultimate Spider-Man comics by Brian Michael Bendis and Mark Bagley, this 2008 series debuted on The CW’s kids programming block and in Season 2 moved to Disney XD. A total of 26 episodes were produced, with Josh Keaton voicing the title role.\n\nFrom where I sat (seat J-20!), this cameo seemed most prominent, with the camera dwelling on the character as he stepped forth from the Spider Society crowd that surrounded newcomer Miles.\n\nMISSING IN (LIVE-)ACTION: The Amazing Spider-Man\n\nPending a second viewing — or, most ideally, a pause-able rewatch when the film lands on Netflix — Across the Spider-Verse at first glance did not appear to include animated cameos from ABC’s Spider-Woman (circa 1979 and voiced by Joan Van Ark), Fox Kids’ Spider-Man: The Animated Series (circa mid-199os, voiced by Christopher Daniel Barnes), MTV’s Spider-Man: The New Animated Series (circa 2003, voiced by Neil Patrick Harris), or Disney XD’s Marvel’s Spider-Man (circa late-2010s, voiced by Robbie Daymond) — but feel free to chime in if you believe you spied any of said webslingers whilst at the Cineplex.\n\nBut perhaps most notably, the film’s live-action cameos appear to have snubbed CBS’ The Amazing Spider-Man, which debuted in September 1977 and ran for just 13 episodes, with American-Australian actor Nicholas Hammond in the title role.\n\nAnd this would not be the first time Hammond felt snubbed, having not been included, in any manner, in 2021’s Spider-Mans-filled Spider-Man: No Way Home.\n\n“It would have been a kick in the pants to have the old guy there,” Hammond told THR in November 2021. “I was really hoping I would be approached, but unfortunately that didn’t happen.”\n\nSimilarly, TV’s first live-action Spidey, seen as a reoccurring character on the PBS show The Electric Company, was a no-show on the big screen.\n\nWhat did you think of Across the Universe, and what was your favorite cameo?\n\nvar pd_tags = new Array;pd_tags[\"12360783-src\"]=\"poll-oembed-simple\";"
