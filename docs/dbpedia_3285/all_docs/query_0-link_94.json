        "text": "When Junior High Schooler Yu Komori is bitten by a radioactive spider, he is transformed into Japan’s own wall crawling sensation. Similar characters and tropes from the legend of Peter Parker defined the Spider Manga. Yu had a loving elderly Aunt and worked for a cantankerous newspaper publisher, plus, he fought such menaces as Electro, the Lizard, and the Kangaroo.\n\nread more – Spider-Man: Far From Home – Everything You Need to Know\n\nNow let’s get this straight, of all the great Spider-Man villains to choose from, the Japanese creators of manga Spidey go with the Kangaroo?\n\nLet’s just hope Mark Webb doesn’t follow that lineage of villains. He’s two-thirds there already! Manga Spidey is a fascinating alternate take on Spider-Man and is well worth seeking out, but really Japan, the Kangaroo?\n\nMC2 Peter and Spider-Girl\n\nFirst appearance: What If (Vol. 2) #105 (1998)\n\nCreated by Tom DeFalco, Ron Frenz\n\nIf old school is your thing, then MC2 Peter Parker and his daughter “Mayday” are the heroes for you. Essentially, the MC2 Universe was designed to be the next chapter in the saga of the Marvel Universe, stories that exist in a possible future.\n\nread more: Complete Upcoming Marvel Movie Schedule\n\nSpider-Girl saw a retired Peter Parker try to find a sense of non-super-hero normalcy after he lost his leg in the battle with the Green Goblin. After his daughter May develops spider powers, May and Peter are thrust back into a world of adventure.\n\nWriter Tom DeFalco and artist Ron Frenz fought low sales for almost a decade but kept plugging away at the Spider heroes of tomorrow. It’s a bit surprising that neither Disney nor Sony has tried to exploit this property It screams ‘tween sitcom.\n\nGerry Drew Spider-Man\n\nFirst appearance: Spider-Girl #32 (2001)\n\nCreated by Ron Frenz and Tom DeFalco\n\nAnother MC2 DeFlaco and Frenz creation, Gerry Drew was the son of the original Spider-Woman, Jessica Drew. A rare blood ailment was killing the poor Drew child but it also granted him strange powers. Gerry decided to spend his last days fighting crime and trained under Darkdevil (who was, y’know, Daredevil, but dark…oh, comics).\n\nread more – Complete Guide to Marvel Easter Eggs in Spider-Man: Homecoming\n\nGerry didn’t wear the webs for long, but he was a neat character study into the psyche of a dying young man. Happily, Reed Richards promised to find a cure for the boy. Usually, Reed keeps his promises of finding a cure unless he’s trying to cure someone covered in orange rocks, so things probably worked out well for young Gerry.\n\nI mean seriously Disney/Sony or whomever, this has CW or ABC Family drama written all over it. Why aren’t you on this? Victoria Justice as Spider-Girl…It writes itself!\n\nZombie Spider-Man\n\nFirst appearance: Ultimate Fantastic Four #22 (2005)\n\nCreated by Mark Millar and Greg Land\n\nSuperheroes are popular, and so are zombies. When Marvel mashed up their pantheon of heroes with flesh-devouring zombies, they discovered the two genres went great together.\n\nOn an alternate universe discovered by the Ultimate Fantastic Four, Marvel’s brightest paragons of justice had turned into lumbering flesh eaters. First Mark Millar and Greg Land, and then Mr. Zombie himself, Robert Kirkman, and artist Sean Phillips presented the dark world of Marvel Zombies, and by Odin’s dangling nether parts, was it disturbing.\n\nread more: The Craziest Venom Moments in Marvel History\n\nPeter Parker was a particularly twisted version of the classic character, as ‘ol Pete was just as ravenous a flesh eater as the other atrocities, except Peter, in true Peter fashion, was ravaged with guilt over once having devoured Aunt May and Mary Jane Watson. One can only guess what happened to Ms. Lion.\n\nAfter Kirkman, many other writers followed, fleshing (ha) out the twisted world of Marvel Zombies, and poor old guilt ravaged Peter was along for the ride, proving again and again with great power comes great hunger and the need to eat peoples’ faces and internal organs. Where’s Daryl Dixon when you need him?\n\nMan-Spider\n\nFirst appearance: Mutant X #6 (1999)\n\nCreated by Howard Mackie and Cary Nord\n\nIn the Mutant X universe, (it was a reality where the regular Marvel Universe Havok went for a bit, Storm was a vampire…It was the ‘90s, don’t ask questions). Spider-Man was a mutated hero with four arms that joined forces with the heroes of that reality. He was killed by the villainous Goblin Queen and replaced with a four armed clone who was also killed at some point.\n\nread more: The History of the Spider-Man and Deadpool Team\n\nIn the regular Marvel Universe, the real Spidey also had four arms for a brief period of time in a classic story by Stan Lee, Roy Thomas, and Gil Kane (Amazing Spider-Man #100-103), where he fought the Lizard and the freshly introduced Morbius. That story was awesome. Mutant X, not so much.\n\nPowerless Peter\n\nFirst Appearance: Powerless #1 (2004)\n\nCreated by Matt Cherniss, Peter Johnson, Alex Maleev, and Michael Gaydos\n\nOn the surface, Marvel’s 2004 mini-series Powerless doesn’t sound like the most gripping of sagas, but it was actually a surprisingly good read with insanely cool art.\n\nThe premise of the book is a world of super-heroes with no super powers. Most people just call that reality, but it remains one of Marvel’s best experimental series of the last decade.\n\nread more: The Many Characters Who Wore the Venom Symbiote\n\nIn this powerless world, Peter Parker uses the net handle Spider-Man and is still bitten by a radioactive spider. Instead of super powers, Powerless Pete has a nasty, atrophied arm. Of all the Peters in all the multiverse, this one got the short end of the stick. With shriveled nasty arm, comes absolutely no responsibility beyond weekly doctor’s appointments and massive doses of antibiotics.\n\nSpider-Man 1602\n\nFirst Appearance: Marvel 1602 #1 (2003)\n\nCreated by Neil Gaiman and Andy Kubert\n\nNeil Gaiman’s contribution to the Spider-Man mythos, Peter Parquagh appeared in the great 1602 mini-series. Parquagh was an apprentice to the royal spymaster Nicholas Fury. As Parquagh globetrots with his master, he is constantly coming close to being bitten by unusual spiders. This finally happens in one of the 1602 sequels not written by Neil Gaiman (it was Greg Pak), and Parquagh’s life as a colonial adventure begins in earnest. It’s all very cool and a bit streampunky, and listen, it’s all created by Gaiman, so just read it.\n\nSpider-Man 2099\n\nFirst Appearance: The Amazing Spider-Man #365 (1992)\n\nCreated by Peter David and Rick Leonardi\n\nEven in the far-flung future, power and responsibility are irrevocably linked. In the long running Spider-Man 2099 series by Peter David and Rick Leonardi, all the elements that make Peter Parker so special are packaged and shipped into the future, where a geneticist named Miguel O’Hara wields the webs. O’Hara is a hero cut from the same cloth as Peter: a victim of an experiment gone wrong, he uses his powers to help his really close to dystopian future.\n\nSpider-Man 2099 featured kickass world building by David. Using the world of Spider-Man and the Marvel Universe proper as a template, David built a fully functional future that was new enough to grip readers but different enough to provide for an alternate experience to regular Marvel continuity.\n\nread more – Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse Post Credits Scene Explained\n\nO’Hara is currently swinging around the present Marvel Universe and will soon be featured in his own title written by, because the comic gods are kind, Peter David.\n\nThe rest of the world learned of the awesomeness of O’Hara in the Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions video game, and it looks like Marvel would like nothing better than a 2099 resurgence.\n\nSpider-Man 2211\n\nFirst appearance: Spider-Man 2099 Meets Spider-Man #1 (1995)\n\nCreated by Created by Peter David and Mike Wieringo\n\nWhen Peter Parker met Miguel O’Hara, another era’s Spider-Man went along for the ride: the tragic Spider-Man of 2211, Max Borne. It appears this Spidey was “Borne” to suffer. (editor’s note: booooooooo!)\n\nWith the other Spider-Men, Borne had to fight his age’s Hobgoblin, who was actually his daughter driven completely bugnuts. This Hobgoblin was eventually killed by something called a retcon bomb, a weapon that would later be utilized by Dan Didio (oh, stop, we’re just kidding). If that wasn’t tragic enough, at story’s end, Borne is shot and killed by his era’s Chameleon, posing as Uncle Ben.\n\nread more: 10 Iconic Moments the Spider-Man Movies Missed\n\nWow, that’s one tragic Spidey. I’m shocked he didn’t Oedipaly kill Uncle Ben and marry Aunt May. Yeeesh. Spidey 2211 was designed by Mark Wieringo, so you know he’s visually awesomesauce.\n\nSpider-Man Noir\n\nFirst appearance: Spider-Man Noir #1 (2009)\n\nCreated by Created by David Hine and Carmine Di Giandomenico\n\nHis hands were stickier than a pick pocket at a taffy convention, he stuck to walls like dames stick to their make-up mirrors. And the way the creators of the Spider-Man: Noir mini weaved in noir elements while maintaining the super-hero integrity of the story was quite the narrative trick. Spider-Man: Noir remains one of the most successfully daring alternate versions of Spider-Man to date.\n\nread more: Complete Guide to Spider-Man Easter Eggs in the Venom Movie\n\nNow excuse me while I continue to practice my noir parlance: Miss Watson’s hair was so red it made blood insanely jealous, she had a body that made a priest want to break a stained glass window…\n\nThis version of Spidey also appeared in the Shattered Dimensions video game.\n\nSpider-Man: India\n\nFirst Appearance: Spider-Man: India #1 (2004)\n\nCreated by created by Sharad Devarajan, Suresh Seetharaman, and Jeevan J. Kan\n\nPavitr Prabhakar became the Spider-Man of India in a book published in India and reprinted in the U.S. It’s actually pretty cool how the legend of Spider-Man really does translate well into very distinct cultures. It shows the universality of Peter. At least our creative friends in India had the good taste to not include the Kangaroo in their book.\n\nSeriously, Japan, what’s up with that?\n\nSpider-Man Unlimited\n\nOriginal Run: 1999 -2001\n\nCreated by Michael Reaves and Will Meugniot\n\nBatman Beyond was a pretty big hit back in 1999, so that same year, the fine folks at Marvel Animation created their own alternate take on Spider-Man. After the successful Spider-Man cartoon of the ‘90s, Marvel took Spidey and shunted him off to an alternate Earth where he had a new costume and met up with such characters as the High Evolutionary and Bestial versions of some Marvel’s most famous characters.\n\nread more: Why the 1970s Spider-Man TV Series Deserves an Official Release\n\nWhile an animated High Evolutionary should have given fans multiple nerdgasms, the haphazard animation and non-traditional take on Spidey and his world just made fans turn the channel. No Daily Bugle, No Aunt May, no M.J., no great rogue’s gallery, no thanks. Even Venom and Carnage as the recurring baddies couldn’t save this show.\n\nThis taught Marvel one great lesson: unless you have the talents of Paul Dini and Bruce Timm on your show, stick with tradition. Some cool characters did show up on the series like X-51 and bestial versions of Electro and the Green Goblin, which makes this one worth revisiting for curiosity’s sake.\n\nMarvel also published a short-lived comic that tied into the show, featuring a Bestial Wolverine, so haunt those quarter boxes if you’re really that curious.\n\nMac Gargan\n\nFirst appearance: as Mac Gargan — The Amazing Spider-Man #19 (1964)/as Spider-Man — Dark Avengers #1 (2009)\n\nCreated by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko\n\nAs Mac Gargan, he was one of Spidey’s greatest foes, and when Eddie Brock gave up the symbiote, Gargan became the new Venom, but for a time, Gargan also took the identity of Spider-Man.\n\nWhen Norman Osborn formed his own team of Dark Avengers to mock the heroic foes he despised so much, it would only be appropriate that Osborn made one of his twisted Avengers Spider-Man. Enter Mac Gargan, wielder of the Venom symbiote, and the most evil Spider-Man to date.\n\nread more: Venom Post-Credits Scenes Explained\n\nGargan turned the sacred profane by giving into his baser cannibalistic instincts while calling himself Spider-Man. With his psycho teammates, like Bullseye as Hawkeye and Moonstone as Ms. Marvel, Gargan’s Spider-Man cut a bloody swathe across the Marvel Universe.\n\nAi Apaec\n\nFirst appearance: Osborn #1 (2011)\n\nCreated by Kelly Sue DeConnick and Jamie McKelvie\n\nAfter the fall of the first team of Dark Avengers, Osborn tried again, and he still get a kick out of pooping on Spider-Man’s name. Osborn’s second Spidey was a South American Spider God transformed into a six armed version of Spider-Man.\n\nread more – What Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man 4 Would Have Been Like\n\nAi Apaec was dispatched when he was shrunk down by the Avengers and squished by USAgent. A fitting end for a disgusting monstrosity, that’ll learn ya to masquerade as our hero, you six armed freak. *\n\n* Den of Geek would like to apologize to any followers of ancient archaic South American proto-religions that worship spider monsters.\n\nSpider Doppelganger\n\nFirst appearance: The Infinity War #1 (1992)\n\nCreated by Jim Starlin, Ron Lim, and Al Milgrom\n\nSpeaking of disgustingly horrific, multi-limbed versions of Spidey, we have this thing.\n\nThe Spider-Doppelganger was created by the villainous Magus, himself a clone of Adam Warlock, and was really the only monster clone that stuck around the MU after Infinity War. Spider Doppelganger (holy crap, is that a pain in the ass to type) had all the powers of Spider-Man, but looked like Steve Ditko’s worst LSD nightmare.\n\nread more: Every Version of Marvel’s Infinity Gauntlet Story\n\nDoppie played a huge role in the ultra-popular, not as good as most people seem to remember, “Maximum Carnage” mega-event, where he became sort of a weird pet to Cletus Kasady. It should be noted that Doppie’s Toy Biz figure produced in 1996 completely ruled.\n\nBlood Spider\n\nFirst appearance: Amazing Spider-Man #367 (1992)\n\nCreated by David Michelinie and Jerry Bingham\n\nBlood Spider was an evil version of Spider-Man hired by the Red Skull and trained by Taskmaster. You know when your origin involves two guys with skulls for heads, you’re an evil S.O.B. Blood Spider was last seen trying to kill Venom. It didn’t go well. Blood Spider teamed up with evil versions of Hawkeye and Captain America named Jagged Bow and Death Shield because the ’90s.\n\nWeb Man\n\nFirst Appearance: Spidey Super Stories #25 (1977)\n\nCreated by Jim Salicrup, Nicola Cuti, Bill Mantlo, and Win Mortime\n\nBefore the Scarlet Spider, before the “Clone Saga,” there was Web Man, a villainous clone who wore an awesome inverse of the classic Spider costume. Web Man’s only appearance was in the Electric Company’s Spidey Super Stories comics for young readers.\n\nread more: Spider-Man 2000 is the Most Underrated Superhero Game\n\nWeb Man was created by Dr. Doom. How many one-off villains produced for an educational comic can say that? Say what you will, Web Man’s one story was more clean, concise, and entertaining than any part of the “Clone Saga.” So take a bow Web Man, you may be all but forgotten, but you got the clone thing right. Seriously though, that is a really cool costume. But yeah, Dr. Doom must have spent two whole seconds coming up with that name.\n\nWhat do you want from a villain who thought Doombot was clever?\n\nTurkish Spider-Man (1973)\n\nOK, brace yourself now. 3 Giant Men (AKA: Captain America and Santo vs. Spider-Man; Turkish: 3 Dev Adam) features an evil Spider-Man taking on a Turkish Captain America and Mexican Wrestler El Santo.\n\nNo, I haven’t gotten into Grant Morrison’s stash. This is real:\n\nSo how does a Mexican wrestler team-up with a Turkish version of the living embodiment of America to take on an evil version of a famous super-hero? Who the heck knows, but in this nightmarish thing posing as a movie, Spider-Man uses guinea pigs as weapons and survives certain death multiple times.\n\nThere seem to be four different evil Spider-Men that survive Captain America and El Santo. In one scene, Spider-Man kills a nice young couple in cold blood and then steals a statue…I have no idea why.\n\nread more: The Jessica Jones and Spider-Man Connection\n\nThe whole emo dance sequence in Spider-Man 3 doesn’t seem so bad now, does it? God, would I love to have been in the writers’ room for this one.\n\n“No, no, clearly this movie needs a Mexican wrestler!”\n\n“Yeah, in America, he is a hero, but in our film, statue-stealing thrill killer. That will rake in the liras!”\n\nMiles Morales\n\nFirst appearance: Ultimate Fallout #4 (2011)\n\nCreated by Brian Michael Bendis and Sara Pichelli\n\nWhen Marvel killed off the Ultimate version of Peter Parker — seemingly for good — fans thought the House of Ideas must have lost their ever loving minds. Then they met Miles Morales, and most fans who gave the young new hero a chance, fell in love.\n\nMiles came to the MU with his own supporting cast, his own set of problems and motivations, and most importantly, Peter Parker himself plays the Uncle Ben role to Miles. So by extension, Uncle Ben’s universal lesson of power and responsibility extends to Miles through Peter, and that’s pretty cool.\n\nread more – Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse – Who is Miles Morales?\n\nMiles continues his adventures, filling the late Peter’s shoes so nicely in the pages of Ultimate Spider-Man. Miles is more than just a flash in the pan, a place holder till Peter comes back, he is a true legacy character, and an everyman that lives the legend of Spider-Man. After the events of Secret Wars, Miles and many of his supporting cast have been shunted into the Marvel Universe proper and has taken his proper place as part of the mainstream Marvel pantheon of heroes. His diverse background makes him one of the most important new characters of the 21st Century.\n\nElectric Company Spider-Man (1974-1975)\n\nMany fans, who are now in their forties, were first exposed to Spider-Man through the educational public access show, The Electric Company.\n\nThe Electric Company’s Spidey appeared in shorts during the fourth and fifth season of the show, and saw the Wall Crawler communicate through word balloons designed to help the young viewers learn sight words. Not a bad idea actually. Many of these shorts were narrated by Morgan Freeman, which is 78 kinds of awesome.\n\nread more: The Amazing Background Music of the 1967 Spider-Man Cartoon\n\nOver the course of 2 seasons worth of shorts, educational Spidey took on such menaces as the Fox, Silly Willy, the Sandman (not the cool Sandman, but some dude that dresses as Wee Willy Winkle), the Yeti, the Bookworm, and the Sack (Stop that now!). The Electric Company Spidey suit was actually pretty cool, and the whole thing still has a wonderfully wholesome nostalgic feel, as the shorts remain a vital part of many fans’ Spidey evolution.\n\nAttention Dan Slott and Brian Michael Bendis, we dare you to revive Silly Willy or the Sack. We dare you.\n\nJapanese TV Spider-Man (1978)\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, wow! So this exists:\n\nIn 1978, Marvel and the Toei Company signed a character exchange agreement where each company could use the others’ properties in their respective countries. This led to the Shogun Warriors comic in America and a Tomb of Dracula animated film in Japan.\n\nNot to mention this gem.\n\nThe Japanese Spider-Man stuck pretty close to Marvel’s version except for the fact that Japanese Spidey was a motorcycle racer named Takuya Yamashiro who found a UFO and was given super powers. He also used a giant mech named Leopardon. You know, exactly like Lee and Ditko envisioned. By the way, the name of the UFO was the Marveler and it was from the planet Spider.\n\nread more: How Masters of the Universe 2 and a Spider-Man Movie Became Cyborg\n\nThis Spider-Man goes up against the Iron Cross Army, led by Professor Monster and the Amazoness, who use giant monsters called Bems to attack Spidey. Spidey frequently uses the Leopardon to defeat the Bems. I love this sentence.\n\nBy the way, one episode featured a song called “Spider-Man Boogie” (which is seriously the best thing ever). Thank you for this, Asia. Seriously. Thank you.\n\nBen Reilly\n\nFirst appearance: The Amazing Spider-Man #149 (1975)\n\nCreated by Gerry Conway and Ross Andru\n\nIt all started out innocently enough. DC had great success with alternate version of Batman and Superman, and Marvel wanted in on the fun, so they brought back the Jackal-created Spider Clone that first appeared and was destroyed in The Amazing Spider-Man #149 by Gerry Conway and Ross Andru.\n\nDubbed Ben Reilly, the Spider Clone actually lived, dyed his hair blond, and had lived a life away from Peter. Now Ben was back, and Spider-Man had to deal with the fact that there was another version of him running around.\n\nread more: Venom Comics Reading Order\n\nBen soon donned the Scarlet Spider costume, and other than an inexplicable hoodie, it was all pretty cool. That is, until Marvel revealed that Ben was the REAL Peter and Peter was the clone, basically telling fans the last 20 years of Spidey stories had starred the wrong Spidey. It was all a not so clever way to get rid of Spidey’s marriage to Mary Jane, but it didn’t work at all, as fans rejected the idea that their Spidey was the false Spidey. Instead of cutting their losses, Marvel decided to keep the story running for two whole years, and introducing more and more clones till the whole thing got more convoluted than six DC reboots.\n\nWant to know how it ends?\n\nSpoiler: Marvel lost 100,000 readers. The end.\n\nBen did spend a long time as Spider-Man in his own distinct costume, and even participated in the Marvel and DC crossover, defeating Superboy. Ben could have been a pretty cool character, as Marvel would prove later with the second Scarlet Spider, but poor Ben remains a symbol of ’90s excess, a marketing idea gone horribly, horribly wrong.\n\nOr does he? Because after the events of The Clone Conspiracy, Ben Reilly has returned. At first a misguided villain, Reilly is trying to redeem himself by becoming a hero once again. Once one of the most reviled concepts in the Marvel Universe, Ben Reilly is now starring in a vastly entertaining book written by the legendary Peter David. So not so fast Spider-Fans, there might be some greatness in this once hated character.\n\nSpider-Boy\n\nFirst appearance: Marvel Versus DC #3 (1996)\n\nCreated by Karl Kesel and Mike Wieringo\n\nThe Amalgam Universe was a mash-up universe where Marvel and DC’s biggest stars were joined together like brightly clad, heroic Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups. Characters like Dark Claw (Wolverine and Batman) and Super Soldier (Captain America and Superman) fascinated fans in two separate months of crossover events.\n\nThe only issue with Spider-Boy was, and I say this with all due respect to Superboy, that the modern Superboy was just not as iconic as Spider-Man, so fans kind of just raised an eyebrow at this oddity.\n\nread more: The 100 Best Marvel What-If? Moments\n\nAt the time, Spider-Man was a clone, as was Superboy, so you can see why the powers that be thought this sort of thing was clever. But it was all just a mish mash of stuff from Spider-Man and Superboy mythos.\n\nSpider-Boy was created by Project: Cadmus and raised by Thunderbolt Ross (wait that’s a Hulk character…You know what, just go with it). The mash-up hero could walk on walls and had a web pistol. He also took the identity Pete Ross (traditionally Superboy’s BFF), so there really wasn’t much Spider-Man about him at all.\n\nOh well, Spider-Boy had a terrific creative team, so he had that going for him. Web pistol?\n\nKaine\n\nFirst appearance: As Kaine — Web of Spider-Man #119 (1994)/As Scarlet Spider — Scarlet Spider #1 (2012)\n\nCreated by Terry Kavanagh and Steven Butler\n\nAh, Kaine, good old Kaine, who in recent years proved that the wholeclone thing could work if done right. Originally, Kaine was a rejected Spider-Clone who went bad. He became a major thorn in the side of Ben Reilly and Peter Parker, and served as an anti-hero/straight up villain throughout the ponderous “Clone Saga.”\n\nIn recent years, Kaine returned, and because he is engrained with Peter Parker’s sense of responsibility, reluctantly became the Houston, Texas-based vigilante, the new Scarlet Spider. Kaine’s solo book rocked and showed the story potential of a Spider-Clone that didn’t actively piss on two decades of continuity.\n\nKaine is currently running with a brand-spanking-new team of New Warriors, another great book worthy of any Spider-Fan’s attention.\n\nSpidercide\n\nFirst appearance: The Spectacular Spider-Man #222 (1995)\n\nCreated by Tom DeFalco and Sal Buscema\n\nSpidercide was the most monstrous clone of Peter Parker, who had all of Spidey’s powers but could also grow and shrink and grow blades from his body. If an alien race observed Earth through mid-90s Marvel, they would believe that every human could grow blades from their body. So thank you mid-90s Marvel for stemming off an invasion of Earth.\n\nOh yeah, Spidercide sucked.\n\nPeter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham\n\nFirst appearance: Marvel Tails #1 (1983)\n\nCreated by Tom DeFalco and Mark Armstrong\n\nWow, for good or for ill, Tom DeFalco sure created a ton of Spider-Man derivatives, but none cooler than Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham.\n\nLong before Homer Simpson sang “Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig,” Peter Porker was doing the arachnapig thing with gusto. Peter was once a spider that was bitten by May Porker and was transformed into a pig-spider hybrid.\n\nread more: Everything You Need to Know About Spider-Ham\n\nPeter Porker teamed with Captain Americat and the Goose Rider, and the fact that something called the Goose Rider exists should fill everyone with a blissful warmth.\n\nWho doesn’t love Peter Porker?\n\nLet us not forget Magsquito and Iron Mouse, or Ducktor Doom and Deerdevil. The whole thing is just pure gold, so thank you, Mr. DeFalco, Peter Porker more than makes up for Spidercide.\n\nScarlet Spiders\n\nFirst appearance: Avengers: The Initiative #3 (2007)\n\nCreated by Dan Slott and Stefano Caselli\n\nThe Scarlet Spiders were three mysterious men who donned the Tony Stark’s red and gold Spider Armor and served in the Avengers Initiative team. What’s cool about this trio is that Dan Slott created them before he became the writer on Amazing Spider-Man. This was during a time where Peter Parker revealed his identity to the world during the Marvel Civil War.\n\nThe Scarlet Spiders lied and said that Peter used to be one of them, raising doubts in the public that Peter was really the true Spider-Man, providing Marvel an out during the whole public identity era of Spider-Man.\n\nSlott never got to use this particular subplot because Mephisto and One More Day happened, but the Scarlet Spiders remains a fascinating curiosity in the Spider-Man mythos and pretty cool characters in their own right. Ironically, the Spiders also turned out to be clones, but not of Peter, but of the little known hero named MVP.\n\nSteel Spider\n\nFirst appearance: As Ollie Osnick — The Spectacular Spider-Man #72 (Nov 1982)/As Spider-Kid — Amazing Spider-Man #263/As Steel Spider — Spider-Man Unlimited #5\n\nCreated by Bill Mantlo and Ed Hannigan\n\nOllie Osnick was once an overweight but brilliant kid who idolized Dr. Octopus. Ollie went on a crime spree after he buildt his own Ock arms. When Spider-man stops Ollie, the shy lad begins idolizing Spidey and becomes the Spider-Kid.\n\nAs Ollie gets older, and loses some weight, he becomes the Steel Spider. The Steel Spider’s greatest claim to fame is having one of his real arms eaten by the Mac Gargan Venom.\n\nThe MC2 version of the Steel Spider doesn’t have such a tragic fate, as Ollie joins the Avengers in that universe. Ollie also once joined up with the Toad and Frog Man to form the Misfits, and Marvel should get right on giving that trio their own comic.\n\nDead Spider-Man\n\nFirst appearance Edge of the Spider-Verse #2 (2014)\n\nCreated by Jason Latour and Robbi Rodriguez\n\nNo, not vampire or zombie dead, for real dead. So Spider-Gwen has become quite the thing, huh? In an alternate universe, it is Gwen Stacy who gains the proportionate strength and powers of a spider and Peter Parker who takes a dirt nap, inspiring Gwen to use her powers to help others.\n\nAfter Gwen received her powers, she began fighting crime as Spider-Woman. Peter Parker was inspired by this new hero and injected himself with a serum that transformed him into this reality’s Lizard. This ended up with Peter dead and Gwen broken hearted but inspired to make sure this kind of tragedy never happens again. So in the Gwen-verse, Peter never became Spider-Man, ended up becoming the Lizard, and is now six feet under because who besides Curt Conners thinks it’s a good idea to just inject lizard DNA into one’s arm?\n\nOh well, this dead Peter was a dope…but an inspirational dope because he pointed Spider-Gwen in the right heroic direction after he lizard died.\n\nSpider-Man UK\n\nFirst appearance: Edge of the Spider-Verse #2 (2014)\n\nCreated by Jason Latour and Robbi Rodriguez\n\nWilliam Braddock is exactly like Peter Parker, except Braddock is British, a member of the Captain Britain Corps, blond, a punk rocker, and did we mention he’s British? Spider-Man UK (who’s British) was introduced in the Spider Verse saga and eventually joined the Web Warriors. As we mentioned, he is also a Captain Britain so that’s like being Spider-Man and Captain America all mashed together…except for the nationality thing. There was no Brexit with Braddock as he loyally serves with his fellow Spidey’s in the Web Warriors.\n\nSo there you have it. All the Spider-Mans! Spider-Men? Spider-Mens? Remember, no matter the country, planet, or reality – with great power comes great responsibility. Except in Turkey, evidently."
