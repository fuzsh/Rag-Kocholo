The court jailed Sydney hairdresser Warren Fellows, 27, Wil'liam Sinclair, 67-year-old Bangkok bar owner, and Thai Kitti Imsap to 33 years and eight months each. Sydney football player Paul Hayward, 27, was sentenced to 28 years. The three Austr~.lians, arrested in October 1978 and held in cus.tody since then, pleaded not guilty to attempted trafficking. But Hayward and Fellows pleaded guilty to illegal posses- sion of the heroin which the prosecution said was found in their hotel room. The Thai, who was accused of supplying the drug, also pleaded not guilty. Defence lawyers said the Australians would appeal against the judgment. In a lengthy judgment, the court said it could have imposed life imprisonment but had passed lighter sentences because the defendants had been cooperative during the trial. It said the prosecution had estab lished clear evidence that Fellows and Sinclair were involved in drug trafficking for seve~. or eight years. Hayward was given a lighter term because there was no evidence that he was involved in drug trafficking prior to 1978, the court said. It said the sentences took into consideration the large amount of hemin involved. Dealing in such qua.ntities of drugs was a threat to the world community, it added. The court also noted prosecution evidence that about 30 kilogrammes (50 pound~) of drugs were being smuggled into Australia every month.

[Text~ Every other Swedish voter is prepared to approve concealed microphones and telephone tapping without authorization in order to cut down on drug abuse and to uncover tax violations. This was shown by an opinion poll taken by the Institute for Opinion Analysis during the spring of 1981. The institute has conducted opinion polls based on checking off a form containing around 500 questions in 1979, 1980 and 1981. This is the first year narcotics appeared in the questionnaire. Nine out of ten Swedes favor strong steps against narcotics and eight out of ten voters favored measures to combat tax violations and foreign deb.ts. Asked if hidden microphones should be placed in residences to uncover drug deal- ings and tax cheating, 30 percent answered, \"Yes, definitely\" and 23 percent said, \"Yes,\" for a total of 53 percent. Unauthorized telephone tapping was approved by 29 percent in the top category and 31 percent in the next for a total of 60 per- cent. TV surveillance without special authorization was accepted by a'total of 53 percent. Pessimism is widespread when it comes to getting at narcotics, with 36 percent thinking the situation will get \"much worse\" in a few years and another 27 per- cent feeling it wi11 get \"somewhat worse.\" At the same time as demands for taking action against tax cheating are rising, tolerance for tax eheating is increasing. 6578 CSO: 5300/2423 23 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400050009-3 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2407102/09: CIA-RDP82-40850R000400050009-3 ~ ~ SWEDEN ~ BRIEFS HEROIN SMUGGLER SEIZED--Helsingborg (TT)--A routine check paid off.
