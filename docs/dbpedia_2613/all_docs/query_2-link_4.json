In addition to being a short story writer, a dramatist and playwright, Ms. Cataluna is probably best known to the general public for her thrice weekly column for The Honolulu Advertiser.\n\nBorn on Maui and raised in plantation houses in Wailuku, Koloa and Ka’u, she is keiki o ka aina ha’aheo (“proud child of the land”) who matriculated at Baldwin High School before graduating magna cum laude from the University of the Pacific in Stockton California in 1988, majoring in Psychology and Dance. In 1999, the University named her a Distinguished Young Alumna of the University.\n\nFollowing a notable 10 year career in local television and radio, Ms. Cataluna became a columnist for The Honolulu Advertiser in 2000. Her column covers all aspects of modern life, from altruism to political commentary, from real biography to “Sonny” from Kapolei. Her writing is disciplined and coherent, purposeful and coordinated and is marked by common sense and clear analysis with an underlying sympathy and a wry, satiric yet mature humor.\n\nMs. Cataluna brings these same qualities to her dramatic writing. She has studied playwriting with Victoria Nalani Kneubuhl, Y York and at the David Henry Hwang Playwriting Institute at the East West Players in Los Angeles. She is a 2004 winner of the Cades Award for Literature for her body of work. Her favorite stories, both fiction and non-fiction, are about ordinary people struggling to live lives of dignity and purpose.\n\nUlua: The Musical (Kumu Kahua, 1999)\n\nWith book and lyrics by Lee Cataluna and music by Sean T.

Customers and employees alike take turns onstage discussing everything from product purchases to boyfriends and girlfriends, abusive spouses and mortal enemies. Some two dozen characters, including Verna (\"Waipahu's answer to Martha Stewart\"), Rhondalei Alvarado, Rogelio \"D.J. Stankmaster\" Cabingabang, Crazy Aunt Cookie, Officer Wolverton Kahaunaele and Uncle Choochie Nawai, tend inadvertently to reveal their own personalities while discussing the character flaws of others—all against the backdrop of Hawaii's preferred shopping destination. As character Cheryl Moana Marie Sakata says, “This is my whole life. This is the rest of my life. Zippys, Foodland, Longs.”\n\nDa Maya (Kumu Kahua, 1998)\n\nWhen Da Mayah debuted at Kumu in 1998, it broke box office records, drew rave reviews and inaugurated for playwright Lee Cataluna the creation of what would become a string of hit comedies. Now Da Mayah is back in all its wacky hilarity. The newly-elected mayor of Hilo, Lester Perez (campaign slogan: \"Do What He Sez!\"), is not too bright, but his administrative assistant, second in command and mistress Sandralene Leialoha Ferreira, manages fairly successfully to keep him from making a complete fool of himself. When Lester is blackmailed by a childhood friend, Derek Pang, Sandy enlists the aid of her gangster cousin Dukie and his hit man Stanton, who has \"a rap sheet thicker than the Bible\" and a crush on Sandy. The action takes us from the mayor's office to Jazzmin’s Karaoke Bar and Washerette (\"Karaoke solo $1.50, duet $4.00\"), bringing to play assassination attempts, betrayals and bad plate lunches.\n\nThe Great Kaua‘i Train Robbery (Kumu Kahua, 2010)\n\nKaua‘i, 1920: At a time when plantations used railways to transport workers’ pay, the stage was set for one of Hawai‘i’s most unusual robberies.

Exploding the images of the islands as a \"simple care-free coconut and palm tree playground,\" these voices cry out their concern for Hawai'i's future. Exploring cultural exploitation, racial prejudice, economic crises and fights over native lands, these characters search for the true Hawai'i.

For almost a thousand years, until outlawed in 1911, it was the fashion for women to bind their female children's feet to deliberately deform their growth. The most desirable \"lotus feet\" fit into \"lotus shoes\" -- only three to four inches long. In China Doll, foot-binding becomes an all too obvious symbol for the forces of hierarchy, patriarchy and tradition that constrain all people of Imperial China, but most particularly women.\n\nThe Madness of the Square (Theatre Direct Canada for The Democracy Project, ?)\n\nThis play tells the tale of one young engineering student present during the upheaval in Tiananmen Square, 1989.

Instead, he hides the truth as he introduces Sally to Mom and Dad in the hopes that they will like her. Fears turn into fantasies as the real time scenes are interwoven with scenes from the Yellow Claw, a satire on the racist movie series about a Chinese overlord trying to invade the west. The play skewers Asian stereotypes and examines the trials and tribulations of inter-racial romances. In the end, Mark must choose between his family and Sally.\n\n- Sterling Award for Best New Play\n\n- A.C.T.

As the lecture progresses, the audiences suspects Crowley might actually be the killer himself. But before they can act, members of the audience are shuffled throughout the lecture hall so that they sit beside strangers. Crowley presents his final proof, an inkblot that the audience must scrutinize for a full minute. The lights are turned off and the negative image of the inkblot forms the face of the killer. However, in the blackout, the true killer makes his presence known and proceeds to eviscerate Crowley, leaving the audience's imaginations to create the picture to go along with the sounds and sensations in the dark. This play is a psychological experiment about the nature of fear, imagination, and deification of serial killers.\n\n- Sterling Nom for Best New Fringe Play\n\n- Sterling Nom for Best Actor in Fringe Play\n\n- Sterling Nom for Best Fringe Play\n\n- Sterling Nom for Best Fringe Director\n\nCast requirements: 3 male, 1 female\n\n7th Circle (Fringe Theatre Adventures, 2001)\n\nThe Forbidden Phoenix (2005?)\n\nAn allegory for the early Chinese immigrants to Canada, this myth tells the story of the Monkey King's journey west. Looking for food for his people, this classic Chinese Opera character faces discrimination in a prosperous land run by a lonely ruler who only wants to bring the Iron Dragon to his kingdom.
