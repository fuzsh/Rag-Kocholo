The National Office of Clinical Audit (NOCA) provides operational support and governance for the IHFD. All 16 eligible hospitals in the Republic of Ireland are now entering data. It is clinically supported by the Irish Gerontological Society (IGS) and the Irish Institute of Trauma and Orthopaedics (IITOS). The IHFD has been recording data since 2012 and has captured over 29,000 cases to date.\n\nIn 2017 the IHFD published the Irish Hip Fracture Standards (IHFS), in 2018 these standards formed the basis of a Best Practice Tariff (BPT) i.e a payment of €1000 per case that meets the IHFS. In 2021 a new standard for early mobilization was added.\n\nData is collected through the Hospital In-Patient Enquiry (HIPE) portal in collaboration with the Healthcare Pricing Office (HPO).\n\nThe amount of data captured has improved consistently year on year with 99% coverage achieved in 2020. There has been an improvement in all IHFS between 2017-2020 with a minor disimprovement in 2020 due to COVID. The focus of the audit going forward will be support the hospitals to recover from the impact of the COVID pandemic, to increase the number of patients care meeting the BPT, to support the hospitals to adopt a culture of quality improvement using the IHFD data and to develop a longer term outcome dataset. Several high quality research publications were published in 2021. (2021 data will be ready in Sept 2022).\n\nP02: Handgrip Strength and Modified Functional Ambulation Classification Cut-off Points to Identify Post-operative Walker in Fragility Hip Fracture\n\nIvan Long YinAu 1 , Shirley Ka Wai Lee 1 , Tim King Him Chui 2 , Kwok Leung Tiu 2 , Kin Bong Lee 2 , and Andy Chi Ming Chan 1\n\n1 Physiotherapy Department, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong, 2 Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong\n\nThe objectives of this study were to investigate the relationship between pre-operative physiotherapy outcomes and early post-operative functional outcomes, (ii) to estimate the cutoff point of pre-operative handgrip strength (HGS) and premorbid Modified Functional Ambulation Classification (MFAC) to identify post-operative walker in fragility hip fracture (FHF) patients.\n\nPatients who admitted to a local acute hospital in 2020 and entered the Fragility Hip Fracture Clinical Pathway were reviewed. Pre-operative HGS, MFAC-premorbid, MFAC at discharge (MFAC-DC) and Elderly Mobility Scale (EMS) at discharge (EMS-DC) were retrieved. Correlations among pre-operative HGS, MFAC-premorbid, MFAC-DC and EMS-DC were evaluated by Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to estimate pre-operative HGS and MFAC-premorbid cut-off points for the prediction of post-operative walker (i.e. MFAC ≥III or EMS ≥6).\n\nFour hundred and thirty-two patients (mean age=84.7 ± 7.3 years old) (144 males, 288 females) were reviewed. Significant positive correlations were found between HGS and MFAC-DC (r = 0.379, p < 0.001), and between HGS and EMS-DC (r = 0.314, p < 0.001). Significant positive correlations were demonstrated between MFAC-premorbid and MFAC-DC (r = 0.403, p < 0.001), and between MFAC-premorbid and EMS-DC (r = 0.428, p < 0.001).\n\nFor predicting post-operative walker of MFAC ≥III, HGS cut-off points in male and female patients were 17.1 kilogram-force (sensitivity 65.7%; specificity 56.0%) (AUC=0.647, p = 0.009) and 12.4 kilogram-force (sensitivity 71.6%; specificity 55.1%) (AUC=0.650, p < 0.001) respectively. MFAC-premorbid cut-off point in male patients was Category VII (sensitivity 77.1%, specificity 56.9%) (AUC=0.716, p < 0.001).\n\nPre-operative physiotherapy outcomes, including HGS and premorbid MFAC, can help to determine the early post-operative functional outcomes and facilitate the discharge planning in FHF patients.\n\nP03: Boosting Inpatient Exercise After Hip Fracture Using an Alternative Workforce: A Mixed Methods Implementation Evaluation (BOOST Study)\n\nMarie March 1 , Sarah Dennis 2 , Sarah Caruana 3 , Chris Mahony 4 , Jim Elliott 5 , Stephanie Polley 6 , Bijoy Thomas 3 , Charlie Lin 4 , and Alison Harmer 7\n\n1 Western Sydney Local Health District and University of Sydney, 2 University of Sydney and South Western Sydney Local Health District, 3 Western Sydney Local Health District, 4 Northern Sydney Local Health District, 5 University of Sydney and Northern Sydney Local Health District, 6 Western Sydney Local Health District and Northern Sydney Local Health District, 7 University of Sydney\n\nAims: Our objective was to evaluate the safety, fidelity, acceptability, and effectiveness of implementing thrice-daily exercise by an alternative workforce for patients in the acute setting after hip fracture. Methods: We conducted a pre-post mixed methods implementation evaluation. We included ambulant, community dwelling participants who were prescribed at least 50% weight-bearing after operative fixation for hip fracture. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was used as a determinant framework to guide implementation planning. Our intervention combined once-daily mobility training implemented by a physiotherapist, with added twice-daily sit-to-stand exercise implemented by the alternative workforce. Our primary outcome was effectiveness, measured by acute hospital hospital length of stay. Primary outcome data was analysed using T-tests, with a reference cohort from registry data. Results: 25 participants were recruited from 26 eligible patients at two hospitals over 10 weeks. Our reference cohort and BOOST cohort were similar at baseline. Acute hospital length of stay was 3 days less in the BOOST cohort compared to the reference cohort (mean 8.2 vs 11.5, mean difference -3.27, 95%CI -5.39 to -1.16, P = 0.003). No safety concerns were identified related to the BOOST intervention. We had 72% fidelity to planned occasions of service across both sites. The intervention was acceptable to patients and carers, staff and the orthogeriatric team, with the main barrier to implementation identified as patient cognition. Conclusion: Thrice-daily exercise intervention is safe, effective, acceptable and feasible for patients in the acute stage after hip fracture when implemented by a supervised alternative workforce.\n\nP04: Bone Structure Using Peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (pQCT)-Based Finite Element Modelling in Young Adults Born Extremely Preterm or Extremely Low Birthweight (EP/ELBW) In 1991 and 1992\n\nThang Dao 1 , Dale Robinson 2 , Lex Doyle 3 , Peter Lee 2 , Joy Olsen 4 , Ashwini Kale 5 , Jeanie Cheong 6 , and John Wark 5\n\n1 Melbourne Medical School, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia, 2 Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia, 3 Clinical Sciences, Murdoch Children’s Research Institute, Melbourne, Australia; Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia; Newborn Research, Royal Women’s Hospital, Melbourne, Australia; Department of Paediatrics, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia, 4 Clinical Sciences, Murdoch Children’s Research Institute, Melbourne, Australia, 5 Department of Medicine, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia; Bone and Mineral Medicine, Department of Diabetes and Endocrinology, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Australia, 6 Clinical Sciences, Murdoch Children’s Research Institute, Melbourne, Australia; Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia; Newborn Research, Royal Women’s Hospital, Melbourne, Australia\n\nAims: The long-term bone health of young adults born extremely preterm (EP; <28 weeks’ gestation) or extremely low birth weight (ELBW; <1000g birth weight) in the post-surfactant era (since early 1990s) is unclear. This study investigated their bone structure and estimated bone strength using pQCT-based finite element modelling (pQCT-FEM). Methods: VICS is a longitudinal cohort study of EP/ELBW survivors and controls born in Victoria, Australia, during 1991-92. At age 25 years, participants underwent pQCT at 4% and 66% of the tibia length which was analysed using pQCT-FEM, and groups compared using linear regression, adjusting for height and weight. Parameters measured included compressive stiffness (kcomp), shear stiffness (kshear), torsional stiffness (ktorsion), and bending stiffness (kbend). Results: Comparing 161 EP/ELBW survivors (46.0% male) and 122 controls (44.3% male), the EP/ELBW survivors were shorter than the controls while their weights were similar. Several height- and weight-adjusted parameters were lower in the EP/ELBW group compared with controls (mean difference [95% confidence interval] for ktorsion: -128.2 (-241.4, -14.9) and kbend: -194.2 (-359.2, -29.1) at 4% tibia, and ktorsion at 66% tibia: -178.9 (-351.2, -6.5)). Separated by sex, ktorsion and kbend at the 4% tibia site and all parameters at 66% tibia were lower (p < 0.01 – p < 0.001) in EP/ELBW males compared with controls, but not in females. Conclusions: Height- and weight-adjusted pQCT-FEM measures associated with bone fragility were lower in EP/ELBW than control individuals. These differences were more apparent in males than females, suggesting an important increase in long-term fracture risk in individuals born EP/ELBW, particularly males.\n\nP05: Who, If Anyone, May Benefit From a Total Hip Arthroplasty After a Displaced Femoral Neck Fracture? A Post Hoc Subgroup Analysis of the Health Trial\n\nFrede Frihagen, Marianne Comeau-Gauthier 1 , Daniel Axelrod 1 , Sofia Bzovsky 1 , Rudolf W. Poolman 2 , Diane Heels-Ansdell 3 , Mohit Bhandari 4 , Sheila Sprague 4 , and Emil H. Schemitsch 5\n\n1 Division of Orthopaedics, Department of Surgery, McMaster University, 2 Department of Orthopedic Surgery, OLVG, Amsterdam and LUMC, 3 Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact, McMaster University, 4 Division of Orthopaedics, Department of Surgery, McMaster University; 2. Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact, McMaster University, 5 Department of Surgery, University of Western Ontario\n\nAims: Arthroplasty is the recommended treatment for displaced femoral neck fractures (FNF) in the elderly. Most patients receive a hemiarthroplasty (HA), but some advocate a total hip arthroplasty (THA), especially for the healthiest patients. The Hip Fracture Evaluation with Alternatives of Total Hip Arthroplasty vs. Hemiarthroplasty (HEALTH) trial reported no difference in revision surgeries and no important clinical differences between patients receiving HA and THA. We performed a post hoc exploratory analysis of a fitter cohort of patients from the HEALTH trial. Methods: Participants were above 50 years of age and had sustained a low-energy displaced FNF. The fittest participant cohort was defined as participants 70 years or younger, classified as ASA I or II, independent walkers, and lived at home prior to fracture. Multi-level models were used to separately estimate the effect of THA versus HA on Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, Short Form-12, European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions, and Timed Up and Go-test scores. In addition, a sensitivity analysis selecting patients with the same clinical criteria, but aged 80 years or younger. Results: There was 143 patients included in the fittest subgroup. Mean age was 66 (SD 4.5) years and 103 (72%) patients were female. No clinically relevant differences were found between the treatment groups in the primary analysis, nor in the sensitivity analysis (n = 328). Conclusions: We found no difference in functional outcomes between HA and THA up to two years in a subgroup analysis of the fittest patients enrolled in the HEALTH trial.\n\nP06: Association Between Additional Weekend Rehabilitation and In-hospital Mortality in Patients with Hip Fracture: A Propensity-Score Matching Analysis in a Nationwide Japanese Database\n\nTakahisa Ogawa, Tetsuya Jinno, Yoshiyuki Suehara, Takep Fujiwara, Toshitaka Yoshii and Atsushi Okawa\n\nBackground: Rehabilitation after hip fracture surgery is essential to improve physical function. Previous studies reported additional weekend rehabilitation on weekend or after hours could be associated with physical function and length of hospital stay. However, the association between additional weekend rehabilitation and mortality remains unknown. Methods: We investigated the association between patients after hip fracture surgery who received rehabilitation on weekends and in-hospital mortality and complications using a nationwide multicenter database from 2013 to 2018 with a propensity-score matching analysis. We estimated the association between weekend rehabilitation and outcomes with Cox regression or logistic regression models among the matched cohort. Results: Among matched pair of 259,168 cases, patient who received weekend rehabilitation was significantly associated with lower in-hospital mortality compared to those who did not receive weekend rehabilitation (hazard ratio, HR [95% confidence interval, CI]: 0.84 [0.8 - 0.89], P < 0.001). Systemic complications such as coronary heart disease, heart failure, renal failure was significantly lower in the weekend rehabilitation group (odds ratio, OR [95% confidence interval, CI]: 0.89 [0.83 - 0.95], 0.93 [0.86 – 0.99], 0.88 [0.78 – 1.00]), whereas urinary tract infection and surgical complications such as surgical site infection or hematoma were significantly higher in the weekend rehabilitation group (OR[95% CI], 1.12 [1.07 – 1.18], 1.21 [1.12 – 1.30], respectively). Conclusion: Weekend rehabilitation was significantly associated with a lower in-hospital mortality, but special attention should be paid to surgical complications. Although medical cost was higher by applying weekend rehabilitations, it may contribute a medical cost reduction though reduced complication.\n\nP07: The Role of Mentoring and Peer Support in Development of World-Class Fracture Liaison Services\n\nChristine Gill 1 , Denise MacKenzie 1 , Kirsten Malpas 2 , Paul Mitchell 3 , and Kim Fergusson 4\n\n1 Osteoporosis NZ, 2 Accident Compensation Corporation, 3 University of Notre Dame Australia, 4 Fracture Liaison Network of NZ (FLNNZ)\n\nAims: To support universal access to IOF-accredited Fracture Liaison Services (FLS) in New Zealand (NZ) by mid-2024. Methods: Osteoporosis New Zealand and the Accident Compensation Corporation are leading a national FLS quality improvement (QI) programme, which includes:\n\nA scoping survey to determine FLS status and resources\n\nClinical Standards for FLS with clear Key Performance Indicators\n\nANZ Fragility Fracture Registry to enable benchmarking against the Clinical Standards\n\nWorkshops to introduce the Clinical Standards and the Registry, and seek FLS Teams’ input to shape both to optimise FLS service delivery\n\nA highly experienced, previous FLS Nurse Specialist provides mentorship to support local QI efforts from FLS inception through to IOF Gold Star accreditation. Peer Support for FLS is provided by the Fracture Liaison Network of NZ (FLNNZ). The FLNNZ Chair role has been formalised to deliver an ongoing professional development programme for both FLS Coordinators and Clinical Leads. Results: Upon commencement of this programme in November 2020, six FLS in NZ had IOF accreditation, of which two were Gold. As of May 2022, nine NZ FLS are on the IOF Map serving 58% of the population, of which four are Gold. Two further IOF applications are pending. Ongoing mentorship and peer support is on track to ensure that all current 20 District Health Board regions will have IOF-accredited FLS by June 2024. Conclusions: A national QI programme with dedicated leadership, mentoring and support is an enabler to work towards universal access to IOF-accredited FLS. This approach could be applied in other countries.\n\nP08: Educational Initiatives to Support Caregivers with Fragility Fractures\n\nMaria Eduarda Batista de Lima, Stefano Eleuteri, and Paolo Falaschi\n\nCaregivers’ mental health is an important predictor of patients' institutionalization and a risk factor for their mortality. Caregiver burden and its associated stress negatively affect caregivers' perceived general physical and mental health and have been negatively correlated with the functional status of older adults’ family members after discharge following hip fracture (HF) surgery. Literature shows that interventions improving educational and social support for caregivers of older adults were found to effectively increase caregivers’ confidence, coping ability and outcomes.\n\nThe “Educational Web Course for Caregivers of Patients with Fragility Fractures” was born with the aim to improve the quality of life and care of the fractured patient and their caregivers, providing the opportunity for cares around the world to access it for free. The course was structured in 13 animated and interactive modules and the contents address both theoretical-practical aspects of home management of a patient who has sustained a HF and emotional-psychological aspects, important for a better caregiver-patient relationship and for reducing stress.\n\nThe initial phase of the project’s global dissemination will involve its implementation in the UK, Italy and China, supported by the central Coordination Team of the FFN EduCom and by the FFN RegCom through the national FFNs who will translate and adapt the content locally, considering the anthropological differences of the care processes in these countries.\n\nThis initiative is reaching a global audience of caregivers, particularly those in remote and underdeveloped areas and will improve fragility fracture care globally, disseminating the FFN vision, mission and goals worldwide.\n\nP09: The Incidence of Post-Operative Acute Kidney Injury In Trauma and Orthopaedics Patients Across An NHS Trust: A Quality Improvement Project\n\nThomas Richardson 1 , SanatKulkarni 1 , Sreenadh Gella 1 , and Syeda Naqvi 1\n\n1 Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust\n\nIntroduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common post-operative complication and has been show to significantly increase risk of other post-operative complications, morbidity and mortality. This quality improvement project (QIP) aimed to evaluate and implement measures to decrease the incidence of AKI in post-operative Trauma and Orthopaedics (T&O) patients. Methods: Three data collection cycles were conducted using all T&O patients admitted to a single NHS trust across three six-month periods between December 2018 and December 2020 (n = 8215). Patients developing a post-operative AKI were identified using the Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria. Data was collected for these patients including demographic details and AKI risk factors such as ASA grade, hypovolaemia and use of nephrotoxic medications. Results: The percentage of post-operative AKI decreased from 2.0% (71 patients from 5899 operations) in the first cycles to 1.5% (19 from 1273 operations) by the final cycle. We identified a high prevalence of modifiable risk factors for AKI, including post-operative hypovolaemia (50%) and use of nephrotoxic aminoglycosides (81%). Measures implemented between cycles included a pre-operative medication review identifying nephrotoxic medications, early post-operative assessment for consideration of intravenous fluids and junior doctor teaching on fluid therapy. There was a substantial decrease in use of multiple nephrotoxic medications (98% to 59%) and in use of aminoglycosides (88% to 42%) between the final cycles which may explain the reduction in observed AKI incidence. Conclusion: This QIP highlights the benefits of a multifaceted approach in the peri-operative period, through targeting of risk factors in preventing post-operative AKI.\n\nP10: A Comparison of Complication Rates Between Early and Delayed Surgery among Filipino Patients with Fragility Fractures of the Hip\n\nAbigail Tud 1 and Rafael Claudio 2\n\n1 The Medical City, Pasig Philippine Orthopedic Center Taipei Veterans General Hospital, 2 The Medical City, Pasig\n\nObjectives: Existing standards of care recommend operative management for fragility fractures of the hip. Early intervention has been associated with lower incidence of morbidity and mortality, however a lack of consensus remains in the Philippines regarding timing of surgery. We sought to determine the effects of surgical timing on in-hospital complications among Filipino patients with fragility hip fractures. Methods: All patients admitted for fragility hip fractures in a single tertiary-care facility from 2014-2016 were analyzed retrospectively. Subjects treated within 72 hours were grouped under “early intervention”, while those managed beyond were designated “delayed intervention”. Primary outcomes were complications during admission, while secondary outcome was length of hospital stay. Ninety-six patients met our inclusion criteria, of which 41 (42.71%) underwent early intervention. Results: A significantly lower incidence of pressure ulcers (2.4% for ≤72 hours vs 45.5%; P = <0.0001), pneumonia (7.32% vs 47.27%; P = <0.0001) and urinary tract infection (4.88% vs 40%; P = <0.0001), as well as shorter hospital stay (mean: 8.85 days ± 5.4 vs 14.6 days ± 13.3; P = 0.01) were seen in the early intervention group. More cases of documented deep vein thrombosis were recorded in the delayed intervention group (83.3% versus 16.6%), as was the only case of in-hospital mortality. Conclusion: Early intervention showed a significantly lower incidence of in-hospital complications among patients with fragility fractures of the hip, suggesting that surgery within 72 hours may lead to better outcomes by helping to reduce the incidence of pressure sores, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection among Filipinos with hip fractures, while reducing length of admission\n\nP11: Quality of Life and Depression Status of Caregivers of Fragility Hip Fracture Patients During One Year After Hip Fracture Treatment\n\nChirathit Anusitviwat 1 , Pattamaket Sukchokpanich 2 , Atthakorn Jarusriwanna 3 , Nitchanant Kitcharanant 4 , and AasisUnnanuntana 2\n\n1 Department of Orthopedics, Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University, Songkhla, Thailand, 2 Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand, 3 Department of Orthopaedics, Faculty of Medicine, Naresuan University, Phitsanulok, Thailand, 4 Department of Orthopaedic, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang mai University, Chiang mai, Thailand\n\nAims: It is important to be concerned about caregivers’ well-being during the hip fracture care. This study aimed to evaluate the quality of life and depressive status of caregivers for 1 year after a hip fracture treatment. Methods: We prospectively enrolled primary caregivers of hip fracture patients between April 2019 and January 2020. The quality of life of caregivers was evaluated using the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36), the EuroQol 5D-5L (EQ-5D-5L), and the EuroQol visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS). The depressive status was assessed using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD). All outcome measures were collected during admission as baseline data, at 3-months, 6-months, and 1-year post-hip fracture treatment. Results: A total of 50 caregivers were included in the final analysis. Both mean SF-36 physical and mental component scores decreased significantly during the first 3-months post-treatment, respectively. The physical and mental component scores returned to their baseline value at 12-months and 6-months post-treatment, respectively. The mean EQ-5D-5L and EQ-VAS scores declined significantly at 3 months and returned to their baseline values within 12 months. As for HRSD, there were 56% and 36% of caregivers expressed mild depressive symptoms at 3- and 6-month post-treatment, consecutively. Conclusions: Since quality of life and depressive status of caregivers may affect functional recovery of hip fracture patients, these caregivers should be regarded as hidden patients that need to be integrated into the hip fracture treatment pathway. The specific attention and support should be given to all caregivers, particularly during the first 3-month post-treatment.\n\nP12: Effectiveness of an Osteoporosis Refracture Programme – A Tale of Two Country Cities\n\nPeter Wong 1 , Tracy Ho 2 , Aedan Roberts 2 , Sandy Fraser 3 , Julia Thompson 4 , Jennifer Williamson 2 , and Liz Hay 5\n\n1 Department of Rheumatology, Westmead Hospital, 2 Economics and Analysis Unit, Strategic Reform and Planning Branch, NSW Ministry of Health, St Leonards, New South Wales, 3 Coffs Harbour Health Campus, Mid-North Coast Local Health District, 4 Musculoskeletal Network Care Across the Lifecycle and Society, Agency for Clinical Innovation, 5 Ministry of Health NSW\n\nAim: To determine effect of an Osteoporosis Refracture Programme (ORP) on refractures rates. Methods: An ORP was established in Coffs Harbour (CH; Australian Standard Geographical Classification, ASGC—Remoteness Areas Classification, RA2—Inner Regional, pop. 70 000) on the mid-north coast of NSW, in July 2012. Port Macquarie (PM; ASGC RA2, pop. 50 000) is located 2 hours south in the same region, but only had an ORP established in Feb 2019. Linked administrative data were used to calculate annual refracture rates in those aged ≥ 50 years from financial years (FY) 2012/13 to 2018/19 for CH and PM. Projections from FY2018/19 were made using ‘business-as-usual’ (BAU) modelling. Results: The observed total annual number of refractures for CH in FY2018/19 was 188 compared to 218 assuming BAU – a 13.8% reduction. The observed annual number of refractures in CH was consistently lower than BAU for every year following ORP implementation in 2012. In contrast, in PM, which lacked an ORP, the observed annual number of refractures in FY2018/19 was 139 compared to 138 assuming BAU. The observed annual number of refractures in PM was consistently above BAU for every year between FY2012/13 and FY2018/19. Cumulative adjusted refractures rates for CH were as follows: 1-year 8%, 2-years 15%, 3-years 21%, 4-years 28%, 5 years 32%. Corresponding adjusted NSW refractures rates (%) were 7, 12, 17, 21 and 25. Conclusion: An ORP is associated with reduction in refractures rates. However, these are higher on the mid-north coast of NSW compared to statewide data.\n\nP13: Short-Term Outcomes of Patients with Fragility Hip Fractures Infected with SARS-CoV-2 Managed in a COVID-19 Referral Hospital with an Orthogeriatric Team in a Developing Country\n\nKiko Cortez 1 and IrewinTabu 1\n\n1 Department of Orthopedics, Philippine General Hospital, University of the Philippines Manila\n\nAims: Hip fractures in the elderly population is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity, with a huge economic impact to the healthcare system. Perioperative presence of COVID-19 infection in patients with acute fragility hip fracture complicates the decision making process in the management of these patients. This study aims to investigate the outcomes of patients with acute fragility hip fractures with coexisting COVID-19 infection who underwent surgery. Methods: In this ambispective study, the patient database of a university hospital designated as a COVID-19 referral center with an orthogeriatric team was reviewed to determine the mortality and morbidity rates, and short-term functional outcomes of patients with coexisting COVID-19 and acute fragility hip fracture who underwent surgery. Results: A total of 17 patients were admitted with preoperative COVID-19 infection and acute fragility hip fracture – 10 of which had surgery. Mean injury-to-admission and admission-to-surgery intervals were 7.0 and 4.6 days, respectively. Joint replacement procedures were done in all patients with a mean operative time of 162.9 minutes and an average blood loss of 395 mL. Thirty-day mortality and morbidity rates were 10% and 30%, respectively. Mean EuroQoL overall health score at short-term follow-up was 81.4. Conclusion: A multidisciplinary orthogeriatric team approach should be employed to expedite timely surgical intervention prior to the development of secondary complications and clinical deterioration, as well as to achieve the best outcomes in patients with coexisting asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 infection and acute fragility hip fracture.\n\nP14: Delirium in Acute Hip Fracture - Prevent it and Save Lives!\n\nSameer Maini 1 and Marie Lid 1\n\n1 Aalesund Hospital\n\nAim: Hip fracture is associated with increased mortality. We conducted a retrospective study of patients in our orthogeriatric unit with the focus on short and long term mortality in various patient groups. The aim of the study was to identify easily identifiable factors and their effect on prognosis. Methods: We analysed data from our orthogeriatric unit from May 2020 til May 2021. Results: 217 patients; 67% female; mean age 83. 50% admitted from home, 50% mobilised independently, 30% known dementia. 60% operated within 24 hours, 45% developed delirium and average length of stay 5.8 days. 30 day mortality 6.5%, 90 day 12.0% and 1 year 20.7%.\n\nFactors associated with increased 30 day and 1 year mortality are mobility (independent 5.6% and 12,2% versus non-independent 8.4% and 30.3%), age (<85 years 3.7% and 12.1% versus >85 10.0% and 30.9%), dementia (no dementia 3.2% and 13.9% versus dementia 16.9% and 42.4%), delirium (no delirium 0.8% and 8.9% versus delirium 14% and 36.6%).\n\nCombining delirium with other factors also had an effect on 30 day and 1 year mortality; (<85 without delirium 0% and 4.0% versus <85 with delirium 12.5% and 31.3%) (no dementia without delirium 3.6% and 8.2% versus no dementia with delirium 6.3% and 27.1%). Conclusion: Many risk factors that increase mortality are non-modifiable, but our data shows that developing delirium on top of these risk factors has a significant effect on prognosis. Focus on reducing delirium can have the biggest impact on improving outcome after a hip fracture.\n\nP15: Patient-Reported Outcome Measures After Hip Fracture in Patients with Chronic Cognitive Impairment, Results From 34,675 Patients in the Norwegian Hip Fracture Register\n\nMalfrid Kristoffersen 1 , Eva Dybvik 1 , Ole Martin Steihaug 2 , Torbjorn Kristensen 2 , Lars Birger Engesaeter 1 , Anette Hylen Ranhoff 3 , and Jan-Erik Gjertsen 4\n\n1 Norwegian Hip Fracture Register, 2 Haukeland University Hospital, 3 University in Bergen, 4 Haukeland university hospital, Bergen, Norway\n\nAim: Hip fracture patients have high morbidity and mortality. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) assess the quality of care of patients with hip fracture, including those with chronic cognitive impairment (CCI). Our aim was to compare PROMs from hip fracture patients with and without CCI, using the Norwegian Hip Fracture Register (NHFR). Method: PROM questionnaires at four months (n = 34,675) and 12 months (n = 24,510) after a hip fracture reported from 2005 to 2018 were analyzed. Pre-injury score was reported in the four-month questionnaire. The questionnaires included the EuroQol five-dimension three-level (EQ-5D-3L) questionnaire, and information about who completed the questionnaire. Results: Of the 34,675 included patients, 5,643 (16%) had CCI. Patients with CCI were older (85 years vs 81 years) (P < 0.001), and had a higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification compared to patients without CCI. CCI was unrelated to fracture type and treatment method. EQ-5D index scores were lower in patients with CCI after four months (0.37 vs 0.60; P < 0.001) and 12 months (0.39 vs 0.64; P < 0.001). Patients with CCI had lower scores for all dimensions of the EQ-5D-3L pre-fracture and at four and 12 months. Conclusion: Patients with CCI reported lower health-related quality of life pre-fracture, at four and 12 months after the hip fracture. PROM data from hip fracture patients with CCI are valuable in the assessment of treatment. Patients with CCI should be included in future studies.\n\nP16: Does a Standardized Treatment Course Affect Mortality in Hip Fracture Patients? Data From the Norwegian Hip Fracture Register\n\nTuva Elisabeth Garre-Fivelsdal 1 , Jan-ErikGjertsen 2 , Eva Dybvik 3 , and Marit Stordal Bakken 4\n\n1 Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway, 2 Haukeland university hospital, Bergen, Norway, 3 Norwegian Hip Fracture Register, 4 National Centre for Emergency Primary Health Care, NORCE, Bergen, Norway Department of Clinical Sciences, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway\n\nAims: We aimed to study the prevalence of good quality standardized treatment course for hip fracture patients in Norwegian hospitals and if the standardization affected 30d mortality after hip fracture surgery. Methods: Based on the Norwegian national guidelines for interdisciplinary treatment of hip fractures, nine criteria for standardized treatment were identified. In 2020, a questionnaire was sent to the Norwegian Hip Fracture Register’s (NHFR) contacts at all Norwegian hospitals performing hip fracture surgery, mapping adherence to these criteria. Fulfilling 8 or 9 of the criteria was defined as having a standardized treatment course of good enough quality. Using data from the NHFR, 30d mortality was compared for patients operated in hospitals with or without standardized treatment of good quality. Hazard Rate Ratios (HRRs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated with Cox regression adjusted for sex, age, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class. Results: Twenty-nine (67%) of 43 hospitals returned the questionnaire. Twenty of these (69 %) had a standardized treatment course of good quality. Mortality after 30 days in 2016-2020 was significantly lower in these hospitals compared with hospitals without standardized treatment course of good quality [HRR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.04-1.23; P = 0.005]. Conclusions: Two thirds of the responding hospitals met the definition of good quality treatment course for hip fracture patients. Mortality after 30 days was significantly lower in hip fracture patients treated in these hospitals as compared to patients treated in hospitals without standardized treatment of good quality.\n\nP17: An 11-Year Longitudinal Analysis of Refracture Rates and Public Hospital Service Utilisation in Australia’s Most Populous State\n\nJennifer Williamson 1 , Peter Wong 2 , Christopher Needs 3 , Julia Thompson 4 , and LizHay 5\n\n1 Economics and Analysis Unit, Strategic Reform and Planning Branch, NSW Ministry of Health, St Leonards, New South Wales, 2 Department of Rheumatology, Westmead Hospital, 3 Department of Rheumatology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown, NSW, Australia, 4 Musculoskeletal Network Care Across the Lifecycle and Society, Agency for Clinical Innovation, 5 Ministry of Health NSW\n\nAim: Value based healthcare (VBHC) in NSW is a strategic priority involving a systemwide and evidence-based approach aimed at improving experiences of receiving and providing care, outcomes, effectiveness and efficiency. A key VBHC initiative centres around Osteoporotic Refracture Prevention (ORP). With the overall aim of further supporting the scaling, implementation, and evaluation of the state-wide ORP model of care, this analysis calculated current and projected refracture rates, public hospital utilisation and costs in NSW. Methods: Linked public health administrative data were used to calculate annual refracture rates and refracture-related service utilisation and costs between 2007 and 2019. Projections for the next decade were made using ‘business-as-usual’ modelling. Results: Between 2007 and 2018, 388,743 people aged ≥50 years experienced an index fracture and 81,601 had a refracture. Refracture was more common in older people, women with a major index fracture or minimal trauma index fracture and those with an osteoporosis diagnosis. Refractures increased from 8774 in 2008 to 14,323 in 2018. The annual cost of refracture to NSW Health increased from AU$130 million in 2009 to AU$194 million in 2019. Projections over the next decade show that if nothing changes, 862,537 refracture-related hospital and outpatient attendances will occur at an estimated total cost to NSW Health of AU$2.4 billion. Conclusion: This analysis provides a picture of refractures and associated projected service utilisation and costs over the next decade in NSW; providing a foundation for evaluation of a state-wide ORP model of care to prevent refractures in people aged ≥ 50 years.\n\nP18: Minimizing Blood Loss & Morbidity In Periarticular Hip Surgeries\n\nPradyumna Majumdar 1 , Rakesh Gupta 1 , and Mayukh Mukherjee 1\n\n1 PGIMS, Rohtak, India\n\nIntroduction: Periarticular hip surgeries involve extensive exposure of raw bleeding surfaces during dissection and the possibility of topical Tranexamic acid (TXA) to act is higher, at the same time it has a chance to get absorbed into systemic circulation reducing its concentration locally, unlike knee surgeries where topical TXA remains in high concentration due to capsular envelope and less raw surface causing low systemic absorption. Aim: To study if TXA, can reduce blood loss and thus morbidity in hip fragility fracture surgeries. Methods: Pre-operative oral TXA and intra-operative topical TXA through drain and pre-operative calcium tablets and intra-operative NS were given respectively to Groups A & B (50 pts each) (mean 68 yrs). Age, gender, BMI, pre-op haemoglobin and diagnosis were comparable in both groups. Results: The most common diagnosis was fracture inter-trochanter (54%). Post-operative drain output was 205 ml and 412 ml in groups A and B respectively (P < 0.001). The post-operative haemoglobin was 11.2 g/dl in group A and 10.7 g/dl in group B (P < 0.01). The percentage fall of haemoglobin was 7.5% in group A and 13.7% in group B (P < 0.001). Total blood loss was 324 ml in group A and 594 ml in group B (P < 0.001). No drug-related complications were seen in any of the patients. Conclusion: From the observation of the present study, pre-operative oral and intra-operative topical administration of TXA in patients undergoing periarticular hip surgery appears to be an effective and safe method for reducing postoperative blood loss and the need for postoperative blood transfusion.\n\nP19: Inconsistency and Ambiguity within the ICD-10 Procedure Coding System for Hip Fractures\n\nLevent Ozdemir 1 , Joshua Anderson 1 , Jeffery Stambough 1 , Simon Mears 1 , Benjamin Stronach 1 , and Lowry Barnes 1\n\n1 University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences\n\nAim: The International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) was created to increase granularity of procedures and standardize disease tracking. Concern exists that increase in complexity could lead to inaccurate data. Methods: ICD-10 PCS codes for operatively treated femoral neck and pertrochanteric fractures from 2016-2019 were reviewed. Each figure of the ICD-10-PCS code was recorded. Definitions from the 2022 American Medical Association’s ICD-10 PCS Official Codebook were compared to the medical record, operative report, and implant record for each surgery. Results: 56.0% (135/241) of PCS codes had ambiguous, partially correct, or incorrect figures. 72.0% (72/100) of fractures treated with arthroplasty compared to 44.7% (63/141) treated with fixation had one or more inaccurate figures (P < 0.01). 9.5% (23/241) of codes contained at least one incorrect figure. Approach was coded ambiguously for 24.8% (29/117) of pertrochanteric fractures. Device/implant codes were partially correct in 34.9% (84/241) of PCS codes and in 78.4% (58/74) and 30.8% (8/26) of hemi (HA) and total hip arthroplasties (THA). 69.4% (86/124) of femoral neck fractures and 41.9% (49/117) of pertrochanteric fractures had one or more incorrect or partially correct figures (P < 0.01). 13.6% (3/22) of dynamic hip screws, 78.4% (58/74) HAs, 49.0% (47/96) of intramedullary nails (IMN), 63.6% (14/22) of percutaneous cannulated screws, and 46.2% (12/26) of THAs had at least one inaccurate figure. Conclusion: Despite the increased granularity of ICD-10 PCS codes, this system is inconsistent and often incorrect. The poor validity of this system may impact clinical and research conclusions obtained from these codes.\n\nP20: Preoperative CT has an Impact on the Stability Evaluation of Trochanteric Hip Fractures\n\nThomas Woldeyesus 1 , Jan-Erik Gjertsen 2 , Ingvild Dalen 1 , Terje Meling 1 , Mehdi Behzadi 1 , Knut Harboe 1 , and Ane Djuv 3\n\n1 Stavanger University Hospital, 2 Haukeland university hospital, Bergen, Norway, 3 Stavanger university hospital, Stavanger, Norway\n\nAim: To evaluate if supplementary Computer Tomography (CT) influences the stability evaluation of trochanteric hip fractures. Method: From September 2020 to January 2022 patients 65 years and older admitted with an x-ray verified trochanteric hip fracture to Stavanger University Hospital were eligible for inclusion. Study patients underwent a preoperative CT of the hip. Orthopaedic surgeons preoperatively assessed the X-rays, classified the fractures according to the AO/OTA, Modified Evans Jensen, and Modified Nakano classification systems and answered seven fracture morphology questions. The assessments were repeated using the CT images. An expert group consisting of two consultant orthopaedic surgeons and one consultant radiologist did the same evaluations. Fracture stability was inferred from the classifications provided. Results: The study included 121 patients. Fractures defined by surgeons as stable on x-ray were re-evaluated as unstable on CT in 21% (95%CI: 12-30%), 42% (95%CI: 30-55%), and 20% (95%CI: 10-29%) of the cases using AO/OTA, Modified Evans Jensen, and Modified Nakano classification respectively. The expert group re-evaluated the fractures from stable on x-ray to unstable on CT in 48% (95% CI: 29-67%), 65% (95% CI: 42-87%), and 19% (95% CI: 7-32%) of the cases using AO/OTA, Modified Evans Jensen, and Modified Nakano classification respectively. Conclusions: Stability assessment of trochanteric fractures with x-ray alone will in substantial amount of cases leave unstable fracture morphologies undetected. The supplementary findings on CT may impact the surgeon´s choice of treatment and clinical outcome for the patients. Thus, our data supports the use of preoperative CT in patients with trochanteric fractures.\n\nP21: Incidence of Hip Fracture During the COVID-19 Disaster in Tottori Prefecture\n\nMari Osaki 1 , Shinpei Enokida 2 , Hideki Nagashima 2 , and Hiroshi Hagino\n\n1 Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Tottori University Hospital, 2 Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Tottori University\n\nIntroduction: The COVID-19 epidemic emerged from China has spread worldwide since the beginning of 2020, and Japan also experienced behavioral restrictions in March, including simultaneous nationwide school closings and telecommuting. The purpose of this study was to investigate the number and characteristics of patients with hip fractures in Tottori Prefecture in 2020. Methods: Patients with hip fractures aged 35 years or older who were treated at medical facilities in Tottori Prefecture between January and December 2020 were included in the study. The number of patients by age, sex, and type of fracture was investigated, and the incidence rate per 100,000 population was calculated and compared to the number and incidence rates of previous years. Results: The total number of hip fracture cases was 1175, including 237 males, 938 females, 554 neck fractures, 617 trochanteric fractures, and 4 unknown cases. The number of patients was up from 1110 in 2019, but lower than in 2016-2018 (average 1235). The number of patients per month declined sharply from April through June, and rose thereafter, with the highest number in October (118 cases/month). The incidence rate per 100,000 population showed a similar trend since 2007. Conclusions: In 2020, the Tottori Prefecture all-county survey showed a similar trend. The number of COVID-19 patients in Tottori Prefecture, was kept at the lowest level in the country during the year 2020, so it was thought that the number of patients with hip fractures may not be affected.\n\nP22: Prevalence and Risk Factors of Osteoporosis Among Postmenopausal Women of Rural Nepal\n\nDipendra Pandey 1\n\n1 Trishuli Hospital, Nuwakot, Nepal\n\nAim: The objective of the study was to find out the prevalence of osteoporosis among postmenopausal women of rural Nepal and different factors associated with it. Methods: A cross-sectional study involving 384 postmenopausal women residing in three district of rural Nepal. Bone Mineral Density (BMD) (g/cm2) of proximal femur and lumbar spine was measured using Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA). Similarly, factors related to osteoporosis among the participants were also analyzed. Results: Among the 384 women who underwent BMD assessment, 22.14% (n = 85) of them had osteoporosis. Moreover, 1.82% (n = 7) of them had severe osteoporosis. Height and Body Mass Index was found to be positively correlated with BMD. Furthermore, duration of menopause affected BMD negatively. Other factors associated with BMD were found to be current age, serum Calcium level, age at menopause, and smoking. Conclusion: Using the DEXA scan for bone mineral density, the study concluded that the prevalence of osteoporosis among postmenopausal women in rural Nepal was 22.14%. BMD significantly reduces with increasing age, increasing duration of menopause, falling serum calcium. BMD also reduces with falling serum albumin and Vitamin D, but was not found to be significant.\n\nP23: Fracture Liaison Services – How Many Fractures Should a Service Expect?\n\nShireen Bhujwalla 1 , Jan Sorensen 1 , John Carey 2 , and Frances Dockery 3\n\n1 Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, 2 National University of Ireland, Galway, 3 Beaumont Hospital, Dublin\n\nBackground: Fragility/low-trauma fractures are a major healthcare burden, yet many are preventable through Fracture Liaison Services (FLS). A reliable estimate of fracture numbers is essential to measure FLS efficiency. Currently the Irish FLS database uses the UK estimate of 1:4 hip vs. non-hip fracture numbers. We wanted to explore its accuracy in an Irish population. Methods: We looked at all plain x-ray reports from six individual weeks across two years in our hospital. We selected those with reported new fracture age >50 yrs. We determined ratio of hip:non-hip fractures and of admitted:discharged. We cross checked against admitted fractures from the Hospital Inpatient Enquiry system for the same 6 weeks. We then looked at hospital admissions from all Irish Emergency Departments 2018-2019 with new fracture aged >50 yrs. We compared hip:non-hip fracture ratio vs. local data. Results: From 7,654 x-ray reports, 222 new fracture patients were identified. An additional 29 patients sustained fractures during this period, either diagnosed on CT/MRI or managed as fractures despite negative radiology report. The ratio admitted:discharged fractures was 2:3. Ratio of patients with hip:non-hip fractures was 1:9.5. Nationally there were 33,627 fracture patients aged >50y admitted to Irish hospitals in 2018-9; of these, the hip:non-hip fracture ratio was 1:3. Adding estimated numbers of non-admitted fracture patients (based on our local data) gave a 1:9 hip:non-hip ratio nationally. Conclusion: Fracture numbers in Ireland are markedly underestimated if extrapolating from UK estimates. This has implications for service planning for FLS in Ireland, if rising fracture numbers are to be addressed.\n\nP24: How Did We Win Policy Change for Geriatric Hip Fractures: Early Surgery Under Orthogeriatric Comanagement\n\nTakeshi Sawaguchi 1 and Kenji Shigemoto 2\n\n1 Fukushima Medical University, Shinyurigaoka General Hospital, 2 Toyama City Hospital\n\nAim: We report on our process of the policy changes in Japan's hip fracture practice. Method: We thought it is necessary to create the Japanese evidence of Orthogeriatric comanagement to persuade people and the government and started our team approach in Toyama city hospital in 2013. We showed the evidence in our hospital under the healthcare system in Japan that this approach is beneficial for the patients (less complications, less mortality), for the hospital (shorter hospital stay, increased income) and for the government (less healthcare cost). We presented our results several times at the meeting of the related academic societies, and publicized benefit of Orthogeriatric comanagement. Particularly, the Japanese Orthopedic Association picked up this as the topic of the press briefing in 2019 and the benefits was reported in many newspapers, TV program. We appealed to members of the Diet and the person in charge of the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, and invited them to the annual congress of the FFN Japan to let them understand the importance of the Orthogeriatric comanagement. Furthermore, the related academic societies strongly requested the reimbursement for early surgery of geriatric hip fractures under Orthogeriatric comanagement. Result: This year Japanese government decided to reimburse early surgery (within 48 hours after injury) under the condition for FFN's database registration and secondary fracture prevention. Conclusion: Through these series of efforts, we have obtained policy change for geriatric hip fractures in Japan: early surgery under Orthogeriatric comanagement and secondary fracture prevention.\n\nP25: Trabecular Bone Score is Associated with Prospective Fracture and Refracture in Adults\n\nKara Anderson 1 , Pamela Rufus-Membere 1 , Natalie Hyde 1 , Didier Hans 2 , Julie Pasco 1 , Mark Kotowicz 1 , and Kara Holloway-Kew 1\n\n1 IMPACT, Deakin University, 2 Centre of Bone Diseases, Lausanne University Hospital\n\nIntroduction: Trabecular bone score (TBS) is a textural algorithm for lumbar spine dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans which evaluates trabecular microarchitecture. TBS may improve the assessment of fracture risk, complementary to bone mineral density (BMD), and aid in identifying individuals likely to refracture. This study investigated associations between TBS, incident fracture, and refracture. Methods: Lumbar spine BMD L2-L4 (Lunar Prodigy) and TBS L1-L4 (TBS iNsight V2.2) were obtained for men (n = 894) and women (n = 681) aged 24-98 yr from the Geelong Osteoporosis Study. Low trauma incident fractures, including major osteoporotic fractures (MOF; hip, spine, proximal humerus or wrist) were identified radiologically. Cox-proportional hazards modelling (from date of DXA scan to first fracture, death, or study-end) was used to explore associations between lower TBS and fracture in all participants and in participants with prior fracture (<10 yr before TBS measurement). Results: Fifty-five fractured participants were identified (17 clinical spine, 4 wrist, 9 hip, 2 proximal humerus, 7 distal tibia/fibula, 6 tarsals/metatarsals, 6 rib, 2 femur, 10 other); a rate of 5.8/1000 person-years (95% CI:4.4-7.5). Of 151 participants with a prior fracture, 13 reported an incident fracture (9 MOFs): incidence 16.4/1000 person-years (95% CI:9.5-28.2). Lower TBS was associated with increased risk of fracture (unadjusted-HR=1.30, 95% CI:1.09-1.56) and MOF (HR=1.56, 95% CI:1.24-1.97); adjustment for confounders and LSBMD attenuated results (HR=1.04, 95%CI:0.86-1.27 and HR=1.21, 95% CI:0.93-1.57 respectively). Among prior fractured participants, refracture risk (HR=1.59, 95% CI:1.11-2.27) was attenuated after adjustments (adjusted-HR=1.39, 95% CI:0.91-2.12); results for MOFs were sustained (unadjusted-HR=1.73, 95% CI:1.15-2.59, adjusted-HR=2.42, 95% CI:1.09-5.36). Conclusions: Lower TBS was associated with increased risk for major osteoporotic refracture.\n\nP26: Current Management of Fragility Fractures – A Survey of Orthopaedic Surgeons from the Asia Pacific Region\n\nJoon Kiong Lee 1 , Ding-Cheng (Derrick) Chan 2 , Paul Mitchell 3 , Aasis Unnanuntana 4 , Yew-Lok Woo 5 , and Rajesh Malhotra 6\n\n1 Fragility Fracture Network Malaysia, 2 National Taiwan University Hsin-Chu Hospital, Taiwan, 3 Synthesis Medical NZ Limited, Auckland, New Zealand, 4 Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand, 5 Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, 6 Department of Orthopaedics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India\n\nAims: A survey of the membership of the Asia Pacific Orthopaedic Association (APOA) was undertaken as a collaboration of the Asia Pacific Osteoporosis and Fragility Fracture Society (APOFFS) and Asia Pacific Fragility Fracture Alliance (APFFA) Evidence Generation Working Group to understand current practices around the management of fragility fractures in the Asia Pacific region. Methods and Results: The 700 APOA members and 65,000 APOA Federated Fellows were emailed an online survey with 27 questions for electronic data collection. Survey responses were kept anonymous. The survey comprised questions on the respondents’ APOA membership, their orthopaedic specialty; as well as questions on the care of fragility fracture patients at presentation, surgery and mobilisation, secondary fracture prevention and available services at affiliated sites. This presentation highlights key features of this survey along with key insights. Conclusions: The survey findings will inform development of future educational initiatives relating to the management of individuals who sustain fragility fractures across the Asia Pacific region.\n\nP27: Hip Fracture Care Pathways in Australian Linked Data: Higher Mortality 1-Year Post Admission in Aged Care Patients\n\nSteph Gordon 1 and Kevin Monahan 1\n\n1 Australian Institute of Health and Welfare\n\nAims: This study uses national linked data to explore the journeys of hospitalised hip fracture patients in Australia, including survival 1-year after admission. Methods: Data from 2010–11 onwards from multiple national datasets were used, including: emergency department and admitted patient care data (as available), residential aged care and deaths data. Hip fracture patients were selected by acute hospital admissions for people aged 45 and over with a principal diagnosis of hip fracture in 2015–16, to allow for sufficient follow-up. Results: Around 18,000 people aged 45 and over were admitted with a hip fracture in 2015–16. Around 25% of patients died within 1-year after that admission for hip fracture. The unadjusted risk ratio showed that patients who resided in aged care prior to their hip fracture were 2.9 times as likely to have died within 1 year (49%) compared with those living in the community prior to their hip fracture hospitalisation (17%). Those aged 65–84 in aged care were 3.3 times as likely to have died within 1 year, while those aged 85 and over in aged care were 2.1 times as likely, compared with those of the same age living in the community prior to their hip fracture. Conclusions: National linked data demonstrates high mortality 1-year after admission for hip fracture, particularly for aged care residents. The use of 2015–16 data establishes a baseline and will allow future monitoring of the outcomes of hip fracture patients over time.\n\nP28: Not Another Nail in the Coffin: The Mortality Risk of Cement Use in Arthroplasty for Hip Fractures\n\nNiamh Ramsay, Jacqueline Close 1 , Ian Harris, and Lara Harvey\n\n1 Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, Australia\n\nBackground: Cementing in arthroplasty for hip fractures has been associated with a small increased risk of death within 30 days of surgery but improved postoperative functional outcomes. Quantifying this mortality risk is important in providing evidence-based care and minimising the subsequent health burden of this presentation. The objective of this study was to determine the association between cement use in arthroplasty and mortality in patients aged 50 years and over with intracapsular femoral neck fracture at 30 days and up to 1 year following date of surgery. Methods: This retrospective cohort study used Australian Hip Fracture Registry data. Logistic regression was used to test the association between cement use and 30-day mortality following surgery. One-year mortality was analysed using Kaplan Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazard modelling, adjusted for covariates. Given the known institutional variation, an instrumental variable analysis was also performed. Results: The mortality rate was 6.5% for cemented and 4.5% for uncemented surgical fixation (n = 15,405). However, once adjusted for covariates including sex, age, place of residence, premorbid level of function, preadmission cognitive function and ASA grade, this difference was not significant (P = 0.31, OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.86-1.60, n = 13,033). Instrumental variable analysis also revealed that cement use was not significantly associated with mortality (OR 0.997, 95% CI 0.965-1.030). Conclusions: No statistically significant difference in patient mortality with cement use in arthroplasty was demonstrated in an Australian population. Given the established postoperative functional benefits of cement use in arthroplasty, this study concludes that it is a safe and effective means of surgical fixation.\n\nP29: Effectiveness of Perioperative Interventions to Improve Mobility After Hip Fracture\n\nMitchell Sarkies and Luke Testa 1\n\n1 Macquarie University\n\nAims: Investigate the effectiveness of perioperative interventions to improve mobility after hip fracture. Methods: A systematic review of peer-reviewed English articles published from the year 2000 onwards was conducted. Experimental and quasi-experimental studies examining the effect of perioperative interventions on mobilisation during the acute hospital stay for hip fracture patients aged 50 years and older were included. Four reviewers independently conducted the abstract, full-text review, extracted data, and conducted risk of bias assessment. Results: 1,325 unique records were identified, 42 of which underwent full text review. A total of 22 studies were included. Outcome data was collected between day 1 and 14. Femoral nerve blocks reduced time to first mobility, led to higher levels of function and longer walking distance, and minimised the impact of pain on mobility. Postoperative pathways led to early mobilisation being achieved more frequently and earlier, and higher levels of function, however mixed results were reported for ability to mobilise at discharge. Rehabilitation therapies such as preoperative rehab and cycle ergometry improved function and gait speed, but no difference was reported for multidisciplinary rehab. Postoperative protocols that specified full weight bearing appeared to facilitate higher levels of function and gait speed, while there was no difference in the ability to walk after epidural anaesthesia. Clinical supervision improved early and daily mobility, providing patients with an information booklet may have improved function, and improved nutrition did not improve the ability to walk without assistance. Conclusions: Perioperative interventions can improve early mobility and function after hip fracture surgery.\n\nP30: Patient and Hospital Factors Influencing the Ability to Mobilise Day 1 After Hip Fracture Surgery\n\nVictoria Woodcroft-Brown 1 , MitchellSarkies 2 , Jack Bell 3 , Rebecca Mitchell 2 , and Chrys Pulle 4\n\n1 The Prince Charles Hospital, 2 Macquarie University, 3 Prince Charles Hospital, 4 Queensland Health\n\nAims: Compare patient demographics, injury characteristics, and hospital processes for older adults with a surgically-managed hip fracture and examine predictors of actual first day mobilisation. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from the Australian and New Zealand Hip Fracture Registry between 1st January 2020 to 31st December 2020. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with actual first day mobilisation postoperatively. Results: There were 14,209 hip fracture patients, of which 5,981 (42.1%) mobilised day 1 and 6,337 (44.6%) did not mobilise day 1. There were 1,891 (13.3%) whose mobility status was unknown. Younger age, previously living in private residence, higher pre-admission walking ability, normal pre-admission cognition, lower American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification, intracapsular undisplaced/impacted displaced, assessed as no delirium, or not malnourished were predictors for actual first day mobilisation. The odds of actual first day mobilisation was higher for individuals given analgesia within 30 minutes of ED presentation, received surgery within 48 hours, had general anaesthesia, consultant surgeon present during operation, cannulated screws, unrestricted weight bearing, or were provided the opportunity to mobilise. Hospitals with higher annual hip fracture volume, geriatric or medical consult service on referral or another model, no planned theatre list for hip fracture patients, offer nerve blocks prior to surgery, or provide routine access to therapy on weekends had higher odds of actual first day mobilisation. Conclusions: Patient and injury characteristics, care processes, and hospital factors may affect whether people are actually mobilise day 1 post hip fracture surgery.\n\nP31: Hand Injuries During COVID-19 UK Lockdown: How Did the Pandemic Affect One-Year Functional Outcomes?\n\nZeid Morcos, Joe Barrett-Lee, Fadi Hindi, Moustafa Mahmoud, Cristina Gavrila, and Darren Roberts\n\nBackground: The COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic in March 2020, forcing the UK into a national lockdown. The aim was to evaluate the effect of this lockdown on hand injuries referred through the trauma and orthopaedics Virtual Fracture Clinic (VFC) service and their subsequent management given limited resources. This study also aimed to identify complications and evaluate functional outcomes. Methods: Patients referred through VFC at Queen Alexandra Hospital during April and May 2020 with hand injuries were analysed. Isolated injuries to the carpus and wrist were excluded. Controls were compared over identical timespans prior to lockdown and after the restrictions were eased. Functional outcomes were measured using the QuickDASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand) score, at twelve months post-injury. Results: There was a 68% reduction in referrals of hand injuries during lockdown. Lower numbers of sporting injuries were seen, in contrast to an increase rate of falls, crush injuries, and recreational cycling. Despite a higher number of patients being discharged from VFC during lockdown, there were no increased rates of complications from conservatively managed hand fractures. 80% reported low QuickDASH scores with a median of 2.3. Satisfaction was high, with 73% either satisfied or very satisfied with their treatment and outcome. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that there remains a burden of hand trauma during lockdowns and therefore service provision for future lockdowns should consider this. Most patients can be managed conservatively, and a high proportion can be discharged from VFC with low complication rates and high satisfaction.\n\nP32: Is the Association of Physical Activity with Bone Microarchitecture Causal? A Study of Adult Female Twin Pairs\n\nVivienne F Cesser, Frida Igland Nissen, John Hopper, Minh Bui, Shuai Li, Åshild Bjørnerem, and Ann Kristin Hansen\n\nThe association between physical activity (PA) and bone microarchitecture is not fully understood. We examined whether the associations between PA and bone traits were consistent with causation and/or shared familial factors using a cross-sectional study of 47 dizygotic and 93 monozygotic female twin pairs aged 31-77 years. Images of the nondominant distal tibia were obtained using high-resolution-peripheral quantitative computed tomography. The bone microarchitecture was assessed using the StrAx1.0 software. Based on a self-completed questionnaire, a PA index was calculated as a weighted sum of weekly hours of light (walking, light gardening), moderate (social tennis, golf, hiking), and vigorous activity (competitive active sports) = light + 2*moderate + 3*vigorous. We applied Inference about Causation through Examination of FAmiliaL CONfounding (ICE FALCON).\n\nWithin-individuals, distal tibia total and cortical bone mineral content, cortical cross-sectional area (CSA) and thickness were positively associated with PA (standardized regression coefficient (β) ranging 0.20-0.22; all P < 0.001). Porosity of the inner transitional zone and medullary CSA was negatively associated with PA (β = −0.17 and -0.22, P ≤ 0.001). For cortical thickness, the cross-pair cross-trait association with PA was significant before and after adjustment for the within-individual association (P = 0.034), whereas cortical and medullary CSA were significant before but not after adjustment. Absolute change in cross-pair cross-trait association for cortical thickness and medullary CSA were significant (P < 0.05).\n\nThe findings that increasing PA is associated with improved trabecular and cortical microarchitecture in adult females are novel and consistent with PA having a causal effect on bone microarchitecture in addition to shared familial factors.\n\nP33: Comparison of Hip Fracture Burden on Two Different National Health Care Systems in Europe. A Two country Five Hospital Study\n\nEfthymios Iliopoulos 1 , Stylianos Totas 2 , Irini Tatani 3 , Theodoros Tosounidis 4 , Georgios Drosos 2 , Elias Panagiotopoulos 3 , and Antony Johansen 5\n\n1 University of Thrace, Greece. University College London Hospital, UK, 2 University of Thrace, Greece, 3 University of Patras, Greece, 4 University of Heraklion, Greece, 5 University of Cardiff, UK\n\nHip fractures have a significant burden for the national health care systems across the globe. In pilot work for the development of a national hip fracture registry in Greece, we examine the demographics, treatment and outcome data, across five hospitals in two European countries.\n\nWe used prospective data submitted to the IMPACT studies at the start of the COVID pandemic, between 01.03.2020-31.05.2020 from five hospitals of two different European countries (UK and Greece). The data was retrospectively combined and analysed by separate independent investigators.\n\nAfter exclusions, 241 patients were included. The mean age was 82.4 ± 8.5 years, with mean ASA grade of 2.6±0.7. Two thirds of patients received timely operation. The mean length of stay in hospital was 14.0 ± 11.5 days. The overall 30-day mortality reached 6.8%. According to the ASA the UK patients appeared significantly worse(P = 0.002). There was statistically significant difference of the chosen operation type(P < 0.0001). Most of the UK patients received their operation within 36 hours. The length of stay and the 30-day mortality were significantly lower in Greece(P < 0.0001).\n\nBoth systems face their own challenges about the neck of femur fragility fractures. Mortality and length of stay appear to be lower in Greece, while in the UK patients appear sicker with more intracapsular fractures and different chosen operations. However, it remains possible that patients in these countries were more similar than these data suggest. This pilot work for the development of a national registry in Greece highlights the need to refine how data are collected across much larger numbers of people.\n\nP34: Hypoalbuminemia Increases Complications In Elderly Patients Operated For Hip Fracture\n\nLuigi Residori 1 , Oscar Bortolami 2 , and Vincenzo Di Francesco 1\n\n1 Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata di Verona, 2 University of Verona\n\nBackground: Drop of serum albumin after hip-surgery has been reported but few data are available on the effect on complications. Aim of this study was to assess the role of two orthopedic surgical procedures (fixation or prosthesis) and pre-surgery albumin serum level on the development of complications. Methods: 176 subject aged 65 and older with hip fracture hospitalized either in Orthopedics or Geriatrics Ward in a 15 months period; 152 patients have been analyzed. Measurements included gender, age, surgical procedure, medical complications, admission and post-surgery albumin. Results: All patients, regardless of surgery procedure, underwent a loss of albumin from (mean± SD) 32.6 ± 4.3 g/L to 25.0 ± 3.8 g/L.\n\nComplications were associated with albumin level both at pre-surgery (no complications: 33.9 ± 3.5 g/L; n = 80; complications: 31.2 ± 4.7 g/L; n = 72;P < 0.001) and post-surgery (no complications 26.2 ± 3.5 g/L; n = 80; complications: 23.7 ± 3.6 g/L; n = 72; P < 0.001).\n\nIn a multivariable model, increased risk in incidence of complications was found in subjects with preoperative albumin below 30 g/L (OR 3.74; CI 95%: 1.43-9.80) and in subjects undergoing prothesis procedure (OR 1.97; CI 95%: 1.00-3.88). Conclusions: We observed that fixation and prosthesis were associated with a decrease in albumin level. Given a low pre-surgery level of albumin, the risk of complications was higher than in patient with pre surgery normal level of albumin. This pilot study suggests further prospective research, considering whether albumin administration could be effective in preventing the falling in the albumin level after surgery, thus reducing postoperative complication rate.\n\nP35: A Call to Actioning Nutrition Care Processes That Meet Care Standards; Patient Level Findings From the ANZ Hip Fracture Registry Nutrition Sprint Audit\n\nJack Bell, Rebecca Mitchell 1 , Ian Harris, Hannah Seymour, Elizabeth Armstrong, Roger Harris 2 , Stewart Fleming, Sarah Hurring 3 , and Jacqui Close\n\n1 Australian Institute of Health Innovation, Macquarie University, 2 Australian and New Zealand Hip Fracture Registry, 3 Canterbury District Health Board, Christchurch, New Zealand\n\nAims: Malnutrition is a potentially preventable condition, and one of the strongest predictors of morbidity, mortality and treatment costs in older adults with hip fracture. Whether nutrition guidelines and standards are being met in patients with hip fracture remains unclear. This project aimed to audit nutrition care processes provided to inpatients with a hip fracture admitted to participating sites in Australia and New Zealand. Methods: The ANZ Hip Fracture Registry Sprint Audit on malnutrition was undertaken between 1 - 31 August 2021. Hospitals across Australia and New Zealand voluntarily contributed patient-level data for patients with a hip fracture aged 50+ years. Results: Preliminary patient-level results are presented for 460 patients across 30 hospitals. Malnutrition was diagnosed in 28.8% of patients. Less than half (44.6%) of patients audited received at least one form of nutritional support. Non-prescribed oral nutritional supplements were provided to 36.5% of patients; only 18.7% of patients were prescribed oral nutrition supplements as medicine. Enteral tube feeding (n = 2), peripheral (n = 1) and central parenteral nutrition (n = 1) were rarely prescribed. Of particular note was the 1 in 2 patients who were diagnosed with malnutrition and were not provided with diagnostic advice and a treatment plan. Conclusions: Evidence based guidelines and standards of nutrition care are not met for many older Australian and New Zealander adults with hip fracture. Articulating this key problem is the first step towards transforming nutrition care processes, improving patient and health care outcomes, and minimising treatment costs.\n\nP36: Exercise Interventions for Falls Prevention in Aged Care: Trial Endpoint Meta-Analyses\n\nSuzanne Dyer 1 , Jenni Suen 1 , Rik Dawson 2 , Wing S Kwok 2 , Ian D Cameron 3 , and Cathie Sherrington 2\n\n1 Rehabilitation, Aged and Extended Care, College of Medicine and Public Health, Flinders Health and Medical Research Institute, Flinders University of South Australia, Bedford Park, Australia, 2 Institute for Musculoskeletal Health, The University of Sydney, 3 John Walsh Centre for Rehabilitation Research, Northern Sydney Local Health District and the University of Sydney, St Leonards, Australia\n\nBackground/Aim: The effectiveness of exercise for falls and fracture prevention in aged care settings is highly variable (Cameron et al, 2018). This study updates meta-analyses from the latest Cochrane Collaboration review with additional analyses examining outcomes measured immediately after exercise, or after post-intervention follow-up. Methods: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from a Cochrane review (Cameron, 2018) examining falls prevention exercise interventions in aged care facilities, plus additional trials from a search update to December 2021, with data suitable for meta-analysis of the rate of falls or risk of falling were included. Results: 19 RCTs were included, some reported both study endpoint times. Overall, exercise probably reduces the rate of falls, however trial findings are highly heterogenous (17 trials, rate ratio [RaR]=0.73, 95% CI 0.57–0.94, P = 0.01; I²=84%). At the end of the intervention period, exercise probably reduces the number of falls (13 trials, RaR = 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.50–0.96, P = 0.03; I²=85%) but in post-intervention follow-up has little or no effect if exercise is not sustained (8 trials, RaR=1.02, 95% CI 0.81–1.28; I² = 57%). The effect of exercise on the number of people falling was similar (overall 14 trials, risk ratio [RR]=0.91, 95% CI 0.78-1.06; end of intervention RR= 0.83, 95%CI 0.71–0.98, 11 trials; post-intervention follow-up RR = 1.05; 95%CI 0.90-1.23, 7 trials). Conclusions: Exercise is recommended as a falls prevention strategy for older people living in residential aged care. However, exercise has little or no effect on falls beyond the delivery of a program; continuation of exercise is required for effective falls prevention.\n\nP37: Comparison of the Prescription of Bone Protection Medication Before and After Hip Fracture in Australia and New Zealand\n\nRebecca Mitchell 1 , RogerHarris 2 , Nicole Halim 1 , Sarah Hurring 3 , Nicola Ward 4 , and Ian Cameron 5\n\n1 Australian Institute of Health Innovation, Macquarie University, 2 Australian and New Zealand Hip Fracture Registry, 3 Canterbury District Health Board, Christchurch, New Zealand, 4 Australian and New Zealand Hip Fracture Registry Coordination for New Zealand, 5 John Walsh Centre for Rehabilitation Research, Northern Sydney Local Health District and Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Sydney\n\nAims: To compare Australian and New Zealand approaches to the prescription of bone protection medication (BPM) pre- and post-hip fracture and determine reasons why BPM was not prescribed early after fracture. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of hip fracture patients from the Australian and New Zealand Hip Fracture Registry aged ≥50 years during 2016 to 2020 was conducted, along with a BPM sprint audit of consecutive hip fracture patients in Australia and New Zealand during November 2021. Multiple logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with patients not taking BPM. Results: Less than 10% of patients in Australia and New Zealand were taking BPM on admission, increasing to 22.4% in Australia and 27.8% in New Zealand on discharge. Patients who were younger (50-69 years), healthy (ASA grade 1), who lived in a residential aged care facility (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.18; 95% CI 1.08-1.29), who had impaired cognition (AOR 1.11; 95% CI 1.01-1.22), delirium identified (AOR 1.10; 95% CI 1.00-1.21), and who were awaiting a specialist falls assessment (AOR 2.40; 95% CI 1.50-3.82) had a higher likelihood of not taking BPM. The most common reason for not prescribing BPM was ‘low level of vitamin D and awaiting levels to increase’ in Australia (13.3%), and ‘poor renal function’ in New Zealand (14.8%). Conclusions: BPM prescription early after hip fracture is low and the BPM sprint audit identified reasons for low BPM treatment. Enhanced rates of prescription and treatment with BPM can protect bone health and prevent further fractures among hip fracture patients.\n\nP38: Can General Practitioners Take the Helm in Osteoporosis Refracture Prevention? A Proof of Concept From a Regional Setting in Northern New South Wales, Australia\n\nCraig Knox 1 , Peter Silberberg 2 , Belinda Ford 3 , Gill Schierhout 4 , Vicki Rose 1 , Peter Wong 5 , Chris Needs 6 , and Liz Hay 7\n\n1 VBHC NNSWLHD, 2 Healthy NorthCoast Primary Health Network, 3 The George Institute for Global Health, 4 The George Institute for Global Health, UNSW Sydney, NSW Australia, 5 Department of Rheumatology, Westmead Hospital, 6 Royal Prince Alfred Hospital NSW, University of Sydney, 7 Ministry of Health NSW\n\nAims: To evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of a novel General Practitioner-led Model of Care of Osteoporosis Refracture Prevention (GP-led ORP) for bone health management after Minimal Trauma Fracture (MTF) in regional/rural Australia. Methods: People over the age of 50 presenting to Emergency Departments (ED) with a MTF in the Northern New South Wales Local Health District (NNSWLHD) - Richmond Network were referred by a Fracture Liaison Coordinator (FLC) to their GP for bone health investigations and ongoing management. Mixed methods were used: i) GPs and patients were surveyed to assess uptake of reviews, initiation of bone-protective therapy (BPT), and 12-month adherence, ii) health care stakeholders interviews are being conducted iii) linked health datasets will explore patient outcomes and comparison to specialist-led services. Results: From December 2018 to 2020, 665 patients with MTF were referred to their GP, 645 (97%) were reviewed, and 389 (60%) initiated BPT. At 12 months, 351 people (90%) remained adherent to BPT, and 6% had endured refracture. 189 GPs were engaged in ORP assessments with wide geographical coverage. Stakeholders reveal how and why GP-led ORP works in regional areas, including GP engagement, communication, and coordination of services. Conclusion: This novel collaborative model between general practice and a hospital-based FLC provides an alternative to tertiary specialist-led clinics, showing a high level of acceptance and BPT adherence by patients. Longer-term outcomes and comparison to specialist services should be explored.\n\nP39: Variation in Mortality Rates Following Hip Fracture Across the Asia Pacific Region: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\n\nLara Harvey 1 , Narelle Payne 1 , Morag Taylor 1 , Elizabeth Armstrong 1 , and Jacqui Close 2\n\n1 Neuroscience Research Australia, 2 Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, Australia\n\nAims: Estimates suggest by 2050 there will be between 4.5 and 6.2 million hip fractures globally each year, with half of these occurring in Asia. We aimed to estimate the in-hospital, 30-day and 1-year mortality rate following hip fracture across the Asia Pacific region. Methods: Five databases (MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science) were systematically searched from 1 January 2010 to 15 September 2021. Eligible studies included older adults (≥50 years) admitted to hospital in the Asia Pacific region with an acute hip fracture, reporting data from 2010 onwards. Eligible study designs were: epidemiological reports, cohort studies, case control studies and clinical trials. There were no language restrictions. Two investigators independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and critically appraised study quality. Pooled mortality estimates for each country/region were calculated using a random effects model. Results: The review included 305 studies from 15 countries/regions. Meta-analysis revealed that there was a wide range in mortality between countries/regions reported at each of the three time periods: in-hospital mortality ranged from 1.1% to 5.3%, 30-day mortality from 1.0% to 7.6% and 1-year mortality from 1.1% to 23.8%. Conclusion: There was wide variation in mortality rates across the region. This variation may be due to differences in population demographics, access to hospital and surgery, models of care or study selection and reporting bias. A more consistent approach to the collection and reporting of data is needed to facilitate international comparisons.

The tool replaced traditional clinician-based identification and referral to Fracture Liaison Services (FLS) in Nov 2020. Traditional strategies frequently miss secondary prevention after vertebral fracture. We retrospectively evaluate the tool’s performance. Methods: A keyword search identified encounters between May 2019-2020 where vertebral fracture was mentioned in the eMR. A proportion of medical records were reviewed to verify accuracy of identification and appropriacy for FLS referral. We compared the number that actually received subsequent hospital-based secondary fracture prevention using the pre-existing clinician-based screening and referral model. We extrapolated proportions to the whole dataset to estimate service impact. Results: The tool identified 593 cases over 12-months. On conducting 146 chart reviews, 121 (83%) were true positives. Of these, 16 (13%) would not warrant FLS referral (3 major trauma, 11 pathological fracture, 2 deceased). Of 105 (72%) remaining, 61 were identified on imaging performed during that encounter. Four were imaged within the preceding 6-months. Imaging was performed for reasons unrelated to trauma/backpain in 53 cases. Only 10 received FLS/endocrine follow-up. Extrapolating to 593 cases/yr, the Finding Tool potentially identifies 426 FLS-appropriate cases, of which 385 would historically be missed. Restricting cases to fractures imaged within 6 months stil identifies 264 patients. Conclusion: The electronic Finding Tool identifies vertebral fractures with reasonable sensitivity. Many cases warranting FLS review were missed by standard care. Addressing >250 patients/yr poses significant service burden.\n\nP41: Finding Appropriate Patients for Osteoporotic Refracture Prevention (ORP) Services Across New South Wales\n\nDanella Hackett 1 , JuliaThompson 2 , Sanders King 3 , Hemanth Gokula 3 , Aaron Hall 1 , Minh Nguyen 4 , Lauren Doherty 5 , and Allison Sigmund 5\n\n1 Agency for Clinical Innovation, 2 Musculoskeletal Network Care Across the Lifecycle and Society, Agency for Clinical Innovation, 3 eHealth NSW, 4 Westmead Hospital, Western Sydney Local Health District, 5 Blacktown Hospital, Western Sydney Local Health District\n\nAim: Evaluate if the finding tool developed for the electronic medical record (eMR) is more efficient and effective in finding eligible people for ORP services. Method: The New South Wales (NSW) Agency for Clinical Innovation (ACI) ORP model of care was launched in 2011 and expanded across NSW in 2017. People are eligible for ORP services if they are aged over 50 years and present with a minimal trauma fracture (MTF) at acute, outpatient, community and primary healthcare settings. Suitable people are identified for the service by referral and fracture liaison coordinators (FLCs) actively screening emergency department (ED) lists. ACI and eHealth NSW collaborated with clinicians in NSW ORP services to review the screening process and co-design, build and pilot the screening tool. Results: Prior to the screening tool, across 2 services, an average of 623 people were identified through the Emergency Department per month for clinicians to screen for access to the ORP service. Clinical screening identified that 20% of people had a MTF and were eligible for the ORP service (122 people). Following implementation of the e-tool an average of 252 people were identified for screening per month. Post implementation clinical screening identified that an average 57% of people across the 2 services were eligible for the ORP service (143 people). Conclusion: The implementation of a co-designed electronic finding tool in the eMR, reduced clinician screening load and increased accuracy of identification. This resulted in additional service needs requiring a prioritisation framework.\n\nP42: Surgical Interventions for Treating Intracapsular Hip Fractures in Older Adults: A Series of Cochrane Reviews\n\nSharon Lewis, Richard Macey, Jamie Stokes, Jonathon Cook, Martyn Parker, William GP Eardley, Ján Dixon, and Xavier Griffin\n\nAims: To assess the relative benefits and harms of all surgical treatments for intracapsular hip fractures. Methods: We conducted two Cochrane Reviews and one Cochrane Network Meta-analysis (NMA) comparing types of: internal fixation; arthroplasty; all surgical treatments and non-operative treatment. We searched nine databases in July 2020 for randomised controlled trials comparing treatments for fragility intracapsular hip fractures in older adults. Results: For internal fixation (38 studies, 8585 participants), we found no clinically important differences between screws, pins, or fixed angle plates. For arthroplasties (58 studies, 10,654 participants), cemented hemiarthroplasties (HA) likely improve quality of life and mortality, with fewer periprosthetic fractures but increased pulmonary embolism, compared to uncemented HA. In the NMA (119 studies, 17,653 participants), cemented modern unipolar HA, dynamic fixed angle plates and smooth pins had the greatest likelihood of reducing mortality, and arthroplasties had the greatest likelihood of reducing unplanned return to theatre compared to internal fixation and non-operative treatment. Evidence was limited, and therefore uncertain, for quality of life at 12 months. Conclusions: There was considerable variability in the ranking of treatments in our NMA, with no one outstanding, or subset of outstanding, superior treatment. However, cemented modern arthroplasties tended to yield better outcomes. Cemented modern arthroplasties may be a more successful approach than internal fixation. However, our evidence was mostly derived from displaced intracapsular fractures. THA may be an appropriate treatment for a subset of people with intracapsular fracture, but this was not explored in this series of reviews.\n\nP43: Surgical Interventions for Treating Extracapsular Hip Fractures in Older Adults: A Cochrane Review and Network Meta-Analysis\n\nSharon Lewis, Richard Macey, Jamie Stokes, James Gill, Jonathon Cook, Martyn Parker, Willian GP Eardley, and Xavier Griffin\n\nAims: To assess the relative benefits and harms of all surgical treatments for extracapsular hip fractures. Methods: We conducted a Cochrane Review comparing cephalomedullary nails with extramedullary implants, and a separate Cochrane network meta-analysis (NMA) comparing all types of surgical treatments and non-operative treatment. We searched nine databases in July 2020 for randomised controlled trials comparing treatments for fragility extracapsular hip fractures in older adults. Results: Most studies included both stable and unstable fractures, almost a third included only unstable fractures. In the Cochrane Review (76 studies, 10,979 participants), most effect estimates were imprecise and outcomes such as unplanned return to theatre, and functional status at four months included both clinically relevant benefits and harms for either treatment type. Whilst functional outcomes were similar, there was reduced infection and non-union with nails but increased risk of implant-related fracture. In the NMA (184 studies, 26,073 participants), we similarly found no differences in mortality between treatments. Both static fixed angle plates and condylocephalic nails had increased risk of unplanned return to theatre compared to dynamic fixed angle plates. Evidence for quality of life was too limited to analyse. Conclusion/findings: There was considerable variability in the ranking of treatments in our NMA, with no one outstanding superior treatment. Evidence for arthroplasty or external fixation is currently limited. Cephalomedullary nails and dynamic fixed angle plates contributed most evidence; findings from the NMA indicated no differences in mortality and re-operation risk. Static condylocephalic nails and static fixed angle plates may have higher risk of re-operation.\n\nP44: Impact on Access to and Outcomes of Inpatient Rehabilitation Following Hip Fracture During and Immediately Post COVID Lockdown in Australia\n\nTara Alexander\n\nAims: As part of the acute system response to COVID many inpatient rehabilitation (IR) beds were closed or repurposed, particularly in the public sector. This study aimed to review the impact of these bed closures and contracted use of private hospital IR beds for patients who sustained a fractured neck of femur (#NOF) during or immediately after lockdown. Methods: Australian #NOF IR admission data between 2016-2020 from the Australasian Rehabilitation Outcomes Centre (AROC) were reviewed. Inpatient volumes, admission and discharge characteristics and clinical outcomes for fractures that occurred during COVID lockdown or in the weeks immediately after lockdown were compared to fractures occurring during the same date range in 2016-2019 to control for possible seasonal variations. Results: During lockdown 905 patients and post lockdown 1,154 patients received IR care fpr #NOF. This represented a 10% decline from pre-COVID, however public hospital volumes actually declined 21% and private hospitals increased 6%. The decline was predominantly among low complexity patients in the public sector (29%). Although higher complexity patients are predominantly treated in public hospitals (64%), during and post lockdown private hospitals treated proportionately more patients with high complexity than pre-COVID (45% compared to 38%). Casemix-adjusted length of stay was 1 day less during and post lockdown. Conclusions: Bed closures resulted in more complex #NOF IR patients and a greater proportion receiving care in a private hospital. Regardless of where care was provided, compared to the pre-COVID years patient demographics and clinical outcomes were unchanged both during COVID and immediately after.\n\nP45: Hip Fracture Rates Following Introduction of a Fracture Liaison Service - 7 Year Data\n\nJas Birk 1 , Tim Kane 1 , Jasmine Parkes 1 , and Steven A. Young-Min 1\n\n1 Queen Alexandra Hospital, Portsmouth, UK\n\nBackground: In April 2014 a fracture liaison service (FLS) was introduced at the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth, which currently serves a population of 675,000 on the south coast of England. Aims: To assess the impact of the FLS on the incidence of hip fractures. Methods: We analysed data collected independently for the National Hip Fracture Database (NHFD) to look at the incidence of hip fractures in the years preceding and following the establishment of the FLS. We used trendlines to estimate the number of hip fractures expected/averted. Results: Introduction of the FLS was associated with an initial reduction in annual hip fracture admissions from 775 to 701 (fiscal years 2013/14 and 2014/15) followed by a reduction in the average annual rate of growth of hip fractures from 34 per year prior (2008/09-2013/14) to 3 per year in the 7 years after launching the FLS (2014/15-2020/21). Population modelling suggests that this has not been accounted for by demographic change alone. By extrapolating the prior trend, it’s estimated that 1195 hip fractures have been averted in the 7 years since introduction of the FLS. Based on the 2014/15 PbR tariff (£7,569), this would represent £9.04M of commissioner expenditure saved over the 7 years. Conclusion: The independently collected data suggests that an FLS, by targeting those at highest risk, had a measurable impact on the local rate of hip fracture with 1195 averted fractures over a 7-year period and an associated £9.04M cost saving.\n\nP46: Impact of a New FLS on an Established Bone Densitometry Service\n\nJas Birk 1 , Tim Kane 1 , Jasmine Parkes 1 , and Steven A. Young-Min 1\n\n1 Queen Alexandra Hospital, Portsmouth, UK\n\nBackground: A local pilot study and Department of Health analysis (2009) predicted that a new fracture liaison service (FLS) would lead to an annual increase of 97-134 DXA scans per 100,000 population. Objective: To investigate the impact of a new FLS (introduced April 2014) on our bone densitometry service serving our 660,000 population. This will inform others hoping to resource and FLS. Methods: The numbers of DXAs performed in the fiscal year prior to the FLS being introduced (2013-2014) and in the 6 years following FLS introduction (2014-2020) were analysed. Results: Of the 3451 patients scanned in 2013/14, 2867 were referred by their GP. In the 6 years following the FLS, there were an average of 3822 patients scanned per year, an increase of 371 additional scans per year. An annual average of 903 patients were scanned at request of the FLS and 2318 patients referred by their GP. Conclusion: The average 903 scans per year requested by the FLS was offset by an average reduction of 549 scans per year requested by patients’ GPs. There was therefore a modest overall increase of 371 scans annually (11%) following the introduction of our FLS. Our experience suggests that introducing an FLS leads to an increase of 56 annual scans per 100,000 population and suggests that with appropriate strict scanning criteria, the number of additional scans may be more modest than initially predicted. This finding may assist those areas considering introducing an FLS where there is limited access to DXA scanning.\n\nP47: A 12-Month Randomised Controlled Trial of Step and Seated Cognitive/Motor Training for Preventing Falls in Community-Dwelling Older People\n\nStephen Lord 1 and Daina Sturnieks 2\n\n1 Neuroscience Research Australia, 2 NeuRA / UNSW\n\nAims: This single blinded RCT examined the effectiveness of two exergame interventions of step (cognitive and step training) and seated (cognitive) training in preventing falls compared to a minimal-intervention (control) in community-dwelling older people. Methods: Community dwelling people aged 65+ years were randomised to one of three groups: two intervention groups involving two hours/week of home-based exergame training, either while seated (cognitive training) or standing and stepping (cognitive-motor training) for 12 months; or a control group that received a health information brochure. The primary outcome was rate of falls over 12 months. Secondary outcomes comprised proportion of fallers and physical, cognitive, psychological, health and quality of life measures. Analyses were performed according to intention-to-treat. Results: 769 participants were randomised (cognitive=262, cognitive-motor=252, control=255). Compared to control, the rate of falls was significantly reduced in the motor-cognitive training group (IRR=0.74, 95% CI = 0.56-0.98) but not in the cognitive training group (IRR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.65-1.12). Secondary analyses showed the cognitive-motor training significantly reduced the proportion of fallers, improved falls efficacy and reduced disability. The cognitive-only group training reduced the proportion of multiple fallers overall and the rate of falls in participants with a 12-month history of falls. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusion: Both the seated and step training were safely delivered in the home setting. Both interventions had benefits for fall prevention in that the cognitive-motor intervention significantly reduced the rate of falls in the primary analysis and the cognitive-only training reduced multiple falls and the rate of falls in those with a fall history.\n\nP48: Total Hip Arthroplasty Leads to Better Results After Low-Energy Displaced Femoral Neck Fracture in Patients Aged 55 to 70 Years\n\nStefan Bartels 1 , Torbjørn Berge Kristensen 2 , Jan-ErikGjertsen 3 , Frede Frihagen, Cecilia Rogmark 4 , Filip C.

Methods: Multicenter randomized controlled trial including all patients 55-70 years presenting with a low-energy displaced FNF at 2 Norwegian hospitals between December 2013 and December 2018. Patients were randomly allocated to undergo either IF or THA. The primary outcome was the Harris Hip Score (HHS) at 12 months postoperatively. Secondary outcomes were HHS at 4 and 24 months postoperatively, and Oxford Hip Score (OHS), Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS), health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-3L index score and EQ-VAS), VAS for pain, and VAS for patient satisfaction at 4, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. The primary analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Results: 102 patients (mean age 63.7 years) were allocated to IF (51) and THA (51). The mean difference in primary outcome HHS at 12 months was 5.3, 95% CI 0.8-9.8, P = 0.021. Patients treated with THA had significantly higher HHS at 4 and 12 months, better OHS at 4 and 12 months, better HOOS at 4, 12, and 24 months, reported better health-related quality of life after 4 months, were more satisfied, and reported less pain after 4 and 12 months compared to patients treated with IF. Major reoperations occurred in 26 patients (51%) after IF and 2 patients (4%) after THA. Conclusions: Patients 55-70 years old with low-energy displaced FNF benefit from treatment with THA rather than IF.\n\nP49: Cognitive Impairment Influences the Risk of Reoperation After Hip Fracture Surgery: Results of 87,573 Operations Reported to the Norwegian Hip Fracture Register\n\nMalfrid Kristoffersen 1 , Eva Dybvik 1 , Ole Martin Steihaug 2"
