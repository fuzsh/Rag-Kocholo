My appa was driving and listening to news of the singer’s death on the radio. From the back seat of our family station wagon and through the rearview mirror, I could see that he was crying. What I did not know then is in part what I am trying to understand now—how so much was bound up in my father’s love for Elvis. From the first time he heard “Love Me Tender” on Armed Forces Radio Korea to the concert he attended in Phoenix, Arizona, where Elvis was the “size of an ant” given his distance from the stage, Elvis connected his childhood in Korea with his adult life in America in subtle yet profound ways. That my father came to the United States in 1969 with America in his heart signaled a relationship many years in the making, one that had deep and deeply complicated roots in Korea. A second-generation Korean American, I did not live through the Korean War, but I am tied to the migration of peoples who moved because of it. Ji-Yeon Yuh importantly argues that nearly all Korean migration since 1950 links back to that war, if not immediately as in the case of adoptees, then to the trauma left in its wake. My parents were what Yuh refers to as “refuge migrants,” a group “motivated by a deep psychological need to leave behind chaos, and insecurity, and trauma . . . [who] seek out emotional/mental peace and a stable environment.”1 Growing up, I avoided asking my parents about the war because I was afraid of what I might hear and of the pain that I could cause by asking them to remember. This may have been why they themselves waited until I was in college to begin sharing their experiences. Once they started recounting the war, the stories steadily unfolded: My father recalled the time he spent as a young boy on US bases, where American soldiers gave him chewing gum, chocolate bars, and weathered copies of Life and Look. My mother told me how North Korean soldiers dragged her father from their home as she watched from a hiding place above the rafters and how the men returned for her older sister, neither of whom she would ever see again. xiii\n\nxiv |\n\nPreface\n\nShe spoke of her mother, who placed her two youngest siblings in a local orphanage not for the purpose of adoption, but because it was the only place where they were guaranteed a meal. As I listened to these stories, I realized that their memories of the war were sharp and the wounds fresh. They are but two of millions of survivors for whom the war remains what Chungmoo Choi describes as a “deep scar” that has shaped the very fabric of who they are, and has come to complicate their place in the United States and their relationship to a Korea forever changed by US military, political, and economic intervention.2 Their experiences prompted my interest in writing a social history of the Korean War. Military and political histories describe the events of the war, but few center on what happened to Korean civilians. As I began searching through pamphlets, guides, government and missionary records, as well as an array of cultural sources including magazines like Life and the Saturday Evening Post, one figure consistently appeared across all of them—the Korean child. The statistics that marked children’s needs, protocols to manage their health, and photographs that placed them in the company of Americans who gave them candy, clothes, prosthetics, and Bibles raised questions about the place of children in, and their centrality to, US-South Korea relations. As I continued with my research, I saw that the history of Korean children was also about Korean women, the hidden half of the story. These two figures came to anchor the project for what they revealed about US power in South Korea during and after the war, and for how they exposed the intimate fallout of US empire, which landed squarely on the shoulders of Korea’s most vulnerable populations. At the start of this project, I contacted adoptees who came to the United States immediately following the war and were now mostly in their sixties. Among the responses that I received was one who said that her story was American through and through and another who stated that he did not wish to open past wounds. One response came as a phone call from the spouse of an adoptee. She saw my letter and wanted to explain why I would likely not hear from her husband, who was adopted at the age of three. She relayed that he rarely talked about his life growing up as a Korean adoptee in an East Coast suburb because it brought back painful memories. These responses made\n\nPreface\n\n|\n\nxv\n\nme think about the years of silence from my parents, especially my mother, on the topic of war. Memories are not always available, nor should they have to be, and perhaps I was not in a position to ask them to recall. That phone call changed the course of my research, though not the questions at its core. I wanted to better understand the circumstances that produced war migrants, and how it was that thousands of Korean children and women found themselves suddenly in America living with families that were foreign to them. My research took me to military, government, missionary, and welfare organizations across the United States, and to national archives, welfare agencies, and wartime orphanages in South Korea. I also looked to US and South Korean newspapers and magazines for what they could tell me about the production of Korean children and women at this time. The photographs that appeared in public media told stories that were vastly different from the private records kept in administrative files, a disjuncture between visibility and erasure shared across projects of empire. These wide-ranging sources helped me piece together a fragmented history that has been excised from the national memories of both the United States and Korea. In this book, I try to see those who were lost in one of America’s many “forgotten wars.” In the flashes when they appeared in US media as Korean children loved by American parents and brides adored by US servicemen, perspective radically altered the story that was being told. Americans who looked at these images saw hopeful beginnings; yet for the Korean children and women pictured, their arrival to the United States also meant their departure from Korea—a migration sparked not by the American Dream, but by the nightmare of war. Note on Language\n\nFor Korean names, I list the family name first followed by the given name in accordance with Korean conventions, except for commonly used English transliterations, like Syngman Rhee. For individuals in the public record, I use their names as they appear in print. To protect the identities of children, women, and adoptive parents whose records are private, I use an initial instead of their names. Nearly all of the interviews were conducted in Korean, for which I provide the English\n\nxvi\n\n|\n\nPreface\n\ntranslations. For the transliteration of Korean to English, I follow the McCune-Reischauer system. When describing geographic spaces and political divisions, I use “North Korea” and “South Korea.” However, when referring to people from South Korea, I use “Korean,” since this is how they would have viewed themselves, as part of one Korea.\n\nIntroduction Cold War Empire\n\nIn November 1953, Life magazine introduced readers to a “new American,” three-year-old Lee Kyung Soo.1 In the leading photograph, readers saw the Korean boy wearing a tailored US Navy uniform to match that of his adoptive father, US Navy boatswain Vincent Paladino (figure I.1). Paladino and a group of reporters ushered the child toward the camera and into America. The tall men may have dwarfed the boy, but Lee remained center stage. For some viewers, his steady gait and military uniform gestured toward the resolve of Lee and fellow Koreans in their fight against communism. Still others may have seen in the boy’s downturned gaze, hands thrust deep in his pockets, the emotions of a child who had recently lost his parents in the war and now found himself far from Korea. Regardless of how Life readers interpreted the story, all eyes were trained on “little Lee,” whose first steps on US soil opened a new chapter in US-South Korea relations and repositioned America’s place in the world more broadly. Lee’s story reached American audiences five months after delegates from the United Nations, North Korea, and China signed an armistice to suspend fighting in the Korean peninsula. The 1953 agreement brought an end to the air, land, and sea assaults that claimed over thirty-six thousand American, one million Chinese, and an estimated three to four million Korean lives.2 The Korean War ended in a stalemate; the country remained divided along the 38th parallel and communists maintained a hold of the North. In this context, little Lee carried with him the political weight of nations. He was what the United States purportedly fought for—Korea’s future democracy—and what South Korea was presumed to be—an ally of the United States. Placing a small orphan under the care of a US serviceman helped to cushion the blow of the costly war. Given the scarcity of and barriers to overseas adoptions at this time, the story was less an advertisement for adoption than a geopolitical script.3 1\n\n2 | Introduction\n\nFigure I.1.

Here, the United States was the father to South Korea, the latter a child who was innocent, vulnerable, and in need of US protection. The article about Lee in Life welcomed continued US intervention, while eclipsing the US military’s role in the recent violence that orphaned Lee and others like him. The curated story privileged US perspectives over Korean ones, helping to position the United States as a benevolent superpower in a global landscape dramatically changed after World War II. In addition to introducing the international dimensions of US-South Korea relations, this story also edified Americans with domestic Cold War\n\nIntroduction\n\n| 3\n\nlessons. The next four pages of the article chronicled Lee’s first days in the United States. Photographers captured the boy playing with a reporter’s microphone, enjoying his first “too cold” ice cream cone, and pointing toy pistols. In the article’s closing shot, a stoic Paladino, dressed in a suit with patches that marked his heroism, carried a gleeful Lee, who wore his new “favorite dress,” a cowboy outfit (figure I.2). Using his adoptive father’s hand as a saddle, Lee symbolized a new kind of American staking claim to the West. Visions of the interracial father-son duo at home in a cosmopolitan city replete with broad sidewalks and shiny cars overflowed with Cold War sentiment. The photograph suggested that Americans cared about their Korean neighbors, even enough to make them family.\n\nFigure I.2.

In one fell swoop, he embodied democratic visions of internationalism, racial harmony, and happiness bound up in consumer capitalism. When millions of Life magazine readers first met Lee in 1953, it must have been curious for them to see a Korean child in the United States, especially in the context of kin.4 The population of Koreans living in the United States remained relatively small, at around eight thousand (with an estimated seven thousand in Hawai‘i and less than a thousand in California), and existing immigration laws continued to restrict their entry.5 The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1924 banned the entry of aliens ineligible to citizenship. Since the Naturalization Act of 1790 excluded people of Asian descent, Koreans could not enter the United States. While the McCarran-Walter Act of 1952 ended Asian exclusion, it continued the national origins quota system, which limited the number of visas allotted to each Asian country to around a hundred per year.6 At this time, most Americans knew little about Koreans save for wartime images that pictured them frail and far away. After the war, however, Americans would become increasingly familiar with Koreans on US soil in ways both imagined and real. Korean children flashed up suddenly and with great fanfare in magazines, on television, and in auditoriums across the country. In these public displays, Americans witnessed Koreans singing Christmas jingles, eating hot dogs, watching television, and doing other “American” things. The hypervisibility of Korean children made political sense. Their age and the attendant scripts of assimilation made them ideal representatives of US-South Korea relations. Alongside media representations came the actual arrival of Korean children and women. Between 1953 and 1965, over 6,000 Korean and mixed-race adoptees and an estimated 7,700 Korean military brides immigrated to the United States, more than doubling the existing Korean population.7 Their immigration was first made possible through individual acts of Congress and temporary legislation that circumnavigated existing restrictive immigration laws. They arrived as the sons, daughters, and wives of predominantly white American families. Since their ability to immigrate to the United States was predicated upon their adoption by or marriage to an American, the moment that they set foot in the United States they transgressed the racial boundaries of one of the most fiercely\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n5\n\nprotected spaces—the white nuclear family home. While mainstream media may have celebrated the arrival of Korean adoptees, they often evaded and at times fully eclipsed the arrival of Korean military brides, the latter complicated by their age, gender, and assumed connection with prostitution. Whether celebrated or hidden, tensions surrounded these newly arrived immigrants who formed interracial families that embodied Cold War internationalism in practice, not theory. How did Korean children and women come to the United States in the 1950s and 1960s ahead of the 1965 Immigration Act, which opened immigration from Asia more broadly? How was it that they arrived as ready-made members of predominantly white families during a time of continued Jim Crow in the South and amidst visibly heightened struggles for racial equality nationally? How was this immigrant group intimately tied to US actions and interests in South Korea, relations that intensified as a result of the Korean War? In addressing these questions, this book traces how Korean children and women became crucial to the transnational making of American empire in the early Cold War. The study centers upon US interactions with and policies surrounding Korean children and women during the war and the recovery period that followed.8 Though historical accounts have left Korean children and women as the largely forgotten population of a forgotten war, they were essential to the work of the US military, government, and private sector in ways that both enabled American power and forced its unraveling. At the heart of these processes was the US militarized production of the Korean orphan, GI baby, adoptee, birth mother, prostitute, and bride.9 These strained and unstable embodiments emerged as a result of US geopolitical needs during the Cold War that brought Americans into Korea and Koreans into the United States, intimate crossings that defined, and at times defied, American empire in the postwar Pacific.\n\nChildren of American Empire American empire had its beginnings well over a century before the United States divided and occupied the Korean peninsula. The transatlantic slave trade, the Louisiana Purchase and forced removal of Native Americans, the US annexation of Texas in 1845, the Mexican War of 1848, and territorial expansion to the Southwest evidenced the\n\n6\n\n| Introduction\n\nimperialist impulses that drove US expansionism. Jodi A. Byrd reminds readers that it is through the study of American Indians and other indigenous peoples that US empire became possible at all.10 This history acts as a reminder that US imperialism was well underway domestically prior to 1898, at which point the United States reached across the Pacific to annex Hawai‘i and the Philippines, and expand its territories to Cuba, Guam, Puerto Rico, and Samoa. The material benefits of American empire came in the form of new markets for the feared overproduction of American goods, military outposts and stepping stones across the Pacific toward the fabled China market, and imported natural resources, like rubber, coffee, and sugar. US expansion also served ideological needs. It opened up new frontiers beyond the purportedly closed West, enabling Americans to fulfill their Manifest Destiny. It made robust adventurers out of men, helping to reaffirm a white masculinity destabilized by mechanized industrialization.11 US expansion to the Pacific helped America redefine itself at a moment when the changes wrought by rapid industrialization and the massive influx of immigrants needed to fuel it required Americans to look forward to a postindustrial future rather than nostalgically hold on to a pastoral (and for Southerners, antebellum) past. For all of its benefits, material and otherwise, US expansion to the Pacific posed a domestic problem. Anti-expansionists warned that the doors of imperialism would swing both ways, and that soon the inhabitants of its newest territories would seek entry into the United States. Vociferous nativist and union organizer Samuel Gompers predicted that US expansion would result in “an inundation of Mongolians” flooding the mainland to take the jobs of white laborers.12 A slew of American “experts” used science to back claims that expansion threatened the health of the nation. Eugenicist Herbert Spencer asserted that US subjects in the Pacific embodied “the minds of children and the passion of adults,” a deviant combination that could threaten the Victorian order of things should they be granted entry.13 Images of swarthy subjects from the far-off Pacific making their way to the United States circulated in the popular press. In January 1899, the political satire magazine Puck included as its centerfold a cartoon titled “School Begins” (figure I.3). A large Uncle Sam leaned over his desk to give the children seated in the first row, “Cuba, Porto Rico [sic], Hawaii,\n\nFigure I.3. Children of recent US territories come to school in the United States. “School Begins,” Puck, January 25, 1899. Courtesy of Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division, call no.

The unruly and visibly foreign children were juxtaposed against the well-behaved students seated behind them. Holding books labeled California, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and Alaska, these children sat upright at their desks, the girls with their hair neatly tied back, the boys dressed in pressed blue uniforms, all reading quietly. They had become model citizens of the republic in the decades since their annexation. There were others in and around the classroom who were unlike the rest. The African American man cleaning the windows, the Native American male sitting alone in the back of the room, and a Chinese boy peeking in through the door represented those who had been in the United States for some time, but lay permanently outside the American polity. The African American individual was relegated to servitude, the Native subject with his upside-down reader was summarily dismissed, while the Chinese figure, standing outside with his queue blowing in the wind, was excluded from the classroom altogether. Here and in other images circulating at this time, subjects of US territories were placed in relation to nonwhite peoples at home, a slotting of imperial subjects into an existing domestic racial order that placed whites firmly at the top.14 The cartoon relayed the current dilemma of America’s foray into the Pacific in these racialized terms. Would America’s most recent imperial subjects go the way of the three children arrested in progress due to their race? Puck readers were left to wonder whether or not the visibly impetuous children of the Pacific would be able to follow in the footsteps of the annexed class that came before them. It made sense to work out the tensions of empire via children. Distanced from labor or sex, the baggage of adult subjects, children provided a purportedly less complicated slate upon which to ponder the problems and possibilities of empire. The narratives that they conveyed shifted with the needs of the state. For domestic imperialisms, assimilative scripts helped to manage subjects already within US borders. For example, Laura Wexler shows how administrators at the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute in the late nineteenth century used\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n9\n\nphotographs to prove the merits of their boarding school for Native American and African American children. A “before” photograph of three Native American girls on their first day at school, wrapped in blankets and sitting on the floor, was juxtaposed against an “after” shot of the same children a year later, two sitting upright in chairs playing checkers, all three with their braids shorn and dressed in pinafores.15 Staged productions like these were useful to promote the school and green-light intervention, but also important for how they made Native Americans, for whom North America was already home, into good and useful US subjects. These assimilative scripts did not usually apply to imperial charges who lived outside the mainland United States. During US expansion at the turn of the twentieth century, imagining people of the Pacific as children permitted a familiar brand of paternalism used to justify intervention and dominance, yet these children seemed particularly resistant to US governance. Indeed, as shown in the Puck cartoon, they appeared to repel civilizing efforts, thus supporting nativist appeals to keep them out. Imperial wards of the Pacific were added to an existing list of Asian undesirables, a project with legal beginnings in the 1875 Page Act, which barred the entry of Chinese contract laborers, felons, and women for the purpose of prostitution, language that marked Chinese bodies as both dangerous and immoral. The series of restrictive Asian immigration laws that followed culminated in the 1924 Immigration and Nationality Act, which prohibited the entry of nearly all peoples from Asia. Filipinos were the only exception, a direct—and, for nativists, unwelcome—outcome of American empire. As US subjects, they could not be denied entry, though forcing them into low-wage agricultural labor and other needed fields of employment ensured the unequal conditions of their immigration.16 Thus, while US expansion to the Pacific benefitted the economic, military, and political growth of the nation, it also foiled America’s gatekeeping efforts. At the end of the nineteenth century, American empire resulted in an immigration breach—a problem that would arise again fifty years later when the United States occupied South Korea. In 1945 Korea was at once liberated, divided, and reoccupied. With Japan’s defeat in World War II and its subsequent loss of imperial holdings in Asia, Koreans, who had been under Japanese rule since 1910, were eager to establish their sovereignty. However, before they could\n\n10\n\n|\n\nIntroduction\n\nenact plans for independence, the United States and the Soviet Union intervened. On the evening of August 10, 1945, the day after the United States dropped a second atomic bomb in Japan, the State-War-Navy Coordinating Committee asked Dean Rusk and Charles H. Bonesteel to divide the Korean peninsula. It is rumored that the young US colonels spent less than thirty minutes deciding upon the 38th parallel, a then invisible line that would cleave a division so deep and permanent that the chasm can now be seen from space.17 Between 1945 and 1948, US occupying forces established military bases and implemented economic aid programs in the south, while the Soviet Union administered control of the north. US officials billed the military occupation of South Korea as a temporary trusteeship, a postwar measure to stabilize the region. If the Truman administration was initially unsure about the level or duration of its commitments in Korea, the war solidified its indefinite place in the peninsula, making South Korea a central location of American empire. On June 25, 1950, North Korean soldiers fired across the demilitarized zone. The United States entered the war unilaterally, committing US air and naval forces with President Truman’s verbal support, but in advance of United Nations, Pentagon, or congressional approval.18 What began as a “limited police action” turned into a full-scale war once China entered in October 1950. International audiences, particularly those from recently decolonized or decolonizing countries, watched with great concern. In 1952 Chester Bowles, American ambassador in New Delhi and close friend of the president, told Truman that America should heed its international reputation. Bowles explained, “Throughout our history we have demonstrated our consistent opposition to colonialism in any form. And yet, tragically enough, the Cold War has forced us necessarily into compromises which have laid us open to the charge, particularly here in Asia, of having changed our basic policies.” Writing from the newly independent India, he warned that Asians were “totally unable to think clearly on this subject” because Western dominance triggered an “almost automatic . . . bitter reaction to any colonial situation.”19 US administrators shared Bowles’s amnesiac view of US history, a strategic disremembering of US imperial conquests past and present. However, Bowles’s report indicated that the colonized most certainly did not forget, and saw clearly the far-reaching implications of US power in Asia as the war raged on.\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n11\n\nThe critique of Western powers came at a time of global change and reflected a rising collective Third World consciousness. The recent world war highlighted the right to self-determination and threw into question the very meaning of humanity. During World War II, America’s support of anti-fascism clashed with the continuation of Jim Crow policies and the incarceration of Japanese Americans at home, contradictions that opened the United States to critiques of its own imperial practices.20 The terrors of that war—the holocaust that exposed the unfathomable dangers of racial policies and the remarkable devastation caused by atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki—required a meaningful reconfiguration of power in its wake. Between 1945 and 1960, forty countries that together accounted for more than a quarter of the world’s population revolted against colonizers and gained their independence.21 Radical shifts in the years following World War II resulted from and intertwined with the growing pressures of the Cold War, forcing the United States to navigate its newfound power under increased global scrutiny. This proved difficult given the scale of the Korean War and America’s use of force to fight it. By the war’s end, the US military had dropped 635,000 tons of bombs in a peninsula the size of Minnesota and utilized new devastating technologies, like napalm, to rout out guerrilla fighters.22 When the armistice was signed in July 1953, more than half of the Korean population had been killed, wounded, or permanently separated from their families. From the outside looking in, US actions deeply challenged American claims that it had liberated Korea from Japanese oppression, exhibiting instead imperial imposition at its worst.23 Amidst global pressures, US war violence needed a corrective antidote. The child, once again, offered a useful location through which to navigate and also narrate US intentions in Asia. Sharon Stephens has urged us not to view childhood as universal but rather as contested sites that operate differently across time to meet specific political needs. She has used critical approaches to childhood to reveal how the state utilized children for global disciplining and moralizing purposes.24 Paternalism continued to underwrite scripts of US intervention as it had at the turn of the century, but because of the circumstances of the Korean War and the emergent needs of the Cold War, rather than being kept at a distance, Korean children were placed in intimate proximity with Americans.\n\n12\n\n|\n\nIntroduction\n\nDuring the war, news of entire battalions “adopting” Korean mascots, and, after the war, visions of model Korean children happy in their new American homes brought Americans together with Asians in ways not seen before. Fifty years on from the first episode of US territorial expansion to the Pacific, empire’s children were no longer unruly, but were now deserving objects of rescue. What explained the transformation from the impetuous child with dangerous adult-like inflexibility to the innocent, malleable, and Americanizing child? What accounted for the shift in responsibility for empire’s wards from the authoritative figure of the teacher to the tender care of Americans who played parents to Korean children? How did popular constructions of imperial wards move from the undesirable savage “over there” to the rapidly assimilating Korean child at home in America? The shift from the incorrigible child-subject in 1898 to the adoptable son or daughter after 1953 was significant. It signaled the importance of the optics needed to make it appear as though the United States was not an imperialist power, a task made difficult by the facts of the war itself and the extent of US military, economic, and political embroilments in South Korea afterwards. Placing Americans with Korean children in the context of family produced the right kind of Cold War script, one that configured US-South Korean relations in the framework of care and kin, not violence and force.25 These representations also came with new ways for Americans to participate in a transnational project. No longer on the sidelines waiting to see how US expansion would affect the national polity, as was the case at the turn of the century, average Americans were given ample opportunities to take part in Korea by extending familiar domestic roles across the Pacific.\n\nGlobal Family Frames After World War II, constructions of the American family reordered the domestic realm, providing an anchor for the nation in uncertain times. As Elaine Tyler May and others have shown, the American family took on new meaning after World War II, when public policy, government legislation, and popular culture converged to make the heteronormative, middle-class white family a prime location of US national security. These structures helped to stabilize gender norms disrupted by World War II;\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n13\n\nas Rosie the Riveter was expected to return home to fulfill the important duty of wife and mother, men were to reclaim their place as breadwinners at the head of the family. The family offered additional reassurances during a time of nuclear threat. May reveals how the danger of the bomb converged with representations of the titillating but volatile independent woman, each a peril that could be contained through marriage, a family, and its capitalist companion—a suburban home filled with appliances and other mass-produced goods.26 Constructions of the family that solved domestic problems also proved portable abroad, making them effective ways to grapple with the international challenges of the Atomic Age. After the US military deployed atomic bombs, Americans had to contend with the guilt and global ramifications of its nuclear capabilities. Norman Cousins, editor of the Saturday Review, offered one response in his highly publicized Hiroshima Maidens Project. In 1948 he brought twenty-five Japanese women disfigured by the bombs to the United States for reconstructive surgery by American doctors. During the yearlong project, Cousins asked donors to imagine themselves as part of a single global family reaching out to help those whom they may have never met, but toward whom they felt “love” and a sense of “duty.”27 While the “maidens” were at the heart of this effort, the project said as much if not more about Americans who repaired the damage wrought by bombs that Americans also produced and deployed. The Western features given the Japanese women—ones for which they were maligned when they returned to Japan—signaled the extent to which Americans did not always recognize the US-centric parameters of their actions even in the midst of helping others.28 Edward Steichen, the director of photography at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, organized two exhibits hoping to promote similar ideas of global understanding. His 1951 show Korea—The Impact of War in Photographs included close-up images of US servicemen and Korean civilians, as well as of bombs and the evacuation of Korean children. The conflicting images of humanity amidst violence from a war still underway complicated Steichen’s intended message. He found greater success in his 1955 exhibition of 503 family portraits from sixty-eight countries, The Family of Man. In the first fifteen weeks, the show drew 270,000 visitors, who could see themselves reflected in the portraits from around\n\n14\n\n|\n\nIntroduction\n\nthe world. Even dark-skinned, impoverished “Third World” families registered as recognizable when positioned in a family frame that included grandparents, parents, children, and grandchildren. Marianne Hirsch describes how these intimately familiar juxtapositions helped to “transform a global space of vast differences and competing interests into a domestic space structured by likeness and specularity.”29 During the Cold War, family frames were symbolic, aspirational, and illusory representations that prescribed for Americans everything from how to behave at home to how they should see themselves in relation to the world. Imagined family frames, with children anchored at the center, proved particularly useful when it came to navigating US involvement in Korea. Visions of the US-Korean family were evoked to support the geopolitical needs of the United States as it made its debut as a superpower after World War II. Part 1 of this book describes how these intimate relationships were first introduced during and immediately following the war. US media figured American servicemen as surrogate fathers who fed, clothed, and sheltered orphaned children of war, while US aid campaigns asked Americans at home to take up a similar parental role through donations for Korean children. These constructions helped to reframe the unpopular war as a rescue mission in which the United States saved innocent children from the clutches of communism. Also during the war, news of the first Korean war brides reached American audiences, furthering familial scripts of love that knew no bounds. Together, these family frames served important state functions. For international audiences, they helped allay accusations of US imperialism. For Americans, they offered a lens through which to understand why US soldiers fought and died for Asian others thousands of miles away. The scripts also altered existing postwar conceptions of the global family. More than suggesting a broad imagined kinship with international others, narratives that emerged from Korea asked Americans to see Koreans as an intimate part of their own family. After the war, transnational family frames served as the ideological foundation upon which nongovernmental US actors created paths to the actual formation of US-Korean families. Part 2 of this book considers what happened when hundreds of American missionaries, doctors, nurses, philanthropists, and social workers entered South Korea to spearhead postwar recovery efforts. The estimated 100,000 children\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n15\n\nleft homeless by the war became the primary focus of their work. As in other colonial contexts, populations deemed in-need justified access. In US postwar aid campaigns, the children were no longer under the protection of American soldiers and instead appeared heartbreakingly alone, the latter a construction that asked American citizens to intervene.30 Missionaries and philanthropists asked Americans to rescue the children through their sponsorship and donations, which Americans readily did, sending supplies and millions of dollars. Postwar aid campaigns effectively shifted the responsibility for Korea’s children from US servicemen in South Korea to a wide range of Americans in the United States. The change expanded the emotional and material connections between Americans at home and the children of South Korea, while the structure of family frames engendered the participation of American women specifically. While white men headed up major US aid organizations in postwar South Korea, daily operations were carried out primarily by women. The geopolitical needs of the Cold War converged with the destruction of the Korean War to create opportunities for white women to implement their domestic expertise abroad. Their presumed innate ability to mother became a tool of Cold War internationalism, opening up prospects for travel and influence.31 In South Korea, American women administered care and carried out the day-to-day functions of hundreds of US-operated orphanages. And when it came to adoptions, American women assessed the children, kept track of the medical records, visa applications, and reports needed to process them, and taught Koreans how to do this work. They arrived armed with Western lessons on childcare, nutrition, hygiene, and the Bible. Even American women who remained home in the United States could participate in the international project of rescue by donating money and needed supplies such as powdered milk. When missionary organizations and prominent adoption proponents presented their American constituents the option to enact the ultimate form of rescue by bringing Korean children into their homes, thousands of women filled out applications, placed their names on waiting lists, and prepared their homes for the arrival of a Korean child.32 Their reasons for adoption were varied and overlapped, from resolving issues of infertility to enacting Christian duty. Yet most Americans who adopted Korean children understood their actions in clear Cold War\n\n16\n\n|\n\nIntroduction\n\nterms—by creating international and interracial families, they worked to secure democracy in domestic and now also global ways. In the end, the wide-reaching public relations effort that figured Koreans as part of the American family coupled with the “remarkable mobilization of [US] voluntary child welfare agencies” made it impossible for the US government to deny the formation of US-Korean families.33 In 1961 US policy makers reluctantly established permanent adoption legislation. This law, coupled with the amended War Brides Act of 1947, which permitted the entry of Korean brides, resulted in the formation of close to fourteen thousand US-Korean families between 1953 and 1965. These families marked a turning point in American empire. The war, Cold War geopolitics, and internationalist Americans converged to make South Korea the logical, if unintended, location for the production of international and interracial families. The unprecedented scale and publicness of these integrated families challenged long-standing segregationist policies in the United States. Because their arrival destabilized the white nuclear family norm, Korean children and women had to be managed and made safe for immigration. This US project of transformation had its beginnings in South Korea. Institutional processes assured that Koreans were made good American subjects prior to their arrival. In US missionary-run orphanages, Americans taught children lessons in godliness and cleanliness; and in United Service Organization (USO) brides schools, Korean women learned how to cook American meals and sew American fashions. This transnational project with white Americans at the helm had a dual purpose. For Korean women and children who remained in South Korea, the democratizing project made Koreans productive, Christian, and manageable subjects. For those who came to the United States, these lessons helped to make them an acceptable immigrant, a docile and unthreatening addition to the nation who in behavior, if not appearance, left existing constructions of the American family intact. When Korean adoptees and brides came to the United States, they landed upon an Orientalist stage not of their own making. Upon arrival, they were placed into an existing hierarchy that envisioned the West as powerful and civilized, in contrast to a feminized, exoticized, and sexualized East.34 While Orientalist constructions historically lumped Asians together, the US racial state also differentiated Asians from one another\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n17\n\nto meet changing domestic and foreign policy needs. Some of the most dramatic shifts occurred during and after World War II. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941, the need to differentiate between Japanese enemies and Chinese allies became a matter of national security.35 After the war, when the United States occupied a defeated Japan, the Japanese had to be transformed from threatening enemy to democratic ally almost overnight.36 It was in this context that reporters and scholars honed in on Japanese Americans’ economic and educational success following their wartime incarceration to evidence their model behavior. The characterization failed to consider the few choices Japanese Americans had outside of resettlement programs aimed at assimilation, not to mention the silencing effects of fear and trauma.37 The model minority myth that was applied to postwar Japanese American families was soon extended to other Asian American groups. Chinese American adherence to middle-class nuclear family ideals in the 1950s also supported model minority scripts.38 The myth was further advanced in popular culture, as in the 1958 musical Flower Drum Song, wherein Asian actors performed the Asian American family for the masses—singing and dancing their assimilation while maintaining an exotic Orientalist flair that made them worth watching. Korean War immigrants arrived within this cultural milieu, but the circumstances of their immigration both advanced and altered postwar scripts of the Asian model minority. Narratives circulating around Korean adoptees and brides figured them as distinct immigrants who were already well on their way to becoming American. Like model Asian Americans, they too were part of a normative family—only theirs was interracial and they were foreign-born. The possible threat that their arrival posed to the protected realm of the white nuclear family was simultaneously solved by those same family frames. In the case of adoptees, placement within and under the care of predominantly white, Christian American couples made them appear to be pliable immigrants. Korean military brides, on the rare occasions that they appeared in US media, arrived apparently well-versed in American ways, while still fitting gendered Orientalist expectations of the lotus blossom. As children and wives, Koreans became additive to the core foundation of the white nuclear family. They were subsumed into the private space of the American home under the tutelage of white parents or husbands. The circumstances\n\n18\n\n|\n\nIntroduction\n\nof their arrival contributed to their disappearance. They lived in scattered locations in suburbs along the East and West Coasts and in rural towns across the Midwest, separated from one another as well as from Asian American communities. Placed in predominantly white neighborhoods, Korean War immigrants were left few options outside of assimilation. Media constructions that applauded their rapid Americanization brought them closer to honorary whiteness, while the private family home served to contain their lingering differences. With the majority of decolonized countries inhabited by nonwhite peoples, the United States needed to convince international audiences that it had resolved deep-rooted racial inequality, a difficult task given ongoing segregation at home. News of violence that reached international audiences marred American claims to democracy. As Thomas Borstelmann, Mary Dudziak, and Penny Von Eschen have described, African American civil rights activists leveraged the Cold War needs of the United States to force their government to make changes at home.39 The US government came to see civil rights as integral to its foreign policy needs, but looked primarily to symbolic rather than substantive solutions to racial inequality. In this context, newly formed US-Korean families helped to bolster US claims of racial pluralism with minimal actual change. Their integration did not disrupt the status quo since it left white Americans, in this case adoptive parents and military husbands, in positions of power and placed the onus upon Korean children and women to fit themselves into an expected white, middle-class ideal. Still, and conveniently, these Cold War families gave US administrators and cultural producers a way to tout successful integration during a time of continuing racial strife. Rather than highlight the tenaciousness with which the US military and US policy makers tried to keep Americans from adopting or marrying Koreans, once these families were formed, they were harnessed to exemplify a liberal modernity.40 The assembling of families across racial difference and geographic distance was framed not as an immigration problem, but rather as a technology that evidenced the power of American domesticity, a worldliness on the most intimate scale. In the context of the Cold War, Korean adoptees and brides became commodities in service to the post–World War II construction of benevolent US power. Stories of model Korean children and rapidly adjusting Korean brides,\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n19\n\nand the white American families that loved them, relayed ideal visions of racial democracy and internationalism, making these families another useful node in America’s cultural Cold War efforts.41 They also adhered to a very specific kind of integration, where, soon after the public fanfare surrounding their initial arrival, Korean children and women quite literally disappeared into the private space of the home. More absorbed than accepted, Koreans modeled for nonwhite others at home and abroad the parameters of a universal freedom that upheld middle-class white Americans as the standard bearers of democracy.42 Just beyond media representations that celebrated the supposed ease with which white American families crossed racial, cultural, biological, and national divides were the necessary erasures that revealed the limits of racial liberalism. To begin, media constructions highlighted primarily one kind of international family: “full” Korean adoptees in white American homes. Mixed-race children and military brides remained in the shadows of this internationalist narrative, even though they together made up 85 percent of all Korean immigrants at this time.43 When it came to mixed-race children, US administrators in South Korea and the United States upheld existing black-white boundaries. Social workers in the United States placed those deemed part-white with white American couples and part-black with African American couples. The flexibility and modelness of Koreans did not apply to those who were half-black, the latter whom some welfare workers actively tried to keep out of the United States, arguing that local African American children should be adopted first before bringing in black bodies from afar.44 For military brides, the 71,043 US servicemen still stationed in South Korea in 1957, years after the unsuccessful war, meant the continuation of military marriages.45 No longer a novelty of war, the Korean bride signaled an ongoing problem of Korean immigration. For all its claims to liberalism, the United States tried to control which Koreans could enter and who was denied, as well as how those who did arrive were made to adhere to assimilative scripts that furthered state aims. Behind generative constructions of the US-Korean family, there existed populations that were pushed permanently outside of Cold War family frames. Part 3 of this book centers upon those who necessarily had to remain unseen in order to sustain scripts of the US-Korean family. Korean prostitutes and Korean mothers of mixed-race children were\n\n20\n\n|\n\nIntroduction\n\nleft outside of the possibility of family and hence ineligible for rescue. Most remained hidden in US-established institutions in South Korea, including camptowns, segregated schools, and orphanages. Whereas the United States became the geographic location of family formation, South Korea remained a site where family was impossible, a location of persistent brokenness. The social, legal, and cultural place of Korean women and children who found themselves in the margins of both US and South Korean societies exposed the violence that lay at the heart of America’s intimate empire.\n\nAmerica’s Intimate Empire and the Cold War In this book, I use the terms “imperial” and “empire” to place US actions in Korea as part of a longer continuum of US domestic and international power. As in previous imperialist episodes, the US military occupied South Korea, while the government imposed economic and political policies to procure a democratic stronghold in Asia at the expense of Korean sovereignty. Administrators layered US imperial practices upon the existing structures of Korea’s previous colonizer, Japan. These intersecting imperialisms served as the foundation for US power in South Korea. While the primary components of imperial rule were not new, the United States reworked the cultural framework to appear non-imperial in a rapidly decolonizing world.46 US actions in South Korea were a case study in what Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana’s first post-independence president, would in 1965 coin “neo-colonialism.” Nkrumah warned that in Ghana and other African countries, independence and sovereignty were token gestures that did not in any substantive way alter the relationship between the colonial power and the colonial state. He cautioned that instruments of indirect control, such as international monetary bodies that created systems of debt and a variety of other educational and cultural nongovernmental organizations, made it more difficult to detect and resist neocolonial rule.47 In South Korea, insidious forms of rule operated through the realm of the intimate, seemingly apolitical encounters that enabled intervention while simultaneously providing cover behind which US power could operate. What makes South Korea a revealing place to study the making of US postwar power is the extent to which administrators made it up\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n21\n\nas they went along. The suddenness with which the United States entered Korea, divided it, militarily occupied it, and went to war in it—all events that occurred within five years of World War II—set the stage for America’s reactionary approach to nation-building in the postwar era. The rapidly changing political landscape of Korea, which was both caused and exacerbated by US involvement, required flexibility. Cold War pressures made it critical that the United States fight the war, while also winning hearts and minds—two projects that did not align together easily. Washington struggled to uphold liberal representations of the United States as an altruistic leader of the world. US administrators managed the dilemma with dual strategies of military force and widely publicized humanitarian aid. It was during the Korean War that these contradictory approaches first found institutional expression, actively bringing Americans together with foreign subjects as kin, in ways both imagined and real. Postcolonial scholars have explored the “intimate frontiers” of empire, cultural spaces that expose the “human dimension” of the colonial encounter.48 They have shown that rather than a supreme domination, empire is made up of many moving parts, including the quotidian practices of individuals—colonizers and the colonized—who actively shape and often confound the parameters of rule.49 Americans in South Korea did the work of the state by fighting the war and then aiding Koreans afflicted by it. The spike in Korean civilian needs after the war gave a wide range of Americans increased access to Koreans. Uneven power structures dictated these intimate day-to-day interactions, but were cloaked by scripts of care that made US power difficult to detect. The intimate scale of empire in Korea bore echoes of imperial relationships in other sites. As Laura Briggs describes, midcentury US attempts to manage the sexuality and reproduction of Puerto Rican women turned that island into a social laboratory for an array of American “experts.” Megan Vaughan illuminates how illness and disease validated the intervention of Christian missionaries in African countries; Warwick Anderson observes similar patterns among American medical officers in the Philippines.50 Vernadette Vicuña Gonzalez examines the tandem rise in and seamless merging of US militarism and tourism in Hawai‘i and the Philippines to consider how the dominance of the US military, especially upon female bodies in both of these locations, blurred the distinctions\n\n22\n\n|\n\nIntroduction\n\nbetween military and civilian life and politics; these manufactured attachments enabled and helped mitigate the historical violence of military occupation in the islands.51 Through the management of private spaces and public spaces where people were privately managed, which included orphanages, schools, churches, and hospitals, colonial authorities gained access to subject populations, imbricating US power by disseminating control in diffuse and seemingly innocuous ways.52 As they did in other sites of intimate empire, Americans used cultural scripts of rescue to validate their unfettered access to Koreans. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, US aid and Korean child welfare became synonymous. Americans quickly dominated Korea’s welfare system, a legacy that can be seen today through South Korea’s implementation of Western welfare institutions, orphanages, and the practice of transnational adoptions.53 Scripts of rescue also triggered an outpouring of support from Americans back home, who gave millions to aid Korean children, which, in turn, sustained the work of US missionary and aid organizations abroad. The remarkable scale of Americans who participated in the transnational project of rescue made the Korean case unique. Unlike in previous episodes of US imperialism, the work of nongovernmental actors in South Korea also granted hundreds of thousands of Americans at home access to Korean populations in ways both figurative and real. For those who responded to US aid campaigns by giving money, affective ties bound them to Korea’s children; and for the thousands who adopted Korean and mixed-race children, their daily interactions with sons and daughters at home in America cemented international bonds between the United States and South Korea. While the practices of US nongovernmental missionaries, social welfare workers, and philanthropists effectively furthered the needs of American empire, they were also the very reason for its unraveling. As was true in other cultural fronts of the Cold War, US administrators quickly lost a handle on Americans who had initially helped bolster its democracy-building efforts.54 Intimate and daily interactions between Americans and Koreans transgressed borders of the nation-state. When military men adopted Korean children and married Korean women, and when Americans in the United States, encouraged and facilitated by US missionaries in South Korea, brought Korean and mixed-race children into their homes, national, racial, and ideological boundar-\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n23\n\nies were crossed in ways that the US government neither intended nor desired. In the end, transnational families formed because of Cold War needs that required the United States to appear internationalist after a war in which it inflicted the bulk of the damage. It was not happenstance that the first large-scale formation of transnational, interracial families came out of Korea, the first hot war of the Cold War era, which required that the United States act on its liberal claims. Dual—and at times competing—US and South Korean nationalisms played out upon the bodies of Korean children and women. South Korea also had a stake in the successful construction of the transnational family, a cultural display of an emergent modernism. In particular, public scripts of the democracy-loving, well-behaved Korean adoptee allowed Koreans to leverage the tragic outcomes of American empire to communicate Korean cosmopolitanism and democratized futures. Korean children who went to America were figured as young ambassadors who helped to politically align the two countries. Yet behind these constructions lingered the material needs of a Korean nationalism that was fundamentally altered by US empire. As in other colonial contexts, US military, governance, and economic aid dramatically changed the parameters of sovereignty. In the case of Korea, the US government divided the peninsula and then intervened in the civil war, causing great destruction in the process. It is from this starting point at the end of the war that Koreans had to reconfigure new paths to unification and sovereignty. Before it could make plans for independence, Korea had to stabilize a population ravaged by war. In addition to having lost an estimated 17 percent of the country’s population, Koreans grappled with new kinds of subjects. From the birth of mixed-race children to the establishment of militarized prostitution, the US military had produced Koreans who could not be included in the Korean polity. The visibly mixed-race child and the “fallen” Korean woman were summarily written out of Korea’s national identity for their intimate ties to the United States. Sending these children and women to the United States as adoptees and brides supported South Korea’s nation-building efforts in the wake of American empire. The resulting erasure of these people, whether by placement into American homes or hidden away in institutions throughout South Korea, is but one example of how America’s intimate empire persists through the lives of Korea’s women and children.\n\n24\n\n|\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe public rarely saw the US structures established to manage Korean civilians. Indeed, as argued by Hannah Arendt, imperial projects worked best at the hands of an “invisible government.”55 By positioning average Americans as noble rescuers of Koreans who happened to be suffering, the US government and military could excuse themselves from culpability, past and present. Visibility and erasure worked in tandem to rewrite US actions in Korea; Korean children and women often found themselves at the center of these scripts, helping to soften the look of American empire.\n\nPiecing Together a Fragmented Past From the Fourth of July to war memorials, national memory enacts a selective remembrance, highlighting certain dimensions of the past at the expense of others.56 In labeling it a “forgotten war,” the United States has excused itself from addressing the enduring legacies of the Korean War. By placing Korean children and women at the center of this war and its aftermath, this book attempts to challenge the national memory of the United States, as well as to reinstate thousands of marginalized Koreans into the national memory of Korea. Scholars have worked to address these absences. Katherine H. S. Moon, Ji-Yeon Yuh, Grace M. Cho, and Seungsook Moon pioneered a shift in existing scholarship with their work on Korean camptowns, prostitution, and military brides. Each of these scholars privileges the perspectives of women to reveal the transnational effects of power and the inequity of these intimate exchanges, as well as unveil women’s activism and resistance in South Korea and the United States.57 Scholars have built upon their work and the groundbreaking feminist projects of Cynthia Enloe to reveal the radiating and lasting effects of US militarization upon women around the world.58 US militarized presence in South Korea, which today hovers at around 28,000, and the continued arrival of Korean military brides, who now number over 100,000 in the United States, embody the corporeal legacies of US militarization in South Korea that began with US occupation in 1945 and continues today.59 Critical adoption studies scholars place Korea at the origins of transnational adoption processes. Tobias Hübinette, Arissa Oh, Catherine Ceniza Choy, SooJin Pate, and others trace the historical beginnings\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n25\n\nof Korean transnational adoptions to the war and consider the broader politics involved in moving children across borders.60 Korean transnational adoptions have continued since the war; Eleana Kim illuminates the emergence of a collective adoptee identity, and Kim Park Nelson conducts extensive oral history interviews with Korean adoptees. Both significantly expand current understandings of transnational adoptees from the perspectives of adoptees themselves.61 Elise Prébin and Hosu Kim address the far-reaching impact of transnational adoptions upon Korean birth mothers and families, as well as adoptees in the United States, where over 150,000 Korean adoptees reside, and European countries, where an estimated 50,000 Korean adoptees currently live.62 Through oral history, documentary film, memoir, novels, and art, Korean adoptees are telling their own stories that critique the work of US and South Korean states, while offering new forms of kinship that extend beyond staid notions of family. Their interventions show the other side of public representations that tout the rapidly assimilating Korean adoptee. In her memoir, Jane Jeong Trenka explains that she tried to be the perfect daughter for fear that she would be given up again. Deann Borshay Liem, who recounts her story in the documentary First Person Plural, believed as a child that she would be able to go back to Korea if she pleased her adoptive parents.63 What these works poignantly show are the lives lived before and after adoptees became visible to the United States, ones shaped and deeply complicated by the needs of American empire. Without an understanding of the processes responsible for producing their circumstances, we cannot begin to comprehend the depth of these experiences, which combined violence and opportunity, trauma and love, loss and kinship. This study is indebted to these works, and looks to contribute to the conversation by tracing the historical and social foundations upon which these identities first emerged. Korean military brides and adoptees who came to the United States immediately following the war were unlike contemporary populations in part because they were also refugees. The conditions of their arrival were predicated upon their inability to survive in war-torn Korea, a situation made worse for children who had lost their parents in the war or were mixed-race. Critical refugee studies scholars point to the discrepancies between national narratives and lived realities that prove essential to thinking about Korean War migrants. Yên Lê Espiritu notably argues\n\n26\n\n|\n\nIntroduction\n\nthat model minority constructions of Vietnamese Americans rely upon scripts that credit the benevolence of the United States for their rescue, while simultaneously denying the reality that they were made refugees at the hands of the US military.64 Eric Tang uses the phrase “refugee exceptionalism” to describe how refuge is never found for those who had no option but to leave Cambodia. The violence of resettlement is masked by US constructions of Cambodians as the beneficiaries of American liberal freedoms.65 And Mimi Nguyen urges a closer look at liberal empire claims to the “gift of freedom” that has become the rationale for continued governance and violence.66 Like refugees of other US wars in Asia, Korean children and women became screens for American actions; it was through them that the United States could lose the war on the battlefield, yet still win the moral war by acting as their saviors. Behind the veil that served Cold War needs, Korean women were ostracized from Korean society because of their links to the US military, leaving them few options outside of emigrating; and for young Korean adoptees, the choice was often made for them. When considered in these terms, their transnational existence was not a choice. They came to occupy a space between two nations by circumstances that have set them outside of US and South Korean communities. Given the historical context of their arrival to the United States, it becomes clear that it is not enough to expand the category of “Korean American” to include adoptees and brides; instead, it is imperative that we reconfigure a belonging not bound by race, kinship, citizenship, or nation.67 This book attempts to contribute to this effort by making the after-effects of US militarization and war transparent, a historical project that lays bare how the work of governments, militaries, and institutions came to intimately affect the lives of thousands of children and women on both sides of the Pacific. In this book, I search across a range of sources to find the perspectives and processes that were made to go missing from national narratives. Utilizing approaches from postcolonial studies, ethnic studies, and social and cultural history, this book casts a wide net to examine disparate sources that when placed together help suture a fragmented past. To understand the inner workings of American empire and to see how Korean children and women were central to these operations in ways that were both intended and unintended, I looked to the places where they appeared—in US and South Korean government documents\n\nIntroduction\n\n| 27\n\nand military correspondence; missionary, philanthropic aid organization, social welfare, and orphanage records; US and South Korean newspapers and media; and photographs intended for public consumption and those used privately for administrative purposes. When brought together, these sources reveal the anxieties, violence, trauma, and care that circulated through America’s intimate empire in South Korea. Many of the sources that contain information about Korea’s women and children were produced and used by those in power. US and South Korean discussions about what to do about Korean orphans, prostitutes, and especially mixed-race GI babies cropped up across both state archives from military records to reports on public health. I read these documents alongside and against the grain. Ann Laura Stoler argues that colonial administrative records are ones of “uncertainty and doubt,” reflecting “anxious efforts to ‘catch up’ with what was emergent and ‘becoming’ in new colonial situations.”68 US and South Korean military and government records are revealing for what they tell us about state intentions, as well as the state’s response to circumstances that it neither planned for nor wanted. When it came to the interpersonal bonds that had formed between Americans and Koreans, the documents reveal the excesses of intimate empire that threatened to unravel imperial aims, ones that US administrators were forced to address and scrambled to manage, but could never fully control. The records of US missionaries and American social workers demonstrate how individuals put the ideals of internationalism into practice, efforts that the US government condoned at first but later tried to curtail when they tried to bring Koreans into the United States. Their correspondence reflects a mix of state, proselytizing, and professionalizing goals alongside care and aid that came to characterize America’s postwar presence in South Korea and ultimately caused empire’s return. While state and institutional records explain what happened to Koreans and why, it is in the gaps and silences that we can begin to imagine the experiences of Korean children and women. In administrator records, when we see notes that “pictures mean a great deal to our mothers who have given up their [mixed-race] children” or mentions of a child who cries less frequently, these are signs of trauma, not adjustment.69 To layer on top of these revelatory moments in the archives, this book looks across a variety of cultural sources that narrated Korean children\n\n28\n\n|\n\nIntroduction\n\nand women for US and South Korean publics. In imperial contexts, representation is key to navigating control, producing identities of colonizer and colonized, and furthering what Mary Louise Pratt has described as anti-conquest narratives, strategies of innocence used to assert dominance.70 Amy Kaplan has importantly shown that in colonial encounters, stereotypes do not simply impose hierarchies between the civilized and the savage, but become themselves unstable sites of ambivalence that “distort and challenge the bedrock divisions on which they are founded.”71 Time and again, representations of Korean children and women produced inconsistencies and breaks. Media productions of Americanized Korean adoptees or brides were riddled with expressions that betrayed their internationalist intentions. Staged photographs could not always contain the strains of the immigrants’ new existence in the United States or the pain of their recent past and uncertainty of their future. For what they can reveal in the absence of written records, I turn to published and unpublished photographs to find what LaKisha Michelle Simmons describes as the “spaces of dynamic encounter.”72 Photographs, even the ones produced to serve US nation-building efforts, revealed the subjectivity of Korean children and women. By reading what is visible to imagine what is not, we can come to understand Korean and Korean American subjectivity as a process; see it in the moment of its making rather than assume that identity as predetermined, stable, or fixed. As we know from our experiences in taking photographs and consuming media, the way images are framed— what is placed at the center, from what angle the image is shot, what is cropped outside—determines what story the image tells. For Korean children and women, it is important to remember that they did not choose to be seen. And for the Korean adoptees and brides who were summoned by the United States to help navigate the war and US empire, their identities emerged in relation to US family frames that were imposed upon them. Images of Korean children, whether alone or with adoptive parents or missionary administrators, were situated within the context of a caretaking family; those of Korean women with American husbands were placed in the frame of marriage. What other experiences could not be told within US-prescribed family frames? What is captured in the frames thus also suggests what lies outside of them—the experiences of children and women before and after the\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n29\n\nmoment caught on camera, the unseen interactions where the drama of empire unfolds. When it came to Korea, what remained out of public view was more than an incompleteness; it was an active erasure. Marianne Hirsch explains the space of contradiction “between the myth of the ideal family and the lived reality of family life,” which shows us “what we wish our family to be, and therefore what, most frequently, it is not.”73 Published and unpublished photographs show this slippage between intention and reality, thus offering glimpses into the inner workings of America’s intimate empire. The chapters in this book trace the arc of intimate relations between Koreans and Americans, and the symbolic and material outcomes of these encounters. Part 1, “Imagined Family Frames,” considers how Americans in South Korea came to imagine Korean children as part of the American family. Chapter 1 describes how US military officials mandated serviceman visits to orphanages and the Department of Defense efforts to capture these moments on film. The pairing of American GIs and Korean children boosted soldier morale and gave the public a heartening lens through which to make sense of the war, though they soon posed a problem for the US military when its men tried to make these bonds permanent. Chapter 2 centers upon the work of US aid organizations that produced everything from waif appeals to Korean “songbirds” to raise money for wartime and postwar relief. In 1954, the AmericanKorean Foundation’s Korean Children’s Choir toured fifty cities, giving Americans an opportunity to imagine what it might be like to have these children in the United States permanently. Part 2, “International Cold War Families,” traces the transnational and legal makings of the Korean adoptee. Chapter 3 examines the work of US missionaries on the ground in postwar South Korea. Their efforts to aid Korean children-in-need transformed into campaigns to bring them to the United States. The very same individuals that US government officials supported for their internationalist work soon became the root of an immigration problem. Chapter 4 examines the social and cultural processes put in place to manage the arrival of Korean adoptees. It describes the transnational dimensions of making model adoptees, a project that began in US-run institutions in South Korea and ended with public visions of rapidly Americanizing adoptees in the United States. These scripts also relied upon the racialized management of mixed-race\n\n30\n\n|\n\nIntroduction\n\nchildren, who made up an estimated 70 percent of Korean adoptions during the 1950s.74 Part 3, “Erasing Empire,” centers upon the people and experiences placed outside of acceptable international family frames. US attempts to manage and disappear certain populations produced by the US military in Korea reflected the need to hide damning evidence of imposition, and to sustain positive visions of US internationalism. Chapter 5 reveals how American missionaries coerced Korean mothers into giving up their children, and how mixed-race children who remained in South Korea, children whom welfare studies labeled “social handicaps,” were segregated in orphanages and schools. Stateless and without protection or resources, both populations remained out of view and on the fringes of South Korean society. Chapter 6 centers on the figure of the Korean war bride. The assumed connection between camptown prostitution and Korean brides made Korean women untenable and thus in need of public erasure. To mitigate the threat of the Korean prostitute/bride, cultural constructions of the Japanese bride and the family singing sensation, the Kim Sisters, helped to supplant, rewrite, and ultimately erase the Korean military bride in the United States. Together, these chapters demonstrate how the United States was able to expand its reach to South Korea under the guise of familial care. The making of US power amidst decolonization required conflicting processes of visibility and erasure, enabling and preventing, making and destroying. It was ultimately the pressures of the Cold War that forced the United States to follow through on its internationalist claims by making room for interracial families of war. For the Korean children and women who became the focus of US government administrators, US servicemen, and American missionaries, social workers, and philanthropists, their lives changed course when they encountered American empire in its many forms. From the war that brought with it unfathomable destruction to the aid of Americans who tried to help repair that damage, Korean children and women found themselves bound to geographies that they did not choose, but were forced to navigate in South Korea, the United States, and spaces in between.\n\nPart I Imagined Family Frames\n\nThe United States first established diplomatic relations with Korea in 1882 under the Treaty of Peace, Amity, Commerce, and Navigation, a part of its larger quest for new markets and increased influence in the Pacific. The uneven terms of the treaty, which benefitted US trade and granted Americans extraterritorial rights, reflected the Orientalist lens through which US administrators viewed Korea, and how they placed Koreans alongside an existing compendium of undesirable Asian others. US delegates reported that Koreans were “lazy” and “incredibly ignorant,” much like other inhabitants of the Pacific.1 The US government readily left the peninsula in 1905, as soon as Japan took control of Korean foreign affairs. The US government’s swift exit and decision not to honor the treaty’s mutual friendship and assistance clause was an Orientalist dismissal, and reflected the tangential place of Korea in US policy at this time. Things took a turn after World War II, when Korea became geopolitically important to US Cold War policy in Asia. When the United States divided and occupied South Korea in 1945, US administrators sought to bring South Korea and its people into closer alignment with the United States, a way to help render its sudden interest to the tune of $300 million in economic aid to Korea legible to the American public. No longer the backwards, ignorant Koreans of the early 1900s, Koreans in the post– World War II era were said to be rapidly Christianizing and eager to embrace US-style democracy. Some commentators even likened Koreans to Americans. Homer B. Hulbert, a US educator who lived in Korea for twenty years, wrote that while they were neither good merchants like the Chinese nor good fighters like the Japanese, Koreans were “far more like Anglo-Saxons in temperament than either, and [were] by far the pleasantest people in the Far East to live amongst.”2 In 1948 Robert Oliver, the US advisor to President Syngman Rhee, explained that Koreans descended from the nomadic tribes of Mongolia and the Caucasian people 31\n\n32\n\n|\n\nImagined Family Frames\n\nof Western Asia, a combination of strains that gave Koreans “both Occidental and Oriental characteristics.”3 In 1951 missionary Horace Horton Underwood observed that, as a whole, Korean “people [were] much lighter in color than either the Japanese or the Chinese.”4 According to these sources, potential Western blood ties and Anglo features made Koreans more like Americans. These scripts helped further US goals to establish a democratic stronghold in Korea, a project that began by convincing Americans that Koreans were capable of adhering to democratic ideals culturally, socially, and even racially. US involvement in the Korean War both heightened and altered what was at stake in the cultural productions of Korea and Koreans. Extensive US military commitments that included over 1.7 million Americans who served in the theater of war and $67 billion spent between 1950 and 1953 required that Koreans appear worthy, while the damage wrought by the US military during the war necessitated explanations.5 When China entered the war, the US military relentlessly bombed North Korea, creating a wasteland between the 38th parallel and the Chinese border. On a single day in November 1950, seventy B-29s dropped 550 tons of incendiary bombs on Sinuiju, “removing [it] from off the map.”6 The bombs often came at night. Upon hearing the explosions, mothers grabbed their babies who slept next to them. As they ran away from burning villages, some realized that they were gripping a rice pillow instead of the child, a grave mistake made in the panic and darkness of night.7 North Koreans and the Chinese also used bombs, but the United States caused the bulk of the damage, which left nary a building standing and a disturbingly high civilian death toll in its wake.8 The US military could not easily hide its destruction of Korea. US power had to be remade to mitigate America’s violent role in the war. Domestically, a rescripting was necessary to convince Americans to support a war that was supposed to be a “limited military action,” but soon dragged on with no clear end in sight. Internationally, decolonizing nations needed proof that the United States practiced the democracy that it preached. Amidst these pressures, the Korean child emerged as a possible solution on both fronts. When placed under the care of the United States, Korean children could be seen as part of America’s imagined family, an innocent in need of rescue.\n\n1\n\nGIs and the Kids of Korea\n\nThe proximity of the Korean War to World War II made for easy, if unflattering, comparisons. Pulitzer Prize–winning World War II cartoonist Bill Mauldin remarked that the Korean War was an “unglorious” one, where news of soldiers killed in action might appear only in hometown papers “on page 17 under a Lux [soap] ad.” Mauldin predicted that the Korean War veteran would not come home to a parade, but rather would return quietly and alone, for “there’s no victory in the oldfashioned sense, anyway, because this [wasn’t] that kind of war. It [was] a slow, grinding, lonely, bitched-up war.”1 What began as a “pint-sized” military action quickly escalated, causing some to fear that this was the start of World War III.2 The US military faced new challenges in Korea. US soldiers could not distinguish friend from foe, a problem made worse by North Korean guerrilla fighters who hid guns under women’s robes. Panicked allied soldiers opened fire, killing thousands of innocent Korean civilians.3 US fighter planes strafed refugees walking along roads and bombed dams to flood entire villages suspected of harboring guerrilla fighters.4 At No Gun Ri in July 1950, US soldiers indiscriminately killed several hundred civilians, including infants and the elderly.5 News from the front made it difficult for Americans to embrace its servicemen who were responsible for the death of countless Korean civilians. War had indeed taken a turn in Korea. As the United States emerged a new superpower after World War II, the Korean War acted as a litmus test used to gauge America’s behavior in the Pacific and the world more broadly. It was in this context that the US soldier fighting in Korea became a liability. If American men in Korea conjured visions of detached violence, how could they represent the integrity of American democracy? The American GI had to be remade to conceal his most abject elements. Aaron Belkin describes how the US military asks its soldiers to embody traits that are framed as binary\n\n33\n\n34\n\n|\n\nGIs and the Kids of Korea\n\nopposites—strong/weak, dominant/subordinate, victor/victim, civilized/ barbaric, stoic/emotional—and how these irreconcilable paradoxes have to be smoothed over to extend the reach of American empire. Mary Renda considers how during the US occupation of Haiti from 1915 to 1934, paternalism did more than veil US military violence, it served as a vehicle for it.6 In Korea, to meet the conflicting needs of US Cold War policy, American soldiers were asked to communicate proper manhood and humanity, while committing unprecedented violence. Amidst these pressures emerged a corrective antidote: the Korean child. When placed in relation to American GIs, the child helped to recast US violence into acts of rescue. The children did what the military alone could not—they transformed military force into tales of salvation, redemption, and even love. This chapter centers upon the making of these relationships—ones that were mandated by US military officials and filmed by the Department of Defense for the world to see—as well as the unintended bonds that developed from these points of contact, intimate relationships that ran counter to the needs of a military that wanted its men to fight a war, not play fathers to Korean children.\n\nUS Militarization from Occupation to War In 1945, at the start of US occupation in South Korea, US officials scrambled to get their bearings in a country with which they had minimal previous contact. The Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) and the Armed Forces Assistance to Korea (AFAK) explained that occupation occurred “so rapidly that preparations for civil affairs activities in the area were far from complete, both in terms of policy directives and personnel.”7 Mass migration to the south exacerbated the problem. Between 1945 and 1949, nearly two and a half million people flooded into South Korea. According to the United Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency (UNKRA), by 1946 the American zone contained almost 70 percent of Korea’s entire population, about seventeen million people. The US military, the largest US entity in South Korea, helped occupation administrators stabilize and monitor the growing population. The US military collected census data and executed emergency health measures, like DDT dusting and smallpox vaccinations; it worked alongside AFAK and the Korea Civil Assistance Command\n\nGIs and the Kids of Korea\n\n| 35\n\n(KCAC) to build schools and manage agricultural production. These activities linked the US military to Korean civil affairs, a connection that would grow in the years to come.8 While the US military helped with a broad range of US occupation needs, it remained steadfast in its primary duty—to train and build a Korean army. During occupation, US military administrators transformed the small Korean army trained under Japanese rule into the Republic of Korea (ROK) army, numbering 100,000 men. US military officers taught Korean cadets US-style combat, military organization, and discipline, and set up a school modeled after West Point Academy. At the end of occupation in 1948, when US and Soviet troops were supposed to leave the peninsula, US military advisors stayed on. They deemed it necessary, claiming that Koreans were incapable of administering their own army and not yet strong enough to face a possible Soviet attack.9 The Orientalist pretext that justified continued US military presence soon found political backing. In 1950 Paul Nitz, the chief of the Policy Planning Staff of the State Department, drafted National Security Council Report 68 (NSC-68), which outlined Soviet plans to carry out nuclear attacks in Alaska, Canada, and the United States.10 Claiming that the USSR sought to “impose its absolute authority over the rest of the world,” the writers of NSC-68 demanded the extension of US policies and influence to decolonizing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.11 Months after its publication, Dean Acheson, then acting secretary of state and one of the policy paper’s advisors, committed US air and ground forces to Korea’s civil war. During the Korean War, President Truman implemented the policies outlined in NSC-68 by increasing US defense expenditures, atomic capabilities, and military aid to Korea fourfold.12 By 1952, the United States had committed 350,000 ground troops to add to 448,000 South Korean soldiers. United Nations allies committed 12,000 British, 8,500 Canadian, 5,000 Turkish, and 5,000 Filipino soldiers, and fewer than 1,000 from each of the other eleven allied nations.13 The rapid buildup and extent of US military commitments in wartime Korea cemented the indefinite place of the US military in the peninsula. At the outset, 81 percent of Americans were in support of the war. However, a couple of months into the conflict, when China entered, 49 percent of the American population deemed the war misguided.14 By January 1, 1951, two-thirds of the American public wanted to remove\n\n36\n\n|\n\nGIs and the Kids of Korea\n\nUS troops, and 50 percent believed that President Truman had made a mistake when he decided to enter Korea.15 The drop in public support had much to do with news coming from the front. For the first six months of the war, scores of Western journalists reported from the battlefield without formal censorship.16 A February 1951 New York Times article described in grim detail how US bombers unleashed napalm on unsuspecting villagers, who were killed while going about their daily routines—children playing in an orphanage, a housewife ordering from a Sears Roebuck catalogue, all frozen in death by napalm.17 This was the first time that many had heard of the gelling agent that would become all too familiar when the United States waged war in Vietnam a decade later.18 North Korean news outlets broadcast reports of women and children slain by American bombs. It was difficult to refute the accusations. By December 1952, the United States had dropped upon North Korea almost twice the tonnage of bombs used in Japan during all of World War II.19 In May 1951, Truman tried to address the harrowing outcomes of war. Echoing the anti-communist language of the Truman Doctrine and Marshall Plan, he declared that US military action in Korea was guided by a “universal human wish” for Koreans to be as “independent, and united—as they want to be.” Positioning the United States as a mere supporter in Korea’s quest for freedom from communism, Truman claimed that the United States was a secondary player in their war. In his speech, Truman also defended America’s broader Asia policy. He assured the public that his administration did “not want Formosa or any part of Asia for ourselves,” reiterating that “we believe in freedom for all the nations of the Far East . . . [and] want to help them secure for themselves better health, more food, better clothes and homes, and the chance to live their own lives in peace.”20 Truman’s words addressed international accusations of US imperialism, while the parallel that he drew between freedom and material goods promoted the capitalist goals of an American empire seeking to secure global markets. In Korea, few saw the United States in these idealistic terms. Beginning with US occupation in 1945, US forces imposed an uneven mix of colonial management and heavy-handed oppression. The US Army Military Government in Korea (USAMGIK) controversially filled top-level positions with Koreans who had worked for the previous Japanese colonial\n\nGIs and the Kids of Korea\n\n| 37\n\ngovernment. US administrators refused to recognize the Korean People’s Republic and suppressed protests.21 The relationship between the US military and local Koreans continued to deteriorate during the war. News of servicemen behaving badly circulated in the US and South Korean press. In December 1950, the New York Times reported that some American GIs responded to the “heartbreak of retreat” by looting stores in Seoul. A spokesman for the US Eighth Army in Korea corroborated these reports, noting an increase in the number of homicides and crimes committed by American soldiers.22 US servicemen started drunken brawls, brandished guns, and “molested” women on the streets, incidents that led the Provost Marshal in Seoul to close dance halls and change the curfew for American servicemen from 9:00 to 7:00 p.m.23 The permeating presence of the US military and the extreme devastation of war complicated Korea’s path to sovereignty. Once China entered, it became clear that Korea would need the US military to fight the war and US aid to help Korean civilians harmed by it. President Rhee’s visit to an orphanage reflected the contradictions of Korea’s growing dependence upon the United States. On August 15, 1951 to commemorate Korea’s Independence Day, Rhee visited 463 children housed at Joyful Mountain orphanage.24 That Rhee invited Korean journalists to report on this event held at an orphanage operated by a US Army officer was not happenstance, and in fact revealed the fraught relationship between the nations. While the United States was one of the reasons why Korea was divided and not independent in the first place, and its bombs a primary contributor to the need for Korean orphanages, Korea had little choice but to rely even more hea"
