The college is indeed proud\n\n�f each and every graduate, and everyone who returns tomorrow\n\nmay duly feel that he is not visiting a strange place, but merely\n\nis doing his part ot make this annual homecoming affair a tre-\n\nmendous success. The homecoming committee is to be congratu-\n\nlated for it's tireless efforts in cooperating with the Alumni sec-\n\nretary to make this year's program better than ever The com-\n\nmittee has everything prepared for the alumni when they begin\n\npouring in tomorrow, and no time will be wasted, as morning\n\nmeetings are scheduled for the early arrivers. No school forgets\n\nit's alumni, and E. C. T.

Yes, I know\n\nyou had to look at your calendar often to make sure it is October,\n\ninstead of June. And then time has been rather a bother, too, hav-\n\ning to turn it up and turn it down, like it was a radio. Sho' nuff,\n\nwe didn't know what it was. But from now on my time is your\n\ntime.

The\n\none aim of the college is that every returning alumni enjoys him-\n\nself and hrings himself to a closer and warmer understanding\n\nwith the college and it's activities. E. C. T. C. does not want its\n\ngraduates ever to forget their happy days spent here while se-\n\ncuring their education, and tomorrow's program proves that\n\npoint. Everything else must take a back seat for the day, and\n\nwhen the program draws to a close, it is the earnest desire of\n\nthe college that everyone has enjoyed the day and will think only\n\nof returning next fall for another visit. A hearty welcome to all\n\nalumni, and may your day prove interesting and beneficial to\n\nvou.\n\nThe Spirit Of Cooperation\n\nFor years there has been a tendency on the part of both East\n\nCarolina Teachers College and Greenville High School to work\n\nagainst each oth�r rather than together, with each cooperating\n\ntoward the improvement of the other. Each year editorials have\n\nappeared in the student publications of both institutions present-\n\ning their own side of the question without regard for the other.\n\nThis has in no way helped to solve the problem it has only\n\nmade it worse.\n\nNow at last both student bodies are realizing the benefits of\n\nstudent teachers as well as the bad points of the set-up. In the\n\nlast issue of Green Lights, the high school publication, there ap-\n\npeared several articles featuring East Carolina Teachers College.\n\nAmong thest- was the following editorial which we think sums\n\nup the situation pretty well.\n\nStudent teaching in Greenville high by ECTC seniors serves\n\nas the tie that binds the two educational institutions. When stu-\n\ndent teachers are well prepared for their work�as frequently\n\nthey are�numerous benefits are afforded them and the GHS\n\nstudent body.\n\nUnder the present student-teacher set-up much individual\n\nattention is given to students in planning their work and in\n\ncarrying out their plans. The fact that most college students look\n\nforward to their initial teaching experience results in their bring-\n\ning new points of view and enthusiasm along with well-planned\n\nlessons to che classroom.\n\nThat student teachers are somewhat unfamiliar with their\n\nduties, regardless of what their background may be, serves as a\n\nconstant challenge to faculty supervisors to exert their strongest\n\ninfluence in aiding student apprenties to become acceptable in-\n\nstructors. Xow that the college grants a B. S. degree without stu-\n\ndent teaching, it is b lieved that student teachers in the future\n\nwill be more vitally interested in their work than ever before.\n\nStudent teaching has made continual progress in recent\n\nyears and there is every indication that it will reach a new peak\n\nin efficiency this year. Such a goal seems paramount in eveyone's\n\nthinking\n\nTo Green Lights and the High School we say \"Thanks for\n\nyour spirit of cooperation. We appreciate it and will try our best\n\nto do our part too\n\nis that ever so noisey bit of cheering in the center of the cheer-\n\nleaders. Also she is having a chance to show her dramatic ability\n\nother than during an initiation. She will be one of the characters\n\nin the first Chi Phi Players production this fall.\n\nFenley Spear, experienced photographer here in school, was\n\nreally on the job last Friday night. The result was two good pic-\n\ntures of Lansing Hatfield at E. C. T. C.\n\nJanie Eakes, President of the sophomore class, is losing no\n\ntime in getting her class organized. Plans are already made for\n\nthe coming Sophomore-Senior. Janie really is a hard worker and\n\ncarries a schedule that many of us couldn't.\n\nSay, are all you practice teachers as good as one I know?\n\nYes, I do mean Helen Wolf. She is practice teaching in social dan-\n\ncing. And frankly, she is plenty good. Keep up the good work,\n\n\"Shorty\n\nCharlie Futrell. whom some of you may not know, is presi-\n\ndent of the Varsity Club for this year. With such an enthusiastic\n\nathlete behind it we expect much from them this year. To begin\n\nwith, they are helping to sponsor the Homecoming Parade. Also\n\nthey have planned a whale of a meeting for tonite. Right after\n\nsupper the entire student body is invited to assemble in front of\n\nthe dining hall to join in the bon fire parade. The Band, Varsity\n\nriub. Football team, Coach, and Cheer leaders will all be there.\n\nWe will march around the campus and then to the football field\n\nto gather around a fire with college songs, cheers, and pep talks.\n\nMany of you have attended gatherings like this before, but for\n\nthose of you who have not�you may well expect a spirit lifting!\n\nIt will all be consummated by the burning in effigy of Western\n\nCarolina Teachers College.

There have been ei\n\nfrom several enthusiastic students on the campus cone\n\nlack of school spirit at ECTC. and whether or not I\n\nhave aroused any concern among the mass of students\n\nwe would like to know. The fact that our athletic events\n\ntended by a \"puny\" representation of the entire em-\n\nobvious enough, and that is only the first drawback. W\n\nwinning football team this year, a snappy marching 1\n\nrapidly becoming a smooth-stepping organization under i\n\nable direction of R. W- Getchell, new band instructor\n\nvocal effects we now boast a group of excellent cheer\n\nCharles Cushman and his assistants are displaying more\n\ngenuine spirit than we have had around here for a long I\n\nit is only fair that their tireless efforts should receive a\n\noperation that the students can give. Anyone will tell\n\nschool spirit is very necessary at anv institution, and\n\nthe situation is no long exception. We should be so insi ind\n\nenthusiastic about our football team that we should\n\nbubble over with exuberance in letting everyone know thai\n\nhave something of which to be proud, and that we ARK\n\nIf we could in some wav excite the student body so thai lid\n\nhave at least five hundred students at all home games, il Id\n\nbe a blessing. The football players want to think thai tl\n\nsomething to fight for when they play at home, and the si\n\nway to show them that they are supported to the last dil\n\nbe present at the home games. Athletics is an essential\n\nthe educational set-up, and we, as students, are duty boui\n\nour part in making athletics live up to the standards sel by\n\ncolleges. All this chatter just adds up to one thing-\n\nshow more school spirit and be more directly interested h\n\ntics at ECTC. Let's start off by attending the next hom\n\n100 per cent. It's up to you, so let's see some action!\n\n�An Optimistic Studt\n\n-\n\nTECOAN PICTURES\n\nWe will begin taking pictures for the annual on Octo-\n\nber 27. You will make your own appointment.

Watts, Editor.\n\nFarewell\n\nAt this time the Teco Echo editorial staff wishes to bid a fond\n\nfarewell to the person who has so diligently and faithfully worked\n\nin order to keep intact the high standars to which the paper must\n\nadher for the sake of the college and the students, who actually\n\nare the voice of the paper. Jimmy Whitfield has been a superb\n\nleader as editor of the Teco Echo, and his example will be a guid-\n\ning star to the ones who succeed him. He has answered his coun-\n\ntry's distress signal and has given up much to become one of\n\nUncle Sam's boys, because he is broad-minded and intelligent\n\nenough to realize that the plight of America is of a much more\n\nimportance than any individual desires that may obsess a junior\n\nin college. Jimmy must pack his ambition in his closet for a while\n\nand concentrate upon molding himself into a good soldier. Maybe\n\nhe can return to college and complete his matriculation after the\n\npresent national emergency is over, but until then we take our\n\nhats off to a talented citizen who has served his fellow man well.\n\nJimmy Whitfield made a name for himself while at E. C. T. C,\n\nand he earned his distinction with the sweat of his brow. He has\n\nbeen a campus leader from the minute he first stepped in, and\n\nhis actions, both as a college student and a journalist, have re-\n\nflected nothing but the best. His virtues are many, and his initia-\n\ntive is unsurpassed. A friendly smile, a word of cheer, and a\n\nsmattering of wit are the characteristics of this outstanding\n\nblow to the college. So, to Jimmy Whitfield, gentleman and\n\nscholar, we say \"adieu and we fervently hope that his fine work\n\nfor E. C. T. C. will not retard but will be kept up with the tempo\n\nthat he has set during his three years here. No tribute is too great\n\nfor \"Buck Private Whitfield for his achievements speak for\n\nhim and it is useless to attempt to argue with actuality. We shall\n\nmiss him, but his is a just cause. And we wish him all the luck he\n\nso richly deserves.\n\nDTlH\n\n1\n\nAthlete Out\n\nThere are times when fate plays a sinister role in the life of\n\na college student, and fate has struck on our campus this fall.\n\nAs a result, a student is now in the Medical Hospital of the Uni-\n\nversity of Virginia recovering from a head injury sustained\n\nwhile giving his all on the gridiron for his school. Bob Young,\n\npopular wingback on the football team, will be out the entire\n\nquarter but hopes to be able to return to school for the winter\n\nquarter. Bob is known for his gentlemanly attitude in any com-\n\npetitive sport, and his clean sportsmanship branded him a truly\n\ngreat athlete. He was always in the best of condition and de-\n\nserved all the breaks of the game, but fate plays no favorites,\n\nand Bob was the unlucky recipient of the bad breaks. He will be\n\nsorely missed on the gridiron this fall, and all students are pray-\n\ning for a speedy recovery for the scrappy athlete.\n\npersonality, and his absence from the campus will be a definite MR. WALKER!\n\nThanks To Mr. Walker\n\nThe students of East Carolina Teachers College wish to\n\nthank Mr. T. Y. Walker, manager of the Pitt Theatre for enter-\n\ntaining the freshman class at free movie during Orientation\n\nweek.

In the three\n\nnumbers played as a solo, Mr.\n\nSmith kept the audience on the\n\nedge of their seats.

No, I wasn't shocked at the so-called drastic n\n\nbut did I feel silly when I discovered that these rules fr\n\nvears back were no different than the regulations of a a\n\nother college in N. C.�and one which I had transferred\n\nthe year before: Here are some of them as quoted from the 1931\n\nhandbook of E. C. T. C.\n\n1. Study hour�7:30 P. M.�10:00 P. M.\n\nRecreation hour�10:00 P. M.�10:20 P. M.\n\nLights out�10:30 P. M.\n\n2. Students must have a special permission sent directly\n\nfrom their parents to the dean for each out-of-town\n\nprivilege.\n\n3. Absolute quiet in the dormitories from 10:30 P. M.\n\n6:30 A. M.\n\n4. Students must not dine at any restaurants or go t\n\noffice or to any railroad station without special pel\n\nsion from the Dean of Women.\n\n5. Students must wear hats when calling or shopping.\n\n6. A student is not allowed three unexcused absences per\n\nmonth.\n\n7. Students may speak to young men on the street, but may\n\nnot carry on extended conversation with them nor walk\n\nwith them.\n\nNow friends, in addition to these 1931 rules, here's what\n\nI went through at\n\n1. No cuts on classes unless you pay $1.00 to make work up-\n\nA few sick cuts were excused.\n\n2. Closed studv from 9:20 A. M.�12:00 noon�1:30 P. H-\n\n�3:20 P. M.�7:10 P. M.�10:00 P. M.\n\nDuring this time if you went into a girl's room to inquire\n\nabout a lesson, for this was your only excuse, you signed out in\n\na dormitory register�where you told your life history�and you\n\nwere allowed to stay only three minutes in the respective room.\n\n3. We secured prmission for town and snows by filing a\n\nrequest with our dean. This, we were allowed to do�only twice\n\neach week.\n\n4. We wore stockings everytime we left the campus, and\n\nhats were added if you went to town.\n\n5. Smoking was a shipping offense.\n\n6. We were allowed to have a social engagement�date to\n\nyou�on Saturday and Sunday nights. First-year students were\n\nchaperoned by a student council member if they went to town.\n\n7.
