Upon a plea of guilty t<r narcotics charges he was subsequently sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment and his parole revoked. - 9 - The following table indicates the Bureau’s 1938 activities, as com­ pared to the previous year: ARRESTS Narcotic Laws Marihuana Tax Act 1937 1938 1937 * 77 80 New York 657 Philadelphia District Totals 1938 1937 1938 3 7 80 87 684 4 100 661 784 193 126 18 98 211 224 Baltimore 101 112 5 38 106 150 Atlanta 117 99 6, 45 123 144 Nashville 250 131 8 54 258 185 Detroit 178 214 45 165 223 379 Chicago 380 298 16 62 396 360 Houston 543 527 30 163 573 690 Kansas City 216 207 22 82 238 289 Minneapolis 57 35 7 41 64 76 Denver 51 49 20 67 71 116 350 274 10 104 360 378 Seattle 82 74 17 55 99 129 Honolulu 85 103 12 7 97 110 Total 3,337 3,013 223 1,088 3,560 4,101 Boston San Francisco *Since the Marihuana Tax Act did not become effective until October 1, 1937, the figures shown for that year represent arrests for the three-month period October to December. 10 BUREAU OF CUSTOMS Baring the past year law enforcement activities were again directed in large measure against the smuggling of narcotics into the United States. Operating independently, or cooperating with the Bureau of Narcotics, a number of very important seizures of narcotics and apprehensions of notorious smug­ glers were effected. Seizures of smuggled merchandise totaled slightly less than 6,500, a decrease of 600 under the preceding year. There were more than 3,200 seizures of smuggled liquor, an increase of more than 400 over the year before, largely due to' greater smuggling activity along the Mexican border. Narcotic seizures aggregated nearly 800, a gain of 200 seizures over calendar year 193?, and totaled more than 23,500 ounces. The largest narcotic seizure was in New York on August 14 and 15, 1938, and consisted of 1,300 5-tael tins of smoking opium, weighing 8,293 ounces. These tins were recovered from the river bed at the pier at which tho British steamship GLAUCUS had previously docked after arrival from the Orient# The next seizure in importance was that at New York City on November 16, 1938, on the British steamship SILVERYEW, This seizure, consisting of 666 5-tael tins of smoking opium and 1,000 1-tael tins of smoking opium, weighing 5,524 ounces, resulted from information received from the same source as that leading to the G-LAUCUS seizure. The largest raw opium seizure effected during the calendar year 193S was made at Savannah, Georgia, and consisted of £3 pounds, 5 ounces, of raw opium and 3 pounds of heroin, on the Italian steamship ARSA# This vessel arrived at Savannah from Marseille, via Seville, San Juan, Havana, Yera Cruz and New Orleans, The attempt of a steward to sell a quantity of opium to an informant of the local Customs Agent led to search of the ship in the latter part of December by Customs officers and Coast Guard personnel, which, after 11 several days of intensive efforts, finally resulted in the discovery of the contraband. Smaller raw opium seizures were made in Arizona and Southern California at points on or near the Mexican border and in each instance the opium seized appeared to be of Mexican origin. However, there were fewer of such seizures than in 1937 and it would appear that the activities of the Mexican Government curtailed the smuggling of raw opium into the United States. A seizure of 85.58 ounces of heroin was effected at New York on October 27, 1938, ex Italian steamship REX. The two persons arrested in connection with this case received heavy sentences. INTELLIGENCE UNIT Eighty-eight persons, including prominent business and professional men, as well as racketeers in illegal enterprises, wore indicted in 1938 for income and other tax evasion. Of those tried seventy-one were convicted, and, in addition to prison sentences, fines of $125,000 were imposed. Additional taxes and penalties totaling $24,934,312.61 were recommended for assessment in the tax cases investigated in 1938. In addition to those convicted of tax evasions, twenty-six persons were prosecuted for violation of the National Eirearms Act, and substantial prison sentences, running as high as the maximum of five years, meted out. Two pe rsons also were convicted of evasion of the social security tax, and the work of apprehending those who wilfully fail to pay this tax is speedily gaining momentum. Investigations by Special Agents of charges of a serious nature against employees have resulted in the discharge of eighty-four individuals, whose separation was deemed to be for the best interests of the Service. 12 - In addition criminal proceedings have \"been instituted when violations of the criminal statutes were involved, and during 1938, twenty-eight employees were indicted, and of those tried twenty were convicted. The Unit was responsible for the further incarceration in 1938 of Leon Grleckman, of St. Paul, previously convicted in 1934 for income tax evasion and sentenced to prison for eighteen months. At the time he was characterized in the press of St. Paul as \"Public Enemy No, 1.\" first trial resulted in a disagreement. Gleokhan*s In the course of a subsequent exami­ nation of the books of Grleckman's finance company, unpaid loans to a juror in the first trial were found, and the juror confessed having received the money to influence him. Gleckman was held in contempt of court for jury fixing and sentenced to six months' imprisonment. ALCOHOL TAX UNIT Preliminary figures definitely indicate that the downward trend noted in the number of seizures and prosecutions during previous years has somewhat leveled off and is approximately the same as during the year 1937, 1 detailed analysis of the records shows that while the 1938 arrests and seizures are at approximately the 1937 level, continued progress has been made against the illicit operator. For example, the average amount of mash seized with each still was but 645 gallons in 1938, compared with 720 gallons in 1937, and 1,150 gallons in 1935. The results achieved during the past year are indicated by the fact that there were 27,571 arrests made by the Unit for violation of the liquor laws during 1938 - an increase of 1,506 over the previous year. 13 There were 28,513 prosecutions recommended in Alcohol Tax Unit cases during the past year, during which time 21,906 persons were indicted and 17,855 convicted, a slight decrease from the previous year. The Court dockets have \"been slightly relieved of their congested condition during the past year, as there were 8,037 persons awaiting grand juiy action on December 31, 1938, as compared with 8,883 the previous year. A small decrease is also noted in the number of persons awaiting trial, there being 8,076 cases on December 31, 1938, as compared with 8,419 on December 31, 1937. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1938, according to the annual report of the Department of Justice, 4,792 prisoners were committed to Federal penitentiaries for violation of the Federal Liquor Statutes, or 41.3% of the inmates committed to such institutions. During the preceding year 5,543 prisoners were committed to Federal penitentiaries for violation of the Federal Liquor Statutes, which comprised 48.2$ of all inmates committed to such institutions.

This represents 62.9$ of all persons sentenced to Federal penitentiaries during the year. 1 1 3 The National Health Survey was a project conducted by the United States Public Health Service with the aid of financial grants from the Works Progress Administration* The results* are based on a house-to-house canvass of some 800,000 families, including 2,800,000 persons in 83 cities and 23 rural areas in 19 States. The Survey was made during the winter (largely from November to March) of 1935-36. The total surveyed population was so distributed as to give a sample which was, in general, representative of cities in the United States according to size and region. In large cities (100,000 and over) the population to be canvassed was determined by a random selection of many small districts based on those used in the United States Decennial Census of 1930. In the smaller cities selected for the study, the population was enumerated com­ pletely. - 2 - The report pointed out that blind persons are concentrated in the low income groups. Seventy percent were found to be in families with annual incomes of less than flOOO. The prevalence of blindness among men is greater than among women, according to Survey findings. For every 100 blind women there are 111 men afflicted with blindness. Among youths (15-24 years), the prevalence rate for males is 20 per 100,000, while the female rate is only 9 per 100,900. Figures for the younger working ages (25-44) show a prevalence of 144 blind per 100,000 men, while the rate for women is only 28. In the oldest age grouping (65 and over), however, the rate is 706 per 100,000 women to 660 per 100,000 men. The Survey found nearly twice as much blindness among colored people as among whites in proportion to their numbers. The rate of blindness for colored persons is 146 per 100,000 as contrasted with 75 for the white population. Only 11 percent of the blind were reported as being employed in gainful occupations, leaving the greater number dependent upon private or public support. This study of the National Health Survey was primarily con­ cerned with total blindness, which included \"all persons reported by the family as being blind in both eyes\". In conneetion with the study, however, figures for blindness in only one eye were compiled and it was estimated that \"in the general population there were about 425,000 persons blind in one eye only\", as against 117,000 persons blind in both eyes. TREASURY DEPARTMENT U. S. Public Health Service Washington, D. C. FOR RELEASE v Sunday, January 22, 1939 TTa^r There , ... are at least 117,000 totally blind persons in the United States tinriT. according to estimates of the National Health Survey which were made public by the United States Public Health Service today. In presenting this figure, George St. John Perrott, director of the Survey, stated that blindness, which already constitutes a major problem in society, will be likely to increase because older persons, among whom blindness is more prevalent, are constituting a larger and larger proportion of the population. One-fourth of the blind are over 75 years of age and three-fifths are over 55* Cataract, glaucoma, trachoma, optic nerve atrophy and other eye diseases coupled with more general diseases such as high blood pressure, hardening of the arteries and diabetes are responsible for nearly threefourths of all blindness. The rest is attributed to accidents (about 21 per cent) and congenital or early infancy causes (approximately 7 per cent)• Among the accidents causing blindness — one-fifth of the entire amount — which account for about the largest single cause is falls (16 per cent); next in order come automobile accidents and burns (each 10 per cent); and poisonings and firearms (each 7 per cent); the remaining 50 per cent is distributed over a large number of known and unknown types of accidents. Forty-three per cent of these accidents are classified as occupational injuries, those occurring at work; 27 per cent occurred in the home and 30 per cent in public places, including automobile accidents.

The two attached tables show number of returns, gross income, deductions, net income or deficit, normal tax, surtax on undistributed profits and excess-profits tax, the first table classifying the data by States and Territories and the second by major industrial groups, and, in both instances, the data are further classified by returns with net income and with no net income. - 4 - \"Gross income\" and \"deductions\" correspond to \"total income\" and \"total deductions\" as reported on the face of the return, plus, each instance, former years, \"cost of goods sold\" and \"cost of operations\". in Unlike \"gross income\" includes interest received on certain Government obligations, which is subject to excess-profits tax, and \"deductions\" include contributions or gifts (limited to five percent of net income before deduction of contributions or gifts) and exclude dividends received on stock of domestic corporations subject to taxation under the effective revenue act. \"Net income\" in the following tables means \"net income for excess-profits tax computation\" and represents the amount of gross income, as defined above, in excess of deductions, and \"deficit\" repre­ sents the excess of deductions over gross income. The classification of the returns into those \"with net income\" and \"with no net income\" is based on this item. Unlike former years, net income or deficit includes dividends received on stock of domestic corporations subject to taxation under the effective revenue act and. interest received on certain Government obligations which is subject to the excess-profits tax, and excludes contributions or gifts (limited to five percent of net income before deduction ef contributions or gifts for returns with year ended December 31, 1936 and thereafter). The table in the forthcoming third release in this series of tabulations shows dividends received on stock of domestic corporations, interest received on certain Government obligations subject to the excess-profits tax and contributions or gifts, by major industrial groups and \"by returns with net income and with no net income. The in­ formation shown in this forthcoming table permits comparisons of the 1936 data shown in the second of the attached tables on gross income, deductions, and net income less deficit with these items for prior years and indicates the effect on the cla.ssification of the returns with’ net income and with no net income by the inclusion in net income for excess-profits tax computation of dividends received on stock of domestic corporations and interest received on certain Government obligations. This year, for the first time, the industrial groups, '•clothing and apparel\", \"petroleum and other minera.1 oil products\", and \"motor vehicles, complete or parts\" are shown in the second of the attached tables as major industrial groups. In prior years, the group \"clothing and apparel\" was included in \"textile mill products\", the group \"petroleum and other mineral oil products\" was included in \"chemicals and allied products\", and the group \"motor vehicles, complet or parts\" was included in \"meta,l and its products\". The statistics are compiled from returns as filed and prior to revision that may subsequently be made as a result of audit by the Bureau of Internal Revenue.
