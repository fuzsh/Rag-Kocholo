        "text": "In the hands of a group of Indonesian female dancers in Perth, Western Australia, a gentle sea breeze or Angin Maimiri was recreated through the use of swaying fans. The Indonesian women's own newly choreographed dance or tari kreasi is based on the Makassarese traditional song of the same name from South Sulawesi. The women had intended to perform the dance in a ‘feminine’ manner with soft graceful movements. Yet, as illustrated in the ethnographic account of mistakes and misinterpretations that happened at the performance, as well as purposeful adaptations by the dancers, ideals of femininity are not simply transferred in a transnational context; they become inadvertently challenged. Angin Mamiri, as danced in an ‘un-feminine’ manner by an Indonesian housewife hobby group, is illustrative of who they are as marriage migrants and their often marginalised position in their diasporic community. This article is inspired by misperformance ethnography [Prendergast 2014, “Misperformance Ethnography.” Applied Theatre Research 2 (1): 77–90] of what is revealed about ideals held by those involved in a performance when mistakes and misinterpretations happen. Using an anthropology of performance approach thus provides a novel analysis at the intersection of migration and gender studies of how gender ideals such as femininity can be challenged through dance performance in a transnational context.\n\nIn recent years, a growing group of scholars has begun to draw upon queer theory as they research aspects of LGBTQ folk performances and texts from around the globe. In the process, folklore scholars have become increasingly intrigued by bodies that appear to transgress dimorphism, and complicate binary oppositions like male/female. Performances of gender identity and sexuality by hijras in South Asia have awakened audiences’ imaginings since the Kama Sutra period (Gupta 2005:180). In folktale, dance, song, religious epic, and popular culture, the figure of the hijra often evokes a liminal play of “otherness.” Commonly known as the “third gender”—a conceptual space outside of typical Western constructs—hijra individuals engage with varied notions of transsexual, transgender, intersex, cross- dresser, eunuch, or sexual fluidity. This article focuses on a feminist appropriation of the hijra within yoni ki baat, a South Asian American version of The Vagina monologues. The authors explore how the figure of the hijra—drawn from South Asian folk narratives, religious discourse, and popular culture—might be used strategically by social activists in political performance narratives to (1) encourage a complicated sense of sexually ambiguous or queer practices and identities, and (2) acknowledge individuals facing social oppression due to their marginalized identities. As such, their approach conceptualizes performance as both a relational space and as a space in which to wonder about questions of relationality (Madison and Hamera 2006; Schechner 1990).\n\nHow might a collaborative performance staged across indigenous cultures – in this case Māori and Native American – be seen to create a shared wairua that leads to mārama? For this Symposium, Valance Smith (Ngāpuhi/Waikato) will compose a waiata as the starting point for a hoop dance choreographed and performed by Eddie Madril (Pascua Yaqui) from the Sewan American Indian Dance company. Waiata is, at its simplest, song. It is a vessel for a kaupapa, in the lyrics and also in its music, an embodiment of the singer’s mauri that, in the ideal, resonates in the listener. Hoop dancing has many purposes. It describes the complexities of life, expresses many aspects of the scientific nature of the world through the art form, and invokes the meaning behind the cycle of all living things. In bringing together two distinctive performance languages and cultures, we will be looking for common ground, exploring possible synergies and seeking an experience of the metaphysical in the physicality of...\n\nFor over two hundred years, the Ainu of Japan have been colonized in their ancestral lands and faced deep discrimination in the purported mono-ethnic, homogenous Japanese society. Despite the Japanese government’s official recognition of the Ainu as the Indigenous people of Japan in 2008, the Ainu continue to fight for their rights and to maintain their identity. In this dissertation, I examine the various ways Ainu use expressive culture to highlight their cultural differences in order to reaffirm their identity against assimilationist policies. Taking advantage of the growing awareness of global Indigenous rights, the Ainu participate in the global discourse of Indigeneity by making connections with Indigenous peoples around the world. Through these efforts, the Ainu draw attention to their struggle and demonstrate that they are a living, breathing, and vital people, despite being forgotten and rendered invisible in the colonial history and memory of Japan. This dissertation focuses on the “staging” of Ainu identity by Ainu people in various physical and metaphysical spaces in Japan and beyond. These grassroots efforts place the Ainu in charge of their own representation. By focusing on music and dance performances, and the overall representation of Ainu on various stages, I view these performances as dynamic, active, and productive “vitalizing traditions,” rather than the popular perception of tourist performances as only negative and inauthentic. These performances provide a glimpse into the ways in which the Ainu use expressive culture to perform, understand, and create new avenues to express and construct a sense of Ainuness through propelling activities rather than rebuilding ones. The ethnographic settings presented in this dissertation collectively probe themes of traditionality, authenticity, performativity, Indigeneity, and agency. I argue that a rigid application of these terms tends to cast Indigenous expression, presentation, and performance as inauthentic or as constructed tradition and in the process ignore Indigenous peoples’ active and nuanced roles in asserting their ethnicity on their own terms. Re-framing descriptions of Indigenous peoples’ artistic output as intentional and dynamic not only gives voice to Indigenous people but levels the playing field by viewing Indigenous creativity as deserving of support rather than needing rescue and resuscitation."
