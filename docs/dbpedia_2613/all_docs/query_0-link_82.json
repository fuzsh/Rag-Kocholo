        "text": "Which index best correlates with body fat mass: BAI, BMI, waist or WHR?\n\nPubMed\n\nSuchanek, Pavel; Kralova Lesna, Ivana; Mengerova, Olga; Mrazkova, Jolana; Lanska, Vera; Stavek, Petr\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe body mass index (BMI) has been the most commonly applied clinical measure to characterise body composition in individuals. However, the BMI has been criticised as being an inaccurate measure of body fatness. Recently, a new index reflecting body composition, the Body Adiposity Index (BAI) was proposed. The BAI was calculated using the equation BAI=((hip circumference)/ ((height)1.5) - 18). The aim of this study was to compare estimates of body fat content, i.e., body adiposity index (BAI), BMI, waist-hip ratio (WHR) and waist and hip circumferences, with respect to their ability to predict the percentage of body fat (PBF). To select an optimal surrogate for adiposity, we examined the correlation between body adiposity percentage as measured by BIA and several variables, including BAI, BMI and WHR. Correlations ranged from a high of 0.78 for BMI, 0.67 for BAI and 0.66 for waist circumference to a low value of 0.39 for the WHR index. The correlation between PBF and BAI (R=0.67, R2=0.45, p<0.001) and the correlation between PBF and BMI (R=0.78, R2=0.60, p<0.001) were of similar magnitude. Based on our results and those of other studies, we can say that the BAI index is not a universally valid index that could be used in the place of the BMI index in a Caucasian population; indeed, it would not accurately reflect body fat mass and thus could lead to an increased risk of obesity. Further, WHR index is not a suitable for an estimation of body fat.\n\nComparison of Body Mass Index (BMI), Body Adiposity Index (BAI), Waist Circumference (WC), Waist-To-Hip Ratio (WHR) and Waist-To-Height Ratio (WHtR) as predictors of cardiovascular disease risk factors in an adult population in Singapore.\n\nPubMed\n\nLam, Benjamin Chih Chiang; Koh, Gerald Choon Huat; Chen, Cynthia; Wong, Michael Tack Keong; Fallows, Stephen J\n\n2015-01-01\n\nExcess adiposity is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia. Amongst the various measures of adiposity, the best one to help predict these risk factors remains contentious. A novel index of adiposity, the Body Adiposity Index (BAI) was proposed in 2011, and has not been extensively studied in all populations. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to compare the relationship between Body Mass Index (BMI), Waist Circumference (WC), Waist-to-Hip Ratio (WHR), Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR), Body Adiposity Index (BAI) and CVD risk factors in the local adult population. This is a cross sectional study involving 1,891 subjects (Chinese 59.1% Malay 22.2%, Indian 18.7%), aged 21-74 years, based on an employee health screening (2012) undertaken at a hospital in Singapore. Anthropometric indices and CVD risk factor variables were measured, and Spearman correlation, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and multiple logistic regressions were used. BAI consistently had the lower correlation, area under ROC and odd ratio values when compared with BMI, WC and WHtR, although differences were often small with overlapping 95% confidence intervals. After adjusting for BMI, BAI did not further increase the odds of CVD risk factors, unlike WC and WHtR (for all except hypertension and low high density lipoprotein cholesterol). When subjects with the various CVD risk factors were grouped according to established cut-offs, a BMI of â¥23.0 kg/m2 and/or WHtR â¥0.5 identified the highest proportion for all the CVD risk factors in both genders, even higher than a combination of BMI and WC. BAI may function as a measure of overall adiposity but it is unlikely to be better than BMI. A combination of BMI and WHtR could have the best clinical utility in identifying patients with CVD risk factors in an adult population in Singapore.\n\nBody mass index, waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, and glucose intolerance in Chinese and Europid adults in Newcastle, UK.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nUnwin, N; Harland, J; White, M; Bhopal, R; Winocour, P; Stephenson, P; Watson, W; Turner, C; Alberti, K G\n\n1997-01-01\n\nOBJECTIVE: To compare the prevalence of glucose intolerance (impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes), and its relationship to body mass index (BMI) and waist-hip ratio in Chinese and Europid adults. DESIGN: This was a cross sectional study. SETTING: Newcastle upon Tyne. SUBJECTS: These comprised Chinese and Europid men and women, aged 25-64 years, and resident in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Two hour post load plasma glucose concentration, BMI, waist circumference, and waist-hip ratio. METHODS: Population based samples of Chinese and European adults were recruited. Each subject had a standard WHO oral glucose tolerance test. RESULTS: Complete data were available for 375 Chinese and 610 Europid subjects. The age adjusted prevalences of glucose intolerance in Chinese and Europid men were 13.0% (p = 0.04). Mean BMIs were lower in Chinese men (23.8 v 26.1) and women (23.5 v 26.1) than in the Europids (p values < 0.001), as were waist circumferences (men, 83.3 cm v 90.8, p < 0.001; women, 77.3 cm v 79.2, p < 0.05). Mean waist-hip ratios were lower in Chinese men (0.90 v 0.91, p = 0.02) but higher in Chinese women (0.84 v 0.78, p < 0.001) compared with Europids. In both Chinese and Europid adults, higher BMI, waist circumference, and waist-hip ratio were associated with glucose intolerance. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of glucose intolerance in Chinese men and women, despite lower BMIs, is similar to or higher than that in local Europid men and women and intermediate between levels found in China and those in Mauritius. It is suggested that an increase in mean BMI to the levels in the Europid population will be associated with a substantial increase in glucose intolerance in Chinese people.

Using WHR and other parameters, the authors attempted to investigate chronologic changes in perceptions of the attractive female figure in Korean society, differences between Asian and Western societies in this respect, and changes in attractiveness with respect to body mass index (BMI) and age in the general female Korean population. The authors analyzed the anthropometric measurements of 227 Miss Korea winners between 1971 and 2007, 60 candidates of the 2007 Miss Korea contest, 36 candidates of the 2007 Miss France contest, and 1785 normal women in the general population. In the Miss Korea winners' group, the WHR tended toward 0.7. The WHR of the 2007 Miss Korea candidates was statistically smaller than the WHR of the 2007 Miss France candidates. The WHR of normal women was statistically larger than WHR of the 2000s Miss Korea winners. In all age groups of normal women, subjects with a low BMI were not significantly different from the 2000s Miss Koreas in terms of waist circumference, but they had a relatively larger hip circumference. Moreover, subjects with a normal BMI had waist circumferences that were similar to those of the 2000s Miss Koreas but relatively larger hip circumferences, and subjects with high BMI had larger waist and hip circumferences than the 2000s Miss Koreas. The perceived attractive female figure in Asia has moved toward the universally accepted ideal WHR. However, there were still some differences between Asian and Western societies in the concept of ideal body figure. Also, a significant difference in body contour was observed between normal women and the ideal figure. This is because hip volume decreases and waist volume increases with age, although waist and hip volumes increase with BMI.\n\nBody mass index, waist circumference and waist-to-hip-ratio in the prediction of obesity in Turkish teenagers.\n\nPubMed\n\nKavak, Vatan; Pilmane, Mara; Kazoka, Dzintra\n\n2014-06-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to identify the usefulness of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) in screening for obesity in teenagers by using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC). To select the sample set in this cross-sectional study, a stratified random sampling approach was utilized. Weight, height, WC, hip circumference and body fat percentage (BFP) were measured in 1118 children of both genders (597 boys and 521 girls), aged from 10 to 15 years old. Percentiles of BMI and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-United States (CDC-US)-growth chart for boys and girls aged from 10 to 15 years old were presented. ROC analyses were then used to evaluate the performances of three anthropometric indices; BMI, WC and WHR had strong positive correlations with BFP (r = 0.49-0.77) in both girls and boys within indicated age group. The area under the curves (AUCs) were high in both girls and boys for BMI, 0.795 and 0.893, respectively, and WC, 0.767 and 0.853, respectively, and were a little lower, 0.747 and 0.783, respectively, for WHR. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the prevalence of being overweight and obese among teenagers of both sexes in our data set does not differ from CDC-US-growth chart. In addition, BMI and WC are two important predictors for teenagers to become overweight and obese, while WHR is less useful for this purpose.\n\n\"Is there an Association Between Self-Reported Sleep Duration, Body Mass Index and Waist-Hip Ratio in Young Adults? A Cross-Sectional Pilot Study\".\n\nPubMed\n\nKamath, M Ganesh; Prakash, Jay; Dash, Sambit; Chowdhury, Sudipta; Ahmed, Zuhilmi Bin; Yusof, Muhammad Zaim Zharif Bin Mohd\n\n2014-09-01\n\nSleep is vital for mental and physical health of an individual. Duration of sleep influences the metabolism and regulates body weight. To assess the cross-sectional association of sleep duration with body mass index (BMI) and waist-hip ratio in Malaysian students. Eighty-nine Malaysian students of both genders, and with a mean (standard deviation) age of 21.2 (0.9) years were included. Institutional Ethics Committee clearance was obtained prior to the start of study. The subjects were interviewed regarding the average hours of sleep/day, their self-reported sleep duration was categorized as < 6hour/day (short sleep duration), 6-7hour/day and > 7hour/day. Their height (in meters), weight (in kilograms), waist and hip circumference (in centimetre) were measured. BMI and waist-hip ratio were calculated using appropriate formulas and expressed as mean (standard deviation). The duration of sleep was compared with BMI and waist-hip ratio using one way ANOVA. No statistical significance was observed when sleep duration was associated with BMI (p=0.65) and waist-hip ratio (p=0.95). Duration of sleep did not affect BMI and waist hip ratio in the Malaysian students in our study. The age and healthy lifestyle of the subjects in this study may have been a reason for no significant influence of short sleep duration on the BMI and waist-hip ratio. No association was found between sleep duration with BMI and waist hip ratio in the Malaysian students.\n\nAssociation of pasta consumption with body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio: results from Moli-sani and INHES studies\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPounis, G; Castelnuovo, A Di; Costanzo, S; Persichillo, M; Bonaccio, M; Bonanni, A; Cerletti, C; Donati, M B; de Gaetano, G; Iacoviello, L\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground/Objectives: Pasta as a traditional component of Mediterranean diet (MeD) in Italy has not been studied in detail in the management of body weight. This study aimed at evaluating the association of pasta intake with body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio, in two large epidemiological datasets. Subjects/Methods: A total of 14â402 participants aged â©¾35 years randomly recruited from the general population of the Molise region (Moli-sani cohort) and 8964 participants aged >18 years from all over Italy (Italian Nutrition & HEalth Survey, INHES) were separately analyzed. The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-food frequency questionnaire and one 24-h dietary recall were used for dietary assessment. Weight, height, waist and hip circumference were measured in Moli-sani or self-reported in INHES. Residuals methodology corrected for either total energy intake or body weight was used for the analysis of pasta intake. Results: Higher pasta intake was associated with better adhesion to MeD in both genders (P for both<0.001). In the Moli-sani study, after multivariable analysis, pasta-energy residuals were negatively associated with BMI in women but not in men (Î²-coef=â0.007, P=0.003 for women and Î²-coef=â0.001, P=0.58 for men). When pasta intake-body weight residuals were used, pasta intake was significantly and negatively associated with BMI in crude and multi-adjusted models (including adhesion to MeD) in both genders and Moli-sani and INHES studies (for all Î²-coef<0, P<0.05). In the Moli-sani study, pasta-body weight residuals were significantly and negatively associated with waist and hip circumference and waist-to-hip ratio (for all Î²-coef<0, P<0.05). Conclusions: As a traditional component of MeD, pasta consumption was negatively associated with BMI, waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio and with a lower prevalence of overweight and obesity.

The objective of this study is to examine the discriminative abilities of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and waist-hip ratio (WHR) to predict two or more non-adipose components of the metabolic syndrome (high blood pressure, hypertriglyceridemia, low high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and high fasting plasma glucose) among the adult Malaysian population by gender, age group and ethnicity. Data from 2572 respondents (1044 men and 1528 women) aged 25-64 years who participated in the Non Communicable Disease Surveillance 2005/2006, a population-based cross sectional study, were analysed. Participants' socio-demographic details, anthropometric indices (BMI, WC and WHR), blood pressure, fasting lipid profile and fasting glucose level were assessed. Receiver operating characteristics curves analysis was used to evaluate the ability of each anthropometric index to discriminate MetS cases from non-MetS cases based on the area under the curve. Overall, WC had better discriminative ability than WHR for women but did not perform significantly better than BMI in both sexes, whereas BMI was better than WHR in women only. Waist circumference was a better discriminator of MetS compared to WHR in Malay men and women. Waist circumference and BMI performed better than WHR in Chinese women, men aged 25-34 years and women aged 35-44 years. The discriminative ability of BMI and WC is better than WHR for predicting two or more non-adipose components of MetS. Therefore, either BMI or WC measurements are recommended in screening for metabolic syndrome in routine clinical practice in the effort to combat cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes mellitus.

This study aimed to assess the extent of agreement between these parameters and the body mass index (BMI), as anthropometric parameters and in classifying cardio-metabolic risk in HIV/AIDS patients. Methods A secondary analysis of data from a cross-sectional study involving 200 HIV/AIDS patients was done. Anthropometric parameters were measured from participants using standard guidelines and central obesity defined according to recommended criteria. Increased cardio-metabolic risk was defined according to the standard cut-off values for all four parameters. Data were analyzed using STATA version 14.1. Results The prevalence of WC-defined central obesity, WHR-defined central obesity and WHtR > 0.50 were 33.5%, 44.5% and 36.5%, respectively. The prevalence of BMI-defined overweight and obesity was 40.5%. After adjusting for gender and HAART status, there was a significant linear association and correlation between WC and BMI (regression equation: WC (cm) = 37.184 + 1.756 BMI (Kg/m2) + 0.825 Male + 1.002 HAART, (p < 0.001, r = 0.65)), and between WHtR and BMI (regression equation: WHtR = 0.223 + 0.011 BMI (Kg/m2)â 0.0153 Male + 0.003 HAART, (p < 0.001, r = 0.65)), but not between WHR and BMI (p = 0.097, r = 0.13). There was no agreement between the WC, WHtR and BMI, and minimal agreement between the WHR and BMI, in identifying patients with an increased cardio-metabolic risk. Conclusion Despite the observed linear association and correlation between these anthropometric parameters, the routine use of WC, WHR and WHtR as better predictors of cardio-metabolic risk should be encouraged in these patients, due to their minimal agreement with BMI in identifying HIV/AIDS patients with increased cardio\n\nPatterns of subcutaneous fat deposition and the relationship between body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio: implications for models of physical attractiveness.\n\nPubMed\n\nCornelissen, Piers L; ToveÃ©, Martin J; Bateson, Melissa\n\n2009-02-07\n\nBody mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) are two widely used anthropometric indices of body shape argued to convey different information about health and fertility. Both indices have also been shown to affect attractiveness ratings of female bodies. However, BMI and WHR are naturally positively correlated, complicating studies designed to identify their relative importance in predicting health and attractiveness outcomes. We show that the correlation between BMI and WHR depends on the assumed model of subcutaneous fat deposition. An additive model, whereby fat is added to the waist and hips at a constant rate, predicts a correlation between BMI and WHR because with increasing fat, the difference between the waist and hips becomes smaller relative to total width. This model is supported by longitudinal and cross-sectional data. We parameterized the function relating WHR to BMI for white UK females of reproductive age, and used this function to statistically decompose body shape into two independent components. We show that judgements of the attractiveness of female bodies are well explained by the component of curvaceousness related to BMI but not by residual curvaceousness. Our findings resolve a long-standing dispute in the attractiveness literature by confirming that although WHR appears to be an important predictor of attractiveness, this is largely explained by the direct effect of total body fat on WHR, thus reinforcing the conclusion that total body fat is the primary determinant of female body shape attractiveness.\n\nWaist-to-hip ratio and body mass index as risk factors for cardiovascular events in CKD.\n\nPubMed\n\nElsayed, Essam F; Tighiouart, Hocine; Weiner, Daniel E; Griffith, John; Salem, Deeb; Levey, Andrew S; Sarnak, Mark J\n\n2008-07-01\n\nThe role of obesity as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is poorly understood. Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is less influenced by muscle and bone mass than body mass index (BMI). We compared WHR and BMI as risk factors for cardiac events (myocardial infarction and fatal coronary disease) in persons with CKD. Cohort study. Persons with CKD, defined as baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate of 15 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), drawn from 2 community studies: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study and the Cardiovascular Health Study. WHR, waist circumference, and BMI. Myocardial infarction and fatal coronary heart disease. Of 1,669 participants with CKD, mean age was 70.3 years and 56% were women. Mean (SD) WHRs were 0.97 +/- 0.08 in men and 0.90 +/- 0.07 in women; mean (SD) BMI was 27.2 +/- 4.6 kg/m(2). During a mean of 9.3 years of follow-up, there were 334 cardiac events. In multivariable-adjusted Cox models, the highest WHR group (n = 386) was associated with an increased risk of cardiac events compared with the lowest WHR group (hazard ratio, 1.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.83). Obesity, defined as BMI greater than 30 kg/m(2) (n = 381), was not associated with cardiac events (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.62 to 1.20) in comparison to participants with normal BMI (<25 kg/m(2)). Results with waist circumference were similar to those with BMI. Absence of a gold standard for measurement of visceral fat. WHR, but not BMI, is associated with cardiac events in persons with CKD. Relying exclusively on BMI may underestimate the importance of obesity as a cardiovascular disease risk factor in persons with CKD.\n\nThe Independent Associations between Walk ScoreÂ® and Neighborhood Socioeconomic Status, Waist Circumference, Waist-To-Hip Ratio and Body Mass Index Among Urban Adults.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcCormack, Gavin R; Blackstaffe, Anita; Nettel-Aguirre, Alberto; Csizmadi, Ilona; Sandalack, Beverly; Uribe, Francisco Alaniz; Rayes, Afrah; Friedenreich, Christine; Potestio, Melissa L\n\n2018-06-11\n\nBackground : Environmental and policy factors can influence weight status via facilitating or discouraging physical activity and healthy diet. Despite mixed evidence, some findings suggest that the neighborhood built environment, including “walkability”, is associated with overweight and obesity. Most of these findings have measured body mass index (BMI), yet other weight status measures including waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-hip (W-H) ratio are also predictive of health outcomes, independent of BMI. Our study aim was to estimate the associations between walkability, measured using Walk Score ® , and each of WC, W-H ratio, and BMI among urban Canadian adults. Methods : In 2014, n = 851 adults recruited from 12 structurally and socioeconomic diverse neighborhoods (Calgary, Alberta, Canada) provided complete data on a physical activity, health and demographic questionnaire and self-reported anthropometric measures (i.e., height and weight, WC and hip circumference). Anthropometric data were used to estimate WC, W-H ratio, and BMI which were categorized into low and high risk in relation to their potential adverse effect on health. WC and BMI were also combined to provide a proxy measure of both overall and abdominal adiposity. Multivariable logistic regression models estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between each weight status outcome and Walk Score ® . Results : A one-unit increase in Walk Score ® was associated with lower odds of being high-risk based on WC (OR = 0.99; 95%CI 0.97â»0.99). Notably, those residing in socioeconomically disadvantage neighborhoods had significantly higher odds of being high risk based on WC, BMI, and WC-BMI combined compared with advantaged neighborhoods. Conclusions : Interventions that promote healthy weight through the design of neighborhoods that support and enhance the effect of physical activity and diet-related interventions could have a significant\n\nFrequency of soup intake is inversely associated with body mass index, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio, but not with other metabolic risk factors in Japanese men.\n\nPubMed\n\nKuroda, Motonaka; Ohta, Masanori; Okufuji, Tatsuya; Takigami, Chieko; Eguchi, Masafumi; Hayabuchi, Hitomi; Ikeda, Masaharu\n\n2011-01-01\n\nSeveral previous studies have shown that the intake of soup negatively correlates with the body mass index (BMI), serum cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels, and blood pressure, suggesting that soup intake reduces metabolic risk. However, the correlation between soup intake and various metabolic risk factors has not been well-established. Especially, it has not been investigated in Asian countries. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of the frequency of soup intake and metabolic risk factors such as BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, serum cholesterol, serum triacylglycerol, blood glucose, and glycated hemoglobin. A cross-sectional study of 103 Japanese men aged 24 to 75 years was conducted. The intake of soup and other food was investigated by semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires. The correlation between the frequency of soup intake and metabolic risk factors was analyzed by multiple regression analysis with a linear model. The median value of frequency of soup intake was 7.0 times per week. After adjusting for confounding factors such as age, energy intake, energy from alcohol intake, current smoking, and estimated energy expenditure, the frequency of soup intake was found to have a significant inverse association with BMI (P=0.040), waist circumference (P=0.024), and waist-to-hip ratio (P=0.001). However, no significant associations with other metabolic risk factors were found. Frequency of soup intake is negatively correlated with obesity-related physical parameters in Japanese men.

The results of studies regarding superiority of waist circumference (WC) to body mass index (BMI) are inconsistent. This study designed to compare the ability of different anthropometric measures in predicting diabetes and to determine their optimal cut-off values. A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted with 1,000 representative sample among adults aged 20-80 years in Babol, the Northern Iran. The demographic data were collected in a household survey, and the anthropometric measures of weight, height, waist, and hip circumference were measured with a standard method. Fasting blood sugar (FBS) â¥126 mg/dl was considered as diabetes. receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to estimate the predictive ability of different anthropometric indexes and their optimal cut-off values for high FBS. The overall prevalence rate of diabetes was 14.0% (14.4% in men vs. 13.5% in women, P = 0.65). The prevalence rate was significantly higher in older age (>60 years), low educated and obese (P = 0.001). The mean of BMI, WC, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) were significantly higher among diabetic in both sexes (P = 0.001). Among men, WC (area under the ROC curve [AUC] =0.64) and WHtR (AUC = 0.63) have slightly higher accuracy index compared with BMI (AUC = 0.62) or WHR (AUC = 0.60). In contrast, among women, WHtR (AUC = 0.69) and WC (AUC = 0.68) yielded slightly better predictive than BMI (AUC = 0.67). The optimal cut-off values obtained for BMI and WHtR were similar between two sexes (BMI = 24.95 kg/m(2) for men and BMI = 25.2 kg/m(2) for women, WHtR = 0.51 for both sexes) whereas the optimal cut-off value for WC was higher in men than women (98.5 cm men vs. 89.5 cm women). Overall WC and WHtR exhibited a slightly better discriminate performance than BMI for diabetes in both sexes, particularly in women.\n\nBody mass index, waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio cut-off points for categorisation of obesity among Omani Arabs.\n\nPubMed\n\nAl-Lawati, Jawad A; Jousilahti, Pekka\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThere are no data on optimal cut-off points to classify obesity among Omani Arabs. The existing cut-off points were obtained from studies of European populations. To determine gender-specific optimal cut-off points for body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) associated with elevated prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk among Omani Arabs. A community-based cross-sectional study. The survey was conducted in the city of Nizwa in Oman in 2001. The study contained a probabilistic random sample of 1421 adults aged > or =20 years. Prevalent CVD risk was defined as the presence of at least two of the following three risk factors: hyperglycaemia, hypertension and dyslipidaemia. Logistic regression and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were used to determine optimal cut-off points for BMI, WC and WHR in relation to the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity. Over 87% of Omanis had at least one CVD risk factor (38% had hyperglycaemia, 19% hypertension and 34.5% had high total cholesterol). All three indices including BMI (AUC = 0.766), WC (AUC = 0.772) and WHR (AUC = 0.767) predicted prevalent CVD risk factors equally well. The optimal cut-off points for men and women respectively were 23.2 and 26.8 kg m-2 for BMI, 80.0 and 84.5 cm for WC, and 0.91 and 0.91 for WHR. To identify Omani subjects of Arab ethnicity at high risk of CVD, cut-off points lower than currently recommended for BMI, WC and WHR are needed for men while higher cut-off points are suggested for women.\n\nWaist-to-hip ratio is better at predicting subclinical atherosclerosis than body mass index and waist circumference in postmenopausal women.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Hyun Jung; Hwang, Soon Young; Hong, Ho Cheol; Ryu, Ja Young; Seo, Ji A; Kim, Sin Gon; Kim, Nan Hee; Choi, Dong Seop; Baik, Sei Hyun; Choi, Kyung Mook; Yoo, Hye Jin\n\n2015-03-01\n\nBody fat distribution becomes more central after menopause. Although some studies have identified the superiority of various anthropometric indices to assess general health outcomes, very limited studies have compared the efficacy of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) to predict subclinical atherosclerosis according to menopausal status. In total, 442 participants (209 premenopausal women and 233 postmenopausal women) were prospectively enrolled from the Health Promotion Center of Korea University Guro Hospital. We examined subclinical atherosclerosis using carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV). In premenopausal women, all anthropometric parameters such as BMI, WC and WHR were positively correlated with baPWV and CIMT values, whereas in postmenopausal women, only WHR was positively correlated with baPWV values (0.27, P<0.01), and WC and WHR were positively correlated with CIMT (0.15, P<0.05 and 0.21, P<0.01, respectively). By receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses, WHR was superior to the other anthropometric indices to predict carotid atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women. Furthermore, the normal weight (BMI<23kg/m(2)) with higher WHR group had a significantly thicker CIMT when compared to the normal weight with lower WHR group (0.76mm vs. 0.68mm, P<0.01) and even the overweight subjects with BMIâ¥23kg/m(2) (0.76mm vs. 0.70mm, P<0.01) in postmenopausal women. The present study shows that WHR has the best potential for predicting subclinical atherosclerosis compared to BMI and WC in postmenopausal women. NCT01594710. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We studied the association between waist to hip ratio (an indirect measure of visceral fat stores) on upper and lower extremities strength. 1741 individuals aged â¥65 participated in this study. The data was obtained from the Toledo Study for Healthy Aging. For each gender, we studied the relationship between the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), body mass index (BMI) and regional muscle strength (grip, shoulder, knee and hip) using multivariate linear regression and kernel regression statistical models. WHR was higher in men than in women (0.98Â Â±Â 0.07 vs. 0.91Â Â±Â 0.08, respectively, PÂ <Â 0.05). In women with high WHR, we observed a decrease in strength especially in those with a normal BMI. As the WHR lowered, the strength increased regardless of the BMI. In men, lower strength was generally related to the lowest and highest WHR's. Maximum strength in men corresponded at a WHR around 1 and the highest BMI. Muscle strength depends on the joined distribution of WHR and BMI according to gender. In consequence, sex, WHR and BMI should be analyzed conjointly to study the relationship among fat distribution, weight and muscle strength.\n\nAbdominal Obesity Indicators: Waist Circumference or Waist-to-hip Ratio in Malaysian Adults Population.\n\nPubMed\n\nAhmad, Norfazilah; Adam, Samia Ibrahim Mohamed; Nawi, Azmawati Mohammed; Hassan, Mohd Rohaizat; Ghazi, Hasanain Faisal\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWaist circumference (WC) is an accurate and simple measure of abdominal obesity as compared to waist-hip ratio (WHR). The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between body mass index (BMI) with WC and WHR and suggest cutoff points for WC among Rural Malaysian adults. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 669 respondents from three villages in Tanjung Karang, located in the district of Kuala Selangor. Data collection was carried out by guided questionnaires and anthropometric measures. The prevalence of abdominal obesity for BMI was almost similar for both gender across Caucasian and Asian BMI cutoff points. Based on Caucasian cutoff points, the prevalence of abdominal obesity for WC was 23.8% (male) and 66.4% (female) while for WHR was 6.2% (male) and 54.2% (female). Asian cutoff points gave higher prevalence of abdominal obesity compared to that of WC among male respondents and WHR for both genders. WC showed strong and positive correlation with BMI compared to WHR (in male WC r = 0.78, WHR r = 0.24 and in female WC r = 0.72, WHR r = 0.19; P < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis suggested WC cutoff points of 92.5 cm in men and 85.5 cm in women is the optimal number for detection of abdominal obesity. WC is the best indicator as compared with WHR for abdominal obesity for Malaysian adults.\n\nWaist-hip Ratio (WHR), a Better Predictor for Prostate Cancer than Body Mass Index (BMI): Results from a Chinese Hospital-based Biopsy Cohort.\n\nPubMed\n\nTang, Bo; Han, Cheng-Tao; Zhang, Gui-Ming; Zhang, Cui-Zhu; Yang, Wei-Yi; Shen, Ying; Vidal, Adriana C; Freedland, Stephen J; Zhu, Yao; Ye, Ding-Wei\n\n2017-03-08\n\nTo investigate whether waist-hip ratio (WHR) is a better predictor of prostate cancer (PCa) incidence than body mass index (BMI) in Chinese men. Of consecutive patients who underwent prostate biopsies in one tertiary center between 2013 and 2015, we examined data on 1018 with PSA â¤20âng/ml. Clinical data and biopsy outcomes were collected. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the associations between BMI, WHR and PCa incidence. Area under the ROC (AUC) was used to evaluate the accuracy of different prognostic models. A total of 255 men and 103 men were diagnosed with PCa and high grade PCa (HGPCa, Gleason score â¥8). WHR was an independent risk factor for both PCa (ORâ=â1.07 95%Cl 1.03-1.11) and HGPCa (ORâ=â1.14 95%Cl 1.09-1.19) detection, while BMI had no relationship with either PCa or HGPCa detection. Adding WHR to a multivariable model increased the AUC for detecting HGPCa from 0.66 (95%Cl 0.60-0.72) to 0.71 (95%Cl 0.65-0.76). In this Chinese cohort, WHR was significantly predictive of PCa and HGPCa. Adding WHR to a multivariable model increased the diagnostic accuracy for detecting HGPCa. If confirmed, including WHR measurement may improve PCa and HGPCa detection.\n\nWaist-hip Ratio (WHR), a Better Predictor for Prostate Cancer than Body Mass Index (BMI): Results from a Chinese Hospital-based Biopsy Cohort\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTang, Bo; Han, Cheng-Tao; Zhang, Gui-Ming; Zhang, Cui-Zhu; Yang, Wei-Yi; Shen, Ying; Vidal, Adriana C.; Freedland, Stephen J.; Zhu, Yao; Ye, Ding-Wei\n\n2017-01-01\n\nTo investigate whether waist-hip ratio (WHR) is a better predictor of prostate cancer (PCa) incidence than body mass index (BMI) in Chinese men.

The Filipino Americans (NÂ =Â 108) were recruited from a primary care clinic in the United States. Two instruments were used to collect and operationalize the variables, specifically: (1) Socioeconomic/Demographic Questionnaire and (2) A Short Acculturation Scale for Filipino Americans. Descriptive statistics and partial least squares were used to calculate the results. The partial least square path model identified acculturation as a predictor of body mass index, wait circumference, and waist-hip ratio among Filipino Americans. The positive path coefficient (Î²Â =Â 0.384) was statistically significant (tÂ =Â 5.92, PÂ <Â .001). Health care providers need to stress the importance of the degree of acculturation when developing culturally appropriate lifestyle and health promotion interventions among immigrant patients with hypertension.

No study has been specifically focused on waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-hip-ratio (WHR). The aim of this prospective case-control study is to evaluate the association between CTS and WC, WHR and other body and hand anthropometric measures. We consecutively enrolled one \"idiopathic\" CTS case for two controls in 3 outpatient electromyography labs. The main anthropometric measures were BMI, WC, WHR, wrist ratio (WR) and hand ratio (HR). We performed univariate and multivariate analyses. Female cases and controls were 250 and 474 and male cases and controls were 120 and 273, respectively. At univariate analysis there were differences in many anthropometric measures between cases and controls. At multivariate logistic regression analyses high BMI, WC and WHR and abnormal HR and WR were independent risk factors for CTS. Crossing two categories between BMI, WC and WHR, the overweight subjects, especially females, were at risk only if they had very high WC or high WHR. The risk increased if they were obese. High WC/WHR doubles the risk of CTS, the risk further increased if overweight/obese subjects have also very high WC or high WHR. The obese subjects were always at risk regardless of WC and WHR values. Metabolic causes of this association with CTS were hypothesised. BMI is not the only and most powerful body predictor of \"idiopathic\" CTS, but also WHR and WC should be considered. These measures may not be interchangeable and it may be desirable to consider the utility of their joint use. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Such reference data are lacking for Greek adolescents. The aim of this study was to develop age- and gender-specific WC, WHR and WHtR smoothed reference percentiles for abdominal obesity among Greek adolescents aged 12-17 years, to investigate possible obesity cut-offs of WHR and WHtR and to compare WC percentiles to other adolescent populations. A representative sample of 1610 high school adolescents (42.2% boys, 57.8% girls; mean ageâÂ±âsd 14.4âÂ±â1.72 years) participated in this cross-sectional study in Attica, Greece, in 2013. Weight, height, body mass index (BMI), WC, hip circumference (HC), WHR and WHtR were measured and percentiles were calculated using the LMS method. The relation between WHR, WHtR and general obesity, as defined by the International Obesity Task Force, was investigated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The discriminating power of WHR and WHtR was expressed as area under the curve (AUC). Greek adolescents' WC measurements at the 50th and 90th percentile were compared with their counterparts' smoothed percentiles from Norway, Turkey, Poland, South India, Germany and Kuwait. Boys had significantly higher mean in all measures than girls, except for BMI where there was no statistical difference in terms of gender. BMI, WC and HC showed an increasing trend with age. WC leveled off in both genders at the age of 17 years. WHR and WHtR showed a continuous decrease with advancing age. WHtR was a better predictor for general obesity in both boys and girls (AUC 95% CI 0.945-0.992) than the WHR (AUC 95% CI 0.758-0.870); the WHtR cut-off of 0.5 had sensitivity 91% and specificity 95% for both genders and all age groups combined. International comparisons showed that Greek adolescents had relatively high levels of abdominal obesity in early-middle adolescence but this did not persist at\n\nRelationship of early pregnancy waist to hip ratio versus body mass index with gestational diabetes and insulin resistance\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBasraon, Sanmaan K.; Mele, Lisa; Myatt, Leslie; Roberts, James M.; Hauth, John C.; Leveno, Kenneth J.; Varner, Michael W.; Wapner, Ronald J.; Thorp, John M.; Peaceman, Alan M.; Ramin, Susan M.; Sciscione, Anthony; Tolosa, Jorge E.; Sorokin, Yoram\n\n2017-01-01\n\nObjective To determine the risk of gestational diabetes (GDM) and insulin resistance (IR) in obesity defined by body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) or both combined. Methods Secondary analysis of a randomized multicenter trial of antioxidant supplementation versus placebo in nulliparous low-risk women to prevent pregnancy associated hypertension. Women between 9â16 weeks with data for WHR and BMI were analyzed for GDM (n=2300). Those with fasting glucose and insulin between 22â26 weeks (n=717) were analyzed for IR by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; normalâ¤75thpercentile). WHR and BMI were categorized as normal (WHR<0.80; BMI<25kg/m2); overweight (WHR:0.8â0.84; BMI:25â29.9kg/m2); and obese (WHRâ¥0.85; BMIâ¥30kg/m2). ROC curves and logistic regression models were used. Results Compared with normal, the risks of GDM or IR were higher in obese by BMI or WHR. The subgroup with obesity by WHR but not by BMI had no increased risk of GDM. BMI was a better predictor of IR (AUC-0.71(BMI), 0.65(WHR), p=0.03) but similar to WHR for GDM (AUC-0.68(BMI), 0.63(WHR), p=0.18. Conclusion Increased WHR and BMI in early pregnancy are associated with IR and GDM. BMI is a better predictor of IR compared with WHR. Adding WHR to BMI does not improve its ability to detect GDM or IR.

Ninety obese Japanese children, 55 boys and 35 girls, who visited our University Clinic, were enrolled. The age was 9.92Â±2.6 (meanÂ±SD) years, and the percentage overweight (POW) was 51.6Â±18.8%. We set the power value of the hip/height P 0, 0.5, 0.8, 1, 1.5, and 2 and studied the association with overweight indices, biochemical data, and fat area measured by computed tomography. Waist, waist/height ratio, and waist/hip ratio were also evaluated. Hip/height and hip/height 0.8 (BAIp) were more closely correlated with POW, body mass index percentile, and percentage body fat than hip/height 1.5 (BAI). The correlation coefficient of hip/height with POW (r =0.855) was the highest among the studied hip/height P indices. The approximate line to predict POW was 411Ãhip/height-207. The waist/height was also highly correlated with POW (r=0.879). Hip and hip/height 0.5 were more closely correlated with visceral fat area than hip/height, BAIp, and hip/height 1.5 . Hip and hip/height 0.5 were significantly correlated with insulin. Only hip was also significantly associated with dyslipidemia. All hip/height P indices were not significantly correlated with alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Waist was significantly correlated with serum lipids, ALT, and insulin. Hip/height and BAIp are better markers for overweight (adiposity) in obese children than BAI. However, hip/height, BAIp, and BAI are not useful to predict metabolic complications. Waist appears to be the best index for obese children overall at this time.\n\nGenome-wide association studies in East Asians identify new loci for waist-hip ratio and waist circumference\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWen, Wanqing; Kato, Norihiro; Hwang, Joo-Yeon; Guo, Xingyi; Tabara, Yasuharu; Li, Huaixing; Dorajoo, Rajkumar; Yang, Xiaobo; Tsai, Fuu-Jen; Li, Shengxu; Wu, Ying; Wu, Tangchun; Kim, Soriul; Guo, Xiuqing; Liang, Jun; Shungin, Dmitry; Adair, Linda S.; Akiyama, Koichi; Allison, Matthew; Cai, Qiuyin; Chang, Li-Ching; Chen, Chien-Hsiun; Chen, Yuan-Tsong; Cho, Yoon Shin; Choi, Bo Youl; Gao, Yutang; Go, Min Jin; Gu, Dongfeng; Han, Bok-Ghee; He, Meian; Hixson, James E.; Hu, Yanling; Huang, Tao; Isono, Masato; Jung, Keum Ji; Kang, Daehee; Kim, Young Jin; Kita, Yoshikuni; Lee, Juyoung; Lee, Nanette R.; Lee, Jeannette; Wang, Yiqin; Liu, Jian-Jun; Long, Jirong; Moon, Sanghoon; Nakamura, Yasuyuki; Nakatochi, Masahiro; Ohnaka, Keizo; Rao, Dabeeru; Shi, Jiajun; Sull, Jae Woong; Tan, Aihua; Ueshima, Hirotsugu; Wu, Chen; Xiang, Yong-Bing; Yamamoto, Ken; Yao, Jie; Ye, Xingwang; Yokota, Mitsuhiro; Zhang, Xiaomin; Zheng, Yan; Qi, Lu; Rotter, Jerome I.; Jee, Sun Ha; Lin, Dongxin; Mohlke, Karen L.; He, Jiang; Mo, Zengnan; Wu, Jer-Yuarn; Tai, E.

We conducted a meta-analysis of associations of abdominal obesity with approximately 2.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among 53,052 (for WC) and 48,312 (for WHR) individuals of Asian descent, and replicated 33 selected SNPs among 3,762 to 17,110 additional individuals. We identified four novel loci near the EFEMP1, ADAMTSL3 , CNPY2, and GNAS genes that were associated with WC after adjustment for body mass index (BMI); two loci near the NID2 and HLA-DRB5 genes associated with WHR after adjustment for BMI, and three loci near the CEP120, TSC22D2, and SLC22A2 genes associated with WC without adjustment for BMI. Functional enrichment analyses revealed enrichment of corticotropin-releasing hormone signaling, GNRH signaling, and/or CDK5 signaling pathways for those newly-identified loci. Our study provides additional insight on genetic contribution to abdominal obesity.

Higher waist-hip ratio (WHR) and body mass index (BMI) may increase the risk of psoriasis vulgaris, but, to our knowledge, no evidence of the combined effects of HLA-Cw6 and BMI, WHR are available. To evaluate the combined effect of HLA-Cw6, BMI and WHR on psoriasis vaulgaris. The data of 466 patients and 177 controls were investigated and analyzed by a hospital-based case-control study and non-condition logistic regress model. There was a graded positive association of WHR and BMI with psoriasis vulgaris. Compared with a WHR of 0.80 or less than 0.80, the odds ratio (OR) was 2.36 (p < 0.01) for WHR 0.80-0.85, and 2.74 (p < 0.01) for WHR greater than 0.85. Compared with subjects with a BMI of 20 or less than 20, the multivariate OR of psoriasis were 1.20 (p > 0.05) for a BMI of 20-25, 1.84 (p < 0.05) for a BMI of more than 25 corresponding overweight (p for trend, <0.01). We found not only the risk of psoriasis for the individual with HLA-Cw6+ was 8.33 times greater than that for individual with HLA-Cw6(-) but also the risk increased approximately 35 times in individuals with HLA-Cw6+ and a overweight as compared with one with HLA-Cw6(-) and a non-overweight, and 17-fold when the individuals with HLA-Cw6+ and a WHR of more than 0.80 were compared with individuals with HLA-Cw6(-) and a WHR of 0.80 or less than 0.80, displaying the combined effect of HLA-Cw6, BMI and WHR (all p < 001). This study suggested that HLA-Cw6, overweight and higher waist-hip ratio are material risk factors of psoriasis vulgaris, specially the combined effects of HLA-Cw6 and BMI, WHR on psoriasis vulgaris in Chinese population.\n\nValidity of self-measured waist and hip circumferences: results from a community study in Malaysia.\n\nPubMed\n\nReidpath, Daniel D; Cheah, Julius Chee-Ho; Lam, Fui-Ching; Yasin, Shahjahan; Soyiri, Ireneous; Allotey, Pascale\n\n2013-10-05\n\nMeasures of central adiposity are better predictors of adverse health events than BMI. Nonetheless, BMI is more widely used in health research. One reason for this may be the limited research supporting the self-measurement of waist and hip circumference. The lack of validity studies is particularly acute in Asia. The main objective was to establish the validity of self-measurement of waist and hip circumference in a community setting and the correlation of those measures with BMI, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels. A community based, cross-sectional survey. A \"healthy living expo\" at a shopping mall in a rural town on peninsular Malaysia One hundred and thirty six (136) individuals volunteered to participate in the study, 125 of whom met the inclusion criteria. The ethnic distribution of the participants was 80% Chinese, 17% Malay and 3% Indian. Most participants were female (60%), with participants' ages ranging from 18 to 78Â years (mean, 47.2). Self and assisted measurements of waist and hip were taken. Blood pressure, non-fasting blood glucose, height, and weight were also measured. Bland Altman plots and Lin's concordance coefficient were used to measure agreement between self and assisted measures. Pearson's correlation was used to examine the association of self and assisted measures with blood pressure, blood glucose, and BMI. There was a downwards bias in self measured waist (-0.81Â cm) and hip (-1Â cm) circumferences compared with assisted measures. The concordance for the self and assisted measures of waist, hip and the ratio of the two were, respectively, .96, .93 , and .84. The correlation between measures of central adiposity and BMI, blood pressure and blood glucose were similar for self and assisted measures. The results provide additional support for the use of self-measurement of waist and hip circumference studies of central adiposity, but is limited by the specificity of the setting.\n\nRelationship of Early Pregnancy Waist-to-Hip Ratio versus Body Mass Index with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus and Insulin Resistance.\n\nPubMed\n\nBasraon, Sanmaan K; Mele, Lisa; Myatt, Leslie; Roberts, James M; Hauth, John C; Leveno, Kenneth J; Varner, Michael W; Wapner, Ronald J; Thorp, John M; Peaceman, Alan M; Ramin, Susan M; Sciscione, Anthony; Tolosa, Jorge E; Sorokin, Yoram\n\n2016-01-01\n\nTo determine the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and insulin resistance (IR) in obesity defined by body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), or both combined.

The study comprised 41 male and 109 female students, aged 18-20 years. Anthropometric markers of obesity were measured, including body mass index, waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and compared with neck circumference of the same subjects. Overweight and obesity levels were defined by BMI > or = 23.0 and > or = 25.0 respectively. Overall 29.2% males and 25.6% females were found overweight/obese. The mean body mass index was 21.7 kg/m2 in males and 21.0 kg/m2 in females. The mean waist and neck circumferences were higher in males (80.6 cm, and 35.5 cm) than females (78.1 cm, and 31.5 cm). Neck circumference had a strong positive correlation (p<0.001) with other relevant indicators in all subjects, except the waist-to-hip ratio which was applicable on males only. At BMI of 23.0 and 25.0, males had neck circumference 35.7cm and 37.5cm, while females had it at of 32.2cm and 33.5cm respectively. Neck circumference is a potentially useful initial screening tool for overweight/obesity. A neck circumference > or = 35.5 cm in men and > or = 32 cm in women should be considered the cutoff point for overweight/obesity.\n\nFeasibility of body roundness index for identifying a clustering of cardiometabolic abnormalities compared to BMI, waist circumference and other anthropometric indices: the China Health and Nutrition Survey, 2008 to 2009.\n\nPubMed\n\nTian, Simiao; Zhang, Xiuzhi; Xu, Yang; Dong, Huimin\n\n2016-08-01\n\nThe body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) are commonly used anthropometric measures for predicting cardiovascular diseases risk factors, but it is uncertain which specific measure might be the most appropriate predictor of a cluster of cardiometabolic abnormalities (CMA) in Chinese adults. A body shape index (ABSI) and body roundness index (BRI) have been recently developed as alternative anthropometric indices that may better reflect health status. The main aims of this study were to investigate the predictive capacity of ABSI and BRI in identifying various CMA compared to BMI, WC, waist-to-hip ratio (WHpR), and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), and to determine whether there exists a best single predictor of all CMA.We used data from the 2009 wave of the China Health and Nutrition Survey, and the final analysis included 8126 adults aged 18 to 85 years with available fasting blood samples and anthropometric measurements. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were conducted to assess the best anthropometric indices to predict the risk of hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, and metabolic syndrome (MetS). Logistic regression models were fit to evaluate the OR of each CMA according to anthropometric indices.In women, the ROC analysis showed that BRI and WHtR had the best predictive capability in identifying all of CMA (area under the curves [AUCs] ranged from 0.658 to 0.721). In men, BRI and WHtR were better predictor of hypertension, diabetes, and at least 1 CMA (AUC: 0.668, 0.708, and 0.698, respectively), whereas BMI and WC were more sensitive predictor of dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, and MetS. Furthermore, the ABSI showed the lowest AUCs for each CMA. According to the multivariate logistic regression analysis, BRI and WHtR were superior in discriminating hyperuricemia and at least 1 CMA while BMI performed better in predicting hypertension, diabetes, and MetS in women. In men, WC and BRI were the 2 best predictor of all CMA\n\nBody mass index, waist-to-hip ratio and late outcomes: a report from the Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Minlu; Cai, Hui; Bao, Pingping; Xu, Wanghong; Qin, Guoyou; Shu, Xiao Ou; Zheng, Ying\n\n2017-08-01\n\nObesity has been well studied in relation to breast cancer survival. However, the associations of post-diagnosis obesity and late outcomes (â¥5 years after diagnosis) have been much less studied. A total of 4062 5-year disease-free patients were recruited from the Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival Study, a longitudinal study of patients diagnosed during 2002-2006. Cox proportional hazard model with restricted cubic spline were used to evaluate the potential non-linear associations of post-diagnosis body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) with late all-cause mortality and late recurrence. While no significant association was observed for post-diagnosis BMI or WHR with late recurrence; a U-shaped association was observed for the two measures with late all-cause death. Women with BMI of 25.0âkg/m 2 or WHR of 0.83 were at the lowest risk of late all-cause mortality, whereas those with BMI beyond the range of 22.1-28.7âkg/m 2 or WHR beyond the range of 0.81-0.86 had a higher risk. ER, stage or menopausal status did not modify the effect of post-diagnosis BMI or WHR on the outcomes. In conclusion, post-diagnosis BMI and WHR, as indicators of overall and central obesity respectively, were associated with late all-cause mortality in U-shaped pattern among long-term breast cancer survivors.\n\nWaist-to-Hip Ratio versus Body Mass Index as Predictor of Obesity-Related Pregnancy Outcomes.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcDonnold, Mollie; Mele, Lisa M; Myatt, Leslie; Hauth, John C; Leveno, Kenneth J; Reddy, Uma M; Mercer, Brian M\n\n2016-05-01\n\nObjectiveâIn nonpregnant populations the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is a better predictor of obesity-related outcomes than body mass index (BMI). Our objective was to determine, in pregnancy, the relationship between these measures of obesity, and large-for-gestational age (LGA) and cesarean delivery (CD). MethodsâThis is a secondary analysis of data from the Combined Antioxidant and Preeclampsia Prediction Study. Women with a WHR ofââ¥â0.85 and 0.80 to 0.84 at 9 to 16 weeks gestation were compared with those with a WHRâ<â0.80. Women with early pregnancy BMIââ¥â30.0 kg/m(2) (obese) and 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m(2) (overweight) were compared with thoseâ<â25.0 kg/m(2). LGA was defined asâ>â90% by Alexander nomogram. Univariable analysis, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic curves were used. ResultsâData from 2,276 women were analyzed. After correcting for potential confounders, only BMIââ¥â30 was significantly associated with LGA (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.07, 1.35-3.16) while BMI 25.0-29.9 (aOR: 1.5, 0.98-2.28), WHR 0.8-0.84 (aOR: 1.33, 0.83-2.13), and WHRââ¥â0.85 (aOR: 1.05, 0.67-1.65) were not. Risk for CD was increased for women with elevated WHR and with higher BMI compared with normal. ConclusionâWHR is not associated with LGA. While BMI performed better than WHR, neither was a strong predictor of LGA or need for CD in low-risk nulliparous women.

Therefore, anthropometric parameters which are predictive and can simply be assessed at first patient presentation may lead to a better patient selection for ambulatory reflux monitoring. We aimed to examine the association of body mass index (BMI) and waist to hip ratio (WHR) with gastroesophageal reflux activity during 24Â hour-pH-impedance monitoring. Seven hundred and seventy-one patients with GERD symptoms underwent 24Â hour-pH-impedance monitoring and high resolution manometry off proton pump inhibitors. Patients with known primary motility disorders of the esophagus and pre-existing endoscopic or operative procedure on esophagus or stomach were excluded from the study. Reflux parameters and anthropometric and demographic data from our prospectively gathered database were analyzed. We performed univariate and multivariate regression analysis to evaluate the associations of BMI and WHR with reflux parameters measured with 24Â hour-pH-impedance monitoring. WHR showed a significantly stronger association with esophageal acid exposure than BMI (P<.001). Our data show that 6.9% of the percentage of endoluminal pH<4 in the distal esophagus is attributable to WHR. Furthermore, an association of WHR with impaired esophageal acid clearance was observed. Additionally, we observed an inverse relationship between lower esophageal sphincter integrity (P=.05) and esophageal acid exposure. WHR is a better predictor for esophageal acid exposure than BMI. Biomechanical and metabolic mechanisms of central fat distribution may influence reflux parameters in 24Â hour pH impedance monitoring, which may affect patient selection for ambulatory reflux monitoring.

Body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) showed significant correlation with total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. After adjustment for age and BMI, this was also true for WC with TC and TG. There was no such correlation between waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and lipid profile. Hence, WC was a better anthropometric index of fat location than WHR to estimate lipid profile in overweight and obese adult women.\n\nThe cross-sectional relationship between body mass index, waist-hip ratio, and cognitive performance in postmenopausal women enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative.\n\nPubMed\n\nKerwin, Diana R; Zhang, Yinghua; Kotchen, Jane Morley; Espeland, Mark A; Van Horn, Linda; McTigue, Kathleen M; Robinson, Jennifer G; Powell, Lynda; Kooperberg, Charles; Coker, Laura H; Hoffmann, Raymond\n\n2010-08-01\n\nTo determine whether body mass index (BMI) is independently associated with cognitive function in postmenopausal women and the relationship between body fat distribution as estimated by waist-hip ratio (WHR). Cross-sectional data analysis. Baseline data from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) hormone trials. Eight thousand seven hundred forty-five postmenopausal women aged 65 to 79 free of clinical evidence of dementia who completed the baseline evaluation in the WHI hormone trials. Participants completed a Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MSE), health and lifestyle questionnaires, and standardized measurements of height, weight, body circumference, and blood pressure. Statistical analysis was performed of associations between 3MSE score, BMI, and WHR after controlling for known confounders. With the exception of smoking and exercise, vascular disease risk factors, including hypertension, waist measurement, heart disease, and diabetes mellitus, were significantly associated with 3MSE score and were included as covariables in subsequent analyses. BMI was inversely related to 3MSE score; for every 1-unit increase in BMI, 3MSE score decreased 0.988 points (P<.001) after adjusting for age, education, and vascular disease risk factors. BMI had the most pronounced association with poorer cognitive functioning scores in women with smaller waist measurements. In women with the highest WHR, cognitive scores increased with BMI. Higher BMI was associated with poorer cognitive function in women with smaller WHR. Higher WHR, estimating central fat mass, was associated with higher cognitive function in this cross-sectional study. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanism for this association.

We aimed to investigate the relationship between the waist circumference Ã triglyceride index (WT index) and the Coronary Artery Score (CAS) in patients with coronary heart disease. 346 patients in our Cardiology Department were recruited from September 2007 to August 2011 and divided into two groups according to whether the patients presented with metabolic syndrome. We performed coronary angiography using the standard Judkins method. The severity of coronary artery stenosis and the CAS were calculated and analyzed with a computerized quantitative analysis system. The signs index, which includes the body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-hip-ratio, and waist-height-ratio, the blood glucose and blood lipid index of all the patients were collected and used to calculate the WT index (waist circumference x triglyceride index. We performed a correlative analysis with age, gender, body mass index, blood glucose and blood lipid, blood pressure and other risk indicators of all patients as the dependent variables and the CAS as the independent variable. We show that the CAS is positively correlated to the WT index. Several lipid profiles and waist circumference were significantly associated with the CAS. The WT index is correlated to the CAS and is a good predictor for the development of coronary artery disease; it can be applied in the clinic for early intervention in populations at risk for coronary heart disease.\n\nTotal homocysteine is positively correlated with body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, and fat mass among overweight reproductive women: A cross-sectional study.\n\nPubMed\n\nAl-Bayyari, Nahla; Hamadneh, Jehan; Hailat, Rae'd; Hamadneh, Shereen\n\n2017-12-01\n\nConflicting associations between total homocysteine (tHcy), body mass index (BMI) lean body mass, and fat mass in the general population have been reported. We investigated the hypothesis that elevated tHcy levels are associated with increased BMI, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and body fat mass percent. In Jordan, obesity and overweight are prevalent among reproductive women and hyperhomocysteinemia, along with obesity and overweight, are independent risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. The participants used in this cross-sectional study were 325 overweight Jordanian women aged between 18 and 49 years old. The main outcome measures were tHcy, BMI, WHR, fat mass, fat-free mass, and total body water. Serum tHcy was analyzed using a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrophotometry (LC-MS/MS) complete kit. The body compositions were measured using a bioelectrical impedance analyzer. Study participants were stratified according to their tHcy level into two groups, â¤10 Î¼mol/L and >10 Î¼mol/L, and the difference between mean values of body compositions was evaluated. The tHcy was significantly and negatively correlated with age, fat-free mass, and total body water, and significantly and positively correlated with BMI, hip circumference, WHR, fat mass, and dry lean weight. The chi-square and the independent sample t-tests showed statistically significant (P â¤ .05) differences between tHcy and BMI, WHR, fat and fat-free mass, and total body water percentages. In conclusion, BMI, WHR and body fat mass were found to be associated with elevated tHcy levels among overweight reproductive women, and they might be used as independent predictors of the tHcy level.

All subjects underwent genotype analysis of the 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms of the ghrelin gene. Measurements were also taken of blood lipids, glucose, and hormone levels, and calculations of body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were performed to detect hormonal and metabolic phenotypes. No significant diff erences in polymorphism genotypes were found between PCOS patients and healthy controls. However, the frequency of the -501 A/C A allele was significantly higher in the PCOS group than in the control group. PCOS -501 A/C A carriers had significantly higher BMI and WHR than PCOS women with the CC genotype. -604 G/A polymorphisms were not associated with clinical or biochemical characteristics of PCOS. The -501 A/C polymorphism of the ghrelin gene is associated with metabolic features of PCOS in a Chinese population. Â© J. A.

Body mass index (BMI) predicts an increased risk of developing hypertensive disorders and preeclampsia. However, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), as a central obesity index, has not been assessed in predicting this disorder in pregnancy. We assumed that WHR might be more sensitive in predicting the risk of preeclampsia, compared with BMI. The aim of this cohort study was to investigate the relationships of BMI and WHR with preeclampsia. This was a prospective cohort study of 1200 pregnant women with singleton pregnancies. Anthropometric indices included WHR and BMI, which were measured at the first antenatal visit (â©½ 12 weeks of gestational age). The incidence of preeclampsia was assessed after 20 weeks of gestation. Maternal demographic data and obstetric outcomes were also recorded for each subject. All of the statistical tests were performed using SPSS software, version 16. The overall incidence of preeclampsia in the study population was 4.2%. The maternal WHR and BMI at the beginning of pregnancy were significantly associated with the occurrence of preeclampsia (P = 0.006 and P = 0.001, respectively). WHR â©¾ 0.85 and BMI â©¾ 25 kg m(-2) in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy had relative risks of 2.317 (confidence interval (CI): 1.26-4.27) and 3.317 (CI: 1.6-6.86) for preeclampsia. BMI and WHR were anthropometric indicators that presented correlations with preeclampsia. Of these anthropometric indices, BMI had greater predictive value in preeclampsia.\n\nBody mass index and waist-to-height changes during teen years in girls are influenced by childhood body mass index.\n\nPubMed\n\nBiro, Frank M; Huang, Bin; Morrison, John A; Horn, Paul S; Daniels, Steven R\n\n2010-03-01\n\nThis study examined longitudinal changes in waist-to-height ratio and components of body mass index (BMI) among young and adolescent girls of black and white race/ethnicity. Girls were recruited at age 9 years through the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Growth and Health Study (NGHS) and were followed annually over 10 years. Girls were grouped into low (<20(th) percentile), middle, and high (>80(th) percentile) BMI on the basis of race-specific BMI percentile rankings at age 9, and low, middle, and high waist-to-height ratio, on the basis of waist-to-height ratio at age 11. BMI was partitioned into fat mass index (FM) and fat-free mass index (FMI). Girls accrued fat mass at a greater rate than fat-free mass, and the ratio of fat mass to fat-free mass increased from ages 9 through 18. There was a significant increase in this ratio after age at peak height velocity. Participants with elevated BMI and waist-to-height ratios at age 18 tended to have been elevated at ages 9 and 11, respectively. There were strong correlations between BMI at age 9 with several outcomes at age 18: BMI (.76) and FMI (.72), weaker but significant with FFMI (.37), and ratio of fat mass to fat-free mass (.53). In addition, there was significant tracking of elevated BMI from ages 9 through 18. In girls, higher BMI levels during childhood lead to greater waist-to-height ratios and greater than expected changes in BMI by age 18, with disproportionate increases in fat mass. These changes are especially evident in adolescent girls of black race/ethnicity and after the pubertal growth spurt.\n\nOptimal waist-to-hip ratios in women activate neural reward centers in men.\n\nPubMed\n\nPlatek, Steven M; Singh, Devendra\n\n2010-02-05\n\nSecondary sexual characteristics convey information about reproductive potential. In the same way that facial symmetry and masculinity, and shoulder-to-hip ratio convey information about reproductive/genetic quality in males, waist-to-hip-ratio (WHR) is a phenotypic cue to fertility, fecundity, neurodevelopmental resources in offspring, and overall health, and is indicative of \"good genes\" in women. Here, using fMRI, we found that males show activation in brain reward centers in response to naked female bodies when surgically altered to express an optimal (approximately 0.7) WHR with redistributed body fat, but relatively unaffected body mass index (BMI). Relative to presurgical bodies, brain activation to postsurgical bodies was observed in bilateral orbital frontal cortex. While changes in BMI only revealed activation in visual brain substrates, changes in WHR revealed activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, an area associated with reward processing and decision-making. When regressing ratings of attractiveness on brain activation, we observed activation in forebrain substrates, notably the nucleus accumbens, a forebrain nucleus highly involved in reward processes. These findings suggest that an hourglass figure (i.e., an optimal WHR) activates brain centers that drive appetitive sociality/attention toward females that represent the highest-quality reproductive partners. This is the first description of a neural correlate implicating WHR as a putative honest biological signal of female reproductive viability and its effects on men's neurological processing.\n\nThe metabolic syndrome in black hypertensive women--waist circumference more strongly related than body mass index.\n\nPubMed\n\nRheeder, P; Stolk, R P; Veenhouwer, J F; Grobbee, D E\n\n2002-08-01\n\nTo examine the association between measures of obesity and features of the metabolic syndrome in treated black female hypertensive subjects. Cross-sectional study. An urban primary health care centre in Mamelodi, Pretoria. Women with hypertension and without known diabetes mellitus or secondary causes of hypertension. In total 124 women participated, with a mean age of 56.9 years (standard deviation (SD) 11.0) and mean body mass index (BMI) of 34.1 kg/m2 (SD 8.1). Blood pressure, glucose, insulin and lipid levels. Waist circumference and waist-hip ratio were more strongly associated with insulin, uric acid, glucose and triglycerides than was BMI. Statistically significant associations were found between waist circumference and low high-density lipoprotein HDL cholesterol (standardised regression coefficient -0.006, standard error of the mean (SEM) 0.002), log triglycerides (0.007, SEM 0.003), uric acid (0.002, SEM 0.001) and log insulin (0.012, SEM 0.003). BMI was only significantly associated with uric acid (0.002, SEM 0.002) and log insulin (0.009, SEM 0.004). In a group of black hypertensive women measures of central obesity were more strongly associated with components of the metabolic syndrome than BMI.\n\nBody fat percentage, body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio as predictors of mortality and cardiovascular disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nMyint, Phyo Kyaw; Kwok, Chun Shing; Luben, Robert N; Wareham, Nicholas J; Khaw, Kay-Tee\n\n2014-10-01\n\nTo study the utility of body fat percentage in predicting health outcomes when other obesity indices are considered. We conducted a prospective cohort study to evaluate the independent utility of body fat percentage and other obesity indices in predicting mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD). We prospectively followed 15 062 European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk participants who attended a health examination during 1997â2000 for all-cause mortality and incidence of CVD up to end of December 2011 and end of March 2009, respectively. During the follow-up, 2420 died and 4665 had incident CVD. After exclusion of prior stroke, myocardial infarction and cancer and adjusting for potential confounders, body mass index (BMI) and waist-to- hip ratio (WHR), the HR of mortality for men were 0.86 (0.68 to 1.09), 0.81 (0.61 to 1.07) and 0.76 (0.55 to 1.05) and for women were 0.91 (0.70 to 1.17), 0.75 (0.55 to 1.02) and 0.87 (0.61 to 1.23) for second, third and fourth quartile compared with the first (bottom) quartile of body fat percentage. The respective HRs for incident CVD were 0.99 (0.83 to 1.19), 0.85 (0.69 to 1.04) and 0.81 (0.64 to 1.03) for men and 0.98 (0.82 to 1.17), 0.89 (0.73 to 1.10) and 1.02 (0.81 to 1.29) for women. In contrast, higher BMI and WHR were associated with an increased risk of both outcomes and WHR appeared to have the best predictive value among three indices. Once BMI and WHR are taken into account, fat percentage does not add to prediction of mortality or CVD in middle-aged and older-aged adults.\n\nHips don't lie: Waist-to-hip ratio in trauma patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nJoseph, Bellal; Zangbar, Bardiya; Haider, Ansab Abbas; Kulvatunyou, Naroung; Khalil, Mazhar; Tang, Andrew; O'Keeffe, Terence; Friese, Randall S; Orouji Jokar, Tahereh; Vercruysse, Gary; Latifi, Rifat; Rhee, Peter\n\n2015-12-01\n\nObesity measured by body mass index (BMI) is known to be associated with worse outcomes in trauma patients. Recent studies have assessed the impact of distribution of body fat measured by waist-hip ratio (WHR) on outcomes in nontrauma patients. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of distribution of body fat (WHR) on outcomes in trauma patients. A 6-month (June to November 2013) prospective cohort analysis of all admitted trauma patients was performed at our Level 1 trauma center. WHR was measured in each patient on the first day of hospital admission. Patients were stratified into two groups: patients with WHR of 1 or greater and patients with WHR of less than 1. Outcome measures were complications and in-hospital mortality. Complications were defined as infectious, pulmonary, and renal complications. Regression and correlation analyses were performed. A total of 240 patients were enrolled, of which 28.8% patients (n = 69) had WHR of 1 or greater. WHR had a weak correlation with BMI (R = 0.231, R = 0.481). Eighteen percent (n = 43) of the patients developed complications, and the mortality rate was 10% (n = 24). Patients with a WHR of 1 or greater were more likely to develop in-hospital complications (32% vs. 13%, p = 0.001) and had a higher mortality rate (24% vs. 4%, p = 0.001) compared with the patients with a WHR of less than 1. In multivariate analysis, a WHR of 1 or greater was an independent predictor for the development of complications (odds ratio, 3.1; 95% confidence interval 1.08-9.2; p = 0.03) and mortality (odds ratio, 13.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-70; p = 0.04). Distribution of body fat as measured by WHR independently predicts mortality and complications in trauma patients. WHR is better than BMI in predicting adverse outcomes in trauma patients. Assessing the fat distribution pattern in trauma patients may help improve patient outcomes through focused targeted intervention.

However, in the elderly patients, obesity has been described as a protective factor. This article set out to examine the effect of body mass index (BMI) on outcomes and morbidity after hip fracture surgery. The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried for all patients undergoing 1 of 4 surgical procedures to manage hip fracture between 2008 and 2012. Patient demographics, BMI, and known factors that lead to poor surgical outcomes were included as putative predictors for complications that included infectious, cardiac, pulmonary, renal, and neurovascular events. Using Ï 2 tests, 30-day postoperative complication rates were compared between 4 patient groups stratified by BMI as low weight (BMI < 20), normal (BMI = 20-30), obese (BMI = 30-40), and morbidly obese (BMI > 40). A total of 15 108 patients underwent surgery for hip fracture over the examined 5-year period. Of these, 18% were low weight (BMI < 20), 67% were normal weight (BMI = 20-30), 13% were obese (BMI = 30-40), and 2% were morbidly obese (BMI > 40). The low-weight and morbidly obese patients had both the highest mortality rates and the lowest superficial infection rates. There was a significant increase in blood transfusion rates that decreased linearly with increasing BMI. Deep surgical site infection and renal failure increased linearly with increasing BMI, however, these outcomes were confounded by comorbidities. This study demonstrates that patients at either extreme of the BMI spectrum, rather than solely the obese, are at greatest risk of major adverse events following hip fracture surgery. This runs contrary to the notion that obese hip fracture patients automatically require additional preoperative screening and perioperative services, as currently implemented in many institutions.\n\nThe Cross-Sectional Relationship Between Body Mass Index, Waist-Hip Ratio and Cognitive Performance in Postmenopausal Women Enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKerwin, Diana R.; Zhang, Yinghua; Kotchen, Jane Morley; Espeland, Mark A.; Van Horn, Linda; McTigue, Kathleen M.; Robinson, Jennifer G.; Powell, Lynda; Kooperberg, Charles; Coker, Laura H.; Hoffmann, Raymond\n\n2010-01-01\n\nOBJECTIVES To determine if body weight (BMI) is independently associated with cognitive function in postmenopausal women and the relationship between body fat distribution as estimated by waist-hip-ratio (WHR) and cognitive function. DESIGN Cross-sectional data analysis SETTING Baseline data from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) hormone trials. PARTICIPANTS 8745 postmenopausal women aged 65â79 years, free of clinical evidence of dementia and completed baseline evaluation in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) hormone trials. MEASUREMENTS Participants completed a Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MSE), health and lifestyle questionnaires, and standardized measurements of height, weight, body circumferences and blood pressure. Statistical analysis of associations between 3MSE scores, BMI and WHR after controlling for known confounders. RESULTS With the exception of smoking and exercise, vascular disease risk factors, including hypertension, waist measurement, heart disease and diabetes, were significantly associated with 3MSE score and were included as co-variables in subsequent analyses. BMI was inversely related to 3MSE scores, for every 1 unit increase in BMI, 3MSE decrease 0.988 (p=.0001) after adjusting for age, education and vascular disease risk factors. BMI had the most pronounced association with poorer cognitive functioning scores among women with smaller waist measurements. Among women with the highest WHR, cognitive scores increased with BMI. CONCLUSION Increasing BMI is associated with poorer cognitive function in women with smaller WHR. Higher WHR, estimating central fat mass, is associated with higher cognitive function in this cross-sectional study. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanism for this association.

But, multicollinearity could yield biased estimates. To address the multicollinearity issue between BMI and WC, we used the residual model approach. The standard WC (Y-axis) was regressed on the BMI (X-axis) to obtain residual WC. Data from two adult population surveys (Nunavik Inuit and James Bay Cree) were analysed to evaluate relative effect of BMI and WC on four cardiometabolic risk factors: insulin, triglycerides, systolic blood pressure and high-density lipoprotein levels. In multivariate models, standard WC and BMI were significantly associated with cardiometabolic outcomes. Residual WC was not linked with any outcomes. The BMI effect was weakened by including standard WC in the model, but its effect remained unchanged if residual WC was considered. The strong correlation between standard WC and BMI does not allow assessment of their relative contributions to health in the same model without a risk of making erroneous estimations. By contrast with BMI, fat distribution (residual WC) does not add valuable information to a model that already contains overall adiposity (BMI) in Inuit and Cree.

We also sought to examine any differences by ...\n\nGenetic Association of Waist-to-Hip Ratio With Cardiometabolic Traits, Type 2 Diabetes, and Coronary Heart Disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nEmdin, Connor A; Khera, Amit V; Natarajan, Pradeep; Klarin, Derek; Zekavat, Seyedeh M; Hsiao, Allan J; Kathiresan, Sekar\n\n2017-02-14\n\nIn observational studies, abdominal adiposity has been associated with type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease (CHD). Whether these associations represent causal relationships remains uncertain. To test the association of a polygenic risk score for waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) adjusted for body mass index (BMI), a measure of abdominal adiposity, with type 2 diabetes and CHD through the potential intermediates of blood lipids, blood pressure, and glycemic phenotypes. A polygenic risk score for WHR adjusted for BMI, a measure of genetic predisposition to abdominal adiposity, was constructed with 48 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. The association of this score with cardiometabolic traits, type 2 diabetes, and CHD was tested in a mendelian randomization analysis that combined case-control and cross-sectional data sets. Estimates for cardiometabolic traits were based on a combined data set consisting of summary results from 4 genome-wide association studies conducted from 2007 to 2015, including up to 322â¯154 participants, as well as individual-level, cross-sectional data from the UK Biobank collected from 2007-2011, including 111â¯986 individuals. Estimates for type 2 diabetes and CHD were derived from summary statistics of 2 separate genome-wide association studies conducted from 2007 to 2015 and including 149â¯821 individuals and 184â¯305 individuals, respectively, combined with individual-level data from the UK Biobank. Genetic predisposition to increased WHR adjusted for BMI. Type 2 diabetes and CHD. Among 111â¯986 individuals in the UK Biobank, the mean age was 57 (SD, 8) years, 58â¯845 participants (52.5%) were women, and mean WHR was 0.875. Analysis of summary-level genome-wide association study results and individual-level UK Biobank data demonstrated that a 1-SD increase in WHR adjusted for BMI mediated by the polygenic risk score was associated with 27-mg/dL higher triglyceride levels, 4.1-mg/dL higher 2-hour glucose levels, and 2.1-mm Hg higher\n\nWaist-to-Hip Ratio is Related to Body Fat Content and Distribution Regardless of the Waist Circumference Measurement Protocol in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nPimenta, Nuno M; Santa-Clara, Helena; Melo, Xavier; Cortez-Pinto, Helena; Silva-Nunes, JosÃ©; Sardinha, LuÃ­s B\n\n2016-08-01\n\nCentral accumulation and distribution of body fat (BF) is an important cardiometabolic risk factor. Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), commonly elevated in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients, has been endorsed as a risk related marker of central BF content and distribution, but no standardized waist circumference measurement protocol (WCmp) has been proposed. We aimed to investigate whether using different WCmp affects the strength of association between WHR and BF content and distribution in NAFLD patients. BF was assessed with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in 28 NAFLD patients (19 males, 51 Â± 13 years, and 9 females, 47 Â± 13 years). Waist circumference (WC) was measured using four different WCmp (WC1: minimal waist; WC2: iliac crest; WC3: mid-distance between iliac crest and lowest rib; WC4: at the umbilicus) and WHR was calculated accordingly (WHR1, WHR2, WHR3 and WHR4, respectively). High WHR was found in up to 84.6% of subjects, depending on the WHR considered. With the exception of WHR1, all WHR correlated well with abdominal BF (r = .47 for WHR1; r = .59 for WHR2 and WHR3; r = .58 for WHR4) and BF distribution (r = .45 for WHR1; r = .56 for WHR2 and WHR3; r = .51 for WHR4), controlling for age, sex and body mass index (BMI). WHR2 and WHR3 diagnosed exactly the same prevalence of high WHR (76.9%). The present study confirms the strong relation between WHR and central BF, regardless of WCmp used, in NAFLD patients. WHR2 and WHR3 seemed preferable for use in clinical practice, interchangeably, for the diagnosis of high WHR in NAFLD patients.\n\nGenetic Risk Score Mendelian Randomization Shows that Obesity Measured as Body Mass Index, but not Waist:Hip Ratio, Is Causal for Endometrial Cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nPainter, Jodie N; O'Mara, Tracy A; Marquart, Louise; Webb, Penelope M; Attia, John; Medland, Sarah E; Cheng, Timothy; Dennis, Joe; Holliday, Elizabeth G; McEvoy, Mark; Scott, Rodney J; Ahmed, Shahana; Healey, Catherine S; Shah, Mitul; Gorman, Maggie; Martin, Lynn; Hodgson, Shirley V; Beckmann, Matthias W; Ekici, Arif B; Fasching, Peter A; Hein, Alexander; RÃ¼bner, Matthias; Czene, Kamila; Darabi, Hatef; Hall, Per; Li, Jingmei; DÃ¶rk, Thilo; DÃ¼rst, Matthias; Hillemanns, Peter; Runnebaum, Ingo B; Amant, Frederic; Annibali, Daniela; Depreeuw, Jeroen; Lambrechts, Diether; Neven, Patr"
