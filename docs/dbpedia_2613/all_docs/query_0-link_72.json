        "text": "What a year. We had a bit of everything. There was joy, laughter, good, bad and the ugly. We rejoiced with some major achievements, there many scandals and on a sad note, we bid farewell to so many great Samoans, men and women who have served this country so well. Today, as we prepare to welcome a brand new year, we take a moment to pause, look back and remember some of the stories that made 2018 the year that was. There were far too many stories for all of them to be remembered in this edition. But over the next few pages, we share a brief from some of them.\n\nCompiled by Mata’afa Keni Lesa\n\nJANUARY\n\nFire consumes Vaitele building\n\nSamoa started 2018 with a fire, which consumed a large part of the Fa’asootauloa Pati building at Vaitele on New Year’s morning.\n\nAccording to an eye witness who spoke to the Samoa Observer on the condition of anonymity, the fire started on the top floor.\n\nIt occurred not long after the New Year’s church services had ended.\n\n“It all happened at around one in the morning,” the eye witness said. “We were just finishing up our church service here in Vaitele when we saw fire trucks rushed towards the fire. We went and saw the top of the building on fire. “The fire trucks were very fast and they did a good job in putting out the fire. The road was blocked off for about half an hour for the safety of the public.” The building has been fixed and is re-opened.\n\nGovernment’s new Chief Statistician\n\nA new woman was appointed and endorsed by Cabinet to take charge of the Samoa Bureau of Statistics (S.B.S.). After serving 30 years in the statistical services, Ali’imuamua Malaefono Ta’aloga, is the government’s new Chief Statistician.\n\nShe succeeded one of Samoa’s longest serving C.E.O., Muagututi’a Sefuiva Reupena. Ali’imuamua was the A.C.E.O. of Census, Surveys and Demography Statistics Division.\n\nAli’imuamua lost both her parents, the late Tauā Faafeū Fuataga Penita of Lalomanu, Saanapu and Ruta Ioapo Natoealofa of Moataa and Safotu.\n\nLawyer calls on govt. to legalise marijuana\n\nSenior Lawyer, Unasa Iuni Sapolu, called on the government to consider legalizing marijuana.\n\nIn her view, it will help Samoa’s economy through the export of medicinal marijuana, especially coconut oil and marijuana fuse.\n\nShe also believes this will help reduce the number of inmates housed at Tafa’igata Prison.\n\n“Furthermore it will save costs to Samoa when all those imprisoned for possession of marijuana etc. are no longer fed in jail, no longer accommodated in jail and there are no more criminal offenses relating to marijuana,” she said.\n\n“For health reasons, those with cystic fibrosis, epilepsy, cancer, depression and other health problems can be treated with marijuana.”\n\nShe told the Samoa Observer the government is wasting money and the Court’s time.\n\n“Stop listening to white agendas, colonized minds, it’s just a plant, legalize and reduce government indebtedness.”\n\nPresident Thomas S. Monson passes away\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints mourned the passing of President and Prophet Thomas S. Monson. President Thomas S. Monson died in his home in Salt Lake City. He died at age 90 from causes incident to age.\n\nPresident Monson, who has served as president of the Church since February 2008, leaves behind a legacy of service and good works.\n\nTo the more than 16 million members of the Church around the world, President Monson was an example of one who followed Jesus Christ.\n\n“He loved the cultures of the world, and deeply respected them. And particularly the faith of the people,” said President Henry B. Eyring, who served as first counselor in the First Presidency.\n\nWhile he served in important Church leadership positions throughout his life, he also ministered quietly to thousands of individuals in homes, hospitals and care centers.\n\nThe new President of the Church is Russell M. Nelson.\n\nGovt. eyes China-Samoa flight\n\nPrime Minister Tuilaepa Sa’ilele Malielegaoi confirmed his government’s wish for a possible direct flight from China to Samoa, as part of the government’s plans to develop the tourism industry.\n\n“The government has been longing for a Chinese Airline to invest in Samoa,” Tuilaepa said. “So when the time does permit for a Chinese airline to enter Samoa, we will get a share of a huge tourism market.”\n\nTuilaepa said nothing has been finalised.\n\n“Now, that it is our hope for a Chinese Airline to invest in Samoa,” he said.\n\nTuilaepa said the government is looking at the recent investment by a Chinese group who have purchased the Sheraton Samoa Aggie Grey’s Hotel on Beach Road.\n\nHe said the transaction presents a huge opportunity for Samoa. Besides, the talks about flights from China have been in the works for a very long time, he said.\n\n“We must also remember that these people are great business people in a sense that they will only invest in this avenue once they know that it’s profitable,” he said of the Chinese.\n\nSamoa farewells Taulapapa Faamanatu Nielsen\n\nA woman known as the “Florence Nightingale” of nursing in Samoa passed away.\n\nShe was the President of the Samoa Nurses Association, Taulapapa Fesolai Talailelotu Fa’amanatu Faletoese Nielsen.\n\nBorn on 3 September 1933 to her parents the, late Rev. Kenape Tu’u’u Faletoese and Fa’api’omalo Asi Vatau, Taulapapa passed away peacefully at the Nurses Home, Moto’otua, on the 22nd of December 2017. She was 84.\n\nTaulapapa married Fainu’ulelei Etuale Osasa Nielsen, in 1960 and is survived by him, her seven children, her 23 grand children and her four great grandchildren.\n\nIn the P.M.’s eulogy, he described her as someone who has earned much respect by all during her time as a registered nurse. He added the respect she has earned is one of the reasons she was presented the Head of State’s Order of Service award.\n\n“Taulapapa is a reliable and an honest person,” Tuilaepa said. “She was always helping everywhere during her time as a registered nurse in the country. She was at Tuasivi (hospital), Salailua, Sa’anapu and other Pacific Islands countries just to serve and help those who are in need.”\n\nP.M. blasts heads of Government\n\nPrime Minister Tuilaepa slammed the heads of government bodies that did not attend the services for the National Week of Prayers and Fasting. Tuilaepa made his displeasure known in a letter to all the Heads of Government Ministries, Corporations and Authorities, dated 5 January 2018.\n\nAll Cabinet Ministers are copied.\n\nA copy of the letter obtained by the Samoa Observer shows the Prime Minister’s disappointment about the turn out, especially by the Chief Executive Officers.\n\n“In my observation and count, there were not ten Chief Executive Officers present,” a translation of Tuilaepa’s letter reads. “This is not new, we see the same C.E.O.s every year.”\n\nFire demolishes Siumu school\n\nPalalaua College at Siumu was hit by fire. A large part of the school building was completely demolished.\n\nThe fire ripped through the old wooden school buildings leaving behind remnants of the tin roofing on top of a pile of ash where the buildings once stood.\n\nSome parts of the school building remains standing with some showing signs of minor scorch marks inside.\n\nPalalaua College’s Principal, Leoloa Tuuu Mautofiga, was devastated.\n\n“This is a very bad start to our 2018,” she said. “I am trying to remain positive. At least we still have our new buildings and our hall still standing. The fire only took our old buildings. There’s not much we can do about this incident.”\n\nThe students learning continued uninterrupted in 2018.\n\nSamoa Observer premiers The Post\n\nThe Samoa Observer and the International Press Institute (I.P.I.) rolled out the red carpet for a special premier of Steven Spielberg’s movie, The Post, at Apollo Cinemas, kicking off the newspaper’s 40th anniversary celebrations. The movie, starring Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep, details Katharine Graham’s struggles as the Editor of The Washington Post during the Watergate scandal.\n\nIt highlights the importance of press freedom and the critical role played by the free media in democracy.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister, Fiame Naomi Mata’afa was among a host of Cabinet Ministers and Members of Parliament at the event. They were joined by the Chief Justice, his Honour Patu Tiava’asue Falefatu Sapolu, members of the diplomatic corps, government leaders and representatives of the business community.\n\nThe evening was part of the Samoa Observer’s 40th Anniversary events, with the official celebration scheduled for later this year.\n\nThe Editor of the Samoa Observer, Mata’afa Keni Lesa, spoke about the significance of the movie and the connection to the Samoa Observer.\n\n“While all that was happening during the Nixon era, just down the road from The Washington Post Office, was a small bookshop called, The Globe Books, where a young man from Samoa, Sano Malifa, was working,” Mata’afa said. “Mr. Malifa was so inspired by the events from that time; he returned to Samoa eight years later and started the Samoa Observer. Through hard work and by the grace of God, the Samoa Observer is celebrating its 40th Anniversary this year.\n\n“Now they talk about life and events coming around full circle. After his own tears, blood and struggles with issues of Press Freedom in Samoa, in year 2000, Savea Sano Malifa returned to Boston, U.S.A. Accompanied by the Publisher, Muliaga Jean Ash, Savea was honoured as one of fifty I.P.I. World Press Freedom Heroes. He shared the same honour and the same stage with, Katharine Graham.”\n\nIn a video message from Vienna, Austria, the Executive Director of I.P.I, Barbara Trionfi, paid tribute to both Katharine Graham and Gatoaitele Savea Sano Malifa.\n\n“In honouring I.P.I. World Press Freedom Heroes in the year 2000, Katherine Graham, also an IPI Hero and whose commitment to journalistic integrity and courage is shown in the film “The Post.”\n\n“The Heroes of the I.P.I. demonstrate that in spite of every obstacle and every constraint the truth ultimately prevails and is made known. Today, as the information landscape is increasingly fragmented, the value of quality, independent, public interest journalism is greater than ever.\n\n“People need accurate, fair and diverse journalistic sources in order to be able to develop informed opinions, participate in the public debate and so contribute to democratic governance. That is why, today more than ever.”\n\nAlleged drug killing\n\nThe head of a 15-year-old boy was savagely bashed in a murder allegedly connected to drug dealing at Satapuala.\n\nThe death has become the subject of a Police investigation which saw armed Police officers in the area.\n\nNearby, the community is coming to term with the gruesome discovery.\n\nThe Police have identified the boy as Uili Uili of Satapuala.\n\nAccording to the Police Superintendent and Media Spokesperson, Auapa’au Logoitino Filipo, the boy’s family reported the matter to the Police on Wednesday because he did not return home the previous day. This set off an investigation by the Police, which led them to a marijuana farm. The boy was found nearby.\n\nThe Police have since seized the marijuana farm, estimated to have a street value of more than $100,000.\n\nP.M. defends China in diplomatic dispute\n\nPrime Minister Tuilaepa Dr. Sailele Malielegaoi strongly defended China’s role in the Pacific amidst a deepening diplomatic row involving Australia’s International Development Minister Concetta Fierravanti-Wells.\n\nMs. Fierravanti-Wells had launched an unprovoked scathing attack on China’s aid to the Pacific countries – including Samoa.\n\nShe accused the Chinese of building “roads to nowhere” and constructing “useless buildings” which will only leave Pacific countries with debts they cannot pay.\n\nBut Tuilaepa disagreed. He launched a broadside at Ms. Fierravanti-Wells in an interview with the government-owned Savali Newspaper, later released to the media.\n\n“I am certainly surprised with the comments made by Australia’s Development Minister,” Tuilaepa said. “They are quite insulting to the leaders of the Pacific Island nations. To me as Chairman of the Pacific Leaders Forum, the comments question the integrity, wisdom and intelligence of the leaders of the Pacific Islands to judge what is good for our own people.\n\n“These types of comments can damage the excellent relationships that exist between Australia and the Pacific Island countries, particularly Samoa.”\n\nTuilaepa said he can only speak for Samoa and as the Prime Minister, he welcomes assistance from China.\n\n“In fact, China comes to our assistance on the basis of our requests, on what we know is suitable for Samoa. The Australian Development Minister has made reference to ‘useless buildings’ and ‘roads to nowhere.’\n\n“The buildings funded by China e.g. the courts; T.A.T.T.E., hospital and central Government building have provided modern facilities which considerably raise the excellent working environment for our officials, raising the quality of work and productivity.\n\n“It improves the work ethic of our people and raises the beauty of our own city, which now becomes something of a modern city.\n\n“Reference has also been made by the Minister to the fact that these are very, very expensive in terms of the loans made to build them. In fact, the assistance given by China comes in both grants and concessionary loans.”\n\nPrisons under scrutiny over murderer’s release\n\nThe Minister of Prisons, Tialavea Tionisio Hunt, defended the decision to release a convicted murderer to attend his matai title bestowal ceremony during the Festive Season.\n\nThe Samoa Prisons and Corrections Services (S.P.C.S.) approved the release of well-known criminal, Tagaloasa Filipaina, the Samoa Observer was told.\n\nThe release came at a time when members of the public were outraged over a prison break involving four other prisoners, which resulted in a woman and her children attacked at Ululoloa.\n\nWhen concerns from members of the public about the Tagaloasa decision were put to the Minister, he downplayed them, saying the prisoner had shown enough proof that he has changed his ways.\n\n“Filipaina is a low risk prisoner,” he said. “We believe he has very minimal chances of reoffending.”\n\nSex Offenders Registry signed into law\n\nThe Sex Offenders Registration Act 2017 was signed into law by Samoa’s Head of State, His Highness Tuimaleali’ifano, Va’aletoa Sualauvi II.\n\nThis was confirmed by Assistant M.P.M.C. Chief Executive Officer, Siaopo Pese.\n\n“It’s already signed into law,” he said.\n\nThe Sex Offenders Registration Act 2017, was initiated by Supreme Court Justice Vui Clarence Nelson, about five years ago when he appealed to the government to establish a Sex Offenders Registry.\n\nSpeaking to the Samoa Observer from Geneva, Justice Vui says this Act is about keeping the women and children of Samoa safe.\n\n“This is an essential piece of legislation necessary for the protection of women and the children of our country,” he said. “Also in relation to the dangers posed by convicted sex offenders being deported back to Samoa from overseas.”\n\nJustice Vui commended the Government’s Law Reform Commission who held extensive public consultations.\n\n‘Nepotism’ claims rejected\n\nThe government rejected claims of nepotism and favouritism with regards to the selection and awarding of scholarships.\n\nThe Prime Minister and the Chairman of the Staff Training and Scholarship Committee (S.T.S.C.), Tuilaepa Dr. Sa’ilele Malielegaoi, said the claims against himself, the Committee and the Secretary of the Scholarship Committee, Tagaloa Sharon Potoi, making rounds on blogs and social media are unfounded.\n\nHe vehemently rejected them, even challenging the “faceless bloggers” making them to provide evidence.\n\n“I present a challenge to the people who have accused the Secretary or anyone on the Committee,” he said. “I dare you publish any wrong doing by the Committee in the Samoa Observer, and pinpoint what year there was any wrongful action done during my tenure.\n\n“If it was done 10 years ago, please be precise. Tell us if any of the students, if the student is a son or daughter of a Committee member, or a child of mine that has been sent to another country from this scholarship that did not meet the criteria.\n\n“I am the Chairman and others in the Committee include the Minister of Education, Sports and Culture and twelve other C.E.O’s,” Tuilaepa said.\n\n“So if there was any wrongdoing going on in the Scholarship Committee, one of the 15 would have said anything a long time ago.\n\n“If the allegations were accurate, they would’ve written to the newspaper and revealed their identity, but that hasn’t happened.”\n\nP.M. in Facebook hoax\n\nPrime Minister Tuilaepa Sa’ilele Malielegaoi does not have a Facebook page.\n\nThis was confirmed by his Office in a statement released to the media, in a bid to clear the Prime Minister’s name after someone created a Facebook page using his name and posting about alleged government reforms.\n\nIt includes a promise by the government to increase the senior pension’s fund from $135 to $200 a month.\n\n“Using the Prime Minister’s name (Tuilaepa Lupesoliai Sailele Malielegaoi), the Facebook page was sneakily created over the festive holidays without Tuilaepa’s knowledge or approval,” the statement from Tuilaepa’s office said.\n\n“The page has since been removed but not without denting the Prime Minister’s image and his administration’s reputation.\n\n“The bogus paged was cunningly used by the ghost creator to post reforms and developments designed by government to benefit the country.\n\nChina calms loan fears\n\nChina’s Ambassador to Samoa, Wang Xuefeng, moved to assuage fears over Samoa’s debt to China, assuring a number of projects under their aid programme are funded by grants. In fact, according to the Ambassador, the Chinese aid to Samoa for the past two and a half years has been in the form of grants.\n\nThis includes China’s contribution to the cost of the $140million Faleolo International Airport.\n\nAsked about the conditions of the loans the Chinese Government give to Samoa, Mr. Xuefeng said: “The Prime Minister of Samoa has already answered the same question to a journalist.”\n\nPressed on how much China has given to Samoa in terms of grants and loans, Mr. Xuefeng said: “I don’t have any specific statistics at hand to give a very good comment.\n\n“The Prime Minister answered that he believes Samoa has the capability to repay the loans and has ample capacity to pay on an annual basis.\n\n“Now, as far as I know, all Chinese projects offered at this time are in the form of grants. In the past two and a half years that I have served here, it has all been grants.”\n\nNation mourns Dr. Ueta Solomona\n\nSamoa lost a great music composer, also known as a Music Master, Dr. Ueta Matautia Peni Solomona. Dr. Ueta passed away when he was 82.\n\nDr. Ueta is credited as one of Samoa’s most respected music composers, conductors, keyboardists, arrangers and choir masters.\n\nHe was a lecturer and tutor at The University of the South Pacific in Fiji and Samoa. Prime Minister Tuilaepa said Dr. Ueta’s work will be remembered forever.\n\n“It’s been years since the government has been using Ueta in conducting and composing hymns in so many of the government occasions,” Tuilaepa said.\n\n“He joined and contributed to the best of his abilities in whatever way he could.”\n\nTuilaepa added that Dr. Ueta is one of Samoa’s greatest musicians.\n\n“Today (yesterday), we salute his service in all these years, and may you rest in peace Ueta.”\n\nHis wife, Susau Solomona described Ueta as a loving and ambitious father, grandfather, uncle, brother like any other father and family man in the world.\n\nShe said Ueta loved and adored not only his children, but his family as well.\n\nSeutatia Solomona, Ueta’s niece, gave the eulogy on behalf of his family.\n\nProposed electoral law change alarms\n\nA senior Member of Parliament for Gagaemauga No. 2, Fa’aso’otauloa Pati Taulapapa, has cautioned the government against changes that have been proposed as part of the Electoral Act review.\n\nThe Member of Parliament, who is also the Associate Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, is particularly concerned about part of the review, which will affect his constituency.\n\nGagaemauga No. 2 is among electoral constituencies where voters are spread between Upolu and Savai’i. Fa’aso’otauloa’s constituency for example includes Saleaula in Savai’i and Salamumu in Upolu, similar to the situation with Leauva’a and Gagaemauga No. 1.\n\nAccording to sources, part of the Electoral Act Review includes looking at redefining the electoral boundaries. This will see new seats in Faleata and Vaimauga. The Review recommends that Leauva’a will be a stand alone constituency while voters from Salamumu will join the Safata roll.\n\nThis is where Fa’aso’otauloa is not happy.\n\n“The move is inappropriate,” he told the Samoa Observer when his views were sought. “I believe Samoa has already been chosen. Samoa wasn’t chosen by numbers when our forefathers designed the boundaries, it was done through mutual respect and the fact that everyone has their own destiny.”\n\nThe Associate Minister said he is not against the Government’s plans but he wants to express his concerns on behalf of the people whom he is in Parliament to represent.\n\nGovt. urged to deal with ‘threat’ from within\n\nThe Associate Minister of Communications and Information Technology, Lealailepule Rimoni Aiafi, called on the Government to deal with what he has described as an “internal threat” in terms of online users abusing the forum to hurt people.\n\nSpeaking in Parliament, the Faleata West M.P. directed a challenge to the Minister of Communications and Information Technology, Afamasaga Rico Tupai,\n\nto launch a nationwide hunt for online users who abuse internet to attack the Government, spread untruthful information which creates ill feelings among people towards their leaders.\n\n“Your honour, the Minister of Communications, they should have been looked up and found a long time ago,” he said. “If you’ve found them, bring them so we can sue them. Take them to Court, let’s do it because what they are doing is not good, it is inappropriate. Because we are a nation founded on God, we are a Christian nation.”\n\nLeala, who has been a victim of some of the online posts in the past, described such people as an “internal threat”.\n\n“We must stop this rude and inappropriate behaviour,” Leala said. “We must put an end to this practice where these people misuse and abuse tools that should be used for development. The internet is a useful tool that can help people move forward.”\n\nMinister defends $20m Prison investment\n\nMinister of Finance, Sili Epa Tuioti, defended the Government’s decision to invest $20million to the Tanumalala Prison project.\n\nSpeaking to the Samoa Observer, Sili said it is a worthwhile investment, one that needs to be constructed now before the cost balloons in the near future.\n\n“People don’t really think of an investment with a prison facility as something that will contribute to the economic development and in my view it is,” he said.\n\n“There is no way we can continue with the facilities at Tafaigata. It’s deteriorating, and we wouldn’t want any of our people there, it’s inhumane and overcrowded.\n\n“At the moment we’re not providing rehabilitation programmes for them. So I think shifting the prison facilities to Tanugamalala and where it’s highly secured and a clean environment for them will help.\n\n“It’s best that we do it and complete the project and do it well rather than sort of try and cut down the cost and we end up with the facility that in five of 10 years, we look back and say that it could have been better.”\n\nContrary to criticisms of the investment, Sili said Samoa needs to spend money to ensure prisoners stop escaping and hurting innocent people.\n\nTragic accident at Puipa’a\n\nA tragic accident at Puipa’a where a speeding bus flipped several times landing on its roof, claimed three lives.\n\n“A total of 46 passengers were on the bus including the three people who died,” said Auapa’au.\n\n“The bus driver and two elderly women unfortunately died as a result of the tragic incident.\n\n“Preliminary reports from the National Health Services accounted 46 passengers from men, women and children who were at the hospital for medical treatment.\n\nAt the hospital, there was a heavy presence of police, families and friends of the passengers.\n\nOne of the survivors, Tausaga Solifono, spoke to the Sunday Samoan on what had occurred.\n\n“The bus was packed and I was sitting on a woman at the back of the bus,” Tausaga said. “My grandmother was sitting with another old lady right behind the bus driver, when we got on the bus she insisted to sit behind the driver,” said the emotional Tausaga.\n\nTausaga’s grandmother was one of the deceased.\n\nLand and Titles Court President investigated\n\nThe President of the Land and Titles Court, Fepulea’i Attila Ropati, was investigated by the Ministry of Police in connection to an alleged assault incident.\n\nThis was confirmed by Police Superintendent and Media Spokesperson, Auapa’au Logoitino Filipo, in response to questions from the Samoa Observer.\n\n“I can only confirm that there is an investigation,” he said, “and that is all I can say.”\n\nAccording to sources within the Police, the alleged incident occurred at the compound of the Judiciary during a “party” for the Judges over the festive season last year.\n\n“It’s alleged that the accused struck the security officer (who works at the judiciary compound) on the head twice with a glass bottle,” the source said.\n\n“The matter was not reported to the Police immediately and it wasn’t until a few days later when the security officer felt pain on his head and was taken to the hospital.\n\n“At the hospital, the doctor found bits and pieces of broken glass on his head and that’s when the matter was reported to the Police.”\n\nThe matter had reached Court and is still continuing.\n\nFEBRUARY\n\nAlleged passports sale\n\nFour Samoan passports were allegedly sold between December 2016 and May 2017 by a former Immigration Officer.\n\nHe allegedly received $684.24, $980.71, $382.80 and $2,092 on four different occasions in relation to the transactions.\n\nThis is according to the charge sheet obtained by the Samoa Observer in ongoing hearing of former Immigration Officer, David Nomereta Uaine, of Tuana’i.\n\nUaine, 26, has pleaded not guilty to 32 criminal charges against him. His plea was entered by his lawyer, Unasa Iuni Sapolu.\n\nThe Court appearance comes after he was arrested last year following a lengthy Police investigation, over claims about Samoan passports being sold online, to places such as South Africa.\n\nAccording to the information sheet, Uaine is charged with four counts of a plan to “sell or give a document namely Samoan passport” T440536; T440525; T434481 and T434407. There are four charges relating to inserting “the application for Samoan Passport” of one “Dave Afele Allen; Mark Filo Hamden; Franco Fitu Rudolf and Miriama Kaba Hugo “in a passport database namely the Boarder Management System.”\n\nUaine also faces four charges of “false certification” on 2 and 8 December 2016 and 9 and 11 May 2017.\n\nOther criminal charges against the accused include four counts of “without lawful authority or reasonable issues a Samoa Travel Document namely Miriama Kaba Hugo on 8 December, 2016; Franco Fitu Rudolf on 16 May, 2017; Mark Filo Hamden on 16 May, 2017 and Dave Afele Allen on 6 December, 2016.”\n\nThe hearing continues.\n\nP.M. Tuilaepa, Maua Faleauto and Dennis Smith\n\nA war of words between Prime Minister Tuilaepa Dr. Sa’ilele Malielegaoi and two of his biggest online critics broke out in cyber space.\n\nThe heated exchange follows Tuilaepa’s decision to attack Lawyer and Government critic, Maua Faleauto, and self-proclaimed “private investigative blogger”, Dennis A. Smith, during an interview with the government-owned Savali Newspaper, he later released to the media.\n\nBoth Maua and Mr. Smith are not backing down, firing back at Prime Minister Tuilaepa with their own accusations. They say he is not someone to be trusted with the administration of the country.\n\nThe Prime Minister was asked about people who constantly criticise every decision the government makes when Maua Faleauto’s name popped up. Tuilaepa said Maua is a member of his extended Fatialofa family.\n\n“I knew his grandparents well and also his father Leifi Faleauto,” Tuilaepa is quoted as saying. “When I was at St. Paul’s College in 1964, his grandparents invited me to a Sunday toona’i at their home not far from my school then.\n\n“Now that I hold the title Fatialofa, I am therefore the Matai of the Faleauto Clan. Several years ago I presided over the family ceremony conferring the Faleauto Matai title to his brother who was then C.E.O. of the National Bank of Samoa.”\n\nTuilaepa said he discussed Maua’s behaviour with his brother.\n\n“I did but after I heard something about Maua being a loose cannon, I understood immediately,” Tuilaepa said.\n\nWhich is a pity, he said, given that “he is a qualified lawyer.”\n\n“Some fifteen years ago, he came to Samoa,” Tuilaepa explained. “He worked briefly with the Police as prosecutor for the police, during Papali’i Lolenese’s term as Commissioner, then opened his private practice for a short time, then closed when his father died suddenly.\n\n“I helped with the arrangements for the transfer of his father’s body to New Zealand, and I saw Maua off at the airport with the coffin. That’s the last time I saw him!”\n\nAs for Dennis A. Smith, Tuilaepa said the Minister of Samoa Land Corporation during the previous Parliamentary sitting evicted him from government property before he was deported.\n\n“He came to my office over five years ago to request my help over a rent dispute with his landlord at Satapuala. I summoned the landlord to my office and settled the dispute the Samoan way,” Tuilaepa said. The matter was settled through “forgiveness.”\n\nSamoan woman defrauds employers, flies family and friends to Samoa for wedding\n\nA Samoan woman flew 31 of her friends and relatives for an extravagant wedding in Samoa, paid for by monies she siphoned from two of her former employees.\n\nChristine Tupu, 26, pleaded guilty to stealing A$341,000 (T$647,000) from her employers Electrolux and Toll, by telling people the bank account details for payment had changed and giving them her and her husband’s personal account details.\n\nTupu, who has been jailed for five years, married a Tongan, Hekeai Piutau, in Samoa. With roots in Saipipi and Si’uniu Falealili, the wedding in November 2016 was held at St. Therese, Leauva’a.\n\nAccording to 9 News, the money she stole was splashed on a luxurious and extravagant lifestyle including flights to her Samoan wedding for her family.\n\nThe cash is now long gone - spent on hotels, cruises, furniture and international flights, 9 News further reports.\n\nShe also created fake invoices and helped herself to a microwave, vacuum cleaners, fridges and air conditioners which she had delivered to her in-laws’ residence but never paid for. Her lawyer claimed she had an “addiction to gambling” but the judge slammed her actions as “pure greed”.\n\nFarewell So’oalo Roger Stanley\n\nThe life and times of the unique and well-loved President of the Samoa Faafafine Association, So’oalo To’oto’oalii Roger Stanley, was celebrated.\n\nFamily, friends and members of the Fa’afafine community gathered at the E.F.K.S hall in Sogi where they shared tears and laughter as they recollected memories of their beloved So’oalo. He was fondly known in the Fa’afafine community as “Mama” because of his tendency to be a refuge for those seeking help and guidance from the community.\n\nEulogies were given by his mother Aniuteattetta Afamasaga Leuluaialii Abel Stanley, Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, his eldest sister Tofilau Sonya Leilani Stanley –Levy, Vice president of the S.F.A, Alex Su’a, and Reverend Kerisiano Soti. As the Patron of the Samoa Faafafine Association, P.M. Tuilaepa spoke fondly about So’oalo and retold the story of when So’oalo approached him about starting a collective for Faafafine and then again to ask him to be a Patron of the S.F.A. He praised So’oalo’s courage and leadership in leading the S.F.A and their work in raising funds for charity.\n\nThe Prime Minister spoke highly of his “children” in the S.F.A and said that people should never look down on fa’afafine because God made them.\n\nIn Samoa, he said we have four genders of male, female, fa’atama and fa’afafine.\n\nPeople like and those like him are special because they have many talents being able to do the work of both male and female in our society.\n\nReal Tonga flies to Samoa\n\nA new era in the history of aviation between Samoa and Tonga started when Real Tonga’s operations out of Faleolo Airport took off.\n\nReal Tonga Airlines Owner and Chief Executive Officer, Tevita Palu, told the Samoa Observer that this is an exciting time for them.\n\n“I started the airline as a sole and private owner of Real Tonga in 2013 to service Tonga’s domestic air service,” he said.\n\n“Moving to start international and regional air service is quite an achievement for Real Tonga.”\n\nGirl triplets bring joy\n\nNurses at the Tupua Tamasese Meaole Hospital, Moto’otua, successfully delivered girl triplets.\n\nThe occasion is considered a rarity at the hospital in Samoa, according to a Nurse who spoke to the Samoa Observer on the condition of anonymity.\n\nShe confirmed however that the mother of the triplets, Jacinta Siaosi from Matautu Lefaga and Sataua gave birth naturally without any complications.\n\n“The eldest was born at 2:32am, the second was at 2:36am while the youngest was born at 2:40am,” she said. “The eldest is 1.9kilo, the second is 2.3kilo and the youngest is 2.5kilo. It seems like the youngest is eating all the food.\n\n“The triplets are healthy, but we are just keeping them here just for precaution.”\n\nAsked how many triplets have been born in Samoa, the nurse said she could not remember. “I can’t really remember, but all I can say is that usually in cases like this, the mother will be referred overseas,” she said.\n\n“However, we manage to care for the mother and her children and she gave birth naturally, she is strong and so are the triplets.”\n\nMother of the triplets, Jacinta Siaosi, shed tears of joy when she spoke to the Samoa Observer.\n\nP.M. addresses allegations\n\nPrime Minister Tuilaepa Dr. Sa’ilele Malielegaoi responded to a letter implicating him and two former Cabinet Ministers, Leafa Vitale and the late, Toi Aukuso.\n\nThe letter had been making rounds on social media and blogs before the Press Secretariat posted the Prime Minister’s response on the Government’s Facebook page. The following is a statement issued by the Prime Minister Tuilaepa Lupesoliai Dr. Sailele Malielegaoi today in response to media inquiries into a letter posted on the social media implicating him and two former Cabinet Ministers Leafa Vitale and Toi Aukuso sentenced to jail for life imprisonment for the assassination of the late Minister of Works, Levaula Kamu.\n\nToi Aukuso passed away in prison in April 2009 while Leafa was released on parole for health reasons in 2010.\n\nThe letter is believed to have been penned by Tuilaepa in 2007 while the two men were serving their life terms. P.M. Tuilaepa’s statement;\n\n“I have been told that the 20 year old letter was penned by a prisoner and it was proven at the time to be a fake.\n\n“My officials are now revisiting the matter to reconfirm if this is the case. But this is the first time I have seen the letter and it’s a forgery.\n\n“First, it’s addressed to Auelua T and as far as I can tell I am the only Auelua T. or Auelua Tuilaepa, so I can’t be writing a letter to myself.\n\n“Secondly, the fake letter is also dated November 25th 2007 but I was not bestowed the Auelua title until 2015. And everyone who has read by writing, these are not my words because the letter’s contents are ambiguous and do not make sense to any sane human being. Even I am confused to what the letter is trying to potray.\n\n“And even my signature is in question and a forgery.\n\n“This is not the first time that some people have forged my signature and they were duly charged convicted and served time in prison.\n\n“In the meantime, I am not fazed and remain firm that the truth will prevail and whoever is behind this sinister plan to incite and create chaos will face his day in court.\n\n“My officials have been tasked to bring an end to this nonsense on social media. It is a threat to public security because when one’s reputation is slandered and defamed without just cause or proof, it will also impact the pride and integrity of families and relatives which may provoke anything to happen.”\n\nGovt. requires newspapers to register at Court\n\nThe Government moved to implement a policy they had passed into law some 24 years ago in relation to newspapers.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice and Courts Administration (M.J.C.A.) has announced the plan to implement the $100 registration fee for all newspapers under the Newspapers and Printers Act 1993.\n\nThis was confirmed by M.J.C.A. Chief Executive Officer, Papali’i John Taimalelagi, who said the law has been in place since 1993. Asked why this was not implemented 24 years ago, Papali’i said they only recently uncovered the lapse during a review of the Acts mandated under the Ministry.\n\n“My role as C.E.O. is to review acts mandated under M.J.C.A,” he said. “I came cross the required registration for all newspapers as indicated under the Newspapers and Printers Act 1993 and yet it has never been implemented in the past.\n\n“This is part of M.J.C.A.’s Legislative Compliance and we are required to review and uphold the Acts mandated under our Ministry.”\n\nIn a letter by Papali’i to all newspapers circulating in Samoa dated 7 February 2018, Papali’i said he hopes the “process will not be too onerous” for everyone involved.\n\n“Pursuant to sections 3 and 4 of the Newspapers and Printers Act 1993 (“the Act”), notice is hereby given to all newspapers in circulation in Samoa as of 7 February, 2018, that no person shall print or publish a newspaper unless it is registered with the Registrar of the Supreme Court,” Papali’i’s letter reads.\n\n“A newspaper means a paper containing public news or observations which is printed for sale or distribution and is published in Samoa periodically at intervals not exceeding three months.”\n\nTui Samoa Cable goes live\n\nA tropical cyclone hunkering down on Samoa last night did not spoil the mood at the T.A.T.T.E. building where the much-anticipated multi-milion-tala Tui Samoa Cable project went live.\n\nPrime Minister Tuilaepa Dr. Sa’ilele Malielegaoi led the ribbon cutting and the switching on of the Cable, promising faster and cheaper Internet for Samoa.\n\nThe launch ceremony was conducted by Reverend Siaosi Salesulu of the C.C.C.S. at Vailele.\n\nReverend Salesulu said the internet as a whole can be seen as technology that has greatly enhanced our lives.\n\n“What started as vision and a dream is now an essential means for development and communication,” he said.\n\n“The introduction of the internet has led to many benefits and unfortunately for the world and for Samoa, it has also come with its own sets of problems.\n\n“Most significantly these problems can mostly impact our security and our privacy, it seems that most technological advances have been placed in the hands of fools and the irresponsible and they will use it for their insidious means.\n\n“However, let us rejoice for today we take another giant Samoan step in the right direction for providing all Samoans with access to the internet.\n\n“Let us ask God for his vision in pursue in believe that we can do all things we need to do through Chris.\n\nPrime Minister Tuilaepa said the Government’s vision is to improve the lives of the people and the Tui Samoa submarine cable is one enabler that will assist in achieving the goal.\n\n“The strategic reasons for developing the Tui Samoa Cable are to bridge the digital divide for our people and our neighboring island nations.\n\n“Promoting economic and social development and providing Samoa with access to fast reliable and affordable wholesale fast broadband internet.”\n\nTropical Cyclone Gita hits\n\nSamoa was warned to expect winds with speed of between 39-54mph as Tropical Cyclone Gita headed towards the Samoa group.\n\nIn Savai’i, days of heavy downpour took a toll on some parts of the big island.\n\nA video posted on Facebook shows water ripping through a family’s home, sweeping properties along the way including a family vehicle.\n\nElsewhere on the big island, transportation has been severely restricted, as a number of fords have been flooded and cannot be crossed. The notorious Maliolio river had burst and members of the public warned to take extra care.\n\nFlights to and from Samoa were cancelled.\n\nTwo days later, a massive clean up effort started after Tropical Cyclone Gita slammed the country on Friday night and Saturday morning. The Category 2 cyclone moved away from Samoa but the carnage left behind in her fury was highly visible.\n\nPolice foil mass Prison break\n\nWhile Cyclone Gita was speeding towards Samoa, Prisoners at Tafaigata had another agenda in mind.\n\nSome 90 Police officers were called to Tafa’igata Prison to calm the situation.\n\n“When a natural disaster is about to strike the country, often criminals find that this is the right time to strike too,” P.M. Tuilaepa said.\n\n“However the Police have always acted in accordance with keeping the peace and the situation has been sorted.”\n\nPolice Superintendent and Media Spokesperson, Auapa’au Logoitino Filipo, in response to questions from the Sunday Samoan, said the Police responded after receiving reports about the threat.\n\n“We responded to information by Prisons Authority relating to a planned mass prison break involving coordinated efforts by prisoner’s hierarchy.\n\n“This matter has now been averted and the police are working to support the Prisons authority in their efforts to secure the prisons.”\n\nThe Police also used the opportunity to raid the prison.\n\n“We conducted a raid inside the Prison and discovered more than 30 marijuana joints and stash of cash.”\n\nLiquor Board sued\n\nThe Government’s Liquor Board has been sued for an undisclosed amount by an unhappy member of the business community.\n\nMember of Parliament, Olo Fiti Vaai, is behind the lawsuit in relation to the Board’s decision to shut his bar, the Blacknose Bar, in August 2017.\n\nHe confirmed this to the Samoa Observer.\n\n“I can confirm we have filed a motion asking the Supreme Court to review the decision by the Liquor Control Board last year which led to Black Nose Bar & Restaurant closing down indefinitely,” he said.\n\n“There were a number of issues with the decision, including that it appears to have been made without the proper legal process being followed.”\n\nLandslide at Lalomanu\n\nThe landscape at Tuialamu, Lalomanu was changed after a huge landslide.\n\nThe Land Transport Authority Chief Executive Officer, Ta’atialeoitiiti Agnes Tutuvanu-Schwalger, confirmed the occurrence.\n\n“It is a huge landslide,” she told the Samoa Observer. “It covers the road and it stretches right into the ocean. As we speak, it is still ongoing.”\n\nLuckily, there was no motorist on the road at the time.\n\nThe L.T.A. Chief Executive Officer said there is little they could do immediately since the mountain where the boulders, dirt and debris come from is unstable.\n\n“So we cannot do anything about it now but we have already contacted our contractors who have already canvassed the area,” she said.\n\nToday, the landslide is still visible in the area.\n\nMailo Ben Vai passes away\n\nThe man dubbed the king of reggae in Samoa, Mailo Ben Vai, passed away in New Zealand.\n\nHis death was announced by the “We are Samoa Facebook page.”\n\n“It is with a heavy heart that we announce the passing of beloved Samoan musician, Ben Vai,” the announcement reads. “Our sincere and deepest condolences to his family, such a humble soul taken so early. Sing with the angels, Mr. Vai!”\n\nHundreds of Mailo’s fans, relatives and colleagues have taken to social media to pay their respects, reposting their favourite songs from the artist.\n\nMailo was also a film star, playing a leading role in the Silamanino Series.\n\nMailo is the son of Rev. Peniamina Vilitai and Rosarina Jioji Konusi Vai. He has roots in Vaiala and Vini-fou.\n\nMailo’s cousin, who lives at Vaiala, told the Samoa Observer that Mailo passed away in New Zealand, after battling cancer.\n\n“At the moment we are still in shocked,” she said. “He was a very humble person full of love for his family and he loves his music.”\n\nAuckland Marist kings of Marist Sevens\n\nThe defending champions of the Vailima Pure International Marist Sevens, Auckland Marist, defeated Apia, 12-0, to secure their third title in as many years at Lotopa.\n\nCaptain and M.V.P. Vuga Tagicakibau and teammate Uliano Cokanauto celebrated the victory with their team.\n\nSinalei celebrates 22nd anniversary\n\nSinalei Reef Resort celebrated their 22nd birthday with a bang!\n\nThe Beach Bash attracted more than 150 guests to enjoy the sandy beach, icy cold drinks, lots of food with the famous Ardijah Band providing top notch music and entertainment.\n\nIt was a proud moment for the hard-working Annandale family, Tuatagaloa Joe, Sose and Nelson Annandale, who have toiled extremely hard to develop the property over the years.\n\nNelson Annandale told the Samoa Observer the Beach party was the most appropriate way to celebrate the Resort’s birthday given that Samoa is known for her beaches.\n\n“In my opinion there is really not much happening on our beaches and we have a lovely beach here,” he said. “We actually had a similar event last year, however it was thrown together last minute and so this year, we wanted to increase the level of excitement and entertainment for our birthday and we brought down Ardijah.”\n\nMr. Annadale, who returned two years ago to help his mother, Sose Annandale, with the family business, said the future is bright for the Resort.\n\n“We are rebranding the company and so we’re trying align all the ducks in a row so that we would be able to move onto the next level and what Sinalei has always been destined for,” he said. We’re trying to move from a four star hotel to a five start hotel and that of course does take a lot of work, but it can be done. We are actually rebranding, marketing materials, running unique events, that kind of showcases the uniqueness of our property.”\n\nGovt. moves in cop couples\n\nFormer Police Constable, Seiloga Mauigoa, has broken his silence over Prime Minister Tuilaepa Dr. Sa’ilele Malielegaoi’s directive for couples working together at the Police to resign.\n\nHe said it’s “unfair treatment” and “discriminatory.” Mauigoa had been part of the Police force for seven years. He is married to a Police Officer and they have three children.\n\nThe Mauigoas were one of the 23 couple’s affected by the Prime Minister’s announcement in November 2017. He has kept his silence until now.\n\n“We pleaded with the Police Commissioner for some sort of financial incentive; however we were informed that the Government gave us a whole year to look for other job opportunities,” he said.\n\n“And the Government is right. We were given 12 months to seek other means of work.”\n\nThe father of three said the current regulation only targets married couple and it is clearly discriminatory.\n\n“What about the couples in defacto relationships, it is unfair.\n\nSamoa’s smiling Centenarian\n\nNot many people in Samoa reach the ripe old age of a hundred years.\n\nAt Saina in Upolu, centenarian Anaseini ‘Tupou’ Mafo’e, celebrated her 100th birthday.\n\nTupou was born on 21 February 1918. She is the mother of 13 children, three of whom have passed away. Nine are present in Samoa for her big day.\n\nTupou was married to the late Mafo’e Tupu of Saina. Her eldest daughter is 82 and lives in New Zealand. The youngest of her 13 children is 60-year-old prominent Pastor, Apostle Viliamu Mafo’e, of the Worship Centre Church.\n\nBorn in Tonga, she was brought to Samoa at the age of five after her father, Hagafili Tupou, passed away.\n\n“I cannot thank God enough for blessing me with 100 years to live on this earth,” she tells the Samoa Observer. “I am happy that me the ‘masta’ is still alive.”\n\nWorld mourns Reverend Billy Graham\n\nReverend Billy Graham, the magnetic, movie-star-handsome preacher who became a singular force in postwar American religious life, a confidant of presidents and the most widely heard Christian evangelist in history, died.\n\nHe was 99. “America’s Pastor,” as he was dubbed, had suffered from cancer, pneumonia and other ailments and died at his home in North Carolina.\n\nMore than anyone else, Graham built evangelicalism into a force that rivaled liberal Protestantism and Roman Catholicism in the U.S. His leadership summits and crusades in more than 185 countries and territories forged powerful global links among conservative Christians and threw a lifeline to believers in the communist bloc.\n\nGeoffrey Marfleet passes away\n\nAn English businessman who has made a huge difference in Samoa, Robert Geoffrey Marfleet, passed away.\n\nMr. Marfleet passed away peacefully at the North Shore Hospital, in Auckland New Zealand. He was 84.\n\nHis wife Malia Tammi Marfleet, their ten children and 17 grandchildren, relatives and friends paid tribute to a loving husband, father and a hard workingman who will be sorely missed.\n\nMrs. Marfleet remembered a man who lived an exemplary life.\n\n“He was diagnosed with cancer and the doctor said he has only weeks to live,” she said. “So as soon we were told, we talked and cried, talked and cried some more. His last words to me before he slipped into a coma were “where is my little girl - which is Luisa. Then he turned, looked at me and said I’m sorry I have tried. Obviously he was trying to stay alive for us.”\n\nMrs. Marfleet said it was a difficult time for her and her family.\n\nSogi family fights Govt. eviction in Court\n\nThe fight by the Tokuma family to stop the Government from evicting them from land they claim as their inheritance headed to Court.\n\nThe matter was called for hearing before Supreme Court Justice Leiataualesa Daryl Clarke.\n\nRepresenting the descendants of Turaroe Tokuma is lawyer, Pa’u Tafaogalupe Mulitalo. Tafailagi Peniamina of the Attorney General’s Office represented the Samoa Land Corporation (S.L.C.) and the Ministry of Public Enterprises.\n\nNanai Liutofagaomataafa Tokuma, the son of the late Turaroe Tokuma, from the Solomon Islands and the late Ulalemamae Leiataua, took the stand.\n\n“I’m not sure why my father came to Samoa in the first place but all I know is that he was the driver for Patrick Percival, the head of the Germans at that time,” said Nanai, 77.\n\n“My father was the driver for this man in the 1920s.”\n\nPa’u asked Nanai if he remembered what happened to his father in the 1920s.\n\n“My father was accused of killing a Chinese businessman at his shop, but at the end it wasn’t him,” said Nanai. “My father told me this because I wasn’t born during that time.\n\n“He was arrested and detained and then some men came and told the Court at the time that it was them who killed this Chinese businessman.”\n\nIn the end, the family lost the Court battle.\n\nFalefata becomes Pacific Games 2019 Chief\n\nCabinet appointed Falefata Hele Ei Matatia as the Chief Executive Officer of the 2019 Pacific Games.\n\nThe appointment was confirmed by the Minister of Education, Sports and Culture, Loau Keneti Sio.\n\n“The Cabinet and the Samoa Government has faith in Mr Falefata and his ability to take on the vast responsibilities that comes with being the C.E.O,” he said.\n\n“He was highly recommended by the panelists and given his vast knowledge in Sports; we opted for some new blood in the Pacific Games arena.\n\n“Falefata is young, smart, and energetic and given that we have just less than 16 months before the Pacific Games, we know he is the man for the job.”\n\nMARCH\n\nA life saving operation\n\nA Kiwi tourist got in trouble while enjoying the Papaseea Sliding Rocks was rescued by the Fire and Emergency Services Authority (F.E.S.A.).\n\nThe Search and Rescue team of F.E.S.A. was called after the woman became seriously injured at the bottom, unable to get back up the steep climb.\n\n“Yesterday, 27th Feb 2018, on Duty Shift from Faleata Station attended a call out regarding a New Zealand Tourist stranded on the river bank, after an incident she was involved in whilst sliding from the slippery rocks at Papaseea,” the statement from FESA reads.\n\n“The Kiwi tourist suffered from a twisted left ankle, and a broken left arm wrist as a result of the incident. The responding Crew offered treatment and secured her to the spinal long board and safely carried her on shoulder to the top, where the Ambulance stationed.”\n\nThe woman recovered and has returned home.\n\nFuimapoao resigns from Ministry of Women\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer of the Ministry of Women, Community and Social Development, Fuimapoao Beth Onesemo-Tuilaepa, tendered her resignation.\n\nBut she denied that her decision to resign, and therefore not reapply for her position, was related to a Public Service Commission (P.S.C.) investigation into the handling of “human resources matters” at the Ministry.\n\n“I have tendered my resignation and I have three more months to serve,” she told the Samoa Observer then. “My strength is strategic thinking, to start things moving but sometimes, in order to sustain, complete and see the changes through I think there is a need for a whole new set of skills. I think this time, it is time for someone new to come in, sustain and continue the changes.\n\n“It has nothing to do with the inquiry.”\n\nToddler suffocates in car\n\nA three-year-old toddler suffocated in a car.\n\nJacob Toa’i Key is alleged to have suffocated in a family car where he was found dead in Vaitoloa.\n\nJacob is the eldest of two siblings. He is the son of Telesia and Simeti Key from the villages of Alamagoto and Vaitoloa.\n\nDuring an interview with the Samoa Observer, Sivao Tasi, the grandmother, said she continues to have nightmares about his death. She said her grandson’s passing is something that would stay with her forever.\n\n“The car he died in was a small Getz, his parents’ car,” she said. “My other daughter found my grandson in the car not breathing. All the windows of the car were up.”\n\nSamoa welcomes Prime Minister Ardern\n\nNew Zealand Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, touched down in Samoa marking a historical first visit for the Labour Party leader.\n\nThe youngest woman to have held the Prime Ministership portfolio arrived on a Royal New Zealand Air Force Hercules with her partner, Clarke Gayford.\n\nMs. Ardern and her delegation including New Zealand’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Vaovasamanaia Winston Peters, was greeted on the tarmac at the Faleolo International Airport by Deputy Prime Minister, Fiame Naomi Mata’afa.\n\nSamoa was the first stop of Ms. Ardern’s Pacific tour, which also included a visit to Tonga, Niue and the Cook Islands.\n\nAmong the New Zealand delegation were other Cabinet Ministers and Members of Parliament, Carmel Sepuloni, Aupito William Sio, Fletcher Tabuteau, and National MPs Gerry Brownlee and Alfred Ngaro.\n\nThe visit comes after Foreign Minister Vaovasa promised to boost aid and embark on a new strategy with New Zealand’s Pacific neighbours.\n\nP.M. Ardern comes bearing $16 m gift\n\nNew Zealand offered NZ$9.5m (T$16.05 million) funding to help Samoa recover from Cyclone Gita and boost local businesses, as it looks to renew its foreign policy focus on the Pacific region.\n\nThe assistance was announced by the New Zealand Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, who kicked off her Pacific tour with a one and a half day stop in Samoa.\n\nPrior to their arrival, the New Zealand government had been talking about re-sharpening their focus on the Pacific amidst concerns about China’s growing dominance.\n\n“The Pacific overall has also become an increasingly contested strategic space, no longer neglected by Great Power ambition. So Pacific Island leaders have more options. This is creating a degree of strategic anxiety,” Minister Vaovasa had said. “We need to better pool our energies and resources to maintain our relative influence.”\n\nOn the sunny shores of Samoa where Ms. Ardern and delegation enjoyed a full on day, her government delivered with a financial injection that would be most welcomed by Prime Minister Tuilaepa Dr. Sa’ilele Malielegaoi’s administration.\n\nGovt. threatens families at Satapuala\n\nThe Government said it would not consider monetary demands by the four Satapuala families seeking relocation costs.\n\nPrime Minister Tuilaepa Sa’ilele Malielegaoi said they would take the families to Court for trespassing on Government property.\n\nThe families are living on Satapuala land where the Government intends to extend the Faleolo International Airport runway across.\n\nThe Tauvala’au family of Satapuala said they were told to leave by 28 February 2018.\n\nThe order was confirmed by Tua’ato Tauvalau Salausa, of Satapuala.\n\nBut the family is not moving. She said unless the Government pays them $1 million, they are not going anywhere.\n\nHowever Tuilaepa said they have already paid relocation costs to the said families. All the families have since been moved.\n\nCabinet orders Tribunal over booting of Inga\n\nCabinet ordered and appointed a Sports Disputes Tribunal to look into the removal of rugby legend, Fesola’i Va’aiga Tu’igamala, as President of the Samoa Amateur Boxing Association (S.A.B.A.).\n\nThe Cabinet decision follows a request that the “internal disputes within S.A.B.A.” – involving Fesola’i, Togatalima Faafouina Milford and others - are referred to the Samoa Sports Disputes Tribunal.\n\nFesola’i, a former All Black and Manu Samoa, returned to Samoa and had played a leading role in reviving professional boxing. At the beginning of 2017, he became the President of S.A.B.A., where boxing was eventually introduced into the schools as part of the development of the sport.\n\nBut things took an interesting twist last year when an “internal dispute” surfaced and things turned sour. He was eventually removed.\n\nAiono returns as P.S.C’s new Chairman\n\nAiono Mose Su’a was appointed the Chairman of the Public Service Commission.\n\nHe took over from former Chairman, Tuu’u Dr. Ieti Taulealo, whose contract ended after six years at the helm.\n\nPrime Minister Tuilaepa Sa’ilele Malielegaoi said: “Aiono is a qualified candidate for the job and is one of the Government’s longest serving chief executive officers.”\n\nTaxi driver stuffed in boot of car\n\nFour men were arrested and charged with aggravated robbery in connection with the taxi driver who was threatened and stuffed in the trunk of his taxi.\n\nThis was confirmed by Police Superintendent Auapa’au Logoitino Filipo.\n\n“They were arrested and charged with aggravated robbery and that is all I can say.”\n\nAuapa’au said the taxi driver picked up four men from Malifa to take to Vaoala.\n\n“When they reached Vaoala, the four men assaulted the complainant and put him inside the boot of the taxi. They then roamed around the whole night in the complainant’s taxi.”\n\nPacific Oil lands major U.S. deal\n\nLocal business, Pacific Oil, secured a joint venture with large U.S. multinational company, Dr. Bronners. Under the name “SerendiCoco Samoa”, the venture will see a commitment to export three thousand tonnes of coconut oil from Samoa to supply the U.S. manufacturer as well as support the conversion of local producers into organic certified and fair trade farmers.\n\nPrior to the merger, Pacific Oil primarily supplied Europe and was subject to unstable global prices for coconut oil.\n\nAccording to Pacific Oil’s Director, Fanene Samau Sefo, it was more often than not at a low price, which was not beneficial to the company and the farmers.\n\nBut things are about to change. Fanene said they expected their first shipment to go out at the end of this month. This comes after 18 months of preparing the groundwork to meet the requirements of their agreement.\n\n“With the new joint venture, we are now paying a much higher price for copra than we ever used to because the price is now good,” he said.\n\n“At the moment we have 1,050 farmers who sell to us, but that list is expanding because what we have done in the past 16 months is convert all our farmers who supply us into organic and Fairtrade farmers.\n\nHospital workers in Court\n\nThree hospital workers, charged and accused of stealing pharmaceutical products from the Hospital Pharmacy, appeared in Court.\n\nThey are Pio Fesola’i, Amanono Mafualo and Fou Sekone. The trio was accused of being part of an alleged ring to manufacture methamphetamine or ice.\n\nSupreme Court Justice, Leiataualesa Daryl Clark, presided.\n\nDoctors concerned over salaries\n\nThe possibility that the salaries of doctors working at the hospital will be reduced as part of the health sector merge did not sit well with the Samoa Medical Association (S.M.A).\n\nThis is according to S.M.A. President, Lauano Dr. Herbert Peters, who said they were meeting the Minister of Health, Tuitama Dr. Leao Tuitama, on the issue.\n\nSeveral doctors reached out to the Samoa Observer expressing concerns on the possibility that the merge of the Ministry of Health and National Health Services will reduce their salary.\n\nAnother senior physician, Motuopua’a Dr. Aisoli Vaai, who is also the Chairman of the Medical Council, also expressed his concerns.\n\n“If it is true they are looking at reducing the salaries of doctors then that would be the wrong move. For every hospital, there is a salary structure in terms of qualifications, longevity of service. That is really sad if that will happen.\n\n“And that is why after graduating with postgraduate degree they move overseas.\n\n“All other countries, the salaries for doctors are significant, because they save lives. That is what we do and that is fact,” he told the Samoa Observer.\n\nA first for the Pacific region\n\nSamoa took the lead in the Pacific region in piloting the first recycling and waste management association. The Samoa Recycling and Waste Management Association (S.R.W.M.A.) was launched by the association’s Patron and Prime Minister, Tuilaepa Sa’ilele Malielegaoi.\n\nS.R.W.M.A. aims to promote appropriate waste recycling and management practices by involving waste recyclers and management advocates in Samoa.\n\nN.H.S. Chief dares Minister\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer (C.E.O.) of the National Health Services (N.H.S.), Palanitina Tupuimatagi Toelupe, dared the Minister of Health, Tuitama Dr. Leao Tuitama, to reveal who was spreading “false rumours” in relation to the health merge.\n\nMrs. Toelupe would not speak to the Weekend Observer. But when the Weekend Observer contacted her in relation to the Minister’s claim that the N.H.S. management is spreading false rumours as part of conspiracies to sabotage the health sector merge, Mrs. Toelupe delivered the message through her Secretary, Temukisa.\n\nShe said the N.H.S. Chief Executive Officer did not want to comment but she wanted to pass on the message to the Samoa Observer.\n\n“You should go back and ask the Minister to identify who at the management level have been spreading rumours,” Temukisa said. “But she does not want comment.”\n\n“Dogs,” P.M. blasts Luatuanu’u attackers\n\nPrime Minister, Tuilaepa Dr. Sa’ilele Malielegaoi, compared the actions of the Luatunu’u men who blocked the road, endangered lives of the public and attacked the Police to that of “dogs.”\n\n“There is only one outcome for such actions,” Tuilaepa, who is also the Minister of Police, said. “They should spend time in jail at Tafaigata Prison. The actions by these young men are not that of humans, rather they are the actions of dogs.”\n\nThe Prime Minister made the point after Police Commissioner, Fuiava Egon Keil, confirmed that several untitled men from Luatuanu’u had been arrested as a result of civil unrest there. The arrests were made when more than 60 Police Officers descended upon Luatuanu’u to try and calm a situation there where angry men from Luatuanu’u had taken to block the road.\n\nSpeaking to the Samoa Observer, Fuiava confirmed that some Police officers were injured when they attempted to clear the roadblock. The men had allegedly thrown rocks at them.\n\n“Gentle giant” Dylan Mika passes\n\nThe rugby community in Samoa and New Zealand mourned the death of former Manu Samoa and All Black forward, Tiumalumanaia Dylan Mika.\n\nDescribed as a “warm, wonderful” and a “gentle giant” by families and friends, Tiumalu collapsed and died from a “suspected heart attack” at his home in Auckland, New Zealand. He was 45.\n\n“It is with great sadness that the family of Dylan announce that he passed away suddenly and unexpectedly [on] Tuesday, March 20,” the statement reads.\n\n“Dylan was a very much loved husband and father to Tracy and their daughter Marley, and dearly loved son, brother, uncle, cousin and friend.\n\n“He was a hugely talented athlete, well-respected in the Samoan community and abroad but just as importantly, to his friends and family a warm, wonderful, and caring man. Gone far too soon at the age of just 45.”\n\nSad day as La’auli Alan Grey called home\n\nSamoa lost an icon with the passing away of La’auli Alan Grey. The businessman, hotelier, “Good Samaritan” to countless people, La’auli died peacefully at the Tupua Tamasese Meaole Hospital, Moto’otua. He was 82.\n\nAffectionately referred to as the “father of Samoan rugby,” tributes about La’auli’s tremendous influence in Samoa and the Pacific region immediately followed from all over the world. Many took to social media to pay tribute to a hugely influential man with a loving heart. They remembered a man who was so generous he would help everyone and anyone – including animals.\n\nWhile his business achievements as the Owner of the iconic Aggie Grey’s Hotel among other high profile ventures need no introduction, mourners paid tribute the simple acts that truly reflected La’auli’s heart of gold to help the less fortunate.\n\nThey remembered the owner of the red Ford pick up truck who would stop on the road to pick up anyone who needed a ride to and from Tiavi. They acknowledged his work to feed the stray and family dogs along the way to his home every day.\n\nA devout Catholic with his loving wife, Marina Grey, La’auli lived a life of giving.\n\nHe donated on a monthly basis to the Little Sisters of the Poor and many other charitable causes. In business, La’auli helped many local businesses that turned to him in their hour of need. Despite his influence and success though, he was very low key and extremely private.\n\nBut it is rugby and how he helped to develop and raise the profile of the sport where his legacy will be cemented.\n\nAPRIL\n\nP.M. threatens to ban Facebook\n\nPrime Minister Tuilaepa Dr. Sa’ilele Maleilegaoi threatened to ban social media platforms from Samoa completely.\n\nThat will happen if “gutless anonymous bloggers” continue to use the freedom social media affords them to abuse Government officials and innocent members of the public.\n\n“The Government will do what it takes to settle this matter once and for all, even if it means banning Facebook,” Tuilaepa said.\n\n“Most governments have banned Facebook, and we have been holding back because of the positive impact of social media.”\n\nHe said the Government has had enough of faceless ghosts who use sites such as Facebook to post defamatory claims against unsuspecting victims.\n\nTuilaepa said these faceless writers have been posting countless allegations including extra marital affairs, corruption and sensitive details about public figures, their families and their children.\n\n“Because its all based on lies, those affected are government leaders,” he said.\n\n“Those behind the social media posts are driven by the devil, their hearts are filled with hatred and I’m certain they don’t rest at night as they continue to make up fabrications.”\n\nLupesoliai Parker loses WBO title\n\nLupesoliai La’auliolemalietoa Joseph Parker lost his World Boxing Organisation (W.B.O.) belt to Anthony Joshua in Cardiff but the brave young man from Samoa vowed to come back better and stronger.\n\nLupesoliai made the promise moments after a unanimous points decision went in favour of Anthony Joshua at the end of an intense fight at a sell-out Principality Stadium, Cardiff, Wales.\n\n“I was beaten by the better man tonight,” Lupesoliai said, speaking in the ring after the fight. “It was a great experience and I want to say thank you for the opportunity. I’ll take it on the chin and I’ll be back again. I’ll work harder next time and land more punches, I’ll be giving it another go, certainly.”\n\nParker went on to lose another close fight to Dillain Whyte before ending the year with a knock victory against Flores.\n\nMember of Council of Deputies Tuiloma passes away\n\nSamoa mourned the passing away of Member of the Council of Deputies, Tuiloma Pule Alaimoana Unasa Lameko Gae’e.\n\nTuiloma passed away at the Tupua Tamasese Meaole Hospital. He was 83.\n\n“Our family is deeply saddened by the passing of a man of great faith who always taught us the values of integrity, humility, respect, fairness, love and service for family, village, church and the people of Samoa,” the family said.\n\n“A lay preacher who loved the Lord, an orator and high chief who was rich with knowledge and pride for his Samoan heritage, a statesman, a politician, a Fellow chartered accountant, a farmer and a business man whose life was devoted to serve. Known to our family as ‘Meko’, he will be sorely missed.”\n\nA national holiday was declared to honour his service to Samoa on the day he was buried.\n\nN.U.S. honours Tapusatele Le Mamea\n\nThe man who played a leading role in establishing the National University of Samoa was honoured by the university.\n\nMember of the Council of Deputies and long serving former Member of Parliament, Tapusatele Le Mamea Tuiletufuga Lemalu Su’a Leatuavao Ropati Mualia, was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Political Science and Education during the graduation ceremony at the university.\n\nTapusatele is no stranger to the University, having being one of those behind the establishment of the institution. He was acknowledged for all the years that he has served Samoa and his contribution towards Samoa’s education system.\n\nFor Tapusatele, he took a journey down memory lane yesterday. He said that the journey of establishing the University in February 1984 was not easy.\n\nWith only 47 students in its early days, he still believed in his dream of giving back to his country.\n\nFast forward three decades later, the 73-year-old stood on the podium in front of 428 graduates, parents and friends to deliver his speech, which he described could only be achieved with passion and having a dream.\n\nCentral Bank cracks down on “One Coin” scheme\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Samoa, Maiava Atalina Ainu’u-Enari, confirmed an investigation into a scheme which uses middlemen to collect people’s money in the hope of gigantic returns.\n\nShe confirmed that they are investigating an ongoing scheme in Samoa known as “One Coin” or “One Life.” She declined to name any of the suspects. She also declined to confirm or deny reports that some prominent Church Ministers are involved. But Maiava said the Central Bank is taking the matter seriously.\n\nSamoa’s golden performance at Commonwealth\n\nSanele Mao lifted Samoa to golden heights when he won Samoa’s first gold medal at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games. It was one of two gold medals won by the weightlifting team at the Games.\n\nThe other was won by Feagaiga Stowers.\n\nTV3 under new ownership\n\nThe Apia Broadcasting Limited, which runs TV3, came under new ownership.\n\nMaposua Corey Keil and Nicholas Caffarelli acquired the network, previously owned by former Cabinet Minister and businessman, Hans Joachim Keil.\n\nTV3 confirmed the change of ownership.\n\n“After 12 years, the first ever privately owned Television Broadcasting station in the country has changed ownership. Apia Broadcasting Ltd. (TV3), was officially taken over by Maposua Corey Keil and Nicholas Caffarelli last Friday 6th April.\n\nTV3 was established 12 years ago by Hans Joachim Keil and members of his family as the first privately owned TV station in Samoa.\n\n“Our goal was to have a wide selection for our viewers especially family programs and movies that cater to families, especially children.”\n\nCourt dismisses Peseta’s appeal\n\nThe Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal brought by Peseta Vaifou Tevaga against former business associates in long-standing dispute about a nonu company.\n\nThe dispute involves Associate Minister of Cabinet and Prime Minister, Peseta who is up again against former Cabinet Minister, La’aulilemalietoa Polataivao Schmidt and others.\n\nThe decision was delivered by Justice Fisher, Justice Panckhurst and Justice Hansen of the Court of Appeal.\n\n“Where is love?” Former Head of State asks\n\nFormer Head of State, His Highness Tui Atua Tupua Tamasese Efi, revealed that he was reassured by the Office of the Attorney General that the Land Titles Registration Bill (L.T.R.) 2008 would not alienate customary lands.\n\nHis Highness Tui Atua said he had asked for clarity on the matter when he was given the L.T.R. Bill 2008 to sign into law.\n\n“In 2008 as Head of State, I was assured by the Attorney General that the provisions of the L.T.R. Bill would not impact in any way on the customary land rights of suli,” Tui Atua said in his address titled “O fea le alofa? Where is love?”.\n\n“The Attorney General and his or her office is tasked with a sacred duty to provide the Head of State with the best legal advice possible.”\n\nWith this assurance, Tui Atua signed the bill.\n\nThe former Head of State now shares a different view. During a media event at Tuaefu where he addressed the issues in relation to fears about the alienation of customary lands, Tui Atua said there is “ambiguity” in Article 102 of the Constitution that needs to be dealt with.\n\n“Today we have the responsibility of admitting that there is a problem with Article 102; that the ambiguity within is serious enough to warrant the attention of our best minds in order to make Article 102 unambiguous,” he said.\n\n“These minds, however, must be able to locate the principle of alofa in their custom law and statutory law assessments and have it sing in harmony alongside their assessments of pule, and of legal certainty and transparency.”\n\nChamber questions Govt. tax\n\nThe Samoa Chamber of Commerce and Industry expressed disappointment over the lack of consultation on the Customs and Tariff Bill, which will increase the cost of imported food items like chicken.\n\nChamber’s Chief Executive Officer, Lemauga Hobart Va’ai, said the Government’s handling of the matter “lacks transparency.”\n\n“The Samoa Chamber of Commerce and Industry is disappointed that once again, despite a standing agreement with the Government to have a ‘no surprises’ approach to any proposed changes to the policies and laws that impact on the private sector and consumers, import duties on imported frozen chicken are being imposed with little or no timely consultation,” Lemauga said.\n\n“Such an approach lacks transparency and fosters uncertainty which could regrettably result in job losses as well as higher end-user food costs.\n\n“Candid and timely dialogue would enable the Samoa Chamber of Commerce and Industry to provide fully informed impact assessments of any proposed changes as well as possible appropriate alternate solutions for addressing the issues underlying any proposed changes.”\n\nRest in love, Manamea!\n\nA brave warrior, hero, a princess and more. These were just some of the words used by many mourners to describe a modern Samoan warrior, Manamea Apelu Schwalger, who during the past few years has become the face of Samoa’s Pinktober and the fight against cancer.\n\nAffectionately known as “Mana,” she passed away peacefully at her home in Tanumapu’a after a battle with breast cancer and an incurable lung disease.\n\nShe was laid to rest at the Annandale Estate at Si’usega, after a service at Tanumapua Plantation House.\n\nManamea is the daughter of Galoioalolealofa Tuiletufuga and Taufua Simimaiau Apelu. Married to Asa’asa Tagaloa Su’a Alan Schwalger, they have five children, Sade, Tyrone, Zulaika, Manamea and Tuifeamalo.\n\nLoved by many, the former Miss South Pacific and Miss Samoa, was known for her strong advocacy work for cancer. She made a historical change to the iconic Town Clock in the heart of Apia, with the color pink for the whole month of October last year.\n\nMana used her speaking skills and public profile to go public with her breast cancer battle in Samoa. She wanted to raise awareness on the contributing risks to breast cancer in Samoa and found that many Samoan women shied away from discussing breast cancer. She hoped to shed light on the importance of early detection and recognising the symptoms of breast cancer.\n\nMinister of Justice denies claims\n\nThe Minister of Justice and Courts Administration (M.J.C.A.), Fa’aolesa Katopau Ainu’u, denied claims that Land and Titles Court files were removed from the vicinity of the Court and taken to his Office. The files are in relation to the Ainu’u title of Sapapali’i and one other about the “boundaries of Atua.”\n\nThe files were allegedly delivered by the Ministry of Justice and Courts Administration employee, Tu’ulima Io, to the Minister’s Office. He was accompanied by the Secretary of Chief Executive Officer, Papali’i John Taimalelagi.\n\n“I took the boxes of files to the Minister’s Office; I was escorted by the C.E.O.’s Secretary,” Mr. Io told the Samoa Observer. “When I reported this matter to the Chief Justice; I told him that I was instructed by the C.E.O. to take these boxes of files.\n\n“I followed orders even though I know deep down that this was wrong. I don’t care what the outcome of this is, but at least I came clean and reported the matter to the Chief Justice.”\n\nHe also gave the Samoa Observer a document that lists the names of 10 Land and Titles Court files that were allegedly removed from the Court and taken to the Minister’s Office in October 2016.\n\nAsked for a comment, Minister Fa’aolesa said: “That is not true. I cannot respond to the questions if you will not tell me who said these things to you.”\n\nBut Mr. Io said he was the one who delivered the files in 2016, upon instructions from his superior.\n\nAt the time, he was the driver for the Chief Executive Officer of M.J.C.A., Papali’i John Taimalelagi.\n\n“I took the boxes of files to the Minister’s Office; I was escorted by the C.E.O.’s Secretary,” he said. “I have already reported this to the Chief Justice earlier this month.”\n\nFiame hits back at Tui Atua\n\nDeputy Prime Minister, Fiame Naomi Mata’afa, issued a very brief response to concerns expressed by the former Head of State, His Highness Tui Atua, about customary lands and Samoa’s land laws.\n\n“He signed the law,” Fiame said. “I don’t know what more to say other than I have no comment.”\n\nIn a public address last week, His Highness Tui Atua warned that the wording of Article 102 of the Constitution is ambiguous. He fears that this could be negatively exploited and could lead to the alienation of customary lands.\n\nThe law Fiame is referring to is the Land Titles Registration Act 2008, which was signed into law by Tui Atua when he was the Head of State.\n\nGovt. debt $1.1 billion, Central Bank says\n\nThe Government’s total debt stands at $1.1 billion. This was according to the figures released by the Samoa Bureau of Statistics (S.B.S.) Financial Statistics for the December 2017 quarter. The statistics are issued by the Central Bank.\n\nThe stats also reveal that Samoa’s debt to China is $416 million, making China Samoa’s biggest creditor.\n\nThe amount is higher than what Samoa owes the Asia Development Bank; World Bank and Japan. In January, Prime Minister, Tuilaepa Sa’ilele Malielegaoi rejected reports that Government debt to China had reached “billions”.\n\n“It’s wrong, it’s totally wrong,” he told the Samoa Observer back in Janaury.\n\n“Look for a report issued by the Central Bank that is where the accurate information is found. It also indicates the amount (owed) to China.”\n\nMAY\n\nSir Bryan Williams dedicates knighthood to Samoa\n\nFormer Manu Samoa Coach, Tuifa’asisina Bryan Williams, was honoured for his services to rugby in New Zealand and Samoa.\n\nThe Sir Bryan Williams knighthood was officially invested upon the humble Samoan during a ceremony in Auckland. He hopes the Samoan community would be equally proud of him as New Zealand. Sir Bryan was honoured during a ceremony presided over by New Zealand’s Governor General, Dame Pasty Reddy.\n\nSir Bryan, 67, was honoured for his long-serving involvement in rugby in New Zealand and Samoa since the 1960s.\n\nChina tells Samoa to “refrain” from Taiwan\n\nChina called on Samoa to reaffirm its support for the “One China policy,” and to refrain from any engagement with Taiwan. The call was made in Beijing, China, by China’s Vice Minister for International Liaison Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (I.D.C.P.C.), Guo Yezhou.\n\nMr. Guo met with a Parliament delegation from Samoa that was on a fact-finding mission in the People’s Republic of China. The delegation was led by Senior Member of Parliament, Gatoloaifaana Amataga Alesana-Gidlow.\n\n“China is the only country which has not been reunited yet,” Mr. Guo is quoted as saying in a statement issued by the Government’s Press Secretary.\n\n“That is why the Taiwan issue and the One China policy are very important to China’s territorial integrity and sentiment to China’s 1.3 billion people so I believe that our Samoan friends can understand and support China’s position.”\n\nHe assured Samoa that China is “resolute in reuniting our country and one day Taiwan will come back to the motherland.”\n\nP.M. blames ‘lack of education’\n\nPrime Minister Tuilaepa Dr. Sa’ilele Malielegaoi blamed the Manu Samoa Sevens poor form on the H.S.B.C. World Sevens Series on the lack of education.\n\nThe Chairman of the Samoa Rugby Union has rejected criticisms of Sir Gordon Tietjens, leveling the blame on the players and their ability to learn.\n\n“It is not the coach,” Tuilaepa said. “This is solely the result of the players performance. Keep in mind some of the players were not educated properly.\n\n“Looking at players from Africa and Britain, if you ask about their educational backgrounds, you will find that they attend universities.\n\n“But what about our players? Well that is the struggle faced by the coach given that our players, some of whom did not reach standard four.”\n\nStandard Four is the equivalent of Year 4 in Primary School today.\n\nFijian workers allowed to go home\n\nThe two Fijian workers in the middle of a dispute that had been investigated by several Government authorities were allowed to go home.\n\nAssistant Chief Immigration Officer, Siaopo Pese, confirmed that the Stop Order issued against Tuipolotu Talatoka and Salaseini Serukeitoga, had been lifted.\n\nThe Fijian women were kept in Samoa after their employer, Lei’ataualesa Jerry Brunt, had filed a complaint with the Police, accusing them of removing items from his residence.\n\n“The case had since been closed as the Police do not have sufficient evidence against the Fijian women,” Siaopo told the Weekend Observer.\n\nMs. Talatoka and Ms. Serukeitoga had been brought to Samoa by Lei’ataualesa for work. Ms. Talatoka was to work as a nanny while Ms. Serukeitoga as a housemaid.\n\nThis was until the Easter Week when the Fijian women left the residence of Lei’ataua. In a letter published by the Samoa Observer yesterday, Lei’ataualesa, who is a lawyer by profession, accused the Fijians of removing valuable items from their home. He claimed that his family is the victim in the matter.\n\nFormer Head of State “fooled” by “small lawyers”, P.M. says\n\nPrime Minister Tuilaepa blamed “small lawyers” who “walk everywhere” and make a lot of “noises for fooling” the former Head of State, His Highness Tui Atua Tupua Tamasese Efi.\n\nThe Prime Minister refused to name the lawyers except to say these “small lawyers” don’t understand the Constitution. He added that they had based overseas all their lives and have only just come to Samoa “yesterday.”\n\nTuilaepa was responding to Tui Atua’s claims that there is “ambiguity” in Article 102 of the Constitution in relation to customary land ownership.\n\n“The former Head of State has been fooled by these wannabe small lawyers,” Tuilaepa said. “Since the beginning and up until now, there is no part of Section 102 of the Constitution that should be amended or appear unclear. There is no ambiguity whatsoever. It is so clear. The Attorney General told me that it crystal clear. If I knew there was an ambiguity, I would’ve stood up long time ago to make it clear.”\n\nWoman lands top Police role\n\nSamoa welcomed her first female Deputy Police Commissioner in Papali’i Monalisa Tiai-Keti.\n\nThe appointment was confirmed by the Police Commissioner, Fuiava Egon Keil, in a media statement.\n\n“The Commissioner of Police and the Samoa Police Service (S.P.S.) warmly congratulate Acting Assistant Commissioner Papalii MonalisaTiai-Keti on her new appointment as Deputy Commissioner of Police,” the statement reads.\n\nDeputy Commissioner Papali’i joined the Police Service in 2004 as a Constable.\n\nShe is a former Samoa College student, and holds a Bachelor of Social Science from Waikato University.\n\nP.M. Tuilaepa attacks Pohiva\n\nAn interesting exchange broke out between Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sa’ilele Malielelgaoi and his Tongan counterpart, Akilisi Pohiva.\n\nIt led to Prime Minister Tuilaepa accusing Mr. Pohiva of being jealous of Samoa.\n\nTuilaepa made the comment in response to Mr. Pohiva questioning Samoa’s ranking on the World Press Freedom Index.
