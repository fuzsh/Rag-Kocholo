        "text": "While this month’s first book from New Zealand was, quite literally, out of this world, the second is a rather more down-to-earth affair. We’ll be spending some time down near windy Wellington, with the occasional quick visit to Auckland, and as well as heading back to the eighties, we’ll be revisiting our school days, in the form of a year in primary school. It’s not all maths and soggy sandwiches, though, as there’s a shadow hanging over the class – this will be a year none of the children are likely to forget in a hurry…\n\n*****\n\nCatherine Chidgey’s Pet (review copy courtesy of Europa Editions) begins in a nursing home in Auckland in 2014, where Justine, along with her daughter Emma, is visiting her father. A carer with a rather familiar face sparks a train of memories, and we soon find ourselves at the other end of North Island in 1984, where young Justine is in her final year of primary school, under the guidance of a new teacher. With her American car and glamorous appearance, Mrs Price bowls over pupils and parents alike, and all the children long to be her little helper after class and receive a smile and some kind words.\n\nJustine is no exception, and when Mrs Price learns that the girl’s mother recently passed away, she begins to pay special attention to her, and eventually to her father, too. However, life in class becomes more complicated when items start going missing from the children’s desks and bags. When nobody owns up, Mrs Price encourages the children to share their thoughts on the matter – and Justine and her best friend Amy are the main suspects…\n\nPet refers to ‘teacher’s pet’, the role all of the students long to play, and Chidgey’s novel puts a nice spin on this idea by showing how uneasy the relationship between a teacher and a favoured student can be. Although the novel is narrated by Justine (both looking back at her schooldays and wondering about her father’s new carer), the character dominating the novel is Mrs Price, a woman of many talents, and many secrets:\n\nShe was new to town and new to St Michael’s that year, and younger than our parents, and prettier than our mothers, who wore fawn slacks and plastic rain bonnets. She made us feel special just by the way she looked at us, as if we had something important to say and she couldn’t wait to hear it.\n\npp.20/1 (Europa Editions, 2023)\n\nAngela, as Justine is soon encouraged to call her, has a touch of stardust about her, a glamour that’s a little out of place at a Catholic primary school, yet from the start, there are hints that all is not as it seems, that there’s a darkness lurking beneath the stylish clothes and sunny demeanour.\n\nThe plot is moved along by two main events. The first is the teacher’s relationship with Justine, and then with her father, leading to Angela spending more time with her student outside school. The second is the string of thefts, and the way suspicion is turned towards Amy, whose Chinese heritage leads the children to use her as a scapegoat. On an excursion to the beach, Mrs Price says:\n\n“It’s nature, my darling. If you’re at the bottom of the food chain you can’t do anything about it, and if you’re at the top, well, you can’t do anything about that either. It’s what you’re born to.” (p.81)\n\nShe may be talking about marine life, but it ties in chillingly with what’s happening at school, where the children close ranks against Amy, without proof.\n\nOne aspect of Pet that works particularly well is the characterisation of our narrator, Justine. She’s someone we can certainly feel sorry for, given the loss of her mother and her epileptic seizures, but she’s also just a young girl, and prone to being swayed by the crowd. Knowing that it’s unfair, she nevertheless distances herself from her best friend, especially when the teacher herself begins to pressure Amy. In addition, as is the case with all first-person narrators, it would be a foolish reader who takes everything she says at face value, and perhaps what she isn’t telling us is just as important as what she does reveal.\n\nPet rolls along nicely in a number of short chapters, but it’s a far more complex book than it appears. There are many layers to the story, with minor characters such as Sister Bronislava, a nun with a traumatic past, and Dom, a classmate who refuses to bow to peer pressure, each getting their moments in the spotlight, and proving important to the flow of the book. Chidgey constructs the story superbly, with the reader guessing where things might go, but never quite sure because of the doubt caused both by Justine’s voice, and her seizures. One thing that’s certain is that there’s a distinctly dark tone to the novel, and it only gets darker as we approach the end.\n\nAnother feature of the book I suspect readers will enjoy is the little glimpses of Kiwi culture we’re shown over the course of the novel. There’s the evening spent on the sofa watching the 1983 Miss Universe pageant (won by local woman Lorraine Downes) and a mention of the All Blacks rugby team (of course!), as well as several fun jabs at the provincialism of the New Zealand of the time:\n\n…I waved to Mrs Fong as I passed. She was stacking oranges out the front, unwrapping them from their layers of purple tissue and placing each one with its tiny green star at the top, while Amy served at the counter. “What are they meant to be?” I heard a customer ask as he eyed a small pile of avocados. (pp.70/1)\n\nWhat is a fun joke at the time later becomes more sinister, when the children say much nastier things about Amy, and her parents’ business.\n\nA whodunnit and an examination of classroom dynamics, Pet is an excellent read, an enjoyable look at what happens when trust is misplaced, and when prejudice replaces fairness. It’s certainly a book I’d recommend, and while I’ve done my best to tantalise rather than reveal over the course of my take on the novel, there is just one more thing I’d like to draw your attention to, and that’s the cover. Rest assured that as stylish as it is, there’s also a fair amount of substance and foreshadowing going on, too…"
