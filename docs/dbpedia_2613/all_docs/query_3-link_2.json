        "text": "Mainland contestants of this year's Miss Asia Pageant have complained about the alleged unfairness of the beauty contest and demanded that the organisers, ATV, explain the voting results.\n\nSome of the eight mainland contestants who did not make it to the final five have been voicing their discontent, either on their blogs or in interviews.\n\nDanae Shen, an 18-year-old contestant from Liaoning , questioned the results on her blog.\n\n'All the mainland contestants lost in this contest and have already returned to their respective hometowns,' Ms Shen wrote.\n\n'But did all eight of us have so few votes?'\n\nThe pageant this year scrapped the usual panel of judges in favour of public voting through the internet and mobile phones, to mark its 20th anniversary.\n\nThere were 20 finalists, including six Hongkongers, eight mainlanders and one Taiwanese.\n\nThe rest were from elsewhere in the region.\n\nHongkongers Eunis Yao and Belinda Yan were crowned champion and first runner-up, respectively, on December 7. Lene Lai of Taiwan was second runner-up, while the fourth and fifth positions were taken by Hongkongers Bonnie Yuen and Tanya Manifold.\n\nBut it was discovered that the voting results were different from the final outcome.\n\nVotes for some of the contestants were removed in the lead-up to the final after tens of thousands of ballots were found to have been cast for the same contestant at a time.\n\nThe discrepancies prompted the television station to set up an independent committee to investigate.\n\n'All the unhappiness and unfairness that we have experienced during the contest have been kept in our hearts,' Ms Shen wrote.\n\n'Here are the number of votes and the winners. Whether they will be altering the results, it won't matter any more.'\n\nAmy Ma from Shandong said she heard the results were pre-determined a few days before the final. She also questioned why she received so few votes.\n\nAda Wang from Yunnan told the mainland press that if ATV failed to give a proper explanation, she would call on other mainland contestants to take action.\n\nATV said no action would be taken until the committee completed its investigation in two months."
