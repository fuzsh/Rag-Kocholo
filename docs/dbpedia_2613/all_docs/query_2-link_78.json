        "text": "Piers Plowman is one of the most highly regarded late medieval English poems, although at times it can also be one of the more frustrating works, in large part because of its existence in three distinct versions (A, B, and C) and its complex transmission history. In this essay we examine the scholarship regarding the manuscripts and the scribes of Piers Plowman, from W. W. Skeat onwards, and we also explore new tools now available for the study of the manuscripts, such as the Piers Plowman Electronic Archive, which promise to change the way we read, teach, and research the poem.\n\nThis essay argues that in The Shepheardes Calender, Spenser takes advantage of lessons learned from Richard Mulcaster and the example of Chaucer to situate himself as a poet furthering the project of language formation in English via what I call the “Chaucer-function.” The “Chaucer-function” is a set of authorial effects built into the poem, comprised of two components: first, an active process of basing authorship on a “collection of authors” who (using Mulcaster’s ideas about language “enfranchisement”) bring various linguistic backgrounds into play within a text, and the subsequent, interrelated effect of attribution based on the incorporation of words from those backgrounds into poetic diction. I argue that Spenser constructs his authorship of The Shepheardes Calender on the different speech backgrounds of the shepherds and their tendency to interpret and mediate each other’s poetic utterances. “Reader-critics” within the text respond to the collection of authors, helping Spenser attain the reputation for language-formation in English that had built up around Chaucer over the previous two centuries."
