Click the full post to read liner notes, links to more information, and a transcript of the episode.\n\nPatreon backers also have a half-hour bonus episode available, on “S.F. Sorrow is Born” by the Pretty Things.\n\nTilt Araiza has assisted invaluably by doing a first-pass edit, and will hopefully be doing so from now on. Check out Tilt’s irregular podcasts at http://www.podnose.com/jaffa-cakes-for-proust and http://sitcomclub.com/\n\nAlso, a one-time request here — Shawn Taylor, who runs the Facebook group for the podcast and is an old and dear friend of mine, has stage-three lung cancer. I will be hugely grateful to anyone who donates to the GoFundMe for her treatment."
