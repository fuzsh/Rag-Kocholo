Miss Anna was thirteen years of age, had been going to school to Prof. Holt, of Oakland, and was taken at the school with inflammation of the bowels. All medical aid that could be had was without avail. She was the pride of her parents, and a favorite of the neighborhood in which she lived, and will be sadly missed. We drop the tear of sympathy with the bereaved parents, and though she cannot come to them, they may go to her on the “other shore.” [Interment in Laas Cemetery]\n\nColorado Citizen, February 9, 1882\n\nLaas, Caroline (Brune)\n\nWeimar Lady Passes\n\nWeimar--Funeral services for Mrs. C.

J. Laas of Oakland\n\nThe funeral of C. J. Laas of Oakland, which took place in this city Tuesday afternoon was one of the most largely attended ever witnessed in this section, and was a true testimonial and tribute of respect to one of the best citizens, neighbors and friends Colorado county ever possessed. Mr. Laas’ death was unexpected, in that it was understood he was doing nicely in the way of recovering from a severe attack of illness, and the news of his sudden death early Monday morning caused a feeling of gloom to pervade the hearts of our people, who for so many years had known and respected this most estimable gentleman. His loss to the community and county at large, while of course not to be compared to that of his family, is nevertheless keenly felt, for throughout its borders he was known and popularly regarded as one of its best and most upright citizens.

There was a circus performance in the afternoon, many people were in town, Young Wm. Hoeer rode in from the country, left his horse, a very spirited animal, hitched in front of the residence of E. Lang, and went to the circus. Mr. Lang and his wife were out buggy riding. The only occupants of the house at the time were several small children, the oldest a little boy about ten years of age, not knowing the danger, concluded he would take a ride; went out unhitched the horse, placed the hitch rope upon the horn of the saddle, and succeeded in getting on. The horse started off briskly, which frightened the little fellow who began screaming. This excited the horse, who was soon in full speed and in dodging,around the fence corner unseated the poor little fellow, and in falling his foot was caught in the hitch rope which was wound around the horn of the saddle, falling in such a manner that his head just touched the ground. He was dragged over the rough wood for over a half mile in that position, kicked at every leap by the infuriated animal; when the horse was stopped and the little fellow cut loose, life was gone. It's impossible to describe the appearance of the little mangled and bruised body when turned over to the undertaker.\n\nMrs. P. Hargon and Mrs. M.

Larsen had died at his home in this city shortly after 12 o'clock Saturday night, sorrow spread throughout the city and section, for Martin Larsen was one of our best citizens.\n\nOur people could scarcely believe the news for only the day before Mr. Larsen was on our streets, robust and healthy. Shortly after 1 o'clock Saturday afternoon while at the home of his sister, Mrs. L. O. Clark at Chesterville, he became ill. Feeling better, he went to his rice field where he was caught in a heavy rain and again became ill. He was brought to his home in Eagle Lake and a physician summoned.

Clark of Chesterville and Mrs. Carey Miller of Alleyton, Illinois also survive.\n\nMr. Larsen was extensively engaged in rice and watermelon farming.

In his dealings with his fellows he was just and honorable. He was a good neighbor, a good husband, a good father, and as citizen he was helpful and useful. This writer has known him since he located at Chesterville nineteen years ago and in all this time found nothing in his life to criticize or condemn. We have heard many speak of his worth and his good traits, but not one word against him have we ever heard.\n\nFuneral services were conducted at the home Monday afternoon, with Rev. J. C. Wilson of Edna, formerly pastor of the Methodist church here, and a loved friend of the family, conducting the services. Burial was made in the Chesterville Cemetery.

Herbert\n\nW. H. Lasater Died AT His Home Last Tuesday Following Brief Illness\n\nPopular Young Manager of Schuhmacher Grocer Company Died After Only Few Days’ Illness\n\nA gloom of sadness was spread over the entire community when the news was learned on Tuesday morning that Mr. W. H. Lasater was dead.\n\nHe had been ill for a little more than a week with diphtheria, and though for several days his condition had been serious, his death came as a great shock to his friends everywhere.\n\nMr. Lasater was one of the most popular men that has ever lived in Eagle Lake. He moved here about seven years ago from Aledo, Texas and was manager here for Swift & Company. Five years ago he resigned his position with Swift to become traveling salesman in this territory for the Schuhmacher Grocer Company. After serving in this capacity for about a year, he was offered a promotion by the company, going to Smithville as manager of the Schuhmacher Company’s house at that place. And again he was given a promotion, being offered the management of the house here three years ago when the former manager, Mr. E. Middleton, went to Victoria to take the management of the Schuhmacher house at that place. Since that time, Mr. Lasater has been in charge of the Schuhmacher Grocer Company’s business at this place.\n\nUniversal regret is expressed over Mr. Lasater’s death, for he was liked by every person who knew him. If he had an enemy we have never heard of it. He was one of the most pleasant, agreeable gentlemen that we have ever known and he numbered his friends by his acquaintances. He has had wonderful success in the management here for the Schuhmacher Company, and he was esteemed highly as a friend and business man by the officers of that company.\n\nMr. Lasater was a devoted member of the Christian church and was one of the deacons of that congregation at this place. He was a member of the board of alderman of Eagle Lake, having led the ticket at the election, showing the universal popularity of the man in his home town. He was thirty-five years of age, just in the bloom of life, and his sad death is sincerely regretted by everyone. Mr. Lasater was a man of ability, of splendid business qualifications, and a man of character, clean life and high morals. He was always in a good humor, so pleasant and so friendly. This disposition made for him large numbers of friends wherever he went, for Herbert Lasater was a man that to be with was to like. He was open, fair and frank in all things. He was honest as the days are long, and his word was as good as his bond. He never practiced deception and he had a way all of his own in which he won his friends even closer to him  a way that made you realize that he liked you.\n\nMr. Lasater’s mother arrived from Tennessee Wednesday afternoon, having been advised of the serious condition of her son, but did not learn of his death until after her arrival here. The remains were shipped on the Santa Fe Wednesday afternoon, accompanied by his mother, wife and little daughter to Aledo, the former home, where the funeral was held.\n\nDuring the sixteen years of the existance [sic] of the Headlight, at no time have we been called on to chronicle the passing of a friend in whose death we have felt more sadness, for we esteemed him as a friend, and our association with him in life will ever be held among our treasures in memory.\n\nTo his wife and sweet little daughter and to the mother, upon whom grief has laid its heavy hand, the Headlight extends from the depths of its heart its sincere sympathy and to him who has gone on that journey from whence no9 traveler ever returns, good-bye and may your last, long sleep be sweet, old friend.\n\nEagle Lake Headlight, December 28, 1918\n\nSubmitted by Judy Talkington\n\nLatham, Nicholas Aaron\n\nLatham\n\nGraveside services for Nicholas Aaron Latham, stillborn infant of Rex and Pamela Latham of Weimar, Will be held Friday, Feb. 13 at 10 a.m. in the Masonic Cemetery in Weimar.

His death occurred at the family home here at 12:20 Friday morning, following an illness of only two or three days, although he had been in failing health for the past few years. He was taken dangerously ill Tuesday, his heart being affected, and although every attention possible wa given him by family physician, nurse, family and friends, it was without avail. The end came quickly and peacefully, and this pioneer merchant and business man passed into the Great Beyond. there to await the coming of his loved ones left here on earth.\n\nIt was the wish of Mr. Lauterstein (often expressed in life) and of his family that he be buried in a Jewish cemetery at San Antonio, and this wish was complied with. Arrangements were made and the funeral party left here on the 1:15 train Friday afternoon for San Antonio. Pall bearers designated by the family were as follows: E. Fahrenthold, A. P. Shatto, G. W. Shaver, John H. Brooks, A. Reissner and H. Brasher.\n\nThe following escort from the local Masonic Lodge accompanied the remains to San Antonio: Ben B. Holt, Geo. Herder, Jr., Geo. F. Loessin, B. B. Braun, Jack Brasher and Elliott Hubbard. Arriving in San Antonio the remains ware taken in charge by Masons of that city and after services by a Jewish rabbi, the Masons again took charge and laid the body to rest with fitting ceremonies. Fully thirty or more friends of the family accompanied the remains to San Antonio. The bereft ones returned home Saturday evening.\n\nMr. Lauterstein was 70 years of age. Although well along in years. he was a man of remarkable vigor and energy up to a few years ago, when it became necessary for him to undergo a serious operation. After that time it was noted that his health and strength were failing, although he kept up and about almost to the very last. The seriousness of the illness that attacked him Tuesday of last week was realized from the first. However, family and friends hoped that he would be able to live through it. But it was not to be.\n\nMr. Lauterstein was born in Tilset, Germany. He came to this country at an early age, and being a man of naturally friendly disposition be soon became acquainted with hundreds of people extending from extreme West Texas to the Texas coastal section. He had the faculty of never forgetting a face or friend, and due to this fact it was nothing remarkable for him to recognize friends whom he had not seen for thirty or forty years. Locating in Weimar in 1886 he engaged in the mercantile business, and was singularly successful. A few years later he was united In marriage to Miss Bertha Gabert of Waco, who, with her sons, Mannie and George, survive, as well as two brothers, one residing in New York, the other in San Antonio.\n\nMr. Lauterstein's business grew slowly but surely through the years that followed, and here in Weimar he erected one of the finest brick business houses and installed one of the finest dry goods stocks to be found between Houston and San Antonio. His business continued to grow, and following this he established another fine store in LaGrange. The weight of years beginning to make Itself felt upon even this robust man, he decided to retire from active business, and placed his son, Mannie, in charge of the Weimar business, while his son, George, was given active charge of the LaGrange establishment. Both institutions proved successful, and are regarded as the leading dry goods houses of South Texas.\n\nMr. Lauterstein was a man of large affairs, and besides his mercantile interests was a stockholder in many of the leading banks from Houston to San Antonio. He was a man who never forgot a friend, and he helped hundreds and perhaps thousands with financial assistance during his lifetime. He believed in charity, and practiced it. He was a contributor to practically every religious denomination throughout this section, as well as churches and institutions conducted by the Jewish faith in the big cities. He was ever solicitous of the welfare of his friends, and ever ready to help with financial assistance or in any other way that he could. The last words that the writer had with this good man, were of advice and counsel, for he was always interested in the welfare of his friends. The writer was intimately acquainted with Mr. Lauterstein for a period of over forty years and in all those years there was never a time when a favor or help was ever refused by him. Truly in his passing we have lost one of our best and most treasured friends.\n\nA peculiar coincidence about Mr. Lauterstein's death was that it occurred on the 38th anniversary of his wedding day.\n\nTo the bereaved widow and sons our heartfelt sympathy is extended. Theirs is indeed a heavy, irreparable loss, and in their misfortune and sorrow we commend them to that great God above who is able to comfort all.\n\nWeimar Mercury, March 15, 1929, page 1\n\nLavenduski, Mrs. C\n\nLavenduski, Lena\n\nHouston Post Specials: Eagle Lake, May 24.--Mrs. C.
