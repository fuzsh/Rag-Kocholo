        "text": "Tonight’s NBA Lottery could prove the most significant since the one held in 2003, when Cleveland landed the privilege of drafting a then-senior at St. Vincent-St. Mary High in Akron, Ohio, LeBron James.\n\nThe winner of tonight’s sweepstakes will almost certainly select Kentucky’s John Wall.\n\nAlthough he’s a marvelous player, he’s not going to have the impact on the NBA that Dwight Howard (selected in 2004) has had.\n\nAnd even his biggest admirers – and I put myself into that category – would be hesitant to suggest that he will be certainly on the same tier that Deron Williams, Chris Paul, Derrick Rose and Rajon Rondo currently occupy on the hierarchy of NBA point guards.\n\nBut I have a hunch that where the rights to Wall land tonight could influence where James plays next season.\n\nIf the Clippers are fortunate tonight, a roster that would include the two top candidates for Rookie of the Year – remember, 2009 No. 1 pick Blake Griffin missed this season with a knee injury and will be a rookie next season – as well as Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman and Baron Davis might be a tempting option for James, soon to be most sought-after free agent in sports history.\n\nOf course, the New Jersey Nets – should they get the top pick tonight – would have three pretty solid pieces in Wall, future all-star center Brook Lopez and guard Devin Harris to surround James with.\n\nThat being said … after feeling about 90 percent sure that James would eventually re-sign with Cleveland, I’ve done a 180 on that opinion after Boston’s dominance of the Cavaliers in the second-round Eastern Conference semifinal series.\n\nAt least for the time being, there aren’t enough other quality pieces on the Cavaliers’ roster around the best basketball player in the world to win an NBA title.\n\nMy gut feeling is that he ends up with the Chicago Bulls, where he could join Derrick Rose and the likes of Joakim Noah to form the foundation of a franchise much more capable of winning a title that Cleveland is in its current form.\n\nOther stuff\n\nThe third Black and Gold Gala – an event to honor the Long Beach State men’s volleyball program – is set for Saturday night at the Law Offices of Keesal, Young and Logan in Long Beach (400 Oceangate).\n\nTom Ashen (who played during the 1971-73 seasons) and Tom Thornton (1974-78) will be the 21st and 22nd former 49ers to be Wall of Honor inductees.\n\nThings begin at 6 p.m., with dinner, ceremony and silent auction following at about 7. Tickets are $100. To join in the fun, go to www.longbeachstate.com/rsvp.\n\nJunior Brooke Turner, who threw 14 shutout innings, allowing six singles and one walk while fanning 16, to help the Long Beach State sweep UC Riverside in a season-ending three-game series over the weekend, was honored as the Big West Conference’s Pitcher of the Week Monday for the third time this season. It was the 13th time she won that award.\n\nThe 2nd All-Coaches Open Golf Tournament is set for Saturday at the Menifee Lake Country Club.\n\nEntry fee – which includes greens fees, practice range, cart and tournament prize – is $70, with golfers participating in a hole-in-one contest for a new car and $1 million.\n\nThe event will have an NBA flavor, although non-basketball coaches are invited.\n\nFor more information, go to www.palmspringscoachesclinic.com or call (760) 238-6309.\n\nFormer Long Beach State basketball player Tony Ronzone (1986-88) was hired Monday as an assistant general manager with the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nRonzone, a guard who backed up Morlon Wiley and Billy Walker during Ron Palmer’s final season as the 49ers’ head coach and Joe Harrington’s first, spent the past nine years working for the Detroit Pistons.\n\nA nifty hoops tidbit: Ronzone started in front of Brian Shaw, now an assistant coach with the Lakers, when both were seniors for an Oakland Bishop O’Dowd team that lost to John Williams and Crenshaw in the 1983 CIF title game.\n\nSix-foot-five Stephen Maxwell of Taft High – one of the better college prospects in the Southland who hasn’t received a lot of recruiting attention as of yet – scored a game-high 23 points with nine rebounds for the Black team although the White prevailed, 68-65, Sunday evening at Lawndale High during the Fullcourt Press Showcase’s Junior game.\n\nSix-one Anthony Martinez of Gahr hit a buzzer-beating 3-pointer from the left wing in overtime to lead the White past the Black, 87-85, in the Sophomore Showcase.\n\nMartinez, who could blossom into one of the area’s better players next season, had 19 points, six rebounds and six assists.\n\nSix-five Darien Williams (a recent transfer from Gahr to Katella) had 16 points and nine rebounds while blocking five shots to help the White beat the Black, 72-54, in the Freshman Showcase."
