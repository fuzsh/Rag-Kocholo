        "text": "Lady Falcons Can't Keep Up With The Jones's of West Ridge\n\nAfter losing one of its key players, West Ridge is getting a little more production from a variety of sources. Those increased contributions yielded an impressive result on Tuesday night, as the Lady Wolves bested Volunteer 74-53 on the road. West Ridge has been forced to reconfigure things after Fallon Taylor suffered a season-ending injury. Tonight, the Lady Wolves had three players score in double figures and got at least seven points from six individuals. The Lady Wolves controlled the boards, won the turnover battle, and shot well: 50% from the field and better than 70% from the line. âLosing Fallon is a key component, but weâve got other kids that can do a lot of good things, too,â West Ridge coach Kristi Walling said. âI think these kids are really rising to the occasion and Iâm super proud of them for stepping up.â West Ridge (10-5) didnât leave a whole lot of doubt. The Wolves scored 10 of the gameâs first 12 points and had a comfortable 21-8 lead after one quarter. The Lady Falcons (9-7) scratched back within one possession, 32-29, on a free throw by Emilee Mailleux with 12.7 seconds remaining in the half. West Ridge pushed its lead back to five and promptly slammed the door in the third period, outsourcing Volunteer 21-7 to take control for good. Three consecutive 3-pointers by Campbell Jones staked the Lady Wolves to a 50-35 lead midway through the quarter. âItâs not going to win many ballgames having inconsistent scoring like that,â Volunteer coach Caroline Laek said. West Ridge maintained the intensity, in part due to having a deep rotation. Walling regularly subbed in two or three players at a time. âThere were a couple of times I couldnât get kids subbed in and out quick enough,â Walling said. Carter Jones led West Ridge with 18 points. Campbell Jones added 13 points while Alexis Hood scored 10. Hood and Lilly Bates combined for five blocked shots. The Lady Falcons struggled badly with their shooting. Volunteer went 2-for-16 from 3-point range. Meanwhile, the West Ridge defensive pressure wreaked havoc, forcing 18 turnovers, including several while defending usually routine inbounds passes. âI felt like, not taking anything away from their press, but at times we just handed the ball to them,â Laek said. âI donât have an answer to that one.â Volunteer got Ava Jackson and Anna Hauck back in action but that was perhaps the main positive. Jackson finished with 10 points in her return to the lineup. Veda Barton paced the Lady Falcons with 13 points. âWeâve got to get ourselves back in shape. Weâve got to get ourselves able to press the whole game, like we were before the break,â Laek said.

Two days before Christmas. At noon. Volunteer fought through the late December lulls and topped Gate City 51-39 in the seventh-place contest in the 27th Doc Maples Holiday Hoops Tournament, played at Tennessee High. The Lady Falcons (9-6) also snapped a three-game losing streak. Volunteer coach Caroline Laek said she told her team the following before taking to the Viking Hall floor: âI went in the locker room and just explained to them, âwe can do one of two things. We can let these losses build like a cancer and let it spread and just spiral. Or we can come out here and redeem ourselves.â â Jacie Begley proved instrumental in Volunteer breaking out of its December funk. Gate City (0-6) led 8-4 midway through the first quarter, but Begley erased that deficit in a matter of seconds when she scored, stole the inbounds, and made a layup to tie the score. That sparked a 15-2 finish to the quarter by Volunteer, staking the Lady Falcons to a 19-10 lead they never would relinquish. Begley, who finished with 19 points, scored 13 in the opening period, including a 3-pointer at the buzzer. Gate City made a couple of runs, but each time Volunteer had an answer. When the Lady Blue Devils scored the first seven points of the second quarter, the Falcons responded by closing the half on an 11-1 run. Early in the fourth quarter, Gate City pulled back within one possession at 39-36, but its lead guard Jaydyn Carrico fouled out just seconds later. The Devils never recovered. âWhen she isnât on the floor, weâre going to struggle. Thatâs obvious,â Gate City coach Kelly Houseright said. And so the Lady Blue Devils turn the calendar from 2023 to 2024 still seeking their first win of the season. Itâs a sudden and sharp turnaround for a program that has won a state title and reached four state championship games on Houserightâs watch. She said this was, without question, both the most inexperienced team and biggest coaching challenge she has faced to date. âWeâve got a lot of learning to do,â Houseright said. âWeâre very inexperienced and donât understand the game of basketball right now. Weâve just got to look to get better as the year goes on.â Volunteer, meanwhile, just looks to get healthy during the holiday break. Ava Jackson and Anna Houck, two usual starters for the Lady Falcons, currently are sidelined by injuries. âI think, all things considered, Iâm pleased,â Laek said when asked about the state of her team at the unofficial midpoint of the season. âI think, when we get Ava back, we get Anna back, we get back in that rhythm we had created when we were on that five-game winning streak. I think it brings us out of this.â Veda Barton added 15 points for Volunteer. Carrico poured in a team-high 17 points for Gate City before fouling out.

So will teammate Andrea Flores, another Division I college prospect.Mains and Flores each made four 3-pointers as Catholic improved to 10-2 with a 63-35 defeat of Volunteer in a first round game on Thursday.âThey can shoot it,â said Mains, who beat Ray Allen, among others, in the shootout at the 1992 Arbyâs Classic.It was obvious early thereâd be no shootout between the Irish and Volunteer.After Veda Barton scored from the right block to get the Falcons within 14-8 with 1:22 left in the first quarter, Catholic responded with a 14-0 run. Mains ignited it with a 3-pointer assisted by Amaya Redd. Flores capped it with a three-point play in transition â via her steal and finish through contact with her left hand.Flores also beat the first quarter buzzer with a trey during the early knockout punch.âWeâve got some good players,â Travis Mains said. âWeâve got some crazy athleticism out there with Amaya and then Andreaâs length and Sidneyâs smarts and Carolineâs (Krueger) smarts. Weâve got a good team.âCatholic is adapting to life without its point guard, which quit the team after a Dec. 9 win against reigning state runner-up Ensworth. Apparently, Mains said, there werenât enough basketballs to go around.âWeâll figure it out,â Mains said. âWeâve got enough size. If we get it down the floor it doesnât matter. They can all play. And we can shoot.âFlores scored 18 points. (10-2). Redd, a junior forward, and Mains added 12 apiece. Redd wowed spectators with a power dribble-Euro Step move that produced a transition basket.Barton scored 14 points to lead Volunteer. Jacie Begley added 10.âBartonâs not bad,â Catholic coach Travis Mains said. âSheâs a good player. Sheâs got good size, shoots it well. Sheâs aggressive. And No. 11 (Begley) is not a bad player.âI can see where theyâve won eight games. I mean, they didnât quit.âBegley was snatching steals and scoring a contested lay-in long after the outcome was out of doubt.âTheyâre a great basketball team,â Volunteer coach Caroline Laek said. âWe knew that coming into this game. I just told my girls, especially there after halftime, âWeâre not gonna give up. Weâre not gonna lay down. Weâre gonna keep playing hard.

So we were kind of staying home with him and trying to make other guys kind of see things, and we were more disciplined in that aspect.âMcGonigle scored 12 points in the second half, including a three-point play near the left block that gave Boone a 35-32 lead with four minutes left in the third quarter.His baskets included a midrange floater, a steal and ensuing lay-in and a 3-pointer â assisted by Clay Rowland â that cut Volunteerâs early lead to 20-14.âI keep telling Tim all the time heâs capable of that,â Brown said.Senior post Henry Hamlin also flourished in the second half, getting 10 of his 12 points after intermission. Hamlin and McGonigle combined for 22 of Booneâs 33 in the second.âWe were overloading that zone a little bit and screening, and we knew we would get that if we would get that if we would just make the read,â Brown said. âI thought both of those guys did a really good job finding the gaps in there and we made the proper pass.âWhen you rely so much on the three like we do, weâve gotta get the ball inside. And when some of those shots start falling, then weâll start hitting some threes.âMcGonigle drove and passed to Hamlin for an interior basket that gave Boone a 49-42 lead with 4:11 left. Hamlin had another assisted interior basket from a McGonigle drive and one from Brayden Blankenshipâs crowd-pleasing pass.Hamlin also created second chance points for himself and teammates.âHeâs a physical presence,â Brown said. âAnd if he puts a body on guys, heâs strong. Thatâs what we need him to do and heâs capable of doing that.âBrown isnât crazy about non-conference road games after schoolâs let out for Christmas break. He figured it couldâve had a hand in Volunteer (2-13) jumping out to a 20-11 lead.Brown did put his players through a morning shoot-around at school just to maintain some semblance to their routine.âNon-conference, no school â I hate this time of year,â Brown said. âI really do, because you get out of that routine. And itâs tough to go on the road when youâre out of that routine. And I think that played a little bit of a role. We can bring âem in early (for a walk-through) all we want, but still youâre out of that routine.âGavin Pearce and Blankenship scored 12 and 10 points, respectively. Pierce hit three 3-pointers.Luke Armstrong scored 10 of his 12 points and Owen Tullock scored nine of his 13 while helping the Falcons build a 27-25 halftime lead.Owen Millerâs transition basket cut Booneâs lead to 47-42 with 4:38 to go, but Volunteer could muster but two points the rest of the way.âFor us, some of it is inexperience still, learning how to finish ballgames,â Volunteer coach Zac Crawford said. âAnd Brownâs got a good bunch. Theyâre figuring out the same things we are, how to finish ballgames. Thatâs what this time of year is all about.âBoone is off until it opens play in the Arbyâs Classic against Maryville on Dec. 27.

She scored back-to-back baskets, the second of which led to a three-point play, and then made a steal which led to a 3-pointer for Riddle.All the sudden, Volunteer (8-6) trailed 62-53 with 4:16 to go. It didnât get within a possession again.Boone coach Justin Humphries had an inspirational message for Bacon after Bartonâs basket from the left block had reduced Booneâs lead to one point early in the fourth period.âCoach may have given her a few words of encouragement after Barton scored that last field goal on the other end right before all that happened,â Humphries said. âI may have got in her ear a little bit. Then she did her thing and took over.âBacon drives with abandon, but has learned to pick her spots.âWeâve talked a lot about playing with that aggression and being assertive, but being under control,â Humphries said. âYou know, itâs easy when you play that hard and downhill to get a little out of control. Weâve really focused on that, talked about that, worked on that.âSheâs excited about going to the next level and weâve been trying to work on things to help her when she gets to Wingate. Sheâs picking it up for her team night now, and thatâs all you can ask for from a senior leader.âWalters did about all that could be asked of her when considering she was just getting over pneumonia.âSheâd been out with pneumonia the past week and a half,â Humphries said. âThis is her first day (game) back. So for her to play the way she did was big for us, obviously. She practiced for one day.âRiddle made four of Booneâs eight 3-pointers. The âBlazers were 22-for-23 at the foul line.Barton, Jacie Begley and Emilee Mailloux had playing time somewhat limited because of foul trouble.âFoul trouble definitely affected us tonight,â Volunteer coach Caroline Laek said.Barton scored 10 points in the opening 7 1/2 minutes. She concluded the sizzling start with a step-back 3-pointer to cut Booneâs advantage to 19-16 with 30 seconds left in the first quarter.âObviously, thatâs the focal point for them and we tried to take it away,â Humphries said. âSheâs so tough to guard. I donât think she missed but one shot in the whole second half or maybe even the game. It felt like it anyway.âSheâs just so physical. She gets to her spots. Sheâs a veteran. And she knows how to play.âBegley scored 13 points for Volunteer, which got 10 from Anna Houck.âWe came out flat in the first half and it cost us a 12-point deficit,â Laek said. âI felt like we came out in the second half and worked hard to cut into their lead. We just couldnât seem to get over that 4 point hump. I told the girls after the game that without the first half, this is a different ball game.âVolunteer has the unenviable task of opening in the Doc Maples Holiday Classic at Tennessee High on Thursday night against Knox Catholic.Boone will host Greeneville on Thursday.DANIEL BOONE (70) -- Jayden Riddle 4 6-6 18, Seymore 0 2-2 0, Dietz 1 0-0 3, Newton 1 0-0 2, Kyleigh Bacon 5 10-11 20, Jenkins 1 0-0 3, Steadman 0 2-2 2, Ke.

Both teams had to replace several key personnel. And, so far, both teams have experienced very different fortunes in the 2023-24 season.The Blue Devils continued their successful ways, hanging a 70-48 result on the Falconsâ home floor on Friday night.Unicoi (12-3) completed a non-conference sweep of the Falcons; the Devils beat Volunteer 70-45 in Erwin earlier this month. The sophomore tandem of Jackson Simmons and Kolby Jones led the way in this one. Simmons accumulated a game-high 26 points, while Jones scored 13. Mason Hensley, the only senior on the entire roster, poured in 19 points.âWeâre young. We lost three guys last year that scored 1,000 points, a couple of them [had] 1,500 points,â Unicoi coach Jordan Simmons said. âSo itâs been an adjustment for sure. The experience that Jackson and Kolby and Mason got last year has kind of been the catalyst for our entire program this year. The guys go in expecting to win. âWe lost a lot. Our teamâs completely different than it was last year. But for our guys, they just walk into the gym and expect to win and expect to compete. Thatâs just really a testament to those guys that graduated from last year but also the guys that are back from that team and the mindset that they bring to us everyday.âPerhaps that mentality fueled the way Unicoi started this game. The Blue Devils opened the game on a 12-0 run and Volunteer (2-12) essentially spent the rest of the night trying to catch up. Jackson Simmons racked up eight points during that pivotal early outburst. âI thought we played pretty well on defense on him and he scored 26,â Volunteer coach Zac Crawford said of Simmons with a slight shake of the head when perusing the scorebook. âHe knows how to get to his spot. He will find a way to get there.ââTo have him as a sophomore, with the experience he got last year, heâs really just taken his game up a notch,â coach Simmons said. âThat midrange game, when he gets to his spots, itâs just beautiful to watch. Kolbyâs taken a big jump. Heâs taken on a bigger role. Those two guys, their games complement each other well. Kolbyâs much more of a catch and shoot type guy. Jackson creates a lot for everybody.â Still leading by 10, 51-41, entering the final quarter, Unicoi closed the door on any possible rally by the homestanding Falcons with a 15-2 run to open the fourth period.Those two runs essentially decided this outcome.âWeâre learning,â Crawford said. âWeâre figuring things out. Weâre trying different things. We started with something new; obviously that didnât work, so we adjusted.âLucas Armstrong delivered a team-high 12 points in a reserve role for Volunteer. Griffin Head scored 10.âIt was a great start and a great end but all the stuff in the middle was a little sloppy and a little ugly,â coach Simmons said. âVolunteer played well tonight. Thatâs the best Iâve seen them play, on film or in person. I know theyâre missing some guys. They had guys step up and make shots and play hard and make plays. Hatâs off to them. Zacâs done a great job and I think theyâre going to have a great conference year.âLongtime cohorts in District 1-AA, then 1-AAA when TSSAA basketball expanded to four classifications, Volunteer and Unicoi now find themselves in different leagues. This could, however, potentially be a matchup that develops once the postseason enters regional play. -- Koda Cutlip 0 0-0 0, Kolby Jones 5 2-2 13, Mason Hensley 8 3-4 19, Jackson Simmons 11 2-2 26, Brady Simmons 0 0-0 0, Kaden Cutlip 1 0-0 3, Casey 0 0-0 0, Rodriguez 3 3-5 9, Peterson 0 0-0 0, Sellars 0 0-0 0, Peterson 0 0-0 0, Garland 0 0-0 0.

Games where you donât play your best, and still win, can teach invaluable lessons and help prepare a team for the rigors of the postseason.File Friday nightâs 60-55 victory against Unicoi County in that category for the Volunteer girlsâ basketball team. The Lady Falcons (9-4) fought through a somewhat discombobulated performance offensively, and withstood a very stern challenge from the Lady Devils (10-6), to post their fifth consecutive victory overall.âI think itâs games like this one and the battle we were in on Monday at Lakeway [a 77-75 Volunteer win] that prepare you for that postseason, for sure,â Lady Falcons coach Caroline Laek said.Even though Unicoi County and Volunteer now belong to different conferences in basketball, the hard-fought nature of this game gave it that postseason feel. The lead changed hands 18 times, with seven tied scores. The final deadlock came at 54-all inside the two-minute mark, after a drive to the basket by Unicoiâs Allie Lingerfelt. Emma Houck and Anna Houck stepped up late, combining for six points, two rebounds, and an assist down the stretch.âI was proud of our execution late and our ability to hang onto the basketball,â Laek said.For the game, the Houcks finished with 27 total points: 15 for Emma and 12 for Anna, who also compiled three assists and three steals. Working as a point forward for Volunteer for much of the night, Jacie Begley turned in a strong all-around effort. She finished with 17 points, 10 rebounds, three assists, and a pair of steals. The Houck sisters also crashed the offensive glass, helping Volunteer finish with 14 offensive boards. âAnd Iâd say they scored on the majority of them,â Unicoi coach Brandon Broyles said.Broyles and his staff, which includes former longtime Science Hill boys coach Ken Cutlip, brought a sound strategy into the game. Unicoi tried to extend offensive possessions while collapsing defensively on Falcons post Veda Barton every time she received a pass.Laek noted Unicoi had a similar plan in their Dec. 5 meeting, a 10-point Volunteer victory.âWe do rely so much on her and it messes with our continuity, if you will,â Laek said.Barton finished with six points, but that helped push her over the 1,000-point milestone for her career.âItâs a big thing for a kid like her,â Laek said. âSheâs so humble, she didnât even know it. She had no idea. It wasnât a concern of herâs. Iâm just proud of her.âLingerfelt led all scorers with 28 points for Unicoi. She shot better than 50% from the field, making five 3-pointers. Broyles noted Lingerfelt already has topped 30 points in a couple of games this season.âItâs a testament to the other kids for getting her open, and her getting in the gym and working hard,â Broyles said.Faith Bennett added 16 points for Unicoi.UNICOI COUNTY (10-6) -- Farnor 0 0-0 0, Rush 3 0-0 7, Jones 0 0-0 0, Allie Lingerfelt 11 101 28, Faith Bennett 4 7-8 16, Toney 0 2-2 2, Rogers 0 0-0 0, Vidrio 1 0-0 2.

Barton, Begley and Anna Houck each had six rebounds.âThatâs kind of something that's been a go-to, you know, in every game,â Volunteer coach Caroline Laek said, âthe fact that we've got some size on everybody.âThe Falcons improved to 7-4 on the season while Unicoi County fell to 6-5.âIt wasn't one of the prettiest things I've ever seen us put together,â Laek said. âBut you know, I was proud of them that even when Unicoi made their little runs â I was really proud of their composure and not letting the chaos and the environment let the momentum shift the other way.âAnna Houck scored eight points for Volunteer, which will visit Grainger on Friday.The Blue Devilsâ Allie Lingerfelt scored a game-high 24 points. She made all three of her teamâs 3-pointers.âShe's a great player, and that was that was kind of something we talked about,â Laek said. âWe were not gonna let her beat us. We want her to have to work for everything she gets.âRush scored nine points for Unicoi County. Faith Bennett had seven points and a team-high three assists.Unicoi County coach Brandon Broyles said Volunteerâs size and his squadâs inability to make open shots were too much to overcome.âBut I canât fault how hard our kids played,â Broyles said. âWe just couldnât get a shot to fall.

He might be at his best pulling up in the mid-range, where a handful of his baskets came from in this one.âItâs kind of that lost art they always talk about â that mid-range jumper,â Simmons said. âBut itâs kind of his specialty. I donât know if he missed one of the mid-range jumpers tonight. Thatâs just a shot that heâs always practiced and perfected.âVolunteer coach Zac Crawford was hardly surprised to see Simmons and Jones excel. They played well against his state tournament team last season as freshman.âI think the playing time they got last year leads to that maturity they show,â Crawford said. âThey both made just really good, tough shots. Thereâs nothing you could do about it. Nothing substitutes for shot-making.âKoda Cutlip scored nine points for the Blue Devils. Brady Simmons added eight points, including a crowd-pleasing baseline reverse lay-in.The Blue Devils took a 57-31 lead with 6:17 remaining when Jones found a trailing Simmons for a transition trey. The Falcons answered with a 14-4 run to get with 16 with more than 2 1/2 minutes remaining, but Simmonsâ put-back stopped the skid and sent fans for the exits with 2:02 remaining.âIâm still seeing red from that little stretch in the fourth quarter when we decided to stop playing,â Simmons said. âBut overall, itâs a 25-point win against a region team. Theyâre not in our conference anymore, but itâs a region team.âWe made some shots. The defensive energy was pretty good.âTucker McClain scored a team-high 12 points for Volunteer, which fell to 2-9 on the season.âTucker and Nolan are our seniors that weâre really leaning on to guide this young bunch into the next era,â Crawford said. âThey understand that there are going to be some growing pains. Weâre getting through it. I think by the end of the season youâll see the fruit come from it.âVolunteer will visit Grainger on Friday.Unicoi County will visit University High on Thursday. Like Volunteer, each of those teams advanced to the state tournament last season after splitting a pair on non-conference regular season games.âI think they are one of the two or three best teams in this area,â Simmons said. âI donât think thereâs any question about that. Theyâre experienced. Theyâve got a bunch of seniors, guys that have kind of been through the gauntlet last year getting to the state tournament (semifinals).âItâs gonna be tough.

Friend against friend.Or, in the case of the boysâ basketball version of the Battle of Hawkins County, cousin against cousin. Volunteer and Cherokeeâs rosters each include a member of the McLain family and both figured prominently in Fridayâs latest chapter of the basketball rivalry. Tucker McLain and Volunteer emerged victorious, with McLain pouring in a game-high 23 points as the Falcons tallied a 70-48 victory.McLain admitted that facing his cousin in the midst of taking on Volunteerâs biggest rival added more juice.âIt gives you more to play for, I guess,â he said.Cherokeeâs McLain, Colten, paced the Chiefs (1-4) in defeat with his 16-point performance.âIâve loved these last four years watching the McLain vs. McLain matchup with Volunteer and Cherokee: Tucker and Colten,â Volunteer coach Zach Crawford said. âItâs been fun.â Friday nightâs game was more fun for Volunteer (2-8) than Cherokee. The Falcons led by a 17-9 margin at the end of the first quarter, then held the Chiefs scoreless for the first 3:40 of the second period. âWeâve just got to do a better job of scoring,â Cherokee coach Trey Fields said. âI donât know if that comes down to me or what.âVolunteer led Cherokee 36-14 at the break but the Chiefs did not go away. Cherokee embarked on a 10-0 run to open the third quarter, but a 3-pointer by Owen Miller quelled the outburst. It also sparked a 9-0 run by Volunteer to widen the gap back to 20 points. The Falcons maintained a double-digit advantage the rest of the way.Crawford said he was âreally pleased with our defensive intensity tonight. Weâre getting better on that end of the court. Weâre getting better offensively.âThat makes the contributions of players like McLain, one of two seniors in the regular rotation, so important. McLain was particularly active in the transition game, tallying multiple buckets on the break or off of Cherokee turnovers.âItâs a lot of fun,â McLain said of scoring in transition. âItâll wear you out, but itâs a lot of fun.ââHeâs the senior leader and steps up in bigtime moments,â Crawford said. Owen Miller added 15 points off the bench while Cameron Cox finished with 11 for the Falcons. In addition to the 16 points from their McLain, the Chiefs got 12 points and 12 rebounds out of Elisha Jones.Fields pointed to that second quarter, and a foul discrepancy with Cherokee getting whistled 11 times to Volunteerâs four, as the difference.âYeah we were fouling them, donât get me wrong, but that changed the game,â Fields said. âAnd with the new rule, it definitely changed the game.âThis season has been a struggle to date but Volunteerâs coach wanted to give his squad a challenge, as the Falcons almost had to hit the reset button in terms of personnel after reaching the state tournament last season.âLike Iâve told them in the locker room, when it comes down to it, conference is what matters,â Crawford said. âWe set the schedule up early in the year to put them through a challenge to build for conference play and see what weâre really made of.âBoth varsity games on Friday night were played in front of a raucous atmosphere. Play in the boysâ game was spirited and scrappy at all times, and often sloppy.âWe still do so many things right but then do so many things wrong,â Crawford said. âWhen you have a young team like this, itâs going to take a little while.âThe end of the boysâ junior varsity game set the tone for a wild night, with Brennan Greene hitting a buzzer-beating shot to elevate the homestanding Falcons.CHEROKEE (1-4) -- Colten McLain 7 2-5 16, Ward 1 0-0 3, Elliott 0 0-0 0, Jeffers 1 2-4 5, Horner 0 1-2 1, Hayes 0 0-0 0, Elisha Jones 4 4-5 12, I.

It all led to a 12-point Viking run to start the game and ahead 14-7, Tennessee High blew it wide open with a 31-1 sequence to grab a 45-8 lead late in the second period.âHopefully now weâve got them convinced that we have to start with defense instead of offense,â said McMeans. âThatâs kind of our identity and thatâs how we are going to win games. So, they really got after in the press today.âSophomore Reed Millerâs double-double of 22 points and 12 rebounds along with five steals and three assists led the way for Tennessee High.âReed just needs minutes to figure things out,â noted McMeans. âBut he can shoot, and he can play inside, and he plays good defense and rebounds. Heâs going to be good,âAnother junior, point guard Colin Brown, pumped in 21 points, 16 in the first half. The crafty lefty also dished out five assists and used in springboarding quick vertical to effect four steals and many more deflections. With Brown at the helm, Tennessee High only committed three turnovers.âYou canât press that kid,â said McMeans of Brown. âYou are not going to press him, heâs going to get it up the floor and get us in something.âBrown is also adjusting to his new leadership role on the squad. âColin has got to become a leader to take his game to the next level and to take this team to the next level,â McMeans said. âHeâs figuring that out. He has started since he was a freshman, but heâs always had guys here that had been older that were the leaders. Now heâs got to be the leader.âZander Phillips provided 17 points for the Vikings, 13 of which came in the second-quarter blitz. Philips also handed out four assists, picked up two steals and two rebounds. âThatâs his best game of the season,â noted McMeans. âAnother three-year starter. He played within himself today and he knocked down shots.âMeanwhile, the Falcons had more turnovers than points and 13 of their 31 points came from freshman Griffin Head. A dozen of Headâs tally came in the final two quarters.

But scheduling easy wins isnât part of overhaul process, thus Tuesdayâs 54-45 conquest is the initial victory on the fifth try for the Falcons.âItâs a good win because you look at the schedule and in the next couple of weeks, you donât know when youâll get another one,â admitted Crawford. âWeâve scheduled it that way every year. I want to put them through the ringer the first half of the season getting them ready and I want to figure out who is not going to buckle under pressure, who is going to stick with me, and believe in what we are doing.âFreshman Griffin Head seems to fit the bill. Head is the younger brother of Blake, one of the department members of last yearâs crew.âHe (Head) has played a ton ball of ball and you can't replace playing AAU and travel stuff,\" noted Crawford. \"He is not afraid of big moments.âHis brother just graduating and Griffin being right behind and Blake teaching him has helped.âHead heated up in the second half, scoring 13 of his game-high 18 points in the final two periods. Owen Tullock came off the bench to drop 13 points.It wasnât the smoothest of close-outs for Volunteer which lead at one points 52-35 before a late burst by the Rangers got the final margin down to nine points.âThereâs a lot of learning that goes along with our new guys, especially how to close out a ballgame,â continued Crawford. âThatâs a film we are going to take back and watch a ton because there are a lot of teachable moments in there.âUnaka got 13 points from John Hardin, a dozen from Mason Wilson and ten more from Marcus Shomaker.

And fast.Enter Lofton Hayes.The sophomore fielded the Volunteer kickoff and skirted the sidelines for a 77-yard kickoff return with 10:18 to go to give Cherokee some much needed breathing room and a 28-13 lead.The Chiefs added a 14-yard hook-and-ladder play by quarterback Landon Jeffers to Jacob Brooks, who pitched it to Kalija Sexton who took it to the end zone for the final scoring as Cherokee defeated Volunteer 35-20 in a more-entertaining-than-expected Hawkins County Bowl in Mike Sivert Stadium at Big Red Valley.For Chiefs Head Coach Josh Hensley, a Volunteer graduate, it was a sweet victory over his alma mater.\"It's always good to get a Senior Night win,\" Hensley said. \"It feels even better when it's against our cross-county rivals. I'm proud of our effort. I'm proud of our entire community. We always felt the support coming from the stands.\" It looked to be a set up for a rout when Volunteer turned the ball over on a mis-snapped punt attempt and Cherokee recovered on the Falcon 22. The Chiefs went on a nine-play, 22-yard drive with Sexton denting the end zone for the first of three touchdowns with 7:44 left in the first quarter and a 7-0 lead.After Cherokee stopped the Falcons' six-play drive on downs, the Chiefs went on another nine-play drive, this one for 61 yards with Sexton adding a 14-yard touchdown score and a 14-0 lead.Not to be outdone, the Falcons came back with Keelin Releford. The running back pounded the rock for 64 yards on the drive, but it was former Cherokee Chief Aiden Parson who scored from 1-yard out with 6:29 left to cut the lead in half, 14-7.\"They gave us a fit at times,\" Hensley said. \"They were calling strength to take Sexton away. They were heavy on him. He never blinked, though. He stayed true to the game plan and I'm proud of him for it.\"Hensley said that the Chiefs left a lot of points on the field in the first half as they only led 14-7 at halftime.\"We had back-to-back dropped touchdown passes late in the second quarter,\" Hensley said. \"We've got to clean those things up. We're still a really young football team and things like that happen. I was really pleased with the way they overcame that.\"On the hook and ladder play, Hensley said that Brooks and Sexton had been working on it in practice.\"We kept trying to find a good formation to get it and to make sure that nobody was sitting at home,\" Hensley said. \"They had rolled their corner out and we saw an opportunity.\"When Cherokee's defense needed a stop, the team delivered, stopping the Falcons two times on four-down possessions.On Hayes' 77-yard kickoff return in the fourth quarter, Cherokee's first since 2016, Hensley was very pleased.\"It was a wild test because we took two guys out and was trying to tell them what the scheme was,\" Hensley said. \"To be honest, I don't know if they ran what we were trying to run. He had a seam a little bit, back-cut a little bit, found the rail. I knew if he could hit that last gear, and get by Releford, he was going to take it.\" For Volunteer, Releford kept the Falcons in contention with 122 yards rushing and a touchdown.\"He is a really good running back, one that we respect,\" Hensley said. \"He made a lot of plays and we were happy that we were able to corral him as well as we did. You know every single play they're going to run, you're going to get their best effort. Coach Jesse McMillan and his staff does a really good job there. He has a really young football team as well. I think this game is going to be a good game for the next few years.\"Parson scored the Falcons' final touchdown in garbage time with 4-yard pass from freshman quarterback Jameson Mowell. Mowell was 11-18 for 83 yards. Both teams close out their seasons next Friday, Volunteer at Grainger High and Cherokee at Union County. The Chiefs have a chance to win its 200th game in program history at Maynardville.\"It's going to put a lot at stake,\" Hensley said. \"We're really excited about that opportunity to go there to play a team I'm not very familiar with. We want to finish this season on a really strong note.\" 1 2 3 4 FINAL Volunteer 0 7 0 13 20 Cherokee 7 7 7 14 35 First Quarter(7:44) CHEROKEE -- Kalija Sexton 1 run (Jon Good kick)Second Quarter(11:46) CHEROKEE -- Kalija Sexton 14 run (Jon Good kick)(6:29) VOLUNTEER -- Aiden Parson 1 run (Jackson McLain kick)Third Quarter(0:20.7) CHEROKEE -- Landon Jeffers 12 run (Jon Good kick)Fourth Quarter(10:42) VOLUNTEER -- Keelan Releford 8 run (kick failed)(10;18) CHEROKEE -- Lofton Hayes 77-yard kickoff return (Jon Good kick)(4:03) CHEROKEE -- Kalija Sexton 14 pitch from Jacob Brooks via Jeffers (Jon Good kick)(2:41) VOLUNTEER -- Aiden Parson 4 yard pass from Jameson Mowell (Jackson McLain kick) Volunteer Cherokee First Downs 12 12 Rushing Yards 164 11 Passes Comp-Att-Int 11-18-0 14-23-1 Passing Yards 83 106 Total Offense 3247 219 Fumbles-Lost 1-1 1-1 Penalties-Yards 8-80 6-50 Punts-Average 1-26 1-10.0\n\nComplete Story\n\nVolunteer, Cherokee Both Looking to Salvage Tough Seasons in Hawkins County Bowl\n\nVolunteerâs football team desperately needs a positive result, and this Friday night would be a fine time to make it happen. The Falcons (0-8, 0-4) travel to face Cherokee (2-6, 1-4) in the latest chapter of the rivalry that has become known as the Hawkins County Bowl.Kickoff is set for 7 p.m.Both teams already are eliminated from playoff contention in Region 1-4A, so this game is about pride and bragging rights. Thereâs plenty of both to go around whenever these two schools meet, in any sport. The Falcons and Chiefs already play in whatâs arguably the toughest football region on at least this end of the state, having to compete for playoff position with a group of teams that includes perennial state powers Greeneville and Elizabethton. Itâs been an especially challenging season for winless Volunteer. The Falcons have lost all their games by 20 or more points The Falcons are averaging 8.13 points per game with three shutouts.âYou want any win at this point,â Falcons coach Jesse McMillan said in response to questions sent by DM on Tiwitter. âI donât approach this any differently in terms of how our staff prepares than any other game. But yes, Iâd enjoy seeing our kids happy after a game.âCherokee pulled off a 19-18 victory last year in Church Hill, snapping a two-game losing streak to Volunteer in this series. That was also the only victory the Chiefs tallied last season.âIt was a great way for us to end the season,â Chiefs coach Josh Hensley said. âBeating your rival is always a top priority and it was a blessing that we were able to get that done.ââNot much has been said about that other than dumb penalties cost us dearly because we let emotions get the best of us,â McMillan said. Expect the Chiefs to bring everything in their arsenal. Cherokee also should be well-rested, coming into this game off its bye week. Kalija Sexton is the Chiefsâ main weapon in the ground game, entering this contest 123 yards shy of 1,000 for the season. Sophomore Landon Jeffers has hit quadruple digits in passing yardage for a second consecutive season. On defense, keep an eye on Andres Moncier, who Hensley identified as the team leader and McMillan described as âa handful at defensive end.âOffensively, they have been putting up some points,â McMillan said. âSexton runs it well, Jeffers distributes the ball to their receivers accurately. We canât let them run it and then have him raise up and throw when they want to.âFreshman Jameson Mowell remains at QB for Volunteer. Heâs thrown for 249 yards and a touchdown through eight games. Keelin Releford leads the Falcon rushing attack in both yards (517) and touchdowns (5). Defensively, freshman linebacker Owen Fleenor has been a bright spot. Heâs leading the team in tackles with 74 total stops.âOwen has played well for us,â McMillan said, adding that on offense, âJacoby Hyatt has battled at right tackle for us as a freshman. Heâs a kid that works at and wants to be good.âMcMillan believes it will take sound football for Volunteer to win this one, especially considering the rainy forecast.âDo what youâre supposed to do and donât do someone elseâs job,â he said. âDefensively, weâve got to tackle and eliminate big plays. Both sides we canât have foolish or selfish penalties. Weâve got to play really well to have a chance.âThis game just hits differently for both school communities. Hensley provided some details on the mood and atmosphere at Cherokee heading into this matchup.âThe energy is very high!â he said. âDonât have to check our pulse at practice during the week. The student body and community always show up for our guys and we hope to put a good product on the field for them.\"\n\nComplete Story\n\nMVP Barton Leads Lady Falcons to First Region Volleyball Title in Quarter Century\n\nVeda Barton piled up the kills and libero Chloe Redwine kept the kills from piling up while helping lead Volunteer past host Greeneville for a Region 1-AA volleyball championship on Tuesday.Volunteerâs 25-23, 17-25, 25-19, 25-19 victory came after defeating Elizabethton 25-18, 25-21, 25-19 in Tuesdayâs second semifinal. Greeneville defeated Gibbs 23-25, 25-19, 25-15, 25-21 in the opening semifinal.Volunteer will host Seymour on Thursday in a sectional matchup. Greeneville will visit Anderson County for the second straight season to try and secure a state tournament berth.Greeneville took an 18-17 lead in the fourth game, but Barton ignited a 4-0 spurt with a kill, and added two more after the Greene Devils had gotten within 21-19 to essentially douse their hopes.Barton was named the tournament MVP after helping Volunteer win its first region title since whatâs believed to be the turn of the century.âIt feels amazing to be here,â Barton said. âIâm just so proud of the girls. I could not be more proud of how theyâve played. They have lifted me up in a way that I canât even explain. It feels like â I mean thereâs just so much more to come, where Iâm excited, scared, nervous, but also just happy to be here.âThe Falcons and Greeneville were tied 14 times in the first game. A Greene Devilsâ kill attempt went long to give the Falcons a 23-22 lead and Barton followed with a kill that rolled along the tape before falling on the other side of the net for a 24-22 lead. Aliah Lasterâs kill ended it after Kyla Jobe had gotten Greeneville within 24-23.âAfter playing that first game,â Barton said, âit was like, âOh my gosh, this might go five sets. Mentally prepare yourself for whatâs going to happen.â After the second set I was like, âOh, my gosh, we could be here all night.â But after we put away that third set, I knew we were going to come out in that fourth set and we were going to put it away and we were gonna dig deep.âRedwine and teammate Lily Christian also made the all-tournament team. Falcons coach Nora Barton said Redwineâs performance this season has been all the more impressive when considering she missed essentially all of her sophomore season in 2022 after dislocating her shoulder in the summer of â22 in AAU.âSheâs really great on the back row,â Nora Barton said. âSheâs worked really hard on reading the hitter, moving appropriately and making sure sheâs not set up right behind the block.âVeda Barton also commended the play of Redwine.âChloe has been such a vital part to our team,â Veda Barton said. âWe love her to death. If I donât think sheâs going to get to a ball for some reason, she has it up in the air and weâre scrambling to put it over the net.âVeda Barton, of course, is the exclamation point on most of the Falconsâ rallies.âSheâs really the main reason here,â Redwine said.Volunteer also had a force at the net in Adah Snodgrass. It took a team effort to finish off the Greene Devils.âThat Greeneville team plays so hard,â Nora Barton said. âShew, that was a tough one.âGreeneville coach Sara Aiken said Barton and Redwine seemed to constantly make life difficult.âThe libero kept so much alive from our offense, so many touches on the ball,â Aiken said. âAnd you just canât give teams with an offensive weapon like No. 12 (Barton) that many chances. Youâve gotta find ways to put the ball down on their side of the court. But that libero was all over the place. I thought they were strong defensively and offensively.âGreenevilleâs Bella Devoti and Lanna Click made the all-tournament team.âIt was very competitive,â Aiken said. âOur girls learned a lot. â¦ Iâm proud of the girls, overall. I canât wait to compete against Anderson County.âGibbsâ Ella Brannan and Elizabethtonâs Gracie Kirsch also made the all-tournament team. Kirsch had 11 kills and Crisalyn Elliott tallied three blocks for the Cyclones.Kirsch and Elliott are part of a senior class that includes Bailey Vanhuss, Marley Lewis and Karie Merritt.âIâve seen substantial growth in their leadership abilities,â Elizabethton first-year coach Carley Williams said. âThe growth â not every program has that. We are a totally different team than we were in August.âTheir attitudes on the court and in their volleyball skills have matured. And I think thatâs all you can ask for as a coach. Obviously, it wasnât what we wanted, but if we look at where we started versus now, I think thatâs the biggest win we could ever have as a program. â¦ Itâs not so much about themselves any more, itâs about the team.âNora Barton is eager to experience the home atmosphere of a sectional match.âI think it will be great,â Nora Barton said. âOur crowd is just amazing â whatâs been coming and supporting us. Theyâre gonna show up, I just know. And if we can get even more people, I really do think thatâll be helpful.âNothing is known about Seymour.âWeâll just take it a game at a time and figure out what tweaks we need to make â and do it,â Nora Barton said. âIâm just so proud of âem. Theyâre really coming together as a team.â\n\nComplete Story\n\nClaiborne Denies Volunteer Bid For First Regional Appearance\n\nThe Volunteer girlsâ soccer teamâs bid to reach a regional tournament for the first time ever fell short.Claiborne ended the Falconsâ season on Tuesday in the semifinals of the District 2-AA tournament, scoring a 3-2 victory.Down 1-0 at the break, the Bulldogs (8-6-1) tallied all three of their goals in the second half. Goals by lead forward Emma Hoskins in the 44th and 50th minutes sandwiched a successful penalty kick by Riley Kiefer in the 47th. With that, Claiborne advances to face Greeneville for the District 2 title in Greeneville on Thursday. The top-seeded Greene Devils beat Grainger 9-0 in the other district semifinal.Both coaches concurred that Volunteer (6-9-0) controlled the first half. The Falcons broke through in the 36th minute, when Courtney Bellamy tallied off the assist from Gabriella Ritz.âVolunteer did a really good job in the first half,â Claiborne coach Jeff Sorke said. âThey were much more intense than they were. They were beating us to a lot of the 50/50 balls and they were playing very physical. That was one of the things we wanted to fix at halftime: not so much play in space but finding their players and being just as physical as them. Hanging onto the balla little bit more, making a few more passes before we attempted our through ball or a ball over the top or crosses from the wide areas. They did one heck of a job with that.âComing out of the break, Claiborne wasted little time leveling the match. Hoskins went on a long run and ripped a shot into the Volunteer net.Three minutes later, the Bulldogs got a penalty kick when Volunteer committed a handball inside the box. Kiefer delivered and Claiborne found itself with the lead.In the 50th minute, Hoskins added what was an insurance goal at the time but proved to be the game winner. Volunteer narrowed the gap to a single goal, after Kendall Stapleton tallied in the 76th minute.The Falcons tried furiously to get into position to tie the score and force extra time, but time ran out on the match and Volunteerâs season.Falcons coach Jamey Shelton thinks the numbers caught up to his squad. Volunteer played the match with only 12 healthy players. The rest of the roster was out due to injury or being out of town. Hawkins County is on fall break this week.âOur girls were getting tired. I think in the end thatâs what got us,â Shelton said. âIf we could have come out and done it for another 40 minutes straight, itâd have been awesome. Sometimes your body wonât let you go that far,âShelton reflected on Volunteerâs accomplishments in his second season leading the program.âThe girls seemed more dedicated,â Shelton said. âWe had built more of a united front this year, coming back in. We knew what to expect, coaches to players and players to coaches. We really pulled together.â\n\nComplete Story\n\nUnicoi Sell(ar)s Out For Win Over Volunteer\n\nWhen Drew Rice and his staff sat down to analyze the film from Unicoi Countyâs shutout loss to Gatlinburg-Pittman, in the midst of the Blue Devilsâ worst performance of the season, Garrett Sellars stood out.âWe realized we needed to get him touches and get him involved in the offense,â Rice said.Sellars got those touches, and converted those touches into touchdowns, on Friday night in a 41-14 victory over Volunteer at Gentry Stadium.Sellars made a game-high five catches for 80 yards, including a 39-yard touchdown reception. He also scored on a 65-yard punt return. Sellarsâ night included a kickoff return for an apparent TD, but a holding penalty negated the big special-teams play.Unicoi (4-3) dominated the first half, going into the locker room with an insurmountable 41-7 advantage. The Blue Devils racked up 293 yards of total offense, while holding Volunteer to 129 yards and one offensive touchdown.Unicoi benefited from the returns of running back Bransan Salts and back/receiver Chris Chavez from injuries, and also shook up the offensive line. Specifically, Jay Snyder shifted from tight end to right tackle and experienced a number swap â from No. 4 to No. 51.âWe put him at right tackle and hoped it would give us a spark offensively,â Rice said. âWe havenât run a lot of tight end sets this year because of the guys weâve got at receiver, trying to spread people out a little bit.âSpreading it out yielded Sellars several opportunities in the passing game, none more notable that his 39-yard touchdown. Kolby Jones aired out a ball to an open Sellars as he streaked down the sideline. Sellars grabbed it, juggled it, then maintained control as he crossed into the end zone.Jones completed 10 of the 14 passes he threw for 138 yards with the score. He started the game with six consecutive completions.âHe keeps getting better every week,â said Rice, who is just excited about the progression of Jones and Sellars â a sophomore and a junior, respectively â as they blossom and build chemistry in the pass game.Sellars was as quick to share the credit as he is with the ball in his hands.âNone of itâs possible without my teammates,â he said.Two of Sellarsâ teammates made noteworthy returns at full strength. Salts and Chavez were both 100% for the first time since Unicoi faced Happy Valley in the second week of the season.Salts finished with a team-high 68 yards rushing, including a 4-yard touchdown run that capped Unicoiâs first possession and initiated scoring for the Devils. Chavez caught two passes for 34 yards and made a pair of short runs for touchdowns.âIt felt very good to see the team bounce back like that,â Chavez said. âIt definitely feels good to be back and play with the team.âAfter Chavezâs first touchdown, which staked Unicoi to a 20-0 lead, Volunteer (0-7) made its bid to reverse momentum when Aden Parson returned the ensuing kickoff 80 yards for a touchdown.Sellars responded with his kickoff return to the house, which was called back for the hold. He made up for it later in the second period, taking that punt back for a score.âThey say, if you focus on the obstacles, thatâs all youâre going to see. In my mind, I say, you focus on the path because then all you see is the path,â Sellars said. âThatâs just what I think about sometimes. When you see the path, itâs there.âBrady Simmons, also a standout on defense for Unicoi, scored on a short run in the final minute of the second quarter. That also closed scoring for the Blue Devils, who substituted liberally and dialed back the tempo of their offense in the second half with the outcome well in hand.Volunteerâs lead back, Keelin Releford, ripped off a 55-yard touchdown run on the first play of the fourth quarter.The Falcons ran for 40 yards as a team, a total affected greatly by a 26-yard loss on a high punt snap. Unicoiâs defensive front had a significant physical advantage, repeatedly pushing back the Volunteer offensive line or forcing the pocket to collapse.âThey had a good plan there with what weâre trying to do the last few games. I donât think it was anything that we hadnât necessarily seen,â Volunteer coach Jesse McMillan said. âThey were bringing backers and things of that nature and we didnât do a good job of picking that up, which is something we worked on all week and talked about. Itâs not like they disguise it. They put them up there and we just didnât do a real good job of that.âUnicoiâs starting line consisted of Chavez and Snyder at the ends, with Austin Fagan and Austim Osborne manning the interior spots.Volunteer made it to the Unicoi 24 on its first series of the game, but the drive stalled and the Falcons turned over the ball on downs.Unicoi responded with its first scoring drive capped by Saltsâ score and ran away with the game.âIf we can get it in on that first drive, maybe that changes some things,â McMillan said. âWe didnât. We also didnât do a good job of tackling their backs tonight and they big-played us in the pass game a couple of times. Itâs kind of the same story.âReleford finished with 67 net yards on the ground for Volunteer.The lopsided score yielded opportunities down the stretch for two of Unicoiâs young backs: sophomore Shawn Menkowitz and freshman Blaze Rice. They finished with 36 and 18 yards rushing, respectively.It doesnât get any easier for the Falcons, who play at Elizabethton next week. Unicoi County is also on the road, headed to Claiborne. 1 2 3 4 FINAL Volunteer 0 7 0 7 14 Unicoi County 14 27 0 0 41 First Quarter(8:00) UNICOI COUNTY -- Branson Salts 4 run (Jose Lopez kick); 7-76, 2:40, 0-7(5:25) UNICOI COUNTY -- Garrett Sellars 39 pass from Kolby Jones (Jose Lopez kick); 5-65, 1:27, 0-14Second Quarter(11:08) UNICOI COUNTY -- Chris Chavez 3 run (kick failed); 6-13, 2:58; 0-20(10:53) VOLUNTEER -- Aden Parson 80 kickoff return (Jackson McLain kick); 7-20(6:49) UNICOI COUNTY -- Chris Chavez 6 run (Jose Lopez kick); 3-60, 1:15, 7-27(4:18) UNICOI COUNTY -- Garrett Sellars 65 punt return (Jose Lopez kick); 7-34(0:37) UNICOI COUNTY -- Brady Simmons 2 run (Jose Lopez kick); 7-59, 2:36, 7-41Fourth Quarter(11:48) VOLUNTEER -- Keelin Releford 55 run (Jackson McLain kick); 1-55, 0:12, 14-41 Volunteer Unicoi County First Downs 5 11 Rushing Att-Yards 17-40 26-157 Passes Comp-Att-Int 6-17-1 11-16-0 Passing Yards 89 136 Total Offense 129 293 Fumbles-Lost 1-0 0-0 Penalties-Yards 0-0 6-47 Punts-Average 4-29.5 4-24.3\n\nComplete Story\n\nSomething Must Give When Unicoi Hosts Volunteer\n\nUnicoi County is coming off its most lopsided game of the season. Volunteer has endured nothing but tough defeats thus far in the 2023 campaign. Something has to give on Friday night, as the Blue Devils (3-3) host the Falcons (0-6). Kickoff is set for 7:30 p.m.Volunteer lost 38-18 at Crockett, and has dripped each of its six games in 2023 by 20 or more points. The Falcons also will finish the season with nothing but road games; this marks the second of five straight away from home, on a 2023 docket that included only four home games.Interviewed over Twitter DMs, Volunteer coach Jesse McMillan was asked about his assessment of his team with six games in the books.âI think if you are able to evaluate it, objectively, we have improved considerably from where we started at back in the spring,â McMillan said. âAnd I believe that weâve gotten better every week for the most part. But, people are going to look at the record, and that is all they will see.âAfter the Crockett game, McMillan lamented some of the unsportsmanlike penalties against his team.âOur kids know there are a couple of things that are non-negotiable so those are effort, stupid penalties, and really bad mental busts,â McMillan said. âIâve said it every pregame speech for six games and I will say the last four, just relax and have fun. I think weâve done that at times, but too many instances of that not happening. But when it goes bad, we try to stay as positive as possible.âVolunteer endured several lower-body injuries against Crockett and one of those who went down, Caden Lafollette, is not expected to be available against Unicoi. Prior to his injury, LaFollette ran for 95 yards on just four carries. For the season, Lafollette ranks second on the team in rushing with 207 yards on 55 carries.Unicoi coach Drew Rice expects a tough fight from the Falcons.âI know Coach McMillan does just a phenomenal job and I think weâre going to have our hands full,â Rice said in a telephone interview with TriCitiesSports.âTheyâve got our respect, got our attention. We feel like weâve had a good week of prep so far. They do a number of different things: offensively, they run lots of formations. Thatâs been the focus this week. We plan to have a dogfight in our hands.âKeelin Releford leads the Falcons in rushing, with 279 yards on 63 carries. Releford ran for nearly half of that total, 136 yards, against Crockett.âKeelin ran it as hard as he has all year,â McMillan said. âNick Buzzo played pretty well up front. Defensively, Grant Winegar and CJ Fraysier played hard, as always. Isaiah Peters had to play a bunch for us up front with the injuries and I thought he did a good job.âMcMillan also praised the contributions of freshman Owen Fleenor, whose play at linebacker has been a bright point throughout this season.Unicoi enters this matchup coming off a 46-0 drubbing at the hands of Gatlinburg-Pittman, a program with multiple Division I prospects.âWhat I didnât like about last Friday night, I donât feel like we battled for four quarters,â Rice said. âThat part was a little discouraging, and I think that paired with this stretch of the season we got coming up, ultimately, these next four games will determine what kind of year we have. Truly.âUnicoiâs remaining docket includes an Oct. 13 road game at Claiborne, followed by the Oct. 20 home finale against Chuckey-Doak and an Oct. 26 trip to Johnson County.âIt could go one of two ways,â Rice said. âI think weâre very capable. You look at our three wins and I think at times we can be a really good football team. At other times weâve struggled a little bit. Weâre going to have to just get it nailed down here and play the type of football we know we can play here in October.âKolby Jones appears to have solidified himself as Unicoiâs starting quarterback. The sophomore has accumulated 258 yards passing (29 of 51) and 115 rushing yards with six touchdownsâthree in the air and three on the ground.âHeâs doing great,â Rice said. âI feel like, in all facets of the game, we struggled Friday night. I thought the first half against West Greene [a 42-8 Unicoi victory on Sept. 15] was just phenomenal. Running the offense, making plays and just doing what we asked him to do. He really continues to improve and weâre just super excited about him.âJones now has a full complement of skill players around him, or as full as itâs going to get, with the return of running back Bransan Salts (41 carries, 146 yards, 3 TD) and receiver Chris Chavez (10 catches, 93 yards) from injuries. âThose two guys are a huge part of our offense,â Rice said. âWeâve been without them for, it seems like forever now, but in reality itâs been about a month. Weâre definitely a better team when those guys are out there and rolling.âMcMillan had nothing but good things to say about the Blue Devils, or their coach.âFirst off, Drew is as good a guy as youâre going to meet in this business. Just a great guy and someone I keep in touch with and think he has done a really good job there,â McMillan said. âHeâs established an identity that they are going to be physical on both sides and compete. Theyâve got some athletes at the skill positions. Some of those guys have been banged up, and they are getting them back. Salts is faster than anybody weâve got, [Koda] Cutlip can hurt you and theyâve got other guys as well. [Brady] Simmons runs the ball well and is tough inside on defense. Jones is a very good athlete at QB. Those kinds of things worry you with their athleticism. Then theyâre big and physical up front, so we have to match that and tackle well. Defensively, theyâre as multiple out of a four-down front as anyone I can remember.âBoth teams are seeking a greater sense of consistency.âWe canât have the turnovers weâve been having. Weâve put our defense in bad spots with those all year,â McMillan said. âDefensively, eliminate big plays. Weâve played hard all year for the most part. Weâve had a bunch of guys show a lot of courage and character when things havenât gone our way. I donât feel like weâve quit in any game.âAs for Unicoi â¦âJust be consistent,â Rice said. âThat is what weâre looking for. When weâve played at our best this year, thatâs been the case.âThis is also Apple Festival weekend in Erwin, so those traveling to the game from out of town should allow extra drive time. School officials advise taking Exit 40 off Interstate 26 to avoid the bulk of festival traffic.This is the seventh all-time meeting between Volunteer and Unicoi. The Falcons have a 6-1 record against the Blue Devils, with Unicoiâs lone victory coming by a 27-6 margin in 1996. They last met in 2019, a 40-28 Volunteer win.\n\nComplete Story\n\nLady Falcons Get Senior Night Clean Sheet of Cherokee\n\nVolunteerâs girls soccer team doesnât have the biggest senior class, but those four seniors have the Falcons positioned to make possible program history next week.First things first, as Volunteer honored those four seniors at halftime of Tuesdayâs match in Church Hill, an 8-0 rout of Cherokee in District 2-AA play.Those four seniors are Destiny Salyer, Gabriella Ritz, Kourtney Bradshaw, and Elana Horne. All four ended up on the stat sheet by the end of the night for the Falcons (6-8, 2-2). Horne, who started the game in goal, also spent a high percentage of the match out on the field. She finished with a goal and a pair of assists. That said, Horne didnât hesitate when asked if she preferred playing in the field or between the pipes.âGoal, 100%,â she said, quipping, âThe easy answer is, itâs a lot less running. Saving a goal is just as important as scoring, though.âHorne was just as pleased at her exploits as that of Hallie Higgins, who finished the shutout over Cherokee (0-10, 0-4).Salyer had a goal and delivered the assist on Horneâs goal. Bradshaw provided the assist on Volunteerâs first, and game-winning goal, to Autumn Perri in the sixth minute.âWe practice hard and have a strong team,â Bradshaw said. âThis year, we brought in some strong upcoming players. Weâve had a lot better team bonding also.âRitz had an assist on Courtney Bellamyâs goal in the 26th minute. She also had two apparent goals that were waved off, one of which bounced off the crossbar of the football goalpost â not the crossbar of the soccer goal â and into the net. Ritz is the granddaughter of Mike Ritz, the former baseball coach at Dobyns-Bennett and Sullivan North who closed his career as the winningest coach in state history. When discussing her near-miss off the crossbar, the younger Ritz showed sheâd inherited her grandfatherâs gift for a joke.âI was a little upset but thought, maybe Iâm just meant to be on the football team,â Ritz said.This is shaping up as a potentially special season for Volunteer. The Falcons have the second seed for the District 2-AA tournament, prevailing in a three-way tiebreaker with Claiborne and Grainger thanks to goal differential. âIâm really proud of the team and Iâm just so proud of everyone,â said Ritz, who missed all of last season with a knee injury.A win in Tuesdayâs district semifinals would give Volunteer something the program has never achieved, by all accounts: a region tournament berth.âI think itâd mean a lot to us,â Horne said of the prospect of reaching regional play, âbecause weâve had a hard couple of seasons and it would show something to the people coming up in this program.âKendall Stapleton had two goals for Volunteer, both in the first half. Raya Kochemba provided a brace of goals of her own, both coming in the final 10 minutes.\n\nComplete Story\n\nLady Falcons Win Five-Set Thriller at Gate City; Bays Joins 1000-1000 Club\n\nAnother Monday marquee matchup played out at Gate City High School with visiting Volunteer taking a 25-21, 18-25, 25-21, 21-25, 15-8 five-set thriller over the Lady Blue Devils.The back-and-forth affair was spirited throughout, but especially in the hard-fought fourth set. Likely players of the year in their respective conferences, Volunteerâs Veda Barton and Gate Cityâs Makayla Bays, also went blow-for-blow in several sequences.Both notched double-doubles on the night with Barton going for 21 kills, 14 digs, two blocks and two aces and Bays finishing with 27 kills and 17 digs, including the 1000th of her career.âWe might have slowed down a couple of Makaylaâs balls, but sheâs going to get hers,â said Volunteer coach Nora Barton. âSheâs an amazing player. I wish I could fly through the air like her.âBaysâ milestone but her in rare air in the sheâs long surpassed 1,000 career kills as well.âSuch a nice accomplishment for her. And for her team,â said Gate City coach Amy Reed. âObviously sheâs not going to get that by herself. It takes a team working together.âWith Bays and Barton trading kills, the fifth set was tied three times early before the Lady Falcons broke away from a 5-5 deadlock to a 10-6 lead.Three of Volunteerâs first nine points in the deciding frame came on Lady Blue Devil service errors.âThat killed us,â noted Reed. âAt the point the score was 9-6. That could have been the other way for us if weâd gotten our serves in play.âAfter Gate City momentarily stymied the momentum, Volunteerâs Ada Snodgrass delivered a kill in the middle for an 11-7 cushion, finishing the evening with nine kills, four aces and three blocks.âVolleyball is such a mental game,â said Barton. âItâs just the grit and the not give up about thatâs different about them. They keep pushing and pushing and when one person makes a mistake, someone else comes by and picks them up. And thatâs what itâs all about. Thatâs a life lesson right there.âCassidy ended the match with her fourth kill and sixth ace of the night to go with 13 digs.âThose two (Snodgrass and Cassidy) have been key for us all year,â continued Barton. âJaycee has had some great games. Adah is becoming more and more consistent in the middle. Sheâs becoming a go-to. You see that with our setters and their trust in the hitters. We have so many options.âThe Lady Falcons led throughout the first frame and skipped to a 6-1 lead in the second before the Lady Blue Devils and found their footing. With Bays rotated to the front, Gate City rolled off a 14-1 spurt to take control and even the match.Jaycee Cassidyâs ace gave Volunteer at 16-10 edge in the third, but a Bays kills clipped the advantage to 18-16. Back came Barton with a hammer and setter Lily Christian found an open hole as the Lady Falcons took a set lead again. Christian handed out 32 assists and produced six kills of her own in the win.âLily has great hands and sheâs making better decisions this year,â Barton said. âAnd her knowing who is on and who is off and who to go to. Feed the beast when you can, but make sure you spread it around when everybody is contributing.âNeither team lead by more than two in the fourth set until Gate City answered a Snodgrass block with three straight for the four-point win to force the fifth.âVolunteer fought hard and they wanted it,â noted Reed. âThey didnât give up and fought back. We had our moments. It was a good match.âThe Lady Falcons were also playing without libero Chloe Redwine. Mattie Crowder donned the libero jersey in her spot and came up with 26 digs and added three aces. Kayla Capson also stepped in a defensive specialist role to bring up 13 digs.âThat was some huge shoes to fill,â noted Barton. âI could tell that Mattie was nervous, but she got the job done. She was all over the back. There were several out of position, but they somehow brought it together. They communicate on the court. They know where their weaknesses are on the court and where each otherâs weaknesses are and they talk about it and tell each other where they are going and they are so good know that about each other.âWe knew we werenât going to shut down Bays, but if we needed to contain the others and eliminate mistakes. Thatâs the key in this game, to make less mistakes than the other team.âPeyton Taylor added nine kills for Gate City with Georgia Griffis dishing out 26 assists and Sophie Webb 17 assists. Rylee Blevins came up with 15 digs.Gate City moves to 6-5 on the season. Each defeat has been to a team from the Volunteer state â twice each to Science Hill and Volunteer and once to Elizabethton to open the season. The Lady âDevils have already swept Daniel Boone this year.âWe are young in nature and new in spots,â explained Reed. âWe need all the reps we can get and every rep weâve gotten so far has made us physically and mentally better. These Tennessee teams have been tough this year. Across the board they have been tough. We have no reason not to get better by playing them. They have helped us tremendously in our growth as a team.â\n\nComplete Story"
