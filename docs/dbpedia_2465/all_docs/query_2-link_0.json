        "text": "“Sing when you’re nine up, you only sing when you’re nine up.” This was a reference to City’s 9-0 demolition of Bournemouth the week before.\n\n1. What distinction is held by Harry Parr?\n\nThe only City player to win an England Amateur International cap (v Ireland in February 1947).\n\n2. Which former City star coaches Gunn, Johansen and Lawlor?\n\nDavid Felgate, who is the goalkeeping coach for Manchester City’s Elite Development Squad; Angus Gunn, Eirik Holmen Johansen and Ian Lawlor are the goalkeepers. The EDS side plays in the U21 Premier League under Patrick Vieira.\n\n3. Why was the great Joe Mercer waxing lyrical about Lincoln City in April 1976?\n\nAs the manager of opponents Coventry City for our Fourth Division championship celebration match on 28 April, Joe wrote some very complimentary things about Graham Taylor’s team in an article in the match programme. He was also featured in the Echo.\n\n4. Which player had a different name when he left Lincoln?\n\nGary Fletcher, who became Gary Taylor-Fletcher when he married wife Viv Taylor in 2004.\n\n5. What amusing taunt was sung by Walsall fans during the Third Division match at Fellows Park on 27 December 1982?\n\n“Sing when you’re nine up, you only sing when you’re nine up.” This was a reference to City’s 9-0 demolition of Bournemouth the week before.\n\n6. Which City player became the first footballer to be created a life peer?\n\nTom Burlison, trade union leader, was created Baron Burlison of Rowlands Gill in 1997. He never made a first team appearance for City during his 3-year spell and moved on to Hartlepools in 1957.\n\n7. … and which City player became a Knight in 2005?\n\nSimon Yeo, who joined the newly-formed and sadly short-lived New Zealand Knights before returning to Lincoln a few months later. Despite playing only 12 games for them, he finished top scorer for the season with 5 as the Knights finished 20 points adrift at the bottom of the A-League in 2005-06.\n\nThey lasted only another season before the A-League revoked their licence because of poor attendances (averaging 3909 and 3014 in their two seasons in a 25,000 capacity stadium). They also finished bottom that season, a point behind Perth Glory.\n\n8. Who finished City’s top scorer for five successive seasons?\n\nLee Thorpe: 14 in 1997-98, 10 in 1998-99 (joint top with Tony Battersby), 17 in 1999-00, 13 in 2000-01, and 13 again in 2001-02.\n\n9. Why was Jonathan Lang a fixture at Sincil Bank in the early 1970s?\n\nHe was the sports writer for the Lincolnshire Chronicle, and also had a page allocated to him in the matchday programme.\n\n10. Which ex-City player has the middle name Marian?\n\nAdrian Patulea.\n\nWe’re trying to raise more money for the Football Club.\n\nSo, if you have any old Programmes/Shirts/Balls etc (Signed or not) that you’d like to donate for us to Auction on eBay, please contact lincoln@vitalfootball.co.uk.\n\nCheck out what we’re Auctioning on eBay RIGHT HERE.\n\nTweets by @VitalLincoln"
