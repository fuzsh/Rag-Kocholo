        "text": "Tennessee's Iamaleava Earns Spot on Maxwell Award Watch List\n\nPHILADELPHIA, Pa. â Tennessee quarterback Nico Iamaleava was recognized among the nation's best college football players entering the 2024 season as one of 80 individuals named to the preseason watch list for the 88th Maxwell Award, which is presented annually to the most outstanding college football player in the country. Iamaleava is the only player on the watch list that is not at least a sophomore in terms of athletic eligibility. The redshirt freshman signal caller is among 15 players from the Southeastern Conference and one of 41 quarterbacks who made the preseason list for the prestigious award. The full 2024 Maxwell Award watch list can be seen HERE. The Long Beach, California, native enters his second season with the program and is poised to be the Vols' starter in 2024 after serving as the backup quarterback and playing in five games during his true freshman season in 2023. Iamaleava arrived at Tennessee as the No. 1 prep player in the country according to On3 for the Class of 2023 and capped his debut season in Knoxville by leading the Volunteers to a convincing victory over No. 17 Iowa in the 2024 Cheez-It Citrus Bowl. Thrust into his first-career start, Iamaleava led the Big Orange to a 35-0 shutout victory in which he was named MVP after accounting for 178 yards of total offense and four touchdowns against a stout Hawkeye defense. By doing so, Iamaleava became the first UT true freshman quarterback to win a bowl game since Peyton Manning beat Virginia Tech in the 1994 Gator Bowl. Manning is the only Tennessee player to win the Maxwell Award, doing so in 1997. Hendon Hooker was a finalist in 2022 while his top target Jalin Hyatt was a semifinalist in that same year. Iamaleava finished his freshman season completing 28-of-45 passes for 314 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions while adding 71 rushing yards on 20 carries with three scores. Semifinalists for the Maxwell Award will be announced Nov. 12, 2024, while the three finalists for the Maxwell Award will be unveiled Nov. 26, 2024. The winner of the 88th Maxwell Award will be announced as part of the ESPN Home Depot College Football Awards Show held on Dec. 12, 2024. The formal presentation of the Maxwell Award will be made at the Maxwell Football Club Awards on Friday, March 14, 2025 at the College Football Hall of Fame in Atlanta. The Maxwell Award is a member of the National College Football Awards Association (NCFAA), which encompasses college football's most prestigious awards. The NCFAA's 25 awards have honored more than 900 recipients since 1935. This season, 12 NCFAA awards will honor national players of the week each Tuesday.\n\nComplete Story\n\nETSU's Lamb Adds Four Transfers for 2024 Including Bristol's Johnson\n\nJOHNSON CITY, Tenn. â ETSU Head Football Coach Tre Lamb announced on Friday the addition of four transfers, including former Tennessee High quarterback Steven Johnson, that will be on the field for the Bucs for the upcoming 2024 season.

ETSU's Chris Hope, Nate Brackett and Luke Smith were named to the Preseason All-SoCon First Team, while the Bucs were picked to finish sixth by the league's coaches. Hope, who was an All-SoCon Second Team pick by the media last season, started all 11 games for the Bucs in 2023. The Buccaneer defensive back led the team with 94 tackles, while adding 2.5 tackles for loss, a half sack and five pass break-ups. Hope posted four games with double-digit tackles and totaled a career-high 12 tackles against Jacksonville State and Western Carolina. Hope also totaled six tackles, 1.5 tackles for loss and a half sack versus Mercer and picked up eight solo tackles against Samford. The senior safety ranked 11th nationally in solo tackles per game (5.6) and 39th in total tackles per game (8.5). In his return to action in 2023, Brackett established himself as one of the top punters in the SoCon. Brackett totaled 47 punts on the 2023 season and averaged 43.37 yards per attempt. Four of those punts were touchbacks and Brackett pinned the opponents inside the 20-yard line 21 times. Brackett recorded a new career-long 70-yard punt in a victory over Carson-Newman on September 9, which ranked as the 15th-longest at the FCS level in 2023. Thirteen of his punts went 50 yards or more. He finished the season ranked 14th nationally in punt average (43.37). For his play last season, Brackett was named to the All-SoCon First Team by the league's coaches. Additionally, he was named the SoCon Student-Athlete of the Week on September 13. In his first season with ETSU, Smith was a key cog in the offensive line. Smith played in and started all 11 games at center for the Bucs. Smith helped open holes for ETSU's running game that was arguably the strength of the 2023 team as the Bucs ran for over 100 yards in seven of the 11 games in 2023 and topped the 200-yard mark four times. One of those 200-plus yard rushing days came on November 4 against VMI where the Bucs ran for 286 yards and three scores. For his play all season long, Smith landed a spot on the All-SoCon Second Team. The Bucs will open the 2024 season at Appalachian State on August 31. ETSU's home opener is set for September 7 vs. UVA Wise from Bank of Tennessee Field at William B. Greene Jr. Stadium. Season tickets for the 2024 season are on sale now.

Mashed things out on their boot game and got off the field on third downs.âMeanwhile, Iamaleava ran for three touchdowns and threw for another in producing 178 yards total offense. âFirst start, there was nothing that was too big for him (Iamaleava),â continued Heupel. âNever got rattled. Very composed, in control, communication, controlling the run game, just did an unbelievable job, decision-making, and then made plays with his feet as well.âThe Citrus Bowl Most Valuable Player was 12-of-19 passing for 151 yards.âI just took it as every other game,â said Iamaleava. âWe knew we had a job to do. No nervousness or anything going into the game when you prepare like our quarterback room does. Felt like we were just real prepared, and it was just time to go let it go.âThe biggest play by the defense came just ten minutes into the game when Andre Turrentine intercepted Iowa quarterback Deacon Hill in the end zone on third-and-goal at the four.âThey got a short field,â Heupel explained. âSpecial teams, we did not field the punt. We got backed up. We have a couple other penalties. We end up missing the ball on the rugby right.âGreat play by 'Dre undercutting it in the back side, extension, hands. Great to see him go perform the way that he did. That was a huge play and changed the dynamics of the game early in the football game. It was a huge play.âIamaleava got the Volunteers on the board with a 19-yard keeper on the first play of the second period and added a three-yard scamper on Tennesseeâs next possession for a 14-0 halftime lead.If it felt like the two scores were all the defense needed, they were. But the defense added more.James Pearce, Jr., crushed Hill, forcing a fumble by Hill that was recovered by Dominic Bailey at the Iowa two. Two players later, Iamaleava dove in for his third score of the day.On the Hawkeyesâ next possession, Pearce stepped in front of a Hill pass and raced 52 yards to paydirt giving the Volunteers a 28-0 lead two plays into the fourth quarter.âGreat job understanding the formation, where the bodies are at, what type of release he is getting,â explained Heupel of the Pearce pick-six. âAbility to take his eyes, undercut the route, and athletic enough to go make a play.âHe is on the JUGS a couple times a week just to make sure that he is ready for that opportunity. James might have asked why at one point in his career, but it is for that moment, and nothing looks better than seeing a big man like him run down the sidelines.âIamaleava capped the scoring with a 18-yard touchdown toss to senior transfer tight end McCallan Castles with 4:48 to go.Ramel Keyton and Squirrel White both had three receptions for Tennessee with Keyton going for 51 yards and White for 39 yards. Another first time starter, running back Dylan Sampson carried 20 times for 133 yards while Cameron Seldon added 55 yards on 13 attempts.Iowaâs Hill was just 7-of-18 passing for 56 yards. Freshman Marco Lainez came on starting the fourth period and ended up leading the Hawkeyes (10-4) in rushing with 57 yards on six carries. Hill was sacked four times and Lainez once. Tennessee outgained Iowa, 383-173 and out rushed the Hawkeyes, 232-113. The 35 points were the most scored this season on a Hawkeye defense that had held opponents to just 13.2 points per game and 274.8 yards per game, fourth and fifth respectively in the Division 1-FBS.âWe always want to come out and dominate at a really high level no matter who we are playing,â said Pearce. âKnowing we are playing a tough defense, I guess the best defense won.â 1 2 3 4 FINAL Iowa 0 0 0 0 0 Tennessee 0 14 7 14 35 Second Quarter(14:54) TENNESSEE â Nico Iamaleava 19 run (Charles Campbell kick); 7-73, 2:13, 0-7(8:12) TENNESSEE â Nico Iamaleava 3 run (Charles Campbell kick); 11-68, 5:09, 0-14Third Quarter(1:43) TENNESSEE â Nico Iamaleava 2 run (Charles Campbell kick); 2-2, 0:42, 0-21Fourth Quarter(14:15) TENNESSEE â James Pearce 52 interception return (Charles Campbell kick); 0-28(4:48) TENNESSEE â McCallan Castles 18 pass from Nico Iamaleava (Charles Campbell kick); 8-78, 3:16, 0-35 UConn Tennessee First Downs 11 25 Â Â Rushing 9 17 Â Â Passing 2 6 Â Â Penalty 0 2 Rushing Att-Yards 36-113 54-232 Passes Comp-Att-Int 9-25-2 12-20-0 Passing Yards 60 151 Total Plays - Offense 61-173 74-283 Fumbles - Lost 1-1 2-0 Penalties 5-41 3-30 3rd Down Conversions 2-15 3-12 4th Down Conversions 2-4 2-2 Red Zone Chances-Scores 1-0 5-4 Â Red Zone Chances - TD's 1-0 5-4 Â Red Zone Chances - FG's 1-0 5-0 Sacks 6-24 5-27 Tackles for Loss 6-24 8-40 Points off Turnovers 0 7 Field Goals Att - Made 0-0 0-0 Punts-Average 7-51.4 7-40.6 Individual StatisticsRushingIowa â Maco Lainez 6-57, Kaleb Johnson 7-34, Leshon Williams 1-17, Terrell Washington, Jr. 2-16, Jasiun Patterson 2-7, Nico againi 1-5, Kaleb Brown 1-3, Kamari Moulton 4-0, Deacon Hill 7-(-20).Tennessee â Dylan Sampson 20-133, Cameron Seldon 13-55, Nico Iamaleava 15-27, Khalifa Keith 4-10, Gaston Moore 2-7.PassingIowa â Deacon Hill 7-18-2-56, Marco Lainez 2-7-0-4.Tennessee - Nico Iamaleava 12-19-0-151, Gaston Moore 0-1-0-0.ReceivingIowa â Kaleb Brown 3-39, Addison Ostrenga 2-14 Nico Ragainin 2-3, Steven Stillanos 1-4, Leshon Johnson 1-0.Tennessee â Ramel Keyton 3-51, Squirrel White 3-39, Kaleb Webb 2-18, Chas Nimrod 2-16, McCallan Castles 1-18, Jacob Warren 1-9.\n\nComplete Story\n\nSophomores Disruptive Forces for Volunteer Defense\n\nMy CheezIt Citrus Bowl Most Valuable Player vote went to Tennesseeâs James Pearce, Jr. The sophomore Volunteer linebacker had a modest three tackles on the day, but one was a sack and another forced a fumble that Tennessee recovered at the Iowa two and scored two plays later. âIt is always a lot of fun to get to the quarterback,â said Pearce. âI got a job to do, got to beat the man up front and get to the quarterback somehow.â Pearce also was credited with one quarterback hurry and recorded a 52-yard pick six. âJames did an unbelievable job the entire day,â said Tennessee coach Josh Heupel. âObviously, everybody saw the big pick, but he was in the backfield and made it uncomfortable for the quarterback all day long.â Volunteer defensive coordinator Tim Banks hinted earlier this week at Pearce increasing his versatility going forward. âJames has a great football future in front of him.â added Heupel. âHe is a great player right now, but really believe he has a chance to be extremely special. âHe is dynamic. He has multiple moves to affect the quarterback, but there is still growth in some of those fundamentals, and he can continue to grow in how he defends the run. He is doing that well, but there is still some growth there. I say all of that. He is a dynamic playmaker for us,but he has a really rare and bright future in front of him.â Sophomore linebacker Tyre West tallied four tackles and 1Â½ sacks for the Volunteers while sophomore defensive lineman Elijah Herring was credited with one sack and two tackles for loss. Both tallied four tackles on the day. Sophomore Kalib Perry also made his first start at linebacker. âWe have a lot of guys coming back that have played a lot of football,â noted Heupel. âWe have rotated a bunch of guys. They have all had days where they were extremely violent and disruptive, got to the quarterback, played the run game extremely well. âThat group has got a chance, if they do it the right way this off-season, fundamentally, continuing to change their bodies, football IQ, understanding of the game, to be a game-changing unit. We need that from them.â GAME NOTES â¦ The contest was Tennessee's 55th all-time bowl game appearance, which ranks fifth nationally.

The portal couldnât have been more rewarding.Not only did Austin avoid a second straight dismal season at ETSU under George Quarles, who was fired after two seasons last week, but heâs starting on a Troy team that will host Appalachian State in the Sun Belt Conference championship on Saturday at 4 p.m.The setting wonât require any added incentive, but the Trojans lost 32-28 at Appalachian State last season when the Mountaineers completed a 53-yard touchdown pass on the gameâs final play.âIt was a College GameDay game and Appy State threw a 53-yard Hail Mary to win the game,â Austin said. âSo getting to play them for a conference championship at our place â itâs crazy how things come full circle.âTroy started 1-2 this season. The losses came to Kansas State and James Madison. But the Trojans have won eight straight since Austin began starting at left guard.He also started 10 straight quarters at center due to an injury, taking over at the beginning of the second half in a win against Texas State. Austin, who played tackle at Science Hill, said he hadnât played center since his freshman season at Tennessee High.âWhen I first went in there at halftime in that Texas State game I was a little nervous and overwhelmed with everything,â Austin said, âjust because, I mean, to be at that position at this level, it's a big responsibility.âIt was a transition year for the Trojans. Troy had to replace two starters on the offensive line and offensive line coach Cole Popovich, who took a job with the Houston Texans. Austin was one of a handful of offensive linemen that arrived via the portal.âWe played around with some stuff like the first three games, guys at different positions and stuff, and then we kind of found one that worked,â Austin said. âAnd we went on a roll. I think we went three or four games in a row without a sack.âFirst-year offensive line coach Joe Bernardi, who began his career as a graduate assistant for two years on Derek Dooleyâs staff at Tennessee (2011-12), is quick to commend Austin.âBlake's done a great job,â Bernardi said. âI respect his work ethic, his preparation. He's very coachable. His craft is important to him. So I really enjoy coaching him.âHe's a great kid. He's already graduated, wants to be a teacher. I'm really excited for him and his future.âAustinâs work in a pinch at center was particularly impressive.âWe had worked him at center a little bit over the course of the summer, just in case something happened,â Bernardi said. âAnd then in the Texas State game it happened. And we had to put him in there at halftime and he played the whole second half and did a really good job and gave us chance to win the game.âAnd then we came back on a short week and we played South Alabama, and they were a really talented defensive front. And that was a hard game where the kids really played their tails off. And he did a great job â really, really prepared hard for that game, making sure that everybody would be on the right page and the communication aspect of it.âTroy football is the talk of the town every autumn.âOur stadium here holds the capacity of the town,â Austin said. âThe community really pours everything they have into this program. I went to Wal-Mart last night (Wednesday) and the greeter at Wal-Mart was talking about our game Saturday and how he's excited to see me. And I've never even met this guy in my life.âEverybody is just so invested in this program and there's just so much tradition behind this program that it's just something that people want to get behind. It makes it fun playing just because you know how much people care about it here.âAustin said itâs easy to envision East Tennessee State becoming a Troy or Appalachian State type of program. Heâs encouraged by former teammates who appear optimistic about new ETSU head coach Tre Lamb.âTalking to some of the guys today (Thursday), they said they're excited about it,â Austin said. âAnd I'm excited for them. I want to see success for them.âAfter transferring it was hard seeing them have another season like they did. I know what that's like. I'm just excited for them to have a new opportunity to help grow a program that I know can be so great. ETSU is a place that has the potential to be such a phenomenal place, and just having somebody there that can possibly do that for them is exciting for the future.âAustin enjoyed his three seasons with Randy Sanders at ETSU. Wins against Vanderbilt, Kennesaw State and Mercer are cherished.âCoach Sanders definitely knew how to connect with players on a personal level,â Austin said. âThatâs what made it fun playing with him. There were times when it was time for football and then times when it was time to be a friend or a mentor. And Coach Sanders was definitely that guy.âAustin fondly recalls Friday nights in a Science Hill uniform playing with skill players such as Jaylan Adams, Drew Morrison and TJ Patton and linemen Tre Stuart, Zach Colvin, Ryan Miles, Stephen Grant and Trey Gasteiger. A win at Dobyns-Bennett his junior season was arguably his most exciting triumph.âWe put the whooping on those boys,â Austin said.Austin has helped the Trojans whip opponents, Bernardi said, with his actions on and off the field.âBlake's got a good sense of humor. He doesn't take himself very seriously,â Bernardi said. âI've really enjoyed getting to know him and developing a close relationship with him. I think his future's bright in the game. I think he's only going to keep getting better.âHe has been an incredibly valuable asset to this team this year because of his personality and how important it is to him and his work ethic and his improvement from spring ball to summer to fall camp to the season.âIndeed, itâs been quite the whirlwind.âI came on my visit three days before our first team meeting,â Austin said. âIt was a quick turnaround. I mean, they contacted me late while I was in the portal. I knew this was the greatest opportunity that I was gonna get in the portal, and everything just worked out.â\n\nComplete Story\n\nMiltonâs Six Touchdowns Leads Tennessee to Senior Day Win Over Vandy\n\nJoe Milton saved his finest performance at Neyland Stadium for his last in the hallowed cathedral, accounting for all six touchdowns in Tennesseeâs 48-24 Senior Day victory over Vanderbilt on Saturday afternoon.âHe (Milton) was decisive, in the right spot and recognized coverage,â said Tennessee coach Josh Heupel. âSmart decision-making, accurate with the football.âMilton completed 22-of-33 passes for a career-high 383 yards and four touchdowns and added a pair of two-run keepers in becoming the first Volunteer with six touchdowns responsible for since Jonathan Crompton against Memphis in 2009.âYou go out with a bang,â Milton said. âEvery game you try to do that and the most important one is the last one inside the stadium. Thatâs the legacy that I am going to hold on and leave to me guy Nico (Iamaleava).âIamaleava, the Volunteersâ heralded five-star quarterback prospect, logged his most significant playing time of the season, completing 9-of-12 passes for 66 yards.The Volunteer offense picked up 617 total yards on the day as well, including 449 through the air, all behind the fifth different starting offensive line combo of the season that included Jackson Lampleyâs first career-start at right guard. Bluff Cityâs Dayne Davis, a game-time decision coming in, made is second consecutive start at right tackle.âProud of the offensive line, that group, was extremely beat up,â added Heupel. â(Offensive Line) Coach (Glenn) Elarbee and I were just talking, Iâve never been a part of it, as a player, as a coach, just how it unfolded this year for whatever reason. All of the guys have continued to step up and guys came back and competed. Itâs a really good group.âTennessee (4-4, 8-4) scored a touchdown on their opening possession for the ninth time in 12 games when Milton found Ramel Keyton on a 56-yard deep cross on the third play one minute into the game.After the Commodores evened the count on their first possession, found both his tight ends â senior transfer McCallan Castles and Knoxville senior Jacob Warren â for scores. âJacob is a guy that it means everything to him to wear the Power T,â noted Heupel. âCallie â new to the program, fully invested, bought into everything. Both are extremely unselfish players. Theyâd rather see the other guy catch a touchdown than themselves. Two dynamic players. They had a good night.âMcCallan Castles was up first from ten yards out followed by Jacob Warrenâs 34-yard grab for a 21-7 lead.âItâs a play weâve had for a couple of weeks on the back end, kind of holding up to it,â explained Castles. âThe whole time they were saying that guy is going to be around you and Joe is going to just throw it right on his head. He threw a perfect ball. I just had to make a catch and the rest is history. Touchdown.âThe teams traded field goals before Miltonâs first rushing touchdown gave the Volunteers a 31-10 lead at halftime. Milton found Keyton for a second time on a 46-yard hook and added his second two-yard scamper with 13 seconds left in the third period for a 45-10 cushion going to the fourth.Keyton finished with four catches for a team-best 122 yards.âIâm proud of Ramel,â said Heupel. âHe wasnât a hundred percent earlier in the year, but he just continued to fight and compete. To go and finish it inside of Neyland Stadium the way he did tonight, it was awesome to see.âSquirrel White finished with a team-high 10 receptions for 110 yards while Warren had 82 yards on three grabs.After a slow start on the ground, the Volunteers rushed for 168 yards on 32 attempts. Jaylan Wright carried 11 times for 75 yards and eclipsed the 1,000-yard mark for the season. Itâs the 19th overall 1000-yard rushing season for a Volunteer since the first of Johnnie Jonesâ back-to-back 1,000 yards seasons in 1982 and the first since Jalen Hurdâs 1,288 yards in 2015.âJaylen started out as an elite talent that was really fast and wanted to run around everybody, to a real running back that understands how to use the guys in front of him,â Heupel said.After the Commodoresâ initial drive and through the third quarter, Vanderbilt totaled only 152 yards of offense. Junior walk-on defensive back Will Brooks made his first career start and led Tennessee with eight total tackles, including one tackle for loss. Meanwhile, safety Jaylen McCollough made his 50th career start, tying the Volunteer team record of Jonathan Hefney (2004-07).Prior to the game a total of 35 seniors were honored in pregame ceremonies including Greenevilleâs Will Albright and Jonesboroughâs Austin Lewis.âWeâre proud of this group,â said Heupel. âA lot of them were here when I first got here and chose to stay here through some uncertainty. They bought into our vision of what the program can and would be about. Itâs a phenomenal group.âTennessee will learn of its bowl assignment on Sunday. Most every bowl projection has the Volunteers headed to the Gator Bowl. CBS Sports, 247 Sports and ESPN project North Carolina as the opponent, while College Football News foresees a rematch with Clemson with ESPN2 favoring North Carolina State. 1 2 3 4 FINAL Vanderbilt 7 3 0 14 24 Tennessee 14 16 14 3 48 First Quarter(14:00) TENNESSEE â Ramel Keyton 56 pass from Joe Milton (Charles Campbell kick); 3-76, 0:55, 0-7(11:34) VANDERBILT â Junior Sherrill 19 pass from A.J.

After Jaylen Wright rushed for 75 yards on play number one, Tennessee managed just 55 yards more on the ground the rest of the afternoon in a 38-10 loss to the Bulldogs at sold-out Neyland Stadium. Georgia tied the all-time winning streak by an SEC team with its 28th consecutive victory, 24 of which have been by double digits with an average margin of victory of 25.6 points, a margin that grew slightly wider in the whipping of the Volunteers. The Bulldogs (8-0, 11-0) also became the first team to finish 8-0 in league play for three straight years. âThey (Georgia) are so big, long athletic and physical, and play with great fundamentals and technique,â said Tennessee coach Josh Heupel. âTheyâve been a really good football team and they have been for a while. To do what theyâve done, you have to be a good team.â The Volunteers (3-4, 7-4) couldnât get off the field defensively and couldnât stay on the field offensively. The Volunteer converted only 2-of-11 third-down conversions while Georgia moved the chains on 9-of-13 third-down plays. The âDawgs also possessed the ball 41 minutes to Tennesseeâs 19 minutes and were also 5-for-5 in the red zone with five touchdowns. âThereâs been a lot of good ball played by the orange in that stadium for a while,â continued Heupel. Today was not our best football.â After the initial run by us, we had a little bit of efficiency but couldnât sustain drives. We werenât able to sustain anything. They were able to make plays, stay on the field, convert third downs and score points. Following Wrightâs touchdown, Georgia scored on four of its next five possession to take a 24-7 lead. Tennessee did manage a Charles Campbell field goal on the final play of the first half and got a stop on the Bulldogs opening series of the third quarter. But the offense lost one yard on three plays and Georgia scored back-to-back touchdowns to end any lingering doubt. âI like that we were able to get something out of the two-minute drive at the end of half,â added Heupel. âDefense started fast in the third quarter and offense wasnât able to put anything together. Disappointing.â Tennesseeâs roster was down its two starting tackles and was already minus a pair of starting wide receivers and a starting linebacker. Additionally, A walk-on received significant playing time in the secondary. During the game, the Volunteers saw another offensive lineman Javontez Spraggins go down. Bluff Cityâs Dayne Davis started at right tackle in place of Gerald Mincey, who was pressed into duty when Davis was injured. âWeâre banged up,â noted Heupel. âYou saw that before the game, during the game. But football doesnât care. There are no asterisks. Next man has to be up and ready to go play at a championship level.â Wright rushed for just 15 more yards on eight more attempts following the first-play burst. Jabari Small added 25 yards on six attempts. Joe Milton completed 17-of-30 passes, but for just 147 yards. Squirrel White and Chas Nimrod both finished with five receptions. Combined with last weekâs seven-point out at Missouri, the Volunteer have put just 17 points on the board the last two weeks. Meanwhile, Georgia quarterback was an extremely efficient 24-of-30 for 298 yads and three touchdowns.

Greene, Jr. Stadium. Junior defensive back Sheldon Arnold II got things rolling when he returned a blocked field goal 99 yards for a touchdown late in the first quarter and the Buccaneer offense tacked on four touchdown drives en route to ending the campaign with a victory. Despite being outgained by nearly 100 yards, 373 to 278, the Bucs used a strong first half effort to grab momentum and open a big lead. The Bulldogs ran 40 more plays than ETSU, 86 to 46, but the Bucs averaged 6.0 yards per play, compared to The Citadel finishing with 4.3 yards per play. Both teams turned the ball over twice â resulting in touchdown drives â while ETSU scored touchdowns on its three trips inside the red zone. The Citadel went 2-for-4 in the red zone with one touchdown and one field goal. The Bucs finished the season with an overall record of 3-8 and a 2-6 mark in SoCon play, while The Citadel went 0-11 (0-8) in the first season of the Maurice Drayton era. After causing havoc in the punting game all season with four blocks, this time the field goal unit stepped up as defensive lineman Max Evans got his paw on the football via Colby Kintner's 39-yard attempt. The ball ended up on the one-yard line with Arnold scooping it up and maneuvering his way through open holes â taking it all the way back for the score. The 99-yard play was the third-longest in Buccaneer program history â the last since Ronnie Horton had a 99-yard kickoff return against Chattanooga in 1980. The Blue & Gold then generated three scoring drives in the second quarter as Trey Foster â who rushed for 96 yards on 17 carries â scored on an eight-yard run and later found pay dirt a four-yard spurt. Sandwiched between the two rushing scores was a 13-yard touchdown reception from Haynes Eller to Xavier Gaillardetz.The Bucs took a 28-10 lead into halftime. The Bucs capped off their scoring midway through the third quarter when Eller found Jaylen Frierson for a 25-yard scoring pass to cap off a 5-play, 39-yard drive, which started after Zach West came away with a fumble recovery. West later picked up an interception to help seal the win in the fourth quarter. The Citadel opened the second half by generating a turnover when Frierson coughed one up after a 19-yard catch and the Bulldogs scored three plays later as Malachi Taylor hauled in a 36-yard touchdown reception at the 12:54 mark of the third quarter. Kintner tacked on two field goals later in the stanza to make it 35-23. Both teams played a scoreless fourth quarter and ETSU secured the 12-point victory. To go with his one touchdown reception, Gaillardetz finished with five catches for 103 yards, marking his first career 100-yard receiving game. Eller got the starting nod at quarterback and finished 9-of-15 for 163 yards and two touchdowns. Defensively, Stephen Scott and Chris Hope both finished with double-digit tackles. Scott finished with 12 and Hope added 10 hits, two pass break-ups and had a 40-yard punt return â the first of his career. As a unit, ETSU finished with 71 tackles, eight tackles for loss, three sacks, one fumble recovery and an interception. The Citadel entered the day allowing just four sacks on the season. Jaylen George totaled four tackles and 1.5 sacks and Deven Brantley added another full sack. Citadel quarterback Graeson Underwood went 22-for-43 for 244 yards with one touchdown and one interception. Taylor led the Bulldogs with seven catches for 86 yards and one score. Prior to the game, ETSU honored 23 seniors who played their final game inside Greene Stadium on Saturday.\n\nComplete Story\n\nPenalties Costly as Carson-Newman Drops Season Finale to Catawba\n\nA struggling offense combined with its most penalty yards in four years proved too touch to overcome in Carson-Newmanâs 24-14 season-ending loss to Catawba Saturday afternoon at Burke-Tarr Stadium. The Eagles were flagged a dozen times for 140 yards, giving the Indians five first downs via penalty, and the offense came up empty on two first-half scoring opportunities as the visitors built a 21-0 lead. The defeat was the first on Senior Day for Carson-Newman since 2018. \"This game is indicative of the other games where we've struggled,â said Carson-Newman coach Mike Clowney said. \"We create a lot of problems for ourselves, when we talk about the penalties. We have to look at refining some things from a detail standpoint.\" Down a touchdown and with a first-and-goal at the Indians' three, Carson-Newman was stuffed on four consecutive plays to turn the ball over on downs at the one yard-line. After a Catawba fumbled at their own 38, Carson-Newman had a Cade Meeks reception on would-be fourth down conversion overturned due to penalty. \"Those (missed scoring opportunities) were majorly impactful,\" Clowney said. \"We let our lack of composure get to us at points in time today. We just didn't handle things the way that we needed to, to win a tough football game.\" If we get the score, we get it even and give ourselves a little momentum on a day you know you're not playing with all your cards te way that you need to. We really needed to get that done, but we didn't.\" The Eagles finally got on the board with late in the third quarter. Quarterback Zane Whitson scrambled for a first down and then the Dobyns-Bennett product hit former Science Hill Hilltopper Drew Morrison for a nine-yard score. \"He (Morrison) has been asking all year, 'get me the ball, get me the ball,'\" Whitson said \"He went to Science Hill and I went to Dobyns-Bennett so that's a rivalry in high school, but we found that connection here in college. It was fun to finally get him one.\" Whitson later tossed a touchdown pass to Jeron Newson for the final scoring, finishing the day with 288 total yards. The sophomore finished 14-of-33 passing for 234 yards and the two scores and also led the Eagles on the ground with 54 yards on nine carries. Both teams finish the season at 5-6 with Eagles 4-5 in South Atlantic Conference Play and Catawba 3-6 inside league action.\n\nComplete Story\n\nKingsportâs Whitson Leads Carson-Newman to Big Win at UVA-Wise\n\nDobyns-Bennett product Zane Whitson threw for 188 yards and three touchdowns in leading Carson-Newman to a 52-7 South Atlantic Conference whipping of UVA-Wise Saturday at Carl Smith Stadium.Three of Whitsonâs scoring tosses came in the first period as the Eagles (4-4, 5-5) exploded to a 28-0 lead.It was the defense that started the scoring and set the tone for the day as William Johnson III intercepted a pass on the gameâs first play for a 16-yard pick six.The second Cavalier drive of the day also ended with an interception that the Eagles turned into a Tyler Curtis six-yard score a 14-0 lead just 3Â½ minutes into the game.Whitson then found Jeron Newman for a 33-yard hook-up and 21-0 lead with 4:36 still left in the opening period.\"He (Whitson) is really composed,\" said Carson-Newman coach Mike Clowney said. \"I thought he did a good job leading the offense. Zane has continued to learn to communicate. Guys are getting behind him and making plays for him.\"On the Eaglesâ next possession, Whitson hit Galen Washinton down the left sideline. Washington made a couple of defenders miss to complete the 83-yard touchdown and the seventh-longest touchdown reception in Carson-Newman history.\"We had a little double move on the right side,\" explained Whiteson. \"He (Washington) ended up making a great play. I didn't throw that great of a ball, but he still made a dude miss and took it to the house. I think that accelerated us forward, because that was part of our game plan. We were able to execute more things because of that play.\"It was Washington's first career touchdown and one both he and Whitson envisioned based on the defensive looks provided by UVA-Wise.\"They were playing a lot of no safety today, just focusing on the run,\" Washington said. \"That opened us up with a one-on-one matchups outside. In our (wide receiver) room, we feel like one-on-one is very disrespectful with no safety help, so we took advantage of that today.\"The defense scored again with a 40-yard scoop and score by Major Williams and Andrew Sybertâs 22-yard field goal made it 38-0 at the break.Whitsonâs third touchdown toss came less than four minutes into the second half as Cade Meeks grabbed the 19-yard reception.Whitson finished the day 10-of-14 with no interceptions.\"It's everybody buying in and doing the right thing,\" Whitson said. \"Throughout the week, I feel like everybody's preparing to the maximum capability that they have. With everybody bought in and pushing towards one direction, we're doing a great job as a team coming together. It's helping us have success on the field.\"Since returning to the starting role last week against Emory & Henry, Whitson is 20-of-31 for 399 yards and five touchdowns and the Eagles have outpointed the opposition 89-14.Additionally, Whitson has only been sacked once in the two starts thanks to an offensive line that included right guard Fletcher Gibson of West Ridge, who made its eighth consecutive start against the Cavs.\"Our O-line did a great job,\" Whitson said after the Wasps failed to get to him. \"It felt like I was playing backyard football, I was sitting back there so long. Our receivers did a great job and were able to make big-time plays. Everybody executed at a high level.\" Whitson gave way to Walker Martinze the rest of the way and the former Anderson County Maverick found ex-Maverick teammate Eli Davis for a five-yard score and 52-0 lead with 12:09 to go.Wise (1-7, 2-8) was able to avoid the home shutout by recovering a muff punt and the Eagle 37. Former Greeneville Greene Devil Jaevon Gillespie rambled in from two yards out for the final margin.Major Williams finished the day with five tackles and 2.5 for loss, giving him 10 tackles for a loss on the season, the most ever for a Carson-Newman defensive back. Williams also added a pass breakup and the fumble return for the touchdown. Linebacker Mekhi Brown hit double digit tackles for the third time this season, recording 10 stops and half a tackle for a loss. Kendall Williams finished with five tackles and a pick. Long clocked out with three tackles, two sacks, two tackles for a loss and a forced fumble as the Eagle defense limited Wise to just eight first downs and 209 total yards in the game.\"Those guys (on defense) needed a complete effort,\" remarked Clowney. \"They did that up front, with our guys controlling the line of scrimmage. I thought our guys on the back end did a good job of seeing things that were going to happen, anticipating throws and then being able to make plays off of it.\"Carson-Newman returns home for its season finale next week, hosting league foe Catawba at 1:00 p.m. at Burke-Tarr Stadium.\n\nComplete Story\n\nElizabethtonâs Rollins Accounts for Five TDâs in Maryville win at North Carolina Wesleyan\n\nFormer Elizabethton Cyclone Bryson Rollins accounted for five touchdowns and the Maryville defense picked off five passes in the Scotsâ 49-14 win at North Carolina Wesleyan on Saturday.The victory is the third straight for Maryville (4-2, 7-2) while the defeat snaped Wesleyanâs four-game winning streak.Rollins finished 25-of-40 passing for 294 yards and three touchdowns against no interceptions, his third straight game without an interception.\"Bryson did a good job of valuing the ball and making plays,\" said Maryville coach Ben Fox, a former Daniel Boone Trailblazer.Rollins also paced the Scots on the ground with 11 carries for 46 yards and two more scores.âThis is his second game in a row leading us in rushing,â noted Fox.Rollins got the Scots on the board with a 37 yards run just over six minutes in and three minutes later found Steph Carter for a 34-yard strike and 14-0 lead. After Wesleyan cut the lead in half at the break, Rollins ran for a three-yard score and hit Jaden Jones from 12 yards out as Maryville took a 28-7 advantage to the fourth period.The lead swelled to 35-7 early in the fourth as Rollins found Carter for a second time from 13 yards out.Carter finished with four receptions for 70 yards while Rollinsâ former Cyclone teammate, Corey Russell hauled in ten grabs for 137 yards. \"Our guys made plays and caught the ball,â added Fox. âSteph and Corey were terrific. Corey is having an exceptional year.\"As is Rollins, who is up to 16 touchdowns passing and 12 more scores on the ground. His 28 total touchdowns lead the USA South. For the season, Rollins has thrown for 2,489 yards with a 63.5% completion percentage, both of which lead the league.Just a sophomore, Rollins is already the schoolâs all-time passing leader with 5,044 yards.In the fourth quarter, Tyler Barrett and Jadon Smith returned interceptions for touchdowns. Cayden Phillips also had a pickoff while Cameron Spivey came up with two.The Scots also recorded five quarterback sacks on the day.\"Defensively, we played well again,\" said Fox. \"We put them in some bad spots early and held firm. Wesleyan has some players who are really good, and we did some things against them to limit their effectiveness for most of the game. \"Obviously, turnovers were a major part in allowing us to play so well.\"Maryville hosts Southern Virginia (1-8, 1-5 USA South) next Saturday for Senior Day. Kickoff is 1:00 p.m.\n\nComplete Story\n\nBig Plays, Defensive Scores Highlight Tennesseeâs Homecoming Win Over UConn\n\nTennessee produced three scoring plays of 60 yards or more and scored three defensive touchdowns for the first time in school history in a 59-3 Homecoming pasting of UConn at sold-out Neyland Stadium Saturday afternoon.All three splash plays came in the first half and were followed by the defensive tallies all in succession. The Volunteer offense compiled over 400 yards in the first two quarters and finished with 650 total yards on 65 offensive plays for a ten-yard average per snap.âI wouldnât say this was the best performance that we are capable of, but there were a lot of really good things,â said Tennessee coach Josh Heupel. âAll in all, good performance, but our best is still out there.âThe Volunteers were adorned with Pat Summitt blue accessories for the second consecutive Homecoming contest to highlight Alzheimerâs awareness.âAwesome atmosphere,â added Heupel. âPlaying in that type of game is a unique opportunity to honor her a little bit. I appreciate everyone coming and supporting that cause.âTennessee scored on the gameâs second snap as Jaylen Wright sprinted up the middle for an 82-yard touchdown. Wright, who had an 83-yard touchdown at Vanderbilt, and LaMarkus Coker are the only Volunteers with multiple 80-yard runs in their careers.âJaylenâs had huge, long runs, but theyâve come because of the growth of him as a football player,â Heupel said. âItâs not just a toss on the outside and he outruns everybody. He understands how to press, understands the fit, the read, bounces it when he needs to, staying vertical. That one hit right up the middle.âFollowing UConnâs only score on the day, a 22-yard Noe Ruelas field goal, Tennessee quarterback Joe Milton found Ramel Keyton wide open for a 60-yard reception and score.Milton added a six-yard run for a score midway through the second period and then hit Squirrel White in full stride across the middle with White racing 83 yards for a 28-3 lead.âI saw the safeties back off, so I knew I had the middle of the field open,â White said.Milton finished 11-of-14 on the day for 254 yards and two touchdowns and has completed 28-of-34 passes over the last two games.âJoe is still a young starter within our system,â noted Heupel. âHeâs been here and heâs had opportunities at the end of the games, but he is still new as a starter. There are a lot of new pieces and moving pieces around him. Because of that and his effort, heâs continued to grow, too, with the guys around him, so the efficiency the last few weeks has been pretty solid.âThe defense then took over, scoring three times in less than six minutes, starting with Tyler Baronâs 24-yard scoop of score of Gabe Jeudy-Lallyâs forced fumble.After having other potential scores taken off the board by penalty, Baron was relieved this one stood.âI just want to shout out Gabe Jeudy-Lally,â said Baron. âThere was a little PTSD to be honest. I thought it might get it called back.âIt was Baronâs first career touchdown and first since high school. The senior paid tribute to injured Kamal Hadden afterwards.âItâs been a while since Iâve had one thatâs stuck on the board,â Baron added. âThat celebration was paying tribute to Kamal. Thatâs one of our brothers that we lost this season to injury. I wanted to show him that we still love him.âAhead 35-3 at the break, Tennessee fans were certainly anticipating the insertion of freshman five-star quarterback Nico Lamaleava in the second half.Instead, the Volunteer defense kept putting points on the board. On the first play of the second half, Jaylen McCullough stepped in front of a TaâQuan Roberson pass for a 30-yard pick six. Three minutes later, Aaron Beasley did the same with a 39-yard return.While McCullough was able to stroll in on his return, Beasley had to outrace a well-angled pursuer.âI saw a guy kind of have an angle,â explained Beasley. âI just wanted to make sure I got the touchdown. I had to get the touchdown.âThe two returns marked the first time in ten years (Western Kentucky) Tennessee had two pick-sixes in the game. Itâs also the fist time since December 4, 1971 (Penn State) the Volunteers and a fumble return and an interception return for touchdowns in the game. The three total defensive scores were the first since box scores were first archived in 1949.âThree touchdowns on the defensive side. The guys back there just told me they looked in the books and didnât think it had happened, so thatâs pretty cool,â continued Beasley.Lamaleava finally entered with 9:51 left in the third quarter and promptly directed an eight-play, 79-yard drive that culminated with his first career touchdown pass of 19 yards to tight end McCallan Castles.Playing only two series, Lamaleava completed 5-of-9 passes for 86 yards and also ran once for 25 yards.Gaston Moore took over for Lamaleava in the fourth period and led another eight-play drive the covered 45 yards and ended with Josh Turbyvilleâs first career field goal of 33 yards that accounted for the final margin. Turbyville, the Volunteersâ kick-off specialist, had also earlier booted his first career extra point.Moore gave way in the middle of his next drive to Volunteer legacy Navy Shuler, son of Tennessee legend Heath Shuler. Shuler completed his only pass attempt and rushed twice for 15 yards.The Volunteers rushed for 275 yards and passed for 375 yards in the game. Wright led the ground attack with 113 yards on eight attempts. Cameron Seldon ran six times for 35 yards and Patrick Wilk twice for 33 yards. Castles led the Tennessee receivers with four catches for 56 yards. âThat was a very fast and very talented offensive football team at every position,â said UConn coach Jim Mora.Roberson completed 24-of-40 passes for 218 yards for the Huskies. But Connecticut managed just 35 yards on 28 attempts rushing.LOCAL NOTES â¦ Sullivan East product Dayne Davis played extensively in the game at right tackle and on special teams, but wasnât one of the designated dive lineman on extra points â¦ Kingsportâs Charlie Browder made his season-debut and saw his first action since injuring a knee in last seasonâs season-opener against Ball State. Browder recorded his first two career receptions for a total of ten yards â¦ David Crockettâs Austin Lewis spent several series on the defensive line for the Volunteers, recording one of Tennesseeâs 13 tackles for loss on the day.CHILLY POSTGAME â¦ Video showed a tense pre-game encounter between the teams as Volunteer players took exception to Huskie players warming up on the home end of the field. After the game, Mora and Heupel exchanged a quick handshake with Mora appearing to say something to Heupel in the process.âThe only thing I can say is it was a tough game,â Mora said. âI am proud of our guys for the class they showed on that football field before, during and after the game.âHeupel downplayed the incident, but did flash a wry smirk back at Mora.âI donât know what I did on the back end of the handshake,â stonewalled Heupel. âThey (Connecticut) have a good football team thatâs played extremely hard.

Chattanooga generated 214 yards on its first 19 plays that resulted in the scoring drives, while the Bucs were held to 42 yards on their first 17 plays. For the game, ETSU mustered 120 yards of total offense (46 passing/74 rushing), compared to the Mocs totaling 418 (259 passing/159 rushing). Making his first collegiate start in his hometown, ETSU quarterback William Riddle went 8-for-25 for 46 yards and one interception and one fumble. Running back Bryson Irby registered 82 rushing yards on 18 carries. Chattanooga quarterback Chase Artopoeus â a UCLA transfer â went 17-of-24 for 249 yards and two touchdowns (one interception). Running back Gino Appleberry â filling in for starter Ailym Ford â rushed for 71 yards and two first-quarter touchdowns. Defensively, Jordan Hoskins and Zach West registered double-digit tackles. Hoskins finished with a game-high 11 hits and West finished with a career-high 10 tackles, two tackles for loss and one sack. Jayvon Henderson and Jaylen George tallied the two Buccaneer takeaways. The Bucs were penalized eight times for 91 yards and lost the time of possession by 12 minutes (36:00 to 24:00). With the loss, ETSU dropped to 2-5 overall and 1-3 in SoCon play, while Chattanooga â who has won the last four rivalry games â improved to 6-2, 5-1. Chattanooga scored on two short runs before Artopoeus hit Jamoi Mayes for a 45-yard score to go up 21-0 with 14:52 remaining in the second quarter. The Buccaneer defense finally got some stops when George ripped the ball right out of Appleberry's hands as the Mocs' running back was looking to score from inside the 10-yard line. Despite being forced to punt following the takeaway, ETSU's defense forced another turnover on the second straight drive when Henderson came away with his first career interception. Following a 31-yad return, the Bucs got on the board when Ewan Johnson connected on a 40-yard field goal with 3:55 remaining in the half. For the half, ETSU was outgained 272-75, while the Bucs were penalized six times for 72 yards. Chattanooga started the second half the same it began the first. After ETSU went three-and-out on its first series of the third quarter, the Mocs marched 47 yards on three plays and scored on a 26-yard strike from Artopoeus to Mayes, extending the lead to 28-3 with 12:02 remaining in the quarter. The Mocs tacked on two fourth-quarter field goals to secure the 31-point win. ETSU remains on the road as they head to Greenville, S.C. to take on No. 3 Furman next Saturday. Kickoff is set for 2:00 p.m.\n\nComplete Story\n\nVolunteers Implode in Second Half as Tide Rolls\n\nAlabama erased a 20-7 halftime deficit with 27 unanswered second half points to earn a 34-20 victory over Tennessee Saturday afternoon at Bryant-Denny Stadium.The win by the 11th-ranked Tide (5-0, 7-1) was the 16th in the last 17 games in the Third Saturday in October series and came on the heels of last yearâs game-of-the-year Tennessee victory in Knoxville.The No. 17 Volunteers (2-2, 5-2) dominated the first two periods, outgaining the Tide 187-36 in the first quarter and 275-133 in the first half. But Alabama needed 41 seconds and two plays to get back within one score. âWe went out and scored in two plays in the second half of the first drive and changed the momentum of the game and played really well from that time on,â said Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban. âObviously a pretty fun second half.âThe enjoyment continued as Alabama turned a special team gaffe into a 42-yard Will Reichard field goal on its second possession of the first half to get within 20-17.The Tide defense then stopped a second fourth-down conversion attempt by Tennessee inside its own territory and drove the short field of 47 yards capped by a Jase McCellan five-yard scamper around right end to give Alabama its first lead at 24-20 with 3:45 still left in the third period.Milroe finished 14-of 21 for 220 yards with two touchdowns, throwing a ten-yarder to Jermaine Burton for the Tideâs first score.âThis is the reason you come to college football to play in games like this,â said Milroe. âTo have moments like this that you will remember forever.âReichard extended Alabamaâs lead to 27-20 with a 50-yad boot halfway through the fourth quarter. The Tide then effectively sealed the game when Chris Braswell sacked Volunteer quarterback Joe Milton, forcing a fumble that Jihaad Campbell scooped and scored from 24 yards out.The cigars lit shortly thereafter, something the Volunteers had done a year ago.âIt was personal,â Braswell said. âIt was a personal game to us.âTennessee built its lead on the strength of a phenomenal first half from Milton, who was 16-of-24 for 175 yards and two touchdowns passing and had 43 yards on the ground.The Volunteers went ahead on their first possession thanks to a remarkable 39-yard scoring catch by Squirrel White. Chase Campbell added field goals of 24 and 26 yards before Milton closed the half with a six-yard pass to McCallan Castles 15 seconds before intermission.âExtremely disappointed with the outcome,â said Tennessee coach Josh Heupel. âWe donât play smart enough at time, but credit Alabama, particularly in the second half.âThey played extremely well and we just werenât good enough. From me, to our coaches, to our players, gotta be able to play for sixty minutes against a good football team on the road.âTennessee had possession in the red zone four times, but scored only one touchdown and was 0-for-3 on fourth down conversion. After failing on fourth-and-one at its own 34, then defense defense responded with J. McCollough picking off Milroe in the end zone.But the defense couldnât bail out the Volunteer offense on the failed conversion in the third period.âFelt like the scheme and based on the personnel they had out there and thought we had a good play,â explained Heupel. âFelt like we had an opportunity to pick it up and obviously did not. We gave them the short field and they took advantage of it.âMilton completed 28 of 41 passes for 271 yards and tallied 59 yards on the ground. White had eight receptions for 105 yards in the first half, but only two grabs for six yards in the final two quarters. Ramel Keyton compiled five grabs for 71 yards and Jaylen Wright seven for 44. Tennesseeâs running back room of Dylan Sampson, Jabari Small and Wright carried 23 combined times for a combined 74 yards.Defensive back Tamarion McDonald led Tennessee with ten tackles. McCollough was credited with seven tackles and Gabe Jeudy-Lally five.Tennessee was also flagged for eight penalties, three that resulted in Alabama first downs, including one on a would-be third-down stop and another one third-and-four via a defensive delay of game. The Volunteers were also flagged for a rare invalid fair catch signal, thus starting at its own four. Alabama was penalized one time for five yards.Tennessee stays on the road next week, traveling to Kentucky Saturday night for a 7:00 p.m. ESPN kickoff. 1 2 3 4 FINAL Tennessee 13 7 0 0 20 Alabama 0 7 17 10 34 First Quarter(12:39) TENNESSEE â Squirrel White 39 pass from Joe Milton (Charles Campbell kick); 8-75, 2:21, 7-0(2:00) TENNESSEE â Charles Campbell 24 FG; 15-79, 5:30, 10-0(0:11) TENNESSEE â Charles Campbell 26 FG, 5-15, 1:05, 13-0Second Quarter(7:05) ALABAMA â Jermain Burton 10 pass from Jalen Milroe (Will Reichart kick); 9-59, 4:05, 13-7(0:12) TENNESSEE â McCallan Castles 6 pass from Joe Milton (Charles Campbell kick); 10-80 2:58, 20-7Third Quarter(14:19) ALABAMA â Isaiah Bone 46 pass from Jalen Milroe (Will Reichart kick); 2-75, 0:41, 20-14(8:33) ALABAMA â Will Reichart 42 FG; 6-46, 3:58, 20-17(3:42) ALABAMA â Jase McClellan 5 run (Will Reichard kick); 5-47, 2:42, 20-24Fourth Quarter(8:17) TENNESSEE â Will Reichard 50 FG; 15-56, 7:51, 20-27(7:26) ALABAMA â Jihaad Campbell 24 fumble return (Will Reichard kick); 20-34 Tennessee Alabama First Downs 22 20 Â Â Rushing 10 7 Â Â Passing 12 10 Â Â Penalty 0 3 Rushing Att-Yards 38-133 42-138 Passes Comp-Att-Int 28-41-0 14-21-1 Passing Yards 271 220 Total Offense 79-404 63-358 Fumbles - Lost 1-1 1-1 Penalties 8-55 1-5 3rd Down Conversions 8-18 5-13 4th Down Conversions 0-3 0-0 Red Zone Chances-Scores 4-3 3-2 Â Red Zone Chances - TD's 4-1 3-2 Â Red Zone Chances - FG's 4-2 3-0 Sacks 4-36 3-33 Tackles for Loss 5-38 8-44 Points off Turnovers 7 0 Field Goals Att - Made 2-2 2-2 Punts-Average 5-53.2 5-43.6 Individual StatisticsRushingTennessee â Joe Milton 15-59, Dylan Sampson 4-28, Jabari Small 8-24, Jaylen Wright 11-22.Alabama â Jase McClellan 27-115, Roydell Williams 6-20, Jalen Milroe 9-3.PassingTennessee â Joe Milton 28-41-0-271Alabama â Jalen Milroe 14-21-1-220.ReceivingTennessee â Squirrel White 10-111, Jaylen Wright 7-44, Ramel Keyton 5-71, McCallan Castles 2-12, Dylan Sampson 2-9, Jacob Warren 1-14, Kaleb Webb 1-10.Alabama â Jermaine Burton 4-82, Isaiah Bond 3-77, Kendrick Law 2-38, Malik Benson 1-17, C.J.

The Pioneers, however, would drive for a game-tying 28-yard field goal by Nicholas Pope as time expired in regulation.Mutter completed 14-of-32 passes for 208 yards and the two scores two Peoples, who finished with four receptions for 94 yards. Anderson tallied 57 yards on the ground on 19 carries.Sophomore defensive back Chendrick Cann recorded 18 tackles, an interception and three passes defended while Knicely added 10 stops and an additional pass defended to his interception. Robinson notched nine stops and a pick as sophomore defensive lineman Chad Pouncy had eight tackles including 2Â½ for loss.Tusculumâs Palazzo completed 19 of his 42 attempts for 261 yards. The Chuckey-Doak product threw for three touchdowns, but also five interceptions.Robustelli caught four passes for two touchdowns and 127 yards and two touchdowns as Tyler Burke had six catches for 81 yards. Jalen Hunt rushed 17 times for 79 yards with Jojo Restall adding 67 yards on seven carries.Tusculum held a commanding 445-261 lead on total offense, gaining 184 yards on the ground. The Pioneers racked up 22 first downs compared to 18 for the Wasps.Emory & Henry visits Carson-Newman University next Saturday for a 3:00 p.m. contest with the Eagles. Tusculum travels to Erskine.Mars Hill 21, Carson-Newman 17Carson-Newman's defense stood tall most of the afternoon but gave up a backbreaking fourth-down conversion on a scoring drive in the final minutes to fall to Mars Hill in a South Atlantic Conference matchup inside Burke-Tarr Stadium.Before the Mountain Lions (6-1, 5-1 SAC) unleashed their game-winning possession in the fourth quarter, they'd managed just 29 total yards of offense in the second half. Mars Hill's earlier touchdown in the third quarter was set up by a blocked punt deep in Eagles (3-5, 2-4) territory.Opportunities for both teams to score were tough to come by. The Lions entered Saturday's contest as the No. 7 ranked run defense in the country, surrendering just 64.5 yards on the ground per game.Carson-Newman would break that trend, racking up 169 yards on the ground. Tyree Nelson did the bulk of the work, with 22 carries for 136 yards and a touchdown. It was the first 100-plus yard rushing day for a C-N running back this season and the most rushing yards Mars Hill has given up this year both to a team and to an individual back.The Eagles led 3-0, 10-7 and 17-14 in the contest. A 37-yard field goal Andrew Sybert, Carson-Newmanâs first of the year, accounted for the first advantage. Nelsonâs 37-yard run produced the second edge and a short run by James Maddox the third.The Lionsâ Courtney Slocum blocked a punt with Mars Hall recovering at the Carson-Newman 14 and two plays later taking a 14-10 lead on Martinâs 10-yard toss to Beau DeBerry.The Eagle defense produced back-to-back three-and-outs but with Mars Hall backed up to its own two, but escaped with a 17-yard completion and then converted a fourth-and-three from its own 33 with a 40-yard pass. Two Carson-Newman penalties edged the Lions closer with Martin scoring the eventual winning touchdown.Myers finished his day 10-of-21 passing for 169 yards, no touchdowns and a pickThe Eagles will return to the field next Saturday, Oct. 28, hosting the Emory & Henry Wasps inside Burke-Tarr Stadium for Homecoming. UVA-Wise 34, Erskine 23UVA-Wise rushed for a season-high 263 yards and scored four touchdowns on the ground en route to victory inside Carl Smith Stadium.The Flying Feet (0-6, 0-8) built its lead on a 44-yard touchdown to SeâMaj Johnson from Craig Pender and a 10-yard Pender toss to Ausin Damron.The Cavs (1-5, 2-6) got on the board with three ticks left in the first quarter on Jaevon Gillespieâs 10-yard scamper. UVA-Wise tied the game at 14-14 on a one-yard run in the third quarter by quarterback Jake Corken.After Erksine retook a 17-14 lead, Corken put the Cavs on top for good with another one-yard run. Jordan Whitley pushed the lead to ten when Jordan Whitley stepped in front a Pender pass and returned the interception 40 yards for a score. Zavier Lomax capped the Wise scoring with a four-yard burst with 9:57 to play. Lomax finished with 74 yards on 15 carries while Gillespie added 70 yards on 14 carries. Aydan Willis added a team-high 10 stops while Dacorian Jones-Montgomery registered nine tackles for the Cavs' defense.Next week, UVA-Wise travels to Mars Hill for a 1:00 p.m. kickoff.Maryville 26, LaGrange 6Former Elizabethton Cyclone Bryson Rollins accounted for all four touchdowns in the Scots 26-6 victory over LaGrange before a sold-out Homecoming crowd at Honaker Field at Lloyd Thornton Stadium.The Scots improved to 5-2 overall, matching last season's win total with three games remaining. Maryville evened its USA South record at 2-2.Rollins was 19-of-32 for 237 yards and one touchdown and rushed 13 times for 38 yards and three scores.Rollins went over 2,000 yards for the season (2,040) and bumped his career passing total to 4,595, extending his school record. Another former Cyclone, Corey Russell caught four passes for 74 yards, including a 17-yarder TD right before half. Eight different Maryville receivers made catches. Tyler Bost and Cameron Spivey were the Maryville tackle leaders with seven apiece, and Mike Bethea had a big game with six tackles, a sack and a forced fumble. Spivey broke up two passes, including a touchdown-saver in the end zone early in the second half. Saturday was the third time this year Maryville held an opponent under 200 yards (Sewanee 147, Shenandoah 146). The six points allowed were the fewest of the season.

Their d-line, their d-line, thatâs all we heard. Man, we were tired of hearing it,â said Davis. âTo come and squash it was a great feeling. We ran all over the field. Threw the ball, protected it good, man, great night for us up front for sure.âDavis also said it could have and should have been even better.âWhat was the final score? 20-13?â asked Davis. âIt should have been 40-13. We just shot ourselves in the foot so many times in the red zone. Moving forward playing Albama, we canât do that.âWith Minceyâs status against the Tide unclear, Davis could earn the start Saturday where he earned his first start two years ago. Davis started three games at right tackle and played in all 13 games in the 2021 season and played in all 13 games in 2022 as a reserve offensive tackle.Against A&M, Davis saw action on a season-high 32 snaps without allowing any sacks, hits or pressures from the Aggies vaunted defensive front.Davis was elated and emotional after the victory.âEast Tennessee kids, you know, take pride in the Orange,â said Davis. âAnytime we get to step on that field weâve got to go 100%. Itâs so fun playing here, Godâs blessed me with a lot and Iâve been fortunate to do the things Iâm doing.âIt just feels good. Putting all the work into it. Man, Iâve put so much work into this the last five years. Coming in having so much to learn, itâs been a roller coaster to learn all this stuff and put in so much work. And finally see it pay off, itâs emotional. âI was going crazy after the game. The first people I could think about was my family. Theyâve done everything to get me here.â\n\nComplete Story\n\nOld School Volunteers Take Down Aggies\n\nTennessee proved old school football still wins SEC football games Saturday afternoon.Rushing for 232 yards against the leagueâs top-rated run defense, holding Texas A&M to just 54 net yards and scoring the gameâs go-ahead touchdown on a punt return, Tennessee defeated the Aggies, 20-13, at sold out and checkered Neyland Stadium.âHow about that?!,â beamed Volunteer head coach Josh Heupel. âWow, I havenât been involved in one like that in a long time. And Iâm good with it.âOn a day when former Volunteer safety Eric Berry was honored for his induction into the College Football Hall of Fame, Texas A&M scored a touchdown on its opening possession but never found the checkerboards again the rest of the day.âFitting on a day that Eric Berry is recognized, that we have the type of defensive performance that we did,â said Heupel. The Aggiesâ scoring drive netted 80 yards, but the Texas A&M defense totaled just 197 more and two field goals thereafter. âAfter the first drive, the defense played really dialed in football,â added Heupel. âGap integrity in the run game, got after the quarterback and a good mixture of our coverages. We were in the right place at the right time. âThey hit a couple play actions, but all in all just the physicality, the effort, the strength and playing smart football. You put that together and itâs a great performance by those guys today.âQuarterback Max Johnson was left battered and bruised, officially sacked twice, hurried 11 times and hit that many times and more.âDefensively, the line of scrimmage was relentless, we dominated it,â continued Heupel. âDid a great job on the second and third levels as well.âThe Aggie run defense came in allowing only 84 yards per game and just a week ago limited Alabama to just 24 yards on the ground. But the Vols averaged 4.7 yards per carry on 49 attempts.âReally good efficiency in the run game against a really good defensive line,â Heupel said. âProtected relatively well for most of the night.âJaylen Wright led the way with 136 yards on 19 attempts. Jabari Small rushed 12 times for 42 yards and Dylan Sampson nine times for 25 yards. Quarterback Joe Milton finished with 34 yards on eight keepers.âWe feed off each other because weâre brothers,â said Wright. âJust like I said before the season started and I continue to say, we are the best running back room in the country.âWright also complimented the Volunteer offensive line of Gerald Mincey, Cooper Mays, John Campbell, Javontez Spraggins and Ollie Lane along with Bluff Cityâs Dayne Davis, who entered at right tackle when Mincey went out early in the third period.âConfidence was a big thing today and preparation,â added Wright. âI want to thank my o-line for opening up seams and standing blocks. They are a very good d-line. We just had a day today.âTennessee answered A&Mâs first quarter score when Milton hit tight end Jacob Warren from seven yards out. It would also been the Volunteersâ only offensive touchdown.Texas A&Mâs Randy Bond booted a 41-yard field goal with 5:56 left in the second period to take a 10-7 lead.A pair of plays by Tennesseeâs special teams turned the game midway through third period. First, a 49-yard punt by Jackson Ross was down by a tight-roping Dee Williams at the Aggie one. âAfter I caught the ball, I looked down to see where my feet were,â said Williams. âI just saw the ref and that it was down at the one. And I was like, oh well.âAfter Texas A&M failed to gain a yard on three snaps, Williams took an ensuing A&M punt back 39 yards to give Tennessee the lead.âDee does a great job making a play, but you got ten guys competing their butts off to get him in the end zone,â noted Heupel. âOffensively, we had gotten the ball on the plus side of it and hadnât gotten anything out of it, so a huge turning point in the ball game.âMilton finished 11-for-22 for 100 yards and with an early fourth quarter touchdown in the end zone with Tennessee poised to extend a 14-13 lead. Josh DeBerry brought the pick out of the end zone, but was taken down in the open field by Davis at the Aggie 16.âDecision in the red zone, just canât make that one,â said Heupel. âThat was a critical error by him.âTexas A&M drove to the Volunteer 33 but Bondâs 50-yard go-attempt was wide left. The Volunteers offense then marched to the Aggie 14 before settling for a Chase Campbell 31-yard boot for a 17-13 lead with 3:46 to play.Three plays later, Gabe Jeudy-Lally picked off a Johnson pass and returned to the Aggie six. But after a five-yard false start penalty on first down the Volunteers couldnât punch in the game-clinching touchdown and had to settle for another Campbell field for a seven-point lead.âHave to play smarter in the red zone,â Heupel said. âJust absolutely crushed ourselves in that part of the field. Have to get better there.âThe defense came through again as Kamal Hadden intercepted Johnson at the Tennessee 45.Johnson completed 16-of-34 passes on the day for 223 yards. But the Texas A&M offense only netted 54 yards on the ground.Aaron Beasley and Elijah Herring led the Volunteers with five tackles apiece. James Pearce had two tackles for loss, one quarterback sack and five quarterback pressures.Tennessee travels to Alabama next for the annual Third Saturday in October meeting with the Tide. Kickoff from Bryant-Denny Stadium is set for 3:30 p.m.GAME NOTES â¦ Tennessee ran its consecutive winning streak to 13 games with the win while the loss was the eight straight on the road for Texas A&M â¦ The victory was also the first-ever for the Volunteers over the Aggies at Neyland Stadium.
