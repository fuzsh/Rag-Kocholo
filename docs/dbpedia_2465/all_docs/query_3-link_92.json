        "text": "The Indiana Pacers have too many players. Literally. They have to get rid of some people soon.\n\nThe Warriors get in touch with John Canzano to say Baron Davis is absolutely not on the trading block. Canzano doesn't believe them.\n\nYou know those summer pickup games in Houston that have had NBA stars in them forever? Used to be the big names were guys like Sam Cassell and Clyde Drexler. Now young whipper-snappers like T.J. Ford, Gerald Green, and Glen \"Big Baby\" Davis, and Royal Ivey are taking over.\n\nJason Williams is recovering from surgery--which reportedly could take a while--which means the defending champions need a point guard. Ira Winderman says they had their eye on Jannero Pargo but he apparently prefers to play overseas. I'm telling you, Euroleague and the NBA are competing hardcore for talent. It's like the ABA vs. the NBA days.\n\nJ.A. Adande on UCLA recruit, and Oregonian, Kevin Love: \"Frank Burlison has chronicled college and prep hoops for a long time, long enough not to get caught up in each and every 'next thing.' But he says Love will make the Bruins Final Four material and that he already has better low-post moves than most NBA centers.\"\n\nIsiah Thomas and Andy Miller are using every trick in the book to pry Jared Jeffries from Washington. Burning bridges by saying publicly he doesn't want to be in Washington is only the beginning. They also structured the free agent offer sheet so that it will get the Wizards dangerously close to luxury tax territory. Why go to so much trouble? What's so great about playing for the Knicks? Frank Isola says Jeffries has known Isiah Thomas since he was 12. The Wizards have until Monday to match the offer or lose Jeffries, and Ernur Grunfeld says he'll use the whole week to make up his mind\n\nEuropean basketball nets that make a delicate fashion statement."
