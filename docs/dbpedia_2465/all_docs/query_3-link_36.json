        "text": "Men's Golf 4/22/2020 9:06:00 PM\n\nAlex Price and Kevin Quinto Earn Honorable Mention GCAA PING All-America Honors\n\nNORMAN, Okla. -- Becoming the 11th and 12th All-Americans in program history, Christopher Newport men's golfers Alex Price and Kevin Quinto hauled in honorable mention GCAA plaudits on Wednesday afternoon in an announcement made by the coaches association. The 2020 Division III PING All-America honors were announced on the Golf Coaches Association of America (GCAA) website a week after the Captains' duo were selected as All-Mid-Atlantic Region honors.\n\nPrice continues to set a new standard of success for first year players at Christopher Newport as he becomes just the second rookie to earn All-America recognition after a record-setting pace in his first season with the Captains. He joins Scott Causby as the only freshman to collect an All-American certificate; Causby was a second team pick following his rookie campaign in 1994-95.\n\nQuinto joins Price on the All-America team marking just the fourth time in program history that Christopher Newport earned multiple All-American recognitions in the same season. The two Christopher Newport players were among 29 honorable mention All-American picks in Division III following the truncated 2019-20 season.\n\nA native of Hillsboro, Va., Alex Price put together inarguably one of the finest freshmen campaigns in the history of the Captains' program. The rookie played in three of the four tournaments for CNU this season and finished in the top-five on the individual leaderboard twice. He finished at par or better in all three of his collegiate tournament appearances and signed for the finest round, in relation to par, by a freshman since 2009 when he carded a 68 (-4) in his last tournament of 2019-20.\n\nPrice recorded a 71.4 stroke average in seven rounds of action between the Don Scalf Memorial, VSGA Intercollegiate, and The Savannah Invitational. He finished at or below par in five of his seven completed rounds during his first season. His average was more than a stroke lower than the program record for a single season set by David Rabil in 2016-17 (72.7).\n\nQuinto also played in three of the four tournaments for the Captains in his third season and posted a terrific 72.8 average. In six rounds of play, the Pittsfield, Mass. native carded no worse than a 77 and boasted matching 70's to set a season-best round of two-under par in the Don Scalf Memorial and again in the VSGA Intercollegiate.\n\nWith a 36-hole performance of three-over with a 145 (72-73) in the Greene Turtle Invitational, Quinto tied for second out of 78 players. He then tied for 11th at the Don Scalf and tied for 8th out of 93 players at the VSGA Intercollegiate. Coming into the year, Quinto had a career average of 78.3 and the junior lowered that mark by over a full stroke with his impressive third year campaign.\n\nChristopher Newport logged three top-five finishes and one team victory in their four tournaments played in 2019-20. Led by the two All-American performers, the Captains posted a 295.6 stroke average as a team for a record-breaking pace before the remainder of the season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n2019-20 Division III PING All-America Teams\n\nFirst Team\n\nElias Haavisto, Averett\n\nEmmet Herb, St. Thomas (MN)\n\nWill Hocker, Webster\n\nJason Li, Carnegie Mellon\n\nDrew Mathers, Huntingdon\n\nJames Mishoe Guilford\n\nJimmy Morton, Illinois Wesleyan\n\nCade Osgood, Southwestern (TX)\n\nRob Wuethrich, Illinois Wesleyan\n\nSecond Team\n\nAndrew Abel, Illinois Wesleyan\n\nZane Brownrigg, Methodist\n\nMason Koch, George Fox\n\nHunter Martin, Hampden-Sydney\n\nRyan Quinn, RPI\n\nLogan Ryan, Emory\n\nMax Schwarz, Emory\n\nCameron Willis, Huntingdon\n\nBen Womack, LaGrange\n\nThird Team\n\nChris Bornhorst, Babson\n\nNicholas Gianelos, Babson\n\nSam Goldenring, Williams\n\nRaymond Li, Carnegie Mellon\n\nMatthew Leemann, Piedmont\n\nMarc Mitchell, Denison\n\nDaniel Nunez, Trinity (TX)\n\nMatt Organisak, Emory\n\nBrian Peccie, Washington & Lee\n\nHonorable Mention\n\nBen Balen Concordia (TX)\n\nJared Beals, Pacific Lutheran\n\nJoseph Burlison, NYU\n\nOwen Burt, Huntingdon\n\nScott Campbell, Greensboro\n\nAndre Chi, Methodist\n\nChris Dunne, Wittenberg\n\nChristian Early, Denison\n\nJohn Hatcher Ferguson, Hampden-Sydney\n\nJason Folker, Carnegie Mellon\n\nJack Habeeb, Hamilton\n\nReilly Hegarty, Whitworth\n\nCole Jahnke, Wisconsin-Eau Claire\n\nKen Kong, Claremont-Mudd-Scripps\n\nSkyler LeVine, Illinois Wesleyan\n\nLuis Legaretta, Jr. Mary Hardin-Baylor\n\nRicardo Paes Leme, Trinity (CT)\n\nBrendon Lowrance, McMurry\n\nKenny Park, Oglethorpe\n\nJacob Pederson, Gustavus Adolphus\n\nJeffrey Perry, California Lutheran\n\nAlex Price, Christopher Newport\n\nKevin Quinto, Christopher Newport\n\nLane Roye, McMurry\n\nFrankie Schmitt, NC Wesleyan\n\nDavid Schneider, Saint John's (MN)\n\nCarson Whitton, Huntingdon\n\nEdward Wu, Claremont-Mudd-Scripps\n\nEric Yiu, Emory\n\nPlayers Mentioned"
