EMC Corp.’s content management software division, Documentum Inc., has purchased Xerox Corp.’s askOnce technology for integrating content from disparate data sources. Terms of the deal, announced Tuesday, were not disclosed.

Documentum disclosed the acquisition in its announcement of a forthcoming product for cross-repository content management. Documentum’s Virtual Repository, scheduled for release early in the second quarter, is intended to link structured and unstructured content from internal corporate applications and external resources, such as Web sites, allowing users to centralize data aggregation, classification and distribution. Documentum’s newly acquired askOnce technology enables the Virtual Repository’s integration capabilities, the company said.

AskOnce was developed at a Xerox research center in Grenoble, France. Documentum said it has established an engineering office in Grenoble and will continue developing askOnce there.
