Surely get in touch with you if any assistance is required.\n\nI have gone through your blog and your profile looks amazing. Hats off to you.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nKedar\n\nEdited by: Kedar Malekar on Jul 20, 2010 12:04 PM\n\nHi Sachin,\n\nWe have an urgent requirement from client regarding SAP Integration with Documentum. It would be great if you could throw some light on this I have gone through many websites I didnâ€™t find any information.\n\nMy client would like to have a demo on Integration with Documentum Can we achieve this in Standard SAP or do we need to install any software or purchase license from SAP to do necessary configuration\n\nPlease let me know\n\nI have already initiated that process. Before getting response from them, I want to understand the steps and prerequisites. Form the same, fired this query. I have also raised an OSS message. This is what they have to say.\n\nWe need to have Netweaver Process Integration solution. They have shared one PDF file also. Let me know if I can attach it in my thread. So that I can share it with you guys.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nKedar"
