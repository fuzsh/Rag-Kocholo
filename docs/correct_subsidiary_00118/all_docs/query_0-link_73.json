        "text": "Hopkinton, MA/PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- News Highlights:\n\nEMC Captiva Cloud Toolkit transforms web-based scanning support by eliminating browser and plug-in limitations\n\nEnables developers to rapidly add scanning functionality to web-based applications through industry standards\n\nReduces overall cost of supporting distributed capture applications by simplifying deployment, providing wide compatibility, and reducing ongoing maintenance costs\n\nFast adoption from scanner manufacturers and wide support for browsers and development platforms ensures \"out of the box\" support\n\nFull Story:\n\nEMC Corporation EMC today announced strong adoption of its EMC Captiva Cloud Toolkit. The toolkit transforms web-based scanning by providing a simple way for developers to add scanning functionality to web applications, enabling scanning from all document scanners and multifunction peripherals (MFP) that support the ISIS and TWAIN standards.\n\nSince its release at the end of 2011, hardware manufacturers and software developers are already leveraging EMC Captiva Cloud Toolkit. Major scanner and MFP manufacturers, including Avision, Brother, Canon, Epson, Fujitsu, HP, Kodak, Panasonic, Plustek and Visioneer, are shipping scanners supporting these new scan-enabled web applications.\n\nThe Captiva Cloud Toolkit provides broad support for web browsers and web development platforms, significantly reducing the barriers to acquiring physical documents into web- or cloud-based applications and business processes. Web-based business applications that utilize the toolkit work with all standard web browser platforms, including Windows Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, and Google Chrome, and require no additional software to run, such as ActiveX or other browser plug-ins. With Captiva Cloud Toolkit, developers can quickly create working, scan-enabled, web-based business applications compatible with existing corporate web browsers and development environments, including HTML5, Microsoft Silverlight, JavaScript, and Adobe Flash.\n\nDevelopers wishing to evaluate Captiva Cloud Toolkit may download a free trial of the software development kit at www.emc.com/cloudtoolkit .\n\nPartner Quotes:\n\nSam Yoshida, Vice President, Marketing, Business Imaging Solutions, Canon U.S.A.\n\n\"Combining Canon's high-quality imageFORMULA scanner technology and the EMC Captiva Cloud Toolkit provide our customers with an advanced imaging capture solution that allows users to seamlessly scan documents to web-based applications without the hassle of downloading additional software.\"\n\nYuki Uchida, Vice President, New Business Development, Ricoh Americas Corporation\n\n\"We have had a long-lasting partnership with EMC, Documentum and Captiva scanning technologies, and with this new Captiva Cloud Toolkit we take a major next step.
