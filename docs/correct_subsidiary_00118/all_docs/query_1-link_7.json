        "text": "Computer storage business\n\nFor the locomotive manufacturer formerly known as EMC, see Electro-Motive Diesel.\n\nDell EMC (EMC Corporation until 2016) is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Hopkinton, Massachusetts,[2] and Round Rock, Texas, United States. Dell EMC sells data storage, information security, virtualization, analytics, cloud computing and other products and services that enable organizations to store, manage, protect, and analyze data. Dell EMC's target markets include large companies and small- and medium-sized businesses across various vertical markets.[3][4] The company's stock (as EMC Corporation) was added to the New York Stock Exchange on April 6, 1986,[5] and was also listed on the S&P 500 index.\n\nEMC was acquired by Dell in 2016. At that time, Forbes noted EMC's \"focus on developing and selling data storage and data management hardware and software and convincing its customers to buy its products independent of their other IT buying decisions\" based on \"best-of-breed.\"[6] It was later renamed to Dell EMC. Dell uses the EMC name with some of its products.[7]\n\nEMC acquired Iomega in 2008,[8] and a 2013 partnership with Lenovo resulted in the rebranding of Iomega as LenovoEMC.[9] The joint venture was dissolved due to the acquisition of EMC by Dell.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nEMC, founded in 1979 by Richard Egan and Roger Marino (the E and M of EMC),[10] introduced its first 64-kilobyte (65,536 bytes) memory boards for the Prime Computer in 1981.[11][12] EMC continued to develop memory boards for other computer types. In the mid-1980s, the company expanded beyond memory to other computer data storage types and networked storage platforms. EMC began shipping its flagship product, the Symmetrix, in 1990.[citation needed]\n\nWhile some of EMC's growth is credited to acquisitions of smaller companies,[13] Symmetrix was the main factor in EMC's rapid growth during the 1990s, from a firm valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars to a multi-billion dollar company.[14]\n\nIn 2009 EMC signed a two-year deal to be the principal shirt sponsor for English Rugby Union club London Wasps[15] in a deal worth £1 Million. This was later extended until the end of the 2013 season.[citation needed]\n\nMichael Ruettgers joined EMC in 1988 and served as CEO from 1992 until January 2001.[16] Under Ruettgers' leadership, EMC revenues grew from $120 million to nearly $9 billion 10 years later, and the company shifted its focus from memory boards to storage systems.[17] Ruettgers was named one of BusinessWeek's \"World's Top 25 Executives\"; one of the \"Best Chief Executive Officers in America\" by Worth magazine; and one of Network World's \"25 Most Powerful People in Networking\".[17]\n\nAhead of their acquisition by Dell, EMC gained a reputation for oppressive non-compete agreements and non-compete lobbying through AIM (Associated Industries of Massachusetts)[18][19]\n\nAcquisition by Dell\n\n[edit]\n\nOn October 12, 2015, Dell Inc. announced its intent to acquire EMC in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $67 billion, which as of 2021 remains the largest-ever acquisition in the technology sector.[20] The combination of Dell's enterprise server, personal computer, and mobile businesses with EMC's enterprise storage business was a significant vertical merger of IT giants. Dell offered $24.05 per share of EMC, and $9.05 per share of tracking stock in VMware.[21][22][23]\n\nOn September 7, 2016, Dell Inc. completed the merger, which involved the issuance of $45.9 billion in debt and $4.4 billion common stock.[24][25] At the time, some analysts claimed that Dell's acquisition of the former Iomega could harm the LenovoEMC partnership.[26]\n\nProducts and services\n\n[edit]\n\nIn addition to those of the majority-owned Pivotal company, Dell EMC sells products and services, including products from other Dell Technologies companies, designed to allow IT departments to move to a cloud computing model and to analyze big data. LenovoEMC, formerly Iomega, sells storage products.[9]\n\nProduct category Products/Services Information Storage PowerMax, VMAX Family, VNX/VNXe Family, Isilon, Atmos, XtremIO, ScaleIO, Unity/Unity XT Family, PowerStore, Objectscale, ECS Archiving, Backup, and Recovery Avamar, DataDomain, NetWorker, RecoverPoint, Centera, SourceOne Storage and Content Management Service Assurance Suite, Appsync, PowerPath, ViPR SRM, ViPR Controller Virtualization VMware, VPLEX Services Consulting, Customer support, Education Services, Managed Services, Technology Services and Solutions Security/Compliance RSA Security, Dell SecureWorks Cloud computing/Converged Infrastructure VxBlock, VxRack, VxRail, VSPEX, Virtustream Data Computing Greenplum, Pivotal\n\nMajor acquisitions\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following table includes the listing and timeline of EMC Corporation's major acquisitions of other companies since 1996.\n\nYear Storage Storage & management software Content management Virtualization Services Security/compliance Cloud computing Data computing 1996–2000 Data General,[27] CrosStor[28] Softworks,[29] Avalon[30] 2001–2005 FilePool,[31] Allocity[32] Luminate,[33] Prisa Networks,[34] Legato Networker,[35] Dantz/Retrospect,[36] Smarts Astrum[37][38] Documentum,[39] Ask Once,[40] Acartus,[41] Captiva Software[42] VMware[43] Rainfinity,[44] Acxiom[45] Internosis[46] 2006–2010 Avamar,[47] Iomega,[48] Data Domain,[49] Isilon Systems[50] Bus-Tech,[51] Indigo Stone[52] Kashya,[53] nLayers,[54] Voyence,[55] Infra Corporation,[56] WysDM,[57] Configuresoft,[58] Fastscale[59] Pro Activity,[60] X-Hive,[61] Dokumentum, Document Sciences,[62] Kazeon[63] Akimbi,[64] YottaYotta Interlink,[65] Geniant,[66] Business Edge,[67] Conchango[68] RSA Security,[69] Authentica,[70] Network Intelligence,[71] Valyd,[72] Verid,[73] Tablus,[74] Archer Technologies[75] Mozy,[76] Pi,[77] Source Labs[78] Greenplum[79] 2011–present XtremIO,[80] Likewise[81] ScaleIO[82] Watch4Net,[83] iWave,[84] TwinStrata[85] Syncplicity[86](spun off in 2015)[87] Syncplicity[86](spun off in 2015),[87] Trinity Technologies[88] Asankya Netwitness,[90] Silicium Security,[91] Silver Tail Systems[92] Aveksa Virtustream[93] ZettaPoint,[94] Pivotal Labs,[95] MoreVRP[96]\n\nBig data projects\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2012, EMC sponsored The Human Face of Big Data,[97] a globally crowdsourced media project focusing on the ability to collect, analyze, triangulate and visualize vast amounts of data in real-time. The Human Face of Big Data, produced by Rick Smolan and Jennifer Erwitt, includes \"a number of fascinating stories ... [that] represent some of the most innovative applications of data that are shaping our future\".[98]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nConnectrix\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
