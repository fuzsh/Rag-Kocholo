        "text": "The EMC Corporation took a significant step to broaden its business yesterday with the purchase of VMware for $635 million in cash. The purchase of VMware, analysts say, is part of the shift under way at EMC to become less dependent on data storage systems and to expand further into software as price pressures steadily erode the profitability of computer hardware. The company has already made two software acquisitions in the second half of this year, spending $2.9 billion on the two all-stock deals. But Legato Systems, a maker of data backup and recovery software, and Documentum, whose software is used to manage all kinds of digital documents, are closely related to EMC's core business of data storage. VMware is more of a departure. The private company, based in Palo Alto, Calif., makes software that allows a computer to run different operating systems at the same time, or several versions of the same operating system. This kind of software, known as a virtual machine, has been used since the 1960's on mainframe computers. But VMware's technology is tailored for lower-cost machines powered by chips from Intel or Advanced Micro Devices, running Microsoft's Windows or Linux, an operating system distributed free. Such low-cost server computers are increasingly common in corporate data centers, and VMware's software increases their efficiency, yielding further cost savings. The VMware purchase moves EMC into the market for server software at the heart of the data center. \"This represents a recognition by EMC that it needs to move into the mainstream of the data center instead of just trying to sell storage systems into it,\" said Galen Schreck, an analyst at Forrester Research. Strategically, the VMware purchase is somewhat different from EMC's previous acquisitions, said Joseph M. Tucci, the chief executive. But the deal, he said in an interview, is part of his company's move to increase its software and services businesses and become less reliant on hardware. After Legato, Documentum and VMware are brought into the fold, Mr. Tucci said, EMC will derive more than half of its revenue from software and services. \"We've made a pretty big turn,\" he said. Just how far EMC, which is based in Hopkinton, Mass., can extend its reach into data-center computing is uncertain. Its goal is to use virtualization software to make servers and storage systems work more smoothly and efficiently. But analysts say that in pursuing that strategy, EMC will confront larger companies with long experience and large services divisions, like Hewlett-Packard and especially I.B.M. The services capability, they add, can be crucial for solving the complex computing problems that large companies increasingly encounter these days. \"EMC has spent a lot of money on good technology, but it still doesn't have anything like I.B.M.'s services arm,\" said Peter Gerr, an analyst for the Enterprise Storage Group, a research firm. Still, as Mr. Gerr noted, picking up VMware is \"a real coup for EMC.\" Indeed, VMware is a leader in a technology that is regarded as an important building block in making computing a more flexible and easily managed pay-as-you-go utility. Its industry partners include I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard and others. The company, with 370 people, will have revenues of nearly $100 million this year, and it has been profitable for nearly two years. It has been a magnet for skilled computer scientists. VMware was seen as a prime candidate among Silicon Valley start-ups to command a hefty price tag in a public offering of its shares. But Diane Greene, the chief executive, noted that VMware was regarded by venture capitalists as \"an old-fashioned software company\" when it started in the late 1990's, during the bubble years. It raised almost no venture financing, so its founders, not venture capitalists, were free to determine the best route forward. The EMC deal, Ms. Greene said, seemed to be the best way to give VMware the additional resources it needed for rapid growth with the fewest conflicts that might hamper the business. Other companies were interested in VMware, including I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard. Last year, Microsoft made an offer for VMware, but the Silicon Valley company turned it down, partly out of concern that Microsoft would make VMware a Windows-only product, Ms. Greene said. Ms. Greene would not comment on other offers. But I.B.M. sells both server computers and operating system software, and Hewlett-Packard is a leading producer of server computers. The purpose of virtualization software like VMware's offering is to be a layer that eliminates the tight bond between hardware and software. \"There was less potential conflict with us,\" Mr. Tucci said. \"We're not going to get into the operating systems business, and we're not going to get into the server computer business.\""
