        "text": "ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Reveille Software, the leading provider of management and monitoring solutions for enterprise content management (ECM) applications today announced support for the EMC® InfoArchive™ 4.0 platform and EMC Documentum® D2 4.6 client.\n\n“Reveille customers have highly complex and critical enterprise content management environments that require and benefit from the latest innovations out of EMC,” said Sean Allen, vice president of marketing at Reveille Software. “These organizations count on us for pure, instant and in-depth visibility and intelligence of their content services, underscoring why we push to remain in lock-step with new releases.”\n\nWith the InfoArchive 4.0 platform release, announced at EMC World, customers gain enhanced user experience, reduced total cost of ownership, and REST API integration options. Reveille’s support for this release ensures that active archiving and application decommissioning processes remain operating at peak performance. Reveille delivers more than 40 out-of-the-box tests and metrics for monitoring and managing the ingestion and access of multiple data types for the InfoArchive platform, providing necessary insight into who is accessing archive records and ensuring performance of InfoArchive-based solutions.\n\nThe Documentum D2 4.6 client release, announced in March, is a combination of user experience and extensibility improvements. Reveille’s real-time, actual user experience monitoring can be applied to this release to ensure individual user transactions, such as check in and check out, are performed at optimal speeds. Customers leveraging Reveille’s end-to-end performance visibility can assess performance of individual transactions through each of the Documentum platform tiers, including the Documentum Foundation Classes (DFC) and SQL server transactions.\n\n“The EMC/Reveille relationship has been going strong for more than five years due to the mutual commitment to meeting our customers’ needs through advanced features and functionality,” said Jim Nelson, Global Leader Enterprise Content Division Partner Business, EMC Corporation. “Reveille recognizes the dynamic and complex nature of content services, and consistently rises to the challenge of ensuring currency with the ECD product releases to enable our customers get the most out of their ECM investments.”\n\nReveille uniquely provides an end-end management view of the EMC Documentum product family – from archiving (the EMC InfoArchive platform) to capture (EMC Captiva® software), transaction processing (the EMC Documentum xCP tool), client applications (the EMC Documentum D2 client), and customer communications (EMC Document Sciences® xPression® software). All solutions carry the EMC Certified Solution designation.\n\nReveille is currently exhibiting at EMC World, booth 911, from May 2-5, 2016.\n\nAbout Reveille Software\n\nReveille Software™ enables clients to manage business critical content by helping IT find issues first and fix them fast.
