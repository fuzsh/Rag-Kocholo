        "text": "EMC World/Momentum 2015 Quick Hits\n\nMay 11, 2015\n\nIt was a busy week at EMC World/Momentum 2015 and it may take me a little while to digest it all. However, here are a couple of quick notes I think you will find interesting:\n\nLook for the core Documentum platform to be certified on CentOS and Postgres later this summer, for non-production use. This is essentially the Documentum Developer Edition, but certification now means support for this platform. It will be interesting to see if D2 can be installed on the this combination of OS and DB. See here for reasons why it doesn’t work on the Developer Edition (search the page for “42601”). D2 does work on CentOS and Postgres, but you have to install it like this.\n\nDocumentum and Docker got a lot of air time this week, partly because it’s really cool, and partly because it ties into ECD’s new Project Horizon vision (see below). Docker is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers, by providing an additional layer of abstraction and automation of operating-system-level virtualization on Linux. I saw a demo this week where Docker was used to deploy Documentum, Oracle XE, Tomcat, and DA on a new image in 30 Sec. This could revolutionize deployment and support of Documentum. This demo code should be available on the EDN shortly. See some preliminary xCP Docker efforts here.\n\nA new Spring Data API was announced also. Spring Data is an umbrella framework for easy data access. The goal of the documentum Spring Data API is to significantly reduce the amount of boilerplate code needed to implement data access layers. At Momentum, a custom JSP client was demonstrated written using Spring Data as the API to the Content Server; it looked nice and was fast. The Spring Data API has full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) capabilities but lacks workflow and lifecycles. This API will be released as open source in the Fall 2015 to encourage users, partners, and developers to help build it out further. It is solidly based on the DFC. This code too should be on the EDN shortly.\n\nThere was a lot of discussion about RESTful APIs, including D2FS “D2 REST”) and RM. With the D2FS REST web services (expected end of year with “Falcon” release of D2), it will be possible to build a “D2” application that uses on the API and not the framework. Interesting.\n\nProject Horizon also got a lot of air time this week, I think every Momentum session I attended at least paid homage to it if not tied specifically to this new effort. My understanding of Project Horizon is that it is the next generation ECM platform and marketplace. The project is all about micro-apps and micro-services (this is where Docker comes in) build on the Pivotal Cloud Foundry. Project Horizon projects will be composed of micro apps/services deployed in Docker, giving incredible flexibility for collaboration, composition, and continuous update and deployment. Stay tuned, I’m sure we will be hearing much more about Project Horizon in the coming months/years.\n\nTSG always does a great job summarizing the event, I encourage you to see their blog posts for more analysis. Additionally, you can follow the #EMCWorld and #MMTM15 hashtags on Twitter. Storify also has some fun pics and tweets.\n\nUPDATE: Here is a good discussion of Project Horizon from TSG.\n\nUPDATE: Here is the application to get involved with the Project Horizon Co-Innovation Program.\n\nUPDATE: Another compilation of the days’ events\n\nUPDATE: A more detailed discussion of Project Horizon and ECD’s future plans.\n\nUPDATE: Project Horizon landing page.\n\nNews from EMC World 2014\n\nMay 12, 2014\n\nThough I didn’t attend this year, I did my best to stay abreast of the highlights from EMC World and Momentum 2014 via Twitter and blogs. Here are a few that I followed:\n\nTSG – Technology Services Group always does a stellar job blogging EMC World and offering predictions, wrap ups, and analytics.\n\nLee Dallas – Big Men On Content has an insightful post.\n\nEMC Spark blog – wrap up post with more links\n\nEMC Corp’s Storify blog – corporate recaps and party pictures\n\nFacebook photo album– the week in pictures\n\nEMCtv – video of Super Sessions\n\nEMC World vPass\n\nCrawford Technologies – Reflections on EMC World and Momentum 2014\n\nInformed Consulting – The Final View\n\nObserving Content Management blog – EMC world 2014 Post Conference Thoughts\n\nYouTube – Momentum at EMC World\n\nOf course, EMC and attendees spewed out so many Tweets they were too numerous to follow. If you’d like to review them, you can find them here:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/search?q=%23EMCWORLD&src=tyah\n\nhttps://twitter.com/search?q=%23MMTM14&src=tyah\n\nOne of the most exciting bits of news I heard was that in coming months, we can expect two new Documentum Developer Editions:\n\nD2 – May 30, 2014\n\nxCP – June 30, 2014 (with a Linux port of CTS)\n\nSee the evidence here.\n\nIf you know of other good sources for recaps of the events at EMC World, let me know in the comments. Thanks.\n\nEMC World 2013 Blogs\n\nMay 19, 2013\n\nEMC World 2013 has come and gone, and I, unfortunately, did not get to attend this year. Like many of you, I have kept up to date by reading blogs by those that did attend. The best blog I found covering EMC World 2013 is TSG‘s. They have done a stellar job (as they have in year’s past) keeping everyone who did not attend — and probably those who did attend — well-informed. I encourage you to check out their summary of the entire event here.\n\nAny other good blogs reporting on the event? Let me know!"
