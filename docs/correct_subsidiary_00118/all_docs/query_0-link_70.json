        "text": "Cambridge, UK – 2 March 2015: AVEVA announced today that it has collaborated with EMC Corporation’s Enterprise Content Division to deliver an integrated software solution for the management and control of engineering data and associated documents. Designed for the specific needs of Owner Operators (OOs) and Engineering, Procurement, Construction companies (EPCs) in the plant and power markets, the integration will provide increased efficiency and information accuracy to support safe and compliant capital project execution and asset operations.\n\n‘By combining two best-in-class product suites into a single solution, AVEVA and EMC are delivering a set of capabilities that provides truly comprehensive decision making,’ said Derek Middlemas, COO and Head of Enterprise Solutions, AVEVA. ‘This supports all business processes in capital projects and asset operations where the requirement for high integrity documents and associated engineering data to maintain safety and compliance is vital.’\n\nWith equal strength in data management and document control, this unrivalled solution is enabled by a seamless bi-directional interface between AVEVA NET based Digital Information Hub (DIH) solutions and the EMC® Documentum® Engineering, Plant and Facilities Management (EPFM) solution suite. This comprehensive solution creates, captures, reviews, edits and publishes documents and associated engineering data through a controlled and auditable process.\n\n‘Effective management and control of asset information is critical to the success of major capital projects and efficient asset operations,’ said Chris McLaughlin, CMO, EMC Enterprise Content Division. ‘By bringing together AVEVA NET and the EMC Documentum EPFM solution suite, OOs and EPCs can quickly relate data and document information, empowering customers to gain new levels of efficiency without compromising safety and compliance.’\n\nBased on years of experience in the energy and engineering industries, Documentum EPFM solution suite was specifically designed to address information management challenges throughout the project, plant or asset lifecycle – from design and construction of new facilities, to operations and maintenance and eventual decommission. The solution suite combines industry best practices with the enterprise-level capabilities of EMC Documentum, and an architecture that enables tight integration with existing systems.\n\nMr Middlemas added, ‘The business benefits that result from being able to effectively manage engineering data and associated documents from multiple sources are well known. This partnership means OOs and EPCs no longer have to select separate vendor solutions or rely on a less capable product from a single supplier.’"
