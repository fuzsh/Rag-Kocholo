        "text": "EMC has been one of the best kept secrets in tech. Even in the 1990s, when it was the second most successful stock on Wall Street, just behind Dell, it has remained relatively unknown.\n\nStill, it had a profound impact on the IT industry, for a while making enterprise data big with its exclusive focus on developing and selling data storage and data management hardware and software and convincing its customers to buy its products independent of their other IT buying decisions. In doing so, it has joined a handful of other “best-of-breed” vendors driving the restructuring during the 1990s of an IT industry previously dominated by a few vertically integrated, “one-stop-shopping” vendors.\n\nThen data became really big and started eating the world, leading to the rise of digital natives (especially Google, Amazon and Facebook) and another restructuring of the IT industry, and another shift in the nature of IT buying decisions and the type of IT buyers. In response to these changes, EMC has agreed to be acquired by Dell in the largest-ever tech merger.\n\nEMC was founded in August 1979 in Massachusetts and went through three distinct eras: The Dick Egan and Roger Marino era when it successfully developed and sold computer memory systems; the Moshe Yanai and Mike Ruettgers era, when it developed (Yanai) and sold (Ruettgers) high-end, disk-based computer storage systems (hardware and software); and the Joe Tucci era, continuing EMC’s tradition of focused execution and sales excellence, while relying mostly on a long string of acquisitions for innovation and diversification.\n\nAugust 23, 1979 43-year-old Dick Egan and 40-year-old Roger Marino quit their jobs and the former college roommates incorporate EMC in Massachusetts. Like other entrepreneurs they wanted to be their own bosses, but without an idea or a plan for a product, they initially sold office furniture.\n\n1980 Egan and Marino become New England representatives for Intel, selling the company’s product line and renting out microprocessor development systems. They also sell computer memory for DEC’s PDP-11 and other companies’ minicomputers.\n\n1981 On the suggestion of one of their customers, Egan, Marino and a handful of other engineers develop EMC’s first product, a Prime Computer minicomputer compatible memory, offering higher reliability and capacity at half the price of Prime’s comparable product.\n\n1983 EMC continues on the successful path of using Intel’s standard components to develop compatible solid state memory products for DEC VAX and Wang Laboratories minicomputers. Annual revenues: $6 million. Roger Marino, who is credited with developing EMC’s assertive sales force, knew where to find motivated recent college graduates who were also good team players: “I hired guys I liked. I like smart people. I like athletes. These guys that worked for me were smart athletes, and they went out and killed” (quoted in Boston magazine, November 2003).\n\nApril 1986 EMC goes public on Nasdaq, raising $30 million. Revenues for 1986 were $66.6 million (up from $33.3 million the year before) and income was $18.6 million (up from $7.5 million), with 400 employees.\n\nIn their letter to shareholders in EMC’s first annual report, Dick Egan and Roger Marino analyzed the shift in buying behavior and customer expectations driving EMC’s success:\n\n…the increased competition for new business has created an attitude of user independence that heretofore did not exist. The realization that the users are Customers with all the rights to which Customers are entitled has become widespread. One way the end users are exercising their rights is by demanding performance improvements at the lowest price from the best suppliers regardless of who manufactured the original processor. By treating end users like Customers and by making optimum use of new technology to provide better performance and reliability, EMC has become a valued supplier to over 10,000 computer users.\n\nAt EMC’s 25th anniversary celebration in 2004, Egan recounted how during a presentation to Wall Street analysts and investors before the EMC IPO, one not-too-friendly analyst asked: “As we know, all companies eventually go out of business. What is it that will cause EMC’s demise?” Said Egan (in 2004), “I confess I was not prepared for this. I had never ever really thought about it and, standing here today, I can’t see why I ever will!”\n\nAugust 1987 Dick Egan hires Moshe Yanai and gives him free reign to develop a mainframe disk storage system. Dave Vellante (then at IDC): “Moshe has made a number of key technical calls which flew in the face of conventional wisdom but were spot-on. The company would not be where it is today without Moshe” (quoted in the 1999 Radical Marketing, see below).\n\nIn a 1999 interview Dick Egan explained the decision to enter the disk storage market by pointing out that the “storage pyramid” is actually a diamond. The “pyramid” was the traditional way of segmenting the data storage market, with a small market—in terms of the total bytes of data storage—at the top, represented by high-cost memory providing fast access to data, and a large market with lots of bytes at the bottom represented by relatively inexpensive, slow-access tape. But he realized that one of the segments in the middle of the pyramid, represented by disk storage with a relatively high cost per megabyte was a much larger market in terms of potential revenues than the markets at the top and bottom of the pyramid. This market anomaly was mainly due to the dominance of IBM in the mainframe disk storage market resulting in disk storage at time selling for more than $10 per megabyte. With the right product, EMC could repeat the success it had in the plug-compatible memory market where it had enjoyed the price umbrella provided by mini-computer vendors selling their proprietary (and expensive) memory products.\n\nMarch 1988 EMC’s stock begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Egan told Upside in 1994: “I wanted to get on the New York Stock Exchange as soon as I could because the customers I was selling to all played on that board.”\n\nApril 1988 EMC opens a manufacturing plant in Cork, Ireland, to meet growing international demand.\n\n1988 EMC suffers its first annual loss ($7.8 million) when its first disk-based storage product for the IBM mainframe market repeatedly failed after it was installed. It took 18 months (and another loss of $18.5 million in 1989) before the problem was traced to disk drives that were shipped to EMC with specks of face powder (the assemblers were not properly trained) that caused them to fail randomly. In response, EMC institutes company-wide quality and continuous improvement programs and becomes ISO certified.\n\nSeptember 1990 EMC introduces Symmetrix Integrated Cached Disk Array, a mainframe computer storage device, combining an array of PC disks with large cache memory for fast access to data and high availability in a small footprint. Previously, storage had been an afterthought for mainframe makers—a passive container that came with a “Single Large Expensive Disk (SLED).” In 1991, the product comprised 38% of EMC’s annual revenues.\n\n1991 EMC eliminates many of its memory products, focusing on disk-based storage systems. Roger Marino to Upside in 1994: “At the time, I couldn’t understand why Egan would want to sell such a profitable line. But now I see it was superlative timing on Egan’s part.”\n\nDecember 1991 Revenues for 1991 increase 37% to $260 million and income grows 223% to $11 million.\n\nJanuary 1992 Mike Ruettgers becomes President and CEO.\n\nJanuary 1992 Capitalizing on the server-agnostic nature of the Symmetrix product line, EMC signs an OEM agreement with Unisys to supply it with compatible storage systems. A similar agreement was signed with France-based Groupe Bull in April 1993.\n\nSeptember 1993 EMC acquires Magna Computer, provider of tape storage for AS/400 computers and Epoch Systems, developer of storage management software.\n\nMay 1994 EMC announces Symmetrix 5500, the world’s first terabyte-sized storage system.\n\nMay 1994 Inc. magazine publishes “Opposite Attractions,” an in-depth profile of the winners of the 1994 Master EOY award, Ely Callaway of Callaway Golf and Dick Egan of EMC. David Whitford captured well Egan’s “alley fighter” personality and drive:\n\n\"There's got to be a they before there's a we,\" says Egan, paraphrasing somebody, he's not sure whom. There has always been a \"they\" -- Cifrino [the owner of the supermarket where Egan’s father worked as a meatcutter] and his son, the classy friends on the Cape, IBM -- always someone for Egan to set himself against, someone to fight and unseat. Rich as he is, Egan now burns as hot as ever. He stokes the fire in his employees by making bets against them, by giving them big odds on meeting a product deadline or on solving an engineering riddle and then putting up his own money and demanding they do the same. He hopes like hell he'll lose, because then, of course, the company wins, and Egan gets to play the tough guy in front of the troops and pay the winners in cash…\n\nAnd the \"we\"? That's his company and his family, which in many cases are one and the same. He has three sons and one daughter, all of whom have worked for EMC at one time or another, all of whom, he says proudly, are millionaires… All over the company—in telephone marketing, in facilities management, and among the engineers—are Egans and Fitzgeralds, no apologies necessary. (\"He's a good man,\" Egan says as he passes a young man in the hall. \"He also happens to be the father of two of my grandchildren.\") And who's on the board? \"Ha-ha-ha! Me, my wife, my son, and my brother-in-law.\" Plus four others, but they hardly count. \"Let me settle the board thing with you,\" he says. \"I want only one thing from the board: compliance. Directors can make only one of two statements. It's either 'I agree' or 'I resign.\"\n\nOctober 1994 EMC announces Symmetrix Remote Data Facility (SRDF), its first storage-based software application. SRDF restores data from a secondary site within minutes of an outage or interruption. EMC Customers invented more uses for it, including data center consolidations and migrations. With the subsequent release of additional applications, EMC became by 1998 one of the world’s fastest-growing software companies. In 2004, software accounted for 26% of revenues.\n\nNovember 1994 EMC establishes a new division, the Open Storage Group, and announces Centriplex, a newly-developed product aimed at the Unix storage market. The product will be discontinued by the end of 1995 in light of the rapid success of the Symmetrix 3000, also aimed at the Unix storage market.\n\nDecember 1994 1994 revenues grew 76% to $1.37 billion and income rose 97% to $251 million. The number of employees is 3,200.\n\nFebruary 1995 With partners Alcatel and Pacific Bell, EMC demonstrates the “Cinema of the Future,” streaming high definition video from Symmetrix to high definition projection systems and television monitors.\n\nJune 1995 EMC announces Symmetrix 3000, an adaptation of its mainframe storage product for servers running the Unix operating system. By 1997, Symmetrix became the leading server-agnostic or Enterprise Storage system, the first to support simultaneously mainframes and Unix and NT servers. EMC’s open systems (Unix and NT) revenues that year had grown to $1.5 billion, surpassing mainframe storage sales for the first time.\n\nOctober 1995 EMC acquires network switch vendor McData Corporation, positioning EMC for the emerging network storage market.\n\nNovember 1995 EMC signs OEM agreement with Hewlett-Packard and ATT GIS (NCR), to market and sell Symmetrix 3000. EMC announces Symmetirx ESP, the first system to provide simultaneous storage of mainframe and open systems (Unix, etc.) data on the same device.\n\nDecember 1995 EMC takes the lead in the mainframe storage market. In 1990, when EMC entered the mainframe storage market with Symmetrix, IBM held 76% of the market while EMC held 0.2%. In 1995, EMC accounted for 41% of mainframe storage terabytes shipped while IBM’s share fell to 35%.\n\nApril 1996 A new 3,000 square foot Network Storage Technology Center opens at EMC headquarters in Hopkinton, Massachusetts.\n\n[Update] May 1996 Ethernet inventor Bob Metcalfe visits the Network Storage Technology Center in Hopkinton and writes in his Infoworld column:\n\nEMC's vice president of engineering, Moshe Yanai, is way ahead of me. EMC's storage systems are high-capacity, already up into the terabytes (thousands of gigabytes). Yanai said that EMC's push into networking is all about economies of scale and \"storage consolidation.\" With a twinkle in his eye, he told me that his goal is to put all the information in the world on one EMC server.\n\nOK, now listen to this: Yanai's worry, which he explained with a graph drawn in my notebook, is whether, after the perfection of \"atom-manipulation\" disk technology, the demand for information storage will be able to keep up with the supply of high-capacity disks. Yes, Yanai asked me to reassure him that the Internet is going to have uses for all the storage capacity that EMC is working to make available...\n\nA 17-square-foot terabyte EMC Media Server had already been demonstrated for the National Association of Broadcasters in Las Vegas. It's NFS that has yet to be shipped. Isn't that backward, MPEG before NFS? EMC found doing a media server \"easy.\" ... Extranets will require big servers. And as electronic commerce ramps, those servers will have to be reliable and fast. As millions of consumers get involved, video will be required.\n\nSo I suggest you keep your eye on EMC and that worldwide server Yanai is building in Hopkinton.\n\nOctober 1996 EMC enters the file server market, calling it the Network-Attached Storage (NAS) market (and convincing all competitors and analysts to use that term), with Symmetrix Network File Storage (SNFS), later renamed Celerra.\n\nApril 1997 EMC introduces TimeFinder business continuance software, allowing customers to non-disruptively create multiple copies of their production data to be used for a variety of purposes such as backups, Year 2000 testing, Euro Currency conversion, data warehouse loading, and application development.\n\n1999 Radical Marketing by Sam Hill and Glenn Rifkin, which includes a chapter on EMC, is published. In a section titled “let your customers be your marketing department,” Hill and Rifkin write:\n\nFor Denis O’Leary, Chase Manhattan former CIO and now executive vice president of national consumer services, EMC is not just a radical marketer but a high-tech marketing model for the next millennium. EMC’s penchant for staying close to the customer is at the root of the company’s success. “If we have a problem in storage at 3:00am, I know I can get Mike Ruettgers on the phone and he isn’t going to ask why I’m calling,” O’Leary says. He says Egan and Ruettgers epitomize a new CEO-centric selling model that has started to pervade the high-tech sector, a model that put CEOs of high-tech companies in constant touch with customers.\n\nOctober 1999 EMC acquires Data General for $1.1 billion. Founded in 1968, it developed the first minicomputer based on integrated circuit technology, and, in 1992, introduced the CLARiiON disk storage system. Cnet reported: “EMC estimated the midrange [storage] push gained from Data General will increase its target market presence by almost 40 percent by 2001. ‘It's very unusual circumstances where a company can increase the size of the target market, yet stay within their core competency,’ said [CEO Mike] Ruettgers.”\n\nNovember 1999 EMC enters the storage area network (SAN) market, making it easier to connect multiple storage devices to multiple servers via Fibre Channel networking technology.\n\nDecember 2000 EMC opens the world’s largest interoperability lab for storage area networks.\n\nJanuary 2001 Joe Tucci is named President and CEO; Mike Ruettgers becomes Executive Chairman and founder Dick Egan becomes Chairman Emeritus.\n\nJanuary 2001 The Harvard Business Review publishes “Managing for the next big thing: An interview with EMC’s Michael Ruettgers.” In response to interviewer Paul Hemp’s question whether the server vendors had an additional leverage with customers because they sold other IT components in addition to storage, Ruettgers explained the advantages of EMC’s “maniacal focus” on storage:\n\nI think our focus on a single business actually helps us stay ahead of the curve. In some respects, this runs counter to what I learned in business school, where the prevailing wisdom was to diversify. But our single-minded focus creates a special lens through which to view and interpret customers’ current and future needs. For example, our perspective allowed us to see that the computer industry had, in some ways, lost sight of its reason for being. It had become so consumed with the “T” in IT—the creation of faster processors and more efficient networks—that it had forgotten about the “I.” Yet ultimately, it’s information that customers care about: the speed of access to it, its availability, the ability to share it across an organization. Other companies, with the distractions of their different business areas, weren’t as quick to see this.\n\n… look at Data General, which we acquired in 1999. The company faced terrific challenges as the minicomputer business collapsed, but it moved into the open-storage business about the same time we did. It had an excellent storage product and a relatively good position in certain segments of the storage marketplace. Still, its executives were never willing to give up their other business until we acquired them, even though their minicomputer revenue was declining and they understood their opportunities were on the storage side. Acting on an opportunity, as well as merely identifying it, is to some extent easier when you’re committed to a single industry.\n\nOctober 2001 Dell and EMC sign a five-year, multi-billion dollar alliance for Dell to sell EMC’s CLARiiON storage. Analyst Steve Duplessie of the Enterprise Storage Group reacted: “The move, in theory, is just stinking brilliant.”\n\nApril 2002 A year after EMC acquired Belgian software company FilePool, it introduces the concept of “content-addressed storage” and a product, Centera, the first storage solution designed specifically for fixed, or unchanging, content. Centera became EMC’s fastest-growing storage system ever.\n\nAugust 2002 EMC introduces the EMC CLARiiON CX series, altering the industry’s mid-tier price-performance curve.\n\nSeptember 2002 EMC share price hits a low of $3.62, down from $104 in September 2000. Revenues in 2001 fell to $7 billion from $8.9 billion in 2000 and EMC lost $508 million for the year. In 2002, revenues went further down to $5.4 billion and EMC lost $119 million. Recovery came in 2003 with $6.2 billion in revenues and income of $496 million. “Companies afraid to disrupt themselves almost 100% of the time end up being disrupted,” Tucci told Fortune magazine in 2002. “We’re doing what competitors never thought we’d have the intestinal fortitude to do.”\n\nFebruary 2003 EMC introduces the EMC Symmetrix DMX series of storage systems.\n\nJuly 2003 EMC announces an agreement to acquire Legato Systems in a stock transaction valued at $1.3 billion. The acquisition adds to EMC’s storage management portfolio backup and recovery capabilities, hierarchical storage management and e-mail and content archiving.\n\nOctober 2003 EMC announces an agreement to acquire enterprise content management vendor Documentum in a stock transaction valued at for $1.7 billion.\n\nDecember 2003 EMC announces an agreement to acquire virtualization software vendor VMware in a cash transaction of approximately $635 million. One financial analyst noted: “We believe that the VMware line has the potential to be EMC’s killer app.” In August 2007, EMC offered 10% of VMware stock in an IPO. At the end of the first trading day, VMware’s market cap was $19.1 billion. “I’m 59 years old and VMware is the best investment I made in my life,\" Joe Tucci told the New York Times in February 2007.\n\nAugust 2005 EMC announces an agreement to acquire Rainfinity, a provider of virtualization solutions for heterogeneous networked attached storage (NAS) and file system environments. The acquisition is valued at less than $100 million.\n\nMay 2006 EMC announces that it has acquired Kashya, a privately held provider of enterprise-class data replication and data protection software in a cash transaction valued at approximately $153 million.\n\nJune 2006 EMC announces an agreement to acquire RSA Security for approximately $2.1 billion.\n\nNovember 2006 EMC announces an agreement to acquire privately-held Avamar Technologies, a provider of enterprise-class data protection software featuring industry-leading data de-duplication technology in a cash transaction valued at approximately $165 million.\n\n2008 EMC is the first to integrate Flash drives into enterprise storage systems. Revenues for the year reach $14.8 billion with income of $1.3 billion.\n\nJuly 2009 EMC completes its acquisition of Data Domain, a pioneer of data deduplication, for $2.4 billion.\n\nJuly 2010 EMC acquires Greenplum, provider of big data analytics software.\n\nNovember 2010 EMC announces an agreement to acquire Isilon Systems, a fast-growing a provider of network-attached storage systems for approximately $2.25 billion.\n\nJanuary 2011 EMC introduces VNX, a new family of unified storage systems combining the features of CLARiiON (mid-tier storage) and Celerra (network-attached storage).\n\nMarch 2012 According to the IDC Worldwide Quarterly Disk Storage Systems Tracker, EMC has remained the top provider (in revenues) of external disk storage systems for the 15th consecutive year.\n\nMarch 2012 EMC announces it has acquired Pivotal Labs, a privately-held provider of agile software development services and tools.\n\nMay 2012 EMC announces that it has acquired privately held XtremIO, a pioneer in the development of Flash storage architecture.\n\nJuly 2013 EMC announces an agreement to acquire privately-held ScaleIO, a pioneer in server-side storage software.\n\nSeptember 2013 EMC announces availability of ViPR software-defined storage platform.\n\nNovember 2013 EMC announces general availability of XtremIO all-flash array.\n\nMay 2014 EMC announces an agreement to acquire privately-held DSSD, developer of an innovative new rack-scale flash storage architecture for I/O-intensive in-memory databases and Big Data workloads.\n\nMay 2015 EMC announces an agreement to acquire privately-held Virtustream, a provider of cloud software and services.\n\nOctober 12, 2015 Dell Inc. and EMC Corporation announce they have signed a definitive agreement under which Dell, together with its owners, Michael S. Dell, founder, chairman and chief executive officer of Dell, MSD Partners and Silver Lake, will acquire EMC Corporation. The transaction is valued at approximately $67 billion.\n\nDecember 2015 Revenues for 2015 grew 1% to $24.7 billion and income fell 35% to $2 billion.\n\nMarch 2016 According to IDC’s Quarterly Enterprise Storage System Tracker, EMC led the $24 billion external enterprise storage systems market (down 2.4% from 2014) with 29.6% share. EMC also led the all flash array market with 37.7% share.\n\nAugust 30, 2016 Dell Inc. and EMC Corporation announce that they intend to close the transaction to combine Dell and EMC on September 7, 2016. Dell Technologies, the name of the new combined company, will begin operating immediately following the close of the transaction. From the announcement:\n\n“This is an historic moment for both Dell and EMC. Combined, we will be exceptionally well-positioned for growth in the most strategic areas of next generation IT including digital transformation, software-defined data center, converged infrastructure, hybrid cloud, mobile and security,” said Michael Dell, chairman and CEO of Dell Technologies. “Our investments in R&D and innovation, along with our 140,000 team members around the world, will give us unmatched scale, strength and flexibility, deepening our relationships with customers of all sizes.”\n\n“I am proud of everything we’ve built at EMC – from humble beginnings as a Boston-based startup to a global, world-class technology company with an unyielding dedication to our customers,” said Joe Tucci, chairman and chief executive officer of EMC. “The combination of Dell and EMC creates a new powerhouse in the industry - providing the essential technology for the next era in IT.”\n\nUpon close of the transaction, EMC shares under the ticker symbol “EMC” will be suspended from trading on the New York Stock Exchange."
