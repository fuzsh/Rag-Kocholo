A Documentum Content Server instance can have one or more DocBases crawled with an EMC Documentum Content Server source. The Documentum Content Server source navigates through the DocBases and the inline cabinets to crawl all the documents in Documentum Content Server. Oracle SES creates an index, stores the metadata, and accesses information in Oracle SES to provide search capabilities according to the end user permissions.\n\nOracle SES supports incremental crawling; that is, it crawls and indexes only those documents that have changed after the most recent crawling was scheduled. A document is re-crawled if either the content or metadata or the direct security access information of the document has changed. A document is also re-crawled if it is moved within Documentum Content Server and the end user has to access the same document with a different URL. Documents deleted from a DocBase are removed from the index during incremental crawling."
