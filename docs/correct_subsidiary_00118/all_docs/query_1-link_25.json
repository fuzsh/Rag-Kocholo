        "text": "Together, EMC Corporation and C6, a French enterprise content management software provider, are on a mission to ease CMS efforts. Today the pair released EMC Documentum D2, an application for the codeless building of content solutions that quickly match ECM application functionality to business needs.\n\nEMC Documentum D2\n\nIn layman's terms, the release hopes to please today's users with an easier, faster way to use Documentum.\n\nFor instance, EMC says analysts can now be much more responsive to business needs and accelerate time-to-value through Documentum D2's amped configuration options. Administrators also have a reason to do a happy dance or two over the consistency of ECM rules and policies through this simplified approach to information management.\n\n\"EMC is thrilled to make Documentum easier to use, as we believe this is a major step forward in delighting the new user,\" said Rick Devenuti, President of EMC's Information Intelligence Group. \"We continue to make progress at addressing the complexity of building and maintaining content centric solutions by obviating the need for coding. We are pleased to welcome this addition to the Documentum family of solutions. With this announcement, we bring the best of both worlds to our customers: the power of industry leading Documentum platform with a modern and delightful user experience.\"\n\nEMC's exclusive licensing agreement with C6 looks fairly quick and painless, as all the technology assets acquired have already become part of the Documentum family, and are currently available for deployment.\n\nDelighting the New User\n\nThe announcement of EMC Documentum D2 is yet another example of EMC's efforts to simplify the user experience. The company also recently released an application of Apple's iPad, granting users secure mobile access to content stored in Documentum repositories.\n\nLearning Opportunities\n\nEMC called this release a part of its \"Choice Computing\" initiative, which aims to give users access to any information that exists across EMC products from the device of their choice.\n\nEMC Documentum iPad App search\n\n\"…EMC is delighted to deliver a key component of our strategy to empower the ‘new user’ in the Post-PC Era, who’s far more mobile, social and thrives on instant access to business-critical information,\" said Rohit Ghai, VP and General EMC Information Intelligence Group. \"Organizations can now realize a higher return on their investment through increased end user adoption of content and case management solutions.\"\n\nGoing forward, EMC customers can expect much more movement in this area. The company also says it plans to release updates to the iPad app every three months, and will eventually make it available for all major mobile platforms.\n\nAs for Documentum D2, product nomenclature and pricing is on the way."
