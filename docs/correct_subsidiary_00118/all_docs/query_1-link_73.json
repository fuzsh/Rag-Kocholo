        "text": "GlobalLinkT Content Director Drives Cost and Time Efficiencies for Documentum Users with Multilingual Content\n\nNEW YORK, NY, May 19, 2008 – Translations.com, a leading provider of language-related services and technology, today announced that its flagship GlobalLink® Content Director has received the “Designed for EMC Documentum®” accreditation, a mark of quality and value that customers depend on in enterprise applications. The “Designed for EMC Documentum” accreditation demonstrates that GlobalLink Content Director has successfully met a comprehensive set of criteria for solid design and quality integration.\n\nGlobalLink Content Director is unique in that it integrates directly within the EMC Documentum environment, offering EMC Documentum users globalization process automation in a familiar User Interface (UI). UI integration with EMC Documentum allows users to take full advantage of GlobalLink Content Director’s localization workflow capabilities without having to run a separate application. Localization projects are initiated and managed directly in the EMC Documentum platform utilizing GlobalLink Content Director’s automated change detection and automated content extraction/re-integration functionality. The benefit customers enjoy is an extension of EMC Documentum's functionality that is designed to drive significant reductions in the labor-intensive tasks associated with multilingual content initiatives.\n\nBeyond UI integration within EMC Documentum, GlobalLink Content Director is also different from many competitive products in that it can be supported with localization services from Translations.com, any third-party language services provider (LSP), an in-house translation team, or any combination thereof.\n\nAccording to Randy Ziegler, Director of Developer Programs at EMC Corporation, “EMC’s position as the leader in enterprise content management is strengthened by the support of great partners such as Translations.com. Partners like Translations.com build solutions and applications on the Documentum platform because customers have demonstrated their trust in EMC Documentum to manage their most critical and strategic information. The accreditation program is another way EMC earns that trust while supporting innovative offerings like GlobalLink Content Director.”\n\nPhil Shawe, CEO of Translations.com, stated, \"Translations.com is proud to have taken the next step in its partnership with EMC Documentum by attaining the \"Designed for EMC Documentum\" accreditation for GlobalLink Content Director. Passing the stringent evaluation criteria associated with the program should give EMC Documentum customers added comfort when implementing GlobalLink Content Director.\" Shawe continued, \"All great partnerships are based on trust. Translations.com has publically stated it has no aspirations to enter the CMS market, preferring to partner with market leaders such as EMC Documentum for translation-related technology. This facilitates open cooperation in the development process and leads to products which are more innovative and serve customers better. We believe Content Director is one such product, and our official accreditation will further support the current traction Content Director is enjoying in the marketplace.”\n\nTranslations.com will be exhibiting at booth #921 during EMC World in Las Vegas, May 19-22.\n\nAbout \"Designed for EMC Documentum\"\n\nThe Designed for EMC Documentum program helps ISVs, VSPs, and SIs design, develop, and go-to-market with successful offerings based on the EMC Documentum platform. Members receive specialized design consultation and guidance, along with access to dedicated content management technical resources. Partners can submit their offerings to be considered for the “Designed for EMC Documentum” accreditation—which, if achieved, signifies to customers that the offering meets high standards for architectural compliance with Documentum practices and will provide a reliable integration with less uncertainty for joint customers.
