        "text": "HOLLYWOOD, Fla., July 23, 2007 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- STARLIMS Technologies Ltd., a leading global provider of laboratory information management systems (LIMS), announced today that its STARLIMS Version 10 software has received the \"Designed for EMC(r) Documentum(r)\" accreditation, a mark of quality and value that customers depend on in enterprise applications. The \"Designed for EMC Documentum\" accreditation demonstrates that STARLIMS Version 10 has successfully met a comprehensive set of criteria for good design, development and integration with the EMC Documentum platform.\n\nSTARLIMS Technologies Ltd. develops and markets a commercial off-the-shelf laboratory information management system (LIMS) that has been deployed in hundreds of organizations around the world. Leveraging the EMC Documentum enterprise content management (ECM) platform, STARLIMS Version 10 users can now manage data from LIMS and other enterprise systems from within a single repository.\n\nStructured and Unstructured Data in a Single Repository\n\n\"STARLIMS now brings the gold standard in enterprise content management into the LIMS space,\" said Itschak Friedman, Chief Executive Officer at STARLIMS. \"We are excited to complete the first step on the product roadmap we announced in July 2006, by creating a LIMS that offers management of both structured and unstructured data within a single repository.\"\n\nFriedman noted that, \"Analysts and customers alike are asking for solutions that consolidate various types of data -- minimizing the inefficiencies of alternating between multiple data repositories. That is precisely what we have achieved by integrating our STARLIMS Version 10 application with EMC's Documentum platform.\"\n\nPart of a Single Platform Integrating LIMS, SDMS and ELN Functionalities\n\n\"Following this accreditation we will move forward in our plan to integrate full SDMS (Scientific Data Management System) and ELN (Electronic Laboratory Notebook) functionalities into our entirely Web-based LIMS, so customers can use a single end-to-end platform to create, capture, manage, share and archive scientific data,\" added Friedman.\n\n\"EMC's position as the leader in enterprise content management is strengthened by the support of great partners such as STARLIMS,\" said Randy Ziegler, Director of Developer Programs at EMC Corporation. \"Partners like STARLIMS build solutions and applications on the Documentum platform because customers have demonstrated their trust in EMC Documentum to manage their most critical and strategic information. The accreditation program is another way EMC earns that trust while supporting innovative offerings like STARLIMS Version 10.\"\n\nMember of the EMC Designed for EMC Program\n\nSTARLIMS Version 10 received design accreditation by meeting high standards for application design, development, configuration, installation processes and overall quality. As a member of the Designed for EMC program, STARLIMS Technologies Ltd. received specialized design consultation and guidance, along with access to dedicated EMC content management technical resources.
