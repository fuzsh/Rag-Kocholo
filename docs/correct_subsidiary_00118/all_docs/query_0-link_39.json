        "text": "HOUSTON & HOPKINTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 5, 2006--Landmark, a brand of the Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) Digital and Consulting Solutions Division, and EMC Corporation, the world leader in information management and storage, have signed a global agreement to jointly develop exploration and production (E&P) information lifecycle management (ILM) solutions that help upstream oil and gas companies more efficiently and cost-effectively capture, archive and leverage data throughout the entire E&P lifecycle. These solutions will address the management of information assets including information creation, storage, indexing, cataloging, data quality measurement and workflow/audit capture.\n\nAs part of the new agreement, Landmark will offer enterprise content and knowledge management solutions for unstructured and structured data that integrate EMC Documentum(R) content management software with Landmark DecisionSpace(R) information management and infrastructure solutions. Additionally, Landmark will resell EMC's portfolio of networked storage systems, software and services including EMC Symmetrix(R), EMC CLARiiON(R) and EMC Celerra(R) networked storage systems and EMC Centera(TM) content addressed storage (CAS) systems, as well as the EMC ControlCenter(R) family of storage management software. The combination of EMC and Landmark products will help upstream oil and gas customers more efficiently capture, search and manage their content regardless of source or format; support regulatory compliance and achieve greater economies of scale to accelerate the E&P process.\n\n\"This game-changing alliance will enable breakthrough performance for our E&P customers, for the first time providing an offering for their knowledge workers that spans structured and unstructured data management across the enterprise,\" said Jonathan Lewis, vice president of Innovation and Marketing, Halliburton Digital and Consulting Solutions. \"Now, coupling Landmark and EMC-branded solutions, geoscientists and engineers will be able to spend more time prospecting for oil and gas rather than information, and truly drive operating income performance around the asset.\"\n\n\"Upstream oil and gas is one of the most information-intensive industries on the planet,\" said Mitch Breen, senior vice president, EMC Global Channels. \"Data volumes range from hundreds of terabytes to petabytes in size, and we expect these volumes to increase as companies continue to use more sophisticated types of digital exploration technologies. Leveraging Landmark's vast industry expertise in upstream computing and extensive customer base, we are able to increase the value of EMC solutions to help E&P companies address their critical information management and storage needs.\"\n\nAbout EMC\n\nEMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC) is the world leader in products, services and solutions for information management and storage that help organizations extract the maximum value from their information, at the lowest total cost, across every point in the information lifecycle.
