        "text": "EMC Corp. said last week that it has integrated content and digital rights management software from two of its acquisitions in an effort to give companies better control over their data, even if the information is sent to someone outside the corporate firewall.\n\nEMC released a new version of its Records Manager software, which was developed by Documentum Inc. before it was acquired by the storage vendor in late 2003. EMC also added a package combining content management capabilities with digital rights management technology that it obtained through its acquisition of Authentica Inc. in February.\n\nRecords Manager 5.3 and the Information Rights Management (IRM) Services offering can be used together to apply security protections and permissions to unstructured data stored in a Documentum repository, said Lubor Ptacek, a marketing director at EMC.\n\nPeter Weis, CIO at Matson Navigation Co. in Oakland, Calif., said he would be interested in the new functionality for managing financial documents, especially when his company starts offering shipping services from China.\n\nMatson is a cargo shipper and broker and has annual revenue of about $1.5 billion. Weis said the company is deploying Documentum products throughout its operations, embedding the software within its accounts payable system and in a new order management system for its truck and rail business.\n\nPtacek said the unified offering of Records Manager and IRM Services is aimed at companies that not only store data for regulatory compliance purposes but also continue to use the information and want to ensure that it is destroyed when the required retention period is over.\n\nIRM Services enables content owners to control access to data and how it is used, while maintaining a full audit trail of document activity, EMC said. Meanwhile, Records Manager 5.3 was built using a service-oriented architecture, making it more modular and easier to integrate with other applications, said Ptacek.\n\nCorporate Express Inc. in Broomfield, Colo., has been using Documentum technology for 10 years, according to Bill Morey, director of records management. The $4.6 billion distributor of office and computer products is now rolling it out enterprisewide for managing all content on desktop PCs — primarily for compliance reasons.\n\nMorey said he could see his company adding a product like IRM Services in the future. “Further down the road, we’ll be looking at solutions such as IRM, where you can wrap security requirements and controls around content,” he said.\n\nEvery major vendor involved in content management is at least thinking about how to incorporate digital rights management technology into their products, said Melissa Webster, an analyst at IDC in Framingham, Mass.\n\nAs an example of how the software could be used, Webster said that if a product design company sent information about a planned new product to a half-dozen prospective manufacturers, the integrated content and digital rights management tools could ensure that the losing bidders wouldn’t be able to make knockoffs based on the original design."
