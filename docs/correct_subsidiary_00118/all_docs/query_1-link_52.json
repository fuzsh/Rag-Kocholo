        "text": "WoodWing Software announced today that EMC Corporation, the world leader in information storage and management, will resell its Smart Connection Enterprise software as part of the EMC Documentum Enterprise Publishing Solution (EPS), a new content management solution that provides comprehensive editorial design and layout capabilities.\n\nWoodWing's Smart Connection Enterprise is an Adobe InDesign and InCopy integration tool that enables workflow flexibility through powerful management, organization and document security standards for editorial production. The integration of WoodWing Smart Connection in EMC Documentum EPS allows publishers to manage their editorial production workflows, using the same print content and related ancillary content for publishing to the Web or other emerging channels such as wireless devices.\n\nDocumentum EPS is built on, and takes advantage of, the unified EMC Documentum enterprise content management (ECM) architecture, enabling users to utilize the full ECM capabilities such as digital asset management, web publishing, XML support, workflows, security, content rendering and localization. Through the use of Documentum EPS, book and magazine publishers are able to streamline their multi-channel publishing processes across their entire enterprise, resulting in quicker turnaround and lower production costs.\n\n\"As a leading provider of plug-ins and development services for Adobe InDesign and InCopy tools, our priority is developing productivity tools that make publishing easier, faster and more effective,\" said Brian Kruger, CEO of WoodWing Software. \"This reseller relationship with a leading content management provider such as EMC provides our joint customers with an integrated, easy-to-use editorial workflow solution that has enterprise scalability and multi-channel publishing capabilities.\"\n\n\"Smart Connection Enterprise nicely complements the Documentum publishing platform,\" said Mark Arbour, General Manager, Digital Asset Management Technologies, EMC Software Group. \"This relationship allows us to extend the value we offer to our publishing customers through tight coupling of the EMC Documentum workflow and EMC Documentum unified enterprise content management platform with the Adobe InDesign and InCopy tools.\"\n\nAbout WoodWing\n\nSince 1997, WoodWing Software engineers have worked with the Adobe InDesign engineering team to develop plug-ins and solutions for Adobe InDesign and InCopy.
