        "text": "from DSSResources.com\n\nEMC delivers World's first storage-aware content management platform\n\nNew EMC Documentum Content Storage Services Enables Automated, Policy-Based Information Lifecycle Management\n\nHOPKINTON, Mass., July 26, 2004 -- EMC Corporation (NYSE: EMC), the world leader in information storage and management, today announced the new EMC Documentum Content Storage Services, a major advancement to help customers derive higher levels of business value from their information lifecycle management (ILM) strategies. Documentum Content Storage Services enables organizations to define and execute storage policies that automate the placement and movement of content across a tiered heterogeneous storage infrastructure. Using this technology, new content can be automatically placed on the optimal storage platform and migrated when the value of that content and related business needs change. As a result, Documentum Content Storage Services helps organizations meet information access, retention and compliance requirements, while consistently storing information in the most cost-effective manner. EMC is delivering this fully integrated offering -- available immediately -- within seven months of acquiring Documentum.\n\nDocumentum Content Storage Services is the first and only storage-aware enterprise content management solution designed specifically to enable organizations to adopt an information lifecycle management strategy, thereby maximizing the value of content, at the lowest total cost of ownership, at every point in the information lifecycle. The new offering supports all EMC storage platforms, as well as arrays from other vendors, including Hitachi, IBM, Hewlett Packard and Network Appliance.\n\nCorporate Express, one of the world's largest business-to-business suppliers of essential office and computer products, has deployed Documentum products across many business initiatives throughout the company. \"Corporate Express sees great value in EMC Documentum Content Storage Services, as the solution enables companies like ours to be smart and take a proactive approach to maximizing the value of our content and our storage infrastructure,\" said Wayne Aiello, Vice President of eBusiness Services for Corporate Express. \"We see particular value in deploying Documentum Content Storage Services, not only for contracts and financial documents, but also for automated, policy-based archival of web content. Establishing business policies for storing and migrating content brings new levels of operational efficiency, which lead to cost savings.\"\n\nDocumentum Content Storage Services is designed for organizations of all sizes and varying degrees of IT complexity, from small companies that need automated rules-based archival to large enterprises that have embraced tiered storage due to manage increasing volumes of unstructured content and escalating storage costs. Until now, IT organizations have not been able to automatically allocate storage and align service levels with the changing business value of content, often paying more for unneeded access speeds and uptime, or conversely, sacrificing performance, data protection or compliance to control storage costs. Many organizations also struggle with manual, error-prone processes for content archival, which can result in unnecessary and potentially costly exposure to risk, unintended content deletion and noncompliance.\n\nUsing Documentum Content Storage Services, information can be allocated to and migrated across storage devices based on business policies that utilize standard and user-defined attributes, including content type, access control level, lifecycle state, sharing permissions, industry regulations or archiving requirements, as well as date last accessed, size, related transactions or related documents. Together, storage administrators and business users work to define policies that specify the initial storage device/tier and rules for migrating information across storage tiers. Policies can be executed automatically as a result of a system event (such as the completion of a workflow activity), ad-hoc and in batch to provide the greatest level of flexibility for an organization to optimize utilization. Documentum Content Storage Services also includes migration logs and audit trail capabilities so that content movement among storage tiers can be monitored and internal accounting charge backs easily reported.\n\nDave DeWalt, Executive Vice President of EMC Software Group and President of Documentum and LEGATO, said, \"EMC Documentum Content Storage Services is a major step forward in both content and storage management, as it delivers functionality that enables customers to deploy advanced information lifecycle management strategies. By combining content management's deep understanding of application data value and the tiered storage infrastructure that supports it, Documentum Content Storage Services will help IT organizations and business users work together to reduce costs, increase operational efficiency and optimize use of enterprise content and the storage infrastructure.\"\n\nDocumentum Content Storage Services differs from hierarchical storage management (HSM) solutions that store information based on standard file or disk-level information by providing allocation and migration of information based on all of the rich metadata and content services provided by the EMC Documentum Enterprise Content Management Platform. Documentum Content Storage Services can be utilized to complement and extend HSM solutions to provide even greater value to organizations that have existing HSM investments.\n\nEMC will host an online seminar to introduce Documentum Content Storage Services. The one hour seminar will take place on Thursday, July 29, 2004, at 10:00 a.m. PT/1:00 p.m. ET.
