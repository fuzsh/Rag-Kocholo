As a result of the agreement, EMC is delivering EMC® Documentum® D2, a modern and highly-configurable application for rapidly building content solutions. Available now, the solution enables business analysts to rapidly match ECM application functionality to their business needs, without the need for coding.\n\nContinuing to Delight the New User\n\nProviding a simple and rich user experience, supporting Choice Computing, and commitment to device mobility are key drivers of EMC's thrust to support the New User, referred to as today's knowledge worker who determines when, where and how to access and interact with information on devices of their choice. Earlier this year, the company delivered the EMC Documentum Mobile app for the Apple iPad to provide users with true enterprise capabilities from anywhere. With the announcement today, EMC delivers another proof point of their strategy by simplifying the user experience for Documentum. This new capability enhances the productivity of knowledge workers by easily tailoring their user experience for their specific requirements.\n\nEMC Documentum D2: A new approach for delivering content applications\n\nDocumentum D2 offers rapid time to value for building and delivering content centric solutions. Business analysts can be much more responsive to the needs of the business and accelerate time-to-value through the power of configuration with Documentum D2. In addition, administrators now have consistency of ECM rules and policies through this simplified information management approach based on configuration.\n\nAll the technology assets acquired as part of this agreement become part of the Documentum family. This technology is available now and already deployed at scale in many customer environments. EMC expects to announce product nomenclature and pricing shortly.\n\nEMC Executive Quote:\n\nRick Devenuti, President of EMC's Information Intelligence Group\n\n\"EMC is thrilled to make Documentum easier to use, as we believe this is a major step forward in delighting the new user.
