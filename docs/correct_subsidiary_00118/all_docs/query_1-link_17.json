        "text": "BOSTON, Bio-IT World, March 31 /PRNewswire/ -- EMC Corporation and its Documentum division are showcasing storage and enterprise content management solutions to help life sciences organizations better manage the exploding amount of data they are generating in drug discovery and development at the IDG Bio-IT World Conference and Exposition. EMC Chairman Michael Ruettgers will deliver a keynote address focused on information lifecycle management (ILM) and will discuss ways the healthcare-life sciences industry can more cost-effectively manage, store and archive information based on its value at any given time.\n\nInformation management plays a critical role in healthcare-life sciences organizations today as new methods, science and business models continue to drive the extraordinary growth of structured data, such as databases, and unstructured data, such as images, from multiple sources. With an ILM strategy, researchers, scientists and caregivers can leverage more of the essential knowledge that resides in their vast collections of biological and medical information. Drug discovery productivity is accelerated, enabling better research collaboration and decreasing the time to peak sales for new therapeutics.\n\nRuettgers said, “The way to speed drug discovery, reduce medical errors and improve healthcare quality is to create a seamless and secure flow of electronic information that runs from genomic research, drug discovery, clinical trials and pharmacogenomics all the way to the patient record. Storing the right data at the right time on the right storage medium enables organizations to speed development, meet stringent regulatory requirements and formulate retention and security policies that maintain data for the life of a drug or patient record.”\n\nIf life sciences companies can effectively manage, retrieve, archive, selectively delete and reuse information generated during drug discovery, sales, marketing and manufacturing, then they can improve the time and cost of bringing those products to market while meeting GxP and FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliance. EMC’s acquisition of Documentum last December integrates Documentum’s unique expertise and software for enterprise content management into EMC’s overall ILM strategy. Combining the Documentum Enterprise Content Management platform with EMC Centera Compliance Edition, life sciences organizations can administer and manage R&D content including clinical protocols, methods, tests and images from a centralized, secure location.\n\nAt the Bio-IT World Expo at the Hynes Convention Center, EMC’s booth (#314) will show the new EMC CLARiiON CX700 and Centera content addressed storage (CAS) systems. Ruettgers’ keynote will be today at 2:30 pm in Ballroom B. EMC and Documentum will hold a technology demonstration at 11:30 am in the technology showcase theater on the Expo Hall floor.\n\nAbout EMC\n\nEMC Corporation is the world leader in products, services and solutions for information storage and management that help organizations extract the maximum value from their information, at the lowest total cost, across every point in the information lifecycle.
