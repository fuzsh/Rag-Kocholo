Adjusted earnings before taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) amounted to $5.9 billion, which is 126% higher than in fiscal year 2016.\n\nBusiness in Russia\n\nRead about the Dell EMC business in a separate article:\n\nDell EMC (business in Russia and CIS)\n\nHistory\n\n2018\n\nVMware bought Dell to prepare for 5G network launch\n\nIn August 2018, VMware announced the purchase of Dell's parent company. This is a Dell EMC Service Assurance Suite framework that develops services to monitor performance and monitor network performance.\n\nHow much VMware paid for these assets is not reported. It is known that they will be integrated with the VMware Telco NFV product portfolio.\n\nIn connection with the preparation of operators for the launch of 5G networks, they increase the virtualization of edge and core networks using network function virtualization (NFV), \"says Shekar Ayyar, head of VMware Telco NFV Group. - The quality assurance system is critical for each telecommunications network. The capabilities that Dell EMC Service Assurance Suite software and services offer, together with VMware's proprietary innovations, will enable Communication Service Providers (CSPs) to upgrade and accelerate the transformation of their networks with NFV after the close of business.\n\nVMware adds that the purchase and subsequent integration of the Dell EMC Service Assurance Suite will help telecom operators \"keep core networks, cloud servers, and IT functioning reliably.\"\n\nAccording to VMware, by August 2018, about 50 operators, including the largest, are using Dell EMC Service Assurance Suite solutions worldwide.\n\nAs customers link 4G and 5G services, reliable network maintenance becomes critical. Dell EMC Service Assurance Suite provides operators with automation capabilities by accurately managing the analysis of the main causes that affect the stable operation of the network, said VMware.\n\nAccording to the Silicon Valley Business Journal, VMware's telecommunications division is based mainly in Palo Alto, but it is not known how many people work in German[1]\n\nNew Storage Strategy - 5 Essentials\n\nIn May 2018, a new strategy for the development of Dell EMC storage products became known. CRN observers highlighted, in their opinion, the five most important things of this program.\n\n1. In line with the new strategy, Dell's EMC development teams have focused on one core line of storage in each market segment: high, medium, and entry-level products, and a separate category of unstructured file and object storage solutions. In the high-performance solution sector, the company will focus on PowerMax systems based entirely on solid-state drives, and PowerVault products will be addressed to small and medium-sized businesses, as well as customers who need only basic storage functions.\n\n2. Dell EMC's initiative is to develop a new generation of mid-priced storage in addition to the Unity and SC Series families. The company estimates the volume of this storage segment at $14 billion.\n\n3. At the same time, Dell EMC is not going to abandon existing products, so the SC, Unity, XtremIO, Isilon and ECS lines will remain on the market. When the next generation of products is ready, the company will be able to smoothly switch to a new platform, said CRN, citing a market source.\n\n4. Another item in Dell's updated EMC strategy is optimizing your data protection portfolio. The company will focus innovation on one relevant hardware (Dell EMC Data Domain) and one software package (Data Protection Suite).\n\n5. The last item in the Dell EMC program, journalists call the appointment of veteran Jeff Clark as the head of the storage direction. He led the Dell EMC Infrastructure Solutions Group at the end of 2017 and conducted a major restructuring of business areas.[2]\n\n2017: Dell EMC and Nvidia Partner\n\nOn June 26, 2017, Dell EMC announced an agreement with NVIDIA, the purpose of which is Democratization and Promotion of High Performance Computing (HPC).\n\nDell EMC and NVIDIA have expanded their collaboration with companies to develop technologies that meet the growing demands of their workloads and data centers. These are graphics-accelerated products for high-performance computing, data analytics, and artificial intelligence.\n\nPartners have plans to develop the Volta architecture and intend to release finished products based on this architecture by the end of 2017.\n\n2016\n\nPure Storage Will Pay Dell $30 Million to Settle Litigation\n\nOn October 19, 2016, Pure Storage and Dell Technologies announced a settlement of a lawsuit that EMC began three years earlier. As part of the agreement, Pure Storage will pay the opponent compensation in the amount of $30 million. More details here.\n\nOpenText buys Documentum and other EMC assets for $1.6 billion\n\nIn September 2016, OpenText announced that it had signed a final agreement with Dell EMC to purchase from the latest Enterprise Content Division (ECD), including the Documentum, InfoArchive, and Leap product families. More details - by link.\n\nDocumentum Sales Information\n\nIn April 2016, information appeared in the media about the upcoming sale. Documentum The company EMC wants to get rid of this platform developer for electronic document management and corporate content management in order to facilitate a merger deal with. Dell\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the situation, EMC is considering selling Documentum. Private investors are likely to be interested in this business, but it will not work out a deal quickly, the source said.\n\nEMC never disclosed the financial performance of Documentum, purchased in 2003 for $1.7 billion. A Bloomberg source claims that the annual revenue of this company is about $600 million, and the profit margin exceeds 30%.\n\nWhat time EMC evaluates Documentum is not specified. Bloomberg only writes that this company can become part of assets worth more than $6 billion, which EMC and Dell intend to sell in order to simplify the merger of companies.\n\nDell itself, according to the publication, has put up for sale a provider of intelligent network security and data protection solutions SonicWall, as well as Quest Software, which develops network software through which organizations can improve the performance and security of applications, databases and virtual infrastructure. Dell intends to sell these \"daughters\" for about $4 billion.\n\nDell and EMC refrained from commenting on the request of the Western media. The companies plan to close the merger between June and October 2016. Dell's debt burden as a result of this acquisition is expected to be $50 billion.[3]\n\nDell Merger: Record Deal in IT-Business History\n\nDell made an offer to EMC to acquire for $67 billion in October 2015. The merger of both companies occurred on September 7, 2016 and was the largest deal in the history of the IT-Business. To finance the purchase in mid-May, Dell placed $20 billion in secured bonds - six issues with a fixed rate and maturity from 3 to 30 years. EMC shareholders received $24.05 for each EMC share, as well as targeted shares proportional to EMC's share in VMWare, whose shares are traded separately.\n\nAfter the merger of EMC with Dell, the merged business received the Dell Technologies brand, which became the world's largest private IT company with an annual turnover of $76 billion. The staff is about 140 thousand people, the holding will serve customers in 180 countries of the world. The combined company includes seven main brands: Dell, DellEMC, VMware, SecureWorks, Pivotal, Virtuustream and RSA.\n\n\"Before our eyes, a new industrial revolution begins. With every minute, the world becomes more interconnected, eventually merging with the world of the Internet of Things, opening up incredible prospects for customers. That's why we started Dell Technologies. We have everything we need to guide change and guide large and small customers in their transition to digital business, \"said Michael Dell, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Executive Director of Dell Technologies\n\n.\n\nAccording to him, the company formed as a result of the transaction combines Dell's strong positions in the small and medium business segments with EMC's strong positions in the enterprise segment.\n\n2015\n\n25% drop in profit\n\nOn January 27, 2016, EMC announced its financial results. The profit of the American company fell by a quarter due to the growth of the dollar and restructuring costs, which the company launched in connection with the merger with Dell.\n\nIn 2015, EMC made a net profit of $2 billion against $2.7 billion a year earlier. Revenue during this time rose 1%, amounting to $24.7 billion. If it were not for the unfavorable fluctuation in exchange rates, then the company's sales increased by 5%.\n\nIn addition, the financial results of the disk storage manufacturer were affected by the restructuring, launched due to the merger with Dell and involving a reduction in jobs and savings of about $850 million per year, starting in 2017. True, EMC will first have to invest in these structural changes: in October-December 2015, restructuring costs amounted to $224 million, and for the entire year, total operating costs exceeded $2.9 billion.\n\nBy the end of December 2015, EMC had accumulated about $14.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents, as well as short-term investments. In 2015, the company's free cash flow reached $3.9 billion. The manufacturer paid dividends in the amount of $907 million.\n\nNorth America remains the largest market for EMC and its subsidiaries. There, the corporation's revenue in 2015 rose 4% compared to a year ago and reached almost $14 billion. In EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa) and Asia-Pacific countries, sales fell by 2% and 1%, respectively, to $6.85 billion and $3.16 billion.\n\nEMC Information Infrastructure recorded revenue of $17.9 billion in 2015 (-2% compared to the previous year), and the remaining revenues of the corporation brought VMware controlled by it ($6.6 billion; + 10%) and Pivotal ($267 million; + 18[4]\n\nVirtuustream purchase for $1.2 billion\n\nOn May 26, 2015, EMC announced the purchase of the cloud services and software developer Traditiustream. Through the solutions of the absorbed company, the American corporation will be able to expand the business in the cloud.\n\nThe acquisition cost is $1.2 billion. After the close of the transaction, which is scheduled for the third quarter of 2015, Virtuustream forms a new division within EMC that is responsible for cloud-based external management services. Traditiustream CEO Rodney Rogers to report to EMC CEO [[Joseph Tucci|Joe Tucci\n\nSale of Syncplicity\n\nJuly 7, 2015 it became known about the upcoming sale of Syncplicity. EMC decided to get rid of this cloud service because of its loss-making.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg news agency, citing a source familiar with the situation, EMC plans to sell Syncplicity to Skyview Capital. The value of the proposed transaction is not called.\n\n2014\n\nBuying Cloud Companies\n\nEMC announced in October 2014 that three cloud companies had completed their acquisitions Cloudscaling : Group, Inc.,, Maginatics Inc and, Spanning Cloud Apps Inc. Each has the expertise and technology to help EMC expand its hybrid cloud portfolio and improve its cloud infrastructure, storage, and data protection technologies. Together with the product, EMC Enterprise Hybrid Cloud the acquired companies will help implement EMS strategy to provide customers with the choice and speed of implementation when creating hybrid clouds.\n\nWith the acquisition, EMC will be able to expand cloud offerings in three main areas: build hybrid clouds based on OpenStack, support various clouds with the ability to freely migrate data between them, and offer new capabilities to protect applications and data created in the cloud.\n\nIn 2014, there were rumors that EMC and HP were negotiating a merger, but the companies could not agree due to disagreements on the price issue.\n\n6% Profit Decline\n\nOn January 29, 2015, EMC released a financial report reflecting its performance in 2014. Revenue growth of the American company slowed down, and its profit decreased by 6% - this was largely due to the high dollar exchange rate.[5]\n\nIn 2014, EMC sales amounted to $24.4 billion, an increase of 5% year-on-year. In 2013, revenue rose by 6%, in 2012 - by 8%. The company's net profit fell from $2.89 billion in 2013 to $2.71 billion a year later. In terms of share, earnings decreased by 1% to $1.32.\n\nOne of the main reasons for the fall in EMC revenues was the expensive dollar, which for an American company reduces the cost of contracts previously concluded with foreign customers in local currency. In the fourth quarter of 2014, due to currency fluctuations, EMC did not count $115 million with total revenue of $7 billion. In 2015, the vendor estimates a similar damage at $550 million, but hopes to increase the dynamics of sales growth to 7%.\n\n840px\n\nHigh Dollar Reduced EMC Profit by 6%\n\nIn 2014, EMC made an operating profit of $4 billion, while a year earlier it recorded a financial indicator of $4.2 billion. The costs of organizing sales of products reached $5.7 billion, general and administrative costs - $8 billion, investments in research and development - $3 billion.\n\nIn the revenue structure of EMC for 2014, equipment sales brought the company about $14.1 billion, and the service business - $10.4 billion.\n\nEMC Information Infrastructure finished 2014 with a 2 percent revenue growth of $18.2 billion, where most of the revenue ($16.5 billion; + 2% by 2013) came from Information Storage.\n\nEMC Emerging Storage sales jumped 52% to $2.3 billion in 2014, thanks to high demand for products such as EMC XtremIO SSD arrays, EMC software-defined storage systems ViPR and EMC Isilon scale-out NAS systems.\n\nUnified and Backup Recovery has increased revenue to 4% year-on-year than EMC VNX. In relation to the latter, EMC attracted 2,000 new customers in October-December 2014.\n\n2013: Revenue growth + 7% to $23.2 billion and layoffs\n\nTotal income for 2013 year amounted to 23.2 billion, dollars which corresponds to an increase of 7% year on year. Important components of this success were revenue growth of 5% year on year for EMC Information Infrastructure and revenue growth of 15% year on year, which VMware demonstrated and. Pivotal\n\nNet GAAP revenue recorded by EMC for 2013 increased by 6% year-on-year to $2.9 billion, and GAAP profit per weighted average diluted share was $1.33, representing an increase of 8% year-on-year. Non-GAAP2 net income recorded by EMC for 2013 was $3.9 billion, corresponding to a 4% annualized increase, and non-GAAP2 profit per weighted average diluted share was $1.80, corresponding to a 6% annualized increase.\n\nFor 2013 year, EMC recorded cash flow from operating activities in the amount of $ 6.9 billion and free cash flow in the amount of $ 5.5 billion, which corresponds to growth in 11% and 10% in annual terms, respectively. The company ended the year with $17.6 billion in cash and investments.\n\nEMC continues to restructure, and one of its elements has been downsizing. EMC will lay off 1,004 employees. This and many other measures are aimed at reducing the costs of the corporation. The plan provides for the release of resources for $80 million.[6]\n\nIn the first quarter of this year, EMC and VMware approved an action plan aimed at improving corporate efficiency. It reduces approximately 800 jobs, and last year EMC implemented its own restructuring program, resulting in a reduction of 1,163 jobs.\n\nThe implementation of the current restructuring and debt reduction programs will take no more than a year from the start. EMC says that despite the cuts, by the end of 2013, it will employ more people than at the beginning of the year.\n\n2012\n\nFin results of the year: Sales growth by 9%, profit by 11%\n\nThe company's revenue for the financial year 2012 reached $21.7 billion ($22 billion was expected in the company's forecast of January 30, 2012). This is 9% higher than the same result of the previous year. EMC GAAP net income rose 11% to $2.7 billion in 2012 (consistent with forecast), and GAAP weighted average earnings per diluted share were $1.23. This is 12% more than a year earlier. EMC's non-GAAP2 net income for the full year 2012 was $3.8 billion, up 11% from last year, and the non-GAAP2 weighted average earnings per diluted share were $1.70, up 13% from the previous year. Non-GAAP company results for Q4 and YoY include U.S. research and development tax credits for 2012.3\n\nIn 2012, EMC generated $6.3 billion in cash flow from operations and $5.0 billion in free cash flow, up 10% and 14%, respectively, from the previous year. In the fourth quarter and overall in 2012, EMC improved its GAAP and non-GAAP gross profit and core earnings from the previous year. The company ended the year with $11.4 billion in cash and investments.\n\nOn January 30, 2012, EMC announced the following plans:\n\nIt was assumed that the total operating profit for GAAP 2012 will be 17% of income, and operating profit not at - GAAP 24% of annual income. Non-GAAP operating profit calculations exclude compensation payments in the form of shares, amortization of intangible assets, costs associated with restructuring and acquisitions, as well as special payments and depreciation of software for VMware previous periods, which is less than 4%, 1.5% and 0.5% of income, respectively.\n\nProjected total non-GAAP operating costs in 2012, including return on investment, interest expense, and other costs, are $245 million, not $240 million for GAAP. Non-GAAP calculations exclude non-recurring operating costs and compensation payments in the form of shares in the amount of $5 million.\n\nExpected non-GAAP consolidated net income is $3.7 billion. EMC's non-GAAP consolidated net income does not include equity compensation, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring and acquisition costs, and special and prior-period VMware software payments and amortization of $650, 225, 90, and 30 million, respectively.\n\nConsolidated diluted earnings per share under GAAP in 2012 are expected to be $1.24 and consolidated diluted earnings per share under non-GAAP is $1.70. Non-GAAP consolidated diluted earnings do not include compensatory payments in the form of diluted earnings, amortization of intangible assets, and special payments and amortization of VMware software for prior periods of $0.30, 0.11, 0.04, and 0.01 per weighted diluted share, respectively.\n\nThe expected consolidated GAAP income tax rate in 2011 is 19%. Excluding the impact of non-recurring costs associated with restructuring and acquisitions, equity compensation payments, amortization of intangible assets, and special payments and amortization of VMware software for prior periods whose cumulative impact on income tax is 2%, the expected consolidated non-GAAP income tax rate is projected to be 21% in 2021.\n\nNet GAAP revenue from an uncontrolled stake in VMware in 2012 was expected to be $153 million, not $240 million for GAAP. Non-GAAP calculations do not take into account expected share compensation costs, amortization of intangible assets, and special payments and depreciation of VMware software for prior periods of $68 million, $11 million, and $8 million, respectively. The incremental dilution associated with EMC-owned VMware shares is expected to be $15 million in 2012.\n\nThe expected weighted average number of outstanding shares in 2012 is 2.175 billion.\n\nEMC planned to redeem $700 million of its own shares in 2012.\n\nBuying Pivotal Labs\n\nOn March 20, 2012, EMS announced the acquisition of privately owned Pivotal Labs, headquartered in San Francisco, California, USA. The amount of the transaction was not disclosed.\n\nFounded in 1989, the company specializes in creating rapid application development tools, the client base of the popular SaaS Pivotal Tracker solution has over 240 thousand users worldwide. Among them are startups, and large companies, including Twitter,,,. Groupon Salesforce.com\n\nEMS interest in Pivotal Labs stems from the growing need for its own customers to develop fast, efficient web applications for mobile devices, big data analysis, and cloud architectures. According to EMS, the problem of big data is particularly acute for most companies. The accumulated amount of information is not enough to be placed in a specialized storage such as Hadoop - it is important to be able to quickly extract business-relevant indicators and metrics. Now programmers will have at their disposal the Pivotal Labs methodology, open source tools, modern frameworks and the ability to use specialized integrated environments such as Ruby on Rails.\n\nThe methodologies developed at Pivotal Labs should complement the Greenplum Chorus Big Data Analysis Application Creation Toolkit presented on the same day. The concept of interaction between project participants laid down in it largely echoes Facebook and other social networks. As Bill Cook, president and general manager of EMS Greenplum, noted, his company began working with Pivotal Labs technologies back in 2011 as part of the Chorus project. Earlier in 2012, EMS introduced the Greenplum Unified Analytics Platform (UAP) to analyze structured and unstructured data.\n\nQ1: 11% Sales Growth\n\nIn the first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, EMC revenues grew by 11% to reach $5.1 billion, net profit - by 23% to $586.8 million, dividends - by 29% to 27 cents per share. This is the ninth consecutive quarter in which EMC shows double-digit revenue, profit, and dividend growth relative to data from a year ago.\n\nEMC CFO David Goulden said that by 2014, his company intends to increase annual revenue to $28 billion - a 13% increase compared to 2010.\n\nThe report identifies two key reasons for the positive dynamics: the increase in the amount of stored data in organizations and the growing interest of customers in cloud administration software. The developer of the latter is VMware, most of which is owned by EMC. The analyst of Sterne AgeeAleks Alex Kurtz considers the reason of progress of EMC not only good sales ON VMware, but also applications for SHD which got in inheritance from other absorbed companies. First of all, from the largest acquisition of Isilon in 2010 .\n\nRepresentatives of EMC say that the earlier forecast of profitability and profitability in 2012 is true, perhaps it can even be surpassed.\n\nAt the beginning of 2012, EMC's assets, in addition to Isilon and VMware, included the Data Domain storage developer, a provider of analytical tools for big data\",\" Greenplum a company specializing in information security RSA Security and a well-known player in the electronic workflow market. Documentum\n\n2011: Record sales and profits\n\nOn January 30, 2012, EMC reported record financial performance in the fourth quarter and overall for fiscal year 2011.\n\nThe results of FY2011 were marked by all-time record indicators of consolidated profit, net income and earnings per share, cash flow and free cash - all of them exceeded the preliminary forecasts indicated by the company.

The company ended the year with $10.8 billion in cash and investments.\n\n\"EMC ended 2011 with high and record highs. Without a doubt, cloud computing is completely transforming the IT industry, and big data can have just as profound an impact on our work and life. Our customers take these transformations into account and benefit from EMC's strategy and best-of-breed solutions to unlock the full potential of their information assets, \"says Joe Tucci, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of EMC.\n\n\"In 2011, we again succeeded in our financial\" triple game \"- at the same time we increased market share, invested in business growth and increased profitability.
