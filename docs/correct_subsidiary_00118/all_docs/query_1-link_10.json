        "text": "OpenText has acquired Dell EMC's enterprise content division, including Documentum for $1.62 billion.\n\nUnder the terms of agreement, the software, associated services and employees of ECD will be integrated into OpenText.\n\nOpenText CEO and CTO Mark J. Barrenechea noted in a statement that the acquisition \"further strengthens OpenText as a leader in Enterprise Information Management, enabling customers to capture their digital future and transform into information-based businesses.\"\n\nWaterloo based OpenText Corporation has completed its acquisition of Dell EMC’s enterprise content division, also purchasing the Documentum brand for $1.62 billion USD in cash and stock.\n\nWith the closing of the acquisition, OpenText sees 5,600 customers, 2,000 employees, and 300 partners onboarded to its Enterprise Information Management platform.\n\nAside from Documentum, OpenText also acquires the InfoArchive and LEAP product families in the acquisition. All of these brands will be integrated into OpenText, bringing the company’s total employee base to more than 10,000.\n\nEMC acquired Documentum in 2003 for $1.7 billion. The enterprise content platform was renamed several times: CMA (Content Management and Archiving Division, EMC), IIG (Information Intelligence Group), ECD (Enterprise Content Division.) But most people still stubbornly called it Documentum.\n\nDocumentum was always an odd fit for EMC and never moved the needle for it in terms of either innovation or hardware sales. As Marko Sillanpaa, co-founder of the Big Men On Content blog and former EMC and Documentum employee, put it, the synergies between Documentum and ECM were just never realized.\n\nEMC planned to sell its Documentum business as part of a plan to shed assets before its takeover by Dell in 2016.Both EMC and Dell are eager to reduce the debt burden that will result from their pending $67 billion merger.\n\nDocumentum is an enterprise content management platform, now owned by OpenText, as well as the name of the software company that originally developed the technology. EMC acquired Documentum for $1.7 billion in December, 2003.\n\nThe Documentum platform was part of EMC's Enterprise Content Division (ECD) business unit, one of EMC's four operating divisions.\n\nOn September 12, 2016, OpenText, a Canadian technology firm based in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada that specializes in enterprise content management, announced a definitive agreement to acquire Documentum from Dell EMC for $1.6B USD.\n\nDocumentum was founded in June 1990 by Howard Shao and John Newton.They had worked together at Ingres, one of the leading relational database vendors at the time, and sought to solve unstructured information management problems using relational database technologies.\n\n(Unstructured information refers to information that does not have a formal data structure – documents, images, audio, video, etc.) With initial backing from Xerox, they developed a customized system for Boeing to organize, store, maintain, and selectively publish the thousands of pages of information for the Boeing 777 training manuals.\n\nThey developed another customized system for Syntex, a pharmaceutical vendor, to automate the process of assembling New Drug Application (NDA) documents when seeking approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nDocumentum introduced its Electronic Document Management System (EDMS) in 1993, a client-server product for electronic document management. This product managed access to unstructured information stored within a shared repository, running on a central server. End users connected to the repository through PC, Macintosh, and Unix Motif desktop client applications.\n\nDocumentum EDMS provided check-in/check-out access controls as well as workflow capabilities for sequencing document review and approval processes, and included a full-text search engine for retrieving documents from the repository. EDMS was adopted by several large enterprises, such as pharmaceutical, oil and gas, financial services, and manufacturing companies.\n\nIn 1998, Documentum launched its Web Application Environment, a set of Internet extensions for EDMS, offering Web access to the documents stored within an EDMS repository.In 2000, Documentum released Documentum 4i, its first Web-native platform.\n\nBeyond just managing documents for print or electronic distribution, Documentum 4i could integrate with external Web applications and be used to distribute content to portals, Web application servers, and Web sites.\n\nA number of third party applications are based on Documentum.\n\nIn 2002, Documentum launched Documentum 5 as a unified enterprise content management (ECM) platform for storing a virtually unlimited range of content types within a shared repository.\n\nThe platform provided integrated business process management (BPM) capabilities as well as tools for managing content across a distributed organization."
