        "text": "Today, in any organization, content management has become a tedious task as a lot of content is getting produced daily. Whether it is managing some content or making its lifecycle a fruitful pitch for the company, IT professionals have to engage a lot of their time in doing it the right way. In order to overcome the challenges faced with traditional content management techniques, Documentum has been introduced over time.\n\nThe organizational content can emerge from different sources such as CRMs (Customer Relationship Management) or ERPs (Enterprise resource planning). Hence, we can simply term Documentum as a panacea to manage every kind of digital content used in the organization. Using Documentum also helps in producing a more efficient decision-making process.\n\nDocumentum works as an Enterprise Content Management (ECM) program, which is used to store valuable content from all over the enterprise in a safe and secure place called a repository. Along with the storage units, it also provides ease of use for controlling and organizing files.\n\nYou can easily edit, recover, utilize, or retrieve any important information from anywhere and anytime you desire. Furthermore, it also helps in making your document secure from external and internal risk factors. Here, in this blog, we are going to have a brief look at the features, architecture, advantages, and disadvantages of this ECM platform termed Documentum.\n\nDocumentum Tutorial for Beginners\n\nIn this Documentum Tutorial, we will learn the following topics\n\nWhat is Documentum?\n\nAdvantages of Documentum\n\nDocumentum Architecture\n\nLayers of Documentum\n\nDocumentum Foundation Classes\n\nLife Cycles of Documentum\n\nWhat is meant by Web Services?\n\nFeatures of Documentum\n\nBenefits of Documentum\n\nWhat is Documentum?\n\nThe Documentum system was developed by John Newton and Howard Shao in 1990, in order to solve the unorganized content problem using relational database technologies. Originally, this system was developed for a company ‘Boeing’ (an aerospace Company) which has a large amount of data in the form of paper documents, information, and training manual.\n\nIts main function was to help the company in storing, maintaining, and organizing thousands of pages of information into a common repository.\n\nThe Documentum software also helps in converting paper-based documents into application-ready files allowing a user to save a lot of time, cost, and effort. Enterprise’s ECM system is used to manage the content from other applications from across the organization such as ERPs, CRM systems, and portals.\n\nFurthermore, Documentum provides insight into the organization, where you can easily view, edit, or update any document shared with you through the Documentum system.\n\nFor Example, if you are using the Documentum system to edit a file you can “check it out” provided no other member of the company is editing the file. It also blocks others from editing the same file if you are editing it. Moreover, you are also allowed to check out the previously made edits on the document and by whom those edits were made.\n\nFor us, the users, it looks like the system stores only one single file.\n\nHowever, Documentum does have all the previously edited versions of the file. You can also add a small comment mentioning what edits you have made, to differentiate the current versions from the previous ones. The current version of the ECM in the market is known as Documentum D2 16.4 released in 2018.\n\nIf you want to enrich your career and become a professional in Documentum, then visit Mindmajix - a global online training platform: \"Documentum Online Training\" This course will help you to achieve excellence in this domain.\n\nAdvantages of Documentum\n\nHere are a few advantages of using Documentum instead of any other Content Management Software.\n\nFlexible and Supportive Content Capabilities: Documentum’s most advanced ability includes workflow features, lifecycle, and auditing which can be used as per your requirements.\n\nThe Spreadsheets are controlled and organized: Its system is configured in such a way that it makes the creation and control of highly complex and important documents easier and simpler than any other CMS.\n\nPersonalized and User-Friendly: As it has the capability to adapt according to the requirement, it makes the interface very much user-friendly.\n\nHighly Configurable Documentation: It also has the feature of configuring documents according to the specifications provided.\n\nAdvanced Usability for Virtual Documents: This system helps in simplifying the use of virtual documents (i.e. a document containing parts of other documents from different authors), throughout the organization.\n\nEnhanced User Interface: Widgets and easy-to-use tools help in navigating the software faster.\n\nAutomated Features: A numbering system or naming a file are made automated which helps in reducing time and effort.\n\nSecurity: EMC enforces a high level of security as these files are kept safe in the software’s controlled repository and also organized.\n\nSmarter Display of Content: Documentum provides a smarter way of viewing content. It previews the content in thumbnail form, which helps in a search operation for any document.\n\nSearch Engine: EMC also has a search engine similar to the web search engine i.e. users can look for the file by looking for a certain keyword or phrase.\n\nWorkflow: Other than routing documents within the Documentum system, you can also communicate through Inbox. You can look at all the files you want and can approve or reject any file in the system.\n\nEvent Notification: EMC’s system also provides a real-time update notification which provides you with a notification for all the changes made in the documents and by whom these changes are made.\n\nDocumentum Architecture\n\nThe architecture of the Documentum consists of three basic stages namely:\n\nThe Client application\n\nDocumentum server\n\nRDBMS and File Systems\n\nImage source: onemanwrites.com\n\nClient Application\n\nDocumentum system architecture generally follows the architecture of a client/server model. This is the layer where the client performs operations such as editing, creating, and looking up the document.\n\nHere in this layer, we can interact with the server layer i.e. the content server in order to get our task done. The client side sends a request to carry out the task such as editing a file on the server or retrieving a file and the server gets the task done.\n\nDocumentum server\n\nDocumentum Content Server is a new kind of content server that was designed to simplify the task of creating or editing by using any of the Documentum applications. This server handles the read and writes tasks for web-based client applications.\n\nThe server uses HTTP or HTTPS protocol for all communications. The logic from the application layer is transferred to the server and then calls are made using server APIs (DFC – Documentum foundation classes) to the particular repositories.\n\nRDBMS and File System\n\nRDBMS (Relational database management system) is a software developed for storing a large amount of data efficiently. The application layer performs various operations on the RDBMS. These operations can be easily accessed programmatically by an individual.\n\nSituated at the bottom layer of architecture, the RDBMS and Operating system combinedly handle every request provided by the content server layer. It then stores valuable information, in the form of tables, in a relational database.\n\nLayers of Documentum\n\nThere are four layers of the Documentum Platform. Let's have a look at these layers below:\n\nServices Layer\n\nThe Documentum content server is staged at the base of the Documentum platform which helps in managing the repository and implementing the core content capabilities. The content server then helps in availing these capabilities to the user with the help of the interface layer.\n\nImage Source: opensenselabs.com\n\nThe Content repository uses a flexible model to store data and the associated metadata. The documents are made of content files having attributes (metadata). These attributes are collected as metadata which describes the content and the relationships between the content and other contents stored in the repository.\n\nThese metadata are then used by the user to search and retrieve the content relevant to their uses. The content stored in the particular repositories can be encrypted by the user in order to protect the data from any uncontrolled access.\n\nInterface Layer\n\nThe interface layer is used by the web server clients to create a link and communicate with the content server and the content repositories. It is also known as the data link layer. This layer determines how data bundles are packed and transmitted through the network. IEEE 802.2 and X.25 are some of the common link layer protocols on which the layer commonly operates.\n\nThe interface layer consists of the Documentum Foundation Classes (DFC) and many standard APIs (application programming interface), which are used to control and access all of the functionality of the Documentum system. These APIs collectively known as the Documentum application programming interface (DAPI), can be accessed even from the host of applications.\n\nImage Source: unodc.org\n\nClient Layer\n\nClient layer as explained before consists of the basic application and software for client usage. These applications are used to access the Documentum repository. It includes end-user interfaces, administrator tools, and integrations with popular authoring tools and enterprise applications such as Documentum desktop or WebTop.\n\nImage Source: undoc.org\n\nThe components of the client layer are built on content management services available from the lower layers of Documentum architecture. The components in applications, that are built, can be common for other applications as both the web-based applications and Microsoft Windows-based applications access the same dictionary from the repository.\n\nApplication Layer\n\nDocumentum’s application layer provides the integration of content servers with enterprise applications. It also offers several products that provide a collaboration of content management systems with the application layer. Here are some products:\n\nDocumentum Content Services for SAP\n\nDocumentum Content Services for Siebel e-Business Application\n\nDocumentum Content Services for Lotus Notes Mail\n\nDocumentum Content Services for Portals\n\nThe link is provided with the help of content services which gives the power of all the Documentum functionality to the user.\n\nFor example, a customer care executive using SAP or CRM application can check the customer's details, like the bill amount, the customer's segment, usage, and personal details including the phone number, and address, instantly. Other than the executive, their project manager can review the operations and procedures with a single click on the report.\n\nDocumentum Foundation Classes\n\nDocumentum foundation classes, as mentioned in the interface layer, form a higher-order of API providing all the functionality of Documentum. DFC can be defined as a cluster of Java classes that can make the functionality of the Documentum server available to you by implementing a set of attributes.\n\nThe DFC can be used in the following ways:\n\nAccessing the functionality of Documentum.\n\nCustomize the products of Documentum such as WebTop.\n\nYou can execute the operation by writing a method or procedure to the content server as a part of the life cycle.\n\nIntegration of Documentum application with third-party applications.\n\nDFC is based on Java, and it can easily integrate with the client programs that function on Java. In order, to run DFC API you must have a Java virtual machine (JVM) program on your system. The DFC can either be a machine that runs the content server or it can be a middle-tier system i.e. application developed with the help of a web development kit (WDK).\n\nDocumentum Business Objects\n\nDocumentum Business Object Framework (BOF) is an object-oriented framework that can be built into DFC in order to develop a custom application. BOF in DFC has the capabilities of :\n\nExtending and enhancing the core functionality of Documentum\n\nModify or add the types and behaviors of the existing Documentum.\n\nIt also allows the client to add new attributes dynamically.\n\nBOF provides the developer with the option of installing the BOF modules dynamically and directly on the storage. It allows you to use the application without adding any custom JAR files manually into each application. The dynamic usability of the BOF module also provides you with the ability to update any module directly into the repository without shutting down the application.\n\nThe reusability factor of the BOF module gives you access to its modules in any type of DFC-based Documentum application. i.e. you don’t have to create a new module for every application. This feature reduces time and effort and helps the user in building the solution faster.\n\nImage source: emc.com\n\nWhen you create a new module in the repository system, it creates a folder named dmc_module to denote the modules. The implementation of JAR files is then linked to the particular module in the module folder.\n\nLife Cycles of Documentum\n\nA lifecycle in Documentum states the different stages a document goes through during the ‘lifetime’ of that particular document. The lifecycle of Documentum gives an idea of how the changes are made in any document as it progresses through its lifetime. A lifecycle in Documentum also provides you with a notification indicating when the document gets approved by calling the custom codes and performing specific operations.\n\nIt can also automate the operations on a document for example if you want to reflect the approval_date of a particular document, a lifecycle state extension can easily automate the operation.\n\nLifecycles are created and maintained for usage in any document with the help of the Documentum developer studio. Lifecycles are stored in dm_policy as objects in the docbase. However, only one lifecycle can be attached to a particular document. The r_policy_id attribute and the r_current_state attribute are maintained to store the document’s lifecycle and its current state respectively.\n\nWhat is meant by Web Services?\n\nThe DFC and BOF provide developers with the binding of custom-made business logic that is referred to as the Web Services of Documentum. These custom logic are responsible and are used to call the functions on another document across the internet or in any organization i.e. intranet.\n\nFor example, SAP in any organization’s system can communicate with the help of Documentum web services. This functionality of a content management system provides you with a vast variety of knowledge in the form of data and information. This feature also provides you with a broader understanding of the organization such as the productivity or growth of any enterprise.\n\nThe main goal of web services is to provide a one-stop shop for enterprises by combining a bunch of systems into one easy-to-use service and making the system mono-lingual i.e. one language SOAP (simple object access protocol). This way it allows us to understand multiple systems and their functionalities using only one interface.\n\nIn order to develop these web services over the Documentum API, developers have to work with their respective toolkits and applications. These web services are then implemented over the web servers providing their functionalities to desktop applications or any web applications.\n\nDocumentum Web-Based Applications\n\nThere are several Web-based applications that provide you with access to several different repositories. Some of these Web-Based applications are :\n\nDocumentum WebTop\n\nDocumentum Administrator (DA)\n\nDocumentum xCP\n\nDocumentum D2\n\nMy Documentum\n\nDocumentum Microsoft Windows-Based Applications\n\nThe Documentum Microsoft Windows-based applications work only in the offline mode on the system. It also provides you access to multiple repositories.\n\nSome of the popular Documentum Microsoft Windows-based applications are mentioned below:\n\nDocumentum Desktop: it also provides third-party integration to various Microsoft products such as\n\nwindows explorer\n\nMicrosoft Office\n\nMicrosoft Outlook\n\nAuthoring Integration Services (AIS): this is a Documentum system that works on both Windows and Macintosh systems.\n\nImportant Products of Documentum\n\nHere are some of the important products of the Documentum system:\n\nCaptiva IEC\n\nCaptiva OEM\n\nXpression Enterprise Edition\n\nXpression Documentum\n\nDocumentum Platform\n\nDocumentum D2\n\nApplicationXtender\n\nDocumentum xCP\n\nEnergy & Engineering Solutions\n\nDocumentum WebTop\n\nEMC Documentum WebTop or web desktop is a Web-Based Documentum or client application. WebTop consists of web services, web applications, client-server applications, and many more. Web desktop is similar to the environment provided by the Mac OS, Microsoft, or Linux/UNIX-based systems.\n\nHowever, in Web Desktop the web applications, files, configurations, and operations, all the functionalities are performed over the network.
