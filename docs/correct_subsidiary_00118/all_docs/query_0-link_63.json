        "text": "Another year, another EMC World. There are a few things I am tracking that promises to make this year interesting. I can’t really share yet, but trust me, you’ll want to stay tuned.\n\nWe are still a week away, but it is going to be an incredibly busy week for me, so I want to get this out now. For those that are unfamiliar, I pretty much type notes at every sessions and hit publish at the end of the session, essentially sharing my session notes with you. These rules are very similar to last years Rules (I even cut-and-paste for a draft), but I’ve updated a bit as I do every year.\n\nAll “live” posts that follow these rules will start EMC World 2011:. This is to clearly identify them for everyone. If I write a post before/during/after the conference that doesn’t adhere to what I am laying-out here, it won’t have that prefix.\n\nDisclaimers\n\nI’m going to be running a basic disclaimer in all my posts. If for some reason I forget to paste it in, this disclaimer applies to all EMC World 2011: prefixed posts and you can be sure I’ll be adding the disclaimer as soon as I notice that it is missing. This is because I will be writing the posts during/after sessions and I will hear things that I may misconstrue or that talk about future events.\n\nAll information in this post was gathered from the presenters and presentation. It does not reflect my opinion unless clearly indicated (Italics in parenthesis). Any errors are most likely from my misunderstanding a statement or imperfectly recording the information. Updates to correct information are reflected in red, but will not be otherwise indicated.\n\nAll statements about the future of EMC products and strategy are subject to change at any time due to a large variety of factors.\n\nAs indicated, if I learn later that something I posted was incorrect, I will endeavor to correct it, but it may not be immediate.\n\nTopics of Conversation\n\nAs a general rule, if I, or the person I am talking to at the time, has a beverage in their hand, I’m not blogging/tweeting it. If it is blatantly clear that the information is public, I will share it in a constructed post during, or shortly after, EMC World.\n\nThe issue here is that I am a longtime partner of EMC/Documentum. As such, I am sometimes privy to information that is not made available to the general public. This information is used to serve my clients better. If I started sharing this information, then I would no longer be able to learn any of it in the future. That information is by far more important any benefit that I may gain by posting it here.\n\nThis is a fun little line that I have to walk, but I think I’ve walked it well. There are several EMC personnel that have shared information with me since I started this blog and subsequently tweeting. I have, to date, kept all confidences and will continue to do so in the future.\n\nTwitter\n\nI will be using Twitter some during EMC World. You can follow me at @piewords. You can also follow all the Momentum 2011 action at #mmtm and all of the EMC World action at #emcworld.\n\nMost information will be going here, into my blog. Random thoughts and where I am going (in my annual quest to maintain my caffeine levels) will be mostly through Twitter. If you don’t have my phone number to text me, your best bet to locate me at EMC World will be through Twitter.\n\nThe Time Delay\n\nI am a busy person at the conference. As such, not all posts will be tagged immediately as I will be focusing on getting them posted and moving to the next session. Have no fear, the tags will come.\n\nI will also be updating my EMC World page of links only once every day. While it is a good index of what I have written, it will not be definitive until after the conference is over and I have time to update it. I will try and add links from other blogs, but that is also time dependent.\n\nThat’s it…See you there!"
