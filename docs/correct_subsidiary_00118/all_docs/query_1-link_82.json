        "text": "Solix EDMS is one of the only ILM Solution delivering integrated Database Archiving with EMC Documentum\n\nSunnyvale, California — November 8, 2007 – Solix Technologies, a leading global provider of information Lifecycle Management (ILM) solutions, today announced that its Solix EDMS 4.0 has received the “Designed for EMC® Documentum®” accreditation, a mark of quality and value that customers can depend on in enterprise applications. The “Designed for EMC Documentum” accreditation demonstrates that Solix EDMS 4.0 has successfully met a comprehensive set of criteria for solid design and quality integration.\n\nSolix EDMS 4.0 extends the Documentum content management platform so customers can leverage a single enterprise content management system that manages data retention and archiving policies across all data types and content types. Solix offers existing EMC Documentum customers the ability to add archived database data to their Documentum repository to leverage their existing investments. Having a single solution for managing archived data, storage and retrieval in a common active archive repository improves operational efficiencies, lowers total cost of ownership and helps companies maintain compliance. Solix EDMS with EMC Documentum adds database data, reports, documents and attachments from business applications such as Oracle, SAP, Siebel, JD Edwards and Peoplesoft to the customers’ Documentum repository\n\nSolix’s unique approach for leveraging a central metadata repository with distributed administration to manage many applications and data types simplifies management, lowers costs and reduces risk associated with multiple installs for every application and server. This central metadata repository and management console can be installed with the Documentum Content Server or on a dedicated server for those customers just looking for an ILM solution for their database applications. Customers have the choice to either archive data to Solix’s central archive repository or to EMC Documentum. Users can then access archive data through native application interfaces or through the EMC Documentum end user application.\n\n“EMC’s position as the leader in enterprise content management is strengthened by the support of great partners such as Solix,” said Randy Ziegler, Director of Developer Programs at EMC Corporation. “Partners like Solix build solutions and applications on the Documentum platform because customers have demonstrated their trust in EMC Documentum to manage their most critical and strategic information. The accreditation program is another way EMC earns that trust while supporting innovative offerings like Solix EDMS 4.0.”\n\nSolix EDMS integration with EMC document management solutions is part of a centralized, policy driven data management schema for data retention. “Retaining and securing data out of production systems ensures data viability beyond the application lifecycle for business continuity, compliance, eDiscovery, regulatory needs and reduces cost of maintaining legacy applications. This integration brings together the two worlds of structured and unstructured data,” says Sai Gundavelli, Founder and CEO of Solix Technologies, Inc.\n\nSolix received design accreditation by joining the Designed for EMC program; a program designed to help ISVs, VSPs and SIs design, develop and go-to-market with successful offerings based on the EMC Documentum platform. As a member, Solix received specialized design consultation and guidance, along with access to dedicated content management technical resources. Partners can submit their offerings to be considered for the “Designed for EMC Documentum” accreditation – which if achieved, signifies to customers that the offering meets high standards for architectural compliance with Documentum practices and will provide a reliable integration with less uncertainty for joint customers.
