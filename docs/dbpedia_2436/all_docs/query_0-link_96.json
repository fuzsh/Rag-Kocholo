        "text": "Featuring Toni Morrison's Beloved and Myself and Marco Polo by Paul Griffiths. The following dissertation proposes the emergence of a new genre in the mid-1980s period: the New Historical novel; as uniquely defined within the broad panorama of Post Modernist Literature as Magic Realism and Metafiction. I would also like to propose that its emergence and popularity is a manifestation of a crisis within the notion of genre itself and can be viewed against the wider anxieties of modern culture. Each of the novels looked at address issues relating to Foucault’s concept of the ‘heterotopia’ and the processes by which reality is constructed socially and history is produced. I have focused on two novels: Myself and Marco Polo (1989) and Beloved (1987).\n\nNarrative Desire and Historical Reparations: Three Contemporary British Authors By Timothy S. Gauthier Dr. Beth Rosenberg, Examination Committee Chair Associate Professor of English University of Nevada, Las Vegas British novelists since Walter Scott have exhibited an interest in history, but this discursive affinity has transformed itself into a veritable obsession in the fiction of the last two decades. Indeed, a concern with and distrust 0/ history and historiographic projects is often hailed as a defining characteristic of postmodernism. And while writers of &quot;new historical novels&quot; cannot be said to form a movement as such, the predominance of such texts reveals the presence of communal concerns, and a readily identifiable strain of literary production that addresses the circulation of mutual symptoms, beliefs, and anxieties as a response to living in this particular moment in history. Adopting and adapting the theories of Hayden White and Peter Brooks, 1 highlight var...\n\nIn this thesis, Christy Lefteri’s The Beekeeper of Aleppo (2019) and Victoria Hislop’s Those Who Are Loved (2019) are studied from a New Historicist approach. The thesis starts with an introduction that briefly studies the representations of historical events in historical accounts. It also includes a comparison between Old Historicism and New Historicism. Additionally, the major arguments of New Historicism are applied such as “the textuality of history,” “the historicity of texts,” the relationship between the texts and the cultural and biographical backgrounds of the authors. “Subversion” and its “containment,” and other arguments are discussed. The different types of historical novels and their qualities are mentioned. The introduction is finalized with information about the writers’ backgrounds, the time of writing, and their connections to Syria and Greece as British authors. This thesis aims at analysing the novels from a New Historical perspective as a contribution to the studies that aim to reveal the differences between representing historical events in historical fiction on the one hand and the representations of the same events in typical historical accounts on the other. Chapter one includes a study of the representations of stories and experiences of the Syrian refugees of the civil war of 2011 in historical accounts and in The Beekeeper of Aleppo. This study is carried out by analysing the information and documentation provided by historical accounts and the ways of conveying the events in the novel. Points like the “subversion” and its “containment,” “the historicity of texts” are to be studied through the stories of refugees in the novel. Chapter two focuses on the zeitgeist of historical events and its importance by analysing the representations of politics, Greek society and other major incidents of 1940s Greece in Those Who Are Loved. However, a study of the representations of the same events as represented in historical accounts is also undertaken. This study discloses the features mentioned earlier in the New Historicist arguments. Chapter three is a comparison of the two novels and the writing techniques of the writers. The similarities and differences between the novels are examined. This study aims at introducing the qualities of representations of historical events in historical fiction novels. Besides that, the main reference points of New Historicism are discussed in this comparison. The conclusion summarizes and states the importance of the qualities of historical fiction novels."
