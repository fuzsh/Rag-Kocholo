        "text": "‘The Gustav Sonata’ by Rose Tremain (2016) – 240 pages\n\nI have been a devotee of Rose Tremain’s fiction for over twenty-five years. First I read ‘Restoration’ and ‘Sacred Country’, then went back and read two of her earlier works ‘Sadler’s Birthday’ and ‘The Swimming-Pool Season’, and I have continued to read her novels and stories up to today. I even seem to recall that she used the pen name Rosemary Tremain early in her career.\n\nWhy have I been drawn to Tremain’s fiction? Her writing has the qualities that I much appreciate in a fiction writer. Her writing is perceptive, empathetic, methodical, unsentimental, and precise, and yet she can also be light-hearted and even humorous. She can deal with complex moral situations and capture the poignancy of the lives of people dealing with them. She is also quite unpredictable as to what she will write about next, so her novels come across as new and exciting.\n\n‘The Gustav Sonata’ is another fine example of Rose Tremain’s work. At the center of this story is the father Erich Perle who is a policeman. However he is fired for falsifying dates on forms so that Jewish people who were escaping Austria in 1938 could stay in Switzerland. So this man gets fired for an act of courage for which he should have received a medal. That is life.\n\nErich dies soon after his firing. He leaves a wife Emilie and a small son Gustav. Emilie blames the Jewish people for Erich’s death, and she remains an anti-Semite long afterwards. However her son Gustav becomes best friends with a Jewish boy Anton starting at age five, a friendship that continues throughout their long lives. Emilie and Gustav are very poor, while Anton’s family is quite prosperous, so they take Gustav along on their family trips. Gustav has a positive steadying influence on the more anxious, temperamental Anton.\n\n‘The Gustav Sonata’ is divided into three major sections. The first section takes place in the late 1940s when Gustav meets his new friend Anton. The second section goes back in time before Gustav is born and describes how Erich and Emilie meet and wed. The last section takes place in the 1990s when Gustav and Anton are in their late fifties, Gustav running a small hotel and Anton a music teacher.\n\nAnother quality I like about Rose Tremain’s writing is that she is adept enough to only deal with the parts which are important to her story so we don’t have to waste a lot of time covering these people’s entire lives.\n\nI will end with what John Boyne wrote in the Irish Times:\n\n“In fact I have long considered her (Rose Tremain) to be the finest British novelist at work today, more consistent than McEwan, more prolific than Ishiguro, and less erratic than Amis, although the title is more frequently accorded to one of those three (no surprises here) men.”\n\nI agree.\n\nGrade: A\n\n‘The American Lover’ by Rose Tremain stories (2015) – 240 pages Grade: A-\n\n‘The American Lover’ is a varied convincing group of stories by one of our world’s better novelists. I don’t want to oversell it. This book did not change my life. But this collection of stories did not disappoint at all, and that is a lot to say about any work of fiction. Rose Tremain is more a novelist than a story writer, and these stories are not the main point of her career. However each of these stories is well-written and has an impact of its own.\n\nThe range of these stories is wide in time and place. In one story the main character is Mrs. Danvers, the housekeeper in Daphne DuMaurier’s ‘Rebecca’. In another story which takes place in a Russian village, one of the main characters is Leo Tolstoy.\n\nThe first story, the title story, is about a transgressive first love during the 1960s in which a young woman falls deeply in love with a guy who takes her to Paris where he gets her to have three-way sex with a transvestite. (These stories are not for the squeamish.) The affair runs its course, but ten years later she is still haunted by him.\n\nOne story, one of my favorites, is about a couple who escape their hell-raising daughter and her ‘crazy never-ending carnival of woe’ by retiring to a peaceful summer cabin in Canada along the waters of Lakes Superior.\n\nTremain is very good at mixing lighter moments with tragedy needing only a few sentences to separate them. That is one of the reasons I appreciate her novels as well as her stories. Both comedy and death are a part of life, and these stories have their share of both.\n\nAnother poignant story is ‘Lucy and Gaston’ about an English woman who lost her husband who was a pilot during the Normandy invasion, and a young Frenchman who lost his father. Somehow Tremain can conjure up a new time and place for each story using just a few words.\n\nIt is a good thing that Rose Tremain has not succumbed to the current fad of writing for a younger audience. Her stories are by and for adults, and she does not shy away from disturbing topics.\n\nI was very taken with Rose Tremain as a fiction writer early in her career with my interest peaking about the time she wrote ‘Restoration‘ and ‘Sacred Country’. I thought she could do no wrong. However after that there were a couple of novels including ‘Music and Silence’ and ‘The Colours’ that did not work for me. I stopped following her work for awhile. However I happened to read ‘Trespass’, and I’m happy to say I consider that novel a return to form. ‘The American Lover’ is a continuation of her return."
