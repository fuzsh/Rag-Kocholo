        "text": "I haven’t read Rose Tremain for 8 years since I discovered her via her 1989 publication “Restoration”. I absolutely loved it and it ended up in my Top 3 books for 2013. For some reason I’ve not got round to her novel from a decade later “Music & Silence” which I have had on my shelves for some years. On reading the description of this, her latest and 16th novel, I felt it was time to revisit her as an author.\n\nNineteenth century settings are always going to win me over. We start with an abandoned baby in an East London park at night and wolves who chew off her toe. She is rescued by a Police Constable and taken to the London Foundling Hospital. This is the story of the first 17 years of Lily’s life.\n\nSubtitled “A Tale Of Revenge” we know from early on that guilt hangs over the young girl. She sees herself as a murderer but we don’t know who or why. The story is told in a third person narrative from her past and her present as a 17 year old employed as a wigmaker. Some of these switches are a little abrupt I felt which tended to jar rather than build up the suspense as intended.\n\nI was totally captivated by Lily’s story. I really enjoyed the author’s writing style, use of language and ability to bring Lily’s world to life with some great characterisation. It did, however, feel a slighter more understated work than I was expecting, plot-wise it hovers towards the sentimental and predictable and I felt disappointed that some plot-lines fizzled out. Since finishing the book I read an interview with Rose Tremain in The Daily Telegraph Review section (30/10/21) where it is described as a recovery novel following a pancreatic cancer diagnosis which has led to her not being able to retain as much historical research as she has in the past which might explain the route she decided to take with this book. She also says an initial inspiration came from hallucinations from drugs she was taking or anti-nausea which conjured up Victorian type children asking her for help.\n\nI relished the writing and story-telling here. It’s not going to end up in my end of year Top 10 like “Restoration” but I was certainly rooting for Lily throughout."
