        "text": "I read it ages ago and remember enjoying it although I struggle to recall much of it in detail now. Am planning to to reread it soon though, before buying Merivel, the sequel.\n\nI wouldn't compare RT to Philippa Gregory really - IMO she's a more literary and varied writer. Music and Silence is really good, and for a quite different style of novel I'd recommend The Road Home too.\n\nThanks, the reason i am going to continue is because i loved The road home and i liked Sacred country and Trespass. He is just not a likeable character, he does seem like a bit of a loser. Its hard to believe Rose Tremain is now 69 and she has had so many novels written before she became so well known.\n\nInteresting that you liked Trespass - that was one of my least favourite of her books. Partly because of the unappealing characters in it too.\n\nI'd persevere with Restoration. It wasn't the main character I particularly liked, but I really enjoyed her evocation of the period.\n\nIncidentally, if you meet RT you would never think she was approaching seventy - she looks, dresses and generally appears about 15 years younger.\n\nI read it some time ago - but agree the first section is a bit stale. It does liven up quite a bit when he becomes part of the royal court. And that's when it gets funnier, too. I enjoyed it overall and finished it.\n\nI loved it and it does get better. The bit where he is still with his wife is the kind of 'plateau'. Then everything changes suddenly and gets very different. I found the end v heart-warming\n\nvery happy to find this thread, my hub and i rarely read the same books but this is one of his favourites, so maybe i should get the others mentioned here and tickle him back in to my world of fiction..\n\nI love Restoration, but, like everybody says, it perks up substantially once you get beyond the first bit. please persevere, I love it and find the ending very moving. is it meant as a religious allegory at the end by the way?\n\nHi again, I am almost finished it as i have to say it did get so much better. I was going to give up on it as i rarely leave a book unless it really annoys me. Once he met Kathernine and worked with Pearce,he really redemed himself .He is still a strange fella though. I do love Historical fiction but have to admit i have not read anything around this time for years. I like books mostly set in the last century."
