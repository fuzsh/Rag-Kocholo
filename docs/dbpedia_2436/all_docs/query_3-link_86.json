        "text": "In the serene, sunbathed sitting room of her Georgian house in Norwich, Dame Rose Tremain is reliving the pain-racked weeks she spent in hospital in the autumn of 2019, after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. “I had the Whipple operation, where they take half your gut away really. When I asked the oncologist later on how long can I expect to live, he said, ‘Well, there isn’t much data on this because not many people survive this Whipple operation’. But he tentatively suggested between two and five years. I’ve done the two, will I do the five? Watch this space,” she says matter-of-factly.\n\nThose odds might have slightly improved had Tremain undergone chemotherapy, but she refused after she was told that side effects might include numbness in her feet and hands. “I thought, I won’t be able to walk and, worse, I won’t be able to work. That would be a purgatory.”\n\nIt’s the only choice you could imagine her making; writing has been at the centre of Tremain’s life since she published her first novel, Sadler’s Birthday, 45 years ago. Since then she’s scooped most of the big prizes – the Orange, the Whitbread, the James Tait Black – and helped rescue historical fiction from critical scorn with her acclaimed novels about the ebullient 17th-century physician Robert Merivel, who debuted in the Booker-shortlisted Restoration (1989).\n\nNow she’s publishing Lily: A Tale of Revenge, the novel she began during her recovery. Tremain would not have lived to write it were it not for the skill of her surgeon, Mr Siong-Seng Liau – the sole person thanked in the acknowledgements – but there is another sense in which the book owes its existence to her time in hospital.\n\nUnable to keep food down, for several days she was given an intravenous anti-nausea drug, cyclizine. “It gives you astonishing hallucinations. There was this repeating one: I would close my eyes and see these kids, often rather fantastically dressed in strange bonnets and things, clustering round me in my bed, and they’d be kind of expecting something, looking at me as if to say, ‘When?’ I’d open my eyes and they’d go and then I’d close my eyes and they’d come back again. And always with this look of great expectation: ‘Rose, are you going to help us?’ It’s completely crazy, it’s just the mind in a suffering mode, but you remember a thing like that. And I think all of that fed into this book.”\n\nIn Lily, set in the mid-19th century, the children in need of help are the residents of Coram’s Foundling Hospital. The eponymous Lily is taken to Coram’s as an infant after being abandoned by her mother and then farmed out to a family in the country, where she enjoys an idyllic early life. Then, with no warning, aged six, she is returned to Coram’s to learn how to be a good, God-fearing citizen, and is told to forget the existence of her foster family.\n\nThis was standard practice at the real Coram’s. “The intention may have been kind but the reality was very cruel, sending them away to households where they were often well cared for and then suddenly back to the workhouse, which is what that place was really. The whole ethos there was: nobody loved you, your mother gave you away because you were the product of her sin, and the only hope you have is to work hard and love God, which strikes me as a terrible formula for a life.”\n\nLily, unwise enough to stand up for herself, suffers terrible abuse. “Maybe it has something to do with having much-loved grandchildren now, but the fact that there are still institutions where children are abused and bullied… lots of things make me angry but that makes me really insane with anger. It’s often religious institutions that do it – ie those with the supposedly greatest moral heft. There’s a nice anti-religious thing going through this book,” she says with a grin.\n\nDespite her precarious health, one would have guessed Tremain to be an unusually vibrant and well-preserved 60; in fact, she’s 78. Everything she says is blunt and unsentimental, but her manner is wonderfully warm and welcoming. She repeatedly interrupts herself to commentate on the antics of a squirrel visible in her sumptuous garden. She points out four bay trees that she has christened the Merivels, in honour of the horticultural interests of her most famous character. “He is completely real to me.”\n\nTremain lives here with her partner of 30 years, the biographer Richard Holmes. “He was fantastically helpful as my first reader [for Lily], mainly, as I remember it, paring down, simplifying, getting the language to have a kind of arrow-like trajectory. I wanted a very sparse, unemphatic language: it’s not like Restoration, a great teeming, orchestral hoo-ha of a piece – it’s quieter, more like a little prelude. I often read historical fiction where I think, actually, the style the writer’s found is not appropriate to the story they’re trying to tell.”\n\nLily, in addition to its pellucid prose, is shamelessly gripping. We know from the start that the adult Lily will one day commit an act of heinous revenge for her childhood miseries, although Tremain, who does not plan her books, did not know for a long time what form it would take. “You need to work out as you go along what the reader will be hoping for and dreading – what the film people I’ve worked with call” – she adopts a Californian accent – “the hope-dread axis.”\n\nThere was a stage in hospital when Tremain wondered whether she would ever be able to write again – “my hand-eye coordination went completely, I couldn’t sign my name, I couldn’t even work the keys on my phone” – and she admits that her memory won’t retain quite as many fat volumes’ worth of historical research as it used to. But she wasn’t fazed when she began working on Lily. “I don’t think there’s ever been a moment where I think: I’m capable of this, or this. There’s always an inquiry going on: can I do this? Shall I try this?”\n\nI ask Tremain if she drew on her own childhood, which she revisited in her 2018 memoir Rosie, in writing about Lily’s. “My childhood was complicated because it was materially quite comfortable but emotionally a bit arid except that I had the wonderful Vera, my nanny. It was extremely lucky that my parents, who couldn’t be bothered to look after us, hired somebody who loved us.” (Herself and her sister, Jo.) In the novel Lily’s foster mother, Nellie, owes quite a lot to Vera, or “Nan” – “She has the same eternal patience, and a tenderness without being cloying.”\n\nTremain’s father abandoned the family when she was 10, and her mother – “she was a bit broken-hearted” – rapidly remarried. The newlyweds decided to leave London, and thus Tremain, like Lily, underwent a great dislocation. “My sister and I lost Nan, our home, our school, our friends, everything. It felt just absolutely weird. We found ourselves not at the Coram Hospital, thank God, but at this slightly second-rate boarding school.”\n\nThe young Tremain found solace in writing plays. “I discovered that actually writing about people unlike myself, displacing my imagination into other people’s lives and inventing things, was tremendously consoling. And I thought, well, this is actually how I’d like to spend my life. And so when it looked for a few days like it might be curtains [in hospital], I thought, at least I haven’t wasted my time. I’ve lived through writing for 40 years, which is all I ever wanted to do.”\n\nBut although “one of the prime fascinations of writing” has always been “placing myself in the sensibility and body of people unlike myself” – the protagonist of her first novel was a 77-year-old man – that presents problems these days. Other central characters have included a transgender man in Sacred Country (1992) and an eastern European immigrant in The Road Home (2007), but thinks she would not get either book published today.\n\n“I remember thinking at the time, there’s only a limited time in which a writer like me can do this, and then what will happen next, what needs to happen, is that those people write their own stories. I’m just not sure where any of this leaves a writer like me. Maybe I should just be quiet and stop. I would like next, if there is a next, to write something contemporary, but it means treading through treacle.”\n\nFor the moment, for the first time in more than 60 years, she’s working on a stage play – “going back full circle to where I started at school”. She quotes Tom Stoppard’s view that playwrights have to be braver than novelists because they experience the audience’s reaction in person.\n\nIs she already thinking about how to cope with the terrors of the first night? She gives a battle-hardened laugh. “I’m beyond those terrors. Just don’t put me back in hospital again. That’s my terror.”\n\nLily: A Tale of Revenge by Rose Tremain is published by Viking at £18.99"
