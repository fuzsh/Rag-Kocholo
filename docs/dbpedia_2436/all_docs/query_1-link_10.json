        "text": "Born in London, Tremain, 78, published her first novel, Sadler’s Birthday, in 1976. In 1989, Restoration was shortlisted for the Booker prize and went on to become a film and a play. Her awards include the 1999 Whitbread novel of the year for Music and Silence, and the 2008 Orange prize for fiction for The Road Home. Last year, she published her 16th novel, Lily. She lives in Norfolk with her husband, the biographer Richard Holmes, and has a daughter.\n\nWhen were you happiest?\n\nWhen I first met Richard, in 1992, on a British Council writers’ tour of Adelaide. We were drinking Australian lager while parakeets squawked rudely in the neighbourhood gumtrees.\n\nWhat is your greatest fear?\n\nWe live in a fearful age: Brexit, Covid, global warming, cancel culture, war in Ukraine. Add in pancreatic cancer and you find me in an advanced and complex state of anxiety.\n\nWhich living person do you most admire, and why?\n\nMeryl Streep. For all her truthful and perfected offerings that have taken me to an “elsewhere”, in which my mind could feel both soothed and stimulated.\n\nWhat is the trait you most deplore in yourself?\n\nThe only drink I really, really like is champagne.\n\nWhat is the trait you most deplore in others?\n\nTalking in cliches. We have the most economic, resonant and versatile language in the world, yet so many people use it in a dull and boring way.\n\nWhat was your most embarrassing moment?\n\nBeing told to take my mother out of a restaurant because she was drunk.\n\nAside from a property, what’s the most expensive thing you’ve bought?\n\nA cream suit from Chanel that cost almost as much as a small car.\n\nWhat is your most treasured possession?\n\nA cat with the embarrassing name of Fluffy.\n\nWhat makes you unhappy?\n\nAny suffering in my family. If my grandson, Archie, gets in the least bit upset, I stop breathing.\n\nWhat do you most dislike about your appearance?\n\nI’m 78. I dislike everything.\n\nIf you could bring something extinct back to life, what would you choose?\n\nThe 1960s.\n\nWhat is your most unappealing habit?\n\nPutting Velcro rollers in what my mother called my “hopeless hair”.\n\nWho is your celebrity crush?\n\nI’m slightly in love with Ben Fogle. I admire his courtesy and his strong brown legs. But I wish he would say “wow” a bit less.\n\nWould you choose fame or anonymity?\n\nAnonymity, but touched with just enough success to keep me from existential despair.\n\nWhat do you owe your parents?\n\nVery little. My father I hardly knew and my mother hardly bothered to get to know me.\n\nWhat does love feel like?\n\nLike coming home.\n\nWhat did you dream about last night?\n\nBeing put down like a dog. Except that I called to death and it never came.\n\nWhat is the worst job you’ve done?\n\nWorking as the assistant to an agony aunt on a women’s magazine. When we didn’t get enough heartbreaking letters, we made them up.\n\nWhat has been your biggest disappointment?\n\nThe film of Restoration. A beautiful cast. An award-winning designer. A massive budget. A dog’s dinner."
