        "text": "This novel is very much about the questions, What do I want from life? Who am I?\n\nWhen we first meet Mary, she is six and standing in a field with her family trying to hold a two minute silence for the King:\n\nAnd then, hearing the familiar screech of her guineafowl coming from near the farmhouse, she thought, I have some news for you, Marguerite, I have a secret to tell you, dear, and this is it: I am not Mary. That is a mistake. I am not a girl. I’m a boy. (6)\n\nMary is very careful about who she shares her secret with. It’s no wonder her first choice for confidante would be her hen Marguerite: ever since Timothy’s birth, her parents have not been particularly interested in her, and her father (who never wanted a daughter) has become hostile towards her. She’s an odd child who thinks a lot and tries to make sense of the world around her as best as she can. She chooses a new name for herself, Martin, and begins to dream about her future life as a boy, which she is sure will come.\n\nSacred Country spans several decades, from 1952 to 1980, and is set mostly in rural England, but in part also in Nashville, Tennessee. The central characters are, first of all, Mary / Martin and her family: Estelle (her mother), Sonny (her father), Timothy (her baby brother), and her grandfather Cord. There’s also the local butcher family, most importantly son Walter Loomis and his uncle, Pete. And then there’s Irene with Pearl (her daughter out of wedlock) and Billie (her son with Edward Harker). The book is written, in part, in the voices of several of these characters. SPOILERS AHEAD.\n\nA few years pass. Mary, after being beaten by Sonny, comes to the conclusion that Timmy is the reason her mother is unwell. She decides to poison Timmy in his sleep (50-52) and is severely beaten again. The following summer, 1957, she is sent to her grandfather’s house while her mother is in a sanatorium (Mountview). Cord, her grandfather, turns out to be a careful and respectful listener. When Mary asks to be called Mary Martin – like the actress Cord likes -, or Martin for short, Cord has no problem with that. This exchange a little later suggests Cord has an inkling this is more than just a child’s fascination with names:\n\nI didn’t understand what ‘moving inwards’ meant and Cord said: ‘Well, no, I don’t expect you to, Martin, not at your age, but later when you’re in your proper life, you will.’ I said: ‘Do you mean, when I’m Martin Ward?’ ‘You are Martin Ward,’ said Cord. (56)\n\nEdward Harker, maker of baseball bats, is another person important to Mary. Because he believes in reincarnation, he is open to the idea that a person might feel like a different person – a different gender – inside. He himself believes he was a nun in a previous life, and that “Souls have no gender. You could have been a man, Mary. Or again, you might have been a marmoset.” (77)\n\nThese confidences happen five years after Mary’s initial realization. As time passes, Mary grows, and as much as she hopes that her skin will get tougher and she will become a boy, this does not happen. To her dismay, puberty sets in. By 1961, unsettled with the changes, she is binding down her chest to hide her shame. Timmy, in a rare moment of wanting to confide in Mary, finds her bandages and tells Sonny. His reaction is violent (117-8).\n\nSonny pushed her away and she fell onto the gritty paments of the kitchen floor. She struggled to find the two sides of her shirt and close it. Sonny kicked her thigh. ‘You are an abomination,’ he said. ‘That’s what you are.’ He kicked out again with his boot, then Mary heard him walk out of the kitchen and slam the door behind him. She thought, now it’s over. Except that it isn’t. It’s now that it all begins. (118)\n\nMary runs away. Afraid that she would ‘do him harm’ with her shameful truth, she decides she cannot go stay with Cord, so she asks her former teacher, Mrs. McRae, to take her in, which she does. She will stay there for some time. To Mrs. McRae, she is Mary, never Martin. Mrs. McRae only knows that Mary was physically abused by Sonny, but doesn’t learn the reason for his hostility: Mary is too afraid that she, too will reject her.\n\nA while later (1967), Mary has moved to London. She finds a job, a lover, and information about her condition – that there are others like her, and that there are ways her life as a man could actually happen. In a meeting with a psychiatrist, while she lies about her parents being dead, she opens up about her strained relationship with Sonny:\n\nI said that I thought men used their strength to annihilate women, as my father had tried to annihilate me. I said: ‘If I’d let myself be a true girl in my childhood, I would have been destroyed.’ (202)\n\nThis is a tricky point in the book: should we read this to mean Mary only identifies as male out of self-preservation? It is true that in the world young Mary lives in, boys are preferred: her parents dote on Timmy while her father becomes violent towards the girl Mary. However, Mary’s explanation to the psychiatrist leaves out a central point of the definition of manhood she holds: man as the protector rather than the aggressor. In her dreams of her future life as Martin Ward, her role as protector (of Pearl) is the focal point, even if she herself does not realize this until later (353). Being a man can look like Sonny, or like the unhelpful doctor, but it can also look like Cord and Harker.\n\nWhile Mary figures out ways to live as Martin Ward, Walter Loomis figures out that he cannot fulfill his family’s expectations of taking over the butcher shop. He also figures out the difference between a crush and love. He goes to Nashville to live his dream as a country singer, rhinestone jacket and all. Timmy gives up on his swimming dreams, realizes he cannot spend the rest of his life as a farmer, and finds his true calling, as well as a wife. Pearl tires of being called beautiful. She also gives up her dream of becoming a dental nurse in order to marry Timmy and become a mother. Sonny drinks more and more, only talks to his dog, and finally, when it becomes clear that Tim and Pearl will not take over the farm, he shoots first the dog, then himself. He wants so much to have a son who is willing to take over the farm he took over from his own father – the irony here is that if he’d only been able to accept Mary as she was, if he’d only been able to accept Martin, he might have had that son.\n\nEstelle, in the meantime, watches television. Lots of it. She lives vicariously, passively, and waits for Mary to return. When Sonny kills himself, she goes to live with her aging father, Cord. Cord takes Estelle aside and finally tells her about Martin.\n\nI didn’t speak. Cord was never like Linda. He didn’t make you talk when you didn’t want to. I sat there, eating chocolate biscuits. After a long time, I said: ‘Were we the cause? Sonny and me?’ Cord shook his head. He said: ‘You, of all people, know that certain things appear to have no cause. They just are and that’s it.’ (358)\n\nTimes change, and so does treatment at Mountview: when Estelle goes there again in 1980, she is expected to talk to a therapist (‘questioner’ in Estelle’s mind). The therapist asks lots of questions, which annoys Estelle, but does get her to think:\n\n‘Yes?’ says Linda. ‘Tell me about that. Who was there?’ ‘Well,’ I say, ‘the four of us. Sonny and me. Timmy and…’ ‘And who?’ ‘And Martin,’ I say. ‘I don’t know anything about Martin. Who is Martin?’ ‘My other child,’ I say, ‘He lives in America. He’s not in my life. I haven’t seen him for twenty years.’ ‘Why?’ says Linda. I say, ‘God, you’re tiring us out with all this questioning.’ (361)\n\nMary, fully living as Martin, has found a place for himself in Nashville, doing odd jobs on a judge’s farm. He is content, though not happy, because what he truly wanted – to be Pearl’s lover and protector – is now impossible. He refuses further surgery, because without any chance of a life with Pearl, he feels he won’t need it. Maybe he is also in a way punishing himself, after the ugly scene when Pearl told him about her engagement to Timmy: Mary / Martin’s violent outbreak almost feels like a rape (311).\n\nIn the end, after Cord has passed on and she is on her own, Estelle finally becomes active: she writes a brief letter to Martin, asking forgiveness. She does not specify what for – but then, there is much that needs to be forgiven: her passivity and refusal to intervene on her child’s behalf, to protect young Mary from Sonny’s wrath. The book ends here, leaving us as readers to imagine how Estelle’s request will be received.\n\nI’ll be honest and say that reading this book was emotionally taxing. At the same time, it was a true pleasure, because it really drew me into its world. The character of Mary / Martin is so complex – her mind, her reasoning, her violence, passion, and confusion. I apologize for using both she and he when referring to this character – throughout the book, Tremain uses ‘she’ to refer to them, even when it’s Martin. I’m still thinking about that. What that means.\n\nThis book is beautifully written, and it follows its cast of characters patiently, respectfully as they decide who or what they will be. Unlike Walter’s landlord, who warns him not to trust Bentwater Bliss (who has made himself Walter’s agent), the book does not pass judgment – it just listens. Bentwater does not, in fact, betray Walter’s trust. Instead, he unwittingly introduces him to the background singer who then becomes his wife, Sky. Mary also judges – herself, for her secret, with her father’s words, assuming everyone else will think of her the same way, only to find, in the end, not all of them do. Pearl cries when Mary / Martin tells her, and explains she is crying for Mary, whom she loved and who will be lost when Martin is fully realized. At the same time, she respects the decision, calls Martin by his chosen name, and when she hears about the mastectomy she offers to come care for Martin when he gets out of the hospital.\n\nThe book also pays attention to details that just feel right, like, for instance, Walter’s experience when he first arrives in Tennessee. He remarks about the light being different, the sky, his eyes having to get used to it. Lots of small things to discover along the way, as these characters’ stories develop. I’m glad I read this book."
