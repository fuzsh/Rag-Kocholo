        "text": "\"Copenhagen. 1629,\" declare the first words, after the title, of Rose Tremain's Music and Silence. In its opening chapter, the young English lutenist Peter Claire arrives at the court of King Christian IV of Denmark. He is to join the royal orchestra. While one main thread of the story will concern his love for Emilia, servant to Queen Kirsten, the novel hums with other stories: of the lonely king, brooding on his childhood; of his marriage-sick queen, with her illicit love affair; of Emilia's strange family and its secrets.\n\nTremain has used the Danish court to bring together a family of stories. She does this in a novel of considerable formal ambition, which includes both first- and third-person narratives, exploits many shifts of time and viewpoint, and allows narration to move between past and present tenses. Place and time must hold together its sheer narrative variety. However remote the historical world it imagines, we must believe in it.\n\nThis special exercise of the novelist's imagination has often been deprecated. Henry James believed that the very attempt to conjure some historical past sapped the belief of a reader in the speech and the thoughts of any character. You could not get into the mind of a person from the historical past: \"You may multiply the little facts that can be got from pictures & documents, relics & prints, as much as you like - the real thing is almost impossible to do, & in its absence the whole effect is as nought; I mean the invention, the representation of the old consciousness, the soul, the sense, the horizon, the vision of individuals in whose minds half the things that make ours, that make the modern world were non-existent.\"\n\nIn Music and Silence, Tremain gives little attention to the clutter of \"little facts\". As if in the teeth of James's precepts, it is all in the minds of her characters. She pushes her setting beyond any evident connection with the present. History allows her to create a self-enclosed world.\n\nThe great Hungarian literary theorist Georg Luk√°cs championed historical fiction because, he said, it revealed, at its best, \"the great crises of historical life\". He loved Walter Scott for his rebellions and revolutions and epochal clashes of ideology.\n\nHere, however, such history happens off stage. The Reformation, the advancement of scientific knowledge, the religious wars of the 17th century: you feel the influence of these, but only distantly or accidentally. The one set-piece description is of the Battle of Lutter in 1626, when the Danish army was beaten by that of the Catholic League. Yet this is narrated at a tangent to history. The king, we discover, is still possessed by grief at the death in the battle of a boyhood friend. Only because of this does he give his lover an account of the military disaster, one forced from him by horrified, guilty recollection. Any research (the military historian John Keegan appears in the novel's acknowledgments) is transfused into character.\n\nDenmark in the early 17th century is designedly a place cut off - surrounded by water, mostly shrouded in cold. (The chill seeps in to every corner of the novel, noticed in the subtle accumulation of small particulars.) It is also a place from books, and the novel cunningly stirs literary associations. With King Christian in his court - a renaissance prince grappling with new intellectual freedom, while all the time manipulated by his adulterous wife - we think of Hamlet. Elsinore indeed features, albeit just as the place where Christian's rich, parsimonious mother gets the muddy flounders that are her staple diet.\n\nThis is also the country of Hans Christian Andersen, and Tremain's historical fiction edges into fairy tale. The characters seem to yearn to belong to fables. Old Queen Sofie devotes herself to her cellar full of long-hoarded gold, desperate to do nothing but keep it hidden. The Irish Earl O'Fingal, kind husband and father, spends his days trying to transcribe a beautiful melody heard in a dream and turns into a mad misanthrope. Magdalena, the stepmother of Peter Claire's beloved Emilia, dedicates herself to taking possession of her new family with a mixture of culinary skill and sexual power. Emilia calls her a witch, and this is not so fanciful.\n\nAs in the memorable opening, where a lamp gutters in the palace gloom, this is a place where dark and light are set against each other. One of the novel's strategies is to risk contradictory versions of a historical setting. The king reads Descartes and talks of being a modern man. He would like to abolish serfdom. Yet his adulterous queen worries that, if her plots against him are discovered, she will be \"locked away in some Dungeon for the rest of my years, or else be burned as a Witch\". Is this her fearful fantasy, or do such things still happen in Denmark? We are not told. The historical world created in the novel answers Jamesian scepticism by making a past that is particularised but remote - concrete and strange."
