        "text": "Damn, girl! Sarah Hyland has amassed a large net worth after 11 seasons on Modern Family, multiple movies and TV gigs and endorsement deals. How does the A-lister make her money?\n\nWhat Is Sarah Hyland’s Net Worth?\n\nThe New Yorker is a full-fledged millionaire with a net worth of $14 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth, which she earned before her 30th birthday in November 2020.\n\nShow business is definitely in the Manhattan native’s blood. Her parents, Melissa D. Canaday and Edward James Hyland, are both actors, and Sarah started doing voiceover gigs and commercial work when she was just a kid. She was accepted into the prestigious Professional Performing Arts School in Manhattan in sixth grade and began her on-screen acting career in the 1997 film Private Parts.\n\nHer resume was already stacked with A-list costars, like Kathy Bates, Kristin Chenoweth and Paul Rudd, by the time she moved to Los Angeles at 18. Just two weeks after settling down in the West Coast, she landed a starring role as Haley Dunphy on My American Family, which would soon morph into Modern Family.\n\nHow Much Was Sarah Hyland Paid on ‘Modern Family’?\n\nIn 2012, Sarah and the rest of the kids on the booming sitcom negotiated salary increases to $70,000 per episode. The See You in Valhalla star got another pay bump to over $100,000 per episode in 2017. To give you an idea of how much Sarah was raking in, each season of Modern Family has over 20 episodes, meaning the actress was making upwards of $2 million every year. Um, wow!\n\nThe longtime sitcom ended in April 2020 after over 10 years. In November 2023, Sarah reunited with the rest of the Modern Family stars, sans Ty Burrell, at Sofia Vergara’s home for the very first cast reunion.\n\nHow Does Sarah Hyland Make Money Now?\n\nSarah still has a lot going on in her career. She not only starred as Mara in 2019’s The Wedding Year, but she was also an executive producer. She has also been working with Emily V. Gordon, writer of The Big Sick, on an untitled TV project.\n\nLike any ~modern~ star, Sarah also has multiple brand partnerships with companies like Bounty, AfterPay, Hasbro, Rooted Rituals and Bitten Dressing that she promotes on her social media pages. Considering she has over 10 million Instagram followers, it’s safe to say she’s getting a substantial paycheck. The Geek Charming star also has an entrepreneurial spirit and is the co-founder and creative director of Sourse, a vitamin-infused chocolate brand.\n\nSarah has been singing her whole life but took her talents center stage by releasing “Met at a Party” with Jordan McGraw in 2019 and recently appeared as a guest judge on Ru Paul’s Drag Race. Fans were ecstatic when it was announced in June 2022 that she would bring her talents to Love Island USA as the host during season 4.\n\nAdditionally, the Vampire Academy actress landed one of the starring roles in the Pitch Perfect spinoff series, Pitch Perfect: Bumper in Berlin, in March 2022. The show – which also stars Adam Devine, Diana Birenyte and Jameela Jamil – premiered in November 2022 on Peacock."
