        "text": "Better Things, interview with actress of TV series Rebecca Metz\n\nRestaurants on the Edge, interview with chef Nick Liberato\n\nWorking with Zac Efron, Adam Devine: interview with actress Sugar Lyn Beard\n\nCinema / Interview - 23 April 2020\n\nMike and Dave Need Wedding Dates is the movie with Anna Kendrick, Zac Efron, Adam Devine\n\nSugar Lyn Beard is an actress and producer. She works in Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates (2016), Sausage Party (2016) and 50 e 50 (2011). The new film is Eat Wheaties!\n\nIn the movie \"Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates\" you play Jeanie Stangle. What did you like about this character?\n\nI fell in love with Jeanie very quickly. I loved that everything she did and her reactions to everything happening around her was all coming from a place of love. When she asks her brothers to bring dates to her wedding, she's almost sorry she has to asks because she loves her brothers just the way they are - but she really doesn't want her wedding to have any 'accidents'. When Mike runs over her face, she's never mad at him, she forgives him with out a second thought. Jeanie is a Stangle - she loves hard.\n\nJake Szymanski is the director. How did he interact with the actors?\n\nJake was kind, hilarious and incredibly generous. He took time with every actor before we started to sit together one on one and get on the same page, so that we could have a solid say on who we wanted our characters to be. He always wanted to hear our thoughts first, and made sure we were heard. He felt like another character in the movie... he would shout the funniest lines for us to say and just kept upping the funny. Jake is a gift. During takes, he would laugh the hardest, compliment the most, and was excited everyday to be making this movie. His energy was incredibly infectious and he set a tone of complete joy on set. I love that dude.\n\nOn set, what was the funniest moment with the other actors, Zac Efron, Adam Devine, Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza?\n\nI think one of the funniest scenes to shoot was when the four of them run in to Jeanie's bridal suite, after everything terrible has happened, and announce they've come to some realizations and want to fix everything that's gone wrong. They are such movie starts those four... and so funny. They were improving the funniest things and I got to just sit there and in the scene and watch... we laughed so much that day!\n\nYou also work in TV. What kind of character would you like to play on a TV show?\n\nI would love to play someone fearless, someone discovering themselves, someone who can be an example of being free in their quest to find their true self. Also someone very very funny. I always like to play against type - so the leader of a mob would be great. Or a drug lord.\n\nWhat do you like to do with your day?\n\nPaint. I feel like it's been years since I've had time to really paint. I would love to take a week, escape to a tropical island with a gorgeous man, and just paint and eat everything delicious and hike and swim and eat some more and paint... wait, what was the question?\n\nWhat's your prefered book?\n\nPrufrock and Other Observations by T.S. Eliot. It was a gift from someone special, it's timeless, and I find having it with me a comfort.\n\nÂ© All right Reserved\n\nBetter Things, interview with actress of TV series Rebecca Metz\n\nRestaurants on the Edge, interview with chef Nick Liberato"
