        "text": "Shelley Lee Long was born at 7:15 am on Tuesday, August 23, 1949 in Indian Village, Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA, the only child of Ivadine (Williams), a schoolteacher, and Leland Long, a teacher who had previously worked in the rubber industry. Shelley attended school at Kekionga Junior High for grades 6-9 and at South Side High School for grades 10-12. She enrolled at Northwestern University in 1967 as an undergraduate studying drama. Her first job was at the university as a meal plan checker. She left Northwestern to pursue a dual career in acting and modeling. She also had a brief marriage to her first husband that ended in divorce. In Chicago, she became a member of the celebrated Second City troupe, in addition to writing, producing and co-hosting a popular Chicago magazine program called \"Sorting It Out\" in 1975. The show ran for three years on a local NBC station and won three Emmy Awards for Best Entertainment Show.\n\nShe met her second husband, Bruce Tyson (a securities broker), on a blind date in 1979. They were married in October, 1981. In 1982, she played the character Diane Chambers in the new NBC comedy series, Cheers (1982). She played the part for five years, winning an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series in 1983, winning Golden Globe Awards for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series in 1983, for Best Actress in a Comedy Series in 1985 and a Quality TV Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series in 1986. She gave birth to a daughter, Juliana, on March 27, 1985. On her summer hiatus from \"Cheers\", Long made feature films, receiving a Golden Globe nomination as Best Actress for Triple Trouble (1984). In 1987, she starred in the hit comedy Nichts als Ärger mit dem Typ (1987) with Bette Midler. Soon after, she left \"Cheers\" after five years to embark on a film career. However, her films Hello Again: Zurück aus dem Jenseits (1987) and Die Wilde von Beverly Hills (1989) were not hits, and she returned to television appearing in the final episode of Cheers in 1993. That same year, she appeared in her own television series \"Good Advice\" (1993) which was canceled. She returned to feature films playing Carol Brady in the Die Brady Family (1995). The film became a hit and spawned a sequel, Die Brady Family 2 (1996), which wasn't a hit. She returned to television playing the title role in \"Kelly Kelly\" (1998), which was canceled after a few episodes. She also played Diane Chambers a few times on \"Frasier\", the spinoff of Cheers. Her personal life took a huge blow when her husband divorced her in 2004 after more than 20 years of marriage. She recovered and continued on with her career, appearing in guest-starring roles on television, including a recurring role on Modern Family (2009). She supported her daughter Juliana Long Tyson's decision to follow in her footsteps as an actress. She also encouraged Juliana to get married, which she did in 2015, to management consultant Ryan Kissick. Shelley herself never remarried after her two divorces but continues to work in television.\n\nElizabeth Banks was born Elizabeth Mitchell in Pittsfield, a small city in the Berkshires in western Massachusetts near the New York border, on February 10, 1974. She is the daughter of Anne Marie (Wallace), who worked in a bank, and Mark Phineas Mitchell, a factory worker. Elizabeth describes herself as having been seen as a \"goody two-shoes\" in her youth who was nominated for the local Harvest Queen.\n\nBanks left home to attend college at the University of Pennsylvania--from which she graduated Magna cum Laude--and went on to attend the Advanced Training Program at the prestigious American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, graduating in 1996. She then moved to New York and worked in the theater, and began getting small roles in films and on television. Seeking more screen work, she moved to Los Angeles and was soon cast in supporting roles. She also had to change her last name, to Banks, in order to avoid confusion with actress Elizabeth Mitchell.\n\nHer breakthrough role was as Betty Brant, the secretary of the cantankerous newspaper tycoon in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man (2002). She followed up this performance with small roles in other movies: Stürmische Liebe - Swept away (2002), Steven Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can (2002), Seabiscuit - Mit dem Willen zum Erfolg (2003) and Jungfrau (40), männlich, sucht... (2005). In 2003 she won the Exciting New Face Award at the Young Hollywood Awards. The winsome, beautiful Banks projected an exceptionally charming screen presence that drew comparisons to Audrey Hepburn, and Hollywood eventually began to take notice, Banks being cast in the lead in such films as Kevin Smith's Zack and Miri Make a Porno (2008) and in Oliver Stone's biopic of George W. Bush, W.: Ein missverstandenes Leben (2008), as Laura Bush.\n\nIn television, Banks was a recurring guest star on Scrubs: Die Anfänger (2001) as Dr. Kim Briggs, the love interest of Zach Braff's J.D. In 2010 she was cast as Alec Baldwin's love interest in season four of 30 Rock (2006). Originally scheduled to appear in only four episodes, she was brought back as a recurring character for two more seasons, and earned Emmy nominations for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for two consecutive years. Elizabeth has also appeared in such films as Our Idiot Brother (2011), Ein riskanter Plan (2012), Was passiert, wenn's passiert ist (2012), Zeit zu leben (2012), and Pitch Perfect - Die Bühne gehört uns! (2012). She also won the coveted role as Effie Trinket in Die Tribute von Panem - The Hunger Games (2012) and Die Tribute von Panem - Catching Fire (2013).\n\nAfter an eleven-year courtship, Banks married Max Handelman, a sports writer and producer, in 2003. They have two sons, Felix, who was born in March 2011, and Magnus, born in Nov. 2012, both by gestational surrogacy.\n\nNathan Fillion was born on 27 March 1971 in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. He is the son of Cookie (Early) and Bob Fillion, both retired English teachers, and has an older brother, Jeff. His father is of French-Canadian descent, and his mother is of English, German, Finnish, and Norwegian ancestry. In Canada, he attended Holy Trinity Catholic High School, Concordia University College of Alberta and University of Alberta. Before moving to New York City in 1994, he participated in improv theatre, including Theatresports with Rapid Fire Theatre and improvised soap opera Die-Nasty. He also appeared in a TV Movie Absturz in die weiße Hölle (1993) starring Richard Chamberlain and in Strange and Rich (1994).\n\nFillion's first regular role was on a daytime soap opera, Liebe, Lüge, Leidenschaft (1968), as Joey Buchanan, for which role he was nominated in 1996 for a Daytime Emmy Award. He left the series after three years in 1997. During the late 1990's, he appeared in small roles in the films Der Soldat James Ryan (1998) and Eve und der letzte Gentleman (1999). Fillion also guest starred on Das Bootie (1997), Mama's Got a Brand New Bag (1998) and Starcrossed (1999). His biggest break by then happened in 1998, when he was cast as Johnny Donnelly on the 2nd season of Ein Trio zum Anbeißen (1998) opposite Traylor Howard, Ryan Reynolds, Richard Ruccolo and Suzanne Cryer. He starred on the show for 60 episodes.\n\nAfter \"Two Guys\" ended in 2001, Fillion gained critical acclaim and a large cult of fans when he starred as Captain Malcolm Reynolds on the Joss Whedon's Firefly: Der Aufbruch der Serenity (2002). Unfortunately the show was prematurely canceled in late 2002. He also guest starred on several episodes of two short lived TV shows, Das Geheimnis von Pasadena (2001), as Rev. Glenn Collins and Kate Fox & die Liebe (2003), as Adam Logan. In 2003, Whedon gave Fillion another chance to display his range when he cast Fillion as the twisted preacher Caleb, a villain, in the final season of Buffy - Im Bann der Dämonen (1997). Before and after \"Firefly\", Fillion appeared in many movies, Wes Craven präsentiert Dracula (2000), Alligator Point (2003), Wicked Game - Ein böses Spiel (2003), Outing Riley (2004) and Hollywood Division (2004).\n\nWhedon vowed to resurrect \"Firefly\" in some way, and Fillion played Captain Reynolds again in the feature-film Serenity: Flucht in neue Welten (2005). Fillion followed this film with more big screen leading roles, in the horror-comedy Slither - Voll auf den Schleim gegangen (2006), in White Noise - Fürchte das Licht (2007), in the indie hit Jennas Kuchen - Für Liebe gibt es kein Rezept (2007) opposite Keri Russell and in Trucker (2008). He also continued to be a force in television, starring in the short-lived Fox-TV series Drive (2007) and appearing on a recurring role as Dr. Adam Mayfair on the 4th season of ABC's Desperate Housewives (2004), opposite Dana Delany. He also appeared on I Do (2006) and was a voice actor on many video games (e.g. Halo 3 (2007)).\n\nIn 2008, he took his first singing part (and cemented his cult appeal) as Captain Hammer in Whedon's musical Internet smash Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog (2008), with Neil Patrick Harris, Felicia Day and Simon Helberg. In 2009, he was cast as the title character Richard Castle in ABC's hit television series, Castle (2009). The show has aired more than 160 episodes and Nathan Fillion has won four People's Choice Awards for Favorite Dramatic TV Actor, as of 2016. In 2018, Fillion took the starring role in The Rookie (2018) as John Nolan, a contractor who starts over as a rookie police officer in the LAPD after a life-altering event. Besides starring on \"Castle\", he has appeared in many movies, in Super - Shut Up, Crime! (2010) as The Holy Avenger, in Joss Whedon's Viel Lärm um nichts (2012) as Dogberry, the incompetent chief of security, in Percy Jackson: Im Bann des Zyklopen (2013) as Hermes and in Thrilling Adventure Hour Live (2015).\n\nHis credits as a voice-actor are numerous: on Bright Lights, Dean City (2010) as Brown Widow, in Wonder Woman (2009) as Steve Trevor, in Green Lantern: Emerald Knights (2011), Justice League: Doom (2012), Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox (2013) and Justice League: Throne of Atlantis (2015) as Hal Jordan/Green Lantern, in Robot Chicken: DC Comics Special (2012) as Green Lantern/Mr. Freeze, on American Dad (2005), in Pixar's Die Monster Uni (2013) as Johnny, in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) as Monstrous Inmate and on Willkommen in Gravity Falls (2012) as Preston Northwest. He also voices the lead, Shojun in the animated movie, Yamasong: March of the Hollows (2017). He has also continued voicing characters in video games, such as in Destiny (2014) and in Halo 5: Guardians (2015).\n\nHe has also guest starred on The Daly Superheroes (2012) as himself, on Community (2009) as Bob Waite, on The Comic Book Store Regeneration (2015) as himself, on Twins (2015) as Mountie McMinniman, on Con Man (2015) as Jack Moore and on Space (2015) as Wernher Von Braun. He also narrated the documentary, Highway of Tears (2015).\n\nBronx-born and raised Chazz Palminteri was a natural choice to continue the Italianate torch in film. In the tradition set forth in the 1970s by such icons as director Martin Scorsese and actors Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, John Cazale and Joe Pesci, Palminteri has brought grit, muscle and an evocative realism to the sidewalks of his New York neighborhood, violent as they are and were.\n\nChazz was born Calogero Lorenzo Palminteri in 1952 in the Bronx, New York, the son of Rose, a homemaker, and Lorenzo Palminteri, a bus driver. He grew up in a tough area of the Bronx, giving him the life lessons that would later prove very useful to his career. He graduated from Theodore Roosevelt High School and started out pursuing his craft in 1973 studying at the Actor's Studio. He appeared off-Broadway in the early 1980s while paying his dues as a bouncer and doorman in nightclubs, among other jobs.\n\nIn 1986 he headed west and found that his ethnic qualifications was well-suited for getting tough-talker parts. Slick attorneys, unflinching hoods and hard-nosed cops were all part of his ethnic streetwise persona in such TV shows as Kampf gegen die Mafia (1987), Matlock (1986) and Polizeirevier Hill Street (1981). In films he started off playing a 1930s-style gangster in Sylvester Stallone's Oscar - Vom Regen in die Traufe (1991). Although his roles were sharp, well-acted and with a distinct edge to them, there was nothing in them to show that he was capable of stronger leading parts.\n\nIn 1988 he wrote for himself a play entitled \"A Bronx Tale,\" a powerful one-man stage commentary in which he depicted his bruising childhood in great detail, which included witnessing gangland slayings. Palminteri brought each and every character to life (18 in all) in this autobiographical piece -- his friends, enemies, even his own family. He showcased for years in both Los Angeles and New York, finally sparking the interest of his film idol, Robert De Niro. DeNiro, wanting to direct for the first time, saw the potential of this project and brought both it and the actor/writer to the screen. Palminteri played one of the flashier roles, Sonny, a gangster, in the movie version. An unknown film commodity at the time, Chazz had stubbornly refused to sell his stage property (the offers went into the seven figures) unless he was part of the package as both actor and screenwriter. DeNiro, who became his mentor, backed him up all the way, and the rest is history. In den Straßen der Bronx (1993), which featured his actress/producer/wife Gianna Palminteri, earned strong reviews.\n\nAt age 41 Palminteri had become an \"overnight\" star. Other important projects quickly fell his way. He received a well-deserved Oscar nomination the following year for his portrayal of a Runyonesque hit man in Woody Allen's hilarious jazz-era comedy Bullets Over Broadway (1994). He was on the right side of the law in both Die Perez Familie (1995), his first romantic lead, and then the classic crimer Die üblichen Verdächtigen (1995). He played the ill-fated brute in Diabolisch (1996) and wrote a second screenplay, Der Hochzeitstag (1996), in which he again plays a hit man, terrorizing both Cher and Ryan O'Neal.\n\nThough Palminteri was invariably drawn into a rather tight-fitting, often violent typecast, it has been a secure and flashy one that continues to run strong into the millennium. Surprisingly, the one obvious show he missed out on was HBO's Die Sopranos (1999). True to form his trademark flesh-lipped snarl was spotted in gritty urban settings playing a \"Hell's Kitchen\" cop in Hell's Kitchen (2001) starring actor/producer Armand Assante; a pool hustler and mentor in Poolhall Junkies (2002); a mob boss in In the Fix (2005); a dirty cop in Running Scared (2006); the titular scam artist as Yonkers Joe (2008); a karaoke-loving Italian psychiatrist in Once More with Feeling (2009); and an abusive husband and father in Mighty Fine (2012).\n\nOther millennium filming includes starring presences in Der Bodyguard - Für das Leben des Feindes (2007), The Dukes (2007), the title conman as Yonkers Joe (2008), Once More with Feeling (2009) and Mighty Fine (2012), as well as prime supports in Running Scared (2006), Kids in den Straßen New Yorks (2006), Push (2006), Jolene (2008), Last I Heard (2013), Legend (2015), Vault (2019), Clover (2020). TV crime continues to occupy his time as well, clocking in such series' credits as Kojak (2005), Rizzoli & Isles (2010) and Godfather of Harlem (2019). Occasionally he will lighten up -- as in his recurring role as Shorty on the popular sitcom Modern Family (2009).\n\nBorn in Salem, Oregon, Justin Kirk spent his childhood in Union, Washington, where he attended grade school on a Native American reservation. Kirk knew from the age of 3 that he wanted to perform, and he made his acting debut at seven in a local college play. At 12, he moved with his mother to Minneapolis, Minnesota, and attended the Children's Theater School throughout high school.\n\nAfter graduation, he moved to New York and enrolled at Circle in the Square, where he completed a two-year conservatory acting program. He soon landed his first role on Broadway, in \"Any Given Day\" at the Longacre Theater, and quit his job as a bellboy at the Royalton Hotel. He has been working steadily ever since and is perhaps best known for his portrayal of the blind character Bobby on Broadway and in the feature film adaptation of Liebe! Stärke! Mitgefühl! (1997). Kirk was honored with an Obie Award for Distinguished Performance in the Ensemble.\n\nAdditional stage work includes \"Old Wicked Songs\" at New York's Promenade Theater and Los Angeles' Geffen Playhouse, in which he starred as a piano prodigy, winning a Back Stage West Garland Award for Outstanding Performance. He also appeared in June Moon with the Drama Department, a theater company of which he is a founding member.\n\nA self-described radio nerd, Kirk divides his time between New York City and Los Angeles.\n\nDirect from Spartanburg, South Carolina, this tall, blonde actress has earned the respect of stage and film audiences alike for her many touching portrayals of matter-of-fact, down-to-earth Southern folk. For someone who first attracted attention as a hash-slinging replacement for Diane Ladd (herself a replacement for the ever-popular Polly Holliday) in the final, languishing years of the popular CBS sitcom Imbiß mit Biß (1976), Celia Weston certainly has evolved into one of the more sought-after character performers of \"Deep South\" film drama.\n\nBorn December 14, 1951, and raised in South Carolina, Celia, along with her sister, enjoyed creating their own little world of characters, acting out small skits and later began appearing in local plays. She did not, however, meet the unanimous encouragement of her family when the one-time art and psychology major at Salem College in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, decided to do an abrupt about-face and study acting. She earned an Artist Diploma in Drama at the North Carolina School of the Arts before moving to London to continue her training. More than determined, she eventually returned to the States in 1977 and studied with Uta Hagen and Herbert Berghof while slinging hash herself in New York City. In between, there was sporadic regional and off-off-Broadway work along with summer stock. At age 28, Celia made a big leap with her Broadway debut in \"Loose Ends\" (1979) starring Kevin Kline. Following her prime theater role in Edward Albee's \"The Lady from Dubuque\" in 1980 and a small part in Clint Eastwood's film Da steht der ganze Freeway Kopf (1981), Hollywood showed her the money when she became the new Southern-fried waitress in town alongside Linda Lavin and Beth Howland on the \"Alice\" series.\n\nHer character of Jolene was given rather short shrift during the four seasons (1981-1985) she appeared. Although Celia valiantly tried the invest the role with some sass, she was the newcomer and was too often overshadowed by the other two. Following the show's demise, she had a number of lean years before her luck changed again. In 1988, she was handed a couple of featured roles in the movies Stars and Bars - Der ganz normale amerikanische Wahnsinn (1988) and Morgen fängt das Leben an (1988). Her penchant for toned-down, unaffected realism was not overlooked. While interspersing theater roles with the sudden upswing of film parts now coming her way, she finally came into her own in both venues in the mid-to-late 1990s. After earning critical applause for her brittle dramatic turn as the backwoods mother of a murdered child in Dead Man Walking - Sein letzter Gang (1995), she went on to win an Outer Critics Award and Tony nomination for her Southern matron in Broadway's acclaimed \"The Last Night of Ballyhoo\" (1997).\n\nPreferring art-house obscurity to mainstream popularity, Celia has stayed true for the most part with classier, character-driven drama and it has paid off in career dividends. An always interesting presence, her gals can tangle and backbite with the best of them or show true grit and/or extreme emotional fragility at times of unbearable sorrow. Celia has also played a variety of dialects over the years. A gregarious and eccentric turn as a possible mother to a searching Ben Stiller in the wonderful Flirting with Disaster - Ein Unheil kommt selten allein (1996) led to her Civil War wife in Wer mit dem Teufel reitet (1999); her grieving, prejudicial Teutonic mother in Schnee, der auf Zedern fällt (1999); the part of Cate Blanchett's haughty aunt in Der talentierte Mr. Ripley (1999); and the Southern belle-like mental patient in K-Pax (2001). In addition, her Southern roots have complimented such Tennessee Williams' plays as \"Summer and Smoke\" and \"Suddenly Last Summer\" on Broadway.\n\nInto the millennium, Celia is still going strong. She has been a vibrant presence in such ensemble films as In the Bedroom (2001), Dem Himmel so fern (2002) and The Village - Das Dorf (2004). In 2005, she received one of her best roles in years as the dressed-down Southern matriarch in the obscure independent film Junikäfer (2005), which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nMore recent films include matronly parts in Joshua - Der Erstgeborene (2007), Invasion (2007), The Box - Du bist das Experiment (2009), Knight and Day (2010), Suddenly Single (2014), In the Radiant City (2016), Dancing Queens (2019) and Quad (2020). She has essayed just as many parts on both dramatic and comedic series TV, including regular/recurring roles on Our Willie (1913), Memphis Beat (2010), American Horror Story (2011), Modern Family (2009) and Hunters (2020).\n\nAs a child growing up in Benton Harbor, Michigan, Ernie Hudson wrote short stories, poems and songs, always thinking that his words might one day come to life on stage. After a short stint in the Marine Corps, he moved to Detroit where he became the resident playwright at Concept East, the oldest Black theatre in the country. In addition, he enrolled at Wayne State University to further develop his writing and acting skills and found time to establish the Actors' Ensemble Theatre, where he and other talented young black writers directed and appeared in their own works. After graduating with a B.A. from Wayne State, he was rewarded a full scholarship to the M.F.A. program at the prestigious Yale School of Drama. While performing with the school's repertory company, he was asked to appear in the Los Angeles production of Lonne Elder III's musical \"Daddy Goodness,\" which led to his meeting Gordon Parks, who gave Hudson the costarring role in his first feature film, Leadbelly (1976). Unfortunately, all that followed \"Leadbelly\" was a year of \"bit parts and some harsh lessons about Hollywood,\" which led Hudson to enroll in another academic doctorate program at the University of Minnesota. He did not complete the program. Through his experience, he learned another vital lesson: \"There are those who spend their lives studying it and those who spend their lives doing it.\" Hudson definitely wanted to be in the second group. Keeping in mind this self-revelation, Hudson accepted the starring role of Jack Jefferson in the Minneapolis Theatre In The Round's production of \"The Great White Hope,\" a role that he put \"everything he had into,\" including shaving his head. A series of starring and guest roles followed on such television shows as Fantasy Island (1977), Der unglaubliche Hulk (1977), Unsere kleine Farm (1974), Noch Fragen Arnold? (1978), Taxi (1978), One Day at a Time (1975), Gimme a Break! (1981), Das A-Team (1983) and Webster (1983), as well as costarring roles in the TV movies White Mama (1980) with Bette Davis, Roots - Die nächsten Generationen (1979), Die Frauen von San Quentin (1983), Kalifornien, ich komme! (1985), Mad Bull - Der Supercatcher (1977) and Der Mörder und die Lady (1985). Other feature film credits include The Jazz Singer (1980), Was, du willst nicht? (1979), Spacehunter - Jäger im All (1983), Blutige Lorbeeren (1982), Auf die Bäume, ihr Affen! (1983), Joy of Sex (1984) and, of course, the mega-hit Ghostbusters - Die Geisterjäger (1984).\n\nMira Katherine Sorvino was born on September 28, 1967 in Manhattan. She is the daughter of Lorraine Davis, an actress turned drama therapist, and veteran character actor Paul Sorvino. Her father's family were Italian immigrants. The young Sorvino was intelligent, an avid reader and an exceptional scholar. Her father discouraged her from becoming an actor, as he knew how the industry often chews up young stars. She attended Harvard, majoring in Chinese, graduating magna cum laude in 1989, largely on the strength of her thesis, a Hoopes Prize-winning thesis on racial conflict in China, written and researched during the year spent in Beijing, which helped her fluency in Mandarin Chinese.\n\nHowever, she showed interest in a career in acting from an early age, and moved to New York City to try her hand in the City's film industry, waitressing, auditioning and working at the Tribeca production company of Robert De Niro. She succeeded in getting a little television work in the early 1990s, but got her first film job in the independent gangster movie Unter Freunden (1993), on which she worked her way up the ladder behind the camera to eventually associate-produce the film, and, more importantly, was eventually cast as the female lead. The indie production was well-received, and Sorvino's performance attracted enough buzz to get her cast in two more movies, one a more prominent indie, Barcelona (1994), the other her first Hollywood feature, Quiz Show (1994), and her skillful performances brought her yet more attention.\n\nAn exceptionally poised and articulate young woman, she may have seemed inappropriate to play a crazy hooker, but Woody Allen took the chance, and her magnificent performance as the female lead in his Geliebte Aphrodite (1995) proved her range as a performer and earned her an Oscar (at the tender age of 29) for Best Supporting Actress. Since winning the Oscar, Sorvino has continued to take a wide range of roles, including another stretch as Marilyn Monroe in Marilyn - Ihr Leben (1996), co-starring with another very intelligent and skilled young actress, Ashley Judd. Forays into action and horror, such as Mimic - Angriff der Killerinsekten (1997) and The Replacement Killers - Die Ersatzkiller (1998) show that Sorvino is not above being playful in the film roles she chooses.\n\nHowever, what forever cemented her role in popular culture was her performance as charmingly silly California beach girl Romy White in Romy und Michele (1997), in which she and co-star Lisa Kudrow utter one hilarious absurdity after another.\n\nMira Sorvino married Christopher Backus on June 11, 2004, and the couple have four children.\n\nJane Krakowski was born in Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey, to Barbara (Benoit), a college theater instructor, and Edward Krajkowski, a chemical engineer. Her father was of Polish descent and her mother has French-Canadian and Scottish ancestry.\n\nJane was the winner of the 2003 Tony Award for her stunning and sultry portrayal of \"Carla\", in the Broadway musical \"Nine\", opposite Antonio Banderas. Her performance also earned her the Drama Desk Award and the Outer Critic's Award. Krakowski also stars in Alfie (2004), the remake of the famous 1966 film, alongside Jude Law. Krakowski recently filmed High School Confidential - Der Teufel trägt Minirock (2005) starring Evan Rachel Wood and James Woods. Other recent film credits include Zachary Beaver - Mein dickster Freund (2003), Go! Das Leben beginnt erst um 3.00 Uhr morgens (1999), Die Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas (2000) as \"Betty Rubble\", Dance with Me (1998), Mrs. Winterbourne (1996), Stepping Out (1991), Eine verhängnisvolle Affäre (1987) and Die schrillen Vier auf Achse (1983). For television, Jane received a Golden Globe Award nomination for her portrayal of \"Elaine Vassal\" on Ally McBeal (1997).\n\nShe also stars in NBC's remake of the Charles Dickens classic A Christmas Carol (2004), opposite Kelsey Grammer. Other recent television credits include: Law & Order (1990), Everwood (2002), the ABC family movie Just a Walk in the Park (2002), and the miniseries, Queen (1993) (aka Alex Haley's \"Queen\"). Other Broadway credits include \"Grand Hotel\" (Tony Award and Drama Desk Award nominee), \"Company\", \"Once Upon a Mattress\", \"Tartuffe\" and \"Starlight Express\". In Los Angeles, California, she starred at the Mark Taper Forum in \"Henceforward\", for which she won the LA Drama Critics Award and the Dramalogue Awards, and played \"Mabel\" in the Reprise production of \"Mack and Mabel\". In addition to singing on several original Broadway cast recordings of shows in which she appeared, and the Ally McBeal (1997) Christmas episode compilation CDs, Krakowski also recorded the hit single track \"You\" with A/C hitman Jim Brickman on his recent album \"Lovesongs and Lullabies\"."
