        "text": "All I can remember is not a great craft service,\n\nwhich is how I judge every production\n\nand the smell on set was so repugnant,\n\nit felt like a very, very small gym,\n\nbut we weren't working out\n\nand I don't know what that smell was.\n\nHi, I'm Adam Devine and these are my Iconic Characters.\n\n(dynamic upbeat music)\n\nMail Order Comedy, MOC, baby,\n\nit was like right when YouTube first came out,\n\nwe were like, oh, my God, like we can actually post videos\n\nand people will see them\n\nand dozens of people watched our videos every week,\n\nso we thought we were superstars.\n\nAn ice cold Sierra Nevada Sausagefest.\n\nYeah, Sausagefest was, we actually were just having a party\n\nand we had all of our equipment at our house\n\nand we were like there's not a girl here,\n\nwe should just have a beer called Sausagefest\n\nand then have the tagline be, Bring on the dudes.\n\nWe just filmed our actual party\n\nwith not a single girl there, there was one girl\n\nand we were like, sorry, you have to sit this one out.\n\nWorkaholics was like our ultimate dream come true.\n\nMy character in Workaholics,\n\nI was Adam DeMamp the Champ, full on maniac.\n\nPeople are always weirded out, when they meet me in person,\n\nbecause I'm not like that peak level of crazy\n\nand they're like,\n\nOh, I thought you'd be like much more of a maniac,\n\nI thought you'd be just like DeMamp,\n\nand I'm like, I would be dead,\n\nthat man should have died like 30 times\n\nor at least so concussed,\n\nhe couldn't put a sentence together.\n\nOh, my head.\n\nBlake and Ders, I hate them, hate them\n\nas people, as people, I hate them,\n\nas co-stars, great, great guys,\n\nbut as human beings, they're monsters.\n\nSeason three opener, Business Trip,\n\nAnders gets invited to go on this business trip with Alice,\n\nour boss to close this by account with the Barracuda,\n\nso we sort of tag along, 'cause he's got this suite\n\nand we're gonna party.\n\nHappy Business Trip!\n\nWhoa, how did we beat you here, man,\n\nwe got fireworks, pretty cool, right?\n\nGuys, this is a no.\n\nWe sort of get found out, that we're there\n\nand Alice comes and she's like,\n\nWe've gotta shut this down,\n\nbut then the Barracuda's there as well\n\nand she's like, Wait, you guys are doing drugs?\n\nI wanna do it, I'm here to party,\n\nand so then we all take acid\n\nand then it just fully spirals out of control.\n\nKyle Newacheck, who ended up being our director\n\nfor basically everything we've ever done,\n\nthat's where he really ran with all the visual stuff\n\nand we kind of let him do what he does,\n\nso like any time that we zone out\n\nand go into like their little drug world,\n\nthat's sort of where he kind of stylistically\n\nmade it pretty awesome and incredible,\n\nthank God we had him, that show could've really sucked.\n\nPitch Perfect was, I'm so glad I did that movie,\n\n'cause I was on the fence,\n\n'cause it was right after I did Workaholics.\n\nLuckily the script was super funny.\n\nI asked Blake and Ders,\n\nlike what do you guys think of the script,\n\nit's me acapella singing and Ders read it and was like,\n\nIt's really funny, I think you'll crush it in this role,\n\nand then Blake was like,\n\nYeah, yeah, I also think it's good,\n\nand then came in my office like late at night,\n\nwhen I was working and was like,\n\nDon't do this movie, you're gonna bury us,\n\nno one will like Workaholics,\n\nif you're in a singing movie,\n\nand you're an idiot, Blake, because that movie came out\n\nand it was so funny and people really liked it\n\nand so I'm really glad I did it.\n\nMy character, Bumper, a little bit of an egomaniac,\n\nreally just wants to be the greatest,\n\nbut once again has that level,\n\nthat base level of insecurity, that you're like,\n\noh, this guy's compensating for something.\n\nI did a lot of vocal warmups to prepare for the role,\n\nit was always\n\n♪ Double bubble, triple bubble gum, yum yum ♪\n\n♪ Aluminum, linoleum, aluminum, linoleum ♪\n\n♪ Aluminum, linoleum, yum yum ♪\n\nI did that for three months straight\n\nand then shot the movie.\n\nBut we did this riff off in Pitch Perfect,\n\nwhere on paper, I'm like, hm, how's this gonna play?\n\nBut then they shot it all cool,\n\nwe're in a pool and there's lights and it's at night\n\nand then it's just us\n\naggressively like singing to each other,\n\nwhich sounds really dumb and is really dumb,\n\nbut very, very funny.\n\n♪ Let's talk about sex, alright ♪\n\n♪ Let's talk about sex, a little bit, a little bit ♪\n\nGame Over, Man was like our little baby.\n\nIt's sort of like Die Hard-esque,\n\nbut instead of cool, badass John McClane,\n\nyou have three idiots. (laughing)\n\nI play Alexxx with three Xs\n\nand, was that four?\n\nHe's like that friend that you have,\n\nthat you love him to death,\n\nbut you can't invite him over for a chill night,\n\nonly the big events does Alexxx with three Xs get invited,\n\nyou've gotta keep him clear,\n\nbecause he's like, We should chug this.\n\nDo you think this would break on my head?\n\nDo you think this would fit on my, what's that?\n\nWe had to do this scene,\n\nwhere we're like strapped in to an ironing board\n\nand we swing across from two buildings\n\nand we shot it on this green screen,\n\nbut we're still hanging like 80 feet in the air\n\nand then we're dropped and so all day long,\n\nit was like we're on a very aggressive rollercoaster,\n\nbut instead of a like a comfortable rollercoaster seat,\n\nyou're like kind of hanging off this clothes hanging board.\n\nThis was the coolest shit, coming out of the fucking window,\n\ndoing a badass exit,\n\nnow we look like a bunch of fucking losers hanging up here.\n\nVery weird bruises, like I'm a dominatrix or something,\n\n'cause I had to wear this harness,\n\nso I had like aggressive bruises right here.\n\nMy girlfriend was, you know, trying to like\n\nget a little nooky and I'm like, not now,\n\nthis whole zone is off limits.\n\nSeth Rogen and Evan Goldberg produced Game Over, Man\n\nand we'd been working on this movie for years\n\nand they were shooting Neighbors, when we first signed up\n\nto have them produce our movie with us and they were like,\n\nCome on down, we'll figure something out for you,\n\nand they had us invent Beer Pong.\n\nI hope in 100 years, that's just history,\n\nlike people are going like,\n\nActually, no, it's in this movie,\n\nthe people that invented Beer Pong\n\nare the guys from Workaholics.\n\nThey really wanted me to sink a bowl\n\nand it took me like, it took two hours to shoot that scene,\n\nbecause for 45 minutes, I'm like, I'll get it!\n\nNo, just give me another shot!\n\nAnd they're like, We could just drop it off frame,\n\nand I'm like, no, we're not, we're getting it in one!\n\nI was a real monster about it.\n\nYeah, Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates\n\nwas like that was the dream gig for me,\n\nI fought like tooth and nail to get it.\n\nI play Mike Stangle, he's the older brother,\n\nbut he's the one that doesn't have\n\nhis shit together the most\n\nand he's definitely that archetype\n\nthat I sort of like find my way in\n\nof like a guy with all this false bravado\n\nwith a level of insecurity at its base,\n\nwho really just wants things to go his way,\n\nbut throughout the movie,\n\nthings just start spinning more and more out of control\n\nand by the end, he's full on manic mode.\n\nNo!\n\nAt the beginning of the movie,\n\nyou see all these things going right,\n\nlike us jumping on a trampoline\n\nand like I kiss a girl, that's on the roof\n\nand then we're like shooting Roman candles at each other\n\nand it's kind of cute and fun, we're doing like a fun dance\n\nand then cut to the Dad shows us the tape\n\nof what actually happened at all those family functions\n\nand I headbutt the girl and she falls off\n\nand we're both bloody,\n\nwe're shooting Roman candles at each other\n\nand we accidentally shoot it inside this camper\n\nand it explodes.\n\nIt was fun up to that point.\n\nAnd I thought that was like a real cool, clever way\n\nto show like how we picture ourselves\n\nand how we actually are.\n\nThe Intern was this cool Nancy Meyers movie that I did.\n\nSo I played the character, Jason,\n\nI sort of was the head of the interns\n\nand De Niro was one of the new interns at the office\n\nand I kind of showed him the ropes,\n\nbut then he showed me how to live life as a real man.\n\nAnd I assume you talked to her, apologized,\n\ntold her how much she means to you?\n\nWell, you know.\n\nYou didn't talk to her?\n\nWhat did you do, send her a Tweet?\n\nNo, of course not, I like texted her a billion times.\n\nIt was kind of fun for me to play this character,\n\nbecause he wasn't so broad\n\nas like Bumper was or Adam DeMamp\n\nand I kind of got to play a more grounded character.\n\nRobert De Niro was like, obviously he's like the man, right,\n\nbut he's really quiet.\n\nIf he thinks you're funny, he likes you\n\nand so luckily he kind of thought I was funny\n\nand like snuck in there,\n\nhe wouldn't emit sound, when he would laugh,\n\nhe would just jiggle,\n\nwhich if you've ever seen Robert De Niro just jiggle,\n\nthe funniest thing in the world,\n\n'cause he does super De Niro face,\n\nyou'll say something funny,\n\nhe'll just make the De Niro face and go.\n\nRatko: The Dictator's Son,\n\nI think they paid us like $11,\n\nit's not one of my proudest moments,\n\nbut I'll wear it with a badge of honor.\n\nI think I was like generic party boy number four\n\nand that's basically what I've been playing\n\nthe rest of my career.\n\nFrom what I can remember of that film.\n\nFiesta!\n\n(Mariachi music)\n\nIt doesn't hold up, I'll say that.\n\nWhen We First Met was this movie I did,\n\nme, Alexandra Daddario, Shelley Hennig,\n\nit sort of starts out, we're at her engagement party\n\nand you think that I'm gonna be the one,\n\nthat's going to marry the girl,\n\nit turns out I'm not and I'm depressed\n\nand I like loved her and I've like since been friend zoned\n\nand I go to the place, that we had our first drinks together\n\nand I fall into this photo booth,\n\nwhere we took photos many years ago\n\nand it's sort of like the Zoltron machine in Big\n\nand I go back in time to see what I can do,\n\nif I could change something when I first met her\n\nand then every time that I do something,\n\nI wake up the next day with those consequences.\n\nIt was a really fun character to play,\n\n'cause I got to play a bunch of different,\n\nI got to play like the sweet version of myself,\n\nthe maniac version, the douchy version,\n\nthe cool guy version and that was mt favorite version,\n\nbecause I got to be like, like I got to play this guy,\n\nwhy do cool guys always look like\n\nthey have something in their eyes,\n\nhave you ever noticed that?\n\nLike they could be totally normal\n\nand then they're like, Hey, what's up?\n\nLet's go to this party,\n\nand then cool guy does like,\n\nWhat's up?\n\nI feel like my role as Chief Party Officer\n\nfor Captain Morgan is maybe\n\nthe role I've been destined to play.\n\nOh, oh, oh, so much more than that.\n\nEvery one of my roles have been a stepping stone to be here,\n\nbecause they've all been fun guy, party animals,\n\nbut now I know how to handle myself\n\nand if you party with the Captain,\n\nyou've got to be able to handle yourself,\n\n'cause that guy, that guy's knows what's up.\n\nSo we went and surprised this dude, Tyler\n\non his 30th birthday party\n\nand just sort of showed up at his house\n\nand just sort of partied with this guy and his friends\n\nand like I didn't know how it was gonna go,\n\n'cause this was a surprise party and it just blew his mind\n\nand we had like a pretty great time.\n\nEvery role is like a little different\n\nand you want to make it unique for that character,\n\nbut then I feel like people also want to see\n\nthe thing that makes you special as well\n\ncome through that character,\n\nso I always try to bring some uniqueness,\n\nkeep it grounded on some level,\n\nthat every person can go like, I know that guy.\n\n(dynamic upbeat music)"
