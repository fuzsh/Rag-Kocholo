        "text": "The 'Modern Family' Cast From Season 1 Through to Now\n\nThe kids look completely different.\n\n(Image credit: Bob D'Amico)\n\nOver the course of the past 10 seasons, audiences fell in love with the hilarious antics and distinct personalities of the Dunphy, Tucker, and Pritchett families. Which is why we think we speak for everyone when we say we're in denial that the series is coming to an end. This might help you cope: In honor of the show's 11th and final season, take a look back at how much the cast has changed over the years.\n\nStay In The Know\n\nMarie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

The role of Gloria Pritchett on Modern Family was her big break.\n\nNow: Sofía Vergara\n\nSince making it big, Sofía has continued to grace the small screen, as well as the big screen in comedies like Hot Pursuit and New Year's Eve.\n\nThen: Ed O'Neill\n\nPrior to Modern Family, Ed played the iconic role of Al Bundy on Married...with Children. After the show ended, he continued to act in TV guest spots, as well as star in the 2004 movie Spartan.\n\nNow: Ed O'Neill\n\nAfter winning over America (again) as television's favorite patriarch Jay Pritchett, Ed turned his attention to animated film. The actor has voiced characters in Finding Dory as well as Ralph Breaks the Internet in recent years.\n\nThen: Rico Rodriguez\n\nAfter getting his start on shows like Disney Channel's Cory in the House and Nickelodeon's iCarly, Rico Rodriguez became a household name for his role as Modern Family's quippy, wise-beyond-his-years Manny Delgado.\n\nNow: Rico Rodriguez\n\nRico was cast as Manny at just 10 years old, which means he's played the part for almost half of his life. He's returned to a few Nickelodeon programs and has done voice work for animated films since his Modern Family success.\n\nThen: Jesse Tyler Ferguson\n\nAlthough Jesse Tyler Ferguson had a successful theater career before Modern Family, making his Broadway debut in Leonard Bernstein's 1998 production of On the Town, his role as Mitchell Pritchett was his first big break in front of the camera.\n\nNow: Jesse Tyler Ferguson\n\nSince finding television fame, Jesse's continued to work in film and was the voice of Shangri Llama in Ice Age: Collision Course.
