        "text": "Where there’s a Pitch Perfect project, can an earworm of a mashup be far behind?\n\nThat’s a rhetorical question, as you’ll see in Peacock‘s new teaser for Pitch Perfect: Bumper in Berlin, which features a performance from a familiar face “…or seven.”\n\nPremiering on Wednesday, Nov. 23, the series picks up “several years” after we last saw Bumper Allen (once again played by Adam Devine), who moves to Germany to revive his career when one of his songs becomes big in Berlin.\n\nIn addition to Devine, the Universal Television production also stars Flula Borg as Pieter, Sarah Hyland as Heidi, Lera Abova as Lina and Jameela Jamil as Gisela — all of whom you can see in the fresh batch of first-look photos below.\n\nWriter Megan Amram serves as showrunner, executive-producing alongside Devine, Elizabeth Banks and Max Handelman of Brownstone Productions, and Paul Brooks and Scott Neimeyer of Gold Circle Films, director Todd Strauss-Schulson, and producing director Richie Keen."
