        "text": "In the enchanting world of the celebrity wedding, nothing is off limits. Sure, the average tying-of-the-knot makes for a beautiful affair to remember—but when some of the globe’s most notable personalities are involved, the ceremony gets heightened to epic proportions. Over the years, Vogue has covered its fair share of spectacular ceremonies, taking a behind-the-scenes look at everything from scouting the perfect location to searching for the ideal wedding gown.\n\nNo location is out of reach for the world's stars. The Vogue wedding archives hold a bevy of fairytale settings, from Ariana Grande’s intimate Montecito ceremony to Brooklyn and Nicola Peltz's star-studded Palm Beach affair. Even more splendid? All of the bridal fashion, of course. The world collectively swooned when Amal and George Clooney tied the knot in 2014, and Amal was photographed during a final fitting with the late designer Oscar de la Renta.\n\nBelow, a look at more of the best celebrity weddings to appear in Vogue.\n\nFirework content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nNicola Peltz and Brooklyn Beckham\n\nNicola Peltz and Brooklyn Beckham wed in a star-studded affair at her family’s oceanfront estate in Palm Beach. The bride wore a Valentino Couture gown complete with a sprawling train and platform heels. Brooklyn’s little sister, Harper, served as a flower girl, whereas his brothers Romeo and Cruz acted as best men. The couple’s first dance was to the song “Only Fools Rush In,” performed by South African musician Lloyiso.\n\nBeanie Feldstein and Bonnie-Chance Roberts\n\nThe Booksmart actor and producer both wore Gucci for their summer camp-themed wedding at Cedar Lakes Estate in the Hudson Valley. (“I grew up going to summer camp for ten years, and my parents and both sets of my grandparents met at summer camp, so camp is a lineage of love through the generations of my family,\" said Beanie of the meaningful theme.) Beanie’s Gucci wedding dress was partially inspired by her mother’s 1970s gown, whereas Bonnie’s outfit took its cues from a suit Julia Roberts once wore by the Italian designer.\n\nTaylor Hill and Daniel Fryer\n\n“It wasn’t in London or in France like everyone reported,” Taika says of the rumors about his wedding to Rita Ora. “It was in L.A. with a small group of friends.” The two wed at home with Rita wearing a dress by Tom Ford and Lorraine Schwartz jewels. (“Tom Ford is one of my favorite designers of all time and favorite humans in general,” Rita says.) Afterwards, they headed to friend Guy Oseary’s house for a dinner party, where a surprise Elvis impersonator serenaded the newlyweds.\n\nBarbara Palvin and Dylan Sprouse\n\nBarbara Palvin and Dylan Sprouse wed at Barbara’s family reserve in the Hungarian countryside. “Barbara and her sister planned most of it,” Dylan joked. “They told me my only job was to show up and say the right name.” Barbara wore a custom Vivienne Westwood dress along with a Tiffany & Co. ’90s-inspired diamond choker for her church ceremony. Afterwards, she changed into a mini-dress by Philosophy di Lorenzo Serafini. “It was the best choice,” Barbara says. “The dress made me feel like a modern princess.”\n\nSofia Richie and Elliot Grainge\n\nIt was the wedding seen around the world (or, at least, Tiktok): Sofia Richie’s wedding at the Hotel du Cap to Elliot Grainge. She wore three custom Chanel dresses over the weekend, including a lace halter-neck gown down the aisle. “At my first fitting at the Chanel salons in Paris, I immediately envisioned the dress I wanted to get married in: a beautiful lace-embroidered halter gown with a long train,\" she said. \"Within the dress are subtle details, including an embroidered heart to represent the love that Elliot and I share, as well as a blue embroidered S&E on the inside of the dress above my heart.” For the after-party, Good Charlotte—whose lead singer, Joel Madden, is married to Sofia Richie’s sister Nicole—played late into the night.\n\nSimone Biles and Jonathan Owens\n\nSimone Biles and Jonathan Owens wed at the Nobu Los Cabos in Mexico during a ceremony she describes as “so beautiful and dreamy.” The Olympic gymnast wore Galia Lahav for the occasion and her hair down in loose waves. Afterwards, they held an open-air reception complete with drinks, dancing, and a red velvet cake. “I want to do it again,” she said. “We had the best night of our lives. It was a 12 out of 10!”\n\nTish Cyrus and Dominic Purcell\n\nTish Cyrus wed Dominic Purcell at a small poolside ceremony outside her daughter Miley Cyrus’s home in Malibu. She wore a strapless white lace dress with an A-line skirt by Netta Benshabu for the ceremony. “The dress I wore at the ceremony was the most romantic dress I’ve ever seen,” she said. “It truly felt like me. And most of all, it made me feel like I feel when I’m with Dom: beautiful. That’s how he makes me feel.”\n\nAlexandra Daddario and Andrew Form\n\nThe White Lotus star decided to get married in New Orleans after taking a job there and falling in love with the historic metropolis: “It’s a city full of music and life,” she told Vogue. Danielle Frankel designed her pleated wedding dress with lace detailing. “I chose my dress because it felt like it belonged in New Orleans and was the right choice for the Louisiana heat,” Daddario said of her laid-back choice. The ceremony was held at Preservation Hall and the reception took place at Bar Marilou in the French Quarter.\n\nTaylor Lautner and Taylor Dome\n\n\"We both envisioned an old-school New York City, Great Gatsby-inspired, black and white ball for the big day,\" Kate Bock says of her wedding to Kevin Love at the New York Public Library. “The setting was so timeless and romantic with the beautiful marble and an unbelievable candlelit staircase.\" The bride wore a Grace Kelly inspired wedding gown by Ralph Lauren and a reception dress by Danielle Frankel.\n\nAnnaSophia Robb and Trevor Paul\n\nAnnaSophia Robb and Trevor Paul wed at Inness, a hotel in upstate New York, under a fall harvest moon. “It was on the cusp of fall but with the warmth of summer still hanging in the air,” Robb told Vogue. “New York was green and in full bloom.” She wore custom Danielle Frankel for the occasion, accessorized by her grandmother’s diamond studs. The ceremony overlooked the Catskills mountains, while the reception was held in a classic wooden barn.\n\nSarah Hyland and Wells Adams\n\nSarah Hyland wore two Vera Wang dresses for her wedding in Santa Ynez to Wells Adam. “Our venue has the color palette of a chateau in the countryside of France with the architectural design of an Italian castle,” she said of their vineyard venue, so her first gown had a feeling of Old World romance. The second, on the other hand, was a form-fitting embroidered lace gown with draped Juliet sleeves. Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Sarah Hyland’s Modern Family co-star, served as the officiant.\n\nKourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker\n\nKourtney Kardashian wore a one-of-a-kind Dolce & Gabbana Alta Moda lace and satin corset mini dress inspired by 1960s Italian lingerie, all accompanied by a sweeping veil. Hand embroidered into the headpiece were flowers inspired by the seaside town’s many Mediterranean gardens, as well as a depiction of the Virgin Mary.\n\nJennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck\n\nJennifer Lopez chose three Ralph Lauren dresses for her Georgia wedding to Ben Affleck. The gown she wore down the aisle was made from 1,000 handkerchiefs and 500 meters of fabric, all cut into ruffles. It also featured a turtleneck and a cathedral-length veil.\n\nChloe Bridges and Adam Devine\n\nChloe Bridges and Adam Devine wed in a 90-person ceremony in Cabo San Lucas, where the bride wore Danielle Frankel and the groom donned custom Vans embroidered with the word “MR.” “We danced so hard. You can tell how much fun we were having by the amount of sweat in the photos,” Adam said of his wedding. “It was a blast.”\n\nParis Hilton and Carter Reum\n\nThe actor and her musician husband spent just 28 days planning their New Year’s Eve wedding in Austin. “The time just felt right,” Ryan said. After a ceremony at a local church, where the bride wore Elie Saab and the groom a green velvet tux, they headed to Hotel Van Zandt for their disco-themed reception. Dancing went so late into the night that the hotel had to shut them down.\n\nCaroline Wozniacki and David Lee\n\nTennis player Caroline Wozniacki and former Gold State Warriors star David Lee have a shared love of sports. So it was no surprise they kicked off their Tuscan wedding with some feats of athleticism: the Friday before the ceremony, guests ran obstacle courses, and participated in a game of tug-of-war. The rehearsal dinner took place among the castle ruins at Castiglion del Bosco, where guests ate cuisines from four food carts offering dishes from different regions of Italy.\n\nFor the big day, the bride wore custom Oscar de la Renta. Dinner was served on one long table, set under a canopy of greens and strung with lights as well as hanging candles. Then it was onto \"Club Caro,\" a tent by the pool with suspended disco balls, for quite the party.\n\nMiles Teller and Keleigh Sperry\n\nMiles Teller wed model Keleigh Sperry in Maui, Hawaii, over Labor Day weekend. The bride wore Monique Lhuillier, and the groom donned a custom Celine tuxedo designed by Hedi Slimane. The vibe of the wedding, held at the Ritz Carlton Kapalua Hotel, was \"traditional Hawaiian chic.\" Tables were adorned with arrangements of palm fronds in chinoiserie vases, and pink flowers abounded. The affair went late into the night: the after-party, which was jungle-themed, was held in one of the property's smaller ballrooms.\n\nDJ Tiësto and Annika Backes\n\nDJ Tiësto married model Annika Backes at the Amangiri in Utah.

They are the best at creating delicate, beautiful lace and details, and their Italian heritage kept the fashion and feel authentic to our venue.”\n\nSerena Williams and Alexis Ohanian\n\nIn November 2017, tennis superstar Serena Williams wed Internet entrepreneur Alexis Ohanian in New Orleans, just two months after welcoming their first child together, daughter Alexis “Olympia” Ohanian, Jr. “Alexis really wanted to do New Orleans,” Williams told Vogue. “It’s his favorite city besides Brooklyn. It’s got a heavy European influence; it’s fun and has amazing food. He just loves the vibe. The venue—the Contemporary Arts Center of New Orleans—was a decision we both made. Painting and art is something I’m really passionate about, so it just felt natural and different to do it at a contemporary art museum.” She wore an Alexander McQueen gown designed by Sarah Burton.\n\nZosia Mamet and Evan Jonigkeit\n\nIn November of 2016, Girls actress Zosia Mamet and actor Evan Jonigkeit chose a rustic location for their wedding. The couple got married at the Cedar Lakes Estate in Port Jervis, New York, where their ceremony was held in an old theatre and, afterwards, guests rallied to “The Treehouse” and cuddled near fire pits for s’mores and moonshine.\n\nAmal Alamuddin and George Clooney\n\nAhead of her 2014 wedding to Hollywood A-lister George Clooney, human rights barrister Amal Alamuddin was photographed by Vogue during a final dress fitting with the late designer Oscar de la Renta, who designed her ivory beaded-tulle dress. \"George and I wanted a wedding that was romantic and elegant, and I can’t imagine anyone more able than Oscar to capture this mood in a dress,\" she said. “Meeting him made the design process all the more magical, as he is so warm and such a gentleman.”\n\nSeth Meyers and Alexi Ashe\n\nLate night talk show host Seth Meyers wed Alexi Ashe, a human rights lawyer, in Martha’s Vineyard. Comedian John Mulaney documented the affair for Vogue, where Ashe wore Carolina Herrera.\n\nLauren Bush and David Lauren\n\nIn 2011, Lauren Bush and David Lauren tied the knot over the Labor Day weekend at his family’s 17,000-acre Double RL ranch in Ridgway, Colorado. Around 200 guests attended the affair and the couple, of course, both wore Ralph Lauren.\n\nCindy Crawford and Rande Gerber"
