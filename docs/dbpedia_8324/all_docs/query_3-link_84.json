        "text": "If you ever saw “Workaholics,” then you know who Adam DeVine, Anders Holm and Blake Anderson are.\n\nOf course, there’s a decent chance you didn’t; the show ran on Comedy Central, and while the numbers allowed them seven seasons, it fits more neatly into the “cult” half of “cult hit.”\n\nNow the three, along with longtime collaborator Kyle Newacheck, have made a new Netflix film, “Game Over, Man!,” which Newacheck directs. It isn’t related to the “Workaholics” storyline, though it’s close in spirit. The three actors play dopey, dead-end hotel housekeepers always trying to come up with a big idea.\n\nWhen it looks as if they finally have sold one, the hotel where they work is taken over by terrorists. The three have to save the day, by way of illegal drugs, reanimated dead bodies and rude humor.\n\nThey talked about making the film during a recent visit to Tempe.\n\nQuestion: This is a dumb question, but is it as much fun to run around shooting guns and romping around as it looks?\n\nDeVine: Not a dumb question, Bill. That was an idiotic question. Because obviously it was as much fun as it looked. We had a great time. We wrote the movie that we wanted to write because we wanted to shoot that movie. We wrote the movie that we wanted to star in, because action movies sort of raised us. We have horrible parents. They were never around.\n\nAnderson: And if they were, they were spanking.\n\nDeVine: Yeah. Basically, action movies raised us.\n\nHolm: It’s fun from like 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. But we’re filming for three hours before that and three hours after that, so the middle of the day is just gold.\n\nQuestion: You guys work together a lot. Do you ever make each other break and laugh during a take?\n\nDeVine: Yeah, sometimes you can’t help it. Someone will say something that’s unexpected and you laugh. But you try to be so in-character that no matter what that person says, you respond with how your character would respond. And if your character would laugh, then it’s OK to laugh. But sometimes you just can’t help it.\n\nQuestion: But part of the humor is how deadpan everyone plays it. You can’t let on that you’re in a ridiculous situation.\n\nDeVine: Yeah, I think ... playing it as real as possible is something you want to do for comedy’s sake. If you’re like, “This is zany,” you start being zany. Then all the realness of the scene is kind of lost.\n\nQuestion: What’s the difference in making a full-on feature like this and doing the TV show?\n\nHolm: The difference is we had more time. With “Workaholics,” we shoot like 10, 11 pages a day. Here we could shoot four or five and really take time to, like, pull off a crazy stunt that we couldn’t afford to do on the show or really take time with a scene and mine it for comedy.\n\nQuestion: How do you decide what is funny?\n\nHolm: There’s a certain bar that you have for yourself where you look in the mirror and you go, “Is this funny to you?” It’s a taste thing. “Is this my taste? Do I like this? Does everyone like this?” No. But do I like this? Does Adam like this? Does Blake like this? Does Kyle like it? If we like it, we have a good feeling that people will like it.\n\nDeVine: Anders writes while staring in a mirror. He looks at the mirror. “Did you like it?” It felt so real.\n\nQuestion: It sounds like what you would do after telling yourself for five minutes, “I’m a winner.”\n\nHolm: Yeah. You got it. I do a lot of cutting.\n\nDeVine: It has to pass the same test for all of us. One of us might come with an idea we think is great. If all of us aren’t on board, we don’t do it. But for the most part, we have the same comedy sensibilities. We’ve been working together for so long, we think the same things are funny. But it is the kind of thing where this movie really balances itself out with the insane comedy that’s coming from us and then the real stakes of the bad guys being truly sadistic, being evil. I think we hopefully found the right balance there and audiences will enjoy it.\n\nQuestion: The drama has to work, also.\n\nHolm: Yeah, people would get bored if 30 minutes in you realize that the bad guys are just cartoon characters. You’re like, “I’m not really scared of these guys. This isn’t very intense at all.” You would lose your stakes. I think our bad guys are truly pretty terrifying.\n\nQuestion: I wonder if the finished film is close to what you thought up.\n\nHolm: I would say after we finished production and I saw the first cut, it was like about 80 percent of what the script was.\n\nQuestion: You’ve worked together so much you must have some kind of shorthand.\n\nDeVine: Yeah. On other movie sets you get on set, you sort of feel people out, see how comfortable they are with improv. You don’t want to just hijack a scene and be that guy that everyone’s like, “Oh God, every time he does a scene with me, he ends up going off page, and I don’t know how to keep up or what to do.” So you sort of feel it out. With these guys, we know exactly each other’s strengths and when we can go on improv rants and when we should stick more to script.\n\nOther times we’re talking about the scene right before we start and we’ll just kind of go on a fun rant and go, “Oh, let’s do that when we shoot.”\n\nHolm: Sometimes you go on this improv and you riff and you find gold. And other times you’re like, we need to make sure we do this as written, in case we don’t love what we improvised and we need the shortest version of the scene, because we really did love something we improvised with. You want to be able to pick and choose. If you just improvise the whole thing, then you have a movie that’s 20 minutes too long and you can’t cut around it.\n\nDeVine: Yeah, you really want to make sure you get what is written, and then you can go off from there, because you know what is written, you’ll have a cohesive movie. If you just improv the whole thing, you’ll come back and be like, “Oh, we didn’t even mention this plot point.”\n\nQuestion: You say you don’t want to be the person who hijacks scenes on sets. Does that actually happen?\n\nDeVine: Yeah. “Pitch Perfect” 1.\n\nQuestion: Really?\n\nDeVine: Every day on set I’m like, “It’s my turn.”\n\nQuestion: Is that true?\n\nDeVine: No. I mean, it is the type of thing that if you’re acting with people who aren’t necessarily improv actors, they only have so much bandwidth of improv that they can handle. So it’s just annoying for them. Even though they could be fantastic actors, they don’t do improv.\n\nQuestion: How much improvisation is there in this film?\n\nAnderson: 36 percent.\n\nDeVine: Improv, you can be pretty precise with the amount there is. We calculated 36 percent.\n\nQuestion: Was it hard to balance the tone as actors? Sometimes you go from comedy to drama pretty quickly.\n\nDeVine: Yeah, it’s fun. Obviously we’re so used to playing the comedy of a scene. So it was pretty fun to be really scared and really intense. In some of those scenes, the characters were in life-or-death situations, so you had to play it real for the stakes of the movie to be real.\n\nAnderson: It also just adds to the comedy to have that juxtaposition of going to the most serious, scary hostage scene to, “Oh, there’s these three doofuses again.” You can just get a laugh off of that.\n\nHolm: I do remember refusing to wear earplugs, because I just wanted that loud gunshot to jolt me in a real way.\n\nDeVine: Yeah, and sorry that he’s screaming at you now."
