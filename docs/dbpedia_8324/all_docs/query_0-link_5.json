        "text": "The Help\n\nGloria first meets Andy at the park playing with some children. He introduces himself to her and says he is a manny. The woman he works for, Joan, is rude to Gloria. Andy says it's because Joan thinks Gloria is going to steal her husband since he is always looking at her. Gloria says she would never steal another woman's man, and especially not Joan's fat husband. Andy tells Gloria that Joan's husband is not fat anymore since Andy helped him lose 30 pounds. He prides himself as kind of a chef. Gloria is so impressed with how good Andy is with the kids, his healthy cooking skills, and that he helped his employer lose 30 pounds that she offers him a job as Joe's manny, thereby purposefully stealing him away from his mean employer, Joan. However, Andy doesn't win over Jay and Manny as quickly. Jay compares him to Phil by saying, \"He's a weird man, like Phil, only I have to pay for him.\" Manny says he doesn't want that kind of energy in his house. Eventually, the two of them fire Andy and Gloria gets upset because they made her hire nannies she didn't like and she's the one that spends most of her time at the house. Andy effectively calms an angry Gloria down, which prompts Jay to hire Andy back on the spot.\n\nA Fair to Remember\n\nAndy encounters Haley for the first time. She has come over to her grandfather's house to drink his beer and sunbathe by his pool. She lies to Andy claiming she is Alex, but Andy instantly sees through it when she confuses him being a manny with him claiming to be her uncle Manny. Andy warns Haley he is going to call Mr. and Mrs. P to tell them where the two missing beers went. He even tries to get proof by taking a picture of Haley out by the pool, drinking one of the beers. Haley calls him a perv and Andy tries to get the beer out of Haley's hand, which causes her to drop it. Shards of glass fall into the pool and Andy is forced to go in to retrieve them since Haley refuses to do so. Haley teases Andy about the existence of his U.S. Coast Guard girlfriend. Andy insists she is not imaginary and says it has not been a pleasure meeting Haley. However, when Andy cuts himself on glass he is getting out of the pool, Haley holds his finger to put some pressure on it. Haley asks him why he is a manny anyway, to which he replies that he likes kids and he's saving up for college. Later that night, unbeknownst to each other, Haley calls Gloria to confess she had a couple of beers by the pool and broke one of them, and Andy lies to Jay, saying he had a sip of beer by the pool after Joe went to sleep and a bottle broke. Andy lied in order to take the blame for Haley and protect her from getting into trouble. However, Jay doesn't care because when his kids were small he used to drink beers after they went to sleep. Andy says, \"Thanks\" and then smiles and adds (in reference to Jay racing upstairs to have sex with Gloria), \"And, be careful up there.\" Jay replies as he exits, \"We're not that close.\" Andy nods in understanding.\n\nAnd One to Grow On\n\nJoe calls Andy \"Dada.\" Jay says he is unaffected by this since Joe pees in his own face and laughs. Later when Andy is decorating for Joe's party, Andy tells Jay that he wants the same playful banter that Jay has with Gloria in his own relationship.\n\nOther People's Children\n\nPhil offers to help Andy make a video love letter as an anniversary present for Andy's girlfriend Beth, who Andy says he barely ever gets to see. Andy accepts enthusiastically. While the two are making the video at the Dunphy house, Haley waits for her lunch date who is running a few hours late. Andy says her date's behavior is so rude and that a real man would be more considerate of her time. She mockingly counters with, \"That's why every year People magazine names the most considerate man alive.\" Andy tells her to make fun of him all she wants, but when she grows up, she'll find out what qualities make up a real man. Phil then shows up to apply makeup to Andy's face. Later, Haley steps in as the stand-in for Beth. Andy lifts Haley up and holds her in his arms and looks deep into her eyes as he recites how much he loves his girlfriend. The look on Haley's face confirms she is beginning to fall for the nice guy. When Haley's rude lunch date finally arrives, Haley tells him off by saying she would rather wait for someone who would walk through a blizzard for her and who only honks to support the troops. Later, Haley watches Andy lovingly as he and Phil re-enact the movie \"Gravity.\" She tells Alex that there is something about Andy and Alex says he is just like dad, which then grosses Haley out.\n\nThe Wedding (Part 1)\n\nHaley agrees to drive Andy to the airport. He is planning to go to Utah to visit Beth. As they drive, Andy tells Haley that she is funny, pretty, and smart in an original way so why shouldn't a guy feel lucky to love her. Although she pretends to shrug them off, Haley is secretly flattered and touched by his sincere compliments. When Andy's phone rings, he asks her to answer it because he doesn't want to put their lives at risk since he's driving. Haley reads a text that his flight has been delayed and also sees a text from Beth telling Andy that it's over. Andy says he'll wait for a taxi to pick him up at a coffee shop and Haley tells him she'll grab a coffee with him. As they sit in the coffee shop, Haley takes a picture of Andy and Andy compliments her by saying that it is honestly the best picture anyone has ever taken of him. Andy asks if he can send the picture to Beth and Haley decides to broach the subject of the text message she read and whether or not Andy is sure about getting on that plane. Andy tells her that Beth does this from time to time because she just likes the drama. Andy doesn't want to discuss it anymore and gives Haley the keys to his car. Haley leaves.\n\nThe Wedding (Part 2)\n\nHaley comes back to the coffee shop to talk to Andy. His flight has been delayed again and the wedding has been moved due to a fire. Andy flirts by saying the fire explains Haley's smokin' dress. Haley then invites Andy to hang out at the wedding since he's just sitting around. He replies that he isn't dressed for it, but, if he was with her, nobody would even notice him. Haley tells Andy that he deserves better than Beth before she heads back to the wedding. Later, Andy calls Haley to ask if she meant anyone in particular when she said he deserved better. She lies and tells him that she was speaking generally and that the hardest part is just figuring out what you want. Andy says that's what he thought and they say goodbye to each other disappointed. Unbeknownst to Haley, Andy pulls away in a taxi that he was waiting in right outside the house.\n\nThe Cold\n\nHaley and Andy talk about what happened between them the day of the wedding. They both agree that they are better off as friends. Andy says it would have been a disaster if they had kissed and that the kiss would have affected Haley more than him. Haley seems offended so Andy clarifies by saying that kissing her would have rocked his world since she is so pretty and out of his league, but he still insists that it would have hit her harder. Haley tries to prove Andy wrong by planting a kiss on him in the disguise of a hug. However, it seems Andy is proven right as Haley appears to have been extremely affected by the kiss.\n\nQueer Eyes, Full Hearts\n\nAndy and Haley help each other prepare for job interviews. Andy interviews with Phil who hires him as his real estate assistant. Claire confronts Andy about what Haley told her about them sleeping together, but Andy assures her that nothing inappropriate is happening between him and her daughter. When Haley comes home and tells them she landed a job working as the assistant to fashion designer Gavin Sinclair, Andy hugs her and tells her he never doubted her.\n\nRash Decisions\n\nPhil helps Andy prep for his first open house by quizzing him and having a mock open house. Luke becomes jealous of the relationship between his dad and Andy because lately they have been spending a lot of time together playing catch, going to the mall, getting a portrait taken at Sears, and sharing YouTube videos with each other. Phil even promises to teach Andy how to tie a tie; when Andy warns Phil that his neck is extremely ticklish, Phil chases him out of the room trying to tickle him.\n\nConnection Lost\n\nHaley's family comes to the false conclusion that Haley has married Andy in Vegas because she is pregnant with his baby. In reality, Andy and Haley had gotten cronuts together and Andy posted a picture of the two of them on Facebook enjoying the dessert and smiling happily at one another. Haley had forgotten her phone in Andy's car, which he then drove to a friend's wedding in Vegas.\n\nCloset? You'll Love It!\n\nAndy and Haley attend a carnival together with Haley's new boyfriend. Beth texted Andy saying she couldn't make it because she was too tired from Coast Guard training. Andy tries to win Beth a stuffed penguin and Haley tells him if he really wants to impress her he should try for the big stuffed elephant instead. Andy says the penguin is just as good. Haley seems to be enjoying this time with Andy more than she is with her boyfriend. The boyfriend seems to be a third wheel, not understanding Haley and Andy's jokes and shared sense of humor. Andy keeps having sharp pains in his abdomen, which Haley teases is from him stuffing his face with all the fried food he's eaten that day. However, Andy ends up in the hospital later with appendicitis. Haley rushes to the hospital to be with him before his surgery because she doesn't want him to be scared and alone. When she thinks Andy is unconscious, she tells him that if she is his elephant, he has a shot. Beth then arrives and Haley leaves hurt. Andy opens his eyes and watches as Haley exits.\n\nGrill, Interrupted\n\nAndy says he tried to go on with Beth, but hasn't been able to stop thinking about Haley. He says he is going to have the big talk with Haley when he sees her. However, when Haley arrives at her grandfather's house, she now has a new doctor boyfriend whom she met the same day she visited Andy in the hospital. Andy tries to talk to Haley a couple times about what she said, but every time they are interrupted by Haley's new boyfriend. Haley's boyfriend asks Andy if he will help him write a card for Haley and Andy agrees. Andy tells him to write what he feels and, unbeknownst to Haley's boyfriend, Andy recites his own feelings for Haley. Later, when Haley is about to leave, she asks Andy to read her the card because her boyfriend writes like a doctor. Despite his reluctance, Andy reads the card. Haley is disappointed that her boyfriend seems so into her because she just wanted something fun; she wasn't looking for anything serious. Andy is disappointed that Haley feels that way about relationships so he replies that it's good that she figured out what she wants before anyone got hurt. She thanks Andy and kisses him on the cheek in farewell. Andy, looking crestfallen, watches Haley walk out the door.\n\nAmerican Skyper\n\nAndy helps to set up the iPad for Phil to Skype with his family for Alex's graduation celebration. Andy says he only had to plug him in, which was a nice reversal from when he had to pull the plug on his father in the hospital. Beth is also at the house. She is being passive-aggressive towards Haley because she seems jealous of Haley's relationship with Andy. She even sets Haley's hair on fire at one point during the day. Andy tells Haley that Beth is very concerned about her, asking him where Haley works, where she goes at night, and whether she hikes alone. Later, Andy confides in Phil about how Beth has been sending him signals to propose, but that he is conflicted because there is another girl whom he has a serious connection with, he just doesn't know how she feels. Phil advises Andy to propose to Beth if he truly loves her. Haley confides in her dad about how she thinks Beth is after her because Beth thinks Haley is in love with Andy. Phil asks her if she is and Haley says \"no\" and then goes on to say that she cares about him, he makes her laugh, and she likes spending time with him. Phil asks if she thinks about Andy when he is not around. She replies, \"Sometimes I see something funny and I think, 'Oh, Andy would love that; I wish he were here so I could share it with him.'\" Phil replies, \"That sounds like love to me.\" With tears in her eyes, Haley says it doesn't matter anyway because he's in love with someone else. Andy knocks on the door and enters the room as Haley wipes her eyes. He has come to say goodbye. Haley and Andy hug, and Phil, who is watching them, realizes based on Andy's facial expressions that Haley is the girl Andy was talking about earlier. Phil tries to tell them that they love each other and that Andy is making a huge mistake by proposing to Beth, but they cannot hear him as the sound on his iPad has gone off. Andy leaves with Beth to head to the beach where he is planning to propose to her that day. Haley closes the front door behind them and stomps off upset and frustrated.\n\nSummer Lovin\n\nPhil is on the phone with Cameron. He tells Cam he wants to talk to Haley and that his message is urgent. Cam throws his phone to Claire who puts it on speaker phone for Haley and the whole family to hear the message. Phil reveals that Andy is planning to propose to his girlfriend, Beth. Everyone thinks this is cute until Phil tells them to stop thinking that it's cute because Haley and Andy love each other but don't know it. When Haley asks Phil why he thinks Andy is in love with her, he tells her that he saw it in the way that Andy hugged her goodbye; he knows what the look of love in another man's eyes looks like. Since Haley knows what beach Andy likes, she races to the beach to stop Andy from proposing to Beth. However, this plan goes awry when Claire stops Haley to ask her if she is sure about what she is about to do and whether Andy will be a short-term thing or a long-term relationship. Haley says she doesn't know and asks shouldn't they get the chance to see what they are. Haley then turns back around to see Andy down on one knee proposing to Beth; before Haley can stop them or even walk up to them, Beth says yes. Haley then realizes that their fate has been decided for them. A couple of months later, we see a depressed Haley who seems to have been crying quite a lot since the incident. Phil plans on stopping Claire and Haley's pity party and ends up taking the Dunphy family (excluding Alex) out to the movies. Phil sees Dylan and calls him over, which results in the reconciliation of Haley and Dylan's on-and-off relationship. A couple of months later, we see Andy visit the Dunphys with some completed paperwork for Phil. Haley walks into the kitchen to see Andy. Andy and Haley then have an awkward encounter; they are now both in relationships. Dylan then greets Andy as \"Haley's boyfriend\" letting him know they're back together. After Andy leaves, Phil and Claire discuss how Haley rushed to the beach to stop Andy's proposal as she had feelings for him. Andy accidentally overhears them when he comes back to return Phil's pen. Andy says he's fine and then questions aloud how crazy life is because he had feelings for Haley and, at the same time, Haley had feelings for him and he had no clue. Andy then grabs a cupcake that he had declined earlier and shoves it into his mouth and grabs a second one as he walks out of the kitchen, eating his feelings. In September, an overweight Andy attends a Pritchett-Dunphy family get together. Haley overhears her Mom and Dad discussing how Andy found out that Haley tried to stop his proposal and it is the reason Andy got fat. Haley wonders if she should talk to him about it and they tell her it's her decision to make. Haley ends up talking to Andy, but he questions why she is bringing all this up now. She asks if he has feelings for her and he replies he is engaged, which Haley says is not an answer. This leads to them sharing insults about each others' significant others. Andy and Haley agree it was a good thing they never got together and stomp off angrily in opposite directions.\n\nThe More You Ignore Me\n\nHaley and Dylan run into Andy and Beth at the movies. There are no other seats together so Haley is forced to sit next to Andy. Haley says it has been awkward between them ever since Andy got engaged. The zombie movie hits too close to home for Haley because the movie couple seems to be in the same situation as Andy and Haley (the only difference being that Andy and Haley have no zombies to contend with). After the movie, Haley and Dylan go out for burgers and beers with Andy and Beth. Haley pulls Andy aside to ask him why he wasn't as affected as her by the movie. He tells her that if he had watched that movie a few months ago, it would have been really hard because he was pretty hung up on her, but it's all good now since he started seeing Beth in a whole new way. Haley says that makes sense, but she is visibly disappointed. After leaving the restaurant, Beth suggests they invite Haley and Dylan to the wedding and Andy says that is a good idea. At the same time, Haley breaks up with Dylan because she feels like everyone in the world is moving forward and they are moving backwards. Dylan exits the car upset.\n\nPhil's Sexy, Sexy House\n\nAndy walks in on Haley, who he originally thought was Phil, in the bathroom of a house Phil is selling as she attempts to drain a bathtub she'd neglected to drain the day before. He offers to help her clean up. When he tries to help her drain the tub, they slip and fall into the bathtub together. Their clothes are soaked so they have to take them off and put on robes as they wait for their clothes to dry. As they wait, Andy asks why Haley was taking a bath at the house anyway. She replies that she wanted some time to herself since she lives in her parents' basement, broke up with Dylan, and ate too much at Thanksgiving. Andy seems visibly interested in the fact that she and Dylan broke up. Haley tells him they broke up after running into Andy and Beth at that movie; she just thought they seemed so good together that she wanted that. Andy assures her that he and Beth are not perfect and that things come up when planning a wedding like how Beth doesn't want him to have a bachelor party. Haley says he should live it up and Andy agrees saying he should have one crazy adventure before getting married. When Andy sits down on the couch beside Haley, he accidentally sits on the remote that turns on different sexy features of the house, like starting a fire for them, turning on some music and mood lighting, folding the couch back into a bed, and opening a wine cabinet. As Andy and Haley lie facing each other on the couch-bed, they start to lean in for a kiss, but they are interrupted by Mitch and Cam arriving at the house. Andy and Haley hide in the laundry room before they are seen. After everyone leaves, Andy and Haley reappear from their hiding place, now dressed in their clothes instead of the robes. Andy tells Haley he feels bad because he felt like something could have happened between them if everyone hadn't showed up. Haley blames their almost moment on the house and Andy willingly agrees with her. Andy also tells her that he got his one last crazy adventure before getting married. She says she's glad and it was fun before saying bye to him. Andy lets out a long breath he had been holding as Haley exits the house. Haley then immediately rushes back into the house and leaps into Andy's arms to give him a passionate kiss that he enthusiastically reciprocates.\n\nClean Out Your Junk Drawer\n\nHaley tells Alex that she had sex with Andy when they were alone at the sexy house Phil was trying to sell for his client. She texts Andy to meet up so they can talk. When they meet up in Haley's car so they can talk, Andy says he feels really guilty about what happened. Haley says she is trying to be a better person and, ironically, he is one of the reasons why, but a better person does not hook-up with an engaged person. She says it is not goodbye forever because he works for half her family, but, when they run into each other from now on, they'll keep their clothes on. Andy agrees and tells her, \"You know if things were different\" and trails off, to which she responds sadly, \"I know.\" When Alex calls Haley later to see if she ended things with Andy, Haley lies and says she did. She is really taking the phone call while in bed with Andy after having just had sex with him again. They both appear to be feeling guilty for what they just did and Andy quickly lays face-down a picture of Beth on his bedside table.\n\nWhite Christmas\n\nGloria invited Andy to celebrate Christmas with the family at a cabin because Beth has to work. Nobody knows that Haley and Andy are secretly having sex. After Phil confuses Andy and Haley staring into each others' eyes as a staring contest, Phil gives Andy an old gold blazer that used to be his as a present for passing his real estate license test that Haley helped him cram for. When things start to heat up between Haley and Andy a second time, Phil interrupts them again to help Andy get some firewood. Later, Andy finds the key to the secret room and Haley says she'll meet him there in two minutes. Lily hears noises coming from the locked room and when she realizes it's not Luke and Manny, she screams. This alerts everyone to come and help her. Phil pushes open the door to the room as Haley and Andy are putting their pants back on. After the children are told to go outside and play where snow would be, Claire asks Haley and Andy how long this has been going on and if this is the first time. Haley lies and says yes, but Andy says no and confesses that they have been having improper relations. Gloria appears with a surprise for Andy; Beth is here. Claire pushes Haley back into the secret room and Phil says he wants to talk with Andy. Phil tells Andy if this is a fling, it's over, but if this is something real, then it is time for him to step up and be a man and talk to Beth. Before Andy is able to break things off with Beth, Beth tells him that she has been cheating on him for a few months now with two other guys. They then break up and Beth leaves the cabin. Haley is upset because Andy seems hurt that Beth cheated on him. Gloria tells him to stop moping and be grateful that Haley likes him because she is a stone-cold 10 and he's a Utah 7. As the \"snow\" falls outside the window and Gloria proclaims it to be the perfect Christmas, Andy puts his arm around Haley's shoulder and she strokes his hand as they smile softly at each other.\n\nThe Storm\n\nHaley tries to greet Andy with a hug, but Andy just gives her a pat on the arm. Haley is confused with Andy's behavior towards her since they started out so hot and heavy. She guesses that Andy is probably feeling neglected so he's acting cold since she has been so busy the last couple weeks. In reality, Andy is trying to slow things down with Haley so they don't burn out. He wants to get to know her more emotionally. Haley tries seducing Andy in Joe's room with wine, but Andy suggests he make them some tea to help them open up emotionally. Haley is confused why Andy is rejecting her because she claims everybody wants her. Then she spots Beth's Coast Guard uniform in Joe's closet and jumps to the conclusion that Andy is still in love with his ex. (Andy really has Beth's uniform out because he's sending Beth back her things and had the uniform pressed because he loves his country.) Haley runs down the stairs and throws Beth's uniform at Andy who is carrying two cups of hot tea. He puts the cups down and chases a hysterical Haley outside into the storm. Haley asks him if he is still in love with Beth because he won't kiss her or touch her anymore. Andy says, \"There is no Beth; there's only you.\" He then tells Haley why he's been acting the way he has, that he wants to slow things down a bit in order to catch up emotionally to where they are physically so they don't burn out. Haley argues that they are not going to burn out because she liked him way before they ever hooked up. Andy tells her he wants their relationship to be as good as their affair. He points out that they haven't even gone on a romantic first date. He just wants to wait for the perfect moment so they can start their relationship right. He wants it to be something special and magical, like in the movies. Haley replies, \"What do you want me to do? Chase you through an airport? I think we got it.\" With that, Haley makes Andy aware that they are currently experiencing one of those magical cinema moments right now out in the rain. They laugh at this realization as they lean in to share a romantic kiss out in the storm.\n\nExpress Yourself\n\nAndy and Haley are having dinner at Elwood Grill. Andy decides to order the chilidog because his deceased father had bought him one at his first baseball game. Haley says that’s weirdly sweet and comments that it’s cute that Andy’s hair never moves, like a LEGO. They’re then interrupted by a guy named Tom who recognizes Haley from when she danced on top of his van at Coachella. Haley introduces Andy as her boyfriend to Tom and, after Tom leaves, she apologizes to Andy. Andy tells Haley that he knows she’s a little wilder than him, but that’s one of the reasons he fell for her; it’s exciting. Andy suggests that they forget about dinner and a movie, and instead do what Wild Haley would do. Haley says they can start at this western place where she knows the bartender and, if Andy hangs back, she can get them free drinks all night. In Haley’s interview, she says she wants to give up her partying ways, but if that’s something Andy liked about her, then she doesn’t want to disappoint him. In his interview, Andy admits he’s not usually so quick with party talk and he always had this fear that Haley would think he couldn’t keep up with her; he wants to just survive the night and not barf on his dad’s old church shirt. At Slim’s bar, Andy and Haley do alcoholic shots with a couple named Clint and Bianca. Haley asks Andy if he drank his shot when it was still on fire. Andy replies that it’s an old habit; it’s how he used to eat his marshmallows. Clint says he’ll give Haley 20 bucks if she’ll make out with Bianca. Haley does it, but says she didn’t enjoy it because Bianca is a smoker and has wandering hands; it’s all a part of the Wild Haley experience. Haley, Clint, and Bianca cheer Andy on as he rides a mechanical bull, which he falls off of after 12 seconds. When Haley, Clint, and Bianca rush to Andy, Andy lies and says it was so fun and that’s why he was screaming. Clint and Bianca excitedly ask if Andy and Haley want to go to Vegas with them, despite the late night hour. Andy lies and says he loves that idea and Haley, who wants to please Andy, agrees that it’s a great idea and that she was scared that they were done. Unbeknownst to Haley, Andy is in pain from the mechanical bull ride. The next time we see Haley and Andy they are in Vegas playing Roulette. Andy pretends that he loves gambling; he says it’s the best: “You hand your hard-earned money to strangers and pray it comes back.” Andy says to Haley that he knows he had a lot to drink, but that’s not Bianca anymore with Clint; he doesn’t want to believe Clint sold her. When Clint asks them if they want to get really crazy, Haley blurts out frightened, “People know where I am!” Clint goes all-in on one number. Andy guesses that’s no scarier than when that glow-stick broke in his mouth so Andy goes all-in too. Haley tells Andy that’s a month’s rent. Andy is surprised that the black chips are not $1 chips and tries to take them back, but the croupier won’t let him. Haley starts to freak out and asks Andy why he’s doing this. Andy is surprised she’s asking because he thought she loves Wild Andy. Haley says, “No, no! I love normal Andy. Tomato-soup-and-grilled-cheese Andy. Still-in-bed-by-11:00 Andy. Uses-the-word-tummy Andy.” Andy tells her that he’s been doing this whole thing because he was afraid she’d get bored and dump him if he couldn’t keep up. Haley replies that she knows he can’t keep up, but that she’d rather slow down. She says, “I like the me I am when I’m with you.” Andy replies that he wishes she would have told him that about a minute ago. He says the stress of the gambling is murder on his tummy. By the time the sun has come up the next morning, Andy and Haley are back at Elwood Grill having breakfast. Andy assures the waitress that they got this and then asks Haley if she’s got a nickel or a dime. Haley says she doesn’t. Andy then pulls out a big wad of $100 dollar bills from his pocket and apologizes to the waitress as he hands her one because she’s going to have to make change. Andy and Haley giggle over their newfound riches before they’re interrupted by a text message from Haley’s parents saying they’re heading to Paris.\n\nDouble Click\n\nAndy wants Phil’s advice about whether or not he should take a job in Utah that his cousin Evan, a real estate developer, is offering him after the VP is leaving to start his own company. Before Phil can give Andy his advice, they’re interrupted by Alex and later Luke. Andy comments on Luke’s good mood saying that there’s only one reason a teenage boy is ever like that and that’s because The Harlem Globetrotters must be in town. Later that afternoon, Andy and Haley are waiting for the valet to drive Andy’s car back to them. Andy thinks the valet probably slid the seat back because of his “weirdly short arms.” When his car arrives, Andy gets a phone call from his cousin Evan about his earlier job offer. Haley uses the money from Andy’s wallet to pay for the valet and then waits in the car. Andy tells Evan he still doesn’t want the job. Due to a technical difficulty, Haley overhears the rest of Andy’s phone call while she’s waiting in the car. Evan can’t believe that Andy is turning down his dream job, an actual career back home, because of a girl. Evan then says, “This Haley must be something special.” Haley seems stunned about what she just overheard. The cell connection is lost so the call is dropped. When Andy joins Haley in the car, he exclaims, “I knew it!” because his seat has been slid back by the valet. A couple hours later, Andy comes over to Haley’s house because she said she wanted to talk. He came over right away due to how paranoid he says he can be. Haley suggests they talk in her room, but before they’re able to leave the kitchen, Phil stops Andy to give him the advice Andy wanted earlier. Phil tells Andy to take his dream career in Utah because if their bond is as strong as they think it is, then they will find their way back to each other. Haley, who had been listening, tells Andy, “What he said.” Andy’s face falls at Haley’s words. Later that day, Andy and Haley are at the airport so Andy can make his flight to Utah. As they approach the security line, Haley tells Andy that he can come back to visit and she’ll go to Utah to visit him. Andy agrees that this is not “goodbye goodbye.” Haley says they’ll leave the drama to a couple they see across the room who are currently saying an emotional goodbye. In mocking tones, they joke about what the other couple is saying to each other. Andy says, “I don’t regret a single minute I’ve spent with you.” Haley says, “I think you’re the first man I ever loved.” As they speak those words, they both realize they mean what they are saying, so when they speak again their tones are much more sincere and genuine. Andy says, “Not a single minute” and Haley says, “You really are the first.” They share a goodbye kiss before Andy walks towards the security line. Andy turns around to see Haley walking away in the other direction. When he turns back around to face the security line, Haley turns around to see Andy walking away. Both are visibly saddened by this farewell."
