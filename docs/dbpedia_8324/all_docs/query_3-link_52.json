        "text": "Since my daughter had her sleepover on Friday night we pushed our date night to Saturday. It was my wife's turn to pick the movie and she chose \"The Outlaws\".\n\nThis is a newer movie on Netflix. I had heard of it because I am a big \"Workaholics\" fan and I listen to \"This Is Important\" every week. Adam Devine, as expected, was promoting the hell out of the movie. I read some reviews that weren't too kind, but that stuff doesn't really push me either way. If I want to watch a movie, or my wife wants to watch a movie, we usually watch it together. We will decide for ourselves if it is a good movie or not, but more importantly, if we like it or not.\n\nOn the surface \"The Outlaws\" wasn't the best movie I have ever seen, nor was it the worst. I felt the critics' reviews that I read were a little too harsh. This wasn't a movie trying to send a message or give you hope or optimism or make a statement. The movie was clearly made to have fun and hopefully make a little money. Adam Devine is the lead and I feel like critics simply like to slam him. He seems like an easy mark for critics. But the guy is clearly having a great time making this movie and this role is in his wheelhouse. He is really good at playing these put upon dudes that just want to have fun in life. He really embraces that part and that is not different here. Nina Dobrev, while not the best actor, does a fine job in this movie. She doesn't get to do much, but she does just fine with the little bit she is given. Blake Anderson is in here for a minute and he is very funny. Richard Kind and Julie Hagerty play Devine's parents and they are both hilarious. They made me laugh more than anyone in this movie. Lil Rel Howery and Laci Mosley are Devine's co workers and they both play very well off one another and they are making jokes seemingly every second. Some land some don't, but you never know what works if you don't take the chance. Dean Winters has a bit part and is okay. Lauren Lapkus would have been better served with a bigger role, but she nails the comedy in her few scenes.\n\nThe best part of this okay movie was Ellen Barkin and Pierce Brosnan. They are Dobrev's folks. They don't come around much. But they want to be at the wedding. Or so they say. They are really big deal bank robbers and they rob the bank that Devine is the manager for. They do this to help their daughter, but they also owe a debt to the villain, very well played by Poorna Jagannathan. She was probably the best part of the movie if I sit and think about it. Brosnan and Barkin really nail the comedy, the action and the puts and falls of being lifetime criminals. Brosnan is a pro. I expect nothing less from him. I haven't seen Barkin in a while, but she was more than up to task for this role.\n\n\"The Outlaws\" isn't going to win any awards. I don't think that was the goal. But this is an entertaining enough 90 minutes. I was never bored. I laughed. Sure there were some clear issues, but I was never taken out of the moment by said issues. It is a fine movie that is kind of perfect to have on in the background. It did the job.\n\nTy\n\nTy is the Pop Culture editor for SeedSing and the other host of the X Millennial Man Podcast.\n\nCome and support Ty and the podcast on Patreon.\n\nFollow Ty on instagram and twitter.\n\nSeedSing is funded by a group of awesome people.

Much like \"Eastbound and Down\" and \"Vice Principals\", \"Righteous Gemstones\" is another big time hit from Danny McBride and Jody Hill. I adore these guys and the content they make. I have recently sung the praises of \"Eastbound and Down\" and \"Vice Principals\" on this very site. I was very curious to see how they would do this season of \"Righteous Gemstones\" since it was filmed during the pandemic. Well, any fears I may have had were easily put to rest after the first episode.\n\nThis season was a great follow up to one of the most memorable seasons of TV ever. The first season of \"Righteous Gemstones\" was amazing. I thought it was going to be pretty hard to follow that up with anything close to what they had accomplished. Well I was wrong. They did an amazing job. They brought up new storylines while still keeping the story very dark and very comedic. I will try to keep the rest of my piece as spoiler free as possible.\n\nWhen they opened season two, with a good amount of church people around a big table, there was some big news dropped on everyone and a guy tried to end his life, only to fail and hurt his legs very, very badly. From that point on I knew we were in for some wild and crazy times in the second season. This season more focused on Eli Gemstone's, John Goodman, checkered past. We found out about him being a wrestler and bodyguard and \"gun for hire\". Eli did some wild things back in his day. He was helped out by Junior, Eric Roberts, who was such a wonderful addition. He was funny with a mean streak and ended up becoming a big time ally. I loved seeing him and Goodman as kids and where they were now. It was great. Jesse and Amber mended their ways, but Jesse still wanted more. He wanted to become head preacher. He wanted to work with Eric Andre's, another massive and wonderful addition to the cast, church and their new development. Danny McBride is so good at playing a guy way in over his head but does not realize it. McBride was simply the best this season. Judy and BJ showed a ton of growth this season. They helped out Tiffany. Judy started to work with other wives in the church. BJ was accepted into the family by Eli and Jesse. There was also an awesome scene of BJ rollerblading this season. I highly recommend checking it out. Kelvin and Keefe were so pathetic and so funny and then, at the end, totally redeemed themselves. It was a great journey for them this season, especially the stuff with Kelvin and Eli. That was incredible.\n\nAs the season had its twists and turns, everything came to a head in the finale. And what a wonderful finale it was. I never seem to know how they are going to end this stuff. And with this season being nine episodes as opposed to the usual ten, they found a way to wrap things up nearly perfectly. Even the Jason Schwartzmann character, a journalist exposing these mega churches, had his story all wrapped up by the end.\n\nI adore this show. I am so amped it is coming back for a third season. I think this may be McBride and Hill's best work to date. And the fact that they are giving actors like Edi Patterson, Adam Devine and Tim Baltz a chance to shine, I love that. And I cannot forget the greatness that is Walton Goggins. He is tremendous as Uncle Baby Billy. That character may be as great as Stevie Janowski. Uncle Baby Billy is amazing. Oh, and they even got MaCaulay Caulkin to appear in a few episodes. Please go watch \"Righteous Gemstones\". It may be the best show on TV right now.\n\nTy\n\nTy is the Pop Culture editor for SeedSing and the other host of the X Millennial Man Podcast.\n\nCome and support Ty and the podcast on Patreon.\n\nFollow Ty on instagram and twitter.\n\nSeedSing is funded by a group of awesome people.

I had seen the movie twice prior to this viewing, but my wife had not watched it yet. I wanted something light and fun and goofy to watch, so it seemed like a great time to show her this movie.\n\nFor those that may not know, \"Game Over Man\" was written, directed and starring the Mail Order Comedy guys. To go even deeper, the MOC guys are the dudes behind \"Workaholics\", one of my all time favorite shows. I adored that show when it first premiered, I have watched it several times since, I listen to their podcast, I am a fan. So we watched the movie, and I am here to say, I still like it. My wife liked it as well.\n\nFirst off, the movie is not a good movie. It has issues, it is kind of sloppy and there is some problematic stuff. But I did not go into this on all three watches expecting to see something like \"Uncut Gems\" or \"No Country For Old Men\". I knew going into \"Game Over Man\" that it was going to be over the top, goofy and crazy action comedy. I also fully understood that it was going to be a hyper-realized version of the dudes they played in \"Workaholics\". I imagine when they wrote this movie they had to have a conversation along the lines of what Ders, Adam Demamp and Blake would do in a wild terrorist situation, and they worked at the place that was being taken over. It has to have happened. What I also imagine, and was confirmed by my wife, that all three of the stars got to pick their wardrobe and how their hair would look as the movie moved along. Adam Devine has his shirt open and he looks like a former athlete. Blake's shirt is tucked in, he has glasses and his hair is pulled back. And Ders has a vest, his bowtie is askew and he has shaggy, unkempt hair. I feel like they wrote perfect for their characters as well. Devine is a drug dealing big time thinker. He wants to be rich. Blake is a quiet worker that just wants to come out of the closet. And Ders is a former athlete who now has to smoke saliva just to get high. He has checked out. As they are helping out at a party for a famous person, all the craziness goes down and they get stuck in the hotel. From there on out it is filled with gory kills, great jokes and an okay enough story to move the movie along. We see a face go into a meat slicer, a guy get impaled by a computer, a guy fall from a big building, many gunshot deaths and even a dead guy get used as a decoy. We also see hilarious stuff like Devine pretending to be dead due to auto erotic asphyxiation, Ders getting super high on saliva, Blake trying as hard as he can to not be loud while using duct tape, the aforementioned zombie guy beating up tons of people and Shaggy performing \"It Wasn't Me\" at gun point. The story of the movie is simple enough too. The three main guys just want to get rich with a video game idea they have. They try to pitch their idea when all the shit goes down and they end up saving the day even though they are totally inept. They do sell their idea as a video game and do become rich, but it is all a joke how it happens, and my wife and I were laughing the whole way.\n\nAgain, \"Game Over Man\" is not cinema, but it is a damn fun and funny movie to go relax and watch. I will surely watch it 3 to 4 more times. I love putting it on and just vegging out while it plays. And it always finds a way to catch my full attention. Add on the fact that my wife enjoyed herself, and that is icing on the cake. \"Game Over Man\" is a very, very fun action comedy. Check it out.\n\nTy\n\nTy is the Pop Culture editor for SeedSing and the other host of the X Millennial Man Podcast.\n\nCome and support Ty and the podcast on Patreon.\n\nFollow Ty on instagram and twitter.\n\nSeedSing is funded by a group of awesome people.

I have a good team of pods that help me through long runs, but I was either caught up on them, or was getting a little bored. I always try to find one of two kinds of pods when I run, conversational or comedic. When the two categories marry, that is the cherry on top.\n\nThe podcast I decided to try was \"This is Important\". This podcast is hosted by the guys behind one of my all time favorite shows, \"Workaholics\". We got Kyle Newachek, Anders Holm, Adam Devine and Blake Henderson as the hosts. The podcast is very straight forward. It is just the four of these guys bull shitting for an hour every Tuesday. They like to say that they are only talking about, \"what is truly most important\", but it is just four friends having a good time on the mic. It also helps that these guys are hilarious, have great chemistry, even better friendship and are pretty well known.\n\nOutside \"Workaholics\", all these guys are still working. Kyle Newachek is still directing and producing, most recently on the great TV show, \"What We Do in the Shadows\". Adam Devine has starred in his fair share of movies of late, and he has just been announced as the star of an upcoming \"Pitch Perfect\" TV series. Anders Holm is still doing his thing, he is apparently in an upcoming movie with Robert De Niro. He was also great in \"Top 5\" by the way. And Blake Henderson, he has a recurring role on \"Woke\", was great on \"Parks and Rec\" and was excellent in the movie \"Dope\". They are all still grinding, and they still have the time to get together for an hour a week and make a goofy, ridiculous and fun podcast.\n\nI often find myself cracking up when I listen. It is so mundane and wild and crazy and hilarious. They literally just take a subject here and there and they go down crazy rabbit holes. They did a good 10-15 minutes on John Lithgow movies a few episodes back. They did their first \"live\" episode when Devine had his bachelor party in the Ozarks. It was epic. When Holm goes on about neo soul music, I love it because I love neo soul. Anderson has a soundboard, and the way he uses it during the show is so hilariously perfect. Newachek will spend most of his time either talking about his wife and kids, his garden or expelling gas on the microphone. I know this all sounds trite and boring, but I promise you it is not. Especially if you like Mail Order Comedy and \"Workaholics\". It is just a continuation of where they started. They may have reached a new level of fame, but these dudes seem totally down to Earth, which is awesome. I think the simpleness of the pod is why I love listening to it while running. It marries the comedy and conversation aspects that I like about podcasts. It takes those two genres and melds them perfectly. I love it because it is two of my most favorite things about podcasting.\n\nIf you like these guys, or watched \"Workaholics\", or just enjoy friends getting together that happen to be extremely funny, check out \"This is Important\". It is well worth your time.\n\nTy\n\nTy is the Pop Culture editor for SeedSing and the other host of the X Millennial Man Podcast.\n\nCome and support Ty and the podcast on Patreon.\n\nFollow Ty on instagram and twitter.\n\nSeedSing is funded by a group of awesome people.

I have been anticipating this show, as I stated on a previous podcast, and boy did the pilot, for me, live up to the hype.\n\nThis show has all the elements that I have come to expect from McBride, Jody Hill and David Gordon Green, but amped up by ten. No show of theirs will live up to \"Eastbound and Down\", that was lightening in a bottle, but \"Vice Principals\", and now \"The Righteous Gemstones\" are excellent. What i really enjoyed about \"Vice Principals\", and I have written about this before, was how comedic, yet dark, it was. That show was excellent, and it had a great run. What I found in the pilot of \"TRG\" was that, while still funny, this show may be their darkest yet. There was some wild stuff that went on in the pilot episode. I am not going to spoil anything, but man did stuff gets nuts at the end.\n\nWhat I want to focus on more today is the plot and the actors. I love the plot of this show. I am a non religious person, not at all, so to see a show that sends up the whole Evangelical TV minister, and makes them sinister and evil and only interested in making more money than any person could ever need. We have all seen how awful some of these TV ministers, Joel Osteen comes to mind first, are really are behind the scenes. That is what this show shows us. The three main characters, John Goodman as the patriarch and main minister Eli, Danny McBride as the screw up, yet thinks he is more important than he really is Jesse Gemstone and the gullible and wet behind the ears youngest son, Adam Devine as Kelvin Gemstone, are all great in their own ways. Goodman is menacing and in a deep state of depression. His wife has died and his family is constantly fighting each other. Add on the fact that he is trying to be the only game in town, he is a bad dude. Goodman is perfect for this role. McBride is perfect in the role of an asshole who is way in over his head. He seems good on the surface, but he has some demons that he is fighting, and he refuses to go it alone. He wants to drag all kinds of people into his own mess. And Devine, in a very different role for him, is so innocent and maybe has some kind of soul and just wants to help people. They are all great. The third child of the family, Edi Patterson as Judy Gemstone, is definitely the smartest one of the family, but she doesn't get her due because she is a female. Patterson was a revelation on \"Vice Principals\", and now, in a much bigger role, I feel like she is going to shine.\n\nOutside of the Gemstone family, the supporting actors so far are really good. Tim Baltz is Patterson's soon to be husband, and he is a pushover and hilarious. Dermot Mulroney, as a rival minister, is kind of badass, and I actually found myself rooting for him in the episode. Casidy Freeman as Amber Gemstone, McBride's wife, is so good and menacing herself. She had the line of the episode to me when Baltz's character said that the family is backwards and they never give women a chance, Freeman speaks up, but before going into her rant, she asks McBride if she can speak. Even a guy in a super small role, Tony Cavalero as Keefe, the former Satan worshiper who is now working for the church and has found God, I found him absolutely hilarious. Everyone, so far, has been wonderful, and I cannot wait to see where they take the characters from here on out. I have also seen that Walton Goggins, one of my very favorite actors, is going to show up in upcoming episodes, and I'm sure that will rule. It is not only the characters that I cannot wait to see where they go, it is the story too. Like I said, no spoilers, but the way the pilot unfolded, things are going to get wild in this first season. It should be dark and hilarious.\n\nLook, I am a McBride fan. I am predisposed to like what he does, and a show like \"The Righteous Gemstones\" is perfect for his sense of humor, and what he wants to do on a show. I have a feeling this will be one of my favorites from 2019, and I cannot wait to see how the next 8 weeks pan out. I highly, highly recommend this show. It is really good.\n\nTy\n\nTy is the Pop Culture editor for SeedSing and the other host of the X Millennial Man Podcast. Ok people, one spoiler.

I was a fan of these guys when they were known as Mail Order Comedy and only did videos for YouTube. So, when they got a show on Comedy Central, needless to say, I was thrilled. And, the fact that the show turned out to be just as funny as I hoped was icing on the cake.\n\n\"Workaholics\" has had many, many memorable episodes. Front yard wrestling was a gem. Having the weightlifters that were lifting weights for Jesus coming to live with them, hilarious. Any episode that heavily featured Karl, tremendous. When they found a new weed dealer, excellent. When they made their \"burrweedos\", another classic. I could go on and on and on. I love this show.\n\nWhen it was announced that the seventh season would be their last, I was sad, but it felt right. There wasn't much else these guys could do, and Comedy Central has some great, newer shows like \"Broad City\", \"Review\", \"Detrioters\" and \"Jeff and Some Aliens\" that fit right into that late night schedule with relative ease. They have good shows already in place to fill the void that \"Workaholics\" might have left.\n\nWith that being said, \"Workaholics\" is going out with a bang. Every single episode so far has been great. Every one has been a home run. Every one has been hilarious. Every one has surprised me with how hilarious it has been. The show has always been funny, but each episode for its final season, so far, has been tremendous. Whether it features Karl and Anders talking about who is the \"top\" in their business relationship, only to find out that Alice's dad, played excellently by Dennis Quaid, is the true \"top\". That episode also features great side stories with Adam and Alice acting like a couple and Blake selling weed over the phone as opposed to the fire whistle Alice's dad created which they are supposed to be selling. That is when Karl comes in and takes that episode from good to great.\n\nOr, take the season premiere that featured Blake, Ders and Adam having to train new employees, who are just younger versions of themselves. This episode had the three main characters realizing that they are getting older and they may not be able to handle the pranking that the younger generation does nowadays. It also features a great scene involving Ders, Adam and Blake also hiring an older gentleman because he is 69 years old. The humor is as childish as you can imagine, and I loved every second of it. The three younger actors they got for this episode were awesome as well.\n\nThe third episode of the season found the boys going to the TeleAmeriCorp's corporate condo for a weekend, and of course they got into some shenanigans. First off, they weren't even supposed to be there, Adam stole the keys. But, Blake is hell bent on playing volleyball and seeing the sunset, Ders wants to get a hickey and Adam wants to film a video that will make him go viral. There is some great scenes of them playing volleyball, a al \"Top Gun\", but it pans out to reveal that they are beating children in the game. They also meet some ladies that they take a liking to, but they have bully esque boyfriends, like an 80's movie, and those scenes make for some great comedy. Ders constantly trying to find someone to give him a hickey is sad, but hilarious. Adam's attempts at going viral are all for naught, and he constantly hurts himself. The episode culminates with them being locked out of the condo while some townies have a big party without them.\n\nThen, last nights episode was really cool and really different. This time they focused on the character of Bill, a sad sack loner that works with them, but they put him in a thriller type of movie style episode. It turns out it is all a dream, and the whole office is playing a prank on him, spoiler alert. The episode was dark, violent, but above all else, very funny. The ending is a riot. Watch it, you will not be disappointed.\n\n\"Workaholics\" has only 6 episodes left, and you better believe that I will be writing about the series finale. But, I'm so glad that these guys got there shot and they ran with it and hit on something big. This show has given all three of these guys an extended career in show business as well. Adam Devine is becoming a bona fide movie star, Anders Holm has had some great bit parts in movies, \"Top Five\" comes to mind immediately for me, and so has Blake Anderson, \"Dope\" comes to mind. I will miss \"Workaholics\", but I have been extremely impressed with how they have come out of the gates so far, and I cannot wait to see what they do with their final episodes. I'm sure whatever they do, it will work and it will be funny. That has how the whole series has been.\n\nTy\n\nTy is the Pop Culture editor for SeedSing and the other host of the X Millennial Man Podcast.
