Thanks for checking out my work, and I hope you like this editorial!)\n\nSomething happened with adult animation this year. While it has resulted in more of the same with what you would define as adult animation, we have seen a slew of shows that have come out that have either challenged how we define adult animation or execute familiar elements in a way that feels refreshing and exciting. Sure, there are still a ton of shows that are by the numbers, but the fact we have gotten more diverse stories and stories that require you to watch and engage at their level is impressive. Even among the shows aimed at teens/families, they told more drama/character-driven stories that painted more morally gray arcs and plots, and that’s exciting when teams and productions are able to pull that off. So, when the duo of creatives behind Netflix’s Norsemen, Jon Iver Helgaker and Jonas Torgersen decided to make a new show, they crafted Captain Fall, which was going to be a live-action comedy, but was suggested by Netflix to be an animated series. So then, what did I think?\n\nFor some very odd reason, it was rather hard to find the production company that handled the animation for this show. It wasn’t Bento Box, but it looked like something Titmouse would have done due to how there was more fluidity in the movements, and the designs were different from the other shows that were out in the adult animation scene. Boulder Media, the same company behind the recent My Little Pony Netflix film and series is the only production company I could find next to Netflix. Either way, they did a good job with how many varied characters, backgrounds, and locations they crafted to make you feel immersed in how truly messed up the world is and what is going on with this one ship. Sure, you can tell they probably used some motion tweens, but that doesn’t really matter or hinder the animation, because it’s overall well-animated. The show’s visuals are on a much grander scale than most shows are able to pull off, and that makes for a more thrilling show when it feels like it’s not stuck in one town due to budgetary reasons. I also liked the designs. They don’t feel like more traditional adult animation designs that you normally see, due to how time and production force most teams to go for art styles that are familiar, or what is deemed as generic by viewers/animation fans that don’t know the ins and outs of animation production. The voice cast is also different for what you would expect from the normal adult animation casting choices. You have the likes of Jason Ritter, Anthony Carrigan, Christopher Meloni, Lesley Ann Brandt, Alejandro Edda, Bebe Neuwirth, and Adam Devine.\n\nSo, what about the plot? How do they pull off a story about a mediocre white guy becoming the captain of his own cruise vessel and has yet to figure out that this cruise ship has some rather shady and questionable antics and jobs? The show has a mix of dark and dry comedy, mystery elements that connect the interconnected schemes to the ship, and more adult antics that include a lot of violence and sex. It isn’t that graphic compared to other shows like Paradise PD, but the way they weave these themes and aspects of the show does make for a compelling series to watch. There is an actual long stretch of episodes where they spend more time with the build-up to each situation, and our lead who is played by Jason Ritter doesn’t even play a major role. It also has a whole arc of a detective trying to figure out the situation at hand. It’s interesting to see how much time is spent talking about stuff like human trafficking, drugs, sexual relationships via swinger culture, and the morality of our leads. It has a very dry sense of humor that results in a lot of dark comedy as well, and it caught me off-guard due to how most adult animated comedies try to be loud and shocking, when the punchlines here are delivered by the dialogue with a few physical and violent gags in-between it all.\n\nWhile our entire cast is morally dubious, there are moments where they either suck it up and keep doing the questionably shady things they have done for a while, or feel for our lead who is just blissfully unaware of the terrible things they do. While I don’t think it all works out in terms of balancing out the cynicism and the sincerity of it all, it does make for a show that stands out due to how the only character to stay true to his ideals is the lead. Yeah, he’s a mediocre white guy, but the kindness he shows for everyone does rub off on others as we see through the episodes that were given to me via a screener. It’s also got a lot of sequences full of humorous and endearing dialogue exchanges, even if the characters that are saying such things are not on the up-and-up on the morality scale. It’s interesting to see how certain characters react to our lead and how his actions hamper or help them.\n\nI don’t really have a straightforward answer on the overall impressions so far. It isn’t as entertaining as other animated shows I have seen, but it feels unlike any other show I have seen this year. Maybe not reaching the philosophical heights of Fired on Mars, but the fact it went the distance at all with crafting a dark comedy mystery series is really cool. Instead of doubling down on IP and recognizable brands for short-term gains, we need to keep pushing forward with original ideas, or if we are going to make something based on a popular brand, put in the elbow grease to not just rely on the recognition of familiarity. It won’t always work out, but there is something admirable when a new show or film with no safety net whatsoever, goes out of its way to try something out. I definitely recommend giving part one of the series a try and seeing how you all see how you feel about it. These are just impressions of mine that hopefully help with what you should expect from this show. While Netflix is trying to hire people for AI jobs, you should support and check out shows made by actual people.\n\n(If you like what you see, you can go to camseyeview.biz to see more of my work on video game reviews, editorials, lists, Kickstarters, developer interviews, and review/talk about animated films.

Thanks for checking out my work, and I hope you like this review!)\n\nHeads up: I was able to watch this series before its recent release via a screener sent to me by Netflix. I got no other form of monetization other than the screener. Thank you, Netflix.\n\nOne of the worst things you can do as an animated film is to be forgettable. When you are good or catastrophically bad, then you will at least be remembered for being really good or really bad. When you are unremarkable, well that’s an entirely different problem to have. You have left such a nothing impression on the audience that you will be completely forgotten, and then take up space on the shelf of a store or streaming service library that could be used for something that did leave an impression for a viewer. It’s important to know what kind of experience you want with your animated fare, and what you are going to have to offer to the viewers and reviewers that will get them hooked. Luckily, when you have some alumni from The Simpsons, Extinct, the focus of today’s review, is able to stand out from the other smaller animated film releases.\n\nThe story focuses on Op and Ed, voiced by Rachel Bloom and Adam DeVine. They are these circular donut-like animals known as Flummels. They live peacefully on an island with their kind, and are not the most popular beings among the Flummels. To try and fix a mistake they caused early in the film, Op and Ed find a magical flower that results in our two leads traveling through time. They end up in the modern-day, and encounter a small fluffy dog named Clarence, voiced by Ken Jeong. Clarence tells the two that they are in the future where the Flummels are no more. Ed and Op then set off on an adventure to try and save their species from going extinct. They’ll learn about the meaning of trust and friendship, and meet a colorful cast of characters along the way.\n\nOne of the first things to keep in mind is how there are two directors and three writers that have worked on The Simpsons behind this film’s story and script. You have David Silverman, Raymond S. Persi helming the film. Then you have Joel H. Cohen, John Frink, and Rob LaZebnik as the writers. While the film isn’t as sharp as the famous show, Extinct’s brightest spot is that it has a rather witty script. It’s not the wittiest, but it has a snappy comedy edge that includes a solid amount of dialogue, as well as visual, and dark jokes that give the film a punchier vibe than what you would expect. So many smaller-scale films tend to feel so boilerplate because they weren’t given enough time to make the dialogue and script more interesting. Extinct on the other hand, feels like it has something more to it, even if the overall story feels a tad busy. It kept me invested with what was going on because I wanted to see what the next joke was going to be or the next visual gag. The characters are solid enough with Op and Ed both being reflections of cynicism and reckless optimism, but they work well off each other. The side characters aren’t the most memorable, but they do have a few decent lines here and there that make them not entirely forgettable.\n\nAnimation-wise, it definitely looks like a film with a smaller budget, but the textures and compositing look good. There aren’t any real signs that the studios which made the animation have only the bare minimum with which to work. Everyone moves well and there were only a few times where the film showed its budget limitations. If you had to compare it to films in terms of animation quality, it’s on the same level as Red Shoes and the Seven Dwarves, Mosley, or Secret Magic Control Agency. It looks like a slew of the higher-end CGI fare from smaller releases. There is one musical sequence, and while the song itself is charming about whether you want to be safe in this safe room or die out there in history due to the many horrible things that happen in history, it’s not as much of a toe-tapper that it could have been. The voice cast is overall pretty great! They put in some more low-key comedy chops, and they deliver the jokes with some solid timing. It helps there are some fun actors involved with the cast. Ya have Adam DeVine, Rachel Bloom, Zazie Beets, Ken Jeong, Jim Jefferies, Benedict Wong, Catherin O’Hara, Henry Winkler, Alex Borstein, Reggie Watts, Nick Frost, and Richard Kind.\n\nThe one major downfall for this film is that the time travel aspect becomes way too complicated. It starts out well enough and easy to follow, but when the twist happens, well, it starts to unravel. It becomes too much, and it’s not like it needs to be this complicated. They do their best to explain it all, but even after seeing this film a couple of times, it feels like they still skipped a beat here and there. The side characters are also mostly forgettable. What elevates them slightly are the voice performances, but there are so many side characters that come in for one or two gags that they are never brought up again or add anything to the overall story. There were some of the characters that had a lot of fun concepts to them, but there was a real struggle to remember their names.\n\nWhile Extinct is still one in a dozen of smaller film releases that normally come out to either rent or watch and are completely forgotten afterward, it does enough to actually warrant being remembered. It has some cute designs that look good in CGI, the writing is really snappy, and it will keep audiences more invested than other films of its kind. It’s more of a diamond in the rough-style hidden gem than a real bonafide gem, but if you are out of animated films to watch in between the major releases, then I personally recommend giving it a look-see. It does way more than most animated films, and I commend it for that. Even if the film fails on story and writing levels, at least it tries to make its experience memorable. Now then, we are diving into the world of Aardman with their newest stop-motion special, Robin Robin.\n\nThanks for reading the review! I hope you all enjoyed reading it!

Thanks for checking out my work, and I hope you like this review!)\n\nLike I mentioned in my Storks review, The LEGO Movie was a huge worldwide success. It made a lot of money, it was clever, funny, heart-warming, and paved the way for Warner Animation Group to take a stab at the animation market. When it became official that there were going to be more movies based on the colored blocks, it was no surprise, but a tiny bit of hesitation. Could Warner Brothers strike gold twice with more LEGO movies? The true test is definitely in 2017 with the future release of The LEGO Ninjago Movie, and the recent release of The LEGO Batman Movie. Usually when spin-offs are announced to big money-making movies that follow side characters, you worry that the film is going to be a cynical cash grab. Luckily, with the directing of Chris McKay, a story done by Seth Grahame-Smith, and a script written by Seth Grahame-Smith, Chris McKenna, Erik Sommers, Jared Stern, and John Wittington, this spin-off/next entry of the LEGO universe, The LEGO Batman Movie, was spot on. Why? Let’s build the review brick by brick, and find out.\n\nWill Arnett returns as the biggest, richest, and most egocentric billionaire man baby, Batman. After stopping yet another heist by the Joker, voiced by Zach Galifianakis, Batman learns that the new police commissioner Barbra Gordon, voiced by Rosario Dawson, wants to hold Batman accountable for his actions, and be able to have the police and Batman work together. After some shenanigans that include all of the villains going to Arkham, Batman unintentionally adopts a young boy named Dick Grayson voiced by Michael Cera. Batman had better learn the meaning of friendship and family, because the Joker might have a sneaky plan.\n\nSo, what makes this movie fantastic, and have such a high grade on Rotten Tomatoes? Well first off, as a LEGO spin-off film, it holds up on its own. Let’s face it. The LEGO Movie was a lightning-in-a-bottle kind of situation, very much like the original Toy Story, Ghostbusters, and Beauty and the Beast. Future films will probably never be that good again, and that should be okay if the end product is still fantastic. Now that we got that out of the way, this is just a good LEGO movie, a good Batman movie, and a good Batman parody movie. Instead of taking from one part of Batman’s history, they take in the entire 80 years or so of history of the character, and shove it into a movie that almost reaches two hours. It shows off the best, the light, the dark, the worst, the funniest, and the weirdest parts of the character and the universe in which Batman lives. I know some people would argue that Batman: The Return of the Caped Crusaders is a better comedic Batman, but I really disagree. While I love Caped Crusaders, I felt like it limited itself by understandably only reaching for material from the Adam West Batman era. It also ran out of steam in the third act that hurt the overall experience. You don’t get that here. The LEGO Batman Movie is a giant love letter to everything amazing and goofy about Batman. It’s quite shocking to see a good spoof and parody film, since for the longest time, the trend of making good and creative spoof films died in the 90s when all the bad parody films were coming out. Why does this one do parody well? It’s because the people that worked on this film knew what they were doing, and love the property. If you are going to make a parody of something, like the Hot Shot and Airplane films, you have to know what you are making fun of, and love it for that reason. If this was made by the hacks behind current spoof movies today (who really should be blacklisted and fired from Hollywood), The LEGO Batman Movie would be nothing but stupid references, that only acknowledge their existence and nothing more. Luckily, the director knew what he was doing, and made sure to give the film a good story, because the team knew they couldn’t just fly by with just Batman-centric jokes. While Batman is definitely an over-the-top comedic version of himself, they do give him a story arc and personality and drive. The same goes for everyone else. Dick Grayson could have easily been the worst aspect of the film, but due to great writing and a fantastic performance by Michael Cera, Dick becomes one of the highlights of the movie. I also adore all the cameos and references, like how Two-Face is played by Billy Dee Williams, who played Two-Face’s alter ego Harvey Dent in the 1989 Batman movie. Even though I could get a lot of the jokes since I have seen Batman over the years, I feel like casual viewers can easily enjoy this movie. It’s not just made for the fans. Just like The LEGO Movie, I liked that the film does make fun of both incarnations of Batman, but doesn’t pick a side. Let’s be honest, Batman can work both in dark storylines and goofy storylines, and somewhere in the middle, too. Even the more serious Batman storylines have really stupid stuff about them, because when dark Batman is done wrong, it’s really bad and can be even more unintentionally goofy. This is a movie that knew what it wanted to do, and executed it almost perfectly, unlike a lot of DC’s live-action film offerings.\n\nThe animation is once again fantastic. It’s well made CGI that gets all those little details of LEGO blocks down perfectly, and while it does suffer from being too hectic at times on screen, due to everything being made of LEGO blocks, the fact that they cleverly limited the movements of everything to make it look stop-motion is still very impressive. All the characters look great, and the little details and side gags are clever and hilarious. I was at a screening with only a few people, and we all laughed hard. It was almost like an Edgar Wright film where you watch it and get a lot of the jokes, but then watch it a second time and can find more little jokes and details that may have been missed by you during the first viewing. The fight sequences are also creative, since if you can’t take advantage of the limitless possibilities of LEGO and the fact it’s animated, then you have failed as a director. The voice cast is perfect. While I know I support the idea of getting non-Hollywood celebrity actors for more theatrical film roles, when the casting is done right, it’s a wonderful thing. I don’t think I could have picked a better cast with Will Arnett, Michael Cera, Rosario Dawson, Billy Dee Williams, Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, Adam DeVine, Zach Galifianakis, Ralph Fiennes, Jenny Slate, Eddie Izzard, Seth Green, Jermaine Clement, Ellie Kemper, and you get the idea. It’s a fantastic cast full of actors with big and small roles that just make the overall film fun. I adore the chemistry between Batman and the Joker in a pseudo-romance plot that can only be done with a relationship between Batman and the Joker that isn’t creepy 18+ fanfiction. While Mark Hamill and Heath Ledger are always going to be the best Jokers, animated and live-action, Zach is easily my third favorite Joker. He just brings such a great energy to him.\n\nIf I had to complain about something about this movie, the first 15 or so minutes can be very fast, and then it changes pace abruptly. It’s not distracting, but it’s noticeable, and I can understand if someone found it to be too much at one time. Other than that, the criticisms I have are mostly nitpicks, like some of the jokes don’t land, and sometimes the Batman villains don’t really have enough to them in terms of personality. Still, these weren’t enough to ruin the experience for me.\n\nWhile this might not reach the high tier level of The LEGO Movie, The LEGO Batman Movie is easily the best animated movie of 2017 so far. It’s a love letter, a hilarious spoof of Batman, a great Batman movie in and of itself, and a wonderful entry into the LEGO animated universe. It makes me think that Warner Animation Group is going to become the new DreamWorks, which I will tackle in an article in the future. Now then, go see The LEGO Batman Movie. It might already be beating 50 Shades Darker, because it’s a film that everyone should check out. I’m in the mood for more DC, so how about we talk about Justice League Dark? Thanks for reading, and I will see you all next time.\n\nRating: Go see it!"
