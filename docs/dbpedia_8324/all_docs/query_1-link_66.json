        "text": "TV tonight: 'Arrow,' 'Modern Family'\n\nArrow\n\nCW, 8 ET/PT\n\nThanks to Oliver and his growing team of in-the-know associates, crime is at an all-time low in Starling City, leaving Oliver to ponder whether he can have a social life outside of all his Arrow-ing. You know the answer is probably \"no,\" and that Oliver should have kept in mind that old saying about the calm before the storm, as this comic-book fan favorite launches a new season with a new villain (Peter Stormare) who has borrowed an old name. Were that not enough, on the business front, Oliver comes into conflict with Ray Palmer â€” played by Brandon Routh, who knows something about superheroes and may soon know more.\n\nNOVA: Why Planes Vanish\n\nPBS, 9 ET/PT (times may vary)\n\nIn an age that seems so confident that there's a solution to every technical problem and an answer to every mechanical mystery, how is it possible that a plane could just vanish in the way Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 did? NOVA examines the search, the mystery, and our perhaps excessive faith in modern technology.\n\nModern Family\n\nABC, 9 ET/PT"
