        "text": "Born in Waterloo, Iowa, writer, actor and comedian Adam DeVine had a life-changing experience at the tender age of 11. While walking his bike across a street, DeVine was hit by a 42-ton cement truck, severely fracturing both his legs and requiring multiple surgeries. It was two years before he could walk again. Following high school, DeVine moved to California, where he attended Orange Coast College, and later studied acting at American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco. After completing his studies, DeVine moved to Los Angeles where he began performing stand up comedy, and formed the sketch troupe Mail Order Comedy with fellow improvisers Blake Anderson, Anders Holm and Kyle Newacheck. The foursome found a large fan-base online, and was able to parlay their web success into \"Workaholics\" (Comedy Central 2011-17), on which DeVine served as a creator, actor and producer. DeVine appeared in guest roles on other television series as well, including cult favorite \"Community\" (NBC 2009-2014) and the Christina Applegate vehicle \"Samantha Who?\" (ABC 2007-09). DeVine reached a more mainstream audience when he joined the cast of the hit sitcom \"Modern Family\" (ABC 2009- ) as Andy, Phil and Gloria's new nanny and a potential love interest for Haley (Sarah Hyland). DeVine also worked on the big screen as well, playing Bumper in the surprise hit \"Pitch Perfect\" (2012). In addition to his work on-screen, DeVine also worked regularly as a voice artist, providing the voice for the character Pizza Steve on Cartoon Network's series \"Uncle Grandpa\" (Cartoon Network 2013- ) DeVine's own series \"Adam DeVine's House Party\" (Comedy Central 2013- ), a unique blend of standup comedy and sitcom, debuted in the fall of 2013. Following supporting roles in \"Neighbors\" (2014), Nancy Meyers comedy-drama \"The Intern\" (2015) and animated hit \"Ice Age: Collision Course\" (2016), as well as a return to \"Pitch Perfect 2\" (2015), DeVine had his mainstream breakout as co-star of indie comedy \"Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates\" (2016) opposite Aubrey Plaza, Anna Kendrick and Zac Efron. After \"Workaholics\" wrapped up its final season, DeVine appeared in \"The Lego Batman Movie\" (2017) as The Flash before co-writing and starring in romantic comedy \"When We First Met\" (Netflix 2018)."
