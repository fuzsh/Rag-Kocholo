        "text": "For 11 seasons, Modern Family drew consistent laughs as one of the most innovative and original comedies of all time. \"Breaking the fourth wall,\" this massively popular sitcom endearingly delved into adoption, the LGBTQ+ community, and growing up in a blended family. With that in mind, we look at 25 of the best episodes of Modern Family.\n\n1 of 25\n\nPilot (2009)\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nWe are introduced to Jay Pritchett (Ed O'Neill), married to his second wife, the much-younger, voluptuous, and often emotional Gloria (Sofia Vergara), who also has a young son, Manny. Jay has two adult children. Claire (Julie Bowen) is a high-strung, unhinged mom of three (Haley, Alex, and Luke) and married to quirky, somewhat dim, but harmless real estate agent Phil. Her uptight lawyer brother, Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson), is in a same-sex relationship with the outgoing Cam (Eric Stonestreet). Mitchell and Cam just adopted a baby girl, Lily, from Vietnam — whom the rest of the family does not know about. Let the hilarity ensue.\n\n2 of 25\n\n\"Run for Your Wife\" (Season 1, 2009)\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nOne of the more memorable moments in Modern Family history came when Mitchell and Cam locked baby Lily in the car after embarrassing themselves when unsuccessfully trying to impress an Asian pediatrician. Trying to get Lily out of the car is one of Stonestreet's great efforts as Cam. Equally hilarious is Haley (Sarah Hyland) running over dad Phil (Ty Burrell) during her driver's exam test.\n\n3 of 25\n\n\"Fizbo\" (Season 1, 2009)\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nIt's the first time we meet Fizbo, Cam's alter-ego clown, who decides to show up at Luke's (Nolan Gould) birthday party. Phil is not a fan of clowns, but Fizbo, who also happens to be a tough guy who's afraid of scorpions, is still a hit. However, Claire's comb sheaths are not, and ultimately the reason for Luke's trip to the emergency room after a crossbow incident sends the party into chaos.\n\n4 of 25\n\n\"Moon Landing\" (Season 1, 2010)\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nOne of the funniest moments in the annals of the show came early on when Cam and Jay get together to play racquetball. Jay is uncomfortable with spending time in the locker room with Cam, and things get uneasy when their \"butts pressed against each other.\" At least it was not a \"splashdown,\" Cam notes in attempting to comfort Jay.\n\n5 of 25\n\n\"My Funky Valentine\" (Season 1, 2010)\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nIt's Valentine's Day and time to meet Clive Bixby, Phil's alter-ego. Clive makes an appearance as Phil and Claire look to spice things up for the night. Claire (or Julianna, as she's going by) endures a slight wardrobe malfunction. At the same time, Jay is heckled by famed comedian David Brenner. Not to be outdone, Mitchell and Cam, in their usual dramatic fashion, try to help a love-starved Manny (Rico Rodriguez) win over a girl.\n\n6 of 25\n\n\"The Kiss\" (Season 2, 2010)\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nMitchell is having trouble displaying his affection for Cam in public, leading the couple to list when it is appropriate or not to kiss in public. At the same time, Alex (Ariel Winter) endures a bumpy ride toward her first kiss. Not to be outdone, Phil is having a hard time with a printer owned by Jay, who Gloria has played while she prepares a meal amid the spirit of her dead grandmother. As we learn, the Pritchett men all have trouble showing affection, which results in several laughs.\n\n7 of 25\n\n\"Earthquake\" (Season 2, 2010)\n\nBruce Glikas/FilmMagic/Getty Images\n\nAn earthquake rocks the three families. Locked in a bathroom with a plumber, Claire learns more about herself than she might want to admit. It's also the first appearance on this list of Pepper Saltzman (Nathan Lane), Mitchell and Cam's eccentric and flamboyant friend known for lavishly themed parties and brunches. Jay and Manny also delve into a discussion about heaven and hell while on the golf course.\n\n8 of 25\n\n\"Strangers on the Treadmill\" (Season 2, 2010)\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nModern Family has been known to pay tribute to some great movies or directors. In this case, it's Alfred Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train. While on the treadmill, Mitchell and Claire decide to handle each other's problems. Claire tells Cam to lose the bike shorts, and Mitchell keeps Phil from embarrassing himself at a realtor at SCARB (Southern California Annual Realtors Banquet). Of course, neither plan works out as they intended, much like Gloria's attempt to get Jay to attend an employee's daughter's quinceanera.\n\n9 of 25\n\n\"Halloween\" (Season 2, 2010)\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nThe annual Modern Family Halloween episodes were among the most anticipated each season. But the first of its kind is still the best. Mitchell is excited to dress up as Spider-Man at his new job, only to see it backfire. (Jesse Tyler Ferguson received an Emmy nomination for this performance.) Claire disapproves of Haley's costume choices, especially her Mother Teresa take. The mocking of Gloria's accent is also quite comical.\n\n10 of 25\n\n\"Caught in the Act\" (Season 2, 2011)\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nThe Dunphy kids surprise Phil and Claire with breakfast in bed for their anniversary, only to find the couple getting busy under the sheets. While Haley and Alex are traumatized, their mom and dad are even more rattled. Cam and Mitchell try to get in good with the owner of a hot new restaurant, but, of course, they manage to hilariously mess that up.\n\n11 of 25\n\n\"The Musical Man\" (Season 2, 2011)\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nOne last gem from the sensational Season 2, and this time, Cam is the interim director of the play at Manny and Luke's school. To no surprise, Cam goes overboard and becomes hilariously overbearing. At the same time, Jay aims to continue his prank-based relationship with his brother, Donnie (Jonathan Banks), and Phil's attempt to include his whole family in a new realtor ad leaves them in a more risque light.\n\n12 of 25\n\n\"Treehouse\" (Season 3, 2011)\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nPhil attempts to build Luke (Nolan Gould) a treehouse, which is quite a comedic spectacle. However, the highlight of this episode is Cam trying to prove to Mitchell that he can pick up a woman, Katie (Leslie Mann) — \"Wham bam, thank you, Cam.\" Manny teaches Jay how to salsa dance to make Gloria happy. Also, Claire creatively helps Haley with her college application by giving her an example of overcoming hardship. Like the Kevin Hart cameo, too.\n\n13 of 25\n\n\"Little Bo Bleep\" (Season 3, 2012)\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nWhile it's probably not proper to showcase child cursing, watching Lily (Aubrey Anderson-Emmons) fancy the \"F-word\" is entertaining and made more funny by Cam and Mitchell's reaction and handling of the matter. Perhaps even more hysterical is Lily's light-up flower girl dress for an upcoming wedding. Claire, meanwhile, has a rough time at her town council debate vs. Duane Bailey (David Cross).\n\n14 of 25\n\n\"Virgin Territory\" (Season 3, 2012)\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nThe airing of some past lies over brunch results in Jay finding out he never recorded a hole-in-one he often boasted about. It also indirectly led to Phil finding out that Haley is no longer a virgin, a joyride for Luke and Manny, and the unveiling of Claire's penchant for the shooting range as a means to relieve stress. Oh yeah, and who can forget Cam's quest to find a piece of Tupperware he lent the Dunphys?\n\n15 of 25\n\n\"Baby on Board\" (Season 3, 2012)\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nIn the Season 3 finale, Mitchell and Cam are set to adopt a new baby from a Latino family and take Gloria (who unveils some interesting news of her own) for translation help. However, they must miss Lily's dance recital and find themselves amid a classic telenovela. Later in the day, Alex is off to the prom with a friend many believe is gay, and Haley tells her parents she and Dylan (Reid Ewing) are moving in together after graduation. Perhaps one of the most endearing moments of the series comes when Jay shares the stage with a dancing Lily.\n\n16 of 25\n\n\"Schooled\" (Season 4, 2012)\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nSchool is in session during the second episode of the fourth season. Haley leaves for college, while Lily's first day of kindergarten starts a little rocky (Mitchell and Cam don't help) but gets better with her new friend Conor. Jay and Gloria don't take their baby class as seriously as Manny would like, but in the end, lessons are learned. Let's not forget the book \"PHIL'S-OSOPHY.\"\n\n17 of 25\n\n\"Yard Sale\" (Season 4, 2012)\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nJay and Gloria are holding a yard sale for charity. Manny and Luke are curious about a trunk Gloria is secretive about (meet Uncle Grumpy). Meanwhile, Mitchell is leery about selling a slimmed-down Cam's \"fat\" jeans, and Phil has a little mishap while riding a motorcycle. This is perhaps one of the most well-written episodes of the show's run, particularly for Phil, Cam, and Mitchell.\n\n18 of 25\n\n\"Arrested\" (Season 4, 2012)\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nHaley is arrested for underage drinking at college, and she is kicked out of school. Meanwhile, Jay's ex-wife, DeDe (Shelley Long), shows up for what turns out to be a rather cordial visit. On the other hand, Cam has trouble watching after Luke, Alex, and Lily. It's a perfect example of the overall dynamic of the family.\n\n19 of 25\n\n\"Fulgencio\" (Season 4, 2013)\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nModern Family pays homage to The Godfather for the christening of baby Joe (or Fulgencio, according to Gloria's mother). Godfather Phil settles issues for himself, Haley, Alex, and Luke, a la Michael Corleone, when he served the same role at his nephew's baptism in the classic film. It's one of the funniest sequences in the history of the show.\n\n20 of 25\n\n\"Las Vegas\" (Season 5, 2014)\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nWith the kids at home, the adults will roam. In Las Vegas, that is. And in true Hollywood fashion, there is a series of misunderstandings. Whether we're taking butler dogs, male-revue dancers, overzealous ex-boyfriends, or failed attempts at magician glory, this episode is over the top. Then again, it's Vegas, so what else would we expect?\n\n21 of 25\n\n\"The Wedding: Part I\" (Season 4, 2014)\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nOne of the more underrated episodes in the show's history. It's Cam and Mitchell's wedding day, and plenty goes wrong with Pepper in charge. Wildfires in the area are forced to move up the wedding time, but Claire and Luke are stuck in the middle of a lake, and Lily goes for a ride while trying to retrieve Cam's tuxedo from the dry cleaners. At least Phil and Alex get a little bonding time in a department store.\n\n22 of 25\n\n\"The Wedding: Part II\" (Season 5, 2014)\n\nAlberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images\n\nThanks to the wildfires, Mitchell and Cam's wedding needs to be a rush job. However, the officiant pal Sal (Elizabeth Banks) has gone into labor. No problem. Online-registered minister Phil steps in, and guests are transported via school bus. There's a butterfly attack in Pepper's car, Claire's constant dress blunders, and a once-reluctant Jay saving the day to give Mitchell and Cam a wedding of their dreams.\n\n23 of 25\n\n\"Connection Lost\" (Season 6, 2015)\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nPerhaps the most innovative and ingenious Modern Family episode during its run is told entirely through the perspective of Claire's laptop, via FaceTime, iMessage, and iCloud, as she tries to track down Haley while waiting for her from Chicago. While checking out Luke's disastrous Mohawk or Mitchell's suave \"Yentl\" hat, Claire — and the rest of the family — believe Haley is pregnant and ran away to get married to Andy (Adam DeVine). However, Haley is closer to home than they think.\n\n24 of 25\n\n\"The Alliance\" (Season 8, 2016)\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nGloria, Cam, and Phil form an alliance as they continue to become frustrated with their respective significant others. There is plenty of funny moments, particularly Phil's run-in with a shock collar. While Jay, Claire, and Mitchell think they got their way in planning the family's next trip, their spouses end up getting the holiday to Italy they were all hoping for.\n\n25 of 25\n\n\"A Year of Birthdays\" (Season 10, 2019)\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nWhile some believe the overall Modern Family product waned in the later years, the Season 10 finale showed the comedy still had legs. The episode looks at each of the main character's birthdays over a year. Whether a hilarious roast of Jay, Mitchell's request to spend his birthday alone, Manny's hilarious yet heartbreaking talent-show celebration, or culminating with the birth of Haley's twins, it's another example of quality time spent with America's most beloved modern family.\n\nA Chicago native, Jeff Mezydlo has professionally written about sports, entertainment and pop culture for parts of four decades.
