        "text": "Aca-awesome! The Barden Bellas were first introduced to fans on the big screen when Pitch Perfect hit theaters on September 28, 2012. The musical movie has since spawned two sequels and in September 2021 it was announced that there’s a show on the way!\n\nThe movie followed a college freshman named Beca who was invited to join the school’s all-girls acapella group after it was discovered that she had a major singing talent. With her help, the Barden Bellas eventually changed their traditional music sound and went on to compete in the National Championship for college acapella groups. The fan-favorite flick starred Anna Kendrick, Brittany Snow, Anna Camp, Ester Dean, Rebel Wilson, Hana Mae Lee, Skylar Astin, Ben Platt and Adam DeVine, among others. Most of the stars even went on to appear in the two sequels — Pitch Perfect 2 and Pitch Perfect 3.\n\nWhen it come to the idea of a Pitch Perfect 4, Hailee Steinfeld (who starred as Emily in the sequels) is totally down. “Yeah. I mean, yeah!” she told Entertainment Tonight in June 2020. “I remember distinctly watching that first movie in the theater and talking to my mom afterwards. I was like, ‘That’s the kind of movie I want to make.’ Everyone always asks me, ‘What’s the kind of movie you like to make?’ That one! That’s the one. And then when I heard there was a sequel I was like, ‘What can I do [to get in it]?’ To be part of that, as a fan of the franchise was just so … I still can’t believe it.”\n\nEven though it’s been a few years since the final film premiered in 2017, the cast is still closer than ever!\n\n“We’ve seen each other grow so much over such a long period of time, but also because so many different things happened to us: We got married, we got divorced, we’ve been through struggles, we’ve had highs and lows and we’ve really kind of changed and grown into women,” Brittany told Us Weekly in December 2021. “I think when you go through that sort of thing with people, it bonds you in a way.”\n\nThe John Tucker Must Die star added that the stars are “like a family.” She added, “It’s really rare to find people [who become] so special to you and hold onto that.”\n\nGet ready for a major walk down memory lane!
