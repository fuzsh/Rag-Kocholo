        "text": "Warner TV suspended it’s TV deals with a lot of the major showrunners they had deals with. This strike is just one big power play for the studios. I’m surprised they aren’t just going around cancelling a ton of shows. 11) Family Matters (MAX) English Audio Description?: Yes Status: Ended Continuing his reign of terror, Urkel is given the right to direct a video for the family he’s not a part of. This is still season 1, and a character who wasn’t even in the first couple episodes has already taken over the series. Episode Grade: C+ 10) Designing Women … Continue reading The Too Much TV Roundup- 09/06/23\n\nFollowing up on my earlier post about The Great, there are rumors that HBo is looking at picking up the show, as some major stars were already rumored to be joining the Season 4 cast, and the show was apparently in pre-production. Little birds were telling me Jonathan Groff and Laura Linney would have appeared in Season 4. Will HBO save The Great? We will have to wait and see. #11) 911 (Hulu) English Audio Description?: No Status: Moving To ABC i was halfway into season 3 before I got this Eddie centric episode, which not only included combat sequences … Continue reading The Too Much TV Roundup- 08/31/23\n\nNot TV news, but Dune pt 2 has vacated 2023 due to the strike and the inability to successfully launch a promotional campaign. That leaves some gaps in the Oscar race. I had a feeling this would happen. 9) Justified (Hulu) English Audio Description?: No Status: Revival Now Airing There was a car that blew up, and I had to figure out who was in the car, or if someone was even in the car. Turned out it was a narrow miss. But Justified so badly needs audio description, that as I continue to move through the series, it’s becoming … Continue reading The Too Much TV Roundup- 08/24/23\n\nI did a two hour interview on audio description yesterday, and i still had time to watch all of this plus a movie. Plus, there’s actual TV news to talk about! Amazon has renewed The Summer i Turned Pretty for a third season, while Apple plus will not be moving forward with City on Fire. I’m OK with those choices,though I haven’t even started the second season yet of Summer. 12) The Horror Of Delores Roach (Amazon) English Audio Description?: Yes Status: Not Yet renewed I’m just not latching onto the Justina machado series, even though I love her. My … Continue reading The Too Much TV Roundup- 08/03/23\n\nWhere I Watched It: Netflix English Audio Description?: Yes The film that is lighting up the Netflix charts, I have a feeling, wouldn’t have done week in theatres. Despite that Adam devine is used perfectly in The Righteous Gemstones, his starring work in films seems to rely on a very specific thing he does. He’s stuck in playing a type, much like Melissa McCarthy or Rebel Wilson, and arguably Chris Farley was in his day. Devine might play characters who are kind and good hearted, but somehow, they are the butt of all the jokes. It’s a problem that Adam … Continue reading The Outlaws\n\nNBC announced some solid news items yesterday. Apparently, they were the only smart network, and actually have episodes banked. So, in the fall, new episodes of Magnum PI, Quantum Leap, and two new dramas, Found, and The Irrational will be airing opposite reality shows and reruns from other networks. 12) The Golden Girls (Hulu) English Audio Description?: Yes Status: Ended I’m not going to deep dive this episode, but the direct answer is that this episode wouldn’t exist in todays landscape. Sure, someone will point out that deep inside the barrage of offensive jokes is a heart somewhere, which is … Continue reading The Too Much TV Roundup- 07/19/23\n\nAudio description. It’s time Hollywood made that the norm, isn’t it? Anyway, i digress. 10) Outlander (Starz) English Audio Description?: No Status: Final Season So, I realized before starting to watch Season 7, i couldn’t remember where we left off. This show is hard enough to watch without audio description, but on top of that it has long gaps between seasons. So, like I did with The Witcher, I’m rewatching a bit. However, I only dropped back 1 season, to Season 6. Even with that, how the season opened, I was like… did I need to rewatch five? I remember … Continue reading The Too Much TV Roundup- 07/16/23\n\nHot on the heels of the three season pickup of South Park, Comedy Central has announced a two-season pickup of Workaholics, the live action comedy starring Adam DeVine, Blake Anderson, and Anders Holm. That will keep Workaholics going through Season … Continue reading ‘Workaholics’ Gets Two More At Comedy"
