The Huffington Post reports that Adam DeVine has signed on for the upcoming season of ABC's hit comedy MODERN FAMILY. The 'Pitch Perfect' star will take on the recurring role of a male nanny for Gloria's (Sofia Vergara) baby Joe.

According to reports, DeVine's character may also become a love interest for Gloria's step-granddaughter Haley, played by actress Sarah Hyland.

Modern Family's executive producer Christopher Lloyd describes the manny as a guy from the Midwest who is "fun and matches Gloria's energy in the house. But he doesn't want to just take care of the baby. He wants to sort of revive the entire household, which leads to some territorial clashes with Jay [Ed O'Neill] and Manny [Rico Rodriguez]."

DeVine is the co-creator and star of Comedy Central series Workaholics, which was renewed for two seasons earlier in the year. The actor and his Workaholics co-stars Blake Anderson and Anders Holm also appeared in the fourth season of Arrested Development.
