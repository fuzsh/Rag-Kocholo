Adam DeVine has joined Modern Family in a recurring role.

The Pitch Perfect actor will play a male nanny for Gloria's (Sofia Vergara) baby Joe in the new season.

Modern Family executive producer Christopher Lloyd has described DeVine's character as a "fun [guy who] matches Gloria's energy in the house".

"He doesn't want to just take care of the baby," Lloyd told TV Guide. "He wants to sort of revive the entire household, which leads to some territorial clashes with Jay (Ed O'Neill) and Manny (Rico Rodriguez)."

DeVine's character could also emerge as a love interest for Gloria's step-granddaughter Haley (Sarah Hyland).

He is the co-creator and star of Comedy Central series Workaholics, which was renewed for two seasons earlier in the year.

DeVine and his Workaholics co-stars Blake Anderson and Anders Holm also appeared in Arrested Development's fourth season.

Modern Family returns on Wednesday, September 25 on ABC.
