Diverters increase the visibility of earth wires, OPGWâs or phase conductors and they distract and divert birds away from the line. Light devices permit easy installation and cost-effective execution. Additionally, short delivery periods are allowed by the simplicity of the devices. Adherence as well as UV-stability of the diverters have been type tested. Bird diverters are available in white, grey, yellow, orange and red colours. Red is the most common colour used, since it stands out against a background of the sky, forest or clouds in all seasons of the year.\n\nMore info: Ilkka Rinne-Rahkola tel. +358 50 453 4834\n\n5.11.2019\n\nArrutiâs composite insulators and string hardware for 110 kV transmission lines\n\nTLT-Building Oy is constructing EPVâs Paskoonharju-PerÃ¤lÃ¤ 110 kV transmission line with hardware products manufactured by Industrias Arruti.
