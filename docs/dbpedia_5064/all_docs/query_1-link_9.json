        "text": "The average speed of the light rail is higher than that of the central city trams. The average speed of central city trams is about 14.5 km/h, while the average speed of the light rail will be about 25 km/h.\n\nThe central city trams run on winding streets among other traffic. The light rail will mostly run on a dedicated lane, separated from other traffic. The long straight sections of track allow the light rail to run at a speed of up to 70 km/h.\n\nThe journey time will not be shorter. On the other hand, the reliability of services will improve because the light rail line mostly runs on a dedicated lane which means it won’t get stuck in traffic like buses.\n\nThe benefits of the light rail lie elsewhere. For example, the light rail carriages can carry more passengers than buses.\n\nThe light rail will run from Itäkeskus in Helsinki to Keilaniemi in Espoo.\n\nThe service will run from Itäkeskus via Viikki, Oulunkylä, Maunula and Haaga to Pitäjämäki, from where it will continue via Perkkaa, Leppävaara, Laajalahti and Otaniemi to Keilaniemi.\n\nThe length of the rail line is about 25km, of which 16 are in Helsinki and 9 in Espoo. There are 34 pairs of stops.\n\nThere will be changes to bus routes in Tapiola and Leppävaara from August 2023. The changes are partly due to the light rail line.\n\nThe terminus of bus route 550 will move from Westend to Keilaniemi on 14 August. A new bus route 523 will be introduced. The bus will run from Westendinasema via Tapiola to Leppävaara. The bus will run via Ring I, providing frequent service between Tapiola and Leppävaara.\n\nBus 550 will continue to run between Itäkeskus and Keilaniemi until it is possible to increase the service frequency of light rail line 15. Eventually, light rail line 15 will replace bus 550, i.e. the bus route will be withdrawn.\n\nYou can recognize the light rail stops by their information poles. The poles have large passenger information boards attached to them.\n\nAll stops have shelters. At the busiest stops, the stop shelters are longer and stop platforms are slightly wider than at other stops. The busiest stops also have larger information boards than other stops.\n\nThe light rail line stops are not substantially longer than the stops for central city trams. At the central city tram stops, there may be several trams at a time.\n\nAt light rail line stops, there will only be one tram at a time, but the vehicles consist of modules and they may be lengthened so that they will use the full length of the stops.\n\nThe route was designed to serve as many passengers as possible while at the same time keeping journey times as short as possible.\n\nBoth Otaniemi and Keilaniemi are developing rapidly. A service running between Otaniemi and Keilaniemi can serve more passengers than other route alternatives without increased journey times.\n\nMoreover, there is a wealth of schools and jobs in both areas. For this reason the terminus is in Keilaniemi instead of Westend.\n\nPassengers make a lot of regular, predictable journeys to Otaniemi and Keilaniemi, whereas journeys to Tapiola are more irregular.\n\nIn the preliminary master plan in 2009, the route went via Laajalahti to Tapiola but the route was later realigned.\n\nWhen HSL started planning passenger information for the light rail line, the starting point was that the new public transport mode is closer to the metro and trains than the traditional central city trams.\n\nThe busiest stops (Itäkeskus, Viikki, Oulunkylä, Maunula, Hämeenlinnanväylä, Huopalahti, Leppävaara, Aalto University and Otaniemi) will be equipped with larger information displays than the other stops. At stops, announcements tell when the next tram is due and service disruption alerts are read out loud.\n\nThe stops have buttons to push to hear how many minutes until the next light rail vehicle will arrive. This is especially helpful for visually impaired passengers.\n\nThe carriages will have terminus announcements. The carriages also have door lights, and arrows on the onboard displays indicate the door opening direction.\n\nAccessibility has been taken into account in the planning of the fleet, stops and access routes to the stops. The carriages are fully low floor and stop platforms are level with the carriage floors.\n\nDuring the planning, visually impaired passengers and people with reduced mobility were able to test both the vehicle and stops so that accessibility could be taken into account in the solutions as comprehensively as possible.\n\nDrivers do not sell tickets on trams. There are card readers on which you can pay your fare with value (i.e. money) loaded on your HSL card. You do not need to show your HSL card to a reader if you have a season ticket.\n\nThe most convenient thing is to buy your ticket in advance, for example, using the HSL app.\n\nThe service will be operated with 29 high-quality, bidirectional Artic X54 trams that can carry 2–3 times more passengers than bogie buses.\n\nThe carriages are 34.5 meters long. The carriages have a seating capacity of 78 passengers and a standing capacity of about 136. The carriages can accommodate about 20 percent more passengers than the Artic trams used on the central city tram services.\n\nThe Artic X54 trams are fully low floor. The carriages have air conditioning and doors on both sides.\n\nThe carriages are manufactured by Transtech Oy, which is part of the Czech Škoda Transportation Group. The carriages are manufactured in Otanmäki in Kainuu, Finland.\n\nCan the light rail carriages also be used on the central city tram routes?\n\nThe track gauge and technical solutions of the light rail carriages would enable the carriages to be used on the central city rail network as well.\n\nHowever, the central city rail network infrastructure still needs to be developed in order to make the regular operation of light rail vehicles there sensible.\n\nIf you use the light rail line regularly, you might want to add it to My routes section at HSL.fi (under My options) or on the HSL app. This will allow you to get email notifications of any major delays, exceptional operating hours and other service changes.\n\nYou can also find disruption alerts for the light rail line in the Journey Planner and on our Disruptions and service changes page.\n\nAlthough the track has been carefully designed and the carriages are reliable and durable, services may sometimes be disrupted due to an accident or a technical fault to a carriage.\n\nPreparations for disruptions have been made since the launch of the rail project. A wide range of expertise, such as the experience of Helsinki’s current tram traffic control center, has been used for incident management.\n\nSimulation of disruptions has helped light rail line planners to understand how vulnerable the services are to various disruptions. In the simulation, the movement of the carriages was modelled as accurately as possible. Studies have been conducted, for example, on the effects of slippery tracks (simulating the autumn leaf-fall conditions).\n\nThe adequacy of power supply has been simulated to provide certainty about the adequacy of power supply even if one of the substations stopped working.\n\nIn addition to the termini and the depot, there are seven reversing points along the track where the direction of the vehicles can be reversed in case of a broken vehicle or technical faults.\n\nThe reversing points are located at even distances in order to make the removal of faulty carriages as smooth as possible. The reversing points are located close to public transport interchanges so that passengers can easily change to the metro or to commuter trains in case of a long-term service disruption.\n\nThe most important reversing points are close to Leppävaara, Huopalahti and Oulunkylä stations and in Otaniemi.\n\nThe final operating models for disruptions will be developed when the light rail line opens. A new operator in the incident management team is the Western Uusimaa Rescue Department in Espoo, which has no previous experience with light rail vehicle fleet.\n\nThe effectiveness of cooperation between all parties will be ensured through joint incident management exercises.\n\nPedestrians, cyclists and motorists should always use care and caution when walking, riding or driving near tracks. You should definitely avoid last-minute crossings because the braking distance of the heavy carriages is long.\n\nHow does a light rail crossing point differ from a regular pedestrian crossing?\n\nCrossing points are places where you can cross the tracks and where pedestrians are always obliged to give way to the trams. At traffic light controlled crossing points, always obey traffic lights.\n\nThere are no pedestrian crossing signs or road markings at the crossing points. The crossing points can be identified by the brown toned paving. There is a white tram icon in the middle of the tracks. The concrete surface is made slip-resistant by brooming. There is a normal pedestrian crossing on both sides of the tracks.\n\nThe light rail line replaces the crosstown bus route 550 running between Itäkeskus and Westend. The bus route is the busiest bus route in the Helsinki region and it is overloaded from time to time. The capacity of the buses has not been able to meet the increased passenger numbers and the reliability of the services has deteriorated.\n\nThe light rail line can carry more passengers than the buses. It is estimated that in 2025, some 80,000 daily journeys will be made on the light rail line. At the moment, 40,000 journeys are made on bus route 550 per day.\n\nIncreasing rail services contributes to HSL’s goal of providing customers with cost-effective and environmentally friendly public transport services.\n\nThe cost per rail passenger is low. Moreover, rail transport is local emission free and energy efficient.\n\nThe light rail line is part of the Helsinki region trunk rail network. Together with other rail services and trunk bus routes, the light rail line creates a basis for an effective public transport system in the region.\n\nThere are several valuable natural sites along the rail line, ranging from wetland sites to nature reserves. The sites have been taken into account in the planning and construction of the tracks.\n\nThe Laajalahti and Vanhankaupunginlahti Natura areas with large bird habitats are close to the rail line. The impacts of the construction project on Natura areas were studied in separate impact assessments. The bird habitats were taken into account by limiting high noise construction to outside the nesting season.\n\nThere are flying squirrels in both Espoo and Helsinki. In the planning of the light rail line, the squirrels were taken into account by safeguarding and developing the connectivity of flying squirrel habitats.\n\nThere are eight water areas around the rail line, most of which are trout streams. Spawning beds have been built to protect trout populations and to improve their living conditions. In some areas, passageways have been built for animals.\n\nTwo new bridges were constructed over River Vantaa, one for the light rail line and one for pedestrians. An endangered species of mussels, thick-shelled river mussel, is living in the river and the mussels were moved upstream to protect the species.\n\nDuring the construction, the diversity of the street environment was improved. Grass tracks increase green space. Green surfaces bind dust and improve the city’s microclimate.\n\nTrams are an environmentally friendly means of transport. Tram services do not produce any local emissions. The light rail runs on renewable energy, i.e. on wind and water power.\n\nThe braking energy of the carriages is recovered and used for air conditioning and for heating in winter.\n\nA high-speed rail connection that provides access to a range of services reduces the need for car use, thus reducing CO2 emissions and air pollution caused by car travel.\n\nDeveloping and increasing rail transport is one of the most effective ways to reduce transport emissions.\n\nThe light rail line contributes to achieving the carbon neutrality goal of the city of Helsinki, which means reducing green house gas emissions by 80 percent from 1990 to 2035. In order to achieve the goal, greenhouse gas emissions from traffic must be decreased by 69 percent by 2035 compared to 2005 levels.\n\nThe City of Espoo aims to be carbon neutral by 2030.\n\nThe light rail also saves urban space. One light rail carriage is 34.5 meters long and can carry about 200 passengers. If these 200 passengers travelled in normal size cars, with one passenger per car, the cars would create a queue of about 900 meters.\n\nThe light rail vehicles consume about 57 kWh per 100 kilometers. The energy consumption is slightly higher than that of the central city trams because the light rail carriages are longer and have one drive bogie less than the central city trams.\n\nThe average consumption of an electric car is about 20 kWh per 100 kilometers and the average consumption of a gas car is 50–70 kWh per 100 kilometers.\n\nHowever, there is often only one passenger in a car while the light rail vehicles can carry up to 200 passengers. When calculated in this way, the per passenger energy consumption of the light rail vehicle is significantly lower that that of a car."
