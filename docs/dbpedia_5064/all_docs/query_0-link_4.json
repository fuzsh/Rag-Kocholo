        "text": "There’s no need for tramway poles to be just a featureless element of the city’s infrastructure, an inconspicuous means of supporting lights and cables.\n\nThe Korkkiruuvi pole has a very complex lattice structure consisting of dozens of laser-cut elements of differing sizes. In order to weld the poles together, Tehomet’s Kangasniemi factory built a custom jig that enabled the massive pieces to be flexibly rotated during the process.\n\nAfter galvanization, the multipurpose poles used in the Tampere tramway project were given a Plascoat coating at FSP’s paint shop. Tehomet’s neighbour, FSP, is used to dealing with long and heavy items.\n\nThe finished poles were transported to the construction site in small batches at a convenient time. The poles were loaded onto KS-Rahti’s vehicles on specially designed racks and delivered directly to the construction site. They were then lifted into place for electrical installations."
