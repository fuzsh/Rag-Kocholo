        "text": "The frequency, capacity, and versatility provided by commuter rail modernization would benefit everyone, including riders and transit agencies.\n\nHigher all-day frequency, better urban service, and through-running would benefit many groups of riders. The present system, focused as it is on peak commuters from the suburbs to Manhattan, leaves the needs of all other groups unmet. Moreover, as we explain below, even peak suburban commuters who work in Manhattan and have little need to travel cross-regionally would benefit from modernization, piggybacking on what would be a much more frequent and reliable system. Much of this has been studied before in past reports, but nothing has been implemented yet, unfortunately. [40,41]\n\nExisting suburban commute trips\n\nWhile much of the benefit of higher frequency and through-running would accrue to people whose trips commuter rail does not currently serve well, existing riders would greatly benefit too. Some of the medium-cost, high-impact infrastructure investments outlined in Section 3B—electrification and high platforms—would lead to large increases in speed, and even benefit passengers on already electrified lines because of the improvements in reliability.\n\nThe biggest improvement is higher frequency outside rush hour, which today is treated as an afterthought. The 9-to-5 commute is no longer as predominant as in the past. Tech, law, finance, and academic workers all tend to both start and end work later than the 9-to-5 tradition. Corporate jobs have somewhat irregular hours: when a project is near a deadline, workers are expected to stay in the office for as long as necessary, whereas they can often leave for home well before the afternoon rush hour at lighter times. If usable train service home is not there at 9 pm, or at 3 pm, many workers will either drive to their job or live elsewhere.\n\nIndeed, in both Nassau and Suffolk Counties, 32% of all workers leave home for work at 8:30 am or later, too late to get to a Manhattan job by 9, but less than 19% of transit commuters do so. This is not an inherent artifact of mass transit commutes but a result of today’s narrowly conceived commuter rail service. Within New York City, where transit runs much more frequently off-peak, 38% of all workers leave home at 8:30 am or later, as do 37% of those commuting by transit. [42]\n\nShort-run fixes should start by simplifying complex service patterns whereunder many trains currently make a few suburban stops and then run nonstop to Manhattan. While the resulting schedule would have express trains, they would make more stops, for example all stopping at express stations like Hicksville, Jamaica, and Stamford. This change would not compromise speed: the current schedules are so fragile that, to keep the trains on time, the LIRR and Metro-North add a large contingency factor, or pad, to the technical minimum run time, reaching about 30% on the LIRR Main Line and New Haven Line. [43] While most lines in the region are not this extreme, these complex intermeshed service patterns cause delays that add time and inconvenience to trips.\n\nInstead, trains running simplified schedules with more stops would be able to run nearly as fast as the minimum technically feasible trip time between each station, avoiding any slowdowns. Swiss railroads have been able to reduce this pad factor to as low as 7%. [44] This does add up; trip times can, counterintuitively, improve if express trains make standard stopping patterns, similar to the express trains on the subway, rather than having once-a-day nonstop trains from as far as Ronkonkoma to Manhattan. Simple service patterns would provide significant relief to Long Island, allowing all trains from each branch to run either to Grand Central Madison or Penn Station with very frequent timed connections at Jamaica and Woodside.\n\nA final short-term fix is to integrate bus and rail schedules, so that buses can feed the trains better, with timed connections. In New Jersey, it is common for suburban commuters to ride a bus all the way into Manhattan, even if it runs parallel to a faster rail line. For example, the 113 bus runs parallel to the Raritan Valley Line and parts of the Northeast Corridor Line, serving all the communities at a substantially lower speed than the train. Elizabeth is 32 minutes from Penn Station by train yet is 47 minutes from the Port Authority Bus Terminal by bus. Buses duplicating trains to Manhattan should be redeployed to feed train stations instead.\n\nLonger term, further construction could ameliorate the compromised post-East Side Access (ESA) service on the LIRR. Since ESA’s opening, some trains on each branch go to Grand Central and others to Penn Station, both at reduced frequency from before. Moreover, before ESA, Jamaica had timed transfers between Manhattan- and Brooklyn-bound trains, but current service mostly eliminated those, and almost all trains running through Jamaica go to Manhattan.\n\nIn the medium run, as we explain in Section 3B, the region should build a transfer station at Sunnyside Yard, which we call Queens Junction, to enable cross-platform transfers between all Grand Central- and Penn Station-bound LIRR and Metro-North trains including those on the Port Washington Branch. The transfer can even be configured to allow for easy wrong-direction transfers for so-called diagonal trips, between Long Island or Queens and Connecticut or the Bronx.\n\nUrban trips\n\nCommuter rail can be used not just for suburban trips but also trips entirely within New York City (and, with the extensive construction we outline in Section 6, Hudson County). Today, premium fares and poor service discourage almost anyone besides a reduced number of suburbanites from riding, literally passing by huge potential pools of travelers. The volume of Manhattan-bound commuters in Queens dwarfs that of commuters on Long Island: 384,000 vs. 191,000. Similarly, the volume of Manhattan-bound commuters in the Bronx is 225,000, whereas in all east-of-Hudson Metro-North counties combined the volume is 149,000. [45]\n\nBronx and Queens residents have some of the longest commute times in the United States. [46] Moreover, these long commutes skew working-class, breaking the usual American pattern of suburban supercommuters having above-average incomes. [47] Today, those in-city commuters use the subway, which travels at an average speed of 18.3 mph [48], too slow for neighborhoods at the city’s edges. Worse, the express buses serving these areas average only 16 mph. [49] They also have high operating cost per rider, which the premium fares do not come close to covering, and carry few passengers in total. [50]\n\nUseful urban commuter rail would shorten those commutes considerably. Access from Co-op City to the rest of New York City is set to improve greatly when Penn Station Access opens later this decade. To deliver the most benefits, trains must run frequently all day and charge the same fares as the subway, with free transfers, since Co-op City residents would still need to take a bus to the train station. Likewise, those operating improvements would benefit other outer neighborhoods like Bayside, Wakefield, Queens Village, Marble Hill, and Rosedale.\n\nThese could also be paired with bus redesigns feeding not just the subway but also the commuter rail. The example we give above of NJT bus route 113, under existing suburban commute trips, has many analogs in New York such as duplicative buses on Long Island and within the urban core such as Newark, and Eastern Queens. [51] All the saved time would be plugged into higher bus frequency, creating an integrated show-up-and-go system with high reliability and, thanks to the connections to fast commuter trains, high average speed.\n\nNon-commute trips\n\nMost trips that people take are not for the purpose of work. The U.S. Census, which only asks about work trips, does not capture this travel, but other travel studies do. [52,53] American public transit is generally weak at serving such trips. In Metro New York, on the eve of the pandemic, 31.6% of commutes were by public transit, nearly all on a train rather than a bus, and residents took about 90 annual rail trips per capita. By contrast, residents of European metropolitan areas with similar commute modal splits, like the Berlin area, take considerably more rail trips because frequent, integrated service encourages non-work trips all day. For example, the combined metro region of Berlin and Brandenburg has a work trip modal split of 31% [54], yet its populace takes 200 yearly rail trips/capita. [55,56]\n\nIn contrast, the paradigm of New York-area commuter rail from the 1950s and 1960s discourages such trips. The current fare structure, dating to 1964, was implemented with the express purpose of discouraging such trips, called short trips (that is, trips short of Manhattan), in order to focus on the core market of commutes to Manhattan. [57,58] In that era, railroads were retrenching and rationalizing operations in order to reduce operating costs and stay profitable despite competition with the car, and the planners treated short trips as a distraction from the core market. This paradigm must be reversed in order to fit commuter rail service to the 21st-century reality of how people travel. New Yorkers could take many types of non-work trips on the train, some short, some longer, if the off-peak frequency were more accommodating:\n\nTrips to specialized neighborhood centers, often for ethnic amenities, like the Apollo Theater in Harlem, the Chinese supermarkets of Flushing, and the Indian supermarkets of Woodbridge and Edison. Commute data does not pick up these trips. However, other data does, where it exists. The Washington Metro publishes origin-destination data, which reveals special ties between Black communities in Anacostia and Columbia Heights. [59] New York has no such data, but the song “Take The A Train” is part of New York City culture.\n\nLeisure trips to amenities that are not available on every side of New York City. For example, since there are beaches on Long Island and along the Jersey Shore, but none in Metro-North territory, riders from Metro-North territory would benefit from direct trains to the Jersey Shore. Conversely, New Jersey, New York City, and Long Island have several large sports stadiums, while Connecticut has almost none. For that reason, between 2009 and 2016, Metro-North and NJT collaborated on a through-train from the New Haven Line to Secaucus with connections to the Meadowlands, called the Train to the Game, which was intended to show that through-running was possible [60,61] and demonstrate the trip possibilities that a truly regional rail network would offer. [62,63,64,65] This service could be restored and expanded: with future through-running, passengers from New Jersey could also get direct trains to Citi Field and Yankee Stadium.\n\nTrips between different university campuses, for social or academic reasons. Currently, academics at campuses like Princeton, Yale, Stony Brook, Rutgers, Hofstra, and Adelphi have access to the universities of New York, but not so much to one another. New York’s internal connections on the subway have elevated its research profile. [66,67] Paris’s through-running commuter rail has facilitated extensive ties across the entire region’s universities and research institutes; this has enabled it to become the world’s primary research center for mathematics.\n\nSocial trips, such as meeting friends who live in a different part of the region. Within the city, users of dating apps sometimes specify what subway line they live on, just because transfers between different lines are onerous; at regional scale, a distance of 20 miles on the current commuter rail network might as well be long-distance.\n\nTrips to and from airports, between New Jersey and JFK or between east-of-Hudson suburbs and Newark.\n\nHospital trips, by patients reaching appointments or staff traveling to conferences and seminars. Many commuter rail stations lie near medical campuses such as Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, NYU Langone Hospital in Mineola, Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch, and Yale New Haven Hospital in New Haven. Lake Success’s office and medical complex could also be accessed with better bus-LIRR connections.\n\nTrips to shopping centers in places such as Bridgewater, Stamford, Port Chester, White Plains, Hicksville, and Valley Stream.\n\n[1] Yonah Freemark, “For rail services, downtown sometimes isn’t the right place for a terminus,” The Transport Politic, accessed October 24, 2023, https://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2015/07/06/for-rail-services-downtown-often-isnt-the-right-place-for-a-terminus.\n\n[2] Ian Mansfield, “Elizabeth line passenger numbers beating forecasts,” Ian Visits, accessed October 24, 2023, https://www.ianvisits.co.uk/articles/elizabeth-line-passenger-numbers-beating-forecasts-2-64311/.\n\n[3] Transport for London, Elizabeth Line Committee Meeting, May 18, 2023: https://board.tfl.gov.uk/documents/g743/Public%20reports%20pack%20Thursday%2018-May-2023%2014.30%20Elizabeth%20Line%20Committee.pdf?T=10, p. 19.\n\n[4] Guy Taylor, “Elizabeth line sees hybrid workers flock back to the office,” City A.M., May 11, 2023. https://www.cityam.com/elizabeth-line-sees-hybrid-workers-flock-back-to-the-office/ (accessed October 24, 2023).\n\n[5] Amtrak, New Jersey Transit, and MTA, Penn Station Master Plan, MTA Board Briefing.

Moreover, following American tradition, 72nd Street has a full-length mezzanine; however, the fire code, NFPA 130, is also used in Spain and Turkey, where it is accommodated with smaller mezzanines. If it is possible to find slant digs for escalator shafts from the platform ends to street level, such as at the southern end of City Hall Park and at Zuccotti Park, then no mezzanine is needed. It is thus possible to build a four-track, two-level station for 12-car trains in the same approximate footprint as 72nd Street. Transit Costs Project, The New York Case Study, pp. 52–58.\n\n[227] Both the present-day and future trip times exclude wait times, but do include time spent walking between platforms at transfer stations, which is deemed to be three minutes at Secaucus and Hoboken and four at commuter rail-subway and subway-PATH transfers.\n\n[228] The reduction in trip time is partly because of through-running but also because of assumed electrification and high platforms on the Main Line, which we impute to reduce trip times by 14 minutes (two per station stop), regardless of through-running.\n\n[229] Peak crowding is south of 42nd Street even though peak employment is at 42nd Street, not 14th Street or Fulton Street.
